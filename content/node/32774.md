  you don't know how to see this at \"100%\" please, ask. If you think that the artifacts
  of conversion to a bitmap file have unevenly effected these two specimens, please
  don't. Both specimens were made from the same outline font, both specimens are hinted
  for and displayed with CT, and are shown at the same size and as much as possible,
  in the same composition. In addition, the same effective difference in typographic
  quality  can be shown for any extant CT font published so far. \r\n\r\nThen the
  question of course, is: how could any trustworthy readability research be based
  on a font like the one on the right? Unfortunately, this is no longer my problem,
  or Kevin's problem, or the researchers problem as much as it had become, quite quickly
  and massively, a users problem, as evidenced by the fact that I can barely hear

  body: I'm on a crappy old CRT. I prefer the one on the left because it doesn't vibrate
    as much, but I prefer the one on the right because of the apparent weight. If
    I had to choose I'd read the one on the left. The one on the right seems to have
    odd spots of blackness where letters meet or where the stroke is thicker. I find
    that to be distracting.

  body: "David, I find myself stuck between two poles. L feels very much in the mold
    of Jenson's 1470 pages, serene, calm, and even in color. But the letters feel
    just a squeak too letterspaced and open. R feels very bunchy, blobby, hiccupy.
    I do not feel as drawn to it for its darkness as others have been. While there
    have been some comments about individual letter structures and side-bearings --
    things that might concern us technically -- I am concentrating on the experience
    of the reader, who (if I understand this correctly) reads in gestalt clumps and
    does not perceive individual letters. \r\n\r\nI think I end up reading R more
    quickly, taking in the gestalts with more sureness, but it is fatiguing underneath
    because of the clashes of light and dark, the bunching of things.\r\n\r\nL feels
    a lot calmer, but sometimes in the sameness of color (goose-stepping as Nick said
    above . . . or I thought of a picket fence) I cannot find my way as quickly in
    processing the words; I see the individual letters one after another and that
    reduces my ability to take them aboard in clumps.\r\n\r\nWhat if I said I would
    not like either one as a \"forever\" companion, but something in between?\r\n\r\nAlso,
    are these meant to be read only on screen? (which I have done at 100%.) \r\n\r\nIf
    I had to pick one to read forever I would pick L.\r\n\r\nWas this helpful? Hope
    so."

    I find it easier to read the sample on the left. \r\n\r\nWhat Chris says about
    the straight-to-straight sidebearings being overly tight is true. The line length
    of the right hand sample appears slightly longer than the left hand sample, and
    the right edge rag is softer, so I guess that overall there are more characters
    per line in the right hand sample. I notice that the leading values are different
    between the two samples \u2013 with the right hand one being leaded more generously
    \u2013 although that doesn't improve its readability IMO.\r\n\r\nAre we actually
    looking at two different fonts here? or the same font with different spacing applied?"

  body: "Thank you all. I lied as in \"This is simple.\"\xA9 ;)\r\n\r\nThe most surprising
    thing to me: blur never came up, in word or root. Whew!\r\n\r\nThe x-hts are identical.
    Both samples use the same rendering, are from the same page in the same application
    on the same OS at the same time... only the font software has changed...and then,
    only TT instructions within the glyph data table. \r\n\r\nIf you like the sample
    on the right, you are all set. Many of the CT rendered fonts in Windows Vista
    will appeal to you as will type on the Mac and TV. Unless you return to print,
    or upgrade to a higher resolution LCD screen (or sample one), you will not know
    the difference. \r\n\r\nIF CRT: This is not a good test for CRT-users, apparently.
    Sorry, when are your birthdays and how wide is your CRT's desk space?\r\n\r\nIf
    you like the one on the left, you might soon be able to get up to the same speed
    and comprehension as you read in print. \r\n\r\nThe primary difference between
    the two samples is that one is prioritized for the rhythm and reading on screen,
    and the other to match the widths when printed. \r\n\r\nIf you are not sure, I
    will work to improve both sides, and I hope you read again without thinking any
    more about this. Now watch the roving center period...you are getting sleeeeeppy...your
    eyelids are heavy...you hear a yawn...\r\n\r\nInsomniatic Typophiles: An \"abundance\"
    of pixels are used in rendering digital outline fonts on the Mac (and in Cool
    type) because those mechanisms don't \"really\" use hints and anti-aliasing simultaneously
    for screen font rendering. Both designs in this study were made just light enough
    to avoid being too dark on the Mac. In Vista, (where hints and anti-aliasing are
    encouraged to work together), rendering is very light. So, some of the hairlines
    of the Mac version \"burnt out\" in Vista rendering. When I first saw this I thought
    \"I scanned some overused metal by accident?\", and I liked reading it very much.
    Though I still do, so much for personal opinion.\r\n\r\nThank you all again, I've
    learned so much. \r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
