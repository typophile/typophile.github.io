  am curious about the type. Anybody have any inside info on who \"Stephani Mercatoris\"
  could be? He seems to be credited with having either designed or set the type I
  can't tell which just yet. I am looking forward to showing it to James Mosley.\r\n\r\nThe
  University of Scranton has this to say about it:\r\n\r\nIoannis Maldonati Societatis
  Iesu Theologi : Commentarii in Qvatvor Evangelistas, 1596 is a first edition of
  an important commentary on the Vulgate Gospels. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia,
  Maldonado was \"superior to most exegetes of his time and inferior to none.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    been known in the vernacular as Etienne Mercier, Stefan Kaufmann, or something
    similar, in case that gives you any clues. According to a library record for what
    I think is the same edition, this Mercator's printing shop is listed as the publisher,
    at Pont-\xE0-Mousson in Lorraine."
