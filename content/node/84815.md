body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nI am right now in a project where the client wants to edit
  and existing font by adding a noise texture to it and then maybe change some of
  the shapes in the font as well, but adding the noise texture is the most important.\r\n\r\nI
  wonder how that could be done in the best way, lets say I add the noise texture
  to each letterform in Illustrator or photoshop and then, how do I take it from there?\r\n\r\nAny
  tips, links or guiding will be much appreciated!\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nRoger\r\n"

    know that I could just do it as a layer style in photoshop, but the client really
    wants it as a font file."

  body: "Since you said it was an existing font already: Make sure the EULA allows
    modifications! Many don't, and those few that do rarely allow you to sell the
    results.\r\n\r\nYou'll need some kind of font editor and a method of creating
    (tracing?) vector files from the noised-up letterforms. From there on it's just
    a matter of copy+paste. Off course, if you want it to look beliveable, you'll
    have to figure out how letterforms are distressed in real life, create multiple
    variants of each letter (informed by the real thing) and write some Opentype code
    to put it all together."

  body: "I would suggest making a high-contrast Photoshop file, importing it into
    the background layer in FontLab or Fontographer, auto-tracing, and then optimizing
    and/or cleaning up, if there are too many paths.\r\n\r\nYou will need to experiment
    to get the scale right.\r\n\r\nI believe there was a Typophile thread about the
    limits to the number of points/paths in a glyph or font.\r\nThere is also information
    on importing bitmap images into Fontlab etc., to get the size consistent."

  body: "Wow thanks for your help, it is greatly appreciated! Really good for getting
    me started, your help is much appreciated! I can post the result here later if
    you are interested in seeing it.\r\n\r\nIf you have the thread-link that would
    be good to, or I'll just try and search for it :)\r\n\r\ninteresting with the
    eula, is that only for modifying the font-file or is it regarding all customization
    or only for making it a .ttf and selling to a client?\r\nBecause I am not quite
    sure the client will actually receive the font it will be used on a interactive
    campaign and I am not sure the client will need to use it after that.\r\nBut that
    can be checked on the website of  the type foundry of the font right?\r\n\r\nAnyhow
    first thing seems to be to buy a Font Lab License and then make the font in photoshop!\r\n\r\nAgain
    thanks a lot for your help, this community is so awesome!"

  body: "I don't think that building a font the way I described would contravene a
    font EULA, because you are modifying typography created by the font, not the font
    itself. The act of making a bitmap file destroys the font outline BCPs, which
    are what's protected.\r\n\r\nThat's particularly so with the noise filter, which
    is unlike most if not all other Photoshop filters in that it produces a different
    result every time, with the same settings."
