  starting to design my cv... I was wondering if there are any handy hints and tips....
  \r\n\r\ndon't worry I won't be using word... and Ill triple check my widows and
  leading etc...\r\nand nothing gimicky...\r\n\r\nis it worthwhile to include an example
  of your work in a cv or should the cv speak for itself..?\r\n\r\nI have a website
  called &8 (my favourite character and digit) but surely I should make the c.v. more
  about claire mcmanus as I am looking for a job not for freelance...?\r\n\r\nIm slightly
  at a loss as it's the first cv I have ever really cared about...\r\n\r\nThanks for
  any hints and tips...\r\n\r\nClaire\r\n\r\nwww.ampersand8.co.uk"

  body: "The CV is not so important, what matters is the portfolio, and more precisely
    the contents of projects in the portfolio, not how fancy you made the portfolio.
    But by all means attach a CV, but keep it to relevant points. Don't list your
    paper route from high school and that kind of stuff.\r\n\r\nSo remember that the
    CV says close to nothing of relevance to employers in the design field. It's all
    about your work. In advertising (art direction) it's much more about your ability
    to deliver ideas on time and sell them - people skills i.o.w."
