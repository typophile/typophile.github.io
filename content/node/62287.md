  to be a Third, as in William Gates III.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the cap I is so heavily
  swashed that III looks like JJJ.\r\n\r\nIn desperation I have substituted three
  lowercase ells but there has got to be a better way.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/20090923-benwedding_4986.png]\r\n\r\nHow
  does one solve this problem generally?\r\n\r\nDoes one spell out \"The Third\" in
  the invite?\r\n\r\nOr should I give up and switch to a non-script face?\r\n\r\nOr
  does it look okay as-is?  I'm too close, I can't tell.\r\n\r\nthanks in advance.\r\n"

  body: "This certainly looks \u203Aill\u2039. What about 3rd, with rd as superiors?
    Otherwise you have to look for another (non-script) face with about the same contrast
    and italic angle (the latter could still be slanted manually to the same angle)."

  body: "I agree it currently looks too much like three lowercase l's.\r\n\r\nMaybe
    you can use the pipe '|' instead of the capital i? And if you are willing to do
    some more altering, maybe take the tilde, or a swash from another character and
    put in on-top/underneath of the three lines, to make it feel more like III (with
    serifs).\r\n\r\nGood luck!"

  body: you could build corresponding roman numerals easily. roughly like this (maybe
    a bit smaller and heavier):[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Flannery3rd_3560.png]

  body: "First, nice treatment on the \"y\" in the name - very pretty, and much better
    than the normal \"y\" in Bickham Script! I agree with both yourself and Solt;
    the three el's look bad, capital I is worse. Roman on a skew of 15% might work
    but I'd be tempted to use small caps rather than making the font smaller. I would
    present a few versions to your client and let him decide; he may surprise you
    and ask you to leave off the \"3rd\" in favor of keeping the font, which lends
    itself very well to a wedding invitation. Word of caution: if you're sending to
    a print shop as a .pdf, make sure this font embeds - I've had trouble with it
    in the past and had to turn to outlines.\r\n\r\nBest of luck! :)"

  body: "That reads pretty well. It's a bit of a shame that there's no swash as appears
    on nearly every other line ending.\r\n(Unrelated point: maybe just me, but that
    rsvp is difficult to parse.)"
