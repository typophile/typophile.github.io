  forum! Nonetheless would you mind letting me know your thoughts on this logo for
  a scuba diving company in Kenya. What I have attached is the logo incorporated into
  a sign board. The idea is to make large sign boards to place around the town. Each
  will be like 2m square and will be white board with 3 colours of vinyl stuck on,
  navy blue, mid grey, and gold.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_5436.gif]\r\n\r\nI
  can just imagine you all thinking what the hell kind of beast is that on the logo!
  I feel the same way. It's a manta ray... not my choice."

    the company name? Is it Aqua Ventures? or Ocean Sports? Is there going to be a
    phone number? I do like the oceanic colors. '

  body: "Ok thanks for bringing that up, Ocean Sports is a hotel on the coast in a
    town called Watamu. Aqua Ventures is the Scuba center based at Ocean Sports. The
    two however are separate business entities and have little to do with each other.
    Around here it is understood that Ocean Sports is the \"host\" hotel, but yours
    is still a very good point... most tourists might not be aware. \r\n\r\nShould
    I put \"at OCEAN SPORTS - WATAMU\"?\r\n\r\nAnd Aqua Ventures is a limited company,
    so should I put \"AQUA VENTURES LTD\" at the top?\r\n\r\nAlso what to people think
    of the mix of font faces? I very much like the ITC Legacy Sans at the bottom,
    but not sure about the Avenir at the top.\r\n\r\nAlso AQUA VENTURES is biased
    to the left, but balanced out by the golden sun biased to the right... how does
    that flow with Scuba Dive in the center?\r\n\r\nThanks"

    type could be stronger.\r\nYou don't need to put LTD - the general public doesn't
    need to know this.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The first thing I saw was a strange arm with a claw.  I think the ray from
    a top-down view might be stronger.  The type also lacks cohesion, and I don't
    like your name in italics.  In fact, the whole treatment lacks balance and flow.
    \ \r\n\r\nI would suggest getting the mark solid first, and then worry about the
    type, particularly if the manta ray is a non-negotiable in the piece.  Otherwise,
    you're just fiddling around with type to compliment a not-so-particularly strong
    mark.\r\n\r\n--\r\nNick Hladek"

  body: "Thanks everyone, Nick you are quite right, I should get the mark right before
    I worry about font.\r\n\r\nLet me give you some history about the client. They
    have been using the manta ray in their logo for 20 years. They were the first,
    and remain the most reputable Scuba enterprise on the Kenya coast. Here is their
    very first... and still current logo.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/old
    logo_6482.GIF]\r\n\r\nThey rely heavily on repeat customers. I thought therefore
    to acknowledge the old repeat customers it would be only fair to stick with a
    logo that they know for nostalgic purposes, but equally to acknowledge them by
    updating it and giving them the impression that the company is still strong after
    20 year and they're going to get the same professional personal treatment they're
    used to. (You know what it's like when you're a regular at a joint and then they
    get a new corporate image and you feel you're not a part of it anymore?)\r\n\r\nApart
    from all that we're very open to new ideas for a logo, doesn't have to be a ray.
    I also like the idea of a manta ray from top view but one of Aqua Venture's competitor
    has done it: http://www.buccaneerdiving.com/\r\n\r\nAny suggestions on other interesting
    beasts of the ocean/how to turn them into captivating logos?"

    will recognize are a blue ray on top of a yellow circle, but not necessarily that
    specific drawing of a ray.\r\n\r\nTry playing with these two elements, and simplify
    the drawing some more.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    an excuse. Try to direct your customer to a better concept by showing them. They
    picked some mark that is not clear for everyone at first sight. That is not a
    well known animal and looks like a bat... Ugly, even scary. What I first saw was
    a forefinger and a thumb pulling a sticker from its edge. Forget the sign boards
    and make a good logo that will work everywhere. You need a new concept.\r\n\r\nDivers,
    mermaids, waves, fish are first marks come to my mind. You asked for beasts. Why
    not go for cute animals like dolphins, sea horses, tropical fish if an animal
    is a must?"

  body: "Paul:\r\n\r\nI feel, as I am sure many here will agree, that when redesigning
    a logo it is important to redesign it and not waste more money by investing in
    a flawed and unmemorable mark.\r\n\r\n<cite>They rely heavily on repeat customers.
    I thought therefore to acknowledge the old repeat customers it would be only fair

    I also like the idea of a manta ray from top view but one of Aqua Venture\u2019s
    competitor has done it.</cite>\r\n\r\nYou must realize then that this mark is
    not even unique and is used by their main competitor! And as bad as their logo
    is, this is not any better.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I do not like the italic type on top.
    Try it in Avenir Bold. The colors are quite muted also and not really helping.
    Why not work in black and white first?\r\n\r\nI would also say 'OCEAN SPORTS HOTEL'
    to make it clearer. As for the 'LTD' that will just confuse the identity and a
    legal business structure means nothing to their customers.\r\n\r\nHope this helps.\r\nJay"

  body: "As a diver myself, I do not feel attrackted by the logo.\r\nPersonaly, I'm
    looking for fibrant. Bright. Happy. These colors are too much business-like for
    me. Oke, I don't know the underlying identity. But I my experience all the dive-masters
    were people loving their job. The business 'comes in second place. They love this
    life. Reflect this. \r\n\r\nIt is too much of the same. It is not unique.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy
    use two typefaces? Have you tried just using just one, more contemporary?\r\n\r\nYou
    can always choose to use just a part of the ray.\r\n\r\nI can't find a real concept
    in you text. Maybe you are just concentrating too much on the graphics now. First
    make sure you have got a good working concept. Then concentrate on the graphics.\r\n\r\n\r\nHope
    this helps, too.\r\n\r\nSuccess!\r\n\r\nRay"
