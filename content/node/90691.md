  glyphs to their components?

  body: The only Python I'm familiar with is Monty, but you can accomplish the same
    task, script-free, using the "Paste Special" command.

  body: "FontLab's Metrics panel also has a feature to do this\u2014 while in Metrics
    mode, there's a down-arrow underneath the active glyph which reveals a menu with
    \"Copy to composites.\" If the glyph has composites, a dialog will appear lettering
    you choose which ones to change. And if you're using metrics classes (or wish
    to take the time to create them), the Metrics Assistance tool could further automate
    the process.\r\n\r\nFor python scripting, you might find some useful ideas in
    a couple of of [[http://benkiel.com/typeDesign/|Ben Kiel's scripts]]. Robofab
    seems to provide more direct access to sidebearings (via the leftMargin and rightMargin
    attributes of the RGlyph object) than FontLab's native API."

  body: "Thanks gargoyle for your comments.\r\nBut copy to composites need you to
    do that manually for each glyph (one after one).\r\nThe python script will let
    you to select all glyphs and then run it to copy to composites automatically.
    Hope one can write this script.\r\n"

  body: "While \"Paste Special\" and \"Copy to composites\" must me done for every
    individual base glyph, the Metrics Assistance tool does allow for multiple groups
    to be updated at once (after a bit of tedious box-checking). But you do have to
    create the metrics classes first.\r\n\r\nSome previous discussions about replicating
