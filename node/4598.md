  body: There&#39;s a lot of material in Mac McGrew&#39;s &#34;American Metal Typefaces
    of the Twentieth Century&#34;, but the bottom line seems to be that Post Black
    Italic looks most like what your sample shows, although the R is not as &#39;swashed&#39;
    as your sample. There are a number of other faces, like Blanchard, Roycroft, Buffalo
    and Ben Franklin that appear very similar. You are talking about original designs
    dating from the early 1900&#39;s, so they weren&#39;t fonts then &#40;not digital
    ones, I mean&#41;. I don&#39;t know which have been digitized.

  body: A Nick&#39;s Font adaptation is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/saturday-morning-toast"
    target="_blank"> Saturday Morning Toast</a>, though it&#39;s not italicized and
    it doesn&#39;t contain swashes. <BR> <BR>By the by, according to Nick, the original
    face was called Curtis Post Shaded.

  body: I think Scriptorium has a version of Blanchard they call <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/scriptorium/ruffian/"
    target="_blank">Ruffian</a>. It&#39;s not italic either.  <BR> <BR>The problem
    is that often if people do digitize a classic typeface, they are cautious about
    using the name, and so you need to know it when you see it. I have tried to &#39;decode&#39;
    the Scriptorium collection because David Nalle does a great job of recapturing
    some of the old designs, but he almost always changes the names. <BR> <BR>So I
    guess, unless someone knows of some more interpretations, the answer seems to
    be that they are mostly in books right now.

  body: Thought I&#39;d mention that <a href="http://olena.com/fontsfordesign/preview.html"
    target="_blank"> Keystrokes</a> long ago digitized Roycroft <BR>as Raven Croft.
    Not really pertinent for this ID, though, as there&#39;s <BR>no italic.
