  Their layout person is a Quark veteran, and they're worried about the move to InDesign.
  Are there books, tutorials, seminars, converters, testimonials and such that you'd
  recommend for easing the transition?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Which versions of each application? Also, is any kind of plug-in being used
    with Quark to support the Armenian workflow?

  body: "I'll double-check but I believe their Quark is 5. The latest it could be
    is 7. They use a custom Armenian hyphenation plug-in (which works with a variant
    of the legacy ArmSCII-8 encoding).\r\n\r\nThey'll be switching to InDesign CS6,
    essentially because of this:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/94478\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I have had a fair bit of experience dealing with files held in older versions
    of Quark, up to version 4.11 (at which point content was moved to InDesign CS)
    including the dreaded Passport version and its unreliable dongles. I have also
    encountered plug-ins that supported multi-part CJK Postscript fonts, but those
    were pretty much a lost cause in terms of encoding to encoding conversion. \r\n\r\nEarlier
    versions of InDesign including CS2 (and possibly later) included native support
    for certain Quark files, including versions 3-4. This was handled in a Mac OS
    X environment when it still included support for Classic mode (pre 10.5). With
    more information I would be happy to lend any insight to the process, as it was
    incredibly frustrating but extremely rewarding when things worked!"

    only have the CS4 version which does a decent job although sometimes text that
    is vertically centred in a text box will shift.\r\n\r\nYou can also set the shortcuts
    to Quark (Edit>Keyboard Shortcuts) which is a little hit and miss.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: They may want to temporarily hire an experienced InDesign person as a consultant
    to help out with the first few publications created in InDesign, and to do some
    one-on-one tutoring, just as a temporary help to their own designer as he learns
    the application. It's a complicated program and it'll take him a while to get
    proficient and comfortable with it.

    Adobe MAX 2013 will be in LA in May. That's way too far off for what I have in
    mind, but just in case: would that be a relevant event here?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
