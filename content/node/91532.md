    web copy (Futura at 12 - 14 point on screen is horrible) and we went with Avenir.
    Avenir at that size, on screen, felt Futura like, but didn't have the problems
    Futura gets at that size.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=calibre+kris+sowersby&hl=en&safe=active&prmd=imvnso&source=lnms&tbm=isch&ei=qk9zT4qkGMatiAL20NjRCw&sa=X&oi=mode_link&ct=mode&cd=2&ved=0CAkQ_AUoAQ&biw=1904&bih=1074\"><img

  body: The company I work for uses Futura as one of its identity faces. We use Akzidenz
    Grotesk as a complementary sans serif. Not "modern" per se, but we do use the
    pairing regularly.

  body: "It would depend on several factors. To cite a few:\r\nLogo is all caps, mixed
    case, lowercase?\r\nWeight(s) of logo? \r\nWhat the client do?\r\nWhich is its
    style?\r\nFor what applications would be needed the complementary face?"

  body: Futura is such a classy sans-serif face, another sans-serif face would diminish
    it, not complement it, unless the two faces are radically different in some other
    way.  Try using a serif face to complement, such as Garamond or Bodoni. Bodoni
    text with Futura Light headings is a great combination. http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/11/04/best-practices-of-combining-typefaces/
