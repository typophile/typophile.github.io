  as Franklin's. Neither does the overall height. \r\nCan you help me here? Is this
  a different typeface?\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "Yeah thats what I was thinking, Franklin Gothic Heavy as there is no Black
    version of it.\r\nAnyway the G is odd. \r\nAs you said, might be it with some
    sort of distortion.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for the answer and time"

  body: Most welcome. I think it's stretched about 115% horizontal like this:[img:sites/default/files/old-images/stretch_5275.jpg]
