  body: 'The way I check for this is to do control/command (PC/MAC) - click near an
    outline. That chooses the outline, lighting it up in red. If there''s a second
    identical contour in black over it, you''ll see a little red around the black,
    rather than a clean red outline. Then you can just delete the extra outline.  '
