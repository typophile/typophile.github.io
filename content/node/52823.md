body: "Hola todo!\r\n\r\nI was just wondering if someone knows a web or print resources
  that lists most major Design \"Standards\", if such a resource can even be created.\r\n\r\nJust
  something listing things like... known paper-print sizes, abbreviations for such
  things, color standards (i.e. understanding when to use RGB, CMYK, Pantone...),
  and things of this nature.\r\n\r\nThanks-\r\nJD"

    web design.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Getting-Right-Print-Prepress-Designers/dp/081099206X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1229727557&sr=1-1\r\n\r\nMost
    of the info can be found on the web - I've looked stuff up in an ad hoc kind of
    way but I don't know specifically of a single resource that has all this info
    in the same place."
