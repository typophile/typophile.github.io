  be obligatory (it substitutes alternate versions of dcaron and lcaron depending
  on whether the following character has a left ascender or certain diacritics --
  for various reasons using alternates rather than kerning will simplify my life enormously).\r\n\r\nFor
  this particular font, I'd like the user to be able to turn 'calt' off if desired,
  so 'calt' is not an appropriate place for this lookup to be called.\r\n\r\nWould
  any problems arise if I were to hijack either the 'ccmp' or 'rlig' feature to call
  this lookup? Clearly these substitutions don't belong in either of these features,
  but they are the only features I am aware of that most OT-savvy applications call
  obligatorily. Is there another, more appropriate feature to use? (it would be nice
  if the OT spec defined some feature which was always active but which had no prescribed
  function)\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: "I think rlig would be just fine.\r\nI have made several fonts where contextual
    alternates overlap in lieu of precomposed ligatures, so what you propose would
    be kind of like that, but with \"invisible\" ligaturing :-)\r\nSimilarly, Jos
    has made some \"anti-ligatures\" and put them in \"calt\", e.g. a narrow \"f\"
    to precede adieresis."

  body: I'm leaning toward formally proposing an 'rclt' layout feature for required
    contextual substitutions. 'ccmp' can be reasonably reliably used, but this is
    a pre-processing feature and, ideally, it would be good to have a feature that
    is processed at the same time as 'calt' for scripts in which feature order is
    important to layout.
