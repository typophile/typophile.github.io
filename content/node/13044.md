  body: Kepler? It isn't as rationalised as most Didones, but is definitely in that
    classification.

  body: "Recently, URW++ has been offering all of their fonts in OpenType PS format
    in various levels. \"Level 1\" OpenType fonts from URW++ contain Western & Central
    European characters, \"Level 2\" OpenType fonts from URW++ also contain Cyrillic
    and Greek. \r\n\r\nBodoni Antiqua and Corporate A fonts are offered with the WGL4
    character set (West, CE, Cyrillic, Greek): \r\nhttp://www.urw.de/cgi-bin1/dalcgi/english/wgl4liste0.htd\r\n\r\nMore
    URW++ Didone fonts with just Western and CE can be found at: \r\nhttp://www.urw.de/cgi-bin1/dalcgi/english/Kliste0.htd?kgruppe1=1&kgruppe2=1&kgruppe3=3\r\n\r\nParaType
    also offers a version of PT Bodoni that includes Western, CE and Cyrillic characters:
    \r\nhttp://www.paratype.com/pstore/default.asp?search=Bodoni&fcode=PT_BDN\r\n\r\nNote
    that ParaType's Cyrillic version are design-wise usually much better than URW++'s.

  body: "[<em>Kepler is</em>]<em> Transitional (as lousy a term as that is.)</em>\r\n\r\nWell
    you know what terminology I prefer: Didone = Romantic (e.g. Didot, Bodoni), Transitional
    = Neo-Classical (e.g. Baskerville, Bulmer).\r\n\r\nKepler is interesting because
    it really is transitional, occupying a space somewhere between neo-classical and
    romantic, but a bit too informal to comfortably occupy either.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
