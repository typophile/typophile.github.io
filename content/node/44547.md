  a loss for a headline text. The resume is targeted at an entry level position with

  body: Geneva was meant for the screen. it's a little clumsy in print. If you want
    to go the Swiss route, use Helvetica instead. Tighter spaced Helvetica Bold for
    headlines.

    as pretty as some of the other sans serifs. I am really not wed to any particular
    route. I''ll give Helvetica a try. '
