    isn't an exact match, but it has a similar look/feel to it.

  body: "of course, the cheapest way (assuming you have an illustration program) would
    probably be just doing it yourself since the letterforms are dot-based. it could
    look something like this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ticket-type_3950.png]\r\n\r\ni
    did this in a jiffy just by using a grid and using the \"Round Corners\" filter
    (for an inkier look). it may take more time, but it might be worth it too since
    you can get it more the way you want it.. and it didn't cost $70 either."

  body: Nice work, claes! I suppose the value of doing the letters himself vs. purchasing
    a font would depend on how much type he needs to set. A full character set plus
    font generation can occupy a few days.

    is money as they say, so perhaps it evens itself out in the end.\r\n\r\nperhaps
    i should complete this as a font, with awkward spacing, letters and all.. and
    charge $70 for it! ;)"

  body: Thanks for all the suggestions - I'm gonna first take a look at the suggested
    fonts, and I would also be willing to create my own. It seems simple enough to
    do. Thanks for the tip!
