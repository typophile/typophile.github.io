body: 2 years ago I read an article in Baseline about it, how its being used by font
  system manufacturer&#39;s and so on. we&#39;re talking ebooks, blackberry&#39;s,
  palm pilots, cell phones ect. suddenly bitmap fonts were all the rage...then SVG
  stuff sneaked out and I thought bitmap was going to be a thing of the past but no
  we&#39;re back to bitmap again.  <BR>  <BR>so I&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s any
  allowance/ concern/ design being considered to exploit all this sub-pixeling.  <BR>  <BR>It
  would seem funny that techology is solving vector to grid problems for us, instead
  of the the other way around.  <BR>  <BR>So the gist of it being that 1 pixel is
  actually split into 3 columns and important parts are given priority with %100 black
  while the other 2  may decrease in shade.   <BR>  <BR>it seems awkward that the
  rendering of someone&#39;s design be left up to the manufacturer&#39;s when most
  likely we can create some pretty spiffy stuff for it specifically.  <BR>  <BR>anyone
  out there with more info? cause I&#39;d sure like to know how/ if this sub-pixelling
  is being used or affecting stuff  <BR>  <BR>  <BR>  <BR>

  body: Sub-pixel positioning is certainly being used &#40;e.g. for pretty much every
    bit of text I look at on my monitor&#41;. Are there any type designers deliberately
    taking exploiting the technology in their designs to improve screen readability?
    Yes. However, the nature of the a rendering technologies is that they change and
    improve over time, so it is a dangerous to try to design very specifically for
    a single rendering technology. For example, the version of the MS ClearType renderer
    that I use on my XP system is different and better than the version that shipped
    with the first version of the MS Reader. I&#39;ve seen versions of the ClearType
    renderer in development that introduce pretty radical improvements, so trying
    to address the current state of the technology in design isn&#39;t typically a
    good idea.  <BR>  <BR>That said, if one really understands how the technology
    works -- i.e. understands the basic principles and the details of the colour filtering
    model used -- then it is possible to take advantage of the technology in design
    and to produce outlines <i>and make hinting decisions</i> that will produce optimal
    onscreen rendering results that will likely be adaptive across several generations
    of that particular technology. My guess is that there are probably half a dozen
    type designers in the world who have a good grasp of this stuff.  <BR>  <BR>Another
    thing to bear in mind is that, while subpixel rendering can improve the screen
    quality of pretty much any typeface &#40;with the caveat that some kinds of hinting
    for b/w bitmaps can cause problems for subpixel rendering&#41;, a typeface that
    is optimised to take advantage of such rendering might not be the best choice
    for documents that will be read onscreen <i>and</i> printed. If you optimise a
    design for subpixel rendering, you are making the decision that this is going
    to be a screen font, and other considerations are going to be ignored.  <BR>  <BR>Yet
    another thing to bear in mind is that there are different subpixel rendering technologies.
    Compare, for example, Microsoft&#39;s ClearType to the Adobe CoolType rendering
    in Acrobat 5. Microsoft&#39;s is vastly superior for actual, immersive screen
    reading because they maintain the contrast. Adobe&#39;s subpixel rendering tends
    to grey the text, which is a mistake if your goal is screen readability &#40;but
    might be okay if your goal is wysiwyg display of documents that you&#39;re still
    expecting someone to print&#41;.  <BR>  <BR>I&#39;ve mentioned hinting a couple
    of times. ClearType rendering greatly simplifies the job of TrueType hinting,
    because far fewer hints and very few deltas are required to produce a decent,
    legible shape. Indeed, over-hinting can be a problem for ClearType. I agree very
    strongly with experienced hinter Laurence Penney that <i>hinting is design</i>.
    When you are hinting TT, you are designing glyph shapes for different output devices
    and resolutions. The role is similar to that of the traditional punchcutter, interpreting
    the drawings of a &#39;designer&#39; to produce an appropriate impression at different
    sizes. So the design job of a hinter is changed if the target devices are limited
    to subpixel rendering. Today, the situation is difficult, because there is a great
    diversity of screen technologies and rendering technologies at work, and it is
    hard to optimise for any one of them without downgrading performance on another.

    <BR> <BR>Encouraging. Who? <BR> <BR>&#62; a typeface that is optimised to take

    thousands of bitmaps out there being produced now-a-days...If subpixels stuff
    were involved there could be a whole slew of new designs/usages that can get really
    intricate. think of oblique bitmaps or scripts - with subpixels, instances of
    Shelley Volante might work in bitmap. well....you get my drift, other categories
    of type might have a chance on screen rather then the proliferation of harsh grid
    sans-serifs or techy-styles. <BR> <BR>but maybe I should learn more still - thanks

  body: In designing type for screen display using subpixel rendering, I&#39;ve found
    that quite minor changes in stem weight affect type colour radically &#40;unlike
    b/w or greyscale, in which radical changes in stem weight don&#39;t necessarily
    make much difference to the pixel pattern at small sizes&#41;. I discussed this
    with colleagues in the ClearType team at MS, and they noted that they had needed
    to make the stems of Berling Antique heavier for the Reader than they had been
    in the original design, in order to get the kind of contrast they wanted. This
    is what I mean when I say that a typeface that has been optimised for this technology
    may no longer be optimum for printing. It probably won&#39;t look terrible printed,
    but it would not look as good as it might if it were optimised for that technology.

  body: I&#39;m confused. Isn&#39;t sub-pixel rendering simply a &#39;hack&#39; to
    get more resolution out of an existing display? As such, how is optimizing for
    sub-pixel rendering really any different than optimizing for anti-aliasing?  <BR>
    <BR>Also note that as more and more people go with LCD vs. CRT, the whole sub-pixel
    argument will be moot anyhow.

  body: '<i>But not through hinting? Or does CT [still] ignore hinting?</i> <BR> <BR>Not
    through hinting: the outlines were adjusted. <BR> <BR>ClearType does not ignore
    hinting: it only completely ignores x-direction deltas. With increasing screen
    resolution, the question arises whether fonts for CT need any x-direction hints,
    however, since the interpolation across subpixels is so good. So I see a value
    in adjusting the weight of stems during the design phase, to optimise for screen
    reading, since this is much less time consuming and reliable <i>for this technology</i>
    than trying to control subpixel rendering using x-direction hints.'

  body: 'Darrel,  <BR>  <BR>I certainly would not characterise ClearType rendering
    as a &#39;hack&#39;. If you read the papers MS have produced on colour filtering,
    I think you&#39;ll agree that this is a pretty impressive and well thought out
    piece of work. I&#39;m not sure I would say the same about all subpixel rendering:
    Acrobat&#39;s blur everything until it looks smooth but grey approach might be
    considered a hack.  <BR>  <BR>Antialiasing is very coarse compared the x-directuon
    resolution gain in ClearType, so the difference is that in CT you can get a much
    better approximation of the real vertical stem weights. However, due to gamma
    correction and other screen issues, the kind of stem weights that work best on
    screen are not necessarily the same as work best on paper. Remember, I&#39;m talking
    about optimisation for the technology here: most traditional fonts look great
    in ClearType, even though they were originally designed for print. I&#39;m talking
    about a minority activity of designing fonts specifically for screen reading,
    and for which printing is not a significant consideration.  <BR>  <BR>I&#39;m
    not sure that I understand your comment about LCD vs CRT screens. Subpixel rendering
    specifically benefits LCD screens, which are the only kind of screen with subpixels:
    so the issue is far from moot, rather it is becoming more important. [Note that
    there is also a small but observable benefit of ClearType rendering on CRT screens,
    but this has to do with very subtle colour bleed between pixels, and not with
    subpixels. I don&#39;t think other subpixel rendering systems would display this
    particular benefit, since it is a direct result of the CT colour filtering.]'

  body: Cleartype has many disadvantages over other sub-pixel systems but wins through
    in its rendering at small &#40;&#60;16pt&#41; sizes. It appears that it works
    by using an un-anti-aliased rendering of the font stretched horizontally by a
    factor of three, then applies a filter to it to even out the colour balance, and
    then &#34;un-streches&#34; the image, leaving the sub-pixel rendering. This has
    the disadvantage of neglecting near to horizontal lines. Where other systems might
    give a smoother, anti-aliased line, Cleartype renders an un-aliased version. The
    diagram below demonstrates this... <BR>1&#41; my sub-pixel rendering using Paint

  body: 'I agree that ClearType wins principally at small sizes, which is what it
    was designed to do: it is not a technology made for graphic designers, it is a
    technology made for readers. However, you should remember that we&#39;ve only
    seen the first two generations of ClearType, and that a group of very clever people
    are continuing to develop it in new ways. Suffice to say they are aware that it
    currently looks like crap at large sizes. <BR> <BR>Your analysis of how ClearType
    renders to subpixels is not quite accurate, although you understand the principle.
    The text is not stretched &#40;supersampled&#41; by a factor of three: it is stretched
    by a factor of 16, so that different colours can be weighted according to optical
    sensitivity. I can&#39;t remember exactly how many &#39;stripes&#39; each colour
    gets, but I think it is something like R=5, G=9 and B=2. The human eye is very

    to have invented the idea of subpixel rendering. But Apple gave up on the idea
    very quickly, probably because of negative feedback about the colour fringe on
    the letters. The most brilliant aspect of ClearType is not the supersampling to
    increase x-direction resolution but the <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~jplatt/cleartype/">filtering</a>
    MS developed to reduce the colour fringe to acceptable levels while maintaining
    overall contrast.
