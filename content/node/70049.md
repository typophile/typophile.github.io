  Ocean's Thirteen. Is it the same font when used in red (I assume its in bold) or
  are they different?\r\n\r\nThank you before hand.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/p%2F1272838729174_5363.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/p2F1272838729174_6674.jpg]"

  body: Also, both white and red text are probably the same weight. The video compression
    combined with perceptual color illusions are making them look a bit different.
