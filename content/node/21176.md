  body: "Hi Joseph\r\n\r\nWell did you want <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/580/itcberkeleyoldstyle-family.html\">Berkeley,</a>
    which is just a rather pale ITC imitation of Fred Goudy's University of California
    Oldstyle, or did you want the <a href=\"http://www.p22.com/lanston/products/californian.html\">real
    thing?</a>\r\n\r\nAs the Lanston site will tell you, this one was commissioned
    for a book by Goudy called <a href=\"http://www.typeart.com/reference-books/typologia/typo-contents.html\">Typologia.</a>
    As I happen to own a copy, I can tell you that it appears very differently on
    paper than it does on the screen. Goudy set it large as a text face, about 14pt,
    with only an extra point of leading and a 27 pica column width.\r\n\r\nGosh but
    it's beautiful. I've noticed it on a couple of jobs lately \u2013 perhaps it's
    coming back into fashion?"

  body: "Hi Joseph \r\n\r\nI'd love to post you a comparison setting showing how much
    more muscular and full of old-world charm the original Berkeley was but...\r\n\r\na.
    I can't figure out how to post images to this thread\r\nb. The nuances between
    the two faces get really mangled by the filetype and size restrictions for submitted
    images\r\nc. I think I might be breaching copyright if I scan from the book and
    shove it on here\r\nd. If you already have a version of Berkeley and there's a
    budget consideration that excludes buying another version, then why post the topic?\r\n\r\n(I
    know, you're looking for inspiration); FYI, it doesn't look bad as a text face;
    Goudy set it justified with very tight word spacing and not a lot of extra lead,
    as I said earlier. When it's up at display sizes of course it requires letterspacing
    in the capitals. \r\n\r\nThe whole thing about this is that the original quirkiness
    in the design \u2013 traits of Goudys intimacy with mediaevalism and blackletter
    influences \u2013 got ironed out when ITC recut it, and the 'feminine' character
    you refer to is just anaemic by comparison."

    as feminine as ITC\u2019s?\r\n</em>\r\n\r\nBringhurst's <em>[[Elements of Typographic
    Style]]</em> compares ITC Berkeley and <a href=\"http://fontbureau.com/fonts/CalifornianFB\">FB
    Californian</a> at large sizes. If you follow this link, you can download a PDF
    and see how it prints for yourself. Lanston also has a version of <a href=\"http://www.p22.com/lanston/products/californian.html\">Californian</a>.
    I prefer Californian to Berkeley because it has more character and Berkeley has
    some real whaked out characters (that beautiful Goudy Q was just mangled!) If
    you want clean and crip, you may prefer Berkeley, but if you want warm and friendly
    I'd choose Californian."

    this is my comparison setting using ITC Berkeley\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Berkely-typlogia-sample_6013.gif]\r\n\r\nIn
    addition to messing with the proportions, the overall blackness and some serif/terminal
    directions, the recut did away with the ligatures and turned the shape of the
    capital O to something a lot more circular than Goudy intended. \r\n\r\nI can
    only hope he is looking down on the FB and Lanston attempts to rehabilitate his
    work after this unfortunate episode."
