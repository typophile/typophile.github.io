  body: "Fontlab seems to be the standard.\r\n\r\nAlthough, and I'm not sure if others
    agree. But Fontographer seems better for the actual construction of a glyph (manipulating
    paths/nodes, merging of shapes etc). Where FontLabs real power seems lie in the
    Opentype, kerning, metrics etc.\r\n\r\nI could be totally wrong tho, I've only
    just jumped into the FontLab abyss...and boy, it's superb!!"

  body: "Hi , im a tottally newby in fonts , i dont even do mines i used to do graffiti
    when younger but i had no idea of serifs,heleveticas and Avant garde's  , but
    i could also recommend you   http://fontstruct.fontshop.com/    really simple
    and cool ,  or inkscape , the newest version supports spiro curves and enhanced
    booleans.\r\n\r\ni havent tried sourceforge but i guess is a pure font editor.
    i guess im not yet prepared to learn all that, too complicaded for me now.\r\n\r\n"
