  for my personal collateral. I have been using Univers 45 Light for the sans-serif
  and have tried in vain to pair it well with a serif. I think I may have found a
  harmonious match in Sabon. I need some other opinions on this though, so I'm posting
  the two together for comments. Thanks everyone! -Cory[img:sites/default/files/old-images/New_5431.jpg]

    and make 'Graphic Designer' a bit smaller. You might even use Univers condensed
    to keep the lines similar lengths?

    more than font selection that lets you arrive at the proper mix of harmony and
    tension. (Don't forget the tension -- without it, all you have is bland.)\r\n\r\nYou
    can make Universe 45 Light work with Sabon in a book, where the text is, say,
    10-point, and Univers is used for chapter titles, say 20-point. Now, how are you
    going to make the subheads work -- subheads being roughly the same size as the
    text? Probably, you're going to have to use Sabon.\r\n\r\nThe other point I'd
    make is unless you're going to be a web designer, where I imagine you can't control
    much of the space, \"harmony\" will be as much a factor of the white space as
    type. That, of course, doesn't show with your sample; there is no top, bottom,
    left, right -- no trim."

    I was more focused on how the letterforms were playing with each other, but of
    course this depends greatly on context!\r\n\r\n@Nick Shinn: I actually have no
    nostaligic or other personal attachments to any one typeface. All situations call
    for their own solutions, but it is nice for a designer to be able to have certain
    type to use on their collateral. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately \"contemporary\" doesn't
    mesh with my dedication to modernism. I'm trying to find a type combination I
    can use until I die, not until the end of next semester. Also, the idea of a designer
    having \"personality\" to their collateral or to have a logo makes no sense to
    me because one designer is not a company. Why should one person brand themselves?
    It's your work that should really stand out.\r\n\r\nTake a look at the collateral
    of Massimo Vignelli and Paul Rand (see below): designers whose personal use of
    type on collateral reflected the \"crystal goblet\" approach to type: it's the
    information that is important, not the type itself.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rand_4279.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/massimo-1_4996.jpg]\r\n\r\n\"A
    new typeface is ideal for the neophyte who is intent on one-upmanship, and who
    equates the latest with the greatest\u2026Although newness has its place, good
    design is not merely a question of novelty. The typographer is more important
    than the type he uses. You can\u2019t blame the type if the typography is poor.

    My case for modernism is one of durability and accessibility. I want to save the
    real type exploration for my client and/or personal work. This way the collateral
    has the feeling of being open to anything, and is timeless. \r\n\r\nTypography
    from years past looks dated only when it is ornamental or \"cool\" at the time
    it was created. I want something built to last.\r\n\r\n@Begsini: I consider brands
    to be reserved for companies, organizations, studios, products, festivals etc.
    Individual designers needing brands? I am not convinced that is necessary or even
    helpful. I am more focused on the work I can do for clients or specific projects,
    and wanting that to be what I am known for. If my dreams come true and I get to
    open my own design firm, then it may be branded. Especially being a student, it's
    all about my portfolio at this point.\r\n\r\nI do not think that Rand and Vignelli's
    type was part of their brands. I don't think they had brands at all, or maybe
    Vignelli's red type is branded a little more than Rand. But it's their work that
    when you look at you say \"That must be Paul Rand\", not their letterhead or business
    card. While Rand's collateral was modernist, some of his work makes you feel like
    you're at the circus! \r\n\r\nAnd what is the purpose of a brand? To identify,
    convey feelings/values and be noticed. When I hand out my business card, which
    has 8pt black Univers on a yellow background (maybe a brand color eventually,
    but now just for contrast), People usually say \"wow\" because they are not used
    to the modernist approach. This way I stand out. My lack of trying to wow people
    creates interest because they are used to the opposite in this beveled/embossed/shiny/widget
    bullshit era.  \r\n\r\nIt is not my goal to be generic or ubiquitous, it is my
    goal however, to someday establish myself and my work as accessible and capable

    is to go beyond a time or context. It is not about nostalgia for any one period

    around, it matters what they did!\r\n\r\nAs soon as you design within a time's
    context, whether you are going with it or against it, you are hurting your chances
    at creating timeless work. \r\n\r\nYes, the context has shifted, but it will always
    continue to do so. Do you want to be stuck in yesterday's context, or create something
    beyond context which will last?\r\n\r\nCompare the 17,000 year old paintings in

    for my personal collateral. I have been using Univers 45 Light for the sans-serif...
    I think I may have found a harmonious match in Sabon.</cite>\r\n\r\n<strong>dear
    cory.lasser,</strong>\r\n\r\nThe problem of combining type is normally posed when
    setting extended text, as in the typesetting of a book, where the serifed face
    will serve the basic text, and a sans-serif the notes and other marginalia. Here
    we should not be surprised that harmony is the desired effect.\r\n\r\n<strong>Let
    us turn the microphone to Bringhurst (\xA76.5.5):</strong>\r\n\r\n<cite>Pair serifed
    and unserifed faces on the basis of their inner structure</cite>\r\n\r\nPay attention
    to particular letter forms, such the lower-case g (one story or two?). Compare
    both the roman and italics of both faces (very important). Read up on the faces
    to see if you can discern a common ancestry. You should quickly conclude that
    Univers and Sabon fail many of these tests.\r\n\r\nThe bard himself goes on to
    recommend pairing Sabon (a Renaissance face designed by Jan Tschichold) with Hans
    Eduard Meier's [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/syntax/|Syntax]].\r\n\r\nIf
    you want to look further afield for the sake of ``design'' (or because you are
    not typesetting a book), you might fancy Martin Majoor's [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-scala-sans/|Scala
    Sans]] or even his [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/seria-sans/|Seria Sans]],
    two faces that themselves have a serifed pair that you might consider in lieu
    of Sabon.\r\n\r\nUnivers has little to recommend it in this game, but if you admire
    the work of its designer (Adrian Frutiger), Bringhurst recommends marrying [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/meridien/|M\xE9ridien]]
    with the eponymous [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/frutiger/|Frutiger]].\r\n\r\n<strong>Of
    course, I won't discount the chance that you are pairing two different typefaces
    in order to make a ``statement.''</strong> This can be done, but you should be
    very clear about what the statement is.\r\n\r\nEXHIBIT A: Khoi Vinh's T-shirt
