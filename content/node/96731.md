body: "One way or another, I am going to launch iLUvfonts.com come January or so,
  and I was thinking about ways to generate a little buzz in advance of the release.
  Given by rather eclectic work history, I figured that a radically new approach is
  needed to market fonts\u2026sex.\r\n\r\nOn a recent scouting expedition to Charlottesville,
  Virginia, I noticed an inordinate number of nubile hotties wandering about the campus,
  and I thought: what if I were to put out a casting call for Victoria\u2019s Secret
  model wannabees, and set up a three or four-hour video shoot, during which time
  the young ladies would give their impressions of the most excellent qualities of
  some of MY fonts\u2014you know: stuff like chic, sassy, stylish, brazen, pouty and\u2014of
  course\u2014wacky. Between my brother Jim, who is an incredibly gifted film editor
  and my kid sister Sid, who worked as a lighting designer for Lori Anderson, the
  Rat Pack and did a stint as an Art Director of MTV, we could probably put together
  a pretty classy production.\r\n\r\nAnd classy it would be: all of the young ladies
  would sign model releases\u2014the princely sum of one dollar American makes them
  legal, you know\u2014and, of course, they would sign them BEFORE I rolled out the
  Margarita Machine\u2014\r\nhttp://www.mrmargaritacharlottesville.com/Margarita_Machine_Rentals.cfm\r\nThe
  commercial itself will probably go viral, but the \u201CMaking of\u2026\u201D and
  the outtakes would probably get a lot of mileage, too. Jeez: even with my lame-ass
  product line, the first-day sales could well meet or exceed my expectations. Big
  time.\r\n\r\nOf course, I think that it would be really cool for someone like Jill
  Bell or Jessica Hische to design my logo, but that might make for some awkward moments,
  since I wouldn\u2019t be able to offer THEIR font\u2014or any of you other dickheads\u2019
  fonts\u2014as part of my product line, marginalized pariah that I am. Bummer.\r\n\r\nOh,
  well: Monotype rules. Right, guys? Anyhow, I am really curious as to how we will
  determine the winner of the tagline contest: \u201CI want them\u2026ALL.\u201D  Oh,
  hell: who cares? After fifty margaritas in a dozen coeds, it might boil down to
  a steel-cage death match\u2026"
