<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi all,
I have designed this logotype (comments welcome) for college who works within the Health & Safety industry. I am happy with the structure and colours as I think its quite self explanatory but I wanted your feedback on how to best fine tune the space between the letters. I have wanted to keep the kerning quite tight as the structure of the symbol is already quite long and I believe this face works better that way. What do you guys think? It it ok to have the 'ty' touch as they do in 'Safety'? Is the distance between the 'He' ok?
It looks a bit clumsy at the mo.
I'm interested to know from those that know more than me on these matters.
Many thanks

<div class=commentbody>Hi there Javier,
Must say that I like the idea of the logo. Its always refreshing to see another use of the health and safety cross.
But there are a few things that I find a little uncomfortable. At first glance the logo reminds me of the standard design for signage for hospitals,exit signs etc, maybe this is the idea, in which case you have succeeded.
Something else that worries me is that due to it looking like these signs it almost lacks a 'logo' feel to it. I am not sure if this has someting to do with the resemblance to these signs. Maybe it would help to change the typeface to something similar that does teh same job. Something that, when you look at it, you can tell it is meant to look like a sign but at closer inspection stads as an individual logo because of the slight differences.
Also, look at the horizontal bar of the cross, optically it looks thick than the vertical cross. I am not sure if this is due to my screen though.
But overall I think yu have something that is starting to work. Remember that a logo needs to reflect the nature of the client, this is a logo that represents health and safety, you will find that on these signs the kerning is set a little looser than normal, which enables people to read the signs from a long distance. You may want to consider that in this logo. Tight kerning might be going in the wrong direction.

<div class=commentbody>I agree – the horizontal bar should be thinner thus completing the optical balance. And the inner letterforms are having a hard time handling the narrow spacing. Have you tried with another weight?

<div class=commentbody>Hi guys, thanks for your comments.
Indeed I was trying to resemble the signage on hospitals, etc. I wanted to make it ultra-functional. I guess though this 'angle' makes the logo suffer from a lack of charisma/personality in some way. I think I will lokk at other typefaces that still maintain the concept but with a slight twist.
I will heed both your points on kerning and face weight I'll post other options.
Many thanks,
javier</div>
