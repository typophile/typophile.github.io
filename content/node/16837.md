body: "I am working on the layout for a magazine about the Montreal music scene, called
  The Montreal Chord. The magazine covers everything local, from new start-ups to
  established acts, and shows and festivals. It also has a liberal editorial line
  and some serious news features. The layout uses very tightly set Century Gothic
  for Section Names and headlines. The editorial pages have a serious black and white
  design, whereas the rest adds colours and vibrant pictures. The magazine really
  focusses on great pictures, and the clean, modern layout accentuate this.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nI
  am now trying to decide on a good font for body text... I don't know whether to
  use Century Gothic all the way through, or to use a different font. If I choose
  to go with a different one, I would be looking for something a little retro, reminiscent
  of the days of 8-tracks and the October Crisis. Any suggestions? "

  body: I definitely would NOT use century gothic for body copy, but I am a big fan
    of legibility, and I don't consider body copy the appropiate place to get overly
    creative, or "designy." There's plenty of opportunity to get more expressive with
    the headlines, subheads, pull quotes, etc... There are a lot of good serif typefaces
    that could work with century gothic. There should be other threads on this site
    that would cover magazine body copy. Sounds like a great project, good luck with
    it...

    -- 80s as most of the target audience have no frame of presonal reference.\r\n\r\nI
    think you are thinking about a \"softer, nicer\" version of retro underground
    scene, and as Nick said, in reality were often brutally frugal on use of quality
    prepress material, with re-sized xerox images for paste-ups, hack & slash headlines,
    et al.\r\n\r\nIf you mean \"Mr. Black\" of early Rolling Stone magazine, he was
    hardly considered underground since he was previously art director for New York
    Times Sunday magazine, and a lover of historic metal typefaces.\r\n(edit: my mistake,
    NY Times was after Rolling Stone, per his bio <em>\"He did a brief stint at a
    Texas ad agency (oddly, but importantly, he is contemptuous of commercial corporate
    design), went out to Los Angeles and another underground newspaper, and then to
    Rolling Stone, where he became one of the principal creators of the Rolling Stone
    look -- taking the underground mainstream.\"</em>)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/RollingStonecover1.jpg]\r\n\r\nFor

  body: "Thanks for your suggestions. I'd just like to clarify. I'm not necessarily
    looking for something \"underground\". Rather, I want something mainstream that
    hearkens back to that era (even if it was only recently created). Just if you
    had anything in mind with that general Gestalt: a little retro, and a little different,
    but not really obvious. I'm more looking for something that will add to the overall
    image, while not being particularly ostentatious. As Chris said, body text isn't
    the place to get overly creative.\r\n\r\nAny more suggestions?"

    way, and \"constructed\" as we are able to do with digital technology.\r\n\r\nPolaris
    is an unabashed capital-M Modernist family in the mould of Helvetica, Univers,
    and Akzidenz Grotesk which inspired those types.\r\n\r\nSome of the lesser priests
    of Modernism descended upon Montreal from Switzerland and Germany in the run-up
    to the 1976 Olympics, meanwhile Oz Cooper's work has always appealed to Montrealers,
    with our love-hate relationship with American corporations and popular communications.
    We embraced internationalism and the International Style, but couldn't help ourselves
    from mixing it up with some sweaty funky expressionism."

    Canadian magazine text face, but not a type that is still widely used, I would
    recommend Bookman. It has a heft that would hold its own against the Century Gothic,
    and they are a good match history and style-wise. As a Linotype face, it has the
    period-but-modern feature of equal-width roman and italic. It also had some cachet
    as a display face at that time, especially the Italic with swash.\r\n\r\nOf my
    own faces, I would recommend <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/worldwide\">Worldwide,</a>
    a Century revival, with the large x-height coming into vogue in the early '70s.\r\n"

  body: "Thanks again for all your suggestions, everyone. Nick, I really like Worldwide,
    and I will seriously consider it.\r\n\t\r\n\u201COne font that ... early 90s.\r\n\r\n\u201COh,
    and the thought of setting ... revenge.\u201D\r\n\r\nI'm not looking for \"historically
    relevant\". Historical relevance is relevant to the past, not the present (thus
    the name...), and the magazine is not for consumption in 1972 but 2006. I only
    want to recall this city's glory days, which has nothing to do with being true
    to them. The point is to re-examine the past, not re-create it.\r\n\r\nAs for
    legibility, who cares? It's a magazine, not a textbook. There is always a tradeoff
    between style and legibility, and as I mentioned in my original post, the image
    sought is stylish and graphic (therefore treating headlines as graphics rather
    than words makes sense).\r\n\r\n\"Some of the lesser priests of Modernism descended
    upon Montreal from Switzerland and Germany in the run-up to the 1976 Olympics,\"\r\n\"There
    was another migration there during the Expo 10 years earlier.\"\r\n\r\nThat would
    explain why every single public sign is set in Helvetica (I'm serious\u2014every
    single one).\r\n\r\nEDIT: When I said \"... to recall the city's glory days\",
    I actually meant to recall the most dramatic and interesting (culturally and politically)
    period in the city's history. The Glory Days (the 60s) were pretty Toronto-esque
    (i.e. cookie-cutter North American city, not to offend any uptight white-bread
    vieille-souche anglo-saxon loyalists :P)"
