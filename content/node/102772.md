body: I am trying to narrow down 3 fonts that could convincingly stand-in for the
  fonts used in this low res image. I need to recreate the image as a vector file
  for printing and this is the only example I have, so unfortunately I am stuck with
  it. Everything else has been created, so I am hoping someone can hep me identify
  the fonts or point me towards suitable replacements. Kindest Regards!

  body: defiantone - Thank you soo much!  That works perfectly in there!  NOW, if
    I could figure out a suitable substitute for the "mode plastia" in the red box
    I can finish this project on time for tomorrow.  What a nightmare this has been
    lol

  body: i looked at that part, but honestly there are soooo many that look very much
    like it, and i can't determine if parts of the letters are missing, or not. a
    simple helvetica italic might be close, but the tails are hard to be sure of with
    the sample quality. i might peek again after i recover from the dandelion battle.  :)
