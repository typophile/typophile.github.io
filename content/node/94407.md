  a robust typefamily by Nicolien van der Keur, for complex text environments, now
  offers even more possibilities. The recent update includes a full set of phonetic
  symbols, designed upon request for the use in dictionaries, and the extension to
  polytonic Greek. Although the historical way of writing Latin and Greek is very

  polytonic Greek with their professional expertise.\r\n\r\nmore information at: [[http://www.type-together.com/Sirba]]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sirba-greece_5643.jpg]\r\n"
