body: "I've designed a family with six styles...Regular, Italic, Medium, Medium Italic,
  Bold, Bold Italic. The overall family name is Playoff Serif. The problem is the
  order that CS places them:\r\n\r\nItalic\r\nRegular\r\nMedium\r\nMedium Italic\r\nBold\r\nBold
  Italic\r\n\r\nOf course, Regular needs to come first, not Italic. I've read numerous
  documents on naming, etc. and have tried a bunch of different solutions with no
  luck. I feel like Muhammed Ali in the George Foreman fight. He lost te first couple
  of rounds..."

  body: "You might be over-estimating the Power of CS.\r\nA quick glance to my InDesign
    shows that some fonts are placed in the regular (convenient) order; others are
    not.\r\n\r\nA second look, however, reveals that the convenient order only happens
    with fonts that just <em>have</em> 'Normal' (i.c. \"Regular\", \"Medium\"), 'Italic'
    (\"Oblique\", \"Slanted\"), 'Bold' and 'Bold Italic' styles. Every font with styles
    other than these appear in alphabetic order, which is, of course, also some sort
    of convention. Adobe's flagship fonts Minion Pro and Myriad Pro don't have \"it\",
    so obviously they don't know themselves how to sort their own fonts!\r\n\r\nIt
    seems that for standard fonts the bitfields \"Bold\" and \"Italic\" are used --
    you can set these somewhere in your Font Info, but adding that one in-between
    weight \"Medium\" messes the system up, and CS reverts to alphabetics. Which makes
    at least <em>some</em> sense -- which one is 'darker': Medium or Regular? How
    about (scanning my font list) \"Allegro Script\" and \"Andante Script\"? \"Regular\"
    and \"Dfr\"? \"Solid\" and \"Inline\"? \"Italic\" and \"Oldstyle\"?\r\n\r\nThe
    only one that makes sense is \"Univers\" :-D"

  body: "For some interesting background information on determining a font's weight,
    read the [[http://blogs.msdn.com/text/attachment/2249036.ashx|Microsoft paper
    on WPF]], where the problem is clearly stated. They approximate a solution by
    looking at the font names -- but see my examples above, and some threads on this
    forum on weird style names.\r\n\r\nIt also occurred to me sorting could use the
    Font Weight. That's a valid value in most font formats, isn't it? (Is it?) But,
    evidentially, Adobe doesn't use it."

    code? Of course they use it for sorting. It's just that Regular and Italic usually
    have the same weight code.\r\n\r\ncubanica, have you tried setting the \"Font
    is italic\" bit and/or setting a value for the Italic angle? Or call the Italic
    font \"Regular Italic\" ;)"
