  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi, Typophiles,

I'm trying to figure out how, or whether, I can reproduce on the web the usual symbol to represent elision in Latin poetry.  That symbol is something like a stretched-out breve, or a parenthesis symbol turned on its side, written below the space between the two elided words.  If possible--I don't expect this--the symbol should extend slightly below the word on each side.  A clumsy example using an image can be seen on the page at http://members.toast.net/prufrock/latinmeter.html.

Any ideas, or good references I could go to?  I have looked around quite a bit, but so far have had no luck.

Thanks,

Clem</div>

I am not familiar with Latin poetry, but Unicode has an ‘undertie’ (<a href="http://www.decodeunicode.org/de/u+203f">U+203F</a>), which may or may not be the character you are looking for. You can use it by copying it into your HTML document. Will it shows up on the reader’s screen? That depends, one needs to have at least one font installed that features this character. On my system, Arial Unicode, Lucida Grande, Courier, Helvetica and a couple other fonts do. Georgia does not, which is the reason why it might look off here on Typophile: With the current stylesheet, the letters are in Georgia, while the undertie is rendered in something else (for me).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The undertie is used in IPA phonetic transcription to indicate the “absence of a break”. That means that there isn’t the usual tiny pause between words that would otherwise be expected. Aert Kuipers and a few of his European students used it to indicate clitics in Salishan languages, whereas nowadays most people use the equals sign instead: s‿qał versus s=qał, both pronounced like [sqaɬ] and not [s qaɬ]. (I made this example up for illustrative purposes.) Clitics are elements that are word-like but not entirely independent words, usually because they can’t be said alone. English examples are the <em>’s</em> for possessives like <em>Phillip and Edwin and Alfred<strong>’s</strong> apartment</em> and the <em>n’t</em> for negation like <em>do<strong>n’t</strong></em> ‘do not’ and <em>could<strong>n’t</strong></em> ‘could not’. There’s also the <em>’d</em> for the ‘would’ clitic and <em>’ve</em> for the ‘have’ clitic, e.g. <em>I<strong>’d</strong>n’t<strong>’ve</strong></em> ‘I would not have’. All of these could be represented with the undertie in transcription, so /... ʔænd ˈʔæl.fɹɛd‿z .../, /ˈkʊd‿n̩t/, and /ˈʔai̯‿d‿n̩t‿əv/.

I don’t know much about Latin poetry, but I suspect that the IPA symbol probably derives from the Latin academic tradition. Hence it’d be appropriate to return it to its Latin-usage roots.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Looking at the character map on Fonts.com I don’t see any major additions to the Latin repertoire of Georgia Pro. My default copy of Georgia seems to contain basically the same inventory of Latin letters as well as a basic selection of Greek and Cyrillic. Same impoverished selection of diacritics and spacing modifier letters too. It looks really like the only new things are the addition of a lot of new weights and the condensed series. What good are more weights if you can’t actually write what you want? I’m going to have to pass on this one.</div>

I've spoken to Harry Parker (Mike's son) at Font Bureau. Their official position is the end user may modify fonts for their own use, AFTER Font Bureau has both seen and approved the modification. Approval is the key here. Some font manufacturers -- H&FJ comes immediately to mind -- take the same official position, but will not even reply to a request.

Harry also indicated that in keeping with the old Linotype position, expanded character sets may already exist. The old Linotype policy was that the original customer paid for the modifications. Anyone could then purchase them, but they were not advertised. This gave the person who paid for them a slight edge. Of course, this came about in days when type was not available on a personal computer; it makes rather less sense today.

I don't know who actually owns Georgia. Mathew Carter drew it of course, and may retain the right to allow modification. But I suspect FB to be far more accommodating than H&FJ. It wouldn't hurt to ask them. 

Your choice, I suspect, would be to ask for permission to modify if you are willing to limit use of the fonts to yourself, or pay for the extra character sets if you want fonts which can be distributed.

* * *

By the way, for Greek poetry, the long breve is also needed. In a way, this discussion rivals the one on character sets for linguists. IIRC (and I may not) the needed characters only exist in Unicode in the combining diacriticals. Of course, they are not diacriticals, but if your desire is simply to put ink on paper or pixels on the screen, no one will know -- always assuming a device that will actually use your fonts.</div>

So do you think their official position is merely a front
so people don't accuse them of intransigence? How many
times have you asked? I would imagine that they (and FB
in cases where they don't approve a modification) would
at least be willing to bother quoting a -possibly inflated-
fee for doing the mod themselves.

I was giving a paper on type and type modification at the AAUP national meeting this past June. As a part of that, I got in touch with an number of the mid-sized foundries/font publishers to clarify their positions. H&FJ was both called (message left) and emailed. The intent and expected use of the information was a part of each message. I didn't send a registered letter. 

I know another type designer/typographer/graphic designer of some repute, who regularly appears on Typophile, who had a similar experience. You are free to draw whatever conclusions you would like from this.

The position of the very large publishers is known: by this, I mean FontFont, and the Linotype/Monotype conglomerate. I also mean today, not the 1990s, when all were rather more accommodating.

If you want more information, lets start a separate thread. The remark on FB was a bit off topic anyway, but seemed pertinent to a question.</div>

TeX systems has something called "virtual" fonts that can build glyphs from different "real" fonts, so one can go away without actually modifying the font, but it has limited glyph positioning support (for e.g. building accented glyphs) AFAIK. LuaTeX can even build virtual fonts on the fly, and one can supplement them with OpenType code to do all sorts of glyphs positioning trickery, but TeX (and even more so LuaTeX) is not for every one.</div>

This is a long & involved topic. What my far from exhaustive research showed was that regardless of what the EULA says, the publisher may give permission to modify. IIRC, Adobe's EULA forbids modifications, but the same group of lawyers responsible for the EULA OKd the FAQs where permission is explicitly given.

Christobal Henestrosa's EULA does give permission, if he is notified. I believe a few others, -- perhaps in the Village group? -- have something similar.

As a type designer, you have to consider markets. There are about 100 presses in the Association of American University Presses. Some are small, 3-4 book per year. Some, like Oxford, Cambridge, Yale, Harvard, Chicago, etc. publish a lot of books. Or at least we think so. Maybe not, when considering publshing as a whole.

Secondly, 90% of the characters needed are accented letters. Modifying the font to take care of these rids one of a nuisance. It is not needed, just a convenience. As an oddity, we can set Arabic or any of the Indic scripts in the original language, but setting the words romanized can be a nuisance. The window you have is there are enough words you don't want to do the work by hand, but not enough to write a script to take care of it. Small window.

It's when you get into needing characters like an eng that you can't (yet) do the work within a layout program such as InDesign. As you know, you can legally modify the hell out of a font in the layout program, and they are getting more tools all the time. Well, it isn't hard to make up a supplemental font, which you might need anyway to preserve syntactic integrity with some accented characters -- the accent characters like dot below, not the alpha/numeric glyphs. Again, nuisance value.

Etc. etc.

Basically, what I advise AAUP presses to do is to investigate carefully what the font publisher will allow before purchasing a font. Secondly, there are getting to be enough open source fonts that we as a group can combine our skills and make what we need. I've set a couple books with extensively modified open source fonts that got in he book show -- they are not all bad. This, coupled with Adobe's policy, and the smaller studios that allow modifications, will allow any needed work to get done.

Now as I said, it is a small market, and probably its needs are not something any of you need to take into consideration for your livelihoods. Your only issue is whether or not there may be enough other such markets.

* * *

BTW, over 50% of the work I do when "modifying" fonts is to work on the kerning. Again, to work in the font is a convenience, not a necessity.

From my perspective "no modifications" is an attempt to stop piracy (which I abhor) that will backfire.

Just a clarification on this. The Georgia/Verdana Pro projects were a joint effort by Font Bureau and Ascender, with the blessings of Microsoft. And in fact, all of the Georgia expansion was done by the Ascender team, led by Steve Matteson. 

I believe that Microsoft still owns the rights and retains some control over both families.

I don’t think that FB can grant permission for modifications to Georgia unilaterally — and Ascender has since been absorbed by Monotype Imaging. So getting official permission for mods could be a sticky wicket.

Also, the “Pro” designation was Ascender’s initiative. FB doesn’t use this designation itself. 

The Georgia/Verdana Pro fonts cover the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/WGL4.htm">WGL4 character set</a> (a Microsoft standard, basically), which purports to be “Pan-European,” but this obviously does not extend to more specialized linguistic needs.</div>

It's a morass out there. Pun intended. I sense, perhaps erroneously, opportunities for the smaller foundries/publishers. And hedging bets, will keep pushing for people in the academic community to join in the open source community, esp. for the texts where "normal" fonts don't have glyph coverage.</div>
