  body: You could also have bumped your [[http://typophile.com/node/108254|previous
    request]]... Anyway, nothing new since my last failed attempt. Have you even try
    contacting the designer in charge of this job?

  body: "Note that the O and the bowls in letters like P are squared circles in the
    shape of a super-ellipse a.k.a hyper-elipse*. This was first used for fonts, AFAIK
    by Hermann Zapf for Melior in 1952. You can add to Ryuk's list in the previous
    post, another font by Hermann Zapf, Zapf Elliptical 711 http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/zapf-elliptical-711/\r\nEssentially
    the same as Melior (Adobe/Linotype) , URW Latino, and Marseille Serial (Softmaker).\r\n\r\n*
    for the mathematically inclined here is the wiki on the geometric figure known
    as a super-elipse http://en.wikipedia.org\r\naLSO http://www.2dcurves.com/power/powerse.html/wiki/Superellipse\r\nDon"

  body: "Adding some speculation. I suspect this is not a font as such but the results
    of work by a logo designer who applied super-ellipse design principles to another
    font. Check for a fairly high contrast heavy weight font with terminals that match
    the S. Or the designer could have done the logo from scratch.\r\nDon"
