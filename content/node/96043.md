  body: "I think you may want to contact fonts.com for this. The issues with Chinese
    and Japanese webfonts is that you don't want the user to have to download the
    entire font before seeing anything. I believe that monotype uses subsetting technology
    to avoid this issue.\r\n\r\nJason C"

  body: Sourceforge.jp has a few font projects that I think you can use as webfonts
    or, preferably, offer for download and install -- a full Japanese font can easily
    weigh eight megabytes.

  body: "There are several webfonts services in Japan for Japanese fonts but they
    all operate in a similar way, they either provide fonts with a limited subset
    of say 3,000\u20136,000 glyphs or they want to analyze individual webpages and
    generate a subsetted font based on the contents of those pages.\r\n\r\nI think
    you probably want to ask \"why?\" a little more to figure out why this is needed
    because the solutions aren't necessarily simple."
