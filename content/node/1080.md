body: I realize this sample is too awkward to get a true sense of value, but, generally
  speaking is this typeface just too f&#39;d up to be of any use?  Anyone see any
  value here? <BR> <BR>I originally intended it to be a text face but obviously that
  won&#39;t work. Maybe a cheesy display face? <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1498.jpg"

  body: ' I think this would be a really funny display face. I  <BR>wouldn&#39;t suggest
    trying to sell it, but for your own  <BR>uses, this would be great. the forms
    would really  <BR>become images of their if you used them in the right  <BR>way
    -- and, of course, for the right subject. <BR> <BR>since this would not be a font
    to use for the purpose of <BR>legibility, you might want to funk-up the &#34;straight&#34;  <BR>characters
    &#40;Uc H, I, L, T &amp; Lc i, l, x, z&#41;. I&#39;m not sure how  <BR>these would
    look, but currently they look too boring in  <BR>the context of this font. <BR>
    <BR>great link, Joe! '
