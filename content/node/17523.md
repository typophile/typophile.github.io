  to know what typeface this is. I have been told incorrectly that it is 'parasine'
  but it is not! \r\n\r\n    The type face is used most frequently in HOW Magazine.
  I would like to know where to get a copy of the typeface and what it is called,
  etc, etc.\r\n\r\n   Thank you for your help."

  body: I don't remember off the top of my head, but I do recall that there's a full-blown
    article about the redesign in the February or April 2005 issue, and it discusses
    that font.It could be a proprietary design or a limited-time license, but I kind
    of doubt it.

  body: "Just so you're aware, in my opinion there are better fonts in that vein:
    <a href=\"http://www.fountain.nu/catalogue/lisboa.asp\">Lisboa</a> or <a href=\"http://www.emigre.com/EFoIVisS.php\">Vista
    Sans</a>.\r\n\r\nParisine always looks a little awkward to me."

    an experimental magazine as a senior design project here at The Ringling School.
    Any advice on type faces? \r\n\r\nI will need a Display, Body and also a few tertiary
    faces....\r\n\r\n~ Rusty"
