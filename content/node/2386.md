  body: or you could loosen them up &#40;space them out&#41; a bit more. i can see
    this as a logo... but more importantly or rather in addition &#40;?&#41; i can
    see it on something like a t-shirt as well. <BR> <BR>the most interesting bit
    is that you cut these drawings in rubylith. <B>that</B> is the coolest part.

    type of work do you do and for how long have you beed doing it. Since you like
    the rubylith part you could properly appreciate that I did the who sign language
    in ruby. I was going to make digitize it for a full font out of it but never got
    it finished. '

  body: ' Tiffany, if you have fond memories of rubylith, you would probably enjoy
    listening to Dave Farey tell stories of cutting rubys for Letraset. That&#39;s
    how he cut his teeth, so to speak, in type. I think he used to give demonstrations
    at ATypI conferences. If I&#39;m not mistaken, there was a plan to have him do
    a rubylith-cutting demo at this summer&#39;s TypeCon in Toronto, but at the last
    minute they couldn&#39;t get his scalpels  through airport security. &#40;We use
    off-the-rack X-actos here in the States, but Dave uses his own custom, hand-crafted
    blades.&#41; <BR> <BR>-- K. '

    <BR>Hey, at CDG they wanted to confiscate my 2-year-old&#39;s kiddie fork. But
    when I demonstrated that my &#42;keys&#42; were more dangerous they let us keep

  body: ' Ole &amp; Kent -- Let&#39;s just say that I remember having to show my spot
    color with rubylith &#40;and amberlith&#41;. I grew up around the business and
    so it is a very nostalgic thing. But, seriously, you really had to have, still
    have to have, total control over your knife when using rubylith, especially if
    you don&#39;t want to cut the shapes off the backing material. -- Dave Farey&#39;s
    demo would be a nice thing to see, similar I would imagine, to seeing someone
    doing the one-two jerk of throwing metal type. Let&#39;s here for the craftsmen! '

  body: ' i like that you have used sign language to visualize your logo... but isn&#39;t
    there any sign for the word &#34;unity&#34; itself?.. i&#39;m asking this, because
    for me a logotype should be something simple with a symbolic content to that thing
    it stands for... to me it&#39;s a little bit complicated... has it anything to
    do with people who are deaf?.. or is it just for the sake of &#34;wandering on
    new paths&#34;?.. '

  body: ' I can appreciate the individual hands and spelling out the letters in sign
    language...but this doesn&#39;t hold together as a logo. I would suggest that
    &#34;unity&#34; implies the combination of site and sound and there are enough
    interesting charicatures to use them graphically. an example the dot over the
    eye could be and eye, the u or the y could be changed into sound type shapes.
    <BR>but over all you want to have unity with site and sound. it goes hand in hand,
    eye to eye, and mouth to mouth. these are all important issues in comunication '
