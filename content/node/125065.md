  body: "Yes Hrant, but \"knows\" is a pretty straightforward word I can explain offline,
    or maybe I'll tweet a definition and point to here.:)\r\n\r\nIf the simplification
    of unicode use over the next 100-200 years comes down to Latin, Chinese, and a
    greatly  expanded Emoji, 64,000 individual variation axes for a universal font
    could be a challenge. All those companies wanting singing, dancing, color glyphs
    to speak to their customers in assured tones, could easily gobble up a 1000 axes
    per glyph \u2014 but I just don't Know that. \r\n\r\nI know \u2014 I don't want
    THAT to happen, preferring 999 flourishing, (figuratively in most cases), scripts,
    with solid support for all of them in education, design and across technologies.
    This begins in earnest, I believe, with Vars and their horizons, limitations,
    and the capabilities in between. PostScript, TrueType and Opentype set the table
    for making types for more styles and more scripts more economically and, at the
    very highest levels of quality. Vars in many ways, is offering a gigantic global
    \"undo\" of the metal type solutions the previous technologies followed too closely
    in some areas. \r\n\r\nSo no one knows of a type design or script, too complicated
    for 64,000 individual variation axes?\r\n\r\nThanks then. "

    culture needs it, but for the same reason Unicode went for emoji: people like
    to keep making money from what they've been doing.\r\n\r\nBTW anybody who thinks
    Knowing is straightforward needs some <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorgias#On_the_Non-Existent\">Gorgias</a>
    in their diet."
