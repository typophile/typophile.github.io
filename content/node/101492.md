  here I'm asking for your help to make my font project \r\nTweegi a reality. Tweegi
  is a super condensed fonts with two \r\nvariables regular and italic, it has a 600+
  character set, with regular \r\nand discretionary ligatures, alternate characters,
  complete set of \r\nnumbers, small caps and it covers 105 latin alphabets. The best
  of this \r\nis that if I can reach the funding goal, it will be free for everyone
  \r\nto use as they like. \r\n\r\nSo please check it out and help me spread the word,
  every help \r\nwill be appreciated. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.kickstarter.com/projects/...shionable-font"

    a little fuzzy on libre/free, but would not the fact that you have received external
    funding via Kickstarter essentially make it non-libre? A semantic loophole of
    sorts? I keep thinking \u201CIf you give me $100 now, I\u2019ll give you, or someone
    else, a free hat later.\u201D Technically it\u2019s not free as you are being
    financially compensated. It\u2019s just a question of timing. Sure, someone might
    get a free hat, but you still get paid. Am I missing something?"
