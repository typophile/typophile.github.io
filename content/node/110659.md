body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/46_4059.PNG]\r\n\r\nThe font displayed
  is from The History Channel's 101 Gadgets That Changed The World.\r\nThe 4 has a
  serif/cusp going off the top vertex and the 6 has a downward serif and a round (Not
  elliptical) center hole. I've seen fonts with the 6 in it but never anything remotely
  similar to the 4."
