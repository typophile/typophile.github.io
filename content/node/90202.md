  pdf attached. Lower part of deVremde_const.pdf for comparison with VDijck Serif.
  Some changes and the rest of UC letters."

    the fact that the kerning is way off there are not enough glyphs presented to
    give a fair impression."

  body: "I made 26 letters of yet, just to see whether the font is worth something
    or not.\r\nI think this one could be regular/text plus some ultra light to heavy
    for display purposes."

  body: Hmmm... It's not bad, but I think it's too clean to work with your serif.
    I think it needs a little more of that classic warmth. Right now it seems stuck
    between classic warmth and modern cleanliness, IMO.

  body: I like it. The lowercase g seems to be rotating counterclockwise.

  body: "Thank you both for the comments.\r\n\"g\" - I will reshape it a bit.\r\nAs
    for now it is an exact copy of my serif font with serifs removed. First, I want
    to finish all letters and then to think what to do next.\r\n   cheers"

  body: "I really like the serif. It is very harmonious/classic warm. So I want to
    see the sans-serif to be as good.\r\nThe \"trapeze\"  where the vertical weight
    goes from thick, to thin, to thick is interesting.\r\nPersonally on the /l/ &
    /h/ & /b/ & /d/ I find it creates a \"top heavy\" font, a little unbalanced for
    my taste.\r\nAlso, I miss the beautiful bowls of the serif /d/ & /b/ ... in this
    condensed sans-serif version.\r\nAdditional I would love to see a sans-serif where
    you keep the original's playfulness, like the /f/ ascender, and elegance like
    the /j/ descender. \r\n\r\nI see great potential in this sans-serif font, maybe
    you could keep more of the original's caracter."
