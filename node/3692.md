body: I&#39;m trying to find the font Gotham. All I know about it is that it&#39;s
  a Sans Serif, used by Pentagram Design, and is not the funky railroad font. Can
  anyone direct me to a website that carries it so I can view it?

  body: Now that my other browser window is open to it, I guess I should finally go
    ahead and get Gotham. Thanks a lot, Barbara -- you just cost me $200. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Get the condensed version as well. It grows on you. When I first licensed
    it I thought I had gone overboard. But, now I am hoping they release more weights
    for it too!

  body: Oops, too late! That&#39;s ok -- I have to buy another font today already
    anyway.
