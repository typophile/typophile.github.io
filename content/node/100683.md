  found on Linotype.  For example, given the typeface CRONOS, I'd like to be able
  to know if it is:\r\n\r\n(sans/slab) serif?\r\nmonospaced?\r\ndisplay?\r\nscript?\r\n\r\nI
  can certainly look at a font by hand and decide this for myself, but I was wondering
  for the program that I am writing, if there was a database or tool out there that
  determines this. I've looked at the Linux program `otfinfo` but it does not give
  any of this information.\r\n"
