body: I&#39;ve just started research, I have about 7 months. I&#39;d like to design
  a face, but am lacking in direction. Have no preconcieved notions on to what, sans,
  roman, script, modular etc... i would do. Need advice on how to go about establishing
  a NEED and FUNCTION. The design will be stronger, and I will feel better about it,
  as it was purposeful. Want to avoid post-rationalization.  To any experienced type
  designer, I implore your assistance... <BR> <BR>Thank you

    indeed hard. But that doesn&#39;t mean your goal has to be very niche. You could
    simply decide to make the best general-purpose sans you can for example - something
    that many people could use to set many kinds of &#40;not-too-long&#41; text. On
    the other hand, the narrower the goal the easier it is to be original &#40;while
    always maintaining a functional framework&#41;. Or you could start from a shape
    you like &#40;like a certain kind of arch or something&#41; and develop a whole
    font from it; although for me personally that&#39;s a superficial approach &#40;I
    know because I&#39;ve done it too&#41;, it&#39;s still possible to: arrive at
    a usable display face, if you can learn to be not too literal, and break your
    &#34;rules&#34; as needed; and gain a lot of practice in the mechanics. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: 'By no means am I experienced in anything, but I was recently in a similar
    situation for my senior thesis. I did a lot of research and reading and eventually
    ended up with an interesting, though very ridiculous &#40;and somewhat embarrassing&#41;
    idea for my project.  <BR> <BR>A good starting point would be to decide what type
    of project you would enjoy doing. Elliott Earls has a good essay in Emigre #65
    that helped me with this. He categorizes modern type design as falling into 3
    categories, &#34;historical revival, vernacular interpretation, or exclusively
    formal extrapolation.&#34; From that point it was pretty easy to come up with
    a clear brief and strategy.  <BR> <BR>I hope that helped. Good luck.'

  body: I recommend defining a brief of some kind, which will constrain your thinking
    about a project and present a direction. Typically, type design briefs are along
    the lines of &#39;a signage typeface&#39; or &#39;a text type for newspapers&#39;
    etc., and require both stylistic and technical response. <BR> <BR>Since this is
    a school project, I think you could set yourself something a little bit more interesting
    than these typical commercial briefs. Why not consider designing a typeface for
    a particular text, e.g. some book that interests you? This would force you to
    consider the material requirements of an edition &#40;at what size should it be
    set, do you need variants e.g. for subheads or footnotes, how do you envision
    it being printed&#41; and the stylistic suggestions of the text. Ideally in such
    a project, the stylistic considerations should avoid the obvious &#40;it&#39;s
    a Jane Austen novel so the typeface is a revival of an early 19th century face&#41;
    and reflect your response to the text, which might be affectionate if it is a
    book that you really like, but could also be ironic or subversive.
