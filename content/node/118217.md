  body: "A prolific 19th century type designer named  Hermann Ihlenburg may have been
    the originator of the style of using circular swirls to embellish a typeface,
    which was then sold as Houghton by ATF and later as Edison by Bauer and Berthold.
    See for example the revivals by Spiece Graphics as Edison Swirl http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/edison-swirl-sg/
    and by HiH as Edison http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hihretrofonts/edison/\r\nThe
    _P_ and _H_ in your image look like modified versions of the _P_ and _H_ in Houghton.\r\nDon"

    body: "Many thanks! just what i needed. You're correct the \"P\" and the letter
      \"H\" are modified. I needed the font because one of my customers uses this
      font for a logo, but they never had any core files of the logo when it was designed
      back in te days. \r\n\r\nSo this helps me a lot! thanks.  "

  body: "You can probably lift the swirls from various parts of Edison and paste them
    on a simple set of lettering that matches the other letters.\r\nBTW this is not
    the first swirl font. Earlier ones include John cummings Kismet from 1879 http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/kismet/\r\nDon"
