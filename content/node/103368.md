  body: "From the Canada Type info on Wagner Grotesk:\r\n\"This is the elaborate digital
    version of Edel Grotesque Bold Condensed (also known as Lessing, Reichgrotesk,
    and Wotan Bold Condensed) a 1914 typeface by Johannes Wagner, which was later
    adopted by pretty much every European type foundry, exported into the Americas,
    and used on war propaganda posters on either side of the Atlantic.\"\r\nYour wooden
    type is almost certainly Johannes Wagner's 1914 design. Presumably it is by an
    Italian foundry. I don't know whether they used one of the German names or created
    an Italian one. Take your pick for a name from the suggestions by CT and Ryuk
    or use an appropriate Italian term.\r\nDon\r\n "

    to a Condensed Akzidenz Grotesk and Burear Grotesque, yet the straight R is driving
    me crazy.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/specimenSTBLgrotweb_4763.jpg]"

  body: "Straight leg R might help eliminate 19th century designs.  I did not see
    any as wood type. But that is not to say they did not exist.\r\n\r\nBTW, numbers
    often sold separately in old fonts. This one seems to have integral numbers. Compare
    6&9 with b, d, g, q & p.\r\n\r\nLooks sort of Germanic, So you might try a careful
    review of fonts tagged <a href=\"\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/search/tag%3Agrotesk/fonts/\r\n\">\"grotesk\"
    at MyFonts</a>.\r\n\r\nA real challenge.\r\nAny suggestions to help earthache?\r\nDon"

  body: Suggestions, I'm afraid not. Thought I'd mention, though, that Hanseatic (BT's
    <a href='http://old.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/swiss-924/' target='_blank'>Swiss
    924</a>) was an 1890's Stempel typeface that shared those unique, sharper-than-usual
    "curved corners" on letters like a, b, d, etc. It also had a straight-legged R.
    Too condensed and lots of differences, though.

  body: "Good call Mike. \r\nI can see this woodtype as a descendent of the Stempel
    typeface. Leaving aside the degree of being condensed and other points, the lower
    case is bang-on for the unique a, b, d, g, q & p. Not unexpectedly Stemple's Hanseatic
    did not have harmonizing numbers. These seem to be a later addition by whomever
    did further work on the design. The woodtype R is consistent with a cleanup. The
    Woodtype Q would work as a solution of having none of the Capitals descend below
    the base line -- but this is just speculation on the difference. \r\n\r\nJaspert's
    description of Hanseatic, as sold by Linotype Frankfurt is \"A condensed lineale
    with short descenders.\"  Jaspert notes that \"lineales\" is the description applied
    by Maximillan Vox to types without serifs.\r\n\r\nKlingspor footnotes its listing
    of Hanseatic, designed at Linotype in 1964,  with the comment \"Aus der eng fetten
    [bold condensed] information entwickelt [developed] von A. Ritzel. \" Not clear
    if Rizel is for 1964 Linotype or Stempel 189o's.\r\n\r\nSo if we can't find out
    anything more about this wood type you might go with a label like Hanseatic Inspired
    Lineale.\r\n\r\nDon"

    close!\r\nThis confirms  Stemplel's 1890s Hanseatic as the origin of the design.\r\nDon"
