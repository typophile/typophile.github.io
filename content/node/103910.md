  that they want to sort out the library and importantly delete illegal fonts. The
  issue is they want to bring in a 'complete' library to use across all titles - the
  one being touted is the Adobe type library.\r\n\r\nAre there any better alternatives,
  and (assuming most people would be negative) is anyone in favour of this type of
  rationalisation?\r\n\r\nThoughts as always gratefully received\u2026"

    such comprehensive libraries tend to be strong on the classics but a bit stodgy.\r\nHowever,
    if you can \uFB01nd a match between your company\u2019s mission/style/whatever
    and that of a type supplier, it may help focus your direction.\r\n\r\nMonotype=Sauron?"

  body: "Well, my library of books consists of publications that cover interests of
    mine, or are entertaining or just beautiful in their own way \u2014 strangely
    enough they are from a multitude of publishers\u2026\r\n\r\nYour type library
    should be similar, and as it is, having only the Adobe Type Library is like having
    only Penguin books: not bad at all, but somewhat restricted.\r\n\r\nWhy not ask
    for a quote for licensing the ATL for your situation and then use amount of money
    as a budget and gradually build an interesting and useful collection?\r\n\r\nFYI:
    amongst my last purchases were typefaces and type families from Village (Klim),
    Typotheque, House Industries and other small foundries. "

    are moving to this. Think their problem -- freelance designers, contract typesetters
    and (different) contract printers, not to mention different products -- ink on
    paper books, eboks in both pdf and ePUB formats, etc.\r\n\r\nKeeping track of
    who has a legal font would be daunting. Even worse is paying for it all, esp.
    from some of the major European font publishers. The possibility of revenue from
    the Web, I guess, has set up pricing strategies for font use that book publishers
    just won't pay. Kind of like medical care in America. This is their first step,
    a limited library & maybe a contract price for that library. No doubt more to
    come.\r\n\r\nI wish we could pay, say $300 for a font and own (not license) it,
    just like the old days. But then, the cost of fonts limited choices then, too..."

  body: Despite having many Adobe fonts, I use fonts from other foundries much more.
    I think their fonts are sometimes limited, especially when they have licensed
    them from other companies and are selling outdated versions.

    $300* only payed for fonts that could be used at one location in the old days.
    Lead is physical, right. You couldn\u2019t copy the font and distribute it to
    everyone in the firm. The same amount gives you roughly the same value today.
    \r\n\r\nHow web and app licensing today are handled by type publishers differs
    wildly. Give it some time, and we\u2019ll probably figure out a good solution.
    A license that covers both desktop, app and web might be a good idea. In fact,
    OurType does this very thing.\r\n\r\n* I suspect it was a lot more back then,
    though \u2026"

  body: "Frode, just how old do you think I am ;-) the $300 (or so) was for a couple
    (roman & italic) photocomp fonts. \r\n\r\nMetal would have been much more, esp.
    for bookwork. With metal, you need at least three text sizes (for text, extracts
    & footnotes), at least roman & italic & maybe some bolds, probably a display size
    or two for chapter openings -- the costs quickly get up there.\r\n\r\nIn the days
    of metal, you just didn't buy a new \"font\" for any bookwork. I'd imagine unless
    the account was quite large, you didn't for advertising, either. You picked a
    printer who <strong>already owned</strong> & didn't need to buy a font, and used
    handlettering.\r\n\r\nPostscript fonts at $35 or so was what made the small, independent
    font publisher viable. If you let the big guys (Monotype, etc.) dictate pricing
    policies, esp. for ebooks etc, you'll loose that market. Maybe you don't want
    it. And maybe nothing will help, the people in management want headaches to go
    away, that's why they're paid the big bucks. Aesthetics & designer pleas don't
    count.\r\n\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\nIsleofGrough: If you're a freelance designer, the decisions
    of who you're working for will affect your font choices."
