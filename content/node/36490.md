  body: "My feeling is that this is actually a customization of Blackmoor. This is
    the only font that has some of these characteristic simplified Lombardic-inspired
    letters, especially this T. The H looks like two lines joining two I's; the E
    and S seem like Blackmoor simplifications. The A and N are the most modified,
    and to me look similar to some of the letterforms in Aquitaine Initials, another
    Letraset font.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"
