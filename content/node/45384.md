  body: "Dear AGL:\r\n\r\nThank you for bookmarking my blog, I post about once a week.\r\n\r\nWell,
    I can not say with any degree of honesty that this was fun, but, it was satisfying.
    \ The two LSU graphic design students working with me were great, it was more
    like an old fashioned sewing bee than anything else. \r\n\r\nThe process was very
    interesting,; after a full academic year of intense thought, research and teaching,
    it was very rewarding to be making something again.  The tiny stacks of finished
    pieces were a delight to see.  But fun, well, not exactly fun.\r\n\r\nThe booklets
    are beautiful and ship, on time, tomorrow.  I will post the final shots (below).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/05_3456.15.08.4.typo.jpg]"

  body: "Yes, with ribbons and all. I guess I know what you mean that it is not 'fun';
    bindery work is tedious. But I am sure you are proud of it. I guess each stack
    has fifty of them ... ? - Awesome.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: "dear andr\xE9,\r\n\r\neach stack has 40 except the final which has 45.  it
    is a lovely way to work for four days but i was thoroughly exhausted when we were
    through.  i think the pressure of attempting perfection is what gets to you (me.)"
