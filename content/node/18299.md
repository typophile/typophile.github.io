  the font from http://cunliffethompson.com/font\r\n\r\nThe first four items are Mike
  Hebrew, Regular, Bold, Italic and Bold Italic.\r\nThe last item is Mike Hebrew Web.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font_family_v2.gif]\r\n\r\nThe
  demands of readibility especially at small font sizes were leading\r\nme away from
  my original design concept. In V2, these demands are\r\nsatisfied with Mike Hebrew
  web which may be used for reading email and looking at Isreali web pages. It is
  more square than the Mike Hebrew family and so my be used\r\nat a smaller size.
  Adding Mike Hebrew Web has enabled me to avoid compromises with the\r\nother members
  of the family.\r\n\r\nI would be particularly interest in views from Israelis on
  the use of Mike Hebrew Web.\r\n\r\n"

    the \u05D4.\r\n\r\napart from that an interesting typeface. How do you envision
    it being used?"

    body: "Raphael,\r\n\r\nThanks for you comment. I have now increased the gap in
      the Heh.\r\n\r\nI imagine the font would be used for decorative effect in small
      doses.\r\n\r\nHowever, I have the Mike Hebrew Web as my default font in a browser\r\nand
      in response to this experience I am going to add \r\nMike Hebrew Web Bold in
      the next release. The online newspapers\r\nHaAretz and Ynet require a bold.\r\n\r\nMike\r\nhttp://www.cunliffethompson.com/font"
