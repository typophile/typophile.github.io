  body: I spent an hour while we were watching television flipping through the Font
    Book starting at A, to reach the same conclusion &#40;I knew that &#39;t&#39;
    looked familiar&#41;. If I had started at Z, I might have gotten there sooner,
    but when I ran upstairs and saw your post, I said a bad word and went back to
    the TV. &#40;I thought Utopia Bold with some widening.&#41;  Good job, Mark.
