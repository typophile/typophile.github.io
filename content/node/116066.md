  had a feeling it might be Helvetica Rounded Condensed. But the O simply doesn't
  look right, the W is off too. Same goes for Anchor. Any other ideas, input?\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any help!\r\n\r\nC."

    helps identifying the font better.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/turf_2_5133.jpg]\r\nI
    haven't a found a font yet having an O in that shape and provoding a similiar
    R. \r\n\r\nThanks for any help!\r\nC."
