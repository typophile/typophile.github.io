  I have a question that I would like to ask. :)\r\n\r\nI am working on a property
  /  land release job and I am looking for a friendly and contemporary sans-serif
  face, perhaps with a hint of personality. NOT GOTHAM! But something in the same
  vein, perhaps something new that you have seen and would love to see used more.\r\n\r\nSuggestions
  welcome!\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nEmma"

  body: The benefits of hiring a web design company are insurmountable. The professionals
    help in time saving as well as the reduction of cost spent in development. In
    addition to that, the service providers will help achieve superb results with
    every aspect considered. However, it is important to understand that not every
    web designing company can be relied on. Some firms are out to enrich themselves
    at the expense of the desperate clients. This is why a person is advised to look
    at a number of aspects before hiring a design company.

    enough swagg-er of its own to set it apart from the crowd\u2026"

  body: "You know, I was forced to license Omnes Pro for an ongoing project.\r\n\r\nIt's
    friendly, yes, but probably looks too much like a pampers advert for what you
    need.\r\n\r\nThe main reason I bring this up: at first, I wasn't entirely pleased
    to have to use it as I'm a bit tired of rounded fonts. However, I have become
    a fan -- with all its weights, stylistic sets, numbers that come enclosed in circles
    (massive, massive, timesaver), arrows of all sorts.\r\n\r\nI'm quite surprised
    to find that it is the best font I have ever used.\r\n\r\nIt probably doesn't
    work for your project, and I don't mean to hijack your thread, but Omnes has helped
    me re-evaluate how I'll choose fonts for projects, especially if they involve
    a lot of typesetting and information display/design.\r\n"
