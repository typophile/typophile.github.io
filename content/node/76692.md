body: "Talented Austrian designer Wolfgang Homola brings us Soleil, an innovative
  and fresh geometric sans serif that stands out among its peers. While Soleil's letter
  shapes take advantage of concepts behind mathematics and geometrical construction
  to inspire their appearance, it is its careful design process and attention to legibility
  that provides fluidity and cohesiveness to the typeface. Soleil promises great performance
  in a wide range of applications, from wayfinding to editorial design.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Soleil_sneak_5776.jpg]"
