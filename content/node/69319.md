  body: Assuming there are no differences, you should copy the glyphs from one case
    to the other using references. Few things are more annoying to a user than seeing
    a bunch of spaces or boxes when typing characters that are easily accessed by
    the keyboard. That's the only technical thing with unicase that I can think of.
    Maybe there's a special Panose setting or something like that; I haven't looked
    into it.

  body: "@cutteflesh, your tip is good, but dears guys, there're still two problems:\r\n1)
    How do I increase the lowercase letters a, e, m and n to the same uppercase letter's
    width and thickness?\r\n2) How do I decrease these lowercase letters' width and
    thickness to the same witdh and thickness of uppercase letters?"

  body: "You are trying to modify an existing font to create a unicase font, then?\r\n\r\nDo
    you have a font that you are free to modify, either because it's your own creation,
    or because the licence permits it? Then again, if you're already experienced in
    designing letters, you don't need much help in designing unicase...\r\n\r\nThe
    easiest would be starting off with a multi-weight font family so you can match
    lighter lowercase letters with heavier uppercase letters when scaled to the same
    height. You may need to generate intermediate weights for this. Not all fonts
    will permit this type of modification in their licence but it may be fine if you
    don't need to generate a font but just use some letters for a logo."

  body: "@Jongseong. \r\n\r\n1) I'm trying.\r\n2) I've a font \u2014 Sansation which
    is totally free to modfiy (but only for my personal uses and I can't distribute,
    as the creator of this font told), but I also want to modify Arial and Verdana
    for my personal uses, because they are easier and legible to be seen and better
    and please persons' visions, but I don't know if they're allowed to be modified.
    \r\n3) Do u mean I copy a lowercase letter from a light font to the regular font's?
    I think I understood u, maybe u had told I might match the light with regular,
    the regular bold with medium, medium bold with black, blacv bold with semi-black
    or extra-black. Am I right? But Verdana doesn't have light, black, semi-black
    and extra-black weights..."

  body: Fontlab Studio should have a blend option so you can quickly interpolate intermediate
    weights between a regular and a bold. Paste the same glyph of a different weight
    in the background layer and fiddle with the blend amount. Then scale to see if
    you've matched the stem widths. The result may need some cleaning up, but it might
    be good enough for personal use. There is even a 'blend fonts' option, I think,
    which is even simpler. There are more sophisticated ways to interpolate, but they
    may be difficult to set up. I am not aware of ways to interpolate in FontCreator,
    but maybe others can prove me wrong.

  body: Sansation is plenty readable and is in my opinion a better choice than either
    Arial or Verdana. In addition, it has three weights; Sansation's regular lowercase
    scaled to match the bold uppercase will need much less adjustment than the same
    thing with Verdana regular and bold (the only two weights available for now; Verdana's
    bold is almost a black). I would stick with Sansation and not bother with Arial
    or Verdana.
