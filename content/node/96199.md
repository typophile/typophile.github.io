  body: "Already solved in another thread posted by same person.\r\n\r\nThe design
    of this board -- which encourages people to post in the solved section, and when
    they don't get any response, encourages them to post again and again in hopes
    of having their post noticed -- is multiplying human labor on several fronts.\r\n\r\nIt's
    not the fault of the people who post, obviously. It's the product of a faulty
    design, which \"teaches\" people (visually) to post in the top section.\r\n\r\nIs
    there any way to simply MOVE the entire top of the main board (Type ID FAQ, Type
    ID Pop Quiz, Solved IDs) to the BOTTOM of the page? \r\n\r\nAnd increase the size
    of \"Post new forum topic\"?\r\n\r\nThat would put the meat and potatoes -- asking
    the questions -- front and center, and make it tough to post in the wrong place.\r\n\r\nThat
    would solve 95 percent of the misposting, I'd reckon."
