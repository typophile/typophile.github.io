We're putting together an identity for a public figure, and he was born in 1949, and it would be a nice touch. I was hoping one of Zapfs faces would have come out then, or at least been started during '49, but it looks like a dead period between palatinio and optima.

Preferably a sans, but I'll take a look at anything right now..</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Any edition of <em>An A-Z of Type Designers</em> is a good resource for this... Following the name of each type designer is a list of his or her typefaces, followed by the year(s) of development or release.

On page 58 of the latest edition: Trade Gothic, 1948-60 (Jackson Burke)
On page 59: Normandia, 1946-9 (Alessandro Butti, with Aldo Novarese)
On page 74: Diethelm-Antiqua, 1948-50 (Walter J. Diethelm)
On page 76: Electra, 1935-49 (William Addison Dwiggins)
On page 101: Emergo, 1948-53 (Sem L. Hartz)

Ah, check this out, on page 111: Savoie, 1949 (Marcel Jacno)

The book has 200 pages, I'm sure there's some more typefaces to be found! :-)

Another good resource might be Sebastian Carter's <em>Twentieth Century Type Designers</em>.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Many factories (Monotype UK, D. Stempel AG Germany, etc.) were converted over to war industry production for a time. Many older type designers stayed in their posts during the war. Younger ones, like Zapf, were drafted, although his lettering skills lead to his being assigned to a cartography office in occupied France. Some other designers were not as lucky; Klingspor's Rudo Spemann died in action. And Vojtěch Preissig was interned in the concentration camp at Dachau, where he died.

By 1949, many English and German foundries (select foundries in both countries were bombed) seem to have back in business, at least that is what their period promotional materials seem to suggest.</div>
