body: Kia Ora. I have been approached by a foundry specialising <BR>in non-ferrous
  casting. They sell numerals and letters cast <BR>up to 300mm tall and are looking
  for a spot of custom work. <BR>Mostly for house names and numbers. <BR> <BR>Has
  anyone had any experience in designing for this sort <BR>of thing or know of any
  other companies that do this? Know <BR>of any problems specific to this method?

  body: Pepeha, I have done this with the clay.  <BR>I wanna do more in the future
    and face a more 3D letter-object. <BR>For this I used the facilities of an Art
    Academy. <BR>Best, <BR>AS <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/40593.jpg"
