  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hey everyone.</p>
<p>Well, I just finished my first term at Art Center on Friday. Man, it was pretty grueling, they work the crap out of you.</p>
<p>I took Type 1 from Leah Hoffmitz who is an excellent type and logo designer. She does a lot of freelance work for Landor in San Francisco, and she drew both the FedEx and Banana Republic logo.</p>
<p>Anyway, we spent a good 4 or 5 weeks working on 2 logotypes; 1 corporate, 1 retail (or just smaller company). Just to let you know, these were not originally done on the computer by manipulating a typeface, they were both sketched and painted on tabloid paper in Plaka before more revisions, and then digitization. My corporate logo is for Nikon (camera company), the second is for a hat and clothing company called Brixton.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had about 4 weeks of feedback from my teacher, so I was just curious to hear what some of you guys had to say about the logotypes. Thanks!</p>
<p>Josh</p>

<p>hmmm, interesting. Maybe my eyeballs are betraying me, but the k-o is indeed too tight.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/Nikon_4622.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>as far as Brixton, it seems to have a few issues:</p>
<p>• the triangular mass on the t feels too heavy.</p>
<p>• the x feels upside down (low-waisted)</p>
<p>• hard to tell at low rez, but I think your overshoots might be a little exaggerated? can&rsquo;t tell for sure.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>thanks for the input back, i appreciate everything you said Beejay.</p>
<p>To clarify about the FedEx logo, she did not come up with the concept and design, she drew the logo, and has flat files full of sketches and drawings to prove. Funny though how she was mentioned at the beginning of that link as being &ldquo;typography professor leah hoffmitz&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I like what you did with the t, but I am unsure about whether or not I like the x the original or flipped way. Maybe i have just been looking at it too much lately.</p>
<p>Overall though, I feel like I did an okay job for my first term type 1 class. It was really awesome drawing and painting type from scratch. We also painted 3 &ldquo;Hamburge&quot;s in different styles, which really helped how I look at type.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>apologies if my post implied that Leah had not contributed to the Fed Ex logo. But saying she &lsquo;drew&rsquo; the Fed Ex logo probably wasn&rsquo;t accurate either.</p>
<p>out of curiosity, I emailed Lindon Leader and he was kind enough to reply so&hellip;</p>
<p>Leah Hoffmitz' contribution will now be burnished into the record.</p>
<p>Leader:</p>
<p><cite>Once I had the general concept of the logo conceived, including the hidden
arrow, I engaged Leah&ndash;one of the best type designers anywhere&ndash;to advise on
the reconstruction of the letterforms to best accommodate the arrow, which
she did admirably. However, because I had asked Leah to work with Futura
Bold, I was still not satisfied with the distinctively smaller Futura
x-height, the very tall ascender of the lower-case &ldquo;d&rdquo;  or the relatively
even Futura strokes. It was then that I decided to explore the possibility
of marrying Futura Bold with Univers 65. The result is what you see today.
Leah is indeed to be credited with an important contribution to the success
of the FedEx identity program.</cite></p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Yeah, the ko is too tight. And the stuff about sand between the letters is a helpful idea, but can&rsquo;t be taken too seriously either. If you try it with very well kerned type, you will see that it&rsquo;s not really true. It does need to be visually even in color, but nobody has a complete formula, though some out there are pretty good.</p>
<p>When you have difficulty spacing something, I think it is often a problem with the letters themselves. I suspect your o or k may be too wide compared to the n, and that is giving you problems.</p>
<p>For me the black letter with the wood-cut look characters don&rsquo;t work together.</p>

<p>As you pointed out yourself: it&rsquo;s not geometry and calculation. It&rsquo;s visual balance. And Beejay&rsquo;s version is balanced. Pixel too wide or not, it&rsquo;s better.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not commenting on Brixton because my mind today is not at its best for such sophisticated lettering.</p>

<p>stare at the word without intentionally focusing on any one letter or its surrounding white space (kind of like what you do with those old magic eye posters). keep adjusting until no one letter comes to focus (if the word isn&rsquo;t kerned well, the offending letter will often come to focus no matter how hard you try not to focus on it.</p>
