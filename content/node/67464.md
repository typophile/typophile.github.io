  body: "There are two fonts there. Notice the two U's, A's and E's.\r\n\r\nI've searched
    Comicraft fonts and neither of these comes from them, as far as I can see. Also
    searched Abstract Fonts site, and no luck there. Can't open Dafont.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately
    there are lots of Comic fonts. Maybe you can get a close one to work?\r\n\r\n-

  body: "You might look at [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/jya/comic-pro-jy/|Comic
    Pro]] from Jack Yan Assoc. It's quite similar to the second sample.\r\n\r\nI checked
    Blambot earlier, and they had serifs on most I's in the comic fonts I saw.\r\n\r\nThought
    maybe Harold Lohner's [[http://www.haroldsfonts.com/frontpage.html|Zitz]] was
    close to first sample.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
