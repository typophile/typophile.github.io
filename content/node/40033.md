  of the company is web design & graphic design. The company has only two members
  and they are the 2 brothers. They`r goal is to attract large and important clients
  so i thought that something simple, stable and powerful would do the trick. Do you
  agree? If not, any better ideas? :D\r\n\r\nP.S. i had real trouble coming up with
  an icon illustrating two brothers. Can anyone help with this, too?   Thanks a lot

  body: "I didn't even notice the \"brothers\" in the logo at first. It's much too
    understated in comparison to \"marosi\". I'd either remove it or make it more
    prominent.\r\n\r\nThe use of \"image\" as a verb is very unusual. Did you do this
    on purpose?\r\n\r\nThe typeface choice doesn't say simple, stable, and powerful
    to me. It says hair salon from the 1980s. Don't take my advice as gospel, but
    I'd change the typeface to something a little tamer like Avenir.\r\n\r\nThe burgundy
    and grey colour scheme is nice (although those were my high school's colours,
    so I'm a bit biased). I'd keep it.\r\n\r\nYou might want to think a little more
    abstractly in the case of an icon. Maybe instead of representing \"two brothers\",
    you should simply think about representing \"two\".\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    this firm wants to attract large and important clients, convince them to drop
    the \u201Cbrothers\u201D from the name. It just doesn\u2019t work for for a design
    firm.\r\n\r\nI like the look, but only if the word \u201Cbrothers\u201D goes and
    the rule slides right in under \u201Cmarosi\u201D. \r\n\r\n"

    I see. \r\n\r\nAlso agree with Lex that the typeface is off message. Maybe try
    something a little less ornate, a little more corporate."

    the 'brothers' suffix doesn't really fit in. They're not an auto shop or deli.\r\n\r\nNot
    sure you really need the tagline, either."

  body: "The Bauhaus font you're using looks retro, and the burgundy color reinforeces
    that effect. I recommend a contemporary rendition of Bauhaus with present-day
    chic---<a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sentinel/amity/\" target=\"_new\">Amity</a>.\r\n\r\nThis
    logo will be effective without the tagline, but if the client really wants a tagline
    try to steer them away from \"we image you\". That's a bit lame and self-conscious.
    I've come up with an alternative, \"image by design\", but I bet somebody else
    is already using it.\r\n\r\nAlso recommend using a more contemporary color. Some
