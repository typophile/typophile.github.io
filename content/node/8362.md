body: So I am setting a logotype for a new client of mine and I just happened to stumble
  accross the typeface, Melior, by chance. Unlike other annoying mistakes I make on
  the fly, this was an instance where i enjoyed the structure and relationship of
  the letters.  <BR> <BR>Unfortunately, if you are familiar with it, Melior does not
  have a nice wide range of weights and alternate characters. <BR> <BR>So my mission
  here is to find a soul out there with a much wider, dare I say &#34;geekery&#34;
  of type knowledge to help me select a similar face with an equal amount if not more
  beauty than that of Melior. Any takers? <BR> <BR>--&#62;thanks

  body: a quick search on Myfonts gave me <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/latino/"
    target="_blank"> URW Latino</a> which looks fairly similar to my eye. &#40;I didn&#39;t
    take a hard look at it&#41; and it has a more extensive range of weights and it
    looks like international characters.

    Next&#34; or &#34;Melior Nova&#34;.

  body: I believe that the received wisdom on logos is that it is best in anycase
    to draw variations on the letters to suit that particular logo. So if you are
    going to draw anyway, having the basic model should be enough, no? <BR> <BR>Doyald
    Young&#39;s <a href="http://delphipress.com" target="_blank">Fonts and Logos</a>
    contains many brilliant examples of such variations &amp; creations inspired by
    existing typefaces. He always uses pencil first, but you could also draw in a
    computer program, and get a good result.

  body: Zapf Book and Zapf International, which offer more weights,  might be seen
    as evolutions of Melior, though the former is more chiseled. Zapf&#39;s own favorite
    designs are Palatino, Optima and Melior.  <BR> <BR>Slimbach&#39;s Utopia and Kepler
    also remind me of Melior in some ways.

    Nova family will start to release soon. <BR> <BR>Marwan, try <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/antiqua/"

  body: Bravo&#39;s &#34;Queer Eye for the Straight Guy&#34; uses Melior for its logo.
    It hasn&#39;t looked that good in years. The metal version was always a winner.
    Photo and digital versions less so.
