  to Soto for the link. However, there&#39;s not much here to snicker at because the
  customer was &#34;ecstatic&#34; with the redesign.&#41; <BR> <BR>bj

  body: ' I would be too. Eurostile is actually getting a new freshness, while Optima
    still looks like a 50-year-old with more plastic surgery than real parts. And
    she&#39;s not too good with computers anyway. <BR> <BR>hhp '

    &#40;Canadian&#41;...and I&#39;m certainly feeling all shiny and new. I love Eurostile '

    everywhere, and was only conceived 50 years ago as an update on microgamma. long

  body: I think Eurostile was in fact dated until recently, but now with all the nostalgia
    it works again. <BR> <BR>Ole is talking about The Foundry, an outfit in the UK
    which is very good at reincarnating classics. <BR><A HREF="http://www.thefoundrystudio.co.uk/"

  body: ' The fact that something is everywhere makes it more bland by definition,
    less unique and in my opinion less functional for the purpose of expert  branding.
    One aspect of branding where this is critical is in the area of developing a unique
    visual identity, that differentiates the branded company from it&#39;s competitors.
    This can well be enhanced by designing unique a corporate typeface. Since this
    is not in the budget of many redesigns, or not offered as a solution, the next
    best thing is to choose a typeface that is legible, not overused &#40;as in the
    case of eurostyle, Times Roman or Helvetica for that matter&#41;, and embodies
    the values the company embraces typographically. Is eurostyle displeasing to the
    eye. No it is in fact a very nice design, the same goes for Helvetica and Gill
    <BR>as well as Novarese. In my opinion you fail to do your best when you do not
    explore such options. For all the Monolines out there, there are 100&#39;s of
    similar designs that do not measure up cosmetically, technically or functionality
    wise. <BR>I do not expect everybody to be an expert at matching type for projects
    but then again this is typophile and this is about critique. '

  body: ' good argument, I agree. but swaping Eurostile for Monoline just because
    its new and hip would seem rather pointless. To the public its identical. <BR>
    <BR>I think we were reffereing to Novarese the designer not the font. '
