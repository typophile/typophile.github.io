  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I've got a long business document to format. It contains many acronyms. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The source text, which I received in Microsoft Word format, uses full caps for all the acronyms. I think small caps would be better, but am encountering the following problems: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* Some of the acronyms are pluralised. For example, Local Authoritity is abbreviated to LA, but the text often refers to more than one and uses the term LAs. When I set this in small caps, it looks like LAS, which is no good. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* Acronyms will occasionally start a sentence. To me, starting a sentence in small caps looks wrong. But using a full cap for the initial, followed by small caps, looks weird too. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ideas? I did try a search and Bringhurst, but there's no satisfactory conclusion. Some mention was given of faces with two different small cap heights, to overcome this problem (I think Mrs Eaves was cited). Can anyone show me what this looks like?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; When I set this in small caps, it looks like LAS, which is no good. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Which is why smallcaps are best when they're visibly taller than the lc x-height. Unfortunately most fonts have smallcaps that are too short. BTW, many people put an apostrophe when pluralizing an acronym, but I think that's a sad fallback. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As for the initial-acronym situation, I certainly wouldn't &quot;capitalize&quot; it! You might just use full-caps there, especially if your font has smallish smallcaps. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BTW, the richest font I know in terms of smallcaps is FF Atma: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/atma-serif/">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/atma-serif/</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And it's decently spaced. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I always thought that small caps were supposed to be level with the x-height. The only reason why they recently have not, was because people used shrunken caps and if they did it at the x-height then it would be way to thin. Of course doing it at 70% also thins it out but isn't as bad as doing it at the x-height.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I usually make my small caps larger than x-height, more so if the x-height is small. There is a lot of historical precedent for this, Rafael.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But I don't think there is a formula. Goudy even made the SC of Italian Oldstyle smaller than the LC x-height (what a show-off), and it looked OK. So that's worth examining, and it confirms that a glyph contains a sense of scale.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Italian Old Style (the metal version) has very small counters in the bowls of the a and e, and is very tightly fitted. If you compare the counters in the SC &quot;E&quot; with that in the &quot;e&quot;, they are of a similar size. And the SC is openly fitted (ie it looks &quot;tracked out&quot;). So the LC looks like a bigger &quot;optical size&quot; setting than it really is, and the SC look like a very small optical size setting of a cap. Hence they work together. (This beforesaid concerns the sense of scale of proportion for letter stem lengths and negative space; detailing such as stem and serif thicknesses is more about consistency of absolute values between SC and LC.)  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, if a typeface has small caps that look too small when they are set beside the lower case, they are not well designed. If a typographer is going to tinker with the setting to compensate for this, I would suggest combining three imperceptible adjustments:  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1) increase the SC size by a fraction of a point, such as 0.2. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2) increase the tracking of the small caps, possibly by quite a lot. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3) increase the horizontal scaling of the SC by a couple of percentage points.This is a technique that digital type designers often use when they are developing their small caps from the big uns, but you might decide a little more is required. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There is not necessarily anything wrong with a typeface if you feel it is necessary to do this; it may be that some typefaces require a little more effort to work with than others of more easy virtue, or that typefaces not naturally suited to the requirements of a typographer or a project require some special treatment. Massaging a reluctant typeface to the requirements of a project can often result in more distinguished work than going with the most obvious or most comfortable choice. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->By way of a test to determine how thorough a typeface design really is, set the three &quot;O&quot;s (cap, sc, and lc) and the two zeros (lining and oldstyle) beside each other and compare how differentiated they are with how well they harmonize.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Raphael, it seems you're talking about &quot;optimal&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->fake<!-- raw HTML omitted --> caps, while the main issue here deals with fonts which have smallcaps provided&hellip; But come to think of it, Nick's idea of doing some &quot;fake&quot; stuff with the true smallcaps might be just the thing!  :-) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nick, I think larger apparent size certainly helps, but it's not enough - sort of how an upright italic doesn't work for emphasis: cursiveness usually helps, but alone it's too weak. Consider the &quot;LAs&quot; example: the lc &quot;s&quot; being a bit narrower than the SC one would not resolve the confusion. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">No, I was meaning real small caps. I was saying that according to my understanding people have got used to small caps being larger than the x-height because people used fake small caps and that fake small caps were larger than they &quot;should be&quot; because to make them the &quot;correct&quot; size would make them too thin. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Of course it was always my understanding that true small caps were supposed to be x-height without really thinking about why I thought that.

		<div class="commentbody">&lt;font class=&quot;dontLookLikeCrap&quot;&gt;I just finished typesetting a 180 pg academic text in Adobe Caslon (the new-ish pro OTF version). Tremendous number of acronyms, and, unfortunately, many in quoted text, which had to be set in italics. The font lacks an italic SC so I had to use 16-degree-obliqued smallcaps, slightly fudged to match the weight of the italic - you don't want to know what I had to do. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I love this face but the small-cap height is too low and the plural acronym problem came up again and again. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Unfortunately FF Atma would likely cost me several dozen hours' worth of wages and I just can't afford the investment now, so I end up with another, perhaps finer (that is, finer than, say, &quot;fake&quot; smallcaps), but still less-than perfect way of kludging it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The other face I'd really like to be using for book work is Mark van Bronkhorst's wonderful Verdigris family, but it doesn't yet have all the features I need it to.</div>
