body: "As always, I should preface this by mentioning I'm blundering my way through
  this learning process and thus will likely sound like an idiot in my attempts to
  explain my current query.\r\n\r\nI've been given the opportunity to take a close
  look at a pre-release version of an upcoming font (let's call it PRERELEASE) and
  one of the tasks still to be done is re-ordering the glyph index order. What I've
  gathered is that the glyph index order designates the order glyphs are listed in
  InDesign's glyph palette (I'm sure index numbers serve other purposes as well, so
  I suppose that's part of my query here).\r\n\r\nWhat I began to be curious about
  was how to set up pop-up menus in InDesign's glyph palette; that is, to set up the
  small arrow in the bottom-right corner so that when you mouse-over the glyph a menu
  pops up with the alternates for that glyph. I had assumed there was some sort of
  code in the font file that set up this function, but I couldn't find anything of
  the sort. However, in beginning to re-order the font, suddenly those pop-ups began
  to appear when I loaded the font in InDesign.\r\n\r\nAs I haven't been able to find
  a standard index list, I simply selected another OpenType Pro font in InDesign and,
  based on its listing in the glyph palette, began reordering the PRERELEASE font.
  Many (most) of the expected pop-ups are appearing in InDesign's glyph palette, but
  not all of them.\r\n\r\nFor instance, mousing-over lowercase e pops up a menu with
  e, smallcap e, superscript e and scientific inferior e, which is great. However,
  the PRERELEASE font has over 10 alternate ampersands, and half a dozen alternate
  Qs, yet only the small cap versions of each of these is showing up in the pop-up
  menu. What I'm wondering, then, is where should I place the alternate ampersands
  and Qs, etc.?\r\n\r\nI should mention that I've only re-ordered about 200 of the
  near 2000 glyphs in the font, but I thought I'd post this query now rather than
  get too far ahead of myself.\r\n\r\nIf this makes any sense at all to anyone, I'd
  appreciate any insight you might have to offer.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance...\r\n\r\n"

    glyphs in the font file. That's the order the glyphs are displayed in InDesign's
    glyph palette.\r\n\r\nOrdering has no effect at all on what alternates are shown
    for a given glyph. This is instead controlled by OpenType layout features. The
    'aalt' feature in particular fives \"all alternates\" of a given glyph. I'm not
    sure if InDesign will also show alternates that are not in 'aalt' - perhaps.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Hi Thomas,\r\n\r\nMy query was based primarily on the fact that the only
    change I've made to the font is to re-order some of the glyphs in the Index codepage.
    In doing so, the pop-up menus in InDesign's glyph palette have changed.\r\n\r\nFor
    the most part, these alt pop-ups have appeared (small cap variants pop up for
    all basic uppercasae glyphs; small cap, superscript, scientific inferiors pop-up
    for each basic lowercase glyph, etc.), but in a few cases, those alt pop-ups have
    disappeared. I do understand that it is the OpenType features that enable the
    pop-ups, but I'm trying to understand how the glyph index order impacts these
    pop-ups, because clearly that order does have some effect. I say this simply because
    in re-ordering some of the glyphs in the font I'm working with, those pop-ups
    changed in InDesign. Specifically, the ampersand's pop-up menu in InDesign changed
    from including all 12 alt glyphs to suddenly only displaying the standard and
    smallcap variant, the 10 alt variants have disappeared from the pop-up.\r\n\r\nI'll
    keep tinkering and see if I can discover the mystery here, but if anyone has any
    input, please join in."

  body: "As expected, there was indeed more to the disappearing features than simply
    re-ordering glyphs (as Thomas suggested). It seems that in opening the font in
    FontLab some of the features were being stripped out, and I had to re-write them
    for the features to show up in the re-generated OTF file. All is well now and
    I've learned a fair bit in the process. Lots of fun.\r\n\r\nOne question though:
    why, when I try to add a new glyph class to the list (eg: \"@class17 = [thisglyph
    thatglyph]\"), do I get nothing but errors on re-compiling the features? That
    question is probably way too vague, but perhaps someone will know what I'm getting
    at."
