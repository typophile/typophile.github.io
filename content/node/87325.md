  well-known, although i doubt so as i searched the net trying to find the fonts that
  WSJ uses. besides for this really helpful post (which still did not say the fonts
  used in body) - http://typophile.com/node/179 - nothing really helped. \r\n\r\nanyways

    had another look at the PDF, I note a couple of minor errors concerning myself
    and Shinntype:\r\n1. I was not an \"independent\" type designer, but had been
    publishing solely through the Shinntype foundry since 1999.\r\n2. Shinntype did
    not specialize in custom fonts, which have always been a smaller part of its business
    than fonts developed primarily for the retail market.\r\nAnd that's still true."
