  Family]]. \r\n\r\nCan anyone suggest a set of 3 or 4 typefaces that would provie
  the sort of classic-yet-21st century look and feel that these have? I particularly
  like the geometric feel of the sans and slab, and how the serif compliments it without
  being radically different.\r\n\r\nI am very eager to hear any thoughts."
