body: "I'm setting up a personal blog of a friend, and helping her with the basic
  layout and design. Now I'm looking for a webfont \u2013 ideally available through
  one of the free webfont services until size dictates otherwise, the free versions
  Fonts.com, Typekit or Google Webfonts \u2013 that suits her style and personality.\r\n\r\nShe's
  queer, out, proud and quite apart from traditional notions of femininity, yet with
  a strong spiritual side (think fire-and-brimstone inspirational preacher, but not
  necessarily christian), which will be the focus of the blog. (A preliminary title
  includes the concept of lay preacher confession.) So what I've been trying to find
  is a good style that manages to be both forceful and passionately warm, something
  that's humanist to an extent but veers away from softness, tradition and scriptiness.
  We looked through some libraries and she sort of liked old-fashioned American headline
  gothics, but I think something a bit more understated and more contemporary might
  be better. An angular serif, Swift-style, perhaps? Or something bridging humanist
  type and forceful headline sanses?\r\n\r\nSuggestions?"

    time however it seems to be a perfect fit.\r\nhttp://ernestinefont.com/\r\n\r\nAnother
    good one here is Avance, which also has a hybrid personality suitable to this
    context.\r\nhttps://www.fontfont.com/fonts/avance\r\nBut I don't know how good
    its screen rendering is.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
