  feeling with a more humanistic approach.\r\nAt the moment I'm only sketching lowercase,
  trying to figure out where it's  possible to go with this.\r\n\r\n"

    is a rare thing.\r\n\r\nI think the tail end of /j/ stands out too much and wants
    thinning."

    you go with the \"n\" is a little bit different from what you have with the round
    shapes, like the \"b\" \"p\". [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Tip_4174.png]"

  body: "Nice, other thing.\r\nMaybe you should take a look at the way your \"s\"
    and \"k\" are going.\r\nThe top curves should be a bit smaller than the bottom.
    I think, and the k, you should try to equalize the countershapes. I 've made a
    sketch for you.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks. This is a great project. Good luck![img:sites/default/files/old-images/teste_5962.png]"
