body: Hello,  <BR> <BR>I meant to bring in an eye magazine to scan in an example but
  surely one of you have one close by and can help me. <BR>Basically what font do
  they use for the body text in the main articles. I know at the back under typography
  they mention Proforma and Egyptian, I can account for the other fonts mentioned
  but am mixed up between egyptian and proforma because there seems to be a few different
  kinds of egyptian available &#40;505, OL&#41;. <BR> <BR>Basically to make things
  simple my question is where do they use Proforma &#40;is it in the main articles
  text?&#41; and where do they use Egyptian. <BR> <BR>Thanks alot, <BR> <BR>David.

  body: I think they use Proforma Medium for most of their text &#40;see below&#41;.
    I don&#39;t have a magazine in front of me, but I thought they used <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=Clarendon"
    target="_blank">Clarendon</a> for headers, but it&#39;s in the Egyptian vein &#40;They
    tend to be blocky and bold, here is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/egyptian/"
    target="_blank">one</a> from E&amp;F&#41;. You should be able to distinguish the
    two quite easily.  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/55964.jpg"
