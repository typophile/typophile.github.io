body: Hi, <BR> <BR>Just wondering what peoples thoughts are on these 2 versions, and
  which they think is better? <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve compared them and the main difference
  seems to be that the weights of the Frutiger Next version are slightly lighter than
  the Frutiger version, as well as the addition of a medium weight, true italics and
  a different ampersand &#40;looks the same as the univers ampersand&#41;. <BR> <BR>thanks
  <BR>iota.
