    that's not it. What's your sample origin? That might be bespoke...

  body: Hi, definitely not bespoke. It is all over a printed document I have. Not
    sure on origin

  body: "Could you share more (letters, related brand, poster...)? Anything could
    help.\r\nBTW, I checked all fonts I've encountered with and sorted in the same
    category (DIN Black/Heavy possibly monospaced) and it came up to nothing."

  body: "Just because it\u2019s \u201Call over\u201D a printed document doesn\u2019t
    preclude it from being bespoke.\r\n\r\nTo echo Ryuk, we\u2019d need more information
    to pinpoint a source."
