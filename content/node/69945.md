body: "I was at the Montreal exhibit of Louis C. Tiffany this past weekend, and noticed
  a very interesting (hand lettered) 'R' glyph on one of his sketches. The pencil
  lettering that he used to label the sketch had a great deco feel, and for the most
  part was beautifully precise- but one 'R' was rushed. Unfortunately, no picture
  were allowed, so I'll have to show what I noticed with my own quick reproduction:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TIffanyR_3716.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  first 'R' to show what most of the font was like, then a version of the rushed 'R'.\r\nSuddenly,
  it looks like the cursive 'r'!"
