  format newspaper that uses serif typefaces for its headlines (Centennial).\r\nI
  have only used san serif fonts for headlines in the past.\r\nAre there any tips
  or tricks that I need to know when putting together page designs with serif headlines,
  or is it simply a case that the standard rules used for headlines (san serif or
  otherwise) will continue to serve me just as well?\r\nCheers all in advance for
  your help.\r\n"

    of record.
