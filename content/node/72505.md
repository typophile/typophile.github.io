body: "Some of you might have already seen that I posted a topic 'Expletus-Sans' in
  the sans-serif rubric. These are the first 'sketches' for Expletus-Text. I haven't
  taken care of the spacing and kerning yet. If you like this typeface I hope you
  can also have a look at my Expletus-Sans post and tell me what you think.\r\n\r\nJasper

  body: I love the warmth and playfulness about it, but it's really hard to judge
    letters like this. Some of the naturally quirky ones (g, r, s, t, z) may or may
    not be amazing in text/display setting. Can you upload a PDF with some real-life
    examples?

  body: "I\u2019m also curious to how those notches actually work in at text size,
    in print. \r\n\r\nFor starters: You can add a lot more weight to that r, btw.
    The eye of g is too heavy and I\u2019m not sure about the top right part of z
    (mirror it somewhere else perhaps?). That a needs some work."

  body: "The reason why I haven't uploaded any 'real-life' samples is because I think
    the spacing needs quite some more work. With expletus-sans I found it much easier
    to do the spacing and (partially) kerning. I guess serif typefaces need more kerning
    pairs?\r\n\r\nI'm not sure about the z either. I'll have to see what that looks
    like at 8 - 12 pts. The eye of the g is indeed to dark, I'll change that. The
    a looks fine to me. I'll just soften the inner curve of the bowl a little in a.
    \r\n\r\nFrom what I know of Expletus Sans, the 'notches, will probably close off.\r\n\r\nthanks
    for your input!"

  body: "Expletus is interesting. Your \"cut\" curves seems to have a better design
    here than in sans version. Proportions also are very good. I second Frode's observations
    and also thing g second bowl must be a bit shorter at right.\r\n\r\nKerning is
    usually the last step on font development. To do tests while you don't have kerning,
    set your text in InDesign with optical kerning enabled. This usually produces
    good results for tests and shows possible issues with spacig.\r\n\r\nMaybe z angles
    could benefit from the same curve you adopted in v and w bases."

  body: "The sans and serif 'cut' curves are exactly the same, but Expletus Sans shows
    the bold and semi-bold two, which have less space for the 'cut'. I think the g
    is fine, but maybe a view at 9pts will change my mind. I'll leave the kerning.
    I was already beginning to see it was quite useless, but the 'optical kerning'
    function in Indesign is just not as good as manual kerning. I guess I'll have
    to live with it. I don't think your idea in the z will work, but I'll try it anyway.\r\n\r\nI'm
    going on a holliday for 17 days, so I will upoad a pdf with text samples shortly
    afterwards, since I don't think I will be able to do that today.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for your input. It's really helpfull."

  body: My post was not clear as it must. I was referring to curves in the bolder
    sans. And I don't say you to replace real kerning to InDesign's one. I was talking
    about a tool to be used during development time. Of course, in a posterior moment
    you will need to kern the font. But before this the ID optical kerning helps to
    get a feel.

    the 's' is to dark, but thanks a lot for your enthousiasm!
