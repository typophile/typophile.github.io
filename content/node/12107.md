  f\xFCr Gestaltung Offenbach am Main.\r\n\r\nIn Offenbach am Main, Germany. Right
  near Frankfurt. A state-run art university that teaches fine art, advertising, product
  design, set design, graphic design, and a bit of typography, amoung some other things.
  Between 600 and 700 students total. The professor for typography is [[Friedrich
  Friedl]].\r\n\r\n[[Klaus Hesse]] has been the professor for conceptional design
  since 199. His work (including his professional work at [[Hesse Design]]) is very
  typographic.\r\n\r\nType design has not been part of the curriculum officially since
  1979. Many type designers have taught at the school, however. For instance, from
  1947\u20131979, [[Karlgeorg Hoefer]] taught calligraphy and type design there.\r\n\r\nThe
  school's website is <a href=\"http://www.hfg-offenbach.de\">http://www.hfg-offenbach.de</a>\r\n\r\nIn
  2004, several students came together to form a type design collective, [[TypeOff]]
  as several attempts to reintroduce it officially back into the curriculum were thwarted.
