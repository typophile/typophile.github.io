  of this restaurant I noticed while walking around SF.  Put it through identifont
  and whatthefont but didn't come up with anything very close.

  body: It is a rather fetching typeface; however, it may simply be an invention of
    whoever fabricate the sign (from metal?), based on generic Art Deco lettering.
    Or not...

    be able to call the actual sign maker and find out pending how old the sign is. '

  body: Like Nick alludes, most of these <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stewf/sets/72157603592705592/">mid-century
    architectural letters</a> were either custom made by the builder/architect, or
    prefabricated, but not based on a printer's font.

  body: Ok thanks for the tips guys - next time I'm around there I'll check to see
    if there are any logos/markings.  It looked pretty recently installed.
