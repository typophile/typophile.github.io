  is an orange gel adhered to clear acetate. It was used as a way to [[knock out]]
  or separate areas of camera ready art for different color or screen treatments.
  The orange film was cut and stripped away with a knife or [[swivel knife]]. The
  orange was clear enough to be seen through for cutting purposes but opaque to light
  from the lithographic film it was exposed to. "
