    comes reasonably close too. But the original is way yummy, I agree. It&#39;s a
    perfect mirror image without looking contrived.

  body: ' This just in from Karl @ dezap: <BR> <BR>&#34;Hi Yves, <BR> <BR>Thank you
    for your e-mail. <BR> <BR>I have spoken with the designer who created the site
    and the fonts used are fonts that he has designed himself, so are not commercially
    available. He seems reluctant to allow anyone else to access his fonts as he can
    sometimes spend weeks developing them for specific projects. <BR> <BR>Thanks again,
    <BR> <BR>Karl&#34; <BR> <BR>Sometimes it helps to just ask... ;&#41; '

    you win absolutely nothing... sorry. <BR> <BR>Peter, I really don&#39;t think
    this face is Beta Sans. Check their <A HREF="http://www.dezap.com/"> website</A>
    where you&#39;ll be able to see much more characters. <BR> <BR>P.S. These special
    FX formatting codes on Typophile are way kewl. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll get tired
    of them pretty soon...

  body: 'Just to wrap up this thread, some words by the creator himself &#40;he didn&#39;t
    make it in time before shutdown&#41;: <BR> <BR>Yves <BR> <BR>I have been forwarded
    your email messages from Karl. Thank you very much for the kind remarks about
    the dezap typeface, which I simply call &#39;dezap&#39;. <BR> <BR>There are currently
    just 3 different weights &#40;light, regular, bold&#41;. The one used for the
    logotype is the &#39;regular&#39; weight and the rest of the website uses the
    &#39;light&#39; weight. <BR> <BR>I created the 5 original d-e-z-a-p characters
    as a standalone logotype to enable the logo to be reversible through 180 degrees,
    and then it eventually evolved into a full family which is now used across the
    company branding. <BR> <BR>Certainly, the simplicity of Hans Reichel&#39;s &#39;Dax&#39;
    typeface was something I had in mind when designing this font, but I hope &#39;dezap&#39;
    can be evaluated on its own merits. <BR> <BR>On a small side note, the photograph
    that has been posted on the Typophile forum is from our website. It is of a sign
    that hangs on the studio wall. I would usually insist that the logotype reads
    from top to bottom &#40;or bottom to top&#41;, rather that left to right. The
    viewer then has to tilt their head and physically &#39;interact&#39; with the
    logo in order to read it <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
