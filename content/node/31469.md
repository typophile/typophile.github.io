body: What is the best way tos et up cantillation and vowel markings for Hebrew?  Is
  it as simple as setting them up as if they were diacriticals from Latin/Greek/IPA/et
  al, or is there a different set up?  Most of the Hebrew fonts I have on my computer
  when I open them up in FontForge don't appear to actually have any of this set up,
  except for in a few presentation forms as per the Unicode spec.

  body: "I do not know easy way to lay out Hebrew marks. Even simple Hebrew font requires
    some contextual positioning, depending on other marks present. Windows system
    UI fonts require around 15 separate lookups for mark positioing. John Hudson's
    SBL Hebrew contains around 50 lookups taking care of mark positioning, not counting
    contextual mark substitutions.\r\n\r\nSergey"

      all possible positionings on all letters?  I figure at this point I can use
      the diacritical construction for most and then for those that require special
      positining use rligs instead.  \r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea tan

    body: "TITUS Cyberbit, Lucida Grande, Corsiva, New Peninim, Raanana.  TITUS Cyberbit
      especially seems to have a number of pre-combined outside of the normal range,
      which I assumed meant they had irregular placement.  For example, Lamed+Holam
      results in a placement to the left of the top stroke.  But Lamed+Qadma goes
      above the letter and to the right of the top stroke.  So, at least, a relatively
      simple top/bottom diacritic system like Latin script (sans Vietnamese) uses
      can't be used.  Some of the fonts (I forget which ones offhand) seemed to have
      negative width marks (for both cantaillian and niqqud), I guess to facilitate
      placement though I'm not sure how that is effective in handling all the placements.
      \ It could simply be that FontForge doesn't import the diacritic points placement
      information, in which case I'm still not sure the the most efficient way to
      go about accurately setting all combinations.  \r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es
