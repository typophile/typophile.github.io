  by the broken antiqua signage in the old Berlin subway stations. Backstein is German
  for \"[baked] brick\".\r\n\r\nThe idea of a squarish gemetric font is hardly original,
  but I hope I brought in some fresh air with those rather unconventional letter forms
  (especially the {r} and {s}).\r\n\r\nHere's a PDF specimen: http://www.cinga.ch/type/backstein_specimen.pdf

  body: "Hi J\xFCrgen,\r\n\r\nthose forms don't strike me as particularly German.
    The script-style {r} and {s} are internationally widespread in hand-writing (though
    actually I learned a more Antiqua-like {r} in school in Switzerland), and {e}
    is pretty close to the Antiqua shape anyway. \r\n\r\nOr do you mean the letters
    are generally not very legible and depend on context to be read properly? I'm
    deliberately pushing the boundaries of legibility a bit here in favor of a fresher
    look. It's certainly not meant for body copy.\r\n\r\nI do feel the {s} is not
    quite finished yet. I'm thinking of cutting off the spur to the top right to clear
    up that join a bit \u2014 let's see if it's still legible then (or maybe even
    more so?).\r\n\r\nGru\xDF"

  body: "To me they\u2019re legible in German because of the context. But, generally
    i think they\u2019re too similar, even for display.\r\nI like the {s} though.
    But not the cap S. Make it narrower. T longer on both sides of the top. And make
    {I} just a stroke.\r\n\r\nGr\xFC\xDFe."

  body: "@ J\xFCrgen: I agree on the {S}, not so much on the {T}. I like the fact
    that the current {T} needs no kerning other than with punctuation. I made a simple-stroke
    {I} as a stylistic alternate (.ss02). The .ss01 now houses a few alternate caps
    that eschew descenders.\r\n\r\n@ Hrant: I'm not sure a font that was made on a
    weekend deserves a \"full crit\". It's made from rough wood, and ain't no polish
    gonna make it sparkle.  ;o) But do tell me if you see anything stick out sideways,
    especially in terms of color or kerning.\r\n\r\nI don't know the first thing about
    Hebrew, so I'm wary to dabble in it. I've been thinking about a Greek and/or Cyrillic,
    though. And different weights... but most likely I'm going to publish a single
    Latin weight first, see whether people like it, and then decide whether or not
    to put that kind of effort into it.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The {s} gives the impression of a smallcap J at times (\"jorgenfrei\") so
    I agree that it needs rethinking.\r\nThe terminal of {L} is uncomfortably deep
    and invites second-guessing (b? V?) I think it would read more easily if it were
    shortened some.\r\nOtherwise, I think you've made strong choices overall. Maybe
    get more creative with {$} to go with the classy os figures."

  body: Well, I'm about to finish up a range of lighter weights for Backstein, at
    which occasion I'll also update the Regular weight on MyFonts. So if you have
    a few changes to suggest, that would be a good opportunity to sneak them in.  ;o)

    be making a very dark one, and you show it, I'll look out for missing/insufficient
