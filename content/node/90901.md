  (<a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/88181\">introductory thread</a>). Would anyone
  mind giving some input here?\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://21326.info/fontclod/mockup-b.png\"
  />\r\n\r\nI decided to go with a more \"minimal\" styling which I thinks work better
  for most webapps. I also decided to go with a more traditional menu structure because
  of the nature of a font editor. Both the tool palette and palettes on the right
  are quite WIP. I haven't decided on a default set of tools or palettes yet. The
  glyph chooser at the bottom will be expandable, and be subset with filters.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
  thoughts on this mock up would be highly appreciated. :)\r\n\r\nBrian"

    be superficial.\r\n- Alegraya Black looks like a drop down menu. I don\u2019t
    think it would be a good idea placing it right below other menus.\r\n- Bottom
    left icons aren\u2019t very clear.\r\n- I suppose Brian is the user. I think it
    would be better to separate as much as possible the service interface from the
    work one.\r\n- That \xDF looks wide\u2026 ops, this isn\u2019t pertinent, sorry
    ;-)"

    ones (i.e. just Z for undo, etc.).
