  been looking everywhere for it.\r\nI am mainly looking for the font that spells
  'Danny Diablo'. However, the 'Est 1985' font looks nice too and if anyone knew that
  font name I would be happy as well :)\r\nImage: http://dribbble.com/system/users/20254/screenshots/457034/dannydiablo_v3-3.png?1330963421\r\nThank
