  body: Love it, Graham. Haven't heard of Pluto. A film font? Is there a better way
    to handle the dots? The double circle doesn't seem to work as well as the rest.

  body: "Stephen, Pluto Outline is another version of Letrasets Lucifer No.1, \r\nSee
    thread - http://www.typophile.com/node/80417\r\n\r\nYes, there's a lot of peculiar
    things about the original version, and thats how the full stop and comma's are
    actually portrayed. I have an idea to make them a little more inline with the
    other characters so they don't seem just two circles.\r\n\r\nThe lower case in
    the original image are peculiar, with some design faults that make them really
    poor for text. The letters 's' and 'e' for example. While I am drawing the lower
    case, I don't think I will be including them in the finished thing, maybe make
    it a just a all cap version with the  hollow outline, shaded from the left, and
    shaded from the right.\r\n\r\nMost of the other attempts to make this have been
    a straight line trace from original image. I have just been drawing these by eye,
    meaning I look at the image, guess the dimentions, and draw it from the memory.
    Thats why its an interpretation, not a copy. Its not exact.\r\n"
