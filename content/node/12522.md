  perhaps I let the extreme contrast of a Didot influence me, then over compensated.
  I need a fresh perspective on this. Also, sorry about the name, I suck at naming
  fonts. Feel free to offer an alternative.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n-Noah"

  body: "Having the e be a rotation of the a (or vice versa) is a neat idea that is
    totally not working here. \"hamburgefons\" is an eyesore as a result. I think,
    at the very least, the counters need to be larger in order for those letterforms
    to work. The top of the Q feels sawn off rather than flattened. The figures are
    ungainly. They either need to be smoothed out or made more geometric; they're
    lumpy now. I like the g, m, and w. Is the x supposed to be leaning to the right?\r\n\r\nRight
    now it feels more like [[Eurostile]], [[Microgramma]], or [[Bank Gothic]] more
    than a [[didone]], mostly because the curves of the bowls and lobes undercuts
    the contrast in the strokes. It also feels a little like [[Peignot]], with the
    unusual variations in heights and letterforms. I think what it really needs is
    to have a coat of consistency slapped over it, and then see what direction you
    want to take it. It's not boring, but it has no idea what it wants to be when
    it grows up."

    as being in need of work? You say a coat of consistency, which forms do you think
    I should take as the model to bring the rest of the face in line with? Rather

  body: Interesting font. I have some comments. The a and e would be to work again.
    They do not seem to be a part of the same family. I also suggest of worked again
    the letter B. I believe that you do not have to cut the top and not use a broken
    straight line in the center. Good work

  body: I'd try smoothing all contours a little bit because all irregular shapes tend
    to catch the eye too much for a comfortable reading. Proportions in general seem
    ok but the geometric origin seems way too evident to me. Good luck! Lowercase
    "a" and "e" need to be checked, as well as lowercase 3, 5, 6 and 8.

    body: Concerning your three a, I will keep the number 1. I would use the number
      3,  in the italic. I believe that the curve of the top should be less curved.

  body: just so you know, the problem people had with the pdf was the fact that you
    had 2 fullstops before the file type "kisbefeSans..pdf" rather than "kisbefeSans.pdf".
    an easy fix would be for whoever downloaded it to simply delete the 2nd fullstop
    but many windows users don't realise this.
