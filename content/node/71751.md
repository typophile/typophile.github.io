  created with image files. Need to identity the font used in these images? Anybody
  have any ideas? Adobe Garamond small caps seems close... But I'm not sure.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nJon\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jewelry_o_5517.gif]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/painting_o_5022.gif]\r\n\r\n"

  body: You probably ought to use Strong Anti-Aliasing on the new buttons, because
    these are verging on illegible. The P tells me that you're probably correct about
    Adobe Garamond...
