  and we're supposed to give a list of priorities on places we'd like to go be exchange
  students next year, for a single semester (fall or spring).\r\n\r\nThere's quite
  a wide list of options, but I'm thinking either New York or Netherlands as my top
  priorities... I was wondering if anyone has any recommendations for any specific
  schools that are known for their typography/type design/calligraphy courses, not
  necessarily in the countries I've mentioned, since the choice is very wide... Thanks."

    Design 743a, Type Design. Type design is distinct from \u201Clettering\u201D in
    that it necessarily calls for a systematic approach, not just a concern for individual
    forms. The course focuses on a clear, systematic procedure to building the design
    of a typeface, as well as the aesthetic issues presented by single letters. The
    class is taught with Fontographer, a type-design program for the Macintosh\xAE
    that allows designers to digitize letterforms on screen and turn them into usable
    PostScript Type One fonts. Fontographer\u2019s ability to output digitized characters
    at actual size on a laser printer brings a level of reality to the project that
    was not practicable by pre-computer methods. Students learn the software, together
    with the principles of designing and spacing type. Fully fledged type designers
    are not made in one term; the object is to \u201Cdemystify\u201D the subject and
    teach users of type an increased appreciation of it. Students work on individual
    projects, chosen in consultation with the instructors. Individual projects should
    be carefully chosen, so that the availability of the student\u2019s new font makes
    a real contribution and serves a clear purpose. With the problems of type design
    so deeply interconnected, a clearly defined project is necessary to establish
    solid criteria for subsequent work. The nature of the project determines the route
    each student takes in researching his or her design. If appropriate to the project,
    students spend time rendering letterforms by hand, investigating historical sources,
    or starting immediately in Fontographer. Tobias Frere-Jones and Matthew Carter.\r\n\r\nSounds
    like a dream course to me."
