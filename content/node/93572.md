body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Music_3705.png]\r\nI made a Futura-esk
  type family for Music Finland; MusEx and FIMIC merged (that's two organisations
  promotin Finnish music). I wanted to make a more rigid, sort of Italian modernistic
  version of Futura/Century Gothic, with some contextual alternates. How do you think
  I came off?"
