  body: 'Fashion fonts - what''s that? Also how do you define "free license?" You
    could argue that the freely licensed Microsoft Web Core Fonts are amongst the
    most widely used fonts on the planet. More recently the DejaVu (AKA Bitstream
    Prima or Bitstream Vera) fonts have found their way into many devices where the
    makers have wanted to avoid paying license fees. Gentium may have been used in
    a few places, but the lack of available styles has prevented serious commercial
    exploitation.  '

  body: "Fashion fonts are fonts which commercial fashion businesses use in all their
    marketing and communications.  For example, in their promotion literature such
    as on their websites, posters, leaflets, etc.  For some fashion businesses the
    font is incorporated into their logo such as Chanel or Calvin Klein. I would assume
    that Chanel and Calvin Klein have their fonts specially designed for them.  However
    are there any similar businesses who use free license fonts and if so what other
    free license fonts are there.\r\n\r\nI would define a commercial \"free license\"
    as the permission to use a particular font by a business without any restrictions
    at all.  But just as with software various conditions on use may exist.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "\"Free\" is a loaded term in English, having several meanings. It can mean
    something provided at no cost, something that can be used without limitation,
    or a number of other things. Seeing the terms \"free\" and \"commercial\" next
    to each other causes cognitive dissonance.\r\n\r\nWhat you're describing is what
    most would term a \"site\" license or in larger applications an \"enterprise\"
    license. Such a license allows a piece of software to be used at any device in
    a location or throughout an entire corporation (freely), respectively, without
    <em>additional</em> charge after the initial license is paid (not free). This
    may be time-limited, depending on the terms of the license.\r\n\r\nFonts specified
    for corporate identity integration are often bought on enterprise license terms
    (or at least they should be). \r\n\r\nSometimes there is an exclusivity agreement
    as part of an enterprise license, especially in the case of custom fonts."

  body: "Yep, site-license rights are typically very similar to those found in end-user
    license agreements - but with an unlimited or effectively unlimited number of
    users - limits may include not posting the font on a Web server, limited modification
    and embedding rights - just as you'd find in a typical EULA. Of course with enough
    money you can loosen some of these restrictions. The cost of custom type is often
    comparable to the cost of broad licenses to some fonts.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

    fashion businesses and what exactly are you researching?

    what license do they operate under.
