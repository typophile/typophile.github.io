    conference in Brighton to document the event. And I was wondering about your enquiry
    Hrant. I don't know whether these few photos of Jonathan Hoefler's were the before
    or the after. However, I thought the links below might be relevant to your enquiry.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/kongur/5878941620/\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/kongur/5878380991/\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/kongur/5878943666/"

  body: "Ay\u015Fe, thank you for taking all those photos!  :-)\r\n\r\nThat second
    one is awesome. The first one is curious, because it seems to show the \"intent\"
    on the left and the actual result on the right... but you can't get to the result
    from the outline on the left (you need to do what's shown in that second image).
    So basically I'm hoping to see the (bad) result of using what's on the left (that
    doesn't have traps). The point is to put the bad and the good side-by-side to
    tell people \"look how much the traps help\".\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "My pleasure Hrant! I am glad you found at least one photo working for your
    enquiry. \r\n\r\nI concentrated Jonathan's talk and inevitably missed some really
    interesting slides. He pointed out very well classifying the process of font design
    for each medium. Off the top of my head I remember him mentioning the print, newspaper,
    phone book and screen. And he ended up declaring that the all HF&J typefaces are
    %100 web ready. \r\n\r\nI can understand the modification \u2013 adding traps
    where ink and paper are major variants \u2013 will work like a magic. I don't
    know how we can get the slide of trap comparison but I agree it would have been
    very convincing to see them side-by-side."

    somewhere online more about Retina (it's not on the H&FJ website) \u2014 perhaps
    something to do with MOMA? \u2014 but haven't been able to retrace my steps unfortunately.
    If Ampersand doesn't publish soon we'll have to contact Jonathan directly!\r\n\r\n>%100\r\nInteresting,
    Ay\u015Fe, is that the Turkish convention for % to appear in front of the figure?"

    In Turkish we always put percent in front of the figures.

    under the umbrella term called ink traps. If Retina's creators can supply the
    image you seek, you'll be done, if not ?  And if you refamiliarize or perhaps
    even familiarize yourself with the context of Retina in the presentation JH is
    urged to publish, your rusability will be further informed, or not ?\r\n\r\n"

    visual \"clotting\" (at small sizes). Typically long and shallow.\r\n- Trap actual
    ink spread preventing rounded inside corners. Like in Retina (for print).\r\n-
    Keep <em>outside</em> corners sharp (which I call thorns). Common in the photo
    era.\r\n- Trap <em>emitted light</em> preventing inside corners from bloating.

    degree intersections, the ink, which is really applied in a miserly fashion, in
    a process running at really high speeds, will go somewhere :) it don't.\r\n\r\n
    In JHs presentation he seemed compelled to use a twilight zone blurring effect
    to simulate what does not happen. I did press tests of this for Poynter Agate,
    and not being one to put all kinds of shenanigans over clients to impress them
    with stuff that ain't a problem, I put my traps where they do help, in acute intersections,
    did grades that take care of the rest and poof, on to the next issue.\r\n\r\nThe
    theory being revived here is from completely different age, when Matt Carter made
    Bell Centennial, a bitmapped family of styles for a printing process completely
    unrelated to modern newspaper agate. \r\n\r\n None of this has much to do when
    headed for the web at all."
