body: "Hey Everybody,\r\nI made a truetype typeface including different kernig pairs.
  The kerning works fine in all programms of adobe but it doesnt seems to work in
  programms like motion 4 . The person i made it for however needs it to work in this
  programm, The strange thing is that i opened the typeface in open office, where
  also the kerning is not activated but it looks different from the result in motion
  4. There for exmple VA looks fine whereas AV doenst seem to be accessed, Is there
  a way to solve that problem for motion 4 ? or does it have to do with some setting
  i would need to change in fontlab, respectively did i miss a option to make the
  kerning work properly in other programms?\r\nWould be great if somebody could give
  me some input on this!\r\nThanks and a nice pre-christmas time!\r\nMaxell"

    any OpenType features!

  body: It seems to be the consensus that at least one other feature beside <strong>kern</strong>
    needs to be included to activate kerning reliably. <strong>liga</strong> and/or
    <strong>locl</strong> are likely candidates.

  body: that would be great if that works, the typeface doesnt really have ligatures
    but the uppercase and lowercase characters look the same, so would it be enough
    if i i just did something like  sub A by a?

  body: "Hey old nick, thank you or the liga info!  so i now i added an the liga feature
    and it works great in open office where the kerning was not correct before.\r\nBut
    still in this motion and also in a programm for webdesign the font doesnt work
    properly. What still confuses me is that it looks like the kerning pairs a partially
    acessed.  Still for example AV is not kerned there wheras VA seems to work perfect.
    this also applys for some other kerning combinations... any more ideas on this?
    am i missing something?"

    the ttf version...

    this also be the case for an opentype font?\r\n\r\nI'm having a similar problem
    with my opentype-flavored opentype font I'm trying to finish kerning. I don't
    have any other features in my font - just the kern feature, but I could add a
    liga if it would help to activate the kerning that isn't showing up when I load
    it into applications."
