  body: "According to MyFonts Optima was initially conceived as a competitor for Ludwig
    & Mayer\u2019s Colonia (couldn't find a picture).\r\n\r\nMyFont's More like this
    brought out some more names: URW Classico, Galathea, Laudatio, Alinea Incise,
    Albe Sans, Cotoris, etc., to name a few.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/optima/morelikethis.html\r\n\r\nOh,
    and I just rememberd working for Volvo in the early 1990's and them specifying
    Arrow as a headline font in ads. Could have been an Optima copy, though."
