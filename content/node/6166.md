  I made of the typeface in Photoshop. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve seen it used before,
  but I can&#39;t think of where. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/43129.jpg"
  alt="My photoshop mockup"> <BR> <BR>Again, those are not the actual letterforms,
  but ones I took from another typeface and manipulated to look this way. I think
  they&#39;re similar, though. <BR> <BR>As I recall, the raised/underlined look could
  be chosen by selecting capitals or perhaps an included &#34;alternate&#34; typeface.
  I have a recollection also that it included lots of special ligatures - for instance,
  in this sample, I might have had the option of putting the &#34;o&#34; in the space
  above the bottom bar of the &#34;L&#34;. <BR> <BR>Any leads? I&#39;m getting desperate.

    It has underlined alternates and also ligatures, but it&#39;s not geometric as
    your mock-up.

  body: That&#39;s a useful clue, and thank you, but you&#39;re right, it doesn&#39;t
    have quite the same effect as my mockup. <BR> <BR>I know I&#39;ve seen a more
    grotesque/geometric/art-deco-y font with this effect going on. I KNOW I have.
    <BR> <BR>Or did I dream it?

  body: I think you might be right about that. Typeface 6&amp;7 is a little off-geometric
    - it looks a little more hand-drawn that I was imagining - but it might be the
    same thing nevertheless. If anyone knows any starker renditions of this concept,
    though &#40;or any other renditions whatsoever&#41; I&#39;d love to hear it. <BR>
    <BR>Thanks. <BR> <BR>Andrew
