<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Before I start, a note to the operator of Typophile:
For the readers of Typophile, for a better understanding of the following, it would be advisable if the old thread
http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/ 4100
were accessible again. This thread, which started on June 3, 2004 with the header "Erik Spiekermann's statements re Berthold", began with Mr. Harvey Hunt's statement:
"We were disappointed, but not surprised, that Erik Spiekermann, a noted and respected type designer and author, would knowingly make false and misleading statements regarding Berthold in a public forum. ..."
**************************************************************
I made a PDF file (53 pages, 900 KB) of this old thread
of 3-June-2004. If you need this file, send me an email.
**************************************************************
Three months ago, at the beginning of 2006, I published a comprehensive German-language document about the self-declared legal successors to the former stock-holding corporation H. Berthold AG with special emphasis on three phoney outfits, namely Berthold Types Ltd., Berthold LLC, and Berthold Corp. All three share the same room in the same house in the same street in the same city, and all three have the same two "employers" and "employees", namely Mr. Harvey Hunt and his roommate Mrs. Melissa Hunt:
see http://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/berthold.pdf
I stated in this above document that since many years, the impostors Harvey and Melissa Hunt and also their lawyers promulgate the fraudulent statement "Berthold Types Limited is the legal successor to H. Berthold AG". Since the impostors Harvey and Melissa Hunt are known to have instituted innumerable frivolous lawsuits, I expected that the impostors Harvey and Melissa Hunt would also file a frivolous lawsuit against me. Therefore, already in December 2005, I sent a letter to the German lawyers of the impostors Harvey and Melissa Hunt, namely to the lawfirm Schwabe, Sandmair, Marx, Teipel et al. and requested these lawyers to cease to promulgate the fraudulent statement that Berthold Types Limited is the legal successor to H. Berthold AG. As expected, the lawyers threatened to institute legal actions against me. So, in my above document, I published an unsigned affidavit containing the lawyers' declaration "Berthold Types Limited is the legal successor to H. Berthold AG" to be signed by the lawyers Schwabe, Sandmair, Marx, Teipel et al. Since German lawyers, who sign a false affidavit, are punished with up to three years of imprisonment, the lawyers Schwabe, Sandmair, Marx, Teipel et al. and also the impostors Harvey and Melissa Hunt panicked. Nobody in the font industry (Adobe, Linotype, Monotype, etc.) ever dared to sue me on account of my documents about these outfits at my www.sanskritweb.net/forgers website.
In Germany, an imposter was recently released from prison who had served a three-year imprisonment due to fraudulent imposture. A similar term would be expected for the impostors Harvey and Melissa Hunt, if they were no foreigners, because the German criminal police cannot prosecute foreigners.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Uli, this sounds a little like typo-conspiracy. What's your purpose, or intent for posting this? Just curious...</div>

<div class=commentbody>If Uli is risking the demise of Typophile this should
be immediately erased and he should be shut out.

<div class=commentbody>All the stuff on Uli's site (and I did read some of it) falls under "Right of Free Speech" and some of it even makes sense. Shutting Uli out would make NO sense…</div>

<div class=commentbody>Bert, what someone posts on their own site is their own business, and if they get sued because of it, that is a possible consequence they presumably acknowledge (Uli acknowledges it explicitly). Posting material to a public forum is a different matter, though, because then the owners of that forum may be sued as the publishers of that material. As an example, a few years ago, ATypI was sued because of a remark made by one member in the public archives of the member discussion list. ATypI hadn't written the remarks, hadn't endorsed the remarks, hadn't in fact, done anything other than made public the archive in which the remark appeared.
If Uli wants to pick fights with Berthold on his own website, that is his business, but he shouldn't be putting other people at risk in the process. His post is a deliberate taunt for Berthold to sue him, and by publishing the post on Typophile he is effectively inviting Berthold to sue Typophile also. The Typophile moderators would be showing nothing but due diligence in deleting this thread.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Bert, the reason people complain about a certain font house is
exactly why being in the right is not good enough, unfortunately.
I'm not doubting Uli's intentions, intellect or anything
like that, but I don't want Typophile to become a martyr.
