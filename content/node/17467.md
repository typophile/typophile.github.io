    but fitness-for-purpose is even more important.\r\nAnd are you looking for a text
    font or for headings and such?\r\nAlso: assuming you can't reveal the logo (or
    even just the\r\ncompany name) could you say what letters are in it? Like is\r\nthere
    a \"Q\", \"a\" or \"g\"? Those are the distinctive glyphs in\r\nTrade Gothic,
    so might help in finding a suitable companion.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    and r (all lower case)... It is a software company marketing to pharmaceutical
    companies. They want clean simple lines but not too over the top since it markets
    to a somewhat conservative group. \r\n\r\nThanks!"
