<p>The situation is this- I have a book I need to format for someone (my dad actually) and am already stuck- trying to decide what font to use!</p>
<p>The only info I&rsquo;m beginning with is that I&rsquo;d like to use serif, having heard more than once that sans serif is inadvisable for books.</p>
<p>I would like to give a better idea of what I&rsquo;m looking for, but my ignorance has got the best of me here. The book is non-fiction, essentially about ethics, society, agnosticism, serious schtuff like that. :-)</p>
<p>So if anyone has suggestions of fonts I can try, I&rsquo;m all ears. I&rsquo;m also open to suggestions regarding books about fonts for books, but that is more long term, as I need to begin formatting this book yesterday.</p>
<p>Thanks for any advice you can give,
Gertie</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Yes, to each and every one of the types mentioned here. I&rsquo;ve used most of them. I&rsquo;d throw Usherwood and Cheltanham into the mix, too, tho’, of them, my personal favorites are Bembo and Adobe Garamond. Don’t laugh, I also happen to think that Palatino is an elegant-looking face for extended stretches of text. That said—and despite my ranting about the current, exasperating overuse of sans serifs for book body text on any number of blogs—including <a href="http://www.tianodesign.com/blog"> <b>my own</b></a>—I’m trying to steel my nerve for using Optima if the right project comes along.</p>
<p>One thing, if you want to approach this like a book designer—and this needn’t take a chunk of time out of your life &hellip; Start by reading just a few paragraphs explaining type classification: the differences between Old Style, Transitional, etc. Then look at some types from different periods and places. Finally, take a look at the material your dad has written about and consider whether there’s a type that just seems to naturally go with his book <i>in your eyes.&lt;/&gt;</p>

<p>How about some new, excellent book types?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Way to go, Carl!</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s something maybe more important than which specific face you choose: find a face you know will have all the elements that make for good book typography. Roman + italic, of course. Small caps, and maybe even italic smalls. Semibold, with italic &amp; smalls, if you need subheads. Do you have notes? Then get superiors and stay away from the false ones.</p>
<p>Make sure you get faces that suit text and body copy to use for chapter numbers and chapter titles.</p>
<p>&amp; see if you can find some university press books in those areas Dad wrote about and look at them. Do not steal, but get ideas. Buy or borrow a copy of Richard Hendel&rsquo;s &ldquo;On Book Design.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Good luck. Have fun.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Jeez. I&rsquo;ve been typesetting &ndash; and occasionally designing &ndash; books for over 25 years. I guess that makes me an old fogy.</p>
<p>How to be with it (if that&rsquo;s still an acceptable hip term) is to go to a catalog of a juried book show, and see what fonts the designers who got the most books in the show used.</p>
<p>Then increase the leading. If they set 10/15, you set 10/18.</p>
<p>Ignore what the book is about. Ignore the audience (who&rsquo;s going to read it). After all, the biggest design problem is designer boredom. Solve that, and everything else falls into place.</p>
<p>And since I seem to be filled with vitrol this morning, to Will Powers: Why in the world would you use boldface for subheads? I can see it in a travel book, where the reader is skipping around, trying to find only what interests him/her. But in a book to be read continuously, a subhead simply takes the place of a paragraph used to transit from one topic to another. You don&rsquo;t need to ruin the color of the page by using boldface.</p>
<p>But back to the original question: what&rsquo;s the book about? Who (aside from your dad) is going to read it?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I was going to stay out of this, but now I can&rsquo;t help myself.</p>
<p>I have to say that Cheltenham is one of the most unlikely and idiosyncratic choices I can think of for setting book text.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s speaking in generalities. I suppose I would have to consider which specific Cheltenham we&rsquo;re talking about (please tell me <em>not</em> ITC Cheltenham) and what the nature of the book is &ndash; format, topic, audience. Even so, I have a hard time swallowing it.</p>
<p>I, too, applaud Carl&rsquo;s list and his perspective &ndash; even though I will confess that there are a handful of faces on his list that I would not likely employ for book work. But maybe that&rsquo;s just the books I work on.</p>
<p>I do use Miller regularly; it&rsquo;s a standard for me. I&rsquo;ve used Mercury with modest success (but I think that&rsquo;s just me getting used to it &ndash; the face has the right qualities and attributes to recommend it, especially with the grades to play with). And of course, Whitman now and then (what can I say? ;-).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked with Chaparral and it can serve in certain contexts. (The page design wasn&rsquo;t mine, and I was skeptical at first, but came to terms with it.) I&rsquo;ve seen Will use it to good effect.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve admired Merlo and Rongel, but haven&rsquo;t had a chance to get close enough to them to be certain. Kingfisher, too, holds great promise and has been recommended by designers whose judgment I value. Arnhem has been highly recommended, and I&rsquo;ve been keeping my eye on it.</p>
<p>However, I have mixed feelings about Scala. I admired the design when it was released, but I just don&rsquo;t care for it in books. It&rsquo;s certainly been done often enough (I noticed there was a raft of Scala in last year&rsquo;s AAUP award winners), but it&rsquo;s too stiff and clunky for me in book text. (This was, in fact, part of the impetus to develop Whitman.)</p>
<p>And much as I admire Farnham and Prensa as designs and for periodicals, I find they are too distracting in book text for my taste. I&rsquo;m afraid the same might hold true for Feijoa (again, much as I admire it); but I&rsquo;m willing to suspend final judgment until I&rsquo;ve had occasion to put it through more paces.</p>
<p>All that said, Carl&rsquo;s is a pretty solid list. Even those I have dismissed, I might reconsider under the right circumstances, with the right manuscript.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I wish Carl&rsquo;s list had links. I couldn&rsquo;t easily track down some of his suggestions.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t used Cheltenham for running text in about 20 years. I&rsquo;m a bit of an old fogy too but it reminds me of the 80s, as does Goudy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I haven&rsquo;t bought a new serif font in awhile because if I&rsquo;m going to buy a font for text use I want the complete family and I just haven&rsquo;t had the money recently. I have my eye on Atma and Miller.</p>
<p>But I think for a book where the text is the thing, not the design, Janet would be wise to stick with a font that doesn&rsquo;t have too much personality, which is why some of Carl&rsquo;s fonts might not work for her. Chaparral for example, I keep trying to use it and it always seems to fall short. I can&rsquo;t articulate why.</p>

<p>Why in the world would you use boldface for subheads?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Charles: I did not suggest &ldquo;bold&rdquo; for subs. I just checked my post and it said &ldquo;semi-bold&rdquo;, and I believe there&rsquo;s valid reasons for using semi-bold as subs in many texts. I very rarely use bold in books, and discourage its use by freelancers who design for us.</p>
<p>But keep that vitriol flowing, Charles. It keeps us geezers young and healthy. And likable. All your other comments are vitriolically valid.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d never use Chelt for anything in a book except maybe a chapter number. &amp; for the work I do I find very little to like in Adobe Caslon or Adobe Garamond. Chaparral is hard to use well, for sure.</p>

<p>Steve, at the risk of seeming to nag, while you may feel confident estimating the performance of book types by viewing them onscreen, I think it&rsquo;s unrealistic to think that is enough information. I would have had a more harsh reaction to the idea of Cheltenham for books, except I took a look at the ITC Cheltenham specimen, and while I understand Kent&rsquo;s and others' revulsion, I can see how the Book weight could be used at small sizes. I think this is due to its large x-height, and would be possible only with generous tracking. It wasn&rsquo;t really possible for me to make an estimation of its capabilities without that real example. I encourage you to make more of an effort to research these new faces; If you get PDF specimens and print them out at 1200 dpi, you might be surprised to discover that some of them are indeed valuable, appealing workhorses.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Of the types mentioned, I would second Freight Text and Minion. Bringhurst set his &ldquo;bible&rdquo; in Minion. There are many other good suggestions as well.</p>
<p>I would also like to suggest Cycles Eleven: <a href="http://www.stonetypefoundry.com/cyclesoverview.html">http://www.stonetypefoundry.com/cyclesoverview.html</a></p>
<p>And, yes, I own all three.</p>
<p>Both Freight Text and Cycles are beautiful <em>and</em> extraordinarily readable. Cycles lacks bold italic. The heavier you go in Freight Text, the more the italic loses its neutrality. Depending on how you use it, that may be a good thing or not.</p>
<p>Twice in the last six months, Cycles was available at MyFonts for half price; not so now.</p>
<p>I have Cheltenham, but I&rsquo;ve never used it, mostly because I think it looks ugly.</p>
<p>While some may argue for personal preference, I agree with Colin Wheildon that setting a book in Sans Serif is not a good idea. Good for a STOP sign but not for a book.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>&ldquo;While some may argue for personal preference, I agree with Colin Wheildon that setting a book in Sans Serif is not a good idea. Good for a STOP sign but not for a book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The problem I have with this and other iterations of the sentiment is that it pre-emptively collapses every example of &ldquo;sans&rdquo; into a single abstract idea, somehow made binarily opposed to the similarly generic and abstract idea of &ldquo;serif&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s the most oversimplified, thoughtless, outdated trope that unfortunately still has currency with otherwise intelligent designers. Consider:</p>
<p>Is digital Bauer Bodoni, at 9 points, set solid, printed in a weak gray ink on hard glossy paper, necessarily, categorically easier to read, safer, more advisable than Syntax, at 11/14, in a rich black ink on soft off-white paper? This is one possible interpretation of the &ldquo;axiom&rdquo; being repeated above. It isn&rsquo;t enough to simply say that this exception proves the rule, since every real-world example you can think of is an exception.</p>
<p>There are so many different typefaces under the heading of &ldquo;Sans&rdquo; and so many &ldquo;Serif&rdquo; that the very idea that &ldquo;serif is better than sans for books&rdquo; now sounds like something you say when you have no other information, or have no ability to discern the differences between typefaces. It&rsquo;s not a visual idea at all. It made a lot more sense in the early 20th century when the available range of types was so much more limited, but this is a very different world typographically, and readers have evolved as well. What constitutes a &ldquo;Sans&rdquo; typeface has expanded and grown considerably more complex since this kind of distinction was first made. The evolution of the Sans letter has been a very recent and very sudden one.</p>
<p>It may cause a number of readers here to become defensive and reach for their Updike and Morison for reinforcement, but I challenge you all to perform with your own eyes, the actual, literal act of reading text set in some of the newer sans designs (see Florian&rsquo;s list above) and compare them with our &ldquo;classics&rdquo; like Bodoni, Garamond 3, Cheltenham, Bookman, Palatino, Trump Mediaeval, or any other faces considered acceptable or safe for book text.</p>
<p>My contention is that this sentiment, this axiom, this truism of typography is an unexamined myth, waiting to be disproved by the simple act of direct engagement with the real typographic scene of today. It is an echo of earlier times, before the sans letter had undergone the enormous, rich and rapid evolution it has undergone during the last century. Right now, it&rsquo;s 2008, and Florian&rsquo;s list is a very useful bellwether of the changes the genre of &ldquo;Sans&rdquo; has undergone since Updike and Morison were even alive.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done my part by designing a typeface for book text that has no serifs. Others have existed, and more are on the way. If you want a printed specimen of Beorcana, which is a real example of its actual performance, contact me. As always, judging typefaces online for book text is useless.</p>
<p>Repeating a tired axiom from decades past only limits you, leaving you prejudiced, blind and unable to take advantage of recent advances. Join the 21st century.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>BRAVO! Carl! Too many people have a way of pigeonholing things into categories and assuming that their task has brought more meaning to the value of the things sorted. There is no definitive statement made by any study that takes to task the individual conditions of every typeface in composed use. The task is just too daunting and too cloudy to take for much value. How nice and simplistic it would be if we just applied such a simple litmus test as sans vs serif but it just ain&rsquo;t so.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>You know, a study on why sans have been cast as inferior in legibility would be very informative in the construction and usage of fonts in general.
I can see several differences that could be looked at: the serifs themselves, line width variation (humanist sans seem to be a recent development), weight (sans are often heavier), spacing, and letter shape.</p>
<p>A good idea would be to take a wide variety of serif fonts, and slice off the serifs and line endings, which would be saved separately as serif sets. Then, a variety of sans serif fonts and the castrated fonts from earlier would be taken, to each of which each serif set would be applied, as well as Optima, Albertus, and Candara-style flarings and finishing off the castrated serifs as sans (given that different sans use different cuts [this being one of the main differences between Helvetica and Arial], various endings from sans could also be added to the mix-and-match). This would, of course, require great skill, as tailoring would be necessary for each combination, and potentially tens of thousands of man-hours.
After this, the various combinations could be tested for legibility. Due to the large number of combinations, this test would be much simpler than it would be for single fonts (though finding enough people would be tough). The scores could than be tied to each feature, so there would be an average of all scores of combinations with geometric builds and an average for old style serifs.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Gertie, there are two fonts that are ALWAYS successful in books, even with the wrong leading/formatting: Sabon and Janson, both with oldstyle figures. You can NEVER go wrong with either of these. Just remember to always use old-style figures, and be very careful about throwing in sans-serifs: the combo usually looks vulgar in a book.</p>
<p>Beyond that, my vote is for fat (Adobe Caslon or MT Plantin with OSF) over slightly condensed letter forms, like Minion. I disagree with one poster&rsquo;s aversion to Scala in books: I feel it looks great. Josh Darden&rsquo;s re-think of Fournier, Corundum, is just outstanding. Then there are all the options re periods and themes: mid-19th-century is effectively called up by ITC Bodoni 12, and earlier 1800s by either Storm&rsquo;s version of Walbaum or Richard Beatty&rsquo;s of Kennerley. For evocations of late 18th century French typography, we&rsquo;re still needy: Sirenne and Acanthus are just too heavy to work properly in today&rsquo;s book designs.</p>
<p>We still have a horrible problem with foundries releasing text families that lack bold and/or bold italic. There are lots of manuscripts that call for bold somewhere, and a publisher does not want to hear he can&rsquo;t get something in bold. This is why Clifford and Requiem have not swept the design field: they are shamelessly incomplete!</p>

<p>I like Sabon but I find Janson&rsquo;s italics very hard to read, like Caslon&rsquo;s. I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend that font for a book that might have a lot of italic text.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t miss the bold in Requiem (altho I&rsquo;d love fractions!) or in most other serif fonts. In general I don&rsquo;t use a lot of bold serif fonts. Sans serif bold, yes.</p>
<p>I am going to bookmark this page too next time I want to go on a font spending spree. There are some excellent suggestions here, some I knew already, others not. I must confess to not liking stressed sans in general which cuts out (for me) much of Florian&rsquo;s list.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hmm. Let&rsquo;s seen now.</p>
<p>John D. Berry  &ldquo;quite happily read a novel that was typeset in Optima&rdquo; and Pattyfab &ldquo;would not read a novel in Optima,  just as a matter of principle.&rdquo;  (<a href="http://www.typophile.com/node/41586">http://www.typophile.com/node/41586</a>) OK, so different strokes for different folks.</p>
<p>And Pattyfab confesses to &ldquo;to not liking stressed sans in general.&rdquo; Fine.</p>
<p>But let <em>me</em> suggest that serif is better suited to extended text than sans, and, in a pompous, arrogant, demeaning tone Carl Crossgrove essentially brands me a Luddite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done my part by designing a typeface for book text that has no serifs.&rdquo; Whoopee do, Carl, does that &ldquo;disprove the unexamined myth&rdquo;? Does your new sans text font rewrite 500 years of typographic practice? You <em>could</em> use Curlz to typeset a book. I could come up with some scenarios where Curlz looks better than a sans, if you want to use ludicrous examples as Carl did. What does that prove?</p>
<p>If you really examined &ldquo;the myth,&rdquo; Carl, you&rsquo;d find that there have been numerous studies over decades and, at best, they&rsquo;re inconclusive or contradictory.</p>
<p>I have no problem with any typeface anyone wants to set their book or magazine or newspaper in. My principle in refusing to read any text is whether or not it is easy and pleasant (i.e., not difficult or annoying) to read.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m open to lots of things, setting text in sans included. I&rsquo;m not open to snotty, condescending diatribes like Carl&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Is civility so hard?</p>

<p>I think Janson (Text) is among the most readable fonts. I agree with Pattyfab about the italics. It always looked to me like somebody (or something) sat on top of the lc and flattened the tops of some letters.</p>
<p>If you like Janson, you should also like Ehrhardt, also by Kis. But I am not a big fan of the windswept <em>w.</em></p>
<p>Another Kis-based possibility is  E+F&rsquo;s Nikis Light, but I don&rsquo;t know where you can get it anymore. I always loved the lc  italic <em>g</em> because it didn&rsquo;t look like a pair of eyeglasses or a wire coat hanger. (Is E+F out of business?)</p>
<p>I thank Pattyfab for mentioning Sabon, which I haven&rsquo;t used in a while. I&rsquo;m reprinting some &ldquo;Best of&rdquo; pieces from my newsletter, and  switched one piece from Adobe Garamond to Sabon, and I really like it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Great thread.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking for a new font to use in a new book project.  It&rsquo;s a heavily illustrated architecture book, hopefully with a lot of white space, but also with some large blocks of text.  I wish that all of the fonts on Carl&rsquo;s list had PDF sample sheets, cause that seems to be the best way to get an initial impression of how the font feels.  I printed out the ones that did, and my initial choices would be Kingfisher, Arnheim and Freight.  I guess I&rsquo;m looking for something very readable, but with a slight edge.  Usually like to open up the leading, but I think that may be adding to the impression of the type being too light?</p>
<p>I have been using Terminal Design&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.terminaldesign.com/fonts/sets/?CID=2">Alfon</a> quite a lot recently, and like it alot, but I&rsquo;m starting to think it prints too light, and want to mix things up a bit.</p>

<p>Most folks naturally link Whitman to the Font Bureau site, where the fonts are available for license; but I have an alternate PDF specimen, which might be more useful for judging the type for book purposes, at my site: 
<a href="http://www.kentlew.com/Type/WhitmanSpecimen.pdf">http://www.kentlew.com/Type/WhitmanSpecimen.pdf</a></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ll deem this design to be what you have in mind.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not aware of Whitman in use in any architectural books quite like what you do. There was a recent guide to Chicago architecture, but that was a small format (and small type). It has been used in some how-to building titles &ndash; <cite>The Fence Bible</cite> and <cite>How to Build Paths, Steps &amp; Footbridges</cite> (both from Storey Publishing, under my direction), which are similar in format to yours.</p>
<p>If the type interests you, but you need to review more examples, I&rsquo;d be happy to set some of your own sample text to match your specifications and send you a PDF. Contact me if you want to arrange this.</p>

<p>That helps.  Looks like a nice font.  I&rsquo;m not in the studio today, but I will print it out tomorrow &amp; look more closely.  If not right for this book, might be good for some of the  newsletters/magazine projects I do.</p>
<p>Am really into a body type discovery phase right now. I have always focused more on the art direction, overall layout design, and display type and treatment. But I am really drilling down to the fine details of typopgraphy (when I get a chance) these days.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>This is a pretty old thread. I imagine a number of us are finished with it &ndash; I can&rsquo;t even say why I looked at this last post. With that in mind, you might do better starting a new one.</p>
<p>Off the top of my head, I don&rsquo;t think of Minion as <cite>wrong</cite> for science, but I don&rsquo;t think it is the best choice, either. I think Minion&rsquo;s Greek characters are drawn primarily for classical Greek &ndash; note the Greek extended (aka polytonic) glyphs, used only with ancient Greek. You would know better than I whether or not Minion&rsquo;s Greek glyphs are appropriate for science. I remember having to change something &ndash; either the theta or phi? &ndash; for some technical figures supplied to us by a designer using Minion &ndash; they used the wrong ones. The scientific ones are there, but not in the &ldquo;regular&rdquo; Unicode spot.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the font has none of the chemical bonding characters, and I believe it doesn&rsquo;t have alphabetic superiors/inferiors. The superior/inferior numbers aren&rsquo;t quite right for science either &ndash; nor are they quite right for footnote calls.</p>
<p>I imagine there are better fonts for your purpose, even though Minion is quite a nice font.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Chris, I think the superiors/inferiors in Arno are too big &amp; too low for scientific work. Some applications programs would let you fiddle with this, but then you&rsquo;re off the OT feature, aren&rsquo;t you? Too, I&rsquo;d classify it as a &ldquo;sort-of-Venetian&rdquo;; a touch off for chemistry. &amp; While p-chem doesn&rsquo;t need all the bonding symbols of organic, he probably needs a few.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m not the best person to ask about scientific superscripts, but I do remember Arno well because it was just a couple weeks ago I went in and made the superscripts both smaller, and raised them up. Also put the superscripted numbers on a proportional body &amp; kerned them. Also made sure the superscript alphas and numbers had a common &ldquo;baseline.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Actually, these were the &ldquo;number.super&rdquo; glyphs, switched by the superiors feature. Scientific notation should be called by the Unicode index for superiors (except as I remember, superscript alphas aren&rsquo;t encoded? See, I told you I wasn&rsquo;t the best person to ask). Adobe&rsquo;s superiors feature doesn&rsquo;t switch to these, and that gives improper syntax.</p>
<p>Additionally, scientific superiors should have a certain relationship with both cap &amp; l.c. letters, and lining numbers. All of these should fit well with the tops of parens &amp; brackets, too, which isn&rsquo;t the case with Arno. Arno is a lovely font, but again, IMO, not for scientific work.</p>
<p>Adam doesn&rsquo;t post much on the design forum, but I&rsquo;d trust his judgment, or any of the programmer types with an engineering background (which gives two strikes against me).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks, Charles. I will take a closer look at Arno and check out your findings. I probably fall into the 3 strikes catagory when it comes to scientific work. I did work for an engineering firm in 1969 and did several books for them. Those were the old days and we used phototype so I specd the type but did not set it. There were plenty of math formulas which I pasted up but left the proof reading to the engineers. :-)</p>

<p>Ah. Not sure. The last time I had to deal with equations as an &ldquo;author&rdquo; was when I took (&amp; passed!) my math-logic prelim in 1970. As a compositor, I&rsquo;ve set a bunch of equations since then, usually in economics.</p>
<p>Book interior design is all about audience, and a little bit about the author. If I&rsquo;m faced with designing a book where I don&rsquo;t know the subject matter, I look to see what typefaces other designers have used, over a period of time. That &ldquo;period of time&rdquo; is the best way to avoid getting caught using a current fashion that will soon fade.</p>
<p>As a WAG, I doubt most chemists would find, say,  Bembo a comfortable font for professional work. Something modern, but plain. In my grad student days that was Times Roman, but Times has become so much a design taboo that has probably changed.</p>
<p>I still remember one of my professors saying &ldquo;Prelims are puberty rites,&rdquo; and my dissertation director saying &ldquo;just get it done.&rdquo; Since he had taken ten years to write his on the early psychology of Agostino  Nifo, I figured he was wrong. But it turned out he was right, &amp; I never finished mine.</p>
<p>Moral: Steal a design from something the audience will be comfortable with, &amp; get on with your life.</p>

<p>Yes, seems to be very nice!
Maybe the Italic is a little bit stiff.</p>
<p>Great typeface however</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Speaking of text fonts, may I ask for an opinion (which the original poster might find useful as well)?</p>
<p>Nine years ago when I started self-publishing my <a href="http://www.costumegoddess.com/series.htm"><strong>costume how-to books</strong></a> (with zero funds to buy fonts) an editor friend recommended <a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?1MX"><strong>Book Antigua</strong></a> for body text, and I still use that for the book series, with Zapf Humanist for subtitles.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s the custom here to disapprove of Windows-installed fonts, but what do you think of that choice? To me it has always looked pleasantly clean, legible and non-distracting.</p>
<p>If it was today I&rsquo;d probably choose Minion as I now have lots of Adobe fonts, but Book Antigua still looks good, I think.</p>
