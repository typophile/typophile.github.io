  can be an advertising campaign or a famous poster anything really set in any type
  of design style from Constructivism to Art Nouveau, it would be even better if the
  current design is almost an exact copy of an existing design from the past\r\n\r\nThank
  you guys so much for your help... This design history class drives me nuts!!!!\r\n\r\n-Meeshka"
