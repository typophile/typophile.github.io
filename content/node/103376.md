  body: "Thank you, sirjason, for noticing the \"Type ID\" forum (even if it's a bit
    too late).\r\n\r\nPending a moderator moving your post: this font <em>appears</em>
    to be <a href=\"http://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&event=displayFontPackage&code=1053\">ITC
    Eras Light</a>, except ... someone didn't like the exquisitely small slant (a
    feature of this font by design), and backslanted it upright?"
