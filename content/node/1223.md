body: 'So I thought I had a decent handle on the use of small caps...  until I started
  working on an annual report for a state chapter of the ACLU.  <BR> <BR>On one hand,
  the name appears so frequently that one could make a good argument for small caps:
  overall color, less visual disturbance, etc.  But on the other, this is <i>their</i>
  annual report, and one could make a good argument for not wanting the organization&#39;s
  name to disappear into the text.  <BR> <BR>Bringhurst and other orthodox priests
  call for small caps in this situation. The other ACLU materials I have here don&#39;t
  use SC, but they make lots of other typographic faux pas, so I wouldn&#39;t base
  my decision on that, necessarily. On the third &#40;?&#41; hand, it&#39;s likely
  that if I use SC, the clients will just think it looks wrong since they&#39;re used
  to regular caps. <BR> <BR>It pains me, but for practical reasons I&#39;m inclined
  to use real caps. Yet on the fourth hand, if I do, then I&#39;ll have to set PATRIOT
  Act in big caps too, which pains me more. What to do? <BR> <BR>--Meredith with four

  body: It depends on the x-height/cap-height ratio as well as the smallcap height
    of the font in question. <BR> <BR>- If the x-height is big enough compared to
    the caps, then fullcaps can be OK. However this usually means the x-height is
    too big for good readability &#40;at normal text sizes&#41;. <BR> <BR>- If the
    smallcaps are too small &#40;like they so often are&#41; then they might indeed
    not work. <BR> <BR>That said, typically the smallcaps are less bad than fullcaps.
    <BR> <BR>BTW, you might check out FF Atma - a smallcap size for every season!

  body: I was using Bembo &#40;Monotype&#41; -- x-height is big enough that full caps
    don&#39;t look terrible. I think the smallcaps are, indeed, a bit too small. Maybe
    Atma is the way to go. Mid caps! Quarter caps! A smorgasbord of caps!

  body: If their other material is full of typographic <i>faux pas</i>, will they
    even notice if you use smallcaps? <BR> <BR>PS I think you should use a Fraktur
    font for setting &#34;PATRIOT Act&#34;! ;&#41; <BR> <BR>Paul

    small, but because they&#39;re so delicate, I don&#39;t think they disrupt the

    &#34;Why is OUR name so SMALL?&#34;  <BR> <BR>Man, I get stuff like this a lot.
    The right stuff has become wierd and &#39;wrong&#39; to a lot of clients. I say
    do it all with SC as your judgment and references stipulate &#40;if the face you
    choose allows&#41;. Make a typographic argument for it if they notice and if they
    don&#39;t relent just change their name and not the rest. Arguably, you&#39;d
    just be choosing a typographic solution that best fits the situation. And that&#39;s
    what we want, right?  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve had the same battle both internally &#40;in
    my head&#41; and externally &#40;with the client&#41; about client acronyms. This
    thread makes me feel like much less of an amateur.'

    In fact, they&#39;re behind me right now moving my arms and hands to type this.
