body: "Greetings all. I am trying to find a sample of the logo/letterhead of a now-defunct
  grocery store chain: First National Stores. It used to be a major grocery store
  chain in New England and the northeast, but seems to have been bought out and buried
  in recent decades. I spotted this toy truck from the 1950s, but I need to see a
  sample of their logo from the 1920s or '30s. Anybody here ever seen it? Anybody
  from that part of the country who might remember it? I'd be grateful for any leads.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FirstNatTruck_4019.jpg]"

    which has some old pictures.  It doesnt look like any of them reflect an actual
    logo, though.\r\n\r\nBut <a href=\"http://www.hampton.lib.nh.us/hampton/history/business/2000s/finast1920s.htm\">this</a>
    has what looks like an old circular, from (i think it says) 1931."
