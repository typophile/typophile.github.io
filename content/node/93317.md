  but the press gives us severe restrictions on the die shape. The problem is that
  the process of gluing the cover sheets to the body includes a high-speed 90 degree
  rotation as the sheets are pulled from the pile that has a tendency to get things
  tangled up. I wonder if any of you have done similar things earlier? Can you give
  me some advice?\r\n\r\nI have also considered the option of printing on a translucent/transparent
  paper, but I have yet to figure out if it is possible with offset, folding and gluing.
  \r\n\r\nAre there other ways to achive a see-through effect?"

    the chance of paper jamming.

    have no value for your specific situation this time \u2014 but what about just
    perforating the logo and letting the readers interact by punching it out themselves?"

    cuts done manually after the piece is bound."

    but always with saddle-stitched binding, not glued. Your printer would probably
    be the best source of technical advice IF they have previous experience with these
    techniques on glued covers. Can they show you examples of similar pieces they've
    done? If so, then they would probably be the best source of advice. But if not,
    then perhaps you should be looking for a different printer for this job.\r\n\r\nFrom
    a design standpoint, my concern about translucent paper is that the entire page
    would show through, not just the area you'd planned to die cut. Unless maybe you
    have large inked areas to cover what's on page 2.\r\n "

    it. Even if the cover comes out of binding okay, you still have to contend with
    automated mail processing equipment\u2014unless you go to the additional expense
    of poly-bagging the magazine before mailing."

    first and page of the book, with these being a thicker weight of paper, maybe.\r\nThis
    may involve some handiwork (do it by hand instead of automated), but is a guarantee
    that you achieve the desired effect.\r\n\r\nUsed to be that esp French books were
    sold this way (promotional dustcover on simple book block)."

  body: "The 21st century equivalent of die-cutting is laser cutting.\r\n\r\nThe publisher
    I work for has done this for several books -- rather small print runs, though.
    But much to my surprise, this could even be done <em>after</em> a book was perfect
    bound. In that particular case it had to be done after binding, because it had
    those colored inside pages that get glued to the cover (uh, I cannot recall the
    English term for this) and the idea was to see the colored page through the cover,
    rather than the original white \"page 1\"."
