  I was wondering if anyone can help me find some\r\ngood type families. More specifically,
  I'm looking for commercial\r\nserif families, nothing free, with a large palette
  if possible.\r\nI'd also prefer OpenType over TrueType.\r\n\r\nI've seen a lot of
  modern recuts that I liked of Caslon, Baskerville,\r\nGaramond, and all of other
  classics. I've never really been able\r\nto identify what they are but the outlining
  characteristics is that\r\nthey are very \"clean\" cut, compared to their classic
  counterparts,\r\nand would set a lot better for wordmarks. Families like Adobe Caslon\r\nset
  well in books, but really aren't what I would consider ideal\r\nfor workmarks and
  corporate id.\r\n\r\nIf anyone knows any good \"modern\" (not didone) recuts of
  classics,\r\nplease share them with me? Thanks.\r\n\r\nPS: I've been looking through
  my FontBook for hours, some of which\r\naren't available in opentype, which is disappointing."
