<div class=commentbody> This is beyond likeable, IMO, will you make other weights? Ultra Thin & Mega Ultra Phat! Love the little nuances! Extremely enjoy the 'e' and 't', but can't pick any favorites. if anything, your 'g' is too straight faced for the rest of them. <br> <br>Tiffany </div>

<div class=commentbody> Wow. It's very fresh but seems somehow very <br>familiar--a good thing for a typeface, I think. I <br>agree with Tiffany on all points. The expressive <br>elements in the e, f (and that t!) are great but <br>don't come through in the g. <br> <br>I'm glad these forums help people like yourself <br>muster the courage to step up.

<div class=commentbody> Hello Luis and congratulations for the type face, good starting. I also want to make some suggestings and questions. The l/c x have different expessures, which is visible if you use as a display font, but is looking great with small sizes. I prefere to see that kind of forms a relation betten then which create a better uniformity for all letters, for exemple ( use the letter (o) to create the bowl of the (g), (b), (d), (p), (q), or using the letter (n) to give the aperture and struture for the (y),(u). <br> <br>1 > Did you use any over-shoot (baseline overshoot, x-height overshoot ) to differentiate the limits of the round parts? <br> <br>2 > How you make the relation betten letters when use the round terminal ( b, e, q). <br> <br>Its very interesting your type face and I want to see how your serene grow up during the time. <br>Boa apari&#231;&#227;o Luis e for&#231;a com esta tua bonita tipografia / Comprimentos. <br> <br>Ricardo Santos </div>

<div class=commentbody> If this is your first effort, I think you have great instincts - make sure they survive your upcoming "formal" learning effort. <br> <br>I'd go further than Stephen and say that I think there are actually too many good ideas here! They're fighting for attention, and I think more discipline would create more functionality. So I'd spread out the good ideas over multiple fonts*, instead of maybe trying to make one "ultimate" font (which never works). For example, your "e" has a nice organic feel, and the stem on your "o" is amazing, but together they're maybe too much of a good thing. And then there are some glyphs which are a bit *too* plain, like the "x" I think has a lot more potential. <br> <br>* Maybe a set of fonts that work together? <br> <br>hhp </div>

<div class=commentbody> I agree with Hrant. I think you have (at least) two really good fonts here. <br> <br>"b", "e", "f", "k", "m", "n", "o", "q", and "t" all have a similar feel, taking the more innovative road, while <br> <br>"d", "g", "h", "p", "u", "v", "w", "x", and "z" all fit together in the more conservative path. <br> <br>The remaining characters ("a", "c", "i", "j", "l", "r", "s", and "y") could adequately fit with either of the other two sets as they are, or they could be pushed even closer to conformity to either set with slight modifications. <br> <br>I'd love to see a new "x" designed to echo the design of the "k", for example. And inverting the existing "n" could be an interesting approach to the "u", especially with how that would position the "u"'s tail. A similar treatment could be adapted to the "d", "g", "p" and "y". <br> <br>I'm excited to see what you do with this font. <br> <br>David </div>

<div class=commentbody> Although I understand both points made by Hrant and David, well I have to say that I enjoy the similarity but not the identical to the nth degree nature of this type. Knowing Hrant's love near fetish [ ;-) ] with Rotis I think I know what he's saying and that would be interesting, I'm not necessarily disagreeing here. IMO some display type gets boring when all of the characters are too identical in nature. Make sense? </div>

<div class=commentbody> First, i would like to say many txs to u people; Stephen, Tiffany, Joe, <br> <br>Ricardo, Hrant, David,Nuno for the good advices and the words of <br> <br>encouregement that give it to me, i've read all your messages carefully, <br> <br>and take my appointments, like in the case of x/y/g/u that i need to <br> <br>reformulate. And my question is how i can mantain the overture in the b/e/q <br> <br>when i use lower sizes ????, cos the overture disappears. <br> <br>So i'll redo my work, and emend some questions that i need to. Very soon <br> <br>i'll post some swf, for a closer inspection. <br> <br>One more time txs guys. <br> <br>See u soon <br> <br>Luis <br> <br>P.s: Ricardo dado que &#233;s o unico portugues (aparentemente), gostaria, se <br> <br>fosse possivel, trocar algumas opini&#245;es contigo mais aprofundadamente, dado <br> <br>que eu ainda n&#227;o tenho grandes conhecimentos de Fontographer. <br>Apesar de ser um "fanatico" de tipografia, de facto nunca tentei meter m&#227;os <br> <br>&#224; obra e come&#231;ar alguma coisa realmente minha e gostaria de saber se posso <br> <br>contar com a tua ajuda, (em portugues).

<div class=commentbody> Congratulations Luis! It's a very interesting work. I enjoyed a lot "f" & "t", although I think you have to review some of these characters again, like "s". <br>Why did you leave open some characters, for example, "b", "e" & "q" where "a", "d", "g", "o" & "p" are closed? <br>I hope you find my opinion useful in your work. <br>I'm looking foward to see "serena family" in the future. <br> <br>Good work! <br> <br>Cheers, <br> <br>Paulo </div>

<div class=commentbody> hello <br> <br>about the style of the font i agree more or less with every body. so I won't repeat arguments. <br>but... <br>maybe the 'm' could be a litle condensed it seems too large. <br> <br>on the contrary the 's, v, x, z' seem too condensed than the rest of the font. and usualy the 'o' is a litle bit larger than the 'n' but is not a rule. <br> <br>good work <br> <br>se nao me fiz explicar de algum modo, nao esites em avisar. </div>
