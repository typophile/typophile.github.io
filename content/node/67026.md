  a scriptwritten feel, like a menu-board in a restaurant?\r\n\r\nlike this one used
  here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.harpercollins.com/harperimages/isbn/large/8/9780732290498.jpg\r\n\r\nthanks!"

    text out, and when looking through the book I believe it was hand done and scanned.\r\n\r\nI
    remembered Fugu after posting the request and I think she may suggest it to the
    client, but thanks again for the help!\r\n\r\ncheers"
