I am new to this forum but will submit this to get some reaction and criticism, suggestion, etc. Whatever you think and wish to say, especially helpful things, will be helpful to me.

I understand that you're going for an old style look here, which is fine, but it can stand to better match the rest of the typeface. Strokes on the 1, 4 and 7 appear too dark. Plus, that aforementioned stroke on the 7 should come down as a descender. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In my opinion, the punctuation seems too small for the rest of the letters. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You've got a great start - I look forward to the end result! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->-Jake</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Jake, et al <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here are some changes, most importantly to the figures. The uc &amp; lc Z do look better with the bevel at the corners. Not sure about the Q tail but does look better than that weak thing it had before. Needless to say, I am working on this. I would have to say before someone asks that I can guess that the approximate time it took to make the font so far has been about 2 months, not every minute of the day, but when working on it as I did today just on the changes, about 4 hrs per day. I enlarged the punctuation and put some different letters in one of the samples. The lc x is improved I think.? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jordan</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks everyone for the help and suggestions. It will take me a while to think through all of the suggestions and come up with something. Max, the differences in stroke thickness between uc and lc was indeed deliberate, perhaps though overdone. As to what I am trying to achieve with this font, hmm? I have to think about this. Hrant, your point about little 'compensations' as in Futura is a very good point. I will be back after I work on this some.

		<div class="commentbody"><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here are some fairly substantial changes, most notably in the lc, but in all of the characters, the serifs have been widened, the tops of the joining strokes lc b,d,h,m,n,c,r,p,g have been rounded, rather than going straight in a very geometrical way. I printed out some samples at small point sizes, 10, 12, and the differences between uc and lc didn't appear to be a problem. See sample in 12 pt. I was not familiar with FF Shefiff but did look at it, and yes, there was a simiilarity in style with h, m, and n letters. This was not intentional, but it is changed anyway. Jake's suggestion re lc x was implemented. I am still thinking about where this is going, in response to Max H's question. Modern wood? <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jordan</div>

I largely agree with what has been said so far. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I can also add that you should look at the proportions, especially those of the upper case. The uc &quot;A&quot; and &quot;V&quot; seem a bit wide, and the &quot;Z&quot; seems a bit narrow, for example. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I also agree that both the uc and lc &quot;S/s&quot; characters seem out of place with their present squarish forms.
