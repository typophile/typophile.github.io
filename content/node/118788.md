  body: "Racheluh, 1. It's difficult to suggest a font to go with a logo we can't
    see. 2. What kind of music is this? 3. Who is the target audience? 4. T\xE9 Rowan's
    earlier remark is applicable. Readable, edgy, stylish, psychedelic, other? 5.
    What is a lyric sheet, in this context? Is it one sheet of paper? Stapled big
    or little sheets of paper? Something on the internet? A little booklet for a CD
    package? Is the logo going to be close to the lyrics? 6. What do other lyric sheets
    use?"

    Presumably with both an upper and lower case? If it's tiny print I have little

  body: "The thing is, during the psychedelic era there was a limited range of fonts
    available at text size, and these were all quite legible. So, in order to create
    a suitably mysterious effect, designers made these really hard to read by printing
    them in weird shit colours\u2014with complementary simultaneous contrast, for
    instance, or in different colors with similar tones, such as cyan on black.\r\n\r\nThe
    lyrics of Sgt. Pepper, for instance, were printed in Times Roman (IIRC) black
    on red, also surprinting an inset close-cropped photo of the Beatles in colorful
    pseudo-antique military uniforms."

    effin pack of Shinn-man's Scotches for the text?
