  label's web site. Right now, with how it is, it doesn't really click.\r\n\r\nI was
  aiming for a russian/constructivist look with the bold usage of red and black, but
  i don't think the type serves this purpose. The typeface is Akzidenz Grotesk Bold,
  what do you think would fit in better?\r\n\r\nThanks"

    not sure about the horizontal strokes. What about Futura esp. condensed or some
    other bauhaus geometric?\r\nQuick sketch...\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/KK.gif]"

    for the proportion of the red and black color. However I think the type will be
    better if he would be separate one of the other and make it bigger and larger.
    Sans is a good choice but if your're not sure about that typeface try something
    else to see the look it will give. What do you think about that one:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bagraphics/gusto/black/"

  body: "If it's realy constructivist you want & it's a logo I suggest you get in
    somne books & make your own! They are fairly simple to make - but probably less
    simple to make REALLY well. Stil, an original solution for type in a logo is always
    a little more ideal because it catches the eye better. If you want a super fast
    solution there is always 'constructovist' from P22\r\n\r\nhttp://www.p22.com/products/constructivist.html\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Constructivistov_r1_c1.gif]\r\n\r\nThe
    other thing is that so far you are giving me a swiss modern or post swiss feel
    not a constructivist one. They were big on wacky energtic angles and didn't go
    in for the degree of reductivism/simplicity you are using so far. Again, crack
    those books!\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, they were big on using human figures even if they
    were pretty abstracted\r\n\r\nCheck this out\r\n\r\nhttp://www.a-website.org/design/pictohistory/pics/constructivist/kozlinskii.jpg\r\n\r\nBut
    I like what you made too.\r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: "thanks for the suggestions so far.\r\n\r\ni think you're right about the
    proportions, but i have a thing for the horizantal stroke of the kk. i think they
    give the abstract/graphic kk feeling better.\r\n\r\ni think my choice of typeface
    takes the whole feel of te design from consrtuctivist to minimal... i'll try to
    come up with a home-made face for the logo based on the suggestions of EbenSorkin.
    The way i see it, when i change the face i'll be able to be bolder with the kk
    icon.\r\n\r\nOne thing i found out is that the letter K is very  difficult to
    manage and tame.\r\n\r\nbtw, \"Korkunc Kayitlar\" is turkish and roughly means
    \"Terrible Records\", terrible with a double meaning, either scary or good as
    in \"terribly good\".\r\n\r\nthanks for your time and suggestions, i'll post the
    updates.\r\n\r\nea"
