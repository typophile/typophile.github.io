  body: It appears to be a Hallmark Cards font named Centennial Bold. No source. I
    believe these are proprietary and not available for purchase.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kinf1_4899.jpg]

  body: "Yes I did, when I first saw your request. \r\nThe cards shown lack the letters
    CFGHINOPQSTUVWXYZ\r\nboqtvwxy.\r\nI am particularly interested in seeing some
    of the missing capital letters, or if that is not possible, a reference to an
    upright script font that has capital letters that are very similar in style to
    the ones shown in the sample cards.\r\nI found my search for a reasonable match
    to be rather unproductive. The results were either too stiff and formal or looked
    like they had been composed by someone whose hand shook while using a brush.\r\nI
    wonder if any of the typophiles reading this have any suggestions?\r\nDon"
