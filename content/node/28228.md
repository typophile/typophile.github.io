body: "Hello all! I'm looking for a nice, ornate serif typeface. Here's specifically
  what I'm looking for. I want a typeface that has:\r\n\r\n1) The swashes, ligatures
  and other ornate fun of <a href=http://www.linotype.com/webshop/view.linotype?viewmode=search&searchFields%5B%5D=0&searchFields%5B%5D=2&PHPSESSID=92d321831a12bdc82e2dd30cb35ad975&ACT=quicksearch&searchLogic=and&searchContent=true&wildcard=1&searchType=as_families&GROUP=&DISPLAYC=full&searchTerm=sabon+next>Sabon
  Next</a>...\r\n\r\n2) ...but the personality and feel of <a href=http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&font_categories=1&font_categories_search=font_name_search&searchstr=quadraat>Quadraat
  </a> or <a href=http://www.underware.nl/site2/index.php3?id1=dolly&id2=overview>Dolly</a>.
  \r\n\r\nAm I asking too much? Do I want to have my cake and eat it too? (Note: while
  I very much like <a href=http://www.underware.nl/site2/index.php3?id1=sauna&id2=overview>Sauna</a>,
  I'm looking for a true serif typeface.) Any suggestions?"

    particular check out Classica which bears some resemblance to Quadraat (and is
    nicer, I think)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/presencetypo/classica/"

  body: "<a href=http://www.typetrust.com/fonts/font.php?fontid=MTU2>Musee</a> is
    <em>awesome</em> and almost <em>exactly</em> what I'm looking for, however I'm
    wondering if anyone has used it as a text face before. There aren't a lot of samples
    of body copy. I'll be using this typeface for large amounts of text.\r\n\r\nI
    think Yves mentioned before that he's used it for text before, any samples anyone?
    \r\n\r\nPatty, thanks for the link I've found some great examples. I also like
    <a href=http://www.suitcasetype.com/page.php?lmut=en&section=font&font=dederon%20Serif%20Std%20OT#15>Dederon
    Serif</a> but don't see any large copy samples. Have you used this face before
    in copy (or anyone else for that matter)? Any samples?"

  body: 'Musee looks like it would read better for long copy than Dederon. I''m not
    a fan of what I call the "soft" serif. I find the proportions heavy, altho Dederon
    does look like a nice complete font. '

    for text and headlines I know it's not quite the same thing, maybe you could contact
    Dino dos Santos and ask for some sample text setting.\r\nTim"
