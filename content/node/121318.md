  font or at least the base font, if it is bespoke.\r\nSomeone just mentioned it's
  \ 'Ringbearer'  - I can assure you it's not ;) \r\n\r\nThanks![img:sites/default/files/old-images/mars_science_4846.jpg]"

    gets the A right, but you\u2019d have to edit the leg of the |R| and the terminals
    of the |S| to get it to match (plus add the distressing):\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/hiroshige/\r\n\r\nThese
    two fonts would require a bit less editing (serif on the |A|, tweaks to the |R|
    and |S|, plus distressing):\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/arrus/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/legacy-serif/\r\n\r\nDafont.com
    has a category called Fancy, subcategory Eroded; you may be able to find a distressed
    serif there that might work for you."
