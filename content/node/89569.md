  think they look cool, but do they read ok to Scandinavians?"

  body: Yup, I'm with Frode on this one. In special tabloid newspaper and celeb colour
    mags headline fonts often have this feature. Outside of these two examples it
    is not done.

    and credits it was interesting to see a joined \xD6, where the dieresis dots were
    joined to the top of the O, like a small pair of horns. It looked rather elegant.\r\n "

  body: "Another variant that I've sseen/used* for \xE5 and \xC5 is with the ring
    sunk down into the letter and a thin white outline between. Again, mostly a tabloid
    thing, but I think it works well enough.\r\n\r\n* I used to work at Expressen,
    the second-biggest Swedish tabloid."

  body: (Unreadably) bad. An incomplete ring might work better (like a breve or something)
    but essentially keeping the unweildy ring shape is the only readily legible solution.

    missing link between the Sami and the Finnic language groups, having retained
    more of the Proto-Uralic sound inventory than any other Sami language. "
