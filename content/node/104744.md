  Big Caslon or Patrician. Not too close. On another note, I cannot find any history
  on Patrician, does anyone know who designed it. I love the Ms and N's in the logo
  but am guessing they may have it customised. Any help is greatly appreciated.\r\nhttp://saturday-london.com/clients/dominic-jones/dominic-jones-packaging/

    part of it looks very close to (Big) Caslon... There are also some [[http://typophile.com/node/51142?page=1#comment-310076|rip-off
    accusations on some Scriptorium David Nalle's fonts]] so better avoid Patrician..."
