  can't recognize it. \r\n\r\nA letterpress printer friend of mine suggested it could
  be a customisation on Windsor or Hallamshire Old Style, but I think it maybe quite
  a big customisation for a book binder.\r\n\r\nThe book was published in London,
  around 1924.\r\n\r\nAny help on this is much appreciated,"

    It is probably something that was not used in the U.S., or I think it would have
    showed up in at least one of my books. It is not in the Jaspert \"Encyclopaedia
    of Type Faces\" or \"Rookledge TypeFinder\" either.\r\n\r\nCan I ask why you didn't
    post this in the part of the Type ID Forum for unsolved fonts?\r\n\r\nWhere I
    found your question is an area where I would not have expected to find open questions,
    as this category is supposed to be Solved ID's only. People rarely would be looking
    into the Solved ID section.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
