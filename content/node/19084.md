  body: "It was an unconventional Bodoni which Dwiggins worked on for a while but
    was never released publicly. It had the working numbers of #283 and #268.\r\n\r\nIt
    strikes me, perhaps, as a different sort of experiment with the marionette theory.
    I have images somewhere, I just can't find them at the moment. \r\n\r\nWhy are
    you interested?"

  body: "This is from my notes taken at the Boston Public Library. Transcribed from
    a hand-written letter which I thought to be a rough draft. There was no date on
    the note, but there are some numbers and proofs mentioned which could give hints
    of a date if I weren't too lazy to back track in my notes. When I was transcribing
    I did my best to keep all punctuation and words that Dwiggins used. The brackets
    are mine.\r\n\r\n- - - -\r\n\r\n[Pg. 1]\r\n\r\nWhen you spoke of turning the Modern
    Face Dept over to Rudolph you were not (I trust) warning me to keep my hands off
    that end altogether? Because I can\u2019t resist the temptation to twiddle with
    the idea behind the Bodoni-Didot experiment \u2013 I keep turning the picture
    this way and that to see how one might cure the trouble of the 268 efforts \u2018f\u2019
    and, consequently, cure the trouble in the Bodoni, which the 268 stuff paralleled
    too closely. There is a better letter than Bodoni in that pigeon-hole if one could
    only get salt on its tail\u2026 Maybe Rud\u2019s try fetches it, but I am not
    quite sure.\r\n\r\n\tThe word to describe all the Bodoni modifications \u2013
    Lino, Mono, even the Bauer \u201Coriginal\u201D \u2013 is stodgy. They make a
    book stiff and lifeless. I often want for a book the color and tone that a Bodoni-class
    type would provide, but can\u2019t get it with our present outfit. \r\n\r\n\tMy
    lead on this Dec 6 Packet\r\n\r\nAll this modified into a formula \u2013 not copied
    precisely from pen letters, but worked out in terms of a metal punch all the time.
    Judging from what came through in the 7 pt [ x x x ] there is a chance that a
    lot of this would come through, unseen, in 12 pt. You don\u2019t want to see it,
    as detail, but you want it to all build up into an influence that gives motion
    to the line.\r\n\r\n[Pg. 2]\r\n\r\nMy lead in this Dec packet is the action of
    a fine flexible steel pen. This steel pen action is quite close to the motion
    produced in a line of lettering by the buren on copper (to reproduce which \u201Clook\u201D
    was, of course, the yen behind the Didot types.)\r\n\r\n\tOne trouble of the Bodoni
    class of types, when they get together into words, is the [something unreadable]
    rigidity, of course, ruled lines and compass curves \u2013 but the main \u201Caction\u201D
    trouble is in the spring of the arches and loop-elements away from the stems.
    In all the Bodonis this motion is always ugly \u2013 all the fawn-like grace of
    a galloping cow. If one could only get a type-metal equivalent of the nervous,
    pen-formed action in these places (i.e. the free-hand motion properly modified
    to fit type conditions, so it can be repeated all over a page without giving you
    [gum, gem, gun ?] jams) I think the letters would swing together into words and
    march. Getting a curve-formula that is both free, and yet not so free that it
    is unsuitable for type, is the job.\r\n\r\n\tThe actual 12 pt is the only way
    to tell whether a curve-formula works or not, but after our success with 7 pt
    2[big space, might have not finished writing] where such a formula certainly did
    work, I think there is a way to get life and nervous motion into the Didot kind
    of letter and still have it suitable for body-matter set.\r\n\r\n\tAnyway, here
    is another crack at it \u2013 and you can put it aside, or try it, just as you
    think best.\r\n\r\n\tYour eye will light on these details \u2013 swelled stem,
    such as a fine soft pen makes (Didot did it), stem not too rigid: motion in it
    \u2013 trick with serifs, something like our one-time \u201Cbutterfly tie\u201D
    idea; aiming to get a sharp click of serif, and yet not rigid.  \u2013 the pen-snap
    \u2013 in the arched element --"

  body: "I can't find anything on the name ... yet. The problem with finding too much
    info on this subject is that I didn't focus on this typeface in my dissertation.
    I do believe I have more information, it is just a matter of finding it.\r\n\r\nFrom
    the notes I have here, it began as #268 on/around March 18, 1942 and ended as
    #283 on July 18, 1945. The fact that there was any sort of type design happening
    during the war is amazing to me anyway. But, I think Linotype might have been
    looking toward the future. \r\n\r\nIn the notes I have C.H. Griffith seems positive
    about the type as it is being developed. The drawings were returned to Dwiggins
    with a letter dated October 11, 1945 by Helen Jagau, C.H. Griffith's assistant.
    Note these were the A-Z cap italic drawings. I need to find my proof notes. I
    don't recall if this was completed or not. She states with these drawings and
    #269 (Eldorado), \"Mr. Griffith suggests that you put these away pending such
    time as we are able to proceed with the cutting of the experimental characters.\"\r\n\r\nIn
    a letter written sometime in 1942, Dwiggins refers to it as \"268 Didot-Bodoni,
    9 pt.\" So even at this time the name had yet to be given. Further on in the letter
    he states, \"A new statement on the theme, but no soap yet.\" They were still
    working on it and he had yet to see it take full form.\r\n\r\nI believe I have
    a folder with information from Dwiggins archives at Kentucky in my notebooks at
    home. Mi dispiace. I'm sorry that I haven't gotten to this yet for you.\r\n\r\n"
