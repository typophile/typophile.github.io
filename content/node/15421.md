  convict themed book and I want to suggest, using a handrawn typeface, typefaces
  of the 1850s, especially those specifc to Australia. My question is, does anybody
  know of some good online type librararies or examples which would help me get a
  feel for it. Apologies if this is an oft-asked question,\r\n\r\nNick"

      the links\r\n\r\nIn other, and slightly related news, what do we think of the
      typeface for Nick Cave's new movie 'proposition'?"

    body: "yeah it could have been pushed further, but I kind of like it because you
      don't get that \"it's a period font\" on first glance, but it makes you take
      a second look and think \"hmm, somthings NQR\". Kind of unsettling and subtle
      (unlike the movie). Although they could've done something better with the placement
      of the writer/director's names, annoying mix of modern and old, pick one look
      and go with it I say.\r\n\r\nPeter Carey's new covers? interesting I think,
      reminds me of something I can't quite put my finger on\r\n\r\nhttp://www.randomhouse.com.au/WEB_ASP/ttle_detail.asp?ISBN=1741660041"
