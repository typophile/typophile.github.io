body: Anyone having problems with their laptop? My screen went blank last yr after
  using it a few months and had to be sent for repair. I think it's happening again.
  It jsut suddenly blacks out but is still on though. Any ideas what it could be?
  Do you think I need a new battery? Or does my screen need repairing?

  body: "I suggest you take a direct approach to fix the problem beginning with a
    call to Apple tech support. If it's the same issue that occurred previously and
    was sent to them for repair, even if it is now out of warranty they will most
    likely fix it. Sometimes it's just a simple fix you can do that they will instruct
    you over the phone such as resetting the PRAM or PMU switch. (Worst case, the
    blank screen sounds like possibly a logic board or inverter cable problem, not
    the battery.) \r\n\r\nIf the screen still works at times, you might want use this
    opportunity to backup all of your important files onto DVDs or a backup drive.
    Most likely you'll be sending the laptop out  for repair."

  body: "Yup, the screen brightness is to maximum and someone on another site said
    I should try and reset the PMU. Now what is a PMU and where is it and how do I
    get to it? lol :D I immediately started backing up my work on to an external hard
    drive but I need to work on it this week because it is emergency because I have
    my final assesment on Thursday. Any ideas if I could get it done at my nearest
    Apple store? My nearest is Trafford Centre, Manchester. Do you think taking it
    in will help or will I have to send it to the main place? I think I will definitely
    be ringing Apple but there has been problems for other users too. See this link:\r\nhttp://store.apple.com/Apple/WebObjects/ukstore.woa/wa/RSLID?mco=6C04E0B8&nplm=M9756\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Well, I had a similar problem once: screen was flickering sometimes for approx.
    2 months, I could \"fix\" it by moving the display in its hinges during that time.
    Then, suddenly, the screen went totally black. To blame was the backlight of the
    display or, more specifically, the inverter unit for the backlight. It was fixed
    in 2 hours after the replacement unit had arrived at my local apple shop.\r\nGood
    luck with your screen. And if it gives up and you can't afford to have it repaired
    due to time limits, try using an external monitor (at least that's what I did)..."

  body: I never knew they repair at the local store. Thanks :) I've never been to
    one mind you. I have been doing it over the phone and online. Thanks for your
    help everyone :) It survived my finals for this yr :) but it could let me down
    again so I am going to fix it. By the way, how do i attach an external moniter.
    Would it have to be an Apple moniter? I have no clue what-so-ever. Please could
    someone take me through the steps :)
