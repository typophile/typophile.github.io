body: "My system (mac os x, latest) is displaying bold/strong/big fonts everywhere
  in a strange way recently. It looks like this: \r\n\r\n[[http://cl.ly/GbCj|example
  one]]\r\n\r\nI'm trying to ID the \"new\" font. Any help? It should be Arial Bold,
  but it's not -- note the tapered apostrophe, which should be a straight rectangle.
  Here's another example:\r\n\r\n[[http://cl.ly/GbVk|example two]]\r\n\r\nAgain, the
  letters look slightly rounded when in the past they have been blocky, like Arial.

  body: It's Arial Bold, but the letters have been doubled up and offset to make it
    bolder, the trick that is used in some cases when there is no bold font. In this
    case it may be that the "bold" style was applied to Arial Bold, in effect double-bolded.

  body: "Thanks for the help -- I think you're right about it being Arial, but this
    still looks strange to me. Until recently the apostrophe would not have been tapered,
    it would be a rectangle, and the letters would not be rounded at all. I say it's
    \"my system\" because it's appearing like this in all applications, not just web
    pages. Anyone know what could be causing this?\r\n\r\nEDIT*** -- Fixed! For some
    reason, the italic, bold, and bold italic styles of Arial were disabled in my
    Font Book. I reenabled them and all is back to normal. Thanks guys! That was killing
    me =P"
