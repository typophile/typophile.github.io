  body: Those were fun, and appalling. Seems like one series is responsible for all
    the most heinous ones.

  body: "Not sure why the Alice one made it into that selection, overall I quite like
    the Vintage series of covers (this might not be right up there but it is designed
    to be a pair with another modern book). There is a nice set of Arthur Ransome
    Swallows and Amazons covers that use an orange sail.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=vintage+classic+twins\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: Many of these books are past the copyright date, so anybody can now publish
    them. I suspect many are POD (print on demand) books.  I'm not sure if the bad
    covers are just the result of ignorance, or the publisher is trying to appeal
    to a different audience than traditional (quality) publishers, or these  covers
    are a weird way of generating clicks with the associated search engine status.
