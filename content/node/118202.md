  body: "Thanks for the reply. Spectrasound is like IMPACT but it's not quite right.
    The O's are very different and I need to replicate the style using the text 'FOREVERMORE'
    which obviously features a few O's. The closest I have found is Helevetica Neue
    Condensed Bold but it's not exactly right either as it needs to be more compressed
    and taller.\r\n"

  body: "CoyoteJames, I don't see a major difference between the O in your sample
    and Impact. Keep in mind, your image appears to be a bit distorted:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Impact_4184.png]"

  body: "Okay, it appears your sample has a larger counter in the O than Impact has.
    If you substitute Impact's zero for its O, it is still a good approximation.\r\n\r\nPlacard
    MT Condensed Bold is another option:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/placard-mt/\r\n\r\nor
