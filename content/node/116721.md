  body: 'It''s similar to Morris Fuller Benton''s Stymie Obelisk, but it''s not exactly:
    the flyer says 1894, and ATF didn''t release Stymie Obelisk until 1931 or so.'

  body: "Skeleton Antique by Marder, Luse & Co, Type Founders, Chicago, first shown
    in _The Inland Printer_ October, 1887 -- a few years before your poster. Here
    is a complete alphabet from a later specimen\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SkeletonAntique@PhillipsOFTB_SM_4419.jpg]\r\nThere
    are minor variations in the letter - forms of the punches cut for different point
    sizes, but the distinctive g is more or less present in all of them.\r\nAFAIK
    it is not digitized.\r\nDon"

  body: Thanks, Don and Mike. There are little differences between the sample and
    the specimen, which make me wonder whether foundries provided the metal or something
    else. Maybe improvements or changes were made after the specimens were published.
    What explains the differences?

  body: "Mike, not really a Clarendon, more like an emaciated version of the slab
    serif that we now label as Egyptian but was labelled as Antique in the 19th century.\r\nStinkyfoot,
    Marder developed this font but others would have copied it by a process known
    as electrotyping and sold it as their own. A physical process similar to the electronic
    ones now used for stealing digital fonts and selling the clones. Font forgery
    was thriving then as now. \r\nAs for the variation in the g, as I mentioned in
    my post this is most likely due to the fact that Marder almost certainly still
    cut the different font sizes by hand in 1887. \r\nIdentity between different font
    sizes became possible with invention of the font pantograph by Linn Boyd Benton
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linn_Boyd_Benton which gave his company, which went
    on to be part of the core of ATF an edge over competitors like Marder which did
    not adopt the machine until a few years later.\r\nBTW this is not to say that
    Marder felt at some stage that the g was sufficiently off that it should be recut.
    Or someone tinkered with their stolen version.\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "Good find! I see Holly Goldsmith based the digital font on \"letterpress-printed
    specimens of 96-point, antique metal type.\" That's a really big poster size version.
    Note the respect the digital font shows to the differences of details between
    sizes in the original. For example, note the changes in the ear of the _g_. The
    size I posted, at 42 point, would fit between her 24 and 96.  \r\nDon"

  body: "Popular metal types were often recut by woodtype foundries. Marder's Skeleton
    Antique No. 2 received this treatment. The result is included in Flat-it's digital
    Dharma and Rama Slab families http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/dharma-slab/
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/rama-slab/ Stroke widths, serif thicknesses
    and distances are more regularized than the MVB interpretation, but the condensed
    versions of Dharma and Rama Slab are very similar to Skeleton Antique No. 2. Dharma
    \ Slab has seven weights. Rama Slab has six weights. Could be tinkered with to
    make different weights of Skeleton Antique No. 2.\r\nDon"

  body: Thanks, Don! Rama Slab will work for me, and I found a seller that Flat-It,
    the maker of Rama Slab, links to that offers an unlimited-page-views license for
    Rama Slab. How did you find these two families?
