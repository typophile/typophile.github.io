  Lust/Lust Display/Lust Script Display or Lust Script Regular. I'm trying to develop
  an eye for pairing myself but it's nice to hear other people's opinions on what
  does and doesn't work.\r\n\r\nI would really appreciate any suggestions."

    and explain where you feel they are coming up short? It would give the rest of
    us an understanding of the problem you are trying to solve and the paths you've
    already explored and found unfruitful.\r\n\r\n//jac"
