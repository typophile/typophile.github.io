  target="_blank">http://www.sunsetmarquishotel.com/</a>&#41;, specifically the text
  &#34;Unique. Even by Hollywood standards.&#34;, in the black main content area.

  body: Hmmm... 3 minutes. Not too shabby. ;&#41; <BR> <BR>Welcome to the board, Silus.
    Does our reputation stink that badly?

    &#34;lively&#34; at times, and it&#39;s just a smallish outfit... so I was just
    being careful. <BR> <BR>: &#41; <BR> <BR>Avenir, lovely indeed. <BR> <BR>Thanks!
    <BR> <BR>On a side note, what&#39;s your take on Adobe&#39;s OpenType version
    of Avenir?'

  body: Didn&#39;t have the chance to try it out yet,  <BR>unfortunately, and I&#39;m
    not planning to purchase a  <BR>license in the near future. The version we have
    a  <BR>license for at work is the regular PostScript, and I  <BR>doubt we will
    upgrade. <BR> <BR>We get lively too, but it seldom turns nasty. Just  <BR>don&#39;t
    ask us if you can steal all our fonts, and  <BR>also don&#39;t forget to ask nicely.
    =D

    I should give the meanies a talkin&#39; to.

  body: I don&#39;t get it. When&#39;s the last time anyone of us  <BR>turned nasty
    on the type ID board, really? Except  <BR>after being turned into koeiekat food
    or cannon  <BR>fodder that is, but they brought it onto themselves. <BR> <BR>Boy,
    what did we do to deserve this bad rep? <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif"
    ALT=":-&#40;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>BTW Stewf, just for laughs, who exactly are those
    <BR>meanies you were thinking of? C&#39;mon, tell us! =D

    answer that question.

    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>I mean, I came to the boards hat-in-hand because
    of some experiences on _other_ boards that weren&#39;t all that positive... not
    because of anything I&#39;d heard about you-all. <BR> <BR>In fact, Joshua Lurie-Terrell
    over at Typographi.ca recommended your forum without hesitation. <BR> <BR>So,
    um, don&#39;t sweat it!
