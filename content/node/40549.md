body: "Hey Guys,\r\n\r\nLooking for a new font with the following specs to use for
  a Client logotype:\r\n\r\nThe specs are as follows:\r\n\r\na) Must be a lowercase
  sans-serif font\r\nb) contemporary\r\nc) similar in look to Frutiger font\r\nd)
  some distinctive element (maybe in the ascenders/descenders etc)\r\n\r\nAny help??\r\n\r\nI
  guess as a designer i have exhausted my ability to look at fonts as for the past
  4 days i have been going through FontFont,Emigre,Adobe and Linotype sets....so i
  a bit saturated..\r\nI was thinking dax or interstate but have overused those altogether
  so quite keen on something new!\r\n\r\nseeming you all are so good with your opinions
  and feedback was hoping maybe some of you could make suggestions to fonts for this
  purpose\r\n\r\nLinks to samples and sites for purchase also appreciarted!!\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\nRobby\r\n\r\n"

    and FF Dax could be considered very different in style. So I'll assume your requirements
    are loose and point you to some underused contemporary sans serifs.\r\n\r\nI know

    fonts are quite out of date...some of the suggestions you made are Supa!!\r\n\r\nThanks
    so Much....\r\n\r\nI was not referring to Dax and I'state in context of Frutiger....just
    in terms of the general fact that they are really over used (esp by me!! lol)
    so was trying to stray away.\r\n\r\n\r\nto Poms: CorpID seems awesome..though
    too similar to Frutiger...will give it a go either way.\r\n\r\nThanks so much
    again for advice given!!!"
