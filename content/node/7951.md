  body: Ooh, thanks. Good suggestion. I&#39;ll put that on my list. I&#39;m overdue
    to post a new installment, too. <BR> <BR>Heh, I&#39;m a fan of Clancy Brown &#40;they
    guy who plays the preacher&#41; since he was in Earth 2 in the early nineties.
    It&#39;s nice to see him do something other than the voice of Mr. Crabs on Spongebob.

  body: I also quite enjoyed the Typecasting piece, along with the other article on
    the Scourge of Arial. I and my type geek friends &#40;we&#39;re all amateurs,
    really&#41; enjoyed them very much. If you have any other ideas for articles cooking
    in the back of your head we&#39;d love to see them.

  body: Thanks, guys. I would write more, but it&#39;s hard to come up with good ideas
    for the articles. Plus the fact that I write rather slowly, not to mention distractions
    like Typophile and Typographica. The main thing is that I&#39;m trying to spend
    more of my time actually making fonts. I tend not to get much of that done when
    I&#39;m in writing mode. In the mean time, I started a blog &#40;the Notebook
    section&#41; last summer where I can write shorter things more often and still
    work on fonts.
