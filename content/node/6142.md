body: Is there any reason why a font cannot be priced according to industry segment?    <BR>   <BR>For
  example, if I wanted to release a font with three price tags &#40;say, free for
  non-commercial use, $whatever for commercial companies and $outrageous for industries
  I do not wish my work to be associated with &#40;nuclear, oil, military, whatever&#41;
  to act as a deterrent.   <BR>   <BR>Is there anything to stop this? Other than issues
  of enforcing it?

  body: 'Tiered pricing does already exist, and I actually think it can work. But
    it opens up a world of complexity, and most of all if you discriminate against
    a very narrow -and subjectively arbitrary- segment, you&#39;ll be seen as &#34;unprofessional&#34;.
    Even among potential clients who share your dislike for the segment you&#39;re
    discriminating against, you will generate a certain degree of uneasiness, to say
    the least. The overarching unwritten rules of capitalism go against such personal
    choice. In effect, personal choice is limited to the <i>consumer</i>. <BR> <BR>Plus
    that type of thing could be illegal/non-binding in certain jurisdictions. <BR>
    <BR>BTW, enforcing is actually less of a problem the larger the client: following
    the letter of the law is in their blood. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: well, the full idea is probably even more &#34;offensive&#34; to those unwritten
    rules, Hrant. The intention is to donate the different between the two license
    prices to lobbying or activist groups against those industry segments.  <BR> <BR>So
    if a Commercial license was $15, and a license for the nuclear industry was $300,
    then $285 gets donated to Greenpeace, etc.

  body: :-&#41; <BR>Or you want to ramp it up some more? <BR>In the nuke-specific
    license, keep the price the same $15, but require that <i>they</i> donate the
    $285! <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>
