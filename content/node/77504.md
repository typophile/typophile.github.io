body: "Hello dear typophiles,\r\n\r\nI would like to thank everyone for the great
  advice and positive feedback here at Typophile. Since I discovered Typophile, less
  than a year ago, a new world has opened up for me. My skills as a typedesigner have
  excelled, and more importantly, my love for type has never been so great. I hope
  I haven't been to much of a fool with some misplaced posts here and there. Enough
  said. MERRY CHRISTMAS!\r\n\r\nJasper\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/merryxmas_5363.jpg]"
