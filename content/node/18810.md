    <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&searchby=manufacturer&displayfontid=ITC.100337.0.0\"
    target=\"_blank\">Frankfurter</a> which has a highlighted version that looks similar

  body: Funny, today I stumbled upon a font I knew existed a long while ago - but
    remembered this thread. So because the font Quicksilver digitally is difficult
    to come by if at all, I found Neon Lights http://www.dafont.com/neon-lights.font?text=PMC
    -- and thought I'd update this thread if someone else was in need of help trying
    to find a font to match.
