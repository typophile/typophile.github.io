  the image of a shell alphabet that I designed a few years ago, the thing has gone
  a little wild on my side. Just  few days after I got all sorts of emails asking
  about the project,... publishers, buyers, curious people, all very nice and surprising
  to me.\r\n\r\nBut very litle feedback or critique about the project perse. So I
  decided not to loose the momentum and submit this links to you, with the objective
  to gather some critique, comments and feedback. Please. Feel free to say whatever
  you think about it. \r\n\r\nhttp://ilovetypography.com/2008/08/18/sunday-type-ornament-type/\r\nhttp://www.typeneu.com/2008/08/19/a-tribute-typeface-for-galicia/\r\nhttp://giovannijubert.com/portfolio/Giovanni_Jubert/Shelfish.html\r\n\r\nThank
  you!\r\nG."
