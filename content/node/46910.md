body: "Whenever I go downtown, to the cbd actually, I tend to get overwhelmed by the
  crowds, the traffic, and the impending sense of doom that generally comes along
  with visiting the crime capital of the United States. Over the past week, however,
  I've made it a point to head out there for some daytime visits. I approached my
  adventures more as a tourist rather than a native, attempting to throw out all previous
  knowledge that swirls in my head when considering even venturing there. By clearing
  my head and becoming and observer I noticed many different things about my city
  that I had not noticed before. \r\nThe architecture and design that embodies the
  majority of buildings of the cbd is astounding. Taking the time to notice the detail
  in the old fonts, the small pieces of art work that decorate the walls, and the
  fine attention to detail is reminiscent of a time when people actually cared enough
  about their craft to include the fine details. Also, I noticed the new commisioned
  pieces for the street car (you should definetly check them out, they're all over
  the place. I think that it's the same person that did the fish project.) Anyway,
  from my visit, downtown gained a little more respect from me...\r\nIt was, however,
  a disappointing feeling in the aspect that people have lost a sense of   beauty
  in design..   "

  body: 'Louie you are right about people losing the sense of beauty in design. It
    seems people only tend to care about the money that they are getting paid for
    the work and not the beauty of creating something. I really do like the streetcars
    that they have throughout the city and I do believe that the same person who did
    the fish did the streetcars as well. I just hope that the streetcar that the 2008
    senior class of Loyola has an awesome street car just like the rest of the ones
    in the city. '

  body: "Louie,\r\nI wish you had taken some photos of what you were looking at in
    the CBD. I am sure people who have never been to this area and may never go would
    like to see the fine details and craft that seems to be dying as technology advances.
    Christilisa is right that most people are too busy to slow down and hire someone
    to make something long lasting and beautiful. Remember this when you are designing
    your next project. Take time for the small details.\r\n\r\nAlso, if either of
    you are interested in helping with the design of the 2008 senior class street
    car at Loyola, let me know! I have been bombarded with emails by the head director
    of this project. They are desperately looking for some good designs. How about
    a typographic street car? Let me know if you are interested!"
