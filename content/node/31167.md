  here...and perhaps find a solution to my dilemma.\r\nMy profession is as a professional
  calligrapher however I have taken on a job of digitally addressing envelopes.\r\nI
  will be using a 'script,' most likely Diplomat or Bickham script and wish that I
  could find a set of roman numerals that offer various slants/angles to match that
  of the font I ultimately use.  Italicizing any of the roman fonts doesn't quite
  cut it, since italic is about 75 degrees and the scripts are somewhere between 45
  and 60 degrees.  I'll attach a picture in case I'm not being clear.\r\nDo any of
  you know if such a collection of roman numerals exists out there in the type world?\r\nThank
  you in advance,\r\nKelly\r\n"

    body: "Thanks Andreas, for your reply. \r\n \r\nYes, I am thinking that that is
      the way to go - to basically creat a graphic that will be included in the database
      that FileMaker will print the envelopes from...and hope that FileMaker does
      not have an 'issue' with that approach.\r\nOtherwise I will print those items
      that require roman numerals straight out of InDesign and skew them to match
      the chosen font's angle.\r\n\r\nI did look at Gracia but could not locate the
      roman numerals...?\r\n\r\nKelly\r\n\r\nKelly"
