  of orange I'd love to be able to pickout and know what shade of orange, coral is
  for example.\r\n\r\nI have an Iphone app by Pantone colorastrology but its more
  of a random color calendar and makes it hard to study.\r\n\r\nLove to be able to
  get my hands on a book or website that shows the names in some detail of color on
  a color wheel or something like it etc\r\n\r\nAny help would be great\r\n\r\nPS.
  I've been told that the book Interaction of Color by Josef Albers is one of the
  must have books when it comes to color. Not sure if it covers the naming of color
  etc what I am after, any other recommendations links would be appreciated."

    Zinc White is the colour of zinc oxide and thalo blue is the colour of Pathalocyanine.
    There is no ambiguity because one is referring to colours of pigments that remain
    consistent all the time. \r\n\r\nBut in the design world, names of colours, such
    a coral are too ambiguous and subjective to be useful. There is no common benchmark
    for what they mean. As a matter of interest, different suppliers of materials
    for the sign industry have the same or similar names for some very different colours.
    One company's sunflower yellow is Pantone 116, another's is close to Pantone 130
    which is more orange than yellow. You can never specify a colour by a descriptive
    name, you always have to use an industry standard such as Pantone, hexidecimal,
    RBG or CMYK values. My sky blue could be your tropical blue, but Pantone 299 is
    always Pantone 299. \r\n\r\nI'm sure the Pantone site will have some resources,
    but here are some sites I've bookmarked to play around with:\r\n.. <a href=http://www.cbu.edu/~jvarrian/applets/color1/colors_g.htm>
    Additive Color Applet by S.Kamikawa.</a> \r\n.. <a href=http://www.colortools.net/>

    or [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variations_of_green|<cite>green</cite>]] for
    example on Wikipedia you'll see various shades of colour with names that might
    be useful. However quite a number of these are 'unsourced' so I don't know how
    they have attributed those names or how widespread they might be.\r\n[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#HTML_color_names|This

  body: "Color naming is about as far away as you can get from exact science, which
    makes it interesting to study on other levels. It's highly culturally specific
    too. For example the boundary between green and blue differs between different
    cultures/languages, or the importance of differentiating light and dark blue.
    And it's interesting to see which hues are attributed their own names while others
    aren't (German for instance has a commonly used word for a certain very dark gray,
    <em>anthrazit</em>, which I realized when in Japan other cultures don't have a
    special word for).\r\n\r\nSo go ahead and learn color names, but if you want it
    to be practically useful, stay within <em>one system</em>, and one that makes
    sense to use in your specific context. \r\nJust be aware it's going to be one
    system, arbitrary like all the other ones. No god-becoming involved."

    a pure subset of graphic design, and there are many more of them than us (the
    ones that are both know how to be us). People hang out places, and make them the
    way they want them. Typophile being so open, it's very easy to imagine it becoming
    diluted, and eventually useless (at least to us).\r\n\r\nIf/when Photofonts becomes

    to help others. For me the thing that detracts from/dilutes Typophile is the number
    of posts asking for a quick response to a typographical challenge the person has
    not even tried to solve. But I guess everyone has to start somewhere and I guess
    I'm guilty myself too.

  body: "@hrant\r\nI disagree that color has nothing to do with type. I'd say that
    designing notan for a pure black text is different that designing notan for some
    yellow text, and if not the notan then certainly some of the optical effects that
    come into effect when using light on dark color schemes.\r\n\r\nHere's a connection
    to type:\r\nLeslie Cabarga wrote \"Learn Fontlab Fast\" and \"Logo, Font and Lettering
    Bible\", both highly recommended and respected books amongst typophiles.\r\n\r\nLeslie
    also wrote \"Designer's Guide to Color Combinations - 500 Historic and Modern
    Color Formulas in CMYK\" a FANTASTIC look at _real_ color combinations that exist
    in the real world around us.\r\n\r\nBut you are correct, this thread should be
    at least in the \"Design\" category."

    Pantone's naming of colours seems as ridiculous as what you see in the paint store,
