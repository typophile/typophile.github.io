  body: "I agree that it looks custom -- duplicate letters are not identical. \r\n\r\nFor
    font alternatives, that's a very subjective task, but I looked at Part 9 of the
    Script Font ID Guide, and thought \"Affable\" from Stoltz which is available at
    MyFonts had some of this feeling. You could also look at some of Ale Paul's Bluemlein
    Scripts at Veer.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
