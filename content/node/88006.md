body: "After developing an interest in typography over the last few years (I'm a web
  designer by trade), and plenty of sketching and practice with software, I've actually
  pulled together an almost complete set of alpha numeric glyphs.\r\n\r\nIt really
  is a simple beginning. A geometric condensed uppercase sans-serif, with no changes
  in stroke width, except perhaps for the 'X'. If anything it's been a great introduction
  to using typetool.\r\n\r\nI struggled somewhat with the 'M' and 'N', however feel
  that these ended up on the right track. The 'V' is a bit of a concern, possibly
  too close to the 'U'. Also I find the 'B' lacking.\r\n\r\nI'd love to get some expert
  criticism. Your thoughts, comments and brutal honesty are welcome, and most appreciated.
  Is there anything I'm really missing the mark on?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n"

    want diagonals in your font or not.\r\nX and Y look like they are from different
    fonts.\r\n\r\nMy opinion is you should get rid of the diagonals.\r\nTry to build
    the X with the upper part of the Y. The Z could look similar to the 2.\r\nThe
    (vertical) leg of the R could have a similar joining like in M.\r\n\r\nAnd maybe
    E, F and 3 could do with slightly longer crossbars."

  body: "Set your letters in words and phrases. That will help you decide if, for
    example, the spaces that open up with /C/J/L/T/7/ are okay, or need adjustments
    to fill in the blank spots (as I suspect).\r\n\r\nI think if /B/D/N/ etc. have
    a hard upper left corner, I would expect the same from /P/ and /R/. \r\n\r\nAn
    asymmetrical /Y/ (with a bottom like that of /J/) could work here.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't
    throw out diagonals just yet, but I agree that it may be the most pressing question
    you have to decide. It might help with the /V/ problem you identify, and help
    you develop a /K/ and a more convincing /2/."

    way ;-)\r\n\r\nHave a look at <a href=\"http://www.fonts.info/info/en_iwan-reschniev.htm\">Iwan
    Reschniev</a>, it\u2019s similar to your design, mixed with more diagonal forms.\r\n"

  body: I think the X is subtly brilliant. It's a departure from the construction
    grid, but somehow cleaves to the spirit of the face anyway, and I think you'll
    find that it works surprisingly well in the context of words. V is begging for
    a similar treatment. Z, however, hasn't captured that essence yet. Explorations
    I would suggest to achieve this include pointed corners or rounded ones.

  body: "Awesome feedback! Thanks everyone! Where do I start? :)\r\n\r\n@cerulean
    - I agree the diagonal X, while a departure, still seems to work. I'm trying a
    diagonal V and X, however retained the original M and N (with some potential diagonal
    alternates up my sleeve). I've started the 'K' - but it's not quite there yet.\r\n\r\n@hrant
    - I think it it's sufficiently different from Industria. What do you think?\r\n\r\nSomeone
    has since pointed me to another similar face, Mekanik, that has a diagonal V (but
    not X), together with vertical M, N- http://www.identifont.com/similar?31A - not
    sure I'm into the rounded 'X' like that.\r\n\r\n@Linus - agreed the crossbars
    could be longer - I've already changed the '3' and will look at matching the 'F'
    with the 'E'\r\n\r\n@eliason - I've been playing around with a lot of words and
    sentences. Pretty happy with the results. I had since made some changes (based
    on some offline feedback), dropping the crossbars a touch, lightening the horizontals,
    lengthening terminals, and a much improved '7'. I think the new terminals go some
    way to addressing the space issues. I think I may drop the vertical arm of the
    '4' a touch too. I'm pretty happy with the '2'.\r\n\r\nAnother thing I need to
    work on is compensating for the perceived smaller size of some glyphs - adjusting
    the baseline and heights of 'A', 'C', 'G' 'O' etc. I'm finding this quite difficult.\r\n\r\nThanks
    everyone - I really appreciate all your advice. I'm on a massive learning curve!\r\n\r\nI've
    got a modified example here: http://finelysliced.com.au/progress/"

    cute when bars align, but it's monotonic and hurts legibility."
