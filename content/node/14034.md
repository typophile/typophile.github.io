  written as TeX in plain text, is a typesetting system created by [[Donald Knuth]].
  It is popular in academia, especially in the mathematics, physics and computer science
  communities. \r\n\r\nTeX is generally considered to be the best way to typeset complex
  mathematical formulas, but, especially in the form of [[LaTeX]] and other template
  packages, is now also being used for many other typesetting tasks.\r\n\r\n[[ConTeXt]]
  and [[XeTeX]] are other macro-packages of TeX and is used for [[Desktop Publishing]]."
