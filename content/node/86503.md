body: "hey guys\r\ni really want to know what's the difference between spacing and
  kerning.\r\ni have gone through many links but i still have doubts.\r\ni have deciphered
  the following from my studies.\r\n spacing should be done before kerning\r\nnow
  here is my main doubt, we <em>kern</em> after we space and hence we are changing
  the spacing between letter. so wont the overall spacing change.?\r\n\r\nCan anyone
  point me to some resources where it's explained properly?\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nM"

    kerning field in InDesign or Illustrator)\r\n \r\nTracking is used for many letters
    at once (i.e. on whole words like to space up a title made of small caps) and
    kerning would be to correct the space between a specific pair of letters. At least
    that's what I do :-)\r\n\r\nEm\r\n"

    work well, due to the shapes of the letters. \r\nSo for example in most cases
    HH, HT, HA will be set by the spacing and not require kerning, but TA will require
    a modification to the spacing, namely, a kerning pair."

  body: "hey guys\r\n\r\nthanks for the replies. HH, HT doesn't require kerning and
    i understand that. but TA requires Kerning. so we are changing the space between
    t and a.Wont this effect the space between H and T. In other words, we change
    the spacing using side bearings, don't we do the same in kerning? if not what
    are we changing in kerning? is the change made to spacing by kerning only exclusive
    to those pair of characters or does that influence other letter pairs also?\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nM"

  body: Well, it depends if you are talking about creating a font or using one.  Making
    a font, you can have specific kerning pairs that are exclusive to that pair of
    characters.  This is different than side bearings.  If you are setting type, you
    can kern individual letter pairs and not affect other instances of that letter
    pair.  In setting type you also can have control of tracking which changes the
    overall horizontal letter spacing of all the selected text.

  body: "[[http://ericbank.com/2011/02/introduction-kerning/|Here is a decent explanation
    for the user of digital type, with graphics.]] \r\n\r\nIn designing type, yes,
    kerning numbers only apply to the pairs you specify, whereas the side bearings
    apply everywhere. The kerning adds or subtracts from the side bearings of the
    pairs you specify. (Actually I think it's only one of the pair, but that doesn't
    matter.)\r\n\r\nThe difference between spacing and kerning is not visual, but
    something the technology defines.  "
