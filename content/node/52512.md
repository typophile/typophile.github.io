  question is, I'm using image/text placeholders on masters pages, that I used to
  place contents in the document pages. I supposed this way I would be able to move
  the contents later using that frames placed in the masters. Until now is working
  fine and I can move things around controlling them from the master pages frames.\r\n\r\nThe
  problem comes when I add or move pages in the document, and the links between the
  page contents and master frames get broken.\r\nI'm using facing pages layout, and
  it seems to me that if i had started working with single pages layout this problem
  wouldn't occur.\r\n\r\nI've been reading some tutorials but couldn't find any answer
  on this.\r\n\r\nHope someone understands what I'm saying\r\n\r\nAny help will be
  much appreciated\r\nRegards  \r\n\r\n "

    it, a book/brochure? In that case, facing pages is definitely the way to go.\r\nYou
    can also have facing <strong>master</strong> pages, with different settings for
    the left and right page. Is that what you\u2019re loking for?\r\n\r\nNot sure,\r\nF"

  body: "Hi, kiko, I'm not sure I understand... However, I do know that the facing
    pages option can cause problems when you add pages to your document. It's probably
    better to turn that option off for the job you're working on.\r\n\r\nMaybe you
    can modify your current master pages so that you don't lose the work you've done
    so far."

  body: "<cite>Sorry, that is not a question. :-D</cite>\r\n\r\n\r\nups, maybe should
    have said \"the thing is...\" or \"what's happening is..\", Sorry ;)\r\n\r\nIt's
    a catalog with around 80 pages with images.\r\nYes, I'm using facing pages, and
    facing masters too, which only differ on the left and right header title. I placed
    graphic frame placeholders in both left and right pages of a master, that I used
    to place content (images) in the document pages. All works fine and I can move
    things on that master with exact results in the pages assign by it. The problem
    comes when I move or add another page, then the page graphics (images) get detached
    from the master frame placeholders, and I'm no longer able to control them from
    the masters.\r\n\r\nSorry, sometimes its hard to explain something (when for someone,
    sometimes it's not even a problem) when not speaking my mother language.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for trying to help\r\nRegards"

  body: "Kiko, I think I understand the problem, but I'm not sure I have the solution.
    The frames on pages lose the links to their corresponding Master frames when the
    page moves, due to adding or moving pages. \r\n\r\nI believe it only happens if,
    in the process of adjusting pages, any given page moves from being a Right to
    being a Left (or vice versa), even if only for a moment while other pages are
    being moved or added. Are you moving/adding in complete spreads only?\r\n\r\nI
    think the solution may have to do with *disabling* the Allow Pages to Shuffle
    command in the Pages palette. This makes it so that Right cannot become Left or
    vice-versa. And I think it will prevent your problem from happening. Just be sure
    you don't end up with single, floating pages in the middle of your booklet.\r\n\r\nOn
    the other hand, if you're changing a Right to a Left, or a Left to a Right, on
    purpose, then there's no solution, as it will then always break from the Master.\r\n\r\nHTH\r\n\r\n--
    K.\r\n\r\n"

    i understand what you're asking, no, I'm moving/adding pages individually not
    in complete spreads.\r\n\r\n<cite>I believe it only happens if, in the process

    that is what was happening here. I'll definitely try out your tip on disabling
    the \"Allow Pages to Shuffle command\". \r\nUnfortunately, I'm not in my computer
    right now, so I'll have to try it out latter.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for your help,
    and patience on trying to understand my problem.\r\n\r\nBest regards "

  body: "Problem solved, thanks again.\r\n\r\nApparently there are only two ways for
    managing this: one is adding pages in pairs only or moving complete spreads, the
    other way is disabling the \"allow pages to shuffle\" with the disadvantages of
    risking to get single pages floating in the document, as you said.\r\n\r\nRegards "
