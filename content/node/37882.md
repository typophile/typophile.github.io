  body: "Italics are a tough thing to ID for me, but this looks most like one of the
    versions of <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/bauer-bodoni/italic/\">Bauer
    Bodoni</a>. <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-acanthus/italic/\">FF
    Acanthus</a> is also very close. The character width of Acanthus seems just right,
    but the stem tops are flatter than the Bauer Bodonis. Most other Bodonis also
    seemed too flat on top of the stems. A few other somewhat close styles were ITC
    Esprit and Linotype Miramar, but various details, particularly the 's' shape,
    did not match as well as the Bodonis I have mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe versions of
    Bauer Bodoni I found seemed to have too long a tail on the 'i' and they seemed
    a bit too wide, both features that are closer in Acanthus. So I am guessing that
    there is a Bodoni version that I have not found. I think this may be more likely
    than a customized version, but who knows?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
