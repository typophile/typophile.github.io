body: "Having been intrigued by the nice glyph width chart on the <a href=\"http://www.fontbureau.com/nhg/features/#refined_spacing\">Neue
  Haas Grotesk</a> page, I could think of no better way to spend half this holiday
  than to write a Python script that will plot a glyph width histogram.\r\n\r\nThe
  results are, not surprising, that different digitizations differ wildly in their
  glyph unit systems.\r\n\r\nHere are some examples:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hist_sglt_4429.png]\r\n\r\nThe
  Linotype Stempel Garamond is based on a rough 18 unit grid.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hist_sgur_4553.png]\r\n\r\nURW
  Garamond No. 8 has something like 3 times 18 units, 54 units.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hist_sgbt_5623.png]\r\n\r\nThe
  Berthold digitization of Stempel Garamond uses a completely incompatible grid, i.e.
  48 units.\r\n\r\nThe same grids can be seen in the attached PDFs of different Univers
  digitizations.\r\n\r\nIf anyone is interested, I may clean up the Python script
  and make it available.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJens"

  body: Very nice. I've no idea about the 48-unit system, but seem to remember the
    54-unit system indicates the URW Garamond was fitted for photo-typesetting. The
    18 of course would match the Monotype unit system. (Was Linotype the same?) Interesting
    that nobody has re-fitted these typefaces for the digital world.

    dedicated systems followed metal, and computerized front ends allowed for a finer
    grid. When the transition was made to the desktop, various foundries probably
    saw no need to reinvent the wheel.\r\n\r\nIt's interesting how all of the Garamonds
    shown have the highest frequency of characters almost dead-center in the spectrum
    of widths. If one synched this spectrum to the visible spectrum, one might say
    that Garamond is a decidedly green style."

  body: "Ben \u2014 The original hot-metal Linotype did not require unitizing. \r\n\r\nBut
    when Mergenthaler developed its first phototypesetters, the stepping motor used
    for the character advance dictated some sort of unitization, and they adopted
    an 18-unit system, initially, because Monotype had already established that scheme
    so well.\r\n\r\nLater when a continuous mechanism replaced the stepping motor,
    the unitizing approach was refined to 54 units (3\xD718), which could accommodate
    more nuance, while still being backward compatible with 18-unit designs. \r\n\r\n[<em>Edit:
    Oops, the foregoing contains several errors. See below.</em>]"

  body: "Sorry, my memory failed me. I have details wrong in my previous message there.
    \r\n\r\nI found my correspondence from Matthew Carter on this subject. \r\n\r\nI
    had the mechanisms backward. The original Linotype phototypesetters utilized a
    <em>continuous-speed</em> writing prism. Horizontal positioning was achieved by
    timing the shutter opening and closing. For this reason, discrete timings were
    needed, hence a unitized system.\r\n\r\nMC said he thinks that the initial 18-unit
    system was adopted because of its precedence in the TTS newspaper system (which
    was probably influenced by Monotype\u2019s 18-unit system, but that\u2019s just
    speculation on my part). And newspapers were, of course, Linotype\u2019s bread-and-butter
    clientele.\r\n\r\nLater, the introduction of a stepping motor allowed <em>discontinuous</em>
    movement, which allowed a more refined system \u2014 even standing still, and
    thus zero-width characters, for complex scripts."

  body: 'As I understand it, the reason the (metal) Linotype system didn''t need to
    be unitized and the Monotype system did is that the latter essentially computed
    the spaces needed to justify the line, whereas the former used ingenious wedges
    to divvy up the space physically rather than mathematically. '

  body: "This is a complex topic and Nick Sherman and I are currently doing heavy
    research on it. Yes, Kent is right, a unit-system for Linotype fonts was first
    introduced with the TTS teletypesetting systems because those had to calculate
    the line length. A handful of Mergenthaler newspaper faces, spearheaded by the
    Legibility Group, were adjusted to the 18 units, mostly 15 different width with
    4 units being the smallest. So unitized and normal versions of the same typefaces
    were available. All other Linotype mats did not need to adhere to a unit system
    but we speculate that this principle might have found its way into the production
    of normal typefaces, too, maybe for practicability reasons? (Currently trying
    to find evidence for that.)\r\n\r\nLater in phototype, all manufacturers had their
    own unit system (the idea of incompatibility and dependence on a supplier was
    more or less the business model). Berthold used 48, the Lumitype 36, Monotype
    later 96 etc."

    anyway. Things might have changed under Burke \u2014 with more TTS and with nascent
