body: "I'm posting a new thread to prevent further disruption of the <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/43312\">thread
  on embeddable web fonts.</a> My posts on that one were disruptive and harsh, and
  I apologize to Typophile's members and moderators for that.\r\n\r\nMy sincere apologies
  to Sii for subjecting him to prolonged scrutiny. I can see now that I overreacted.
  Let's forgive each other and put it all behind us.\r\n\r\nI will be taking a break
  from Typophile over the next four months. I've got so much work on my hands I can't
  spare the time, and it pays to be pragmatic when grappling with the slippery dynamics
  of online fora. Life can be very strange at times. I've had eight of my teeth extracted
  in the past six weeks. That's six weeks of swollen gums and throbbing pain as the
  gums heal. I'll have dentures fitted around about May. A musician friend of mine
  is dying from cancer right now and it's making me miserable. Life can be very strange.\r\n\r\nBefore
  I depart, I want to thank the following people:\r\n\r\n* Tiffany for her good grace,
  marvellous judgement and big heart\r\n* Eben for his practical outlook and solid
  moderating skills\r\n* Stewf for his coolness and ongoing support of my type career\r\n*
  Dan Reynolds for his very existence---you're a beautiful person Dan and I like you\r\n*
  Nick Shinn, John Hudson, William and Hrant for their immense knowledge and experience\r\n*
  Ricardo and Chris Lozos for their generosity and wonderful humour\r\n* Linda and
  Patty for their great artistry and professionalism \r\n* James Puckett for his dynamism
  and obvious potential\r\n* Ben Mitchell and Jelmar for being great sponges and teaching
  me how better to teach type design\r\n* Darrel, Haley, Zara, Yves, Russell, Tim
  Daley, Paul Hunt, Sharon, Richard Kegler, Joshua and every other regular here---you're
  all wonderful people whose hearts are in the right place\r\n* Everybody else I've
  conversed with, whether we've agreed or disagreed, that's not the point. The point
  is it's all good. You are all good people who expand my mind and strengthen my heart\r\n*
  Most of all to Joe for making it all possible.\r\n\r\nI'll leave you with the words
  to the chorus from the Stone Temple Pilots song Still Remains, written by Scott
  Weiland. It's very significant for me right now because I don't know how long the
  repaired arteries inside my head are going to last. I'm experiencing head pains
  every time I cough lately. That's a bad sign, and if one of 'em bursts I'll probably
  die. I'm not kidding, nor am I making it up to get sympathy. Life can be very strange.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<em>Pick
  a song and sing a yellow nectarine\r\nTake a bath I'll drink the water that you
  leave\r\nIf you should die before me ask if you can bring a friend\r\nPick a flower
  hold your breath and drift away</em>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nWhile I'm away, please keep
  in mind one thing: It's the spirit of the rules that counts, not the letter.\r\n\r\nj

    how it works or if it would be appropriate for you, but if it's better to deal

    giving Joe what for except to make some points which either will or won't make
    sense to you. \r\n\r\nSome of this might sound like my trying to \"<a href=\"http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/118200.html
    \">teach your grandma to suck eggs\"</a>. But isn't meant as condescension. Instead
    I am trying to see if I can (re)establish common/shared ideas about this.\r\n\r\na)
    It's James' thread not Joe's and the more you ( or anyone ) pounds away at Joe
    the more it becomes about Joe albeit in a negative way.  To me this seems unfortunate.
    This was in part the reason I asked James to make his own thread - this thread.
    \r\n\r\nb) A very related point is that information which is too random/mixed
    becomes less valuable to the users of Typophile. Granted this isn't a Type heavy
    thread, (it's personal) but the point is applicable to Typophile threads in general.
    \r\n\r\nThis why the guidelines say <cite> Don\u2019t hijack other threads:\r\nDon\u2019t
    post irrelevant queries within another thread; create a new thread. You can post
    a new topic by scrolling to the bottom of one of the main forum pages and clicking
    on the \u201CPost a new topic\u201D link. </cite>\r\n\r\nb) James himself* is
    an advocate of avoiding extending conflicts bad feelings on Typophile or elsewhere.
    One way of extending these bad feelings is to reply to negativity with ire even
    if you are fully justified. \r\n\r\nd) That Typophile is a bit too full of \"pounding\"
    is in part why James is taking a break.\r\n\r\nTypophile will be the kind of place
    we make collectively it. \r\n\r\nAgree or disagree but please make a new thread
    about it if you want to reply to me. It's valid to link to that new thread here.\r\n\r\n*He
    can correct me if I am putting false words in his mouth when he gets back, but
    I I think I am very probably on safe ground here.\r\n"
