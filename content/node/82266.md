  body: Dymo tape embossers come in a variety of sizes. I have owned several, ranging
    from 1/4" to 1" tape widths; 3/8" is the most popular. The designs used in the
    earlier labelers were not exclusive to DYMO, but also available in other brands,
    including Avery, Labelmate, etc.. Later labelers from DYMO appeared to all have
    the same square-letter design. You can see what this one looked like by searching
    for the free font 'Punch label' (sorry that I don't know who to credit for its
    authorship). I would contact DYMO directly to find out where and how their designs
    originated. One thing I enjoy with these tape guns or labeling machines is sending
    different types of media through them, like heavy cover stock (cut into strips).

  body: When I was about nine years old, I had a toy printing press made by Mattel
    called a <a href="http://www.samstoybox.com/toys/Linoprinter.html">Linoprinter</a>
    that used embossed tape to set type which you would stick onto plastic printing
    plates. The letters came out backwards, of course. One of the more interesting
    uses of embossed tape that I can recall.
