  to learn as much as possible. costs dont matter though like everyone else i''d prefer
  an amazing school for an amazing price but if i am forced to take out a student

    As for looking for schools, it's not as easy to say \"if you want to be a great
    designer...go here\" that's sort of on you. Although, here are a few schools that
    tend to have good reputations.\r\n\r\nTyler School of Art\r\n(Paula Scher went
    there and possibly still teaches there? not sure)\r\n\r\nKansas City Institute
    of Art\r\n(Some famous people roll through there quite often, so it gets a good
    name)\r\n\r\nMaryland Institute College of Art\r\n(Mostly fine arts, but has a
    really good design program and a great reputation)\r\n\r\nIf you happen to make
    it out of the states, I recommend the Basel School of Design in Switzerland. Wolfgang
    Weingart still teaches there as far as I am aware...and if you get in a class
    with him, I'm sure you won't regret it.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I'd stay away from
    the art institutes or any school you see advertising you can become a designer
    in less than 2 years...they have bad reps and unless your portfolio is AMAZING
    after graduating, you risk being laughed at. This also stands for the Bradley
    Academy, which only gives you a 2 year degree anyway. (Even though I had one teacher
    from there at my school and he was amazing typographer)\r\n\r\nIn the end though
    pick a place where you feel like you fit in. You have to spend YEARS there, so
    mine as well have fun! I don't want to act like I KNOW what I'm talking about,
    I've never went to any of these schools. I'm just basing my opinion on the schools
    I have heard over and over since I started college. Good LUCK!"

  body: "I would look for a school with a good foundation program in design itself
    and not worry so much about digital art degrees, or their emphasis on technology.
    You've already learned photoshop and you can learn other programs at your local
    community college. What makes a good designer is their knowledge of design and
    its fundamentals, not their knowledge of the tools used to make it alone. While
    knowing how to manipulate the tools can make you very productive, it is nothing
    without knowledge of composition, color, etc.\r\n\r\nThe schools listed above
    are good, I would add Rhode Island School of Design in there, John Maeda is taking
    over as president and he is amazing. But it's pricey... also look into Cooper
    Union and School of the Art Institute of Chicago. I hear the latter's program
    is much more \"hands off,\" if exploring on your own is your thing.\r\n\r\nMy
    boyfriend studied art at University of Utah and is doing just fine now as a designer
    for video games, so, don't discount it too much. Oh, and last I heard, Savannah
    College of Art and Design wasn't accredited by the National Schools of Arts and
    Design, and I was warned way back when to stay away. "

  body: "thanx to both of you! I am actually into painting also so i wanted a good
    art based school but i was just see'n if certain schools are more known for digital
    arts and etc... and in the end if i make it into a school to where the teachers
    (some how) dont know much about photoshop and illustrator..etc the things ill
    learn from the painting and drawing classes will be a huge help either way since
    those programs are just tools that are supposed to simulate painting\r\n\r\none
    again THANX\r\n\r\nand if anyone knows how many pieces i should put into a portfolio
    that would be very appreciated. "

  body: "Well, the school you apply to will most likely give you a number of pieces
    they want to see as well as numerous guidelines, so just look into the school.
    It's also a good idea to get a sense of whatever every school wants to see so
    you don't spend too much time on other projects. \r\n\r\nMost art schools will
    want to see an example of hand drawing, some photography maybe...yea, I can't
    get too specific, because each school will have their own guidelines."

    choosing what school to goto to become a graphic designer\"\r\n\r\nWell, it sounds
    like you're hovering on the edge of fine arts vs. graphic design. Which is good.
    And that means you're going to want to aim specifically for an art school. Something
    that has a strong fine arts and graphic design program.\r\n\r\n\"Personally, I\u2019d
    stay away from the art institutes or any school you see advertising\"\r\n\r\nYep.
    Basically, any school that advertises on TV during the Price is Right or during
    the Cheers reruns after the 10pm news should be avoided at all costs ;o)\r\n\r\n"

  body: "You\u2019re already in Utah, so take a look at BYU, it puts out great designers
    and has a strong reputation. \r\n\r\nStay away from \u201Cdigital media design\u201D
    programs at art colleges. From what I\u2019ve seen the trade schools do these
    very well and have eaten up so much of the enrollment at art colleges that the
    art colleges are making promises they can\u2019t keep about teaching students
    to design for video, film, and video games.\r\n\r\nFind a school that participates
    in foreign study programs. You\u2019ll get a lot out of studying under designers
    in a different place.\r\n\r\nAs for your portfolio, what goes in will vary by
    where you apply. Some schools will send you a list of pieces to create, others
    will specify a range. One warning: most admissions departments don\u2019t want
    to see anything that even resembles anime/manga fan art. "
