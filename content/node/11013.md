  every day.  <BR> <BR>To me, Cronos looks substantially different to Today Sans,
  unmistakably a Slimbach design &#40;check out the lower counter of the &#39;g&#39;,
  similar to his Garamond, Warnock and Minion&#41;. The angled brushed-like ends of
  strokes, stronger modulation of stroke width, and abscence of annoying ink traps
  make Cronos the superior of the two in my book, and set it far enough apart to clear
  it of the above-linked charges.

  body: I think Cronos is different enough to make it too small of a fish to fry -
    there are some narwhals out there. But it does have some telltale signs of  <i>structural</i>
    plagiarism, and it would have been nice if they would just give due credit. That&#39;s
    all. <BR> <BR>&#62; annoying ink traps <BR> <BR>TodaySans&#39;s ink traps are
    pretty subtle, and this benefits any text face. Looking at a text face at 200
    pt is something a <i>reader</i> would never do. Don&#39;t believe those who say
    traps are unnecessary. All the <i>really</i> good designers use them &#40;when
    needed&#41;. Not using them might be economically smart for certain markets &#40;in
    the same way I think making smallcaps is largely pointless for most users, economically&#41;,
    but never technically so. <BR> <BR>&#62; superior <BR> <BR>I think in a vacuum
    Cronos could be seen as superior. Certainly its MM axes make &#40;or used to make&#41;
    it more versatile. But it is also less pure, and less original - less culturally
    significant. Which is what people remember. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    Design as a text face. The display face is Trebuchet... Cronos reads really well
    as a text face, owing to its &#39;humanist&#39; characteristics &#40;!&#41;. Cronos
    is also used for the brochure the publishing courses at Simon Fraser University
    in Vancouver. <BR> <BR>Cronos does work quite well with other Simbach&#39;s types.
    For my slab-serif paper I used Warnock with it. I got the Type Classics for Learning
    pack while I was still a student. It&#39;s terribly good value for some excellent
    types. A great way for a student to start up a really useful type library. <BR>
    <BR>Never thought Todays Sans was the source for Cronos, but now that you&#39;ve
    mentioned it, I do see the similarities. Hrant: just how does one measure the
    &#39;cultural significance&#39; of a typeface? I think it would probably take
    years for any type to become &#39;culturally significant&#39;... Cronos is still
    pretty young. So Todays Sans is culturally significant you say? Didn&#39;t realize
    that...'

  body: <i>But I would say that innovation is the main ingredient...</i> <BR> <BR>That&#39;s
    a Romantic view of culture. Without denying the role and importance of innovation,
    and the kind of individual genius that usually produces it, a Classical view would
    reject the idea that such innovation is the main ingredient. Rather the aggregate
    of human activity defines culture, and the most important element is not innovation
    but tradition, not individual genius but collective engagement &#40;civitas&#41;.
    As Ezra Pound said, in a rare moment of lucidity, &#39;Civilisation is not a one
    man job&#39;. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think it is possible to describe a typeface
    as &#39;culturally significant&#39; if no one is using it. And, yes, this does
    mean that Arial is a culturally significant typeface, proving that not all culture
    is good culture and that culture can exist because of commercial or technological
    accident rather than creative inspiration.

    more than one ethical issue here.  <BR> <BR>One is the question you consider:
    proper acknowledgement of inspiration for your work. When and where should you
    do this? I think it should be done, but if it has been, then repeating it in advertising
    material it seems to me is asking too much. <BR> <BR>The other ethical issue is:
    when it is legitimate to disparage another person&#39;s character? This is regarded
    as a grave sin in both Buddhist and Rabbinic ethics, even when what you are saying
    is true. In Rabbinic ethics, it is especially a problem when a person&#39;s professional
    reputation is being potentially stained. There are, however, occassions on which
    a compelling reason overrides this prohibition, such as that another person will
    be cheated if you don&#39;t speak, or a serious injustice will be perpetuated.  <BR>

    of his typefaces. Little like Zapf in some aspects, but in different results.
    I see more influence from Zapf and Schneider and others master calligrapher in
    Slimbach typefaces than anything else. If the people who kept going stupid accusation

  body: 'To my amateur typofile eyes, the italic of Cronos in the posted sample has
    a quite different structure than Today Sans. The roman is similar, but for example
    the bent tops of the &#39;r&#39; and &#39;n&#39; stems is also in Meta, which
    I think is earlier than TodaySans.   <BR> <BR>The larger question here is this.
    R.G. Collingwood, in his book &#39;What is Art?&#39; points out that the periods
    when the greatest work has been done, such as Shakespear in literature or the
    Renaissance in visual arts, the people took from each other pretty freely. The
    community is helping even the best people to be better. At the same time, people
    do need to get credit and earn money for what they have produced. How do you serve
    both these goals?  '

  body: The design of Cronos has not been <i>copyrighted</i>. It has been given a
    design patent, which is a limited protection &#40;14 years?&#41; granted to novel
    designs, based on a detailed submission that must include reference to &#39;prior
    art&#39; that may have influenced the design. I have not seen Adobe&#39;s patent
    submission for Cronos, but my understanding is that they acknowledged Today Sans
    as prior art. Is this giving adequate credit? I don&#39;t know. <BR> <BR>Hrant
    mentions that one of the defenders of Cronos hates Bill Troop because of an unrelated
    issue&#41;. It is worth bearing in mind that Bill Troop hates Adobe because of
    an unrelated issue. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve looked at Cronos and Today Sans pretty closely.
    The similarities are mainly in the proportion of the letters and in the overall
    appearance of text set in both. A page of text in Cronos looks a <i>lot</i> like
    a page of text in Today Sans. Comparison of the individual letterforms reveals,
    of course, all sorts of difference in detail and, as Jean-Fran

    trouble telling apart Times and Baskerville. <BR> <BR>But if it&#39;s true, that&#39;s
