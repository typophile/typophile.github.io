body: "There is a typeface called \"Prismania\" by Headliners Inc., which appears
  to look similar to \"Prisma\", a typeface available in Mecanorma/Letraset dry lettering
  catalogue. Also, there seems to be another typeface called \"Prismatic\" which revived
  by Mr. Nick Curtis.\r\nhttps://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/pentaprism-nf/\r\n\r\nAll
  of them appears to look the same except that Prismania and Prismatic have some alternates
  and variant designs...\r\nCurious which one is a knockoff of which?....\r\n\r\nPrisma\r\n<img

  another topic about \"Prisma\" but the sample posted seems to be slightly different
  (ie. 7)\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/84218\r\n\r\nThis topic shows some samples
  of \"Prisma\" and \"Prismania\"\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/80866\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
