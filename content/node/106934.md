body: "I wanted to show some images for my new release Baghadeer. The description
  was inadvertently left out on the page, but should be added soon. It should read:\r\nBaghadeer,
  from the hand of Stephen Rapp, is an upright connecting script brimming with personality.
  With its exuberant capitals, dashing crossover strokes, and rhythmic pulse; it retains
  the active spirit most associated with slanted scripts, but with the grounded presence
  of an upright.\r\n\r\nBaghadeer contains 780 glyphs featuring a plethora of swashes,
  ligatures, and alternate letters to individualize the look of your project. There
  is also a set of small caps and ornamental flourishes to add some finishing touches.
  It contains feature programming to make typesetting seamless and has all the language
  coverage you'd expect in a pro font. \r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/stephen-rapp/baghadeer/\r\n\r\nHope
  you like it. \r\nStephen\r\n\r\n"

    liquid and graceful.\r\nI'd be interested to hear where the name came from."

  body: The name is completely bogus. I just threw together something I thought would
    look good and stuck with it. So it's not a word at all.

  body: Stephen is the master at scripts. Baghadeer is truly a wonderful font. Plus
    it has Small Caps that are very useful. It's like 2 fonts in one. :)
