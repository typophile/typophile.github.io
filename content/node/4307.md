body: 'Just thought I&#39;d offer up a new item to critique. This is the light weight
  &#40;not the lightest&#41; of a new font I&#39;m working on. It&#39;s a monoline
  sans serif with a bit of modular modernism that I can see being used in magazines
  or other publications. <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t mind the weird curves on the 3, I&#39;m
  not sure why illustrator is messing up the curves, but it looks fine in FOG. <BR>
  <BR>Any criticisms are welcomed. <BR> <BR><!--attachment: variable_showing-33580.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*45.3*Variable*variable_showing%2epdf

  body: Soon, you will. <BR> <BR>I did a couple of test letters and the lightest weights
    look the best so far. The bolder weights are going to be much more work. <IMG
