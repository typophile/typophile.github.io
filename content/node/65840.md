    my article \"Latinization: Prevention and Cure\"* published in issue #4 of the
    Austrian magazine Spatium (as well as the 5th issue of the Greek journal Hyphen)
    and studying my \"multilateral\" solution for Armenian and Latin, a typesystem
    called Nour&Patria**. You could say it took me two decades to arrive at what I
    did; I think it works, and I hope it can inform the development of almost any
    multi-script type family.\r\n\r\n* A preview here: http://themicrofoundry.com/ss_rome1.html\r\n\r\n**

    first DECISION is that in Mike Hebrew font, the Latin should be subordinate to
    the Hebrew. Actually I thought this all along... but maybe not in words.\r\n\r\nHow
    should this effect the design of the Latin characters? Again it would be helpful
    to have explicitly formulated ideas on this. Much of it up to now has been intuitive.\r\n\r\nMike\r\n\r\n\r\nMichael

  body: "> How should this effect the design of the Latin characters?\r\n\r\nThe way
    I see it a subordinate font can sacrifice quite a bit of cultural authenticity
    - but only with the purpose of better serving the master design. So for example
    Patria's Armenian subordinate has full serifs (which the Armenian script really
    doesn't like). Another example is the Latin \"g\" below from a grot Cyrillic-dominant
    typeface I was commissioned to design last year. It's made to echo the form of
    the Cyrillic \"\u0431\".\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cyrlat_g_4412.gif]\r\n\r\nFor
    serving a traditional Hebrew type I might recommend a subordinate Latin where
    the stroke contrast is flipped (thicker horizontals than verticals*) but Mike
    Hebrew is monoline (which you could say makes things easier). Another central
    parameter is vertical proportions: Latin likes to have an x-height within a certain
    range, but to avoid a subordinate that looks too large/small in comparison to
    the master script you can move quite a distance away from that range; in the case
    of Hebrew that probably means a Latin with quite a large x-height (which you seem
    to be shooting for already).\r\n\r\n* See the work of Excoffon and Bloemsma.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nWilliam,
    depreciating the baseline is quite a fascinating idea.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: ">depreciating the baseline\r\n\r\nAda Yardeni in Hebrew Script points out
    that traditionally Hebrew is \"hung\" from the top, with the baseline not so strong.
    The baseline was made stronger in Ashkenazi scripts, perhaps under the influence
    of Latin scripts. \r\n\r\nMike Hebrew takes advantage of the fact you can play
    with the baseline in Hebrew without penalty--except for making nikud more difficult
    to place. \r\n\r\nPlayful designs like [[http://www.p22.com/ihof/peanut.html|Peanut]]
    (that link should work, the above does not) are able to get away with an irregular
    baseline in latin. I don't understand how exactly they are able to pull it off,
    but you might ask typophiler Michael Clark, who designed Peanut, about the challenge.
    \r\n\r\nBecause of the informal mono-line, I think potentially the latin can be
    very strong also, and still harmonize. This would be a real achievement, I think--to
    have a latin and hebrew that really work together seamlessly. If it were me, I'd
    start by mirroring your kaf and using that as a c, and building the look on that.
    As it is, the very round sans you have doesn't work at all, IMHO.    "

  body: "I have a lot of test documents in Hebrew with some English text.  \r\nMy
    first goal was to balance the size and boldness of the English so that it\r\nwas
    unobtrusive - usually acheived by having the Latin characters a little\r\nlarger
    and a lighter. The overall effect should be for the Hebrew to stand\r\nout on
    the page even when an English translation with more words will\r\noccupy more
    space\r\n\r\nIn no way did I want the Latin characters to look like Hebrew ones.
    \ I avoid\r\ngiving the shape of a Hebrew character to a Latin character.  My
    approach\r\nwas to make a small change in the Latin and then review all my test
    documents\r\nto see if there was an improvent.  For instance, the first change
    was to tilt the\r\ncenter bar of the lower case \"e\".  The change was carried
    out across the \r\nsix members of the font family. I was amazed that an improvement
    could be\r\nseen in the appearance of whole pages after such a small change! \r\n\r\nThe

    very narrow roman characters are of value in displaying translated text where

    a huge gap between latin and hebrew scripts. So better than many, but still far
    from being really harmonious. \r\n\r\nStylistically, they are very different,
    even though the monoline for both helps immensely. There are a lot of very successful
    squared off sans--my favorite is Klavika--and my feeling it that something like
    that would have a shot at more harmony.  \r\n\r\nI don't know about the squashing.
    I think it would be better to get them really harmonious. If squashing helps,
