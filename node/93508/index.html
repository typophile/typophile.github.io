<p>I attended a talk given by Steve earlier this year in New York and was impressed by his passion, focus and attention to aspects of type design and both traditional and digital typography. I understand your inferred bias but agree with both James and hrant that his hard work, passion and contributions to the world of fonts and typography merit that distinction.</p>

@Karl
I think you have completely missed the point here. I have nothing but the greatest respect for Steve but for Monotype to choose to use an information channel of a company that &lsquo;supports&rsquo; thousands of fantastic new and young designers for their own promotion is not a very intelligent way of the new company showing their support.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Janic - On the contrary, as the new player in the MyFonts game, I would immediately promote one of our own bright lights. This shows that yes, we have something positive to bring to the game. Makes positive business and marketing sense.  Myfonts has always promoted both new and experienced designers. Just go back and review the Myfonts News - every month they highlight a rising stars in one issue AND an old pro in another. Over the past year they&rsquo;ve had interviews with Chank Diesel, Nick Cooke, and Jeremy Dooley, among others. Given the organizational changes, Steve Matteson is probably the MOST APPROPRIATE designer to have been interviewed this month.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi guys, here is the person who decided, almost single-handedly, that Steve would be an interesting person to interview this month. There was no board meeting, no pushing, not even a hint from any of the people at Monotype – just a ‘sure, good idea’ from the rest of the MyFonts team during our weekly conference call. Steve had been on our (MyFonts’) list for a while, and we thought this was as good a time as any — a more ‘institutional’ designer from the US after a long series of interviews with very independent designers from Europe and Latin America. With, of course, the added benefit of his Monotype fonts now being available again (the Ascender fonts were on MyFonts all along). It did cross my mind that an interview with Steve right after the takeover could be seen as symbolic, but then I dismissed that thought: if we want to interview a great designer who has recently brought out one of his most interesting typefaces to date (Massif), then it’s silly to let paranoia get in the way. And while we, MyFonts, weren’t as calculating as Herb’s post suggests (it is mostly content, not business, that  underlies our decisions about whom to interview) we did think it was a nice occasion to present one of our new colleagues: an interesting guy, passionate about his work and with great hobbies. So to spell it out: decision-making about these things hasn’t changed at MyFonts. It’s still us.</div>
