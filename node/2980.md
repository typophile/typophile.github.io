body: I would be interested in discussing aspects of typography and typeface usage
  on pharmaceutical packaging - both prescription-based and OTCs. <BR> <BR>Helvetica
  is omnipresent, but I think we have a wider choice now. <BR> <BR>What aspects are
  most important? Legibility? Contrast? To what extent is the typeface&#39;s personality
  important in the success of the final project? Consider both large and small type
  on package. <BR> <BR>I would be grateful if someone knows resources and is willing
  to share. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>Marius Ursache

  body: Marius, my biggest complaint with pharmaceutical packaging isn&#39;t the type
    or the graphics, its the stupid names, that the general public don&#39;t get.
    I think the agencies who create the packaging would be better off spending more
    time and money researching names through focus groups. More generic names that
    have memory retention would require less advertising and brand recognition.

  body: 'Marius, <BR> <BR>There is an article in Baseline Magazine Number 34 2001
    called <b>Can packaging be honest?</b> The introduction is by Jeremy Myerson and
    the main text is by Frank Philippin. The discussion is wide ranging and interesting,
    addressing such considerations as how we shop, vision problems and information.
    Philippin reports on two redesign tests he conducted with older consumers one
    of which is Paracetamol packaging. <BR> <BR>Also the books: The Total Package,
    The Perfect Package and others. A search on Amazon should yield related titles.
    Search at you library &#40;Academic or Public&#41; for them and others too. Librarians
    can help lots when doing research like this. <BR> <BR>Jon'

    accepted, and associated with objectivity, hygiene, authority, trust --all the
    values that people expect from medicine
