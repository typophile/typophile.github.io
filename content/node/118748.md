  need a font very similar to this but which may be included with previous versions
  of Windows. It's like Viner HTC, but that is only included with Windows 8 and 8.1...\r\n\r\nThank
  you"

  body: It's not like Viner Hand - it <em>is</em> Viner Hand ITC. It was bundled with
    <a href='http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/font.aspx?FMID=1042' target='_blank'>these
    MS products</a>.
