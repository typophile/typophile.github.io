body: "I'm trying to run down the provenance of a particular typeface used in a series
  of steel sign letters. It's a distinctive face, but I'm not sure exactly which one
  it is; I suspect that it hails from the late 1800s to the early 1900s, but have
  no more information than that.\r\n\r\nThe sign letters are \"SANTA FE,\" and have
  the following features:\r\n\r\n- The letters are serifs, with half-serifs used in
  the upper-left of the N, on the crossbar of the T, the arms of the F and E, and
  the upper and lower ends of the S;\r\n\r\n- The crossbars of the F, R, and A have
  angles marking their ends;\r\n\r\n- The crossbar of the A extends beyond the body
  of the letter to the left;\r\n\r\n- The S has an asymmetric spine, with the bottom
  of the S being considerably larger than the top;\r\n\r\n- The lower edge of the
  end of the diagonal stroke on the N is halfway on the x-height, so that the entire
  diagonal stroke is very high on the letter;\r\n\r\n- The letters are very narrow,
  with the width of the letter about 1/3 that of the x-height.\r\n\r\nI don't have
  any images yet to post of the typeface, but I'll try to get one up. I'm neither
  a typographer nor a graphic designer, so I'm well out of my depth here!"
