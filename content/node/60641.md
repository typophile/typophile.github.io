body: Does anyone have suggestions for a text weight companion typeface for Neutraface,
  slab preferably, maybe a serif though? I know there is a Neutraface Slab, but I
  didn't want to do something that obvious. Or should I just suck it up and finally
  purchase that typeface since Neutraface is so peculiar? Thanks for the help.

    with Neutraface Slab because it is idiosyncratic and any other geometric would
    not match. However if you are just looking for something to go with Neutraface
    then you can really mix it up. For instance I''ve used Emigre''s Solex with Neutraface.
    (Keep in mind that I was using Neutraface and Solex in contrasting ways. Solex
    was never used at the same size or the same way. They served different purposes.) '

  body: Well Tiffany after looking around some more I think your right that no other
    geometric slab will work very well with Neutra, I guess I should probably really
    focus more on getting a serif face instead, and probably go for something geometric
    but something that also contrasts well instead of trying to force harmony.

  body: I've used Neutra in heads with Apollo for short bits of text (there was no
    extended text on that project). it's definitely a contrast, but something about
    their character worked well together to my eye.
