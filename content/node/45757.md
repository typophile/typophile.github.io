  Fontographer, the outlines appear fine and create a smooth curve, but when the font
  file is generated it does something to the 8 and gives it a weird corner. Comments
  welcome. Thanks.\r\n\r\n"

  body: You're not showing enough information in your screenshot. Provide a new image
    of the Fog window with the Preview off, turn on Show Points, and Select All so
    we can see the handles. Chances are it's related to either a stray point, or an
    unclosed path, or weird start point or something. Also, you might get better responses
    to a technical issue like this by posting in the Build forum. (But don't post
    twice -- maybe a moderator can move it for you.)

  body: It looks like it has been sorted, I think it may have been a case of the 'weird
    start point' you mentioned. Thanks for your help mate!
