body: "Hi all\r\n\r\nI'm working on a project which collaborates with and promotes
  the many different cultures of Europe, and trying to identify a typeface that can
  embody this.\r\n\r\nA universal sans face would be the most obvious, like Helvetica,
  but I'm thinking a traditional Roman serif face would be more suitable to convey
  the history of Europe. I quite like Fournier, Sabon and Transitional.\r\n\r\nAny
  thoughts?"

  body: "This is a tough call. And if you try too hard it's sure to backfire.\r\n\r\nA
    generic sans would be too weak, but a traditional serif isn't\r\nright either
    because it would be too local to Ancient Italy.\r\n\r\nI think what might work
    is a contemporary, funky serif font\r\nwith a strong Roman undercurrent, and fringe
    influences like\r\nfrom Greece and Eastern Europe. Not perfect, but what about\r\nQuadraat
    Italic?\r\n\r\nwww.fontfont.com/staticcontent/downloads/FF_Quadraat_Specimen_2012.pdf\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nBTW,

  body: "A different approach could be a sans serif version of Trajan.\r\nOr Novecento,
    which is inspired by european cities\u2019 historical lettering (http://typography.synthview.com/).\r\nIf
    you want/need something which references a period in-between those two, you will
    need at least some hint of blackletter.\r\nOr, finally, you could go the Typedia
    route (http://typedia.com/blog/post/behind-the-typedia-logo-design/)."

  body: "Thank you hrant! My logo was a labour of love. Your points are exactly what
    I felt, only expressed more articulately! I'll have a look at Quadraat, it certainly
    seems like a good contender.\r\n\r\nriccard0 - I think I'd looked at Novocento;
    I'm a big fan of geometric fonts, and love the big, round circular characters.
    However I'm a bit worried that this font might date a bit quickly if used for
    a logo, or that I'm using it because it's a personal favourite! That's a great
    back-story to the Typedia logo and something I might consider.\r\n\r\nThanks for
    all the advice, it's been really helpful. Although I'm an experienced designer,
    proper typography is an area I'm still working on and a tool I find fascinating.
    Cheers guys!"

    the 2000 years of European lettering history. There are several choices of fonts,
    I\u2019m sure."
