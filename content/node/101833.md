  Bank Bank Papier' uses it and you can see more references of it on their website:
  \r\nhttp://blog.kisskissbankbank.com/kkbb-papier/\r\n\r\nMy Fonts 'What the font'
  feature suggested that it might be Brandon Grotesque Black, but it's slightly different.
  The top ring of the B is smaller in my photo and the N has sharper points at the
  top left and bottom right. \r\n\r\nI would really, really appreciate it if someone
  can crack it! \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nKit"
