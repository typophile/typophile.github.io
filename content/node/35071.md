  your collection? Still looking for the Typo on London Underground, or for the very
  first issue? </em>\r\n\r\nThen rejoice, we have some good news. Together with our
  publisher, we arranged to re-print the issues which have run out, and starting with
  July, you may order any of the older issues. So, if you have been looking for some
  of the older issues, you may now order them via our e-shop at: [[http://www.magtypo.cz/buxus/generate_page.php?page_id=104|www.magtypo.cz]].
  The payment can be made in Euro or USD, with a <strong>credit card</strong> or via
  the <strong>PayPal</strong> account.\r\n\r\nIn the same place, you may, naturally,
  also order a <strong>subscription</strong> of the magazine. The same options as
  for the ordering of older issues apply, that is, a Euro/USD, credit card or PayPal
  payment. Enjoy the summer with [[Typo Magazine]]!\r\n\r\nFilip Blazek\r\n"

  body: Great news, Filip. Americans in particular are still sadly unaware of Typo
    and this is a good way to spread the word.
