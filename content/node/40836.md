  MT. In print, web. Can you link to it, or give me some info where i can buy mags,
  books and stuff, where they use <i>Calvert MT</i> in a offensive way \u2013 where
  it plays a important role in design.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance, \r\nThomas \r\n\r\nPS\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/calvert/mt/"
