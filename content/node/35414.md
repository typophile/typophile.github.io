    you need a lot more light/dark contrast - as you have it it&#39;s too flat&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>But I wouldn&#39;t make the logotype/name the same way. And I don&#39;t
    think Democratica is working. Try a script maybe, like Linoscript? Something upright,
    narrow and mannered. <BR>Maybe Bernhard Modern: <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/bernhard-modern/bold/testdrive.html?s=Apulia&amp;p=72"

    <BR>A little bit cliche, though, I guess. <BR> <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: How about an olive oil based sauce like pesto &#40;yum&#41;, it would add
    some color and texture.

  body: This is a silly quibble, but the &#34;sharp&#34;/narrow dribble on the left
    side of the A is distracting... for some reason I&#39;d rather see something more
    round. &#40;Not everyday you can use &#39;quibble&#39; and &#39;dribble&#39; in
    the same sentence.&#41;

  body: I think if you take the nipple squirting milk off the A, it&#39;ll be fine.
    The other inperfections are less distracting. <BR> <BR>Hey Jill.... It seems your
    classes logo&#39;s are being spaced out over this month. Is this a long term project,
    and if so, when is it due.  <BR> <BR>I remember my restaurant identity in design
    school. I guess I had about two weeks before crit on the restaurant logo. The
    final crit encompassed the logo, restaurant layout, and menu. I had much longer
    on that. Will you be preparing multiple peices for the identity? <BR> <BR>Just
    curious, <BR> <BR>Andrew

  body: Hey Jill <BR> <BR>I know its a pretty old post but I can&#39;t hold on to
    these beans and I&#39;m gonna spill&#39;em... <BR> <BR>I on the other hand quite
    like the typeface used for this logo. It gives me a sense of old Italy and I can
    almost see those olive tree&#39;s in the sun, while a group of roman soldiers
    are resting in the shadows... or something like that...kinda....almost. Anyhow
    I agree about the contrast of the logo and the colouring. I would have it a bit
    more greenish - but I&#39;m a sucker for green so don&#39;t mind me. hey talking
    about green - how about a few leaves? No? Nahhh your right...to used. <BR> <BR>And
    I like the squirting but keep it simple and not to much. Oh one thing that strikes
    me a bit &#34;easy&#34; The big &#34;a&#34; is exactly the same as the little
    &#34;a&#34; in the name with squirts and everything. Its seems a little &#34;copy/paste&#34;
    or is it just me?  <BR> <BR>Thats all from me - but I like the work... real nice
    <BR> <BR>Mark
