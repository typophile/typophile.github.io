  body: "Jon Hicks also made a font based on Glasgow architect C. R. Mackintosh\u2019s
    lettering. It\u2019s called <a href=\"http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/extras/\">Hill
    House</a>\r\n\r\n<cite>The font features special glyphs for the words \u2018to\u2019,
    \u2018at\u2019 and \u2018of\u2019 [\u2026] Hill House isn't foundry quality, but
    it is free.</cite>"

  body: Tiff, this is a rather late response (I got here via <a href="http://typophile.com/node/44648">a
    newer thread</a>), but that image is from a book jacket designed by Carin Goldberg
    (I was going to say Louise Fili, but then I looked it up) -- the book was published
    by Simon & Schuster in 1985.
