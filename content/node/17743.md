    body: Yes, the Eras was correct with a little tweaking.  I am still stumped on

  body: Yeah, my Trajan-esque ID skills are weak. It looks vaguely Goudy-an, though,
    with that high waist. Other clues are from the foot serif on the U, and the crazy
    overshoot in the top-left serif of the M and N.
