body: "Briefly, I'm doing some lite research working with a number of documents I
  can't actually read...\r\nDon't let the name fool you, I'm no francophone; and while
  I can't actually read any of these Czech, French, Italian and German articles I
  come across, Google has been helping me suss them out with some degree of reliability.\r\n\r\nWhat
  I'm really looking for is further information about the first footnote of [[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/colan_0336-1500_1989_num_81_1_1115|this
  article by Ren\xE9 Ponot]]:\r\n\r\n<em>1. Martin-Dominique Fertel, La Science pratique
  de L'imprimerie (The Practical Science of Printing), Saint-Omer, 1723, 502 p. Index.</em>\r\n\r\nI've
  found multiple printings of [[http://polib.univ-lille3.fr/?q=fr/B590092101_000000002.597|Fertel's
  work online]], and despite page numbers suggesting otherwise, they all seem to appropriately
  terminate around page 350 or so... I thought the footnote might have been transposed
  in some way, but I can't seem to find the information I'm looking for.\r\n\r\nAs
  I've Google'd-out the translation from Ponot article, I'm under the impression that
  there is some specific typographic advice regarding Jenson types... and I wonder
  what it is... on this missing/transposed \"502 p.\"?\r\n\r\n{The need for classification
  has not been required since the invention of typography, as the number of types
  was once insignificant. In the first treatise of known printing (1723), Fertel 1
  \ provides advice reserved to one type of character, established three centuries
  earlier by Nicolas Jenson...}\r\n\r\nAny help with this appreciated, please... I
  must know.\r\n\r\nFor extra credit, I'm looking for a copy of Novarese's 'Alfa-beta'
  - in Toronto that I could purchase/borrow or otherwise acquire a few<em>legible</em>
  photographs of.\r\n\r\nbest always.\r\n"

  body: I suspect the "502" is a typo, perhaps for "302". This is a bibliographic
    statement of the length of the book, not a page reference to specific information.
    As I understand the sentence by Ponot that interests you, he is simply saying
    that Fertel did not provide any classification of types because he restricted
    his discussion solely to the style of type created by Jenson (i.e., old style
    Roman).

  body: "Okay. That is certainly simple enough. I suppose I expected that there would
    be a passage where Fertel would have referred to the Roman form directly in some
    manner - not in terms of classification, or some commercial name, but in some
    other antiquated parlance... \r\n\r\n"

  body: Depends what you're looking for. On a quick skim through the first chapter
    of Fertel, which appears to be the main section devoted to the particulars of
    type, he discusses sizes of type, arrangement of type cases, and copyfitting,
    as well as the use of various specialized kinds of type like Greek letters, quads,
    drop caps, italics, and ornaments, but I didn't see anything about letterforms
    as such.
