body: I've seen this font in a few places now, however I haven't been able to identify
  it. The most memorable place I've seen it used is in the the title sequences of
  the featurettes on the Alien Quadrilogy DVD set that was released a few years ago.
  Most recently, however, I saw it in a local gaming magazine, which is where the
  sample I here provide comes from. Please help me out, guys!
