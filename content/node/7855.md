    are so diversified that it is disturbing. It this an intended result?

  body: Thanks for the post Scott. I see your point ;&#41;. It was intended result,
    but now you noticed it I am not sure of keeping it. <BR> <BR>Any suggestions how
    can I unify the elements of the card? I would rather keep the typo-santa because
    it was time-consuming to portray. <BR> <BR>Of course any other creative ideas
    and methods to delineate the chiristmas spirit on a piece of card would be highly
    appreciated ;&#41;. <BR> <BR>Salute

    which I think would seem even more clever if it were more subtle &#40;smaller&#41;?

    for smaller font size usage. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/54566.jpg"

    me your opinion about it. <BR>The purpose of this assignment was to depict and

    I would love to receive any suggestions for other ways of doing this. <BR> <BR>Sincerely,

  body: Galin, I love the typographic Santa. It&#39;s beautifully done.  <BR> <BR>The
    tagline, however, I don&#39;t like. In English, &#34;merry&#34; isn&#39;t a transitive
    verb, so &#34;merry it&#34; doesn&#39;t strictly speaking work. I could see it
    as a playful semi-pun on &#34;marry it&#34;, but for that to work, you have to
    use the contraction &#34;It&#39;s...&#34; instead of &#34;It is&#34;, which sounds
    somewhat formal. Overall, though, I&#39;d drop it.  <BR> <BR>I think the Santa
    is strong enough to stand on his own. If you want words, I&#39;d go with Merry
    Christmas &#40;possibly also in Bulgarian or other languages&#41;. &#40;By the
    way, what&#39;s Santa called in Bulgarian? Ded Moroz, Ded Nicolas?&#41; <BR> <BR>One
    odd idea, which may make the whole thing too cheap &#40;or not&#41; is that Santa&#39;s
    expression and pose make it look as if he&#39;s riding a surfboard. Of course,
    Santa is supposed to ride a sleigh, so how about putting him on a surfboard made
    from a sleigh?

  body: 'These are beginning to work much better, but I am still struggling a little
    with the type at the bottom. The words don&#39;t bother me so much, as they do
    Galin, but there still seems to be a style issue. You have two distinct type styles
    and neither of them seem to be associated in any way with the typoSanta. <BR>
    <BR>The following are some suggestions: <BR> <BR>1 Try creating a typographic
    horizon line. With this addition the all white background works better than the
    design with the red swash at the bottom. <BR> <BR>2 Try simplifying the type to
    involve only one face. Use a face that is as freeform as your Santa. Between the
    two you have already, the type used for &#34;merry it&#34; would be better suited.
    <BR> <BR>3 Galin is right about the copy being improper English, but I&#39;m not
    sure that it is wrong in this application. I realize that you are saying &#34;merry
    it&#34; while meaning &#34;make it merry&#34;. I think most others will get it
    also. In order to emphasize this slang terminology enough to make it obvious,
    you probably should change &#34;It is'

  body: Hrant, it depends on what&#39;s wanted, which is why I put &#34;strictly speaking&#34;
    in there. It could certainly be quaint, but it could come across as well as me
    writing Christmas cards in Armenian.

  body: 'Galin, I&#39;ve been watching this critique for a while now. I think the
    direction you&#39;re going in is good, and your type Santa&#39;s great. <BR> <BR>My
    comments: <BR> <BR>1. Get rid of the red curved area at the bottom and either
    just have Santa on a white background, or do what Scott recommended: a typographic
    horizon line &#40;possibly in a light grey&#41;. <BR> <BR>2. If you want to use
    a script I recommend you either use just the handwritten type with no effects,
    or use a more scripted and less handwritten one &#40;like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/linoscript/">Linoscript</a>,
    for example&#41;. The glowing and shadowing remove any sense of a &#39;true&#39;
    handwritten feel. <BR> <BR>By simplifying everything, you also put the emphasis
    on your Santa, which really deserves most of the viewer&#39;s attention.'
