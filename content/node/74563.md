    has grown up that reads fewer newspapers and hardly reads books at all. These
    young people spend most of their time on the Internet or in an environment of
    electronic instruments. As a result, they interface with the Hebrew language through
    a different font from the generation that grew up with print media\"\r\n\r\nThis
    kind of stuff, generalization is nonsense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"...In contrast,
    the design uniformity of the FrankRuehl family of letters created a clear, easily
    readable font. The decisions that underlay the process of designing Arial produced
    a more confusing font, which is harder for us to read.\r\n\r\n\r\nI guess he didn't

  body: "I agree that there is a lot of rubbish after the discussion of Narkiss and
    Arial Hebrew. But to be fair, the rubbish is from the designers, not the journalist.
    I did find interesting the argument that Ariel Hebrew is made too symmetrical.
    Do you think so? \r\n\r\nThanks for mentioning the article by Rafael Frank, I

    Gorkin's is the latest, made for Monotype who licensed it to Apple and Microsoft.
    Smart. Paid Monotype (Agfa) big bucks not to pay bigger bucks to Tzvi Narkiss

  body: "In the article linked above, the complaint is about three letters in Arial
    Hebrew: the samech (not in Israel's sample) is a circle, symmetrical, and also
    the yod and nun sofit, which are rectangles. You can see here: http://www.ascenderfonts.com/font/arial-bold-hebrew.aspx\r\n\r\nThere
    have been similar complaints about the \"j\" in Futura, and it is not much imitated.
    Also the original m and n in Futura, which were symmetrical, were abandoned.\r\n\r\nSee
    here Narkis Tam, which has a corner on the samech: http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/masterfont/narkis-tam/regular/characters.html

  body: "Brian,\r\n\r\nWhat are you saying?\r\n\r\nDo you refer to the obvious Narkis-like
    design of the Hebrew, or the crude knock-off of the graceful Hevetica design for
    the Latin letters.\r\n\r\nGorkin brilliantly added more curves to the Hebrew letters,
    and adjusted the stroke widths to match the stroke widths of Arial.\r\n\r\nBut
    it's still heavily influenced by Tzvi Narkis zal (www.FontWorld.com calls my version
    Neshika, or kiss, a play on words with Narkis' surname.\r\n\r\nInterestingly,
    I saw in posters created by a Jewish concentration camp inmate in the Holocaust
    Hebrew lettering which closely resembled the popular Narkis design, suggesting
    that the Narkis design originated by an unknown designer in Nazi Germany. If we
    study Narkis' other designs, clearly this design does not match."

  body: "Israel,\r\n\r\nI was speaking perhaps in ignorance of what was meant, because
    I only skimmed over the original article. I think it looks a bit sterile aside
    from that, but that isn't always a bad thing.\r\n\r\nIn my own design work, I
    have mostly chosen sans-serifs with small quirks and imperfections - or perhaps
    something more relaxed to them - especially for use with Serif fonts. Usually
    the stark sterility of many Sans looks jarring to my eyes against serif type.
    On the other hand, by itself sterile sans fonts have merit in my opinion. But
    they usually don't mix well with serif fonts, even stiff ones."

  body: "A sans does not need to be sterile. Look at Itamar Davids David or the fonts
    by Tzvi Narkiss. They are sans, but verile and very alive.\r\n\r\nThis is partially
    due to alternating the stroke width a bit, which causes the eye to move move and
    get excited. See how Arial, even Helvetica, lack this?"

  body: "Yes, that is what I meant. I think it's also the incline of the contrast
    as well.\r\n\r\nArial, Helvetica, and Frutiger are all very \"neutral\", especially
    so of Frutiger. But I think this design lends to only so many uses. It would never
    work as a companion to a serif. By themselves, these tend to work well. What I
    mean is, rarely does Helvetica play well with another font imo."

    is imperfect, natural cans be ugly, but often is pretty. Sterile is streamlined
    and refined until every curve has perfect tension, every kink is removed, and
    everything has lost personality. It can be bland.\r\n\r\nNeither is really good,
    bad, or perfect, but has it's own uses and limitations."

    have dicoverd that most pronunciation where already used. \r\nthe letter Thadi

    the CH pronunciation\r\na gimel with a dagesh kal was pronunced as DJ\r\n\r\nalot
    of these pronunciations were forgotten with time\r\nso wrather making up new glyphes
    as michal shani is sugjesting, we can simply revive the ancient way of hebrew.\r\n\r\na
    dalet with a dagesh and a dalet without a dagesh are pronunced the same way.\r\nalot
    was forgotten, so before distorting the language, she should research the ancient
    ways, and she will find out that much already exists."
