body: "Here comes the time for an important design decision \u2013 choosing the right
  font for the main body of my ~6000 word piece of writing \u2013 and I'm not really
  sure where to start.\r\n\r\nThe working title is \"The Many Faces of a City\", which
  is unlikely to change; and it basically looks at the relationship between type and
  city culture. Obviously the dilemma is I can't hand in a piece of about typography
  set in bad type. Even though the main points of it cover contemporary issues, I'm
  thinking that I should still stick to the traditions of using a serif for ease of
  reading, unless anyone can reason otherwise? \r\n\r\nOne that I am thinking of is
  Utopia, since it just has a good rhythm and of course the content should do the
  talking rather than anything too extravagant. I'm definitely open for suggestions
  though, hence my being here, so please share your thoughts. Thanks."

  body: "Hello Vicke\r\nIn choosing a typeface for your dissertation, think first
    of functional criteria : do you need old-style figures ? small caps ? uncommon
    diacritics for foreign names ?\r\n\r\nThe distinction between serif and sans-serif
    is not that important in terms of readability, in my opinion : you can easily
    compensate for the lack of serifs by setting a sans-serif with a little extra
    leading."

  body: "Thanks for the reply, Celeste. In terms of the functional criteria, non-lining
    figures are quite crucial for my content. Small caps and uncommon diacritics are
    not so important. I'd just a character set covering basic latin glyphs. \r\n\r\nThat's
    a good point about the sans serif, in which case do you have any suggestions on
    ones which work well in long text? I forgot to mention earlier but I am willing
    to pay for a good font, just so long as it doesn't completely break the bank. "

  body: "I agree with you about using a serif for body text, for reasons of ease of
    reading. This is a topic of recurring debate on Typophile, [[http://typophile.com/node/86581|the
    most recent thread being here]]. \r\n\r\nIn my biased opinion, [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/WilliamsCaslonText/|an
    old style serif]] gives the most comfortable read. \r\n\r\nBut you may feel that
    a more contemporary mood goes with your topic, in which case you might consider
    [[http://www.typotheque.com/fonts|Fedra Serif and Sans]]. The sans in lighter
    weights to me has a stylish architectural feel, which could work nicely for headings.

    has a nice architectural feel and is eminently readable (or can be easily made
    so).
