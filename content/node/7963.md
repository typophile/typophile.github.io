  spacing by one pixel &#40;I assume it uses the tallest of all the fonts it is going
  to use&#41; and I lose 5 lines of code per screen. <BR> <BR>All I have available
  to edit the font is Softy, but I&#39;m not sure if that is sufficient because it
  isn&#39;t clear to me what is causing it to be one pixel taller. How can I make
  it shorter? If I can&#39;t do it with Softy, would someone be willing to do it for
  me? If so, please rename the font to &#34;Lava&#34; &#40;per the Vera license the
  name must change&#41;. You can find the font here: <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.n4te.com/temp/Vera.ttf"

  body: Thanks Tiffany. <BR> <BR>I should mention that the characters in Vera at 9pt
    are the same height as my 9pt bitmap version of Vera Mono. Well, all the characters
    I looked at atleast. Maybe there are a few characters that are slightly taller
    and are causing the extra pixel? That is all I can think of, or maybe there is
    some setting in the font header for this.

  body: You need to take a look at the vertical metrics values in the font OS/2 and
    hhea tables. See <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/53053.html?1100009406">this
    thread</a> for a detailed explanation of how these values should be set. You can
    probably figure out by how much to reduce the ascender values in order to give
    Vera the same linespacing as the bitmap font.
