  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I have a client who needs a Bold of one my fonts, yesterday. I tried to buy enough time to do it right, but they still want it yesterday. I told them, but I'm no martyr, so... I'm trying to use FontLab's auto-bold Action (I'm running 5.0.4 on XP) and apparently it's not as good as old Fontographer's! I can't seem to vary the size-gain restriction in each dimension. Even if I do it in two steps (once horizontally with dimension gain, then vertically without) it doesn't do it right. It's not a clean-up issue (I <em>was</em> planning on doing that) it's a matter of trying to avoid vertical squooshing after doing the auto-bold!   :-/

Help?

There are different ways to transfer the glyphs; for example you could assign the font mask of the other font and then swap the outline with the mask.

Edited: Naturally have to adjust the hints (not adjusting, but rehinting with the AFDKO autohinting macro), the stem values and the alignment zones.

Not a help for the moment, but FontLab is going to integrate the Fontographer enbolding algorithm into FontLab Studio, as far as I know.</div>

Craig, the problem is a Bold needs to be wider but not taller, and that "Keep glyph dimensions" box only does both or neither (and not even very well - in fact it makes things <em>narrower</em> - dumb). One would think you could do a bold on each dimension separately, the vertical keeping the dimensions and the horizontal not, but for some reason it gives the same results!  :-(

A value of 20 will increase the stem with by 20 in each direction. If you use small increments you may be OK, but why not just use the interpolate node took on the individual glyphs. If the font contains a reasonable number of glyphs, say under 500, I think one should be able to do it in a day's worth of work, considering at least a third or more of those glyphs will be composites.</div>

It doesn't even seem to be that predictable...
But I don't really mind the iteration required to find a good number.

Being an Armenian font the number of glyphs is way less than 500!
But -at least the way I work- there's no way I could do it the way I'd
like by tomorrow morning.

I guess I have to fuse two sayings:
"Time is money" and "You get what you pay for"...

Anyway, I'd still love to learn any tricks concerning this, even after the fact.

There is a more or less official patch, which should fix the memory problem. I recommend to thoroughly read that thread:

http://forum.fontlab.com/fontographer/will-fontographer-install-into-vista-64bit-vista-t113.0.html;msg26319#msg26319

I am also using Windows XP and here the old Fontographer version worked. I have one Gigabyte RAM. Alternatively to the patch you could remove a memory module, if you have more than one.</div>

So a couple of good things happened: I bought myself
an extra 24 hours; and I gave Fog4 another shot* and
it worked! And it's amazing how much better than FL's
Fog's auto-bold is. The main thing it gets wrong is the
overshoots**. Anyway, it all worked out (considering
the still-too-short timeframe). But Armenian only has
about 100 chars; even a modest Latin font I couldn't
have pulled off, at least not the way I work.

* For one thing I noticed a "No paging file" choice
that wasn't there before - maybe it kicked in after
I installed SP2 (I've been avoiding SP3).

** Which you normally have to adjust
when changing the weight anyway.
