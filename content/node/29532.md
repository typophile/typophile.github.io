  seeing these fonts before. They are used all through the magazine, sometimes copy
  text is set in the serif.\r\nThe sans has strange \xC4s, I think, is that very common?"

  body: "Well, I took this last one as a challenge, and I think it has defeated me.
    The counter on the P and R is too big for anything I can find. The J, K, C and
    S are also hard to find in combination anywhere; and of course the low \xC4 is
    really <em>not</em> common at all.\r\n\r\nI pretty much hunted the condensed sansserifs
    at MyFonts, and the best I could come up with were Storm's <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/ohrada/\">'Ohrada'</a>,
    Berthold's <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/akzidenz-grotesk-bq/medium-condensed/\">'AG
    Condensed'</a> and <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typeart/silverscreen/\">'Silverscreen'</a>,
    from TypeArt.\r\n\r\nThis is a good mystery, because condensed sans faces are
    used a lot, but I am coming to the conclusion that this is from an obscure source
    -- maybe a small European foundry.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    my attention, not too keen on it, to be honest. It looks very strange in words
    with double-\xC4, and that's not unusual in Finnish, as you can see in this nonsense
