<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Yes. I am very sad about this. Although, it isn't necessarily a done deal. The client might still license Stainless. But, because of Font Bureau's restrictive EULA in regards to PDF distribution I am looking for alternatives to Stainless Regular and Stainless Black for my client. They distribute a monthly newsletter through PDF and print. I have also used Amplitude and could see ... oh this is wrong, I realize that. I love these typefaces but don't wish to steer my clients into something more than they can afford. Anyway, suggestions welcome. I will also let you guys know what Font Bureau says once I talk to them. Bless them they have some beautiful type but I fear I need to use other type for this one.</div>

<div class=commentbody>It's my understanding this is a deeply political, journalistic <br>newsletter, correct?

<div class=commentbody>Thanks for the suggestions. I did look at Metron but not Unit. Thanks. Neo sans isn't bad, but the rounded corners might suggest something like weakness and lack of decisiveness and as this is a political newsletter for a group of extreme liberals I'm not sure that is the look they want. <br> <br>Hrant, the problem is that we've already put in place a basic look that they do like. I'm not so unrealistic that I want something as close to the same as possible, but I also need generally the same feel. <br> <br>As for the way Font Bureau does business. It is their choice and I'm looking for something else because I want to educate my clients about licensing and am using this as an opportunity.</div>

<div class=commentbody>If you want another geometric sans, I highly recommend Eric Olson's Klavika. Just licensed and used it for a project, and it rocks. <br> <br><a href=http://www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/klavika/index.html target=_blank>http://www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/klavika/index.html</a> <br> <br>The Process Type EULA allows embedding. One potential hitch: the basic license is just for one CPU, rather than the more common "up to 5 CPUs."</div>

<div class=commentbody>I like the idea of identifying a typeface as being "grassroots" and can see Hydra working in this instance even though it is more grotesque than either Amplitude or Stainless. <br> <br>Ginger is close too, but the lowercase k is a little too cute for these guys. <br> <br>Sophisto would work if it were wider. Sadly it is just too narrow. Same problem for this job with Stalemate. (Thanks, Stefan, for sending the sample setting!) <br> <br>Klavika is a good suggestion. Probably a great suggestion. Hmm.

<div class=commentbody>First thanks to all for your help. Especially to Stephen for the personal attention and time spent. However ... I thought I'd share with all of you the results of this search. <br> <br>To license the four typefaces I need from The Font Bureau--Stainless Regular, Stainless Regular Compressed, Stainless Black, and Stainless Black Compressed--for a 2-5 CPU license it will be $280.00 with an addition of only 10% for my current needs for distributing PDFs of the newsletter. That 10% isn't a yearly fee either so for an item that is being sold every month it is, I think, worth to the client to license these typefaces from The Font Bureau and not sweat trying to find a replacement. <br> <br>Also, to clarify a few things. Their EULA does allow for embedding for output as well it allows for embedding to proof to clients. <br> <br>I'd say the moral of this story is to call the foundry first.</div>

<div class=commentbody>John, for my agreement it is up to 10,000 PDFs for distribution. It would be 5% for the license agreement for 1000 PDFs for distribution. So basically for $28.00 more dollars my client is covered.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I'm not going to name names--because I deeply appreciate and respect the foundry and their typefaces--but this was a quote for embedding of another font family from a different foundry. Before I received this quote I had already realized that Font Bureau's fee was reasonable, but now I am convinced of it. <br> <br>I am sorry for the delay. Thank you for your interest in ________. A 2 CPU license, at one location, for _________ 1 and 2 would be $358. In addition to the license you would have to pay an annual embedding fee of $300 to be able to embed ________ and _____________. To embed all 16 styles of <br>_______ 1 and 2 would be $2,400 per year. <br> <br>Yikes! For me and my humble client this was a lot. If I were, say, Giganticorp (to borrow terminology used by Kristin Dooley) it might be more worthwhile.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Those do seem like pretty steep rates. I'd think this is a foundry that feels very concerned about or threatened by embedding. <br> <br>On the flip side, if I were Font Bureau I'd either increase or eliminate their embedding fees. Right now the need for extra licensing is an irritant to the customer, and the amounts of money are kinda small. <br> <br>Cheers, <br> <br>T</div>

<div class=commentbody>Shhhhhhhhhhhh! Thomas! Harry might be listening! :^D <br> <br>I think the $$$ adds up for larger orders in regards to what Font Bureau charges. I was only licensing 4 typefaces for 2-5 CPUs. If my client had been a larger corporation it would've meant a little more. I don't think FB wants to scare off the customers, but I also think that to embed for distributable PDFs is a value add according to FB's EULA and so a small fee is reasonable. <br> <br>While I do appreciate, very much, the foundries who do not charge extra for embedding for distribution I also realize that it is a business and everyone has their own opinion on what their fonts are worth. FB has never raised the prices of their fonts and I appreciate that.</div>
