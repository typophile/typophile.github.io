  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">This font now has 2 editions, the one originally commisioned ( now being hinted a bit more) & an improved version with a bigger set of targets to hit. My focus is now the new version.

The original font was designed :

- to be used in bitmap mode at 12pt on a pc ( on & off pixels only ) 

The new design is meant to :

- look okay in print
- work as hited bitnmap ( on & off pixels only )
- and work anti-aliased too ( with grey pixels created by rendering engines ).

Originally I tried to shape my glyphs around the target bitmap at 12pt for PC. But I found out eventually that I was constraining the glyph designs too heavily and creating problems for the bitmaps at larger & smaller sizes. This new font builds on my trial & error experience as well as my new understanding about why monospaced fonts have taken the shapes they have. The latest version does as better job rendering to screen in antialised mode & I think is less ugly when printed.

The latest GIF graphic is simulated PC 12, 24, & 48 pts.

The PDF shows 12 & 72 pts. The 'in typophile' link below doesn't work. <a href=http://www.eyebytes.com/softdev.v3.1.pdf>This one does.</a>

I have been using Lucida Sans Mono, Lucida Console, Consolas, Courier, Andale mono, Monox, Isonorm, Thordis Mono, Adaptive Mono & Mono 821 as references.

Thanks!</div>

_f_ seems too wide
_i_ fills up the word shape too much when it appears in the middle of a word. 
_m_ the middle stroke is too short. It also looks a little narrow
_w_ seems too narrow. UC and lc.
_J_ seems too wide. Could be the tail.

Being that this is monospace, some of my critique could be useless. 

Could you set some more text with more caps in use so we can get a better sense of that as well?</div>

Now when you reply it seems you can't post new images in the reply - and images are not inline anymore either. 

The example images were created in photoshop using a 96 dpi setting to simulate a PC screen. There is a little anialiasing that would not exist in a programming app - but I think the idea/impression given is mostly right.

Who would you say is the monospace guru on typophile?

		<div class="commentbody">I think you have a good start. A few observations:

You need to use a bit more overshoot on the curves at the tops and bottoms of the rounded characters (A, C, G, O, Q, S, etc.). 

I would move the vertical stem of the f one "pixel" to the right. Same with the t.

I agree with Tiffany about the m. I also think the top of it is looking clogged where the two strokes meet. You need to cut into it more like the bottom of the w.

I would move the crossbar on the e up one "pixel". It seems out of step with the rhythm of the rest of the font.

I think the A and R are a little too similar. The lower crossbar on the A helps, but it may be difficult to tell them apart in certain cases. You could do the top of the A like the bottom of the V. Or, you could put an angled tail on the R. Or both.

Check the top of the z. It seems like it's not quite up to the x-height.

The word spacing seems too wide. I would make it much narrower. (Just kidding.)</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><strong>Harmonising shapes</strong>

The vertical parts of the bowls on b, d, etc are rounded, whereas the same parts on c, e, and o are straight. I think these shapes should be consistent. I prefer the rounded shapes; it humanises the design.

I like the arches on h and n. Why not use the same on u (by rotating the n), instead of the smallcap style? This could help disambiguate u and v.

Small s and capital S have different arm styles. The closed style works on capital S, would it work on small s, or would the counters close up too much?

<strong>Letter spacing and width</strong>

The letter spacing and width appear to be dictated by the lower case bowls and arches. I would say the spacing is tight for a monospace design. This creates problems with m and w, which would like to be wider, but cannot 'rob' any space either side. Also, the narrow letters like 'i' and 'l' cannot fill the space enough to blend with the tighter spaced 'normal' letters, so you get light patches.

Perhaps try loosening the spacing a bit. The words should not fall apart, because the word space is about twice what you would have in a proportional design.

I think the cap height is the same as the ascent (I have not measured it). The caps would look less squashed if they were shorter. 

<strong>Punctuation and other disambiguation</strong>

A programmer's font needs strong and unambiguous punctuation. The dots in your design are too light, I feel. The comma looks right. The different styles of brackets need to be clearly differentiated. The braces have a good shape, with a clear 'dink' in the middle. However, I would widen the braces and square brackets.

I would lengthen the 'nose' on the figure 1, to disambiguate it from small l. My colleague wasted hours fixing some software which had both 'startl' and 'start1' in it, which appeared to be the same thing.

I am not a professional type designer. I do it for fun. Please feel free to ignore everything I have said.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Proportional spaced software text? I think not.

The characters in most software languages function in a different way to the same characters used to represent human languages. In software, each character has similar weight in terms of meaning. Grouping characters into words is just for human convenience. An error in a single character is not merely a typo: the software will not compile, or will malfunction. Conventional proportional spacing aids reading groups of characters as words. This does not help when reading software text, which very often needs to be read character by character.

In my opinion, a monospaced design is beneficial to character-by-character reading, and is therefore most suited to rendering software text.

On the topic of character-by-character reading, I have read of a psychological test (sorry, no ref), where monospace out-performed sans and serif proportional typefaces. As I recall, the test involved finding typos. Does this mean that writers (or at least proof-readers) should use monospace?

<strong>Re: monospace </strong>- I have asked about this over & over again, because I, like Segej, didn't grok why the monospace was used by programmers. The programmer who will be getting this font when it is done actually explained it to me best - despite english being a 2nd language. 

He said that character count is important when scanning code. Monospace let's you find patterns in code faster - dissimilar or similar code for instance - than variable spacing. The thing is programmers are not reading for comprehension like we do. It's both more & less abstract than that. 

- More, because they are thinking in terms of how the lines interact 

- Less, because they are looking for small - sometimes single charcter changes in common kinds of code - not the bigger word sized changes we look for when we read a language.

That my understanding anyway.

<strong>DeGroot</strong> - Has anybody seen anything written by Degroot on monospace? Has anybody talked with him about it or had a class?</div>

<a href=http://www.eyebytes.com/v13.pdf> - PDF -</a>

Here is the current version of 'software developer' with many of the suggetions worked in. The biggest changes I made were in spacing & weight. I took Glyn's suggestion and there is a pixel's extra space between letters now. Reading about Mark Simonson's Type face <a href=http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/anonymous.html>'Anonymous' </a> in an article he kindly set me I decided that I had better reduce the weight of the face as a whole. I have brought some of the variation in weight I found in my lower case into the numbers and I will start looking at puctuation & additional characters next ... In the meantime - here is the update. Fire away!

I wonder if a different shape maybe a simple arch with a mid leg - like the cap A but a vertical line not a horizontal one - might also be a solution.

BTW - The stroke modulation isn't *needed* - i just thought it looked better than simpler shapes. I probably haven't got it right yet if it looks odd. What about the numbers? Do they look odd too. Any modulations in particular bug you? </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Having a little perspective from the coder's side of things, Here are some things that are important to the utility of the font.

You need bigger punctuation, like, monstrous if possible. Seeing the difference between a colon and a semicolon is important, but not as important as seeing the difference between a colon and nothing. I recommend that the diameter of a dot be somewhere between 1.5 times and twice the width of a stroke. But leave the dots on i and j as they are; they should not distract someone who is looking for punctuation marks.

In some samples, your zero is reading as an eight. I suggest narrowing the mark in the center and making it taller.

From a typography standpoint, example1.gif looks the most clean and impressive to me, whereas the pdf just looks awkward. So I think you should back off on the stroke modulation wherever you don't need it. b, d, p, q should look more like c, e, o, s do.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Eben, sorry it took me so long to take a closer look at this. I just realized what you're trying to do: make an outline font that looks decent enlarged but renders out nice grayscale bitmaps, and is monospaced on top of it! You're really shooting very high with this - the balance of compromises will surely be a bear to keep your head wrapped around... Good luck!

The two main problems I see with your first effort on top (which you might or might not have fixed - it's not possible to really know from that PDF, without a bitmap rendering):
1) Yes, make the interletter spacing two pixels.
2) It's too fuzzy. Fixing this isn't just a matter of making the forms lighter, but also controlling better what partial-pixels they render out.

As I'm sure you realize, there's a limit to how nice you can make the outlines look, without sacrificing the -more important here- screen rendering. This is because outline fonts rely on <strong>continuity</strong> to conform to aesthetic expectations, while bitmap fonts rely on <strong>discontinuity</strong> to avoid blur. I guess if you simply manage to make the outlines non-disgusting (which you're doing fine) that would be enough; don't try to make your outlines conform to the conventional standards of print font quality.

As for the question you're having concerning Em/pixel-block proportions, I'm not sure where the issue is: as long as you choose a nominal point size that has an integer 75% value (to accomodate the "native" Windows dpi of 96) you should be OK. And a value of 8 (resulting in a pixel-block size of 125, in an Em of 1000) does that, plus it's sort of an informal standard in pixelfonts.

--

> Does this mean that writers (or at least proof-readers) should use monospace?

Indeed, there's immersive reading, and then there's deliberative reading. For the former, an efficient, well-proportioned font helps; but for the latter -like when proofreading- those attributes actually hurt! Because you have to be forced to read inefficiently to be able to catch typos; in immersive reading your cognitive mechanisms are simply too clever.

If anybody has any comments on the current state I would love to hear them. BTW I did try increasing the space beween letters from 2 to 3 pixels at 12 pt but I didn't like it. I am still working on my zero, S & s. They are not right yet & I know it. These examples don't show perfect pixel alignment but they do give a good idea about the current flavor of the font.

Three-pixel interletter spacing is too much at anything below like 18 pixels. Unless it's a really light and wide design or something. Two pixels is the gold standard for both one- and two-pixel weights at "normal" reading sizes (from like 11 pixels to 16), for designs of typical width. And one-pixel spacing is useful for very small sizes or where economy is much more important than readability.

		<div class="commentbody">These examples are blurry for two reasons 

- OSX really like to blur - and these examples are taken from the Mail application which uses the adobe/apple quartz engine. 
- and because I scaled the font up recently & I have not got perfect grid fit again yet.

I can turn off the antialiasing in OSX & this is what the examples look like:

<a href=http://www.eyebytes.com/html/text2.gif> text no aliasing</a>
<a href=http://www.eyebytes.com/html/code2.gif> code example no aliasing </a>

It will become crisper again oven with alaising but even then it will also look different in a Microsoft Programming tool ( very crisp indeed - no aliasing at small sizes) , on OSX ( aliasing on all the time) & still different from that in Photoshop( depending on render mode), Illustrator or Flash.

Still, apart from looking at the fit, Any glyphs that jump out as problems? Any that seem good? Apart from the S & s I am noticing obvious problems with the k,b,zero, and I wanted my r to have a littile bite in it at the top.

What about line spacing? 

I should also mention that part of goal for this font is to create a text field of code that *doesn't* shout with heavy puctuation. Hence the softer curly brace.

The one thing I would say at this point is this:
You have a lot of blur, for something that worries about the screen. Now, considering your particular design constraint -that the outline foundation be decent- that's arguably unavoidable. However, it does mean you can shoot for more letterform fidelity, less orthogonality. This ties in to Glyn's observation about the "v": there doesn't seem to be a reason to have flat sides like a "u" (since it's going to be blurry anyway), and there is reason for it not to have flat sides it (since you would want to avoid ambiguity).

BTW, could you put a character set?

		<div class="commentbody">Wow, looking good.

I'm a software developer myself, and I'm extremely picky about the font I use for coding. (I used <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/font.aspx?FID=11&FNAME=Andale%20Mono">Andale Mono</a> for many years, and recently switched to a slightly tweaked version of Fabrizio Schiavi's <a href="http://www.fsd.it/fonts/pragma.htm">Pragmata</a>.) I've been following the progress of your design with great interest.

The <em>w</em> and <em>W</em> seem to be a little problematic. The <em>A</em> also looks a little anemic. I'm not too sure that old-style figures are a good idea in this kind of font; that <em>0</em> looks a little odd in the context of actual code, for example.

On the whole, though, this is shaping up to be a font I would seriously consider using. Thanks for pouring the effort into this project; coders are a sadly neglected market when it comes to type.</div>

I think it looks good overall, especially in the 24. Consider making/hinting a 16 PPEM. BTW, when you choose point sizes to worry about, don't forget Windows! That's what most programmers use after all, and over there "10 point" for example is 13 PPEM.

One other thing: conventionally, the oldstyle "4" is descending.

> A slash may be more prgmatic but it can be confused in danish

You could make it backslash direction. There's also the totally horizontal slash, but that can make the zero too much like an eight.  The dot can work, but it requires a counter of three (or five, or seven) pixels.

No, It's hinted. Auto-hinting plus extra hints to make it behave. The OS is only willing to show me a non anti-aliased rendering from 12 down. thats why 24 point is anti-aliased. Hinting is crazy but almost fun. I am almost, starting to sort of understand it, in a way. Actually, my hinting seems quite effective for bit maps but only just so effective for anti-aliased text at say 12pt. There at 12 pt it looks pretty wacky at times because of the hinting hoops I am jumping through to make the pure b/w bitmaps look good.

I am glad you like the 24 pt. okay because thats what printouts should look like.

> 13ppem

Hmmm, I'd better look at the 13 again and tighten it up!

> OStyle 4

The 4 is modeled on Degroot's figures. Still, that good to know. See them?

The fellow I am doing this for likes the dot, maybe the one he doesn't want to use, Old Style figures (or not) will use the slash, heck maybe there could be a third version... It's just one glyph.

MacOS?! That's strange, I thought everything was full-fuzz for the past few years, with hints ignored to boot. Maybe it's a cutoff setting in the OS? If so, what's the factory default?

Yes, They are *totally* needed if you care about the b/w bitmap especially with my redesigned 'Yy' & 'Xx'. My old ones would have behaved better but ...

Actually I found a new way to design for b/w that I wish I had known before. I only figured this out this week when I was hinting; you have to make many round trips between type 1 & tt hinting mode which means going from type 1 to tt outlines over & over (which bites) but you can move your points around & see what they are doing unhinted in multiple ppems. As it is my outlines are between 11 & 12 ppem which is maybe a good thing since they don't 'break' completely in either. Still, if I was doing this all over I would probably build some basic shapes going back & forth into tt & adjusting things for minimum hinting. As it was I did this for the percent symbol & it really paid off. That glyph would have been hell otherwise.

I had tried a version where I made the period a verical 2 pixels which was okay until I looked at the colon ':'. 

That form looked like the broken line glyph. So probably the alt version would have to be a 4 pixel which has been done for programmers before. So that could be done. It's a good idea for a variant!

On the other hand making the outlines heavier & then making the bitmaps use the one pixel afterwards (using hinting) would make the type read better in anti-aliased form. I think you are right about the puctuation being a bit too light. The period & colon etc. 

I think the brackets seem okay - but, if I make a heavy punct version then maybe I will make the brackets heavier too. What do you think?</div>

Sorry Tiff, some clarification.

- The one on top is the anti-aliased version, this is the kind of thing designers are likely to see & increasingly we all use since OS preferences are using anti-aliasing at smaller & smaller sizes. (which BTW I intend to tighten slightly so the verticals align to grid & the text matchs in width more perfectly with the bottom one). 

The way antialiased text looks will vary somewhat according to the OS being used, videocards & so on. This sample was rendered in Photoshop ( heavy style, one of 6 flavors) which renders differently than my web browser & which renders differently than Flash & so on. 

- The bottom one is the hinted black & white, or on & off pixels only, version. It's kind of old school, but this mode of rendering is the mode that programmers seem to like to program in the most. 

Hrant, Actually I can turn anti-aliasing on from 6 pts on up. What I cannot seem to do is turn it off ( except in photoshop ) at sizes above 12pt in OSX Jaguar. So I have some choice, just not complete choice.

		<div class="commentbody">For what it's worth, I would also like to cast a vote in favor of heavier punctuation. The more I look at those single-pixel dots in the period, colon, and semicolon, the more I think that they could be deal-breakers for me.

I do realize that expanding those dots to two or even four pixels would probably end up making the font look somewhat dishamonious; nevertheless, I think it would be the lesser of two evils, given the intended use. When coding, clarity is paramount.

I think I should also clarify my earlier comment on the <em>0</em> (zero) looking "odd". It's not the dot that looks odd to me; the dot is a very good thing. Rather, it's the disconcertingly small size of the entire glyph. ("Hmm... is that a zero? It looks awfully small to be a zero. What <em>is</em> that? Oh, I guess it must be a zero.")

In programming, it is very common to see lines of the form:

<code>x = 0;</code>

The <em>0</em> appears by itself, without any real context. Traditionally, when old-style figures are employed, they tend to be used in the context of prose, and more often than not, to represent multiple-digit numbers. This provides the context necessary to make the digits easy to identify. In code, single digits often appear without the benefit of that context, making it crucial that they be intrinsically easy to identify in isolation. I think old-style figures hinder that.

On the other hand, in the <a href="http://typophile.com/system/files?file=sq9.gif">example</a> you posted later, with the text setting, I think the old-style figures look great.

Perhaps you could offer your two versions of the font as follows: one with exaggerated dots and non-old-style figures (for use by coders), and one with the "normal" dots and old-style figures (for general-purpose use as a monospaced font).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks! The latest news is that my friend has decided that he likes the slighly smaller caps & quieter look of my original bitmap design best for programing, & the new design for reading text - so I will be making 4 fonts available once they are finally tested. 

(1) The tall one shown here with the , (2) plus a version with stronger puctuation as requested, (3) The older shorter version with simpler & quieter forms, (4) The older version  with strong puctuation. I might keep sthe old style figures as well. I guess I will offer the old version in bitmap centric format & a smooth line hinted format too. So really, 8+ fonts total.

All the new versions will have a better underscore & a new ampersand.

Anyway I hope to be wrapping this up soon.

Any more programmers here? Want to get your feature requests in?

In fact to improve the spacing, could you push the head one pixel to the right and still end up with something decent? Either way (and actually especially if you push the head rightward) you might also try an open-headed design.

"Open-headed" is not a common term I guess, but probably because you don't see many open-headed ampersands. So I guess it's "invented" (in the most lowly usage of the term) but I thought the meaning would  be clear: an ampersand with a hook for a head, sort of - the right side open.

Hey, wait! Just like your #8 - but with a conventional lower body.

		<div class="commentbody">Eben, I'm not a programmer ... but, I would prefer to see non-aliased type. This is one thing I actually do miss about OS9. 

While I can see the old-style figures as a nice _design_ feature I don't see how they could be useful to a programmer. I suppose you could have two different sets for tabular settings and paragraph settings both.

The para-setting which you've given is set very tight for the mono-word spacing. Is this typical for programmers? If it is am I wrong to ask if the word-spacing can be tightened up? That sounds wrong now that I've written it. If it is mono-space you shouldn't play with that. Can we see a setting that isn't so tight? I have a feeling that lining figures will still look better with this mono-space in a paragraph.

How much control do you have over the aliasing?

Did you tighten the spacing up in your ampersand samples? Overall I'd say all of them need a pixel of space on both sides. 9 16 17 22 all strike me as possiblilities. 9 seems the most logical. Hmm... 6 is good too.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Tiffany, 

Thanks for the feedback!

I should probably clarify about a couple of things. 

Aliased or not is a decision made by the operating system and or the program you are running. The fonts I am making ( now there are two - kind of big & small) are meant to be used by programmers whose tools use the non-aliased rending of the font. That said the fonts can be used in an aliased fashion if you want- and my goal is to make them look as good as possible there once their core use ( on screen un-aliased )  is addressed. 

Originally the forms were just blocks to correspond to pixels at a given point size but now they are smooth shapes - like Courier, or Lucida console - and I am using True Type hinting to try achive good results at sizes 9-16 or so. After 22 points the font is going to be aliased by the programmer tools/OS/video card anyway.

The spacing bewtween letters is an interesting issue. Having two pixels between letters when they get as small as my smaller font isn't practical at 12 pt - the space looks too huge and interferes with reading words and code. But eventually as the font scales up I have found it that having two pixels between at certain sizes makes sense.

For the bigger size I am using two pixels at 12pt ( one on each side ) but only at certain sizes because as the font shrinks it starts to need to consume one of the pixels in order to kep the forms legible. From 12 (2pixel) say to 9 (one pixel) this happens. At small sizes there are all kinds of trade-offs to make.

The Ampersand example is from the smaller font hence the tightness.

I am convinced now that the lining figures may not be for everybody. So I will be making versions with & without. I have found that they are nice in texts but don't do much for coding... but that's a matter of taste.

As far as other kinds of control over aliasing - I suppose I could do what Hrant is doing & make a version that has individual pixel shades - but that doesn't suit my client's purpose, they want no aliasing & multiple pt sizes; so I won't be going that route with this font.  

I did not tighten the spacing in the samples no. See above & you would not beleive how much people disagree about the Ampersands. Everbody likes a different one best! Twenty people & twenty different answers. I ended up going with 22 because it shrank to smaller sizes the best and was still fairly popular. The small gaps in the head 17 for instance are murder to hint as the font shrinks. The example I was showing is 12pt on a mac so you can see there are at least 2 smaller point sizes I was still targeting.

BTW - On my powerbook running OSX I can go into System prefs & Appearance turn aliasing off from 12pt down to see what I am getting in this environment. You could do the same - It doesn't effect all of the OS & programs but it does have an impact. You might want to try it. Unless your not on OSX. I thought you were for some reason...

I hope I have explained this well enough ... Let me know if any of this doesn't make sense.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This font now has 2 editions, the one originally commisioned & an improved version with a bigger set of targets to hit. 

The original font was designed :

- to be used in bitmap mode at 12pt on a pc ( on & off pixels only ) 

The new design is meant to :

- look okay in print
- work as hited bitnmap ( on & off pixels only )
- and work anti-aliased too ( with grey pixels created by rendering engines ).

Originally I tried to shape my glyphs around the target bitmap at 12pt for PC. But I found out eventually that I was constraining the glyph designs too heavily and creating problems for the bitmaps at larger & smaller sizes. This new font builds on my trial & error experience as well as my new understanding about why monospaced fonts have taken the shapes they have.

The latest graphic is at 12, 24, & 48 pts.

A full character set will appear later.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Eben, This is shaping up quite nicely. I think the short numbers are an improvement over your original old style ones. This is the same solution Frutiger came up with for OCR B way back when, and it still makes a lot of sense. 

There a lot of spots here and there where your curves could be refined without affecting how it works at low res. For instance, look at the top and bottom of the "O". These curves should be symmetrical vertically as well as horizontally. Or the "S": The stroke should be evenly modulated as it snakes around. As it is, there are some abrupt changes in the curve, like the inside top left and the top of the middle of the stroke, and this causes it to modulate a bit unevenly. The ends of the strokes on the "S" and some of the other curved characters seem a bit too tapered.

Now that you've got the basic shapes worked out, you should go through all the characters--especially the ones with curves--with an eye toward perfecting their shapes. Curves should flow evenly; symmetrical shapes should be <em>perfectly</em> symmetrical (taking into account optical effects as needed if they still don't look symmetrical).

The "A" seems a bit too wide--I measured it and it is wider than the "U". Perhaps that's intentional; if so, and it's noticeable, you've gone too far.

I can see that you've made your horizontals thinner than the verticals, but in some of the characters (the "I" and the "8", for instance), the horizontals <em>look</em> heavier for some reason. You may need to cheat some of these thinner to compensate.

That should give you enough to chew on for a while. I know you've spent a lot of time on this, and I think you've made a lot of progress. It looks pretty good at text size. You've still got a ways to go, but it's mostly a matter of refining things now so that it also looks good close up.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Mark,

Thanks very much for the detailed crit! I have some questions still...

> This is the same solution Frutiger came up with for OCR B way back when, and it still makes a lot of sense.

I thgink I wouldn't mind making an altrenate font later with altrenate altrenate numbers but for my main purpose I think this is the better solution.

> look at the top and bottom of the “O”. These curves should be symmetrical vertically as well as horizontally.

I think I wanted to suggest the same kind of movement Luc(as) De Groot has in his monospaced fonts. I am probably just doing a poor job of it or doing it too subtly for it to seem deliberate. Have you seen the fonts I mean? If so, what do you think of that approach?

> The stroke should be evenly modulated as it snakes around. As it is, there are some abrupt changes in the curve, like the inside top left and the top of the middle of the stroke, and this causes it to modulate a bit unevenly.

Again, I wanted to emulate other type but am not doing it well enough, for instance monoco or Lucida Console have this modulation... Do you not think it appropriate for this kind of font?

>The ends of the strokes on the “S” and some of the other curved characters seem a bit too tapered.

Agreed.

> The “A” seems a bit too wide

No, I just missed this.

>  (the “I” and the “8”, for instance), the horizontals look heavier for some reason

Agreed!  Thanks!

> You’ve still got a ways to go, but it’s mostly a matter of refining things now so that it also looks good close up.

Thanks! 

I have started making the fixes you describe but would you have a look at the diagonal axis thing in the o ( & the pbdg etc.) , and the modulation? I would like to see what else you have to say about this before I change this aspect of the face. It would be much easier to make the face more DIN-like & symetrical but I thought the most successful monos I had seen were degroot's and I wanted to bring some of his influence into my design... Again, What do you think?

I can send you some PDfs if you don't already have the references. I don't want to make you dig look things up!

Cerulean, Thanks! What do you think about the PDF?

		<div class="commentbody">I see what you mean. But even in TheSans Mono there is perfect symmetry (or at least the appearance of it). It's just not 2-way mirror symmetry. Instead, it's got "pinwheel" symmetry--the kind of symmetry you see in a pinwheel, a swastika, or a yin-yang symbol. In your zero, for example, I see left/right mirror symmetry, but top/bottom asymmetry--sort of like Hobo.

Trying to emulate De Groot--you've certainly set a high goal for yourself. The Dutch school is worthy of emulation, to be sure. However, I don't know that I would be the one to tell you how to do it. As much as I admire it, it's not my bag. Sort of like asking a blues musician how to write electronic dance music.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, it is a high standard that I am falling short of. And I am falling well short of it. Talk about hubris; I want to learn from them & see if Notan might have some role in monospaced fonts!

I just have to keep at it. Maybe I can get there in time & with enogh looking & thinking. I doubt I will make it with this font. I haven't quite decided how far to take it in that direction anyway. I don't want to make a consolas-alike!

I haven't seen the pinwheel symetry you are talking about yet. I'll have to look again! 

Unfortunately, that rendering engine issue I was on about in the other post is related in the sense that working out the issue had left my shapes are in more of a shables than I'd like. It was with the sense that I might have made some progress since last time & knowing that I had gotten in too far too it it all again that I posted my stuff again. 

Hopefully the next post will be tighter, more tested & more pleasing. 

Thanks for helping. I really appreciate it!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I didn't mean "rigorous text" face--that is a much broader category. I was talking about the Dutch school of type design, which I admire, but don't follow closely. I suppose some people might equate the two. I wouldn't.

I guess what I mean by my "bag" is that I tend to work intuitively and not from a rational/analytical basis. I'm not saying one is better than the other. Different strokes for different folks, that's all. It's not that I don't have rules, but the rules I have are internalized to the point I'm not consciously aware of them most of the time. I just know what looks right. It's part of the reason I don't usually participate in these critiques, I suspect. Too "left brain."</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I guess was way too quick & imprecise when I wrote that. What I meant by rigourous wasn't 'thorough' or 'careful' or 'precise', but had instead to do with a aesthetic of looking stiff, analytic, deliberate, or rational. Proxima Nova is certainly plenty rigourous by the 1st standard but doesn't have the perceptable rational feeling I associate with a lot of dutch type. 

If you don't mind, I'd like to ask you about two other things that I think relate in some ways to your work: 

- What do you think about 'Legato'? To me it seems to break with the dominant dutch direction in some ways. Do you agree? Do you think it relates to your design better than the other dutch type? Or at all?

- At one point I was trying to convince Hrant that if the caligraphic quality found in dutch type could be married to a carefully made set of conditional substitutes in open type font, then an opportunity for a better interletter spacing or 'notan'  could be reached - similar to what a latin caligrapher naturally would do. Or what arabic & chinese/japanese caligraphers do. What made me think about it was the way in which japanese/chinese charcters have to be written out. Each of the complex characters is made of an accumulation of simpler parts. A bit like a word is made with letters but arranged with more freedom of relative placement. When a kanji/character is written it is made *very* contextually. When I look at your logo work I see a lot of that contextual sensitivity. That is one of the things that deeply impressed me about your work. So far I don't think Hrant agrees with my 'more caligraphic' idea - for long texts anyway. I think that he thinks that the best inter letter spacing and legibility will be achived not by a bigger set of conditional shapes but instead by better 'notanic' design of the glyphs and the spaces between them. 

What Evert said was,

"FF Legato abandons the idea of a sanserif consisting of simple rigid forms. The mirrored image below shows how (different from typefaces like Gill Sans and Syntax) movement and direction is expressed by outer- and inner-forms behaving relatively independent, and is maintained through all weights. It makes characters refer to previous and next letters to build better words and lines."

And also : "Not only are arabic characters connected, their shape changes according to their context. "

Both these quotes come from:

Okay, thats probably enough for one post.

I am trying to make it crispy at 12pt. The numbers are not tweaked yet. The Uppercase is slightly tweaked. This is how it renders on OSX. XP/Vista will be different. OSX turns out to be the most difficult to perfect so as soon as I am done with this I will make the TrueType b/w version. Then I will make a Cleartype version that should look alot like this on XP/Vista but at 10pt.

Any comments? Thanks!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Eben,

It's looking really sharp at 12pt.  Very well done, almost looks like an ultra font.  I like the big x-height, and how the ascenders are taller than the cap height.  Dots inside the zeros are great.  The apostrophe is a little bit blurry.

The only letter that might be a little hard to read is the lc M.  But there's really nothing you can do about it when you have a monospaced alphabet.  I wonder how it'd look if you lowerered the right side a little bit (the second arc)?

I just noticed that lc L, is pretty similar to uc I. The difference is more distinct in earlier versions. Also since the x-height is big, I'd be curious to see uc and lc C, S, U, X, and Z next to each other to see how easily you can tell them apart.

Small comments on the 48pt version, it'd be nice if lc T's leg looped upward a little bit, lc Y's stems connected a little bit higher, and if you could pull in the lc B's bowl at around 1-2 o'clock.

I'm really impressed with what you've done so far.  So keep up the good work!</div>

The punctuation hasn't been optomized at all. It will get crisp like the rest soon. I came up with more extreme shapes to try to get two clear bites out of the top of the 'm'. I may need to revisit that again. I am not sure what you mean by the right side. Do you mean drop it down a pixel? I'll have to look at that lc 'L'. Maybe a more traditional monospace shape is needed... I'll post the next sample with some code & with successive placement eg Aa Bb etc.

Re the 48 pt: I wanted to bring the tail of t up too but i thought it made it too blurry at 12 pt. I may put it back after I do some print testing... I'll look at the Y & B. I may need to keep the shapes if they blur out wsith changes. Still, sometimes things work that you would not have expected. The biggest trick in these shapes is the narrow joins on the leg of the r,n,h etc. Doing the join that way took out alot of blur! I am also considering having the shapes loose a little weight to cut blur as well.
