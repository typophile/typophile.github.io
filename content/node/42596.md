  to create a script font. Anyway, a picture is worth a thousand words, so here is
  what I've done so far:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/handwritingfont_4486.png]\r\n\r\nThe
  letter next to the a that looks like a 8 is a g. Anyway, I've been looking at it,
  and it resembles Comic Sans MS\u2015not a good thing. I could try rewriting it with
  a smaller pen width; or is it fine as is? Should I go ahead and finish it?\r\n\r\nWhat
  do you people think?"

    it does, which is what sets its defining (and unifying) characteristics.

    again. Put more of your own natural touch to the letters. (I highly doubt you
    draw a lower case g like that.)\r\n\r\nA good thing to do is open up other fonts
    in your editing program, or in Illustrator, and  look at the details of each letter-form.\r\n\r\nBut
    don't be afraid of the Comic Sans comparison. If you're just getting into designing
    a font, you could do worse :)"
