  body: "What\u2019s your source? Is this from a piece of packaging? Could be custom,
    then.\r\nWhat about the other examples, do you have more characters?\r\nHow old
    is this, could this be pre-digital?\r\nI think this looks very interesting and
    distinctive, but I\u2019ve never seen it before, sorry."

  body: "It's from some old packaging, i think, not sure what thou. The example\r\nwas
    given to me. Yes Pre-Digital. I plan to re-crate it if its not something that
    is out. \r\nYa i really like it.\r\n\r\nHere the other example.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mri_6034.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: I'm pretty sure I've seen it before, but I just can't place it. I've checked
    likely sources among my old film font catalogs but no luck. I suspect it is from
    the late Seventies or early Eighties. The serifs remind me of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/arrus/">Bitstream
    Arrus</a>.

  body: "Ya, i would say around the late 70's. It reminds me of something ITC would
    have made during this time period.\r\nThe serifs do look kinda like Arrus but
    the \"a\" is way off.\r\n\r\nThe hunt is on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
