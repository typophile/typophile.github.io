  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi Everyone, this is my first post in this forum.  I would first like to thank everyone who helps with my question!  Thanks!

I was wondering what font is used for the website WireNine.com ??

They have their text change upon refresh but, if you look underneath the banner on their main page, it will either say:

Stuck with another web host? WireNine can help!

or..

The price you see is the price you get. NO HIDDEN FEES.

or... 

Become a Web Host today. Host UNLIMITED Domains!

or it will say something else as well.  I was just curious as to what font they are using there?

My other question too was, what font they are using for the heading, cPanel Business Hosting ???

Thanks to all who help!

That is an HTML call and the font in this case is dependent on which fonts you have installed on your machine. (eg. If you don't have the first option "Trebuchet MS" it will try the next on down the chain until it finds one that works)

THE HEADLINE - "Stuck with another web host? WireNine can help!"

uses the following font call.
"Trebuchet MS","Lucida Grande",Helvetica,Verdana,sans-serif

-----------------

THE HEADLINE - "cPanel Business Hosting"

uses the following font call.
"Century Gothic",Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif

I'd recommend downloading a Firefox plug-in called 'Firebug'... it's great for analyzing HTML and CSS live on a site.

EDIT: Made an update and slipped a spot. :)</div>

Has Typophile ever considered changing there policy on making all of that information available to the public?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Why the heck would you think it is spam?  Is my message not meaningful...

It's not that hard to look anyone up on the web, anyone can do that, same thing with court records.

I simply wanted to know what a font was, not have my message deemed as spam.

My last question for those that don't think my message is spamming, would anybody that views my website be able to see Trebuchet MS even if they did not have that font installed on their system?  I'm not sure if that is a standard font or not and I'm re-designing my site and would like to use a font that everyone can see regardless if they have it installed or not on their system.  

Thanks,

Not if your site is built the usual way, meaning without embedding the font in some way. But Trebuchet should be installed on almost all computers, at least running Mac OS or Windows. See *<a href="http://www.codestyle.org/css/font-family/sampler-CombinedResultsFull.shtml">here</a>*.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The alert for it being spam went up because you recently registered, linked to a web hosting site, and have "L" listed as your last name. Recent spammers have posted similar links trying to generate traffic to their site.

<a href="http://www.typetester.org/">Typetester</a> has 'Trebuchet MS' listed on their 'safe list' but that doesn't mean someone can't remove it from their system. When working with type on the web there are no 'for sures'.

Note: If you have have Microsoft Office installed you have Trebuchet MS.</div>

Much appreciated.  I guess I'll just give it a whirl and see what happens.

For the most part, most people should have Trebuchet MS I would gather.
