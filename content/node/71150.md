  have asked me to tweak with heads, captions, pull quotes etc. in a serif face to
  go with the body copy and subs that are set in Nimbus Sans Light, Regular and Bold.
  It's been a long time since I went near anything that smacked of Helvetica, especially
  used as body copy, so I'm at a slight loss for direction and would greatly appreciate
  your help and opinions.\r\n\r\nIdeally, I'm looking for a serif face that can work
  well as semi/display type with Nimbus always as body copy at 10/12. One suggestion
  from my team was Adobe Caslon Pro, but after quickly mocking up some dummies, I'm
  not entirely convinced they sit well together, and am possibly looking for something
  a little more contemporary, perhaps with a larger x-height, corporate yet human.\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas and factors that you think I should consider would be greatly appreciated,
  and if your first idea was Adobe Caslon Pro, then tell me why I'm wrong!\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for all suggestions. \r\n\r\n"

    slab serifs might be taken by client, but I'll add a couple to some dummies I'm
    working up.\r\n\r\nI'll also add another link to a past thread that was also helpful:
