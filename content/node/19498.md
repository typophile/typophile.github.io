  body: "How did you learn that the name of this was 'Biganne'? I ask this because
    I used Fontseek and Google on that name and 'Big Anne' with no result.\r\n\r\nI
    also made the assumption that maybe that's NOT the name, and looked among similar
    fonts in the Script Font ID Guide -- no matches.\r\n\r\nIt's possible that this
    is a 'personal font', since this type of font can be easily made by anyone who
    can print. In that case, your only chance is to contact the place where you saw
    this and ask them about how to get the font.\r\n\r\nIf that fails, then look for
    something similar, because there are too  many hand-printed fonts to search them
    all.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    body: I recieved the logo from the customer, and when I opened it in Illustrator
      it said that it was missing the font "Biganne." I also did seach and could not
      find the font.
