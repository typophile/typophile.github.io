  family, <a href="http://www.linotype.com/61955/zapfinoextraprocontextual-font.html"
  target="_blank">Zapfino Extra LT Pro &#40;Contextual&#41;</a> and <a href="http://www.linotype.com/61959/zapfinoextraforteprocontextual-font.html"
  target="_blank">Zapfino Forte LT Pro &#40;Contextual&#41;</a>. <BR> <BR>Zapfino
  was first designed by Hermann Zapf in 1998. Not completely satisfied with the result,
  Zapf revisited the design a few years later, with Linotype&#39;s Type Director <a
  href="http://www.linotype.com/7-469-7/akirakobayashi.html" target="_blank">Akira
  Kobayashi</a>. This effort was released as Zapfino Extra and Zapfino Forte &#40;a
  new, bold weight&#41; in 2003. Since that time, both Zapf and Linotype have heavily
  investigated the potential offered by OpenType&#39;s advanced features. <BR> <BR>The
  contextual versions of Zapfino work with OpenType-supporting applications, like
  Adobe InDesign 2.0 &amp; CS, Adobe Ilustrator CS, and Adobe Photoshop CS. When a
  designer sets texts in these new fonts, and activates all OpenType features, the
  font will draw on an enormous databank of contextual alternates and ligatures, changing
  your text as you type or select, and giving you a result that would have taken a
  lot more time to create by using the old Zapfinos &#40;which required you to switch
  between four different alphabets to find the glyph you wanted&#41;. <BR> <BR>Of
  course, using the glyph palette, you can edit text set in Zapfino even further to
  your liking. <BR> <BR>To our knowledge, Zapfino is the most advanced OpenType font
  released for a latin-based alphabet to date.  <BR> <BR>I would personally be interested
  if anyone here would objectively compare Zapfino with Adobe&#39;s recent release,
  the fabulous Bickham Script Pro. Although Bickham Script Pro has a few more glyps
  &#40;1700&#43; to Zapfino&#39;s 1600&#43;&#41;, and Bickham has three complete weights,
  in comparison to Zapfino&#39;s two, the amount of encoded contextual features is,
  as far as I can tell, far larger in Zapfino. <BR> <BR>The programming of this new
  verion of Zapfino was done by Adam Twardoch. <BR> <BR>Here are two images showing
  a bit of the potential of the new Zapfino. I created the first by setting text in
  the new Zapfino, with all OpenType features turned off. With old versions of Zapfino,
  this is what you would have gotten by using just the Zapfino One font. In the second
  image, I selected the text, and turned on two OpenType features: Discretionary Ligatures,
  and Contextual Alternatives. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/55692.gif"

  in General Discussion instead of in News, because I&#39;d like to hear what you
  think about the new Zapfino &#40;or even of the old Zapfino&#39;s, Hermann Zapf&#39;s
  calligraphy, or anything else'

    me this weekend, while trying to explain what opentype does &#40;without a computer&#41;,
    that I couldn&#39;t do it very well. I use the excuse that the people to whom
    I was trying to explain it are even more visually dependent than myself. <BR>

    some not so well.

  body: I was just looking at this today and it is really cool. I was wondering when
    there would be an OpenType of this font. The glyph substitution seems to be extremely
    complicated, and I would be interested to see how Adam programmed this. It would
    be great if he or someone else who is very OT-savvy to write a tutorial on doing
    similarly sophisticated substitions. &#40;Or are there such tutorials already?&#41;

  body: It is very complicated, indeed. It would be interesting to compare OpenType
    feature files between Zapfino Extra Pro and Bickham Script Pro; Adam posted &#40;on
    another list I think&#41; that Zapfino may actually outdo Bickham in complexity
    of contextual substitutions. It&#39;s possible, but in any case it&#39;s great
    to have another typeface of such complexity out there. <BR> <BR>Nobody has published
    a particularly detailed tutorial, but it&#39;s a subject that has been discussed
    in various OT feature production seminars. We&#39;ll be posting the feature file
    for Bickham Script Pro shortly, which should help. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T

  body: 'I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the lookups for Zapfino Extra Pro were more
    complex than those for Bickham Script Pro. I drafted a memo on Zapfino OT for
    Linotype when Adam started on the project, outlining our experience making the
    Apple version and suggesting what might be done for OpenType. I&#39;m really glad
    Linotype decided to go &#39;whole hog&#39; and do the major contextual work. <BR>
    <BR>One of the reasons the Zapfino lookups may be more complex than Bickham Script&#39;s
    is that there are a lot of possible combinations among the Zapfino stylistic variants
    that actually look quite bad -- e.g. letters with clashing extenders --, so one
    of the big tasks in Zapfino would be to ensure that chaining contextual lookups
    do not result in combinations that look bad. I think there are probably fewer
    problematic instances in Bickham Script because there is greater regularity in
    the design. Zapfino is a difficult design to work with well. If you compare the
    two illustrations Dan provided, there is no doubt that the lower one is more exciting,
    but the upper one is tidier. It is quite easy to make a mess with Zapfino, and
    I wonder if Adam might have made a bit too much use of the looped <i>d</i> forms:
    these can overwhelm the forward movement of the script. The contextual stuff is
    really great, but to get the very best out of &#918;apfino typographers will still
    need to manually adjust the results with any eye to the overall composition. Bickham
    Script is more forgiving. <BR> <BR>And I really wish Hermann would draw some terminal
    forms, so that words don&#39;t end with the long tail going nowhere. When users
    were querying the radical differences between the Zapfino that shipped with the
    first version of OSX and the one that shipped with Jaguar, I encouraged them to
    think of Zapfino -- which had already been through two incarnations before Apple
    licensed it -- as a kind of typographic laboratory: the font that might never
    be &#39;finished&#39;.'

  body: Hermann Zapf did seem to address the final letter alternate issue in his design,
    John. Zapfino Extra has 16 glyphs specifically intended for use as the closing
    letter of a line. 2 &#34;a&#34;s, 2 &#34;d&#34;s, 4 &#34;e&#34;s, 3 &#34;n&#34;s
    1 &#34;o&#34;, 1 &#34;t&#34;, and 1 &#34;y&#34;. There are also 2 extra swash
    glyphs that may be added onto the crossbar strokes of the &#34;f&#34; or the &#34;t&#34;
    as connectors.

  body: 'Hrant, my Clio Greek, which you saw at ATypI in Rome is based on the smaller
    sizes of Granjon&#39;s Greek &#40;the smallest sizes have the most ligatures,
    which is why I think Greek ligation was functionally employed to be economical
    of space in e.g. foot and margin notes&#41;. There are currently, to my knowledge,
    three Byzantine style Greek fonts that could make very use of really extensive
    OpenType Layout: my Clio &#40;still only partially complete&#41;, Frank Jalleau&#39;s
    digitisation of Garamond&#39;s grecs du roi, and George Mathiopolous&#39; digitisation
    of Zacharias Kalliergis earlier renaissance type. Matthew Carter&#39;s Wilson
    Greek also has a relatively high number of ligatures, but fewer than the renaissance
    models: by the time of the Foulis Press type on which Wilson is based, ligatures
    were disappearing from Greek typography. <BR> <BR>I think you and I probably share
    the view that Granjon&#39;s are the best of the renaissance Greeks. Some commentators
    have tended to downplay them because they are so obviously based on Garamond&#39;s
    grecs du roi, but the fact that they&#39;re derivative doesn&#39;t alter the fact
    that they are much more accomplished than Garamond&#39;s original. Simply, Granjon
    was a better craftsman than Garamond.'

  body: 'Working on the Zapfino Extra LT Pro project was a lot of fun, and a great
    honor. I wouldn&#39;t necessarily consider Zapfino Extra LT Pro and Bickham Script
    Pro direct &#34;competitors&#34;. Both typefaces have different flavor. Bickham
    is a quite formal copperplate script with one set of basic lettershapes and plenty
    of beautiful complicated swashes. Zapfino is less formal, has less swashes but
    more basic shapes. Bickham simulates masterful &#34;slow&#34; calligraphy, Zapfino
    mimics a quicker, free hand. The structures of the features differ a lot as well.
    Since Bickham has less basic forms and more swashes, the features are more tied
    to particular letter combinations, with great care put into smart implementation
    of initial and final forms. Zapfino has more basic forms and less swashes, so
    the focus of the features is a pseudo-randomization. With Zapfino, if you type
    the same word three times, great chances are that each of the renditions will
    be different. The original Zapfino typeface is designed in four separate sets,
    but the principle is that all letterforms can interact with each other. Zapfino
    Extra LT Pro makes it possible for the first time, because all four sets of glyphs
    have &#34;equal rights&#34;. The additional more swashy characters are designed
    to appear less often, and the OpenType implementation follows this principle.
    As with Bickham, Zapfino has contextual rules with the scope that goes beyond
    a word boundary. But generally speaking, the implementation of the OpenType features
    in both fonts is pretty different. I think they both complement each other rather
    nicely.  <BR> <BR>I have made some Zapfino movies. I put some Flash movies at:
    <a href="http://www.twardoch.com/zapfino/" target="_blank">http://www.twardoch.com/zapfino/</a>
    <BR>They are just very plain real-time screen recordings of myself typing in InDesign.
    No tricks, no manual glyph selection. This is a pretty good illustration of the
    amazing effects that you can get by just typing.  <BR> <BR>As explained on <a
    href="http://www.linotype.com/8-36-8-17886/re-introducingzapfino.html" target="_blank">http://www.linotype.com/8-36-8-17886/re-introducingzapfino.html</a>
    the user is still free to touch up and fine-tune the text. You can select specific
    sets manually, enter the swashes, discretionary ligatures etc. But just typing
    gives you a pretty good first start.  <BR> <BR>For anybody interested in details,
    you are welcome to visit TypoTechnica in London: <a href="https://www.linotype.com/forms/typotechnicaform.html"

    he activated discretionary ligatures. This is the reason why all the many loops
    appear -- normally, the dligs should better stay off. John is right: the looping
    forms have indeed pretty extreme impact on the overall appearance of the text,
    so they should be used with care. We had quite some concerns about the issue of
    the looped forms and we put extra care in making sure that they will not be overloaded.
    I reduced the frequency of the looping forms compared to the other forms. There
    is just one looped &#34;d&#34; form out of basic four set, plus there is a discretionary
    &#34;di&#34; ligature. If discretionary ligatures are on, in the word &#34;dedicated&#34;

    that the letter combinations come out in a pseudo-random manner. Therefore, it
    is not really possible to foresee all possible combinations in all languages.
    We did quite some visual testing in various languages.  <BR> <BR>When the contextuals
    are on, you can see that the word &#34;dedicated&#34; comes out differently, depending
    on the surrounding text. As you can see in the text, the extreme swashes &#40;&#34;battlefield&#34;,
    &#34;altogether&#34;&#41; come out from time to time. Of course, you can always
    touch up the text manually. Since the features are contextual, exchanging one
    of the letters &#40;by turning off the contextual alternates feature, activating
    the swash or stylistic alterate feature, activating one of the stylistic set features,
    entering a glyph directly via the Glyphs palette or a PUA Unicode index etc.&#41;
    usually has impact on the remaining text. On the illustration below, in each line,
    I highlighted the glyphs that I manually exchanged -- you will notice that the

  body: "Hi All!\r\n\r\nI've registered just to ask a question about Zapfino Forte,
    and because here is the only place I guess I may get some guidance about my troubles.
    I'm a newbie in Opentype and all, and I thought I'd just get a taste of what it
    looks like, and went ahead, and bought 'Zapfino Forte Extra pro (contextual)'
    from Linotype Homepage, here : \r\n\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/61995/zapfinoextraxprocontextual-font.html\r\n\r\n...
    and it just don't work. in Indesign CS2, I get [Contextual Alternates] and in
    Illustrator CS&CS2, the icon is greyed out. the font I got is very small (about
    60KB), and in my mind, it seems TOO light. I thought that with all the extra stuff
    in there, it would be at least 500KB... \r\n\r\nI know it isn't a Linotype Support
    page, and I contacted them about my perceived issues, but I thought maybe there's
    something I didn't figure out...\r\n\r\nthank you"

  body: "The file size seems right to me\u2014my copy is the same size.\r\n\r\nZapfino
    Forte is not the bold version of Zapfino Extra, but rather a separate, heavier
    font that Hermann Zapf drew to accompany Zapfino Extra.\r\n\r\nIt can be used
    like a bold, but isn't the bold, if that makes sense.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it does
    not have the same number of features that Zapfino Extra has, i.e., it has far
    less glyphs (it doesn't have four variants for each letter, like Zapfino Extra).
    \r\n\r\nWhen you mean that the font doesn't work, I assume that you mean that
    you can't get the OpenType features out of it that are in Zapfino Extra. Does
    it work otherwise, i.e., when you type, does text appear on the screen? If so,
    it would probably seem that the font is actually functioning properly. \r\n\r\nIf
    you need more help, or ever need any assistance with Linotype products, please
    do contact us again at info@linotpe.com, or +49 (0) 6172 484-418 (Phone), or +49
    (0) 6172 484-429 (Fax). I try to help out on Typophile wherever I can, but Linotype's
    support staff does not search or visit this forum often."
