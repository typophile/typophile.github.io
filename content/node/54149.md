  body: The concept behind this expressive typography piece functions independently
    of the color. The concept depends more on the opacity of the typography. In this
    case the color is simply a background, and is part of the color branding of the
    overall site. I choose the colors based on their fresh and bright appearance.
    The colors all have %100 of either c m or y and %50 of one of the other. I know
    it's being viewed in rgb, but I just love the cmyk system!

    it would be good to provide a e-mail address where you can be reached. This would
    be useful to those who might want to ask permission to reproduce something from

  body: "With regard to your original question: I think you don't have to worry too
    much about being too obvious as long as you do the obvious well -- as you have
    on your site. To use a cross-cultural example, think of way that Handel set music
    to the words in his <em>Messiah</em>. You can't get much more literal than he
    did there: when the text says \"shake,\" he shakes the music; when it says \"exalted,\"
    he exalts the music; when it say \"low,\" the notes are about as low as a singer
    can sing. And it's all great, because it done well.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>When

  body: Everytime I see "expressive typography" I think of Herb Lubalin. But some
    of it looks very dated now (and overdone) It's like they've become "tricks" almost.
    Maybe the way forward is similar to what you've done... Strange..it reminds me
    of this book(I can't remember the title) where one typeface is used to communicate
    the meanings of different words graphically...for instance s d r o w k c a b (backwords)
    things like that.
