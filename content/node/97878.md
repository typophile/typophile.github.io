  you can see there are a lot of  variations in the picture (the only thing we had
  left was a low-quality picture that I traced using inkscape, this was probably altered
  by hand at one time)\r\nThe font information has been lost over time and we need
  a font that will match to create new shirts (we are a theatergroup).  We are looking
  for an open font that resembles this.\r\n\r\nThank you!"
