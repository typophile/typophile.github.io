    but maybe the t got cut off. Try adding the t at the end. The Finder may ask if
    you are sure you want to do this--you do. The icon should turn into a StuffIt
    icon. You should be able to just double-click on it to un-stuff the font.\r\n\r\nIf
    it's not a StuffIt archive, I don't know what it is."

  body: "Well, Its a software tool for expanding 'stuffed' / packaged folders, containing
    font files, for example.. :)\r\n\r\n<em>Corporate Blabla.: '..StuffIt Expander
    easily expands and decodes all those files you download from the Web or receive
    in your email. It quickly accesses StuffIt files, unzips zip files created by
    WinZip\xAE and other zip utilities, plus decompresses tar, gzip and bzip files
    for Unix users. Just drag, drop, and you're done! Expander works seamlessly with
    Web browsers such as Internet Explorer\u2122 and Netscape\u2122. From BinHex to
    zip, StuffIt to MIME, Expander accesses more formats, in less time, with zero
    hassles..'</em>\r\n\r\nDav, <a href=\"http://www.formlos.net\" target=\"_blank\">formlos</a>"

  body: StuffIt Expander is free, not a limited-time demo. You don't need StuffIt
    Deluxe just to open StuffIt files.

  body: As far as I'm concerned, if you could get along without Stuffit Deluxe altogether,
    you'd be better off. Allume Systems, the successor to Aladdin Systems, really
    made a hash of v9 for PC...
