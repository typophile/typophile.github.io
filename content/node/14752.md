body: "When a Type1 font is sent to a non-postscript printer, say a home office laser
  printer, what happens? and is it really detrimental to the output? When a PDF containing
  embedded Type1 fonts and illustrator or freehand vector art is printed to a non-postscript
  printer, what happens? and is it really detrimental to the output?\r\n\r\nEmpirical
  evidence suggests that subtle curves come out jagged, is this the case? Is there
  a way to print a postscript document to a non-postscript printer without degrading
  the quality, or is there no qualitative difference to begin with?"
