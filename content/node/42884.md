  Zak and Barry Lavender on custom type and branding. You can see some examples of
  Peter and Barry's custom work, as well as branding they've done for John St., at
  www.tweektype.com.\r\n\r\nAs usual we'll be finishing up the evening with an informal
  gathering at the Firkin which is a great chance to meet some new creative types
  from Toronto.\r\n\r\nIt's going to be a good night and I hope to see any Toronto
  based typophiles there! The talk starts at 7pm and takes place at the Arts & Letters
  Club - 13 Elm st.\r\n\r\nwww.typeclub.com\r\n"
