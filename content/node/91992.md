  this ATF brochure was published? The back cover, pictured below, lists their offices,
  which, I would think, might help identify the year. Where would I find a chronology
  of what offices ATF had open in what cities for given years?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ATF_Brochure2_3474.png]"

  body: The old-style abbreviations for names of states (<em>Cal., Mass., Mich.,</em>
    etc.) dates it before 1963, when the USPS introduced the standard 2-letter abbreviations.
