body: I found this old oil can in a local museum and had to take a photo. I'm trying
  to identify the typeface used for "PRAIRIE CITY OIL CO." It looks similar to Copperplate
  in many ways but a bit more condensed with some curled 'C's. Anyone might know where
  I can find a digital version of this font or trace down a better specimen that'd
  be great.

  body: "I love the character of these old labels. This design seems to date from
    about 19oo. Hand-lettering -- note the variation in letters such as C -- but some
    features are familiar. The \"Detroit\" angled serifs are used in fonts like Brothers
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/brothers-ot/ but here the letter-forms are
    rounded instead of angled. \r\nDon"

  body: Yeah, I was going to say, Fairplex is the Emigre "Detroit serif" font, Brothers
    is more of a Latin-meets-Grecian. Easily confused though, Emigre fonts with similar
    expressions and evocations. :)

  body: "MANUFACTURED ONLY BY THE PRAIRIE CITY OIL CO: I agree with Ryuk that Billhead
    1900 is a good starting point for duplicating most of the letters, modified by
    adapting the top half of Billhead 1890 for the _C_. You have to do a fair amount
    of clipping of some but not all mini-serifs, flatten the dished ends of the strokes,
    and do various adjustments to get it right. I would use the lowercase version
    of the letters:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Billhead1900PrairieCityOilTypophile116061_3873.jpg]\r\nThe
    source of the curls on Billhead 1890 is unknown, but I suggest that it might be
    Art Gothic http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hihretrofonts/art-gothic-hih/\r\nDon"

  body: Great finds. <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letterheadfonts/lhf-billhead-1890">Billhead</a>
    looks like a great starting point. I thought about recreating the letters myself
    in Illustrator but was having trouble seeing the detailing on the serif style
    in my sample. Does anyone have access to some early 1900 type specimens? Any online
    resources.
