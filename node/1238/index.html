The scale of the New York attack was impressive for non-state sanctioned killing, but there are people who spend every day for years living with terrorism and war in their towns and cities. So perhaps this is how we should remember '9/11': by calling to mind the people who have lived through so many atrocities that they don't keep track of the dates any more.</div>

Thats where WNYC's tranmitters were, as I was watching I saw the 2nd jet live go into the 2nd tower. It was desturbing enough I had to get out on my bike in Central Park. I was riding for about 1/2 hour when steams of people were walking across the park, I didn't associate it with the WTC, but what happened is the city shut itself down and since the trains weren't running they had to walk home. The by product of the tragedy is Mahanttan had been in a bad recession and was made worse. We are still in recession two years later.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">In the immediate aftermath of the attacks, for a couple of weeks, I think there was an increase in kindness and concern for others that was pretty widespread in the USA. It's the natural first response to tragedy, to try to help, to try to support, and only later do people start thinking about blame and revenge. I remember Tom Milo at the ATypI conference in Copenhagen, relating the epic story of his roundabout journey from California back to Europe in the aftermath of the attack: he described the consideration shown to everyone stranded at the various airports, the volunteerism, and the lack of selfishness, and remarked that he'd felt privileged to have been there and witnessed it. This from someone else who was in Lebanon during the civil war, albeit as a UN intelligence officer rather than as a civilian with the front line in his living room. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It was only as the dust settled, literally, and the people like Ashcroft and Rumsfeld began to exploit the situation that the ugly side came out.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">My son was less than half a mile away, near the Brooklyn Bridge, when the burning towers collapsed. In that moment he lost his youth, though he is still in his 20's. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->He followed a path like many of his computer-studies classmates of working in the dot-com boom, and then going to work for financial companies after the bust. Three of his graduating class were murdered in the 9-11 attack.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Art was used to express grief and anger. My son told me that a poster immediately appeared many places in lower Manhattan - where my son and daughter (she watched the collapse from her rooftop at a safe distance) live. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It was never photographed or reported in the press, to my knowledge. It was a variation on the famous 'I want you' recuitment poster with 'Uncle Sam' pointing at the viewer. (I know it is based in turn on a British poster.) The variation was that instead of pointing at the viewer, Uncle Sam had an upturned middle finger, and the caption was 'We're coming to get you motherf***er.'  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;This good guys v bad guys stuff is ridiculous. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I agree that being simplistic is a very serious problem in political thinking, especially about foreigners. But there are bad guys. The Taliban qualify. They deserved what they got.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->America is often the good guy and sometimes the bad guy. It is complicated. But the knee-jerk anti-Americanism I read on these boards I think is seriously misguided, and the product of simplistic and dangerous 'black and white' thinking. It is a cheap way to feel superior, not a result of real understanding.   <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The main problem with it is not that America doesn't do stupid and bad things. It is that most governments in the world are so much worse that they can't even be mentioned in the same breath as far as badness. My wife has worked all over the world in a UN organization, and is of the very well informed opinion that the reason most of the poverty and misery in the world is due to bad governments, many of which have been just gangsters, mafias. The US government is not, and never has been this bad, and that is why it has peace and prosperity - uneven though these are - within its borders.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Right now the US is at its peak of power in the world. If the Taliban had the same power, you would know what bad is.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Also this stuff about the US being so narrow minded and intolerant is crap. I am in an inter-racial marriage, and know people here from all over the world, including many multi-national and multi-racial couples. And they vote with their feet to come here because it is so tolerant. Again, this is by comparison. There are plenty of American bigots. It is just that most other societies are much more intolerant than the US.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don't particularly want to argue about all this on these boards. I want to learn about type from all of the wonderful typofiles here. But on this day, as the question was raised, I thought it might be appropriate to introduce a little balance and get people to think twice about their knee jerk anti-Americanism.</div>

No. Lets spend all our emotions on hating that repulsively smug rich frat boy, GWB.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Why not go further and condemn the US for throwing out Hitler and Musolini?

		<div class="commentbody">Steve, because my wife has worked for many years on problems of poverty in less developed countries, I discuss them practically every night, and am very well aware of the challenge of helping these countries.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The view of my wife, who comes from one of these countries, is that the primary responsibility for the misery of these countries is the leadership in them, and that those in the West who think that the US or Europe controls everything are patronizing and wrong. The indulgence and support of rotten regimes by both America and Europe have, though, exaserbated the problems.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I am very distressed about our policies that hurt poor countries. And I am in despair that the left and the right are pretty clueless about what is actually going on.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For example, GW recently paid off rich American farmers with huge subsidies - against his supposed free market principles and in a craven attempt to buy votes in farm states.   <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This move will wreck the ability of legions of farmers in poor countries to earn a livelihood from farming, and drive them in desparation to the city slums - and incidentally many poor central americans across our borders. The only thing that can be said not to condemn this policy as distinctively devilish is that the agricultural policies of the European Union are even worse - More protectionist, more subsidies undercuting the ability of those in poor countries to making a living by competing fairly.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Since trade arguably has a much bigger impact than aid on the poor countries are you denouncing Tony Blair and Jacque Chirac and other European leaders for causing the starvation of millions? Or is your ire just reserved for GW?  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->European anti-americanism is a cheap substitute for real understanding and sound policy.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->-Just blame the US and get indignant, when in fact the problems and the solutions are very complex, and involve the US and Europe and Japan changing their policies. And most of all the leadership in the poor countries needs to change or actually starting to care about their people. Whenever they do, the countries actually experience economic growth, and fewer people go hungry.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Are you denouncing those in poor countries who are actually most responsible for the plight of their people?

The US created Saddaam, but now that they need the borders of Iraq to serve as their self-validating terrorist threat (now that Afghanistan is no longer useful in that capacity) as well as a source of oil alternative to Saudi Arabia, they got rid of him (quite possibly by simply telling him it was time to go). There are so many realities you conveniently ignore, it's impossible to think you're doing anything but rehashing what you were fed as a child. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And if Americans really wanted to, a fraction of the people who currently starve to death would suffer that fate. But they don't, because their system has taught them to care first and foremost about their selves. Your society is decrepit. A simple rummage through the trashcan of the average American establishes this instantly. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->With power comes responsability - this is the one thing that the US has to take to heart, otherwise it will continue to be the overgrown teenager with the biggest club. The entire foundation of your political thought is based on the contrivance that your government is sound. It is not. Your leaders are murderous thieves, and worst of all the population supports them - not because they're as bad, they don't realize what's going on - but because they've been brainwashed since birth to think the US is good overall. It is not. It has become the single greatest cause of misery to the greatest number of people on Earth. Why? To feed its own obese shell of a society. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You're severely outnumbered here for one reason only: this is an international forum, with people who have not suffered your brainwashing.

And it happen in any situations, good and bad. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I will not blame the hot temperature and French politicians in holidays during August because we've got 15000 people (more than usual numbers) died in France during August 2003. And not make an incredible case of that. Its the life, as I say before, its up to each of us to find good way to make our future better (some will giving their time to non-gov organisations, etc.) Its not by giving lessons to others about what they need to do or not to do. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Action is better than words?</div>
