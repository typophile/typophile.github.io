  a logo and supplied it in svg, pdf, jpeg, png (typefaces outlined).\r\n\r\nThe client
  sent it to a freelance prototype engineer who contacted me for the font. I explained
  that the font was altered, creating custom logo and outlined -so having the font
  won't help. His response:\r\n\r\n\"Okay,\r\n If you are not willing to send me the
  TFF file for this font I am going to have to go buy it for $106. I am not going
  to do this to use it just one time. I am not going to redraw it line by line either.
  You used it on your design so it would be nice to use it on the product. Give me
  a break here\u2026\"\r\n\r\n(the font is actually $45)\r\nBottom line: Is it custom
  to also include the font when supplying a logo to client? \r\n"

    or finding legitimate but less restrictive options) i must say that i think it's
    a good idea for designers to include either \"fonts not included\" or \"extra
    license fees\" in estimates and contracts.\r\n\r\nit seems that the common practice
    of designers sending fonts to printers is what got us into this absurd EULA mess
    in the first place and, as has been detailed in several other threads, the public
    and the industry needs to be educated. \r\n\r\ni'm currently working on a project
    where i have had to inform my client that foundries with specific restrictions
    on their EULA will not be considered in the design process, and even then the
    fonts ultimately chosen will have to be licensed separately by the client for
    further use."

    It has some issues right now, but hopefully those can be resolved.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Curious. Why would a prototype engineer need the font unless he is also doing
    design work?\r\n\r\nIf the font is going to be part of the client's corporate
    ID/branding the client should license the font for use among the company's staff
    of freelance designers. The fact that you used it in developing the logo doesnt
    obligate you to provide it to other designers. This is something you should take
    up with the client (not this designer). If he doesnt want to pay for the licensing
    maybe this guy should just pick another font.\r\n\r\nBut I know what kind of dilemma
    this can be. You want to continue working with this client and you dont want to
    be perceived as difficult to work with. My advice: explain it to them in a conscientious
    way that they are paying for your design services - not your software. Like you
    said, there's a learning curve, part of your job is to help educate them. But
    if they cant respect your professional practices, maybe they're not worth keeping
    as a client."

    the logo to a product. Additionally, the type was converted to outlines then altered
    so the logo can't be recreated simply using the font. \r\n\r\nIn general, I outline
    all art for clients and edit myself if needed. I\u2019ve had clients purchase
    fonts for crossplatform which hasn\u2019t been an issue (yet do have issues when
    although client purchases face, the layouts not looking as I\u2019ve sent). This
    was first time I was asked for font.\r\n\r\n>re EULA chart at fontembedding.com.

    as a host of info on site that I didn't know .. thanks sii\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: If the engineer wants to "brand" the logo into the product--embossed or debossed,
    we would say--it may be nice to have the font to work with in the CAD program.
    But wouldn't a simple EPS file work just as well?

  body: "\"But wouldn\u2019t a simple EPS file work just as well?\"\r\n\r\nIt certainly
    would. The other reason is that the design was manipulated as part of the design
    process so the type outlines would not match the logo. I can't imagine a logo
    that does not need the outlines tuned for the brandname. \r\n\r\nChrisL"

    to purchase and send the font to them (yes, believe it or not they have a hard
    time buying and downloading using the link I send or they end up buying a different
    version). How do I purchase a font but license it to my client? (yes, I'm buying
