  and I was wondering what printers you have. My business had bought and epson stylus
  pro about 3 months ago and it is such a headache to deal with Leopard and all the
  CS3 programs. So we are thinking about switching to Laser form InkJet.  Does anyone
  have any thoughts or recommendations?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance"

    as well?\r\n\r\nAt the agencies where I've worked, they usually have Canon laser
    copiers... usually, the <a href=\"http://www.raymorgan.com/product/copiers-color/CLC-1180.htm\">CLC

  body: Yes I am in the advertising business too.  We need it to print comps.  I would
    say the color and the easiness to use is the most important.  I will def. check
    out the Canon. Thanks.

  body: "I use laser printers ranging from cheap winprinter up to a well-maintained
    Xerox docutech at home, school and work. For most of what I do, laser output is
    faster, easier, and the color is good enough\u2014especially once I get used to
    tweaking an image to print well on laser. In my experience Epson printers aren\u2019t
    worth the hassle if there\u2019s any other option; their engineers cannot developer
    a good paper feed system to save their lives. At my current office we don\u2019t
    even bother with the headaches associated with inkjets; any job big enough to
    need inkjet work is done at a print shop."

  body: 'Epson inkjets are cheaper initially but the costs really go up once you start
    buying paper and toner. Plus if you don''t use the machine very regularly the
    heads gum up. I can''t say I really recommend them. '
