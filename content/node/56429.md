body: "I'm in my fourth and final year of a design degree and am working on my final
  project. The project is a hypothetical, where the advertising industry ('Madison
  Ave') is feeling the effects of the global recession and is embarking on a widespread
  advertising campaign. The whole thing is very much anti-advertising, and is designed
  to highlight how the idea of 'the consumer' is really a product of the advertising
  industry. [[http://www.danflan.com.au/links/poster.jpg|This]] might give you a better
  idea of the whole idea, or if your really keen I've posted my brief up [[http://danflan.com.au/madisonave/?page_id=2|here]].\r\n\r\nAnyway,
  although its all early stages at the moment, I'm up to the visual identity bit (small
  part of the assignment, but pretty important for everything to come), and am eager
  to get some outside feedback.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Post1_1_6202.jpg]\r\n\r\nVisually,
  the aim of the identity is to appear slightly detached from the content. I want
  the logo to be somewhat ambiguous \u2014 playfully neutral \u2014 and hardly distinguished
  from a design one might expect from companies manufacturing pharmaceuticals or light-globes.
  Aside from a few clues, the logo that I have identified doesn\u2019t say all that
  much about the \u2018client\u2019, and isn\u2019t supposed to.\r\n\r\nThe alternate
  ideas all had a few issues associated with them (the first one is a bit cliche,
  the second one doesnt scale well), but have included them here for good measure.\r\n\r\nFinally,
  I know this is probably too much to ask, and of course feedback in any form would
  be massively appreciated, but I've set up a blog at [[http://www.danflan.com.au/madisonave]]
  (as an assessable task) to keep track of the project and for this sort of thing
  so any posts on that page would be appreciated beyond belief,\r\n\r\nAnyway, love
  to hear what you think, criticisms and any suggestions,\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nDan
  Flan\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for the suggestion Will,\r\n\r\nIt's something that I considered at
    the start, and then kind of shifted the word Mad to become a smaller secondary
    mark on its own.\r\n\r\nHowever, highlighting the mad subtly would be keeping
    inline with the projects concept, so I'll put together a few more designs keeping
    that in mind,\r\n\r\nI feel like just putting a line under the word is a bit of
    a cop out (and thats probably why I'm not all that happy with the current logo),
    but any weight, colour or face changes would probably make it a bit too obvious..
    Do you have any ideas?\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nDan"

    The shape is supposed to be a TV screen (I guess that's what YouTube was probably
    going for as well..) \r\n\r\nAlthough I still like the look of a few of those
    shapes in series, I would be kind of happy to ditch that shape anyway because
    making the t.v. association is really pigeon holing advertising to just one type
    of advertising.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Post1_2_6700.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    putting the shape to one side, and taking Wills suggestion on board, I have put
    these together as a start,\r\n\r\nLove to hear out of these, what direction \u2014
    if any \u2014 everyone thinks is appropriate\r\n\r\nDan\r\n\r\n"

    I didn't think that the first one resembled Youtube. I very much liked colour
    choice. But two lines under AD were distracting, because they looked like illegible
    text under main headline.\r\n\r\nFrom the latest batch I would like to know, what
    are you trying to emphasize here, because it looks like you can't decide. Is it
    MAD or is it AD? OR would you rather write \"MAD AVE AD\" instead... :)\r\n\r\n@epsilicon:

    strikingly similar to the Mad Men logo. Out of curiosity, do you think that this
    is necessarily a bad thing considering their common origins? Is this (originally
    unintended) pop-culture reference at all appropriate?\r\n\r\nIncidentally, Mad
    Men season 1 is due to air on Australian free to air in the next few weeks, looking

    with Frank Langella who was in Frost/Nixon with Kevin Bacon\r\n\r\nLitera:\r\nI
    really like your suggestion for the name, and in an ideal world I would probably
    run with it. However, such an application would probably go over the head of the
    intended audience. Speaking with people about my project so far, I've found that
    a lot of people\u2014 although liking the name \u2014 have never heard of Madison
    Ave. and those who have often don't make the association with advertising. Being
    clever with the name like that would almost certainly add to the confusion.\r\n\r\nYou're
    completely right about the two lines under AD being distracting and looking like
    illegible text, thanks for that, I'll keep it in mind with upcoming revisions.
    And thank you for liking the colours, I'm also really happy with them.\r\n\r\nTo
    answer your question, as you guessed, I'm being a bit indecisive, but I think
    I'm probably more inclined to highlight the MAD as suggested by William. I'm only
    continuing to highlight the AD to address the above problem of people not linking
    Madison Avenue with advertising. \r\n\r\nWhat do you think? Have I been speaking
    to a select few people who just don't get the reference?\r\n\r\nThanks for your
    words,\r\n\r\nDan\r\n\r\n"

  body: I didn't immediately think of YouTube either. Of course I see the resemblance,
    but it isn't a problem in my opinion. But the shape doesn't really matter for
    the typography, and I think it's good that you're starting to develop that independant
    from the tv-shape. But I wouldn't ditch it just yet because it is slightly reminiscent
    of YouTybe. :)

  body: Hi Ray, fellow Groninger ;) Legibility is the quality of a typeface itself,
    how well you can read it. Readability is how well you can read the design of a
    piece of typography, so the design of the printed page. Or at least... I think.
