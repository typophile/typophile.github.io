  body: "What Mike means is that it was designed as a logo, not a font. You might
    be able to get close with <a href=\"http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=GTT0000003#flont\"
    target=\"_blank\">Chevin Extra Bold Italic,</a> but it's a lot more rigid than
    the Lego logo.\r\n\r\nAs for the font on the website, I don't know it.\r\n\r\n
