  good typography I read (http://www.markboulton.co.uk/journal/comments/five-simple-steps-to-better-typography-part-2),
  and specifically, how to deal with bullet points. Below are 2 images he gives to
  demonstrate how bullet points should and should not look.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/freddesign_bullets1_5834.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  problem here, as Mark Boulton points out, is that modern graphic software such as
  InDesign, is not set up to deal with bullets correctly. I have often been guilty
  of bad typography in this area in the past...when you are doing a project such as
  a credential brochure which needs to get out the door yesterday, it is really easy
  to just use InDesigns basic bullet settings in the style sheet bullet options. And
  in fact for a long time I was probably ignorant to the fact that indented bullets
  which made the text block start indented didnt look quite as good as when it all
  lined up. Anyway, having read the article, I experimented and thought - actually
  this looks MUCH better. Try it yourself, go on!\r\n\r\nHowever the problem still
  remained that to acheive this in InDesign was not easy without doing each text column
  as a seperate text box or doing the bullets in different text boxes etc. What I
  wanted was to be able to flow all the text into one text box divided into columns
  which would still be the correct way to deal with hanging punctuation. Anyway, with
  much experimentation I think this is a good way to achieve good typography when
  dealing with bullet points in InDesign. It is still a work around and I am sure
  many of you have other ways which I would be delighted to hear about.\r\n\r\nFirstly,
  before we start, this process of designing with a page divided into columns requires
  the bullets to be in the column gutter. For this reason it may be neseccary to have
  larger column gutters than usual. This tutorial will be made using paragraph styles.
  For more information on how to use paragraph styles check out here.\r\n\r\nFirst
  step is to set up a column grid. In this case we will use a 4 column grid with a
  gutter width of 7mm. To do this go to Layout > margins and columns.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/freddesign_bullets2_5343.jpg]\r\n\r\nNext
  we will create the text box. Because it is not possible for bullet points to appear
  outside the text box, we must start the text box before the page grid, which then
  allows us to start the bullets before the grid and then indent all the text to align
  with the grid. So for this example we will start the text box at 3.5mm outside the
  margins. So, the text box starts at 6.5mm x value and will be a width of 197mm,
  which also brings it 3.5mm over the final column. Bring up your text frame options
  (object > text frame options) divide the text box into four columns with no gutter
  width. In order for the bullets to work, we will set up the gutter width manually.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/freddesign_bullets3_5021.jpg]\r\n\r\nFor
  the purpose of this tutorial, I have placed in some dummy text, but obviously you
  would flow in the real rext. As you can see it is without much form at the moment.
  So lets add some!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/freddesign_bullets4_4767.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  first thing we will do is style the body text to align with the grid. Bring up your
  paragraph pallette (window > type and tables > paragraph). Put the left indent at
  3.5mm and the right indent at 3.5mm. I have also added some space after, based on
  the leading I have set the font in which in this case is 10pt. Basically what we
  have done here is build in a gutter width, but without using actual gutters. This
  will allow us to control what is actually appearing in the gutter of our column
  grid. If you had set these gutters up in the text box, you would not be able to
  access this space.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/freddesign_bullets5_5519.jpg]\r\n\r\nNow
  we will change this into a paragraph style so we can apply it easily to every other
  section of body text. To do this, highlight a bit of the body text and bring up
  your paragraph styles (window > type and tables > paragraph srtyles). Click on the
  arrow in the top corner and select new paragraph style, I have named mine body text.
  This will now create a paragraph style based on all the spacing we have placed on
  the styled body text. Now we can through and apply this to every section of body
  text, by highlighting or clicking within the paragraph and clicking on the new paragraph
  style. Now all our body text is styled. Your page should now look something like
  this. As you can see, the body text, now indented by 3.5mm on both sides has aligned
  it perfectly with our column grid with 7mm gutters. Now all we need to do is style
  the bullets.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/freddesign_bullets6_5320.jpg]\r\n\r\nWe
  style the bullets in much the same way. First thing we need to do is make a tab
  to specify that after the bullet, the text will line up with the grid. Set the tab
  at 3.5mm. Now bring up the paragraph pallette again (window > type and tables >
  paragraph). We want a left indent of 3.5mm again, and also to put the first line
  spacing as -3.5mm as shown. This will align the bullet 3.5mm outside the column
  grid. I have also given some space after as previously. Now, make this into  paragraph
  style again and apply it to the bullets throughout. Your page should now look something
  like this.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/freddesign_bullets7_3508.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnd
  thats it, doesnt it look nice and neat? Hope you enjoyed this tutorial and it was
  helpful. If anyone has a better way to get a similar effect, would love to hear
  about it! Also, what are your own opinions on how bullets should look?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/freddesign_bullets8_3918.jpg]\r\n\r\nHappy

    results. there's no good way to tune the math behind it, which results in *almost*
    right typesetting.\r\n\r\n@altaira your point is a good one. it's not always preferable
    to have a perfectly smooth type column. if it's important to understand the list
    as subordinate of the preceding paragraph, and indent is a good device."

  body: the other problem is Boulton's sample -- without paragraph spacing, neither
    format works. squint at chasteauneuf's final example and you'll see that it reads
    just fine.

  body: "Thanks for the comments guys.\r\nYeah I have used the optical alignment for
    single quotations but have also struggled with the doubles and the bullets had
    no luck at all. \r\n\r\nI guess its a really good debate as to what example is
    best, and maybe your right that the two correct and incorrect dont portray it
    in the right way. Actually I think Boultons one is almost intended for digital
    use although it doesnt specify. I think the indented bullets stand out more and
    some people say that the point of the bullet is exactly that. I think the classic
    way to do it before graphic software was to have the text line up all the way
    down, but your right it is convention."

    also work.\"\r\n\r\nI agree, I don't think there should be a hard and fast rule
    on this. Put the job in the hands of a good typographer and he or she will come
    up with the best solution with the job at hand. Don't handcuff a typographer or
    graphic designer with rules that are overstated or just a matter of personal taste.\r\n\r\nIf
    you look at the example, there is even an inconsistency on the way the second
    line is indented. In the upper bullet, the second line is indented a space beyond
    the bulleted line and in the second bullet, the second line is indented the same
    as the bulleted line.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    Eagle eyed tho!\r\n\r\nAnd I agree that it is down to a good typographer to decide.
    The fact that it wont go in columns, alone, makes it problematic with some publications.
    What I read, is that it is more traditionally done this way. The eye would scan
    directly down the line and look for a bullet which stood out in the page margin.
    The other point was that bullets are usually indented because of the software
    and not the typographers discretion.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
