  and I decided to do it for Joanna probably because no one else in my class is going
  to choose it. Now, I'm stuck with the task of looking for a superb example use of
  the typeface designed by a contemporary designer...any suggestions?"

    used it instead. Eric Gill's [[Essay on Typography]] was set in Joanna. It was
    reprinted recently\u2026 maybe your school library has a copy?"

    <a href=\"http://www.foliosoc.co.uk/books/\">The Folio Society</a> lying in front
    of me; the \u2018Prospectus 2008\u2019. It is set in [[Joanna]] (Regular, Italic
    and Semibold; accompanied by some [[Gill Sans]]). Then, that\u2019s just adequate,
    well-done \u2013 I won\u2019t call it outstanding or \u2018superb\u2019.\r\nSome
