body: "Ok so after looking around on the web all day I have put together something
  totally different than the previous logo.  Again please be brutal.  I am a beginner
  so the more you tell me the more I learn. Mind you the \"client\" a startup that
  I am helping for free and knows that I am no graphics guru.\r\n\r\nThe one problem
  I am having and I hope you can also give feedback on is how these logos will look
  on things other than printing marketing material.  ie. Company signage, website
  etc.  And I am also not sure how you would put this on a business card which I am
  also in charge of.\r\n\r\nYou guys are great.....I appreciate all the help.  I have
  been looking for a site with knowledgable people and am glad to finally find one.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/EKT

  body: "Hey Kristen, A brand is a symbolic representation of a company, product etc...
    So the first thing I would do is put up what EKT is! \r\n\r\nMy main advice to
    you is to begin with a sketch and don't start on the computer until your sure
    your ready with a solid idea! This is really hard some times and i should take
    my own advice... but i think this would improve your initial design! \r\n\r\nAs
    for the logo its self, it does seem very poor. As a design and a concept, but
    your only starting off so I wouldn't worry about it!... Look at your choice of
    type a little more carefully try to find fonts that aren't free! \r\n\r\nIf you
    like I could send you some good branding companies! if that would help!"

    and just be done with it.

  body: don't use color, gradients, shadows, stretched type, etc for now. concentrate
    on the form and the concept. You'll often find you don't need the 'effects' after
    working on a good concept and form.

  body: "I agree, the font you chose is just downright ugly. Even a logo design newbie
    (like me) can see that it's one of those free fonts you can download from virtually
    anywhere. Even the font you used in your earlier design looks much more professional
    than this one. If you're looking for sans serif fonts you may want to start [[http://www.myfonts.com/browse/category/myfonts/sansserif/|here]].
    Or, if your budget is too tight, you may want to start with one of the fonts that
    came with your operating system (e.g. Helvetica, Lucida Grande, Verdana, ...).
    Good luck!\r\n\r\n[[http://www.designbits.de|Designer Hamburg]]"
