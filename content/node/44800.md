body: "So I'm a young designer hired on by an IT staffing company to do there marketing
  and design in-house. I'm working in the corporate environment for the first time
  and am getting accustomed to meshing High Design and Corporate Ideals. I'm working
  on a logo for a website that is being launched and need some guidance. Here\u2019s
  what we\u2019ve come up with.\r\n\r\nhttp://i138.photobucket.com/albums/q275/sthartl/erplogo.jpg\r\n\r\nHere
  are my challenges:\r\nThe colors are set\r\nThe hexagon shape is required\r\nThe
  web address (with the hyphen) was to easily discernable, i.e. there has to be continuity
  throughout 'erp-consulting'\r\nNeeds to maintain high-end corporate look\r\nThe
  general council is comprised of non-creative so anything over stylized doesn't fly.\r\n\r\nIn
  general what's a good way to manage lots of type in a logo?\r\nAny advice on doing
  creative work in non-creative environments? How do I stay inspired and how so I
  integrate design into the corporate mindset\r\n"

    kerning needs some work. It looks now like you were running out of room at the
    end.\r\nI think it looks much better than their current stuff. \r\n\r\nSharon"

  body: "I think you've come up with pretty strong approach.\r\n\r\n\"Any advice on
    doing creative work in non-creative environments?\"\r\nKeep pushing design on
    them but remember to back it up with how it's going to improve their business
    and improve their ROI. I've learned that working in a non-creative environment
    requires a different strategy on how to present/sell a concept. What will not
    work is describing how 'pretty' a color is or how the idea came to you in a dream.
    Metaphors don't really cut it in this environment. What does work is a mix of
    creative and business lingo. Their about numbers. You're about creativity. Find
    the happy medium and you'll have success. Just keeping pushing design on them.
    They too want to see what you see. They're just afraid of making a decision that
    could ultimately decrease their revenue/stock/professionalism. Gaining their trust
    take time and patience. So hang in there."

  body: "Tre, since you are stuck with the cube and colors, why not establish the
    identity through the type? I feel now it ALL looks a little tired and generic,
    whereas if you take the cube as a starting point and work on typographic treatments
    that mirror the curves and angles I feel you will get something a little more
    memorable.\r\n\r\nSharon is correct about the kerning at the end. Way too tight
    visually compared with the start.\r\n\r\nAlso - what would the .com look like
    at small sizes. The weight seems so thin I imagine you may have issues. \r\n\r\nWork
    out a black and white version too.\r\n\r\nJay"
