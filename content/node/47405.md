  body: "> what kind of effect to try?\r\n\r\nPhotoshop. The most basic: \r\n1. Type
    the word etc; convert to shape.\r\n2.  Layer Styles Blending Options dialog: Advanced
    Blending 35%; Blend Mode: Multiply\r\n3. Apply Layer -> Layer Style > Stroke /
    Inner Glow/ Outer Glow etc etc etc \r\n\r\n\r\nIf it does not work check the electrical
    wall outlet  :^) "
