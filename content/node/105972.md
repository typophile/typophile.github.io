  body: "Mher Nastaliq font is an impressive piece of work. \r\n\r\nNastaliq style
    is really a very big challenge for all type designers. There are a very few character
    based OT Nastaliq fonts available but personally I have found that these available
    fonts can not satisfy a user. Nasrullah Mher has really done a fantastic job.
    \ All the shapes are as perfect as required and this result cannot be achieved
    without high ambition and years of hard work. Till yet it is the only character
    based OT Nastaliq font that gives such a beautiful result. \r\n\r\nI also got
    time to view the above mentioned website. It contains real master pieces of calligraphy.
    Mher Urdu Naskh font also looks very good as compared to available Urdu Naskh
    fonts. \r\n\r\nI congratulate you on your wonderful job. \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nZ.A\r\n"
