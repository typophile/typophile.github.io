  body: "It's a elongated/condensed Latin, similar to <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/latin-extra-condensed/\">Latin
    Extra Condensed</a> from Bitstream. There are a number of interpretations of this
    look, including Adobe Birch, but Birch doesn't have the top serif on the A.\r\n\r\n-
