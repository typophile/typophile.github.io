  body: forgot to mention, there will be some reverse outs and i am hoping to go somewhat
    small on the sizing given the magazine's young demographic.

  body: "Traditionally, Galliard CC is used exclusively as the text face and Mantinia,
    also from Carter and Cone, is used as the display face. However, Galliard does
    have the sharpness needed to function at larger sizes. I would suggest mating
    Galliard to something spanish warm feeling like Bohemia or Eudald or Pradell.
    Ball terminals aid in legibility. Kis might look pretty too.\r\n\r\nMikey :-)"

    old-fashioned, but it looks great (IMHO)."

  body: I have two different editions of a particular legal text. The older set in
    Galliard and the most recent in Minion. I refer to the older one Whenever I can.

  body: I think your question is really what sans-serif goes best with Galliard both
    as display and text...whenever I do a magazine I always use two families, serif
    supplemented by sans, with the sans for sidebars and highlighted material, especially
    if reversed. With Galliard, I would suggest Josh Darden's Freight Sans or ITC
    Franklin Gothic, whose letterforms are very similar to Galliard in their proportions.
    ITC now makes both Galliard and Franklin Gothic with oldstyle figures for all
    weights, never available before, in OpenType format. Freight Sans comes with oldstyle
    figures standard.
