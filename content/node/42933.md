  body: "It's possible it's custom, it's also possible it's a script with alternatives.
    \r\n\r\nI think it's also possible it's a few fonts and some modifications thrown
    together.\r\n\r\n\"Buck\" and \"tate\" look very similar to http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itfmecanorma/script-bold/
    Script Bold. The S might be free hand, or another brush or marker script all together
    (it does look familiar).\r\n\r\nthen if you look at dafont, there's Marcelle which
    could have been the inspiration (it's clearly a modified Script Bold.) http://www.dafont.com/marcelle.font?nb_ppp=50&psize=l&text=Buck+State"
