  (71-74) Any ideas on what they are and if anyone has drawn a digital version?\r\n\r\nI
  suspect the Sicily one is a custom drawn title but the serif 'California' looks
  familiar, I think I've seen it or something comparable elsewhere. \r\n\r\nAny help
  would be much appreciated!\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\n"
