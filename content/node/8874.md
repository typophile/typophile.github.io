body: Hi, <BR> <BR>I know to most this will probably be a ridiculous question. I have
  a G4 powerbook which has 2 memory slots that hold 256mb each. I wish to buy more
  memory and replace one 256mb slot with a 1gb slot. My question is can you use both
  memory slots for different sizes ie. one 256 and the other 1gb or must both memory
  slots have the same memory 1gb and 1gb or as it is 256mb and 256 mb. <BR> <BR>Thanks
  for any help.
