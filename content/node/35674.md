  redesigning visual identity  and entire website so I started to work on logo.. You
  can check out logo on the website above.\r\n\r\nMy plan is to make minimal intervention
  on the logo itself - im trying to make it look more \"modern\" so i'm looking for
  some serif Bodoni or Didot lookalike.. If someone has a suggestion i'll be happy
  to hear it"

    Ralph Lauren]], which says \"rich white guys riding around in yachts\" to me.\r\n\r\nMy
    only change would be to bring down the size of the S in Pivatus, and extend \"yachting\"
    and the logo over it. Yeah, you lose some of the symmetry, but then when they
    inevitably make the boat captain's hats for the club, they can emphasize the \"P\".
    Maybe with little laurels.\r\n\r\n-Andrew Welfle"

    you are right\r\n\r\nThank you all.. I'm working on several different solutions
    and for that \"classical\" version I think I found the right font set http://www.typography.com/catalog/didot/"
