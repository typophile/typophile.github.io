  placed as a Forum Topic or Blog for help, but here goes: I have been asked to create
  a folded leaflet for NHS Employability. It will be a 6 page DL (flat size A4 - folded
  twice to DL).\r\n\r\nI have created 3 colums with 4mm gutters. Type will be Frutiger
  - 14pt for headings and 11pt for body copy - there is a 2pt leading for the body
  copy and all text is aligned to the baseline grid.\r\n\r\nI was wondering if these
  measurements would be suitable for a leaflet like this - as it is the first time
  I have used InDesign and the first time I have created something for print. If anyone
  could offer any advice with the measurements or suggest alternative fonts to have
  the best impact in this medium, I would be extremely grateful.\r\n"

    members here are, you can't expect them to be able to picture what you're talking
    about without a visual.

  body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nThank you for the replies. At the moment, the only 'visual'
    I have is two pieces of paper with the text typed and pictures stuck to the paper
    - supplied by the department requesting the leaflet.\r\n\r\nMy job is to create
    something more professional from this. As I am new to InDesign (i'm a web designer
    and this is my first print job).\r\n\r\nMy apologies for dropping this on people
    here. I have spent all day reading different ideas of what is the best grids,
    baseline and leading points for print work of this size. All seem to suggest different,
    so I guess I will just go with one. There seems to be a lack of decent InDesign
    tutorials on the internet."

  body: "There are two ways to approach it. If you are just starting out, the look
    of a virginal empty page could be a little intimidating (heck, it still gives
    me the shivers) and starting a layout with predetermine grid settings might help
    you out to overcome that, or it might drive you deeper into a corner and inhibit
    imagination. Another way, is to sketch the initial layout, get your copy onto
    the page, then play with it for a little while on a purely aesthetic level, before
    setting for a particular grid system. Once you get a little more experience, you'll
    begin relying more on particular combination that you've found to work well, but
    in order to get there, it might help to start by working \"organically\".\r\n\r\nJust
    my two cents.\r\n_____________________________________________\r\nPersonal Art

  body: "I don't think reading about grids is the best way to start a design. I think
    you should try a more intuitive approach as suggested by oprion. Mock up the page,
    flow the type in, print it out, see how it looks, play around. Or sketch it.\r\n\r\nwww.lynda.com

    a bit longer than I wanted, hah) studying Illustration and Graphic Design (and
    Fashion, Fine Arts, Painting, Drawing, Lithography, etc), after fiddling around
    with doing lay\u2013outs for my \u2018High School\u2019 magazine for three years.
    Then I went into pro illustration and visualising, doing design jobs on the side
    (paste up, anyone remember that?)\r\nNext I discovered the Mac (somewhere in the
    later part of last century), taught myself QuarkXPress. Did Graphic Design. With
    Quark for 14 years. Switched to InDesign when OS X became \u2018it\u2019. Worked
    with ID for the last 6 or 7 years and now you want me to tell you how to do the
    MOST SIMPLE JOB THERE IS?\r\n\r\nLearn! Experience! Teach yourself! The Internet
    is there to help you, giving you the opportunity to look at a lot of stuff. And
    ID has a very good Help-function.\r\n\r\n(Sorry if this is rant-ish \u2014 young

    may be easiest to use an existing design to give yourself a starting point, and

    for something that was not easily answered, at times I have asked similarly demanding
    questions. For me it stems from the anxiety of being new to something rather than
    being young \u2014 There are 14 year old web/interactive designers who would run
