  body: "I spent a lot of time looking at several sites and thousands of sans fonts.
    I never saw anything close. My suspicion is that there is a font with some alternate
    letters which don't usually show in 'test drives'. Do you have samples showing
    G, M and R?\r\n\r\nAny clues about the age and origin of the sample?\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Mike,\r\nhere are some additional samples, as suggested. G was only in bold.\r\n\r\nThey
    are from a company leaflet from about mid last year. I tried to look up the most
    used production suites and even word processors, but without success. How is it
    with alternate letters? I suppose I can only look them up one by one, right?\r\n\r\nBob\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sample

  body: If it is from a company leaflet there is a chance that this is a custom corporate
    typeface, therefore not showing up in the usual places. Can you disclose the name
    of the company?
