  that will pair well with a logotype that uses Basic Commercial Black: http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/basic-commercial-lt/\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance.\r\n"

    set tight, loose, in all caps, with background, in a box etc.?\r\n\r\nBtw. it's
    not necessarily good that a corrosponding serif shares too much design with the
    logotype face. Think of contrast, tension.\r\n\r\nYou might ask for a serif that
    works with Akzidenz Grotesk (BC is [identical] similar design), some folks knows
    AG better."

  body: "Thanks for all the comments. Don't have a picture yet, but I like to set
    it fairly tight. No box or background.\r\n\r\nI think Miller Display is the best
    option I've found so far.\r\n\r\nAs far as the serif, I'm looking at trying to
    make Basic Commercial or Akzidenz Grotesk work with a condesnece modern/transitional
    serif. "
