    which seems to be identical, <i>but, again, I am not too sure about the &#39;free&#39;

    target="_blank">&#39;Big Truck&#39;</a> with 1993 copyright by COSMI, according
    to the information at the Flyerstarter site. It is also distributed as freeware
    here and at a number of other sites.

  body: Mike, what&#39;s up with this site? Are they giving away commercial fonts
    for free?

  body: A font can by copyrighted and still made available for free distribution.
    Many designers do it as a way to promote their work. I don&#39;t know for sure
    whose design this is, however, because I thought Blades had a 1992 file date &#40;it&#39;s
    in my Script Guide&#41;. I didn&#39;t look around the rest of that site -- it
    was just one of the ones that seemed to have the most information about the font.

  body: Blades may well be a free font but I noticed they&#39;re also giving away
    Baskerville and Base 9 and 12, which are definitely commercial fonts.

  body: I&#39;m not defending or endorsing the site. As I said I found it &#40;using
    Fontseek&#41; as one with information about the font. I didn&#39;t check anything
    else about the site at the time I posted that response. &#40;Baskerville doesn&#39;t
    have to be a commercial font, just like Caslon and Garamond are open for digitization
    by anyone. Of course if it&#39;s a copy of another foundry&#39;s rendition of
    Baskerville, that&#39;s a no-no.&#41; <BR> <BR>Most of us here know which fonts
    are commercial ones that have no business being on a site for free downloads.
    If Yves wants to delete  the mention of it and the link, I would have no problem
    with that.

  body: Maybe they&#39;d appreciate knowing about the site, so they could send them
    a polite &#39;cease and desist&#39; notice. &#40;Or threaten to sue them into
    poverty like Linotype has done when someone even uses a name like one of their
    fonts.&#41; I also saw Letraset, Bitstream and Image Club fonts in their free
    download list -- they even cite the proper copyright information! <BR> <BR>I have
    actually written to the Flyerstarter site owners, just a few minutes ago, to suggest
    they remove the commercial fonts from their site before they attract attention
    they absolutely don&#39;t want, unless they truly have approval to offer those
    as free downloads. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll be curious to hear their response.

  body: And while most of us do indeed know which fonts are commercial, the same can
    clearly NOT be said for a lot of the first-time posters who ask, once a font has
    been ID&#39;d for them, &#34;and now where can I get it for free?&#34;

    effect - but it doesn&#39;t seem to have happened. <BR> <BR>Then again, judging
    from how many posts have the title &#34;what is this font?&#34; I don&#39;t think
    a lot of people read the fine print.

  body: Hi Guys, <BR> <BR>Came across this thread after being contacted by Mike Yanega.
    <BR> <BR>We just added a large batch of what were thought to be all &#39;in the
    clear&#39; fonts to Flyerstarter.  <BR> <BR>We have responded to a couple emails
    from font authors requesting font removals and have fulfilled their wishes immediately.  It
    was not known that there was a larger volume of fonts that may be commercial.
    <BR> <BR>As an earlier poster stated, many fonts can be copyrighted but freely
    distributed, etc. You can appreciate the volume of work necessary to proof thousands
    of fonts if you are not a full-time Typophile who automatically knows the blatantly
    commerical fonts.  <BR> <BR>As I responded to Mr. Yanega, we will remove any fonts
    that someone points out as being commercial or copyright-ambiguous right away.
    It is of course not in our best interests to host these fonts.  <BR> <BR>We are
    not a .ru hacker site interested in sporting illicit fonts; our main business
    is consigning digital art for sale from independent designers, for which we respect
    and rely on intellectual property laws. <BR> <BR>I, personally, ask that you not
    inflame any foundries by notifying them of their fonts on Flyerstarter, but would
    rather ask you to spend the time instead writing me with the fonts that should
    not be on there - they will be taken down right away. <BR> <BR>Cheers and Happy
    New Year, <BR>Keith Tuomi <BR><a href="http://www.flyerstarter.com" target="_blank">www.flyerstarter.com</a>

  body: Further to the previous post, I have gone through and removed all the Letraset
    and Emigre fonts from our site.  <BR> <BR>As our collection is not database-driven,
    it means manually searching the HTML and Googling to find fonts from particular
    foundries aka. it takes quite a bit of time, 2 hours for those two foundries alone.
    <BR> <BR>Please bear with us as we seek and destroy fonts that shouldn&#39;t be
    there.  Any help is appreciated.

  body: Keith,  <BR>Thanks for posting to this thread and for your e-mail response
    to me. I for one, will try to spend some time looking for &#39;fonts that shouldn&#39;t
    be there&#39;, but you can also eliminate Image Club by searching for &#39;ICG&#39;
    in the name; and Bitstream by searching on &#39;BT&#39;.  <BR> <BR>I can understand
    how you might have unintentionally gotten in this situation by taking large dumps
    from &#39;donors&#39;, but you can now see how risky that is, since there are
    many ways fonts become illegally distributed. I accept that you do not want to
    contribute to the problem of font piracy, and say thanks for cooperating.
