<p>And if you&rsquo;re &ldquo;personally feeling too ambivalent about this to help,&rdquo; then don&rsquo;t help. But stop trumpeting your ambivalence on a type ID board.</p>
<p>Maybe we should have  Touchy-feely, Warm-fuzzy, Rant-of-the Hour,  I-just-need-to-vent, Whiny-snively, and Ambivalence forums. Oh, wait, isn&rsquo;t that what General Discussions is for?</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The font file has been renamed with the name of the website instead of keeping the original name. So I wanted to find out what the original name is.&quot;</em> I doubt that. That would mean you could only download one font from the site, since you can&rsquo;t have more than one file with the same name in the same directory. Most font programs, including free font viewers and Windows own tools, should provide this information. If Plantin was renamed Planter&rsquo;s Peanuts, then that&rsquo;s a different story.</p>
<p><em>I don’t think it might be good for us to tell you what it is, because it might be a knockoff.</em> What if he wants to buy the original?</p>

But it was mentioned earlier and I agree that this can be put in the General Discussion area.
As I understand the type ID board is for identifying an unidentified typeface. Which was beginning to happen before you decided to change the topic to yourself and created the friction.</p>
<p>I want to have the thread deleted because it has turned into an argument and it now focused on that instead of finding out what the font is called. It is not a good record to have and I think it is better for it to be removed so it is all behind us.</p>

<p>Do you think the ID section should act like it&rsquo;s not part of Typophile? Do you think a person should identify a typeface even if they feel it might be unethical? Do you think covering up friction reduces the chances of more friction in the future, or increases it? Do you really believe that somebody who can help you is holding back because of this friction? If so, could it because of the second question above?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m only asking these questions because I think trying to answer them might help, in ways more important than IDing a single font. It might help for <em>every</em> font ID, not just this one. Which is not to say that any question can only have one correct answer. I think the act of communicating clearly and candidly helps us as a whole, if sadly not always individually.</p>
<p>Nobody has to join me in this sort of &ldquo;philosophizing&rdquo;, but throwing insults won&rsquo;t help - it increases the friction in an unproductive direction. I have not attacked you; I simply tried to explain myself, and everybody is free to ignore that.</p>

In this instance, takashikato78 has done nothing wrong. <strong>If</strong> there is an instance plagiarism, it is neither the poster nor the identifier who are guilty, but the plagiarist. Given that it was requested, I merely cautioned against posting the URL of the site in question — as is clearly stated in our guidelines — and requested the source.</p>

<p>Your quote from Typophile guidelines &ldquo;please do not post links to site which offer unauthorized downloads of commercial fonts&rdquo; does not apply to takashikato78 but to type iders I believe.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you think the demand &ldquo;EMAIL ME THE URL OF THE SITE IN QUESTION&rdquo; (my emphasis) is a form of &ldquo;beating up&rdquo;? There can be no plagiarizing charge before the Typeface is identified. The OP provided a sample of the font, not the font itself. No one has identified any font to my knowledge, much less shown any plagiarization.</p>
<p>People regularly post samples from random or illegal sources. People regularly post bespoke samples. Typophile Id experts frequently request source. If the OP decides not to give, Typophile can stop helping.</p>
<p>Since Typophile does not pursue any of these samples in the past, why the sudden interest in investigating takashikato78?</p>
<p>@Hrant. Too many questions (and too many quotes). Pick a few good ones in your next post. This should not be about Hrant and definitely is not about Dick.</p>

<p>The phrase “<em>please do not post links to site which offer unauthorized downloads of commercial fonts</em>” from the <strong><a href="http://typophile.com/readme">Typophile forum posting guidelines</a></strong> applies to everyone.</p>
<p>I came across this thread and noticed takashikato78 say “<em>The website I do not think is importnat in this case - since the sample is on this forum post</em>.”</p>
<p>In this instance, there was an identifiable source, so I inquired by asking takashikato78 to email me directly, thus avoiding posting a URL which does not abide by our guidelines.</p>
<p>I used the term “investigate” in regards to the site in question. Not takashikato78. <strong>I am not investigating takashikato78 for anything</strong>.</p>
<p>As far as accusations of plagiarism (of which there are none) of course you would need to know the URL of a suspect site in order to determine if it hosting plagiarized typefaces.</p>
<p>And just because someone hasn’t done something in the past, doesn’t mean they shouldn’t strive to do so in the future. Typophile didn’t exist 14 years ago.</p>

Even though there is very little &ldquo;cross-pollination&rdquo; between the ID section and the rest of Typophile (you can tell because when an ID is posted outside the ID section, nobody replies) the ID section is still part of fostering Typophile&rsquo;s image, hence relevance and usefulness. Some type designers -the reason Typophile exists- get disgusted and leave when they see their craft disrespected.</p>
<p>This is not an attack (as it contains no opinion) but a statement of fact:
On a number of occasions Dick has stated that a correct ID is his primary motivation, and nothing should inhibit that; he has also confronted people who don&rsquo;t adhere to this philosophy. I only single him out because nobody else here has done those things.</p>
<p>I will have to leave it up to moderators and fellow Typophiles to decide whether such behavior is actionable. Also however, I would like to request some guidance in terms of what somebody like me should do when witnessing IDing activity that seems to violate Typophile guidelines, in letter <strong>or</strong> spirit.</p>

<p>@PabloImpallari. Don&rsquo;t confuse us with answers or facts!</p>
<p>@Hrant. &ldquo;On a number of occasions Dick has stated that a correct ID is his primary motivation, and nothing should inhibit that&rdquo; True. I said that accurate identification was a primary driver, but secondary was finding a legitimate source and that without the latter the former doesn&rsquo;t get posted.</p>
<p>Some people leave Typophile when their interests mature!</p>
<p>There has not been a discussion of what criteria prove a plagiarism. Over the recent weeks there has been discussions of Dafont, Autumn Leaves, Dave Rakowski, Nick Curtis, and now this Plantin look-alike that I can remember. From what I&rsquo;ve seen these have been all smoke and no fire. Once a thread is stopped the problem goes away for another day.</p>
<p>Along the way however, we have insinuated crimes without attempting  to get proof, or even being interested in getting proof.</p>

<p>Thank you for confirming.</p>
<blockquote>without the latter the former doesn't get posted.</blockquote>
<p>That contradicts your confirmation above that &ldquo;nothing should inhibit [a font ID]&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Can you point out examples where you either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Didn&rsquo;t post an answer because you thought the font was plagiarized?</li>
<li>Retracted a font suggestion when people pointed out it was tainted?</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember ever seeing something like that happen. And when people have suggested factoring in ethics, you&rsquo;ve balked.</p>
<blockquote>There has not been a discussion of what criteria prove a plagiarism.</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s not necessary for this discussion. This is about what [not] to do based on one&rsquo;s own beliefs. If you believe reusing outlines is not unethical, just say so.</p>
<p>Are you really interested whether a font is legitimate? I&rsquo;m not talking about outright pirated fonts, I&rsquo;m talking about things like -what some people call- outline theft.</p>
<p>Would believing that a font is probably plagiarized stop you from IDing it, or cause you to retract an ID?</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Why condone the naming of an illegitimate font when linking to it isn&rsquo;t OK?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t afford to spend the time explaining official policy, how will you manage to make the time to investigate cases of plagiarism? I don&rsquo;t mean to pester, I&rsquo;m just concerned about private reporting of plagiarism going ignored because you&rsquo;re -understandably- busy. Why not simply allow somebody to voice an opinion that they think the font might be plagiarized? People can then use that opinion in any way they please.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It seems there are more restrictions on people who want a place for ethics on Typophile versus people who think IDing is the only purpose of Typophile.</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>Dick, two questions only:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s ethical to re-use commercial outlines without permission from the original designer?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will you avoid recommending fonts you believe are probably unethical and/or will you retract a recommendation if you become suspicious that&rsquo;s the case?</p>

<p>&ndash;</p>
<blockquote>these "opinions" or accusations should also be accompanied by some sort of proof</blockquote>
<p>I agree. But why go it alone? It shouldn&rsquo;t be me against you against this guy or that guy. I&rsquo;ve said this before: in a community different people are good at different things, and <em>together</em> can accomplish much more than individually. For example let&rsquo;s say I can often tell when a font is probably &ldquo;too good to be true&rdquo; (due to actually having been making fonts for about 30 years) but let&rsquo;s say Ryuk is much better at naming a dozen specific fonts that sort of look like that font, and bingo, we uncover the truth*. If I can&rsquo;t do what Ryuk does, should I just keep quiet? I&rsquo;d rather communicate what I can contribute, and see what others can do with that. Without my contribution more stuff will slip through the cracks, and just because nobody is complaining doesn&rsquo;t mean nobody is offended. Sure sometimes things get uncomfortable, but hey, getting in bed with plagiarism is no alternative.</p>
<ul>
<li>Like look what happened here:
<a href="http://typophile.com/node/99822">http://typophile.com/node/99822</a>
I smelled a rat, then &ldquo;R.&rdquo; named Modena, then I made an incriminating graphic.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>1. Have you stopped beating your wife yet?</blockquote>
<p>That would be funny if this were a frivolous conversation.</p>
<blockquote>2. Why are your posting counts not shown on this forum?</blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. I can take guesses, but I really don&rsquo;t see the relevance to this discussion.</p>
<blockquote>Finally, Two answers out of Three:</blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand what that means. And considering your third answer, it seems to me you&rsquo;re being frivolous, perhaps to avoid being pinned down to an answer. Maybe you wrote that to pick and choose what you &ldquo;really meant&rdquo; in the future? If so, how long would you play such a tiring, defeatist game?</p>
<blockquote>1. It is not ethical to re-use commercial outlines without permission.</blockquote>
<p>We agree.</p>
<blockquote>2. I don't/won't recommend fonts that I feel are probably unethical.</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s great to hear, but I have to say I&rsquo;ve seen you behave contrary to this. I&rsquo;ve never seen you be tentative or change your mind. Like in the Cuprum thread I mention above, you said &ldquo;Very little needs addressing&hellip;&rdquo; You seem to be totally OK with something that virtually any bona fide type designer would think is unethical.</p>
<blockquote>3. I will consider a font unethical if Hrant suspects it to be unethical because similarity of design is prima facie suspicious.</blockquote>
<p>That makes no sense. I can&rsquo;t see how you could mean it.</p>
<blockquote>I will excuse people from developing a negative perception of me.</blockquote>
<p>What if this perception naturally migrates to the whole of Typophile, and thereby to other members? Because that&rsquo;s how perception works - it&rsquo;s contagious. Is that fair?</p>

<p><strong>Chris:</strong> For as smart as you pretend to be and as pompous as you are (does that come with being a moderator?) your saying &ldquo;Watch the language&rdquo; in response 
to &ldquo;Have you stopped beating your wife yet?&rdquo; reeks of rank ignorance. How could you not know it was a &ldquo;a rhetorical riposte&rdquo;? But your feigning ignorance on what &ldquo;OP&rdquo; meant, and then &ldquo;guessing correctly&rdquo; is in the same vein. You pulled that same mock ignorance on me in another thread. If you&rsquo;re really not that ignorant, stop pretending to be. If you are that ignorant, you need to read more and get out of the house more often. Or maybe even out of the Yukon Territory.</p>
<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Please go back you your old avatar. Don&rsquo;t roll over and play dead.</p>
<p><strong>Akira:</strong> <em>But I don’t think it might be good for us to tell you what it is, because it might be a knockoff.</em></p>
<p>Well, Duh! He already has the font. If the source is not identified, and he doesn&rsquo;t know the name of the font, what&rsquo;s the point of not telling him/us what it is?</p>

In case you own a professional font design program, such as FontLab Studio, you could look into the meta-data of the font. My guess is that in the process of renaming the font some of the original data there may have remained. That could give you the information you need.
It is even possible that (in case you are on a Mac) the standard Info-panel may contain important information under Copyright. (Command-I).</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><em>Do you believe type designers have IP rights?</em></p>
<p>Generally, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Not so sure in the case of abandonware.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m with Dick on this one: <em>There has not been a discussion of what criteria prove a plagiarism. Over the recent weeks there has been discussions of Dafont, Autumn Leaves, Dave Rakowski, Nick Curtis, and now this Plantin look-alike that I can remember. From what I&rsquo;ve seen these have been all smoke and no fire. Once a thread is stopped the problem goes away for another day.</p>
<p><em>Along the way however, we have insinuated crimes without attempting to get proof, or even being interested in getting proof.</em></p>
<p><Strong><em>All you ever did on Typophile was attack Typophile.</em></p>
<p><strong> As you see it. I detested all the Typophile &ldquo;improvements&rdquo; that broke a functioning Typophile, and I lambasted the hypocrisy wherein &ldquo;professionals&rdquo; were forgiven major lapses in type design, naming conventions, non-functioning out-of-the-box fonts, screwed up downloads, yada, yada, yada, while at the same time designers of low-cost or free fonts were held to a higher standard. I&rsquo;m tired of forgiving professionals, denigrating those who sell their fonts at low- or no-cost, and excoriating posters (based on &ldquo;suspicion&rdquo;) who are merely looking for an ID. Obviously you want to protect the &ldquo;professionals&rdquo; from your perch while taking pot shots at those you consider less than &ldquo;professional.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Have at it. And whatever response you—or I—get, we deserve (although I don&rsquo;t like the odds of &ldquo;professionals&rdquo; against the rest of us).</p>
<p><strong>Get off your high horse.</strong></p>

People who are not designers don&rsquo;t [have to] care, but they&rsquo;ve become a huge presence here and that ruins the character of this place. Typophile&rsquo;s best purpose is to promote type design, and IDing unethical fonts harms that.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t pretend the ID section is not part of Typophile. Disrespecting type design -for example by exhibiting rock-bottom standards of what constitutes unethical behavior- makes the whole of Typophile less welcoming of people who make fonts, especially the high-quality stuff. They don&rsquo;t want to spend their days watching unethical behavior or arguing with people who don&rsquo;t know the first thing about type.</p>
<p>You might not mind if Typophile was <em>only</em> for IDing. But some people will try to prevent that from happening&hellip; assuming it&rsquo;s not already too late.</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>Anybody starting a new type forum, heed the warning I gave many years ago: IDing fonts isn&rsquo;t useless, but it should not be allowed to take over.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t compare yourself to Ryuk, Jodie, Herb and Fivos, who are all adequately careful not to promote plagiarism, and have taken corrective action as needed. Certainly don&rsquo;t compare yourself to Akira, who -like me- has exposed and even confronted unethical behavior. And also not to Nick, who actually makes useful things. Jan&rsquo;s stance on font IP (my plagiarism is his &ldquo;artistic inspiration&rdquo;) and his withdrawal from difficult questions I personally find problematic, but since he doesn&rsquo;t do a lot of IDing it&rsquo;s largely moot. I wonder why you didn&rsquo;t mention Steve, who has contributed much more than you&hellip; but he doesn&rsquo;t ID fonts much, so I guess he doesn&rsquo;t exist for you.</p>
<p>You have many role models here. A mirror is never one.</p>
<blockquote>There is more exposure to good font practices than in all the other forums on Typophile combined I would wager.</blockquote>
<p>You have no idea what you&rsquo;re talking about. For one thing, you&rsquo;ve probably spent a total of about 5 minutes outside the ID section in the past 9 years. The only recent talk of &ldquo;good font practices&rdquo; in the ID section is when there&rsquo;s a confrontation about plagiarism! You&rsquo;re welcome.</p>
