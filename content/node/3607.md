  body: That&#39;s funny. I was just playing around with Chianti GX this weekend.
    I never installed QuickDrawGX way back, but I remembered that MacOS X supports
    GX fonts. I dug up my old Bitstream Type Shop Pro CD-ROM which has a bunch of
    GX fonts to see how well they worked and whether you can access the extra glyphs
    in Illustrator CS. You can, but only through the Glyph Palette, and some of glyphs
    are a bit garbled. TextEdit and other Cocoa applications support them completely,
    though. <BR> <BR>Anyway, I don&#39;t think the font in question is Chianti, but,
    you&#39;re right, it&#39;s very close.
