    of some accidents on the streets trying to figure out the words. LOL! If I'm going
    for a <a rel="dofollow" href="http://instantsigns.onsugar.com/Installing-Caring-your-Car-Wrap-25631663"
    title="car wrap" style="text-decoration:none; color:#000000;">car wrap</a>, I
    would contact experts regarding that matter and ask from them the best wrap for
    my car.

    and anticipate it may not appear, we are still able to recognize a partial shape
    for what it is or would be in entirety. There may be a more specific gestalt term
    that someone has created for closure specific to letters, but the principle remains
    the same."

    in school) see if you can get a copy of Richard Zakia's book about Gestalt theory
    and visual perception. It's been many years (uh . . . like maybe twenty!) since
    I read it but I LOVED it at the time! A couple of years later I even sent Prof.
    Zakia a photo that I'd found, which I thought perfectly illustrated one of his
    points. Although much of what he discusses has to do with photography, the book's
    scope is wider than that. Just a suggestion. (As if you didn't have enough to
    read already!)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Perception-Imaging-Second-Richard-Zakia/dp/024080466X\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The image in the initial post reminds me of when I was a kid. I was playing
    at a friend's house, and at some point I noticed his mother had a small wood block
    placed on her TV as a decoration of some sort. The block had flat geometric sections
    removed from it- just like in that same image above, but with a low profile wooden
    base that kept the remaining pieces connected together, if I recall correctly.
    \r\n\r\nI stood there silent for quite a while, just gazing away at this curiosity-
    it was so abstract compared to the other decorations in the house. I was pretty
    fascinated with it, it reminded me of something out of an Escher book.\r\n\r\nMy
    friend, who is wondering why I'm just standing there staring at a wood block,
    realizes I don't see it for what it really is, and fills me in: the negative space
    of the block spelled out \"J-E-S-U-S\". It suddenly became clear as day, and I
    was so mad at myself for not being able to see that :P"

    body: "<cite>Do you think it would be a good idea to create a logo this way? Or

      audience is, what the logo's for, and how it will be seen. \r\n\r\nIf I was
      designing for a billboard, creating a sign for a building, or making vehicle
      graphics, I would never do something like this. When short viewing time/motion
      is involved you have to make sure it can be read.\r\n\r\nFor printed/web media:
      maybe use it as an attention getter for a header/intro to a layout of text,
      but I still wouldn't use it for a logo, not to that extreme at least. It gives
      an optical illusion/psychedelic vibe that I don't think many companies would
      want in their logo- which is their identity.\r\n\r\nThere might be better examples
      of the theory than this one."
