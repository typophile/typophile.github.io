body: "Hello everyone. I am a novice in type design aiming on making a serif (and
  if possible, a sans-serif companion) type system aimed at newspaper use.  I am still
  in development, and I am looking at some other fonts that look great on print.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nActa

  alt=\"Proforma\" width=600/>\r\n\r\nBut I am confused on how to do it because there
  are some issues on character sets, color, legibility (His Excellency Fred Smeijers
  said one can do wedgies on the serifs), and even chemistry [H&FJ brings up the topic
  on font grades, to cope with how ink reacts with paper (I know lazyheads, you are
  all crying right now :'{ )].\r\n\r\nSo the question remains: what do newspapers
  really need in the design of its typefaces?"

  body: "Typefaces and fonts are frequently confused. A typeface is a design family
    of items which are interrelated: Garamond, for example, is a typeface. A font
    is a particular iteration of a typeface: 12 point Garamond italic is a font within
    the Garamond family. Historically, a typeface designer would create the desired
    look and feel, and then specific fonts needed to be cast in type.\r\n\r\n\r\n<a

  body: "This is a big challenge. For one thing although the technical stuff is huge,
    \"mood\" still plays a role, and you have to end up with a design that reflects
    the character of the newspaper.\r\n\r\nThe one recent effort that I think has
    revealed deep insight into news face requirements is Christian Schwartz's Houston
    Chronicle typeface*. It aptly demonstrated how features that look ridiculous when
    large turn into gold when small. In fact, as I've opined before a text face in
    general can't be optimal if it looks too nice when used for display (although
    many designers dispute this).\r\n\r\n* http://www.christianschwartz.com/houston.shtml\r\n\r\nBTW
    there's a huge reference you've missed: David Berlow. Hopefully he'll chime in.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "They need types that will work well on the presses on which their publication
    is printed; paper stock and ink gain are key issues, especially for body type.\r\n\r\nThey
    need types that will not waste space, which is at a premium in a medium which
    is quite literally downsizing.\r\n\r\nThey need display types which are tightly
    \uFB01tted.\r\nFor serifed headline fonts, very \uFB01ne details for use huge.\r\n\r\nThey
    need types with unique personality, to stand out in the SND awards every year.
    \r\n\r\nThey need types with contemporary style, because newspapers are more like
    magazines now that news is delivered fast by TV, Internet and tweet."
