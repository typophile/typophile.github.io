  body: "I'm really happy with this. I drew it all without looking at any references.
    I know there are similarities to other fonts out there that we have seen. But
    this is what came out of my mind last night.\r\n\r\nI still need to make numbers
    and special characters and other glyphs.\r\n<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://typophile.com/files/image_135.jpg\"><img

  body: "For the \"s\", make it wider. For the \"x\", stagger the arms.\r\n\r\nThe
    first thing I would do though is figure out which direction(s) those shear should
    go and and why.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "To my point of view the angle at the bottom of the | j | is on the wrong
    side. It should be on the same angle as the | p |. Also, the ascender and descender
    seems too long (see your | g and y |. Try something nearest of the | y |. Keep
    going.\r\n"
