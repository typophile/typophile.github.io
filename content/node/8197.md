body: I&#39;m interested in font trends among major newspapers, but I&#39;m terrible
  at identifying fonts. <BR> <BR>Now that most newspapers have been redesigned to
  accommodate the narrower paper that they are printed on, what are the most common
  fonts used for regular headlines as well as regular article text? Are most using
  a condensed typeface now for regular article text so they can print more on narrower
  paper?  <BR> <BR>I saw Ascender Corp recently released a study about this, but the
  study does not break them down as to which typfaces are most popular for headlines
  and which ones are most popular for regular article text. <BR> <BR>USA Today uses
  Gulliver for both headlines and article text, right? What about the LA Times? What
  does the Washington Post use?  <BR> <BR>If you have any insight as to what the most
  popular typefaces are now for major newspapers, particularly headlines and article
  text, please share.

  body: The Ascender thing is the only recent formal study I&#39;ve noted. There was
    one by Poynter a few years ago but I suspect that&#39;s already become outdated.
    <BR> <BR>Something else you could try is reading up on books and articles about
    the topic &#40;like Berry&#39;s recent &#34;Contemporary Newspaper Design&#34;&#41;
    and form your own ideas &#40;if not tabulate numbers&#41;. And then tell us what
    they are.  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: 'I&#39;ve often been asked as a prop designer to recreate actual newspaper
    pages with fictional stories added, so I&#39;ve had to study newspaper typography
    quite a bit. Most of the major newspapers I&#39;ve had to work with have their
    own customized set of fonts which are made exclusively for in-house use. Typesetters
    at the Washington Post were very kind to give me access to a set of their in-house
    fonts for one prop job. They have their own version of Bodoni which they call
    Postoni. They have Postroman, which looks very like a Cheltenham. They also use
    Franklin Gothic, Poynter Gothic, Filosofia, Weidemann, Giza, and Didot, plus Helvetica
    and their own logo font. <BR><!--attachment: Picture_1-56963.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*9.6*Washington+Post+logo+font*Picture+1%2epdf

    by Newspapers. This is an older article but you can <a href="http://www.poynter.org/content/content_view.asp?id=4055">
    Try it</a> for starters.

    long ago. <a href="http://ronreason.com/" target="_blank">His site</a> is a great
    resource and I&#39;m sure he woul be to if you get a hold of him as he as been
    instrumental in a number of newspaper redesigns including The Wall Street Journal.
    It might be worth your time trying to contact him.

    Utopia.\r\nExpressway Condensed Bold for headings. Bold for captions. Medium or
    Light for some body text.\r\nMinion for other headings, sub-headings, and bylines.\r\nAnd
    Utopia for almost all other body text.\r\n\r\nIf I recall, I've seen other papers

  body: "A really well-designed paper I worked for used Madison for years and it's
    a gorgeous headline font for display at 100% and it was used for straight headlines
    at 73% width. I couldn't tell it wasn't a condensed face.\r\n\r\nIt's a completely
    different look, but I designed a Spanish-language newspaper with Stymie and it
    worked great. Latin American newspapers are very bold and punchy and readers responded
    very positively to a strong, bold slab serif font."
