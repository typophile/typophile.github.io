body: "I have created 131 Illustrator pattern brushes to create period borders, following
  advice given\u2014and much appreciated\u2014about maintaining proper placement when
  one or more elements do not fill the em square\u2014which was, to use zero width
  line segments as spacers.\r\n\r\nAI affords the opportunity of customizing the borders\u2014scaling,
  color, and stroke\u2014but, if the end-user does add strokes, then the elegant spacing
  solution becomes a problem.  As far as I can tell, Artlandia Live Presets would
  allow me to edit the swatches used to create the borders, but I am not sure that
  the program won't rewrite the Postscript and relocated the 0,0 origin point.\r\n\r\nAny
  clues?\r\n\r\nAlso, anyone PC or Mac users (both needed) interested in pre-release
  testing the complete set?"

  body: "Neil,\r\n\r\nYes, yes, yes! That was VERY helpful. \"Illustrator brushes\"
    was getting me nowhere but annoyed, but \"vector packs\" gave me a <em>very</em>
    good idea of what semi-comparable products are available, and how much they cost.\r\n\r\nFor
    instance, if a pack of 11 brush patterns is selling for $8.50, a set of 132 instant
    borders <em>ought to go</em> for $102.00, if there is no quantity discount\u2014which
    is <em><strong>way more</strong></em> than I was ever considering charging.\r\n\r\nNow,
    all I need to figure is where is the precise Vito Corleone point that makes the
    offer so tempting that few reasonable people would refuse it? $39.95, maybe? Too
    much? Could ask more?\r\n\r\nAny votes? Anyone interested in taking the set out
    for a spin?\r\n\r\n"

    for a spin \u2026\r\n\r\nOh, also, I think $50 to $80 wouldn't be unreasonable
    for this."

    a note to me at kipnick (at) msn (dot) com, and I will send you a complete set
    as soon as I have finished tweaking stuff to my satisfaction\u2014which will probably
    be in a week or so, because I have an out-of-town wedding to attend on Wednesday,
    with travel time and details to be taken care of before and after.\r\n\r\nP.S.
    I set the brushes up in Illustrator CS3 on a PC, which should make them cross-platform
    and forward-compatible. One thing I want to do is to fiddle around with how far
    backwards-compatible I can make them while still maintaining their functionality."

    entrance comment of some sort.\r\n\r\nAre the borders classified per era/design
    style?\r\n\r\nn."

  body: "Neil,\r\n\r\nExcellent suggestions. As it happens, I have built a pretty
    good relationship with a European publishing group by providing them with free
    stuff, which helps us both out. As luck would have it\u2014or whoever is in charge
    of serendipity-doo\u2014they are launching a NEW magazine which JUST SO HAPPENS
    to be directed at my target audience.\r\n\r\nYou see where this is going? Win-win-win:
    the magazine has a BRAND NEW product; I provide a free sample of my stuff; the
    magazine provides the info to the new subscribers on where to get more, and the
    incentive to buy is FREE; and, maybe, I offer a special discount code to REALLY
    sweeten the deal.\r\n\r\nWhat else could go right? So far, everything. Or, at
    least, everything I am aware of. But, what the hey\u2014if you're going to be
    surprised, the good surprises are the ones you want coming your way.\r\n\r\nSerendipity-doo\u2026\r\n\r\nOn
    another note: ANYONE have any experience with the subject of the post? I have
    a demo of the program, but it won't let me save the results; and, if I don't know
    if the changes will actually stick, all I MAY be accomplishing is screwing something
    up."
