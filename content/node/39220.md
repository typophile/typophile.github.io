  precedes and follows!\r\n\r\nThank you all for the attention! \r\nBye :)"

    I keep forgetting it. And I don't like it when the rules change here. 1 year ago
    the killerrule was: First the name, then add the link in the SAME post. Now the
    rule is: First the name, then add the link in a NEW post even if there are zagillions
    other posts in between. Isn't very legible, eh? Quite irritating for a website
    dedicated to typophiles. "
