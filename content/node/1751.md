  body: Hi Wanda. <BR> <BR>Your background and text are fighting each other to be
    the most important thing on the card. There so close their about to come to blows
    over it!  <BR> <BR>You can minimize the type by making it smaller and choosing
    one weight and color. Or, minimize the graphic by tinting it, or making it 85%
    on a blue background, knockout type. Also, consider cropping your graphic differently,
    try rotating it, try an asymetrical layout. BTW, any reason why the ball terminals
    are two different sizes? <BR> <BR>Have fun with your layout! <BR> <BR>Cheers,
    <BR>Randy
