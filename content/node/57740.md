  console font for linux, and I am working on making a versal esszet. However, my
  design skills are very lacking, and I was hoping you could give me some pointers
  to my first try. What I've got so far is: \r\n\r\n.........\r\n.........\r\n.........\r\n.000000..\r\n00...00..\r\n00..00...\r\n00.00....\r\n00.00....\r\n00..00...\r\n00...00..\r\n00...00..\r\n00...00..\r\n00.000...\r\n.........\r\n.........\r\n.........\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm
  not quite sure how to get a good image of it in use. I have the .psf.gz files if
  anybody wants to take a look. \r\nThanks!\r\nGlen W."
