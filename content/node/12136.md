  typographical advisor to the [[Monotype corporation]] and opinionated type historian
  and theoretician. Designer of [[Times New Roman]] which, along with [[Helvetica]]
  and [[Univers]], probably holds the honor of being the most well-known typeface
  of the [[20th century]]. [[Times New Roman]] was his only type design, and the story
  of its development is told in [[Walter Tracy]]'s <cite>[[Letters of Credit]]</cite>.
  His most well-known book is <cite>[[A Tally of Types]]</cite>, which is no longer
  an indispensable reference, but is still one of the most entertaining reads out
  there to the typographically inclined.\r\n\r\nBibliography:\r\n\r\n\u2018Towards
