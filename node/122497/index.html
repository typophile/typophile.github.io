  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking for a typeface suitable for printing on a professional and high-quality offset printer at 1 - 2 pts. The printed text should look good when looked at under a magnifying glass, and should be legible without as well.</p>
<p>After doing some research, I came across an earlier, similar post: <a href="http://typophile.com/node/36897">http://typophile.com/node/36897</a></p>
<p>Which lists these several typefaces that work for small text:</p>
<ul>
<li>Freight Micro</li>
<li>Franklin Gothic</li>
<li>Bell Centennial</li>
<li>La formica</li>
<li>Miniscule</li>
</ul>
<p>There is also the small text list here: <a href="https://www.fontshop.com/people/cole-marshall/fontlists/small-text">https://www.fontshop.com/people/cole-marshall/fontlists/small-text</a></p>
<p>However, I would love to hear the community&rsquo;s recommendations and experiences working with small typefaces at 1 - 2 pts so I can better select a typeface for my project.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I doubt if many folks could read type that small without magnification; especially folks over 30 as eyesight gets worse as we age.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>At that size with offset printing, a lot depends on the paper. Ink soaks into the paper and spreads a bit (dot gain). With coated paper it spreads less. With absorbent paper it spreads more.</p>
<p>In other words, on more absorbent paper, you might be wise to use a typeface with thinner strokes since you can anticipate them beefing up some. On the other hand, depending on the layout application you&rsquo;re using (InDesign, for example) and the profile settings you&rsquo;ve plugged into it, dot gain on tiny objects, like halftone dots, might already be taken into consideration.</p>
<p>You also need to consider the output resolution of the printer&rsquo;s image or platesetter, which is typically somewhere between 1200 and 4800 dpi. If you want sharp letters and intact serifs, you&rsquo;ll want the highest output resolution possible.</p>
<p>Best bet: find a good offset printing company and ask the prepress people.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for all the suggestions so far.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m creating my file in Illustrator and will be handing off the print file as a PDF, which means the text will all be vector. There are no raster images in my print file so, and correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong here, the DPI of my file doesn&rsquo;t actually matter.</p>
<p>The paper stock will be taken care of by the professional printer. I trust in them to pick a paper stock that&rsquo;ll be best suitable for my application.</p>
<p>As for choosing a typeface, can you recommend me any specific typefaces to use? Also, what should I be looking for when it comes to the typeface? I see that some typefaces that are designed for small text, such as the Minuscule Typeface, have little notches instead of sharp 90 degree edges. I&rsquo;m guessing that&rsquo;s to prevent any ink from pooling in the area since that&rsquo;s a real concern at very small sizes.</p>
<p>So, a couple more questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What are some specific typefaces you recommend for printed text in 1 - 2 pts?</li>
<li>What kind of traits should I be looking for in a typeface for printing text in 1 - 2 pts?</li>
<li>My print file contains purely text, and so purely vector. Do I still have to worry about the output DPI?</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;ll decline recommending specific typefaces since there are many that would work. As I said, much also depends on the paper, the resolution of the output, the inks that are used and the quality of the printing.</p>
<p>If it were me and playing it safe, I&rsquo;d select a typeface without lots of detail. A nice, clean, even, generic sans-serif face without much difference between thicks and thins ought to work just fine. Large counters would help too. If you can find one with built-in ink traps (the little notches), that&rsquo;s a plus. As you mentioned, those notches help prevent the ink from bleeding to where it&rsquo;s not supposed to be (the dot gain that I mentioned) and, subsequently, rounding off the acute angles and filling in the counters of the glyphs.</p>
<p>As for DPI not mattering with vector files, well, it&rsquo;s true that vector files are resolution independent, but not in the way you&rsquo;re thinking. Yes, they can be scaled up or down with no loss of quality.</p>
<p>The part you&rsquo;re missing is that vector files still must be rasterized at output. Whether a simple desktop laser printer or a high-end platesetter, the Raster Image Processer (RIP) in the output device converts the file to a raster equivalent at whatever resolution it&rsquo;s capable of producing. An inexpensive laser printer might RIP the vector file at 600 dpi. An expensive platesetter might RIP that same vector file at 4800 dpi. There are micro-printing techniques with even higher resolutions, but it&rsquo;s very much a specialty thing.</p>
<p>Obviously, when you&rsquo;re printing type that small, you want the vector files ripped at the highest-possible resolution that the output device can handle and that the plates and the press are capable of printing.</p>
<p>Another thing that might seem obvious — but I&rsquo;ll mention it anyway — is that you&rsquo;ll need to print this in a solid color. The type will be too small to handle halftone dots or ink registration issues.</p>

<p>Yes, you want a printer who has very good equipment and is used to challenging projects.</p>
<p>Ask to see printed samples of tiny type they&rsquo;ve printed. Your best bet might be a large, expensive print shop that can show you work they&rsquo;ve done for picky corporate clients. Some small shops do good work too, but again ask to see printed samples.</p>
<p>My guess is that most shops won&rsquo;t guarantee that type that small will be readable with the naked eye.</p>

<p>As for the output file, since my content is 100% vector-based am I fine to simply choose a low DPI setting for &lsquo;Raster Effects&rsquo; in my Adobe program? I understand the final output file that goes into the printer will have to be rasterized, but I plan on handing over the print file to the printer as a PDF (and they can RIP it themselves).</p>
<p>Thanks for describing important attributes for fine-size printing. I think I have a couple good candidates based on your description.</p>

<p>Regarding the RIP, I&rsquo;d ask the printer if they&rsquo;d prefer a PDF or the native Adobe file. I tend to be wary of printers who want PDFs because it suggests to me that they don&rsquo;t have skilled staff in the pre-press department. Original files give them more flexibility when doing the pre-press work.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Typonaut, you shouldn&rsquo;t be using any raster effects on your 2-point type, but if your question is broader than that&hellip;</p>
<p>Even though Illustrator is a vector-based drawing application, it still includes some effects that are resolution-dependent and which will rasterize at the resolution specified in the Document Raster Effects Settings.</p>
<p>Effects like transparent drop shadows, glowing edges, blurs, feathers, certain 3D effects, etc., will rasterize at the resolution you&rsquo;ve specified rather than at the maximum resolution of the output device.</p>
<p>For example, you&rsquo;d want the edges of solid objects output at the highest possible resolution to avoid visible jagged edges along curved or diagonal edges. Black text is a perfect example of where this is important.</p>
<p>Other effects, like those I mentioned, don&rsquo;t need that kind of high-resolution treatment. In offset printing, for example, those effects would be printed using halftone dots where the screen frequency is unlikely to exceed 150lpi. That being the case, those effects would only need to be rasterized at about twice the screen frequency, or 300ppi.</p>
<p>In other words, for most print output purposes, you&rsquo;ll probably want the Document Raster Effects Setting set to 300ppi if you&rsquo;re using any Illustrator effects. For that matter, if you&rsquo;re building an Illustrator file for print, it&rsquo;s always a good idea to make sure that you&rsquo;ve checked this setting, just in case it&rsquo;s needed by some effect in the document that you&rsquo;ve overlooked or not realized needed it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m unsure why Adobe hasn&rsquo;t programmed Illustrator to calculate these things automatically based on the RIP, but I imagine there&rsquo;s a good (and very technical) reason for it.</p>
<p>As for your question about laser printers, no there&rsquo;s not really the equivalent of dot gain since toner doesn&rsquo;t soak into the paper. Even so, with your 2-point text, ink well/traps might help offset some of the inherent fuzziness that occurs along the edges and that can round out the inside corners slightly, but my guess is that the benefits would be marginal. If you&rsquo;re planning on printing whatever you&rsquo;re working on with a laser printer, keep in mind that even high-resolution laser printers barely match the output resolution of the lower resolution RIPs used for offset work.</p>
