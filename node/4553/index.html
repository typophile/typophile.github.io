  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Thomas, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Kerning on a Monotype Keyboard is a &quot;unit subtraction function&quot;  which tells the mould to open up less when casting type. This causes the type to be under cut, or rather, under cast. Kerning metrics are completely an &quot;operator&quot; decision, nothing &quot;factory predetermined&quot;, nothing included in &quot;font information&quot;. I am not speaking of the italic lowercase y, j, or f etc. which &quot;is&quot; part of font metrics. In fact, genuine keyboard kerning procedure were a discovery, not an intended engineering feature. Although later included in the manuals. It is a myth that Monotype had specific hot metal kerning font metrics. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I might add, there was a secondary method of kerning which required manual insertion. That method is the same but takes less skill and more labour. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;SPACING&quot; was &quot;variable&quot; unlike hand set types which has fixed units. For instance hand set type used quads, en quads, three to the em, four to the em five to the em, six then on to hair spaces, 1pt, 1/2 point, some shops such as ours cut papers for 1/4 point spacing. Monotypes were far finer. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Spacing goes between the words to justify lines of type independent of specific font metrics although part of operator considerations. If you are seeing, as you say certain &quot;advance widths popping up&quot; they are a digital error. If in hot metal, they are an operator error, no fault of the system. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now I do not wish to give you a headache but there is a thing called &quot;fixed&quot; and &quot;variable&quot; spacing. Sometimes you would use one, sometime you would use the other and at others, good operators may choose to use both. This system should be included in modern day page layout procedures. If you call me I will give you an understanding of its advantages. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lanston never had a photocomp system. Monotype England did. The keyboards were the same, the output device had negatives replacing the brass matrices. The system otherwise was based on the hot metal system. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If you are seeing something as you say you do it may be the following. As I remember Monotype England sold digital laser printers and systems to the newspaper industry. What you may be seeing is the evils of &quot;early digital technology&quot;. And John and others are blaming it on &quot;hot metal technology&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I wish to avoid falsehoods getting foisted upon the unknowingly by pretenders. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Furthermore I am not stupid, or &quot;commercially evil&quot; as one member has indicated. I know you and Adobe often suffer from similar abuse. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But before I go I must thank you for the opportunity to clarify matters about the Monotype System. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->But letterspacing &quot;requires individual attention&quot;. Sorry that is just a fact. To presume the professional is incapable of fine tuning his or her display matter is rather more than a little arrogant.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->never<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &ndash; not even once &ndash; suggested that professionals were incapable of or should be prevented from fine tuning spacing. I value the precision of manual kerning options in professional page layout software very highly, and if I were handsetting metal type I'd probably be one of the guys getting in there with the file and the hair spacing. But the majority of text that is going to be set today is not being handled by professional typographers. As a maker of fonts, I see it as my contribution to ensure that as much of that text as possible looks decent and is readable. Since I can't rely on the average 'typesetter' to kern it well, I have to make sure that the factory kerning is as good as it can be.</div>

The edge of envelope closest to the horizontal extremes of the O would be the same distance as a typical straight sidebearing on the same letter, so why should the envelope space two Os any further apart than sidebearings? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The illustration below shows the relationship of outline and spacing envelope, and also the relationship of the latter to typical rectangle sidebearings for the same letter. There would be no difference between spacing two Os with sidebearings or with the envelope; the difference would be when you put O next to K,V,W,X,Y. Such combinations would need kerning in the sidebearing model, but not in the envelope model because it would conform to their shape and allow them to nestle closer to the O. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->[The terminology is awkward, because we're falsely distinguishing the sidebearing approach from the envelope approach; sidebearings define an envelope: a rectangular envelope. Laurence used the term 'spacing outline' for what I am calling the envelope; something like this might be better, because the envelope does not necessarily envelope the letter shape: if it produces good spacing, parts of the letter can extend beyond the envelope (the example I used above was the outer tips of the serifs on the v).]</div>

As much as I'd like to agree with the rationale of your argument I do believe that Gerald has a very strong point here.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is perverse. I'm the one talking about the need to make fonts with good quality basic spacing  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and<!-- raw HTML omitted --> with smallcaps, ligatures and other tools of textual articulation. Gerald G is the one saying that fonts for 'fine typography' don't need any kerning, because the fine typographer is obviously going to do all the spacing himself. Gerald G's definition of fine typography seems to be 'that which is made by fine typographers'. On this we basically agree, and my point is that fine typographers are going to do fine typography, one way or another, while everyone else is going to do the typography that you give them the tools to do, and most of the time the tools are going to remain on the 'factory settings'. Hence, if you care about anything other than what fine typographers get up to, those factory settings are important. Since I've only met a handful of fine typographers in my life, and many thousands of 'font users', I'm not inclined to trust that the majority of type is going to be finely set.</div>

This is precisely what I mean by fine typography looking after itself or, less abstractly, fine typographers looking after fine typography. Gerald didn't wait for someone else to start making digital fonts the way he wanted them: he started making them himself. There is a DIY culture in fine printing that is very admirable, whether it is rebuilding presses from spare parts, machining new parts to repare casters, or hacking digital font layouts to include ligatures.

		<div class="commentbody"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->That's in effect the Kindersley approach.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The idea of spacing envelopes that relate directly to the shape of the letter is not at all similar to Kindersley's approach. Kindersley's approach is based on identifying the optical centre of the letter and aligning to it the mathematical centre of what is still a rectangle. The sides esablished by Kindersley's method, as applied by him, are parallel, vertical sides. I'm not sure whether locating the optical centre is of practical use in defining a spacing envelope, but I suspect not. The purpose of a spacing envelope is to define the minimum distance between any given point on the outline and the nearest part of an adjacent glyph. This requires a different kind of analysis from that used by Kindersley to identify the optical centre and measure from it a fixed amount to a vertical sidebearing.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gerald, it strikes me that your main problem is that you're not separating fonts from their use, specifically by third-parties. Maybe because you are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->such a fine printer yourself<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and you can use your own fonts to great effect - but as a rule a font isn't used by its creator (at least not for like 4 centuries now). Without this separation you can't think about this properly.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thank you for the encore, however I must correct you. I designed two fonts, Bodoni 26 <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://lanstontype.com/Bodoni26.html">http://lanstontype.com/Bodoni26.html</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> and Water Garden Fleurons. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://lanstontype.com/WaterGardenMulti.html">http://lanstontype.com/WaterGardenMulti.html</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Both Bodoni 26 and Water Garden Fleurons are digital, not hot metal.

Big deal. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Anyway, that's totally moot. Eric Gill designed a number of nice fonts, without doing the spacing; he got the Monotype works boys to do that. But we know that there is no Black without White (there's some <!-- raw HTML omitted -->useful<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Zen for you), so was he really a type designers? I happen to think so, but only because of his immense <!-- raw HTML omitted -->potential<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The bottom line is that you don't really need to grasp the nature of type design to sell some. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; Design a beautiful book with only one type size. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Why would I do such a boring thing? Designing type is magnitudes more challenging. But most of all, it's a matter of personal abilities and preferences. I'm not a poet, but I don't mind because I prefer what I am. Here we are talking about type design, not type use. Are you qualified? You don't have to be an expert (I'm not), but you do need to tame your artsy-fartsy chimeras. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BTW, here's a simple challenge for you in turn: avoid spewing claptrap like &quot;If you don't like our Californian, you don't like Californian.&quot; Without something to make you stand apart (like optical scaling, hello?!), you're just another average designer in the wide sea. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As for Jim's quote, you're reading whatever you want into it (as you do with whatever anybody writes). Look at the &quot;f&quot;s in the crushing majority Linotype metal fonts (and I don't care about alternates and such, because virtually nobody uses them - it's a fact), and tell me why. Because they were all idiots? No, my explanation (which is that of most people) makes more sense, and is supported by evidence. There's a ton more examples like this. But you refuse to see it - because it violates your religion. Your holy land is limited to your head. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jim also said the pantograph could not cut corners deeper than 1/1000 of an inch, and anybody with decent eyesight can in fact see the difference.

The spacing that results is determined by the shape of the bubble, which in turn is determined by the designer, who may or may not focus on 'averaging out the contiguous white space'. What I like about the bubble idea is that the ability to control the shape of the bubble and, hence, the interaction of the bubbles of different letters allows one to directly address two of the crucial aspects of spacing that you identify: the closest distance between near-points of adjacent glyphs, and the amount of 'penetration' a glyph makes of its neighbor's territory. At the moment, these can only be addressed by kerning: effectively we have default spacing (rectangles) and exceptional spacing (overlapping or spaced-out rectangles). The bubble allows the designer to address what we now implement as kerning as an aspect of default spacing. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ross and I spent some time testing the bubble approach recently, and I'm very impressed by the results. The one area that is troublesome is when parallel diagonals are in proximity, e.g. VA, in which case there is a tendency for the spacing to be too tight unless the bubble includes non-intuitive spikes above the x-height. Such features are why I think this approach is only practical if a computer program handles the bubble definition algorithmincally while the designer simply spaces letters: actually designing optimal bubbles is difficult, although not impossible.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">John, your idea is very interesting, mathematically. I think of it as a contrained optimisation.

Then, plausible goals might be: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> 1. find an optimal (soft) bubble, given the contrains and inititials; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> 2. optimal bubble defines basic spacing in that two bubbles sit touching each other; do I under you idea correctly? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> 3. there are likely to be some conflicts, by nature, given constrained input, so a solution like kerning may still be needed; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> 4. in any case, the result shall be transferable to ractangular box+kern paradigm. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I was thinking of a soft bubble that can grow/shrink depending on size/tracking.

The trickiest thing I've come up with so far is trying to make bubbles that ideally space both uppercase-to-lowercase and uppercase-to-uppercase, but then most default spacing/kerning for uppercase-to-uppercase is already a tight compromise, and with appropiate postive tracking I don't think the bubble spacing for uppercase sequences such as AV would be disproportionately tight. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->4. in any case, the result shall be transferable to rectangular box+kern paradigm.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yes, this is a thought I had a few days ago when looking at Ross' latest tests. The bubble approach doesn't necessarily have to be implemented in layout applications in order to be useful: it could represent a device- and format-independent way to specify and store desired spacing, which could then be optimally converted to sidebearings and kerning pairs by font software, as appropriate to particular formats.</div>
