  Belgium and of course a passion for type (not a type designer just a user :-p)  and
  been reading the forums for quite some time and it helped me out allot in my first
  year at the academy of art.\r\n\r\nI kind of had a question and hope that someone
  could help me out a bit. I'm looking for a nice \"serif\" font to accompany H&FJ's
  Whitney Book (Sans Serif) The purpose is to use it in some poetry text.\r\n\r\nI
  was looking at Verdigris from MVB but don't know if that would be a good choice?...I
  know the H&FJ site recommends using a serif of their own but i'm looking for some
  more suggestions...\r\n\r\nAlso maybe another question, is it okay to use a Pantone
  color when its getting digitally printed...i printed out (at the print shop) some
  pages that have a blue background but i can't help but notice that it has this really
  soft subtle  red/pink tint to it...whats the best way to use color in a document
  for print (digitally)\r\n\r\nThanks everyone for helping"

    style of the era which it references.\r\n\r\nOr through harmonious formal characteristics.\r\nThe
    principal here is: very close or very far apart, but not \u201Csort of\u201D (a
    little bit similar).\r\n\r\nVerdigris is a sturdy face, and, like all single-master
    serifed faces, the size at which it is reproduced has a huge bearing on how well
    it works in a layout, or with another typeface. \r\n\r\nWith printed color, it\u2019s
    always best to look a sample appearing in the medium intended.\r\nPantone produces
    printed specimen swatches that are helpful."

  body: "I would say, if you want a serif, almost all humanist / old styles work,
    also some Scotches maybe or more contemporary designs. Depends a little if you
    want to emphasize the friendliness or counteract it. I like Proforma, Parabel,
    Tibere, Harriet, Whitman, Page Serif, Really, Elmhurst, Atma, Miller \u2026"

  body: 'I have used Whitney as a display face with Garamond Premier Pro as a text
    face, but this doesn''t sound like quite what you''re after. Both Whitney and
    Verdigris are favorite typefaces of mine, though I don''t think I''ve ever used
    the two together. Might work nicely, though. However, if you''re looking for contrast,
    you ought to have at least two kinds of contrast: not just structure (sans/serif)
    but also size, or weight, or position on the page, or some other extra way of
    distinguishing them.'
