  boards for a while now - the battles are particularly impressive.\r\n\r\nWell this
  came up over at flashkit a while ago and no one seems to know what it is - it's
  instantly recognisable and I've seen it a million times so hopefully one of you
  guys can nail it. The pairs look intersting and it would be nice to find out a little
  about this (or similar) font(s) and any popular/well known usage.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n<img

  body: I seen that same basic type treatment many times. Is there some teacher teaching
    it? Or is it just the uniqueness of that font makes everything done using it look
    the same?

    Whenever the alternates are used, everything looks like a logo and not just text.\r\n\r\n

    body: "Yeah, I've just been doing a little research on that... It probably is
      taught in the context of the original magazine and maybe the font was used regularly
      in that style. http://www.philsp.com/data/images/a/avant_garde_1969_n8.jpg\r\n\r\n*edit.
      ha ha, is that avant garde in your avatar lex?"
