  title=\"Machine tags for type\">announced</a> a syntax for machine tags you can
  add to your Flickr photos of fonts \u2013 things like <code>type:face=cocon</code>
  and <code>type:designer=porchez</code>.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of machine tags is
  regularity of syntax. Other applications can use the Flickr API to assemble e.g.
  collections of every photo of Cocon or every photo of a font by Porchez, and they
  can show those photos on their own sites, not just at Flickr. (There are numerous
  other machine tags in use; see documentation on the <a href=\"http://code.flickr.com/blog/tag/machine-tags/\"
  title=\"Tag search: machine-tags [recursive?]\">Flickr Code blog</a>.)\r\n\r\nI
  have about a thousand photos in my stream thus tagged. You can too."
