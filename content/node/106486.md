body: "Hi,\r\nThere is tables that explains which applications support different opentype
  features like this link:\r\nhttps://www.typotheque.com/fonts/opentype_feature_support\r\nIn
  this table we see that all of the mentioned apps support the \"standard ligatures\"
  opentype feature.\r\nbut how would I know if I implement an GSUB LookupType 5 or
  6 (Contextual substitution) in a standard ligatures it will be executed in those
  apps. I need a GSUB LookupType 5 or 6 to be executed by default in any application,
  so I think it's safe to put it in this feature and it will be executed in all of
  those apps, right?\r\nThanks"

  body: Contextual GSUB lookups are now very widely supported, so I think it is unlikely
    that you will encounter problems with support. Of slightly more concern will be
    software that makes assumptions about what kind of lookups are associated with
    what kinds of features (despite the OT spec warning against making such assumptions),
    but this too is a diminishing problem.
