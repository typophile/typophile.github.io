body: "Hi everybody: first font, first problem, first post.\r\nI've worked my way
  designing the glyphs in illustrator and assembling everything in fontlab, compiling
  metrics and kerning. I'm now in the testing phase (I'm on a mac) and I noticed a
  software specific bug, which seems to come up only in some apps, namely apple pages
  and linotype fontexplorer x. Here's the problem:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/justified_6504.gif]\r\n\r\nas
  you can see, everything's fine in the first unjustified paragraph, but when I test
  a justified paragraph - the one below - the software screws the tracking (mainly
  the one of the 'i') to evenly space the rows. In a former version of the font the
  same problem affected the letter 'b', so I deleted the 'b' glyph and re-pasted from
  illustrator, re-defined kerning and metrics and recompiled, only to have the 'i'
  freaking out this time.\r\n\r\nAnother couple of things to be noted: if I tweak
  the tracking a little in pages, the problem seems to fix itself at random values;
  using the same font in NeoOffice and making a justified paragraph doesn't cause
  any problems or visible bugs.\r\n\r\nSo, has anybody any idea of what might be the
  cause of this bug? Any thoughts or suggestions?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance!"

  body: Could be a font cache problem. To prevent this I give my fonts always a new
    family name (MyName 001, MyName 002) when I export it. So I am always sure nothing
    gets mixed up in the various font caches on Mac OS X.

  body: "Thanks for the tip!\r\nI rebuilt from scratch the 'i' glyph, changed family
    name and recompiled the font file. Then I cleared the system-font cache, rebooted,
    and fired up pages. The problem was there again, but this time affected the 'l'
    glyph. I also checked for the bug in InDesign, Illustrator and Photoshop CS3:
    none of them showed the bug. I'm beginning to think that it could be something
    with apple's justifying module, which could be shared by some apps (pages, numbers,
    fontexplorer x...). \r\nGiven the market share of these apps I think I could easly
    leave things as they are, but this problem bugs me a lot!\r\nIf anybody has encountered
    something similar or has any other ideas, you're very welcome! "

  body: What format have you created your font in? Does your font have all the necessary
    blanks and default glyphs? .notdef, space, nbspace for PS. .notdef, space, nbspace,
    CR, .null for TT.

    unchecked in the Font Info panel; now paragraph justification works fine even
    in apple pages. Thank you very much!'
