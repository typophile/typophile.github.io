body: I&#39;m on Justin Howes&#39; mailing list. This morning I was shocked and saddened
  to receive an email from his parents via his list saying that he had died unexpectedly
  yesterday. <BR> <BR>The most recent message I had received from Justin was an announcement
  that at the end of this month he was to join the staff of the Museum Plantin-Moretus
  for six months to help research the Plantin types. <BR> <BR>Justin is known for
  his facsimile revivals of Caslon&#39;s types &#40;see the <a href="http://www.hwcaslon.com/"

    plans. Some links on Justin&#39;s work here...   <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/news.aspx?NID=4665"

  body: Me too. <BR> <BR>I &#34;knew&#34; Justin mostly in that virtual online sense,
    though we met briefly once or twice at conferences. I gave him some tips on OpenType
    development, and he asked lots of very reasonable questions. <BR> <BR>Recently
    Adobe had an issue with our next-gen apps and ITC Founders Caslon, which he was
    a great help in debugging. It turned out to be something I decided to fix on our
    end, but he would have been happy to revise his fonts if it would help. <BR> <BR>Justin
    was always friendly, courteous, intellectually engaged, and when it came to design/technology
    decisions quite focused on the actual users of his typeface. <BR> <BR>My last
    non-mass email from him was two weeks ago today. <BR> <BR>It all feels very unreal,
    somehow. <BR>Goodbye, Justin. <BR> <BR>T

    his last thoughts were of something like that.

  body: "Sent from <a href=\"http://www.stbride.org/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Friends
    of St Bride</a> today: <BR> <BR>A service of thanksgiving for Justin&#39;s life
    will be held in St Bride <BR>church on 9 May 2005 at 3pm. <BR> <BR>Justin was
    one of the strongest supporters of the Friends and his <BR>untimely death will
    be keenly felt. He was responsible for <BR>re-establishing the Friends in 1998
    and was our Chairman until 2003. <BR>Since then Justin has continued to support
    us, giving gifts to the <BR>library up to a few weeks ago. Without Justin the
    Friends would simply <BR>not exist and we will always be indebted to him. The
    Friends was not the <BR>only cause that Justin championed. It was largely thanks
    to his efforts <BR>that the archives of the Sheffield based typefounders Stephenson
    Blake <BR>were preserved in the Type Museum. Until recently Justin also worked
    in <BR>the Type Museum as part-time curator. <BR> <BR>Always busy with many projects,
    Justin always found the time to share <BR>his knowledge with others and many of
    us will miss his help and advice <BR>as well as his friendship. Over the years
    he made many contributions in <BR>the field of printing history beginning with
    articles in Matrix and Isis <BR>while studying as an undergraduate at Christ Church
    College, Oxford. He <BR>then edited Edward Johnston&#39;s Lessons in formal writing
    with Heather <BR>Child, published by Lund Humphries in 1986. A year later he published
    a <BR>catalogue of the Edward Johnston Collection at the Crafts Study Centre <BR>at
    Bath University. He remained fascinated by Johnston and later wrote <BR>Johnston&#39;s
    underground type, published by Capital Transport in 2000. He <BR>also published
    in numerous journals and lectured across the country and <BR>abroad on a number
    of different subjects. <BR> <BR>Justin was a typographer as well as a printing
    historian. He was <BR>responsible for designing many books, some quite sumptuous,
    but will be <BR>remembered in particular for his masterful digital version of
    the Caslon <BR>typeface. <BR> <BR>Perhaps the saddest thing about Justin&#39;s
    death is that he left so many <BR>projects unfinished, some of which had been
    long-term ambitions that <BR>were soon to bear fruit -- his six-month stay at
    the Plantin-Moretus <BR>Museum in Antwerp and his PhD on the development of letterforms
    and <BR>concepts of lettering, 1680\u20131830 to name but two. <BR> <BR>Our thoughts
    are with his parents at this time. <BR> <BR>Justin&#39;s obituary in The Times:
