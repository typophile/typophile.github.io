  body: 'You are on OS X or OS 9?? Under OS X Adobe has installed several fonts under:
    Library/Application Support/Adobe/Fonts/Reqd/Base -- making them only available
    to Adobe Applications. Using Font Reserve I manually removed them, but was worried
    this might cause problems so put them back. If you move them and seem to have
    several successful days in a row, let me know too.'

  body: Silly me for <i>that</i> assumption. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> However, I would still assume that there is some kind
    of application support folder. Have you searched around the user to user forums
    on adobe&#39;s site? Maybe you could search your system for application support.
    Hmmm. I&#39;m definitely not the person to ask about Windows machines. Sorry.
    :/

  body: Colin, <BR> <BR>Adobe apps have their own Font folders. Check your Illustrator
    and PhotoShop folders for a Fonts sub-folder, and also check <BR> <BR>C:\Program
    Files\Common Files\Adobe\Fonts <BR> <BR>You will probably find the Myriad fonts
    lurking in one of these places, indicating that they came bundled with the Adobe
    app. You can copy from this location to your Windows Fonts folder. <BR> <BR> <BR>Eduardo,
    ATM is unnecessary on Windows 2000 and XP; there is built in system support for
    PS fonts, so they can be dropped into the Windows Fonts folder just like TT fonts.

  body: If you do install ATM on Windows 2000 or XP, be aware that subsequently uninstalling
    ATM can result in complete lack of PS font support. The current system PS rasterisers
    are &#39;blackbox&#39; software from Adobe, and are basically just the rasterising
    portion of ATM. Installing and then removing ATM from your system deletes the
    ATM rasterisers but does not restore the original system rasterisers.
