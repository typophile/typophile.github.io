  body: "Like many of the fonts available through LostType, this one has no copyright
    or other internal identifying information. It only says \"generated by FontLab\".
    There is external text on the website giving the name of the font's creator (James
    Edmonson) and a little background material. Their fonts can be obtained for any
    price from zero up.\r\n\r\nSome of their fonts, like \"Dude\" have explicit licensing
    terms for that particular family (presented quite informally), but the unattributed
    fonts have none.  Does anybody have any idea what licensing might apply to such
    fonts? I doubt that they're public domain, but they might as well be.\r\n\r\n
