body: Hi everyone, im in need in help.  i am still a student and i am taking typography
  classes and all that good stuff.  im a graphic designer.  the thing is that i dont
  know what fonts to choose for certain situations.  people think faster then me,
  like it just clicks with them.  i lose sleep thinking about fonts and sometimes
  it makes me ill.  Does anyone else have that problem??  well my brother is expanding
  his corporation and he wants a logo design for &#34;Internation Flooring&#34;, which
  that is the name.  I guess his theme is Home of fine carpet.  &#40;which that is
  fine, but i dont know where to start.&#41;  how do i incorporate international.  its
  not like it has an image or a color, its international.  As, for carpet, carpet
  has a texture to it, so what font would i really use.  Do i make it more classy
  font, more wavy, more bubbly.  Im just clueless. ANd his theme, do i add it in the
  logo or leave it out. I told him that it would take me forever and im not that confident
  yet, but he has faith in me so i dont want to let him down,  any suggestions???

    Grab a pen, go to a cafe, grab a napkin and draw crazy ideas. The more the merrier.
    Once you have an idea then refine it in pen or pencil and show it to some other
    creatives and get feedback. Then go to the computer and you will look for the
    fonts that fit your design. <BR> <BR>One other thing. Research! Visit competive
    sites even local retail stores. See what they are doing right and wrong. Hang
    in there and post some of your ideas.

    font isn&#39;t that important. You&#39;re over-thinking the details before your
    thinking about the big picture. <BR> <BR>What are the goals of the new logo? What&#39;s
    wrong with the old one? What types of applications will the logo be used on? What&#39;s
    the target demographic? What&#39;s the competition look like? Etc, etc. <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t
    worry about a specific typeface at this stage...that will come naturally later
    on.

    computer and print out the results. Keep challenging your decisions. Look at things
    by the dawn&#39;s ugly light. Draw, sketch, draw, sketch, ad infinitum. Guys who
    hit home runs have been swinging bats at fast balls for more than a semester.

    Stealing Sheep &amp; Find Out How Type Works</a>, it&#39;s a good basic tutorial
    on type styles and how/when/why to use different fonts. Ask Santa for a copy!

  body: '&#60;font class=&#34;dontLookLikeCrap&#34;&#62;I agree with Darrel: you haven&#39;t
    yet asked yourself what this logo will BE, and that&#39;s the first step, before
    &#39;what will it look like?&#39;  The second follows naturally from the first.&#60;/font&#62;'
