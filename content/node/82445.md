  body: "This is interesting. A quick look at both of these fonts makes it seem that
    the only real difference is the width. Galaxie Copernicus is rounder, Tiempos
    Text is slightly more condensed, and Tiempos Headline is even more condensed,
    but still not dramatically. Kris Sowersby is the common denominator in all of
    these. I think Rinaldo (tungsteno) is right that this is Tiempos Text, at least
    for the lighter weight sample, because the 'o' is more oval than the 'o' in Galaxie
    Copernicus. It's harder to decide about the heavy type, because they are so close
    in the heavier weights, but I would guess it's also Tiempos Text in the bold weight.\r\n\r\n-
