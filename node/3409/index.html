You also might look at the typeface Mostra, it was based on art deco designs unlike the face you are using here.  The face you are using is more of an Art Nouveau era.

		<div class="commentbody">Maybe my lack of graphic design senstivity is getting me here, but I really like what you have so far! Yes, it doesn't look like a palm tree, and yes, it does remind of a paw print (a good association though), but most of all it's like a really friendly -and tasty- alien plant form. Something you would squeeze to get the most delicious juice! It's not 3D is a cheesy way - it just has a nice depth and blobby dimensionality. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I also like the A&amp;C font (just a darker weight if possible) - but the Trade Gothic has got to go.

		<div class="commentbody">I obviously need to redraw the paw print.. ugh I meant palm tree. Thanks for the feedback. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The customer wants the globular look. It's like an oil or water drop that is shown growing into a palm tree or person, but not a paw print. They are more interested in something esthetic and unique rather than something with obvious meaning. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think I'll play around with uneven palms for my next attempt. I can't narrow the trunk otherwise it will look like a pot plant. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I did play around with quite a few classic art deco era typefaces but their clean geometric shapes don't work well with an amorphous logo IMHO. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The organic feel of turn of the century arts &amp; craft or Art Nouveau (I never figured out the difference) seems to work better with oil slicks. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I really like Willow here. It's borderline too whimsical but the organisation helps the homeless and low income residents so it was important to make it friendly and non corporate looking. I'm almost ready to throw away the logo just to keep the typeface.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Scott: Could you please expand on why Willow doesn't go with a 3D shape? Surely you don't mean adding bevel or shadows. What are fonts that would fit the bill 3D wise? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hrant: Willow has only one weight. I wouldn't make it heavier anyway since the lettering would then stand out too much with respect to the logo. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I had to darken the colour of the green for that same reason (using gray for the typeface wasn't an option to keep costs down). <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What type would you recommend instead of Trade Gothic? Associating typefaces is one area where I need more experience. I'm at the very beginning of developing a feel for it. My background is in technology, not visual design. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thanks all for you time. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->New logo to follow in a few hours, that is if I can work through the F1 Grand Prix ruckus. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

The work of Scottish architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh inspired this condensed sans serif style with its rough edges and selection of alternative and ligatured letters.

		<div class="commentbody">Bernard &ndash;&gt; I find the perspective drawing of the palm trees in version 8c more interesting. The perspective adds depth that is not seen in this latest version.

The weight of the typeface conflict (for me) with the line weight of the drawing (looking at 9b). &lt;/font&gt;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">yes, Neuland is too much. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Block would have been ideal with the oily blobs but my customer prefers the latest logo versions. They also like the Willow typeface. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I was chatting with a Glasgow native last night and she was familiar with the Willow typeface from seeing similar lettering in jeweleries, galleries and some buildings. It certainly doesn't carry the same cultural baggage over here. I chose it simply for esthetic reason although its vague 1900 feel fits in too. The organisation helps low income people in rooming houses which often date from the beginning of the last century. Hum..sounds better than I thought. I may just use that one if I'm shoved against the wall to justify the typeface. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->PS: ParaType sells a Bloc copycat for only $25.</div>
