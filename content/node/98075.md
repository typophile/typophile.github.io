  have a look at the jpg attached).\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://typophile.com/files/Sutnar_catalog_design_cover.jpg\"
  alt=\"catalog design\">\r\n\r\nThe sample provided is taken from the cover of \u201CCatalog
  design\u201D by Ladislav Sutnar, 1944 (New York: Sweet\u2019s Catalog Service).
  20.8 x 14.8 cm\r\n\r\nThe scan is out of the book \"Active Literature - Jan Tschichold
  and New Typography\" by Christopher Burke, Hyphen Press, London, 2007\r\n\r\nAny
  more information about this lettering would be helpful, espcially about digital
  redrawings etc.\r\n\r\nLooking forward for your comments, \r\nLorenz"
