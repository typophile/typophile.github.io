  have set the kerning space at 40. I'm just wondering if this looks OK or is the
  kerning needs altering.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanking you in advance,\r\n\r\nJason.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/daze_6331.gif]"

  body: "What program are you using? I think you mean you've set the tracking to 40
    (perhaps -40?). Kerning is between individual letters.\r\n\r\nKerning is partly
    a matter of taste and desired effect, so there's more that one way to skin a cat.
    I would say that the apparent space between the A and the Z is too great compare
    to the ZE space. How to fix this? Loosen the ZE pair, tighten the AZ pair, or
    do both. My first inclination would be to loosen the ZE a bit."

  body: "Hi Jason, characters A and Z are too close. The way they are at the moment,
    I see them create an arrow/lightning. I don't know whats the logo for, but maybe
    you could use the negative space to your advantage, by altering the letters?\r\n\r\nSB"

  body: Thanks! Yes, I have set the tracking to 40. I guess it's just a matter of
    playing around with it until it looks right I guess. It's evenly spaced at present
    but it doesn't look right to me. Thanks for your help.

  body: "In a word like this, your AZ pair will be the limiting variable. Get these
    in the relationship you want \u2014 touching? not touching? how close/far? \u2014
    then work with the other two pairs so that they look balanced and equivalent."

  body: "The acute stem joints of \"Z\" are oddly treated in the bolder weights of
    Futura.\r\nIn the light weights, all acute joints are pointed, with this becoming
    a flat terminal in the heavier weights. But not for Z, and hence the problem here.\r\nUse
    a different face for this combination of letters, or redraw the Z."
