body: "The 1960's and 1970's are the inspiration for Sugarbang! Everything from music
  packages, beach party movies of the 60's to cereal box art of the 1970's are reflected
  in the kooky style that this font evokes. Sugarbang! is built on a random baseline
  so letterforms bounce up and down adding to the \u201Czany\u201D look of the design.
  It is a minimal font set which includes uppercase and lowercase letterforms. Suggested
  uses for the font would be above 42 points in size. Please note its normal tight
  spacing and that cap \u201CT\u201D and cap \u201CL\u201D have been specially kerned
  to account for the overhang of certain other letterforms. Sugarbang!- just add milk
  and it\u2019s sugar frosted font goodness. Available at http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/astrolux/sugarbang/
