  body: "\"recording studio/practice space\" at the very bottom looks like it might
    have a bit of trouble when you got to print, bit lost in the palette.\r\n\r\nAlso
    on the map if those are still lines in illustrator say, object>path>outline stroke,
    then merge them under the pathfinder tool to create a solid colour.\r\n\r\nMat.\r\n"
