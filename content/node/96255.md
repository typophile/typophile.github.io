body: "Hey all! This font is on a business card I had made back in the day but I have
  gotten a new computer and the client wants a new business card but wants to keep
  the same font. I thought this font was Verdana but I obviously am wrong. I am not
  sure if I had altered the kerning or the spacing on this but I have forgotten what
  font I had used to make this font. \r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\n\r\nNB"

  body: It looks like some cut of Avant Garde Gothic (the shape of |c| is pretty distinctive
    among geometric sans).
