  body: "I haven't printed it to judge accurately, but it looks to me like your straight
    verticals appear stronger than the thicks of your rounds, esp. in lowercase.\r\n\r\nI
    would consider:\r\n- rethinking the g completely\r\n- evening the counters on
    the a more\r\n- widening the V\r\n- narrowing the r\r\n- altering the curve of
    the J - looks like it will tip over\r\n- smoothing the bend in e's tail\r\n- alternate
    ways of making the Q's tail\r\n\r\nThough the top of it may be too wide, there's
    something I really like about the s.\r\n\r\n"

    this project so re-rethinking the g seems a bit overkill. I'm still working on
    a lot of the changes, but here is a text sample of the lighter verticals.\r\n\r\n-Eric

  body: "Yeah, the three of you are right about the 'g'. I think the counters need
    to be balanced...I tried too hard to make g relate directly to d,p,b,q. Here's
    a last attempt with g relating closer to the counters of a. Thanks for the honesty.
    If this doesn't work I'll have to abandon the 3-story g for the generic g also
    seen here.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/marquam_6083.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n-Eric

  body: "Here is the newest version of Marquam (Please see revised pdf in first post).
    The new  I have trimmed down some curvy, quirkiness to make the font more serious.
    \r\n\r\nThere are too many changes to showcase individually in images, but I can
    mention them. Looking back at previous versions of this is kind of embarassing
    now, but:\r\n\r\n \u2022 'a' has lost the wavy terminal\r\n \u2022 'g' has balanced
    counters and a smaller top-story\r\n \u2022 unnecessary notches have been filled
    in in capitals\r\n \u2022 'S,s' have more balanced counters\r\n \u2022 '6,9' have
    terminals closer to the '4', then to '2,3,5'\r\n \u2022 more even outer-curves
    on 'u,n,h'\r\n \u2022 flat crossbar on 'e' \r\n\r\nI have also added an italic
    companion. Any feedback on the changes would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n-Eric

  body: "It's now much stronger. The weak point is still the g. The top part needs
    to be less lopsided. (And there's some funky overstrike going on right now.)  Maybe
    an ear, too.\r\n\r\nI'm not entirely sure the difference in the way the curves
    join n and u, for example, works. I'd rather see the n-join carried over to the
    u. (I realize you've consistently thinned the lower joins, but I think they look
    too thin.) \r\n\r\nAlso, the second join on the m needs some love, the y is a
    tad heavy where the tail joins, and the top of the s is too flat.\r\n\r\nOverall,
    I like where this is going. Keep at it!"

  body: The tail of the Q is a bit off center on italic and roman. The g (double storey)
    on your sketch is better than the first one you've drawn, but not a good one yet.
    I prefer the one storey so far. I think there is too much curve in it, also the
    little point on bottom left side of the top of the counterform doesn't help it.
    I think some oblique line A, M,N and some bowl are too thick especially where
    the stem meet the oblique. The bowl of the P and the R on the italic version are
    too little especially the P. The top of the 6 and the tail of the 9 should be
    like the 2 and 3. Keep going.

  body: "Thanks for the comments speter and sim. I'm reworking the 'g' again adding
    a tail to it. Update images and pdf's soon to come.\r\n\r\n@speter\r\n\r\nI recognize
    that the lower joins look too thin to fit the entire font...one thing that I am
    toying with right now to remedy the situation is trying open-joins on P, B, and
    R, to make the thin lower joins more acceptable.\r\n\r\n@sim\r\n\r\nI recognize
    that the 'little point' in the two-story 'g' does not follow the continuity of
    the other notched points in the font; 'g' has a notched joint at a bowl joining
    another curved stroke. I would like to keep it because I am looking to create
    a continuity in the counter forms and g's top counter is close to a's lower counter
    in proportion and scale. If there is consensus among everyone that looks at that
    the multiple story 'g' cannot work in this way, then I will abandon it and go
    with the much simpler 'g'\r\n\r\nSide Note: I thought that the circle + hooked
    tail 'g' was '3-story' as it has 3 distinct counter forms.\r\n\r\n-Eric MacLeod\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    the join on the K catches the eye way too much. On the R, how would a straight
    leg look? I think a slightly narrower a would be better. \r\n\r\nKeep on going!
    This is looking nice."
