  body: "adnix --\r\n\r\nThe Whitman Display fonts that I completed last summer are
    actually available for license now. They just haven't been \"officially\" released
    -- i.e., integrated into the Retail site for purchase and download. You have to
    contact Font Bureau directly.\r\n\r\nThe Display fonts were set to be launched
    back in October last year. But then <cite>Fortune</cite> magazine commissioned
    Display Italics for the normal width (among other styles). So, now FB has decided
    they want to wait until I add Display Condensed & Compressed Italics in all seven
    weights before launching. \r\n\r\nI'm hoping to turn my attention to those after
    I finish working with David Jonathan Ross to establish the framework for his expansion
    of the Whitman Text family to full-featured OpenType fonts.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime,
    I've put a PDF sample of the Whitman Display fonts on my site: http://www.kentlew.com/Type/WhitmanDisplay_Sample.pdf\r\n[<em>In
    case anyone is reading this months or years later: This sample probably won't
    be up after the fonts are released.</em>]\r\n\r\nBut if you're interested in licensing
    the Whitman Display fonts now (or the text Bold Italic or Semibolds for that matter),
    you can contact the folks at Font Bureau by e-mail or phone.\r\n\r\n-- Kent.\r\n"

    get it that way, but we had to settle for OpenType in Font Bureau. \r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n"

  body: "Eluard -- I'm afraid it's too early to say with any precision. I certainly
    don't have enough experience with this to predict an endpoint. Since the project
    is aimed at expanding features and weights, there's a fair bit to be done. We're
    definitely talking in terms of months, not weeks. But my personal hope is that
    DJR can have this all finished up by TypeCon this summer.\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n\r\n"
