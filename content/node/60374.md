  It got me thinking about my choice of type and which faces I use, again and again.
  Well, here they are.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/faces_5358.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  have been through years of trying new creations, the latest ideas and fashions,
  and I keep going back to these. Why? They are elegant, they are drawn well, they
  have a timeless quality, the kerning math is well done and their forms submit to
  all kinds of manipulations. I admire the conviction and work of Massimo Vignelli,
  but unlike him I am not attached to these because I have a manifesto based in modernity
  or even post-modernity. I am not attached to them because of the historical or aesthetic
  associations that come with them, but rather because in and of themselves I think
  they are beautiful. They each possess a distinctive quality, but they work well
  together, alone or as pieces of a design. I guess I am more of an essentialist than
  a historicist.\r\n\r\nConversely, I don\u2019t neglect typefaces because they connote
  bad associations (ala Paula Scher), but rather because I find most other faces clunky,
  programmed all wrong, comical, immature and too self-absorbed. Idiosyncratic is
  the word. The list of these is long. For instance, I love the design of Scala, but
  it does not work everywhere, it is incredibly specialized and only fits with very
  particular applications. Another is Bau. It looks nice at the lighter weights (because
  it emulates Helvetica/ Berthold Akzidenz?), but the heavier weights become comical
  and kind of ridiculous, shooting off angular tangents that mix up a layout. Maybe
  their DNA is just not in my blood. \r\n\r\nFor me, after ten years of wringing my
  hands over the next FontFont catalog, 8 is enough. When I need something ultra-unique,
  I draw it myself, and it stays with the project for which it was created as a one-off
  design. This approach works for me.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nChris"
