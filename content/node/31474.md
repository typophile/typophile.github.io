body: "Hey Everyone.\r\n\r\nI did a project for school about 2 years ago, that I'm
  currently updating - and looking back I have no idea what font this is (see attachment).
  \ It might be a free font, but it was made on a school computer, and then create
  to outlines so I could work on it from home and then play with the perspective (I
  fit it into an emblem).\r\n\r\nIn addition, I would love to hear some suggestions
  of any good commercial square corner fonts that are similar or would work in the
  same application/use (fitting nicely to the shape/emblem that is rests in).\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMike"

    know of a similar, yet 'aged' font... (square sans)."

  body: or one of the woodtype style fonts, either 'hokey', like ironwood or mesquite...
    or one of the more 'postmodern' versions, of which council is my favourite
