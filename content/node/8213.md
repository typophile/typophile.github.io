body: Hi <BR>i need to make a logotype for swedish punkband...  well...  it is 2005..  and
  i was a punkrocker in late seventies..  so for me it feels a bit daft doing this....  but
  that&#39;s beside the point...  anyway.. i wonder if there is a recipy for &#34;scratching&#34;
  and make the font look worn-out..   if you know what i mean?!  i have seen stamp-effect
  recipy here...  so maybe somebody has a way of doing what i want to do  <BR> <BR>thanx

    and check out Machine Wash image filters. Whats so cool about them is they give
    you that look but are not distructive so you can try lots of different looks.

  body: I&#39;ve found that photocopier distress works extremely well to &#34;punkify&#34;.  Simply
    take a hard copy and reduce by 25% then take that copy, and enlarge by 400%. <BR>
    <BR>If you&#39;re lucky, the copier will still use the electrostatic method and
    you can rub off the toner with sandpaper or use packing tape to pull it off.

  body: I did an edvert for a magazine that featured hardcore punk bands. I typed
    out the text, printed two copies and cut and pasted them down to a sheet of paper.
    I used regular tape and at times wanked the tape back up and replaced it a bit
    off, pulling ink with it and making a corroded ghost double of the letter.  <BR>I
    then photographed the page with a digital camera and kicked up the contrast to
    100% in photoshop. We had to advertise a specific CD as well, so I did that below
    the flyer using the same tpeface but clean. <BR>Attatched is how it came out.

  body: Kevin, are you from Baltimore? I lived in Baltimore until I was 17. Then I
    went to RISD, and ultimately, to Germany. What sort of graphic designer community
    does it have?

  body: Gosh, I wish I knew, heh. <BR>  I moved here about 2 years ago and have barely
    left my apartment. I should be more active and engage other designers but I&#39;m
    not terribly sure where to begin. <BR>  I&#39;ve taken some evening classes at
    the art school &#40;MICA&#41;, but they&#39;re &#34;continuing education&#34;
    classes and most of the people in it seem to be inexperienced housewives that
    want to &#34;do something different&#34;.  <BR> <BR>KIS
