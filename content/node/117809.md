  a multicolor font (using Abdobe/Mozilla's SVG-in-OpenType technique). It'll show
  up like your average singlecolor font in browser that don't support this yet, but
  it'll show up in classic green/gray colors in Firefox, and soon Chrome.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bpj6a02CMAAC85k_4593.png]\r\n\r\nYou
  can download the TTF/WOFF  [[http://pixelambacht.nl/2014/compyx-a-multicolor-8bit-font/|in
  the blog post]].\r\n\r\nI was wondering if you know a good place to upload this
  font so it can be used by more people. It's pretty much open source/public domain."

    is invisible... But signing up through Firefox works.
