  body: Close is F2 FOCR Bczyk LTStd-Regular from Linotype. Getting all letters will
    be difficult.

    body: Thanks a lot for your kind reply; however I would be ok with a closer match
      of the a, f, t. OCR Bczyk won't do the trick. I think we should explore more
      in the direction of old grotesque styles, like AG Old Face or Nurom.

  body: Regarding /a/f/t style you may also like <strong>[[http://www.dafont.com/kasseflf.font?text=Karl+Fuchs+Baugeschaft|Kasse
    FLF]]</strong> by Casady & Greene, although it's more curvy & a bit square...

  body: "Can't find a digital match. Probably another font from the pre-digital area.
    Reminds me of this [[http://typophile.com/node/118035|recent case]], still unsolved,
    some kind of Helvetica-ish Extended slightly contrasted with some over-curved
    terminals (/r, /f...). Could also be the same typeface used for 'fnac' logo (see
    below).\r\nAlternatives: [[http://www.houseind.com/fonts/chalet|Chalet]] (mixing
    styles), [[http://commercialtype.com/typefaces/druk|Druk]] Wide\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fnac_5819.jpg]"

  body: Or take a look at PL Brazilia Seven from Agfa. Could be easily modified from
    this.

  body: Wow! Good call, Bob! Brazilia Seven is a very good alternative! Works at least
    for 'fnac' ;)
