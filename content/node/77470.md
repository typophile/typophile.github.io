body: "I've started the extreme contrast variant of Grumpy. What do you think?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Gr_5623.png]\r\nSome
  of the diagonal hairlines are pretty tough to handle, but overall it seems to work
  pretty well.\r\nI also finished the basic Black variant, and ended up with some
  2000 kerning pairs, and with class based kerning on top of that, so there should
  be enough to go around.\r\n"

    its own Unicode point: Ux2116, by the Cyrillic block.'

    z still looks wide to me.\r\nI love the three! And the alt seven is fun too.\r\nFor
    the display, did you try blowing the serifs on the thins way up? They look so
    puny to me."
