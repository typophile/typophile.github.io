    a good cover, compared to those of us who buy and/or create books like these.
    I feel for David on the cover issue - I&#39;ve been in his helpless shoes in that
    regard. But the guts of the book sound promising, and should prove well worth
    ignoring the less-than-lovely exterior. '

  body: 'Honest appraisal from the author: <BR> <BR>The introduction is self-absorbed
    and self-indulgent. Sorry. The cover is horrible, and I told my editor that countless
    times. Its ugliness is compounded by the fact that, amazingly, the repro house
    screwed up the alignment of some of the glyphs moments before going to print.
    If you buy the book, burn the dust jacket and send me a photo of the flames. Please.
    <BR> <BR>The main bulk of the book comprises of the interviews, however. There
    are some good chapters and some bad chapters, as you might expect from a first-time
    and inexperienced author, and from the range of those interviewed. Matthew Carter
    had some great things to say, based on a long and immensely enjoyable phone conversation
    with him, for example, and Jonathan Hoefler had some very valuable things indeed
    to share on the subject.  <BR> <BR>The interviews are accompanied by examples
    of the designers work, both straight typeface design and graphic design, and where
    possible there are early developmental examples to illustrate a typeface&#39;s
    progression. Jeremy Tankard&#39;s and Erik Spiekermann&#39;s early development
    work, both for typeface and typographic design, spring to mind as particularly
    strong examples. <BR> <BR>One thing that pleased me was the diversity of approaches
    from all the designers, mainly due to their different age ranges and cultural
    backgrounds, and I think this has been reflected in the book. Its non-prescriptive
    as a result. <BR> <BR>Anyhow. Its ok. I&#39;m not Robert Bringhurst. <BR> <BR>One
    final point - the book is primarily aimed at students and designers in the early
    part of their careers, and the text will naturally reflect this. The tutorial
    bit, for example, is aimed at those VERY early on in their type design career,
    so dont beat me too hard on that one.  <BR> <BR>That said, there is plenty in
    the body of the book to be of interest to those further along in their hopefully
    lifelong studies.'

    expecting something that looked like &#34;Looking Closer&#34; series.... now those
    I have to hide. <BR> <BR>I used to work for a man who had been student of Paul
    Rand. One day he was showing me a work of Mueller-Brockmann&#39;s and excitedly
    said, &#34;pink! it&#39;s the most hideous color in the history of the world,
    yet here it becomes elegant.&#34; <BR> <BR>David, ya made pink elegant. Can&#39;t

  body: Having spoken to the publisher today, it appears that the book is published
    in the UK and distributed here and in the USA.  Availability in non-English-speaking
    countries is therefore very much up to individual stores or chains, apparently.
    I guess there is always Amazon.  <BR>  <BR>In the meantime, contributors, if they
    have yet to receive their copies, should be receiving them this week, though it
    is dependant on international postal services as to exactly when.

    development to finished design.The cover is not great but I get the point. Everyone
    seriously interested in type development and design should own this.  <BR>Jordan
