  body: This is hand-lettered, but there is a font which is similar. I just can't
    think of it right now.

  body: "Looking at the other lettering without the fills, I am inclined to think
    this might be a font. I think the fills were a hand-edit. \r\n\r\nI am looking
    for this font in Part 14 of the Script Font ID Guide.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Not an exact match, but Chank's <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/chank/coffeedance/\">Coffeedance</a>
    has somewhat a similar feel, although with more bounce.\r\n\r\nI am sure this
    sample uses a font, but finding it may be a problem. It could be one of the 'cheap,
    easy to make hand-printed fonts\" that frustrate us so often.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
