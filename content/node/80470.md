body: I am looking for examples of hand-painted letters from the nineteenth century,
  especially created in North America. I am interested in finding a wide range of
  styles, so anything at all would be appreciated. Could anyone point me towards books,
  websites, etc. with examples?

    books are somewhat rare and, therefore, somewhat pricey..."

    by hand-lettering.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.artisticprintingbook.com/|The Handy Book
    of Artistic Printing]]\r\n\r\nAlso, similar to both Nicks' suggestions, check
    the local history sections in public libraries and bookstores. Most books of 19th
    Century photographs will have city scenes with signage.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.handletteringforum.com/|The
    Hand Lettering Forum]] might be a good source of people restoring these signs
    or still using the techniques."
