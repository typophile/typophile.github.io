body: "I'm looking for a quotation mark that works as a display-size graphic and pairs
  well with Ed Roman and Ed Gothic:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/getimage&#91;1&#93;_5888.php_id=830]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/getimage&#91;1&#93;_3518.php_id=829]\r\n\r\nI've
  made Ed Roman warmer and heavier with an outline stroke (not shown). And don't worry
  about the quotation marks being \"fun,\" I can just shift one glyph higher than
  the other to make it fit in.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the quotes on these fonts don't
  quite work for me, nor does anything I currently have installed. The best I could
  come up with, oddly, was Stencil, the \"it came with the computer\" font. Here's
  Ed Gothic, Ed Roman and Stencil:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/quotes_4351.png]\r\n\r\nGothic's
  to stubby, Roman's too wiry, and Stencil has about the right proportion, but the
  tail (finial? hangy-down? hangy-up?) should probably come to a point, or near-point.
  Here they are, more \"fun\":\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/funquotes_5194.png]\r\n\r\nAny
  suggestions?<!--break-->"

  body: 'It''s more or less the same stubby character as Ed Gothic. I should stress
    that the quotation mark will be a standalone graphic. The actual quotation text
    will be set in a web font, likely Georgia. The quotation mark should really just
    look like what an average user would expect it to look like: a big ball with a
    curl coming out of it, tapering to a point ... and then a twin next to it.'
