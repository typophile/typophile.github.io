  some broad research around the area of board games and would be very grateful if
  some of you would take the time to fill in a brief (10 question) survey.\r\n\r\nThe
  survey can be found at [[http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/DQT9VKW]]\r\n\r\nI am looking
  at board games from the point of view of a graphic designer (currently a part-time
  MA student), and specifically, a typographer (albeit not a very accomplished one).
  However this survey is very much a general overview of the board game demographic
  and is not specifically concerned with graphical elements. My reason for posting
  here is that I would like to try and source information from people who are not
  necessarily primarily involved with or concerned by board games (unlike, for example,
  the community at boardgamegeek.com)\r\n\r\nI know the whole student-research issue
  has been a bone of contention around these forums before, but hopefully no-one will
  find anything to be offended by in this request.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time. "

    but I am both a typographer and a game enthusiast. In fact, I almost did a talk
    on the typography of boardgames for TypeCon this year. (They liked both my talk
    proposals, but I had to pick one, and I went with the other one.)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    poems were written and submitted by chess players from around the world. And as
