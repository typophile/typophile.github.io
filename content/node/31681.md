body: "Can anybody give some samples for good naming practice in the Font Info window
  (for FontLab).\r\nPlease, provide tested examples that work fine in common design
  programs such InDesign, etc. \r\n\r\nI have to generate a set of fonts divided in
  several families:\r\n\r\nSmidswater\r\nSmidswater italic\r\nSmidswater bold\r\nSmidswater
  bold italic\r\n\r\nSmidswater Condensed\r\nSmidswater Condensed italic\r\nSmidswater
  Condensed bold\r\nSmidswater Condensed bold italic\r\n\r\nWhat approach is better:
  to distinguish bold, italic, etc. by different \"Family Names\" or to use the same
  \"Family Name\"and to change the \"PS Font Name\" and \"Full Name\"?\r\nShall I
  leave the field \"Style Name\" empty for PS fonts? Why?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance
  for the help.\r\n\r\n"
