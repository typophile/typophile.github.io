  film \xABBerlin \u2013 Die Sinfonie der Gro\xDFstadt\xBB, created in Berlin in 1927.
  I think is the same that appears in the first episode of the documentary Apocalypse:
  The Second World War, when they introduce Berlin in the 20's, see attachments.\r\n\r\nAny
  help will be welcome!\r\n\r\nMarcel"
