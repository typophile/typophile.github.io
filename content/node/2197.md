    sell as many shirts as possible, shouldn&#39;t there be a somewhat formal voting

    &#34;captive consumer space&#34; in the forums. You can easily poll to get a rough

    would be interesting to see what popular favorites are, even if it doesn&#39;t
    change what &#34;wins&#34; or gets printed. <BR> <BR>This poll space has been
    so empty since its inception: probably because at that point there were not even
    five strong candidates, but the quality seems to have gotten much better in the
    last week, with presumably more goodies to come. &#91;apologies to those I may
    have just slighted with this remark.&#93; <BR> <BR>And hey, as judgement day looms,
    I&#39;m wondering how the judging is going to work. Is it ID Design Annual style,
    where there is some sort of dialogue from which we are treated to salient gems?
    Do they rate the shirts, make a list of five, narrow to a &#34;semifinalists&#34;
    stage, or is it all too arcane for us to know? '

    Cooper does need some respect. In turn I think it would spark alot of conversations...people
    would ask about cooper, you could have a real conversation without sounding dotcommy
    and have your opportunity to plug the site. <BR> <BR>38.021 I&#39;ve never seen
    anything before that combines futuristics, scripts, displays and blackletters,
    sans serifs all together into a pleasing design that means something. I think
    the designer was trying to cover all bases. and then there&#39;s the whole look
    and feel and concept thing. <BR> <BR>28.001 yay dingbats, I&#39;ve tried for a
    few years now to convince companies that dingbatting their name could be excellent
    for branding. no ones taken to it, and here&#39;s my opportunity! I&#39;ll wear
    it to meetings...symbols rule. and whats a letterform but a symbol anyway? Dingbats
    being so recognizable now I think they should be given the same uses...like braille
    for seeing people or soemthing. <BR> <BR>29.008 I like the relationship between
    font choice and the word. and then the justaposition or it all together too. its
    very clean. not much of an advertisement for typophile but is that needed anyway?
    is a t-shirt going to drive visitors..no. <BR> <BR>43.016 but with that black
    screen on. Its nice to fit words into squares, dosen&#39;t say much about what
    typophile is or does...but sticks to the point somewhat without being altruistic,
    or illustrative.  <BR> <BR>I would not wear flaming anything...in this city there&#39;s
    too many flaming identities, and I think its on its way to be the next trend,
    y&#39;no right after orbits and &#34;e&#34;-wotevers die off. '
