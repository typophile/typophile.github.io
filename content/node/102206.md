  have a logo mark which is in development which must be a 3 spoke design representing
  the 'Y' character. Each spoke is equal length and angle and I'm having difficulty
  matching it to a font and was wondering if anyone had any suggestions.\r\n\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen
  shot 2013-04-11 at 13_5835.03.28.png]\r\n\r\nI'm really looking for a font where
  this shape will fit in nicely as the 'Y'. If needs be I'll design a font around
  it but I was really hoping there was something out there which would fit it.\r\n\r\nThanks
  very much for any suggestions.\r\n\r\nA"
