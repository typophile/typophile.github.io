body: I know this might not be the best place for this thread but it does strongly
  involve type. I am becoming increasingly more interested in screen printing my type
  designs and was wondering if anyone has experience in this. Just wanted to get everyone's
  thoughts and maybe some good starting advice. I'm looking into building my own press,
  has anyone done this or does anyone have good plans? How about type printing in
  halftones? I have no experience with the screen printing process and would love
  to take a dive into it. Thanks for any words of wisdom you guys might have.
