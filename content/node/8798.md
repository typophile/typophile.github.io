  HERE, I think&#41; where people were contributing these kinds of lines to a thread
  &#40;do these demo lines have a name?&#41;...I am near to releasing my first ever
  display font, finished up in FontCreator, and would like to format the .ttf with
  something other than the standard, &#34;The Quick Brown Fox...&#34; <BR> <BR>Can
  anyone point me in the right direction? <BR> <BR>Many thanks in advance...

  body: 'I would also offer my <i>ordered</i> pangram for your use: <BR>&#34;Abacist
    defogs, hijacks luminous parquetry studio, views ex-yakuza.&#34; <BR>This makes
    it much easier to find &#40;hence evaluate&#41; the letters. <BR> <BR>I think
    this is the only ordered pangram ever made... unless you count its variant: <BR>&#34;Abacist&#39;s
    deaf dog hijacked luminous parquetry studio, avows ex-yakuza.&#34;  :-&#41; <BR>Containing
    a tribute to the grandaddy &#34;The quick brown fox ...&#34;, which is still hard
    to beat. <BR> <BR>hhp'
