body: "Bloomberg Businessweek's international cover for June is, according to the
  editiors,  \"ultra kawaii\" [ultra cute] with a pic of Japanese PM Shinzo Abe, bats,
  crying clouds, teddy bears, bows, life savers etc and a balloon like font identical
  to the word shown here:\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/KawaiiFontSM_4176.jpg]\r\nThe
  word is taken from a pic inside the North American edition. I only have a thumbnail
  of the international cover.\r\nKawaii is not my area of expertise so I am seeking
  help in IDing the font. If not the exact one, then some close ones.\r\nThanks\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: hm. based on the additional link which has repeat characters, i'd suggest
    it is not a font.

  body: "It's in the kawaii ball park -- the sample image even mentions rainbows &
    kitties. Haley Fiege's vfb embedding settings say \"everything is allowed\" so
    it would seem o.k. to edit it to lighten the weight to approximate the BBW lettering,
    \ to try and capture the creases in letters like the o, and to push letters off
    a strict vertical axis to get the jumbled together effect.\r\nDo we have any other
    candidates?\r\nDon\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for the Blambot suggestion. Closest Blambot is Boogers BB:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BoogersBB_3450.jpg]\r\nThe
    S is almost spot on. No lower case for i, a, e. Sniglet is better for the inflated
    balloon effect, but Boogers is easier to edit than Sniglet. \r\nYour suggestion
    of Blambot has prompted me to also check Comicraft.\r\nDon"
