  the chances of finding it are slim, especially when the image is so tiny and it's
  a handwritten font, but this forum seems to be the best place for it. :)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/007_5990.jpg]"

    a somehow better sample:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/vesuvio_3845.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
    problem is that it looks custom/handpainted - not a font: look at the 3 different
    /e and the 2 different /o.\r\n\r\nTake a look at the following similar handwriting

    see what you say about the different /e and /o. \r\nThank you for taking a look
    at it and for your suggestions, I think the last two look pretty close."
