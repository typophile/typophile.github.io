  body: I've got one of those! For anyone not up on vintage music technology this
    is a Japanese made drum machine from the very early '80s, which might help with
    the font ID. I need to check mine when I get home but I believe it has very slight
    serifs doesn't it? Off the top of my head I'd say it is a bit like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-serif-gothic/|ITC
    Serif Gothic]], although when checking that I see it is a little too ornate &
    certainly doesn't have the angled crossbar on the e.

    guess it could be a font specially made for Roland.\r\n\r\nPS.. Justin.. I'm extremely
    jealous! hehe. Do you make music?"

    I could've sworn we had that font at the newspaper I used to work at, but maybe
    I'm confusing it with one of the many things it's similar to. It's got a very
    Ed Benguiat look to it. Sort of Benguiat Gothic mixed with a little Bauhaus. Maybe
    it was custom font."

  body: aah yes, the tiny serifs are clearer to see on that manual. Makes me want
    it even more!

  body: "The 808 was a classic, especially in terms of how it revolutionised Electro
    music (we're talking early 80's NYC, btw) from diverse artists like Afrika Bambaata
    to early Depeche Mode and UK jazz funk band Freeeze (the track I.O.U. specifically).
    \ The 808 Kick and clap were killer in the clubs!  I always dreamed of owning
    one of those when I was a teenager, only being able to afford it's poor cousin
    the Roland Drumatix.  Nowadays, all the sounds it can do are available everywhere,
    especially complete sequencer packages like Propellerheads Reason.\r\n\r\nI think
    the 808 still carries a lot of kudos though and as such may well still command
    a respectable price.\r\n\r\nAnd where do you think 808 State got their name from...\r\n\r\nJH"

  body: "[[http://www.linotype.com/791/itcserifgothic-family.html?subviewmode=FONTS&samplestr=Rhythm+Computer+
    d+TR+8+6+0|Serif Gothic Bold]] is closer than I thought now that I can see more
    examples of the Roland font. However it looks as if they've taken the bold weight
    & lightened it slightly, so it doesn't have the separation in letters like R &
    B that the lighter weights have. d, a & p have that slightly awkward \"elbow\".
    The e & that lovely z could be unique features of the customisation. Something
    doesn't look quite right about Serif Gothic's e.\r\n\r\nThere is something similar
    used by the ibuprofen brand Nurofen, although this uses a different capital E
    to the Serif Gothic one.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NurofenLiquidCaps30_4148.jpg]\r\n\r\n<cite>PS..

    few years ago & I'm trying to get back into that side of things."

    for that Jan. I've just dug out a 1989 Letraset catalogue & indeed it has both
    a rectangular & round \"E\". Not only that, it also has the slanted \"e\" used
    by Roland and that swashy \"z\"!!!\r\n\r\nAlso two versions of \"a\", \"f\", \"k\",
    \"r\", \"s\", \"t\" & \"L\".\r\n\r\nWhat a shame they aren't in the digital versions!"
