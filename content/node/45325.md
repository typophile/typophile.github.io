  be nice to hear what the community thinks of it, since it is a type based logo.
  The font that the main logo type is based on is Bliss Pro Bold and the sub is PF
  Agora Slab Serif Thin Italic. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Ny_logo_risto_3566.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Ny_logo_4116.jpg]"

    'y' in tighter to get around that. The sub looks a little light too.\r\n\r\nI
    can't really make out the symbol in red.\r\n\r\nThat said, it has a nice feel
    about it for an Italian restaurant.\r\n\r\nRoss"

  body: "Looks like a airline logo to me, I am not sure about the red symbol on the
    bottom right, because the stroke seems to be a little too light, I am afraid the
    red symbol will not be visible enough if it is use on small print.\r\n\r\nI like
    the use of the colors.\r\n\r\nChriswong"

  body: "lowering the cross-bar of the 't' is what first struck me as a break in the
    visual ... then (as mentioned above) the tail of the 'l'.\r\n\r\nThe the 'E'.
    I can see what you've tried to do ... keep some flow to the strokes etc, but keeping
    them in their original rigid form isn't doing the mark any favours.\r\n\r\nIt
    could do with a little more Italian too me thinks.\r\n\r\n... my thoughts.\r\n<br

  body: "Thanks for the replies guys. \r\n\r\nIt\xB4s nice to get a second opinion
    on this since I\xB4m working on my own. Should have done it in the first place:-).
    Since I more or less produce all the material for this restaurant, I have the
    power to implement small changes. The website is done by someone else and came
    out pretty lame, and totally different from my sketches....\r\n\r\nI agree to
    the critique about the tail of the \"l\", there\xB4s something not quite working
    between the l and y. I would have to look for a solution and make a soft implementaion.\r\n\r\nI
    went for some totally different and more \"Italian\" logos in the pitch for this
    job, but the customer chose the last sketch from a folder of sketches I just wanted
    to show them, where the logo could go in a more straight and modern direction.
    I\xB4we actually grown fond of this logo after working with it for a while. \r\n\r\nThe
    little red symbol is actually working quite nice in small print. But I also use
    a version where I make the line a bit thicker both for the sub and the symbol.
    It depends on which kind of print it is, offset, digital etc... But since the
    red is 0,100,100,0 there are no rasterpoints, so it gets sharp.\r\n\r\nI have
    also a tree witch is used in different versions together with the logo. This gives
    the whole picture a more human feel and not so \"airplane\": \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Ny_logo_tre_4818.jpg]\r\n\r\nPS:
    I\xB4ll give you some insight to the menus and other material when I get time."

  body: Is the red thing part of the logo, or more of a TM type of thing? If it's
    part of the logo, it's way too small.

    symbol inside the circle is quintessence. Here is a link to an [[http://www.symbols.com/encyclopedia/54/543.html|explination]].
    And I thought that was suitable for Italian food and wine :-)\r\n\r\n[[http://ernst.foyn.googlepages.com/Middagsmeny_16mai.pdf|Here\xB4s

    then anything else.

  body: What type of tree is that behind the logo? does the tree has specific meaning
    to the restaurant? But, it looks cool. I still think that the stroke of the red
    symbol is a little bit to thin, u might wanna increase the stroke a little, just
    a suggestion.

  body: "having the 'a' take a little nibble out of the 'E' is genius, I'm a big fan
    of that (like the little bite out of the Apple computer apple, and the little
    notch missing from the Microsoft logo.\r\n\r\nIt looks very well resolved, but
    the one little thing that feels awkward to me, is the middle-bar in the 'E'.  It's
    too far away from the 'a' to be angled, and it doesn't touch like the 't' and
    the 'a'.  I think you should make it straight, despite the typeface."

  body: "Thank\xB4s again for all the feedback. I think I should have had some time
    to use on this forum before I finished the job ;-). The logo is now implemented
    on menus, business cards, baloons, walls, 30meter banners, Adds etc etc. I was
    just down at the restaurant and had a nice lunch, the food tastes great and the
    interior and the profile works very well together.\r\n\r\nBut like I said, I\xB4m
    in the position to make small changes, so I will keep all the feedback in mind.

  body: "I feel the crossbar on the 'E' is odd being cut at that angle. It seems to
    fight against the rest of it. I would straighten it and move it in to the 'a'
    a bit.\r\n\r\nAs above, I agree the tail on the 'L' looks a bit forced. I would
    move them close still."
