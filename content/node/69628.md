body: "A technical question on type anatomy: \r\nWhat do you think the gap on any
  open counter is called. \r\n\r\nFor example, on a lowercase 'n', this would be the
  space between the interior facing serifs, or on the sanserif the interior-facing
  side of each vertical stroke. \r\n\r\nIs this space called a 'gap' on an open counter,
  or is it an 'aperture' (such as found on a lowercase two story 'a'), or is it something
  entirely different? I have attached two images for reference.\r\n\r\nYes, this is
  a question of semantics, but, I haven't found a definitive (or more authoritative)
  answer to settle what that thing is called. Thoughts?\r\n\r\nthanks in advance.\r\n\r\n--jdf"

  body: '"Aperture" sounds right when specifically leading into an interior area.
    A "gap" is more general; for instance, the gap in the center of the broken vertical
    bar would not be an aperture.'

  body: 'In general I call them open counter forms. In metal type those are forms
    that are carved rather than filed to form. Of aperture, I think it''s like that
    on a camera: how much does it open. So it does not work with forms like ''n'':/|\.'
