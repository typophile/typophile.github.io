  we need a dot matrix font that will support all of the languages/regions that the
  game will ship to.  I've been having absolutely no luck combing the web for unicode
  fonts, so any help would be highly appreciated!\r\n\r\nAlmost any dot matrix font
  will do, something similar to this would be great:  http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/baseline/80s_pxl_regular/\r\n\r\nThe
  big issue is that we need a single font that will support the following languages:\r\n\r\nFrench\r\nGerman\r\nItalian\r\nSpanish\r\nDutch\r\nDanish\r\nNorwegian\r\nSwedish\r\nFinnish\r\nCzech\r\nPolish\r\nHungarian\r\nRussian\r\n\r\nThe
  font does not need to be free.  We just need to find one!\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\n-Matthew

  body: "I think the Russian support may be the hard bit here ... you would probably
    have to get it custom made. You could start with a font that already supports
    the listed western European languages, like <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_dot_matrix_ot/\">Dot
    Matrix OT</a> and contact FontShop if they can add Cyrillic for you. (The additional
    letters needed for Czech, Polish and Hungarian aren't too much work because they
    just have diacritic marks added to some of the existing latin letters.)\r\n\r\nJens"
