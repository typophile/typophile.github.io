body: "Hello again\r\nWhen I import an .afm into a Multiple Master i Fontlab 5, and
  select to just replace the kerning, then only some of the kerning is imported. I\u2019m
  using kerning classes and they have been set up in the MM, but some of the pairs
  don\u2019t work in the metrics(kerning) window. When I try to change the kerning
  for the pair then it won\u2019t do it as a class kern. I can\u2019t figure it out
  - help!"

    do you mean with this?\r\n\r\nFirst, make sure the kerning classe's checkboxes
    are marked, and the key glyph is marked.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FL_classes_panel_4997.png]\r\n\r\nSecond,
    make sure the Metrics window is in 'Class kerning' mode.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FL_metrics_clkern_6101.png]"

  body: "I mean that /some/ of the kerning pairs that should be shown automatically
    don't. I have checked and double checked that the characters are contained in
    the classes, but only some of the pairs show the kerning. For some reason I can't
    upload images now, but one example is between the classes \"T_both\" and \"c_left\"
    (which would be 'c_right' in your nomen):\r\n\r\n_T_both: T' Tcaron Tcommaaccent

    these classes Tc, Td, Tq work, but not To and Te. If I cmd+click on the little
    square underneath the e Fontlab knows to replace it with c... Suggestions?"

  body: "Yes it should look exactly like that here, and I just found a way to fix
    it inspired by your screen-grab of your metrics window. When I turned on the sidebar,
    I can mark the offending pairs and press delete - and voila - it's fixed.\r\n\r\n\xA1Thank
    your very much for helping me Miguel! "

  body: That offending pairs were listed in the sidebar suggests that you have defined
    exception values for them which means they are treated differently than the rest
    of the class.

  body: The funny thing is that I hadn't. The kerning was imported directly from another
    font that didn't have that error. There must have been some reason those 0-values
    popped up, but I haven't found it yet. The thing that was driving me nuts, was
    that when I choose to delete the pair in the right-click-menu for the offending
    pairs, nothing happened (as it should).

    have that error.</cite>\r\n\r\nSo the source font seems to have contained such
    a pair (you could search the .afm for it).\r\nThing is, if you import kerning
    for one master, FLS will automatically create a kerning pair for the other masters
    too,* and if no values have been defined for the other masters yet, these will
    be set to zero.\r\n(At the same time this means, if you generate instances of
    this font later, you should remove all zero values since they will unnecessarily
    increase the size of the font. Or at least check the kern feature if FLS has removed
    them automatically -- I am not sure if it does.)\r\n\r\n* More exact, technically:
    There is only one kerning pair for a given glyph pair, and in case of a MM-font,
    the kerning value for this pair is a list of kerning values, one value per each
    master."

    re-imported the .afm's several times replacing everything (all metrics) or just
    the kerning, but that didn't help either."
