    yor hand if you would try to trademark the name for yourself then, too. If you
    name your font after a name someone else had alrady trademarked, they could sue
    you for the earnings you make using their registered trademark. How's that?

    :-(\r\n\r\nLike every lawsuit, that would be up to a judge (and jury?) to decide.
    But they could try, and if they try, it might cost you. The trademark holder probably
    won't care about your font, just that you are generating income with their property.\r\n\r\n>That\u2019s
    no good. So I assume people like Solotype and H&FJ\r\n>had checked the trademarks.
    How do I do that myself?\r\n\r\nHow do you know that? I don't know that. The best
    thing to do is ask. If you want to register a trademark, you should have a lawyer
    do research for you to see if the name is in fact trademark-able.\r\n\r\n>More
    questions:\r\n>1) If the previous one does not have a trademark, isn\u2019t\r\n>there
    something equivalent to \u201Cprevious art\u201D in copyright\r\n>whereby it\u2019s
    no longer possible to obtain a trademark on it?\r\n\r\nDon't know. If no one has
    a trademark on the name, you can apply for one. If the others don't want you to
    have it, it is up to them to file an objection with the authorities during a certain
    application period.\r\n\r\nIn terms of copyright and design patents, those are
    not names, and are not things that fall under trademarks, which is waht I thought
    you were asking about. Protection for design copyrights and or patents differs
    depending on where you are. If I were you, I would ask the other other designers,
    rather than ask for legal advice. Solotype and H&FJ are just a phone call away,
    right?\r\n\r\n>2) When do trademarks expire?\r\n\r\nNever? ;-)\r\nCopyright is
    good for life of the author (or company), plus 70 years. At least in the US, I
    believe. Whether TMs another matter are?\r\n\r\n>3) If I do trademark it, what
    can I do about the pre-existing one?\r\n\r\nSee what I wrote above. Your trademark
    application can be contested for a certain period of time."

  body: "I know a few of these, not a lawyer, yada yada, but I've been researching
    this a long time...\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst, DA has the most correct answer.\r\n\r\nTrademarks
    don't expire. But they only last as long as someone is using them, and trying
    to protect them. They may become genericized, and then anyone can use them, like
    \"aspirin\" in the U.S.\r\n\r\nThe basic concept of a trademark isn't at all like
    a copyright. A copy write says you made (or acquired) something creative and have
    the final say on reproduction. A trademark claims only that you have a product
    with a label and it is so intrinsically entwined with the product's value that
    others using that name might benefit from your reputation, via that label.\r\n\r\nKeep
    in mind neither you, Solo or Image have to have registered the Trademark to get
    benefits from it, that just makes things easier in litigation.\r\n\r\nIf two parties
    are using a name to sell two different (unrelated) fonts <em>at the same time</em>,
    either one would have a poor claim that the name is linked in the markets mind
    to only their face. Especially if neither is stopping the other. (Unless they
    are pursuing different markets.) However, the same applies to you, as well, if
    there are already others using that name, unregistered, good luck getting a judge
    to give you real trademark power, even if the local PTO had taken your money and
    given you a certificate. Keep in mind, to maintain that Trademark, you will have
    to be  a hawk on the butt of anyone using it, as well.\r\n\r\nOthers, feel free
    to correct this.\r\n----\r\n\r\nOn the other half of the question, If you want
    a sans and serif with different names are they at least phonetically or thematically
    related? I have two projects in the cooker using that idea, a sans/serif pair
    and a text/display pair.\r\n\r\nI also feel that if they are a \"close pairing\"
    they should have more similar names. If they share little more than metrics, then
    a weak link seems right.\r\n\r\nWeren't Myriad/Minion were designed to compliment
    each other? Similar but subtle."

    think they are that closely related; I would rather use, um, something else with
    Minion rather than Myriad. Myriad was originally a showpiece for Multiple Master
    technology, and was highly engineered to give smooth results across a wide range
    of width and weight. We just don't see many width variations of it any more. "

    much harder to get the name you want because so many are taken. You could re-spell
