  knows information about him of what tools he used to make his type. Also, more about
  his life for instance if he had children and other things. I've found a couple pages
  of info, but I feel like i'm missing a lot of data.\r\n\r\n\r\nthank you"

    good things about Alessandro Segalini's <a href=http://www.typeculture.com/academic_resource/articles_essays/pdfs/tc_article_42.pdf>timeline</a>
    of Bodoni.

  body: "<em>Typographic Milestones</em> by Allan Haley has a good article on Bodoni
    and his background. He was married, but I don't recall if he had children or not.
    \r\n\r\nU&lc also had a Bodoni issue when they released the ITC Bodoni, and the
    out of print FMR magazine had an article on the Bodoni museum in Parma including
    pics of his punches and tools. I believe it was just files and gravers like most
    type cutters of the time.\r\n\r\nGeorge \r\nI felt bad because I had no shoes,
    until I met a man who had no Bodoni"

    others to do the work for them, but simple suggestions are a polite way to say
    the same thing.\r\n"

  body: Yeah, Wikipedia has 141 words on Bodoni. Should be no problem fleshing that
    out into a 20 page essay. (And since the original post was in May, I suspect that
    the user has finished the paper).

    Lawson\u2019s <cite>Anatomy of a Typeface</cite> or Updike\u2019s <cite>Printing
    Types</cite> have informations on Bodoni. Some of them are listed <a href=\"http://typophile.com/books/typedesign-history\">here
    on Typophile</a>, I would recommend to check with your school library if they
    have any available. \r\n\r\nThere\u2019s also a great deal of information available
    on the man, depending how deep you want to go in your research. Unfortunately
    most of what I\u2019ve found so far is available only in Italian (but that\u2019s
    an advantage for me since that\u2019s my first language!). For example, <a href=\"http://www.aiap.it/libreria.php?ID=335\">issue
    #9 of <cite>Progetto Grafico</cite></a>, one of Italy\u2019s leading graphic design
    journals, has a substantial section about Bodoni\u2019s types and derivative works."

    If you can its a great experience to visit the Bodoni Museum in Parma italy. You
    will have to ring to make an appointment and when I went in February last year
    it was freezing cold as the heating was off. I had the chance to hold Bodoni''s
    punches in my hand (as there were only two of us visiting) and they looked as
    if they had been cut yesterday. '

  body: "Frederick Goudy's book refers to Bodoni and his students (apparently, he
    had a famous school of type design), and their involvement in the creation of
    type used to ptoduce the classic Jewish books.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, the design
    of the Romm family typeface designs, based upon ancient Sephardic drawings resembled
    Bodono's unique design style making one wonder who influenced who?"
