  to getting to know my way around the site and I hope i will get to know some of
  you soon. \r\n\r\nI suppose I will introduce myself.\r\nMy name is Cody, I am 20
  years old and I am a design student at Collins College in Tempe. I am not a great
  typographer or a great designer yet, but I am getting better, so if you have any
  critique don't hesitate to say it. :)\r\n\r\nOther than that I'm not quite sure
  what to say, other than that I look forward to getting to getting to know you guys."

    \"insert image\" link below the comment box. JPEG or PNG. With PNG you can post
    layered images with no background that \"show\" the grey typophile background.

    see that Typophile has such a nice population. Everyone here seems very courteous
    and willing to help each other. \r\nPerhaps soon I will ask for critique and advice
    on a few of my designs and try to help others when I can. \r\nThis seems like
    a very nice site and I think I will like it here.\r\n\r\nThank you all again for
    the welcome and the advice, I will be sure to make use of it.  "

    us don't let that translate to a deceptive silence. In any case, nobody here engages
    in cloying, Flickr-style \"Great color and composition! I so LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE
    IT!!!!\" crap, which is incredibly refreshing.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
