body: "Looking for a headline typeface for a fashion brand (ladies clothing) for adverts,
  website slides etc.\r\nThe brand is edgy and experimental and needs something different
  to the usual didone and sans serif styles.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking something like Rihanna's
  style:\r\n[[http://ghettobabydesigns.blogspot.co.uk/2013/02/rihanna-unapologetic.html|Rihanna1]]\r\n[[http://toyaz-world.net/wp-content/uploads/albums/w102/toyablogger28/rihanna-complex07.jpg|Rihanna2]]\r\n\r\nI'd
  love to get some lettering commissioned but unfortunately can't do that so hoping
  someone knows of a decent font like this, preferably with a few alternates so it
  looks more hand done.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has any ideas for something like this, or
  any other ideas for a typeface. \r\nHas to be edgy and Audacious!\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nJoe"

  body: "I take your point there certainly not over feminine, although I think certain
    letterforms give it a feminine feel.\r\n\r\nI love  your suggestion. Definitely
    has the right personality\r\nIt is formal and will require a lot of breathing
    space (I think) to work but I'll definitely try it out.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nJoe"
