  body: "Is this for text or display?\r\n\r\nAnd, should it be rather masculine or
    feminine?\r\n\r\n(BTW, I agree it's going to be hard within the free segment;
    is that an absolute requirement?)"

  body: "I just did a headline that had the word \"girlfight\" in it and I used Cracked.
    At first I wasn't a huge fan, but once I turned it pink and put it on a black
    background I was sold. \r\n\r\nYou could also try sandals or Mr. Wade."
