  body: 'Rui, is there a better way to view it than other than the tester at T-26?
    Overall it is nice. It reminds me of a few different typefaces, but some of the
    subtle nuances in the italic separate it. There are a few shapes which I would
    be tempted to correct, but overall it is a really nice sans. '

  body: Rui, click on 'edit' which should be in the black bar just above your first
    post. Once inside, scroll down a bit and you should see "Attach new file:". Try
    that.
