  <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/33869\">this thread on the Greek ductus</a>
  a couple of weeks ago, and was inspired to sit down and draw letters to test out
  my idea of what a Greek text face could look like. I'm building it into a typeface
  I'm calling Naxia, and I would like your criticism, comments, and suggestions.\r\n\r\nI
  wanted to recreate the rhythm of the classic Greek typefaces like Didot's with a
  modern edge. The lowercase letters are slightly inclined, but close enough to being
  upright to harmonize with the uppercase letters and to differentiate them from the
  not-yet-presentable italic. The letterforms are based on my handwriting, and alternate
  forms are provided for certain characters.\r\n\r\nThere is no real underlying logic
  in the patterns of stress other than doing what seems natural for each individual
  letter to serve the rhythm as a whole. The angles of stress are all over the place.
  I sliced off the ends of thicker strokes to create sharp angles rather than the
  rounded terminals seen in similar designs. This becomes a design feature that adds
  a subtle sparkle to the page.\r\n\r\nLacking nativity in Greek, I have no idea how
  much of this works if at all for native Hellenophones. So I would really appreciate
  help from Greeks especially. How acceptable would this attempt be? Could this work
  as a serious text face?\r\n\r\nAs for the Latin alphabet which was added afterwards,
  it's quite close to some of my previous unpublished designs, but it also takes some
  subtle design cues from the Greek. I haven't really spent enough time on the uppercase
  letters for both alphabets, so there's some stroke width issues going on among other
  things. Not to mention that all the spacing is preliminary and there is no kerning
  yet.\r\n\r\nIn short: long, long ways to go. Comments, please!"

    looks pretty decent to my eyes, but i'm no expert in Greek. One question though,
    why did you choose a form of eta that does not descend as the default? just curious
    as to your rationale behind this choice."

    my own favorite Greek font, Apollonia.  :-)\r\nBut I do think the descending eta
    is better.\r\n\r\nBrian, my only worry (caveat: as a non-native) is that the stroke
    contrast texture is too jumpy; and that it's less jumpy than the Latin's (even
    factoring in Greek's larger tolerance for that). Maintaining the \"atmosphere\"
    in a multi-script system is very important, since the fonts should ideally be
    useful <cite>in the same way</cite>.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "The Greek lowercase already looks jumpy enough to my eyes, but for a different
    reason than the innate character of Greek script--incline angle inconsistency.
    I think I'll concentrate on tempering it somewhat by maintaining the same minute
    optical incline throughout.\r\n\r\nAs for the non-descending eta, that's the form
    I prefer in my own handwriting. That goes for all the lowercase Greek forms I
    chose as defaults (it would be silly to extend that to the capitals, e.g. the
    Omega which I usually write as an O with an underline). \r\n\r\nThe enlargement
    of the alpha of Apollonia Hrant posted on the Greek ductus thread was indeed fresh
    on my mind when I drew my alpha. But I had not noticed the non-descending eta
    in the small sample of Apollonia on the Cannibal website (eta occurs just once
    there). I see now that the etas are more prominent in the Apollonia Polytonic
    sample, which I had missed before.\r\n\r\nThe non-descending eta in Apollonia
    doesn't surprise me, as it is common in contemporary Greek designs, as one can
    easily check browsing through the Cannibal website's samples.\r\n\r\nAs for why
    <em>I</em> personally use the non-descending eta... I don't know. My Greek hand
    was strongly influenced by the handwritten Greek I was exposed to when my family
    lived in Greece, and most of those had non-descending etas, as did a lot of typefaces
    I saw in use around me.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, subconsciously, the eta with a descender
    bothers me because none of the other vowels have descenders. Then again, a descender
    might help to differentiate it from pi in some handwriting... Well, if I ever
    finish and release this a couple of years down the line, then I'll decide which
    form of eta to put as the default.\r\n\r\n<em>If that\u2019s the first time you\u2019ve
    drawn Greek letters, it\u2019s very impressive!</em>\r\n\r\nThanks, Thomas. It
    means a lot coming from someone who has designed the beautiful Greek of Hypatia
    Sans. But I've drawn Greek letters before, though this is the first I've put up
    for critique. One set of Greek letters I've drawn would surely draw Hrant's wrath
    for its latinized forms. :)"

  body: "Good choice of specimen text, Brian. '\u0399\u03B8\u03AC\u03BA\u03B7' is
    one of my favourite poems. I don't know the Dalven translation, though, only the
    classic Keeley & Sherrard. But setting it as monotonic is cheating. :)\r\n\r\nThere
    are some lovely shapes in Naxia, but I think you have too much going on in the
    Greek: too many flairs and bent strokes, going in all sorts of directions, and
    this -- combined with the variable ductus -- is what is making the text jumpy.
    The individual letters have beautiful features, but they are not setting well
    together. I think you are going to need to rein the design in considerably. The
    good news is that it is easier to rein in an overly fanciful design than it is
    to inject life into a dull one.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule of thumb, I'd say that
    the more inconsistent the ductus, the more tightly constrained other elements
    of the design need to be, because that basic inconsistency is already pulling
    at the texture of the text, threatening to unravel it. If you regularise the ductus,
    then you can afford more elaboration in other areas, which is how something as
    amazingly elaborate as a page of Garamond or Granjon's heavily ligatured text
    holds together so well: the traditional Byzantine ductus provides a consistent
    foundation for the fanciful forms.\r\n\r\nSome specific comments:\r\n\r\nThe upper
    left portion in the rho, sigma and final sigma is weak, and causes the letters
    to fall to the right. This is particularly bad in the sigma. This is a very common
    problem when one first starts making Greek letters. This area needs to be pushed
    out more.\r\n\r\nThe top of the final sigma is too long and too straight: it is
    confusable with the stigma ligature.\r\n\r\nThe bowl of the uppercase Phi should
    be wider but shorter, i.e. there should be more stem above and below the bowl,
    and compensation in the width to keep the counters nicely open and balanced.\r\n\r\nIf
    you make the part of the uppercase psi that crosses the vertical stem squarer,
    you can open the counters a bit more. At the moment, this letter looks a bit cramped.\r\n\r\nYour
    uppercase tonos accents are too close to the letters. They need a bit more room
    to breathe."

  body: "Thanks for your detailed comments, John. I have made some adjustments since
    I posted this and started work on an italic, with a more regular ductus, but I
    haven't done any work on this for the last few weeks as I have entered a busy
    stretch at work.\r\n\r\nI think I'm going to make Naxia regular more upright to
    set it apart from the italic more, making the adjustments John suggested in the
    lowercase rho, sigma, and final sigma (good point about the final sigma being
    confusable with the stigma). I will also open up the counters more. I see John's
    point about reining in the design. I had some fun exploring the idea of 'What
    if Greek mimicked the look of being written with the sharpness of broad nibbed
    pens, only crazier with more flair?', but yes, the letters need to work together
    more. \r\n\r\nI am quite dissatisfied with the uppercase I have so far. I'm not
    sure they fit really well with either the lowercase Greek or the Latin. They feel
    perhaps too narrow overall. And maybe I should make at least the Greek capitals
    lighter.\r\n\r\nI hope to get back to work on this soon. In the meantime, for
    the rest of the typophiles, are there any comments and suggestions about the Latin
    portion of Naxia?"

    Roman's slant is gentle, so a typical italic won't have any problem standing out.
    Plus keeping the slant in the Regular is a nice way of differentiating from the
    Latin.\r\n\r\n> I\u2019m not sure they fit really well with\r\n> either the lowercase
    Greek or the Latin.\r\n\r\nWell there's a severe limit to how much formal harmony
    the UC and lc can have. If you force it too much one or the other case stops working.\r\n\r\n>
    comments and suggestions about the Latin portion of Naxia?\r\n\r\nThe difficulty
    is that intelligent comments would have to take the Greek into account. My own
    lack of expertise in Greek means I can only comment reliably on the Latin out
    of that context... but here goes:\r\n\r\nThe descenders are a bit too long for
    a text face.\r\n\r\nThe \"e\", \"g\" and \"x\" could be a hair wider.\r\n\r\nThe
    \"v\", \"w\" and \"x\" could used more activity.\r\n\r\nYour spacing is too loose
    for the ideal target size\r\nindicated by the vertical proportions and color.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Brian, I don't think you need to make the Greek much more regularly upright,
    at least not so far as vertical strokes are concerned. As Hrant notes, the slant
    is very gentle, and will be more reduced once you modifiy the rho, sigma and final
    sigma, and probably straighten the leg of the mu somewhat (it certainly shouldn't
    slant outward more than the descender of the gamma, and often curls inward following
    more the descender of the rho). Most of the apparent slant comes from misapplied
    weight, rather than from the actual slope of verticals. The raised left side of
    the pi and tau, for instance, contribute more to the apparent slant than the angle
    of the legs.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in experiments writing Greek with a
    broadnib pen, including a variety of approaches to ductus, try to find a copy
    of Epictetus' stoic aphorisms published as <em>Virtue and Happiness</em> by Shambala.
    The Greek texts are expressively written by Claude Mediavilla. I don't always
    agree with his choice for individual letters, and I'm not sure, overall, that
    the calligraphy reflects the meaning of the texts, which are pretty sober. But
    it is worth taking a look at, and there's a lot of beauty in it."
