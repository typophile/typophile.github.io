  body: Looks like someone just typed an underscore over the q.

  body: I don't think so, Chris. The bar is too narrow and too carefully balanced
    on the stem to be an underscore.

  body: "I can't say I've seen it in a typeface, but that's the standard handwritten
    'q' here in Norway, and I guess the other Nordic countries too. \r\n\r\nEdit:
    Or at least that's how we learnt to write 'q's in the 70s. No idea if it's still
    taught like that."

  body: Some people do this in handwriting because it helps differentiate q from g.
    Scroll through a MyFonts search for "casual script" and see how many you can spot.
    Look also for the variant where the crossing stroke leads up to start the u.

    really hard to believe the \"designers\" would have taken the time to do something
    like that.\r\n\r\nAnybody know when this first appeared?  Any scribal instances
    of it?"

  body: I've written lowercase <strong>q</strong> with a crossed descender since I
    was in college, and that's a long damn time. I can't remember anyone teaching
    me to make <strong>q</strong>'s that way, but I surely didn't invent it. I either
    saw it printed that way, or saw it in someone else's handwriting. I picked up
    the habit of crossing my <strong>7</strong>'s (considered an affectation here
    in the US) from a friend of mine around the same time, and maybe he crossed his
    <strong>q</strong>'s too.

  body: It's very standard in written Spanish (Spain, at least) to cross the q in
    handwriting, though it drives my (American) students crazy.  It was used in printing
    as an abbreviation for cuan or cual at one point but that was several centuries
    ago.
