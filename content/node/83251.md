  was designed by <strong>Gerard Unger</strong> in 1998 at the request of the Agenzia
  romana per la preparatione del Giubileo for the Jubilee of the Roman Catholic Church
  in 2000. This type design was the central part of the project for a wayfinding and
  information system to guide pilgrims and tourists through Rome. Capitolium also
  continues Rome\u2019s almost uninterrupted two-thousand-year-old tradition of public
  lettering . It is a modern typeface for the twenty-first century and strongly related
  to the traditions of Rome.\r\nSoon after the completion of this project Unger began
  contemplating the possibility of bringing the atmosphere of this design to newspapers.
  Though Capitolium works well in most modern production processes and also on screens,
  it is too fragile for newsprint. For newspapers sturdier shapes were required as
  well as more characters to a line of text, and Capitolium News has a bigger x-height
  than Capitolium. Capitolium News is a thoroughly modern newsface, with classic letterforms
  linked to a strong tradition.\r\nCapitolium News for running text comes in the variations
  regular, italic, semibold, semibold italic, bold and bold italic.As is possible
  with most of Unger\u2019s type designs, Capitolium News can be condensed and expanded
  without any harm to the letterforms.\r\nThe update to this beautiful font family,
  Capitolium News, includes the addition of over 250 glyphs featuring full Latin A
  language support, new ligatures, 4 sets of numerals, arbitrary fractions and superiors/inferiors.
  Furthermore, kerning was added and fine tuned for better performance.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.type-together.com/Capitolium%20News%202|more
