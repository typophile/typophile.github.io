  know what I mean\u2014that soft odor of luxury and petroleum that comes out of every
  single book printed in Belgium, most of the books from France, Italy, and Japan,
  and not a damned thing printed in the USA. Is it the inks, the paper, the glue,
  or just some tangible residue of the dedication of insanely dedicated pressmen?"

  body: Expensive Printing Smell. This is a spray on product manufactured in Japan
    and, under license, in Germany, by the same people who invented New Car Smell.
    The US imposes heavy tariffs on products whose only purpose is to produce an odour,
    which is why a lot of European perfumes are also not available in the USA or are
    very expensive. I believe this is due to the Hollywood lobby, which wants Americans
    only to purchase perfumes 'designed' by American celebrities. Unfortunately, Expensive
    Printing Smell got caught in the same classification. American used car dealers
    use a knock off of New Car Smell, but no one in the USA has succeeded in replicating
    the scent of the highly secret ingredients in Expensive Printing Smell, although
    some vegetable based inks have been found to have powerful if often unpleasant
    odours.

    there's something almost intoxicating about it.  ;-)

  body: "My printer offers an \"old money\" and \"new money\" scent. In the old money
    case they actually rub each piece of paper on the forehead of a bald, grumpy rich
    guy. For the new money scent they drive over each ream of paper in a black 2007
    Audi A8 L W12. \r\n\r\nFor the ultra cool, \"designer scent\" they leave an iPhone
    next to the paper - unfortunately they charge $90 a month and you have to sign
    a two year contract.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I might get off topic there, but we have a chain of shops in France called
    \"Nature et decouvertes\", some kind of new age-discovery channel stuff, and in
    there you can actually buy ambiance perfumes with names such as \"breakfast under
    the tree in autumn\" or \"a visit to grandma's countryhouse\"... I'm regularly
    buying the one called \"nature after the rain\" and it is quite amazing: it really
    does reminds a whole lot of things, from hours walking in some normandy fields
    right after a shower. Odour is an extremely powerful memories safekeeper.\r\n\r\ndr"

  body: "Paper quality is also quite important. Cheap paper stinks. But in most cases
    publishers are not willing to charge 5-10% more for a book that is printed on
    good (or at least decent) quality paper. \r\n\r\nKlaus Wagenbach, a publisher
    who has founded the Wagenbach Verlag in Germany, was famous for tasting the paper
    before printing his books on it. Wagenbach books are arguably the nicest books
    produced in Germany - and yes, these books are a bit more expensive than the average
    books, but it\u2019s a pleasure to read them."
