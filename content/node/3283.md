  a client asked me to make a bitmap version of a font that they use -- and this is
  what I came up with. It&#39;s my first stab at this sort of thing! Any thoughts
  on how I can make it better? <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve done this in photoshop only. What
  is the best way to turn it into a working macintosh font? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/cgibin/board-post.pl?action=posting_upload_form&what=show&img=27126"

    &#40;for now&#41;, since our ability to figure that out might be a good measure
    of the ethicality &#40;?&#41; of it. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    <BR>I tried again. <BR> <BR>Brace yourself -- things are getting ugly. &#40;B,
    M, N, Y, Q&#41; <BR> <BR>If anyone has a suggestion of something similar and sleeker,
    I&#39;d be ecstatic.

  body: Trixie, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not nearly as practiced as many of the regulars on
    typohile in regards to the strict discipline of type design. I do, however, put
    a lot of time into developing pixel fonts. <BR> <BR>The set you are developing
    is difficult because of the serifs, in my opinion. The pixel grid at that size
    doesn&#39;t leave you much room to experiment with. <BR> <BR>I think the vertical
    and horizontal elements of the characters need to be more uniform. This may not
    turn out to be an exact replica of the font you are emulating. However, as a pixel
    font and not a postscript one, I think the set as a whole will be more elegant.
    <BR> <BR>Perhaps all you need to do is make each character two pixels taller.
    Readjust your curves and diagonals, and then the serifs won&#39;t make some characters
    look so much heavier than others. <BR> <BR>Again, I&#39;m not very comfortable
    advising others. This is just what I would try. If it doesn&#39;t work, no harm
    done.

  body: 'First of all: I can&#39;t tell what font this is based on - there&#39;s a
    lot of stuff like this - so don&#39;t worry about being kosher or halal or anything
    else. <BR> <BR>I think your biggest problem is weight differences, like between
    the &#34;K&#34; and the &#34;X&#34;. This is not easy to fix in an elegant manner
    - but you can fool with removing/adding pixels in &#34;unexpected&#34; places
    to make the glyphs more equal in weight. <BR> <BR>BTW, this thing is screaming
    to be in grayscale. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'
