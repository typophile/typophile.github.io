  body: "Can you supply any other information?\r\n\r\nHow wide are your margins? Are
    they uniform (left and right, top and bottom)? It looks to be about 20 columns
    for the spread and the crosses are likely 80mm wide (240/3), which are likely
    used to setup the horizontal crossing lines of the grid.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis might
    also help: http://www.markboulton.co.uk/journal/comments/five-simple-steps-to-designing-grid-systems-part-2\r\n\r\nAnd
    here are some templates that could be useful: http://www.thegridsystem.org/categories/templates/\r\n\r\n "

  body: "hi andrew, thanx for the reply\r\n\r\ni didnt design the grid. I'm working
    on a cd cover + inside booklet for a client and they sent me a pdf of their guidelines
    and templates. the image i attached here is a screenshot. There are no specific
    measurments which is why i am so confused as to how I am supposed to recreate
    this in indesign."

  body: "You might want to post the PDF (if it's not proprietary).\r\n\r\nMy take:
    I'd open the template and save it as a TIFF image and then set up a master page
    at the document size and just put the image in the master page as a background
    template. Then when you're done designing, delete the image on the master page.\r\n\r\nSimple
    work around. You can drag out your columns and margins to match the image so you
    have something to \"snap\" to. \r\n\r\nDoes that help any? "

    a photograph and there are no defined measurements etc. its all abit 'free' as
    they said. thank you for your help andrew, much appreciated.

    how I'd do it. \r\n\r\n> save it [PDF] as a TIFF \r\n\r\nOr you could just import
    the PDF. InDesign can place PDFs as images.\r\n\r\n(If the PDF is more than one
    page, make sure that the \"Show Import Options\" checkbox is checked in the \"Place\"
    dialog box, so you can select which page of the PDF to import.)\r\n\r\n"
