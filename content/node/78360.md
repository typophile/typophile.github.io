  it possible to hint TTF in a way that would make a glyph render 1 pixel wider (at
  certain pixel size) than its unhinted version?</em>\r\n\r\nThis is in the context
  of trying to reliably tell ClearType and Standard anti-aliasing apart in the confines
  of the HTML/CSS/JavaScript. \r\n\r\nI figured out how to do it in Firefox and Chrome.
  In the IE I can detect CT in some cases, but not always and this relies on using
  Flash, which makes it am untidy hack. Here's a <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/77635\">thread</a>
  where it all started.\r\n\r\nOne option that I'd like to explore is making a custom
  single-glyph TTF font and then hinting for ClearType so that the glyph would render
  with a different width depending on whether the CT is enabled. This difference can
  be detected by CSS and so I have my solution. \r\n\r\nI have very rudimentary undertsanding
  of hinting, and I am looking for a simple \"yes, possible\" / \"no, not possible\"
  guidance. If it <em>is</em> possible, I will look into the hinting subject at detail
  and figure things out.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n"

  body: "Yes, you could do this. Since CT effectively ignores X hints, you could use
    an X delta hint to change the width of a stem or glyph (not sure which one you're
    trying to do), and the delta hint would be ignored by the CT rasterizer. In fact
    this would work with any X-hint, but a delta is probably the easiest way for you
    to do this. \r\n\r\nFor that matter, there are delta hints which are rasterizer-dependent,
    at least for the Win Rasterizers. For example, you could apply a delta to move
    a point a certain distance, but only if the current rasterizer was using \"black
    and white\" rendering. \r\n\r\nJason C"

    (CT) instructions, and it really helps to know more specific areas to look at.
    What I was not sure about was if a glyph was pre-allocated a fixed space on the
    rasterization surface and if the hinting program was not allowed to push the glyph
    outside of such space. It sounds like it's not the case, which is great. Hence
    the next question :) -\r\n\r\nIs there a good starting place for learning more
    about hinting? I know general idea behind the hinting, but I come from the computer
    programming background, so some sort of condensed crash course on hinting would
    be ideal."

  body: Hang on, I don't think I was entirely clear on which width you're trying to
    manipulate. Do you mean the number of horizontal pixels used to fill the glyph,
    or the total number of pixels in the advance width of the glyph (including sidebearings)?
    The latter is more problematic, because ClearType in GDI typically renders glyphs
    using <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa480221.aspx#wp_topic6">"compatible
    widths"</a> that match the advance widths of black and white / grayscale rendering.
    While it's possible to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/cleartype/truetypecleartype.aspx#Toc227035734">query
    whether compatible widths or "natural widths" are being used</a> (and alter the
    hinting program accordingly), it's not possible to change the rendering mode from
    the within the font. So unless the GDI program has been set to use natural widths,
    the advance width of a ClearType-rendered glyph will always be the same as Standard
    smoothing.

    width mode, and the rasterizer is about to render a glyph. I am assuming that
    it allocates N pixels for the advance width of the glyph and - then what? - does
    it run the hinting program and then sort of squishes resulting curves into the
    allotted space? Does it have any threshold for how badly it can mangle the curves?
    \r\n\r\nOr more generally - can you think of any condition under which the rasterizer
    would change the advance width <em>after</em> the hinting program is run?"

    that's always the case, then it should be easy enough to hint a glyph in such
    a way that its advance width is one value with Standard smoothing (which follows
    x-direction hints), and a different value with ClearType (since it ignores those
    hints). Problem solved. Except that GDI apps default to using compatible widths,
    making the advance widths identical between Standard and CT rendering. Thus, if
    the advance width of the glyph is altered through hinting, that altered width
    does in fact get carried over to ClearType when rendered using compatible widths.\r\n\r\nIn
    any case, it's possible for a hinting program to query for ClearType rendering,
    and to query for compatible widths mode, and to limit the application of hints
    based on such conditions. That <em>may</em> provide enough flexibility to create
    a font that achieves the original goal, though not as easily as one might have
    hoped.\r\n"
