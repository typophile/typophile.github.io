body: I suppose the majority of fonts were never named after their creators.  But
  in the past, at least it seemed to happen (Frutiger, Gill Sans, Caslon, Lubalin).  Of
  course I'm not aware of every single font that's been released recently, but is
  it just not done to name a font you designed after yourself anymore?

    examples would be Hoefler Text and Carter Sans."

    <em>and</em> more effective idea: at least for your more\r\nserious work, use
    names that start with the letters of\r\nyour last name. In my case so far I've
    used Paphos and\r\nPatria. You could use Maelstrom, Mallard, Magus...\r\nOr you
    could leverage the cool \"horn\" in your name.\r\n\r\n* At least the more serious

    I was thinking more of a series with individual names (not a family), such as:\r\nMaelhorn
    Bevel\r\nMaelhorn Bold\r\nMaelhorn English Egyptian\r\nMaelhorn Piegnot\r\netc\r\n\r\nI
    just wondered how far I could take it before everyone in the world thought i had
    my head jammed right up my anus."

  body: "Ryan, that only makes sense if the series is\r\nhighly cohesive in some way.
    Otherwise it's\r\nbasically like prefixing your foundry name\r\non your fonts.\r\n\r\nThe
    Samuelson scheme is cool too - reminds\r\nme a bit of Montalbano's clever \"Yo\"
    series.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Well of course this would be an obvious and shameless attempt at self promotion.  Since
    my last name is so rare, if the name of the font happened to stick in someone's
    head, they may type the name into a search engine and pretty much all the results
    are me.  I couldnt do this of course if my last name was, Smith, say..

  body: "maybe many designers don't because they are usually designing for a client
    and so feel its inappropriate to name it after themselves? \r\n\r\ni think typefaces
    named after the designer give a different impression. To me they seem more sophisticated
    and elegant... i can't explain why though it's just a feeling i get. maybe it's
    because it reminds me more of the craftsmanship and tradition side of type design
    while typefaces like 'Metro' make me think of advertising and business...i get
    the same feeling from design studios named after the designer as opposed to studios
    with names like 'intro' or 'tomato'(both great studios)... something like Atelier
    'insert designers name' or Studio of 'insert designers name' conjures up images
    of a craftsman who knows what he's doing...or she's doing, anyway i'm going off
    topic now."
