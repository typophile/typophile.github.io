  a danish rockband called &#34;Dizzy Mizz Lizzy&#34; is called.  <BR> <BR><a href="http://members.macconnect.com/users/t/toroguro/images/dml.gif"

  body: The typeface is called Glorietta or Columbian, but it has been issued as &#39;Goodfellow&#39;
    by Scriptorium. P22 also has a version in their Victorian set.

  body: I think this was also used famously for the Nightmare Before Christmas logo.
    This version of Goodfellow was discussed in a typophile thread <a href="http://www.typophile.com/cgibin/discus.pl?pg=next&amp;topic=83&amp;page=15889"
    target="_blank">here</a>. Scriptorium&#39;s Goodfellow bears no relation to Solotype&#39;s
    <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/solotype/goodfellow/" target="_blank">Goodfellow</a>,
    which coincidently is discussed <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/49959.html?1096378563"
    target="_blank">here</a>.

  body: Well I actually suspected that it was that font &#40;which is known from &#34;The
    Smashing Pumpkins - Mellon Collie&#34; album too&#41; however if it is the one
    used, it must have been compressed in hight cause the Goodfellow font is very
    tall...
