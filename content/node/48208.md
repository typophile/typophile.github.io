    Medium weight. The Q is different, but the rest is too similar for coincidence,
    in my opinion. I do not know where to find \"Elsinore\", but it may be an 'adaptation'
    of Proteus.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Just looked at [[http://www.identifont.com/show?HBX|Elsinore]], and I think
    it has many more differences than the Q. It is not squared enough, is the main
    thing.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I think the resolution was poor (maybe after shrinking the graphic), but
    I notice that the Q looks like the right one for Proteus. I think the typeface
    is the same, but obviously the image isn't.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
