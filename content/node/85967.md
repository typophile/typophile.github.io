body: "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a san serif that with good hinting to load
  sharply and legibly at 8pt to 20pt on screen and has at least a regular, italic,
  bold and bold italic.\r\n\r\nI was thinking something like FR Hopper, but open to
  suggestions. I'm not sure how the hinting is on Hopper, but would be interested
  to know what you think.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nPaul"

  body: Thanks for the suggestions. I'm not too worried about price, because the company
    I work for will purchase it to embed it into their software. The application is
    a windows only program, so it will likely load on Windows XP, but will more likely
    be in Windows 7 and sometimes Vista.

    Edge (\"RE\") series</a> of webfonts were designed specifically for use at small
    sizes on screen. Personally, I'm partial to <a href=http://www.webtype.com/font/bentonsansre-family/>Benton
    Sans RE</a>, but any real suggestion for a specific family would depend a bit
    on the context in which it will be used.\r\n\r\n(Full disclosure: I am a Font
    Bureau employee, but have made use of the RE fonts in personal web projects, so
    can confidently comment on them from that point of view.)"

    to Monotype (Brian Kraimer or Steve Kuhlman), FSI, Peter Bilak and Dalton Maag.

    a data mining application where Antenna may be a good fit. I'll have to see how
    it loads on Windows machines."

    towards Antenna or Amplitude. Who at FontBureau would I get in touch with about
    the OEM licensing?"

  body: "Paul \u2014 Cool. More general info here: http://www.fontbureau.com/help/licensing/\r\n\r\nBut,
    as Si indicated (rather elliptically ;-), you can contact Harry directly to discuss
    OEM specifically. Add the fontbureau.com domain to the email prefix Si gave above.
    With proper agreements & assurances, you can probably also work out a testing
    arrangement to help you make final decisions."
