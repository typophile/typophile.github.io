body: "Hey guys. I'm working on this logo for a company with the initials S.E.Co,
  and this is a special version of the logo that will only be used on one specific
  product. To be completely transparent without giving away too much, the logo us
  a subtle homage to GE, hence the big curly E. \r\n\r\nAny help would be very much
  appreciated.I need help with.\r\n\r\n1) The terminal of the O: I like that it is
  not a correct script O, that it almost just feels like a flourish off of the C,
  but not sure how to finish it\r\n\r\n2) The S: wider or narrower up top?\r\n\r\n3)
  The overall weight and feel of the mark. I'm an amateur and I just might be missing
  some glaring problems. \r\n\r\nTHANKS!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Seco_1_4993.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/seco_2_6136.jpg]"

  body: Take a look at (study) some refined script fonts and try to get the thick/thin
    relationships in line.... that will go a long way to taking care of a lot of the
    problems.

  body: "I'm seeing lowercase s (or &), capital E, then O with a flourish (instead
    of C). An alternate capital S would work, where everything from the left-side
    beginning of the S to the dotted blue line is simply removed. \r\n\r\nThen maybe
    the bottom of the C terminates a little lower so it's less like an O. The little
    swirl on the lowercase o is fine. I'd like to see more contrast between thick
    and thin strokes."
