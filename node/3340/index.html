<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Thanks to an extremely short attention span I've had the pleasure of reading the two english essays in <br><a href=http://www.myfonts.com/person/hartz/sem/l/ target=_blank> Sem Hartz</a> otherwise dutch <i>Essays</i> for the last two weeks. <br> <br>It's a beautiful book, designed by <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/person/de-does/bram/ target=_blank> Bram de Does</a>, and set in <i>Emergo</i> with examples of <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/person/van-krimpen/jan/ target=_blank>Jan van Krimpens</a> <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/spectrum/mt-semi-bold/testdrive.html?s=Birth%2BSchool%2BWork%2BDeath&p=48" target=_blank>Spectrum semi bold</a> (the metal version, obviously) and Hartz own <i>Juliana</i>. <br> <br>What strikes me is: Why is there no digital versions of Emergo and Juliana? <br>While Zapfs (<i>the Master craftsman</i>) designs are being updated and honoured these two little gems could fall into oblivion. <br> <br>Another thing, type that actually have been digitized, like Bembo, but somewhat lost a bit of soul in the process, who'll take responsibility to save them?! <br> <br>Do You have better examples? Do You feel like taking some responsibility? Am I <i>wrong</i>? <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>This little book is indeed a gem. My favorite thing is the actual printed sample of Linotype Juliana from a novel on cheap stock. (Emergo btw is less impressive to me.) <br> <br>> Why is there no digital versions of Emergo and Juliana? <br> <br>One reason might be that the person who owns the rights to them is squatting. <br> <br>> who'll take responsibility to save them?! <br> <br>For designs that are protected, the Law tries to prevent improvement (to defend the status quo). <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>The book is about BdD's work, as book designer and type designer. Not much theory. There are many reproductions from books he designed. I'd say it's an historical overview of his carrer. The book is bilingual, Dutch/English. Dutch, on the top half of the pages, set in Trinit</div>

<div class=commentbody>Eduardo's summary accurately describes the book. <br> <br>I'll add that even though it isn't a book on type design, it's <br>interesting to note the relationship between PMN and BdD. <br>PMN has half of the rights to Lexicon and consults closely <br>with BdD. It's also nice the see PMN's interpolations against <br>BdD's drawings too. <br> <br>I suppose the intent is to frame BdD's life and by doing so <br>cast some light on his types. Faults aside, a keeper in my library. <br> <br>But... back to Sem Hartz. <br>What do you mean by squatting Hrant?</div>

<div class=commentbody>> What do you mean by squatting <br> <br>(Sorry, I forgot to address that before.) <br> <br>I mean sitting on a design with little intent/time to develop it, but preventing others from working on it anyway. No matter what the law says, a design is a cultural treasure that belongs to everybody to some extent - it deserves to be made available irrespective of who does the revival. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>the BdD book is nice BUT the bilingual part is not necessarily brilliant; <br>the index pages do not gain from it. <br> <br>And if what you say is true about Sem being a type squatter, that's really sad. <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>> if what you say is true about Sem being a type squatter <br> <br>Hartz passed away in '95*. But in any case designers aren't always the "owners" of their design, especially not back then**. Emergo is probably owned by Enschede now, and I suspect they have too many interesting projects going and not a big enough army of capable designers! Juliana is probably owned by Linotype now, and they have too many fonts already. :-/ <br> <br>* There's a nice obituary in Quaerendo: volume 27, number 3, pp164-9. <br> <br>** Like Miedinger got pennies for Helvetica. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>
