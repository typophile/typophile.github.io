body: Im writing an essay on the definition of 'fun' within a design context esp.
  in visual communication/design and would like to know what designers think what
  the word means and various examples of typography, logos, installations, desginers
  etc where fun is represented. It would also be interesting to see if our views of
  what 'fun' is in a design context are similar or completely different

    is simply good design. It makes finding/doing whatever I am doing unobtrusive
    and helpful enough to make the task 'fun'.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "As Darrel and Alessandro said, fun can be easily differentiated from \"funny\".
    \r\n\r\nFor e.g we say, \" i like roaming around alone in this area, its fun\".
    So you don't need to be humorous or funny at that time to enjoy.\r\nFun is a simple
    feel-good reaction...and good design makes you feel that by shapes, color, visual
    appeal, sights, sounds and motion.\r\n\r\nWell, Miss Tiffany has given some really
    good links,sure they will help."

  body: 'thanks. those books mentioned by Miss Tiffany will definately be useful.
    I find in terms of font, fun is characterised as childish, cliche even kitsch.
    Would you agree? When i visited font sites, all the so called ''fun'' fonts have
    too much personality that I find it hard to see how they would be employed in
    many mainstream commercial design contexts. '

  body: "Well topucafo, i feel that a font doesn't have to be too expressive in itself
    to emote the message. \r\n\r\nFor instance, take a font, reduce the letter spacing
    and put them on black as negative space, it will create a real tension in layout.
    Now again take the same font, give it some free space, use bright colours and
    you will see that same font will emote Joy.\r\n\r\nThe final appeal depends a
    lot on the composition and visual treatment also.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "\"Bounce\" is the quintessential feature of fun type.\r\nThat's a lettering
    term to describe not being rooted to the baseline.\r\nRotation--not being strictly
    vertical--could be construed as a side effect of bounce, as could \"wander\",
    which would mean that letterspacing is irregular; rotation and wander are what
    happen when there's bounce, as the trampolinist demonstates.\r\n\r\nDancing is
    fun, but not marching. \r\n\r\nAny typeface can be bounced, and thereby funnified,
    so it's a typographic aspect of layout, not in the font per se.\r\nI suppose the
    typographer could also play with size and scaling (horizontal to vertical proportion).\r\n\r\nHowever
    the same principle of deviation from strict regularity may be applied to the design
    of glyphs.\r\nIn small degree, this provides wit; a bit more and it becomes cuteness;
    further still, and into the indiscriminate area of professional sloppiness, or
    vernacular amateurism. But keep going and you end up with something like Fontesque,
    in which not only is the quality of bounce embedded, but there is also pointed
    deviation from regularity in counter size, serif size, stroke width, terminal
    treatment (i.e. arbitrariness in use of ball or adnate terminals) and serif genre
    (i.e. bracketed, slab, or hooked).\r\n\r\nFurther with the dance metaphor, syncopation
    is good, emphasizing an off-beat. So there is some organizing principle in the
    disarray of fun. Going totally free-form is generally outside the comfort zone.\r\n\r\nIn
    any design context, there is a norm, so a type choice which is slightly more irregular
    than normal for that kind of work will start to be fun, along the axis of wit
    to cute to cloying to...naff.\r\n\r\n"

    furniture stores call 'modern' is really something designed in 1980 that is really
    big and poofy.\r\n\r\nFurniture snobs, though, tend to use 'modern' to refer to
    mid-century pieces created by the likes of the Eames.\r\n\r\nSo, mass market:
    fun = comic sans\r\nType and design market: fun = highly functional typefaces
    with a strong personality\r\n\r\nI think those in the industry would use the term
    'novelty' over 'fun' to describe the often goofy looking 'childish' faces.\r\n\r\n\"Dancing
    is fun, but not marching. \"\r\n\r\nYou need to rent Stripes again, Nick. ;o)"
