body: "All:\r\n\r\nI am a website designer and have been asked to redesign the following
  website:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.mylavienailspa.com/\r\n\r\nAs you can tell, this site
  is written entirely in Flash, and thus is not accessible on most mobile devices.
  (In my personal opinion, Flash should be eradicated wherever it occurs. But I digress).\r\n\r\nThe
  issue is the logo, which uses a very fancy calligraphic font. I have attached a
  jpg containing a screenshot of this logo.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the capital \"L\"
  is particularly ornate. I have looked everywhere and cannot seem to locate this
  font. Recreating the logo from scratch in Adobe Illustrator is proving tedious and
  time consuming.\r\n\r\nDoes this look familiar to any of you folks? Any help would
  be awesome! Thanks in advance for any advice you can provide.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nJeff"
