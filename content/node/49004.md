  (http://www.apsattv.com/history/january2001.html) and the like - just wondering
  if anyone had a clue where I can find this? Been trailing through the usual flash
  / pixel font sources without any joy...\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks for your help!\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Thai3_3685H_mediasatestcard_5835.jpg]"

  body: "Thanks for the help people - I did try fonstruct, and you are right - really
    fast way to knock up this kind of modular font... my 1/2 hour attempt below resulted
    in a caps only face, perfectly usable (although it doesnt like being installed
    in suitcase)\r\n This face needs to be stretched horizontally  a little - as it
    is broadcast the pixels are not (I think) actuallly square - they have a different
    aspect ratio...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbest\r\n\r\nMatt[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fonstructed_str_3533.jpg]"

  body: Well done! You can use the "Advanced" palette in FontStruct to increase the
    vertical scale of the bricks overall.
