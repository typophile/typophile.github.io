I went to look for WIRED but it's a US magazine so I don't know if I can get it around the UK everywhere.

<div class=commentbody>wow dberlow, where did that come from ?
TED offers some amazing minds the chance to present, compare and synthesize views on everything from the future of computing in art and design to social justice and the politics of technological superiority.
it's heavily blogged and many of the presentations can be viewed online.
you can start at the boingboing coverage and trace the links from there.

<div class=commentbody>"why is that funny ?"
I won a 1968 Mustang in buzz-word bingo, with that phrase.
I'm sorry to leap out of the forum at anyone's opinion, but I am of the opinion that there is a whole kind of conference, and this is not new, that I find, and have found, to be deeply superficial, narrowly hypocritical... and broadly hilarious. But, I've mostly resisted.
Author Paul Stamets, bless his heart, "...mushrooms can save the world", not unless they can learn to grow in sea water, not to mention that they're breathing my air. Undersea explorer Robert Ballard, brilliant guy, lots of people Do Explore the Oceans, stop taking pictures, haul up some of them battleships, lower sea level, make reefs. Todd Machover, genius, is gonna make sure that no rich parent will survive, and no rich child will be left behind, by Star Search. And I don't mean to 'peck' at you but Joshua Klein master of machines, why is he building a vending machine for crows to deposit coins, for peanuts...some future web model?
"Writing in sand is probably our best bet."
Sand? For one to impress such an audience, one'd need to design and 'draw' a new font, liiive, in ones own blood.
Maybe next year.
Cheers!

<div class=commentbody><cite>Author Paul Stamets, bless his heart, “...mushrooms can save the world”, not unless they can learn to grow in sea water, not to mention that they’re breathing my air. </cite>
An interesting note on Mycelium is that several types work symbiotically with the roots of trees and provide nutrients that fertilize the trees. It is a very important issue with forestation and the paper industry because if the mycelium can be kept alive it reduces or eliminates the fertilization needs for tree farming. So David, the mushrooms are helping to make the air you breathe and are probably a huge factor in keeping a steady supply of breathable air.</div>

<div class=commentbody>dberlow: so unless someone's presentation is the flawless be-all and end-all of their area of interest they should say nothing ? you must be kidding. it's called research and exploration. this is how ideas germinate, expand, cross-pollinate, fertilize, inspire, and evolve. it's an organic process and conferences can provide a concentrated dose of exposure, contacts, and inspiration.
sorry none of them are good enough for you. perhaps next year we should all just ask you for your perspective on these topics ?</div>

Anything saving the world is clearly hyperbole, but what I did not clarify is that mycelial mats are the root structure of the mushroom. The mats are the worlds largest organisms, and their fruit, so to speak, is the mushroom.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I don't think this person is a useless or trendy, just slow and not likely to finish. He is not a miinor celebrity, I'll give him that. My jaw remained firmly raised. The really interesting thing in this video, besides the crap type, was the number of times, the presenter says, "what if". Like, what if "everybody" put all kinds of text data and metrics matching data into all their photos, and then gave them away for free! Or, what if everybody had enough memory and bandwidth to browse a glabobyte of data on their computer in ten seconds...What if Operating systems were as scaleable as the fonts and images we've been supplying for nearly three decades, WOW!
What'a the big deal to "be there" for something that's not possible for years?
