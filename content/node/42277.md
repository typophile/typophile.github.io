body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI need an organiser (agenda in dutch.. I believe that is an
  organiser in english, right?). I'v been looking everywhere to find a nice typographic
  one, but can't find any.\r\nWell... I probably haven't looked everywhere. I've checked
  veer.com. Nice stuff.. but no organisers and they don't seem to ship to Europe...
  WHY NOT!??! I finally got a job and I can spend some money on cool typographic stuff...
  and they just don't ship it to Holland.. =(\r\nI also checked fontshop and some
  other font foundries, but didn't get lucky. I did get the little notebook from fontshop
  in the mail the other day, but it's a notebook and it doesn't give me dates where
  I can write stuff down.\r\n\r\nIf anyone knows a nice typographic organiser please
  let me know!\r\n\r\ncheers,\r\ndav2."

    Ordning + Reda organizer. The company is Swiss and they have stores in Europe.
    The organizers are type only, no pictures. I absolutely love them, although they
    are no longer sold in the States (you have to ship it from the UK).\r\n\r\n[[http://www.ordning-reda.com]]\r\n\r\nregards\r\nsarah"

  body: "Thank you for your help there! =)\r\n\r\nThey got some nice stuff at typotheque!
    Too bad the 2008 one is already sold out... but I signed up for the 2009 one now.\r\n\r\nLulu
    is also a very good one!! I forgot about that site.. but they got some nice stuff
    there for not a lot of money at all!\r\nAlthough the word book doesn't really
    seem like a organiser... but I had already downloaded that one somewhere else...
    don't remember where I got it.\r\n\r\nI've also emailed ordning-edna in belgium
    about shipping options, but no reply so far. Some of the covers seem ok, minimalistic..
    just too bad I can't see how they are inside... (also emailed them about that.\r\n\r\nthanks
    people.. guess I'm just way too late to start looking for organisers now. Still
    if anyone finds anything plz let me know!\r\n\r\ncheers!\r\ndav2."
