  Or is that how Garamond Italic faces typically look, in which case, do you find
  them problematic for local use within text that is mainly Garamond Roman in the
  same point size? \r\n"

  body: Compare, for instance, Stempel Garamond, Adobe Garamond, Garamond Premier,
    etc. Garamond italics are almost always based on the work of Robert Granjon, whose
    italics were indeed a little uneven and eccentric. How much this is preserved
    varies with the adaptation.
