    very close actually but still not convinced it could be it... This sample looks
    rounded and somehow in-between Regular and Condensed version.\r\nI'm curious too.
    From which movie poster is it?"

    file i'm working on is telling me it is missing :( It just doesn't tell me what
    it's called!

  body: i'm with ryuk. at this point, Bourgeois would do. the sample looks like it
    may have been artificially bolded & possibly mildly squished. and certainly photoshopped
    so the slight roundness would be an effect of either intent or just the sample
    at hand.

  body: "Yeah, I know what you mean, but it's definitely a font that exists as a stand
    alone file.\r\nI only know this because it's a \"text layer\" in Final Cut Pro....and
    there's limited options with what you can do to your type in side this app.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately
    it doesn't tell me the name of the missing font, it just defaults to another one
    in the list. Very frustrating!\r\n\r\nIf anyone else out there has any other suggestions....they
    are very welcome! :)\r\n\r\nThanks guys\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    the name like exporting/rendering/opening your file with another compatible software?
    Try googling, it might work, someone would propably had the same problem.\r\nMay
    be this one could help: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2416083?start=0&tstart=0\r\nMove
