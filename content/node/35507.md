  body: When I registered they told me the "Gray Shuttle" makes a stop at the Crowne.
    Not sure exactly what the "Graay Shuttle" is but the way it was described by the
    reservations clerk it would be self-evident.

    the airport to downtown.  Here's Google Transit's view of it:\r\n\r\n    http://www.google.com/transit?ie=UTF8&f=d&saddr=sea&daddr=1113+6th+Ave,+seattle&ttype=dep&date=7%2F31&time=1:18pm&z=11&om=1\r\n\r\nThe
    #194 would certainly be cheaper (@ $2 or less) than a cab or shuttle (probably
    $30+), and might even be easier, depending on whether you're taking a shuttle
    that has other dropoffs.\r\n\r\n--John"

    here... http://transit.metrokc.gov/tops/bus/schedules/s194_0_.html \r\n\r\nThe
    4th and University stop sounds like the closest to the hotel. Head up hill a few
    blocks and then north to get to the hotel.\r\n\r\nThe 194 doesn't really accomodate
    people with lots of bags or a huge suitcase (say one full of Froggy flyers). If
    you have either of these you might want to sit towards the back where you can
    find room to stash your gear. \r\n\r\nMy guess is the gray shuttle maybe athe
    Grey-line bus that serves downtown airports. \r\n\r\nCheers, Si"

  body: "<cite>Seattle has a good public transit system, too</cite> \r\nI just about
    choked on my mocha. Have you ever used Seattle's public transport?\r\n\r\nIn any
    case, I work at a hotel downtown. Here are your options:\r\n\r\nMetro bus: As
    above. You get to ride next to the hobos, and the drivers have little patience
    for lots of luggage.\r\n\r\nGreyline bus: It's basically a charter bus that stops
    at various locations. \r\n\r\nMisc. Shuttles: There are 2 dozen handfuls of different
    companies. They're all the same, and they're all mediocre.\r\n\r\nTaxi: Screw
    those guys.\r\n\r\nTowncar: My preferred method. We can arrange to have a car
    meet you, drive you downtown, and you won't have to put up with a lot of baloney
    from the driver. If you call your hotel, or preferably me since they pay commission,
    we can get anything from a limo to a suburban to a minivan to a towncar to ride
    you into town in style.\r\n\r\nI have my preference, but the greyline/shuttle
    services work fine. Not very comfortable, and slower than molasses, but they'll
    get you there eventually and they're almost decently priced. \r\n\r\nThe towncars
    are fast and comfortable, and cost less than a cab because they're a flat rate,
    not on the meter.\r\n"

    in 30 mins. Don't see why anyone would pay for shuttle or screw for cab--unless
    you have lots of swag to haul.
