body: "Hello all! I'm new to the forum and my name is Filippo. I actually work as
  graphic designer in Italy and I'm specialized in brand identity (Sorry for my bad
  English!!!).\r\nI'm very interested in typography and would like, one day, to start
  creating a complete set of glyphs. Unfortunately right now I understood only some
  fundamentals of typography and so I'm here to ask you, experts, some questions that
  turns in my mind! Hope you will be so kind as to answer. :-)\r\n\r\nFirst of all,
  in my typographic works, created generally for logotypes in brand identities, I'm
  always looking for a strict geometrical relationship between every single curve:
  relationship that can be reduced to circles and lines and tends to exclude Bezier
  curves as in these three screenshots of works: [[https://dl.dropbox.com/u/54593770/screenshot_01.png]]
  , [[https://dl.dropbox.com/u/54593770/screenshot_02.png]] , [[https://dl.dropbox.com/u/54593770/screenshot_03.png]]
  .\r\nNow I wonder if is always possible to use this method or I've to reason in
  other ways to create good glyphs. For example, taking an authoritative font as the
  Univers by Adrian Frutiger: is every single glyph amenable to a series of circles
  and lines linked one to another? Is it possible to see a drawing?\r\n\r\nDon't you
  think that a purist geometrical construction (perhaps not always possible) gives
  to you a more solid and stable base compared to Bezier curves? I don't know, I feels
  like Bezier curves are not properly really definable in every single smallest aspect.
  They seems...inaccurate compared to the strength of a circle, of a simple geometrical
  form. Don't you think?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for every flash of inspiration!!!"

    you have said. I think you are contradicting yourself here\r\n<blockquote>I don't

    more constricting than bezier curves?\r\n<blockquote>They seems...inaccurate compared

    do you mean? Inaccurate is being used very loosely here. Circle is strong but
    there is very little which can be achieved with straight/regular shapes. Even
    the most geometric typefaces are not perfectly geometric. There is a slight variation
    in curvature or slant. Beziers are very powerful and the most complicated shapes
    can be achieved using beziers.(IIRC, I remember someone drawing a girl using fontlab
    bezier curves)\r\nCheers\r\nTypo"

  body: "Nick, that's true, but to me Filippo is essentially alluding to simplicity.
    A line is simpler than a circle, which in turn is simpler than an oval, which
    is simpler than a b\xE9zier - that sort of thing.\r\n\r\nThe problem Filippo is
    that simplicity is a matter of style, not function; the way humans perceive things
    (especially when in \"deep reading\") is not at all simple. Here's a very primitive
    but telling  example: if you make a mathematically perfect square where all the
    sides are mathematically equal in thickness you'll end up \r\nwith something that
    looks a bit oblong and with horizontals that look thicker than the verticals.\r\n\r\nAn
    individual might personally prefer things to look simple, but that doesn't lead
    to Good Design (which is about helping many people, sometimes without them realizing
    :-).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    (but I want to know if you agree). In type design there are three ways of creating
    a single glyph:\r\n\r\n1) Free hand (with a specific calligraphic pen, a normal
    pen or a pencil): it is a very versatile system but, on the other and, it is also
    very inaccurate.\r\n\r\n2) Geometrical basic figures on a grid (before the computer
    with compass and rulers on graph paper): a system extremely precise but not so
    versatile (theoretically all glyphs can be projected only by a series of circles
    and lines but...in most cases this way is too long and complicated).\r\n\r\n3)
    Bezier curves (before the computer with series of plastic or wood curves): I think
    this is the way in the middle, quite precise and quite versatile and it is probably
    for this reason that is the most widespread.\r\n\r\nI personally prefer way number
    2 but, recently, I realized that is not always applicable mainly because of problems
    of time. So sad!"

  body: "For example, yesterday I tried to project by hand a small set of glyphs with
    the method of plastic curves and pencil. In Adrian Frutiger's pencil drawings
    I saw he was used to specify the thickness of the lines of the glyph and so I
    tried.\r\nThis is the result (italic 15\xB0): <a href=\"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/54593770/photo_01.jpg\">Photo</a>\r\n\r\nI
    think the final result is good but:\r\n1) the thickness specified by numbers (as
    you can see from the photo) isn't exactly equal in every single point...it is
    not possible! Where I wrote 12 (in the top part of the \"a\") is not really every
    time 12 mm but can be 12.01, 12.1, 12.05, ecc...\r\n2) to join two points with
    a set of plastic curves we can use millions of different curves. If I drew the
    glyphs by free hand would be the same thing but the lines have been more dirty.\r\n\r\nSo
    can the design of a glyph be considered geometric? I think, in this case and in
    a lot of other, no...because is more a matter of eye rather than of strict proportions
    and because geometry is unconditionally precise and this glyph is not. Don't you
    agree?\r\n\r\nSorry if I stress you with this sort of questions but you have to
    help me killing my mental block...and this can be done by reasoning. I'm a square
    and want to be a curve!"

    You have to correct them too. Identical features can look different and different

    not totally agree with the thought according to which a young and unskilled graphic
    designer is used to chose a geometry based typography. I think instead that his
    choice would fall much more easily on unconventional ones, independently  if based
    on geometry or not.\r\n\r\nThe point changes if we talk about the real design
    of a typeface. Probably the young type designer, that decides to create a typeface,
    opts for a geometrical one because, during the construction of single glyphs,
    he will rely not only on his eyes, of which probably he still do not totally trust,
    but also on well defined geometric rules.\r\n\r\nThe more he will practice in
    type design, the more he will trust in his eyes and the more he will leave geometrical
    path (IMHO of course)."

      it happens graphic designers, when looking for a font, search the same pure

      shapes (I'm still a junior in the field but realise very well how hard is it)
      for an inexperienced (in typography) graphic designer, it's really difficult
      to feel the text-line rhythm is not perfect.\r\nOn the other side, as a typographer
      you know a purely geometric font can't be good. However it can \"look as\" geometric;
