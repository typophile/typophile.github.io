  line? By this i mean say the E or H or R have their midsection lowered closer to
  the bottom that the top.....\r\n\r\nIs this known as a particular style?\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks,\r\nAndrew"

  body: "I am familiar with the term low-waisted ( or high-waisted) for type that
    looks as you describe. For example, the first Neutraface font was low-waisted,
    with the crossbar low on the E, and the R counter using more than half the height.
    Many Art Deco or Art Nouveau styles are either high-waisted, or low-waisted.\r\n\r\nIs
    that what you mean?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
