  sample is from an old ad, and is almost certainly hand-lettered. I know there are
  typefaces out there with a similar look, I just can't find any right now. I'm specifically
  interested in something with that \"lazy\" leaning S, and the low crossbar on the
  A. Any suggestions are welcome, thanks in advance."

  body: another option is [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/dstype/estilo/estilo/|Estilo]]'s
    lowercase, which isn't really lowercase and has the "lazy" S. the A is right-leaning
    as well in the standard glyph set, but it [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/dstype/estilo/estilo/characters.html|looks
    like]] there's an alternative upright one; no low crossbar, though.
