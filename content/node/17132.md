body: "I am trying to identify one of the typefaces used in the board game <a href=\"http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/3076\"><cite>Puerto
  Rico<cite></a>. I've attached an image that contains examples that I've scanned
  in from various playing pieces and the game manual.\r\n\r\nThe best match I've been
  able to find so far is <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/kynges-x-nf/.>Kynges
  X NF</a> from <a href=\"http://www.nicksfonts.com/\">Nick's Fonts</a>. It's close,
  but not exactly the same.\r\n\r\nAccording to that MyFonts page, Kynges X NF was
  \"inspired by an offering in the 1938 classic, <cite>Letters and Lettering</cite>
  by Paul Carlyle and Gus Oring\". Perhaps the face I'm looking for was digitized
  from the same source?"

    if there are any. Maybe the Puerto Rico type has the \"t\" crossbar a little heavier.
    What differences do you think you see?\r\n\r\nThanks for the pointer, btw. I had
    been wondering what typeface they were using, myself. Puerto Rico is a great game!\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "I too see lots of little differences.\r\n\r\nThe typeface appears in the
    Solotype Catalog as Yucca. Dan Solo created a digital version under a different
    name, for some reason: Malvern. It can only be had from the <a href=\"http://store.doverpublications.com/0486999602.html\"
    target=\"_blank\">24 Celtic and Medieval Display Fonts CD</a> from Dover. I have
    Malvern and it is a perfect match."

  body: "Thanks for the help, guys. Malvern does appear to be a perfect match -- and
    quite a bargain, too.\r\n\r\nAs Mike has mentioned, there are many small differences
    between Kynges X NF and Malvern. Aside from the more glaring variations in form
    (such as the <cite>n</cite> that Thomas has pointed out), Malvern is on the whole
    more uniform and harmonious, while Kynges X NF is relatively uneven and idiosyncratic.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    Thomas, you probably already know this, but just in case you were wondering about
    the <em>other </em> face used heavily in <cite>Puerto Rico</cite>, it's <a href=\"http://www.bertholdtypes.com/bq_library/90092.html\">Post-Antiqua</a>
    from <a href=\"http://www.bertholdtypes.com/\">Berthold</a>.\r\n\r\nIt's a great
    game indeed. And now that I know what faces to use, I'll be able to make my own
    authentic-looking custom building, resource, and even role pieces."

    other typeface, that turns out to be Malvern. Thanks again.\r\n\r\nT"
