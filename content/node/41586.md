body: "Hi all.  I'm currently putting a magazine together for someone, and on one
  particular article that spreads out over three pages there's a lot of text to get
  in (not to mention pics).  Anyway, this got me to thinking; is there a recognized
  size for type in magazine articles?  Currently I have the type in the aforementioned
  article at 6.5pts, but seeing it in the screen its hard to really tell if 6.5pts
  is a tad too small for magazine print.  Before anyone suggests printing it out I
  have to say I have a Dell printer that wont work with my Macs, so that's a non starter.
  \ Anyone with experience care to help me?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\nSimon

  body: "\"tell if 6.5pts is a tad too small for magazine print.\"\r\n\r\nIn general,
    6.5 pt type would be painful to read in lengths. That size type is typically reserved
    for the legal stuff no one wants you to actually read. ;o)\r\n\r\nBUT, it does,
    of course, depend on the particular typeface you are using.\r\n\r\nBroadly speaking
    9-11 pt is the range for most body text.\r\n\r\n"

    using.

    the lyrics on the inside of a CD booklet for example, but wasn't sure it looked
    right for a magazine.  I've gone for 9pts.  Thanks for the input.

  body: "Please use a serif type for body copy. After about a page of reading sans
    serif, your readers will tire. I know there are a lot of people out there who
    defend the use of sans as a text face. They are used to reading small amounts
    of information at a time (say, no more than three paragraphs), and for this sort
    of thing, sans is fine. Any book or magazine intended for continuous reading,
    and published by a major publisher, is always set in a serif type.\r\n\r\nAs groundbreaking
    as \"The New Typography\" was, even Jan Tschichold was willing to admit this.
    All his later book typography was set in serif type."

    to think serif fonts look 'old fashioned' (that's my prediction of what he'll
    say, not what I think!), but I'll quote your take on it, and try and go with that.

  body: "Old fashioned? The earliest Greek inscriptions have a form that could be
    called sans serif, and it can be argued that the earliest letter forms in recorded
    history are sans serif.\r\n\r\n\"Modern\" by definition is that which is functional,
    legible, and suits the task for which it is intended. A serif type is easier to
    read for long stretches. Publishers are not tied to this convention because it
    is traditional, but because it is functional (i.e. modern).\r\n\r\nIf the magazine
    in question is intended to be browsed, not read, a sans serif type would work.
    If the articles are long, however, a modernist would choose a more functional
    and reader-friendly serif type."

    not crazy about Neo Sans as a text font. It seems more suited to headings.)\r\n\r\nSome
    fonts can be set smaller if they have a large x-height. For instance ITC Garamond
    can be several point sizes smaller than Adobe Garamond due to the radically different
    x-heights. (There will also be leading issues.)\r\n\r\nAnd if you can't print

  body: "Actually I recommend you print it out BEFORE you are too far down the road.
    As a designer who works in old media (print) I cannot emphasize enough how very
    important it is to see the printed page. For example, to view my work at true
    actual size, I need to view it at 137%. Viewing it at 100% is extremely misleading.
    But... 137% looks huge on the monitor. It can get very confusing. I learned the
    hard way, when my printer was on the fritz, that you really need to look at printouts
    - trimmed down. There are a couple of books I'd love to redo with the type a little
    smaller. You need to invest in a printer that will work with your Mac. \r\n\r\nYou
    are getting this advice from a lot of people; it would behoove you to heed it."

  body: "I'll just chime in and say I agree that you need to test the typeface on
    the printed page. Even if you only shape some text into the desired column width
    with several different point sizes and leading adjustments. Even for a graphic
    design magazine 6.5 pt (especially 5.5 pt) is far too small if the text is meant
    to be read. \r\n\r\nMany typefaces do not look the same on the monitor as they
    do on the printed page. The big boys would even suggest printing it on the same
    press and same paper intended for use. This isn't always possible, of course,
    but do what you can to get it as close to final. If not you could be surprised,
    for instance, at how light the text might print once it is on that gloss text
    weight paper at 3600 dpi compared to a quick print out on a 1200 dpi printer using
    offset paper. But, at least you'll have an idea."

  body: "Simon --\r\n\r\nDepends on your audience. Middle-aged readers tend to like
    larger type, because for most of us it's getting harder to read the really small
    stuff; but younger readers may like it small (though not tiny). The art director
    for a New York book publisher I spoke with recently pointed out that, if she used
    a small type size in a book aimed at a young demographic, the younger readers
    would perceive it as a book for old people, and not buy it. \r\n\r\nAnd although
    it's a good rule of thumb that serif faces are more often best for extended text,
    there are more important things than whether a typeface has serifs or not. I just
    got through reading a novel, quite happily, that was typeset in Optima. (It all
    depends on the spacing, of course. Sans serifs, especially light weights, are
    always getting tracked too tight in text; that kills readability.\r\n\r\nM\xE1rio
    Feliciano designed his FTF Stella as a text face for a surf magazine. I don't
    know how closely the readers of \"Surf Portugal\" read the text, but he said that
    when he tried using a serif typeface, they complained. Stella is a humanist sans;
    that's the direction to go, if you're looking for sans serifs typefaces that might
    actually work in extended text. \r\n\r\nIn general, I think sans serifs in text
    need narrower columns (unjustified) than serif faces \u2013 but that of course
    all depends on the individual face. And on everything else about how it's spaced.\r\n\r\n"
