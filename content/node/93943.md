  the European Union? What is the value of the Euro? Do we have to suffer for other
  countries problems? What if we step out of the EU, and just fend for ourselfs?!\r\n\r\nIt's
  a crisis indeed, in which there are alot of short term visions and 'solutions'.
  Surely you can just drop out, but what about the future? Europe must remember that
  we are not the only economy around. You can fend for yourself for a while but in
  the end you must compete with future big economic powers like China, India and South
  America.\r\n\r\nWhat Europe needs to survive on a long term is a solid platform.
  A strong network with clear guidelines that stimulates trading, but with the countries
  remaining their own seperate identity.\r\n\r\nTo symbolize this in a medium I made
  a display typeface named EUnity. It's a very complete typeface, that allow all European
  countries to make proper use of this font. With EUnity, the user is able to connect
  by choice with the use of uppercast writing or undercast.\r\n\r\nI would it if you
  would take a look at this font, get a feel for it, comment me if there are crucial
  things wrong with it, or just let me know what you think.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.filefactory.com/file/re5lkq471wt/n/EUnity_zip\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance,\r\n\r\n- RJ"

    legibility was\u2019t one of your main concerns\u2026 ;-)\r\nAlso, what about
    Greek support?"

  body: Maybe a very small subset of "all European countries".  No Cyrillic, no Armenian,  no
    Turkish, no Greek. Not that it matters, since it can't be read in any language.
