body: I was wondering if someone could help me identify the font used in the logo
  from the online storefront [[http://www.smallflower.com|Smallflower.com]].[img:sites/default/files/old-images/smallflower_logo_4426.jpg]

  body: "Even though 'curly' is a popular style, this doesn't look familiar. In some
    ways it reminds me of Rian Hughes' 'Yolanda', but that is missing the curlies.
    I was searching MyFonts using 'curly', but the first 150 fonts were different,
    and I need to leave right now. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: I can't imagine that w flourish being a standard glyph. It might be hand drawn
    and/or a manually modified typeface.

  body: "I think what you say about a custom(ized) font or hand-drawn is certainly
    possible, but a font with swash alternates could certainly have features like
    this 'w'. I thought it was worth searching, and I will try a bit longer, now that
    I'm back.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Well, I finished the search at MyFonts. No matches, but Lambada has some
    similar elements, though a very different feel. Edison Swirl also has some swirly
    components, but also not a match.\r\n\r\nTwo freebie fonts had some similar details,
    like <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/caffe-latte.font?nb_ppp=50&text=Smallflower\">
    Caffe Latte</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/nemo.font?nb_ppp=50&text=Smallflower\">Nemo</a>.
    However, these are much more roughly drawn. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the Smallflower
    logo is a professionally drawn custom logo, which may or may not be part of a
    full alphabet. Since they don't use it anywhere else on their site, I'd guess
    maybe it's only a logo.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: That appears to be a modification (simplification) of Herman Ihlenburg's Bijou
    (1882). One version is Fontbank's <a href="http://www.buyfonts.com/value_for_money/bangle.htm"
    target="_blank">Bangle</a>. The modifications are mostly trimming, except for
    the right side of the 'm' - although the whole thing could be a redrawing based
    upon Bijou.
