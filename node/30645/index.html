<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hello Everyone,
I don't know much on this subject, and was wondering if there were any online resources that list the TrueType fonts that allow this. My company has recently got into making PowerPoint presentations (unfortunately) for clients. I have been reading that it is possible to embed fonts into PowerPoint and still allow users that don't have the fonts to edit and save the presentation without the fonts defaulting. However there are some conditions, this can only be done on PC, it must be a TrueType face, and in the licensing agreement "Editable and Installable" must be allowed by the font creator.
So I'm looking for a way to quick reference this and find a TrueType font family that allows this feature. My ultimate goal would to be to find a nice large san-serif font family like Univers of Helvetica Neue, although I know Helvetica Neue does not allow this Editable and Installable feature.
Thanks,
Jeff</div>

<div class=commentbody>Jeff, I altered your title to clarify your needs a bit more.
Unfortuanately there isn't a quick and dirty way to do this. Your best bet might be to start by making a wishlist of fonts and then review their EULAs.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yeah I could imagine there being a world of issues. I just hate ugly things especially most Powerpoint Presentations. Most of the time our clients are making edits on the Presentation and do not have the font library that we have and/or the skill to install new fonts.
Thanks for your reply.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Adobe allows editable embedding for those fonts which we can, which is about 1/3 of our library. http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/info/embedding.html
Very very few folks allow installable embedding, however. Mostly some Windows core system fonts and maybe a few freeware or shareware fonts.
Cheers,
T</div>

<div class=commentbody>Microsoft and Adobe supply mostly 'editable' embedding fonts - no surprises as to why (we both sell apps which support embedding and want to give our customers the best experience). However, most other vendors, realizing that people would exploit the technology in the way you describe, which would equal less sales, set their fonts to ‘print and preview’. You can imagine a company’s design department only licensing a few copies of a font, embedding it in a doc* or PPT and handing it around the entire org for editing.
Anyway to cut a long story short, outside of the free font space, most vendors make P&P – pick the fonts you want to use and ask the vendor to upgrade you to editable, expect to pay for it, but don’t expect to pay too much ;-)
Cheers, Si
* I should add that embedding shouldn’t work with templates for this reason – it’s document embedding, not template embedding.
PS One note, for PPT, my understanding is that for a presentation to be editable all the fonts need to be set to 'editable' or 'installable' - even if there's one 'print and preview' font embedded in the presentation then it's locked for editing. This has to do with observing the letter of the TT/OT spec.

<div class=commentbody>>Very very few folks allow installable embedding, however. Mostly some Windows core system fonts and maybe a few freeware or shareware fonts.
MS stopped supporting the installation of 'installable' fonts in our apps some time ago, and most core fonts were in a hard-coded "don't embed" list anyway. We treat 'installable' as 'editable', and set most of our fonts to 'editable' in Vista. </div>

<div class=commentbody>If you use Windows, try the Microsoft font properties extension; it tells you what the embedding permission is for a font, along with other interesting information.
