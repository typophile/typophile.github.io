  [[http://www.losttype.com/lavanderia/]] that would work in Polish? Good or at least
  acceptable diacritics required, and readable version of digraphs used in Polish
  (rz, cz, sz), like those in Liza. \r\n\r\nMost of the scripts, I have found, use
  \"z\" with the bottom loop and the script version of the \"r\" (like in Feel Script),
  which is not always readable in Polish.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lavanderia_one_5782.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Liza_3506.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Feel_6185.png]"
