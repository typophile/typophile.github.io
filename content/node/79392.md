body: "I'm working on some titles in InDesign and have an issue with the kerning on
  some titles. Basically \"W\" followed by \"i\" and \"V\" followed by \"i\" are problematic
  because the dot on the i (see the attached screen shots). The obvious answer seems
  to be that I need to create the titles in Illustrator so I can create outlines and
  remove the dot over the \"i\" in order to allow the letter to move close together.
  \r\n\r\nIs the another way I should do this in InDesign so I don't need to create
  imported graphics?\r\n\r\nBy the way the typeface is H&FJ's Historical Fell Type
  Italic\r\n\r\nI checked the glyphs and there are no ligatures for this letter combo.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: Historically, these did not have any kerning. HF&J seems to have made that
    (and the ruggedness) a point. You could use a dotless i, which is one of ye old
    school hacks.

  body: "Many fonts include the dot as a separate glyph. If this is the case, you
    could use the dotless i and place the accentdot above the \u0131, moved to the
    right. Tedious, but works."

  body: ah yes, I missed the dotless "i" in the glyphs. That will take care of my
    issue. Thanks!
