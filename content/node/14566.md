body: Why do i have such a thing for [[ligature|ligatures]]? I don't know. Anyhow,
  i'm wondering if we have an expert on [[blackletter]] ligatures in the house. I
  know that the [[half r]] can follow "round" letters (b d o p) to form ligatures.
  I know that the "e" can be attached to these round letters as well. i'm familiar
  with the double-p ligature. and then there are always your f-ligs and longs-ligs.
  then you have your historical German ck and ch ligs, which i'm informed are no longer
  relevant. And then there's tz, which is used in German. Are there more? I know that
  potentially <em>everything</em> could be a ligature, but i'm talking about fairly
  standard blackletter ligature conventions here. anyhow, if anyone knows of any other
  interesting combinations, pipe up!

    letter typeface, you have to stuck to the old traditional rules since no one has
    change it. This means at least the long_s and hopefully the common ligatures.
    The round r is outdated since the time of Fleischmann.\r\nCommon ligatures are:\r\nc_h
    \r\nc_k \r\nlongs_c_h \r\nlongs_longs \r\nlongs_i \r\nlongs_t \r\nlongs_z (germandbls)\r\nf_f\r\nf_i\r\nf_l\r\nf_t\r\nt_z
    \r\nl_l \r\nEven more ligatures are possible. Have a look at the original lead
    typeface of Klingspor Gotisch (not the Linotype digi version).\r\n\r\n    \r\nBut
    anyway, dump, naive people set even German texts like common texts today - and
    it looks awful. But were is no standard of a Fraktur codepage or a Fraktur keyboard
    layout. Only a pseudo standard \"Dfr\" (Deutsche Frakur) is available - setting
    up the long_s and its ligatures on false glyphs on a standard codepage.\r\n\r\nJohn,
    how is the status of the Fraktron project?\r\nhttp://fraktron.sourceforge.net/\r\n\r\n--<a

    that old specimens (like that for Wilhelm Klingspor Gotisch) often you you everything
    you need to know. Richard must have some, right? E-mail me if you can't find anything\u2026\r\n\r\nAlso,
    I think that some of the ligatures are style dependent. If you are designing a
    real textura,* for instance, then the half-r would be kind of cute, even though
    printers stopped using them in the 18th century. But a fraktur, unless it was
    a Nuremburg fraktur, could probably do without them, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n*As long
    as your texura isn't an Old English\u2026"

    Nationale, 1902), I'm working on, the complete set of ligatures is:\r\n\r\nff,
    fi, ffi, ct, tt, ll\r\n\r\nNote that fl, in particular, is not ligated. Obviously,
    fj is uncommon in French, but presumably it would follow the same rules as fi.\r\n\r\nAdditional
    variants include: final s, final n, initial v. There are also final-swash e, t,
    r.\r\n\r\nWhen I release the font, all these ligatures and variants will be included.
    I'm still undecided which ones to make optional, though - I think that'll take
    more experience using the type in present-day settings.\r\n"
