  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I'm just wondering, as I've noticed I've paid more attention to the form of my handwriting ever since I developed an appreciation for various typefaces. For example, I started to add a tail onto my Gs due to the influences of Helvetica and occasionally try to write my Rs like the Helvetica Rs. Also, for a time I tried to make my question marks similar to that of Futura and tried adding a flag to my 1s, again influenced by Futura. 

So have any of you changed your handwriting due to the influences of a particular typeface?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I try to write as quickly as possible, time's running out. This means my handwriting is a matter of getting something on paper at high-speed, not necessarily conducive to thinking "what shall I make a particular character look like?"

Maybe this is one of the reasons I can't understand why anyone wants a font to resemble handwriting. Since one of the basic premises of handwriting is speed, why would I then wan't anything to look like a handwritten form when, in type design, I have got time to make a character look exactly like I want it to without the limitations of a hand on a pen governing how it should look. That would be illogical. Call me a Philistine if you like.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Michael, sorry I hope it didn't sound like I was taking a pop at handwriting as an art-form. I know we have had our exchanges before about whether type should look like handwriting (or would benefit from being based on handwriting in its basic forms) but I would never suggest that anyone who loves it shouldn't take their time and consider it time well-spent.

I am writing less and less these days. I haven't written anything today, but may do the concise crossword in The Times later (upper case only, but that's a different thread).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I overhauled my signature in high school, and my redesign was heavily influenced by Tolkien's Fëanorian Tengwar, with a lot of sharp descenders and a couple swashes.

Likewise, I redesigned my messy handwriting in high school, shifting to a printed Roman drawn with different strokes many of which simulate serifs (on the B, D, I, J, P, R, and S), which greatly improved the legibility and readability of my printing. I didn't have a specific serif face in mind when I did the redesign, so it was probably Times New Roman that influenced it the most; still, clarity is one of TNR's virtues, so I could have chosen a worse model.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">No. I used the cursive style I had learned at school by age 10. It became slicker by the time I was an adult, but had the same basic construction. Then around age 30 I studied calligraphy, and subsequently adapted my casual handwriting to use the proper joining rules of the chancery script.

The only typeface I've made from my handwriting is Panoptica Script, but it's not my everyday writing. Handsome, a script face, was "written" in Fontographer with a Wacom stylus, but the effect is too stiff and formal to bear much relationship to my "real" handwriting. One of these days I might make a typeface based on my writing.</div>
