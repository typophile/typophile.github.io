  had a logo done a few years back and am no longer in touch with the designer. \r\n\r\nI
  need to make some changes to the text, but I cannot, for the life of me, find what
  font this is. It's similar to Century but slimmer... \r\n\r\nI've attached an image
  and it's the sans serif that I'm looking for - not the swirly stuff, obviously.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for any help..\r\n\r\nYvonne. "
