    to LINK <BR>stuff as efficiently as Yves and Stephen. <BR> <BR>Here, here and
    here. <BR>1 2 3 4 5 <BR> <BR>That&#39;s a good June 1 resolution.  <BR> <BR>So

  body: BTW BJ the fastest way to do it is to copy/paste the  <BR>URL into the code,
    or to hold down the mouse button  <BR>and select <i>&#39;Copy link location&#39;</i>.
    You probably knew  <BR>that, but I thought I might as well mention it. ;p
