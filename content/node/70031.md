  body: Hmmm. Everything but the R seems pretty good with <a href="http://www.dutchtypelibrary.nl/Nobel_rdrct.html">DTL
    Nobel</a> which was one of my first guesses. That and the A turned me away from
    that as my first guess. Still probably one of the closest I've found.

  body: The Nobel of FontBureau, on the other hand, has the right R, but not the right
    A as far as I can see. Maybe if one stretches one of the condensed weights? (I'm
    not a typographist so don't shoot me if I'm talking nonsense please:)

  body: "Nobel has flat tops on the M and N, but this sample doesn't. I think either
    \ House <A href=\"http://www.houseind.com/fonts/neutrano2\">Neutraface No.2</a>
    or <a href=\"http://www.typography.com/testDriver/index.php?mode=characters&productLineID=100009\">H&FJ
    Verlag</a> would be closer.\r\n\r\nThe R is not the same in either, but making
    one from a P is simple.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Mike, the DTL Nobel does not have flat tops. That's a big identifier for me.
    Which makes it quite close, but some subtle differences still.

  body: "Ah, thanks Paul. I didn't realize it was so different from the Font Bureau
    version.\r\n\r\nHowever, I still think the possibility exists that a less expensive
    font, or mix of fonts, may have been used. That A seems rather out of character
    to me with the rest of the letters. Could it be from Kabel?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: The A does seem too wide for the rest of them and the crossbar a little too
    low. However, it's not Kabel. Kabel's crossbar is higher than Nobel's.
