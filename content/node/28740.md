body: "I am a graphic designer in Sydney, Australia. Currently doing research on Edward
  (Ted) Passanissi, a little-known Australian designer in the 50s-80s. Apparently
  during 1956/57 he studied in the Netherlands at 'Lettergieterij Amsterdam' (Amsterdam
  Type Foundry). \r\n* Can anyone advise if this well known foundry was also a 'school'
  and maybe ran a 1, 2 or 3 year course, or perhaps Ted could have been something
  like an 'apprentice' or possibly an 'assistant'. \r\n* Was 'Lettergieterij Amsterdam'
  more than a type foundry?  \r\n* I have found reference that Henk Gianotten may
  have been there at this time, and perhaps he or some other person could possibly
  have met Ted.\r\nAny suggestions?\r\nThanks. Graham"

    or \u2018Tetterode\u2019 as it was called when it merged into the B\xFChrmann\u2013Tetterode
    concern in that same year. So if Passanissi interned (my guess) at LA in 1956/57
    they probably did not meet\u2026\r\n\r\nTetterode wasn\u2019t just a foundry.
    It sold machinery to the printing industry, eg typesetting equipment, presses
    etc. It does so even now. \r\n\r\nSome history can be found here:\r\nhttp://www.buhrmann.com/eng/about_buhrmann/history.aspx

      leads.
