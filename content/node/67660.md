  \ I'm looking for some overall feedback on the design.  I am also including some
  additional elements I plan on incorporating to help represent the different types
  of wildlife.  \r\n\r\nTo be honest, I think the wildlife text below UTAH needs to
  be punch up in some way, any thoughts?  \r\n\r\nThanks for your time and candid
  feedback.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I like the type. I wonder if the lockup frame is needed. What if the icon
    was not reversed and above the type (sans the frame)? It still might need something
    else to tie it all together but I think might help the type stand out more. \r\n"

  body: I think the T is too wide. The U is too heavy, try giving it a bit of contrast
    (making the bottom curve and the right stem thinner. Also, the left diagonal of
    the A could be lighter, and the A's top serifs a bit heavier instead. Maybe the
    H bar should go up a bit.

  body: "As for the icons...\r\n\r\nI think all of the animals should be cropped by
    the icon box like you have done with the elk. Get 3/4 of the fish, below the wingspan
    on the pheasant and maybe turn the birds on a 45% angle."

  body: "I agree with aluminum. Does it need the frame? \r\n\r\nBut didn't Utah use
    a similar arc logo a few years ago? Not that you shouldn't keep using it. It's
    nice but I would make sure yours either is exactly the same or totally different.
    Otherwise it just looks like a mistake. Non?"

  body: 'Hmm...yea, it appears to be trying to associate itself with the tourism logo.
    I''d say it either should, in which case you need to bring it in alignment with
    the actual type and style guide, or it needs to be different enough as to not
    be confusing. '

  body: It would be nice if the animals were all contained within the shape. The deer
    has been amputated. And the birds don't stay in the shape at all. And I agree
    with Tim's comments about the letter shapes as well.
