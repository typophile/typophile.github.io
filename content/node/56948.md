  body: "From Adobe's fact sheet on Electra:\r\n\r\nDesigned in 1935 by William Addison
    Dwiggins, Electra has been a standard book typeface since its release because
    of its evenness of design and high legibility. In the specimen book for Electra,
    Dwiggins himself points out the type\u2019s identifying characteristics: \u201CThe
    weighted top serifs of the straight letters of the lower case: that is a thing
    that occurs when you are making formal letters with a pen, writing quickly. And
    the flat way the curves get away from the straight stems: that is a speed product.\u201D
    Electra is not only a fine text face but is equally responsive when set at display
    sizes, realizing Dwiggins\u2019 intent when he set about the design: \u201C...if
    you don\u2019t get your type warm it will be just a smooth, commonplace, third-rate
    piece of good machine technique, no use at all for setting down warm human ideas,
    just a box full of rivets.... I\u2019d like to make it warm, so full of blood
    and personality that it would jump at you.\u201D\r\n\r\nSounds OK to me!"

    what? It's either that they require Helvetica, Baskerville, or Garamond, or people
    just use them frequently. I know some people who use Helvetica almost all the
    time, all caps-no tracking-condensed or all lowercase, light. It's like the coolness
    bandwagon or something."

    I think you hit the nail on the head. I asked in an email if she thought it was
    inappropriate to use Electra, her reply in its entirety was \u201CYES. ach.\u201D
    \r\n\r\nOh well, only 2 or so more years with that.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
