  be printing it two color on either a black or dark gray shirt, possibly with a very
  small tagline or URL on the back. It's fairly final but I'm doing some tweaking,
  I'd love to hear some feedback and crits either way. Thanks.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.figdigital.com/misc/grungeshirt01_rev03.jpg|bigger

  body: "I love the design but do have a few minor suggestions:\r\n\r\nThe kerning
    between the \"P\" and \"A\" of \"passion\" is too loose. Same with the \"e\" and
    \"a\" of real. And I might tighten up the front end of \"emotion\" too.\r\n\r\nThe
    graphic at the lower left corner feels a bit heavy to me. It throws off the balance.
    Perhaps if that particular graphic was a bit transparent (lighter) the balance
    would seem better.\r\n\r\nAgain, these are minor. You did a great job with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Now that you mention it the kerning between \"P\" and \"A\" is killin' me
    :) Good call on the others too, appreciate the feedback. The top splatter mark
    was originally a little more solid which I think balanced the overall design with
    the bottom graphic a bit better. I'll take a look and do a bit of tweaking.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the comments guys, though I don't know that Joe is much of a fan...ah well
    ;)\r\n"
