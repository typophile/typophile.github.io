  me this way.\r\n\r\nOK down to the fun stuff: I need some help identifying a couple
  of fonts that were utilised for service insignia and apparel marking.  I am currently
  putting together a one-off book for a project in my final year at University, the
  content is directly linked with Trench Art my great grandfather made during his
  time at The Somme in WW1.  I really love the two fonts stamped on his old service
  wallet and would like to use them, unfortunately I'm a fontard and can't identify
  them.\r\n\r\nIf anyone out there knows....please don't keep it to yourself :-)\r\n\r\nThanks
  everyone,\r\nDavid.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/service_font_6738.jpg]"

    other is a beaut, but I don't recognize it. Thing is, these would have been bookbinding
    punches, not from the same kind of supplier as for foundry type.\r\nhttp://www.volcanoarts.com/cart/bookbinding/mps.jpg"

  body: Thanks Nick,  I was dreading that about the second font, it's quite lovely
    isn't it! The numbers are especially nice.
