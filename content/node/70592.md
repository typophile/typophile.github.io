  video Mr. Bazargan proposes TeX as a way to render math equations and to handle
  line breaking better through TeX's advanced hyphenation and justification handling.\r\n\r\nTeX
  is apparently ideal because it's light and because many typesetting challenges to
  other engines are just native to TeX. Part of the idea I guess is to extend eBooks
  beyond novels. And that's an interesting area; I read somewhere that Governator
  wants to phase out paper textbooks and use digital books in California schools.\r\n\r\nI'm
  not an expert on any of this, I just see a lot of talk about eBooks and the future
  of reading in the forum. So what do you guys think?"

    the www.libregraphicsmeeting.org so you could chat to him about it there :)

  body: "2 cents from a XeTeX enthusiast: I was amazed at how fast the iPhone is at
    re-rendering the whole document everytime he flipped it by 90\xB0 and back. Definitely
    promising.\r\n\r\nI don't quite understand yet what his plans are in terms of
    licensing. I doubt that with this technique, publishers will sell their ebooks
    as plain TeX files. Or did I miss something? Like a form of encryption?\r\n\r\n(Though
    plain TeX/XML would be a dream. My only experience with a technical ebook \u2013
    a physics textbook \u2013 was a restrictive, flash-based DRM annoyance worth not
    a single penny).\r\n\r\nAnother thing: the fact that TeX itself is very lean (unlike
    InDesign & Co.) is due to its character as a simple macro language. As soon as
    you add so-called \"packages\"*, you can see your TeX/eTeX/LaTeX/XeTeX system
    (some standard distributions with differing inbuilt functionality) quickly grow
    to occupy a couple hundred MB. While most of this sure is overkill for simple
    <em>book</em> typesetting \u2013 after all, we're just going for textbooks \u2013
    there would have to be some sort of standard defining which TeX version and which
    macros come on the iPhone, and which code has to be packaged with the book. (Or
    did I miss something again?)\r\n\r\n* code modules to enable things as simple
    as tables spreading over multiple pages"
