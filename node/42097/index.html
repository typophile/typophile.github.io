<p>[[http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2136/2265525214_e72eaf7640_o.jpg|Three logo concepts]]</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working on logo concepts for a financial institution. The logo is for a forum /program  hosted by this bank
that is focused on financial wealth management for 20-30 year olds. These are high net worth individuals,</p>
<p>The client requested that the logo look &ldquo;current&rdquo; and &ldquo;cutting edge&rdquo; and that it have some appeal to this age bracket. That said, this is a very conservative banking institution . such a request has to be taken in context.</p>
<p>Concept A is about taking MICR characters out of context. These are transit and routing symbols found on checks. I thought it might be interesting to take these symbols&ndash; which are very old school banking, and give them a new spin.</p>
<p>Concept B is supposed to be a visual metaphor for next generation, i.e., the budding of young from parent.</p>
<p>Concept C is supposed to be pretty abstract, and refers somewhat  obliquely to  building  blocks, at the same time the pattern of blocks connect  an &ldquo;N&rdquo;, or an &ldquo;X&rdquo;, or a right-pointing arrowhead</p>
<p>Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. This, as all projects seems to have a deadline of yesterday.</p>
</div>

  
   <div class="comment card m-3">
	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody"><p>I don’t get the MICR feeling from A at all, and it looks too web 2.0. You could make it work by using MICR type and losing the lighting gimmick—which makes little sense when working with a concept rooted in two-dimensions—but the generation you want does not use checks often enough—if ever—to get it.</p>
<p>B is too abstract, and the text treatment is too complicated and distracting to work as a logo.</p>
<p>C could work, but the mark needs tweaking. Dropping the rightmost block will make the wall  concept more obvious, and the perspective needs to be toned down, right now it appears to be curving the mark.</p>
<p>I also think that you should not be breaking up “Next Generation” typographically. It makes little sense from a grammatic perspective, and visually it looks overwrought.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I&rsquo;m not wild for the checkerboard. It reminds me of the Purina logo, not building blocks. I preferred the lower version of A. The rectangles looked like computer keys to me rather than MICR characters (especially with the * in one) Which works for that generation especially in the glowing Mac blue. If you do decide to stick with the checkerboard play more with the type, even try angeling the baseline to parallel the base of the squares. Right now the negative space wedge is uninspired. Good suggestion by James not to break next generation, that was really distracting on your original post.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think that you took the width of the blocks a little too far and putting the text in perspective makes the whole thing lest interesting. I also think you can keep the blocks in a single shade, at least until the details are worked out. Something else to consider is using a very soft lens blur effect to enhance the perspective with less distortion.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>it feels extremely basic. rather than messing with two planes, one plane being the mark and the other being the text as in the latest version, why not working the two planes into the &lsquo;bricks&rsquo;? the type feels weird, wrong and out of perspective in the latest. what if that type had to stand on it&rsquo;s own in a certain instance? i think being skewed takes all the focus off the strength of the mark and places it on some tricknology. i&rsquo;m not a huge fan of that typeface either. especially in this instance. the shapes don&rsquo;t match up, don&rsquo;t make sense and don&rsquo;t really say 20-30 years old to me at all; it looks obvious that the designer and the target audience are not on the same page.</p>
<p>thank about patterns too. could this mark be used in patterns for later applications? could you duplicate it and have it work as a fill? what would that look like? explore you possibilities. it will help define the outcome</p>

<p>Just don&rsquo;t turn the Chevron counter-clockwise 90 degrees, especially with that font.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t get discouraged, keep going.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi everyone: thanks so much for the helpful suggestions.</p>
<p>I tried working only with one cube, to simplify that version as much as possible. The attached is the result of experimenting with the various shapes and their fills.</p>
<p>The type I&rsquo;m struggling with. The chevron&rsquo;s weight, as one of you suggested, demands something to stand up to it. Do any of these seem like they are heading in the right direction?</p>
<p>Cheers, and thanks again.<img src="/images/old-images/NGW_5_6570.jpg" alt=""></p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>In most of these, the logomark looks like an empty cardboard box - not a sign of wealth or stability!  In the ones on the bottom, it looks like a forward arrow with a backward arrow - a sign of stagnance or backwards progress.  I think you should keep it simple - something like the type in 1 or 4, with a chevron weighted to balance it (not so thick).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>As I was working with this mark I thought that it was actually working because the chevron would be seen as a symbol of next/forward, and that it is actually &ldquo;outside of the box&quot;which is also another nice tie in.</p>
<p>So it is interesting to hear this comment about an empty box.I&rsquo;m concerned now.</p>
<p>Do you think this mark is just not working ? Should the mark just be a chevron? I&rsquo;m worried that if that&rsquo;s the case, I am now so far from the original concept of building blocks  that the client might raise some concern (this is an internal client, and i had to show some early work in progress. She agreed with several of the commentors that the dimensional blocks was the direction to pursue).</p>
<p>OK, I&rsquo;ll keep plugging away&hellip;.</p>
