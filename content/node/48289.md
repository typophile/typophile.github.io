    know who they are and often have designers on from where I'm located, Omaha.\r\n\r\nDesign
    Observer should do a podcast, that would make me happy.\r\n\r\nI'm definitely
    now going to give Typeradio a listen for the first time."

  body: I second 36point.com, Krebstar. I've never been anywhere near Omaha, but I've
    listened to these guys' great shows since the very first Be A Design Cast, their
    old show.

    album of 2007 "The Definition of X: The Pick of the Litter". There is many inspiration
    in this aggressive lyrics. Strong for type design work. '
