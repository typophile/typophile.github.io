  body: Hello! Maybe the first thing to check is whether any glyph appears in more
    than one leftside class or more than one rightside class.

  body: There is a button with a yin-yang sign in the Kerning Assistance dialogue
    that helps you detect such kind of mistakes in the class definitions.

    fine. there is no duplicate within the class kern. I have this [f ff] in both
    kern and metric classes, but should work fine anyway I believe..."

  body: "yes, with K.L.help. i copy his solution to keep it here for anybody else:\r\n\r\nYou
    need to do two things --\r\n(1)\r\nGo to the OpenType Panel (which contains the
    feature code)\r\nand delete all the class definitions from the bottom-right\r\npart.\r\n(2)\r\nGo
    to FontLab Options/Preferences (depends on whether you\r\nuse Windows or Mac),\r\nclick
    through the submenus \"General Options\" and \"Unicode\r\nand OpenType\" -- and
    therein activate both options:\r\n\"Add all glyph classes [...]\"\r\nand\r\n\"Do
    not add metrics classes\"\r\n\r\nNow go to the OpenType Panel again and compile.
    Over\r\nhere this worked well without error message."
