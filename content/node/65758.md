  so good. Is there any where I can get help?\r\n\r\nthank you"

    documentation]] shows the basics, in quite short sentences ;-)\r\n\r\nDo you want
    to render the font data yourself as outlines? That's really hard. If you don't
    want to get involved into extremely low level programming, you can always use
    the [[http://www.freetype.org/|FreeType]] libraries to load and rasterize (= convert
    from math outlines to a bitmapped image) fonts. FreeType can create a monochrome
    or grayscale image of any character, so all you have to do is write a function
    to put it up onto your display."

  body: "Thank you Theunis\r\nI do need to get the glyph data to display. FreeType
    is not for me as glyphs can only be got from cmap. I need to get all glyphs even
    if no cmap entry.\r\nI am stuck on glyf table 'flags'. How can I calculate the
    size of flag array?\r\n\r\nJanic"

  body: "Ah -- okay. The [[http://www.microsoft.com/TRUETYPE/OTSPEC/glyf.htm|Microsoft
    page]] is a little less vague on this subject.\r\n\r\nApparently, the number of
    flags should be equal to the number of <em>points</em> in one glyph. However,
    Bit 3 specifies a \"repeat\" of the current flag value, and the number of repeats
    is in the next byte in the same array. So if you have 10 points defining the glyph,
    its flags may be\r\n\r\n0: <em>some flags for pt #0</em>\r\n1: <em>some flags
    for pt #1</em> + \"repeat\" bit set\r\n2: a literal value \"8\"\r\n3: <em>some
    flags for pt #9</em>\r\n\r\n.. so the table only has 4 bytes but defines flags
    for all 10 points.\r\n\r\nAt least, that's what it sounds like. It's not really
    clear from this page what the difference is in \"number of contours\" and \"number
    of points\" -- the number of contours is specifically declared in the first table,
    and the number of points could be the same."
