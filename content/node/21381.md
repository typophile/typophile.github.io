body: Hi everyone. I'm looking for a particular font that looks a lot like the Mrs.
  Eaves Just Ligature but that is for the English alphabet. I love when some of the
  lower cases  connect to one another and am looking for a font that does just that
  with an elegant serif to it. Any recommendations?
