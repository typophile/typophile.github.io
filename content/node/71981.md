  body: 'thanks guys, is there any way to search for fonts based on other fonts apart
    from googling terms like "based on Handel Gothic", I''d be interested to look
    at any fonts that are based on it. Thanks again '

    You can also examine the tags that were assigned to Handel Gothic. Note that you
    can <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/search/tag%3Afuturistic+tag%3Awide+tag%3Asans-serif/fonts/?refby=mfde\">combine
    several tags</a> in a search.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, there are lists that feature
    stylistically similar typefaces, like <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/BauhausFaces5.html\">Mike
    Yanega\u2019s Bauhaus-Style Guide</a> or <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/genres/star_trek/\">FontShop\u2019s
    Star Trek FontList</a>.\r\n\r\nAnother way that often is promising: search Typophile
    for terms like \u2018<a href=\"site:typophile.com/node similar Handel\">similar
    to Handel</a>\u2019."
