  it, but I think I ight have missed something because it was done really quickly.
  Hope you like it!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/romar2_3942.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/romar_6675.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/romar3_5978.jpg]"

  body: "On the first one, the kerning between \"n\" and \"c\" could be hair tighter.\r\n\r\nWhat
    is the significance of the \\?\r\n\r\nIs it all lowercase because this type doesn't
    have uppercase? I think it could benefit from capital letters."

  body: The typeface is made by me and doesn't have uppercase yet, but even if it
    had I wouldn't have used them. I fined that capitals tend to stand out to much
    and take away the unity in shape. The backslash is simply to create a strong and
    recognizable image.

    don't have a \"unified shape.\"\r\n\r\n<em>The backslash is simply to create a
    strong and recognizable image.</em>\r\n\r\nDoes it pertain to anything in the
    logo or with the company? It seems kind of disconnected  from the logotype, and
    the company as a whole. I think something more thought out should go in there
    instead of something just stuck there \"to create a strong and recognizable image.\""

  body: "I feel like all of these decisions have no rhyme or reason...\r\n\r\nWhy
    would a financial company need a stencil? If that ends up being its brand, that's
    fine, but the type in the last one is pretty unsettling. U&lc R's in one word,
    a lowercase f and capital C that have stencil holes for no reason, etc., and the
    counter of the capital R doesn't have a stencil hole. So far, your second version
    is the best choice."
