  body: Go away from the computer and start over again. Its just poor, it doesn't
    say High Tech or IT. Its just being cleaver for cleaver's sake. Make a logo clearly
    communicate what the business is all about as much as you can and have a positioning
    line to reinforce the new mark. Don't be cute be blunt. Dan

  body: You have 2 different ideas happening here. I like the profile, and I like
    the idea of personalizing an IT firm (since they all tend to have swooshes, globes,
    and digital looking things flying around in their logos), but as Dan said, try
    to communicate what the business is about, what sets them apart? Is it personal
    service? Experience? What is their specialty. Of course, a logo should IDENTIFY
    and not EXPLAIN, so you don't need to depict an example of their service, but
    the SPIRIT of the company. If a figure/person is a core idea to who they are then
    choose either the profile, or a figure and work with it, but right now it isn't
    working. Best of luck.
