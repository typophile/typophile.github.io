  designing a four page brochure in indesign. The client has informed me that the
  printer used will be a 'xerox hard ink phaser'. \r\n\r\nI am presuming that the
  colour set-up should be rgb for this printer? Can anyone confirm this?\r\n\r\nAlso,
  this piece doesn't use any photos, but does use artwork that i have created in illustrator
  and brought over to indesign. Does this mean that dpi is not an issue? If it is
  then what dpi should my illustrator images be set to?\r\n\r\nThanks for any help
  and please excuse my newbie-ignorance.\r\nJonny"

    a vector graphic stays vector \u2013 as opposite to raster graphics image or 'bitmap'
    (\"brought over\" teachnically shouldn't be used) \u2013 you do not have a dpi
    issue, that will be resolved by the Xerox machine as its maximum."

    quality was horrendous. Black text was pretty bad as well. Be careful.

    from that intended, or that it was just poor quality?\r\n\r\nThanks for the info,Alessandro.
    i thought that rgb was for computer printers and cmyk for 'professional' printers(again
    i dont know the technical term)\r\njonny."

    printers ...</cite>\r\n\r\nTo make it a bit more complicated ... Virtually every
    desktop printer also works internally with CMYK. However, because the printer
    mnf know most people cannot be bothered to learn color conversion (and use Word,
    which only <em>has</em> an RGB mode), the internal RIP is actually optimized for
    its own RGB-to-CMYK conversion. That depends on a lot of things, such as ink color
    (inks are never a pure color) and ink density. I have seen in practice that printing
    an image directly from Photoshop in CMYK mode gave a poorer result than the same
    image in RGB mode. That's just because the printer internal conversion is better
    than Photoshop's.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you should just try, and bet on RGB first, as
    that probably comes out better than CMYK."
