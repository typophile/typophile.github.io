  body: That looks like the Walker font, which is not distibuted or sold -- it was
    designed for the <a href="http://www.walkerart.org">Walker Art Center</a> as their
    signature font.

  body: It&#39;s similar, but that&#39;s not Walker. The join in the R is different,
    and Matthew Carter would not draw an N that poorly. <BR> <BR><a href="http://artserver.cfa.cmu.edu/~miller/exhibitions/Carter/Images/walker2.jpg"

  body: The N does look a little fishy. <BR> <BR>David, where did you find this sample?
