  body: "Do you speak of the OS/2 table version number?\r\n\r\nI assume you generate
    PostScript-flavor (or CFF) OpenType fonts with FLS5, in which case the OS/2 table
    version number always is 2. (Even if you set 3 in the options/preferences.)\r\nConsider
    it as information rather than a warning.\r\n\r\nKarsten"
