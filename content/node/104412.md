  We are running into issues in which fonts that have worked in every OS for a decade
  suddenly aren't working. It seems to be involved with naming conventions. It seems
  to be font names which are over 29 characters or have any non-alphnumeric characters
  are failing. Unfortunately, since we don't have access to a machine which runs OS
  10.7, troubleshooting is problematic. The symptom of the failure is that the font
  does not appear as available for selection. This is happening in Indesign and Illustrator
  CS6.\r\n"
