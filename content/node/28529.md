  two things, and it seem s that there's allways somebody typophile that knows the
  answers.\r\n\r\n1. I'm looking fo some kind of design events i NYC this Autumn.
  Anything will go, - it will let my company pay the trip :-)\r\n\r\n2. And as important
  as the first. A place to stay for a week. Not to expensive, some kind of internet
  connection (need to work a bit), some where on Manhatten. Any thing will do, small
  room, studio, penthouse apartment ...\r\n\r\nI'm not locked on any dates yet so
  I'm pretty flexible!\r\n\r\nBest regards\r\n\r\nNicolaj"

  body: "1.  Two exhibits are on at The Grolier Club (47 East 60th Street, between
    Park and Madison Avenues) you might find interesting:\r\n\r\nUntil November 4:
    Miniature Designer Bookbindings from the collection of Neale M. Albert. (Second
    floor gallery)\r\n\r\nUntil November 25: Guild of Book Workers Centenary Exhibition.
    A retrospective of work by notable Guild members, curated by Peter Verheyen, and
    an exhibition of contemporary work, juried by Karen Hanmer, Richard Minsky, and
    Don Rash. \r\n\r\nand not far away at China Institute Gallery, 125 East 65th Street....\r\n\r\nUntil
    November 11: Reinventing Books in Contemporary Chinese Art examines the influence
    of traditional Chinese books and albums in contemporary Chinese art, bringing
    together a carefully selected group of art books and book-inspired works created
    since the 1930s. \r\n\r\nAnd I'm assuming you're going to visit Pearl Paints,
    Talas, and all the other wonderful supply shops.  ;-)  I'm jealous.\r\n\r\n2.
    \ When I lived in NYC, I usually put visitors into private B&B/homestays in Manhattan
    (I lived in Queens <em>sigh</em>) -- I'm sure Google's got lots of suggestions!\r\n\r\nLinda"
