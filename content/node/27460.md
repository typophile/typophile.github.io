body: "Hi\r\nThis word mark isn't a comercial work. Its intended to work as a mark
  for the concept I've been illustrating on my free-times.\r\nThe characters I've
  drawn for the word mark \"SHAPERS\" are based on the idea of molding, shaping, metal
  or some other similar material. \r\nI'd appreciate some advice/feedback concerning
  the H character specifically since I couldn't get it to fit this concept, but also
  on the remaining characters draw and the word respective kerning.\r\nThe typeface
  on the sentence below is Plexes by Dino dos Santos. However, probably I'll get rid
  of it.\r\n\r\nBest Regards\r\nDave"

    'a'. Tell us more about \"SHAPERS\" - what does the business do?\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    body: "Hi, Thanks for the tip Lex, I'll try it and see how it looks.\r\n\r\nWell,
      actually SHAPERS stands for nothing other than a personal non-profitable project
      which evolves several illustrations done by me depicting the concept of shaping
      forms, digital forms in this case. Therefore, Shapers are the ones who do that,
      who shape the forms.\r\nI felt like I could try and work on a word mark for
      the whole thing just for the fun of it, rather than something as serious as
      a client work.\r\n\r\nCheers"

  body: "I think it's nice. I agree with Lex about the 'A'. The 'H' is a difficult
    shape, not as fluent as the rest, you need three strokes to complete it.\r\n\r\nBut
    I think your solution is OK, I mean, it's not distracting or whatsoever and it
    covers your idea explained."

    the image i read it shopers..but when i saw the tag line under the logo i thought
    ...it must be shapers..which exactly it is..but there shouldn't be any confusion
    specially in the logo kind of thing. changing A > a might solve the problem.\r\n\r\nsatya\r\n\r\n"

  body: "You could try altering the angle at the bottom of the A but the base type
    seems to need quite a lot sorting out, where the inside curves become sharp and
    the gaps between strokes, the diagonal of the S looks a bit light, the H needs
    work to fit in with the other characters.\r\nTim"

    body: "Hello All\r\n\r\nTim, thanks for the advices. \r\n\r\nI haven't had that
      much time to work on this during this week. Although I made some changes here
      and there. \r\nI've made all the inside corners into curves mainly cause I didn't
      had a strong reason to keep some sharp and some rounded.\r\nI've also worked
      on S, R, P and E characters strokes. On the A, I've tried the lowercase solution
      but it seemed out of place, so I tried to make it look more triangular in order
      to resemble more an A than an O. \r\nThe H, I still gotta find a solution to
      make it work here.\r\n\r\nKeep the comments coming. They're appreciated.\r\n\r\nBest
      Regards\r\nDave\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/shap_5202.jpg]"

  body: "Perhaps you could close the counter of the P more like the A (or open the
    opening for the A slightly) the two together look strange with different gaps.
    For the H you could look at combining two curved sections, for example the vertical
    of the E where it makes the centre bar. The S's are better but I think you can
    still work on the curves on the outside they seem to start too far up the diagonal.\r\nTim"
