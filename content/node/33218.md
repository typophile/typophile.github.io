    a standard set of glyphs, like Mac Roman, Win 1252 and so on.\r\n\r\nRalf\r\n"

  body: "Generally, Adobe's \"Std\" fonts lack the extended language support that
    you find in their \"Pro\" fonts.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, they are not necessarily
    limited to a small glyph set. Depending on the font, they may have many glyphs
    more than you'd expect: for example, Poetica is a \"Std\" face, but has a great
    number of alternate glyphs, Kepler is Std, but has ornaments, small caps and swashes."
