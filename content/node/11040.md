body: I have had the frequent problem with Impact corrupting. I needed it to modify
  existing files created prior to my hiring. Does ayone have alternatives to suggest
  instead of Impact? <BR> <BR>Perhaps Compacta or House Gothic? Any others?

    Sans, and other &#34;defaults&#34; -- there&#39;s a  <BR>lot of potential here!
