  I'm developing. My question is: which glyphs must I add? Unicode tables have archaic
  letters and additional signs I suppose are not necessary (at least, not all of them).\r\n\r\nWhat
  I think to add:\r\n\r\n<strong>Greek</strong>\r\n0374\r\n0375\r\n037A\u201303CE\r\n1F00\u20131FFF\r\n\r\n<strong>Cyrillic</strong>\r\n0400\u2013045F\r\n048A\u201304F9\r\n\r\nThis
  is enough? Am I missing something?\r\n\r\nBesides this, I'd like to know about serif
  fonts with good design for Greek and Ciryllic alphabets. I believe Minion is one
  of these, but it would be great to have others to analyse and research their typographical
  solutions for non-Latin glyphs.\r\n"

  body: "<cite>why not use the Greek and Cyrillic characters that are part of the

    shows a partial sequence of Greek and Cyrillic characters included in Unicode.
    I want to know about these additional characters \u2013like U+0384 or U+049A\u2013
    in order to decide if they must be included in the font.\r\n\r\nFor example: WGL4
    does not includes any glyph from 1F00 to 1FFF range. I'd like to understand if
    and why and when these chracters are need in Greek so I can do a correct choice."

  body: "For Cyrillic, I did a bunch o' research on the different languages needing
    different characters, for Adobe. Results are posted here:\r\nhttp://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2006/08/defining_an_ext.html\r\n\r\nSee
    also my and Miguel's work on extended Latin character sets:\r\nhttp://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2008/08/extended_latin.html\r\n\r\nFor
    Greek, the #1 decision you need to make is whether to support polytonic Greek
    or only monotonic. Polytonic is used for classical Greek, but was also used for
    Greek in general prior to 1982. I gather reproducing or reprinting work from 1982
    or earlier can require it.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: In regard to Greek, for basic minimal support of monotonic Greek you need
    all the characters highlighted <em>except</em> 037A through 037D and 03CF. However,
    in addition to these you may also need 03DB, 03DF, and 03E1, which are used for
    old-fashioned numbering (much like Roman numerals in Latin script). And, if you
    have OT code for case-switching, you will need the uppercase equivalents of those
    also.

  body: "Thomas and David, thank you <strong>very</strong> much! Your information
    is really welcome.\r\n\r\nFor a font with many Latin extended characters, small
    caps, petite caps, swashes, figurine variants and alternates, I think that support
    for polytonic Greek is the only logical choice \u2013 although this means a lot
    of additional work.\r\n\r\nWhat about small caps and petite caps for Greek and
    Cyrillic? Is there any documentation or example to research? Must I use the same
    criteria applied to Latin?"

  body: "For overall style of Greek, to go with a contemporary serif design like your
    Latin, you might look at Minion and Constantia as helpful examples of good design
    for the basic characters, but you should also look at Parachute's fonts for what
    contemporary Greek designers are doing. By contrast, Garamond Premier has a very
    nice design, but it's very traditional - like Garamond in general - so not as
    suited to your Latin. The most important choice is what balance you make between
    respecting the distinctive qualities of Greek script versus harmonizing the style
    with your Latin.\r\n\r\nSmall caps (and thus also petite caps) in Greek work the
    same way as in Latin, except that you have to do more complex OpenType coding
    to get the diacritics to behave correctly, especially in polytonic Greek. In particular,
    diacritics are mostly not used on text set in all caps or all small caps, but
    they are used on uppercase letters in mixed upper/lowercase setting. Also, watch
    out for the difference between iota subscript (ypogegrammeni) and iota adscript
    (prosgegrammeni)."

    Octava is more near to my approach than Centro. Both are very good suggestions.\r\n\r\nI'm
    still in doubt if my font is worth so much effort to add all these language support.
    My first idea was just to create a font for personal use \u2013and I'm still unsure
    if a commercial release would interest other people. But when I begun to design
    one of these \"strange\" non-Latin glyphs I cannot stop. It's a challenge to make
    it coherent to the remaining design.\r\n\r\nAnd some Greek and Cyrillic characthers
    are really beautiful. Actually, I <em>want</em> to design Omegas, Phis, Des, Zhes
    and so on.  :-)"

  body: "Igor, \r\n\r\nthere are at least three Cyrillic extensions of Charter: \r\n*
    the official ITC Charter Cyrillic, published by ParaType, designed by Vladimir
    Yefimov\r\n* Charis SIL, designed and published by SIL International, based on
    an opensource version of Bitstream Charter\r\n* Khartiya, designed by Andrey Panov,
    based on the same opensource version of Charter BT\r\n\r\nI strongly prefer Vladimir
    Yefimov's version. Charis SIL is quite poor, Panov's version is adequate but not
    as good as Yefimov's, which is just great. I believe Yefimov's Charter Cyrillic
    is one of the best Cyrillic text faces available. In fact, the Russian edition
    of Bringhurst's \"The Elements of Typographic Style\" is set in it, while the
    original version is set in Minion. Matthew Carter also once told me that he is
    quite fond of Yefimov's Cyrillic for Charter. \r\n\r\n"
