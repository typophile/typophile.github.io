    typeface when the masses have to make do with retail.\r\n\r\nAnd it would have
    had to be used only for expensive, limited edition publications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: ">Is there any type of consensus \r\n\r\nThe answer to that would be no--on
    almost every topic, including type. However, judging by revivals, the variations
    on Garamond seem to be the most numerous. Other names that have become classics
    or standards that are still used widely: Jenson, Griffo (Bembo), Caslon, Baskerville,
    Didot, Bodoni. "

    luxury.

  body: "If \u2018luxury\u2019 is something ostentatious, opulent and lavish; a disproportionate
    expense that is made just for fun & pomp \u2013 then I don\u2019t agree that TEFF
    & DTL are luxurious. Well, their pricing is quite high and thus their fonts sometimes
    seem to be unattainable; but \u2018expensive\u2019 is not the same as \u2018luxurious\u2019,
    is it?\r\n\r\nGo to a Dutch bookstore and sift through a couple of books (or news
    papers!) \u2026 do you really think all of them that are set in Lexicon or Haarlemmer
    convey a touch of luxury?\r\n\r\nIf you meant purchasing the TEFF library and
    then not using it (\u201Conly to look at\u201D), then I have to agree; that would
    be very luxurious!"

  body: When I think of the terms "type" and "luxurious," I always have a picture
    in my mind of large, flourished, swashes, handmade strokes, something like Scriptina
    or Zapfino Extra, something of the sort..... don't really know why, just my crazy
    associations :-)
