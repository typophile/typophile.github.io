  body: Andrew I have a problem with the name. Cyber Camp sounds like a porno site.
    I think you need the word camp with cyber and a slogan that puts it in context.
    But that is marketing not just design. In terms of what you are working on it
    looks fresh and very sharp and pointy. No problems with your Cyber&#39;s

  body: I was thinking it could be humorous to do a bitmap version of the cliche <a
    href="http://simplythebest.net/fonts/fonts/woodbadge.html">log lettering</a> so
    often found in campville. Might be a tall order, but it could be sweet if you
    can pull it off. <BR> <BR>Randy

  body: Kids like to be hip and techo but Randy has a neat idea what if you  combined
    the two ideas. Maybe your techno Cyber is cut into a log

  body: Wow! Porno and Kids don&#39;t mix. I hadn&#39;t made that association. Cybercamp
    runs  <BR>during the summertime from mid June to late July. It has just completed
    its 4th year,  <BR>so if the porno association has been made, no one has complained
    about it.  <BR> <BR>While learning computers is certainly the focus, <BR>games
    and crafts are done throughout the day sessions.  <BR> <BR>Randy, can you explain
    your idea further.. It sounds interesting. The wood  <BR>lettering is cliche,
    but I&#39;m open to the idea. <BR> <BR>Signed, <BR> <BR>Lost but curious

  body: It feels like it is falling over or down to the right. Maybe drop the capital
    &#34;C&#34; a bit and/or make it larger &#40;swallowing the &#34;y&#34;?&#41;
    to weight the left side a little more. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott

  body: I like it because I would have expected some sort of cheesy digital or techno
    typeface... I&#39;m grooving on the colors. Earthtones are the way to go, in my
    opinion. <BR> <BR>Maybe you can get a board and use a power drill or router and
    gouge the name out by hand? Or some balsa and use a woodcarver&#39;s knife?

    John,  <BR> <BR>thats a really great idea. Worth doing. <BR> <BR>Gatis,  <BR>
    <BR>I have kind of put this project on the back burner. The E,A, and M all feel
    funky to me still. <BR>Working on library signage and budget campaign <BR>right
    now. <BR> <BR>Thanks for the feedback. <BR> <BR>Andrew <BR> <BR>
