  that of the individual. So, once again, I turn to typophile for suggestions. \r\n\r\nI'm
  looking for a great, black or bold weighted, legible typeface to use for subheads
  in a brand new, high end magazine I'm currently designing. I would like it to have
  minor traits of art deco without compromising its legibility. I have something in
  mind for the layout that requires the chosen typeface to be on the bold side. \r\n\r\nAny
  suggestions are appreciated and thanks in advance!"
