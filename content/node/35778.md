  body: "It has an Art Nouveau feeling, but the closest genuine typeface from that
    era I found that was similar was called Fantasie Noire from Peignot (shown in
    Petzendorfer's book in Plate 32). However, it is not any more than similar.  My
    guess is that this may have been inspired by Art Nouveau, but may be custom drawn
    for this logo. (In other words, I do not recognize it as a font I have seen.)\r\n\r\n-
