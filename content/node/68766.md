  body: I was going to say Avant Garde too, but I looked and I think the /k/ in this
    sample is different than the Avant Garde /k/. Do you think its an alternate glyph,
    an altered Avant Garde, or another font all together? I tried looking for another
    font that would work like this and Avant Garde is still the closest I can come.

  body: I thought it was Avant Garde, too. Could it be [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/gothic/urw-gothic/|URW
    Gothic]]?

  body: "The original version of Avant Garde has a \"k\" like that in the lighter
    weights. You can still see it in some cuts (such as the <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/avant-garde-gothic/?testdrive=custom%3D0%26dock%3Dfalse%26size%3D52%26w%3D600%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3Dkent%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3D%26seed%3D30\">ITC
    version</a> Monotype carries).\r\n\r\nAdobe did a multiple master version during
    the '90s. This required that inconsistencies like this among weights be eliminated.
    The multiple master version is long gone, but the enforced consistencies still
    remain in their version. The cap \"R\" is another example (victim?).\r\n\r\nSo,
    yes, this is Avant Garde, but some versions available don't match."
