  font used in the Swedish magazine \"P\xE5 stan\" for a while. I tried the \u201Cwhat
  the font\u201D- search engine at myfonts after separating the letters a bit but
  came up with nothing. I have attached an image showing various headlines copied
  from their website (pastan.nu).\r\n\r\nI'm now begging you guys for help, hoping
  you might know what typeface is used. \r\n\r\n// Oskar\r\n"
