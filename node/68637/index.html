		<div class="commentbody">This is mostly for the sake of conversation, but… I wonder what the implications are of the following statement from the announcement:

<cite>We have acquired the design act in itself and as we will feature it in different typefaces, we will note each time the specific typeface as if we were indicating the materials that a physical object is made of.</cite>

For instance, I've seen some EULAs that explicitly forbid using the font to create work whose primary function is reliant on that specific typeface (e.g. alphabet stamps, monograms, sometimes even logotypes are forbidden). I did a bit of pondering on the topic in relation to the series of <a href=http://blog.myfonts.com/83>glyph t-shirts</a> I designed for MyFonts a while ago.

I rather doubt that many type producers would complain if the MoMA were to highlight their typeface with full credits, but I'm curious about what people think of the comparison between typefaces and other more traditional materials, like oil paint or charcoal.</div>

AFAIK, a fellow called named Tomlinson was responsible for the conceptualization ("design act") of the @ symbol (applying the old @ symbol to email addresses), so I don't see how MoMA can acquire it from him, except by unilateral declaration of annexation.

It is the act of curation, not initial creation, that the MoMA curator is appropriating as her own, a power-play for herself and her profession,  claiming centre stage for the latest reiteration of the tired old discourse, "But is it art?"</div>

		<div class="commentbody">OK, I hadn't read that.
But MOMA's recognition of him doesn't alter my contention that MoMA cannot "acquire" his repurposing.
Unless one agrees with its claim that it's theirs because they said so.

MOMA is recognizing his concept, and cannot own or acquire it.
It's Tomlinson's, and he hasn't sold it to MOMA.

However, I'm not going to engage in this futile discussion any more, because that's the game that the curator is playing, which validates her position, which is meaningless and banal IMHO.

I think it's unlikely that any featured typeface designer will object to seeing their @ cast in carbon fiber, concrete or plutonium. But you know they're going to pick totally uninspired set of fonts to reflect the mundane and utilitarian nature of the mark. If they don't pick Helvetica and Lucida Grande I'll be shocked.
