body: "I've been seeing a change in the way Illustrator handles contextual ending
  letters and wondered what's different. I used to use a lookup in the calt feature
  and it would only work with end of words followed by a space. End of lines used
  to never work because of the nature of text strings. \r\n\r\nHere is what I use
  for a code:\r\n\r\nfeature calt {\r\n     lookup calt_y.end1 {\r\n     ignore sub
  y' @ Letters;\r\n     sub y' space by y.end1;\r\n     } calt_y.end1;\r\n} calt;\r\n\r\nThe
  space character BTW is NOT included in @Letters. Normally the ending y should only
  be triggered when followed by a space, but for some reason it does this at ends
  of lines also where there is no space character following. Last year I was doing
  this in CS4 as well, but there was a software update since then and now it behaves
  differently. Normally having an ending character at the end of lines and words both
  wouldn't be a problem, but since its contextual and there are ending swqsh letters
  in the stylistic sets as well, it makes it harder for a user to sub the swash ends
  without turning the calt feature off first.\r\n\r\n"

    end character only at the end of words followed by a space. This particular font
    is not mine, but a friend's at American Greetings. I'm helping with code. All
    my past experience proved futile to get any character to sub at the end of a line
    contextually. Now suddenly its doing it when I don't expect it. Another font that
    I did digitize for her last year is now behaving that same way in Illustrator
    but didn't before. \r\n\r\nMy understanding was that because of the nature of
    a text string there was no way to get the font to recognize contextually that
    its the end of a line."

    as follow:\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\nlookup cswh10 {\r\n<ol>\r\n  ignore sub @fina1' [@letter_define];\r\n
    \ sub @fina1' by @fina2;\r\n</ol>\r\n} cswh10;\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<strong>@fina2</strong>
    is a class where the endings were placed.\r\n\r\nSo far this works fine in Indesign,
    but I'm not yet sure if this fiture can generally be accessed in several other
    software which supporting OT\r\n\r\nBest regards.\r\nawm"

  body: "I'm also having the same problem with desired swash NOT showing up at the
    end of the string.\r\n\r\nIt seems Illustrator reads end of the text string as
    \"space\". \r\nSo I used:\r\n<code> \r\nignore sub @ending @letter;\r\nignore
    sub @ending space @letter;\r\nsub @letter' space by @ending;\r\nsub @letter by
    @ending;\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nBut now I get swashes at the end of EVERY line.\r\nAnd
    I don't understand the solution stated here... :("

  body: "@ Minerva\r\n\r\nyou need to put apostrophes in the ignore sub as well as
    the sub, but I'm not sure what you're trying to achieve with the second ignore
    substitution - looks like you don't want the @letter to change to an @ending AFTER
    a space, but it should be the opposite - you want it to replace BEFORE a space.\r\n\r\n@
    Stephen\r\n\r\nIs there a reason you would only want it to change to an endform
    before a space?  Why not have endforms at the ends of lines, before punctuation
    etc etc.  That'd be easy, because you'd just get rid of the space from sub y'
    space by y.end1;\r\n"

  body: "I don't think you can do that in OpenType today. Sorry.\r\n\r\nUnless of
    course the layout engines allow the hard return character to participate in OpenType
    shaping. But I'd be surprised if that was normal/common behavior across layout
    engines. But even that wouldn't be enough, if you want the feature to also work
    when the end of paragraph is also the end of the document or text block... you'd
    need to be able to detect app-inserted soft returns as well, which seems even
    more unlikely.\r\n\r\nIf my belief above is correct, it would take very active
    application support to make such a feature work, because only the application
    knows whether the last character on the line is the end of just the line, or the
    end of the paragraph. The regular OpenType contextual workings aren't enough to
    handle that.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"
