body: "Hey guys, i'm to take over as creative designer for a company called 'Light
  & Life', they've sent me their logo, but i'd really like to try and track down what
  fonts where used, if they're actual fonts and not just a logo design specifically
  for the company. I have identified the '&' sign as the BYINGTON BOLD font, but the
  fonts used (again, if they ARE fonts) for the words 'Light' and 'Life' have left
  me clueless - any thoughts chaps?...\r\nAny help would be GREATLY appreciated.\r\nCheers
