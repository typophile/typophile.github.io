  including &#34;what letterspacing optimizes readability?&#34; There is a <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/69050.html?1112843077">new
  thread</a> continuing the investigation into the human visual system, but I&#39;d
  really like to see the spacing discussion continued. <BR> <BR>There&#39;s a small
  thread entitled <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/65756.html?1109340581">Theory
  of Spacing</a>, worth referencing if for no other reason than Nick Shinn&#39;s beautiful
  graphic illustrating his own approach to spacing. <BR> <BR>In context of Kernus,
  here are some observations and opinions I&#39;d like to offer. <BR> <BR>I think
  what Adobe is doing is slowly recovering from the loss of optical scaling in the
  transition from metal to digital. You see that with their release of optically scaled
  families &#40;such as Slimbach&#39;s brand new Garamond Premier&#41;, but I think
  Kernus also plays a role, for the probable case where the font is not available
  in optically scaled variants. <BR> <BR>To briefly sum up what I&#39;ve learned about
  Benton&#39;s optical scaling technology implemented about 100 years ago, there are
  four major things that happen to a font as the size scales down: <BR> <BR>1. The
  stroke weight increases, essentially implemented by stroking the outline with a
  fixed-width circular pen. Doing it this way also has the important effect of reducing
  stroke contrast. For example, let&#39;s say that the font at large sizes has a 2:1
  stroke contrast, and at 6pt the thin and thick strokes are 5 and 10 mils, respectively.
  Let&#39;s also say that the radius of the circular pen is 2 mils. Then the resulting
  strokes are 9 and 14 mils, a contrast of approximately 1.5:1. <BR> <BR>2. The width
  increases, based on linear nonuniform scaling &#40;the same affine transform technology
  responsible for Squooshing, implemented using pantographs&#41;. <BR> <BR>3. Extenders
  &#40;particuarly descenders&#41; shorten, or to put it another way, the x-height
  increases. <BR> <BR>4 &#40;and most important to this thread&#41;. The fit becomes
  looser. <BR> <BR>I haven&#39;t collected serious data yet &#40;I need to code up
  some tools to extract spacing from scans&#41;, but from eyeballing the ATF books,
  I&#39;m sure that that the looser fit is not just a matter of adding the same hairline
  space between each letter pair &#40;or, equivalently, adding half that space to
  the left and right side of each letter&#41;. Rather, I believe that both large and
  small sizes were fit individually. <BR> <BR>At text sizes, I consider the ATF fonts
  a landmark example of good fit; in other words, I believe that the fit is better
  than the majority of digital faces available today. Most strikingly, the fit is
  good even for difficult words such as &#34;power&#34;; today you would expect even
  color in this word without additional kerning of the &#34;ow&#34; pair. See <a href="http://levien.com/type/atf_1923/p0536_sm.jpg">p.
  536</a> of the ATF 1923 book &#40;Century Catalogue&#41; for example. <BR> <BR>At
  larger sizes, the fit is not nearly so good &#40;see, for example, the very uneven
  &#34;power&#34; in the 18-point sample on <a href="http://levien.com/type/atf_1923/p0537_sm.jpg">p.
  537</a>, but I believe it is still close to the best that can be done given the
  limitations of metal. <BR> <BR>I believe that the perception of the space between
  letters is dependent on scale. At text sizes, I believe the eye sees mostly the
  space between the strokes &#40;as is emphasized by Tracy&#39;s &#34;Letters of Credit&#34;
  approach and this <a href="http://www.typeculture.com/academic_resource/articles_essays/pdfs/tc_article_20.pdf">tutorial</a>&#41;.
  Serifs have a relatively minor contribution. <BR> <BR>At larger sizes, I think the
  perception of spacing incorporates more delicate features of the lettershapes, particularly
  serifs. In other words, the perception of space between letters is more closely
  approximated by the actual length of the gap between the two letters. To set &#34;noonn&#34;
  tightly requires shaving a lot more space from the &#34;no&#34; and &#34;on&#34;
  pairs than from &#34;oo&#34;. I&#39;ll illustrate: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/69118.png"

  <BR> <BR>To my eyes, at 12pt, Adobe Caslon Std looks just fine with the metrics,
  or with no kerning at all &#40;the metrics call for -5 on the &#34;on&#34; pair&#41;.
  InDesign&#39;s optical kerning feature shaves 13 from &#34;no&#34;, 14 from &#34;on&#34;,
  and adds 6 to &#34;nn&#34;. To my eyes, this is not an improvement; it makes the
  &#34;on&#34; and &#34;no&#34; appear crowded. <BR> <BR>At 72pt, though, the story
  is altogether different. Not only is the fit too loose, but the &#34;no&#34; and
  &#34;on&#34; pairs appear gappy. Applying -30 tracking helps with the overall looseness,
  but makes the relative &#34;no&#34; and &#34;on&#34; gaps that much worse. The &#34;optical
  kerning&#34; feature here does almost exactly the right thing. <BR> <BR>Combining
  tracking and optical kerning does not always yield good results. Adding &#43;17
  tracking &#40;to keep the oo pair at the same spacing as the original&#41; works
  well, but -20 tracking &#40;for an overall tight effect&#41; does not. The &#34;oo&#34;
  pair is too close for comfort relative to the rest of the word. I included a hand-spaced
  tight setting for comparison. <BR> <BR>From all this, I draw these conclusions:
  <BR> <BR>1. Optimal fit is highly scale dependent -- the smaller, the looser. <BR>
  <BR>2. The perception of space is also scale dependent -- the larger, the more delicate
  features such as serifs affect the perception of space. <BR> <BR>3. Adding constant
  tracking to a good fit at one scale yields a bad fit at a different scale. This
  fact strongly supports conclusion 2. <BR> <BR>Unless one is designing a Multiple
  Master font or an optically scaled series, current digital font technology forces
  a &#34;one size fits all&#34; approach. Kernus is an improvement in that it will
  space a single font fairly well at different scales, but is still not as good as
  hand-fitting with the size taken into account. <BR> <BR>I must say that this has
  been quite a learning experience for me. It was bad enough when I&#39;d start tuning
  out the world around me because I was distracted by letterforms, but now I find
  myself constantly looking at the spaces between letters. A casual observer could
  easily conclude that I&#39;m out of my mind. I look forward to continuing this discussion
  with the rest of you out there who are obsessed at looking at what isn&#39;t there.'

  body: Raph, although I agree with your approach to discerning correct optical values,
    that is, studying how ATF did it, I have several points of divergence. <BR> <BR>1.
    You are likely to see better examples of optical compensation in some Monotype
    and Linotype families because ATF fonts were often optically sized from a single
    master drawing using expert manipulations of the pantograph. Mac McGrew has been
    extremely informative on this point, though I don&#39;t think he has published
    everything he knows. I don&#39;t really think anything can beat the achievements
    of the Mono and Lino drawing offices _when they were at their best_. I would rashly
    and roughly place peak points as the late 20s for Mono and the mid 50s for Lino.  <BR>
    <BR>2. There has always been a distressing tendency amongst good designers and
    technicians to space o shapes too widely. Adobe Caslon is but one of a countless
    thousands of examples. By contrast, Benton, at the end and apotheosis of his career
    was spacing o&#39;s very tightly, as for example in his last completed typeface,
    Benton. This is the approach I prefer, but it is not a majority position.  <BR>
    <BR>3. Adobe Caslon is not a good example for setting at 72 points because it
    is explicitly designed not to be used about 14 points. &#40;It would be interesting
    to see what Indy does to a variety of words with Big Caslon at 72 points.&#41;  <BR>
    <BR>4. Confining the test only to no/on combinations does not begin to show the
    problems &#39;optical kerning&#39; can get you into. Comparison should also be
    made at a variety of type sizes. It is not necessary to go to the trouble of illustrating
    every combination, since the curious can easily replicate the settings on their
    own computers. <BR> <BR>5. Adobe has never in the past been able to make a proper
    optically scaled font because of the corporate mandate to ensure that 72 point
    type is usable at 6 point, and vice versa. This idiot proofing of the product
    is understandable but should be dropped. Has it been dropped in the new Garamond?
    I doubt it. I&#39;ve had it sitting on the shelf for months and I suppose I will
    now actually have to look at it.  <BR> <BR>6. An ideal optical axis is not achievable
    with simple interpolation as we know it. Perhaps with EvB&#39;s superpolation,
    but that&#39;s another story. That&#39;s a technology I have been meaning to explore
    for some time. In any case, the new Garamond is of course a multiple master, even
    though just a few instances are being sold in the OT version. But notably, it
    was designed as two entirely separate MMs, one for text sizes, and one for display.
    That said, I do not see how even the most expert manipulation of MM technology
    can produce an ideal scale in the 6-12 point range. It is for this reason that
    Stone does not use it in his Cycles series, which is the closest we come in digital
    to a series of types drawn with the same attention to size optimization as was
    routine before 1960.

  body: 'Thanks for your response, Bill. <BR> <BR>1. More master drawings does not
    always equal better. In fact, one of the things I find appealing about the ATF
    Bodoni series is its butter-smooth consistency across the entire size range. Bodoni
    is well suited to this consistency, while of course for a Garamond you have to
    make the counters smaller at bigger sizes and so on. <BR> <BR>What specific Mono
    and Lino fonts do you consider do be more technically skillful than the best of
    the ATF fonts? My Lino book is from the early &#39;30s, and has some pretty good
    examples but nothing that really blows me away. I don&#39;t have enough Mono material
    to judge -- I&#39;ve studied Centaur very carefully, but I certainly wouldn&#39;t
    consider it a better example of technical excellence than, say, Cloister. Among
    the refinements of the latter are variant short- and long-tail R&#39;s, fairly
    important in a Jensonian. Among the flaws is a very thin right side bearing for
    the &#39;e&#39; in the 16pt size, and a fat one for the &#39;r&#39;. &#40;needless
    to say, the Centaur design itself is superior in many ways to Cloister, but that&#39;s
    as true of the Wiebking cuts as the Monotype&#41; <BR> <BR>2. I don&#39;t see
    the same trend in Benton&#39;s &#39;o&#39; spacing that you do. The &#39;o&#39;
    space in his 1900 Century Expanded is much tighter than Benton/Whitehall &#40;I&#39;m
    looking at 10pt samples in the 1934 ATF book&#41;. What I <i>do</i> see is consistently
    generous &#39;o&#39; spacing at text sizes, and consistently tight &#39;o&#39;
    spacing in display. <BR> <BR>3/4. I chose AC solely because of the prominent serifs,
    and the noonn spacing solely because it draws attention to the philosophical underpinnings
    of spacing: are you spacing the stems and mostly ignoring the serifs &#40;as recommended
    by Tracy&#41;, or are you mostly paying attention to the closest approach between
    the two letters &#40;e.g. the serifs for the nn pair&#41;? I am not at this point
    doing an exhaustive review of InDesign&#39;s kernus. Isn&#39;t that the job of,
    uh, writers in the trade press and industry consultants? <BR> <BR>6. You&#39;re
    conflating a whole bunch of different things here: design for optical scaling,
    linear interpolation, Multiple Master technology itself, and Adobe&#39;s use of
    it. MM is actually capable of many tricks other than straight linear scaling,
    but suffers from the same problem as Metafont: while powerful, you have to be
    a computer scientist to effectively use all the features. <BR> <BR>In any case,
    even though I am one, I don&#39;t plan on using MM as the basis for my optically
    scaled releases. Because I am stark raving mad, I am designing my own font technology
    from scratch. It bugs the hell out of me that I don&#39;t really grok spacing
    yet. <BR> <BR>And now, a fun challenge: <BR> <BR><!--attachment: ccat-69201.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*28.4*Take+the+challenge%21*ccat%2epdf

    of comments on InDesign&#39;s optical kerning: <BR> <BR>1&#41; Personally, I tend
    to use well-spaced fonts with decent kerning, and I only turn on optical kerning
    on the fly for specific problem combinations that were not kerned at all in the
    font. For example, the &#34;nT&#34; combo in OpenType frequently gives me trouble.
    Dang interCap words! <BR> <BR>2&#41; Remember, it&#39;s just another feature.
    It&#39;s not on by default. You don&#39;t like it, you don&#39;t have to use it!
    Personally, I find there are some fonts whose overall spacing seems improved by
    turning it on, but they&#39;re generally not fonts I would use. <BR> <BR>Finally,
    I would just note that Adobe bought, rather than licensed, the relevant patent
    and source code &#40;when the original URW went bust, I think&#41;. I know that
    some further modifications were made, so calling it &#34;Kernus&#34; is not really
    quite accurate - though it&#39;s certainly descended from the Kernus technology.

    &#34;original instruments&#34; in listening to Baroque music. In terms of glyph

    is that Raph&#39;s space character is quite narrow. In general, the appearance
    of &#34;apostrophization&#34;  should be related to word spacing. When I first
    started kerning fonts, I tended to overdo it, and the apostrophe is one instance
    where that&#39;s easy to do. However, more recently, I&#39;ve come to appreciate
    that there are certain glyphs where ample sidebearings are part of the character
    -- the apostrophe and the figure 1 being the most obvious. In fact, getting really
    precise, it may be a good idea to have separate glyphs &#40;although the BCPs
    could be identical&#41;, differently fitted, for the apostrophe and single quote.
    And of course, with OpenType, that&#39;s possible! Christopher Slye or Adam Twardoch
    &#40;Zapfino Extra&#41; have probably already done it.  <BR> <BR>Are the apostrophe
    and the quotemark separate Unicode characters? <BR> <BR>&#62;Just a couple of
    comments on InDesign&#39;s optical kerning <BR> <BR>I agree with you completely
    Thomas. But I woud add that I am critical of &#34;Optical&#34; spacing for two
    reasons:  <BR> <BR>&#40;1&#41; The myth of poorly spaced indie fonts. It&#39;s
    tempting for many people to think that there is a technological fix for the amateurishness
    of fonts from &#34;boutique&#34; foundries. That&#39;s the myth. The reality is
    that the virtues of &#34;Optical&#34; technology are quite modest, and that spacing
    is an aesthetic and cultural quality of types which shouldn&#39;t be given the
    &#34;one size fits all&#34; treatment. Many Indie foundries do brilliant spacing.
    Some may do &#34;dodgy&#34; spacing, but it is nonetheless a quality of their
    work, which should not be quantified and eradicated by a megacorp bot. <BR> <BR>&#40;2&#41;
    By engaging in critical discussion of Optical, we gain a better understanding
    of the threshold between what is appropriate for automation, and what still requires
    manual work. While I am aware of the benefits &#40;and inevitability&#41; of progress,
    I favor a balanced approach somewhere between &#34;the old way was best&#34; and
    &#34;let&#39;s automate everything&#34;.'

    There is a perceptible distance on what I called in Typo 13 the &#39;gestural-atmospheric&#39;
    axis. The text on the left is more even and regular and quietier, the one on the
    right more assertive and active and generally a tad darker, but having said that,
    I have to say the distances between them are quite slight. I cannot say the one
    is right, the other wrong, or the one is good the other bad. <BR>Both are readable
    on my screen. Readability and legibility are, I am coming to believe, gross measures.
    Legibility of type is a matter of thresholds &#40;perceptual discrimination affordances

    a matter of degrees &#40;visual wordform resolutional affordances, which seem

    changes my evaluation of InDesigns optical kerning somewhat; it is sensitive to

    &#40;out of 1000&#41; from the 12pt optical setting. <BR> <BR>Second, in comparing

    guys are good! The column on the right is indeed InDesign&#39;s optical kerning
    &#40;and thanks, Thomas, for pointing out that it isn&#39;t quite correct to simply
    call it &#34;Kernus&#34;&#41;. On the left is my own attempt to space the font.
    In fact, it&#39;s my third from-scratch stab. This time, I tried really hard to
    get the side bearings right, then kern with a very light touch. In particular,
    I made it a point not to kern round-round or serif-round combinations. <BR> <BR>I
    find it fascinating that there isn&#39;t unity on which is better &#40;or maybe
    Hrant is just the outlier whose judgement should not be trusted&#41;. Even Paul
    Stanley&#39;s preference for my spacing is suspect, because the lack of the &#39;ff&#39;
    ligature is a bug in the font that will get corrected before release. <BR> <BR>My
    spacing could no doubt be improved. In fact, I now consider a comparison against
    InDesign&#39;s optical kerning an important tool in discovering places where spacing
    can be improved. <BR> <BR>The word &#34;powers&#34; is definitely spaced more
    like a metal face &#40;optical kerning hairline spaces po and kerns owe quite
    a bit&#41;. Because this is a historical revival, I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s
    a bad thing, but InD&#39;s optical is also absolutely a valid stylistic choice.
    I cannot agree, though, for cases such as &#34;liberty&#34;, which to my eyes
    has &#34;ib&#34; too tight and &#34;rty&#34; far too loose. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s
    interesting that Peter perceives InDesign&#39;s optical kerning as &#34;darker&#34;.
    I fiddled with the tracking values &#40;&#43;3 for my sample, -2 for InDesign&#41;
    so that they&#39;d take exactly the same amount of total width. To my eyes, there
    isn&#39;t a significant difference in color, so I wonder if this is something
    that other people see as well. <BR> <BR>If you look at just the stems, my sample
    is far more even &#40;look at &#34;institute&#34;, line 15, for a striking example&#41;.
    Here is a fundamental question: is InD&#39;s variation in stem spacing signal,
    or noise? In the frequency analogy, my stems form a stable carrier frequency,
    with features such as arches added on, while the more varied stem spacing of InD
    is like frequency modulation of that carrier wave; it will occupy a broader peak
    of spatial frequencies. &#40;hey, I should run a Fourier analysis!&#41; <BR> <BR>You
    can also look at the spacing, in terms of the &#34;features&#34; concept of Peter&#39;s
    Typo 13 essay. In particular, I space the rvwy class tightly, much more so than
    InDesign. So, in my spacing of &#34;ty&#34;, these two letters visually connect
    &#40;they&#39;re not quite touching, but presumably the gap is so narrow that
    it wouldn&#39;t be seen in the parafovea&#41;, while in InDesign the gap between
    them would count as a visual feature. From a readability standpoint, which feature
    is better, connection or gap? Are they both functionally useful for recognizing
    the &#34;ty&#34; pair, perhaps, so the choice is merely aesthetic? <BR> <BR>For
    pairs such as &#34;vi&#34;, I strongly prefer my spacing, because it avoids creating
    a large triangular gap. This is especially so for a word such as &#34;evinces&#34;
    &#40;4th line from bottom&#41;, where the large gap contrasts with the relatively
    tight ev and nc spaces. &#40;this effect is even worse for the yp pair, as can
    be seen in one of the nonsense words&#41; <BR> <BR>Even so, I&#39;d have to agree
    with Paul that InDesign&#39;s optical kerning isn&#39;t <i>bad.</i> In many cases,
    such as a poorly spaced text font, or if you have Hrant&#39;s eyes, it would definitely
    be an improvement. So I think we can put to rest any assertion that optical kerning
    should not be used for body text. <BR> <BR>It amazes me that spacing is so hard.
    After all, it&#39;s just a handful of numbers. Yet, we often find that people
    who draw beautiful letter shapes stumble over the problems of spacing &#40;Mrs.
    Eaves is a commonly cited, and dramatic, example&#41;. I wonder to what extent
    it&#39;s possible to understand spacing systematically, or whether it will always
    remain a black art, with all but the most talented and experienced masters doomed
    to forever crank out poorly fitted fonts.'

  body: We&#39;re not going to get anywhere with Indy/Kernus until we stop treating
    as a mysterious black box which somehow may, or may not, do the right thing to
    spacing in some particular case, but instead, approach it as a bad program which
    generally does bad things in an entirely predictable way, no matter what its input.
    <BR> <BR>This is pretty easy to illustrate. Take the behaviour I illustrated in
    Adobe Garamond Pro. My objection is that it destroys the font by inserting unwanted  space
    between u and m in the word jumps at 12 points. This is wrong because in any normal
    font, the distance between u and m has been perfectly spaced. This is not conceivably
    a letter pair that under any normal circumstances needs spacing repair or additional
    kerning. To make matters worse, Indy/Kernus also subtracts space between j and
    u &#40;again, a letter combination invariably perfectly spaced under all normal
    circumstances&#41; thus entirely distorting the spacing of this most common word.  <BR>
    <BR>OK. So what do we do? Stop, for Heaven&#39;s sake, acting as if this were
    a one-off event. Instead, test this same letter combination with a wide variety
    of fonts. <BR> <BR>What I found at once is that for every serif font I tested
    at 12 points, Kernus/InDesign invariably subtracted space between j and u and
    added space between u and m. I tested Times, Georgia, Mrs Eaves, Mrs Eaves small
    and petite caps &#40;slightly different&#41;, Palatino, Minion, Courier, Didot,
    and most illuminatingly, ITC Bodoni Ornaments. <BR> <BR>Now, instead of wasting
    our time looking at nono combinations in a particular font, let&#39;s look at
    a simple row of mmmmm and nnnn <BR> <BR>These are again rows that could not conceivably
    need alteration of any kind. <BR> <BR>Yet InDesign/Kernus invariably tampers with
    them. It generally adds positive space. For example, for both nn and mm, it adds
    14 units in Minion at 12 points. &#40;Is there anyone here who can convert this
    into PS font units? In any case, by any measure, this is a shocking alteration
    to the most fundamental spacing property of a font.&#41; <BR> <BR>For Adobe Caslon
    by contrast it adds 4 to mm and 6 to nn. For Copperplate Gothic it subtracts 32
    units.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m sorry folks, but this is a Frankenstein come to life.  <BR>
    <BR>This is not behaviour that can possibly be justified by any rational theory
    of typography or graphic design.  <BR> <BR>&#62;Finally, I would just note that
    Adobe bought, rather than licensed, the relevant patent and source code &#40;when
    the original URW went bust, I think&#41;. I know that some further modifications
    were made, so calling it &#34;Kernus&#34; is not really quite accurate - though
    it&#39;s certainly descended from the Kernus technology. <BR> <BR>This gives the
    erroneous impression, Thomas, that Adobe initiated the relationship with URW.
    It did not. It inherited the relationship from Aldus, which licensed jack-in-the-box
    from URW for PageMaker 5. Not for the first time, I express the wish that you
    would get your Adobe corporate history right! Why should it be up to me to remember
    these ridiculous arcana?  <BR> <BR>Is anyone seriously going to tell me that a
    program which invariably tampers with the nnnn combination of ANY font can be
    defended on any grounds whatsoever?

    the risk of making the same kind of mistakes that newbies often make by paying
    too much attention to the &#34;side bearing&#34; numbers in their font editor;
    you see way too little space to the right of the j all the time. <BR> <BR>Instead,
    I prefer to follow Peter&#39;s approach and concentrate on the visible features,
    in this case the gaps where the serifs visually connect letters together, and
    the blocks of space separating the vertical stems. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/69294.png"
    alt="visual features of &#34;jump&#34;"> <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve spaced this font according
    to Tracy&#39;s philosophy of making the space between stems even. For this word,
    the blocks of space are all rectangular, so are easy to quantify. With vee-shapes
    and rounds, you&#39;d also get triangles and concave lens shapes. With perfectly
    even stem spacing, the blue blocks would all be square. <BR> <BR>Given the pattern
    of serifs at the top and bottom of the lowercase line, even stem spacing leads
    to very <i>uneven</i> gap sizes &#40;visualized here as tan circles&#41;. In this
    example, medium, tiny, huge. Indeed, at display sizes the mp pair looks gappy.
    <BR> <BR>From what I can see, InDesign&#39;s optical kerning simply applies a
    different balance to the two visual features, making size of the gaps more consistent,
    at the expense of making the stem spacing more uneven. <BR> <BR>I propose that,
    at text sizes, stem spacing is more important, and that at display sizes, the
    gaps at closest approach are also important. Using existing tools conservatively,
    this suggests designing the metrics of fonts to optimize text sizes, while turning
    on InDesign&#39;s optical kerning for display. Of course, expert spacing by hand
    is always best, but in the cases where that&#39;s not practical, I think what
    InDesign does is useful. <BR> <BR>Of course, what I really want to do here is
    space the different optical sizes differently, according to the principle of varying
    relative importance of blocks of space and gaps at closest approach. But that&#39;s
    also clearly a lot more work; otherwise I think most font releases today would
    be optically scaled.

    By looking and thinking, a person can still unlearn one&#39;s intuition &#40;because
    it&#39;s not infallible&#41;. For example how point sizes that <i>seem</i> most
    easy to read are in fact a bit too large. But I certaily can&#39;t &#34;proove&#34;

    needs the &#34;um&#34; a hair looser. &#40;BTW, I can&#39;t quantify &#34;hair&#34;
    and &#34;a bit&#34;, but I can tell you that the latter is more.&#41; <BR> <BR>&#62;
    You say there is no rhythm, and I say <BR>&#62; this is like saying there is no
    God. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think so. I think it&#39;s more of a terminological
    confusion caused by the romance of the consciousness &#40;which forgets we&#39;re
    animals&#41;. The reason there&#39;s no rhythm is quite simple, mechanical even:
    to me &#40;and I think dictionaries agree&#41; rhythm is a pattern in a flow.
    But there is no flow in reading &#40;except at the level of linebreaks, but that&#39;s
    far removed from letterform notan&#41;, so there is no rhythm. There <i>is</i>

    <BR>Hmmm. Well I may change my mind as I learn more about this, but here is my
    conclusion so far. There is no ideal spacing because the letters, especially the
    caps, do not allow for fully meeting a standard of evenness of color or rhythm.
    For example, LA is a problem.  <BR> <BR>As Raph points out, there are sometimes
    conflicting considerations: evenness of stems distance, distance of the nearest
    parts of the letters, closeness at the top or x height, at the baseline, etc.
    And, don&#39;t forget - as Tracy emphasized - glyphs can be designed to space
    better or worse also. <BR> <BR>So there will always be room for taste. However,
    this room is only within a certain range. There is still such a thing as bad spacing,
    as John illustrated in his &#39;visual persuasion&#39;. So yes, there is good
    spacing; yes, there is bad spacing; and, no, there is no ideal spacing. <BR> <BR>But
    to move closer to the ideal means designing the glyphs to space well in the design
    process.'

    of the arts. Most people find it a useful term, understand what is meant by it,
    and consider it a pleasing quality. What on earth is sickly and senile about handwriting?
    <BR> <BR>&#34;Text&#34; and &#34;Texture&#34; are both derived from the Latin
    &#34;tactare&#34; -- to touch. So the idea is well established that there is something
    in text typography which is not an obvious rhythm &#40;viz. the blurryness of
    the Fourier images&#41; and not a pattern. It is something which cannot be fixed
    with the clarity of vision, or described with the precision of a rhythmic tempo,
    but is better felt. <BR> <BR>Colo&#40;u&#41;r  and fit are the proper typographic
    words for what we are discussing as the principle of &#34;spacing&#34;. When those
    from outside the typographic tradition start to analyse it in an objective way,
    they decide that perfectly servicable words like &#34;leading&#34; are misleading
    anachronisms, and replace it with &#34;line height&#34;.  <BR> <BR>Why are typophiles
    talking about &#34;optimizing spacing&#34;? <BR>In typography, spacing means adding
    to the standard distance between letters or words. <BR> <BR>&#34;Optical spacing&#34;
    is perhaps the culprit, and this is a misnomer -- it should have been more accurately
    named &#34;Auto kern&#34;.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m certainly interested in what science
    has to reveal about reading and typography. But I&#39;m sceptical of how deep
    and how relevant it can go. Some areas of research produce softer science than
    others. So far, it&#39;s been established that simple principles can be applied
    to explain some of the phenomenon of reading. For instance, it is has now known

    in tension with legibility, which requires diversity of form.  <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t

    the resolution power of Fourier Transforms, or hide in in higher frequency&#41;

    <BR> <BR>One thing I always do on any font in the editing stages is to set the
    PS IS to 0, which should prevent the printer from caching it.  <BR> <BR>It is
    also essential to consider that different printer rasterizers will print font
    data differently. For example, I have noticed in the past that it is tendency
    of an Adobe rasterizer to prevent dropout at any cost; clone rasterizers are not
    necessarily designed with this imperative, and may thus give a more useful indication
    of problem areas in a design. Adobe rasterizers ought to be the gold standard,
    of course, but in these competitive days, they are seldom used, for cost reasons.
    I have no idea the extent to which the latest clones have achieved parity or functional
    identity with Adobe PS.'

  body: "To follow up on Raph's comment about the general usefulness of fourier processing
    for understanding spacing, see the attached (sorry, couldn'd figure out how to
    attache in the new interface: try http://www.thecharlestaylorprize.ca/downloads/raph_spacing_protocols.pdf)
    comparison of a transform of Raph's custom spacing with a transform of the kernus
    spacing and a transform of the ikern spacing. I did some gaussian blur and thresholding
    processing to highlight the differences. (There is a small margian for incompatibility
    introduced by manually adjusting the darkpoint and midpoint levels after the gaussian
    blur.)\r\n\r\nThe interesting thing to note is that, unlike kernus, ikern keeps
    the general concentration of information visible in Raph's spacing (note the similarity
    in the 75%grey horizonatal band), but spreads out the very highest peak (the white
    peak in the manin frequency band disappears).\r\n\r\nFor those who are interested,
    I've prepared an entire suite of fourier transforms. One is designed to compare
    the spatial frequency distribution of a suite of fonts, ranging from bold to light,
    normal to condensed, serif to sanserif. Another shows the effects of course spacing
    adjustments to Mendoza (using QuarkXpress tracking units on the \xB110 order.
    Another shows the effects of fine spacing adjustments on the order of \xB11 (through
    9) qxp tracking units. Another compares the spatial frequency distribution of
    the black in a block of text with that of the white.\r\n\r\nThose who are interested
    in accessing this should send me an e-mail request (penneson@sympatico.ca), and
    I will send them a link. (I prefer to know who is downloading this, because I
    might want to extend these exercises and make it into a presentation.)\r\n\r\nI
    will hold off on applying my interpretations of the tracking experiments, font
    comparison, black versus white experiments for now.\r\n"

    really wether it makes sense to respond on discussions that were made years ago
    and wether anyone may take notice of it. Yet, I surfed a little in these old comments
    and I am again astonished that there are so much people thinking about stuff like
    this, I mean almost in terms of philosophy and so on. So I did always.\r\nAs I
    already told here and there I worked long ago at the Valdonega project and since
    then I have learned to have great respect what was done in the past in my example
    the Monotype faces.\r\nAnd I do believe that existes this \u201Catmospheric\u201D
    thing you talked about.\r\nI once tried to better a Baskerville Monotype drawn
    very closely to the metal original.\r\nWithout kerning (I think it spoils the
    rythm of characters) but I simply \u201Cbettered\u201D the spaces of letters and
    up with:\r\nGo to the start again keeping Monotype spaces because they added so
    much to the very character of the font.\r\nMy tries to better it were more even
    thats true but at the same time liveless and boring.\r\nSo I think there are some
    secrets about it.\r\nAnyone there who wants to restart this discussion?\r\n\r\nSalute\r\nStefan"

    received wisdom seems to come from Walter Tracy's book 'Letters of Credit' and
    other influences from the old metal Linotype drawing offices. \r\n\r\nMonotype's
    practices seem to have been somewhat different. Does anyone know about the approach
    of the drawing office in English Monotype's old metal days?"

    Linotype, etc.) as opposed to foundry.\r\n\r\nYes I do also believe it had to
    do something with restrictions in the Monotype machines because there was only
    a certain number of widths possible I think. Yet, as I said its not so easy to
    make it better. For example the e\u2019s shifted slightly to the right side are
    genious solutions and have a certain logic to the eye. If you cut those particularities
    out of those fonts they get kind of strange and boring without their special rythm
    (happened so to my Baskerville Monotype). May also have to do something with our
    eyes that got used to see the classic characters and read them this way for decades.
    Maybe.\r\n\r\nsalute\r\nStefan"

    I did a demonstration at Leipzig, Germany, of the Valdonega Aesthetic LIne characters
    of Martino Mardersteig. (I managed as you know good part of the project and redesigned
    some faces there).\r\n\r\nHe gave me a book which will be selled in the states
    (which I shouldn\u2019t talk too much about ;-) that was printed in VAL Centaur
    and I by myself - although I made it (sorry the lack of modesty ;-) - was struck
    how brillant it worked in (I think) 18 point. Seemed exactly like letterpress.
    I didn\u2019t believe it by myself, I nearly had to use a magnifying glass to
    see the difference from hotmetal!\r\n\r\nI only wanted to tell you that, as I
    know that you are a great fan of this face that also for me is one of the most
    important in the world. And this version (VAL) is overwhelming! The irregularities
    that I did in the design gave it the effect nearly as if being physically impressed
    in the paper. Yeah! I love it. It almost frightens me. For right now I would not
    be able to do it the same way again. Maybe it was the Italian coffee these times..\r\n\r\nsalute\r\n(to
    all the Centaur lovers!)\r\nStefan\r\n\r\nPS\r\nI was very near to talk to Mardersteig
    about your BEAUTIFUL Zeno version but I was too afraid to put you into some trouble.\r\nThough
    I don\u2019t believe he would mind (he actually became more relaxed with these
    themes recently. At least it was my impression) However I mentioned in another
    discussion your brillant idea to invent new curves as design tools and that you
    already did it. Sadly noone is very deep into this theme (apart from myself;-)\r\nGo
    on designing!!\r\n\r\n"
