  a serif and sans, for the project.\r\n\r\nI've settled on Franklin Gothic for the
  first type family due to legibility, style and weight variations, but for extra
  flavour and for body copy in feature articles, I'm looking for a serif that matches
  the same kind of x-height and will harmonise nicely. I thought of Caslon but think
  perhaps the x-height is too small; Palatino compares in scale however I'm not too
  sure about the combination of style - any thoughts on these or any serifs that may
  play happily with Franklin?\r\n\r\nThanks"

    Gothic dates from 100 years ago, and was designed by Morris Benton as his update
    of the 19th century grotesque genre.\r\nSo his Century Schoolbook, and Century
    Expanded, would be good companions, as they were his updates of the 19th century
    Modern style of serifed text face.\r\nAll through the 20th century, Franklin Gothic
    was paired with such faces in newspapers and magazines.\r\nOther vintage faces
    that have a track record of performing well with FG: Clearface (also by Benton)
    and Times Roman, of course."

  body: "Thanks Nick and Tiffany.\r\n\r\nNick - thanks for your response, that's great.
    I always try to take into account historical context when possible, although dealing
    with limited [work] resources can be a little constricting at times!\r\n\r\nExcellent
    suggestion, I like the idea of Centuary Schoolbook for it's aethitics and legibility,
    although the version I currently have access to is lacking in an embellished glyph
    set. Also, what's your opinion of this as a display face? (Character spacing looks
    a little suspect on my version? Also wondering if it's a little too wide-set for
    body copy, requiring larger measure length?)\r\n\r\nTimes Roman may break me out
    in a cold sweat! As a resort, if I can't utilise Centuary I may have to go with
    a rather less-historically rich combination of faces available - any thoughts
    on Bookman Old Style, Caslon or Palatino?\r\n\r\nThanks"
