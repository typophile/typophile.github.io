  earlier as 'Tensa'. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Tensa_6535.jpg]\r\n\r\nAfter
  implementing lower and uppercase, I started to play around with the lower case to
  give it a bit more character. Basically I added some 'gravity' by lightly 'flaring'
  the vertical stems. I didn't update the upper case yet as I am interrested in getting
  some feedback first.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Primus_5877.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  gave it the working title 'Primus' as this is my first font. Also I attached two
  pdf's with some sample text set in Tensa and Primus (text from WikiPedia: Punchcutting).\r\n\r\nI
  really would appreciate any feedback!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nSebastian\r\n\r\n"

    \"gravity\" in Adobe Garamond Premier? It's everywhere. I haven't yet heard Robert
    Slimbach's thoughts on this effect. It might be an authentic artifact from Garamond
    himself, but I wouldn't know. What's your rationnale?\r\n\r\nYou've adopted the
    currently-trendy soft terminals on s. Any reason? I keep wanting to see someone
    use a terminal that's somewhere between the beaky traditional type and the new,
    softer, fluffier kind. The f top is very wide; extends pretty far to the right.
    Test the f with i and with b to see their interaction. "

    body: "Hi Crossgrove,\r\n\r\nThanks for your feedback.\r\n\r\nI just downloaded
      the Garamond Premier specimen and yes, it's everywhere! It is also very notable
      in \"Quadraat\" (FF), and this is one of the fonts that inspired me to try out
      the 'flaring'. I don't have a real rationnale. I am a 'freshman' and started
      out playing around to see what it would do to my font. What is noticable is
      that the flaring helps to firmly 'ground' the letters on the line. It adds a
      certain 'down to earth' mentality to the font. Although, overdoing it may lead
      to the opposite direction, a 'fantasy' sort of mood. \r\n\r\nThe direction of
      the flare could serve as a cue in the reading direction, especially for the
      m, n, i, r etc. where the flare is asymmetric. (also visible in the Garamond
      Premier) For some of the other letters, it should have a direction such that
      it helps to optically balance the letter (esp. the long-hooked f). \r\n\r\nI
      wasn't aware of the trendy soft s-terminals. The first letter I designed was
      the a, and after some sketching I homed in on that type of terminal, which I
      used as a design element for some of the other letters (c, f, j, s, Q, J, etc.).
      After reading the thread on the 'Feijoa' font, I saw that this terminal was
      used in the s (and x), so I tried it out as well.\r\n\r\nYes, the top of the
      f is very wide. I tried the fi and fb combinations and I will need ligatures
      here for sure. I like the long hook as it seems to add character and liveliness
      to the font. Note that a lot of fonts have overlapping f and b (I tried Bembo
      and Garamond).\r\n\r\nAre there particular letters jumping out that need changes?
      Did I infringe any established design rules? \r\n\r\nAs I mentioned, these are
      my first steps in this field. Your comments are very much appreciated!\r\n\r\nSebastian"

  body: "There isn't any such thing as \"design rules\". But there are conventions
    which evolved with the alphabet, which are in place for comfort, familiarity,
    and speed. Some people are interested in finding out how to diverge from these
    conventions, and which of them are meaningless and vestigial. Others confine themselves
    to the conventions, finding a narrower range of variation to work within. \r\n\r\nThe
    conventions, taken together, make a typeface readable. But there's so much leeway
    there, that what makes a typeface readable is highly subjective. That's how you
    can have Bodoni, Goudy, Unger, Jannon, Tyfa and Dwiggins all doing essentially
    the same thing: making type for reading.  \r\n\r\nI think you ought to avoid,
    or at least be very skeptical of, literal concepts like gravity, weight, directionality.
    Reading is such a singular, complicated phenomenon, and I don't personally feel
    we are prepared to analyse it thoroughly. Meanwhile, you can certainly observe,
    and respond to those effects in type design which speed or facilitate reading,
    and those that impede it. In your design, right now, I see very few things that
    weaken the design for reading, and this is because the structure, or skeleton
    of your letters, is very conventional and familiar. If you set a page in your
    typeface at 8 point, however, you might find the fit is a little tight. Try more
    samples, and visit <a href=\"http://www.adhesiontext.com/\">Adhesiontext</a> to
    get some text that uses only the characters you have drawn."

  body: "Thanks for the lesson crossgrove!\r\n\r\nI will try follow your advice and
    set a page at 8pt. I already noticed that the font is not 'super economic'. Probably
    this has to do with the b, d, m, n etc. being quite wide.\r\n\r\nAlso I haven't
    started any kerning whatsoever, although the test pages may be 'autokerned' by
    InDesign...\r\n\r\nThe adhesiontext site is a handy link.\r\n\r\nSebastian\r\n"

  body: "Right; don't do any kerning until you've finalized the spacing. If you're
    using InDesign, it will do a good job of autospacing, but be sure to switch from
    \"Optical\" spacing to \"Metrics\" to see what your built-in spacing looks like.
    Your font needs to be spaced well anyway, so you might keep \"Metrics\" spacing
    on by default while you develop this design. \r\n\r\nIt's not particularly un-economical
    either. The economy gained in condensing a face has a tradeoff point where the
    font has to be set larger to look big enough, so don't worry too much about economy
    at this stage.  \r\n\r\nIf you're interested in the tapering or gravity effect,
    consider doing a small test on 4-5 letters where all your outlines are curves.
    Even your stems could be curved. See where it takes you. FF Clifford is one typeface
    with lots of fluidity. "

      take a good up-close look.\r\n\r\nSebastian"

    the effect is too abrupt and should transition more gently.  Look at most of your
    vertical stems--the worst offenders are in the lc n, m, h where you begin your
    stem widening right where the curve meets the stem giving me the pinching effect
    right at those points.  You might begin the gravity transition a bit lower and
    gently curve into it rather than so straight and abrubtly.\r\n\r\n\r\nChrisL"

      crossgrove also mentioned earlier. \r\n\r\nI applied the flaring rather quick
      to see what the effect would look like. Especially on the lc l, k and h, I started
      the widening right at the upper stem serif, which is not optimal. Note that
      I have to start implementing it on the uc. After figuring out 'what the rules
      are', this is the next step.\r\n\r\nI will try lowering the 'flaring point'
      down and see what can be done to the h, k and l. These are a bit tricky as they
      do not have a natural midway point where the flaring can start logically.\r\n\r\nBtw,
      I tweaked the g following your comments. To me, it now looks more balanced and
      the lower ear is more firmly aligned with the base-line. I believe the g is
      one of the harder letters to get down, as it is made up entirely of curves.\r\n\r\nSebastian"
