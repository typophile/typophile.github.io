    a weekend. If the fix is simple, how about delegating to a responsible admin?

  body: "Here's an update for anyone interested in the gory details. First of all,
    apologies for the recent outages.\r\n\r\nIn order to enable a database cache,
    we upgraded MySQL to version 4.1x. At the same time, we added an autostart script.
    What I neglected to do was to name the said script starting with a capital S (RedHat
    likes it that way).\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, our server is being relocated to
    a really sweet data center, so for the last few weekends the nice folks at Media
    Temple have restarted the server a couple of times. Since the startup script was
    failing, MySQL didn't come back online with the rest of the server like it's supposed
    to. The problem has been fixed, and hopefully we won't have any more sad Typophile-less
    weekends.\r\n\r\nThe disk space issue has been solved and isn't an issue."

    blame the typophile farm of Mac OS servers, Xboxes and iPods that host the site

    that causes the problems. Some may recall the time when it was disabled for a
    few months, and during that time no-one visited Typophile! But during that time
    there were no outages. You people can\u2019t have it both ways. "
