  body: "Frode, your top sample (\"Greyscale (FF, Win Vista)\") doesn't seem to contain
    any gray at all.\r\n\r\nIt's funny to see that, despite the <em>overall</em> \"color\"
    is different, Cleartype and Quartz totally agree on sub-pixel colors. An extreme
    closeup shows virtually the same sub-pixel alignment, it's just the intensity
    that's different.\r\n\r\nIsn't there a configuration panel for Cleartype? What
    sort of influence does that have, other than \"On/Off\"?"

    it to render dark enough on Windows?\r\n\r\nBTW, to get your first line to a-a
    you'll need to tweak the GASP table (but then you might get severe drop-outs,
    although not if it's a monoline sans/slab).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "It sure looks Demi all by itself out there.\r\n\r\nWeb fonts for text, viewed
    for discussion at a single size, even with a billion different renderings, is
    like judging a long life by a single day.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the question of sanity
    in rendering is raised, let me say this\u2014 If one plucks a series of sizes
    of a type like you show  and employ them at 9, 16, 30, and 57 px, i.e. as it might
    be employed, but putting these selected waterfalls of sizes together in comparison,
    everything you try except quartz is going to look ugly, do hear me? U g leee.
    Antialised, CT GDI, ugleee and CT DW, the best for last, will look pale and wan.
    Changing from one render style to another, except to change from one small size
    to all larger sizes aliased, is also ugly. Different fonts rendering differently
    at the same size is also ugly. Having Greyscale hinted in x y and d the impossible
    to turn on in Windows  looks like the print, and quartz looks like bad print.\r\n\r\nAnd
    I'm saying to look at a range of sizes because this example is so narrow and 1/2
    tight it can't be just for text. But if it is, then the aliased and CT versions
    should include the little serif terminals of c, e, s, and a, who are just starting
    to poke their little info giving heads out in the quartz rendering. If you are
    representing the face with it's smallest important essense intact, I'd try to
    follow Hrant on this.\r\n\r\nIf not, if you're into the less is more of all CT
    as the basis for web typography, then you, and the gang  just have less stylistic
    choice of what will work as a web font on Windows, and more font development work
    after the outline design, on fonts that will work small to large on Windows.  Perhaps
    in the land of the insane, the less insane should read the tea leaves?\r\n\r\nHrant,
    \r\nGreg H's white paper on MS CT of Oct.08, linked to from around here somewhere,
    explains that one cannot hint for CT to achieve parametric scaling. Only alignment
    preservation is really possible on the client side of a Windows machine with CT
    on.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    on the neverending road of hintless outlines, and I think \u2014 as a general
    concept \u2014 I\u2019m starting to figure out which direction to take. My compromises
    are far from most other web font compromises, for one I firmly believe one outline
    does not fit them all. I\u2019m looking at a range of sizes and a range of rendering
    methods and it\u2019s all ugly for sure. As for the weight: Is that all I have
    to play with on the Mac? Heavier equals blurrier?"
