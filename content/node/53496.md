  is a book I read for my Modern Anti-hero in Film and Fiction. It fills in the backstory
  on Twain's Huckleberry with the sordid tale of his father, the titular Finn.\r\n\r\nThis
  picture looks a little greener than the copy I have in my hand, but I think it's
  a beautiful cover. It's dark, isolated and weathered. Coincidentally, Clinch's Finn
  is, too.\r\n\r\nI won't give anything away, but the book starts out with Finn cooking
  his wife's flesh and feeding it (her?) to his only friend, a blind man who sells
  him moonshine. I lied, he's not cooking his wife's flesh. He's burning it, and his
  friend smells it and demands some. And it's not his wife, but his wife who he was
  never allowed to wed because of their differing races. The Finn on the cover is
  listlessly floundering in his boat, just like Finn in the book does, both literally
  and metaphorically, on water and through his life.\r\n\r\nAhhh, metaphors for human
  futility. He can row, row, row his boat all he wants, but he's not gonna land anywhere
  comfortable. The ornaments are vaguely gothic, which pleases me, and complements
  the rugged atmosphere of the rest of the cover. Finn isn't successful when he tries
  to fit convention of beautiful life... but the cover does assimilate and is a pretty
  accurate representation of the content.\r\n"

  body: I can lend it to you once another friend of mine returns it. The teacher uses
    it for a lot of different classes... but I'm sure you're busy enough that by the
    time you can read it, I'll have it back :)
