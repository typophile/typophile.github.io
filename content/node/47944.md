body: "Hi everyone,\r\nI'm doing a rebranding project right now, and I'm trying out
  some typeface combinations. The company is within womens fashion FYI, and their
  existing CVI only makes use of a Bodoni as it is now (both for their logo and all
  type applied in brochures etc.)\r\n\r\nMuch appreciated if you have any feedback
  on what combinations you prefer.\r\n\r\nRegards in advance"

  body: My favorite is the one on the bottom right. the body text is the most readable
    and the best looking of all of them. The first one isn't bad either, but I like
    the serif headline font / sans-serif body font combo better here.

  body: "Not sure that I like any of them.\r\n\r\nGo for a font that is of the same
    family is your plan is to mix san serif with serif, that way they are specifically
    designed to work with each other.\r\n\r\nA couple of good choices\r\n\r\nMeta
    + meta serif\r\n\r\nThesis Family\r\n\r\nSoho Family"

  body: "Of those, I gotta say I like the first...can't really say why. I guess the
    sans serif font for the headings is just really clear and simple, and it goes
    pretty well with the serif font...although there are a lot of serif fonts that
    could do just as well. \r\n\r\nWhat are the pairings, btw? I'm not the kind of
    guy who can tell just by looking at them, yet.\r\n\r\nPeace,\r\nJT"

  body: "@Charming Man\r\nI disagree, sure families like Meta Sns/Srf work together
    (as they are intended to), but I think very interesting combinations can arise
    from strongly contrasted sans and serifs also.\r\n\r\nI think number 4 or 6."
