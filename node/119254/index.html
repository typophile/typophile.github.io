<p>Could you also take a look at the formating of A.M. and P.M.? They should both be in small caps, but the A in A.M. looks a bit bigger.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Used to subscribe. I guess I am a semi-regular reader. The old issues I have available ATM  (2008–2011) set blockquotes smaller with tighter leading, and they set long acronyms a point or two smaller. Enough to make it look noticeably lighter than surrounding text. Although I would love to see the New Yorker use proper small caps, Caslon’s are way to small for acronyms. In that sence, dropping the font size is a less jarring solution. If they are as perfectionist as they say, the limit is six letters: UNICEF is faux SC, MSNBC is all cap. Newspaper headlines sit between double curly quotes, but in the same style and weight as the surrounding text. I don’t know if they changed this in the new redesign. The designer of their new text typeface, Williams Caslon (used to be Adobe Caslon, I believe) is a regular here. His name is William Berkson. He might know more.</p>
<p>Edit: Five letter acronym PIIGS also faux SC, NYPD caps. Not so consistent.</p>

<p>Same goes for the A.M. and P.M. (the A appearing larger than the M is only an optical illusion), which is set in 16 px.</p>
<p>I was always taught to set acronyms in smaller sizes than the surrounding copy (not in small caps, just a point or two smaller), but I&rsquo;ve never seen anyone set a quoted headline smaller than the surrounding text. It may just have been a tagging error.</p>

<p>I was asking is there a typographic rule which says that you need to typeset newspaper headlines in lower text size.</p>
<p>Then I added the question about the number of letters in an abbreviation for it to be typeset in small caps.</p>

<p>I have no idea why JamesM felt the need to point something out, to be helpful, but then ended up being very unhelpful and snarky. Why haven&rsquo;t you, James, posted a link?

<p>I was merely pointing out that the quoted headline was in the same typeface as the surrounding text (and identified the typeface), but in a smaller point size. I also pointed out that the smaller size was most likely an error, which Michel Boyer confirmed.</p>
<p>The whole Caslon discussion was initiated by someone else, and the additional link I posted was a response to JamesM, not to you.</p>
<p>If you want a good guide to typography, Robert Bringhurst&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Elements of Typographic Style&rdquo; is your best resource, and it covers both the abbreviation/acronym question and the book/journal/article title typesetting question. You can find it at Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble.</p>
<p>I suggest you make the investment in the book, for I wouldn&rsquo;t expect many answers to any of your future posts on this forum&hellip;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why haven&rsquo;t you, James, posted a link? Why didn&rsquo;t you do a search?</p>

<p>I was trying to be helpful and I thought the old discussion might be useful to you. Is it too much work for you — the person asking for info — to do a search? Geez.</p>

<p>Well, it was about typography in the New Yorker, so it had <em>some</em> relation to your question. Although I have to admit that if one Googles about how this kind of quoted material is handled typographically, what you will normally see is <em>italics</em> if not just quote marks&hellip; this is really the first time ever I have heard of anyone using a smaller type size for in-line quotations.</p>
<p>Quotes of whole paragraphs are a different matter - they may well be in a smaller point size in addition to being indented at both margins.</p>
