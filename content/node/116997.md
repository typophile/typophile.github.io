  tried this today and it seems broken. The paths in FinishInstallWindows.cmd seem
  incorrect (I get errors). Even when I manually enter the correct paths, set the
  PATH etc., and re-login, the tools give python errors. \r\n\r\nSwitching to Fontlab
  macro style: There is no  FDK/Tools/FontLab directory in the FDK tree, and there
  is no  installFontLabMacros.py anywhere in the zip.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know what
  the problem is? Did I get an incorrect zip somehow?\r\n\r\n BTW, I have Python 2.7.1
  installed previously on my system (so I can already I run the occasional FontLab
  script)\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any help!\r\n"

    \"http://forum.fontlab.com/index.php?topic=9060.0\".\r\n\r\nUnfortunately Adobe
    provides the latest version only. I would like to have build 62690, but I cannot
    download it anymore. This is very annoying, because you have no access to a build,
    that works,  and it makes it more difficult to precisely report bugs. Adobe should
    keep all versions, that are listed in the release notes, on the servers."
