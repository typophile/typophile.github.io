body: I know it won&#39;t blow anyone&#39;s socks off or anything but it is what the
  client wants and feedback would be interesting. Comments on the lettering itself
  would be great. Matrix was not my idea. The spacing is not worked out yet and I
  will be working on color today. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/4170.gif"

  body: '&#62;I think that you&#39;ve done a lovely job with the letters - maybe the
    E &#62;could be moved in a bit so that it is more visually ending at the &#62;same
    line as the s? It is a strange contrast though - such elegant &#62;type and a
    word like FORGE? Not sure what to make of that.'

  body: Nice typeface selection for the word ellipsis. I would suggest trying a sans
    face for the word forge. I agree with am, it currently looks a little to elegant.
    Using a sans serif face for &#34;forge&#34; may create some contrast between the
    2 words. Also, tightening up the space between the &#34;e&#34; and the &#34;l&#34;
    will definately help. NIce logo overall though.

  body: Nice work.  Juxtaposing different type in logos is always tricky. <BR> <BR>I
    would personally try setting &#34;FORGE&#34; in a widely spaced, extra-condensed,
    uppercase sans, and start it after the tail of the p. <BR> <BR>Paul

  body: Unfortunately the client thinks that serif means &#42;historical&#42; and
    Matrix is their favorite font. <BR> <BR>The business does high-end custom metal
    work. Beds, railing, doors. Fancy stuff I could never afford. Pretty classic stuff.

  body: What if ... you lopped off the serifs on matrix?? This wouldn&#39;t be too
    naughty now would it?? <BR> <BR>You could show them the sans that Caslon did.
    Or you could find some nice old Etruscan &#40;?&#41; coins.

  body: There is at least some weight problems between heavy e s and others letters.
    The e don&#39;t fit very well with the rest. The weight structure of it is quite
    different from p, perhaps use same way to built them. &#40;oblique axis of e compared
    to vertical axis of p&#41;. Dots of the i are little too close. <BR> <BR>And Forge
    will be indeed better in a Sans, perhaps better little more far from the bottom
    of the baseline of the ellipsis word.

  body: The stress is different. Perhaps change the &#39;p&#39; to the same stress
    as the others, narrow up the &#39;e&#39;. Another thought... perhaps you forego
    the separation of the letters in &#34;forge&#34; also. Simplify the design by
    placing the word forge &#40;together, but still spaced a bit&#41; to the right
    of the descender on the &#39;p&#39;. --- And, what if the dot over the &#39;i&#39;
    was more of a lozenge shape?? Too much??

  body: Thanks so much for the comments.  <BR>  <BR>I&#39;ve taken some of the suggestions
    and made use of them. We&#39;ll have to wait and see how the client takes them
    - such as a a non serif for &#42;forge&#42;. It looks better to me, maybe not
    to him.    <BR>  <BR>BTW  <BR>Any suggestions for sans?  <BR>  <BR>I know I am
    beyond the very small budget at this point but I am still working to make it better
    within the constraints I am facing. It is ironic &#40;no pun intended&#41; that
    such a high-end market wouldn

  body: ask the client if you can give him advice on <BR>his metalwork. ha. he&#39;s
    pretty much outvoted <BR>on matrix. i think ellipsis does well at <BR>giving off
    a hand-crafted vibe. historical even. <BR>since the one word is historical, maybe
    you <BR>could convince him to go  little more modern <BR>on the other word. <BR>
    <BR>i&#39;m in the minority here, but separating the <BR>fo from orge looks kind
    of cool to me. i can <BR>see it both ways, but as it is gives it a sort <BR>of
    violent, manly feel. you know, working with <BR>metal, sweating, beating out a
    heavy piece of art. <BR>maybe it&#39;s just me.
