  this one? I am currently in college studying interior design, and I would like to
  create a logo for my resume, portfolio, and business card. My initials are CCR.
  Does anybody know what a font like this is called? \r\n\r\nThank you!! "

  body: Before making Logo, You have to clear idea about your logo I mean how your
    logo will look like & what meaning of that. Once you decided then you can use
    an online tool or hire any logo design company which create a logo as per your
    requirements.

  body: "I assume you want to do it yourself.\r\n \r\nLike Jared mentions, you need
    some knowledge of the anatomy of type. If you don't have any it's going to be
    hard to create something that will look good/professional. But if you want to
    do it as a study project, to learn from it, it will be fun and you will gain some
    knowledge about type, just don't expect too much.\r\n\r\nIf you know Adobe Illustrator
    and know how to draw / manipulate vector shapes you can to it behind a computer
    and be able to create a lot of different ideas pretty fast.  There are tons of
    instructions video's on manipulating existing fonts out there.\r\n\r\nif you don't
    know how to work with Illustrator you have to print letters cut them by hand and
    arrange them by hand, draw or photograph the result. This will take a lot of time
    and effort but it's not a bad way to do it and if you have fun doing it who cares
    it takes time!\r\n\r\nSo if the goal is to own a logo for your company period,
    follow Hrant's advice. \r\n\r\nIf you like to know more about type and want to
    study it more in the future, go ahead and experiment! And show us what you made,
    anyone here will be happy to give you feedback!\r\n"

  body: "Hrant is absolutely right. Not meaning to be rude, but your question is a
    bit like \"how do I write a professional computer program?\" If you don't know
    how to do it, you can't do it. Yet.\r\n\r\nI have been a professional type designer
    for five years, and have studied type on some level for much longer. But I am
    not very good at logo design, which is a different process. I <em>might</em> be
    able to make a professional looking logo (whatever that may be), but I would still
    hire a professional designer to do it, if it were something important. Simply
    because he or she would do it better than me.\r\n"

  body: "@cat conrad, one of the best ways to create a professional logo is by research.
    Lots of it. The industry you're aiming for, the audience, and in some cases demographics.
    Once you have some direction then you might get a better feel as to the design
    and type you might want to use to position yourself as a brand, trend, or whatever
    style you're aiming for and the attention you want to gain for the purpose of
    the logo. When you get to sketching out ideas, you might find this site helpful
    http://www.logobook.com\r\n\r\nI would also suggest reading through this identity
    guide to get a better understanding of how a mark works together https://issuu.com/egotype/docs/brand_manual_guide_cm_v1
    \r\nAfter you get that all together, look into having your logo tradamarked as
    outlined here: http://justcreative.com/2011/01/17/how-to-trademark-a-logo/\r\n\r\nThis
    is how you can create a professional logo and keep it protected, because there's
    no need to create a professional logo without the rights to it. Please keep us
    updated to your progress. I'd like to see what you come up with and how you launch
    the logo for your name/brand in the near future. Enjoy the process and make it
    happen."

  body: "Hey I'm new here and looking for help. We recently just had a website built
    for our company in Arizona, but now the guy who did it is nowhere to be found.
    We need to create a logo for our company, and I've been put in charge, but I can't
    seem to find how to do it properly. I came across this website and it seems there
    are some real experts in here. I want something really clean and sleek looking
    and if possible, I'd like to include a pigeon (or silhouette, or something modern
    that might resemble a pigeon) in with our company name -- Phoenix Pigeon Control
    Company.\r\n\r\nIf you want to take a look at our website and maybe get a feel
    for what it looks like, the URL is http://www.phoenixpigeons.com\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks
    in advance for all of your help! Looking forward to getting some good advice/help.\r\n\r\n-Wyatt"
