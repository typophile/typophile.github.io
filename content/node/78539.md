  difficulties regarding the listing of the fonts.\r\n\r\nIs there any way you can
  arrange the different weights the way you prefer?\r\nBecause i would like my Pattern
  and Frames, to be on the bottom of the list, logically the weights\r\nsuch as Thin,
  Medium Bold etc. come first...\r\n\r\nYou can see on the picture what i mean exactly.\r\nPlease
  anyone who knows i would be very thankful.\r\n\r\n"

    - Patern. This is the best solution!\r\n\r\nThe hard one:\r\nTry to change the
    table OS/2 weight(class) and width(class) values. If you have no plans of expanding
    Emila with a condensed, compressed or extended weights declare the pattern & frames
    to be condensed  - or extended weights. This should lead to an grouped sorting
    at the end or at the top of your style list. But you have to understand the weight
    and width classes first.\r\n\r\n"

    Bold (numerically 800), and then make the Weight of Pattern and Frames, as Black
    (900) and Fat (1000). \r\nApplications that sort menu styles by number will then
    place them in the order you want.\r\nThat might work."

  body: "Dear Andreas and Nick,\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your comments, but
    the problem is that my font TF Emila Pro is consisted of 8 Weights: Thin, Light,
    Regular, Medium, Bold, Heavy, Black and Ultra, which by itself complicates all
    situations. \r\nObviously i will need to look for another solution, if you have
    other suggestions i would be very grateful.\r\nThanks."

    BOLD RANGE <strong>(usable in increments of 50)</strong>\u201D\r\n\r\nAdditionally
    Adobe applications distinguish capital and small letters in the beginning of the
    names, if the weight of two or more styles is the same."

  body: "You can actually do increments of weightclass by as little as five (but not
    as little as one, as I recall).\r\n\r\nSo if you only have one weight each of
    patterns and frames, you could do:\r\n\r\nBold: 700\r\nHeavy: 800\r\nBlack: 850\r\nUltra:
    900\r\nPatterns: 910\r\nFrames: 920\r\n\r\nOr something like that.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
