  body: Hi Santiago, <BR> <BR>Nice &#34;G&#34;, Maybe you can add this &#34;open&#34;
    feeling to other characters. I am thinking about open that &#34;Q&#34;, the idea
    is to make a rithm with this straight breaking angle.  <BR> <BR> <BR>MH

  body: Hi <BR> <BR>I&#39;d reconsider the G, it looks great in a type sample, but
    it would make the font a lot less usable. <BR> <BR>Jim <BR>====================

  body: Santiago - i&#39;d politely disagree with Jim.  <BR>Keep the G &#40;you could
    always find <BR>an open slot for a regular G&#41;. The G is actually a selling
    <BR>point if you decide to sell the font. Find some alternatives <BR>to some of
    the other vanilla glyphs and maybe you&#39;ll have <BR>a nice alternative to Trade
    Gothic or Alternate <BR>Gothic. <BR> <BR>bj <BR>

  body: 'To be rude, what is the objective of this new font? Seems so boring and close
    to existing fonts. <BR> <BR>G feature is the only originality, but as described
    by John, not really suitable for such typeface. The question you need to ask yourself:
    How to implement funny things as this G, in a way it give more interest to this
    typeface, whithout destructing the legibility? <BR> <BR>If its just an exercice,
    its ok.'

  body: I&#39;m wondering if I&#39;m failing to see a certain originality in Arrival
    that spares it from being called &#34;boring&#34;. <BR> <BR>&#40;I&#39;m not talking
    about techinical issues - where Arrival seems superior to Grillo - although to
    be fair the latter is still in development.&#41; <BR> <BR>&#62; thanks to ask!
    <BR> <BR>I answered my question - now it&#39;s your turn!  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>--
    <BR> <BR>BTW, Santiago, your lc spacing is too tight. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    I guess I have a soft spot for underdogs  <BR>and black sheep. <BR> <BR>Any reasonable
