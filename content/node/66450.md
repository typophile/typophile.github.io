  body: Now that I realize this is an obituary, I'll stop myself from the mean things
    I was going to say about the joins, and proportions, and spacing, and choice of
    weights on that cover.

  body: "I read her obituary this morning and played the album.\r\n\"Heart Like a
    Wheel\" is such a beautiful song, and their harmony so unique.\r\nThought the
    cover design (1975) was interesting.\r\n\r\nIt wouldn't have been too hard to
    draw the ampersand with a Rapidograph and circle template, to make the missing
    character. Other than that, the typography is fine and the spacing nicely done
    (although such super-tight setting hasn't come back into fashion --  yet). I don't
    have a problem with the thickening at the joints, you get the same thing in Helvetica
    25, for instance, even though there is some correction. Correction seems appropriate
    for a grotesque, but not for a geometric.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MacG2_6657.jpg]"

  body: "The face is L&C Hairline and that's one of the (3) ampersands it has, except
    it's bolder. Perhaps it was intentional.\r\n\r\n\"French Record\" is one of my
    all-time favorite albums. Very sad to hear of Kate's passing."

    you see that as a flaw of Futura?"

  body: "I was referring to hairline weights.\r\nAFAIK, the lightest Futura is the
    Extra Light by Scangraphics (although there were some even lighter typositor fonts),
    and it's interesting to note that it has less correction than the Light.\r\nFutura,
    as generally rendered digitally, is not a pure geometric, i.e. its curves are
    not circles and arcs of circle.\r\nAlso of note: Avant Garde Extra Light, with
    noticeable thickening at the joints."
