  any font editing software like FontLab, only illustrator. But i have for quite some
  time wanted to get my hands dirty and dive into a program like FontLab (it's the
  only one i have ever heard of). \r\n\r\nBut i was wondering, is it the best program
  for a completely newbie like me? Is it just the one and only program? I have seen
  it, tried out a demo really quick, but it looks very old school and feels very counter
  intuitive. Doesn't feel like a modern nice piece of software. \r\n\r\nOr are there
  som easier way to start? If not, what books do you recommend regarding FontLab and
  type design in general? \r\n\r\nThanks. "

    of Fontlab, but it is significantly cheaper and you can upgrade if you find that
    making type is really the thing for you.\r\n\r\nBut yeah, pencil and paper are
    definitely a good place to start too!"

    $700 in Fontlab right away, especially if you aren\u2019t interested in designing
    complicated fonts or working with scripting. Just make sure to read the manual
    before you start trying to move to and from Illustrator. And if you want to upgrade
    to Fontlab with a few months, the Fontlab people are very accommodating about
    refunding the Typetool purchase price. And don\u2019t forget that Fontlab does
    offer a hefty student discount on Fontlab!"

  body: "Thanks for your comments guys. \r\n\r\nI think i will just stay low key and
    continue to use paper and illustrator for now. The $700 for FontLab will presumably
    be a very bad investment for me. I will have no idea what to do with, all too
    advanced and complicated for me at this moment. And i have no intension on working
    with scripts. Just playing around and learn with designing letterform and basic
    stuff. \r\n\r\nBut TypeTool might not be a bad place to start at some point, but
    at them moment pencil, paper and illustrator will be sufficent. \r\n\r\nType Design
    book? Any suggestion?\r\n\r\nThanks. "

    day and was hoping it was a good one! I'm also tempted to look into that one jonathan.
    It looks good too.
