  me re-posting an earlier question from elsewhere)\r\n\r\nDoes Arial Unicode have
  the wrong characters in Unicode positions 015E and 015F? These are supposed to be
  \"Latin Upper- and Lowercase S with Cedilla\", but Arial Unicode seems to have \"Latin
  Upper- and Lowercase S with Comma Below\" (which should instead be at 0218 and 0219)...\r\n\r\nFuller

  body: "Yeah, I was pretty sure the general subject had come up before. Fascinating
    as that debate was (and introducing the concept of the 'detached cedilla' with
    which I was not familiar), it drifted into historical manuscripts at the end.
    The fact remains that the whatever-it-is under the S/s in Arial Unicode's 015E
    and 015F (which are supposed to be s-cedilla) strongly resembles Arial's (and
    for that matter, Helvetica's!) comma, and doesn't at all resemble Arial's cedilla.
    \r\n\r\nBut then Arial Unicode doesn't have <em>anything</em> at all in places
    (0218 and 0219) for the (Romanian) s-commaaccent, even though they've already
    designed what, to all intents and purposes, <em>is</em> an s-commaaccent.\r\n\r\nArgh! "

  body: "Arial Unicode MS has further design errors. The double-width diacritics are
    positioned incorrectly, meaning that a correctly encoded string with a diacritic
    mark that is supposed to go over or under two characters will display with the
    diacritic mark shifted one letter-width to the left.\r\n\r\nOne can also point
    to numerous design flaws in the non-Latin components that render the font unusable
    for serious typography in those scripts, but the s-cedilla/comma issue and the
    double-width diacritic issue are egregious outright errors. I had the impression
    Arial Unicode MS is basically abandonware now, with no plans to correct these
    errors or update the font at all.\r\n\r\nThis is probably all for the best. It's
    better to extend Arial's character coverage gradually in careful, thought-out
    steps than to try to fix something that is fundamentally broken, namely Arial
    Unicode MS. Rather than duplicating Arial Unicode MS's approach of including everything
    from Arabic to Chinese in a single font, the current approach seems to be developing
    a suite of Arial-compatible non-Latin fonts each having Arial glyphs for Latin
    coverage. This makes more sense. The logical strategy would be to at least match
    the character coverage of Arial Unicode MS through the extended Arial and its
    family of compatible non-Latin fonts, so that we can leave the Frankenstein that
    is Arial Unicode MS behind. Just how realistic it is to expect all those Arial
    Unicode MS fonts on all those computers to be replaced with a new and improved
    Arial-led family of fonts remains to be seen.\r\n\r\nI admit I don't know much
    about this situation, so please do come correct me if you know more about this."

    to Microsoft, Arial 5.05 supports the following Unicode ranges:\r\nBasic Latin,
    Latin-1 Supplement, Latin Extended-A, Latin Extended-B, IPA Extensions, Spacing
    Modifier Letters, Combining Diacritical Marks, Greek and Coptic, Cyrillic, Cyrillic
    Supplementary, Hebrew, Arabic, Latin Extended Additional, Greek Extended, General
    Punctuation, Superscripts And Subscripts, Currency Symbols, Mathematical Operators,
    Supplemental Mathematical Operators, Miscellaneous Mathematical Symbols-A, Miscellaneous
    Mathematical Symbols-B, Box Drawing, Block Elements, Geometric Shapes, Miscellaneous
    Symbols, Alphabetic Presentation Forms, Arabic Presentation Forms-A, Combining
    Half Marks, Arabic Presentation Forms-B\r\n\r\nTimes New Roman 5.01 supports the
    same ranges except IPA Extensions and Currency Symbols, and one imagines these
    will be added in the future.\r\n\r\nArial and Times New Roman are still being
    updated, as opposed to Arial Unicode MS. It seems Arial's character extensions
    are a \u2018reboot\u2019 so they have nothing to do with the errors in Arial Unicode
    MS.\r\n\r\nI think for practical reasons it is a bad idea to add Chinese characters
    (or hangul, for that matter) to what is primarily a font for Latin and other metrically
    compatible scripts. I think even Arabic is pushing it."

    own documentation is lagging behind :-)\r\n\r\nThe TNR I have is 5.05, and it
    indeed comes with a nice complement of Phonetics: U+0180 up to U+036F, plus U+1D00
    to U+1DFF -- I didn't check but it seems to be virtually complete. It also has
    a vast range of tone markers -- enough to typeset a Bizet aria with.\r\n\r\nCurrency-wise
    I'm not that educated; I'm seeing stuff like Drachma, Austral, Hryvnia, and Cedi
    for the first time."

    only updated as far as Unicode 2.1; the S/s and T/t with cedilla vs. commaaccent
    weren't separated until U+0218 through U+021B were added in Unicode 3.0.

    designer would have had to choose one design or the other to represent both characters,
    according to which s/he thought most useful / most likely to be needed?
