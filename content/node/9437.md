body: 'Hey all I need some advice.  Hopefully somebody can help. <BR> <BR>I may be
  offered a job to do a local yellow pages for seniors in the area.  The person that
  is heading up the project really wants me to do the layout for it.  Now all I got
  to do is get back to this person with a quote of how much is going to cost.  The
  problem is of course, I&#39;m a newb... <BR> <BR>Well I aint that bad, but I have&#39;nt
  had much expierience when it comes to hunting down and finding the right price for
  a print job.  I started to look for online sites and found a few that over instant
  quotes.  But some of the options still confuse me. <BR> <BR>I am basically looking
  for a book along the lines of: <BR> <BR>60&#43; pager B/W &#40;newsprint&#41; <BR>Glossy
  color outside B/W inside <BR>Binded <BR>5/12 by 7/12 &#40;???&#41; <BR>8k to 10k
  copies <BR> <BR>i.e. Your basic yellow pages look. <BR> <BR>One site insta-quoted
  me around $10,500 for 10k in copies at $1.041 a piece.  Is this good?  Around a
  dollar piece sounds about right. <BR> <BR>I went to a few places and 5 1/2 by 8
  1/2 seemed to be the a standard size of some sort.  <BR> <BR>So basically I am asking
  for a little guidance.  Maybe somebody has done a similar job and can give me a
  few pointers as well.  But right now I am looking to jump the hurdles of this beginning
  process. <BR> <BR>Thanks for reading. <BR> <BR>-Fav <BR> <BR>/puts thumb back into

  body: What about the font? <BR>The more lo-fi a situation &#40;especially with the
    &#34;senior&#34; angle&#41; the more that matters. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: I pulled out the new AGA Pricing and Ethical Guidelines book to check this
    out. Their pricing guide is kind of all over the place, but it helps a little.  <BR>
    <BR>It looks like they price something like this around $2,000 - $6,000 for the
    design and $60 - $150 per hour for production/preflight set up, if you have to
    do that.  <BR> <BR>The wide range of their prices is supposed to reflect things
    like the scale and intent of the project &#40;things like print run and how much
    money the the client is going to make out of it&#41; and the skill of the designer.  <BR>
    <BR>On a project like this I would get a feel for how many different types of
    content you have to manage. If it&#39;s just the address listings or do you have
    to deal with a bunch of ads or make maps or something more tedious.

  body: Hrant - What font indeed!? The person that is heading up the project wanted
    to use Comic San but I talked her out of it.  I suggested something like Myriad
    Pro?  Any other suggestions would be greatly appreciated. <BR> <BR>Jackson - I
    am going to get paid about half of that being that I getting this job through
    a marketing company. She said he has all the listings on computer file, besides
    that I dont know what I am going to do on the side.   <BR> <BR>This is a non-profit
    I should mention the person is getting a grant for this.

  body: Comic Sans. Wow. You&#39;re not kidding. <BR> <BR>Phone book type is normally
    set very small &#40;to save paper&#41; and narrow &#40;to reduce line-breaks&#41;
    - so you&#39;d need a font with a tall x-height, and no clutter. But in your case
    it&#39;s for seniors &#40;poor insight, but good reading experience&#41;, so although
    the economy issue is still there, the point size will be larger, so there&#39;s
    less demand on the x-height. If you have the Multiple-Master version of Myriad,
    you could probably generate a custom instance of weight and width that suits you
    just right. But the x-height is on the small side &#40;for this task&#41;... In
    which case you might try is a condensed cut of Poppl-Laudatio, a face that has
    a  large x-height but also distinctive flares at the ends of strokes - you could
    even use it for both small text and large. I love Laudatio. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: you could try LeMonde livre or sans by Jean Francois Porchez... <BR> <BR>it
    is very readable in small, so for seniors in a few points over it will be perfect.
    Le Monde Journal was designed for being used under 10 pts, and LeMonde Sans or
    Livre is best used over 10.  It doesn&#39;t have  a condensed version though it
    has a narrow width. you can buy it at <a href="http://www.typofonderie.com" target="_blank">http://www.typofonderie.com</a>.
