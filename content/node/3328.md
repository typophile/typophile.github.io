  in how the  <BR>eye changes the perception of the forms in a typeface with far distance
  exposure, on highways.  <BR> <BR>Please help us with your feedback, thanks. <BR>

    <BR>Is there a book, or have you been talking to James?  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: 'Nice work, Miguel. Let me see if I get your meaning on the vertical <BR>stroke
    structure: the middle sections of the glyphs generally <BR>suffer from more halo-ing,
    so the solution was to make that <BR>portion of the vertical stroke thinner? <BR>
    <BR>I predict a Montalbano swoop on this thread within a couple days. <BR>The
    sooner the better.'

  body: We dont have a referece in a book, and we dont talk with James Montabano yet.
    We are building the letters on empiric tests at this first step, comparing the
    problems who occur in common used typefaces, here in chile we found Interstate
    on highways,and Frutiger on small signages and information in buses&#40;local
    transportation&#41;. In the internet we look at Clearview now,and we want to start
    to compare some of our proposals with the Clearview typeface. <BR> <BR>1.- Clearview,

  body: 'Note that the counters of the e and a on Clearview stay open better in the
    most blurred, bottom samples.  <BR> <BR>I like the wavy stems on the full height
    letters. They have a friendliness, while being quite readable. I think on the
    mnu it might be a little much though, giving a shaky look. '

  body: It would be neat if you had a plugin for FL that auto-blurred the glyphs -
    instant preview &#39;blur mode&#39;. Then you could see almost immediately what
    the forms would look like while you&#39;re manipulating the curves.  <BR> <BR>This
    is a nice face. I think it has some huge potential. <BR> <BR>kris

    can apply extreme anti-aliasing to a vector path to get the same live blurred
    effect.'

    crit would be that the &#34;a&#34; looks a bit sloppy.

    be some sort of motion blur test too?

  body: 'Very interesting the use of irregularity on a sans serif typeface to increase
    its legibility. I like this idea.  <BR>Do you have some bibliographic reference
    about this topic? <BR> <BR>The irregularity helps to transform letter in words.
    Letters work better together than isolated.  <BR>Maybe it is also a good idea
    for a sanserif typeface for text. <BR> <BR>Another question: which will be the
    colour of the letter and of the panel?  <BR>I printed the pdf and looked the paper
    from far &#40;I have sight handicap and I could be a good tester..&#41;. It works
    very well, but I fear that the eye of &#34;e&#34; and of &#34;a&#34; is a little
    bit small. <BR>In my opinion the capital &#34;E&#34; is too much condensed. '

    commentary. Or something. Anyway, I&#39;m highly unphotogenic &#40;or just plain
    ugly&#41; so a good photo comes around like every 12 years. Hey wait, that means
    I&#39;m overdue! <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: I just stumbled across this thread.  <BR> <BR>Your comparisons and samples
    of halation look like they are computer generated. This is of no use whatsoever.
    The optics of halation are quite a complex phenomenon. The only way to truely
    get an idea of what is going on is to make signs on the appropriate retro-reflective
    material and document what happens through a carefully controlled experiment.
    <BR> <BR>Different retro-reflective materials from different manufacturers &#40;ie
    Diamond Grade, Prismatic&#41; will create different halation issues. <BR> <BR>Another
    thing to keep in mind when dealing with these sorts of fonts is their acceptability
    to the general highway engineering community. One of the reasons Clearview looks
    the way it does was it was designed to solve problems of legibility and readability
    without scaring the very conservative highway engineers with a radical &#34;designed&#34;
    solution.

  body: It seems to me most signage type in Italy follow quite raw and simplicistic
    rules. <BR>I&#39;ve had no actual problem in reading it, but this does not meen
    it can&#39;t be improved. <BR> <BR>Does anyone of you &#40;from Italy&#41; know
    who designed most of the types we found in our cities &#40;and highways&#41;.
    I&#39;m sure there&#39;s more than two alphabets around, even considering the
    condensed ones.

    Rattin told me something about this topic, but I can&#39;t remember.  <BR> <BR>About
    italian signs, it&#39;s almost impossible for me to drive in an unknown place,
    as I can&#39;t read the road signs at all...  <BR>: &#41; <BR>The all caps condensed
    bold is a big problem for me. There is too few &#42;white&#42; &#40;green, blue&#41;
    inside and between the letters, I suppose. '
