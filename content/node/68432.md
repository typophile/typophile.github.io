body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am trying to recreate this typeface for a logo for my family
  pork pies which I found in a Victorian-era photograph of my Great-great-grandfather's
  butcher's cart. \r\n\r\n[[http://www.flickr.com/photos/edwright83/4434216979/]]\r\n\r\nI
  understand that it is a hand-painted display face and is probably not available
  as a digital font, but it would be really great to get some ideas or references
  for redrawing it digitally.\r\n\r\nI've already had Zebrawood Fill as a suggestion.
  If anyone knew of a similar typeface in a sample book, I'd be most grateful for
  a reference or a hi-res scan.\r\n\r\nMany thanks, \r\n\r\nEd\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/picture_3_5402.jpg]"

  body: "Thanks for all your help, and thanks to riccard0 for the \u2018Tuscan\u2019
    tip.\r\n\r\nI think [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/solotype/quadrille-2/|Quadrille
    2]], [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/hihretrofonts/figgins-tuscan/regular|Figgins
    Tuscan]] and a bolder version of [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/scriptorium/primer/|Primer]]
    will be excellent places to start. Though the M is quite different - perhaps the
    signwriter just adapted an upside-down W?\r\n\r\nTo give you a bit more information,
    I am from a family of butchers (Wrights of York) but the family business was sold
    when I was very young and I ended up as a graphic designer. However, over the
    past couple of years I have been making pork pies to the family recipe and refining
    it for smaller-scale production. \r\n\r\nIn a couple of weeks I am entering my
    pies into the Pork Pie Appreciation Society annual competition and would like
    some branding to go with it. I thought William Wright's original signage would
    be a good place to start!"

  body: "I'm no expert in customizing fonts, but I think Primer is the one which more
    resembles the cart's sign (A, L, G's upper serif).\r\nSurely I would make the
    M from the W, and maybe a new G from a C.\r\nThen, just put it on a high-fat diet!
