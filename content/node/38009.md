  body: Is there a particular style of typeface that you are looking for? This might
    help narrow down the answer to your question, as I believe the long s is a standard
    addition to most character sets.

    need an OpenType savvy app to access them. '

  body: The long s in Arial is especially strange. Minion Pro, Garamond Premier, &
    Book Antiqua, Times New Roman on my Windows machine all have it. Myriad Pro doesn't.
    It wasn't part of the standard Type 1 encoding. You can even find it in Bickham
    Script Pro, but good luck reading it in a word.

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Paradise_Lost_6259.jpg]\r\nMost font
    managers can help you look through your fonts for such forms. This screenshot
    is from Suitcase Fusion. I used Unicode Hex Input to type U+017F in the QuickType
    area and then looked through my fonts to see which ones would display correctly."

  body: Google will help you find <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=site:fontshop.com+%22Historical+Forms%22+-docid&num=100&hl=en&safe=off&filter=0">OpenType
    fonts on FontShop.com which include Historical Forms</a>. Click on a result and
    then click the "Historical Forms" link in the sidebar. That search method is a
    little clumsy right now, but very soon FontShop's own engine will allow searching
    by OT feature.
