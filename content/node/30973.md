  body: The Typophile logo is (I think). It also seems to be the standard sans throughout.

  body: If you do a search for Gotham on this site you'll find tons of samples. As
    Brad said, it's pretty ubiquitous.

  body: "An interesting side light on Gotham came up in the TDC 'lettering tour' of
    lower Manhattan the past fall. \r\n\r\nPaul Shaw, who led the tour for the TDC,
    mentioned that there was reason why the similar wide sans which inspired Frere-Jones
    were all over Manhattan: there were in fact books of alphabets for architects,
    which were also used by sign painters. In other words, there was a very influential
    source for alphabets that was not type. These were the starting point for the
    inscriptions and signage. Frere-Jones saw these varied examples, and creatively
    developed his own version in digital type. \r\n\r\nPart of Gotham's success--like
    that of Interstate, no doubt--is that its forms were already familiar to Americans
    because of the old, common, and influential source. And, of course, Frere-Jones
    beautifully executed the 'revival'.   "
