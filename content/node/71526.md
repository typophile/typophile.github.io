  recent release of fontographer 5.  Fontlab has a comparison chart for their entire
  collection of software which can be located here http://www.fontlab.com/fontlab-products/compare/
  \r\nI suppose my primary interest is with those who have used the new Fontographer.\r\nOne
  reason the program fell the way side, it would seem, was its lack of support for
  opentype which is now included in fontographer 5.  \r\nI also feel it is important
  to hear from two groups of users, those who have historically designed the font
  in a second application such as illustrator, then imported to fontlab or fontographer,
  and those who have done the entire process within the application.  Has fontographers
  tools or workflow gotten any smoother.  Myself I am a fontlab pro user and have
  always designed in illustrator because I do not like fontlabs lack of keyboard shortcuts
  for switching between tools.\r\nAny and all constructive feedback would be greatly
  appreciated!\r\n\r\nAlso I had heard a rumor some time ago that FontLab Studio was
  coming out with version 6 but that was nearly a year ago and I have heard nothing
  new.  Anyone else heard anything?"

    inclusively the tools.\r\n\r\nAnd the ability of Fontographer 5 to generate OpenType
    fonts is the last reason, for which I would buy it, because it is not much more
    comfortable than generating them with the AFDKO.\r\n\r\nWith regard to OT production
    Fontographer 5 is a half baked thing. The combination of Fontlab Studio and the
    AFDKO is by far better.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion Fontographer 5 even does not much
    improve the workflow, if you work with FontLab Studio and Fontographer, because
    if you save a vfb file with Fontographer, that you just have imported, you seem
    to loose everything, that Fontographer is not able to make use from.\r\n\r\nIn
    my opinion the development of Fontographer 5 was a waste of the resources of the
    small developer crew. It would have been better to integrate some of its abilities,
    that are better (like the enbolding function) into FontLab and provide for the
    owners of Fontographer a more attractive update price. And additionally I would
    stop the development of Asia Studio. Maybe this would require to make FontLab
    Studio a bit more expensive, but I would prefer one perfect tool in comparison
    to three half baked tools.\r\n\r\nIf I had a budget of 399 Dollar, I would buy
    TypeTool and OTMaster."

    'fell by the wayside', I think we should look at the reasons why it has refused
    to die, it's still going strong after 24 years.\r\n\r\nFor me, its fundamental
    beauty is in the elegant, intuitive, and friendly drawing tools. Fontographer
    just makes me want to create glyphs, experiment and play with B\xE9zier curves;

    I want in one easy-to-use-straight-out-of-the-box package. Plus it's got depths
    that you can grow into when you're ready, and now it has greatly improved functionality
    thanks to FontLab's expertise.\r\n\r\nI believe that Fontographer is a better
    entry application for the designer than TypeTool, well worth the extra money,
    though I respect FontLab's strategy that FontLab Studio is for the font engineer
    (so TypeTool may be a good intro for the prospective type technician) whereas
    Fontographer is for the graphic designer or typographer who cannot afford, or
    doesn't wish, to get bogged down in the complexities.\r\n\r\nHistorically, Fontographer
    was nothing short of visionary and did so much to achieve the democratisation
    of type design. Macromedia left it to die as the Mac design community embraced
    OS X. But even stuck in Classic, and without OpenType capability, type designers
    continued to use it, and FontLab in their wisdom, and to their great credit, had
    the vision to secure it's place in their business plan and to offer the twenty-first
    century designer a real alternative.\r\n\r\nKeith / K-Type\r\nManchester UK"

  body: "And I feel contricted in a corset, when I use Fontographer. In FontLab Studio
    you can save workspaces and options. Fontographer does not seem to store the options
    in the registry. I wonder, where there are stored. I can reduce the skin of FontLab
    Studio to the things, that I need. I can switch between workspaces (although this
    actually seems to destabilize the tool). Just an example: I neither can change
    the background color of the glyph window nor I can display a grid in Fontographer.
    Even those simple things are not possible with Fontographer. Or are these hidden
    options? Really, if I am willing to invest months or years in developing a typeface,
    I don\u2019t need an oversimpled tool. I need a simple tool for tasks, that I
    have to do every third months, but not in case of a tool, that is daily in use."

    argument.  I am new to the game and FontStudio Pro is the only fore mentioned

    also have used fontforge but it never ran all that well compiled on my mac.    \r\n\r\n<cite>And

    \ I have just begun learning about substitutions with ligatures etc in open type
    and up to this point have not created a type face that took advantage of OpenType.
    \r\nI suppose it is my faulty assumption that I figured the newer application
    would handle OpenType creation better.  \r\n\r\nUltimately my curiosity comes
    from the fact that I am now in the market to buy software for home instead of
    relying on the schools applications, in my mind FontStudio would have been the
    way to go (because it is what I already began learning) but the introduction of
    Fontographer 5 made me dig deeper.  \r\n\r\nThe other part of my first comment
    was the question if FontStudio 6 was being worked on and that was primarily because
    I would put off longer on purchasing an application if I knew they were currently
    developing a new version, I will direct this question to FontLab and post back
    if they reply with anything.\r\n\r\n<cite>For me, its fundamental beauty is in

    5 and couldn't agree more, The tools don't feel archaic as they do in FontStudio
    (in my opinion)  I would say that the tools in illustrator still seem more comfortable
    but that is based of what I know and use on a daily basis.  The tools in Fontographer
    feel much more welcoming and I am now willing to give them a try where as I was
    not in FontStudio.\r\n\r\nUltimately I do not know that I will ever be much more
    than a hobbyist type designer but would love to be able to delve in as deep as
    possible some day.  It is beginning to look like Fontographer may be my purchase
    but is there anything that I may sorely miss in the near future coming from FontStudio?\r\n\r\nThanks
    for all your feedback This is really helpful to me and I am sure its benefiting
    others as well."

    FOG 5 demo, and if what you want is to feel comfortable in an Illustrator-like
    program it should be fine. To really get comfortable in Fontlab you have to spend
    so much time drawing fonts that Illustrator\u2019s drawing tools become a hindrance.
    Arno is right about the insane level of flexibility FLAB offers and how fine it\u2019s
    drawing tools are, but he\u2019s wrong to assume that everybody has time to figure
    all that stuff out. I\u2019ve been using it daily for almost four years and I
    still haven\u2019t touched at least a quarter of Fontlab Studio."

    Yuri, but they have been reluctant to talk about release dates (and I understand
    their position). If you want to start drawing today, and if you feel comfortable
    with Fontographer, go ahead! You can\u2019t work now with a software not released
    yet\u2026 ;)\r\n\r\nNow, let\u2019s see:\r\nFontLab Studio 5: US$649.00\r\nFontographer
    5: US$399.00\r\nFontLab Studio 5 Upgrade from FontLab 4.0, 3.x and Fontographer:
    US$299.00\r\n\r\nMy bet is that the charge for the upgrade to Fontlab Studio 6
    will be the same or very similar than today. If this is the case, you can purchase
    Fontographer now and upgrade to Fontlab Studio when the new version is ready and
    the difference will not be that big (US$49)\u2026 and you\u2019ll have two good
    applications (and not just one).\r\n\r\nGood luck!"

    very crashy for me on my Mac (running 10.6.3 currently). I know that's not true
    for all, so it may depend on what you do in it.\r\n\r\nRegarding your Fontographer
    concerns:\r\n\r\n1) You can make any kind of guide you like, including curves.
    Anything you can draw can be a guide. Guides are paths, just like on the outline
    layer. Same with the template layer.\r\n2) By default there are 100 levels of
    undo, but you can increase or decrease it. (My recollection is that Fontographer
    was one of the first programs that had this many levels of undo way back when.)"

    Using Auto Kern it's either 'As many as necessary' or you specify the number,
    'No more than ___ pairs'.  I think you can kern as many pairs as you like, but
    for efficiency I think the recommendation is to get your spacing right, then you
    won't need to rely too heavily on kerning.
