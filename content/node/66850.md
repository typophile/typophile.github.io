body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sadieSeafont_3585.png]\r\nGreetings...\r\nThis
  is the sign on the side of my brother's boat. We want the website to match, but
  I can't figure out what the heck font it is.\r\n\r\nIt is a little cartoonish. The
  letters are connected, as in cursive. The lower case \"a\" is closed loop, very
  unusual. The uppercase \"S\" is very odd, with a thick, rounded head, and the top
  and bottom are different. The upper case \"C\" has a vertical stroke on the top.
  Weird.\r\n\r\nI am beginning to think that it was simple hand painted. But it is
  in more than one place on the boat. So how did the artist reproduce this?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    but the rest is something else entirely.\r\n\r\nhmm... It looks like a vector
    effect may have been applied to soften the whole thing up a bit too."

  body: I think "Charters" was added later, in a slightly different font. You are
    right, there are some subtle differences.

    logo, but this might be the worst \r\npiece of typography I've seen here on Typophile.
    \r\n\r\nI'm saying this because I want to help, not bash!\r\n\r\nA quick google
    lead me to your website (I think),\r\nand what you have there is much better,
    in fact\r\neverything is better than comic sans.\r\n\r\nSo please reconsider :)\r\n\r\nGood
    luck!"

  body: "Surely \"Charters\" was constructed later using the only available letters
    from the other words (a and e).\r\nA better service to your brother would be track
    down the original (or more similar than Comic Sans, anyway)* typeface for \"Sadie
    Sea\" and rewrite all.\r\n\r\n* look at the coincidence:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/66851\r\n"

  body: "Hey... no offense taken. I didn't create it. It came with the boat.\r\n\r\nYou
    guys crack me up with how much you hate it. Perhaps we can place it in a trophy
    case on this site as the worst typeface ever seen. I'd be cool with that. I would
    find it rather amusing.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, I redid the logo on the website with another
    font. But my brother was hoping I could use the original (which is where this
    image came from).\r\n\r\nPerhaps his customers won't notice that the typeface
    on the hull is different that the typeface on the website. I'll tell him to serve
    them lots of rum and tell them they are drunk if they bring it up.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Ah Ha! I had a dream last night and it struck me as to where I have seen
    that \"S\" before. One word.... Tiki.\r\n\r\nSo I Googled \"Tiki Fonts\" this
    morning. Check out the words \"Saltwater Taffy\" here:\r\nhttp://www.curtshellerpublications.com/images/font/HouseIndustries-Tiki.png\r\nNot
    exact, but closer. That \"S\" shares that same unsymmetrical attribute.\r\n\r\nI
    found this on the Trader Vic's website.\r\nhttp://www.tradervicsgourmet.com/images/homepic_title.jpg\r\nIt
    has the cursive, and the simple looped lowercase \"a\". The \"d\" matches.\r\n\r\nHere
    there is a font that is pretty close.\r\nhttp://www.coconutinfo.com/macosxfonts.html\r\nLook
    at Pilaki Font. And it has a little background on the font: \"Based on the 'modern'
    scripts of Robert E. Smith (1940s), Pilaki's brush-written characteristics, although
    fairly common, remain popular. It's jazzy yet informal, and best of all has all
    Hawaiian pronunciation markings. You'll want its casual looks for advertising
    and sales since it's great for posters and signs.\"\r\n\r\nI think I am getting
    closer... haven't found it exactly yet. What do you all thing? Am I getting warm?"
