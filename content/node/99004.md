body: "Subject : WANTED - unicode sans font with differentiated Il1| & O0\r\n\r\nI've
  been trying to find a simple sans serif font for a specialist mathematical programming
  language that uses special symbols (available in unicode fonts). Some unicode fonts
  have inconsistent symbols sizes eg Tahoma and Verdana, DejaVu sans has advanced
  logic symbols (the round ones) that are consistent in size but larger than all the
  other symbols.   \r\n\r\nThese fonts render some or all of vertical bar, capital
  I small L and digit 1 identically.   This is unacceptable in a programming language
  where a single wrong character can cause a bug that is very difficult to trace (the
  program will look right).  Capital O and zero also need to be obviously different.
  \r\n\r\nThere are fonts that deliberately differentiate between (some) these characters,
  eg MS Reference Sans Serif has different characters for lower case L, digit 1 and
  capital i, but unfortunately the lower case L is just a vertical line and easily
  mistaken for the vertical line character which is used in programming language.\r\n\r\nIf
  anyone knows of an ideal unicode sans font, please let me know.\r\n\r\nAlternatively,
  a font designer might want to deliberately create a font that is perfect? Perhaps
  by combining two open source fonts and/or adapting an OpenSource font such as DejaVu
  Sans Unicode ?   If anyone wants to create such a font, here are more details.   For
  differentiation, the vertical bar should be the only character in the font that
  is represented as a pure vertical line. Lower case L should have a small bend to
  the right at the bottom of the stalk. Upper case i should have cross bars at top
  and bottom. Digit one should have a small angled bar at the top of the stalk on
  the left hand side.   The zero character should be narrower than the letter O, but
  not have a dot or line though it (to avoid it resembling other symbols).   The advanced
  \ logic symbols \u25CF\u25CB\u25D0\u25CD\u25C9\u25D6\u25D7 should be of similar
  size to each other and not be larger than other symbols in the font (but should
  be noticeably larger than the bullet and empty bullet symbols).   The arrows  \u2191\u2193\u2192\u2190\u2195\u2194\u2196\u2199\u2198\u2197
  should be of similar weight.   The Lucida range of symbols is almost ideal already,
  and they look nice, but are not open source.   All the other unicode fonts I have
  seen have arrows of different weights (looks bad) or logic circles that are different
  sizes (or all large and out of scale to all the other symbols in the font).\r\n\r\n\r\nFor
  any questions or answers feel free to contact me Connor - SpecialistProgLang  @

    a couple of years ago I was paid good money to develop a font for an invented
    writing system that probably nobody but the author will ever use.\r\n\r\nPeople
    do spend money on more than things that make money! It's called culture. Heck
    sometimes they even spend money on junk they don't even need, like iPads.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    you're likely to find somebody to do it for you for free, but your chances of
    getting results of even just decent quality are probably around 50%.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    help you very much, but is the general design something like what you're looking
    for?\r\n\r\nI've occasionally wondered if I should find a way of converting it
    into BDF or something so non-OS/2 users can use it..."
