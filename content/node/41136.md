  body: I believe this was drawn by [[Neville Brody]] specifically for the FUSE logo,
    not from any font. You might like his <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fontfont/ff_typeface_six/">FF
    Typeface Six</a>, though the 'S' is very different.

  body: thanks for your reply, this typeface has been suggested to me before but like
    you said the S is very different. Every other letter could quite easily be Typeface
    six bar the S.
