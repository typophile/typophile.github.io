  body: "I think you're right about being hand-drawn, The s's are tilted slightly
    and the smaller a is a different shape slightly. If you have any idea how old
    the design is, you can search for that time period. I would guess 1900s. I have
    a feeling that P is not going to be easy to find.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
