  the design community, I'm somewhat perplexed on how and who exactly it's done. Is
  the majority of font piracy done between people who know each other, or anonymously
  through the internet, or what? And is participation in it limited to students and
  hobbyists, or do professional designers themselves take part in it? And finally,
  what venue does the majority of piracy take place through (traditional websites/peer-to-peer
  networks/ect)?\r\n\r\nJust curious, I hope you guys could clarify the whole situation
  to me!"

    level. Many workgroups will actually be a licensed for a font family, but for
    far less users than actually use the software.\r\n\r\nAnd that's not to say that
    it's malicious, either. Many workgroups just have a hard time keeping track of
    which fonts are licensed for how many users. \r\n\r\nI'm sure their are also many
    individual font traders out there, but they are small potatoes compared with the
    big corporate abusers."

    fonts.\r\nIt's like, if you have to do some work for a corporation, and they use
    Meta or whatever, and you don't have it, a friend will help you out.\r\n\r\nI've
    found that large corporations are very responsible about their own software licensing,
    including fonts. They have IT people who don't want issues, and that includes
    piracy, conflicts, bad fonts, etc. Quite apart from ethics, playing it straight
    makes practical sense, you can get immediate foundry support if you have a problem,
    without having to worry whether you have a licence for the font in question.\r\n\r\nIt's
    easy for a freelance designer to acquire all the fonts from where they're working.
    Do people do that?"

  body: interesting, although corporate piracy is a significant portion of font piracy,
    I was more interested in piracy done by individuals.

  body: "Many organizations (businesses, non-profits, schools, churches, etc.) often
    put up fonts for download on their website that that employees/memebers/the public
    can read/write their internal documents. In the vast majority of cases, these
    entities do not realize that they are violating IP or EULAs.\r\n\r\nP2P file-sharing
    is also a big piracy chanel. In some ways, I think it has replaced the role that
    static websites used to play in sile \"sharing\"."

  body: "I would assume that many designers use a lot of pirated fonts when they start
    out, simply because they can't afford to pay thousands of dollars  for fonts and
    have small clients who don't want to pay for them either. For instance, how many
    graphic design students do you think really own all the (hundreds of) fonts they
    use at their home computers?\r\n\r\nI think most people gradually drop the practice
    as they become more established and start to work for larger clients. For a really
    well known designer doing very visible work for an established firm it would be
    stupid to use unlicenced fonts, as well as unethical.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am aware
    of people who illegally copy fonts to use when they try out alternatives for a
    design. When the customer accepts something, they'll buy the font. Personally
    I can't see anything much wrong with this approach, since it helps designers without
    hurting foundries in any obvious way."

    find out what is actually going on? I would think that maybe the new Monotype/Linotype
    joint owners might be interested in funding such a survey, as they now own most
    of the classic fonts. '

  body: Yes, I saw that article on typophile several weeks ago and I was suprised
    that a publisher (who should be familiar with the amount of work individuals invest
    in prodjects like books, records, and type and with with the design industry)
    would alllow that to happen. Its one thing for it to affect a company like BP,
    or General Electric, or another big conglomerate were most people don't realize
    that things like typefaces need to be licensed, but quite different with something
    like a publishing house.

  body: "Actually I think the opposite would be true - large companies such as GE
    and BP would be more likely to have their desktops controlled, administered and
    locked down to prevent unauthorized software from being loaded. They'll also have
    corporate typefaces used for communications, limiting the need for employees to
    have a large number of unlicensed fonts.\r\n\r\nAs for the piracy angle I think
    there are two distinct groups of potential offenders. There are the collectors
    who just want to have as many fonts as they can, much like the neighbor who hoards
    cats. And then there\u2019s the guy who \u2018needs\u2019 a font for a project
    and will ask around, search the web etc., to locate it. As Bruno said at TypeCon
    the goal of Font Explorer X is to make it easier and cheaper for that type of
    user to license a font than find a pirate copy. This is going to be hard. I\u2019ve
    had various end-user email me over the years saying \u201CI\u2019ve just spent
    the last five hours searching for a free version of font X\u201D \u2013 essentially
    putting the value of their time at 4 bucks an hour. :-(\r\n\r\n"

    geographic area and have a large number of employees, their corporate typefaces
    would have to be loaded on a large number of computers and given to people who
    aren't familiar with the legalities of font licensing. Also, she sher number of
    people employeed by the company, it would be more diffucult to control distribution
    of software to an unauthorized end-user.\r\n\r\nI know for a fact that both of
    these companies had public or insufficiently secured brand websites. GE Brand
    Center was completely open, and BP Brand had just one username/password, brand/beyond.

    font piracy that use the Internet. All of these have some sort of legitimate use,
    but the proportion of non-pirate activity varies widely. Some examples....<ul>\r\n<li>Certain
    Usenet binaries groups\r\n<li>font sharing groups on Yahoo\r\n<li>peer-to-peer
    filesharing networks\r\n<li>Web sites that offer free font downloads\r\n</ul>\r\n"

    Myriad or Avenir for the world to download, instead of the custom font they paid
    Monotype to make? \r\n\r\n"
