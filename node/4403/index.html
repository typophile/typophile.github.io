		<div class="commentbody">Dylan &ndash; <BR> <BR>Thanks for your private message asking about a sans complement for Whitman. I'm pleased that you're considering it. I thought I'd reply on the forum, since I get this question frequently. <BR> <BR>Pairing sans and serif is, I think, one of the most basic ways to create a sense of typographic style; and as such, it can be very much a matter of personal taste. So, don't take anything I say about this with any more weight than anyone else just because I designed Whitman.  <BR> <BR>Nevertheless, here are some pairings that I've seen or tried myself: <BR> <BR>Will Powers paired Whitman with Franklin Gothic Condensed in a book he did for MnHS Press. In general, I think anything along these lines &ndash; Franklin Gothic, FB's Benton Gothic/Sans, Nick Shinn's Brown Gothic &ndash; makes a solid companion. <BR> <BR>In my own work, I've paired Whitman with Vectora &ndash; one of my favorite sans. It's a tricky combo if you mix them in line, since the x-heights are vastly different. But I like the forms together. <BR> <BR>I'm working on a how-to book right now for which I'm using Whitman paired with Gotham. I rather like it. I've also seen this combo used pretty well in a small startup magazine called <i>Revenue.</i> <BR> <BR><i>The Virginia Quarterly Review</i> pairs Whitman with Bliss to great success. <BR> <BR>A more unusual combo is Whitman with Cyrus Highsmith's Relay, used by a Finnish young women's style magazine, <i>Trendi</i>. <BR> <BR>I've also wanted to try pairing Whitman with FF Kievit. I think the neutrality of both would make a nice combination where transparency is desired. But I haven't found the right opportunity yet. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/34154.gif" alt="Whitman Pairings"> <BR> <BR>HTH <BR> <BR>&ndash; K. <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Dylan &ndash; <BR> <BR>Naturally, I'm pleased with your choice. I hope Whitman behaves well and performs to your expectations. <BR> <BR>Incidentally, if you are still working in Quark, I have customized suitcases that I'd be happy to give you. They are modified to allow Quark to do its auto fi- and fl-lig substitution. They are also combined into two suitcases &ndash; one for LF and the other for OsF &ndash; and are style-linked for Bold and Italic.  <BR> <BR>Let me know and I'll send you copies. <BR> <BR>(That's one downside of the FB model which allows you to purchase individual styles and weights &ndash; it means that you get delivered all these individual suitcases. As opposed to the very nicely combined and linked families from HTF, for instance.) <BR> <BR>If you're working in InDesign, then it's moot &ndash; Indy will do f-lig subs anyway (but not the ff-ligs, because they're nonstandard FB encoding). And style-linking is screwed in Indy. It's a known bug. I don't know if they fixed it for CS. (Thomas?) <BR> <BR>&ndash; K. <BR> <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">FF Acanthus is a good suggestion: one of the undeservedly overlooked and underused typefaces. <BR> <BR>Personally, for a work horse typeface I would go for a Dutch oldstyle, not a German romantic like Walbaum. Fred Smeijer's <a href="http://www.ourtype.com/">Arnhem</a> is one of my current favourites, and seems less pricey than many of the recent Dutch fonts.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>&gt;This style-linking issue - I'm not aware of it, but I'm curious.</i> <BR> <BR>In Indy, you can only style type italic or bold (i.e., from the keyboard) when there is an actual designed version. This is, in general, a good thing &ndash; no faked obliques or smeared bolds. <BR> <BR>But the bug is that with nonstandard family structures, Indy makes some weird decisions. So, for instance, with Whitman, if you're working with text in RomanOsF and then style a word to italic, Indy will make it ItalicLF. Then if you unstyle it by repeating the italic command, you'll get RomanLF. Or, under certain circumstances, you'll go back to SmallCapsLF. This sort of thing. <BR> <BR>I seem to remember that which fonts change to which varies depending upon how you have your fonts loaded (font management vs. system vs. Adobe app folders). Mark Record (FB tech guy) and I spent a bit of time trying to troubleshoot this until we finally realized it was a bug that we couldn't do anything about. <BR> <BR>And it's not just Whitman. I experienced the same problem with Frutiger (from Adobe). IIRC, Frutiger 45 (Light) went to 56 (Italic), then back to 55 (Roman) &ndash; or something similar.  <BR> <BR>Bottom-line: the style-linking is screwy. Which is a pain for someone who does a lot of formatting from the keyboard or with tagged text. <BR> <BR>Thomas, glad to hear it's better in CS. I'll have to upgrade one of these days (just too lazy) and try it out. <BR> <BR>&ndash; K. <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Kent: <BR>You should just add duplicates of the ff ligs in your fonts, named as InD expects, i.e. &quot;ff&quot;, &quot;ffi&quot;, and &quot;ffl&quot;. I'm pretty sure InD will use them then. I don't think they have to be encoded, and you can leave the ligs in the FB positions as well for the unconverted Quarkers.</div>

The downside is that there won't be any kerning for these ligs (which would really only affect the ff-lig, actually).  <BR> <BR>This would really come down to FB, and I don't see them taking the time to do this.
