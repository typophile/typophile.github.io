body: "Intuitively it seems to me that readability in moderately contrasting seriffed
  romans increases along the series vertical axis, oblique axis, variable axis, divergent
  interior and exterior axes. Would it be ridiculous to suggest that oblique axis
  spreads letter-differentiating information across a larger portion of the word,
  away from, as in vertical axis, the top of the vowel height; that variable axis
  positions differentiating information at different points on letters and so makes
  them more readily distinguishable, as well as spreading information across the word;
  and that divergence between the axes of partially or wholly enclosed counters and
  exterior outlines increases the perceived contrast between black and white themselves,
  allowing white portions of the word, as in Legato, to unite perceptually? Naturally,
  divergent interior and exterior axes are not incompatible with variation in either
  from letter to letter, and in fact in my fiddlings the impression of strength that
  comes from divergent interior and exterior axes is diminished if those axes and
  that divergence are too consistent across the alphabet.\r\n\r\nI posted this idea
  to an old thread, then saw it was off-topic; I would love to hear what our readability
  experts have to say on the matter."

  body: "George,\r\n\r\nI like your suggestion very much. It isn't ridiculous because
    it is a long way from being proven or disproven, and also because it is intriguing.
    Could this help explain why Jenson's highly irregular and variable type is considered
    so ideal, so satisfying? The letter shapes have a lot of variable stress, alignments,
    bowl shapes, serifs and apertures that add up to a lot of divergence, not only
    in the letters (black) but the space as well (white). Surely this is functional
    and not merely aesthetic. "

  body: 'Yes - and, ignoring axis for the moment, it is particularly in the lower
    half of the x-height that most digital romans are insufficiently divergent compared
    to Jenson''s or Griffo''s types. Unless it turns out that more attention is payed
    to the top of the x-height such that small irregularities of rhythm/pattern there
    are useful, but not further down; even then all information will presumably be
    preserved to some extent or other. '

  body: "George, wonderfully provocative post. I might prefer to replace the term
    'readability' here with 'ease of visual wordform resolution.' As I see it, visual
    wordform resolution is the pivotal perceptual processing event in reading, and
    depends on cross-letter binding. If one  presumes that too much regularity makes
    the patternednes of a configuration salient and self-asserting, compromising--rather
    than solidifying--the self-assertion for perception of the configuration's object-like
    integrity through effective binding, your  sequence is just what one might expect.\r\n\r\nThis
    presumption about regularity strikes me as potentially testable. \r\n\r\nYour
    series of contrast-types reads: modern / oldstyle / transitional / postmodern;
    or: expansion / translation / translation + rotation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/][img:sites/default/files/old-images/][img:sites/default/files/old-images/][img:sites/default/files/old-images/]"

    body: "Thanks Peter; I was hoping you might be goaded into response. \r\n\r\nIt's
      just the old, old story of preventing Figure from disappearing into Ground,
      isn't it? As, very literally, in the rhythm of prose and poetry (Reuven Tsur
      constructed a very plausible model of how the brain chunks rhythm, programmed
      it on a computer, and fed it, if I remember correctly, ten thousand pieces of
      text. Gratifyingly, the <a href='http://www.ccel.org/m/milton/lost/paradise_lost_1.html'>opening
      of Paradise Lost</a> came out top in resisting chunking).\r\n\r\nI am intrigued
      by the possibility of testing. It shouldn't be too hard, should it? Indeed the
      raw materials have almost been assembled in families like Century, though naturally
      one would prefer to construct a type family for the experiment which was rigorously
      controlled as to each letter's proportions, spacing, total darkness and contrast.
      \r\n\r\nI think my series reads: \r\nModern / Humanist / Baroque / The Best,
      or\r\nExpansion / Translation / Rotation / Pure Type,\r\nsince a much larger
      number of historical types show divergent axes within single letters than is
      regularly acknowledged: sticking to what I know best, Griffo's work (his italics
      especially) and Bembo are examples. "

  body: "Scientism is bunk.\r\nReading is primarily a cultural phenomenon, not physiological.\r\nIn
    America, reading became a national obsession starting c.1870. Public education
    and libraries were instituted, and an explosive growth of popular magazines, newspapers,
    and dime novels occurred from 1885 thru 1905.\r\nAlmost without exception, the
    text types of the new mass media were moderns (didone), or \"old styles\" with
    vertical stress.\r\nIf the modern style is so inimical to reading, why were these
    types preferred?\r\nThe same could be said about sans serifs on the internet.\r\n\r\nI
    would argue that the older forms are favored towards the end of an historical
    cycle, and divergency has nothing to do with it, other than being a marker of
    a media's maturity."

    the internet partly because the low resolution of screens has a greater impact

    because the proportion of reading on the internet which is immersive is vanishingly
    small. What is a historical cycle? And what, really, is scientism? Explanationism? '

  body: "<em>...at different levels of magnification.</em>\r\n\r\nPhysiologically,
    the process of reading -- saccadic scanning -- is the same for a one word headline
    as a paragraph of text. \r\n\r\n<em>Vertical stress types were not preferred from
    1870 to 1905, they were the inherited norm.</em>\r\n\r\nTrue, but if they had
    posed any serious problem to the emergence of mass literacy during this period,
    I suspect that an alternative would have been found. Surely logic would indicate
    that the boom didn't happen in spite of the type styles that were in use, but
    <em>because</em> of them.\r\n\r\n<em>...the proportion of reading on the internet
    which is immersive is vanishingly small. </em>\r\n\r\nThat rather begs the question
    of how much or how deep reading has to be to be considered immersive. Personally,
    I would consider any average length David Berlow post on Typophile to fit the
    bill. \r\n\r\n<em>And what, really, is scientism?</em>\r\n\r\n\"The belief that
    the investigative methods of the physical sciences are applicable or justifiable
    in all fields of inquiry.\"\r\n\r\nDesign is a piece of turf fought over by science
    and art. At the other end of the spectrum from science: \"The only thing that
    matters in art is what cannot be explained\" (Braque). \r\n\r\nBraque was contrasting
    art with literal criticism, but I don't see typography and design as part of this
    either/or scenario, because it's not a question of whether something may or may
    not be explained; with design things are best demonstrated, which is a horse of
    a different colour. "

  body: "<cite>\u2026at different levels of magnification.</cite>\r\nSorry to be unclear,
    I meant that reading involved physiological and cultural reception and response
    at different metaphorical levels of magnification.\r\n\r\nThe historical evidence
    is plain that condensed modern faces did not make reading impossible, but logic
    certainly does not dictate that the boom in reading happened because of these
    types: I would say that social, economic and literary explanations are more plausible.\r\n\r\nAnd
    we might as well seek to know and understand what in type design can be known
    and understood, if, as seems likely, the benefits to type design of this knowledge
    outweigh the possible drawbacks (like the overweighting of what is known limiting
    the practical choices of designers to their disadvantage and that of their work)."
