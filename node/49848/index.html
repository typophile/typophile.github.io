<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>In August 2008 someone from Brest, France bought my font Logotypia Pro from MyFonts:
http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fdi/logotypia-pro/
That same person is also registered for the website of a type foundry from Brest, France:
http://www.gasoligne.com/
One month after the purchase a new font is released at this foundry:
http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/gasoligne/urqinoa/
Every glyph was modified more or less, but looking at the character map there is no doubt, that this font is directly based on the digital data of my font Logotypia Pro. They even kept all my beginner's mistakes from 2004.
Here is an overlay of both fonts:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bild12_3455.png]
So, if you are a typedesigner, please have a look at their <a href=http://www.gasoligne.com/download.htm>current</a> and <a href=http://www.gasoligne.com/in_progress.htm>future</a> designs to check if one of your fonts was also ripped off. </div>
<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Maybe this also RIP-OFF

<div class=commentbody>keep in mind that these <em>modifications</em> result in substandard typefaces. just compare Aura to Korsen -- where did that &lsquo;y&rsquo; come from!? people who will be enticed by these poor pieces of <em>work</em> are probably not in the market for quality typefaces anyway. no excuse for the company's behavior, but hopefully some consolation.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I don't know if this is true or not, I've never had to check. But at college I was told if you modify a typeface by at least 20% then its considered original (in the law's eyes). Which in this case would explain why they took the time to modify each letter - to not break copyright laws (although its still a blatant and shocking rip-off).</div>

<div class=commentbody>Much to my surprise, Myfonts alias Bitstream removed the forgeries:
http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/gasoligne/urqinoa/
The is astonishing, because the Bitstream outfit sells thousands of forgeries, besides its own forgeries made by David Berlow, Matthew Carter, Mike Parker and the other rip-off experts who forged the Linotype fonts described in http://www.forgers.de/bitstream2.pdf.
For historians of font forgeries, I append a few statements about this Gasoligne font forging outfit from the shut-down website:

Gasoligne® is a new french independent digital type foundry, born from the passion of 2 brothers for grafizm.
Gasoligne® designs, manufactures and sells high quality typefaces.
This website is the best and first place in the world to find our typefaces.
Professionnels.
Nous réalisons des polices d'écritures générales disponibles à la vente auprès des professionnels et particuliers, mais réalisons également tous types de commandes spéciales.
En effet l'identité d'une marque, d'une société passe par son logo, sa communication commerciale et publicitaire mais plus encore que le message lui-même, l'écriture dessinant ce message devient identitaire. C'est pourquoi nous réalisons également des polices d'écritures exclusives. Nous pouvons également décliner une police à partir de votre logo. Nous répondons à toutes vos demandes.
Qualité et fiabilité.
Nous proposons à la vente nos créations de polices d'écritures, mais avant cela nous étions nous-mêmes clients et le sommes toujours ! C'est pour cela que nous apportons à nos créations ce que nous attendons des autres : des réalisations rigoureuses. Avant toute mise en vente nous réalisons de multiples tests et essais de nos créations en version béta, qui sont remaniées de très nombreuses fois jusqu'à ce que nous en soyons rééllement et complètement satisfait. Votre satisfaction est la nôtre.
Expérience.
Fort de plusieurs années de créations dans le monde du graphisme et de la calligraphie, le développement professionnel nous a amené à cette typofonderie qui constitue l'aboutissement d'un projet. Mais ce projet marque désormais le commencement d'un nouveau développement dont de nombreux partenaires professionnels font déjà partie.

<div class=commentbody>Hi Typophile community!
I agree with Therese Brockie, being judge, jury and executionner on this case is a bit too much...
About Korsen, it's similar to aura, the same sci-fi spirit I mean... but miniskip http://www.dafont.com/fr/miniskip.font , epyval http://www.searchfreefonts.com/free/epyval.htm or the caps of cabourg http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/cabourg/light/charmap.html are also too... the design is close but different... I am more worried about the share of commercial fonts or the copy of existing design distributed freely... some font recently released like Flavour from Hubert Jocham is really close from P22 Pooper Black, and how about CK tea Party and Clarissa???, there is plenty examples...
For me a same spirit design can't be associated to ripping without evidence...
Just my opinion :)</div>

I never spoke of "personal" data. Margor is correct. There is nothing personal about the postal address of a company and about the name of the manager of this company. Who thinks that such public company data must not be told should have his head examined in a loony bin.

I only stated the name of the manager (French: gérant) prescribed by law. The name of the manager of a company is not "personal information", but information prescribed by law. For obvious reasons, this manager tried to hide his identity which is forbidden. According to European Community laws, it is illegal for internet companies to keep secret the identity of the manager who is liable for the company.
Germans may read this:
http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impressumspflicht
Since the Typophile moderators protects shady outfits who sell ripped-off fonts, it is understandable that the name of the manager was removed by the moderators in order to make it difficult for the deceived buyers to claim damages for having bought ripped-off fonts, especially now that the shady outfit shut down the website and went into hiding so that the dimwitted font buyers will have difficulty to find out the address of the manager.
However, victims of the shady Gasoligne outfit may contact me for the address of the manager or "gérant".
The imprint at my website http://www.sanskritweb.net/imprint.htm contains my real name and address prescribed by law (although my website is a private website).

YOU decided that their fonts were ripping...
are you a lawyer, a judge, an internet-cyber-cop or an official organism who can decide if it's ripping or not?... I don't think so ;)
So as Ralf Hermann said "the Gasoligne Foundry has announced to stop selling fonts alltogether. So the removal from MyFonts was initiated by Gasoligne. Case closed."

<div class=commentbody>What qualifies as a rip off?
In my opinion most type design starts from some other type design.
At school I was taught to draw type based on the ancient Roman style, namely the capitals on Hadrian's column.
Is Trajanus a rip off then?
I don't think so.
I am 69 years old, soon to be seventy. I started out as a lettering artist at a large London advertising agency in the fifties. These were the days before photosetting and digital type. Every art director at that company would ask me to draw the headlines "like" some typestyle or another.
Having read most of the posts here, it seems to me that there is a difference between plagiarism and copyright theft. I have assumed that by rip off, plagiarism is what is meant.

Just this week flyers were passed around our neck of the woods. Apparently a convicted font forger is moving in down the street. I've warned the kids to stay away from that house as they have no idea where those fonts have been. They could easily be tainted with nasty auto-tracing and dangerous kerning.
The biggest fear is the culprit soliciting kids on the street and passing out illicit floppies from a font lab in the basement. Illegal font labs are a real menace. Once discovered they have to scrub the entire property hauling out all sorts of toxic bits and bytes. A real mess.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Agendia & Co: I fail to see "many similarities" except that all three belong to the same genre, to which you may also add Jeremy Tankard's Alchemy and others. I only speak of same genre, not same quality.
Whether plagiarism or not depends. I assume Ralf knows his own outlines well enough to see if somebody merely moved some nodes or changed details, indicated by his remark "They even kept all my beginner’s mistakes from 2004."
With Aura/Korsen it <em>could</em> be a different case: The simpler the idea, the more geometric or pixelated typefaces get, and the coarser their grids, the more likely it is that such typefaces look very much the same. But it seems it <em>is not</em> a different case as indicated by details: e.g. in <em>both</em> typefaces, the rounding in bottom horizontal of "e" and top horizontal of "a" direct outwards rather than inwards (as would seem more "natural" to me).</div>

Your joke is similar to one of the best jokes I ever saw on Typophile written by ChrisL. It described the bizarre Berthold lawsuits concerning the generic trademarks "city", "grotesque", "ligature", "accidence" etc. ChrisL wrote:
<cite>"Will New York City have to change its name now for fear of a law suit from Berthold? What about the classic film "City Lights"? That's of course too silly, so silly it is grotesk. (OOOPS!!) I didn't mean to say GROTESK, it was just an akzident; I mean I said it akzidently, err, accidently. It was a grotesque accident! Oh, crap, I live in a city and created a grotesque accident! DUCK!!! I hear the sound of lawyers zipping their briefs! I was so font of grotesque accidents in the City untill lawyers started Ligaturegation--er ligagation, darn litigation!!! OK!

Uli, this is one more example of you making a claim that simply is not true and it is laughable. Aside from Chris' jokes, the things that comes out of Uli's mouth are truly the most humorous around here.
I, too, find the sudden disappearance of the foundry and their fonts somewhat telling. I have been in touch with "our friend" over at Gasoligne, and he is making some interesting and ridiculous claims on this issue. I advised him that if he wants to defend himself and has nothing to hide, he should consider participating here as well as offline with other parties involved.

<div class=commentbody>Wow, what have I started here!? ;-)
On the matter of inspiration vs. rip-offs:
There is no useful font without inspiration from other typefaces. We always built our work on other peoples work. But that's not the point here. In every little detail, in every curve and anchor point of Logotypia Pro I made lots of design decisions. No other type designer would make these choices in an identical way, even if this person would digitize my font from a print-out. So when I look at the font mentioned in the first post, I clearly see a font, that was build from the outlines of Logotypia Pro. This is a violation of the End User License Agreement and must be stopped. It's not a question of an "inspired" type design.
I contacted the Gasoligne foundry and they took their website down within minutes after my email and also asked MyFonts to remove the fonts. There is nothing more for me to ask for. I don't know if their other fonts are rip-offs. That's why the title of this thread has a question mark and that's why I asked other designers to have a look at the Gasoligne fonts.
I also knew the name and address of the Gasoligne owner when I started this thread, but there was no need to point this information out to anybody here. I have no reason to denunciate or defame the Gasoligne owner in any way aside from the (to me obvious) case of Logotypia vs. Urqinoa. He has made a mistake and he has reacted as quickly as possible when it came to light. So I'm fine with that and I don't hold a grudge against him (any more). We all make mistakes sometimes, don't we?

Clarissa from paratype/typadelic and CK Tea Party from Scrapnfonts...
Ralph, in your first post you say that the person bought your font on myfonts and one month later Urqinoa was released, but if they're "criminals" like Uli and others said I think it's a little "bizarre" that they bought it... it only take few minutes to find your Logotypia pro for free on instant download on the net...
I'm new here but I got the feeling that most of members are more here to destroy some reputation and people :/
in this way I understand why they decided to stop selling fonts...</div>

Vivio Russ:
I did not say that he who ran this Gasoligne outfit is a "criminal". Others in this thread used the word "criminals" as a misnomer, but not me. Forging fonts as such is no crime, whereas forging banknotes as such is a crime (at least most countries). Since typophilers have obviously never read any penal code, they think erroneously that he who is speaking of forgeries is necessarily speaking of crimes. But this is child-like thinking. It depends on what your forge, e.g. banknotes, cheques, signatures, paintings, fonts, etc. Fonts are no banknotes. Got it?</div>

If you use the digital data of those fonts, you violate the End User Licence Agreements. Again: that's(!) the problem discussed in this thread and I also made this very clear in my first post. It's not about stylistic similarities. It's about building and selling a new font based on the digital data of another font.

Please don't try to turn this whole story upside down. It almost sounds as I have put an honorable men out of business by making false accusation. The website of Gasoligne was closed immediately after I had written them an email about the case. This reaction can be only be understood as an confession of guilt. If my claims were unjustified, why should they react in such a way?
As I have previously said: I just needed to stop the selling of the Logotypia rip-off. I have no reason to tell anybody the name of the Gasoligne owner, nor am I interested in "destroying anyones reputation".
Uli might have a different approach in dealing with his "funny font forging industry", but that's a different story. Please don't lump us all together. </div>

So Why didn't you settled the problem with the owner just between you and him (and not on public place)?... I think you tried to put discredit on this foundry: even if they made a mistake creating a font close to your design, you said "if you are a typedesigner, please have a look at their current and future designs to check if one of your fonts was also ripped off"... It's a direct call to person likes Uli... also you wrote "This reaction can be only be understood as an confession of guilt" which is an easy shortcut for me, I hope you will never be in a jury ;)</div>

Vivio Russ's comments are utterly ridiculous. Since you are from Italy, why don't you defend Silvio Berlusconi. Instead of "font forgeries", you could defend his "election forgeries".

<div class=commentbody><cite>"Uli, that’s because “forgery” is the wrong word. You should have noticed by now that you’re the only person who uses it this way."</cite>
Cerulean (Mr. Pease):
Mazzone uses the word "copyfraud" instead of "(copyright notice) forgery".
I suggest that you read his highly instructive 70-odd-page treatise about "copyfraud" published in this American law journal:
see http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=787244
I repeatedly said that fonts are non-copyrightable and that users who, by way of EULA, pay for "copyright" licences to non-copyrightable fonts must be considered utter dimwits who can be most easily taken for a ride.
In his treatise, Mazzone came to the conclusion that not only ordinary Americans, but even American law students are dimwitted to such extent that they can be tricked into believing that they have to pay for "copyright" licences to non-existing copyrights, e.g. even for the "privilege" to quote from the American constitution. Mazzone writes on page 1028:
<cite>"A stunning example: A pocket version of the Constitution popular among law students contains a copyright notice, along with the admonition that “[n]o part of this publication may be reproduced or transmitted in any form or by any means . . . without permission in writing from the publisher. Whatever the Constitution’s framers and ratifiers had in mind when they authorized Congress to create copyright law, they surely did not expect that somebody would one day claim a copyright in the Constitution itself."</cite>
Is America an asylum for dimwits?</div>
