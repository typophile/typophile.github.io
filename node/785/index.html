		<div class="commentbody">&quot;This was mentioned by the brilliant lettering artist and type designer Keith Tam in another thread. It is a great deal. I have a pessimistic opinion of why more teachers don't push this, but I think it should be a mandatory purchase. Train them straight away that purchasing fonts is the way to go. &quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Just a guess, but it's probably because the fonts are Opentype, and since they're from Adobe they're probably going to be full featured Opentype.  And, being that schools still pretty much only teach Quark, they can't take advantage of the extended features in the fonts. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Quark is shooting themselves in the foot by not, first, going Unicode, and second, by not including Opentype support.</div>

THEY DON'T BUY FONTS. And folks who have to use fonts for a living pretty much depend upon technically functional fonts, so most free fonts are relatively useless. I collect free fonts, but I don't think I've ever used one. I simply find it an interesting historical phenonmenon. I'm not saying that all commercial fonts are technically functional either, but most of the better known foundries can be trusted in this regard. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The whole &quot;free font&quot; thing has been made to be a bigger deal than it really is (by the commercial vendors).

Both supportive of its tenacity and disapproving of its vulgarness. It's common knowledge that more people will speak their minds when something offends their sensibilities, than when something strikes their fancy. We certainly heard more complaints than huzzahs, but it the long run, the quieter folks spoke with their wallets - and the foundries rejoiced. I consider the arse de chien a successful campaign, thank you very much. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I am also thankful that our designers resisted the temptation to animate the aforementioned item.</div>

Thanks.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(I'm sorry that my comments are apparently so unfeeling or out of touch so as to give you the idea that I'd appreciate Mr Berlusconi.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And yes: from now on, I'll keep my non-type opinions to myself.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sincere apologies to the group. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->'darrel' said <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;Of course, pirated fonts aren't a  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;good thing, as they do certainly  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;hurt sales&ndash;but not quite to the extent  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;the intellectual property companies  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;(foundries, music labels,  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;moview industry, software companies, etc.)  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;make it out to be. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don't at all mean to be smug, but, how exactly do you know that? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The third-party organizations in the US and UK and presumably elsewhere that cite the amounts of  revenue potential that software piracy drains from various entities (who expect to be collecting such revenue), cite only as the result of taking and closely analyzing detailed surveys repeatedly, over time. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Some extrapolation might be necessary, and as such, they might actually be only as generally accurate as a typical countrywide population census might be, but how can you strongly infer that they purposely lie by inflating the numbers? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If you're privy to some authenticated survey document that reveals inflation of survey results, I'd love to see it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->By the way, these discussions about profit make me cringe, too. I did not get into type thinking about profit. I got into it for the type and what I thought could be done with it esthetically. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The tax people eventually want designers seeming to be in business to eventually declare whether they're hobbyists or really in a for-profit enterprise, so in my case, I chose the latter. (I never felt right about starting a type company as a non-profit - in the sense that the Internal Revenue Service defines non-profit.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Along with being in business for oneself comes a lot of responsibilities. I think that if what I do is any good at all, that I should be able to expect a fair return on its sales. I also think that I should be able to expect others to respect my property. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pirates subvert both those basic, human expectations. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And for what?  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The pirate seeks to steal my property and upload it to others, dilute my revenue potential and wreak my business and my life, and break my artistic spirit, all to make themselves look cool? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->How exactly does that make them the big man, except to other thieves, other thugs? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sorry. I don't see the aura in it worthy of worship. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I look at a font pirate who takes and blindly uploads, and I see a selfish, immature, pitiful, very misguided person looking for love and acceptance while making some of the worst life choices possible for themselves. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think it's especially hard to forgive pirates who rip off dozens of companies, and do uploads that go on for hours or days at a time. I'd say that kind of heartlessness doesn't change. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In my case, I know this about font pirates:  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->We spent much of the '90s being ripped off by pirates who one might expect to see in a list of names, and by others whom one might be surprised to see there.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->They kept me from properly providing for my 84 and 92 year old grandparents when they came to live with us in '98, no longer able to care for themselves. They pretty much took out of my wallet money for my son's college education. Another family member, formerly employed here, is now clinically depressed because of how they took dealing with auditing the ongoing font theft problems. (I guess everyone reacts differently, some being more emotionally fragile than others.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->No, they haven't broken my spirit. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->With it all (and believe me, it's considerable torture), I'm actually sad for the so-called pirates.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I believe that the only way to demonstrate that such pirates have made an effort to effect change in themselves would be to do this: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- Deliver a sincere, signed, written letter of apology  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->  to each foundry ripped off.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->  Ideally, to each artist, since we  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->  are talking about individual human beings  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->  being ripped off. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- Destroy the pirated copies they have, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->  recommend to those who follow them, to do the same. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- Make some effort at starting a long-term  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->  repayment of some token amount of money. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->  (It's like with loaning money to a family  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->  member or friend, where you expect to be  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->  paid back, but they never quite do. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->  Even some token effort would show they care.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The ripoffs are about personal decisions, about property and (for better or worse) about money (read, in tax terms: current revenues unrealized). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It seems logical to me that a mere &quot;Well, you know, I've matured now&hellip;&quot; really doesn't cut it and actually just exhibits zero maturation and more antisocial behavior. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->To those who continue to pirate commercial fonts: You are seeing the fonts as something that they are not, nor were ever intended to be. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Speaking in general: Collect all the freeware, non-pirated, non-cloned, non-autotraced, public domain fonts you want. But if you want our fonts intended for retail commercial sale, be sure you have a license or bill of sale to document that they should legally be present on your computer(s). <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now, we actively notify the U.S. Treasury Department and other official bodies charged with going after entities that misuse or defile U.S. Trademarks, copyrights, etc. What a pain. But that's what they're paid to do. So now, if pirates won't heed my simple plea to stop, they'll eventually open their door to a uniformed agent. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Regarding the music industry fight (for example, via RIAA): Unless it's in the public domain, contrary to popular belief, it isn't 'your' music (meaning 'the fans' music'). It is the property of the rights holder (who may or may not be the original creator). It's only a matter of time before that whole issue is settled. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I also support the antipiracy effort the movie industry is mounting anew. The informative commercial before 'Spy Kids 3-D' last weekend was very good. (Although I couldn't understand why the URL to find out more, at the end, was flashed for about a second. Way too brief.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The light at the end of the tunnel, for audio and video pirates first, really is an oncoming train. Unfortunately, I think a lot of confused kids (and their parents) are going to get some very unpleasant surprises. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It could all be avoided if people simply took stock again of what constitutes others' property. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'll just leave my opinion on that there. I really don't want to keep getting off the type track. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But what you see going on with the RIAA? I believe that it's just a matter of time - measured shortly - that the commercial type industry starts to adopt the same tactics. Piracy has made it necessary. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Joe <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

That's been well known since the dawn of desktop publishing.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nearly two decades of police-accompanied raids on those businesses documented by the third-party monitoring organizations now have many thousands of logs of what software was present at the point of the raid. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There is plenty of data (and would have been by 1995) to get an accurate enough picture of the extent of piracy. An honestly accurate enough view. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fantasy guesswork (again, I'd call it 'educated guesswork' since it's by professionals who have data collected to start with, and then extrapolate data professionally for a living) happens all the time in business projections.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I've watched the type industry for 30 years, and the microcomputer software industry since the early '80s, and I've never gotten the impression that there has been any effort to inflate piracy figures. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I run a business. I want the numbers to be as accurate as possible. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;Those with an interest in making the financial <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;cost to the industry seem as large as possible  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;can simply assume that every pirate copy has  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;cost the industry the full retail price in  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;lost revenue.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->No. Sometimes it would have been a discounted price.

People will go see it and/or buy the DVD if they like it. Those pirating it probably aren't willing to fork over the $8 to see it in the theater anyways. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The current problem with inellectual property owners and distributors is their complete lack of trust in their own consumers.

It completely boggles the mind how the RIAA is working right now and what they are getting away with. Gotta agree with Hrant. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;em&gt;I've never gotten the impression that there has been any effort to inflate piracy figures.&lt;/em&gt; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It's not the number of pirates that is wildly incorrect&ndash;it is assuming that every single pirated piece of property was a lost sale.

		<div class="commentbody">steve paxton said <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;What I'm saying is that if you eliminated piracy, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;then people who use pirated fonts would have <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;options open to them, other than to buy the fonts <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;they previously used for free. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->They have those options open to them now.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The market is flooded with fonts bundled with applications and has been since 1988 or so, as I recall. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->First of all, I have a very hard time believing there are people who get themselves to the point in their experience level where they simply collect professional, for-retail fonts and never actually use them commercially. But if there are such people, then somehow they need to get the message (perhaps through a collecting organization of some kind) that they should restrict their collecting to freeware that's not cloneware, until they are ready to buy.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The people (whether 'collectors', or art directors, designers, or production people) who amass commercial fonts without buying them do so because built-in OS fonts and application-bundled fonts are simply not enough. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That is, the commercial non-bundled fonts are indeed more desirable. Otherwise, the bundled fonts certainly would suffice. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(And yes, I've heard about those who believe it's a numbers game. Who took the old circa-1987 Image Club Graphics headline distortion, &quot;He with the most fonts wins!&quot; and grafted the mentality onto a rationale for mass piracy.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Somehow, then, such pirates need to get their heads wrapped around the concept that if they need fonts beyond bundled fonts, and beyond non-clone freeware, that payment is expected of them. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think this group is very comfortable with the idea of fonts requiring large amounts of research and development time. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Typically, companies that make comercial fonts expect that that R&amp;D expense will be paid for over time by the market.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;(Notice, for example, in the Americas,  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;how European's stole everything in sight  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;first, made stealing illegal second,  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;built a society based on the right to  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;defend your property from theives third). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->'European's' certainly are possessive, it appears. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think that colonial history doesn't apply to this discussion. It's intriguing, of course. And we're all very lucky we don't live in such barbaric times. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But I think that not strictly focusing on the idea that modern day commercial for-retail fonts are commercial software (since 1984, or since the advent of EULAs, perhaps) that has always been meant to be metered and purchased, tends to cloud the issue. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And people are already too confused about this, in many corners. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Joe <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">The main problem with font piracy is how easy it is to do. In the past, it required hard work to pirate a font. Since fonts went digital, it takes little more than a decision to do it. Until a solution to this basic problem is found, producers of fonts are entirely at the mercy of people's willingness to take the end user licensing agreement seriously. I have no doubt that most font piracy is due to shear laziness, ignorance, and apathy, not people who have a philosophical problem with the concept of property.</div>
