body: At work I was just recently upgraded to Illustrator CS4. In the OpenType panel
  I've noticed that both ligatures and contextual alternates appear as though they
  are on by default. When I type, however, it's another story. The ligatures come
  in fine, but alternates do not. If I select a section of text that I know has calt
  features, the OT panel still shows it as activated. I then deactivate it and click
  once more and they reactivate and the alternates come in. Is this a known bug with
  CS4 or is my version perhaps need reinstalling?
