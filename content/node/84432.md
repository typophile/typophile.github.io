  body: "the word kyoiku (or Chi in chinese)\r\nBasically it is kanji (chinese alphabet)
    for Red. Dark Red to be exact (for example #660000). \r\n\r\n--If you are bored
    read on, if not just skip this part. just some some personal rambling you most
    likely won't be interest in---\r\n\r\nJapanese often associate the word(kyoiku)
    with red, fire, and important . As for Chinese - The origin of the word were from
    early religious ritual (human burning at the stake for punishment or sacrifice)
    if you look at the word right now it still depict someone tied up at a stake with
    fire/firewood under. \r\n\r\nAs for it's chinese meanings - since Chinese is an
    language with very loose verbal rule, you have look at the context. By it self
    it means dark red or blood. If you are using it as an adjective to describe a
    person it means the 'honest, real, loyal'.  It could also mean 'bare, nothing'
    (during 1300s it was started used to describe someone was red 'empty' fisted).
    \r\n\r\nNote: During Han dynasty (Cesar time) the word also use to depict south.
    But you will rarely see it use post Han dynasty (not that I read a lot of han
    dynasty books)."

    derived from the red but over 95% people imagine red color itself."
