body: Hello, <BR> <BR>Does anyone know who owns the license to the font used for the
  title of Harry Potter books? It can be found on the web in knock-off versions, but
  I&#39;m looking for a properly licensed font that we can purchase. I&#39;ve already
  purchased Able from T-26, which is used for the subtitles.  <BR> <BR>See attachment!
  <BR> <BR>Thanks for your help! <BR> <BR>Kristin <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/66858.jpg"
  alt="Harry Potter title">
