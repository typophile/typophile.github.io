  body: "This is reminiscent of Piotr Wozniak's \u201Cbloor\u201D, from 066.font.
    It is likely to be custom, however, a bold sans with the screen effect applied,
    rather than a font just judging by the fade-out through the word \u2018normal\u2019.
    You could achieve a similar effect in Photoshop, for example, by setting the type,
    applying a gaussian blur, converting to greyscale and using the colour halftone
    filter. Apply blur again (to a much smaller degree) to match the above example
    more closely."

  body: "Agree with osamu. Close to [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/066font/bloor|Bloor]].
    Should be a halftone effect applied on [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/neue-helvetica|Helvetica
    Neue]].\r\nAdding also [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bomparte/glow-gothic|Glow
    Gothic BF]] as alternative.\r\n"
