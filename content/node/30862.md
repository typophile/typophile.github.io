    the first object set to back, keep the 3 were it is, and make the last object
    set to front. (Object>Arrangement>Front to Back/Back to Front) Then Set the blend
    mode.\r\n\r\n"

    body: "I don't know if it explains it, the arrangement is the same in both cases.\r\nThe
      bug occurs when I open the file, I see it and then if I mark one of the objects
      it \"goes away\", i. e. it \"updates\" to correct blend."

  body: "Well, sometimes Illustrator renders a different crazy blend (shown in second
    pic) out of nowhere, when it really should be -- and most times it is -- as shown
    in the first pic. There is no combination of arragements of objects done in usual
    way which can produce the same \"fattening\" effect that occasionally occurs and
    which I want to take advantage of\r\n\r\nThis in other words is (normally) impossible
    in Illustrator:\r\nhttp://www.imgdumb.com/images/776599bug1.jpg"

  body: "It took me a few looks but I finally noticed your \"bug\" the odd shape of
    the first blend between the first object and the 3, correct? \r\n\r\nI would say,
    to a degree this \"bug\" can be reproduced. Notice the path that the blend is
    set to, though it's a non-stroked path, it still acts like any other path in illustrator.
    Meaning you can adjust the end points and the actual path, maybe by adding curves
    (which would change the angle of the blend in an abnormal way.) You might even
    try adding other path based filters (such as the zig-zag) and vary the blend mode
    (smooth blend to specific steps). \r\n\r\n"

    the blend function\r\nI'm not going to tell how until I have finished exploring
    it in my work, but something tells me Im not the first one to discover the technique
    =) ?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.imgdumb.com/images/716182drgs1.jpg\r\nhttp://www.imgdumb.com/images/166963drgs2.jpg"

  body: "> <em>Well, sometimes Illustrator renders a different crazy blend (shown

    Strange transitions may happen when the paths are not compatible: different number
    of nodes, different starting points, or different path directions.\r\nIn Illustrator,
    path direction is controlled in the \"Attributes\" palette.\r\n"

    blend apears right after I have opened the file, and switches to correct blend
    when I \"touch\" , f eks. mark some of the objects\r\nSo , i don't think it has
    anything to do with path direction or whatever"
