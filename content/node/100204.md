  / feeling a bit too familiar.\r\nI remembered and went back to an old logodesignlove.com
  article called [[http://www.logodesignlove.com/similar-original-logos|When logos
  look alike]]\r\nAnd indeed, my sketch looks a lot like the classic Stadt Bruhl logo
  by Stankowski. Basically it's the same  just flipped / mirrored and not all rounded.\r\n\r\nAfter
  lunch I went for a walk and within two minutes I saw a bus driving by with a huge
  logo similar to Stankowski's.\r\n\r\nHow important is originality really?\r\nAnd...
  is similarity even avoidable? I don't think it is, but when becomes similar too
  similar?"

    with will have similarities to existing logos. \r\n\r\nSo while originality is
    good, I think appropriateness for the client is more important. But obviously
    you don't want to simply copy someone else. Come up with your own design solution,
    and then search for logos (Google is handy) that might be similar \u2014 especially
    logos used by your client's competitors \u2014 to make sure you're not accidentally
    coming too close to an existing logo."
