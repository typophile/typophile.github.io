  body: "Hi Jens -\r\n\r\nIt's certainly some kind of slight variation on Century
    Schoolbook. I think that due to the fact that the printing surface is presenting
    with some bleeding, the letterforms are distorted somewhat. The closest I can
    find to your sample (going primarily by the serifs on the W) is Monotype's version.\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/century-schoolbook/\r\n\r\nIf
    this isn't to your liking, type \"Century Schoolbook\" into the search engine
    at MyFonts; there's a lot of versions available, with subtle differences.\r\n\r\n-NJ"

    logotypes" for Linotype Century Expanded.

  body: "Florian is right, I'm just interested in what font this is. I don't have
    any old specimen books to consult ...\r\n\r\nThe sample is from a custom-printed
    birth announcement card from 1970. I don't know if hand-composing was common for
    this kind of printig job then ...\r\n\r\nThe g is notably different from all the
    Century variations."
