body: "Fontsmith has created a new thought-provoking typeface \u2013 FS Conrad, for
  British artist Conrad Shawcross and his forthcoming installation work Chord which
  is due to open this month at the Kingsway Tram Subway in Holborn, London. \r\n\r\nHis
  latest work Chord has seen him build two identical rope machines that move away
  from each other whilst weaving a thick rope from spools of coloured string. \r\n\r\nChord
  is considered to be a strong structural metaphor that is concerned with the human
  perception of time and it promises to be a highly talked about event within the
  London art scene.\r\n\r\nIn response to Conrad's artwork, Fontsmith type designer
  Phil Garnham has created FS Conrad, an intricate display typeface composed of fine
  parallel lines that overlap to create a multilayered texture within words. These
  fine lines combine to meet at a central point in each letter, creating a striking
  design with a level of detail that is not often seen in the headline typefaces of
  today.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontsmith.com/about/news/fs-conrad.cfm[img:sites/default/files/old-images/News_Conrad_5121.jpg]"

    multiple line versions and a solid version? If not, they should, because one could
    get some really sweet chromatic effects that way :)"

  body: "The FS Conrad font family has two weights, Headline and Regular. The Headline
    weight of 7 lines was created for large display sizes only. The Regular weight
    of 5 lines was created to be more robust at smaller sizes.\r\n\r\nThe font messes
    with your eyes but is really effective. \r\nj"
