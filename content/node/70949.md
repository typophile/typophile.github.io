  body: "14 is the leading. 7.5 point text on 14 points of leading.\r\n\r\nA 0.3 point
    dashed rule is a little thicker than a hairline (which is 1/4 pt), but yeah, they're
    not saying what the dash pattern should be.\r\n"

  body: InDesign has some pre-defined stroke types; among those are "Dashed 3 and
    2", "Dashed 4 and 4" and plain old "Dashed". My guess is that the last one is
    the one!
