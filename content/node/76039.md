  least for some of its functions, I think a unicase sans-serif font would look good.
  I used some font creation software to create a unicase version of Myriad Pro, but
  it's nothing polished\u2014I'm only an amateur at typography. It represents the
  basic look of the unicase font I'd like to see, but do you know of any already-created
  fonts that might bear some resemblance to it? I included in the title of my post
  the phrase, \"the new standard\", because I feel as if some of the existing unicase
  fonts aren't quite up to par with the \"classics\" of Helvetica, Myriad, Frutiger,
  etc.\r\n\r\nOh, and by the way, I've already visited [[http://typophile.com/node/15035|this
  page]] about unicase fonts on Typophile. It was helpful, but didn't really cause
  me to come to a decision about any particular font.\r\n\r\nWorking title\u2014Myriad

  body: "Here's a commission I did a couple of years ago.\r\nMy client was a design
    firm which had pitched the idea of a unicase to their client by mocking up comps
    using Avenir.\r\nIt ended up with more personality, as it's being used for advertising
    heads.\r\nNote that it departs slightly from the alphabet 26 scheme, and that
    the numerals are drawn quite wide.\r\nNot commercially available.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dc_5710.png]"

  body: "Great suggestion, nina. I really like ITC Franklin, and I'd forgotten that
    it now has unicase alternates. Thing is, I don't much like the \"r\" or the \"t\"
    (in the unicase)\u2014they seem not to be geometric enough. Then again, that's
    just a personal preference. I like the rest, though.\r\n\r\nNick, I really like
    your Avenir spinoff\u2014I'd say it comes the closest to what I'm looking for
    out of any unicase font I've seen (except perhaps my own, but yours has things
    like pair kerning and correct metrics and such, I'm sure). The dotted \"i\" is
    a distinctive touch. I actually appreciate the numerals drawn wide\u2014they look
    like they belong with the rest of the font, rather than as afterthoughts.\r\n\r\nI
    look forward to more replies in this thread (and appreciate the existing ones),
    but something tells me I'm going to have to commission a new font. I have too
    specific an idea of what I'm looking for. Essentially it would have these qualities:\r\n\r\n\u2014Unicase\r\n\u2014The
    width-to-height ratio of the \"x\" (and by extension, that of most other letters)
    would be 1:1, or square\r\n\u2014No variation in stroke width\u2014for instance,
    an \"o\" would appear as two equally proportioned, intersecting shapes (as in
    Helvetica Neue Ultra Light)\r\n\u2014A blend of geometric and humanistic\u2014minimal
    differentiation between letters, but some freedoms (e.g., the slanting on Myriad's
    \"M\", and its careful tuning of the rounded part of the \"P\")\r\n\u2014Minimal
    differentiation between letter width\u2014most letters should appear roughly x-width;
    of course, \"i\" and \"j\" are notable exceptions\r\n\u2014Likely, numerals would
    be roughly x-width or slightly thinner, as in the example given above by Nick
    Shinn\r\n\u2014Possibility of a one-story \"a\", but not certain\r\n\u2014The
    tail on the \"Q\" would be straight, directed roughly 30 degrees below baseline\r\n\r\nEven
    as I make this list, it sounds as if I'm heading in the direction of font commissioning.
    How expensive is it to commission one? Or is the price, by nature of it being
    commission-based, highly variable?"

  body: I would edit my above post, but I can't; apparently there's a time window.
    Anyway, I stumbled upon [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_styles.php?productLineID=100025|H&FJ's
    Topaz Inline]] (not Topaz Background). I love everything about it, besides the
    fact that it has no lower case (which is a rather significant detail). It's as
    if every other font seems irrelevant after taking in its beautiful proportions.
    I wish H&FJ would fill in the rest of the font's potential features.

  body: "Wow. Thanks, Stephen\u2014Newut comes really close to what I'm looking for.
    Now if Newut's unicase properties and squarish proportions could be blended with
    the elegance of Helvetica Neue (especially Ultra Light) and the flexibility of,
    say, Hoefler & Frere-Jones' Gotham (tabular figures, language support, and more
    varied widths and weights), that would be the perfect font."

  body: "I see your point, Thomas. I've given up the mostly-mono-width ideal. Perhaps
    I was simply looking for a more open font\u2014for instance, the height and width
    of the \"O\" being roughly equal rather than somewhat condensed. Good suggestion
    on Hypatia Sans, by the way. I like its flexibility\u2014the fact that it includes
    all the features you've mentioned is indeed a very big draw. I also like that
    it is, as you say, relatively monoline. Oddly enough, its capitals are strikingly
    similar to Topaz Inline, which, I've decided, is probably the look I'm going for
    (in terms of caps, because it sadly doesn't offer lowercase). I just find Topaz
    Inline so elegant and well-proportioned. To me, its perfect geometry, and yet
    its yielding departure from overregularity, make for a unique and unsurpassable
    combination. Now if only H&FJ would offer the flexibility of Hypatia or even Gotham
    (adding lowercase glyphs would be a start)...\r\n\r\n<strong>\u2014\u2014Topaz
