  fonts from Parahcute's DIN series. I am unfamiliar with the foundry and would like
  to set my C.V. for a design professorship using DIN Display, mainly, but my jump
  over to their DIN Text if it doesn't work out at lower sizes. Before I lay down
  the Euros, I'd love to know how well these fonts behave. Are they well-spaced and
  well-kerned?"
