    Select the scale tool, then while holding the shift key (this engages angular
    constraint), click and drag your pointer from your scale origin point until the
    points have scaled your desired amount.</li>\r\n<li>Select the points you want
    to scale. Double-click on the scale tool. this will open the transformation dialog
    window, with the \"Scale\" option selected. From that same pull down menu, select
    the next item \"Scale Uniformly\". Enter the percentage by which you want to scale,
    and select your preferred transformation origin from the pull down menu at the
    top of the dialog window. Click \"OK\" </li>\r\n</ul>"

  body: It would be nice to be able to scale numerically by em units rather than percentages.  The
    first option works as described <em>for me,</em> but it is difficult to control,
    and I generally use percentage scaling instead.
