  grid. Just a couple of the poems have sub-sections with titles. I don\u2019t seem
  to be able to select a spacing after those subtitles that looks right to me and
  still keeps everything on the basic grid\u2014though I can keep it to a twice-dense
  grid so that the lines \u201Ccome back\u201D a little later.\r\n\r\nWhat do you
  think looks better: losing the baseline alignment for a part of a page, or having
  unnecessarily large spacing after a subtitle?\r\n\r\n(I\u2019m talking about Garamond
  10.5/13pt text with a 6.5 pt space after the subheadings, which are Garamond Bold
  10.5/13.)\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n-Courtney\r\n"

  body: "The \"twice-dense grid\" will grant you the best control.\r\nOr you could
    leave no space after the subheadings, since they're already bold.\r\n(If they
    span multiple lines, in InDesign you could apply the \"Align only the first line
    to the baseline grid\" option)"

  body: Yes, I did try it with no space, but it looked confusing since there are breaks
    of 13 points between stanzas of the poem, and not having a space between the subhead
    and first stanza of the section made the title seem to refer only to that first
    stanza, not the whole section. BTW I also have breaks of 26 pts after the poem
    title (Garamond Bold 13/13pt) and before each new section subhead.

  body: Florian, I should have asked you -- did you come up with 8 pts for the shift
    based on any special calculation, or did you just eyeball it?

  body: That was just a random value, to demonstrate the principle. I would have a
    look at a printout, in order to determine the exact value. Eye over math.
