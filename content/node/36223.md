body: "How do people deal with letters with no upper-case form, or where the upper-case
  is comprised of multiple glyphs?  Two cases I\u2019ve seen on this board are the
  Greenlandic Kra (\u0138 maps to K\u2018) and German Esszet (\xDF usually maps to
  SS, but a true capital \xDF has been proposed; see the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_\xDF|Wikipedia
  entry]] and the 2004 [[http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n2888.pdf|Unicode proposal]]
  and its 2007 [[http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/N3227.pdf|resubmission]]).\r\n\r\nWhere
  should software handle these distinctions?  Are the [[small capitals]] graphical
  variations on the minuscule or majuscule letters, and so where should the capitalization
  happen, in the typesetting program or in the font?"

  body: "Many Linotype OpenType fonts that include small caps include small cap glyphs
    for \xDF fi fl and ij. In the case of \xDF, the glyph is two small cap s forms
    (SS). Same for the ligatures (FI FL IJ).\r\n\r\nI have heard that, even if a cap
    \xDF comes into use, recommended capitalization will still be SS. For one thing,
    you don't want pre-existing documents to reflow! Old documents will have to be
    edited to have the SS replaced with the capital \xDF; new documents will have
    to physically enter the capital \xDF in somehow, i.e., selecting a text with an
    \xDF in it and capitalizing that text completely will probably swap that \xDF
    with SS. Don't know how the user will actually type in the capital \xDF yet. There
    is always the glyph palette\u2026"

  body: For small caps you don't need capitalization. In OpenType fonts you have two
    different features to turn lowercase letters into small caps [smcp] and to turn
    uppercase letters into small caps [c2sc]. You may also have two different sets
    of small cap glyphs in a OpenType font, one to represent the lowercase as small
    caps, another for the uppercase.

  body: "The trouble (as I saw it) with small-caps de-ligaturization where the capital
    or small-caps form is not a ligature (as in \xDF \u2194 SS, \uFB01 \u2194 FI,
    &c.), is that the letter spacing becomes hard to adjust.  I wasn't aware of the
    [c2sc] feature in OpenType, though; the standard Unicode capitalization routines
    followed by [c2sc] are what I was hoping existed.  Thanks. "
