    Slab</a>. I think <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/pampatype/rayuela/">Rayuela</a>
    is more of a hybrid slab, but the chocolate weight gets me. I've used <a href="http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Giza">Giza</a>
    and <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/emigre/cholla_slab/">Cholla</a>
    several times. And I've had my eyes on <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=ff+zine&x=0&y=0">FF

    is fine, but the italic is charming and lively, particularly at large sizes. Well,
    I guess all slabs work better at large sizes.\r\n\r\nIf you include it as a slab,
    Chapparal is terrific and CAN work at small sizes because of optical sizes. Pricey,
    though."

    be a few years before I want to go that route! For a more modern feel I quite
    like Enclave.\r\n\r\nDon't have it but as I saw it just recently am currently

    seeing a lot of lately (partner\u2019s newspaper) and I don\u2019t like the light,
    but the italics I loathe. Overall I really don\u2019t like the way they use it.\r\n\r\nPersonally
