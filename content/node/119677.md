  finding it a bit complicated to classify fonts the right way. What I know is that
  what makes a transitional font is the vertical stress, the stronger contrasts between
  thin and thick lines, and that what makes an old style is the calligraphic reference.
  That said I can state quite easily that Garamond is an old style font and Times
  New Roman is a transitional, but how can I recognize the differences between a Caslon
  (old style) and a Baskerville (transitional)? These two look pretty similar to me.\r\nThanks."

  body: "\xB6 Caslon is the last of the Old Style. Caslon's Roman was influenced by
    the Dutch Old Style of the XVII th century: see the the bi-directional serifs
    of the capital \"T\". Caslon is a Baroque and late Old Style.\r\n\r\n\xB6 Baskerville
    was a neoclassical transitional of the mid-XVIII th century which was considered
    as a difficult to read typeface back then because it was too strict, contrasted
    and geometrical. Baskerville's trademark lies in the opened loop of the lowercase
    \"g\". Take a look at the capital \"C\" which look like a horseshoe because the
    two serifs are outside. The tail of the capital \"Q\" is typical of the neoclassical
    typefaces. The serifs of the capital \"T\" are vertical.\r\n\r\n\xB6 Find a comparison:\r\n<em>Adobe
