  inkstamp which was on the front page of a key surviving Holocaust document.\r\n\r\nThe
  ink stamp is taken from the front page of the notorious \"Jager report,\"  a document
  listing Jewish persons and others executed in 1941 in Lithiuania. It was compiled
  by SS-Standartenfuhrer Karl Jager who was the head of  Einsatzkommando 3  attached
  to  murder squad, Einsatzgruppen A for submission to Heydrich in Berlin.\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jager_Report\r\n\r\nhttp://www.nizkor.org/hweb/orgs/german/einsatzgruppen/esg/jager.html\r\n\r\nBoth
  make for gruesome reading.\r\n\r\nBut is this a custom type face made for the stamp?
  \ I have been told that it is a Celtic uncial font.  Or more specifically, \"Cry
  Uncial\", which I doubt highly. \r\n\r\nCan anyone here think if they know of any
  other examples like this one dating to the 1920's or 1930's or early 40's that matches
  this style?  Or was the type-face really just custom made for the stamp? \r\n\r\nGeheime
  Reichssache, translates as \"secret Reich business\"  \r\n\r\nThank you for any
  light you can shed upon this curious type-face.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nType-face nut.

  body: "Curious indeed. I checked through Jaspert's Enclopedia of Typefaces, which
    is generally very good in coverage of German typefaces of from the 1920s to WW
    II,  but drew a blank.\r\nFor what it is worth, the letters are simplified Roman
    italic, not script, and have nothing to do with Unical letters. So I suspect it's
    hand lettering made into a stamp. Might be in an alphabet book for draftsmen,
    showcard makers etc. \r\nDon"

  body: "You're welcome Chris.\r\nGood finds Ryuk.\r\nSo we can probably say that
    the designer of the stamp drew on a popular lettering style in Germany in the
    late 1890s. This same style was more or less imitated in the Bauer/Berthold typeface
    that HiH used as the basis for Regina Cursiv. Similarly for Joey Maul's Spring
    # 7.\r\nTo reproduce the stamp I would use Spring #7 and modify to match.\r\nNow
    that the discussion has prompted my memory, I do recall seeing this type of lettering
    on some of the old postcards in my [unsorted] digital collection of old images.
    Might even be able to find a few.\r\nDon"
