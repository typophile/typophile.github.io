  problem is about the kerning when it comes to logotypes. Is there a rule that says
  that in a logotype, all letters should be spaced equally? As you can see in the
  jpg without the guides,the first type from the top looks better in my opinion, but
  it\u2019s not\r\nspaced equally! \r\n\r\nI really apreciate some help! Thank you!"

    letters should be spaced equally?</em>\r\n\r\nI don't think so. But if someone
    told you this, perhaps they were refering to optical compensation -- the letters
    should <em>appear</em> to be balanced or spaced equally. \r\n\r\nYour third and
    fourth examples don't work because there is equal distance. But in your first
    example, I think you have too much space after the second <strong>L</strong>...
    And you may have too little space on either side of the <strong>U</strong> (but
    too much in the second example). Here's a suggestion: print out your logo, hang
    it on a wall, and stand back some distance to look at it. Then, squint your eyes
    a bit. This will help you to see where you need to adjust the kerning."

  body: Thank you for your quick and helpful reply! I understood perfectly what you
    meant and I made a mistake by telling that the first one looks better.. it was
    the second one, that I thought is resonable.Anyway, would you be so kind to point
    me to some famous examples please, regarding optical compensation! Thank you!
