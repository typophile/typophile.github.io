  its conception in 2000, DDD has immatured into a jocuserious fanzine-journal-orphanage
  based on true stories deeply concerned with art-design-music-language-literature-architecture
  and uptight optipessimistic stoppy/revelatory ghostwriting by friendly spirits mapping
  b-sides and out-takes pushing for a resolution in bleak midwinter through late summer
  with local and general aesthetics wound on an ever tightening coil.\r\n\r\n<strong>Website:</strong>
