  OpenType fonts. Is there any free tool to sign fonts?\r\n"

  body: "The <em>tool</em> for signing fonts is free (provided by Microsoft; see http://www.microsoft.com/typography/developers/dsig/default.aspx
    for more information). But I don't know of any free Certificates, and that is
    the critical bit required for applying a digital signature to fonts.\r\n\r\nDo
    a search for Authenticode Class III Code Signing Certificate; that is the specific
    variety required for signing fonts (this type of Certificate is not limited to
    use on fonts, but other types will not work). There are several vendors (known
    as Certificate Authorities), including Thawte and Verisign.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure
    what you consider \"reasonable\"; my experience with this tells me to be prepared
    to spend around $100/year or so, maybe more, maybe less depending upon the specific
    vendor. Generally Certificate Authorities will offer discounts for multi-year
    purchases so if you're in it for the long haul it may be worth doing that. Again,
    be sure you are getting a Class III Code Signing Certificate and not an SSL Cert
    or some other type.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is possible to create a self-signed Certificate
    for free; the tool set provided by Microsoft allows you to do this and there are
    instructions in the DSIG toolkit for doing this. A self-signed certificate behaves
    more or less the same as a regular Certificate, but since it is not issued by
    a Certificate Authority, it will not be considered \"trusted\", even if it is
    valid. But it is a good way to learn about the process of signing fonts, do dry
    runs, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nJosh\r\n"

  body: "Hey Josh,\r\n\r\nAs I understand, the certificate must be purchased for a
    year or more.\r\nI got an offer from Thawte as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nWe do
    offer a Microsoft Authenticode Code Signing Certificate.\r\n \r\nThe Microsoft
    Authenticode Code Signing Certificate has a 1 and 2 year validity period.\r\n
    \r\nPlease find the pricing below:\r\n1 year: US$299\r\n2 year: US$549\r\n \r\nPlease
    use the link below to enroll for the Microsoft Authenticode Code Signing Certificate:\r\nhttp://www.thawte.com/ssl-digital-certificates/code-signing/index.html\r\n\r\n\r\nCan
    you think of a cheaper Certificate provider?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nDH"

  body: "I am pretty sure it is not required yet, but I remember long ago that the
    idea was tossed around of eventually requiring a DSIG. As far as I know, the only
    difference today (even under Vista) between signed fonts versus unsigned is the
    font file icon (and extra information in Properties). But it's not hard to imagine
    it becoming more restrictive and invasive, much in the way applications have become.\r\n\r\nAndreas,
    thanks for the link...looks like TUCOWS (reselling Comodo) is pretty much the
    cheapest way to go.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
