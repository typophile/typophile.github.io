  body: "It depends on <em>where</em> as much as when. And the context in which you're
    using these ornaments should inform the selection.\r\n\r\nBut you could start
    by looking at transitional faces by Calson, Fleischman, and Baskerville. Many
    digital cuts will have accompanying ornaments."

  body: 'Late 1700s AMerican. From what I know Caslon was one of the only typeface
    used here at that time. Most of the sets of Caslon do not have ornaments except
    for Adobe Caslon Pro. I don''t know how to find out if they are in fact ornaments
    dating back to when Caslon was originally cut. '

  body: ITC Founders Caslon has ornaments. I assume that they're historically accurate.
