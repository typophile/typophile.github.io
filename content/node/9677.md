  body: I think what shaolin is referring to is by Matthew Bardram of Atomic Media.  <BR>You
    can find his tip at <A HREF="http://www.ultrashock.com/" TARGET="_top">http://www.ultrashock.com/</A>.
    Skip the goofy intro <BR>and go to &#34;Tutorials&#34;, then &#34;Flash 5&#34;.
    It&#39;s in the article listing.

  body: I&#39;ve learned, from reading and listening, that one thing that truly makes
    a font work for the screen is the &#39;hinting&#39; of the font. I believe that
    Microsoft &#40;link below&#41; has a section on this. And, if this doesn&#39;t
    help as much, a friend of mine who designed trebuchet and others, could be of
    more help. Let me know. <BR> <BR><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/default.asp"

  body: ' There are two ways to get high-quality screen rendering. The main one these
    days is hinting, but you can also embed actual bitmaps into TT fonts. &#40;On
    MacOS you can also have a bitmap suitcase.&#41; <BR> <BR>Although most of the
    industry has taken hinting to heart, I&#39;m still not convinced that it&#39;s
    &#42;always&#42; the way to go. I&#39;ve been learning VTT, and the one adjective
    I would use to describe the process of delta-hinting &#40;which is what you really
    need to match embedded bitmaps in quality&#41; is &#34;unnatural&#34;. <BR> <BR>Also,
    if you want the ultimate in on-screen rendering you would go with grayscale bitmaps
    &#40;handmade ones, not those awful ones generated automatically&#41;, and at
    that point hinting becomes &#42;really&#42; painful. <BR> <BR>hhp '
