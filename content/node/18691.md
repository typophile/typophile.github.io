  latest stuff. His work is all created with cast shadows. The script is particularly
  beautiful.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Could_suggest2.jpg]\r\n\r\nhttp://users.pandora.be/eerdekens/main.htm\r\n\r\nBreathe
  deeply, dim the lights and click on the \"Shadow Play\" exhibit.\r\n\r\nThanks Brendan
  for the linkage."
