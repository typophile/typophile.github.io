  body: "Was about to say exactly the same as Atwe but some glyphs remain off, mainly
    punctuation (or didn't find the right version): @, %...\r\nAnd weight Condensed
    Bold doesn't seem to match either, looks like it could be intermediate between
    Condensed Bold and Ultra Condensed Bold..."

  body: Maybe it's [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/univers-lt/|Linotype Univers]],
