  body: "Having the space as a character is a relatively new phenomenon. To me, the
    space character should be established so that ragged composition (i.e., no justification)
    looks right. The space may well need to be different for roman and italic, depending
    on the letterforms themselves, and their sidebearings.\r\n\r\nAs a for-instance,
    I just made an OpenType version of Bembo from a Type 1 PostScript font. Among
    the many changes, I changed the space in the roman font from 258 units (1,000
    unit em) to 220 units, and the italic from 250 to 200. The reason it wasn't done
    earlier was simply that our old composition system did not take the space from
    the font. A bold font would likely need more space, at least, when used at the
    same size as the text, in text setting.\r\n\r\nFurther, the wordspace (however
    derived) usually needs to be relatively smaller as you increase the size of the
    type. Obviously, you can't make this provision as a type designer, but must rely
    on the compositor who uses your type."

  body: "Word spacing varies with font, even within families. There are no absolute
    rules in the digital era. You may start with something around 250 units but the
    idea is to create a spce wich will make the word break clear enough without making
    the line fall apart. Word spacing tends to agree with letterspacing mostly. If
    the letterspacing is tight, the the word spacing is proportionally tight as well.
    Like much else about type design, the eye is the master tool.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "<cite>Historically. The space character is one third of the Em or one half
    of the En.</cite>\r\n\r\nAs long as your history covers about 1880 to about 1940.\r\n\r\nWhen
    you hand-set type (1450+ to whenever), you start with the smallest space you are
    willing to use. To justify the line, you add space. Life is tough enough without
    starting with a larger space & having to take it out.\r\n\r\nThe machines came
    in right about the time when wide wordspacing was in fashion, which is where you
    get the \"thick\" (3-to-em). And by-the-way, Linotype linecasters weren't on an
    em system, you had a choice of \"spacebands\" you could use. The \"thin spaceband\"
    went from about 2 points unexpanded, to about 5-6 points fully expanded. A good
    Linotype compositor could tell how much a space would be added to a line, & would
    hyphenate a word so the spaceband wedge wasn't fully used.\r\n\r\nAs to your rivers:
    Maybe. If you are using words all the same length - 3- 4- 5- letters long, you're
    going to get more rivers. If you are using a text that could occur naturally,
    you'll get a better feel for how the space is working.\r\n\r\nOne more thing about
    \"history.\" In the 19th century, many fonts tended to have a wider set than the
    current fashion, so perforce the space needed to be bigger. You will also get
    a different feel to the space depending on your leading and margins. One thing
    far too few book designers seem to realize is that there is a relationship between
    word space, leading, and margins (which of course, implies measure, given standard
    paper sheets).\r\n\r\nObviously, the type designer cannot provide a correct space
    for all settings. But if it is a text font, you could not ignore text, that is,
    8- to 12-point settings.\r\n\r\nLife gets much more difficult for a display font,
    because things that will affect the wordspace include size, but even the number
    of words in the line. For example, if you are setting subheads in small caps,
    the amount you letterspace will be a factor of how many words are in the head.
    Try it. Set \"the next one\" in small caps & get it right. Now try that letterspacing
    & wordspacing for \"machinery gone amuck in the twentieth-century industrial plant\"
    I guarantee you, those values will no longer look right."

  body: "Nick, I don't agree. I don't feel you set up a font to it's disadvantage
    only to cover one possibility. As for tabular setting, you can always use the
    italic or bold commands around the numbers only, without the spaces. That would
    preserve the spacing (usually roman) throughout the table. While I can't think
    of situations where this wouldn't work, you can always just use another tab stop
    in the table if push comes to shove.\r\n\r\nThe other side of the coin is that
    you often have italic text run in with the roman. Why have unfortunate spacing
    here? And you can't change, say, the spacing for just the italic in an application
    program such as InDesign, since that spacing (min-ideal-\"max\") works on the
    entire paragraph, right?"
