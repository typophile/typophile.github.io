  body: The Barnes & Noble at New York City's Union Square (north side) has a large
    selection of graphic design books on the fourth floor. I can't say for sure whether
    they have it right now, but they probably do.

    was more than one in stock, too. They were even wrapped in cellophane.\r\n\r\nMmm.
    What a good book."

    send it (in the US).

    a copy there last Friday and they'd just taken delivery of a new batch.

    Amazon itself. They're often small operations without a good inventory database
    system, and they may not always know exactly what they have.\r\n\r\nIn New York
    City, there are Barnes and Noble stores all over the place. If you go to their
    website ([[http://www.barnesandnoble.com]]) and search for the book, there will
    be a link on the right to \"Find It\" in their stores. Go to the link and type
    in a postal code (try something like 10036 for midtown Manhattan) and it will
    list stores, ranked by distance, and whether they have it in stock."
