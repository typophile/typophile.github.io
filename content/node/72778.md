body: "I\u2019m designing a logo for a friends church and want to use the rather lovely
  stone work above the entrance as inspiration. Does anyone have an idea of a good
  starting point to creat something similar. Obviously it doesn\u2019t need to be
  in relief but something of the same weight and style (possibly without flourishes)
  would be a great help.\r\n\r\nI could draw the letters from the original but to
  be honest the budget is pretty small so don\u2019t really have the time.\r\n\r\nAny
  help greatly appreciated."

    Quorum Bold has a similar feel, and you could make it closer by tweaking a few
    characters."

    these. It\u2019s kinda hard to tell from your image, but I guess that A (like
    in Algerian) is a keeper if you want it to look similar."

    need to spend more time on. Just a mock up for now to show the client the concept
    :D\r\n\r\nLove your work oldnick, think the Gill influence makes it a bit tricky
    for this purpose though, not quite uniform enough."

  body: "the mock up you have is a good concept. The only problem I can see is that
    the E gets a little bit lost at the end. Maybe try putting the terminals on an
    angle and leaving a small notch in the corners similar to the top left of the
    first S.\r\n\r\nOf course, doing that might mean you have to angle the terminals
    of S T and G as well."
