    was already discussed at http://www.typophile.com/node/118471 but we did not find
    a match.\r\nWhere did you find the lettering?\r\nIt would help if we knew whether
    it was a label for a package of Colombian sugar, a logo, a music group, or ...
    ?\r\nAlso, do you have any more letters?\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: This is from a Panama(nian?) - in south america - coffee cup. Based on the
    similarities in the S's I believe they  are two complimentary type faces from
    the same family but I could be wrong of course. This is all that I've got and
    its just fragments but thankfully they're vector so at least they are clear.

  body: "Today's Tivia: Panama was part of Columbia until 1903 when the US encouraged
    it to secede to facilitate construction of the Panama Canal by the U.S. Army Corps
    of Engineers between 1904 and 1914. So my idea of a label for a package of Colombian
    sugar is not far from a cup of Panamanian coffee. :)\r\nDo you know the name of
    the Panamanian  company? Perhaps they have a website with some info.\r\nDon"
