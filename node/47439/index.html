  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I have a coworker who maintains that the best practice for shrinking an image in PS is to decrease the image size in 10% (or smaller) increments until the desired width is achieved. The reasoning is that by making smaller jumps each time, PS has less opportunity for error.</p>
<p>Having tried this, specifically with rasterized PDFs with lots of small text, I&rsquo;ve come to the position that you can achieve better results by simply jumping straight to the desired size of the image. The reasoning is that fewer resamplings = fewer errors, and also that the 10% method seems too time consuming and too easily, invisibly automated for it to still be necessary in CS3.</p>
<p>What is the best practice? Is this something to do with older versions of PS/CS?</p>

<p>I just tried it with an image going down to about 50% of the original size, and then taking a copy of the original and scaling it down to the exact size of the resized image. I layered the two images on top of each other and had to blow it up to 300% before I saw any difference (and the difference was just a few pixels in some highlight areas).</p>

<p>&hellip;What does that even <em>mean?</em> It&rsquo;s not a toddler crossing a brook. It&rsquo;s a computer program blending color values together.</p>
<p>If you halve the size of an image, each new pixel is made from four pixels from the original. You can do this three times and it will be exactly the same as if you reduced it directly to an eighth of the original size. However, if the ratio isn&rsquo;t whole &ndash; that is, if one pixel in the new image corresponds to about 1.1 pixels in the original image, for example &ndash; then every resampling will introduce a small amount of blur. So, yes, you want to minimize the number of times you do that.</p>

<p>Nearest Neighbor: With this interpolation Photoshop simply looks side to side and makes the decision of what the new value (pixel) should be. Very basic, fast, lousy. However, lines, graphic shapes are fine with NN.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quality&rdquo; is a term that needs to be used with care. But what I said was &ldquo;for eventual bilevel.&rdquo; Usually pictures (&ldquo;photos&rdquo;) are not bilevel. Occasionally you have an image (chart, graph) which comes in grayscale, and you do some work on it still in the grayscale mode, knowing all the while that you will go to bilevel in the end. The reason is you can do some work with curves &amp; such (though I tend to use contrast masks) while still in grayscale mode. This will affect just which pixels go black and which go white when you select a threshold. NN can also be useful when the photo is, say, a shot of an old newspaper article &amp; where you plan on a fake bilevel; you don&rsquo;t want the full gamut of tone, but you do want to bring out the print.</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;m no big fan of &ldquo;sharpness&rdquo; (USM should be banned), it does have a place.</p>

<p>If I ever compose a dictionary, this will be the citation under &ldquo;Ludicrous&rdquo;.
Single step is always best. Somewhat like measuring something with a long
measuring tape rather than using a ruler multiple times end-to-end.</p>
<p>Also, besides the obvious bicubic versus nearest-neighbor stuff, here&rsquo;s something less obvious, although still pretty obvious really: you lose less quality by going down in even multiples: 50%, 33.33%, 25%, 20%, 16.67%, etc. And if you&rsquo;re really picky: before you scale it crop your image according to the multiple you&rsquo;re shooting for. For example if you&rsquo;ll be doing a 33.33%, make sure your dimensions are multiples of 3. Not that anybody will really see any difference in the end result. But it&rsquo;s in there!</p>
