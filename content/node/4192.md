    Metro</A> &#40;Bitstream&#39;s Geometric 415&#41; to me. The scan is not clear
    enough to make out the script though. <BR> <BR>BTW It never hurts to ask nicely,

  body: I&#39;m willing to bet that the script is Mandate or <A HREF="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/freehand-521/"
    TARGET="_top">Freehand 521</A>, albeit with a modified T and perhaps lower-case
    l. I found an image that showed the script more clearly, which is below. <BR>
    <BR>Uh, over and out.
