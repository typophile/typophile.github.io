body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI trying to write a macro with RoboFab that works in the same
  way as FL copy to composites from the metrcis window, so I can quickly copy the
  metrics from glyphs like \"H\" to the Hbar. \r\n\r\nI was trying something like
  this :\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n\r\n#CopyToComposites\r\n#\r\nfrom robofab.world import
  CurrentFont\r\nf = CurrentFont()\r\n#\r\nf['Hbar'].leftMargin = f['H'].leftMargin\r\nf['Hbar'].rightMargin
  = f['H'].rightMargin\r\n#\r\nf.update()\r\n\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nThe problem with this
  is it copies the actual sidebearing, so in cases like the Hbar the sidebearing is
  measured from the bar which overhangs the stem of the 'H', but I want it to be measured
  form the stem like you can do with the measuring line in the metrics window.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

    of a glyph at any given height by intersecting the shape with a horizontal line]]
    was recently added to Robofab, which seems to be what you need.
