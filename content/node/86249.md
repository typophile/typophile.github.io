  and thought some of you would be interested:\r\n\r\n<em>This October 15-23, 2011

  and brings together Los Angeles' abundant and vital design communities. Showcasing

  of design activities happening throughout Los Angeles.</em>\r\n\r\n<em>The annual

  and institutions with a focus on design workshops, exhibitions, historic and modern
  architectural home tours, lectures and more. Design enthusiasts and design professionals

  Angeles' varied design communities throughout the week. By fostering this increased
  dialogue and engagement across professions and disciplines, Design Week / LA seeks
