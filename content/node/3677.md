body: My client says she got this font from a dry-rub &#40;Letraset?&#41; kit years
  ago. According to her the font name was Valhalla, but the only fonts I find with
  that name are scripts. Can anyone help? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/28869.jpg"

  body: That is the right name. It shows up in the Dover Solotype catalog &#40;p.
    83&#41;. The problem is that most of the type shown in the Solotype Catalog was
    not digital. It could be that it would be easier to re-create it using something
    that may approximate it, and modifying the O to look like this distinctive feature.
    Some of the fonts at <a href="http://members.aol.com/fontner/frontpage.html" target="_blank">Harold&#39;s
    Fonts</a> might get near this look, as he has picked up a lot of the so-called
    Retro typefaces. Denney One or Two, or Screwball might possibly work.
