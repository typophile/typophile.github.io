  not sure if it came from a book, or from a website, or a presentation or what..
  \ And in this text was a picture of all the shapes you need to construct the basic
  latin alphabet, upper and lower case.  Can't remember every shape that was there,
  but it wasn't more than a dozen or so.  I remember it had the bowl shape, a straight
  line shape, tittle shapes, etc... The idea was, these are the only shapes you need.
  Of course this would result in a very homogenized font with no difference in shape
  between the b, d, p, and q, for example, but nevertheless, the shapes presented
  were the lowest common denominator for constructing a complete set of latin glyphs.\r\n\r\nAnybody
  familiar with what I'm talking about?  I have no idea where I saw this now and would
  like to read through it again and become more familiar with these \"pieces\""

    G\xFCrtler, or something much older, or... A bunch of people have done that sort
    of this (including me, for Armenian, in my early days). To me the best way to
    view them (at least in terms of type) is how an automotive engineer views an accident

  body: It might have been Tobias Frere-Jones rather than Unger in FUSE that I'm thinking
    of. I don't have any copies of FUSE, just going by memory from having seen Neville
    Brody talk about it recently.

  body: "No, Unger <em>did</em> have what you described, in Fuse; he's long been interested
    in breaking down letterforms into components (which you can see in many of his
    fonts - the ones with very thin connections). Tobias's thing was more organic,
    chirographic.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: As far as I know, the least common denominator for unequivocal letter shapes
    is the eight line segments used by Nixie tubes. It was an efficient model, but
    didn't leave much room for stylistic variation.
