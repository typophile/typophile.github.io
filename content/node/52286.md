  3_66.png\r\n\r\nLooks very similar to what Adobe Caslon Pro semibold would be if
  it was an open face version, but for obvious reasons it's not what I need.\r\n\r\nThis
  is another similar font, but again not quite it.\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typefolio/adriane-lux/\r\n\r\nAnybody
  want to take a crack at it?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."
