  Curriculum: History video is Gothicus Alternate, but the 'h' is a bit different.
  Can anyone point me in the right direction?"

    by Dieter Steffmann.\r\nSteffmann's fonts were generally \"improvements\" to fonts
    he ripped from other fontmakers. In this case I can find no other source, so I
    suppose this might be one of his own. At least it's as legitimate as anything
    available for this design.\r\nIn English, Deutsche Zierschrift is German ornamental
    writing.\r\nDon\r\n"
