  body: "This sample is <strong>really</strong> degraded. I'm not sure if we can identify
    it. I'd suggest looking through Mike Y's <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/BauhausFaces1.html\"
    target=\"_blank\">Bauhaus Font ID Guide</a>, based on that 'A' and 'Y' to see
    if there's anything there you'd like.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "thank you lex...\r\nsorry that was such a bad sample, but it was all i was
    given. i had found a few similarities with what you pointed me to, and some others
    i had found on my own, but nothing as close as i need.\r\ncheers."
