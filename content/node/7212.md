body: Gerald Giampa <BR> <BR>Tried to find your last reference to The Fount in the
  search engine here. Ye gods. Password hell. Something quite wrong there. <BR> <BR>At
  any rate, while rummaging around through a file cabinet today, I discovered the
  first issue &#40;Caslon&#41; of _The Fount_. The newsprint has yellowed a bit but
  the typography is still holding up.  <BR> <BR>So, where is the infamous metal type
  insert? <BR> <BR>Are you still considering reviving this? <BR> <BR>Gerald Lange

  body: Gerald, <BR> <BR>I would like to have a copy of the fonts available in that
    issue. Any chance of a photocopy, or scan? I would really appreciate that. <BR>
    <BR>Yes, I am considering reviving it. I would like to know if you would consider
    writing an article for it? <BR> <BR>Gerald

  body: Gerald G. <BR> <BR>Tried to respond to you via email response. Ha! I think
    Typophile is just way too high tech for me, in a Brazil sort of way. <BR> <BR>You
    don&#39;t have a copy of it? Sure, I can send you a scan of the fonts, Wednesday
    at the latest. Hell, Gerald, you gave it to me, if you need it I will send the
    original to you. Will need your address though. <BR> <BR>Yeah, of course, I&#39;d
    be willing to write for it. Winter&#39;s coming, I stop production and switch
    into writing mode. My office is warm. Not so great running through the studio
    to the bathroom though. Whoa. <BR> <BR>Gerald L.
