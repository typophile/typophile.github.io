body: hi type enthusiasts... can you please help me identify this typeface? i have
  a client who would like this for her wedding invitations and, while i'm normally
  pretty good at identifying typeaces, i can't seem to crack this one and it's driving
  me batty!!!!! i've circled the barely legible 'g' because if it can be identified
  by anything, i'm sure that would be it.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wedding_4291.jpg]
