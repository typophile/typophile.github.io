  body: "Have you looked at all the available Garamonds? It seems to me several might
    be close matches, andthe inability to see the serif on the L makes it hard to
    pinpoint a version very well. Some possibilities I thought, based on the K, A
    and the S mainly, were [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/garamond-classico/|Garamond
    Classico]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/garamond-premier/|Garamond Premier]],
    and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/garamont-amsterdam/|Garamont Amsterdam]].
    I think there are others, but part of the problem for me is that these letters
    are not particularly helpful for an ID.\r\n\r\n[edit: I changed the last selection,
    because I realized the K was wrong on the one I chose first]\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
