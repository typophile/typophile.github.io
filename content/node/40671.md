  sort of thirties/forties outline style that, when read, makes you want to jump in
  a conga line with delores del rio.  i know nothing about typestyles at all other
  than the standard ones. any ideas/suggestions? '

  body: i thank you both for your suggestions.  i really liked castaway pattyfab.  but
    i found 'poster paint' and i think that is what will be used.  if it all goes
    through, i will post what the sign looks like.
