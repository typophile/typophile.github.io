  text would be old letters that were written to my family in the early 1900's. These
  letters were written in Sicilian dialect, and for any person not educated in this
  particular slang would have been thought to be a reproduction of a poem.The artistry
  in the handwriting was beautiful, having masterful stroke and an artistic swagger
  about it. However, at the base of the letter, I could not help to notice a large
  stamp of a black hand. Through further explanation, my father told me what that
  black hand print meant...It was la mana nera, also known as the black hand.(The
  \"black hand\" is the enforcing side of Nandrangita, aka. \"the Mob\" according
  to American standard)The letter was actually a warning letter that insisted on \"certain\"
  demands or \"certain\" repercussions were sure to follow. Evidently, someone in
  my family made someone very angry years ago in the old country. All I can say is
  that I'm glad my Nono made it here and lived a very long life, all the while avoiding
  any \"black hand\".  \r\n"

    an example of this letter and the \"black hand.\"  Since you can not find the
    letter maybe you can recreate it as one of your digital sketches. It seems as
    though you remember it quite well. Thank-you for sharing this. You are seeing
    how typography is all around you."

  body: "Yes m'am, I wish that I could show you, yet I have no tangible forms of the
    letter since the storm. There were actually five or six different documentations
    of it, I'll try and look it up....not too sure if it can be found..I actually
    would like to find it my self, especially being that I lost my connection after
    my Nonna died during the evacuation from Katrina.\r\nIf I could find it, I will
    definately post it. \r\nBtw... at a time, my ToTo was the oldest living immigrant
    in the state, I could possibly find the interview that the Times Picayune did
    on him in the late 90's...I would enjoy other people hearing his story. My only
    grief with that would be the \" the \"!true!\" story   of what actually happened
    concerning his life. I'd like to talk to you outside of the internet for that.\r\n-louie
