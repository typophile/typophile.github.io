  CS3, Now that all of the text has been flowed into the frames I want to disable
  the break threading\u2014without altering what is currently in the frames\u2014so
  I can work with my hierarchy and not need to keep tweaking frame heights. Is there
  a way to do this? \r\n\r\nAnd I want to do it <em>without</em> copy-pasting everything
  in reverse order."

    select the "Scripting resources" tab, and download the "InDesign CS3 Sample Scripts".
