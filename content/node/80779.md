body: Hi there! Does anyone have any information about the sans serif font, Compacta?
  My classmate and I were assigned to this font and are required to do a research
  on it. So far i have got the year it was created and the creator, Fred Lambert.
  I need the history of the font; eg. why is it named compacta, how the designer came
  about this design. We failed this assignment as we did not have enough information
  and now are given a second chance. Pls pls help us if you know anything or if you
  have any related links! Thank you so much!!

    is available before assigning Compacta as a research subject. In the case of many
    fonts there is little or no information available\u2014at least within the means
    of undergraduate students. Your professor would not be the first person to assign
    students to research a font that\u2019s effectively impossible for you to research."
