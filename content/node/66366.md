  lower case glyphs. I try not to over-do the diagonal stress, so it'd work through
  the weights with fairly egual strength, even though in thin weights there is only
  so much one can do. That is why tried to damp the heavier weights.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Tip1_3867.png]\r\nand

  body: "Thanks, Stephen-\r\n\r\nNow we'we come to an area of objectivity, I think.
    I like the way it's tipping to the left. Bringing it back would turn the font
    too average. For me a thing to conteplate is 'k': should I keep it as is, or make
    a vertical connection? "

  body: "Thanks, Hrant-\r\n\r\nI stole that from Zuzana Licko, and have been using
    that style for some ten years now, even though it's a nuisance in italics, when
    you have to re-draw them, instead of just turning them over."
