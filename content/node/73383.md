    larger in quality\r\n\r\nhttp://www.pixentral.com/show.php?picture=15QwUfoyffp867fsQrrtRzDfL0nFDM\r\n\r\n\r\n@Tomi:
    Sorry to be a bit ignorant about it, but which font is Garamond Pro Book? I did
    a search in Google and all i could find is either Garamond Premier Pro or Adobe
    Garamond Pro.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "If this is Version 3.1 (\xA92005) of Bringhurst's \"Elements of Typographic
    Style\" then it is Minion. I would think he used it in prior versions/editions
    too."

  body: '@ Aaron, you are right, the book is "Elements of Typographic Style" version
    3. So all direction points to Minion. Thanks!'

  body: Actually Bringhurst mentions the typefaces he used (Minion and Scala Sans)
    explicitly in his book, but if you have only this scan you wouldn't know. Worth
    buying though if you don't have it yet.
