  like the soft and curly look ... do any of you know similar fonts, or what this
  one is?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/minstrels_6502.jpg]\r\nThanks :)"

  body: "Slimbach does do lovely fonts! This Cronos Italic is very restful. But, no
    curly toes on the lowercase n and i. The t is extremely close I think. \r\nPerhaps
    could it be customised?"
