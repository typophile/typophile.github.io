    ability to hide IP. Also, I think you have to install both Comic Sans and Hobo
    on your system to hide IP.\r\n\r\n--\r\nMike"

    ip.  It won't protect you from viruses or spam or anything like that. The only
    ppl that can connect you to your ip is your isp. \r\n\r\nSo don't worry about
    it... "
