  of income comes from each retail outlet.\r\n\r\nMost serious foundries would be
  signed up with two or three, I assume.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\nMyfonts.com: 40%\r\nfonts.com
  (monotype): 30%\r\nfonthaus.com: 10%\r\nfoundry website: 10%\r\nveer: 10%\r\netc.\r\n\r\nAny
  information would be appreciated and useful as well. Currently I am only signed
  up with myfonts.com, but I would like to do some revenue projections. This could
  be useful information for other smaller foundries to tweak thier marketing.\r\n\r\nThank
  you,\r\n\r\nJDooley"

    Nick? You do add a few fonts a month.

  body: Yes, I add five fonts a month, BUT the bulk of my sales are from fonts that
    were released as long as six years ago, so new additions aren't the only factor.

  body: "James, \r\n\r\nThanks for your comments:\r\n\r\n\"As to your revenue projections,
    I can\u2019t see how one foundry\u2019s revenue breakdown can be of any help to
    another foundry. Unless you are selling the same designs!\"\r\n\r\nYes, we probably
    would cater to different markets, but it is still handy to see what other firms
    are used by small foundries to see if it would be worthwhile to contact them with
    the possibility of distribution. I don't think that offering fonts in different
    venues competes - it just gets the word out that much better.\r\n\r\n\"Also, how
    much are you willing to give up in royalties to these different venues, and what
    do you get for your money? A secure e-commerce web site and payment gateway are
    not that expensive to set up. Will these venues really earn their take in the
    marketing of your types?\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, most small foundries don't have
    name recognition. Nobody is going to go to \"smallfoundrywebsite.com\" to get
    typefaces for a project. They are going to go to a larger site, with more selection
    to find exactly what they are looking for.\r\n\r\n\"A few fonts floating in a
    sea of other fonts. They are already doing that on the internet, do you want to
    bury them again in the excessive libraries of some of these mega-resellers?\"\r\n\r\nI
    disagree that releases are \"buried\" on myfonts.com, in particular, and I dont
    think that typefaces really compete with each other. If a designer sees something
    he/she likes, they buy it. Myfonts.com does a great job of assisting small foundries
    with promotion. I would also agree with Nick: obviously, I can't see traffic information
    for myfonts.com in general, but my growth on myfonts is exponential. Each font
    that I add brings in more interest to the foundry. My sales on myfonts.com generally
    come from freelance designers.\r\n\r\nIn summary, offering fonts through other
    firms is a multiplier, helping get your offerings out in front of the public.
    All I want to know is what other foundries feel is the most effective.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for your comments James,\r\n\r\nJDooley"
