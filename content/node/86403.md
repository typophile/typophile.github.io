body: "In examining commercial typefaces for the release of my own in-progress font,
  I've been very surprised to find that a number of TrueType fonts, such as Trade
  Gothic LT Std Bold and Folio Bk BT Book don't include diacritical variations of
  the basic alphabet in their kerning pairs. In other words, \"AV\" and \"LY\" are
  kerned fine, but \"\xC4V\" and \"L\u0178\" are un-kerned entirely.\r\n\r\nMy understanding
  is that TrueType doesn't support kerning classes, which understandably makes the
  total number of kerning permutations for all such variants pretty huge, but that
  raises two obvious questions:\r\n\r\n1) Difficulty aside, how does that matter?
  Typographers using diacriticals don't have less need for kerning simply because
  of the limitations of a font format. I can't imagine the world was waiting for OpenType
  to emerge for years before it'd finally have complete kerning capabilities.\r\n\r\n2)
  Surely tools must exist (or did exist) for designing a font with a class-based system
  that then simply export a traditional, flat list of TrueType kerning pairs upon
  completion. The class-based approach, as I understand it, really only benefits the
  developer anyway. It's not as if end users of a font are directly making use of
  class-based representation of kerning pairs (again, as I understand it).\r\n\r\nSo
  what am I missing here? As an American English speaker I rarely have use for diacriticals,
  but even I find it hard to believe that this sizeable portion of the worldwide Latin
  alphabet is routinely left un-kerned by professional type designers when targeting
  the TrueType format. Furthermore, I was planning targeting TrueType myself for simplicity's
  sake (as my typeface has no real need for OpenType features), but if there's some
  technical reason why I can't kern the entire set of diacriticals as well, that's
  a deal breaker to be sure."

    early Postscript font era. Type 1 Postscript fonts had a much smaller limit for
    kerning pairs than TrueType and OpenType, so these pairs were not created. When
    the big vendors convert fonts over to newer formats they automate most of the
    conversion work and often do not add kerning classes where they should. "
