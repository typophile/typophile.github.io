    and the Monotype\r\nThe Origin of Digital Typesetting\r\nBy Richard L.\tHopkins\r\nThis
    special hardback edition is limited to 300 copies. It includes a 24-page Monotype
    letterpress keepsake booklet, Going with Goudy to Philadelphia, composed, printed
    in several colors, and signed by Richard Hopkins. Tolbert Lanston and the Monotype
    is printed in full color, with more than three hundred photos and illustrations,
    192 pages, plus several appendices and index.\r\nLEARN THE UNTOLD STORY OF DIGITAL
    TYPESETTING. \r\nTolbert Lanston, at the end of the nineteenth century, was a
    man obsessed with the idea of creating a machine which would provide automated
    typesetting yet preserve all the nuances of excellence in typography and fine
    printing. This also is the story of the man and the company that created and manufactured
    Monotypes for three-quarters of a century. \r\nAn American Civil War veteran,
    Lanston has remained a poorly documented hero of the typographic revolution. His
    Monotype System was the very first digital concept put into daily use in typesetting
    plants across the globe. The Monotype was a groundbreaking precursor to the computer
    revolution in the typesetting industry, though it was introduced over seventy
    years before computerized typesetting systems were developed. While an official
    publication date has not yet been announced, it is anticipated that the book will
    be ready for shipment in February 2013.\r\nPrice:   $75.00   Pages: 220     Cover:
