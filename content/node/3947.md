  body: ' there are three i:s, two o:s, two e:s and two C:s in the title. none of
    them are the same. which strongly suggests that it is actually written by hand.
    which is good. calligraphy/handwriting rules. '

  body: It is beautiful, isn&#39;t it!? I also think it was hand-lettered. However,
    P22 offers some very beautiful hand-y imitations such as  <A HREF="http://www.p22.com/ihof/dearest.html"
    TARGET="_blank"> Dearest</A> or <A HREF="http://www.p22.com/ihof/ladanse.html"
    TARGET="_blank"> La Danse</A>.

    PsyOps</A> is quite beautiful, and the &#34;Olde&#34; style has the same rough
    line quality as your sample. And a little more daring &#40;and absolutely free&#41;
    are the delightful Selfish and Porcelain from <A HREF="http://www.misprintedtype.com/"
    TARGET="_blank"> Eduardo Recife</A> who has one of the finest collections of freeware
    grunge type I&#39;ve come across.

  body: ' Yves, that Anglia script is yummy. I think I might even prefer that to Sloop.
    It seems a bit more calligraphic &#40;by hand&#41; as opposed to compugraphic
    &#40;by computer&#41;... '

  body: ' That&#39;s gorgeous handlettering; I really wish it were a font.  But Anglia,
    Dearest, and Opsmarckt are absolutely beautiful and perfect for the eighteenth
    century mood, too.  Thanks for all your excellent advice! '
