    design a non-stencil version?\r\n\r\ng -- love it\r\nk & K -- too wide, curve
    of leg feels out of place\r\nw -- looks squashed, probably because of middle vertical
    stroke\r\nz -- too wide\r\ns -- maybe too wide \r\nV -- somehow out of place,
    can't figure out why\r\nW -- seems out of place or off somehow\r\nt -- too many
    cuts too close to each other\r\nf -- same\r\n"

  body: I'll add myself onto Tiffany's comments, except that I have one more suggestion
    about the f. It looks like a r (I know, a different form than your r) with another
    stroke on top of it, instead of feeling more f-like.

  body: "I wish I'd get more comments on my font projects too. I have some stuff going
    on in serif and experimental that hasn't gained much attention.\r\n\r\nWhat you
    have here is more of a broken-stroke design than a true stencil. That's fine as
    a decorative element in a digital font, but stencils are designed with something
    else in mind. If it's just the decorative impression of a stencil you're going
    for, this is great, but for a functional stencil you'll need to engineer it a
    bit more carefully.\r\n\r\n The crossbars on a stencil (that appear as gaps in
    the letter forms) are structural members of the stencil board. there to suport
    the parts of the board that would tend to go floppy and break off dure to their
    narrow attachments or fall out completely from being fully detached otherwise.
    Graphic appearance is a consideration, but a secondary one. \r\n\r\nYour \"K\"
    and \"L\" are good examples of this principle in action, while the V cut of the
    \"M\" looks likely to break or erode with repeated use. \r\n\r\nThose curved cuts
    in some of your letters are very interesting, but would be unlikely to be used
    for a stencil other than a die-cut paper one not more than a few inches high.\r\n\r\nPicture,
    if you will, each of those letter forms cut out from a 6 foot square steel sheet.
    Think of how you would most simply weld bars across the open letter spaces to
    hold all the pieces together through repeated handling.\r\n"

  body: I like this. The diagonal stroke of z is too thin. V/v looks out of place
    because the break is down the center, which has been deliberately avoided in all
    the other letterforms. 3 seems like it could use another break, perhaps across
    the lower right.
