Some manuscripts come remarkably close to even justification, for pages at a time, showing that the scribe was very experienced and had a good sense of how much he needed to stretch or expand letters and spacing in a line to fit his text. Of course, having the freedom to break a word wherever he felt like it made things easier: linguistically based hyphenation rules are a later development. And where did Gutenberg get the idea of hanging punctuation, something that it neither easy nor obvious to do in typesetting? From the manuscripts of course: justification was the ideal long before Gutenberg made it a mechanical reality.</div>

At some stage of the process, the new technologists would have reviewed their rag-right &quot;imitation of calligraphy&quot; and found it looked bogus, the ragged edge being at odds with the precision of the letterforms; a scribe who was slow, careful and neat with individual glyphs would have lavished similar attention on getting a nice smooth rag. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hence precise typographic justification originated as  aesthetic camouflage. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->However, the Gutenburg Bible's justification was still not &quot;true&quot; (the right side of the column is not as &quot;straight&quot; as the left), and nonetheless resorts to a much greater amount of hyphenation than a scribe would have tolerated.

		<div class="commentbody">I suspect you are right about this Hrant. Mass copying was a great concern. Especially with the establishment of the University system. The impetus for the development of a form of mechanical writing came about as a call for a means to eliminate the corruption of text that copying was increasingly responsible for. My understanding is that the papal authority Nicholas of Cues made this proclamation (in writing) and was also responsible in some manner for a substantial amount of the funding for B42. Schoeffer was a copyist in Paris and may have had a crucial role in the formatting of the book and fitting of the typeface.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Scriptoria did two kinds of work: production of prestige editions and production of multiple copies of common texts that were needed for study or other regular use, e.g. breviaries. There is a world of difference between <em>Les tres riches heures du Duc de Berry</em> and the breviary that the average monk would have to pray the daily office, if he had his own copy at all.*  In both cases, again, what was being copied was the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->text,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> not the layout. The whole point of prestige editions was uniqueness of design, illumination and binding. In the case of the mass-produced texts, there simply was no need to match line-breaks or any similar level of layout detail. Many of them were quite hastily and untidily written &ndash; the ones you don't see reproduced in books about mediaeval manuscripts &ndash;, hence the attraction of printing to which Gerald refers. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* Saint Francis would not allow his monks to own their own breviaries. In practical terms, since members of the mendicant orders moved about a lot and would not always be able to pray the office in a church, Franciscans must have been able to pray the office from memory, which is no small feat.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The actual lettering of the manuscripts was generally not done by scribes but by the copisti or copyists. The scribe was in charge of the editing and assembly of the text. Usually they worked from multiple, differing copies of the same text, wrote what they felt was a definitive version, then doled parts out to different copisti. The scribes' version would not be bound so that it could be broken into signatures. Copisti would work on individual signatures of vellum or parchment which would then be assembled and bound. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Scribes could read and write, while not all copisti could read. It wasn't part of the job since all they had to do was copy letter by letter. The scribe was usually the one who set the page layout for copisit to follow. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->John is correct in that most of the manuscripts of that time are not very attractive or even well written or lettered. Most of what we see reproduced is the best stuff, though the general quality improved over time as it became more of a commercial business. There were commercial scriptoria sucessfully operating into the 1500s side by side with printing. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->One reason for the lack of quality is the monastary system had no method of recruiting people who could write, as few people could write in the first place. The church had to take whoever showed up and train them. Imagine taking 30-40 people off the street and finding even one good writer or calligrapher in the bunch. And writing was especially bad amongst nobility because of the difficulty of finding people who could teach it, one of the reasons Charlemagne's educational efforts started with a school of writing and lettering, and the development of a codified style of lettering &ndash; Carolingian <!-- raw HTML omitted -->George</div>
