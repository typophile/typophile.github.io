    body: "I'm afraid I have no clue - I've searched every font library I know of
      and have come sort of close, but no exact matches. I am aware the artist is
      modern - in fact the print in question was done in 2006. I'm thinking that they
      might all be hand-drawn? I'm trying to match to fonts for another print - I
      will probably have to just choose something close. For the script font I'm considering
      Shelley Script or Old Fashion Script Regular. \r\n\r\nThe CINCINNATI looks very
      familiar, but the N is very unusual. I've attached another sample of that font
      in case that helps. \r\n\r\nI also have not tried font recognition software,
      but that might be the next step. \r\n\r\nThanks for your efforts![img:sites/default/files/old-images/portland_font_3777.jpg]"

    close and may be what I'll end up going with. \r\n\r\nFor the script, I found
    Shelley Script and Gracia Solo AS No. 44, but think the best match is one of the

    is the closest match, not sure if I'll find anything closer.\r\n\r\nI've a feeling
    the CAD plotter might have been how these were originally done, so I think you

  body: S Allan - You'd be on shaky ground using Exmouth - or any Primafont font -
    commercially. They were a (now defunct) German company that sold ripoff clones
    of existing fonts. Exmouth was their clone of <a href='http://old.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/kuenstler-script/'

  body: "For the script, consider a Spencerian script. For example the one   released
    by MacKellar, Smiths, & Jordan around the 1880s. Ryoichi Tsunekawa has digitized
    it as Antique Spencerian  http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/antique-spenserian/\r\nA
    Spencerian script is an elegant, flowing style of cursive penmanship that was
    developed in the middle of the 19th century by Platt Rogers Spencer. Spencerian
    script handwriting became the dominant form of penmanship in the United States
    for the rest of the century. As you can see, strokes are graceful and rhythmic,
    and letterforms are characterized by flowing loops and flourishes.\r\nA search
    for Spencerian script produces other similar fonts.\r\nDon"
