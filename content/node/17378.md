body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Typefaces]] : Trebuchet</strong>\r\n\r\nTrebuchet,
  designed by [[Vincent Connare]] in 1996, is a [[humanist]] [[sans serif]] designed
  for easy screen [[readability]]. Trebuchet takes its inspiration from the sans serifs
  of the 1930s which had large [[x-height|x heights]] and round features intended
  to promote readability on signs. The typeface name is credited to a puzzle heard
  at Microsoft, where the question was asked, \"could you build a Trebuchet (a form
  of medieval catapult) to launch a person from the main campus to the consumer campus,
  and how?\" The Trebuchet fonts are intended to be the vehicle that fires your messages
  across the Internet. \"Launch your message with a Trebuchet page\"."
