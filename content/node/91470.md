body: "I came across this typeface, named MacFarland, while searching the specimen
  books of ATF, Barnhart Brothers, and Inland for information about their uniform
  line systems:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/macfar_5716.jpg]\r\n\r\nIt
  appears in the 1907 Inland Type Foundry catalog, with the notation \"Cut by Permission
  of Genzsch & Heyse\", so it apparently existed some time before that catalog, and
  had achieved a significant degree of popularity.\r\n\r\nIn any event, despite the
  fact that this typeface does have a lowercase k and an uppercase D, not shown in
  the illustration, that are sufficiently distinctive that it appears to have been
  intended for display... the sharp serifs and strong angled stress reminded me of
  a certain contemporary typeface from 1935 which had recently been embroiled in controversy
  concerning an alleged earlier origin in 1904.\r\n\r\nSince 1907 is after 1904, and
  this typeface is not as close a match as that of William Starling Burgess, this
  <em>may</em> not be a significant find...\r\n\r\nSubsequent Google searches have
  allowed me to learn that this face dates from 1897 or earlier, and its original
  name was R\xF6mische Antiqua; A. D. Farmer and Son sold it as Bradford; Lanston
  Monotype as well as Inland Type Founders called it MacFarland, and it was also known
  as Haddonian."
