body: "<a href=\"SGX 535 \">Marvell, a chip maker just announced a new mobile CPU/GPU</a>
  that might make 300DPI tablets a reality late next year. Marvell claims the chip
  is \u201Dcapable of driving four simultaneous displays at up to 2K x 2K resolution\u201D.
  That doesn\u2019t give it the capability to run a 7\" tablet at 300DPI, but if I
  get sloppy with math and throw Moore\u2019s law at it the version that gets released
  next fall will be able to handle a 7\" tablet just fine. I have no clue how this
  relates to future iPad developments, but this thing will be great for small Linux
  tablets/readers at 300DPI.\r\n\r\nOf course, that all assumes somebody other than
  Apple can actually manufacture a 300DPI LCD, and I have no clue what\u2019s going
  on with that side of the technology."

    screens, and with the surge in digital readers and advanced reading technologies
    like the Kindle, I think your estimations are definitely correct. Let's hope these
    higher resolutions come to things other than simply tablets, though. I'd love
    to see what the next \"1080p\" will be."

    I haven't been able to find out if the manufacturing process is tied up by patents
    or exclusivity arrangements."

  body: While I do remember that a 100 dpi electrostatic printer still produced output
    that, while impressive, fell short of printed documents - while even the most
    ordinary 300 dpi laser printer produced output that looked like real typesetting
    - on LCD screens today, anti-aliasing techniques seem able to make a 100 dpi screen
    work quite well for printing, at least in sizes of 11 points or more.

    powerful enough to render the number of pixels required for 300DPI laptop and
    desktop screens. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a consumer graphics card that
    could even drive a screen the size of a full-size, 9.7\", 300 DPI iPad; if there
    is it\u2019s much bigger than an iPad, uses an external power supply, and has
    a really noisy fan. "

  body: Hmm...the video card in my 'consumer' mac at the moment is supporting 4160x1440.
    If my math is right, that's plenty of power to run a 13" tablet @ 300dpi. (though
    you are correct, perhaps it's a power hog--though it has no fan at the moment)

    and the efficiency at which they can run.

    indeed, if one isn't doing a 3-D animation for a computer game, one does not need
    that fancy a GPU. Some extra processing power is required for anti-aliasing text,
    which is why you can turn off ClearType in Windows, but this isn't like playing
    Crysis or even Doom III."
