body: I am designing a standard legal contract to give to my freelance clients. Should
  I set the contract in cold, serious font or set all the business documents in the
  same font for consistency?

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_3651.gif]\r\n\r\nIs it usual
    to do all business documents in the same font or to have a friendly tone for marketing
    letters and more serious tone for things like contracts?\r\n\r\nI have got the
    contract in Charter at the moment, but for a general business font I like Bembo.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Sorry for the joke :(\r\n\r\nYes, in my experience, companies tend to set
    all correspondence in the same typeface; there is only one company image. Some
    companies have also \"correspondence\" cuts of their corporate typefaces, i.e.,
    a version of their typeface that looks more like a typewriter, to make the secretaries
    feel more comfortable (this is not a joke). At a Berlin Typostammtisch, Ole Sch\xE4fer
    from PrimeType said that they still make these for some of their clients.\r\n\r\nI
    don't see what benefit you'd have from setting some documents in Charter and others
    in Bembo. Both typefaces are just fine. Depending on what laser printers you use
    in house, one may look more readable on your company stationary than the other,
    but that is about it. As far as I am concerned, it would be better to use either
    one of the faces, and just stick with that. It helps build up brand consistency
    a little bit.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, what really matters in your contracts
    is what they say, not in what typeface they are set in. I know that this sounds
    a little blasthemous, butreally, as long as you are using a nice legible and readable
    typeface (consitenctly?), the rest really does not matter all that much. Document
    layout matters a little, too, as do fine typesetting aids, like perhaps small
    caps, old style figures, ligatures, etc."

  body: Remember that ultimately your contract is for the court. So anything that
    puts you in a less than serious light with the court will probably be a bad idea.

  body: I use Minion Pro for my own contracts and legal documents. With the right
    layout and setting it looks darned authoritative---solid and serious with just
    enough underlying elegance to give it some class. Be sure to use the ligs, small
    caps and OSFigs too and it'll blow any opposing lawyer right out of the water.
