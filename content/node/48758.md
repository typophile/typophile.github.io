  body: Thanks Ralf, just what I needed. But $499 seems a bit too much for such a
    thing. Any alternative?

    noob when it comes to programming so I could not do that :(

  body: "What Ralf is hinting to can be observed if you download one of the example
    fonts. You can open them in TextEdit (or another pure ASCII editor) and examine
    them at will. They appear to contain an XML header in some propriety format, followed
    by encoded data of the actual images.\r\n\r\nNot something you could program off-hand
    (although the $499 seems a bit steep).\r\n\r\nI seem to be missing the actual
    how-to-use as a font, though -- does a Mac recognize these files as a valid font
    type?"

    can currently use photofonts in Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator using the
    free Photofont Start plugin. Plugins for Adobe InDesign and QuarkXPress are currently
    close to be released, as is Photofont WebReady, an application that allows web
    designers to produce dynamic web page headlines using photofonts (using a mechanism
    similar to sIFR). \r\n\r\nAdam\r\n"
