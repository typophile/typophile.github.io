  that the tied st ligature is a default lig in Meta Pro? \r\n\r\nThis seems a strange
  choice for a \"workhorse\" font, especially since such less obtrusive ligs like
  fft are discretionary. Is this a mistake?"

    seems this may be a common \"problem\" with FF fonts?"

  body: "I downloaded the free Meta Pro font and opened it in FontLab. The st ligature
    is indeed included in the liga feature (the standard ligatures). This seems like
    a mistake to me. \r\n\r\nThey also included the ij which is (I think) only used
    in Dutch. Not that it matters since it is indistinguishable from setting an i
    followed by a j. I think this is normally supposed to be handled like the German
    double s, not by a ligature feature."

  body: It could be that they made a special version to demonstrate their range for
    some of the other ligatures. Maybe? Stephen?

  body: "There are also some hinting bugs - the tops of the c and q overshoot the
    x-height blue zone, resulting in glitchy rasterization at some common sizes (e.g.
    16 ppem, a.k.a 12 point on Windows).\r\n\r\nBut it's still a nice piece of work.\r\n\r\nT"

  body: The 'st' ligature as "standard" was definitely an oversight and will be fixed
    in Meta OT and Pro first, with the other offending FontFonts to follow. All future
    OT FontFonts will have these ligatures in the proper place. Thanks!
