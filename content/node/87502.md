body: "Hi guys I'm looking for this font. It's a sort of racing bold font. Particularly
  I like how some of the letters (the \"R\" and the \"A\") point out the bottom a
  bit. Wouldn't mind recommendations to other fonts that have that pointing out style...either
  on the top or bottom.\r\n\r\nPicture attached,\r\nThanks!"
