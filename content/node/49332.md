body: Today I was in the court of my town and I see some beautiful notice set in Comic
  Sans all caps (size 100 points). I can't imagine a font most suitable to italian
  justice.

    and, you guessed it, Comic Sans.  I thought they had some too on my tax return
    but I just checked and it doesn't.  Heh, at least one branch of the government
    has it right.  My pre-application form for the TED program at UAM also sported
    it.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea tan fina que apenas nos damos cuenta
