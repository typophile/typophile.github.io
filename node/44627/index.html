  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>We&rsquo;re at a point as foundries that sell fonts primarily where it&rsquo;s reasonable to only offer OpenType PS fonts for download to customers but there are some that say we must also include TrueType as well since so many older apps don&rsquo;t support loading OT fonts so, faced with the prospect of updating my entire library in OT, do I cover all bases and include OpenType PS, Mac/Win PS, and Mac/Win TT for the respective buyers? Do I only over OpenType PS? Do I offer OpenType PS AND Mac/Win TT?</p>
<p>The problem is, if I only offer OpenType PS, I&rsquo;m likely to get e-mails from customers who can&rsquo;t use this format BUT if I offer all three I&rsquo;m likely to get the same amount of folks who think nothing of dragging and dropping a single folder with all three font formats into Suitcase and none of &lsquo;em working so I&rsquo;m trying to mitigate the difference.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like as many different perspectives on this as the group can muster so please share this thread around because I don&rsquo;t feel I&rsquo;m the first foundry to have this concern.</p>
<p>Thanks,
Stuart :D</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I had the exact same concerns when deciding what to do for my site. But I have the luxury of not having any &ldquo;baggage&rdquo; in that I started fresh without any previously made fonts&hellip;</p>
<p>As my speciality is multilingual fonts I needed Unicode support, so Postscript was out of the question. Yay!</p>
<p>At first I though about only offering OpenType PS (the &ldquo;professional&rdquo; format of choice ;), but soon decided that this would leave out too many customers - you need TrueTypes for &ldquo;Office&rdquo; users (especially Powerpoint is finicky with fonts ;)</p>
<p>Finally I decided to sell the the two formats separately - to prevent customers from installing both formats on the same computer and ending up with conflicts.</p>
<p>An added bonus is that both formats can be used on both Mac &amp; Windows&hellip;</p>
<p>So far it has worked out fine.

However, I&rsquo;d offer both PS and TT flavour OpenType fonts.</p>
<p>I have already experienced in some apps, which with some other fonts worked with either, for one specific font they&rsquo;d accept only the TT-flavour OT font. That is, they were fine on screen, both could be used, but when printing, the PS-flavour OT font was messed up.</p>
<p>I have never found out why. Other PS-flavour OTs worked well.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a way of tagging different product versions without giving them different names</p>
<p>The .ttf fonts aren&rsquo;t strictly speaking OpenType, but the difference is moot, as many .otf fonts don&rsquo;t have OpenType features!</p>
<p>(When OS X was introduced, with functionality for Windows TrueType fonts, the benefit of OpenType in providing cross-platform compatability was considerably lessened; subsequently, the benefit of OpenType has come to be more associated with substitution features.)</p>

<p>That said, the question remains, if the OpenType font contains alternates and ligatures, as a courtesy do we need to offer the basic TrueType folks these extra glyphs in the form of an alternate font where they live in the roman slots or do we say, sorry, upgrade and you&rsquo;ll see the features in the OT version?</p>
<p>Stuart</p>
<p>PS: I agree with you Nick that OpenType of itself is now a non-feature but it&rsquo;s been well marketed to convince folks if they aren&rsquo;t using OT fonts they are dinosaurs and so all fonts that aren&rsquo;t OT are also dinosaurs . . .</p>

<p>On the other hand, for those users that live in the other part of the world and where probably still most, but by no means that high percentage has OT-aware swoftware, you Latin-1 encoded 8-bit font won&rsquo;t provide the necessary characters.

<p>Another point to consider: if you are selling opentype fonts: do you use encoded or unencoded &ldquo;special&rdquo; glyphs (like Smallcaps, alternate figures, ligatures, etc.)?
For really opentype-savvy applications, no encoding may be better (no chaos with manually inserted characters and changing fonts), but for everything else, which may support unicode, but almost no typographic features, it would be better to encode this characters to make them available at all&hellip;</p>
<p>Do you just decide which may be better for most of the customers?
Or do you provide two different versions?</p>
