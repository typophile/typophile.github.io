  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello all! I know photography is pretty popular with creative types (see what I did there?), so I figured I'd start a topic. I just recently got my first DSLR! I'm pretty excited. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/77647883@N04/7114477769/">This</a> is the first picture I ever took with it, which wasn't very thought out. It was cold, I felt nervous even holding it (my other camera was a dinky point and shoot), and it was also cold. I mainly just wanted to gawk at the quality. My point and shoot had 5 megapixels, so the same as my iPhone. It was an upgrade of momentous proportions. So, is anyone on here into photography? </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well if we want to relate this topic to typography, you could use your new camera to document interesting typography in signs, statues, grave markers, house numbers, and so forth. Photos like that get posted at Typophile occasionally.

You'll find your DSLR to be a big step up from your point-and-shoot camera. I used to be seriously into photography and sometimes did my own darkroom work in the old days, but unfortunately I just don't have as much free time as I used to and my Nikon mostly sits on the shelf. 

Regarding the number of megapixels, it's certainly a consideration but their importance is sometimes overemphasized (unless you're making a lot of big enlargements, in which case they'll make a big difference). But much of the improvement in quality you'll notice in the DSLR is due to the superior quality of the lenses.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree JamesM. Megapixels definitely aren't everything, but megapixels weren't the only real issue. It was just the quality in general (I know the sensor plays a huge part in that as well). My iPhone takes better pictures, to put that into perspective. Sometimes the shots it took looked kinda neat, like in <a href="http://i392.photobucket.com/albums/pp6/CanwllCorfe/boats_by_canwllcorfe-d2zp4ca-1.jpg">this case</a>, which made the scene far more moody than it actually looked, but the quality is obviously quite bad. Then there's the fact that instead of trying to keep everything in focus, I can actually have depth of field now! But one of the biggest things is that I can take night shots now, which is something I've wanted to do for quite some time. I bought a tripod for my point and shoot, thinking that would help. Nope. </div>

@OT: I know what you experienced: a lot of the joy is in the instruments you use. Even though the experts tell us nowadays that pixels do not count, there is a correlation between pixels, price and lens quality. Always go for the best ‘glass’!

My GF (who is a pro fashion photographer) has been enamored by the Pentax 6*7 system and shot with these heavy analog cameras for most of her career. I gave her a Sony CyberShot T-model in 2005 and that cinched it: the first series she shot with it (kind of “let’s try it, I have a fall back”) was published in Grazia (Italian magazine), with no one noticing any lack of quality. After that she sold of the Pentax stuff and went all digital.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">@Bart, thanks for the tip! I can't wait until I can afford to start getting some more lenses. For now, the kit one (18-55mm) will more than suffice. I figure I'll do all my learning with what I have, and then eventually I can step it up and get more equipment. The one thing I do intend on getting is a polarizing filter. I think that will definitely come in handy for my upcoming trip to Florida. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">When people start into photography the first most common concern is to get a good camera, then many realize it is more important to have a good lens, then some realize it is more important to have good lighting, and then you get old professional photographers toying around with plastic cameras... jejeje.

My point is that in the end the most important thing is for you to be passionate and to think a lot about the photos you take. That way you will develop an area of interest (landscape, birds, portrait, fashion, abstracts, erotic, candid, textures), a style, technical competence and an eye for it.

Having a DSLR is a big step, it will help you gain control over your photography. Experiment a lot with speed and aperture. Learn about light. Having a fast lens (F 2.8), a tripod and a polarizing filter are the three greatest additions to a photographer's kit.

Now I do mostly snapshooting.

Indeed, when I look back at the photos I took during my 6 months in Barcelona (with a low-end -even back then- film SLR) I feel like I'll never be able to take photos like that again no matter what equipment and software I use.

		<div class="commentbody">My ﬁrst digital camera (RDC-7) cost $1300 in 2001, IIRC, and was 3.3 megapixels.
It was awesome, especially the close-up feature.
Now I have a Pentax DSLR, but it is so cumbersome I rarely use it.
Shooting with an older Pentax in the 1970s was a much better experience.
It was smaller, lighter, easier to focus, and more responsive.
It was better designed in general, without the featuritis this new one suffers from.
I spent a long time looking for a simple but adjustable high-res digital camera, but couldn’t ﬁnd one.
Is there nothing between point-and-shoot and these over-designed clunkers?

The tripod rs-donsata mentioned is good advice. There are also telescoping monopods available (one leg); not as stable as a tripod but easier to carry and less obtrusive. A pocket-sized beanbag can also be useful; set it on a rock or railing or whatever and brace your camera against it.

Nick, I agree with you about the featuritis of new cameras. I've never figured out all the settings of my Nikon;   sometimes I miss the simple Mamiya Sekor I used back in the 1980s.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">@rs_donsata Ohh yes, that interest is what I'm honing now. I quite like everything, but living in the Poconos sort of limits me to nature shots. As you can imagine, there aren't many cityscapes here in the woods. I did wish I had some access to them, because one of my favorite thing to take pictures of is the city at nightfall. These settings are really what I'm most excited about. I did a brief covering of them back in High School with a film SLR, but it's been so long. I have a basic knowledge, but I'm hoping to improve that by going and renting books from the local library and doing some online research. 

@JamesM Yeah I should probably invest in a better tripod than the one I have now. Especially considering a lot of what I've been doing lately is night oriented stuff. Well, mainly right now I'm just trying to nail it all down. </div>
