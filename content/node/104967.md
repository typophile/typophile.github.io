body: "On the Monotype website, there are two futuras. One is called Futura(R) and
  the other is called Futura. (R) = the copyright symbol. They are different. The
  most obvious difference seems to be that the capital U of the Futura without and
  (R) has a flattened base and is not just a simple arc. I thought that Futura was
  Futura unless, maybe, a particular foundary was specified, of someone decided to
  \"improve\" on it. What gives?? I want to match a sign in my building foyer, and
  the sign seems to use the Futura without an (R). How do I specify the right one??
  \ \r\n\r\nMonotype does not offer an explanation.  \r\n\r\nMonotype seems to own:
  Monotype, Linotype, ITC, Ascender, and Bitstream.  I suppose that that means that
  Monotype might have ended up owning more than one foundry's version of Futura.  If
  that is the case, should they not offer Futura with the initials of the foundry
  that made that version of Futura (say, Futura MT or Futura BT)?    \r\n\r\nI saw
  on another site, someone saying that there were 7 different foundries that made
  Futura and discussing which was better.  That thread did not mention the Monotype
  thing and didn't mention the obvious width-of-the-U thing either.  I am eagerly
  awaiting hearing your wisdom.  I love this site.  \r\n"
