  body: Looks sort of thickened and modified from <a href="http://www.philsfonts.com/detail.html?sku=AG61208703M1">Busorama
    bold</a>. I&#39;ll see if I can find the actual font.

  body: It&#39;s possible that this is Bosanova, a Corel font which is said to be
    a Busorama equivalent. I can&#39;t find a sample, but &#34;CORREIOS&#34; is definitely
    some form of Busorama.

  body: e ai mello <BR> <BR>busorama is very close, but it is too light. <BR> <BR><img

    <BR>the logo for Correios was designed &#40;in late &#39;60s  <BR>iirc&#41; by
    architect/teacher Eduardo de Jesus  <BR>Rodrigues. i think he custom-designed
    this bolder  <BR>version of busorama for the logo, so probably it  <BR>isn&#39;t
    available as a actual font... <BR>why don&#39;t you ask himself about this? <BR>
    <BR>falou! <BR>

  body: Fala Eduardo! <BR> <BR>In FAU-USP Library we can find the visual identity
    work for the Correios, by Eduardo de Jesus and Klara Kaiser, but their proposal
    used Helvetica or Univers, dont remember, and the colors were blue and green...
    the work stays at the BIG works section in the library &#40;no fund
