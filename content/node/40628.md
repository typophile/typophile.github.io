body: "Hey everyone,\r\nI feel a little out of place here as a copywriter, but I'm
  looking for some advice on buying a gift for my boyfriend, an art director. I know
  the 1912 and 1923 versions of the American Specimen Book of Type Styles are the
  real deal, the bibles of old font reference books. I'm just not sure I can swing
  $250-400 like I'm finding online. I'm keeping an eye on ebay, but I'm not sure if
  anything will get posted for a reasonable price. \r\n\r\nI found someone selling
  both the 1934 and 1941 versions, each about 200 pages, and I was thinking about
  buying both. Does anyone know, (1) Are these two books different enough from each
  other to make them worth having both? And (2) Are these two books even remotely
  comparable to the real things (the 1912 and 1923 versions)? I don't want to buy
  something that's not cool and useful to a designer. \r\n\r\nSorry to interrupt your
  forum with my copywriter's naivety. Thanks in advance for any help. \r\n\r\n- L\r\n\r\n"

  body: "1) i think so. i have both.\r\n2) kind of, not really. there just so much
    more to the larger tomes\r\n\r\nyou can usually find the 1923 version a bit cheaper:
    in the $120-150 range and sometimes for a steal (i got 1 copy for $30 that was
    pristine). the earlier books will be a bit more rare/expensive.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000JC1GHU\">Amazon</a>\r\n<a
