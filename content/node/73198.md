  something of a perfectionist and B) still not having enough experience with type,
  I just can't pick up a typeface from one of the mentioned foundries/vendors and
  not think about whether the others' versions of the same would be better.\r\n\r\nThere
  has to be at least a hundred classical typefaces being offered by all three if not
  even more vendors. Sometimes it should really be the same digitalization because
  they share(d) licenses, LT is owned by MT etc. but often there are differences between
  the designs. Do you have a general rule of thumb you can apply here when choosing?
  E.g. Monotype has older versions and Adobe or LT had technically improved them or
  LT is more like ___ while Adobe is more ___? Or like one pays more atention to kerning,
  the other has the original designs... these questions drive me crazy and I just
  can't spend half my working time comparing the cuts everytime I need a new typeface
  ;-)"

    As with automobile manufacturers, no one company dominates all categories: one
    company may make the best pick-up truck, while another makes the best mid-size
    family sedan..."

  body: And following up on the auto analogy, sometimes a Chevy and a Buick are the
    same car, made by the same foundry, oops, I mean factory, with only the nameplate
    being the difference.

    don't use them. Instead of trying to find the least mediocre of metal type revivals
    just use really great new designs. You'll end up with better work in the long
    run."

    your clients.\r\n\r\nAt least, that's what I do\u2026"

  body: It all depends on the typeface. Some were designed first or better at one
    foundry, others at another.

  body: "It's not just a question of one foundry's cut of a particular face being
    better than another's, they may well be different interpretations which appeal
    to different people for different reasons, and to the same person on different
    occasions.\r\n\r\nBut choosing a font isn't the be-all and end-all. Once you have
    decided on a font, if you've never used it before you still have to become familiar
    working with it, and experiment with the setting for the job in hand. So why not
    trust your instinct in the first place, and then trust your skill to make your
    choice work, rather than second-guessing yourself to distraction. \r\n\r\n"

    EULAs...they're NOT all the same.

    are plenty of good designs with the big vendors. I just think it\u2019s a lot
    more productive to just focus on obviously good new designs than to spend a lot
    of time inspecting various digital revivals of phototype revivals of Linotype
    revivals of foundry type revivals of much older designs."
