  | Fontspring]] and [[http://new.myfonts.com/foundry/Greater_Albion_Typefounders/
  | Myfonts.com]]. \r\n\r\nThe first of these, [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/gatf/cirflex/
  | Cirflex]] was inspired by a 1930s shop sign, and makes an ideal typeface for Streamline
  Era and Art Deco design.  Cirflex is offered in regular and bold weights.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/life3_4229.png]\r\n\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/gatf/oxonia-roman/
  | Oxonia Roman]] is a text family, offered in two weights and two widths, deriving
  it's inspiration from classic Roman typefaces.  It is intended for the setting of
  text legiblyin quantity, and compliments our Anavio and Vectis faces particularly
  well.  Think of it as a sort of restrained lower-case Trajan. :)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/life1_4025.png]\r\n\r\n"
