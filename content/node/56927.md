  body: Depending on the application, Avenir is a good alternative. Avenir is more
    of a silent typeface though. There's a Device font that I had the chance to use
    once on a poster. I think it was called Regulator, and I remember saying it had
    a Avant-Garde feel. I don't know I don't have it here but try it.

    that have a geometric look and feel, ball-and-stick enough to resemble loosely
    avant garde. \r\n\r\nSimilar as in Avenir/Avant Garde? Does that help?\r\nSorry,
    very hard to express it really..."

    could suggest other, less well known alternatives..something fresh.

    Gothic, so I had to go back to the closest match, Sol Hess and his \"strongly

    and it's far less stretched than attributing ITC Garamond to Claude Garamont (with
    a T).\r\n\r\ndr"
