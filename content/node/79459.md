  know this one? the S and W are unusual, the rest is very similar to Grotesque no
  9. I already tried the Bauhaus style font identification guide (http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/BauhausFaces.html),
  but no luck."

    if it was even a typeface and not just a custom logo. I have a suggestion that
    may give a similar result: use <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/parachute/pf-fusion-sans-pro/\">PF
    Fusion Sans Black</a>, and make the W from overlapping U's.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: The company that made these had much custom artwork done, but this one looks
    very much like a font to me. They did use Grotesque No 9 a lot. Maybe only the
    S and W are custom? Or were there any alternate characters for Grotesque No 9?

  body: "For one thing I think the S is wrong, and the font does not show an alternate
    W. Sometimes film or metal versions did have alternates that were not digitized.
    There are so many sans serif typefaces, especially among film types anything might
    have been possible, but the books I have do not show Grotesque No.9 with this
    W.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
