body: 'Hi I&#39;m new here. This is my first attempt at useable typeface design. Tenitively
  named MJ, I based the font on a handwriting style I developed. I didn&#39;t want
  to design a handwriting font but a unique whimisical serif font. It has some charicertistics
  that I wanted to carry over from my handwriting, h, k, f with decenders, the initial
  and terminating curve I sometimes use. The font uses a grid for the structure of
  the letters but I wasn&#39;t hesitant to break it when I needed to. I haven&#39;t
  drawn the UC yet. <BR>Please let me know what you think and what can be improved!
  any suggustions on the z? <BR>Thanks! <BR>Josh Scruggs <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/11437.gif"

  body: 'I&#39;m going to begin working on this again. Any more hints... suggestions?
    Does this have potential? Should I keep going? I&#39;m going to thicken the strokes
    on the round charicters and add some kind of serif to the angled strokes. I might
    also increase the overall stroke weight to add more thick-thin contrast. I think
    the y juts down too much before it curves so I may smooth that. Do some of the
    ball endings seem too big?. Thanks for any help. This is my first font and I realy
    hope I can make it sucessful &#40;or at least learn somthing and start over on
    a new one&#41;. This is a great place and everybody is so knoledgeable about type
    design. I&#39;m a senior graphic design student at the University of Kansas and
    I wish a type design class was offered here. Has anyone taken such a class? Any
    good books on type design? <BR> <BR>Thanks! <BR>Josh Scruggs <BR> <BR>P.S. any
    ideas for a name. I want sonthing more creative than MJ which is more of a personal
    thing. '

  body: 'Hi Josh <BR> <BR>Really nice work! <BR>I think the characters shape are very
    unique. You must go on in this project. <BR>My little suggestions: <BR>The &#34;z&#34;
    needs to be more wide and opened. Maybe, keep the top serif &#40;witch is a drop
    serif&#41; and make the low one as same as the terminal of &#34;c&#34;. It seems
    to me that two drop serifs don&#39;t get along so well. &#40;but this is just
    my opinion&#41;. <BR>Also the lc &#34;s&#34; can be more condensed, it&#39;s too
    wide now. <BR> <BR>Keep up the good work! <BR>Fabio'
