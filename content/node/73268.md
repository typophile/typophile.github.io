    use it to block most of the reflections on the iPad outdoors, if you're reading
    at high noon. In partial shade. With a hat."

  body: "The kids are all inside plying marbles on their iPads.\r\n\r\n \r\n:o)\r\n\r\nSeriously.
    The sidewalks are empty.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, seems like a non-issue to me. Or one where
    each gadget has a strength  where the other has a weakness & vice versa (as far
    as immersive reading is concerned). To read the grey on grey of the kindle can
    get pretty tiring in low light for older people, I think. My own vision really
    goes fuzzy really fast trying to read medium contrast text in anything less than
    perfect lighting. (however that might be defined)\r\n\r\n"

    a Rolls Royce is to off-roading.\r\n\r\n> To read the grey on grey of the kindle\r\n\r\nTrue,
    it could be better - I'm assuming the new version's \"50% higher contrast\" is
    significant. The good news is, light is always abundant and usually free.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "In my experience the Kindle is easier on the eyes than the iPad, but the
    iPad is more convenient as I am more likely to have it with me. With the Kindle
    app, I can sync my place between the two devices and choose whichever one fits
    the situation the best.\r\n\r\nOn a side note, my wife was just telling me about
    a study that claims we are having an epidemic of vitamin D deficiency in the US.
    The cause is believed to be a combination of not going outside enough and not
    drinking regular milk. Serendipitous conversation, and a weird thing for her to
    just bring up out of the blue. Despite my earlier joke, I do read the iPad nearly
    every lunch outdoors, and actually do use my head's shadow to minimize the reflection.
    It works pretty well. Oddly, when in direct sunlight and I turn the page on the
    Kindle, it refreshes with a really, really light gray that is nearly impossible
    to read. So I have to shade that device as well if I want to read outside. Weird."

  body: "The Kindle iPad app doesn't actually use PMN Caecilia, Hrant. It's all Georgia,
    which reads pretty well on the screen.\r\n\r\nThe Nook iPad app, actually, is
    more typographically sophisticated. You can tweak the point size (five choices),
    leading (four choices), font (Amasis, Century Schoolbook, Georgia, Joanna, Times
    New Roman, Ascender Sans, Gill Sans, and Trebuchet), text color, page color, margin
    widths (four choices), and page brightness. There is an option to turn full justification
    on or off, but I have trouble turning it off in some books.\r\n\r\nThere is also
    the option to \"use publisher settings,\" which, on occasion, sets the text in
    Charter."

  body: "I've never been a fan of Caecilia's usurping of the Em space, but it is indeed
    a superb choice for the smaller Kindle; for the DX something with more generous
    extenders would be better. The great news is that the next firmware is going to
    feature a number of -optimized- fonts. Hopefully all that blurring (which can
    be clearly seen in the zooms in the article above) will be gone and eInk's type
    rendering potential will be even more evident.\r\n\r\n> The Kindle iPad app doesn't
    actually use PMN Caecilia, Hrant.\r\n> It's all Georgia, which reads pretty well
    on the screen.\r\n\r\nInteresting. Makes sense in terms of licensing I guess.\r\n\r\nNook:
    I've heard great things about its typography (and used one for a few minutes).
    If they had PDF viewing and free global 3G, I would've gotten that instead.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Hrant, I have no idea what firmware the Kindle has. I assume it's the latest
    because it updates surreptitiously overnight while I sleep. I can't find a way
    to change the fonts on the Kindle app, but you can in iBooks (which I don't use).
    Maybe that's what you were thinking of?

  body: "The Kindle does auto-update, but not always promptly. The 2.5 update was
    about a month ago I think, so I do suspect you have it - but that didn't have
    the new fonts anyway. That update -hopefully- get distributed shortly after the
    new (smaller) Kindle starts shipping, on the 27th. BTW, you can tell what your
    version is by going to Menu->Settings - it's at the bottom-right.\r\n\r\nThere
    <em>are</em> hacks for changing the font on the current Kindles though...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
