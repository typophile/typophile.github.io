body: Dear Type Geniuses! My apologies for the double post but I think I posted this
  in the wrong forum. I'm trying to identify this typeface used for a Robert Crumb
  exhibition in Paris last summer (image attached). I tried researching it on my own
  and the closest I came up with was Blackoak but it's still not quite what I had
  in mind. Your input is greatly appreciated!

  body: "It seems like a heavy Clarendon or Egyptian style, but I cannot find any
    with this M. The middle vertex does not touch the baseline. I searched MyFonts
    with every keyword I could think of, and I searched my own Serif Font ID Guide,
    but I didn't locate a match.\r\n\r\nEither it is a font where the heavy weight
    M is not the same as the lighter weights in shape, or it is from an independent
    foundry that does not sell through MyFonts. I looked at Hoefler and House and
    neither had this either.\r\n\r\nI'll be interested to see if this is a custom
    type.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega\r\n\r\n"
