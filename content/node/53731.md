  body: Letraset Roco is a similar construction but upright, wider and with a very
    different U. What is the age of your sample?

  body: "justin, the example is from a flyer i found which is very recent but i had
    seen Roco on an old letraset sample sheet but it didnt show all the letters /italics
    ect so i wasnt sure...thanks for posting..\r\n\r\nRenko, thankyou very much for
    that link, was super helpful...seems that Grock from Monotype was the original
    (which Roco was based on)\r\nthanks again"

  body: I really like the retro feeling on the slanted version. If it still isn't
    digitized it ought to be!
