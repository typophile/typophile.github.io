  on a template I bought.\r\n\r\nWhat I basically need is replacement of texts, images,
  including the gallery, the logo, accommodation of the menu to the topics of the
  pages, some color scheme changes, removal of some unnecessary elements and setting
  up a signup form. \r\n\r\nThis is the template I mean http://www.flashmint.com/show-template-5664.html\r\n\r\nThank
  you"
