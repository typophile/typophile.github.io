body: "I'm working on a dot font but I have two special criteria that may prove difficult
  to implement.\r\n\r\n1. I want the font when sizing up and down to keep the dots
  the same size, just increase the letter form size.\r\n2. I want the space between
  the dots to expand as the sizing increases until there is room for an extra dot,
  then tighten. Then expand, extra dot, tighten, etc etc. And obviously the reverse
  when sizing down.\r\n\r\n I'm happy to have set increments of size (for example
  increments of 1 point only - no decimal points) to make things easier. And perhaps
  have only a limited range of point sizes available if necessary.\r\n\r\nI hope you
  understand what I'm trying to do and hopefully let me know how I should go about
  this.\r\n\r\nThe look of the font would be something similar to 'Railway thin' or
  'District thin' but in dot form."

    possibly as one separate font for each desired size (named something like BigDots8,
    BigDots16, BigDots128, etc. with instructions to the user to match the font name
    with the point size.\r\n\r\nThis is similar (although for very different reasons
    and with different design techniques) to what Adobe has done with their optical
    fonts (q.v.)\r\n\r\n- Herb"

    And that's interesting about the optical fonts - first I've heard about them."

  body: "So I've more or less completed the font creating all the masters from scratch:\r\n\r\nIt
    has six different masters for six different sizes. As well as a regular and a
    bold version for each size (so that means 12 masters in total)\r\n\r\nSo the names
    of each master are something like this:\r\nSize80 \u2013 Regular\r\nSize80 \u2013
    Bold\r\n\r\nSize100 \u2013 Regular\r\nSize100 \u2013 Bold\r\n\r\nSize120 \u2013
    Regular\r\nSize120 \u2013 Bold\r\n\r\nSize140 \u2013 Regular\r\nSize140 \u2013
    Bold\r\n\r\nSize160 \u2013 Regular\r\nSize160 \u2013 Bold\r\n\r\nSize180 \u2013
    Regular\r\nSize180 \u2013 Bold\r\n\r\nI would preferably like all these to be
    together as a family for ease of use. Unfortunately I'm using \"Glyphs\" which
    only exports a maximum of four. Any ideas about how I can export this font as
    neatly as possible?\r\n(I'll upload it for critique soon)"
