  some \u2018fashion sense\u2019 into the \u2018work horse\u2019, and get something
  unique. I think there's some potential to make it into a text face, eventually expand
  it, but I wanted to get some feedback here first. I honestly have no idea what I'm
  doing, folks. It just sounded like a worthwhile idea to entertain.\r\n\r\nI've been
  looking at Monticello quite a bit, and referencing a generic Bodoni for logic and
  proportion. For what it's worth.\r\n\r\nWhat do y'all think of that |Q|? and\r\nI
  realize the teardrop is missing from the |g|. Bear with me.\r\nThanks to raph for
  the [[http://typophile.com/node/14710#comment-84480|Monticello Specimens.]]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/WrenlochSpec1_5033.jpg]\r\nI've
  attached a PDF so folks could see this without the display disintegrating the stroke. "

    aura!\r\n\r\nBut there's a lot of wonkiness here - too much conflict.\r\nFigure
    out what this needs to be, not [just] where it's coming from.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "A good start but needs refining. I have a bunch of nitpicks, please don't
    take them without a grain of salt.\r\n\r\n--> The |s| looks to me to be a little
    off compared to the |S|.\r\n--> I don't think the tail of the |Q| is quite working.
    Perhaps move it over to the center instead of having it drop off the left side?\r\n-->
    The caps overall seem condensed compared to the lc. Was that intended?\r\n-->
    The spacing, especially the lower case, seems a tad off. Maybe tighten it just
    a tad?\r\n--> I would consider making the word spaces a thinner.\r\n--> The right
    bottom serif of the |l| is shorter than the left, was that intended?\r\n--> The
    |j| seems spaced a little tight on the right side compared to the rest.\r\n-->
    The |r| has an especially large gap to it's right, maybe try something to fix
    that? You could: (a) condense it a little, (b) make the join a little lower, (c)
    lengthen the right bottom serif a tad. A combination of all three wouldn't hurt,
    depending on what you're going for.\r\n--> The lower loop of the |g| is a wee
    bit off. Maybe a little too much towards a Garamond look. You might try looking
    at interesting type samples from near that era. Does anyone have some enticing
    examples? :-)\r\n--> The tail of the |R| and the |g| missing an ear might be off.\r\n\r\nIt
    would be good to mention that every single part of each glyph can be manipulated
    to your benefit. Don't ever be afraid to think outside the box.\r\n\r\nDon't give
    up! Love to see you continue with this."

  body: "A good start! I would encourage you to work on the consistency of the hairlines
    and serifs and stroke endings. \r\n\r\nFor the hairlines (especially on a Didone)
    they must all be the same thickness. From the crossbar on the \"f\" to the legs
    of the \"N\" and the top and bottom of rounded characters like the \"O\", go for
    a consistent thickness throughout.\r\n\r\nThe serifs and stroke endings should
    also be consistently rounded (like on the \"E\") or have the chiseled, straight-edged
    appearance of the rest of the serifs. Also, make sure the serifs appear to be
    about the same thickness as the hairlines. Right now they're a lot thinner looking."

  body: "Thanks everyone for the great feedback. I'll get to work on refining this
    with all the critiques in one.\r\n\r\nHrant - I was amazed too about the Baskerville
    spirit hiding in the hybrid. It wasn't what I was expecting, but I'm really happy
    that it creates something recognizable, but unexpected. I'll work on the wonkiness
    as things get ironed out.\r\n\r\nBri\xE4n - Thanks for all the nit-picks. It's
    just what I needed. All the things you're talking about were unintended. The caps
    being condensed, the spacing overall (not nearly done and considered), and the
    everything else. The funny part is that it started as a slightly condensed design,
    but then I decided to normalize it. I guess it wasn't quite enough.\r\n\r\nJoshua
    - Thanks for the insight on the Didone construction. That'll help decrease the
    wonkiness Hrant was mentioning.\r\n\r\nI'm fairly new to this whole process, and
    I'll try anything that y'all have said. I'll report back by the end of the week.
    Thanks to all three, so much."
