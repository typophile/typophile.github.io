    Medium</a> from Jeremy Tankard Typography.\r\n\r\nOthers here can probably say
    for sure."

    features."

  body: "You can see it clearer from this <a href=\"http://www.diethelmkeller.com/applications/dkg/home.nsf/contentview/media\">pdf</a>
    it seems to be based on Optima but most of the bowing of the verticals has been
    removed and the l altered.\r\nTim"

  body: "In the old Image Club days, they had a font called 'Omni' that was clearly
    based on Optima, but more simply drawn. The subtle curving of the strokes was
    missing. That sounds like what you described, although I admit it's hard for me
    to tell. \r\n\r\nI was unable to find a better match than Optima, and so would
    agree that a modified version of something that borrowed heavily from Optima is
    a good guess.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
