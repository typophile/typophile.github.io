body: "I recently started some projects for a company that until recently have been
  using a very cheap font (dont' remember the name, but I believe it was free) for
  most of their body copy. They use a lot of caps & numbers that look really bad because
  of the lack of small caps and proportional numbering in the cheap font.\r\n\r\nThey
  are technology/web based, so I'm looking for something modern looking, yet professional.
  I would prefer a sans serif, but I might be able to convince them into a semi-sans
  as long as it has that \"modern\" touch. Of course it would be nice to have small
  caps, and a large family to choose from.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any suggestions,
  I'm pretty much open to anything."

  body: "Thanks again for the suggestions, very good stuff.\r\n\r\nI'll probably end
    up using a lot of these other fonts in other projects, as I'm very fond of a few
    of them.\r\n\r\nOne last question, is there anything specific to the Adobe Fontfolio,
    Monotype, or Emigre collections? I ask this because these are currently the only
    foundries/collections the owner knows of and already has a decent collection going."

  body: The two best sans serifs on the market are Linotype Syntax, whose basal weight
    is just perfect (many of its wannabes, like Myriad, start with too heavy a base
    weight, although if that's what you need for web use, then look at Myriad, used
    on Apple screens nowadays), and Joshua Darden's Freight Sans, a very subtle Gill-inflected
    design. Both offer oldstyle figures and different weights. Both look very stylish
    without hitting you over the head that way Klavika and Etelka do.

  body: "\"The two best sans serifs on the market are...\"\r\n\r\nIn Your Humble Opinion.\r\n\r\nNote
    that Klavika and Etelka are really in a different category from Syntax and Freight
    Sans (and all the equally excellent members of that category), and that Myriad
    isn't known as a \"wannabe\" of Syntax. Klavika and Etelka do offer some of what
    Mike seems to be asking for: Modern. \r\n\r\nFor web use, Storm's Vida might be
    useful; it's made for low-res situations and has the square shapes that may telegraph
    \"modern\" to your client. Very large family with 3 widths and Mono versions.\r\n\r\nFor
    something more typographic (less screen-tuned) try the new Mundo Pro family. Good
    for all purposes, at all sizes."
