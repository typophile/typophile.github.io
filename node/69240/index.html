  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Here's a logo that we designed for a client who's going to be selling luxury goods online. Since the main thing was "luxury" we wanted to use a mink to create a kind of "monogram" with the D. 

As it turned out, minks aren't very pretty so we kept using a squirrels as reference. When it was done, it looked nothing like a mink anymore, but we had all fallen in love with it, so it's staying.

What I am really curious about is what you guys think about the choice of typefaces. The client is a big believer of polls and I want to see if there is a difference between his results and mine. Just for fun. 

Please tell me which of the three options you like best. I'm hoping to get as many votes as possible so that there's a halfway decent sample size. Thanks!

Not the slab.

I would find a happy medium between the stem heights of versions two and three, and going with the didone for the name. Also, the logomark feels unbalanced where it is. Could we see an example of the <em>d</em> centered? (keeping the squirrel where it is relative to the <em>d</em>. In other words, don't center the bounding box of the letter and varmint; just the letter.)</div>

Here're the changes in alignment:

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/options1_3714.jpg]

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/options3_5708.jpg]

I thought that the first one, which is centering the d to the words below looked worse. 
The second one is done optically, is that better?

I think there is something tricky about the two words below. Whenever I center align anything to the words, they never look centralised.</div>

It does the best job of balancing the elements, and the tiny x-height connotes luxury.
The tiny x-height also makes balancing the elements less problematic.

Is the balancing act an issue for the target market?
Does the tiny x-height connote luxury for them?

I wouldn't pay too much attention to a poll of typophiles on such issues.</div>

I like the third one with the short fat d and the sans serif.
And your comments about the centering of the text is on the money. Have you considered centering DOORSTEP LUXURY between the left part of the d and the squirrel's tail, which would move the d to the left? J. Tillman</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'm quite surprised. The didone was my first instinct, but I started to turn against it because I felt it was a predictable choice for fashion and luxury and quite staid for a store that was going to be selling purely online. 

The slab felt right to me. Maybe I've been reading too much Esquire, <a href="http://www.wmagazine.com/w/blogs/editorsblog" target="blank">W</a> and pretty much just about everywhere. Slabs feel bold, current, even slightly brash (or had an immediacy which I felt was suitable for the online target audience). 

But I was worried that it might be faddish. And I started having second thoughts when I saw the Burger King logo. It became hard to justify using such a sporty kind of face for the brand.

I wonder if anyone shares my opinion about 
1) the didones being predictable, safe and staid for luxury fashion? It's far too sameish. 
2) that the slab is more suitable than the didone, because despite being chunky and pedestrian (on its own), the overall brand still comes across sophisticated because of the colours used?

Aluminium: funny you should say that. In some parts of the brand application, I actually lean towards dropping of the d. But in the nascent stages of the brand development, we will want to use the DL monogram as much as possible. The squirrel looks very good on its own though, scurrying across the bottom of a letterhead. 

J Tillman: Yup, that's the client's pick as well. The first two were the options provided (one radical and one safe). And the third one was the clients request, based on Georgia's proportions!

Nick Shinn: Yes, this is purely for the sake of discussion. I'm curious to see if there is a big difference between designers (who think about type a lot) and lay people (who judge type on instinct). As it stands now, there does not seem to be much of a difference. Most people prefer the second option and the client likes the third one. Between the second and the third, I prefer the second option because the proportions are more "display" compared to the third one which just looks like enlarged bodytext.

I do need to work on the alignment, and any tips here would be most appreciated.  </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Have you tried not using all caps? Try using a friendly strong traditional font with a high x height. And if you can find one with an expressive y all the better :)

I don't like any of them.

The play from the logo-ized d and the shapely squirrel silhouette is dynamic. The all cap line underneath looks just like that - a line / blurr.
