<p>Allow a designer/user to take a PDF with your fonts embedded to a service bureau without requiring that bureau to have purchased a license- great for corporations but bad small guys&hellip; who actually follows that- Vodacom?</p>
<p>Lifetime version upgrades make consumers feel good too- add that.</p>
<p>And generally the Eula is very clear but its too long. Simplify.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge fan of your company&rsquo;s work- I&rsquo;m totally jealous of your loaded clients that get to commission exquisite custom type from you guys</p>
<p>All my best,</p>

<p>Allow embedding. At the very least allow non-editable PDF embedding, and if you aren’t going to allow web (Flash) embedding, make it easy for customers to purchase a license for web embedding without having to negotiate terms. This will be good for your business as SIFR catches on, and especially good when the W3C and Microsoft get web embedded fonts worked out and cross-browser web embedding is a reality.</p>
<p>Allow alterations for internal use, provided that the font is not embedded.</p>

<p>Fonts are a valuable asset in the toolbox of every designer and form an integral part of publishing, design and branding. It takes great design skill, experience and technical expertise to design and engineer a font which will perform across different environments. At Dalton Maag we carefully consider every curve, every serif; we consider the positioning of accents and superior numerals. But designing a font is an ongoing process; once a standard character set is published, we begin to plan expansion to other languages, or possibly more styles. We know the same is true for many of our colleagues in the font industry. This effort needs to be financed and protected to avoid unwitting or unscrupulous font piracy. It is why each commercial font has a legal contract, called an End User Licence Agreement (EULA), attached.</p>
<p>A little education goes a long way.</p>

<p>But does the EULA REALLY need to be in legalese? Will courts not uphold contracts if they are written in plain language? (And don&rsquo;t ask our friend Uli&hellip;)</p>

<p>That’s like asking if a Greek font really needs to be in the Latin alphabet, or if it can all just be replaced with Cyrillic glyphs. A EULA is—theoretically—a legally binding agreement and thus should be written in the style of a legal document.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The legalese language EULAs are written is in fact one of my concerns. I don&rsquo;t understand half of it either.</p>
<p>It is my aim to have the EULA worded as simply as possible. If we can&rsquo;t do that - because of the legality of it - we intend to have a translation set up. However, this, again, needs to be approved by a lawyer and could (probably) not be considered legally binding so as not to contradict the EULA in the first place.</p>
<p>The process of buying a font is intrinsically linked with the EULA. It&rsquo;s always stumped me why font buying, particularly in the domain of multiuser licenses and corporate environements has to be such an aruous process. With the EULA we also aim to hopefully achieve very simple proceedures for multi users and all sorts of other things. We have written up a list of what we feel we need to cover. I am not going to publish this list here, though, since I do not want to prejudice your thoughts.</p>
<p>Tiffany, did not Adobe recently update its EULAs? From what I understand they have now stopped allowing people making modifications to fonts. I will have to read through it, though.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I don&rsquo;t believe there is any actual requirement that a legal contract be in &ldquo;legalese&rdquo; so long as everything is absolutely clear. But lawyers and judges understand legalese and it probably makes them wary or uncomfortable when something is in plain [your language of choice]. That said, there is mumbo-jumbo legalese than only a lawyer can understand, and concise legalese that someone of average intelligence but lacking legal training can more or less figure out. It&rsquo;s the latter that would be preferred in an EULA.</p>
<p>An EULA needs to take into account the reality of the publishing world, otherwise it will simply be ignored. These  days a font is fairly useless if it can&rsquo;t be embedded in a pdf, and of course one-time users such as a service bureau or printer should not be expected to have a licence for a font unless they are actually using it in-house for purposes other than simply outputting a client&rsquo;s file. And of course the holder of an EULA should have the right to sell or give away a font licence they have purchased, provide they don&rsquo;t keep a copy and the recipient agrees to abide by the EULA.</p>

<p>An IOU on a cocktail napkin can be a legally binding agreement.</p>
<p>There is no rule that says &lsquo;it&rsquo;s a legal document, therefor, obfuscate it as much as you can with inane legal jargon&rsquo;.</p>
<p>But, if one must, at least include the &lsquo;plain english bullet-point&rsquo; summary with it.</p>

His only addition to it was a &ldquo;limit of liability&rdquo; statement: &ldquo;If, after we have worked to resolve any technical issues, you are still not satisfied with our product, we will be pleased to refund your money, which shall be the limit of our liability in this transaction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The EULA is as clear as day, and as binding as rope. As the majority of our sales are outside of North America, we feel it is very important that our EULA be comprehensible to those for whom English is a second, third, fourth, or twentieth language.</p>
<p>Tiffany is an authority on, and collector of, EULAs, and her thoughts on this matter are always insightful.</p>
<p>*The EULA was originally written for Thirstype circa 2001, and was later implemented for Village, and several of our member foundries. Of our 11 members, 7 of them use our plain English EULA: KLIM, Kontour, Lux Typographics, Schwartzco, Thirstype, Type Initiative, and Village. Other foundries have asked us if they may use our EULA as a template for their own, and the answer is always a resounding &ldquo;yes!&rdquo; Unlike other EULAs, ours is not protected by copyright.</p>

<p>Chester&rsquo;s EULA, which I forgot to mention, really is one of the best out there because of the fact that it is understandable without a dictionary. If you, Bruno, can get your lawyer to look over Village&rsquo;s that would be good as well.</p>

<p>Restricting the number of backups is nutty, and benefits no one.</p>
<p>I think allowing embedding is essential, and allowing modification is very nearly essential.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not as concerned with the language of the EULA, although plain language is always preferred.</p>
<p>Chester&rsquo;s EULA is great, just great.</p>
<p>Concerning Adobe&rsquo;s EULA, there&rsquo;s been much discussion around here about what sort of mods it allows, but Adobe&rsquo;s font FAQ is pretty clear (I quote from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this pdf<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which I found on their site today, so I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s current:</p>
<p>&ldquo;11. Can I customize a font using font manipulation software?
You are allowed to use font manipulation software to modify the font software to produce “derivatives” of fonts licensed from Adobe, as long as you use the derivatives in accordance with the same licensing terms that accompany the original fonts. For example, you can use Macromedia Fontographer or Pyrus FontLab to customize an Adobe Font for individual usage, but you are not permitted to distribute, sell, or give away, the derivative work, and the derivative work counts as one of the permitted number of uses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I recall, Thomas Phinney says that the FAQ was written by the same team that wrote the EULA.</p>

<p>Oh, and:
&ldquo;For example, you can use Macromedia Fontographer or Pyrus FontLab to customize an Adobe Font for individual usage&hellip;&rdquo;
Surely this whole EULA is now null and void since there is no such thing as Macromedia Fontographer? (I jest.)</p>

<p>That would appear to rule out corporate modifications, as only individual usage may be customized. Or does &ldquo;individual&rdquo; mean an individual licencee, e.g. the corporation? It would also appear to rule out hiring a third party to do modifications, as they would be selling derivative work &ndash; unless they did the work on their client&rsquo;s premises. Not quite as clear as Thirstype:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->You may not commission a third party to modify the fonts without first gaining permission from the designer through Thirstype.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>or Shinntype:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&hellip;you may not distribute, or transfer your adaptations without written permission from the Shinn Type Foundry; this means (a) you may not make customized versions of the Fonts for use by your clients&hellip;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The similar passage in Bruno&rsquo;s EULA:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->You are permitted to produce a Derivative Work of this Font Software solely for your own use&hellip;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>That seems to be like Adobe&rsquo;s, in that there is some &ldquo;wiggle room&rdquo; for a corporation to interpret that they can hire a third party to do a modification for them.</p>

<p>You know I have to disagree, a sensible person would read the FAQ and ignore the EULA - the two documents contradict each other on modification.  The FAQ is definitely more liberal. By the way I’m not a lawyer so do not take this as legal advice :-)</p>
<p>On the subject of the DM EULA - the 5 devices + one printer restriction (drawn from the Adobe EULA of yester-year), is so far removed from today&rsquo;s world of laptops, networks, wireless, printers (surely by connecting to the internet you&rsquo;re conected to millions of printers?), devices, PDAs, flash memory, smartphones, virtualization, backups, time-machine, server based font management etc., that it should be thrown out and replaced with a per-user/server model (IMHO).</p>

Perhaps linking this to a &ldquo;modification approval request form&rdquo; that a customer could fill out – would give the vendor enough detail to say yes or no, without a whole bunch of to-and-fro email.</div>

<p>But in court, I&rsquo;d hate to have to resort to citing the FAQ that was current when I did the modifications, or bought the licence for the font.</p>
<p>EDIT: My point is simply that Adobe&rsquo;s way of doing things isn&rsquo;t very satisfactory <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in principle<!-- raw HTML omitted --> – though in practice, it might be the best that a big, corporate foundry can do. I do appreciate the fact they at least don&rsquo;t clearly prohibit modifications.</p>
<p>The problem with having to ask for a permission to do modifications is precisely that it entails the possibility of being turned down. John&rsquo;s experience confirms my fears, showing that being knowledgeable about type won&rsquo;t guarantee you getting a permission, nor will even wanting to do just practical changes intended to simplify your work (as opposed to changing outlines, though I&rsquo;d like to be able to do that too).</p>
<p>I find that every font needs modifications, and I guess I&rsquo;d have to ask for a permission <!-- raw HTML omitted -->before<!-- raw HTML omitted --> even buying a licence if the EULA says – or seems to say – &ldquo;no modifications&rdquo;.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The modification part is certainly something that we have found a great interest for in the design community. I think the reality is that tools are available to do this work and that users have a desire to tweak a font to better fit their requirements.</p>
<p>The problem is not the user who swaps numeral sets around in the font for their personal usage (the fonts never leaving his desktop) but where modifications are applied and the fonts become part of a grander print job, or even corporate project. At this point I would like to have control over what is being done.</p>
<p>I am thinking that Dalton Maag will allow modifications in principle. However, we would like to be notified of such an intent and have first refusal to do the work. Where it is a simple job that is solely for the purpose of personal use, we probably would not want to be involved as we could not justify the cost of doing this. However, where the project is more of a commercial nature, where the fonts are being distributed afterwards we probably would want to do the work ourselves for the following reasons:</p>

<p>Quality control: As the copyright notice and parts of the font name may remain as per original, it is possible that we may be called to provide tech support for a product we have not created. By insisting of either doing the work in-house, or at least have a quality testing, we can help with support queries and ensure that the client receives a product that matches our standards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Distribution control and license fees: as the modification will be a derivative product, the copyright remains with us and we&rsquo;re entitled to license fees. Being informed and having participated in the work will allow us to negotiate licensing and distribution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recommercialisation: some modifications, such as language extensions or typographic features may be of interest to us. We would potentially want to integrate these into our own library and recommercialise them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not to make the process more complicated but to ensure that everyone is compensated fairly and that the client receives the best possible quality.</p>

<p>I fully agree with you. My continuing education on the subject cements my belief that &ldquo;the EULA&rdquo; actually represents a spectrum of EULAs over time, and a rank of EULAs for the customer base at any given time. The overriding goal of course, being to provide with the software, an agreement that is understandable and workable for the legal user of any language. So, in order to do this, a bidirectional education, like this thread, or any one of the hundreds of conversations we have with clients, is part of that tool.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">@ John Nolan: We can’t recall neither at FontShop International in Berlin nor in San Francisco that we have turned down such a request like yours. We want to be asked for permission of modifications, mainly to respect our designers and to keep track of modified FontFont versions. Dependent on the character and purpose of the requested modification we decide individually whether we or the type designer or our font technicians do the modification or if we just allow the customer to do it. It’s also a support problem – we can only give technial support for fonts we have produced.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I should have been more specific:</p>
<p>I was not granted permission to modify the font <em>myself</em>.</p>
<p>I did not pursue to its conclusion the option of having FontShop do the work, because I felt the cost would be too high, and the process too time consuming&hellip;I never got a real quote, but I vaguely remember getting the impression it would be about $25 per character.</p>
<p>Further, I was asked which character slot I would like the f ligs placed in, in spite of the fact that I had stated that the modication I wanted to make was in order to have the ligs  available to InDesign. This indicated that the particular need I was hoping to address was not understood by the questioner, so I didn&rsquo;t have confidence that the work would be done correctly. I could have done it myself in 20 minutes, including adding new kerns. Life&rsquo;s too short.</p>
<p>My initial request for permission was dated July 14, 2005.</p>
<p>Here are some excepts from <em>some</em> of the  emails I got from Danny Dawson in 2005:</p>
<p>Aug. 5, 05:
&ldquo;This all means that you are effectively prohibited from making the changes yourself. There may be situations I am not aware of where you would be granted permission to make the changes yourself, but those situations are not mentioned in the packet I was given.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In August 9, 05 Danny said:
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite have answers for you yet, but I am still looking into (1) costs for the modifications you&rsquo;ve inquired about and (2) further EULA language clarification. Unfortunately, international communication moves at its own pace, and this is further complicated by the legal complexities of the subject matter, so I do apologize that my responses aren&rsquo;t more prompt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aug. 23, 05:
&ldquo;As for clarifying our current EULA, I am <em>still</em> waiting for an enumerated list of things you are allowed to do on your own without paying FontShop for customizations. I&rsquo;ll let you know when I hear more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&hellip;the thread ends here, probably because I told Danny I was no longer interested. I also spoke to Danny on the phone about all this. I don&rsquo;t remember exactly when I told Danny &ldquo;I give up.&rdquo;</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the recap, John – with this info I was able to find emails regarding this particular issue after all and see that communication within our company was lacking. A rather unfortunate instance which I think/hope is rare. In Summer 2005, we had just changed our EULA to make it more userfriendly in general (eg use of laptops, embedding, service bureaus) though we did make a point about not allowing modification per se, for the reasons I gave above. As I said, in general we try to meet our customers’ needs, and in a timely manner. So do not give up on us ;-)</div>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->You know I have to disagree, a sensible person would read the FAQ and ignore the EULA<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I was saying that. I was simply saying if someone really wanted to know the information is there. Trust me, I&rsquo;ve read that EULA a few times now and it still takes patience. In fact, ALL EULAs written by a lawyer for other lawyers take time to read. I think the FAQ is a good way to cut to the chase, but in a court of law the EULA would be what is referred to and not the FAQ.</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->What if Adobe suddenly changes the FAQ, saying that no modifications are allowed?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>It is illegal to do that. The fonts you licensed remain powered by the EULA under which you licensed them.</p>
<p>Although this is a conundrum because some EULAs, as DAMA&rsquo;s, are being improved. Do those who licensed before need to contact the foundries to upgrade their EULAs?</p>
<p>Edit: I see that you said basically what I was saying. A court of law would use the FAQ as part of the case, but don&rsquo;t you think the EULA would bind? I suppose it depends upon what is being tried.</p>

<p>Actually Tiffany I don&rsquo;t think this is true. I believe there is something in contract law that allows the changing of the EULA to affect previous licensing that occurred under different EULA terms. But I am not a lawyer so don&rsquo;t quote me.</p>

<p>Such &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so&rdquo; arguments are not of much use.</p>
<p>I repeat here what I said in another thread:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->My recommendation for the American Typophile website is that they badly need an independent American design law and copyright law expert, who is not affiliated with a certain font company, for answering legal questions, because there seems to be much need among Typophilers for reliable legal information in these matters.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Experts such as Mr. Frank Martinez will not do, for he is affiliated with certain font companies and hence will only supply biased information in favor of his clients. What is needed is an independent expert, who also takes care of the &ldquo;end users&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I think, in a country of the size of the USA, it should be possible to find an independant professor of law who is willing to supply independent answers on questions like those discussed in this thread.</p>

<p>I agree with this completely. You can learn a lot about a foundry by their EULA. Of course, some of what you might learn is based upon assumptions, but it is still interesting to read it in that way. In many instances you can ascertain how much value, for instance, a foundry considers their fonts to be adding to any given user.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m editing this thread - so it will fall out of order (grrrr) and make Tiffany&rsquo;s comment seem strange.</p>
<p>A few EULA requests:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Allow embedding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow transferring. If I have no use for a font after a job is done I&rsquo;d be happy to turn the license over to the client along with the font.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow the font to accompany the job to the printer without requiring the printer to purchase an additional license.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow making a backup copy for archiving purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make the license per user, not per machine.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It is my belief (as stated in other threads) that absent any ability to effectively police users, overly restrictive and/or wordy EULAs encourage violation, or encourage designers not to buy fonts. I don&rsquo;t read most EULAs word for word, but I don&rsquo;t resell or give away fonts either. I just use them to get my work done. It ought to be that simple.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think Patty&rsquo;s requests are reasonable. Especially points 1, 2, 4, and 5. I&rsquo;d imagine the fact that Patty does a lot of publishing work gives weight to her wishing to send the fonts to the printers. Printers who do books don&rsquo;t want PDFs. The printers that I work with for a client for whom I design books said point blank no PDFs. So, I had to get everyone on the same page and licensing some fonts. It was like pulling teeth, but in the end it worked out. (My nightmare would be that this was a lie.)</p>
<p>The fact is that PDFs are how most presses work now. As long as the designer can set up a decent PDF there is little to no reason why the fonts have to leave the designer&rsquo;s computer anymore.</p>

I think that is good and fair. But I don&rsquo;t think someone who has purchased something, a font in this case, should have to deal with a new EULA. If I licensed a font from Widget Foundry specifically because they allow web embedding and they then change their EULA to disallow this I&rsquo;m up a creek without a paddle. SOL. Even if the foundry emailed me to warn me how does that serve the customer? I think changing a EULA is different from changing a website. Hopefully, in both cases, change will be for the positive, but sometimes not so much. I think a EULA should stand and if a customer wants to be able to have their fonts under the new EULA it should be a free choice by the customer and not the foundry.</div>

I think you are not understanding my position. I have to license software to a number of &ldquo;somethings&rdquo;. The software is installed on, and used from machines, not people. My clients have requested that they be asked to count machines, not people. People leave, and they must know that the fonts stay.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve said before, Patty, you can find friends who don&rsquo;t fit, my model, or anyone&rsquo;s model all day long. But the fact is, we have a model that 95% of users, you included, it seems, fit into without legal stress. Beyond that, we have &ldquo;the enterprise&rdquo; license, which means a client doesn&rsquo;t even have to count the machines.</p>

It is easier to count computers when someone has to audit their system, especially in a larger company.

<p>But machines come and go too. If I buy a new printer or an additional computer I&rsquo;m not going to re-license all my fonts. I&rsquo;d prefer a pricing structure that dealt with the number of employees in the studio. Or, at least, the number of CPUs exclusive of printers.</p>

They don&rsquo;t do it &ldquo;on their own&rdquo;, (yet). (-: and we don&rsquo;t count printers. I&rsquo;m not sure how explain it any better, but you don&rsquo;t seem to leave any room for us to do this legally, while complaining that we don&rsquo;t leave you to do things legally. I mean, I can go into any licensee and count the number of computers if I need to. You tell me!? how am I s&rsquo;posed to count people and check a license? how are you going to count people and license correctly? &ldquo;oh, two of my employees left, now I want a cheaper license&rdquo; or even better yet, &ldquo;I just hired two people and I&rsquo;m calling the Font Bureau to pay you more now for the license&rdquo; ??? Buying a new machine and installing fonts on it, is a legal threshold a user goes over completely conciously, it leaves its mark on the machine and makes a site that much more useful. Counting people means we have to listen to all the nonsense imaginable about who actually uses fonts, and quite frankly, that&rsquo;s not any of our business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;HTF has a fee for one device then it’s another $100 per machine, which is untenable for a one-person studio like mine.&rdquo;
If you want to find a difficult group of users to license to, and a difficult foundry to license from, I&rsquo;m sure you can make things really look impossible. . .</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Mr. Berlow makes a very good point.</p>
<p>You could have a studio with 20 designers in it, and your entire library of fonts on all 20 of their machines. But on any given second, only 10 designers are using that particular font. So, you only need to license your 20 machines for 10 users.</p>
<p>Or to make the granularity even finer: Of those 10 designers, only 1 is actually using the Bold Italic weight of the font at any given moment. At this very second, the Bold Italic weight is in several documents being worked on by those 10 designers, but two of them are taking their lunch break, one is retouching a photograph, three are checking their email, one is spell-checking in Word, one is in the bathroom, one is using the Roman Small Caps, and only one is using the Bold Italic font.</p>
<p>So, of the 20 computers in your studio, you really only use any given font on one computer at any given time. So, all you need is a license for one computer.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>But Patty HFJ and Font Bureau caters to large design firms, newspapers, publishing houses, huge corporations, etc. Yes they sell to you and me but its the big guys were they make the most money on licenses. That&rsquo;s why they are so &lsquo;stingy&rsquo; because the big guys have money and will pay it. They should have something for very small offices or one man shows- the 1-5 that most foundries allow. I guess when you are the best, you can demand the best too.</p>
<p>Funny though, at least for HF&amp;J, I think the initial pricing is very good, though maybe not as awesome as Adobe&rsquo;s pricing.</p>
<p>Laptops should be included in 1 license.</p>
<p>PDF&rsquo;s internal or large scale should be included too. Again this fee is for the corporations and it has nothing to do with security either.</p>
<p>Mikey :-)</p>
<p>PS&hellip; A broad naive question: I wonder which model makes more money- expensive and caters to big corps. or affordable and very generous?</p>

		<div class="commentbody">It would be nice if more foundries offered tiered licenses, i.e. for individuals, small businesses (fewer than, say, 15 employees), and larger enterprises. 
15 is probably an arbitrary number, but I think that is where a lot of other special business requirements kick in. But yes, people come and go, and even in a one-person studio equipment gets retired and added. Having to relicense everything because I buy a new computer and put the old one in the closet without erasing the HD would be a thorough pain. It&rsquo;s tough enough transferring the applications that have mechanisms for enforcing their EULA over to the new machine.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I have just come back from an InDesign conferencen in Switzerland. The audience there was mainly made up of people from the printing industry - prepress, printers, data processing, publishing. I noted with interest the absence of design/brand agencies.</p>
<p>However, I realised that we have been focussing our sales and EULA models very much on the design industry. The people I met have quite different needs, particularly when it comes to modification, font/project archiving etc. In regards to modifications, they often only need minor tweaks, such as adding specialist glyphs etc. Whilst we could provide this service, our fees do not make economic sense, or we simply cannot turn it around fast enough. I am now planning to allow modifications on the basis that we are asked permission and retain rights.</p>
<p>Another point that has struck me is that Adobe&rsquo;s InDesign also comes with a server version that will allow copy input via a web terminal. In theory anyone inputting copy will not have to have the font resident. This undermines our revenue and I am certain we can create a EULA that, again expressly benefits both user and font designer/foundry.</p>
<p>I am now full of ideas on this subject and hopefully I will have a draft version of our new EULA ready. In fact, I am inclined not to call it EULA anymore but UGC (User Guidance and Conditions).</p>

<p>Perhaps you should see what every other major foundry is doing with their EULA- Adobe, Monotype, FontShop, URW++, and Linotype. 5 devices per license is the standard.  Exceptions are DTL, Enshede, Font Bureau and HF&amp;J. These companies cater to the upper echelon of the market where a typical invoice carries the price tag of library of type elsewhere. Corporate users need your services. And we love looking at their newspapers and magazines. But buying Novia is not buying Photoshop and its certainly not metal type either, especially since software is the highest profit margin product every in history. If I have a laptop do I really want to call you people up and say &ldquo;please charge me double now&rdquo;? With endusers there will always be question mark when contemplating a purchase from your company (and the others) because of this- honest users anyway.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I have thought about licensing fonts on a per user basis, rather than workstation. But at the moment I cannot get it clear in my head how I would solve the conundrum of maintaining someone&rsquo;s account who has fluctuating needs. The administrative effort required would gobble up all revenue the font sales make. In order to make any money at all on font sales it has to be automated, online with Credit Card payment. I cannot afford to start creating individual, user driven specific licenses.</p>
<p>Patty, David B&rsquo;s response may have sounded somewhat harsh, but he has a point. We, too, are trying to make a living. And considering that an average OpenType font today costs in the region of UK£30 (approx US$60) with many of them offering fantastic functionality, I don&rsquo;t think that it is expensive. Remember that you can use this font over and over, paying only once.</p>
<p>Unless we can create some online models that monitor the use of the fonts on any users machine, there is no way to charge on a per use/time basis. I wish there would be functionality for having the fonts being loaded into a users cache and that every time you hit the keyboard with that font you pay a fee, accumulating in your account. Based on the number of keystrokes, or seconds used, you will receive an invoice. A little bit like phone usage. Unfortunately, there is no such system in place.</p>
<p>Citing Adobe, when it comes to font pricing, is probably one of the worst examples possible. Adobe make great fonts, but fonts is not their business. Software programs are. Fonts merely serve as value added extras. For the likes of Fontbureau and ourselves fonts are our daily bread. If you use the my font without paying, I can&rsquo;t buy my son a Xmas present. It&rsquo;s as simple as that.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that many of the smaller foundries price on exclusivity rather than quantity. The big font retailers make their money through selling quantity.</p>
<p>In this pricing debate it is interesting to note how people moan how expensive fonts are. They are not! They cost considerably less than an iPhone and gives you far more satisfaction and longevity. You can also earn money from investing in fonts. Remember that without fonts you cannot do design.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I am not bemoaning the prices (except perhaps DTL!) I just believe the EULAs should be in line with how people use fonts. I recognize that my needs and finances are very different than, say, a design firm doing an identity for a bank. I consider fonts a necessary work expense and I don&rsquo;t share them. I am also very appreciative of the hard work that goes into making a font. But I do resent being asked to pay an extra fee in order to embed a font into a pdf (which is an essential part of workflow) or to install the same font on my laptop as well as my desktop computer.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Patty, I understand your latest comments, and actually agree with them. As far as I am concerned I don&rsquo;t really care on what device you use my font, just as long as you&rsquo;re licensed within the number you specified at point of purchase. I also don&rsquo;t give a monkey&rsquo;s in what geographic location the font is, because I recognise that offices have different locations. As for me, you can put your office on the moon and use my fonts there.</p>
<p>Embedding into PDF is definitely an issue and we will give this. However, we&rsquo;re presently debating what usage right to give - Print&amp;Preview or Editable Embedding. I appreciate that from a work flow point of view Editable is desiered. However, at this point you go beyond the basic function of reading and printing and actually add a functionality to the document that is not possible without the font. Should this not be paid for??</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Interesting you should mention archiving. This is something we may actually include in the EULA - the permission to pack a font with a project for archive purposes. That would ensure that when the project is picked up again the correct version of fonts are available.</p>
<p>Yes font sales/usage very much depend on trust. App developers have more protection as they can add serial numbers to their products. In theory that is possible, too, with fonts but none of the OSs have any mechanisms to recognise such management mechanisms. And who wants to go through a lengthy install and registration proceedure every time they want to use a font.</p>
<p>The technologies exist to make font usage far more efficient for both user and vendor. But none of the system, app and browser developers give font management (and its associated digital rights management) any thought. To them fonts are plankton. Available in abundance and worth nothing.</p>

<p>You complain that font prices are too high for you to make a living, (you want us to design, produce, manufacture, license and support a product for $8.00 per machine before royalties), but then you expose yourself to career-crushing litigation to save your clients $40-$80.

<p>Oh blow me. In fact you do have to trust me. Because I doubt it&rsquo;s worth your while to go after every designer who may or may not have embedded your precious fonts in a pdf.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>This area of uses of fonts by printers seems to be one of disconnect between some responsible designers and pretty much all foundries, with the exception of Village. And even their EULA says &ldquo;if absolutely necessary&rdquo; so it&rsquo;s a reluctant permission.</p>
<p>Would it be possible for there to be a special &ldquo;printer&rsquo;s license&rdquo; which allows printers to use a font for manufacturing only, for clients of the printers who also have licenses? That way foundries would keep legal control over the font, but the printers could buy&ndash;or have bought for them in their name&ndash;a cheaper license for manufacturing purposes only. Does that make any sense?</p>

As I understand it, the fonts are not installed on the licensee&rsquo;s website, but on the InDesign server(s) &ndash; a third party, as it were, avoiding the problem of direct exposure of the fonts on the internet.

<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s in English. In American it has the rude meaning. As they are the same words, they can be easily be confused or fused, which is I suspect what happened with Patty&rsquo;s usage.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Getting back to the issue of font licensing and devices. I have a question in regards to printers, for instance, I can currently print to 3 different printers in the office. All are laser, one does black only, one is a proofing system that is capable of doing paper and film (who does that in-house anymore?) and one is a new everyday colour printer.</p>
<p>Do I need an additional license because I print to 3 different machines?</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>In regards to what I&rsquo;d like to see in EULA&rsquo;s is addressing the issue of multiple machines for one user. At home I currently only have my G4, but would like to at some point get a laptop to use while traveling. I&rsquo;d like access to some fonts across both machines. Adobe currently lets you do this with their software, as far as I know, and I&rsquo;d like to be portable with my work if I want to take something with me while on vacation, but otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t be my main work machine.</p>
<p>I strongly side on the ability to archive fonts with jobs. I like packaging jobs up through InDesign once their done and have everything together so I&rsquo;m not digging around my hard drive later on looking for a font. I&rsquo;m not sending native files off to the printer, I just want it for organization.</p>
<p>Like patty, The only thing that goes out to printers these days are PDF&rsquo;s. There&rsquo;s too much room for conflict with software versions to send native files. I found this out the hard way when a print shop was opening files in an older version, ignoring the warning and output a proof that came back in a huge mess.</p>

<p>One thing to consider, and consider again, and never stop considering, is that every foundry is allowed to decide the value of their fonts and every designer is allowed to license or not license. Same goes for designers, we have to decide the value of our product and we charge accordingly. For instance, some designers would work for $65 and hour and others won&rsquo;t get out of bed for less than $250.</p>
<p>I think it all comes down to one simple fact. Every foundry has a different business model. Some of those models have mutated over the years because they haven&rsquo;t quite found their own niche, while others found it and have stuck with it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love for all foundries to allow print &amp; preview embedding that would include sending proofs to clients and final files to the printer, but the simple fact is that not all do this. However, many of the big boys do this now and I&rsquo;m excited about it. But, being able to send the fonts to the printer is more unique and I don&rsquo;t know if the majority will ever allow this. But, I understand that in the publishing world sending native files is necessary so the problem remains. I&rsquo;ve had to settle for simply not using fonts which the printer doesn&rsquo;t have or using fonts from foundries which allow it.</p>
<p>This thread was begun to ask our opinions and suggestions, but I think it has gone a bit beyond that. ;^) If we can all just keep in mind that it is ok for us to not agree and also ok for us to completely disagree without taking things to a personal and/or insulting level it would be super.</p>
<p>There is no way that one EULA would ever work for every foundry and equally no way there is one price that would work for every foundry&hellip;nor is there one price and-or EULA that would please all designers and industries.</p>
<p>If there is one reason why it is good that there are soooooo many similar fonts is that you can usually find something similar with a EULA you can tolerate* as well.</p>
<p>*Tolerate being absolutely subjective.</p>

<p>If you are going to follow EULAs to the letter you will have to upgrade some of your licenses. This is actually one thing I really do wish foundries might start considering. Output devices really start to get mucky because if you want to think about it too much so many things in the office can be considered an output device. I wish it could be either user and or workstation and then anything in the office that can be output to, from the given user and-or workstation is not counted against us.</p>

<p>Agreed&hellip;but still we try. There is a class we call, &ldquo;Preferred Designers&rdquo; and they are trusted to have the whole FB library. We work out solutions to their changing range of problems and sometimes the result gets into the EULA, sometimes it gets into a contract, and sometimes we just shake hands so we can see what happens &ldquo;next&rdquo; without any &ldquo;or else&rdquo; clauses.</p>
<p>All&rsquo;s else I can say is that I never say anything here I would not say to a person&rsquo;s face. That&rsquo;s the line <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I<!-- raw HTML omitted --> draw.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
