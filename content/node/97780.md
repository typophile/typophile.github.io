body: "The inconsistent diacritics may have been lettered in afterwards, but the rest
  looks inkspread-typey enough, though not very 1950s in style. Any suggestions? This
  is from the 1950s Swedish children's book <em>Petter och hans fyra getter</em>.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/4getterlil_5294.jpg]"

  body: It's likely a metal typeface that has not been digitized. <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/erbar/?refby=typographica">Erbar</a>
    and <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/tempo-rr/?refby=typographica">Tempo</a>
    are also similar. Unfortunately, neither of those interpretations are very good.

    width=\"412\" height=\"640\" alt=\"a guide 26\"></a>\r\n\r\nFrom a 1946 guide
    to lettering. Remarkable match. The <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/taffeta/sets/72157627723032746/\">rest
    of the book</a> has pretty close lettered renditions of other typefaces so it
    must be something that was around at the time."

  body: That would be Vogue, an Intertype face originally made in 1930 for <em>Vogue</em>
    magazine. <a href="http://www.terminaldesign.com/Fonts/#/VFSans">VF Sans</a> has
    a lot things in common with it, but I don't think there is a digital version of
    Vogue per se.

    at one time.

  body: Sounds like a fair idea what with the current market towards weird-looking
    geometrics. Would it make sense to iron out some of the "errors", or would it
    better serve the reigning fashion to leave them as is? :)
