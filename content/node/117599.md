  and James Franco? Not the font used in the logo for the film, but for all the other
  text. Here's a link: \r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnalZzJ-XS4&feature=youtu.be&t=51s\r\nI
  first thought it was Tank, but that's a little too condensed.\r\nAny help would
  be greatly appreciated. Thanks!\r\nJeff"

    was set to begin playing right at the cue point of the text I was looking for,
    but you're right -- a screen capture would be better."
