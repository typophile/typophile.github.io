  <BR>I&#39;m new at this, so I apologize in advance if this &#40;reactivating a post
  from the archives&#41; is wrong. I was reading through your &#40;really big&#41;
  archive and I was able to put 2&amp;2 together.  <BR>The font used in the &#39;I,
  Robot&#39; credits is <a href="http://thirstype.com/fonts.php?font=Infinity">Infinity</a>
  by Thirstype. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/47776.gif"
  alt=""> <BR>It&#39;s my first id-ed font. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: I think this must have been a slightly modified Infinity, though because the
    &#34;O&#34;s in the credits were round and the O&#39;s in Infinity are squared.

  body: Everytime I use Infinty I must custom something... Specially the &#34;t&#34;...
    just can&#39;t look at that glyph.
