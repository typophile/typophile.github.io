  been all over the web, but I don't think it has cropped up here yet -- & it strikes
  me as something of interest for here. Go watch it on Youtube before it gets removed:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=A7B73F310275C05E\r\n\r\n"

    found. As you know the BBC doesn't give it up for free for non UK residents:\r\n\r\nhttp://ie.youtube.com/watch?v=SdD3DIa3adQ\r\n\r\nEnjoy!"
