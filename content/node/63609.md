body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI my tests I've found that if you try to generate a non 'style-linked'
  family and therefore you do not check 'Font is Bold' checkboxs, then in Corel 12
  (running in a PC) no Bold, SemiBold or Black version will show up in the font menu.\r\n\r\nThe
  only way to see them  in Corel's menu is by marking them as 'bold' in the checkbox
  (which is indeed not recommended by Karsten L\xFCcke in his paper (http://www.kltf.de/downloads/FontNaming-kltf.pdf)\r\n\r\nWould
  I do any harm if I use the checkbox 'Font is Bold'  while making a non 'style-linked'
  family?\r\n\r\nAny advice?\r\n\r\nRamiro E."

    weight value of 700) in CorelDraw Essentials 3 (version 13, of 2007). All weights
    show up in the menu.\r\n(Don't have CorelDraw 12 for testing though.)\r\n\r\nCould
    you sent me, per font, screenshots of the first two FontInfo pages that contain
    the font names?"

  body: "Well, It sound possible since Corel 12 is older than CorelDraw Essentials
    3. I am at home now, I'll send you the screenshots tomorrow. Thanks for the feedback\r\n\r\nCheers.\r\n\r\nR."

  body: "Hi Karsten,\r\n\r\nI just tested the fonts in Corel X3. In this version non
    style-linked families work fine. It is Corel 12 (and I assume previous versions)
    the one that has problems with them.\r\n\r\nDo you think it would do any harm
    to have the checkbox 'Font is Bold' marked just to gain better compatibility with
    old programs?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nR."
