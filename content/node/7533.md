    <BR> <BR>Speaking of swing states, today my friend in Wisconsin received pre-recorded,

    even they thought. <BR> <BR>However... <BR> <BR>I&#39;m officially conceding my

  body: Yeah, Yves, but this is big for our standards. <BR> <BR>George H.W. Bush got
    over 50% in 1988, but Bill Clinton never even got half of the popular votes cast,
    because both times he was in a three-way race with Ross Perot and a Republican.
    Al Gore won the popular vote in 2000, but he didn&#39;t get over 50% of the votes
    cast then either, due to Ralph Nader taking a few percentage points away. <BR>
    <BR>51% to 48% is a big difference for a presidental US election, and I think
    that W. has actually received more actual single &#34;votes&#34; cast than any
    other president ever &#40;because the US has more citizens now that ever before,
    of course

    elections... And of course the problem can&#39;t be the system, because this is
    God&#39;s Country - the US simply can&#39;t be wrong. So most people who voted
    against Bush will not become angry and forcefully demand change, they will simply
    say &#34;oh, well, I voted so I did my duty&#34; and leave the acceleration of
    the downward spiral to the powers that be. But I believe in cycles, and the sooner
    we hit the bottom the sooner my less distant offspring will enjoy a decent world.

    by opportunists and ignorants by saying &#34;Israel&#34; when I mean &#34;Jewish&#34;.
    Yes, nations do exist, but so do peoples, and sometimes a nation is overwhelming
    the same as a people, overwhelmingly shares the people&#39;s attributes &#40;no,
    we&#39;re not all the same - we just all deserve respect&#41;, for example the
    deep Jewish desire to avenge the Holocaust&#42;. Japan for example has virtually
    no foreign population. So trying to differentiate between &#34;Japan&#34; and
    &#34;Japanese people&#34; is mostly pointless. But seeing problems in the ideology
    of a group of people is not the same as dicriminating against its individuals,
    which I don&#39;t do, and nobody should. <BR> <BR>&#42; That&#39;s where the hubris
    is coming from: it&#39;s an over-reaction to thinking that everybody wants you
    dead. But 95% of people in the world simply want to live in comfort and decency.
    This includes Palestinians. When you take away their most basic rights, you&#39;re
    either hoping to exterminate them, or you have to be ready for them to try to
    kill you. The sooner Jews realize that eveybody on this planet is a person, that
    nobody is &#34;chosen&#34;, that nobody really wants to kill for its own sake,
    then they will come back into the world&#39;s fold again. What they&#39;re doing
    now is acting exactly like the people who formed their contemporary, persecution-syndrome
    view: the Nazis; like father, like son. Advice from one ancient people to another:
    calm down. <BR> <BR>Individuals are not directly responsible for the actions of
    other individuals, but they most certainly should feel responsible for the mindset
    of their society - otherwise you get a bunch of selfish, petty monkeys. Muslim
    Americans for example are partly responsible for improving the lot of both the
    US and Muslim nations. I am responible for three nations. <BR> <BR>&#62; were
    you enslaved and murdered? <BR> <BR>I am Armenian. Our Genocide goes conveniently
    ignored by the likes of the US and -tellingly- Israel. Also, I grew up in Beirut,
    during the war. We had about 260 car bombs. My uncle was assasinated. I guarded
    my school one day a week from 2-4 AM. I was held by the Lebanese Army, after being
    shot at for being in the wrong place. My brother&#39;s car had bullet holes. Two
    guys tried to carjack my father, and failed when he swerved to make them fall
    out the doors. And this is all the tip of the iceberg of my youth experience.
    So I&#39;ve seen -and felt- much more than you, don&#39;t worry. I get my views
    from the ground, not Fox News, al-Jazeera or the Jerusalem Post. <BR> <BR>hhp'

    because of the Holocaust. Most of the population here come from Arab countries
    rather than Eastern Europe and don&#39;t even know what the Holocaust is so there
    goes that theory down the drain. <BR> <BR>Regarding the Armenian Genocide, half
    my staff is Armenian and we live in Israel and we don&#39;t ignore anything. <BR>
    <BR>Regarding the Palestinian people&#39;s right to live. Of course they do. And
    they have the same rights that I do, as a Jew living in Israel and you do living
    in the US. However, they don&#39;t have the right to blow up children at discos,
    or doctors at cafes, etc. Unfortunatly when Arafat &#40;not sure if he is still
    alive at time of writing&#41; sends &#40;sent&#41; out children &#40;yes 15-year-olds&#41;
    to blow up civilians in Jerusalem &#40;which nearly happened today&#41;, then
    the rest of the Palestinian people are going to suffer the consequences. That
    may mean at shopping malls they will get searched more carefully, and it also
    may mean the Israeli soldiers may go through their houses in Jenin in order to
    find the minority of suicide bombers that want to kill us. However, please note
    that the Israeli army will do everything in it&#39;s power not to harm any civilians
    and invariably succeeds which is more than the American Army does &#40;note recent

  body: Okay I think it is at this point in an argument &#40;that really has nothing
    to do with type, typography or typesetting&#41; that I must decline to continue
    this thread. You may interpret this as you will, but frankly your comments are
    not rational and your final comment re the JP clearly show this. <BR> <BR>It has
    been interesting hearing your point of view, but I think perhaps hearing what
    you think about OpenType is perhaps of more interest to members of this forum.

    deleted my lengthy post for the purposes of... not continuing the cycle, I suppose.
    <BR> <BR>Hrant, is there a good &#40;unbiased&#41; resource online for learning
    more about the Armenians? My life and the problems in those areas of the world
    seem to be intersecting more and more as the years continue. <BR> <BR>&#42;Not
    that making racial distinctions is bad, per se, but that making assertions that
    imply the need for uniform violence based on those distinctions is not helpful
    to anyone.

    bothered me, to be specific, is the association of all Jews with the Israeli administration.
    I disagree that the word &#39;Israeli&#39; and &#39;Jew&#39; are interchangeable.
    It&#39;s not generalities that bother me, or racial determinations, it&#39;s the
    discussion. These distinctions drawn about Jews are typically associated with
    violence done to and by some Israelis &#40;many of whom are Jews&#41;, and that
    &#40;to me&#41; calls for great care, even verbally. <BR> <BR>But perhaps I&#39;m
    derailing an already difficult discussion.

    objective look on the topic. <BR> <BR>chris, i agree with you completely, daring
    to derail the discussion, that one has to be more careful mixing up jew and israeli.
    even though i appreciate many of hrants views, it is awful to say that the word
    &#39;Israeli&#39; and &#39;Jew&#39; are interchangeable. this is pure antisemitism,
    because it throws a religious believe into the same pot as a murderous regime.
    israel is pretending to speak for all jews, but all jews never applauded for israel.

  body: Arafat had a peace agreement handed ito him on a silver platter by Bill Clinton
    and Ehud Barack in 2000 at Camp David, yet he turned it down. Why? It contained
    the most provisions Isreal had ever made toward a Palestinan state, yet he was
    unwilling to negotiate. It was he and his supporters who started the second intifada
    in lieu of having peace and independence. Israel is defending themselves, in the
    same way that any European country would do if it came under similar attack. Western
    Europe has grown complacent. As the last members of their war generation die out,
    they seem to forget that they themselves once lived in situations that were less
    than peacefull or idyllic. The US is often accused as being overly supportive
    of Israel. But the EU member states are overly supportive of Palestine. Maybe
    its time for a neutral country &#40;Canada? Japan? Brazil? Anybody?&#41; to step
    in and lead the negotiations.
