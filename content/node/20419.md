  on previous posts that people felt it was an illustrated logo, but wasn't certain.
  Thanks!

  body: Definitely custom + there have been a couple of versions - the latest has
    petit serifs...I also notice that their country-specific websites have started
    using just the logotype (ie without the rectangle/lozenge device) but yellow on
    white which breaks the cardinal heraldic rules of not putting a metal (silver/white)
    next to another metal (gold/yellow). Still, rules are there to break, just don't
    expect success when you photocopy the logo. Anyway, back to your original query,
    Antique Olive Nord may have influenced the IKEA logo a little.

  body: Antique Olive Nord 1963 by Roger Excoffon. IKEA founded 1943 (not sure if
    the logo is that old). Maybe the IKEA logo influenced M. Excoffon...?
