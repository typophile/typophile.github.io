  Rudolf Leuzinger and dates back to 1880. I think the serif face might be Roemisch,
  which would fit, but I'm not sure about the sans serif. Any ideas? \r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Leuzinger1_6167.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Leuzinger2_4906.jpg]"

  body: Is there any reason to believe that the type on the map was created using
    prefabricated letters? To me it looks like hand work.

  body: "No, none at all. That's an interesting point. Would Leuzinger have worked
    from an existing typeface as a guide? My mind leapt to Roemisch because its a
    traditional cartographic typeface and looks similar. I thought the sans might
    be Venus Halbfett. \r\n\r\nIdeally, I'd like to reference the type. Any thoughts?"

    may be the closest digital typeface to the sans letters.
