Below are my rough drafts but I finally think I may have found something that i'm going to run with finally.

If anyone has advice on a better sans font i'm open for ideas, 

My company: I provide top of the line hair extensions for women. The hair is smooth flowing and beautiful, natural looking, crisp.

I want to exude class and simplicity in the logo. Alot of the hair companies out there have alot of swirls and wingdings and I didn't want to go that route. 

tia



1 of the drafts think I am going to go in another direction.

any critique appreciated.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Warning: I can sound blunt and harsh. Don't take it personally.

I'd start over with fresh ideas. Stop trying to depict hair, it's painfully cliche.  A hair salon logo with hair is so literal that it's instantly forgettable. Plus, "hair" is right there in the name of the business, so why illustrate it? 

The font is too fragile -- very wispy and spindly. The hairy smudge looks like it's about to slide down and wipe the letters right off the page. </div>

I'm a woman and women like whimsical when they open packages they like the swoops on the packaging and hang tags. I've done research on this asked my current customers what they like etc. I think the swoop here is subtle because i've seen worse with flourishes all over the place. It may look cheesy but that's the world of hair. 

Thanks for your opinion.

You criticize the font do you have any recommendations? I have looked at so many fonts and they just start to all look the same after a while.</div>

luvtati, I don't mean any offense, but these layouts look amateurish and have numerous problems. It's not just a matter of making a few tweaks; you really need to start fresh as Alaskan said. 

I suggest that you hire a professional graphic designer, not only to design the logo itself but to also help with your printed materials, signage, packaging, etc. Perhaps one of your friends or business associates could recommend someone.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well my competitors logos are in the same range as mine so I guess we are all amateurish but making alot of money. My business is actually very successful, my product speaks for itself. I just need a logo for my upcoming site I don't want the upper corner to have deadspace. My buyers aren't concentrated on my logos and if the tracking is off or the font is a free font, they want quality hair and that's what I have. 

Right now i'm selling making good money without a logo, website and whatever bells and whistles graphic designers think I need. 

My competitors logos:

www.extensions-plus.com
http://www.jujuhair.com/
http://www.halleyscurls.com/8201.html
https://www.indiquehair.com/indique/home.do

Well, designing your own logo is akin to people cutting their own hair. Sure, people own scissors and can actually cut their hair....but the results are most likely hideous. You privately make fun of these fools, don't you? You know how much information/training/skill/education/experience that they just don't have. Their self-haircut will look cheap and sad and....wow, they'll deeply regret cutting their own hair. 

You may scare away the opposite sex/employers for a while, but hair grows back. Meanwhile - yay hats! 

Your cheap and sad logo will scare away potential new customers forever. If you care about the future of your business, hire a graphic designer.</div>

And, just for the record, I'd never order anything off those last two websites (or halleycurls.com) because they look "DIY" amateurish and therefore, probably not secure websites. Those websites look unstable, unreliable, inexperienced and possibly totally unprofessional scammers, actually. The only ones that look like trustworthy businesses are indiquehair.com and extensions-plus.com....and maybe jujuhair.com?

You came here asking for advice from professionals....and we gave it to you. Then, you said you didn't need advice because you knew better. So, can I conclude that you never really wanted advice -- you wanted us to compliment you? If that's true, stick to asking your mother for "advice." </div>

For future reference: saying a mother is likely to compliment their child isn't offensive....among sane people. But, your scary ALL CAPS really convinced me to agree with you. 

Once all your potential clients find your irrational rant here when they search for Anila Hair, you'll understand why it's not wise to post the name of your business on a forum meant for critique and conversation.

No one asked for you to agree.


Yes I called you an idiot, your going back and forth when your comment was inappropriate find another analogy because the one you used was in poor taste!

I posted for critique yes. And for the people who know how to post in a cordial manner, I am taking their advice and re-thinking my design.

You were on the attack from the start. I will not be virtually attacked or have someone say something to me that hits a sensitive spot in my personal life. But an illogical person wouldn't see any wrong in bringing up a person's mother in a poorly executed analogy.

I have alot of customers already my friend, this site won't and can't hurt my following and business try again. I have built my business from the ground, with word of mouth, great service and a quality product. My buyers don't care about my packaging, logo or anything else, they want my product. I am actually quite happy to have built such a brand without the bells and whistles and high costs other hair companies have had to endure.

		<div class="commentbody">Hello. If I may give some feedback in regards to your logo.  I would say the "best" of the bunch you have provided is the 2nd version draft. The black with the subtle beige gradation appears more professional.  The issue I am seeing with the others is that it looks like the word H A R.  The colors also do not look very professional. 

If you are going to go with something more cliche in portraying hair for a hair company, maybe look at the logo of Tresemme. 
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/images_3940.jpeg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/images-1_6290.jpeg]

Your depiction of hair looks more like dripping paint or something along the lines of the "Avril Lavigne" brand.
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/avril-lavigne-girlfriend-lyrics_4226.jpg]

 You said :

"My company: I provide top of the line hair extensions for women. The hair is smooth flowing and beautiful, natural looking, crisp."

I would do some research beyond your competitors and I would look at more high end hair companies and even non hair companies.  A lot of their logos are black or dark and seem elegant, classy and timeless. The examples provided seem like something you could get at "Claires" or any other type of store of that sort.

How you take someone bringing up your mother is entirely different than how someone else might take it. Telling someone it isn't supposed to be offensive does not make it so. You took this from a critique to something very personal for Luvtati. That is not the intent of this forum. 

It is far too easy to say things off the cuff when we're online. I've done it myself. Please consider your words more carefully. It is one thing for us to suggest that Tatiana needs to hire a professional and have her decide to not take our advice. That is just business. But we aren't here to belittle or berate or, as it has happened, touch on a tender topic for someone.
