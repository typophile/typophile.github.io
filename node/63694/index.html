  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi everyone. I admit that I have been trolling these forums for quite some time but am only just now starting to act less like a voyeur and actually tap some of the amazing minds for a bit of help.</p>
<p>I need a font that compliments Helvetica Neue Light. Stop rolling your eyes. I know that the having the entire font family should suit all my needs, but I am leaning towards incorporating another. Humor me.</p>
<p>About the project:</p>
<p>I am currently doing an annual report for the Dept. of Health and have been given creative freedom with the only stipulation being that I keep the Helvetica Neue theme determined by the previous designer.</p>
<p>In the past, the reports have been a bit&hellip; drab. Oh really, you ask? Well, yes.</p>
<p>It is a lot of text written by civil servants with no advertising background. This year we are going green (and trying to appear budget conscious) so we are only passing out CDs with PDFs as opposed to printing. I am going with a lot of rather bright colors- probably only because I secretly get a kick out of showing mortality rates in a bright purple or turquoise. Essentially, I am just looking to make it a bit more appealing albeit that with the time constraints and the amount of information, it is a bit like pouring syrup on cat litter and calling it pancakes.</p>
<p>In summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>a lot of boring text (about 300 pages)</li>
<li>must incorporate helvetica neue; should I use it for large headers with another typeface for the body, or use it for the large body of text and reserve the headers for an accent font?</li>
<li>trying to make it a bit more energetic so am indecisive on referring back to the classic modern serif for the body.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Much thanks to both of you.</p>
<p>Dannis- I really agree with you that Hoefler looks really great with Helvetica.</p>
<p>Thomas- Unfortunately, keeping with the Helvetica is a requirement.</p>
<p>So I propose a few options that perhaps you and anyone else could give me some feedback on:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Yes, I assume most people will be reading this on screen, and personally, I find a sans body font to be easier on the eye when starring at a monitor. Is that just me? Is a serif better for lots of body text to be viewed on a screen?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The digipak (a nicer cardboard alternative to a jewel CD case I had to sell my soul for in order to get purchasing to agree) has already been designed using Helvetica Neue Thin throughout and sent to the printer. So if I didn&rsquo;t feel a bit stuck with the Helvetica before, I definitely do now.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>On the other hand, considering that this is going to people that most likely don&rsquo;t know/care what a serif is as they still use various shades of Comic Sans in their e-mails, would I be able to get away with something else in the report&hellip; perhaps Whitney HTF light?</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>I am totally pushing it with my textual babble, but this is the last one, I promise. On a somewhat irrelevant note, I have been considering going with a custom size (approx 10.5x9 or so) for best viewing through acrobat. I know a small handful will print this out, so is this a good idea or should I stick with the standard letter size?</li>
</ol>
<p>Once again, thanks for all your help and quick responses.</p>

<p>For headings or even subheads, not a problem. But body text on screen? That&rsquo;s just user hostile. Unless of course, the point is that they don&rsquo;t want anybody to read it.</p>

It&rsquo;s part of the limitations inherent to our craft, and we find ways to shine in spite of them (and occasionally because of them).</p>
<p>Personally, I feel that readability of screen fonts is largely a function of particular size. I think the size is the first thing to consider. Some fonts look good 12px, but not at 13px. The proof is in the proof.</p>
<p>Personally, I don&rsquo;t have a thing against mixing and matching, but I also respect the consistency approach. I would note that many well-designed web publications (nytimes, wsj) mix and match.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d go with Droid serif for good onscreen body text. It&rsquo;s tight lockup and crisp styling are a good stylistic fit IMO (See below) &ndash; I believe the Apache open source license allows you to use it for free, but someone correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong here.</p>
<p>Barring that, Cambria.
Barring that, Georgia.</p>
