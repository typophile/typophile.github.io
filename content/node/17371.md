    from Broadcast: Freelancer News \r\n   \r\n20 'real' tips for working in TV \r\n
    \  \r\n \r\nGetting on in TV is not just about having a great CV and good contacts.
    It is also about blagging, bluffing and bullsh*t, as producer Helen Kristic explains.
    \r\n\r\n1. In public (and particularly in meetings with your chiefs), always exaggerate
    your level of excitement at any new venture or idea suggested.  In private moan
    and whinge to anyone who will listen about absolutely everything \u2013 especially
    how every talent less individual except you seems to be getting promoted to producer,
    production manager, AP\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n2. If you are a man you will probably
    be gay. If not try and appear sexually ambivalent at all times.  This will help
    your career prospects enormously and fast track you to Series or executive producer
    status.  Floral Liberty shirts and Jo Malone cologne are a good investment.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.
    Another point to consider if you are a man - sniffing incessantly and NOT blowing
    your nose is a dead giveaway\u2026of being straight.  Keep a hankie to hand and
    work on the above.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. If you\u2019re lucky enough to have Schedule
    D status, ensure you start your working day with an outrageously expensive grande
    skinny latte from Caf\xE9 Nero, Starbucks or Costa Coffee, which should guarantee
    not being able to make your January 31st tax payment.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. If you\u2019re
    PAYE, go to the nearest supermarket and purchase a microwave meal.  Nuke between
    the hours of 12.30 and 2.30pm to ensure a sickly aroma permeates throughout the
    office causing much discomfort to fellow impoverished colleagues eating lunch
    at their desks. Any dishes containing cream or mince beef release exceptionally
    long lasting sickly odours.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. If you are a woman under the age of
    40 wear rectangular glasses, combats (bare midriff natch) and say 'Fabbbb-uuuu-lous'
    at least 30 times a day.  It doesn\u2019t matter if your tum is a bit out of condition
    \u2013 it HAS to be on show and the more flesh, the better your prospects.\r\n\r\n\r\n7.
    If you are a woman over the age of 40, appear as eccentric as possible.  Regularly
    weave the words 'awesome', \u2018wicked\u2019 and \u2018fly\u2019 into conversation.
    Make sure your clothing would be more suitable on a 25 year old and accessorize
    with a man who is at least ten years younger.  Talk in explicit detail to anyone
    within earshot about the delights of sleeping with a younger man.\r\n\r\n\r\n8.
    When on the phone politely say 'goodbye' to the person on the other end then slam
    it down and shout 'What an absolute Wa**er!'  This of course means he\u2019s perfect
    for the show and without wanting to appear too keen, tensely wait thirty minutes,
    call back and book him.  Prepare to then spend the entire time of your eight week
    production having to be lovely to people you would classify as \u201Cwa**ers\u201D.\r\n\r\n\r\n9.
    Once booked for a show, contributors should thereafter be referred to as \u201Cpunters\u201D.
    \ Never ever EVER end up in a relationship with a punter.  What was Ulrika thinking?\r\n\r\n\r\n10.
    Terminology as illustrated above, is incredibly important if you are to, like
    most of the industry, blag your way through the technical aspects of your television
    career.  It is imperative to use words like deconstruction, textual, pacey and
    narrative.  And most importantly, when discussing programmes, don\u2019t talk
    about how they look or sound, talk about how they FEEL.  If you like something,
    it's never good or nice - it's SEXY.\r\n\r\n\r\n11. Pretend to understand the
    difference between 'Digi' and 'Beta', Off line & On Line, 4:3 and 16:9, jazz and
    shared drives.\r\n\r\n\r\n12. Never miss an opportunity particularly among friends
    who work in the real world.  Every time anyone tells a story or recounts anything
    mildly interesting, hold up your index finger and say \"There could be a programme
    in that!\".\r\n\r\n\r\n13. Adopt a hobby as you will be unemployed most of your
    life.  Forget about a mortgage, pension fund or membership to Soho House.  NB:
    \ Regular use of cocaine is NOT classified as a hobby.\r\n\r\n\r\n14. Get used
    to meeting new people and hating them on sight \u2013 particularly women who can
    afford to buy Mulberry bags and expose their midriff and men with perfect teeth
    who are often heard declaring  \u201Cthere could be a programme in that!\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n15.
    Have ridiculously loud arguments with your production manager on a daily basis
    about money.  This is good therapy for you and it\u2019s always fascinating to
    hear a production manager\u2019s response to why you can\u2019t get a car home
    after studio.\r\n\r\n\r\n16. Ensure that you book a car home after studio and
    don\u2019t tell the production manager. You\u2019ll be long gone and your contract
    finished by the time the invoice arrives.\r\n\r\n\r\n17. With exceptionally difficult
    production managers, you need to sustain your sanity and sense of wellbeing.  This
    can be achieved whenever a request is received for something to be sent, by asking
    if they\u2019d like it biked it over.\r\n\r\n\r\n18. Understand that 'junior researcher',
    'production secretary\u2019, and 'receptionist' are, unfortunately, all the same
    thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n19. Understand that the most important member of staff is the
    runner.  He or she is key to every production as they are the only ones who know
    what the hell is going on.  Treat them with the greatest respect because the way
    television works, you will no doubt be working for them in a years time!\r\n\r\n\r\n20.
    Lastly keep your sense of humour and try not to get cynical.  There\u2019s thousands
    out there that want your job you know\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\nHelen Kristic is an entertainment
    and event producer who aspires to one day, work in reality television and to have
    a weekly column in a national newspaper.  She quite fancies something along the
    lines of a satirical view of television production.  She is an avid fan of to-do
    lists and currently needs to fill in her CV details on this website and put a
    lot of unwanted bits n bobs on ebay.  She loves New York Cheesecake, recycles
    regularly and is currently 8lbs overweight. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n"
