body: Jared or Joe. <BR> <BR>Over the past few months in the critique section, Christian
  Robertson&#39;s Pill Gothic has come up a few times. The original thread seems to
  be missing. Where&#39;d it go? <BR> <BR>If it can&#39;t be found, then can you provide
  a link to the Typophile 50 faces. I think Pill was included. <BR> <BR>Do the sections
  archive automatically, or only the threads? <BR> <BR>Thanks <BR>Randy

  body: In 2002, when our host took us offline we had to archive  <BR>lots of old
    threads offline, or be saddled with fat bandwidth  <BR>bills. Sadly, Pill Gothic
    was a casualty of that. We have good  <BR>intentions of making those archives
    available in the future. <BR> <BR>&#40;The forum software has a built-in &#39;archive&#39;
    feature, which <BR>simply marks posts past a certain age, but all of these will  <BR>still
    be available online. There is material from 2001,  <BR>that I mentioned, that
    is archived offline.&#41; <BR> <BR>As an aside, our current sponsors and your
    membership  <BR>money should prevent us from being in that position again. <BR>
    <BR>You can see Christian&#39;s Origin, Raisin Nut Text and Pill Gothic  <BR>in
    the <a href="http://www.typophile.com/gallery/">Typophile Fifty Gallery</a>. His
    are some of the first in there.
