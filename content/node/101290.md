  class.  It is something I am really enjoying.\r\nAs part of my class, I was assigned
  a typeface to study and do research on and present as my final project.  The face
  I was given is \"Filosophia.\"  It is a beautiful one and I know it was developed
  by Zuzana Licko of Emigre Fonts in the 1990's.  I also know that it was inspired
  by the classic \"Bodoni.\"  Outside of that, I have found very little information
  on Filosphia itself.  \r\n\r\nDoes anyone know of any books that include information
  about it or its history?  Are there any groups, or communities dedicated to Filosophia?
  \ How about any valid websites?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for the help!"

    - it's Filosofia! ;-)

  body: "Get a hold of the old issue of Emigre magazine where it was premiered. (BTW,
    I happen to have a letter-to-the editor about the font in a subsequent issue,
    but I forget the issue number, and it's too deep in the garage to bother looking
    for. :-)\r\n\r\nOne thing I've heard about Filosofia (correct spelling) is that
    Licko offered it to some large OEM font supplier (it was either Bitstream or Monotype)
    for inclusion in a future version of Windows, but was turned down. But that could
    just be a rumor, so you'd need to do the research... and hope the right people
    tell you the truth. Maybe now that Licko is retired from type design (?) such
    details -or denials- will flow more freely.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    not heard that story. Just possibly it is a confusion arising from Filosofia being
    the basis for asking Microsoft to register the <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/features_uz.htm#unic\">'Unicase
    Forms'</a> OpenType Layout feature. That was accepted, of course, but support
    for the feature in apps has not followed (it will be available for webfonts with
    CSS3 though)."

  body: I can't remember exactly when we registered the {unic} feature, but my guess
    is around 1998-99. Implementation lag has been a perennial complaint for a lot
    of OpenType Layout features for the past 15 years. In the case of a feature like
    {unic} though, support is less likely than most because, in a traditional desktop
    word processing or page layout app it is the sort of thing that needs UI real
    estate, but there are, what, two typeface families that use it?
