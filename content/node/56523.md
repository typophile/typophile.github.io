  Helvetica Rounded, and it possibly is. HOWEVER, I Can only find Helvetica Rounded
  Bold which seems far to bold and thick. the typeface looks just like it, but it's
  so fat, when in the logo every trace is so nicely thin. Incredibly, I have the same
  problem (only black and bold versions available) for several similar rounded fonts.
  Is there an Helvetica rounded (thin or light) not so fat? where? \r\nIs there any
  good alternative (rounded thin) that looks just like Helvetica?\r\nThanks.\r\nPedro\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_3551.jpg]"
