  body: "Yes... but what are you looking for in particular?\r\n\r\nThat's like saying,
    \"Do you know any recipes from France?\"\r\n\r\nHere's a link to one of many image
    databases that contain visuals of many period posters, ads and publications. \r\n<a
    href=\"http://ahds.ac.uk/visualarts/\" target=\"new\">AHDS Visual Arts</a>\r\n\r\nJust
    type in what you are looking for, and if you find a poster with a face you like
    and can't identify it... post it in the Type ID section.\r\n\r\n"

    would also suggest checking out Tashen's All American Ads book series. They have
    a volume each for the 20s through the 80s. It's a great resource for period styles."

  body: That last example (FEATHERS) is sort of like <a href="http://www.linotype.com/14596/carltonplain-font.html">Carlton</a>,
    a digital revival of Ehmcke Antiqua. Ehmcke Antiqua seems to have been used in
    late Art Nouveau Germany, and then in 1930s England.

    lot of their charm, I think, is that they weren't intended to be a font so the
    letters only had to work with their neighbours and if they didn't they could be
    adjusted.\r\nTim"
