  was wondering if anyone would be able to help me indentify the typeface in this
  badge?\r\n\r\nAny help would be really appreciated, many thanks in advance. \r\n"

    checked Rookledge's International Typefinder -- which covers pre-digital typefaces
    -- and found that the flourished Q was found in several common typefaces including
    ITC Century, Scotch Roman (Monotype), Scotch 2 (Linotype),  Century Nova, Madison,
    Modern No 20, Craw Modern & Albion 42. But all had an R where the leg terminated
    in an uptick. The lettering seems to show an R with a half serif or plain termination.\r\n\r\nBut
    perhaps there is something digital that has both R and Q that match the badge.

    origin of the motto lettering. \r\nA heavy weight of Scotch Roman with an edited
    leg on the R might do the trick.\r\nDon"
