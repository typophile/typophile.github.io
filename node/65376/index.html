  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">TypographyShop is expanding its line into hoodies. We've just released [[http://typographyshop.com/helvetica-unisex-hoodie.html|Helvetica Neue Descending an Eco-Friendly Hoodie]] just in time for the holidays.  We wanted to find a very special hoodie and were happy to find this blend of organic cotton and recycled polyester.  The polyester started life as plastic bottles and even the dye used in the process is low impact.

We've got a new t-shirt up as well: [[http://typographyshop.com/letterpress_mens_t-shirt.html |Letterpress]].  Set in Berthold Akzidenz-Grotesk bold in reverse, a very simple homage to everyone's favorite printing process.  Or at least it seems like it these days. 

We're also proud to have been part of the Typophile film fest in Portland a couple of months back.  We gave away 5 t-shirts to winners of a quiz preceding the films. Thanks to Zara from Typophile for all her help.

In other news, since our inception, TypographyShop has stated that a portion of all our sales would be donated to Design Education Programs. 

We're pleased to announce that the AIGA Education Fund is the first recipient of our donations. The fund supports AIGA's education and scholarship programs which help students, usually from inner cities, who demonstrate talent and are willing to serve a social purpose as well as a personal goal. 

Learn more about the fund [[http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/worldstudio-scholarship|here]].

Happy Holidays
Patrick King
