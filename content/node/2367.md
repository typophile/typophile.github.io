body: Some one has bought a font. Now he tells me you &#34;can not set type&#34; with
  this program. Is that possible? <BR> <BR>Also is there any text controls with the
  program if there is? Or is it strictly visual placement? <BR> <BR>Never heard of
  this program?

    Appleworks is more or less a dumbed-down version of Microsoft Word. Maybe go to
    Apple&#39;s site and check if they have more information.  <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.apple.com/appleworks/"

  body: Providing the font was installed correctly &#40;perhaps see if it appears
    in the font menu of any other program the person has on their computer&#41; it
    will appear in AppleWorks &#40;previously called ClarisWorks, by the way&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>There are basically two ways to set type in AppleWorks. One is using
    the word processor &#40;which, like Tiffany mentions, is similar to Word&#41;
    and the second is within a text block as part of the drawing module. The drawing
    module allows you to scale, stretch, rotate, etc. the block of text &#40;which
    can still be edited, of course.&#41; <BR> <BR>I am guessing that if the person
    cannot &#34;set&#34; the typeface, it&#39;s because it is not installed properly.
    The first thing I would ask them is if the font appears in the AppleWorks font
    menu.

  body: I use the database part of Appleworks 6 on Mac OS 9 for student grades. Darren
    Wilson, who taught the course with me at one time, set up the templates which
    I use for this. It&#39;s great, and I wouldn&#39;t say that an alternative to
    the incredibly bloated Word is dumb, quite the oposite in fact. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve
    never had a problem with being able to set fonts in the database part of Appleworks.
    If a poorly-manufactured student font shows up when double-clicked in ATM, it
    sets in Appleworks.

    something you could share?

  body: OK, <BR> <BR>This is encouraging. Sorry it was late last night and that is
    why you lost me. But your encouragements led the customer to successfully set
    type. <BR> <BR>The problem with this font, <i>cough, cough,</i> the good  thing
    about this font is that it is multi-coloured. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.lanstontype.com/JacobeanInitials.html"
    target="_blank">http://www.lanstontype.com/JacobeanInitials.html</a> <BR> <BR>So
    the fellow needs to be able to set, copy, and then layer the colours on top of
    each other. <BR> <BR>First, can the fellow colour the font? I imagine the answer
    is yes. <BR> <BR>Second question is, can the fellow accurately layer  the fonts
    on top of each other?  Or is  it visual placement only? <BR> <BR>This fellow is
    most brave. It is his first font purchase, and first font installation. Frankly
    I need half a pot of coffee before thinking about working with this <i>user friendly
    font.</i> I just like to be prepared for the beauty of the results. <BR> <BR>Alright,
    it is hard for me to say bad things about a font that does nice things. I think
    you understand. <BR> <BR>Probably I should write a manual for this font. Maybe
    I should spend some time with fringe software. I am so bare bones here. There
    is no toys or nice things for me to work with. <BR> <BR>Keep thinking about boats.
