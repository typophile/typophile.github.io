  need some bizarre numbers and these might just be right. They are bizarre.\r\n\r\nMy
  Font doesn't have a clue and there is not a lot to go from here. It will be a test
  of your knowledge.  \r\n\r\nAny help would be amazing, and any suggestions of other
  fonts with slightly odd, heavy characters would be warmly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nPeter

  body: Most likely, these number date from the early or mid-nineteenth century, and
    may not have been revived. Woodtype as a category would probably be a good starting
    point...
