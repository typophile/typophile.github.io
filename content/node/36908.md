body: Does anyone have any resources to recommend for printing advice? My labels are
  printed in Europe and the US by many different printers. I often have questions
  about setting up the files. I would like to find a forum or book or site related
  to printing that can help me trouble shoot, design and innovate.

  body: that sounds like an odd relationship. why don't you have more interaction
    with your printers? i have never worked with a professional printer that would
    not show me proofs before going to press, whether i'm working with a local printer
    or a firm on the web.

  body: I never know who is printing it overseas in advance. Each winery has different
    vendors and they decide when they get the order which to use. They don't get the
    order until we get the order and we don't get the order until our customer has
    sampled the juice and approved the label design.

  body: "Pretty hard to innovate if you can't have a relationship with the printer,
    look at samples, etc\u2026\r\n\r\nYou will be lucky to just get good color reproduction
    if this is how your workflow progresses - I would attempt to talk to the wineries
    and explain that for the best outcome you need to have a relationship with the
    printer.\r\n\r\nMaybe you could find a great printer for labels and try to steer
    the wineries there.\r\n\r\nBest of Luck!\r\n\r\npbc"
