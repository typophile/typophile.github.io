  body: Fresh take on the stencil. It might be fun to make your white space &#40;the
    breaks&#41; in the characters a little thicker--just to see how much the letter
    can handle it--make it more stencil-like. Reminds me of Margo Chase&#39;s work
    a little. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Kari, <BR> <BR>Your design does not  &#34;suck&#34;. <BR> <BR>If you can,
    please set some text with it. I think  <BR>some characters are too similar to
    each other  <BR>to be legible. <BR> <BR>I like the numbers best of all. <BR> <BR>-smc

  body: Sean, i agree that some letters look similar...have any ideas for my U or
    V?  I know they seem alike, but since I basically cut and pasted all the characters
    from a few parts, I was wondering if I should take a new stand on them.  I had
    a lot of troubles with the B and the D, trying to incorporate the same stem weight
    and bottom look-a-like serif with the break in it. Any ideas?  thanks for the
    feedback. <BR>I enjoy my numbers too! <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    writing it again.] </b> <BR> <BR><i>...since I basically cut and pasted all the  <BR>characters

    taking what you currently  <BR>have, printing it out on paper and tracing over  <BR>the
    letters - to see what kind of solutions you  <BR>come up with regarding what you
    see and  <BR>know as problem areas.  <BR> <BR>The &#34;R&#34; is really good.
    This character is  <BR>unique among the others. Perhaps this idea  <BR>could be
    used on the &#34;N&#34;, &#34;H&#34;, &#34;A&#34;. <BR> <BR>The &#34;T&#34; and
    to a lesser extent the &#34;i&#34; are also  <BR>unique in that they seem to be
    the only glyphs  <BR>to have what could be conventional serifs.  <BR>Maybe these
    characters should change or  <BR>perhaps their characteristics should be  <BR>exploited
    elsewhere. <BR> <BR>The more I look at it the more I like it however,  <BR>keep
    working on it. <BR> <BR>-smc

  body: sean, been busy lately, sorry for responding so late, thanks for the advice,
    i&#39;ll try to incorporate some of your ideas into my font, if i can.  I actually
    thought my R stood out from the rest and didn&#39;t look uniform with the others.  I
    like your idea of incorporating the same concept with other characters, so i&#39;ll
    and give it a shot! Thanks <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
