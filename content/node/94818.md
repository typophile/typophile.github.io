body: "Hi there, typophiles, I'm looking for online essays, articles or blogs on typography
  and web design and I was hoping you could help me find some. It's for my interpreting
  homework so I need just articles by native english speakers.\r\nThe second thing
  is I have to search the articles for typography related verb-noun collocations (such
  as \"set a text\"). So far I've read a few posts on ilovetypography and I wasn't
  able to find any, so I was just wondering -- Are there some typographic verb-noun
  phrases you commonly use?\r\nThanks in advance"
