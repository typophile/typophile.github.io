  with <a href=\"http://www.typedna.com/\">TypeDNA</a> sent this to me to share with
  all of you. This is a screen grab of what they are working on right now. A glyph
  palette! This will be part of the <a href=\"http://www.typedna.com/adobe_cs_font_plugins/\">TypeDNA
  plugins for Adobe's Creative Suite</a>. So, until Adobe gives us an integrated glyph
  palette, perhaps this will do the trick!\r\n\r\nSee a <a href=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2687/4479506188_f7078e30a5_o.png\">larger
  image</a> here.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how many questions Darren will answer at present,
  but if we can keep the questions here I'll let him know about this thread."

    suggests no default glyph palette in CS5 :-( but congrats to Darren and co. for
    knacking out this plug-in. '
