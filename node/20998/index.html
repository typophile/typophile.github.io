<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>We've seen them in our travels, down the road from where we live and passed them on our way into work. They are signs and advertisements riddled with typographic errors that just make us cringe. They give meaning to the words, "Hire a Professional!" and instill in us the belief that wherever there is type, we are needed!

<div class=commentbody>Thanks for tracking that down, Andi. I was about to ask where it was. How could they. There is one good point ... it makes the mistake in not using S for St less noticeable.

<div class=commentbody>It just disgusts me every time I pass by a business or ad with some typical typeface that has nothing to do with what it should convey. Around where I live Papyrus seems to be the default for hair/beauty businesses, and Copperplate is now used on a bunch of signage! My all time make me throw up font is Comic sans. A local burger place uses that to advertise their "Western Bacon Cheeseburger"..since when did that convey burgers?! Something needs to be done, before my eyes burn off! </div>

<div class=commentbody>Hmmm. Catastrophe did not read the rules on size of ID picture.
Comic sans is often used as a "different" font by people who see all serif and all sans as identical. I once worked with a teacher in a college program that printed all her tests and her assignment sheets in comic sans.
The kicker: it was an Internet Graphic Design course (she was the programming teacher, I was the design teacher). </div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Being a full time sign designer, I share the disgust in typographical errors and other acts which I call "font murder" displayed on signs.
However, we're getting our money's worth when it comes to our commercial outdoor landscape. The sign industry has little if any glamour to attract lots of talented people. Good paying sign design jobs are rare. If we really care about the visually electric nature of our commercial streets we should be willing to invest more in them.
There is a small minority of talented artists doing very good quality work in the sign industry. They know "storefront personality" matters. They know the responsibility they have in their work, knowing if they sluff off uninspired dreck they'll be reminded of it everytime they drive past it, possibly for many years to come. At the same time they must fight from growing disillusioned by all the poor quality sign work they see others doing.
Today, most sign designers have no formal training, no art degree and are often terribly lacking in talent. But there are legions of such people who are willing to work for little pay. To most of them, it's just a job until they get something better -probably something not even art related. Since most business people still believe computers and software are creating the artwork they feel there is no need to pay extra for someone armed with an art degree and competent portfolio of work.</div>

<div class=commentbody>This reminds me of the point-of-interest signs I saw while driving through Nebraska over the weekend. The design isn't exactly flat-out horrible--I think they're rather quaint--but lets just say it hasn't aged well over the years (not to mention the physical condition of the signs!)

<div class=commentbody>You know James, that's just scary (I can hear the deliverance dueling banjo music being played in the background).
Brian, those are classic signs! And I agree, there *is* something quaint about them - and the different typestyles that are in use. Definitely a reflection of the time that they were made in.</div>

<div class=commentbody>James' "fixturs for sale" sign is quite honest and unpretentious. It does not bother me one bit. It is just some poor uneducated guy selling his stuff as best he can. The bad stuff is that done by people getting paid for signage and doing a poor job of it. Bobby is right in his post above and he echos the problems faced in all kinds of design work--where the perception is the computer just does it by itself.

<div class=commentbody>Wherever you have text signs, you get concerns over crap spelling and proofreading as well as crap design and punctuation. There's a business in our town centre with "LETTINGS AND MANAGMENT" etched in 4-inch caps on the front window. I keep wanting to go and draw an insertion mark and an "E" with a felt-tip but never have the guts. Etched lettering can't be cheap, surely somebody okayed the job <em>before</em> it was done?

That sign is at the end of my street. I've been wanting to snap a photo for a month now. I'm with you—I really love things like this, and marvel at the character of it. The painter didn't need to use three colors of paint. You can tell is was a very honest and joyful expression. </div>

Seven fonts on one sign.
As I was walking back to my car, an oriental man comes out saying, "Why you take-ah dah photo?" I replied, "As an example of bad sign-making. An internet group is discussing bad signs, and I wanted yours to show them."- He looked back at it with a consternated look, as I decided that 95 degrees was just to hot to stand in a parking lot trying to make someone who doesn't speak English very well to understand that using all the fonts in the computer can not be equated with any kind of classiness.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Dennis, I'll be your P.C. guide so you don't get in trouble anymore. It's "Asian", not oriental, and "take-ah dah", while funny, could cause a visit from our monitor.
But GOD DANG IT!!! what a sign!!! That Asian's got style! He really got his money's worth, sort of.
Now, how about a corporate sign, where it's a really high class joint, and they still don't get it. That would be fun to see. The graphics on the murals at a Panera sandwich place near my house drive me nuts. They're about 10 feet tall, all bitmapped, multi layered goo that tries to look sophisticated. I like the muffins though. er </div>

<div class=commentbody>The Pro Spa banners and window graphics are a riot! That just about qualifies as ransom note signage.
One cannot even attempt to make sense of the combinations in fonts chosen. It's like someone pouring a big glob of mustard on top of chocolate ice cream. The "PRO" letters set in script and all caps is the mark of a true amateur, one without talent, one who doesn't care about how things look or all of the above. However, I can say one nice thing about those samples. They don't appear to have Arial in them.</div>

That is an insult to true amateurs! I am an amateur, and I couldn't dream of concocting something like that. I believe it is more a case of being clueless.

<div class=commentbody>Regarding crazy combination shops:
I took a vacation in rural Hocking Hills, Ohio about two years ago and drove through a tiny town on the way with a "Beauty Salon and Chainsaw Repair" and almost soiled myself with glee!
I had to stop at the grocery next door and ask what was up, and actually, the explanation is rather interesting. It seems that the common denominator is BLADE SHARPENING!
There are actually people who drive around the countryside to small rural towns every few months and sharpen all kinds of blades for people: restaurant knives, barber's shears, chainsaws, farmer's equipment, etc.....Who knew?!
So, there could be method behind the madness of some of these places.....

<div class=commentbody>Looks to me like they originally planned for it to say 1941 but thenthe war intervened and they let things go a few years. When they were ready to finish the 1 was "cast in stone" so they just faked the 7 out of it.

<div class=commentbody>it's possible. The spacing seems to support that idea, but then, the spacing is uniformly quirky, so that can also mean nothing in particular. They are cast concrete, so chiseling a 1 into a 7 seems unlikely (cast on site, I understand). The bridges were built and dedicated in '47, when that portion of the 401 was opened. There four bridges on Hwy 401 which had those exact same plaques, and they were built in '47.

<div class=commentbody>ER - don't chill out. I have a few Asian friends who are deeply offended when people call them Oriental. For those of you who don't know why, it's because the word Oriental is meant to modify a noun (like oriental rug or vase.) To them, it's like being referred to as not really human. Another friend I have says it's because "oriental" is a word that Europeans created during a period of European exploitation of Asia -- it defines Asia through the eyes of a culture that disrespected them. Kinda the same reason Native Americans hate being called Indians ... (well, up here they do.)
I'm just saying ... it's not overly PC to respect people.
And hey, as I'm typing this, I noticed there's a whole second page to this thread that I haven't read.
Posting anyway...

I was trained in an era that precedes "political correctness". Old habits die hard sometimes. To me there is no negative connotation, so it is hard to anticipate offense.
In any case, if I hear something enough times, there is a chance I will remember. Oriental = bad. Asian = Good, if I understand correctly.

With these kinds of threads, I keep hoping none of my past blunders will surface :o\
<em>Not that there are any :o) </em> (All I'll admit to is that our past typeface was Swiss 721 BT.)
Here's one that happened when an other department decided to circumvent the 'sign department': They went to El-Cheapo sign shop for a bunch of signs with place names. Never mind that the signs looked like a dog's breakfast, the sign shop put all the names through a spell checker.
They were up for a few weeks when it surfaced that someone was blogging about them.

Reminds me of a childhood "newspaper" I used to make with my cousins in our summer place.

<div class=commentbody>Heh "femtrans" gives a lot of meaning to that graphic, which manages to be both yonic & phallic simultaneously.  Sorry to gutter-fy the thread - but I couldn't help myself.
I do agree with Mark that the type looks beautiful, besides the kerning.

An overzealous attempt at ‘Spanifying’ a sign:

Someone who needs to learn the difference between a grave accent and an apostrophe, not to mention how <em>not</em> to warp text.

<div class=commentbody>You know how schools have a sign at the front giving the school's name, that of the head teacher, perhaps the trustees or whatever, and maybe some contact phone numbers? Watching the national news on TV last night, I saw a report that happened to come from outside a school where all the above was done in Comic Sans. That raised a laugh.
