  Adam\r\nInitally Adam project started as a typeface specifically for art manifestos.
  Over a period of 1\xBD years more members and cuts were added to the family. Characterset
  was fully expanded to the Pro set (about 700 glyphs). In the early beginning, while
  working at the project in KABK type and media in Netherlands it was clear that manifestos
  require, like any other text which is to be seen and read, readability across long
  distances of copy. As well, the family needed good variants at hand for the creation
  of hierarchies (to represent the writing of multiple authors). Curatorial and critical
  writings, gallery publications as well signage and magazine articles often require
  the construction of complex hierarchies. Therefore Adam has been made with multiple
  weights, a fitting true italic and four display stencil-based cuts.\r\n\r\n\r\nEstonian
  typeface Adam italic\r\nAdam is the first typeface made in Estonia specially for
  reading sizes and continuous text. Due to the fact that there haven\u2019t been
  any text typefaces to look at, Adam\u2019s influences come from many different sources.
  Capitals are influensed by early 20th century Grotesques, lowercase redraws the
  rhytm of broad-nib writing practice. Italic is in many ways contrasting member in
  the whole family, fitted in colour and rhythm into the Adam.\u200AText sizes have
  proved to work well in magazines. For display purposes Cutted version with contextual
  alternates gives livelyness to headlines.\r\n\r\nCutted typeface Adam\r\nAdam\u2019s
  cutted versions were kept in mind while creating the solid base fonts. In a way
  sans-serif letter shapes were fitted for cutting them later. Cuts refer to the vernacular
  stencil typography. The most difficult challenge was to create cutted typeface that
  still has lively image while set on a page. A lot of stripes and \u201Cfaulty inkjet\u201D
  effect were tending to happen while printing regular stencil fonts at 10pt. For
  that end many double combinations of letters have contextual alternates, for example
  \ oo, aa, nn, ee, etc.\u200ACutted Adam is at its best on posters and in newspapers.
  For example political newspaper \u201CArgument\u201D in Norway has used Adam cutted
  black for its strong display abilities.\r\n\r\nKind regards \r\n\r\nIan Party, Maxime
