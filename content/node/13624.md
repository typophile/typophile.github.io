body: "I'm curious if people have any favorite \"screen-friendly\" serif faces. I
  am thinking headline/subhead size, image/flash based (I'm not talking about \"HTML\"
  text fonts here).\r\n\r\nI ask because some clearly work better than others. for
  instance Bodoni with its extreme thins tends to break apart at anything other than
  large sizes. What are the serif faces that hold up better in digital media?\r\n\r\n\r\nI've
  been poking around this site (please get the search feature working soon!) looking
  for a topic about this, but didn't see one. If it exists, please point me to it.

    it doesn't have any excessively thin strokes. (as you noticed)\r\n\r\nMost fonts
    specifically made for screen use are only hinted with small text sizes in mind
    anyway.\r\n\r\nMaybe if you narrowed down what feeling you're aiming for?"

  body: I would have though the rule of the thumb is something with minimal stroke
    modulation, so any old-style based font would be perfect.

    body: "I don't think stroke modulation is a problem as long as the width of the
      narrowest line isn't too low.\r\n\r\nIn other words, a heavy black serif might
      have tons of stroke modulation, but look fine on the screen because the minimum
      stroke width is still pretty beefy."

  body: "\"Most fonts specifically made for screen use are only hinted with small
    text sizes in mind anyway.\"\r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure this is not entirely true.
    The fact is that most fonts hinted for use on computer screens contain hints for
    all ranges of sizes. What is true is that some outline fonts designed to be hinted
    and used on computer screens have been designed with small sizes in mind, so like
    any good text face the lowercase is too big and spindly for larger sizes...\r\n\r\nWhat
    makes these fonts no better than anything else for you purpose, is that \r\n\"headline/subhead
    size, image/flash based\" specification. So, you are best off selecting something
    with niether small black, nor small white features, be they thin strokes, spaces
    'twixt serifs, or anythinig else that a relatively unintelligent rasterizer would
    confuse with nothing, and make disappear, or something else that'd make these
    wee features look bigger than they are s'posed to be. \r\n\r\nSo, yeah, don't
    Bodoni. "
