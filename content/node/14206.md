    no one will like it, regardless of the age. And 'fun' fonts can appeal to anyone
    of any age.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "This is a realy interesting thread. I'm probably ot going to be answering
    Marc's question either (sorry Mark).\r\nI have been using sassoon for kids multimedia.
    I wanted to know about peoples thoughts on the essentials too:\r\n\r\nx-height,
    point size, relative weight etc.\r\n\r\nAlso, more about actually setting the
    type, kerning, leading etc.\r\n\r\nI guess the key really is maximum ledgibility.
    We have been using voice over for everything and supporting that with text on
    screen.\r\n\r\nWe have three point sizes for three age ranges:\r\nprep/foundation:
    30pt sasoon sans\r\ngrade 1-2: 26pt sasoon sans\r\ngrade 3-4: 22pt sasoon sans\r\ngrade
    4-5: 18pt sasoon sans\r\n\r\nThese also had various kerning and leading setting.\r\n\r\nWe
    tried out some stuff and instinctively went for quite a bit of leading, up to
    6pts for the younger kids.\r\n\r\nThere was a fair amount of discussion about
    ambiguity of letters in various fonts: a preference for a straight tail on the
    nine(sorry about the terminoloy...), as opposed to the upside down 6 was a good
    example of this. We looked at heaps of fun fonts, but for the younger kids, didn't
    have enough differntiation between characters like 9.\r\nA capital I with ligatures
    was also necessary.\r\n\r\nmrfussy, yes, totally agree with your comment, \"letter
    identification first\" I guess even if you're not setting out to teach reading
    or writing, then it will still probably go a long way if what you're doing can
    do that as well.\r\n\r\nI think also that what is said on \"kidstype.com\" is
    a really important, in terms of what we were doing:\r\n# Teacher opinion, generally,
    favours sans serif typefaces because of the simplicity of the letter shapes\r\n#
    But children encounter a wide range of letterforms in their day-to-day environment\r\n#
    Publishers tend to listen to teachers because they influence the book-buying policy
    in schools\r\n# Children are seldom asked what they think about the typefaces
    in the books they read\r\n\r\nI may have answered my own question here, but wanted
    other peoples feedback. "
