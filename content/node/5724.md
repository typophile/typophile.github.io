body: Washington, USA--The Office of Homeland Security announced today that it has
  denied entry visas to two suspected &#34;Typoterrorists,&#34; Yuri Yarmola of Russia
  and Adam Twardoch a Polish national said to be domiciled in Berlin, both belonging
  to a subversive organization known as &#34;Font Lab.&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;We have
  solid information,&#34; said Attorney General John Ashcroft, &#34;that this Font
  Lab has been amassing huge quantities of yellow cake &#40;with chocolate frosting&#41;
  along with gallons of Borsht, which if left unrefridgerated for a few days, is capable
  of producing biological agents.&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;In addition,&#34; Ashcroft said
  during closed prayer meetings with choir boys,&#34; we&#39;ve received &#34;hints&#34;
  that this tightly kerned terrorist font cell known as &#39;The Metrics&#34; had
  attended font schools in the United States asking to be taught how to handle fonts,
  but not how to land them.&#34;  <BR> <BR>Commenting on the case at an emergency
  press conference, President Bush stated, &#34;We know that this Font Lab was close
  to developing Weapons of Font Instruction. How do we know it? Because we just do!
  Because I said so! Well for one thing the terrorists Yarmola and Twardoch don&#39;t
  own oil companies and they aren&#39;t millionaires and their names sound...unusually  <BR>suspicious
  and unAmerican. Secondly, I&#39;m pretty sure that the words Type and Terrorism
  both start with the letter &#39;T&#39; and that&#39;s all the proof I need.&#34;  <BR>
  <BR>Yarmola had previously been admitted to the US where he attended a Type conference
  and was spotted taking dozens of Spy photos of conference participants. Twardoch,
  a contributor to the just-published book, Learn FontLab Fast, a purported &#34;underground
  typoterrorism manifesto,&#34; was apprehended in 1989 attempting to board a plane
  with a kielbasa hidden in his shoe.  <BR> <BR>Attendees at this year&#39;s TypeCon
  were shocked and dismayed to learn that Yarmola and Twardoch would not be attending.
  &#34;We saw them as valuable members of our type community and little suspected
  that they had the insidious intention of destroying our American way of type.&#34;
  said Franklin Helvetica a decent, American typographer. &#34;I am sure,&#34; said
  Clarendon Baskerville, &#34;that this development will give an edge to this year&#39;s
  ATypI type conference in Prague, where an increasingly regressive and draconian
  justice system such as ours does not exist.&#34;

    I may not be attending TypeCon, sadly enough, I was not following news and updates
    closely enough, so it seems.. &#41; <BR> <BR>&#39;Be ashamed, America, be very
    ashamed..&#39;</i>

  body: Tiffany, while I share your opinion on this matter and Leslie&#39;s indignation,
    I don&#39;t think this post is a good idea. Thanks to this thread, Yuri and Adam&#39;s
    names will now be indexed on search engines and show up in Google et al linked
    to terrorism, Homeland Security, etc. <BR> <BR>A respected educator and ATypI
    member was dismayed to discover that his name showed up in an archived ATypI Rome
    newsletter satire in which he is described as being arrested for the names on
    Roman statues to Greek. Funny at the time perhaps, but not when he had to explain
    to prospective students that no, he has not been in trouble with the law in Italy.
    <BR> <BR>I suggest that you ask the Typophile guys to remove this thread.

  body: Also, Google will show up their names linked with yellow cake. And Borst.
    Not to mention John Hudson. Of course, those that <i>read</i> the article after
    finding it on Google would, presumably, notice that its a satire. <BR> <BR>It
    would have perhaps been wise to check with them first before posting &#40;assuming
    they did not&#41;, but I think I&#39;d like to hear Mr Yarmola and Mr Twardoch
    opinion on the satire and whether it should be removed? <BR> <BR>Satire and parody
    hold an important position in many of our cultures for dissent and commentary,
    one I would not like to see disappear for fear of stupid people not realising
    that yellow cake and chocolate frosting is a somewhat unlikely WMD.

    off their bus after a 54 hour bus ride.  <BR> <BR>We met them as they arrived.
    I was talking to the coach who said &#39;We had to drive through Germany because
    the Czech Republic wouldn&#39;t issue us visas&#39; &#60;gb&#62; Really? they&#39;re
    in the EU?  <BR> <BR>Talking to the Cubans on the Ukrainian team &#40;in Spanish&#41;
    we gave them bats and other things since they can&#39;t get anything. then we
    shared some Cuban cigars we brought from England. <BR> <BR>My friend who just
    came back from Iraq told how the Iraqi&#39;s are selling Cuban cigars &#40;old

  body: 'Thanks Leslie &amp; Tiffany, I find this very entertaining. This did cheer
    me up, as did the fact that I was fortunately able to give some &#34;virtual&#34;
    talks at Fontlab Ltd.&#39;s workshops at TypeCon, yesterday and today.  <BR> <BR>&#40;I
    joined in over <a href="http://www.webex.com/">WebEx</a>, a commercial online
    conferencing system that I must say I&#39;m quite impressed with despite a few
    glitches.&#41;  <BR> <BR>I definitely don&#39;t mind the story written by Leslie!
    But to clarify: I was not denied a visa but was rather victim to excessive bureaucracy
    that effectively prohibited me from applying for a visa in the first place. I
    <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4077/33767.html#POST68275">described
    it in more detail</a> for those interested. Yuri did not even plan to go to TypeCon
    this time, BTW. But I definitely don&#39;t mind Leslie&#39;s and Tiffany&#39;s
    poetic license!  <BR> <BR>Unlike my non-existent terrorist links, I do confess
    that it was me who commited that satire piece about the &#34;respected educator
    and ATypI member&#34; who was arrested for changing the names on Roman statues
    to Greek. Damn it, it&#39;s <a href="http://www.atypi.org/30_past_conferences/10_Rome_2002/news_html?newsid=35">still
    online</a>. Sorry Gerry! :&#62; I really hope that the story depicted there is
    so absurd that nobody would believe it! In particular, prospective type designers
    who want to study in Reading. BTW -- when I spoke to Gerry, the only thing he
    complained about was that I referred to him as &#34;scholar&#34; <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
