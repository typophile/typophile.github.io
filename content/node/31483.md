  target=\"blank\">this</a> article about fontlab TT hinting, which is a great help
  but I'm still having problems getting them to work correctly. I've followed he advise
  in this article but on-screen fonts still seem jaggered.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know
  of any other tutorials on this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc."

    that slightly confuses me is the different em square measurements with PS and
    TT fonts. My vfb have an em of 1000 cos I'm generating OTF fonts, can I use these
    vfb to export the TTF fonts without changing the em, cos the em square of the
    TT fonts is meant to be 2048.\r\n\r\n\r\nc.\r\n"

    you can. And in OpenType TT/TTF you can use any em square up to 16384."
