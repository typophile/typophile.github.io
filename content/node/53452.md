    up on Typophile? ;-P\r\n\r\nP.S. The Ryan Adams poster is by <a href=\"http://www.wolfgangsvault.com/dt/ryan-adams-and-the-sweetheart-revolution-poster/F493-PO.html\">Joel
    Elrod</a>. It would be nice to know who did the other three images. :-)"

    I was just teasing when I asked you how you got the images to show up on Typophile...
    Since you wrote, \"...screw computers,\" I was pointing out that they are just
    tools... You used a computer to post inspirational images here, so computers can't
    be all that bad, right? :-)\r\n\r\nI love hand-made images, too, by the way. Thanks
    for posting these. They <em>are</em> inspiring."

    we shouldn't rely completely on them. They make us lazy. \r\nTypedog you are way
    too serious. If you have a problem with what I am posting then stop looking at
    my posts. This is just a silly blog  I had to set up for my Graphic Design class. "
