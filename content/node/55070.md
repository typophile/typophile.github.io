body: I recall someone along the lines of Bruce Rogers or Dwiggins or Goudy (circa
  early 20th century US or UK) stating that 16 point is the ideal size for a fine
  press book. I'm not looking to defend or debate the topic (or what constitutes fine
  press), but rather want to track down the reference. Does this ring a bell for anyone?

    sounds like something you might find in Rogers'' 1941 <em>Paragraphs on Printing</em>
    or D.B. Updike''s <em>Printing Types: Their History, Forms and Use,</em> from
    the 1920s. Whoever said it, it''s nonsense. '

  body: Matthew Carter said something about typefaces looking best at 16 point during
    his talk on Bruce Rogers at the ATypI conference in Brighton. I can't remember
    if he was quoting Rogers, stating his own opinion, or a combination of both. I'm
    pretty sure that the statement was made while he showed a slide of a Rogers book
    whose text was set in 16pt, though.

    to such broad pronouncements, generally preferred larger types, and was very much
    one for fine editions.\r\n\r\nHowever, a quick spin through his <em>Pi: A hodge-podge
    of letters, papers, addresses, written during a period of 60 years</em> didn't
    reveal anything specific. Sorry.\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n"

  body: 'Oh, there is a optimal point size? I don''t have a clue of any reference.
    But that raises a question, if that is true, that 16 pt. is the optimal size,
    then, you have to design the book around a 16 pt. typeface of your choice. Being
    that if the face is condensed, the format will be portrait, a regular squared
    and a long horizontal face for a landscape format. '

    Bruce Rogers, D.B. Updike, Matthew Carter & others thought it would. I am talking
    metal type, not digital in this case.\r\nIn fact it seems 16 point as an \"ideal\"
    is not an uncommon opinion as it follows the Jenson models of the 16th century.
    Of course there are far too many variables to say any one thing is ideal in any
    situation. The quote I have been looking for is still eluding me but I have enough
    constructive feedback (mostly via direct email) to help with the research i am
    doing. Thank you also Dan, Kent & Gerald."

  body: "I think if you have a font with a small x-height and mucho talus, used in
    a large book you hold a bit far away, the angle the letters end up subtending
    on the retina can indeed be good. Because I do believe that's what counts, not
    half a dozen people's rose-colored vision. Everybody knows type designers can't
    read.  :-)\r\n\r\nAlso, obviously it depends on the font! Think of fonts designed
    for small sizes: they look ugly large - in fact they <em>need</em> to look ugly
    large. And I've noticed that Baskerville cannot really be Baskerville below like
    11pt.\r\n\r\nBTW, I personally think that fonts (at least those with conventional
    proportions) <em>look best</em> -which is of course not at all the same thing
    as easiest to read- at around 40pt (a size the Bentons seem to have used as a
    good place to truncate optical scaling), because that makes each glyph fill the
    hi-res fovea to the max at typical reading distances. Above 40pt you actually
    have to make multiple fixations on a single glyph to see all of it; essentially
    you never see all of it! (Unless you put it at a distance.)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Although I think the statement presumes a limited interpretation of 'fine
    press book', indicating a volume of large quarto or larger size, I can imagine
    why some might be consider 16pt a kind of ideal. It is large enough to display
    all the characteristics of the typeface for the connoisseur's delight, but is
    still a size in which the text is readable.

  body: "Since this has veered off a bit into a discussion of type size, I'll add.\r\n\r\nIf
    indeed 16 point is the ideal size for a \"fine press\" book, then in the past
    30 years the dictum is not well honored. For many years I was associated with
    the late \"Fine Print: the review for the arts of the book,\" and thus I saw many
    hundreds of \"fine press\" books. Type sizes for main text ranged from 8 point
    to 24 point. & this brings us to John Hudson's point. There was a time when \"fine
    press\" book did almost by default indicate a large page size, a page size at
    which 16 point type might work nicely.\r\n\r\nBut by the early 1970s the world
    of \"fine printing\" had widely expanded, and fine printers were exploring all
    sorts of page shapes and sizes, often dependent on the size of the presses they
    could get their hands on.\r\n\r\nSo I think the 16 point declaration was really
    tied to a certain milieu. & like all milieux, it had to pass.\r\n\r\nPersonally,
    I found 16 point to be a great size to set by hand. My short stubby fingers worked
    too slowly with smaller type. But I could fly through the case when setting 16.\r\n\r\nI
    have no idea where originated the quote Rich seeks. But it do ring a tiny bell.\r\n\r\npowers"

    chapter on Fine Printing, and in the conclusion to the chapter on Legibility he
    states <em>\"...many experiments to ascertain at what distance from the eye any
    certain size of type should be held as determined by the angle with the retina
    it subtends, but the shape of a letter, which is more important than its size,
