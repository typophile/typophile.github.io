<div class=commentbody>what i find intersting in the first logo <br>is the space that "s" lets between "pa" <br>and "te". The impression that the line of "s" <br>pastes together the two separated parts would <br>work nice, giving typographicaly the meaning <br>of the written word. <br> <br>Propably this idea would work better with clear <br>forms as you try bellow, though the world is full <br>of clean cuts and pure linear forms.

<div class=commentbody>you could approach this one of two ways. <br> <br>1) clean up the original sketch with a vector outline <br> <br>2) give the single path version some stroke modulation <br>(and round the endings too) <br> <br>in either case, try to make the 'a' and 's' a bit more <br>identifiable.

<div class=commentbody>I like plan*clothe's suggestions - they are what I had in mind when drawing the initial sketches. So this is what I have now: I think the "a" is better, and the "s" is elongated and more identifiable. I have wasted a couple of hours trying to do some stroke modulation in illustrator, and as much as I'm all about vector, I think my next step is going to be printing this out in a nice big size so I can play with it by hand. I want to add little endcaps/swirls so that it looks more hand/marker drawn. <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/13128.gif alt> <br> <br>Parte, Porte, Poste, or Paste?

<div class=commentbody>I think the identity of the "s" is still too weak. In many languages "parte" is a more recognized construction than "paste". I would introduce some backslant into the spine. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I dont think the "s" looks too much like an "r", but i do think the s doesnt look like its there at all. It could look, to some people, like a line connecting the "a" to the "t". maybe if you disconnent the "s" from the continues line of the a-s-t, and make the "s" start from somewhere alittle above the baseline it would make the "s" and the "a" clearer. <br>and i think this is much better the the initial sketch. just my personal feeling about it.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I really like the character of this one... more informal. Kind of reminds me of the <a href=http://www.veer.com/> Veer</a> logo. <br> <br>The e looks sloppy to me for some reason... I think it might have to do with the stroke not being consistent with the a and p. Might want to see what it looks like if you think the stroke out on top a bit. <br> <br>Try putting a spur (not the right term again... I know) on the a... it'd definitely make it more legible, but I don't know if it'll kill the monoline quality of this. I think even a really subtle spur (like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/pendry-script/d/testdrive.html?s=a&p=96"> this</a> would help things out here. Seems to me like it's really hard to pull off a completely curved script a.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I have to say, it's much easier to work with now that I have a clear direction. <br> <br>I definately see the Veer resemblence, but I personally like almost everything they do, so I will take that as a compliment. <br> <br>As far as the concept - I'm not really trying to express much (just a bit 'o style) via the logotype. I want to start with something solid and and eschew the 'cut'n'paste' aesthetic through the design of other identity materials... For example the business card is just a thick piece of card, with the logo and information "pasted" on via a sticker. <br> <br>Anyways, I've tweaked all the letters and adjusted the "tracking"... I'm worried it's getting too thin, but it seems to gain perceived weight in print, and I guess I can always add a black stroke to it. <br> <br>Does the "p" look too slanted now? How's the "poste" effect? <br> <br>Before & After: <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/13991.gif alt></div>

<div class=commentbody>I like the overall look. A couple of thoughts: I think I prefer the descender on the original "p". It seems a tad short now. The "e" is still troublesome. In your attempt to smooth out the curve, it has changed its proportion relative to the other letters.

<div class=commentbody>I really like where this has come, and I agree with Joe, you could kill it with too much fussing. That said, here are two observations: <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/14644.gif alt> <br> <br>1. You've got a nice thing going with the thick-to-thin transitions in the p, a, and s. The t-to-e connection still seems a bit fat, and the tail of the e also seems slightly less fluid than the other rest of the letterforms <br> <br>2. There's a little "bump" or "kink" near the top of the bowl of the e that is a tad distracting. <br> <br>Otherwise I think this is a great solution - well-crafted enough to be taken seriously, while retaining much of the playfullness of your original sketch.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Wow, truly beautiful, just wanted to say that. I just think that, in the latest versions, the acute angle in which the "p" and the "e" glyphs strokes end might take much from the flow the logo would originally have. <br> <br>Also, on the first few attemps, the "results after show grid" one is pretty cool too, loved it.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Indeed, beautiful. <br> <br>Christopher's sharp eyed advice is valuable. <br> <br>PS @ Zeh Fernando: I always get an error message when posting a message, but the message is posted anyway.</div>

<div class=commentbody>> I always get an error message when posting a message, but the message is posted anyway. <br> <br>Yeah, noticed that here. Got a timeout error and pressed "back"... then reposted. I've learnt now though, thanks.</div>
