body: "I am putting together a product catalogue for furniture. Catalogue will have
  large photos (mainly set on dark background) and some areas with copy. Look & feel:
  contemporary/minimalistic. I want to use all serif for header, sub and body.\r\n\r\nI
  am set for the body with Fedra Sans Alt Book. What would work well for headers and
  subs?\r\n\r\nI was looking at poosibly using Irma Thin for header and Jigsaw Light
  for subs.\r\n\r\nThanks for any help."

  body: "Why not consider Fedra Serif then? It would look completely unified since
    you would use fonts from the Fedra typeface together.\r\n\r\nJigsaw Light might
    be too similar to Fedra Sans to serve as a good contrast for the sub-body text
    relationship. Irma Thin is slightly different, but still a sans and would work
    only if your headers are big enough to contrast from your body text. Both of these
    are sans-serif, though \u2014 did you have any serif choices you were looking
    at already?"

    why not use a display face?\r\nPerhaps stenciled.\r\nThere are stenciled types
    in both serif and sans genres."

  body: Thanks for your input. Sorry, I meant all sans seriff. If I go with Fedra
    sans Alt Book for the body, then Fedra Sans Condensed Alt Demi for Subhead what
    do you thing of Jigsaw for header (all caps letters)?
