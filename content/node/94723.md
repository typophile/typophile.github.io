body: "I've been working on my first font; it tries to channel early woodblock display
  fonts, with a very low-fidelity, imprecise and analogue quality. There are no straight
  lines, and a plenty of intentional 'defects'. \r\n\r\nThere's a couple of sharp
  corners that I still need to go over, but I'm wondering a lot about the broader
  direction that I want to move in.\r\n\r\nA short sample:  http://cl.ly/I5W0\r\n\r\nFull
  PDF sample: http://cl.ly/I5D3\r\n\r\nIt's really designed for low quality newsprint
  (I made the first few letters for my school's newspaper) so I encourage you to print
  it out and look at it on the page if you have the time and patience.\r\n\r\nI haven't
  done anything more than side bearing-based spacing yet (the & entering the P is
  a mistake, not a ligature.)"

  body: "I'm not getting how it's designed for low-quality newsprint. In fact the
    spacing is tight enough to cause problems in low-quality printing.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "The spacing is really a bit of an afterthought at this point; it's going
    to be redone entirely soon, looser than it is. I really want to get all of the
    letterforms right before I start dealing with spacing, so I don't end up having
    to redo it later.\r\n\r\nThere's a crispness to printing these days that, on low
    quality newsprint, especially with bad color, makes most very large type (this
    was designed for a flag), especially many serifs, feel out of place, due to the
    precision in the printing not being reflected in the color and consistency of
    the newsprint. The intention is that the imprecision rejects modernist tendencies
    towards perfection, and instead embraces the faults of the medium."

  body: "I'm no fan of Modernism, but I think ill-defined romanticism isn't much better.
    When you consider that a \"clean\" font will end up looking like your font once
    it goes through low-quality printing, \"designed for low-quality printing\" doesn't
    seem to make sense (\"designed <em>to look like</em> low-quality printing\" would
    be fine though). To me what you describe would be a font with deep traps and sharp
    thorns.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: The black print quality in most newspapers is rather precise, at least at
    sizes > 64pt, but the paper and the colors are consistently subpar. It is in fact
    designed to channel the feeling of low quality printing, for reasonably precise
    printing, on low quality paper.

  body: "Funky |Q|!\r\n\r\nTo me it feels like the font is emulating the look of cheap
    newspaper printing, ie the melted corners and slightly wobbly lines. That, as
    such, looks to be working."
