body: "I'm in school (not design-related - in a social science) and sometimes need
  to hand in papers that are \"double-spaced, in Times New Roman or similiar font,
  at about 12 point.\"\r\n\r\nI've been using Plantin 11/28 which looks about right.
  Usually we hand in a PDF of papers - I'm not sure all our professors print them
  out or read on screen. Probably usually printed out, though they might read shorter
  assignments on screen.\r\n\r\nFor various reasons I am looking to use something
  different.  I've seen two typefaces I like a lot that are not too expensive -- Publico
  and Guardian Egyptian. But I wonder if there is anything I should be concerned about
  in how these, which were designed for newspapers, might look on paper with a lot
  of space between lines?"

    it runs very well for technical and academic texts.\r\n\r\nUtopia, Iowan and Charter
    seems to be good options too.\r\n"

  body: Liberation Serif has the same proportions as Times, and wide language support
    (Cyrillic and Greek etc). It is in the public domain. I don't know if you like
    it's style though.

  body: "You can go for Palatino, Georgia, Century (Schoolbook), these are on most
    Systems, although on windows you might need to look for the Palatino clone Book
    Antiqua. If you are on a mac the Hoefler Text is related to the Garamond tradition
    and a nice font, although it has Old Style Numbers. \r\n\r\nIf you use MS office
    you can go with Constantia.\r\n\r\nFree fonts consider Gentium, Liberation, Libertine,
    Bergamo, Deja Vu Serif you can find on [[http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/list/style/Serif|fontsquirrel.com]].\r\nHave
    a look at the progress of [[http://aldusleaf.org/|Crimson Text]].\r\n\r\nUtopia
    and Minion in an older version are free for LaTeX, I am not sure about the licence
    here, but at least they can be found in some latex font directory, google will
    help you here. \r\n\r\nI would not recommend to go for something to warm or to
    progressive. Academics certainly benefits from a departure of TNR, but it should
    not be a noticeable font so to speak. \r\n\r\nClassical text faces include Janson
    Text, Sabon, (Adobe) Garamond, (Adobe or Williams) Caslon, Baskerville (Original),
    Minion among others. It does not need to be this conservative, they are just options.
    Guardian is a fine one too. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks, but rather than asking for typeface recommendations, I'm interested
    if there will be any problems with faces designed for \"cramped\" use like the
    two I mentioned being used in situations with huge amounts of space between lines.
    \ The samples from the vendor are set with tight leading and look good, but that's
    not how I'll be using them.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts on that, or is it a non-issue?"

    lucky to have a choice. In Brazil, academic works are almost always made with
    Arial or Times due to stupid local standards."

  body: "Times was originally designed for a newspaper, and has somewhat cramped proportions,
    compared to classic book faces such Bembo, Garamond, and Caslon.\r\n\r\nNonetheless,
    it works just about anywhere.\r\n\r\nI suggest you download a few of the free
    faces mentioned here and try them out.\r\n\r\nIf they seem OK, then go with one
    of those, or invest in a commercial font of similar effect."

    his [[http://new.myfonts.com/person/Dino_dos_Santos/DStype foundry fonts]] are
    quite affordable, even for students. I got myself two cuts of Capsa, that is all
    I need for papers, but have a look at Musee and Leitura too. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "@forrest\r\n\r\nDouble spacing and Times New Roman are examples of many of
    the anachronisms inherent to the world of academia. It makes little sense for
    most printed (not for publishing) academic work, and makes even less sense if
    it is handed in PDF format to be read (more often than not, one assumes) on-screen.\r\n\r\nAnachronisms
    aside, if the requirement is to hand the work in using as a PDF document, you
    should ideally be looking for a typeface which is designed to have extremely good
    screen legibility (a really well hinted font). I personally find that Bitstream's
    Iowan Pro and Charter Pro fit the bill, while remaining affordable (remember,
    you probably need only 2~3 weights for average academic work). Of these two Iowan
    would probably be easier on the eyes for extended text.\r\n\r\nYou may also want
    to consider [[http://www.linotype.com/137452/trumpmediaevaloffice-family.html?PHPSESSID=27b8480e3ecf6291aea7780bb0295b82|Trump
    Mediaeval Office]], which was re-designed for office communication and to be a
    TNR replacement. It is also a superbly well hinted font, specifically designed
    for on-screen reading."

  body: "Adam, \r\n\r\nSo I should just tell my professors that the work shouldn't
    be double-spaced? Interesting.  Did you successfully lobby your professors to
    change a nearly univeral and arbitrary requirement at your school?  I'd been interested
    in how you that went."
