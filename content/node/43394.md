    you like more the black background or the other one? I really need to know because

  body: I'm having trouble perceiving a difference between the top two besides color.  If
    you're doing only web stuff, the color shouldn't matter; just go with whatever
    suits the design and palette of the website.  If you're doing print applications,
    particularly letterhead, then you should stick with the one on the left (unless
    your client is set on somehow using black paper).
