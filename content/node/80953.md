body: "When merely \"extended\" just would not do, here is Paragraph Stretch\u2122:
  a super extended or elongated geometric display typeface. It is a modular unicase
  typeface: the capitals and lower case fit the same height and width, so they are
  interchangeable: fancy a round \"W\" in all caps? Use the lower case. Want a straight
  \"x\" in lower case? Use the cap. And so on. Designed for use at larger sizes for
  logotypes, short titles or headings. It supports Western plus Nordic, Eastern European
  and Turkish languages.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/parastretch-release_6464.png]\r\n\r\nAvailable

  body: "<em>\u2026 it is a modular unicase typeface \u2026 </em>\r\n\r\nModular and
    unicase are the wrong words.\r\nLinotype faces were modular, for instance, but
    not monowidth/monospace/tabular, which would be more correct.\r\nAnd some glyphs
    (t and i) aren't in fact monowidth.\r\nNor is a typeface with both upper and lower
    case a unicase.\r\n\r\nThe inventor of the monowidth + unicase system of type
    design named it the \"panoptic alphabet\", after its first demonstration in the
    Panoptica typeface. So you could say that upper and lower case may be combined
    for a panoptic effect.\r\n\r\nIs this an OpenType feature in your typeface?\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nBTW,
    I'm getting a kind of 1995 rave flashback, as well as the Porsche thang :-)"

    I'd probably want this for the gold-coated letters in the brand name.

  body: "Nick, with \"unicase\" I wanted to say that the upper and lower are freely
    interchangeable (they are on the same height, and similar visual width). What
    should I call it instead? As for \"modular\", it was meant to say that identical,
    repeating parts are used to create the glyphs. Should I change the description?
    And no OpenType feature for the changing of U/c and l/c: it is left to the designer/user.\r\n\r\nT\xE9,
    I hope that there are thousands upon thousands of people designing eckspensif
    hi-fi gear and they'll all buy it :o)"

  body: "Jan, \"modular\" does not mean monowidth/monospace/tabular. The old Linotype
    system had a width module of which all character widths were a multiple. Some
    digital fonts are constructed similarly, to improve hinting. Pixel fonts are also
    modular, though rarely monowidth.\r\n\r\nI would say that this typeface accommodates
    a \"unicase effect\", because there is no unicase font and it is not a unicase
    typeface, but the effect is genuine.\r\n\r\nMonowidth is another issue, because
    the \"t\" and \"i\" at least are not monowidth.\r\n\r\nI think you should cut
    to the chase and make the \"unicase effect\" and \"monowidth effect\" OpenType
    features, so that users can dial them up with either a Stylistic Set, or perhaps
    in the Titling feature (more easily accessible). Or you could do it as a separate
    font, perhaps a free incentive.\r\n\r\nAFAIK, no layout apps support the \"unic\"
    feature, but I have dutifully include it in several fonts, in anticipation.\r\n"

  body: I immediatly recognise it as a modular construction. A wide gaspipe. But I
    also think that your use of modular in the description sounds like something to
    do with how the font will be used, rather than how it was drawn.

  body: Can one not say modular, meaning made of limited components or modules, not
    relating to the spacing, just the drawing? I don't understand the confusion.

  body: "You could, if you qualified it like that.\r\nBut Jan said, \"It is a modular
    unicase typeface: the capitals and lower case fit the same height and width.\"\r\nI
    criticized that for being incorrect.\r\nTo repeat: that is what we typographers
    call monowidth, monospace or tabular, not modular.\r\nAlso, several characters
    in the lower case are not monowidth.\r\n\r\nAlthough James Mosley refers to \"modular\"
    units of sub-character width, the generally-used term appears to be \"unitized\":\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/37601\r\n\r\n<a

    is a pointedly modular face, so I don't think that something like Paragraph Stretch,
    which has basically a simple geometric structure, really qualifies as being particular
    modular, because then you might just as well say that all geometric faces are
    modular, which is redundant."

  body: "Thanks for that Nick, so paragraph was wrong to call this modular, because
    the characters aren't the same width - the preferred term for which is unitized.\r\n\r\nAnd
    regarding drawing from basic units - modular is an acceptable term but this design
    is not an example of it?"

  body: "Right. I think it's fair to say that in design, the modules must be apparent
    for a piece to qualify as modular.\r\nCopy-and-paste isn't modular, because the
    repeated elements are not discrete.\r\n\r\nFontstruct is modular.\r\n\r\n(BTW,
    this isn't a criticism of Jan's face, just a discussion of terminology.)\r\n"
