body: "Hi there!\r\n\r\nFirst off, this is my first foray into attempting to create
  a font or toying with fonts in general. I've been interested in how all this works
  for some time, but never really delved into it until recently.\r\n\r\nI have been
  asked to create a custom handwriting font for one of my clients so that they can
  use it for custom graphics and other things I will be creating for a new site and
  some album artwork I will be designing.\r\n\r\nMy basic problem is that the fonts
  like B's and P's and D's are being filled in by 'black globs' and I am not sure
  how to fix this problem.\r\n\r\nI have the following screenshots so you can see
  what I am dealing with:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.mbstia.com/testing/fontexpert.jpg\"
  target=\"_blank\">Overall Font as it looks in FontExpert font viewer</a>\r\n\r\n<a
  href=\"http://www.mbstia.com/testing/boutline.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Font outline
  in Fontographer</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.mbstia.com/testing/bpreview.jpg\"
  target=\"_blank\">Font 'Preview' in Fontographer</a>\r\n\r\nAs you can see, in the
  outline it looks as it should with the 'holes' in the \r\n\"B\" where the should
  be. But then if you view the preview the entire B is filled in and solid.\r\n\r\nI
  am working with the following programs:\r\nPhotoshop CS2\r\nAdobe Streamline 4\r\nMacromedia
  Fontographer 4.1\r\n\r\nWhat I did to make the font was:\r\n1.) Had the person give
  me a handwriting sample\r\n2.) Cut out each letter and made it a TIFF file\r\n3.)
  Batch Converted all the TIFF files to EPS files in Streamline\r\n3.) Imported each
  glyph into Fontographer\r\n4.) Created a TrueType Font\r\n\r\n\r\nIf anyone can
  give me some hints or tell me how to fix this issue, I would greatly appreciate
  it.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nMichelle"

  body: 'Hi Michelle. If you go to Element > Correct Path Direction, that should solve
    your problem. Essentially, the outside path of your ''B'' and the 2 inside paths
    need to move in opposite directions. Every letter with a counter needs this same
    fix applied. '

  body: "Hi Matterson,\r\n\r\nAh! That did the trick! Thanks so much for pointing
    that out to me.\r\n\r\nI was wondering if there are some good books on creating
    fonts or some places online that would help me learn?\r\n\r\nRight now I am wondering
    how to get the Large letters (Caps) to look larger than the small letters. I have
    no idea how to control the size of these when outputting. For some reason when
    I bring the EPS files into Fontographer it reads the sizes strange and some small
    letters are bigger than Capitals and things like the * symbol are really small
    compated to the - or _. I tried to fix these things by changing the weight but
    that doesn't always work. Also is there a way to make a comma 'sit' in the right
    place, and things like that.\r\nHere is an example of what things look like now:\r\n<a

    link</a>).\r\n\r\nValuable (and unusual) mix of historical context, in depth case
    studies and practical how-tos (inc Fontographer specific stuff). Very readable.\r\n\r\nWhile
    I haven't come across the size problem (I've used Fontlab in my initial font dabbling)
    I think the answer to the size issue is mentioned in this book -- haven't got
    it to hand -- and involves importing each glyph along with a consistently sized
    reference bounding rectangle  - but I'm sure someone else knows the definitive
    answer."

    like $7.

  body: "http://www.fontifier.com/\r\nI think Dan is referring to this website.\r\nThe
    size issue is to do with the way you import the streamline drawings into Fontographer
    as Elliot mention the best way to do this is to open all the streamline files
    in Illustrator (or similar vector graphics software) and create a box the same
    height (or slightly more) as the combined height of your ascender and descender
    and position each glyph in it on separate layers, adjusting the width to suit
    each glyph. Then cut and paste the glyph and the box into Fontographer then delete
    the box, which leaves the glyphs at the same scale, a rather long job but ultimately
    satisfactory. You might decide that speed dictates you spend the $9 to get it
    done by Fontifier, but it is worth doing to learn the basics of Fontographer.\r\nTim"

    swear by Fontographer, but I'd recommend that if you can get your hands on FontLab,
    to do so. Cabarga also has a book called Learn FontLab Fast which is great as
    well. \r\n\r\nI would also go the next step and say that in the future it can
    be much easier if you take vector art straight into your font application. Since
    you're using Photoshop CS, why not use Illustrator CS's Pathfinder tools? That'll
    save you some time on your filled in forms if you like working with other programs
    before Fontographer or FontLab.\r\n\r\n"
