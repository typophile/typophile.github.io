  see accompanying anthropological photographs & video frames?\r\n\r\nI am linking
  low resolution examples of my fieldwork: [[http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=136095&id=748207703&l=d740ca539c|Gallery
  @ Facebook]]. Please tell me if it doesn't work.\r\n\r\nThe people you see in these
  images face imminent genetic extinction and ongoing cultural erosion. For clarification,
  DNA migration may stem from outside tribes joining this tribe to evade western influence.
  There have also been accusations of brothel rape. You can see in the photographs
  that children do not share grandparent's physical traits. Only 155 surviving individuals
  reflect the ancestral appearance - most of whom are elders who have had their children.\r\n\r\nWhich
  typeface, and do you think any particular layout should be considered? :)"

    I found myself wanting to see captions in a typeface that did not call attention
    to itself and had the feeling of being part of a field report. I thought of Officina
    Sans. \r\nJuliet"

  body: "It's a difficult question. I'm slightly familiar with the Batak people since
    my manager used to live in Sumatra and is married to a Batak woman.\r\nI like
    the idea of choosing type that looks like a field report; but perhaps for captions
    only. I don't think Officina Sans works well for long text blocks \u2014 all those
    rectangular serifs get in the way for me.\r\nI'm not sure if you're producing
    an academic essay, a trip report or something larger so I won't advise on layout.\r\nI
    worked on a project a couple of years ago for an international peace organisation
    that was concerned with endangered communities in Colombia. I chose Dolly, which
    I chose for its feeling of humanity and compassion, and the fact I really like
    it. Not sure if that's very helpful ;)"
