  the font used for the top billing on the Caffeine poster as can be seen at http://www.impawards.com/2007/caffeine_ver2.html.\r\n\r\nIt's
  very familiar, so either I've seen it in font forums or in other designs, or both.
  \ And while looking for it I've found a few similar looking fonts, but I can't seem
  to be able to nail the exact one.\r\n\r\nAnyone here that knows?\r\n\r\nm."
