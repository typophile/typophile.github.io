  body: "I'm guessing handlettering, based on the evidence of slight variations in
    the letterforms (e.g., the <strong>T</strong> in <em>locket</em> is wider than
    the other <strong>T</strong>s). [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/cheltenham/|Cheltenham]]
    has a similar feel, though you'd have to modify it to get the cockeyed <strong>O</strong>
    and the high-waisted <strong>K</strong>.\r\n\r\nThis example was foil stamped,
    not printed, so the binder would have had to make a stamping die. In the  1930s
    this could have been done photographically, so it would have been just as easy
    to make it from handlettering as from a repro proof of type. Book titles were
    commonly handlettered in those days when there were far fewer typefaces available
    in the large sizes needed for book covers and jackets."

  body: "I agree with PublishingMojo that it's hand-lettered, as were almost all book
    covers from the era, and with his explanation.\r\nStill, the lettering is interesting.
    I adjusted the geometric distortion and improved the contrast so we can better
    see what we are trying to match:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NancyDrew6_3734.jpg]\r\nWe
    have a mixture of styles so no single font is going to do the trick. The angled
    slope of O, an \"old style\" font feature is unlikely to be found in fonts with
    the boxy structure of the other letters. And note the high-waist K.\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "You're welcome. \r\nI am assuming the lettering is from the first edition,
    1933.\r\nThe Nancy Drew books began in 1930. This one is number 11. Five more
    in the 1930s. If the publisher,  Grosset & Dunlap, was seeking some consistency
    in the series, the lettering on at least some of the other 1930s books might in
    the same style. The lettering would probably be sufficient for a font designer
    to make a titling font that would have this particular retro flavor. IMHO there
    is no shortage of people able to use modern font-making tools who are looking
    for interesting material. \r\nDon\r\n"
