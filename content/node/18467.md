  (editor in chief, maganging editor, etc.) and an art side (design director, directory
  of photography, photographers).\r\n\r\nThe problem is that I need a section title--like
  \"Editorial\"--for the art side.  Any ideas what to call it?\r\n\r\n-Will"

  body: i would say that you wouldn't realy need titles for diferent sections. "creative"
    was the best I could think of, and you're riht, there realy isn't much of a word
    for those.
