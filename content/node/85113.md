  really know what I'm asking other than are there any good starting points when looking
  for the correct typeface or typefaces to inspire me.  I want to make a really solid
  and iconic logo that won't look tacky or dated at any point.  I need it to be t-shirt
  worthy basically.  Any advice would be much appreciated. "

  body: "<em>Post-rock</em>: uh. Postdated? Queen? (Happy 65th Birthday Freddy Mercury!)\r\n\r\n<em>Heavy</em>
    is from Heavy Metal, i.e., two or three lead guitars, lots of percussion, and
    loud, raspy voices.\r\n\r\n<em>Prog</em> is short for \"progressive rock\", which
    is sort of a sidetrack of \"classic\" rock & metal. \"Classic\" metal (the loudness
    alluded to above) is sort of retro -- think Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, Iron
    Maiden, and (gosh) their poppier cousins Bon Jovi and Europe. Nowadays, metal
    falls under Speed (a.k.a. \"Thrash\") metal (System of a Down, Metallica), Nu-metal
    (thrashier than thrash -- Slipknot), and my current favourite flavour: Progressive,
    i.e., melodious songs, more often than not heavy on the bass, but with lighter
    foreground notes. Nothing weird in encountering the odd cross-over with country
    or blues. Examples: Opeth, Ayreon, Within Temptation, Tool.\r\n\r\n(Note that
    discussions of metal are as open to feverish argumentation as everything else,
    taste-wise.)\r\n\r\nI would not recommend the usual Heavy Metal treatment for
    a prog-rock band -- please, no Blackletter! Perhaps a clean, straight font would
    work, something like Copperplate Bold. I reckon the actual band name is also of
    importance ..."

    Marlboro might be nice, unless the group is smoke-free, of course.

  body: "Somebody on Typophile who knows what prog is! Awesome, Theunis :-)\r\nTo
    me (and I'm no expert by any means) the \xABprogressive\xBB qualifier is mostly
    one of (1) more open song structure, i.e. often a departure from the classic 3-
    to 5-minute stanza/refrain pattern into more open, often long and meandering and
    more or less complex compositions that can also often (2) cross over between different
    genres, as Theunis has hinted at. Much progressive metal and especially progressive
    rock (bands like Porcupine Tree come to mind) refer back more or less strongly
    to the progressive/psychedelic rock of the early 70s (think Dark Side of the Moon,
    or what Pink Floyd did on Atom Heart Mother, for an \xABextremum point\xBB of
    that direction).\r\n\r\nPost-rock: The way I understand it, refers to music that
    uses classic rock instrumentation but departs from rock song structures. Often
    droney, ambient-ish, experimental. \r\n\r\nI think this overall field of music
    is very open and sort-of fuzzy by definition, and it's hard to offer blanket design
    advice. Would be interesting to know more about the band in question \u2013 how
    heavy is it, how experimental, how melodic, how strong are the classic prog /
    '70s psychedelic leanings, etc; how complex is the music, and would you prefer
    to hint at this complexity in the design, or create a clean counterpart? Depending
    on these questions it could really be anywhere from very clean sans-serif to blackletter,
    also depending on how you combine it with artwork (will you also be doing album
    sleeves?).\r\nAny chance of listening samples?\r\nSexy project in any case. Damn,
    I'd want one of these! :-)\r\n\r\n<cite>\xABplease, no Blackletter\xBB</cite>\r\n\r\nOh,
    I don't think that can be said as a general statement at all. The <a href=\"http://www.guitarmessenger.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Opeth-Logo.jpg\">Opeth
    logo</a> is one of my favorite band logos out there (though I may be biased since
    I just love the music to bits), works beautifully, fits the music (and artwork
    and overall design) beautifully, and is very blackletter. And they're prog metal,
    at least most of the time :-).\r\nI'd rather have said no Copperplate \u2013 sorry.
    That's not fresh enough in my book. "

    as phallic)

    Blackletter to their advantage ... I guess I was just prejudiced against using
    it <em>by default</em>.
