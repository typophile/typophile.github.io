  body: 'Looks like a slightly edited pixel/bitmap font to me (only need to extend
    /H and /N vertical stems). Very easy to reproduce as it''s only made with identical
    squares. If you still need something that could quickly do the job, may be having
    a look to some sections at DaFont would worth a shot: <strong>[[http://www.dafont.com/bitmap.php|Bitmap
    > Pixel, Bitmap]]</strong> and [[http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=301|Techno
    > Square]]'
