    think it's a font as it, more a custom work based on some existing type or why
    not a hand-lettering by Otomo Katsuhiro himself mimicking some black condensed
    grotesk. If I had to reproduce it, I'd probably start with [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/Impact|Impact]],
    stretching it and pulling some points up/downwards to reduce bowlers. [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/tasse|Tasse]]
    would be another good substitute.</blockquote>"
