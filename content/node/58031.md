body: "Hello there.\r\n\r\nI'm working on a new identity for a boutique winery called
  Tenor. While the design is still pretty rough (colors, composition), I'm looking
  for feedback on the Tenor type specifically. Conceptually, I've settled on modifying
  Didot, e.g. modernizing it, which I think retains the classical look of Didot while
  the contrast of the letterforms references musical notes. The 5 lines are clearly
  a nod to the staff in sheet music. I know there's been others who've experimented
  with sans'ing Didot (Bilak, etc). I'm curious to get your expert opinions, the 'R'
  in particular is a bit odd, and I'm thinking of redrawing the tail with a subtle
  curve rather than so flat.\r\n\r\nI included another label which is 1:1, a very
  high end, low-volume specialty of Tenor. I drew the 1's to match the Tenor type,
  this design would be entirely blind embossed.\r\n\r\nAny help/feedback is much appreciated,
  thanks!"

    vibe from it. It feels very art deco to me. It looks great, but if you were after
    a modern feel, maybe not the right style. "

  body: Good comments, I guess I'm overstating by say it's modern, just modernized
    from Didot by itself. It certainly does feel more deco. Any thoughts on the rendering
    of the Tenor type?

    I should look at refining? thanks!"

    bulbous shapes whereas the other letterforms focus on lines with a more \"staccato\"
    feel. I'm also curious as to why the return isn't 'completed'.\r\n\r\nmaybe it's
    just the fact that both feet of the R finish wide.\r\n\r\nmy terms are totally
    off but hope it makes sense - we've had a homemade pizza and beer/wine arvo at

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tenoriffic_3948.png]\r\n\r\nNew version
    w/ some of Paul's comments on widths and the N, I do think the R is looking better
    (completed the terminal), I was just looking for a little character, but I suppose
    that should come from the label design, not the type. There's another thread w/
    comments about Britannic being a nice contrast sans, I took cues from its R.\r\n\r\nI'm
    also curious optically, if I need to - or how much - extend the apexs of the N,
    I believe this would be considered display size, to be printed at approx 1.25\"
    height.\r\n\r\nAnd if you're curious what the original R looks like in comparison:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tenor_rs_5614.png]\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the all the help!"

    what about the E is bothering you? After some deliberation, I like the flat R,
    the slight tail seemed to draw to much attention to itself. I increased the overshoot
    on the N and made them points, rather than slightly flat at top. I think this
    is looking pretty good. Thoughts?\r\n\r\nThanks again for all the help."

  body: The proportions of the E just don't seem very elegant to me. In particular,
    the middle bar seems stubby. The whole letter might look better a bit narrower.
    Just some things to play with...

    There didn't seem to be rhyme/reason to leaving the opening in the R, and the
    tail didn't seem to fit the personality of the rest of the letters.\r\n\r\nThe
    colors are a bit exaggerated here to get the concept of an analogous color system
    w/ the varietals, but you get it. The lines would be blind embossed.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tenor_labels_3999.png]"
