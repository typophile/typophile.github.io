  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I have this free font provided by EPSON. It's a very old font that used to be shipped with printer drivers in the 90s. I can use it in Windows without a problem. I now want to use it on my Mac (OSX 10.8) and see that the font name is garbled when I install it but the contents in the preview show up fine. I can use it in Photoshop alright but I mainly want to use it in MS Word 2011. In Word I can see the font listed (name garbled) but can't select it. I tried selecting some text and then choosing the font but it defaults to the previously selected font. 

I don't know much about fonts but still I tried a more hands-on approach. I downloaded TTFEdit and replaced the gabled font name characters with regular ones. After doing this the font won't even show up in the font list either in Photoshop or MS Word! I tried different things in the editor all with the same outcome.

I would really love to be able to use this font on my mac since it is the only font that has the biggest set of japanese kanji in textbook format (strokes that can be clearly seen). It's a very good teaching tool and it's free. I can't afford the paid alternatives.

The actual font name is: EPSON 教科書体Ｍ, pronounced kyoukasho tai M, which translates to "textbook body".

Here's the original, unmodified font file: [[http://cacaculo.com.ar/epkyouka.ttf|epkyouka.ttf]]

		<div class="commentbody">Quite a few of the internal font names need to be changed. I don't know how much control you have available in TTFEDIT, but in Fontforge, I changed about a dozen of the font name instances to EPSON-KYOKASHO and it all now works fine. This includes all of the entries that go into what FontLab calls 'Additional Open-Type Names'.     - Herb</div>

Thanks for your prompt response. I've installed Fonrforge and tried renaming all the fields like you suggested but I can't find the Additional Open-Type Names. Where exactly are those?

Also, when exporting I'm using the default settings for TTF. Is there anything special that I should set there?

JanekZ, I pasted the same name on every window. What you are seeing might be that the program uses a different font to show the dialog boxes. Anyway, I'm sure all those names are exactly the same.</div>

I assume you set up your Mac for Japanese input?

Thanks for jumping in. I tried the font you linked to and had similar results. However this new font file IS being recognized by other programs on my Mac (TextEdit, Illustrator, etc) and that's good enough for me. This clearly is a Word 2011 issue and even after applying the latest available updates the issue remains. 

Thanks all for the patience and help!

When I tried OTF no programs would recognize the font. Using your version, all other programs do recognize it except for... Word (no surprise there). Thanks for giving it a shot though. I really appreciate it!

Here's a screenshot with your OTF version on the right (TextEdit) and Word on the left with the default font. 
Note that the TextEdit screenshot says "Helvetica" because that what it shows when you un-select text, but you can clearly see that the font is the one I want (brush strokes are more evident and it's a little slanted).

I downloaded at least 20 japanese fonts from around the web and Word seemed to dislike them all until I found a page in the [[http://www.l.u-tokyo.ac.jp/GT/downloads.html|Univeristy of Tokyo]] where they posted an archive with a font that worked properly. I don't know if this will server of any purpose, but here it is: [[http://cacaculo.com.ar/GT2000-01.zip|GT2000-01.zip]].

Particularly in light of:

<em>Microsoft Office does not support custom fonts. This includes any fonts that were manipulated by a font or typography program.</em>

Is FontForge leaving telltale metadata that is being picked up by word? Have you tried opening the saved file with TTX and running a search? Also, if the naming metadata does not conform to Word standards this could be causing problems. It might be worth checking [[http://forum.fontlab.com/index.php?topic=313.0|Adam Twardoch's updated naming guide]].</div>

Thanks for the info. Could you post a screenshot of the "PS Names" pane in FontForge. Even though I enter the names exactly as in your screenshot, fontforge complains about about the PS Names. It would be great if you could post your own version so that I could try it here.

I checked out the link you posted and found it very insightful. So Bill says "Microsoft Office does not support custom fonts. This includes any fonts that were manipulated by a font or typography program." 
They realize that EVERY font is manipulated by a font program, right? I mean, every font, theirs too... unless they have a guy who can just type out the font's binary code rain man style! hahaha</div>

Exactly what I thought when I first saw that!

The PS names are as follows (sorry, juggling an offline computer with a mobile device and not easy to post a screenshot on the fly):

Fontname: EpsonKyokasho
Family Name: Epson Kyokasho
Name For Humans: EpsonKyokasho
Weight: Book
Version: 3.00
sfnt Revision: 3

		<div class="commentbody">Karl, after following the steps you described the font won't even show up on Word at all BUT an odd thing happened for the first time which is that while Word was loading, a sign popped up "regenerating font list" which has never happened before. 
Note that if I type the font name on the font box, the autocomplete does recognize the font but Word won't render it.

I've been a software developer for 12 years and I've written software for websites that get millions of hits per month but this --installing a font-- is what stumps me. Seriously.  :(</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Based on those screen shots:

Probably what follows is worthless, I don't really know what I'm doing, but this has worked for me (with fonts small enough that FontLab can handle them) when there were naming issues.

First thing I would do, without knowing why -- just because it has worked -- is to click on the big red "X" in the Additional Open Types dialog panel. That resets things. Let FontLab build what it wants.

And as a note, I'd watch the parentheses in the copyright information panel. With PostScript Type 1 & Windows, anyway, they are invalid -- you need to use the escape characters -- \(C\).

Save it as a .vfb.

Now, export it as whatever it is (TrueType? PostScript?). Maybe even use an OpenType format. 

Problem is, you might solve one issue & create others by doing this.</div>

That was how I got to the version in the screenshot, re-building the naming from scratch and then structuring everything there (Additional OpenType names) afterwards.</div>
