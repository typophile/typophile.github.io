  Juan.  They mostly sell very expensive watches. The brand must represent luxury
  and also the client wants a symbol they can use alone.  Don't pay any attention
  to the name because it doesn't have any relation to luxury, jewelry or anything
  for that matter.\r\n\r\nHere is the current logo:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_jibarito_5478.gif]\r\n\r\nThis
  is the proposed logo used in various sample executions:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/200290680-003_1_4237.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/maria-menounos-chopard-and-valentino-dinner-party-cannes-3_1_5818.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Gad-Elmaleh_1_5179.jpg]\r\n\r\nWhat

  body: "For those not in the know, \"Club Jibarito\" is a funny name for an upscale
    jewelry store because it basically means something along the lines of \"Little
    Hillbilly Club.\"  No matter; my last name is \"Hladek,\" and I'm half Puerto
    Rican, so go figure.\r\n\r\nI second David's perspective.  The proposed logo doesn't
    have very good balance.  The 'j' makes it top heavy, and yet, at the same time,
    the 'C' is too big.  Not a bad direction, though.\r\n\r\n--\r\nNick Hladek"

  body: or extend the bottom of the c to balance the j, but i'd leave the icon and
    work on the text. all caps? I like "club" in all caps but i'm not a fan of "JIBARITO".
    Good luck.

  body: How about turning the 'C' around counter clockwise to symbolize a necklace
    around a neck which in this case would be the 'J'. This takes care of the top
    heavy issue. Just a thought...

  body: Your mock-ups illustrate a scale problem with your tag line. Notice yours
    is the only logo with text that's too small to read? Otherwise, I agree with everything
    vintagesignman said. The capital J and I are competing with each other, and no
    amount of obsessive kerning will ever help.

  body: The C in the mark does not match the C in the name. It looks odd when it is
    the only letter with the serif on top, give it the serif on bottom and the curl
    on top like the mark. I like the mark more now than before.

  body: "The mark is nice, but seems to be emphasizing *C*lub rather than *J*barito.\r\n\r\nWhich
    is maybe OK, but it seems that Jibarito is the unique identifier and should be
    getting the emphasis.\r\n\r\nWhat if the ligature was a lower case c with it then
    up-turning into a larger J? \r\n"

  body: "Well you fixed the top heavy thing with the serif, so it hold it up a lot
    better, visually. But I do agree with some comments about the C being a little
    too big it feels. It seems like they should either get the same attention scale
    wise, or the J should get a little more. I do like the concept though. Pretty
    recognizable alone as just the symbol.\r\n\r\nAs for the name CLUB is looking
    a little spacey, of which you can't fix because C, L, and U all give themself
    plenty of \"personal bubble space\". But standing next to JUBARITO...just makes
    that fact stand out a little more. Although, good job with the J and the I...looks
    really good now.\r\n\r\ncourtney"

  body: "You have a seashell spiral thing going on with the tail of the j and the
    continuance of the C... extend the bottom stroke of the C a little, then continue
    that spiral up and around with an offset lighter-toned (grey) accent mark. That'll
    help maintain the strength of the Cj combo plus adding a \"catcher\" should the
    j start falling over. Having it an different shade will help to create more dimension
    as well. \r\n\r\nI like how your original design creates conflict, it's uneasy
    which helps create focus.  "
