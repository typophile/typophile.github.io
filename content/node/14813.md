  first official moderator shin gig), I helped inaugurate \xBBCritique Thursday\xAB
  last week.\r\n\r\nDiscussion about the idea for Critique Thursday can be found <a
  href=\"http://typophile.com/node/14608\">here</a>, and the list of the featured
  fonts can be found <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/14678\">here</a>.\r\n\r\nThis
  week, I'll shine the spotlight on just two fonts.\r\n\r\nThe critiquing will take
  place right here on Typophile, from 1\u20133 pm Eastern Standard Time (that should
  be 10 am\u201312 noon in California, 19:00\u201321:00 in Central Europe, etc.) on
  Thursday, August 25."

  body: "Chris, Typophile at work must be a touchy subject\u2026 I try to avoid it
    as much as possible during the day, but I do check it (please don't fire me :(
    \  ).\r\n\r\nBut just about any time is going to be during a lot of work days,
    I think.\r\n\r\nChris, I don't have any links, but if you click here (http://typophile.com/node/14678),
    you can see which fonts were featured. That page has links to all the fonts, and
    you can see what happened. Is that enough?\r\n\r\nDavid, I'll post the fonts tomorrow
    afternoon, Central European Time. That will be right around the start of business
    day on the East Coast, and before the other coast people wake up, I suspect."

    session will still be there in the critique threads (as always).\r\n\r\nFunny
    thing about lunch time, because traffic logs suggest those are the peak times.
    So\u2026 we\u2019re pretty sure that people are at least reading over lunch. =)"

  body: I think it's good to have a defined time to the critiques so that people can
    'dialogue', but it may be better to drop it if people take it as a restriction.
    I just posted comments to the selected topics, because I know I won't be able
    to participate later.
