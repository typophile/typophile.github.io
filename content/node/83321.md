  ornamental font is the interpretation of ornaments of Trypillya culture. Trypillya
  culture, or Cucuteni-Trypillya is an archaeological culture of neolithic times.
  Its name derives from the name of the village of Trypillya nearby Kyiv. This culture
  experienced its culmination between 5500 and 2750 BC. The Trypillians lived in the
  territories between the Carpathian Mountains and the Dniper River of the modern
  Ukraine, Moldova and Romania.\r\n\r\nMany interesting ceramics decorated with original
  geometric ornaments survived to amaze us. Its heritage is still a little unknown
  to the public and therefore the patterns that are reproduced in this font have no
  analogues in the digital format.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Trypillya_2D_720x360_02_4346.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Trypillya_2D_720x360_03_4776.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Trypillya_2D_720x360_07_6198.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Trypillya_2D_720x360_06_5477.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Trypillya_2D_720x360_01_6446.png]\r\n\r\nMore
