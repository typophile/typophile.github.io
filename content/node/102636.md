body: I am working on a design project centering around the architect and industrial
  designer Eileen Gray. She worked throughout the early 20th century, particularly
  the 20s and 30s, but greatly influenced many Art Deco and Bauhaus designers. I am
  struggling for what the best type choice would be for her. Any suggestions would
  be greatly appreciated!
