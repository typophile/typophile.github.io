body: "I am trying to try out some different text effects to use with my new logotype
  and am getting stuck on ideas. I would like to try giving it more punch, almost
  a 3-d explosiveness... but I am not quite sure how. Here are some images I am using
  for inspiration:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/treatmentInspiration_4802.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  love the look and feel of the top lightning one but fear this would be too complicated
  to try and create with type.\r\n\r\nThe WP and DC comics logo are fun but i captured
  these in motion and am not sure how i could create a logo with this feal. The lighbox
  again has a good feel but probably can't be duplicated for a logo and work on different
  mediums.\r\n\r\nThe arabic symbol or the apple seriously logo might be easier to
  try and work with, unfortunately I do not have a stylus anymore :S\r\n\r\nAny ideas
  on cool ways to spiffy up a plain blackletter logotype?"

    that personally i use something like for example top layer the text, than duplicate
    that layer and do a gaussian to it... or by glows... or by select with \"feather\"
