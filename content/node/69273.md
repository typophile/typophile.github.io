  body: b looks a hell of a lot better. But what you should really be focusing on
    is finding some way to distract people from that abomination of a logo.

  body: "That \"r\" for Sunderland keeps me stumped. There is no Sunderland there.
    With \"r\" or not.\r\nName centered works best, but overall feel of the card is
    not the best."

  body: "I've seen that font before, with that ugly descending \"t\"\u2026 some free
    font, right? \r\nI wouldn't use that, it looks like a mistake. (I'm not sure your
    font combination works anyway, to be honest.)\r\n\r\nBTW, \"fax\", \"email\",
    and \"web\" aren't abbreviations, why use a period?\r\n\r\nAlso: If you can, please
    do make all the shades of blue the same. It looks like they might be supposed
    to be the same but clearly aren't, but there's not enough difference to make it
    look deliberate."

  body: "<cite>plus you need to put an 'r' in sunde[r]land!</cite>\r\n\r\nPlus you
    need to put an 'http://' in front of www.philipreadman.co.uk.\r\n\r\n[edit] Funny,
    it does not seem to be necessary in posts but it is in the profile. I guess half
    of the Typophile profiles have invalid homepage links because of that."

  body: You should probably still split the seven digits of the phone numbers into
    three and four with a hyphen or space. It helps people to parse them and keep
    track of them in short term memory.
