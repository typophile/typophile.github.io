  body: "FWIW, 'Alison' is a modification of <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/ballantines-script/\">Ballantines
    Script</a> with a new A and G. The original letters are alternates in Alison (according
    to my Script Guide notes). 'Ballantines Script' has also been shown as 'Diana'
    and 'Goddess' (bold version) in various Dan Solo books, so I'm not clear what
    the true name actually is. I suspect it is an old film font that now exists in
    a number of versions under many names.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
