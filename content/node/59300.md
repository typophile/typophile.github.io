    more research. Where did you find the image?

  body: "There is nothing in the photo to denote scale, but I had something much bigger
    in mind than what would fit in a tank. An 88 would be a bit over 3 inches, right?
    I was envisioning something closer to 6 inches, from the photo.\r\n\r\nDon <---
