		<div class="commentbody">O.K. lots of people are going to disagree with me now, but anyway&hellip;.  <BR>  <BR>I think a fundamental understanding of writing is needed before one can begin to design typefaces. Writing, whether with a calligraphic pen or other tools help establishing a kinesthetic understanding, or, a feel for proportions and flow. Writing with a broad-edge pen will help you to appreciate the principles behind thick-thin transitions, which is essential for designing serifed text faces. A good writing manual would certainly help. Edward Johnston's <i>Writing and illuminating, and lettering</i> might be a good place to start, or Gerrit Noordzij's <i>Stoke of the pen</i>, or other good calligraphy books. After getting to grips with the principles of writing, lettering could follow. Lettering could be seen as a liberation from writing, to free oneself from the bounds of the writing instrument, but still retaining a strong tie with the fundamental principles of writing. Experimentations and explorations could then follow. <BR>  <BR>FontLab is a very sophisticated piece of software for making cutting-edge digital faces, but as a design tool it's a bit counter-intuitive. I prefer working out ideas on paper first, scan it and take it from there.  <BR>  <BR>Of course I haven't talked about spacing and kerning yet! I have no idea&hellip; I just do it by eye. But I think I did learn a lot about spacing from doing calligraphy (again, I think it's a kinesthetic thing) and rubbing down Letraset! Oh yeah, look at Walter Tracy's <i>Letters of Credit</i>. Also <i>Twentieth century type designers</i> by Sebastian Carter will give you a lot of insights about how different type designers work and give you lots of inspiration!  <BR>  <BR>Hope this helps. Gook luck!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">My recommendation is to start with a Serif rather than a Sans. To understand better the shapes and counters forms. Its not because they (Sans) lacking of contrast that they are more easy to design. You will learn more with Serif fonts.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>Adding to my first post I would like to state that the more finished your drawings are from the start are the easier your life will be when you import them to a digital format.</i> <BR> <BR>This depends on how you intend to 'import' them to a digital format. I gave up on scanners several years ago, when I discovered that even quite expensive ones introduce distortions by compressing or expanding in one direction. These days, if I draw on paper at all, I only make rough drawings to get the shape down: then I prop the drawing beside my screen and use it as a visual guide to create the shape on the computer. It was only after I had been doing this for a couple of years that I read a comment by Hermann Zapf regarding the kind of drawings he prepared for a manual punchcutter, as contrasted with those prepared for industrial production. The drawings for industrial production needed to be very clean and precise, because the individual operating the pantograph, camera, Ikarus tablet or scanner (depending on the era) was neither qualified nor expected to <i>interpret</i> the design, only to reproduce it as exactly as possible. A good punchcutter, however, is an expert interpreter: able to take a designer's quite rough drawing and create a workable typeface from it, glyph by glyph, on the end of little pieces of steel. As a result, Zapf says his drawings for the brilliant punchcutter August Rosenberger, with whom he worked for many years, were much rougher than he needed to produce for mechanical production. I believe the same is true in digital type design, especially when one is making one's own outlines: it is not necessary to produce perfect drawings if one develops the ability to interpret rough drawings directly with the computer tools.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">All of the above seems true. There are good arguments for all these points. Everyone finds their own way that works best for them.  <BR> <BR>I think, as a beginner, drawing has more freedom and can help to identify clear objectives about what one may want out their design. Experienced designers might be able to draw directly on the computer because they know where points should land after having placed thousands of them. The beginner does not have this in their arsenal yet. So I still see scanning as a good way to start even if it is necessary to interpret these to accommodate for scanner distortion.  <BR> <BR>Is is necessary to draw every character perfectly before moving to the computer? No. But but defining clear characteristics of your design does seem important to me. After these characteristics, such as a serif for example, are discovered, defined, whatever it is easy to copy and paste these in the computer from glyph to glyph. But do not do this for everything. You don't want your &quot;m&quot; to be two &quot;n&quot;s stuck together. <BR> <BR>Henriko, however you start, start with the words &quot;hamburefonts&quot; or &quot;handgloves&quot;.  <BR> <BR>Start with lowercase then move to the uppercase. <BR> <BR>-smc <BR></div>
