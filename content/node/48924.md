    I can imagine there are advantages to having such a one-step-removed, one-dimensional
    control, but would it also be possible to make the same sorts of modifications
    directly on the outlines? Or does it simply get too confusing in terms of not
    being sure what you're editing?\r\n\r\n> drop FontLab and use FontForge.\r\n\r\nWell,
    FontLab has a lot going for it, so it would be better -although I understand perhaps

  body: It seems like this continues the recent development of new tools for creating
    letters outside of tracing an outline with beziers -- Kalliculator, LivePen, and
    now this. None of these, as I've seen them so far, can really develop a complete
    font file the same way FontLab can, though. They seem like good tools for sketching
    an idea, and can take it to a pretty finished state, but there's still a lot of
    work to be done in FontLab. I hope somebody creates a tool that takes the best
    intuitive parts of Kalliculator, LivePen, and Spiro, and combines them into a
    full-fledged font development tool.

    more sophisticated way to increase their expressiveness.\r\n\r\nI'm working on
    the chapter of my thesis that includes the comparison with Ikarus, so I just made
    this graphic, comparing Spiro with the example that Karow gave in his 1991 paper
    \"<a href=\"http://cajun.cs.nott.ac.uk/compsci/epo/papers/volume4/issue3/ep044pk.pdf\">Digital
    Punch Cutting</a>\". As you can see, it takes about half as many control points
    to achieve the same level of quality. I haven't tried the Autocad spline directly,
    but from what I have been able to find, it's based on NURBS, which is a polynomial
    spline roughly similar to the cubic Lagrange spline at the heart of Ikarus. I'd
    be very surprised if the Autocad and Ikarus splines were much different.\r\n\r\nDave:
    I'm still working on the stability question. It turns out to be a more interesting
    (i.e. harder) problem than I first thought. I have some Javascript code which
    is slightly better than the C implementation, but now I'm encouraged that a different
    generating curve may actually be even more robust. I'll release something before
    too long.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ikarus-spiro_3912.png]"

    Combining parts of Kalliculator and LivePen isn't possible, since they are proprietary
    programs. How Spiro works isn't a secret, but its available under the GPL which
    means if any other program includes it, it must also not be secret. (Or pay Raph
    lots of money! haha :-) When I spoke to Frederick about making Kalliculator free
    software a few years ago, he didn't seem convinced, but there are rumours that
    he's changed his mind so fingers crossed :-)\r\n\r\nProbably what will happen
    is that Inkscape's calligraphic pen path tool will be extended from a 'one shot'
    tool to a skeletal one with much more control. There are existing efforts to add
    basic type design features to Inkscape directly too, for developing SVG Fonts,
    which will make the Inkscape -> FontForge workflow a lot smoother."

    a version of Ubuntu with no proprietary software. That way you can see what a
