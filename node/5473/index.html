		<div class="commentbody">This article completely fails to understand and explain the situation, instead quoting people &#40;eg from Razorfish&#41; on a subject &#40;font economics&#41; they know nothing about.  <BR> <BR>&#40;Yeah, we should get a union -- except as self-employed workers, that would consitute a cartel in the US, which is why illustrators and photographers don&#39;t have unions.&#41;   <BR> <BR>If Chank&#39;s font is used by a third party &#40;a small design firm&#41; to create a piece of artwork, say, the wordmark for a campaign, for a large corporation, he &#34;sells&#34; one font licence to the supplier, no matter how many times the wordmark is reproduced by that supplier&#39;s client.  <BR> <BR>If the large corporation installs his font on all its corporate computers, so that all its in-house marketing departments can use it for ongoing typesetting for their ID and marketing, then he can sell a multi-user licence for a far higher price. And if the typeface has a family, that helps sales too. <BR> <BR>This is, one would assume, what happened in the $6,000 Ocean Spray &#34;deal&#34; &#40;ie contract&#41; mentioned in the article, but the writer doesn&#39;t explain why &#34;negotiated directly&#34; is so much more lucrative, leaving it open to suggestion that it&#39;s all about Chank&#39;s mythical Elvis-like charisma and Donald-ish powers of negotiation. <BR> <BR>Chank has the right idea. As long as fonts are durable tools, type designers will have a tough, competitive retail market . <BR> <BR>If we can make fonts totally ephemeral consumable fashion items, that&#39;s a better much market. <BR> <BR>Rockstar fonts is a start, but the real money is in licensing deals with the celebrity du jour. Anyone know Paris Hilton&#39;s email address?  <BR> <BR>Or, just suppose, Joe Teen buys a new pair of Shaq-endorsed sneakers, and they come with the new Shaq blackletter font &#40;on mini-CD&#41; which he can use in all his emails &#40;or school essays&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Jim -- do you have the rights to Beckham&#39;s latest tattoo yet? Are you negotiating with Cristiano for space on his chest? Get on the job, man!</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>In a world of post-punk distressed-fontmeisters, says  <BR>Stephen Turbek of Razorfish, Diesel&#39;s work stands out because  <BR>of his range. Turbek says Diesel&#39;s work shows the mixture of  <BR>&#34;love of machines and ironic futurism&#34; that is emblematic of his  <BR>peers&#39; aesthetic. &#34;My generation is in the age when everybody  <BR>thought the future would have already happened.&#34;</i> <BR> <BR>AND <BR> <BR><i>&#34;It&#39;s a really difficult business,&#34; Turbek observes. &#34;When you  <BR>buy software, you get a box. If you&#39;re buying fonts online, all  <BR>you get is bits.&#34; He suggests that in the age of digital  <BR>distribution, fontographers might consider forming a union.</i> <BR> <BR>Seven years ago &#40;1997!&#41; when Stephen Turbek said that, he  <BR>wasn&#39;t a designer. He was one of those early fish that had the  <BR>&#34;billable&#34; people wondering what he actually did. Of course that  <BR>was a time when it was okay to have those kind of people on the  <BR>payroll.</div>
