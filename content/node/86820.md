  for an optimized result? I just heard this from a friend who claims there are specified
  steps to follow when scaling an image to optain the best result possible. He thought
  there was a 144% involved in the process, but he wasn't sure.\r\nDoes anyone have
  any information on this?"

    design, maybe someone would know. In my defence; I did post it in the 'general'
    forum ;-)

  body: Frank is right - I have been using Perfect Resize formerly Genuine Fractals
    for years and it is a great product to up sample images to achieve optimized results.
    It can easily take an 72dpi image to 200dpi or 300dpi with very good results.
