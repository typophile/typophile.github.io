  \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I added an extra glyph, f.salt. Since I've done that, I've
  realised that I need to create alternate ligatures, ie fi, ffi, fl etc.\r\n\r\nI've
  decided to create a stylistic set for the alternate f. I can get the alternate f
  working when I check it in various programs using the stylistic set, but can't figure
  out how to get the stylistic set to use the alternate ligatures rather than the
  standard ligatures.\r\n\r\nThis bit of my code works\r\n\r\nfeature ss02 {\r\n  sub
  f by f.alt;\r\n} ss02;\r\n\r\nThen I've tried to add this in but no matter where
  I add it, in the SS or the liga feature, it doesn't take effect (I've only done
  fi as the test so far)\r\n\r\nfeature liga {\r\n  sub f.alt i by fi.alt;\r\n} liga;\r\n\r\n\r\nIf
  you have any thoughts that would help I'd be greatly appreciative."
