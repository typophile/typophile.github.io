body: my first attempt at bitmap font design, so i&#39;d appreciate the feedback.
  <BR> <BR>Lila is loosely based on my mother&#39;s handwriting &#40;as based as a
  thing as tiny as that can be ;&#41;, so i&#39;m trying to recreate a handwritten
  fill... <BR> <BR>&#92;image{first draft of Lila}

  body: ' Fun. <BR> <BR>Perhaps there&#39;s a way to &#39;optically&#39; close those  <BR>loops
    &#40;rather than literally&#41;... Same problem  <BR>with the o, it&#39;s pretty
    dark. I&#39;d also point out the  <BR>bowl of the cap R is too small. Open it
    up like  <BR>the P. <BR> <BR>What if the finishing stroke on characters like  <BR>the
    h,m,n dropped a pixel below the baseline? <BR> <BR>//joe '

  body: ' I wouldn&#39;t mind seeing the apex of the lc &#34;s&#34; overshoot the
    x-height by a pixel as well. That might help it stand apart from the lc &#34;a&#34;
    and &#34;o&#34;. <BR> <BR>Aside from this &#40;and Gregory, Hrant and Joe&#39;s
    suggestions&#41;, it&#39;s a very interesting face, and I agree with Joe that
    it has great potential. It reminds me pleasantly of the old whimsical script-mimicking
    typewriter fonts, from the daisywheel and ball typewriter days. <BR> <BR>Very
    nice work! Keep it up! <BR> <BR>David '

    there&#39;s too much contrast between thick/thin strokes, but I can&#39;t find
