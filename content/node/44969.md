  that you could take a look and share some thoughts on it from the typography point
  of view.\r\n\r\nHere is the link: http://designr.it\r\n\r\nIs it pretty/pleasing/readable?
  Do you like it? What impression do you have seeing it for the first time? \r\nI'd
  appreciate any comments on it.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nPiotr"

  body: "\"What I'm twittering about\" has an end quote at the beginning (a pet peeve
    of some people). All in all, the site is nice but rather busy looking. I think
    I'd make links to a second page for the design examples.\r\n"

  body: Also, do you know the significance of the intertwined symbol at the start
    of "selected work". It was included in a musical font, and there was a discussion
    of its meaning.

  body: "The first impression is not good. There is too much text and the background
    is noise... It takes focus - make the background simpler.\r\n\r\nLovely space
    between elements but there is still too much text/information.\r\n\r\nBeautiful
    code!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "It's very nice. I'd suggest two changes:\r\n\r\n1) loose the patter as a
    background to the text (maybe set all text in a flat color background)\r\n\r\n2)
    Reverse the content hierarchy. Your work should be the primary focus. Right now,
    when the page loads, it's all the 'meta' info that has the primary focus, with
    your actual work way down at the bottom of the scrollbar.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "@<strong>fontplayer</strong> I actually removed all the unnecessary graphic
    elements. It looks better indeed. So thanks for that!\r\n\r\n@<strong>laCour</strong>
    Removing some useless text is not idea actually, note that this is a one-page
    portfolio and there are pros to this (like all the info is in one place\u2014and
    that's why you may feel like there is too much stuff).. However I'll try minimizing
    the content, so comment more than appreciated :-)\r\n\r\n@<strong>aluminum</strong>
    I'm afraid I didn't understand the first point. Is removing the pattern background
    what you meant? I'd disagree then. About the block-structure reorganization..
    I guess It's worth a shot.. I might move the right column and put it under 'What
    I do section' so I could put the selected work above the fold.\r\n\r\nThanks guys!
    I knew it was a good place to ask for help.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nPiotr"

  body: "\"Is removing the pattern background what you meant?'\r\n\r\nYes. My typos
    didn't help. ;o)\r\n\r\nText on a pattern isn't very readable. I like the background
    pattern for the site, but not the text. Maybe put the text on it's own flat colored
    background.\r\n\r\n"

  body: '@<strong>aluminum</strong> I can''t believe it causes some major readability
    issues. The pattern is almost invisible, and I think there is enough contrast
    between both, background and text. I''ll do some testing though. Sometimes it''s
    just better to try so you could see the difference. Thanks for pointing it out
    then!'

  body: "You have what they call 'scroll blockers': horizontal elements at the point
    where it might be bottom of the web browser in a lot of windows. It can cause
    people to not register that there might be more content below. Something to keep
    in mind.\r\n\r\nAs for the pattern, well, for me, yes, it's jarring and makes
    it hard to read the type easily."

  body: 'It is refreshing to see Roman lettering used well on a web-page. I feel the
    overall effect is pleasing and the javascript opening captions under the figures
    is fun. Perhaps the page needs a bit more contrast in size between the large and
    small images and fonts. The colors are too cool: gray lettering  on a gray background
    with that pale blue gives a cold feeling. I wish Typophile will change that combination
    too. Let in some of that famous Tuscan sunshine. When you are finally happy with
    the result why not submit your css concepts to http://www.csszengarden.com/ ?  Good
    luck.'
