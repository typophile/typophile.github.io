  me, but the post got canned for review, evidently because it contained a link in
  it\u2026to another thread on this same forum.\r\n\r\nI understand why precautions
  are in place to prevent unwanted spam\u2014nothing like mistaking liberty for license\u2014BUT\u2026\r\n\r\nThe
  server assured me that a human being would look at the post and vet it. Since what
  I posted was neither outrageous, obscene, blatantly commercial or certifiably loony,
  it would be nice to know that the automated message was speaking truth.\r\n\r\nSo,
  guys? Please? Restore my faith in human intervention, then delete this post.\r\n\r\n<em>Muchissimas
  gracias.</em>"

    but nobody has answered yet, so I still remain clueless.\r\n\r\nWhich should come
    as no surprise to anybody.\r\n\r\nEspecially my long-suffering wife."
