body: "Hi all\r\n\r\nIs it possible to use Robofab to generate weights from a MM vfb.\r\n\r\nI'm
  generating 6 weights from the MM fonts - Thin, Light, Regular, Medium, Bold and
  Heavy.\r\n\r\nWhile I'm developing the font I wanted a quick way to generate the
  weights with a script instead of \r\ngenerating each vfb with Fontlab - Tools >
  Multiple Master > Generate Instance > Enter the weight > Name the vfb.\r\n\r\nI
  just need a script that will generate 6 vfb from a MM vfb. The script doesn't need
  to be expandable \r\nthe weights can be hard coded into the script."
