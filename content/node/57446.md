  piece called \"You Blow Me Away\" by Jason Tozer. He printed the words \"you blow
  me away\" on 20 7mm sheets of glass & photographed how the glass broke when hitting
  it with objects like a pool ball. The lettering on the broken glass while it's flying
  through the air are just breathtaking!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/blow_01_5654.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/blow_02_6733.jpg]"
