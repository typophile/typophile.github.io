body: "Hello all,\r\n\r\nI was wondering if someone could suggest a good san serif
  match for Leitura News. Due to budget constraints I am limited to what is provided
  with the Mac OS (gill sans, calibri, franklin gothic).  \r\n\r\nThis is for a magazine.
  The logo is set in Gill Sans, but I am not sure that it looks good with Leitura
  News and Display in the rest of the mag.\r\n\r\nPlease help...we are down to the
  last hour (of course) and I have been staring at the screen and fonts for so long
  that I think my eyes are deceiving me.\r\n"
