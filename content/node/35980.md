  body: That's a tough call. The vertical lines are kind of the basis of designs like
    Grand Canyon and <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/font_bureau/constructa/">Constructa</a>.
    I'm not sure an italic would look so good. As for sans serifs, <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/font_bureau/antenna_compressed_italic/">Antenna
    Compressed Italic</a> has a similar tall, straight-sided form.
