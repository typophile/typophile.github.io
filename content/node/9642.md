body: Im trying to work out how to pull out pages from a InDesign CS document and
  keep the pagenumbers. So if the document is 100 pages long and the pages are numbered
  and I pull out page 20 to 40 and save it as a new document and I still want the
  pages to be numbered from 20 to 40, how do I do it?
