  on our computers at my job. Is there anyway we can get around viewing these files?
  Because when we open them up they are all crazy language.  Or do we just have to
  update to the newest version of word.\r\nAny info would be great. \r\nThanks"

  body: Thank you. We are probably going to have to update. That is if the clients
    get annoyed that they have to backsave and send again

  body: Word 2007 can save files in the old .doc format. It can be done individually
    for each file by using Save As, or [[http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word/HA102406831033.aspx|there's
    a setting]] that makes Word always use .doc instead of .docx. Or you can download
    the [[http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=6b9238e1-cf69-48c4-bf2d-c4a8aceee520&DisplayLang=en|Open

  body: Good advice from HHP. I have the same problem sometimes. I just drag the Word
    file onto my TextEdit icon and it opens right up. I'm not worried about formatting
    because I reformat it anyway.
