  body: "Hi Elena,\r\nI\u2019m curious, too. We <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/50176\">had
    this one before</a>:\r\nThe masthead on the <a href=\"http://www.anothermag.com/\">AnOther
    Magazine website</a> states that all its font design is by <a href=\"http://www.alias.uk.com/\">Alias</a>
    ([[Gareth Hague]] and [[David James]]). This typeface isn\u2019t listed on their
    site, so I\u2019m afraid it is custom.\r\n\r\nRelated typefaces include <a href=\"http://www.pfadfinderei.com/font/nicola-kroita-zucka#/0\">Nicola
    Kroita Zucka</a>, <a href=\"http://www.lineto.com/The+Fonts/Font+Categories/Script+Fonts/Easyscript/\">Easyscript</a>,
