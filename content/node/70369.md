body: "I decided to source out the branding part of a a new e-commerce project for
  a client. I'm somewhat pleased with the work produced so far as is the client, but
  I feel there's something missing. None of the concepts produced strike me as great.
  Some are better than others, but even the better ones are lacking that polished
  feel. I'm stuck here and not sure what direction to take, so I've signed up for
  Typophile to see if I can get some feedback from the community.\r\n\r\nOf these
  concepts, which ones are your guys favorites and why? What would you suggest doing
  to improve them? I know the type needs a lot of work, so that would be the first
  place I'd start. Any ideas for the symbols?\r\n\r\nThanks guys for any feedback
  you can provide.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/buyitbuildit_01_4380.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/buyitbuildit_02_4594.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/buyitbuildit_03_6289.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/buyitbuildit_04_5454.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/buyitbuildit_05_6551.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/buyitbuildit_06_3848.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/buyitbuildit_07_4485.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/buyitbuildit_08_4731.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/buyitbuildit_09_5090.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/buyitbuildit_10_6727.jpg]"

    natural stone, tile, cabinets, hardware, crown molding, etc. Once you've made
    your purchase, they pair you up with a contractor performs the installation."

    out the identity with your designer. \r\n\r\nIf you don't know what's missing,
    and you didn't even think it was relevant to tell us what the company did before
    asking us to evaluate the proposed work, well, I'm sorry to have to tell you this,
    but you're what I'd call a total nightmare client. \r\n\r\nYour designer is the
    one you should be talking this through with, not us. Frankly, the conversation
    should be directly between the designer and the owner of BuyItBuildIt. \r\n\r\nThe
    designer can't create a mark to represent a concept unless the concept is perfectly
    clear; THAT is exactly what's \"missing.\" The concept becomes clear throughout
    the design process; and what you're doing here? You're asking a bunch of random
    strangers what the concept is! I can't think of anything more disruptive to logo
    design than your approach, dreamten. If you want a terrific result, trust your
    designer. \r\n\r\nI just checked out your website, and I was shocked to discover
    you've done identity design yourself. How would you have reacted if a client posted
    your preliminary sketches here?\r\n"

  body: Why are you assuming that I <em>haven't</em> talked this through with the
    designer? The concepts above are the result of our many back and forth conversations.
    We reached a point with funding that the revisions could continue no more, which
    is why I reached out to this community.

  body: Steve, thanks for the reply.  The designer, client, and I are all in agreement
    about this version being the best of the bunch.

    use the cheap effects from the last few samples. They instantly turn the logo
    into kitsch. "

  body: "No problem :)\r\n\r\nI agree with penn and ink. The effects inside the letters
    are alright, but I don't think the reflection is necessary at all. The type on
    the very last one looks better than the one I mentioned, so I'd go with that."

  body: "Page 1 C\r\nPage 2 C\r\n\r\nThis icon strongly conveys (to me) what you're
    trying to say in three ways:\r\n\r\n1. It's like an instruction manual that's
    folded out\r\n2. It's made of up four parts (1-2-3-4) and Buy It Build It is 1-2-3-4.
    A subtle visual rhythm...but its there in the syllables.\r\n3. they evoke a staircase,
    and that says a lot of things: journey, process, structure... Now only if it were
    slanted to ascend...ascension is what the customer will get when they build their
    creation.\r\n\r\nConsider your staircase idea and refine it.\r\n\r\nI'd also look
    at how to treat the name. So far, you've always got the \"I\" in \"It\" in uppercase.\r\n\r\nBUYitBUILDit
    reads well to me also (not in this typeface, of course, but as a case treatment).
    I want the punch to be on the BUY and BUILD. \"It\" is subordinate and hangs onto
    its parents. BUY it BUILD it. See how it sounds out loud, and thats how it should
    read in your head.\r\n\r\nPage 2A is also good but I'm not convinced that there
    needs to be a double house. One house tag says it all. You might even let it dangle
    at an angle. That rhymed!\r\n\r\n...you could even have it dangle from the title.
    Being playful wouldn't hurt -- most of these examples feel corporate and stiff.
    The lyrical playfulness of BuyItBuildIt is betrayed by the upright, geometric,
    symmetrical examples."
