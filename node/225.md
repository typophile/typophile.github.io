  recommend for a font management program  <BR>and why? What is best for X?

  body: After some mixed experiences with FontReserve on OS X,  <BR>I&#39;ve been
    doing without any sort of add-on font utility for <BR>the last six months. <BR>
    <BR>Basically, what I do is keep all of my fonts in a large  <BR>organized collection,
    with each family in its own folder.  <BR>When I want to use a font, I just drag-copy
    its folder into  <BR>my user Fonts folder. &#40;In OS X, you can keep fonts in  <BR>folders
    within the Fonts folder.&#41; Most apps will update their  <BR>font menus automatically.
    For those that don&#39;t, just quit  <BR>the app and start it up again. When I&#39;m
    done using a font, I <BR>just put it in the Trash &#40;I still have the original
    with the rest  <BR>of my collection&#41;.  <BR> <BR>If you rely on auto-activation
    or use Classic a lot, this may  <BR>not be for you, but it has a kind of elegant
    simplicity that  <BR>appeals to me.

    sweet, with options to search for fonts in  <BR>your library by classication,
    designer, period, etc. On a few  <BR>occasions I&#39;ve wished Suitcase could
    do this. &#40;&#34;Show me all  <BR>the scripts,&#34; for example.&#41; <BR> <BR>However,
    Suitcase has been just fine for me. Stable and  <BR>everything. But if you&#39;re
    using any Classic apps still, expect  <BR>some weirdness with font management
    across the two OSs.

  body: I&#39;m one of those strange people that actually owns Suitcase, Font Agent
    and Font Reserve. I&#39;m also strange enough to admit that I loaded and unloaded
    each of them at least twice while getting used to OS X. Font Agent was s-l-o-w!
    And from what I recall I had to leave to open. &#40;Someone correct me here&#41;
    I still think Font Reserve, even with the scrolling weirdness, is stronger than
    the others. I also really appreciate that they can control the system fonts and,
    AND, their tech support is quick and friendly.

    package. On a semi-related note, I&#39;ve always wondered why something like font
    management, which seems fairly close to the OS level, shouldn&#39;t be included
    with the OS. I appreciate competition with regard to software, but part of me
    thinks Apple could do a dandy job if it would include some sort of font management

    version of FontAgent Pro. It&#39;s pretty slick, but there are a couple of drawbacks
    I see so far. First, it&#39;s slows up launching and shutting down, since it has
    to do some database management thing that FontReserve never did. Second, libraries
    and sets are a little confusing, but I think once you get used to the difference,
    it&#39;s probably a powerful feature. Third: you have to keep the program running,
    apparently, all the time; FontReserve is &#34;transparent.&#34; Fourth: when a
    font is auto-activated in FontReserve, you can tell it&#39;s active because it
    has &#34;active status&#34; in the program window; with FontAgent, an auto-activated
    font does not show up as active, which is kind of weird. Fifth, the auto-activation
    in Photoshop is, by the company&#39;s admission, buggy, but they claim it will
    be better with Photoshop 8 &#40;!&#41;. I should send this list of concerns to
    them. Positives: intuitive, cocoa platform and interface; font player is excellent;
    wysiwyg menus are very helpful; customizable specimen sheet was something I always
    wanted in FontReserve but never got &#40;you can customize type color and background
    color as well!&#41;; a tiny download; easy to set up and use.'

    back to FontReserve. I think FontAgent has serious potential, but FontReserve
    is just more transparent to the user, facilitates easier exporting and importing
    of fonts, and is much faster. Exporting fonts in FontAgent Pro and shutting the
    program down was very slow. FontReserve is extremely quick. Also, the character
    map in FontReserve is very helpful. Some features in FontAgent are quite nice,
    such as the Font Player, font diagnostics, and its generally prettier, more OSX-like
    interface. But Reserve just seems better still.
