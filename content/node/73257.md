  The tilde-like form seems to be most common usage, but in some typefaces (e.g.GFS
  Porson) an upwards bending bow appears instead. \u2013 Just a matter of taste? Of
  specific typographic tradition?\r\nAny thoughts welcome."

    and not much room for accents, use the inverted breve form, because the tilde
    form combined with psili or dasia makes for a horribly cramped composite accent.\r\n"
