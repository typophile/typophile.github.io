  body: "This isn't working for me:\r\n\r\n- The mark isn't aligned at all with the
    type.\r\n- The elements in the mark are all drawn in different styles, with different
    line weights, and look \"cliparty\".\r\n- The big guy looks like he's punching
    the little guy in the head.\r\n- \"TLAfrica\" means nothing to me.\r\n\r\nTry
    going with the full name \"Transformational Leadership\". Your mark doesn't need
    to be as literal as this, and it doesn't need as many elements. Simplify.\r\n\r\n

    it is they do in their logo. If you do, it will look cluttered and be far too
    confusing for it to be memorable.\r\n\r\npenn"
