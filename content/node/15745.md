body: "Hello. \r\n\r\nI'm just posting to ask if anyone has any suggestions or critiques
  for the form section of a trifold I'm putting together for my university:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.bleasedesign.com/junk/medici-trifold-051019-d.pdf\r\n\r\nI'm
  incredibly interested in typography, but the majority of the information I've read
  in books and seen online deals more with setting type for display and body copy\u2014not
  necessarily forms meant to be filled out by end users. If you know of any information
  online about setting type for forms or good books, I'd definitely appreciate it
  if you could share.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The Clear English Campaign has some guidelines on form design, some of which
    should be taken with a pinch of salt because they don't really get into the technicalities
    of using fonts. They recommend 12 or 14 pt (which they call friendly) without
    any consideration of x-heights etc, but then it is a guide for non-typographers.
    There's some useful advice about use of language though, and structure and pattern
    which could be of some help.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.plainenglish.co.uk/forms.html\r\n\r\nAnthony"

  body: "Hi, \r\n\r\nI find it pleasing to look at and mostly well-spaced. You might
    consider leaving more space above the signature lines. My signature would not
    fit length or height wise in the space provided. \r\n\r\nLikewise, It might be
    useful on the \"name(s)\" line to specify first and last, especially if someone
    is going to be entering this information into a database. It can often be difficult
    to figure out which is the first/last name and many people write them inverted.
    \r\n\r\nI find that the \"Y\" of \"Invite you\" nearly obscures the word \"patron\"
    which I think might be something you'd like highlighted. Perhaps consider moving
    \"to become a patron and supporter\" down a bit or shifting things left/right
    so that the y overlaps \"become\" or \"and\" rather than \"patron\".\r\n\r\nAnother
    suggestion -- where you ask for expiry date -- maybe consider stating m/y -- again,
    for clarity. (Think: 06/07 or 07/06?)\r\n\r\nWhat typeface are you using?\r\n\r\nKristina."

    body: "Kristina\u2014\r\n\r\nI'm using Myriad for the body copy and Trajan and
      Edwardian Script for other, with Porcelain (freely available from <a href=\"http://www.misprintedtype.com\">Eduardo
      Recife</a>) for the caps on the Edwardian.\r\n\r\nI will definitely add in the
      clarification for first and last name and the expiry date, and also keep working
      with the \"Invite you\" section on the far left panel on page 2. I'm not terribly
      happy with it as-is and may be scrapping that typesetting for something better
      if I can come up with any decent ideas.\r\n\r\nT"
