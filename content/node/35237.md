body: Why is the color red so prevalent in book printing, particularly design books?
  Is there some reason that a two-color job is so often done in red and black? Is
  red ink just the cheapest solid around? Or is it just a tradition?

    and still easily readable."

  body: Also, red is hard to get wrong. When you specify a blue or green, it can easily
    end up looking very different than you thought it would. You don't really get
    surprises like that with red, and even if you somehow end up with a different
    shade of red than you intended, the impact is essentially unchanged.

    Apparently this color--made from mercury sulfide--was at one time as expensive

    of manuscripts. '

    contrast colors, with red and white being second highest, making red a good 'emphasis'
    color in 2 color printing.\r\n\r\nShifting towards blue is too close to black
    and shifting towards yellow is just not high enough contrast for text against
    white. \r\n\r\n"

    to have curative powers. \r\n\r\nThe story is pretty fascinating. The mineral
    from which vermilion or true Chinese Red is made, [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinnabar|Cinnabar]]
    (mercury sulfide), is believed in traditional Chinese medicine to have curative
    powers. It was once very rare and expensive, and perhaps because of this and its
    beautiful color, was prized as a medicine. \r\n\r\nThe [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dantian|dantien]],
    literally the 'Cinnabar field' or red field, is an area between the navel and
    pubic bone that is thought to be the key source of energy or 'qi' for internal
    organs, and is supposed to be the key to power in the martial arts and in qi gong,
    the traditional Chinese 'energy exercise' or meditation. \r\n\r\n[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qin_Shi_Huang|Qin
    Shi Huang]], the first Emperor, who unified China, built the Great Wall, burned
    books and buried scholars alive, and has the famous terra cotta army guarding
    his grave in Xian, tried to live for ever. He regularly ate pills containing Cinnabar
    to achieve immortality. Modern doctors believe that, ironically, it killed him.
