body: "Okay, I have a font in my collection that I downloaded from a free font site
  many years ago and unfortunately, I don't remember the website's name and numerous
  search engine searches turned up nothing.  I want to use it in a commercial work,
  but can't find any licensing details on the font at all.\r\n\r\nThe font attached
  below is named \"Judith\", at least according to the filename, what it shows when
  I preview the font in the Windows font viewer, and what is stated in file properties.
  \ Additionally, according to the file's properties > Details tab, the font is copyrighted
  to a \"Brendel Infomatik GmbH\" in 1994.  The file version reads: \"Brendel    :03.05.1995\".\r\n\r\nI
  want to know if this font is indeed called Judith and what licensing is there?  Does
  anyone recognize the font?  Anyone know more about it?\r\n\r\n"
