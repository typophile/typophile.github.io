body: I am trying to create a logo for a zoo in Ohio. It is called "The Wilds" and
  this is what I've got so far. Anyone have any suggestions at all? I think I could
  use some help.

    to design your logo in a vector application so the logo can be used at any size.\r\n\r\nTo
    me, a zoo is a place filled with fun and adventure (and animals). If I wanted
    to see four blades of grass, I could go into my backyard.\r\n\r\nI'd take a look
    at some existing zoo logos for inspiration, then start again.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: To be honest, this is just not very good.  Judging by the way you've chosen
    to present this - jaggy lines, bad typography, three colors when one would do
    - the suggestions we would give you would be pointless.  How did you create this?  Do
    you have any sketches?  What class is this for?

  body: The image is really bad - but the idea isn't, IMO.  Try grabbing a pen & paper
    and sketching it out, instead of using the computer.  I suspect it'll look a lot
    better, and will be easier to give constructive feedback on.

  body: umm...still not sure what those are supposed to be. Antlers? Snakes? Not sure
    a zoo is the type of entity that should have an abstract logo.

  body: "I think the updated version is a big improvement over the first one.\r\n\r\nMy
    first guess when seeing this was zebra tails. Not sure if that's what you want,
    but it makes total sense, provided that there really are zebras in your zoo. \r\n\r\nThe
    typography has also improved a lot. The green colour block behind \"theWilds\"
    seems like a very natural colour choice and makes total sense to me.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.designbits.de|Webdesign

  body: "Surely antelope antlers forming a W? \r\nIn the second iteration the form
    is showing much better but I believe they should be distinctly pairs of antlers
    rather than the same \u2018pair\u2019 reflected. I think that reinforcing the
    crossed W in the text is too much. It is the kind of logo/client that could benefit
    from having the same basic treatment \u2013 animals or parts of animals used to
    create a character \u2013 it has legs (no pun intended), but the illustration
    has to be really spot on.\r\n\r\nTim"

    idea about showing the ears is brilliant; I think a 'W' and animals connection

    logo tools do make the difference.  Vector is needed, no matter what vector, but
    that's how logos need to be constructed.  Logos must be scalable.  Pixel-designs
    don't allow for lossless scaling.\r\n\r\nBefore you say tools don't matter, I
    think you would have a hard time typesetting a PDF magazine of all you had to
    work with a a ziploc bag of cut-out construction paper fonts from the foundry.
    \ I think you'd be singing a different tune."
