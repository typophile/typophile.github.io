body: I can&#39;t get LWFN fonts to work on my Mac &#40;10.3&#41;. I can drop them  into
  the fonts folder in the library &#40;no, not the system folder&#41; but they don&#39;t
  show up in FontBook or Illustrator when I open the document. I can&#39;t drag them
  into FontBook either. <BR> <BR>Please help.

  body: 'Nathan, you also need the suitcase file &#40;the ones with &#34;FFIL&#34;
    on the icon&#41;. These contain the bitmap fonts, metrics &#40;spacing, kerning,
    etc.&#41; and other important information. OSX doesn&#39;t have much use for the
    bitmap info, but the font is incomplete without the rest. The LWFN file contains
    only the PostScript outline and hinting data &#40;mainly&#41;. <BR> <BR>In pre-OSX
    lingo: The FFIL file is the screen font file and the LWFN is the printer font
    file. You need both parts to install a PostScript font on a Mac, even on OSX.'
