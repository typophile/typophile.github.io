  Monday promo video... Typeface ID? \r\n\r\nIt looks so much like Frutiger, but it
  isn't. \"Pack up the Wives,\" looks almost like Futura. The \"c\" terminal edges
  are canted inward and the \"a\" and \"e\" are a strange match to the rest of the
  characters I think.\r\n\r\nLost...\r\n\r\n-mike\r\n"

  body: Bye the bye, I am *assuming* that the "BIG LOVE" typeface is the same one...

  body: I believe both the show's title and the promo in question are set in Adrian
    Frutiger's Avenir, which he (or someone) once described as "a better Futura."
    So you spotted the correct influences, even if the name of the font itself eluded
    you... ;)
