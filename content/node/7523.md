body: hi people, <BR> <BR>i am desinging a masthead for a new interior design magazine.
  it is supposed to be a high lifestyle and sophisticated kind of magazine. the client
  wants me to design it with typo only. could anyone suggest me a font which would
  go with the culture and concept of the magazine &#40;elegant and very modern&#41;.
  i was thinking of rotis&#40;semisans or sans&#41; by otl aicher.  <BR>please guide
  me. thanks in advance. <BR> <BR>it is titled as &#34;better interiors&#34;

  body: Udaya, I&#39;m afraid Rotis can be considered neither modern nor elegant.
    You might want to look at Seria &#40;Sans&#41;, Fresco &#40;sans&#41;, Eureka
    &#40;sans&#41;. And yes, they all happen to be Dutch designs, but that&#39;s sheer
    coincidence. Hopefully this will get you further in your quest...

  body: 'I think Rotis &#40;but not the &#34;full&#34; Sans&#41; might actually be
    a good choice here because: its narrowness will help with the long name; and I
    think it does look elegant and contemporary &#40;I&#39;m not sure what &#34;modern&#34;
    really means here&#41;. On the other hand, it&#39;s been overused, and it will
    probably need some tweaking to look just right. So I think you might keep looking
    - and hopefully get some more help here. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: Whatever your final choice I would urge you to convince your client to invest
    in someone with skill to manually readjust the letterforms of the final setting
    so that the logo becomes a logo. The double t in Better will need some work as
    most likely ther ri and rs combinations in Interiors. It need not cost a fortune,
    but it should be looked at.

  body: Udaya <BR> <BR>Take my advice and skip the flowers!!!. And If you stick with
    Rotsis sans &#40;which in my opinion feels so &#34;80ish&#34;&#41; do adjust <BR>it
    into a unique form. Good luck! <BR> <BR>Cheers
