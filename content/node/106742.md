  a site you never visit. They are by far the largest intellectual property rights
  violator in the world, with the excuse that they cannot control what users post
  on their site.\r\nThey are owned by Google, which to my understanding was the second
  company to start collaborating with the NSA, whom we all know to be watching us
  for our own good.\r\nThe idea that we all deserve what we want for free is an absolute
  corruption of what is fair and just.\r\nAnd yes, I am on a bit of a rampage\u2026

    now pays royalties when videos with music are viewed from its ad revenue, making
    it as legitimate as any radio station.\r\n\r\nAnd many interesting videos on YouTube
    are entirely the creation of those who posted them; e.g.\r\n\r\n[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53Cs9raoZKs]]"

  body: "Look up any Miles Davis piece posted by some \"fan\". They are paying royalties
    to Columbia and Miles' estate? No, they are not. They will take down a video if
    you catch them, probably in the case of new major artists they pander to them
    and pay them. You will notice that new major artists don't have videos posted
    by \"fans\".\r\nLook up my name - Paul B. Cutler - I am on there plenty of times
    with the bands The Dream Syndicate and 45 Grave and have never received one dime
    and never will. I guess I could spend the rest of my life tracking down violations
    and getting them taken down, I'd rather generate newer works. I even started a
    page there and now have thought better of it.\r\nLook up any of Jimi's old songs
    - you can find anything. Do you think they are paying royalties to his estate?
    No, they are not.\r\nThey are the largest intellectual property violator in the
    world, perhaps not if you are a current major label artist. If you are a legacy
    artist your catalogue is worthless.\r\n\r\npbc\r\n"

  body: '@quadibloc -- Would work, indeed. ''Course, with YT, I need not swap discs
    all the time, plus I get to watch clips like this, which I doubt I would ever
    have seen otherwise: [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPBaqh3dcVM]]'
