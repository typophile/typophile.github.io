body: "Hi Everyone \u2013 I have recut a headline regular and italic font. I'm having
  trouble creating a family with them in Font Lab. I have, from what I can see, correctly
  named the fonts. I imagined that with the right naming they would automatically
  form a family when installed on fontexplorer, fontbook etc. but maybe not?\r\n\r\nIs
  there an easy way to make a family? \r\n\r\nAny comments would be much appreciated.
  \r\n\r\nThanks  \r\n\r\np.s. Bear in mind I'm a beginner in fontlab and could be
  making any number of errors."

  body: Delete the word Expanded in the Style name. Also your Italic font has 30 characters
    in the PS name. While this is to spec, going over 28 characters in the PS name
    does create problems in older applications. Also one of your Full Names has an
    extra space in it

  body: "Thank for the response. I have now checked and double checked the naming
    but seem to be having the same problem. \r\n\r\nis the there a specific way to
    export the fonts? or do you just have to generate fonts in the usual way?\r\n\r\nI
    have also put below some screen grabs of the naming: \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture-4_4400.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture-5_3610.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture-6_6012.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture-7_5159.jpg]"

  body: "That should work, you probably need to blast your font caches. Try the following:\r\n\r\n\u2022
    Uninstall all of the fonts you have generated. (never install unfinished fonts.)\r\n\u2022\_Clear
    your font caches\r\n\u2022 Reboot\r\n\u2022\_Test the fonts by copying them to
    your Adobe fonts folder (/library/application support/adobe/fonts). Add them one
    one at a time, starting with the regular font.\r\n\u2022 Once they work in Indesign
    try installing them. If they still don't work test them with through MS Font Validator
    and FontQA."
