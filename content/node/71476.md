  but the client's logo (which uses it) WILL NOT BE MODIFIED (the clients words, not
  mine). And we have to find a typeface that 'goes well with it'.\r\n\r\nWe've been
  looking for a while, but nothing has seemed right. Any suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!"

    Extended</a>.\r\nIt is low contrast, has sharp little serifs, and the Extended
    matches Serpentine's width in the lower case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
