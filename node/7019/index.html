  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">okay so i'm kinda excited to post this one, hopefully it won't flop too hard. anyhow, this is my first sincere attempt to develop one of my own original ideas for a face. this one was actually inspired, in part, by a thread here on typophile (<a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/43155.html" target="_blank">Display vs. Text</a>). <BR>it got me thinking about reading speed and what my own thoughts were on the ideal font for reading quickly. i based the design on my own hare-brained thoughts on the subject, no research of any kind was performed, so thankfully no literate people were injured in the creation of this font. anyhow for me the ideal for speed would be an italic, as the slant supposedly keeps the eye moving forward. however the decorative nature of the italic hampers speed in reading, or so they say. i hate the sloped roman breed with a passion, so i tried to come up with something inbetween a sloped roman and a true italic. i'll let you judge on whether or not i succeeded. <BR>besides the slant, i thought that a serif structure that moved from top to bottom and left to right would also keep the eye moving forward. and i dreamt up this serif structure so that the letters in a word would interlock (hence the working name). <BR>anyhow, that's probably more than you really wanted to know, so i'll spare you the rest and let you go ahead and look at it. i'm rather happy with the results thus far, but i'm sure i have plenty to improve upon. help me find those areas. thnx for looking! <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/50588.gif" alt="gif sample"> <BR> <BR><!--attachment: interloc-50589.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*429.6*pdf+sample*interloc%2epdf --><center><table border=1><tr><td><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_pdf.gif" align=left alt="application/pdf">pdf sample<br><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/interloc-50589.pdf" target="_blank"><b>interloc.pdf</b></a> (429.6 k)</td></tr></table></center><!--/attachment--></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Now this is interesting. Bravo, Paul. <BR> <BR>Although some of the mechanics of reading you're assuming aren't based on any actual findings (as you readily admit), much of what you've arrived at speaks very dearly to my heart, and mind. If you search for &quot;Harrier&quot; in my Daidala interview* you might see some interesting parallels. Your stuff is a lot less rigid, and has some traditional overtones - makes me think of the first half of the 20th century, like Gill. <BR> <BR>* <a href="http://www.daidala.com/25apr2004.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.daidala.com/25apr2004.html">http://www.daidala.com/25apr2004.html</a></a> <BR> <BR>Basically, this is <i>exactly</i> the type of work I very much hope catches on in the world of type design - it makes me happy to see you go in this direction. <BR> <BR>Some specifics: <BR>- If this is a book face, I'd make it slightly darker, and I'd pull in the descenders a bit. <BR>- Tighten the spacing significantly - apply the concept in the name!* <BR>- The bottom of the &quot;t&quot; is malformed. <BR>- The &quot;c&quot; is nothing short of charming. <BR>- The ear of the &quot;q&quot; looks spliced in. <BR>- To me the &quot;a&quot; is too self-conscious. <BR>- The &quot;w&quot; is very nice. <BR>- I'm surprises that I like the &quot;f&quot;. But do make it wider. <BR>- The &quot;d&quot; seems somewhat constructed. But I think you should keep it. <BR>- The &quot;y&quot; needs more size, and a stronger tail. <BR>- I think the &quot;r&quot; is very good. Maybe a stronger beak. <BR>- The &quot;s&quot; is indeed leaning too much, but its narrowness is superb. BTW, try making the &quot;e&quot; narrower. <BR>- I'm unsure about the tail of the &quot;j&quot;. <BR>- The &quot;g&quot; is amazingly good! I'd make the ear stronger, and expand the bottom bowl more to the right. <BR> <BR>* BTW, &quot;Interloc&quot; (&quot;Interlocq&quot;?) is interesting - I'm assuming it derives from the semi-serifs interlocking. <BR> <BR>Paul, please take this all the way. But be prepared for many people to not understand. <BR> <BR>I dare say I think you've got what it takes to make a mark - which means you should plan some contingencies for a life of poverty and obscurity.  ;-) <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks William. Anybody who wants to buy a pre-release version of Harrier can contact me; that's actually how Paul himself got a hold of Patria for his newspaper. <BR> <BR>An upright version of Interloc would indeed be interesting - the problem is the serifs: putting half-serifs on totally upright strokes makes the font lean backwards. You can see this problem clearly in some of H E Meier's work. In Avance Bloemsma solves it by putting flares on the opposite sides -which however gives a certain feminine/calligraphic skew- although that might actually work great (better than Avance, and certainly better than Harrier would) in Interloc. The other obvious avenue is leaving a very slight slant (maybe 1 degree) in there - but that causes problems in lo-res rendering. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;there's a range where the slant is neither here nor there  <BR> <BR>I don't really agree with this. Syntax has a 1/2 degree slant and you can still 'feel' it even though you don't identify the source of the dynamism. The eye is extremely sensitive to verticals, and the slightest variation, I think.   <BR> <BR>I suspect that if this is too slanted it will never be used much for text, only display. The slant now is a bit dizzying, but this might have other causes, I don't know.  <BR> <BR>Note that Jenson is slanted on one side (bottom left, top right), so that some slant can work well for text. The assymetrical serifs of Jenson could work for an upright version. Check out also <a href="http://www.teff.nl/fonts/trinite/trinite.html" target="_blank">Trinite</a>, a fabulous piece of work with some slant and assymetrical serifs.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">William, that's sort of what I meant. Half a degree is well below the zone I'm talking about, so it's &quot;seen&quot; (by virtually everybody) in the heart and not the mind. Above a certain degree (maybe around 2) it's the other way around. It's the range between those where the slant might flip-flop between visible and subvisible (even within one individual, certainly between different people), and I think that might be disconcerting, or at least unpredictable. <BR> <BR>Also note that the visibility of slant (just like anything else) is greatly determined by scale: the larger the size the more &quot;conscious&quot; it gets. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

<p>in keeping with the speedreading theme, i&rsquo;m thinking i just may make a fully upright version and designate it as the italic. my thinking being that the full uprights impede speed, slowing down for items of emphasis. i just need to draw up the x and maybe a few bits of punctuation and then i&rsquo;ll see about figgering how to make a pdf accesible to look at a text setting.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">First reactions. You have &lsquo;tamed&rsquo; the design a bit in a good way from the first version. The ascenders seem too tall for this design. It seems like the a needs some kind of beak like the c and r and like your old version. The current Optima-like terminal I think is a bit light. Zapf himself gave the a in Optima a beak in the new Optima Nova! The top right of the e seems heavy. The k is awkward.</div>

<p>I think:</p>
<ol>
<li>The &ldquo;a&rdquo; is not entirely happy. Don&rsquo;t know why.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s some clotting at the stem-bowl joins of &ldquo;b&rdquo;, etc.</li>
<li>The &ldquo;g&rdquo; needs more zing. Maybe a more aggressive bottom and/or a spiky (Goudy-style? You like Goudy) ear.</li>
<li>The tail of the &ldquo;j&rdquo; is moping.</li>
<li>The &ldquo;k&rdquo; I actually find admirable.</li>
<li>I might do something about the serifs of the &ldquo;m&rdquo;.</li>
<li>&ldquo;r&rdquo;: stronger beak. But no wider.</li>
<li>&ldquo;s&rdquo;: maybe more zing too.</li>
<li>&ldquo;t&rdquo;: higher head.</li>
<li>Maybe give a twist to the middle part of the &ldquo;w&rdquo;.</li>
<li>The &ldquo;z&rdquo; is totally out of character. It&rsquo;s not even leaning!</li>
</ol>
<p>An upright for emphasis: this is not a bad idea, and I&rsquo;ve actually seen it applied (although at the typesetting level, not the font level). The most accessible example is the English inserts of tipoGrafica. But a word of caution: in a body of italic, upright settings actually look slightly backslanted - very disconcerting. So your upright should actually have a slight slant, maybe 1 degree. Oh, and I&rsquo;d keep the semi serifs!</p>
