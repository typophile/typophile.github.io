  body: What a wealth of work -- thanks for posting this! It's interesting to see,
    in some of the ads, decorative and artistic styles from the late 19th and early
    20th centuries applied to Cyrillic lettering. And it's not often that one gets
    to see graphic design or advertising from pre-Soviet Russia.

    see that the pre-Revolutionary Russian commercial artists were connected to what
    was going on in Paris. Maybe we\u2019ll get lucky and someone will do a book about
    pre-Revolutionary Russian design!"

    got it working in Safari too. It seems the filenames of the images are identifying
    them as advertising. Once I figured that out, I disabled AdBlockPlus for that
    page and reloaded it, and now it works on Firefox."
