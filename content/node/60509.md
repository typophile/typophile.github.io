    The A here looks (badly) customized. If this is a font, the k should be a good
    clue. Still looking..\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Searching freebies at Dafont I found [[http://www.dafont.com/lauren-script.font?nb_ppp=50&classt=alpha&text=Akademiks|Lauren
    Script]], a shareware font by De Nada Industries. I think it matches the lower
    case fairly well if you add a loop to the d. I think the A is a hand-drawn monster.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Thanks. Ya, with a heavy stroke, the lowercase of Lauren Script is pretty
    close, although I think there are many variations on this script style.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    where can I find the \"hand-drawn monster\" font? ;-)"
