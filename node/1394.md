body: 'I&#39;ve never run into this before so I thought I would ask the experts. I
  want to purchase a font but I have two font houses that I can select from for the
  same font package. I know the reasoning behind why there are two but don&#39;t know
  if one font house &#40;in my case adobe or berthold&#41; is better than the other.
  Is there any difference in the quality of the type? What types of things do I need
  to take into consideration when given choices of font houses? Any input would be
  greatly appreciated.  <BR> <BR>Note: I&#39;m looking to purchase at Philsfonts which
  has been highly recommended to me, but have never purchased there before.'

    target="_blank"> &#40;sic&#41;</a>, an instrument where thin strips  <BR>of wood

    redesigned and expanded his popular Barmeno  <BR>family for FontFont, but had
    to change the name to  <BR>FF Sari to avoid being sued by the new owners of the  <BR>Berthold
    Type library. See <a href="http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/berthold.html" target="_blank">
    aforementionned article</a>: <BR><i>Berthold made FontShop change the name of

    1 and 2&#41;, which evidently must have cost  <BR>Fontshop some money and embarrassement.
    The name  <BR>change was because FF New Barmen was too close to  <BR>Barmeno,
    which is a Berthold font. As Apostrophe  <BR>puts it: &#34;I can only imagine
    the stream of curses  <BR>that went through Hans Reichel&#39;s head when he was  <BR>told
    of what happened.</i> <BR> <BR>Which in short means he doesn&#39;t own his creation
    anymore.  <BR>Same thing happened to Albert Boton who <i>can&#39;t use  <BR>his

    in the Berthold type  <BR>library is called Boton.'

  body: I agree hhp. I started doing design work when Apple IIe ruled and Bitstream
    was the only font house. I still have the original ps fonts from them. Please
    no dinosaur jokes! <BR> <BR>So, Yves, you wrote about going to the source. Should
    I then be looking at FF Sari or stick with Barmeno? I had found a font example
    that gave enough character yet elegant simplicity for a logo I need to design.
    Michael Yanega &#40;bowfinprints.com&#41; was kind enough to identify it for me
    and put me on to this site. I started searching for Barmeno and found out about
    the Berthold &#34;scandal&#34; and also about the original type designer. <BR>
    <BR>The font doesn&#39;t have to be perfect &#40;it&#39;s going on tractors and
    excavating equipment&#41;, but I&#39;m such a type-aholic that when I buy a font
    I want to get the best one out there at the best price I can afford. Notice I
    did not say cheap, low cost always helps...but quality is always first with me.
    And thanks for spending the time to explain all this.  <BR> <BR>So given all the
    controversy is there another font I should be looking at that would have a similar
    character? Or should I go over to FF? <BR> <BR>BTW, bored--absolutely not. I wish
    I had time to learn a lot more about the fine details of type. I found all the
    articles very informative and enlightening. It would have been great to have these
    kind of places to go to when I was first starting out. I&#39;ve learned more in
    the last week about type than I have in the past 5 years. Thanks all!
