    body: Thanks. Both of these are close but neither is as wide as the original.
      The 'n' is also very distinct. Any other guesses?

  body: "I think the 'simple N' Stephen noted could have been a modification of the
    normal N, or even an inverted U with an added corner, although I notice the crossbar
    on the A and H are higher than normal too.\r\n\r\nOne could cobble together a
    very close approximation starting with Futura Display. Tasse, on the other hand,
    would be more of a  trick, especially because the S has more curves to it. (Tasse
    does have similar alternate characters for the A and N, which you can't see in
    the FontShop samples, but that N is like the unmodified Futura Display N, and
    would also need modification.)\r\n\r\nMy guess is either a customization, or a
    font based on Futura Display that may be freeware. This falls in the 'Techno'
    style category, in spite of its true age (designed in 1932), so many squarish
    fonts made for this clich\xE9 (Techno = square) look might be very similar.  It's
    almost as bad as hand-printed lettering fonts -- anyone can make one with little
    or no skill.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: This feels more like lettering or photo fontage than a mechanical scaling
    of a digital font. How old is the sample, jcon?

    body: 'The sample is recent. I pulled it from a travel ad for Honduras in a recent
      travel mag. I like it cause it has a blocky, hand-done quality that you see
      on street signage in Latin America. Thanks to everyone for the input. I think
      I''ll start out with Futura Display and tweak it. '
