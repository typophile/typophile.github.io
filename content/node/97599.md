body: "Going through Microsoft's diacritic design standards( http://www.microsoft.com/typography/developers/fdsspec/diacritics.htm
  ), one notices Adam T's name quite a few times when Polish accents come into picture.
  The hyperlink's are supposed to explain the design of Polish accents by Adam T,
  but when you follow the links nothing happens. The website( http://www.font.org/
  ) asks you for a username and password.(Whaaat?) So Adam or anyone associated with
  font.or website can throw some light on this?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nT"

  body: The links to Polish diacritics in Microsoft website  direct to the font.org
    website. But I got them anyway from A Twardoch's  website. So yeah, the post is
    pointless.
