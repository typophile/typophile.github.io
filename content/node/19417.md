body: "Heres a question for ya. Actually my professor asked it. \"If you maximize
  the x-height, ascenders and descenders of a particular glyph, does that mean the
  glyph gets larger in measurement?\"\r\n\r\nMaximize=increase the length vertically.\r\n\r\nMy
  thinking is no because the width and the stroke contrast remains the same.\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas guys?"

    does that mean the font gets bigger?\u201D\r\n\r\nHow would the font get bigger
    if you only made a particular glyph bigger? I am confused. Also, if you are talking
    about optimizing the use of the whole EM for small point sizes to make them read
    better, you maximize the x-height att he expense of the ascenders and descenders."

    measurement gets smaller, like cod condensing, the stroke contrast wouldn't remain
    the same though. I think you need to put the question in a different way.\r\nTim"

  body: "You changed the question. (And added the \"maximize\" elaboration.)\r\nWhat
    did your prof ask, exactly?\r\n\r\nAnyway, now it can potentially make sense,
    and the answer would be \"no\",\r\nbecause the font has to fit within its size-less
    bounds*, and making all three\r\nparts bigger in an instance makes nothing bigger
    in the abstract.\r\n\r\n* Except if it's a swoopy, dainty script face. But still.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
