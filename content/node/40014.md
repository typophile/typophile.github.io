  body: "I think this looks like Comic lettering, but maybe that's just because it
    is only using caps. I searched MyFonts and Dafont for Comic fonts and found some
    'close-but-no-cigar' choices: <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fonthead/flim-flam/\">Flim
    Flam</a> from Fonthead; <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/pizzadude/bigmouth/\">Bigmouth</a>
    from PizzaDude; <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/blambot/pro/\">Blambot
    Pro</a> (and many other choices from Blambot), including the free font <A href=\"http://www.dafont.com/digital-strip.font?nb_ppp=50&text=BOHO+boho\">Digital
    Strip</a>. Iconian Fonts also had a good selection of free comic fonts, including
    <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/action-man.font?nb_ppp=50&text=BOHO+boho\">Action
    Man</a>.\r\n\r\nI'm never sure how much people want the exact font, or just a
    similar look. For hand-lettered fonts, our <a href=\"http://typophile.com/forum/typeid/faq\">
    Casual handwriting FAQ</a> says it all.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
