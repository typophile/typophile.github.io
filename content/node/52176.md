  'accidentally' used it and already use it in another publication. Client has ok'd
  so am looking for something similar. Thought Freight Sans would work, but the 'e'
  is not the greatest. Benton Sans is also close, but ridiculously expensive. Neither
  offer a semibold. Am using it in front of book, back of book and 2 areas for display
  (this is where the e is noticably yucky). Anyone?\r\n\r\nA"

    one of our publications owned by a different client and can't use it again (this
    comes from higher up). Unfortunately the client for my magazine has already seen
    & approved the layouts with Whitney. Basically I'm trying to do a swap for something
    just as beautiful with only the internal team really noticing.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\nA"

  body: Thanks all. I'll take a look at these. I know, Whitney is a beautiful typeface.
    Sigh...

    scheme is different, but Benton Sans covers pretty much the same range as Whitney:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/WhitneyBentonSans_comp2_3659.gif]\r\n\r\nTobias
    Frere-Jones was working on Benton Gothic (precursor to Benton Sans) about the
    same time as Whitney, so there's a bit of Benton DNA in Whitney."

    It's not too much more than Whitney when you buy more than one weight at a time.
    Font Bureau gives discounts as you add weights and <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Benton+Sans\">FontShop
    offers packages</a>. \r\n\r\nOther good suggestions from Mikey (SUF). Also <a
