  for me.\r\nMy first chalenge is to build a page layout for a magazine.\r\nI want
  to create a Relationship between Headers/Indent/body.\r\nI want inicialy start with
  free fonts (but we could use commercial also- I like minion for the Body by the
  way).\r\nModern/Serious/Traditional/Formal\r\nIts a magazine for medical articles
  that will be mostly text with small illustration or photos.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\nAnt\xF3nio
  \r\n\r\nPS- Any links for articles/tutorial of this subject please let me know."

    now this is a very subjective issue, but I want some opinions about fonts.\r\nWhat
    I used here, what I saw there. The body in minion will be fine with the header
    in Arial and you could try to place the indent in italic helvetica, etc.\r\nSince
    this is a medical magazine with articles I need some Modern/Serious/Traditional/Formal
    fonts.\r\n\r\nThanks in advaced\r\nAnt\xF3nio\r\n"

  body: "\"The body in minion will be fine with the header in Arial and you could

    the body in Minion, then you should choose either Helvetica or Arial for heads
    and indents. Use the regular italic and/or bold for the heads, contrasting or
    matching the indent depending on the tone you need for the content. E.G. if it's
    a softer story, use Helvetica regular heads and regular or italic for the indent,
    or when you've got something harder, use the Helvetica bold for heads and sightly
    condensed italic for indents. If you want, you can also get a Minion Bold Condensed
    of some sort for heads. If you get enough Minion, you could easily do the whole
    thing in Minion for a Modern/Serious/Traditional/Formal magazine for medical articles.\r\n\r\nCheers!"

    magazine design lingo, or as a "standfirst" by the Brits.

  body: "Technical journals often use Times for body and Helvetica for heads and subheads.
    Particularly if they haven't been redesigned in the past 20 years.\r\n\r\nYour
    choice of Minion and Helvetica would be a definite improvement, and would still
    maintain the comfortable look to your medical readership."

  body: "New chalenge!\r\nNow that I choose the type all minion, or minion + helvetica
    what about the best size and number of colums for cientific articles?\r\nFrom
    my early studies\r\nA4- 1,5cm from the border (all 4 sides), 2 colums with 8,5cm
    each (1cm in the middle).\r\nOpinions?\r\n\r\nI'm also considering to add a picture
    (or illustration) for each article in order to have a  more \"colored\" magazine.
    Not sure what to do in terms of sizes and place to put. Of course I can move them
    throw out the magzine but any suggestions are welcome (read someplace that they
    should not be placed in the middle (?!)).\r\n\r\nAnt\xF3nio"

  body: "Two columns sounds right for the line width you describe. You might find
    1 cm gutter between to be a bit much. 1 pica is traditional and I think 1 cm is
    over 2 picas. Do a test and see, you might want to cut the gutter to 0.5 or 0.75
    cm.\r\n\r\nMany articles in scientific works start with an abstract, and this
    is traditionally set in a single column. Use a larger type size and an indent
    so that the line measure does not get to be too long.\r\n\r\nIllustrations can
    be either one or two columns wide, as appropriate. A 1 column illustration in
    the middle of a two column layout can be problematic, as you have been told, because
    the word spacing around then (where the type goes to a half column) can be too
    loose.\r\n\r\nWhat you really need to do is to build a dummy page now, to see
    how things look. Post the PDF and we will be better able to comment on it."

  body: 'Is that set solid? I think Minion, being pretty dark, will look better with
    some leading. Also the abstract all in italics is too much for me as a reader.
    The more usual would be to have it in a smaller size, indented on both sides.
    Minion has optical sizes, so you could take advantage of that. '

  body: "After seeing the first example, I was going to suggest the indenting of the
    abstract, which you have done on the second example. I suggest trying it at double
    the amount ... it may not look better, but it is worth a try (your goal is to
    keep that line of text in the 60-90 characters per line range, to improve readability).\r\n\r\nAlso,
    some publications will use italics for the abstract to signify it is not a part
    of the article itself. I'm ambivalent on that one myself. Blocks of italic can
    be harder to read, but a visual signal of uniquness is useful."
