  body: "David's suggestion is closer, in my opinion. <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/quaint-gothic-sg/\">Quaint
    Gothic</a> from Spiece Graphics has an alternate face. Between them you should
    be able to get pretty close, with some added underlines and maybe a curled L or
    two.\r\n\r\nThere is also Letraset Willow, but I think the Quaint Gothic is closer
    to most letters.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    idioms, better than Dutch or French, Yves."
