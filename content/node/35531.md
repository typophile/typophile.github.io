  \ \r\n\r\nAny suggestions for parking near the Crown Plaza?  I know parking in Seattle
  can be tricky and expensive.\r\n\r\nAlso, are there many other students attending
  Typecon?  I go to Hampshire College in Amherst, MA but I'm a Seattle (well, Everett)
  native.  Last year I was living here in Seattle when Typecon was in Boston, and
  this summer I'm living out near Boston, but I just had to come back for Typecon
  in my hometown!\r\n\r\n-Molly"

  body: 'I think you can find parking lots east of the hotel (on the other side of
    I5) which will probably charge you $10 to $15 per day. Hate to think where the
    closest free parking might be. If I really wanted to avoid parking hassles in
    Seattle then maybe I''d consider a park and ride + Sound Transit or the Sounder
    train?    '

  body: The nearest un-metered parking is on Queen Anne, about 4 blocks north of the
    Seattle Center. That doesn't help much, I know, but it's better than nothing.
