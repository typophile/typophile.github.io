  this font.  It's similar to Exocet, but I'm really hoping for a closer match.  Any
  help would be appreciated.  Also, any other font matching websites I should be aware
  of?  I've used whatthefont and identifont with no luck. Thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/46251e4ed0c9cc2209e74e1eb6a907e0_15567_5757.jpg]"

  body: that *is* excocet, it's just squashed and blurred all to hell.

  body: "Thank you for responding.\r\nI'm pretty sure that it's actually not Exocet,
    there are many small differences:\r\nI not sure if I have all the terminology
    right, but:\r\nThe W in Exocet has horizontal ends to the terminals.\r\nThe middle
    bar of the E is shorter than in Exocet.\r\nThe ends of the C are vertical in Exocet.\r\nThe
    serifs are quite different on many of the letters.\r\n\r\nDo you think it is a
    modified version of Exocet?  If so, is there software I could use to try to attempt
    to duplicate it?  I'd hate to have to photoshop everything, there's a lot more
    text to it than just this.  I really need a nearly identical font for the application
    I'm working on.\r\nAny other ideas?"
