body: "I am designing a printed matter to go over a vynil case to display information
  which has to be readable and i decided upon combining a serif font (something like
  baskerville for details) with a sans serif (which would be folio medium) for main
  info.\r\n\r\nDo you think this is a nice choice?\r\n\r\nI have no idea if there
  are any pairs out there which usually work well together, but i figured i want to
  do something which is not strictly usual.\r\n\r\nI am also trying to use types i
  already have or that i can download with open licence cause i don't want to have
  to buy any as i am pretty sure there are plenty of nice types available for this
  matter.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you guys think or if you have any recommendations.\r\n\r\nthanks!"
