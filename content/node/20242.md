  sharing this link for several reasons:\r\n\r\n  <em>\u2022Overall I'm impressed
  with the use of Type and Design on his website and for his marketing/merchandise.
  For a new label <a href=\"http://www.marauderrecords.com\">Marauder Records</a>
  they've created a sophistocated feel with a contempary look that has a resonating
  \"coolness\" about it. \r\n\r\n  \u2022I definitely dig the music and thought some
  of you might too. As far as I know he's still fairly \"unknown\" and    If you like
  Ryan Adams and the Alt-Country-Rock sound, you'll probably dig his sound. That's
  a very broad description though.</em>\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to listen, there are
  4 songs streaming at: <a href=\"http://www.purevolume.com/jamierandolph\">Pure Volume</a>\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso
  I'd like to try and start a topic conversation about excellent use of typography
  and design in Music Merchandising and Marketing... What are your thoughts? \r\n
