  of the Benton Pantograph, owner of the [[Benton Waldo Type Foundry]] of Milwaukee,
  and father of [[Morris Fuller Benton]].\r\n\r\nL. B. Benton was born in Milwaukee,
  Wisconsin, the son of a newspaper editor and publisher. At a very early age he learned
  to set type and studied jewelry repair. In 1873 he bought the Northwestern Type
  Foundry after it went bankrupt and began to learn the type founding business. He
  was an extremely meticulous and precise person who even lamented the fact that steel
  would slightly change size if one breathed on it. Reportedly he had an office boy
  whose sole task was to keep the pencils on Benton's desk sharp.\r\n\r\nHe invented
  several pieces of equipment; one, the delineating machine, had to be demonstrated
  to the U. S. Patent Office as it was thought to be a mechanical impossibility. He
  is best known for developing the [[Benton Pantograph]], a pantographic cutting machine
  or engraver originally designed to cut punches for type, and later adapted to cut
  type matrices. The machine was licensed by the [[Linotype Co.]] to cut matrices
  for their casting machines. \r\n\r\n"
