body: "Toshna is a garaldic typeface design offering three real optical weights. The
  display weight for titles and headlines is kept very tall, thin and graceful. The
  book weight for body text is drawn essentially wider, more round with robust, bold
  details. \r\n\r\nToshna Std (characterset) is distributed by [[http://www.astype.de/s/toshna_std/show.php|astype]]
  and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/astype/toshna-std/|MyFonts]]. \r\nToshna (Pro)
  is available exclusively through by [[http://www.germantype.com/cms/front_content.php?idcat=76|GTF]].\r\n\r\nThe
  printed specimen book is featuring an extensive article in English and in German
  about the type designer Herbert Thannhaeuser. The edition is limited to 500 copies.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.germantype.com/cms/front_content.php?idart=285

  body: It's a lovely face, very elegant and finished, but you offer no bold and bold
    italic, and your price is too high for freelancers to purchase by themselves--and
    they are the taste-makers you want to target. This face occupies an especially
    crowded field, and competing faces are more complete, more extensive, and better
    priced.

  body: It's not THAT outlandishly priced, and not everything needs a bold or bold
    italic. But that's just my opinion, and I'm not an art director or typographer...

  body: Actually, every text-use family DOES need at least two weights, with matching
    italics, in order to attract wide use. Adobe's new Arno Pro, an obvious competitor
    in your "look"...just see how complete and developed that family is, and at a
    much better price! FF Clifford and H-FJ Requiem would be much bigger news by now,
    used much more extensively, if their foundries had finished their work and had
    released them with extra weights. This is not a small issue industry-wide.

  body: "@ John\r\n\r\nOld thread, but I had a closer look to Toshna these days. Great
    typeface! With and without other weights. And Clifford is one of the very rare
    fonts, about which I would say, that they are perfect as they are. Clifford is
    simply an absolute masterpiece! Except from that I wonder, whether it is possible
    to create a worthy semibold  partner for Clifford because of its darkness. Clifford
    IS finished. I really would not waste my time with creating semibold styles for
    Clifford just for filling an expectation of the market."
