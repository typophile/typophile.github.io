  just not sure how much I can get away with before it turns into a character that
  native users won\u2019t want to use or won\u2019t recognize. But then I look at
  all the crazy stuff people do with cedilla and wonder if I can push Ogonek the same
  way. How far can I go with the Ogonek? \r\n\r\nIf anyone can share examples of really
  great Ogoneks tweaked to fit a display face I would love to see them!"

    from fonts where a curvy hook looks kind of tacked on. But with the exception
    of United, this sort of font usually don\u2019t contain an Ogonek."

  body: Wow, I never noticed that crazy ogonek in stern. But how can one go nuts with
    a non-chirographic ogonek and have it still look like an ogonek?
