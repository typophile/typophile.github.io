  body: "As far as I could find I don't think this is Garamond, Granjon or Sabon,
    although the last is the closest. In most cases the 5 is wrong, or the 6 is not
    fully closed, or the 3 shape isn't right. Galliard is another possibility. I am
    having trouble finding sites that show the full range of glyphs, including OSF
    numerals, so it is hard to confirm any hunches. I am using FontShop's FontBook98,
    because it includes Adobe and Berthold fonts. It also seems that Caslon may be
    a candidate family for these numerals, although the OSF bold 0 seems to have a
    round counter.\r\n\r\nDo you know the age of this sample. Am I seeing inkspread,
    or a poor scan?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Unfortunately I don't know the origins of this. The person I got it from
    needs to scan it to further process the contents and for that purpose he needs
    to have a font that would help his OCR reader to understand the contents. Apparently
    the ones are especially a problem. I tried to ask for more information or if possible
    some letters, but haven't heard from him. I assume a Garamond would do for his
    purposes, but now I'm curious to know this elusive font myself. I'd guess it's
    not very old, max 20 years or so. He talks about printed material, that could
    be either a printout or a book\u2026"
