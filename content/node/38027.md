    a look at identifonts search with the key <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/similar?5DD\">\xBBFont
    similar to Black Boton Bold\xAB</a> or the excellent Fontfeed-Feature from Stephen
    Coles <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fontfeed/archives/extra-bold-ultra-black-fonts/\">\xBBExtra
    Bold to Ultra Black Fonts\xAB</a>, especially the category \xBBThe Blackest\xAB
    (Scroll down). \r\n\r\nBTW, without the redirect-thingamajig it is verryvery easy
    for us users outside the USA to visit the fontshop.com-fontfeed. Wasn't always
    as comfortable. Thanks. "
