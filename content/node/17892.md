  body: It is a very close match to <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=ITC.119148.0.7&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=big&sampleSize=96">ITC
    Franklin Gothic Demi Condensed</a>, except that the counter in the top of the
    "g" is rounder. The tail on the "g" looks slightly different, too. It may have
    been modified.
