body: "Greetings, fellow typophiles. I have a question that verges on the edge of
  legality, but I believe remains within the realm of moral responsibility. If you
  believe that this is not so, let me know, and I'll gladly withdraw the request.
  My situation is this: I've bought a suite of Mrs Eaves a while ago, with ligatures
  and small caps as separate TT files, and would now like to combine them into one
  OT font. I know of the existence of the official OTF version offered by the foundry,
  but can't justify spending so much for something I already own. I've just started
  learning FontLab, and wonder if the process would have to be too labor intensive,
  of if there were a trick in combining fonts.\r\nThanks in advance."

    - devil's advocate, converting for a different OS is okay, but converting for
    the same isn't?"

  body: "Legalities/morality aside, it also depends on how much your time is worth.
    I've changed a lot of our old Adobe Type 1 fonts into OT, and I started much closer
    to the final product that your proposed starting point. For example, we had already
    made \"database\" Type 1 fonts -- all glyphs in one font, but not named properly
    for OT. I also used programming to do the name changes (in a PFA font format),
    so once I had a list of names I had used consistently in Type 1 fonts -- like
    oneoldstyle -- and the proper OT name to replace it -- like one.op (for \"oldstye,
    proportional\") I just ran the program & the names were changd in both the font
    & metrical data.\r\n\r\nTo make an roman and italic OT font, writing all the features,
    making up & kerning extra stuff for fractions, superiors, etc. etc, takes me 2
    to 3 eight-hour days. And this is with flat, pairs kerning, not class-based kerning.\r\n\r\nIf
    your time is of much value -- that is, if you can sell it for anything -- you
    are better off re-buying the fonts. So why don't we do that? Ah. We're in a specialized
    business, and and I have to rework even the most recent OT fonts from Adobe, like
    Arno. Arno, roman and italic, standard only, took me one flat week (40 hours).
    To be fair, much of the extra time was due to the complexities of Arno (including
    the changed naming system used in it), but some of those complexities are also
    in a font like Mrs. Eaves. For example, how do you handle the small-caps numbers?
    Switch them along with the small caps? Not a good idea in our line of work. Switch
    them separate with a Stylistic Set? Now you have more documentation to keep track
    of & write so me plus our other 2 comps will know to access them. Petite caps.
    And on & on.\r\n\r\nWith \"our\" Arno, I wound up with far fewer features & less
    kerning, but I did have what Adobe had left out that would cost us six hours per
    book in our specialized work. If I could have just paid Adobe an extra $500 to
    add what we needed, we'd have been money ahead. But Adobe is sensible; I doubt
    they could do what we needed for $1,000 or more, so we are money ahead. Plus I
    now have a font that i can go back into & add characters when one of our customers
    decides they want to use Arno for a text with transliterated Devanagari.\r\n\r\nUnless
    you have this kind of need, and are far more experienced with writing OT features
    & using Fontlab than you say,  I'd suggest you spend the money to buy the new
    OT font. "

  body: And you've written all the feature code, so things work with OT savvy layout
    programs? And the characters all properly named so if you want to pull text from
    a PDF you can get it? Or prepare an XML file from the source files? Fast work
    indeed.

    oldstyle and lining. But last time I looked, Mrs. Eaves had all three. So what
    feature did you use to access them?\r\n\r\nAs far as \"stealing\" Adobe's feature
    code, I don't think they would mind particularly. The old code from AG is pretty
    much the same as the examples that come with FontLab. Beyond that, we discuss
    ways to write code on this forum; we expect others to use what is helpful.\r\n\r\nAnd
    the naming conventions aren't exactly Adobe's property either, but it does pay
    to read what they've published about how an extraction of text from a PDF file
    works.\r\n\r\nWhat everyone is concerned about is that you agreed to abide by
    certain conditions when you licensed the right to use some software -- in this
    case, a font -- and have now shown a willingness to go back on your word.\r\n\r\nCharles
