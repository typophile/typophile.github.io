  body: "You've done pretty well. Tough to space a clarendon in general!\r\nHere are
    a few ideas:\r\n\r\n1. Use a real apostrophe (not the ' )\r\n2A. There are two
    ways of approaching this spacing, one is to make things as evenly tight as you
    can and not worry about stuctural space troubles (like the AR combo). This is
    pretty much what you're doing now. One way you might help this is to modify the
    letterforms for better spacing. Reduce the serifs between the A and R. Or, eliminate
    the left R serif completely (might be too weird).\r\n\r\n2B. The other approach
    is to space everything based on your loosest pair (AR). Space ARD, figuring where
    the D should go. Then add the W and so on. The overall spacing will be looser.
    You may decide the logo looses impact with looser spacing. The only way to get
    more even spacing without modifying letters is to loosen.\r\n\r\nHope that helps.\r\nRandy

  body: "I just took a closer look at your word and I think you'll need to do a combination
    or A and B (above):\r\n\r\nTry the following:\r\n1. Begin by tightening every
    combination up so that it is tight but not touching.\r\n2. Reduce the two serifs
    between the A and R. (then make tight but not touching)\r\n3. Add a serif to the
    right side of the middle stem of the W (it is emphasizing the bad spacing on the
    WAR combo)\r\n4. Add a little space between the W and A\r\n5. Extend the serifs
    slightly on each D (but keep the tight but not touching). Add more to the ED,
    and only a very tiny bit to the RD. This will improve the spacing but keep the
    logo lockup nice and tight.\r\n6. Narrow the point of the apostophe and wedge
    it down flush betweet the D and S, you may need to shave off the top.\r\n\r\nShould
    give you a nice tight lockup.\r\n\r\nR"

  body: "Hi Randy and thank you for help!\r\n\r\nThis font called Anubis and I'm not
    a professional typographer to spoil somebody's work by intervention in it's serif
    structure, so I accept playing with kerning only. Even though it's a logotype
    after all.\r\n\r\nThis is a real apostrophe. And I've checked all the signs included
    in the font. There is only such apostrophe.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile I've tried the 2B
    instructions.\r\nIt works good with 3-4 letters. However putting near an additional
    ones cause an optical spaces disorder. So I have to work with all the letters
    together.\r\n\r\nAs it seems now on that file I've attached earlier - are there
    any small corrections to do before it's done???\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n"

    That's because I realised that each designer has his own preferences regarding

    be the one of my own.\r\nAnyway <a href=http://www.photo-b7.com/up/misc/edwards/logo5.jpg>here
    is what I've done</a>\r\n\r\nNick Shinn, you are right about the apostrophe. I
    have already tried that. However, this logotype doesn't have any symbol attached
    to. So its' font and general shape must be recallable. and I think that apostrophe
    above the text helps the logotype be much recallable. It makes a kind of \"jump\"
    which is reminded first when I think `bout the logo. What do you think?\r\n"

    the leeway for personal preference in <cite>variance</cite> of spacing is essentially
    very tight (being largely confined to perceptual mechanics, where all humans are

  body: "I agree with Hrant. That WA is too loose. \r\n\r\nI wonder about the apostrophe
    - Do you need it? After all Saks is Saks not Sak's. Maybe there is a trademartk
    reason for going with it. Is there? If you do keep it I think the placement of
    the mark will signal the preceived expensiveness/class of the logo. Having it
    up there is jarring & looks like a cheaper/less classy mark. If this is a 'family
    restaunrant' as they euphemistically call themselves ( or some other business
    trading in value over prestige) and cheapness is the point. Maybe keeping it there
    makes sense in that case. If on the other hand this is a logo for a business where
    presitge & class matter then I would move that puppy a little lower."
