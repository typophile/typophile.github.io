  body: "The D is most unusually formed. I don't think I have seen those initials
    before. The N looks like it had the curls 'grafted' on, and for that reason I
    am inclined to think the initials are hand-drawn. The rest of the lettering looks
    like it could come from either a script font, or an italic of a serif font, but
    they are not distinctive enough for me to recognize them.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
