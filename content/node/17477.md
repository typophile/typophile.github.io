  body: I'm fairly certain what swash characters are...and have checked typowiki to
    no avail. Could we get an explanation for those of us not 100% on what we're designing

    nature of the battles so far. I figured the cut-and-paste thievery was appropriately
    inappropriate. I know it's hard for typophiles to read words rather than examine
    faces, layout, etc, but I'm sure you noticed it says pomo. Isn't tacky what pomo
    is all about? Anyway, I'll take my punishment.

    was obviously out of place, but was used so confidently that it somehow seemed

    a conscious, confident decision, the viewer has no choice but to accept it!'
