body: One aspect of the new T26 website is a bestsellers page, and there is some wierd
  stuff on there. OK so I understand the &#39;spiderman&#39; font must be popular,
  but I never really thought of script typefaces being what T26 is all about. <BR>

  body: It has been my experience that scripts and hands are generally better selling
    typefaces &#40;measured by unit sales, rather than dollar value&#41; regardless
    of the foundry, designer, or distributor. What T-26 is <i>about</i> has slowly
    changed &#40;...perhaps even grown up?&#41; over the years.

  body: Another thought ... when the &#34;pseudo-written&#34; style first started
    becoming more of a trend ... or at least the way I remember it ... it was during
    the grunge period &#40;excuse the term&#41;. Perhaps those who couldn&#39;t grasp
    the grunge style by the horns found this style of &#34;pseudo-written&#34; one
    way to feel a part of the movement and yet maintain some beauty and so-called
    elegance at the same time?

  body: I didn&#39;t finish! hehehe. <BR> <BR>As Stephen mentioned, and I agree with
    him, in it&#39;s own way t-26 showed adult tendencies by trying to appeal to the
    masses. Well, at least on one level.

  body: 'Tiff, the script phenomenon is huge and multi-faceted: Grunge, post-structuralism,
    &#34;non-professional&#34; buyers and font makers, retro, post-print; -- many
    reasons for it.  <BR> <BR>Is it as big in Europe as in North America? '

  body: Jim, that list is scary. It says more about T-26&#39;s clientele than them
    &#40;I hope&#41;... <BR> <BR>BTW, what do you guys think about that Tension? <BR>I
    mean compared to de Groot&#39;s Punten. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Punten looks better executed, more coherent. <BR>Tension is just a serif face
    with random spikes. <BR>IMHO.

  body: Nick, you are absolutely right. In my rush to add my own &#34;advertising
    age&#34; 2 cents, I overlooked a lot. What is equally humorous is that I live
    in the center of &#34;craft&#34; country. Perhaps another facet would be those
    &#34;crafty&#34; &#40;and let&#39;s not forget Martha&#41; people that have created
    a desire to add words to their pages by using quasi-handwritten typefaces.

    that is increasingly &#34;non typographic&#34;.  <BR> <BR>&#40;This is not meant
    as a diss of script typefaces, but they ARE the least typographic of type genres,
    in that they don&#39;t offer the sophisticated &#34;palette&#34; that a traditional
    serif family does.&#41; '

  body: The number of scripts on that list could be due to last year&#39;s <a href="http://typographi.ca/000513.php#000513"
    target="_blank">T.26 script promotion</a>.  <BR>Unfortunately the Typographica
    link to the sale is dead, but all of the scripts on the  <BR>bestseller list were
    part of the sale.  <BR> <BR>Remember, we don&#39;t know when the counting of sales
    began - somehow I doubt it  <BR>was from the birth of the vendor.
