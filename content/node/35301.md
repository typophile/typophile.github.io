    distinctions* and they may be possibly too obvious; but they certainly are a potentially
    important points of difference when choosing a font: \r\n\r\n- degree of Historical
    Resonance\r\n\r\n- greater or lesser comprehensiveness of glyph support ( all
    or partial Latin A, Latin B, Greek, Cyrillic, etc )\r\n\r\n- Italic vs. Sloped
    Roman or Other\r\n\r\n- availability of Number models: Old style, Lining, Tabular,
    Hybrid etc.\r\n\r\n- range of weights\r\n\r\n- Capital support: ( Small caps,
    All Caps)\r\n\r\n- Availability of pt size or use specific design ( display vs
    text vs small text - that sort of thing )\r\n\r\n- suitability ( or lack suitability
    ) to set text regardless of style label ( see Haas Unica vs. Helvetica or Arial
    ) rather than just titles or pull quotes etc.\r\n\r\n- suitability for a given
    type of reproduction: paper type, kind of printing, screen use etc.   \r\n\r\n-
    contextual, language specific, or other substitutions if it's Opentype\r\n\r\n-
    degree to which Notan seems to play a role in the design\r\n\r\n\r\n* The style
    distinctions which you are looking into are somewhat soft anyway...\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso,
    there have been threads on Typophile which dissected the notion of the 'Humanist'.
    If you do a site search of typophile on google you may find useful comments that
    way. "

  body: "Grotesque sans faces are the original sans faces. The strokes of these faces
    often appear close to being \u201CMono-width\u201D, that is to say lacking tapers.
    This is not to say that there are no tapers, just that the tapers do not have
    the sort of personality in a humanist sans. These typefaces speak to mechanisation
    of production and the removal of elements considered extraneous.\r\n\r\nNeo-grotesques
    further the mechanical nature of the grotesque, stripping away all possible personality
    to create a neutral typeface that allows the content to stand out. Helvetica and
    Univers are the kings in this category. \r\n\r\nA humanist sans face is a sans
    face based on handwriting. These faces feature the subtlety of letters crafted
    by a calligrapher. Many people consider humanist faces to have more personality
    and human warmth than grotesque or geometric sans faces.\r\n\r\nGeometric sans
    faces are sans faces constructed from basic shapes. They may be purely geometric
    and mono-width or carefully and technically tapered and tweaked in the manner
    of a grotesque. Kabel is of the former, Futura the latter.\r\n\r\nThere are also
    new sans categories appearing. Typefaces like Gotham and Neutraface are of some
    new category of vernacular sans types, based on letters used or created by people
    other than type designers. Work such as Erik Spiekermann\u2019s typefaces\u2014Officina,
    Meta, and Unit (with credit to Christian Schwarz)\u2014have combined features
    of grotesques, neo-grotesques, and humanist types to spawn a new hybrid sans category.\r\n\r\nTry

    to argue that distinction. James Mosley has [[http://typefoundry.blogspot.com/2007/01/nymph-and-grot-update.html|demonstrated]]:
    \"As for the Caslon \u2018Egyptian\u2019 type of 1816, or maybe a bit earlier,
    which was certainly the first sanserif printing type to be sold commercially,
    it was not as isolated or as novel as people sometimes make out. By that date
    Egyptians, or sanserifs, were everywhere, in books and engravings and lithographs,
    and on buildings and sculpture, and as I\u2019ve said, even on maps.\" And Gill
    Sans started as letters for bookshop signage.\r\n\r\n(Sorry for nitpicking at
    your thorough and helpful answer to the original post!)"

  body: "I really wouldn\u2019t categorize the earliest sans typefaces as grotesques.
    They fit more into a proto-grotesque category, overlapping nineteenth century
    jobbing types, existing handwritten and carved letters, and painted signage. To
    me the grotesque category solidifies much later, when punchcutters had adapted
    the designs to the letterpress after several generations of type.\r\n\r\nI see
    the same happening now with these new faces. At some point designers whose ideas
    about what a sans face should be are influenced more by the fonts Gotham and Neutraface
    than by the vernacular forms that inspired them will produce the next generation.
    We can see this happening with typefaces influenced ny, or in what appears to
    be the case with Unit directly descended from, Meta.\r\n\r\nAs an analogy, there
    are typefaces that straddle genres like the work of Beethoven. It starts out as
    classical, softens up and starts throwing in new ideas to become something else,
    and eventually becomes the foundation for the romantic movement in music."

    are plenty of them out there waiting in the wings, and I suspect that we\u2019ll

  body: ">A humanist sans face is a sans face based on handwriting. \r\n\r\nThis is
    misleading. The proportions and modulation of humanist sans are, as Nick says
    in his piece, based on old style serif printers typefaces, with the serifs taken
    away. These typefaces in turn are based on hand writing, but a very special, formal
    hand: the revived Carolingian Miniscule with roman caps. The modulation of line
    in old style type is has many differences from the handwriting that it is based
    on. "

  body: "Previous to specific cultural uses, such as the definition of a <em>lettera
    umanistica</em>, the basic meaning of humanism contrasted man with God. It seems
    to me that in the context here it visually contrasts man with machine, machine
    being represented by the letterpress type forms of grotesque and geometric. In
    that sense, any hand written or hand drawn sans serif may be considered humanist.
    Comic Sans, for instance. Or consider Eras -- not directly based on the old style,
    but with strongly organic, chirographic qualities.\r\n"
