body: "So i have to do some kind of logo guidelines for this, but I dunno what fonts
  were used for:\r\n1 - the white text (the capitals and the small letters)\r\n2 -
  the diagonal one\r\n3 - the Chinese looking ones\r\n\r\nAnyone know of them?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/391795_10152348378695647_1453127551_a_4605.jpg]\r\n\r\nThat's
  the biggest image I have seen so I am sorry if it may look unclear. Even the most
  similar fonts would be really helpful.\r\n\r\nWhat I perceive about this:\r\n\r\nwhite
  bold (or more) center text\r\n- curved vertices\r\n- capital C is a portion cut
  straight (but not exactly from the center) from capital O\r\n- really thick (or
  plump even)\r\n- looks like there was kerning involved here\r\n\r\nthe RBX (diagonal)\r\n-
  curve font\r\n- direction of type seems to be sweeping upwards\r\n- looks like handwritten
  type in some sort of way\r\n- the capital letters seem to be different from the
  small letters - as if they come from different families (unsure)\r\n\r\nthe Chinese
  characters\r\n- sans serif\r\n- looks the same as what I remember with other fonts\r\n\r\n\r\nLinks
  to the websites <a href=\"www.rbx.com.ph/\">here</a> and\r\nhere: https://www.facebook.com/pages/RBX-Rice-in-a-Box/239394555646
  (Facebook ._.)\r\n\r\nUPDATE: I did notice or am just experimenting that the typefaces
  may have been altered by doing a bold stroke (using the bold tool in a word processing
  program such as MS Word) to attain that rounded vertices sans serif look. Just a
  heads up. (So much bad practice for this business, but that's what was assigned
  to me.)\r\n\r\nFONTFACE 1: Dokyo by Ben Balvanz (RICE & BOX) and Interstate Bold

  body: "Not able to help with the latin text, but I did look at the Kanji. Unfortunately
    I don't have a huge store of Kanji types to play with so I thought I'd offer some
    assistance in helping you or others track it down.\r\n\r\nThe image is too small
    to tell if the strokes are rounded slightly like the latin \"Rice in a Box\" or
    not, but in any case you are looking for a bold sans serif (as you said) with
    minimal stroke contrast. One feature that stands out is the stroke alignment.
    The 'dot strokes' are either perfectly vertical (as with the top of the second
    character), or all horizontal (as with the left-side radical on the third character).
    Though not unheard of it is unusual and may help you to narrow down the field.
    The other features are an elbow-join rather than a t-join on the foot of the second
    character, and an upwards curve on the 'lid' of the right-side of the third character.
    See below.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/chinese_5239.png]\r\nHere I've
    used two system fonts to illustrate the features. No font I had included all these
    features, but the first shown here comes closest in colour.\r\n\r\nNot all the
    Chinese fonts I had included the third character (Han/meshi - \"cooked rice\"
    or \"meal\") which leads me to believe it may not be a character in standard use
    in written Chinese. It is very much in everyday use in Japanese, however."

  body: "thank you for the first two comments, much appreciated.\r\n\r\nFor the first
    comment:\r\n- I did assume that all of it was leaning towards the Japanese, but
    since it did evolve from the Chinese, I said it like that.\r\n- It's cool that
    you can actually read Kanji since I only had it as an elective. Would you happen
    to know what each character means? (only got the last character in Japanese \"meshi\"
    as food)\r\n- I was\r\n\r\nFor the second comment:\r\n- It's actually exact and
    I did question myself about this since I have seen that font before. Thank you.\r\n\r\nFor
    both comments:\r\n- I do believe the fontfaces are in bold (stroked by a word
    program like MS Word or something) to attain that rounded effect. Just something
    that I noticed today."

  body: "I've just realized that the third character is the traditional form and so
    not really used any more in China. It has been replaced by the simplified form
    as is now the standard.\r\n\r\nThe word(s) \u76D2\u4E4B\u98EF would be read as
    \"He zhi fan\". First character (\u76D2) = 'a lidded box', Second character (\u4E4B)
    is a genitive/modifer, Third character (\u98EF) as you're aware means rice, specifically
    cooked rice. So \u76D2\u4E4B\u98EF literally means \"box of rice\"."

    since it can identify the stoke and put it in text form, but thank you! :) Knowing
    the meaning does help too."

    the name of a japanese kind of fontface.\r\n- the \"in a\" though im unsure with
    Interstate, I think it does fit well when overlapping it. Thank you as well.\r\n\r\n@osamu\r\n-
    I dunno how to get Apple SD Gothic Neo as of now (since I am using a Windows computer.)
