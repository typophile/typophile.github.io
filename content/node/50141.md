  body: "To me, this looks exactly like the lettering from one of those Leroy Lettering
    Guide devices, or the machines they use to make the custom frames for your license
    plates. Someone must have made a font of it by now. The rounded strokes are characteristic
    of the mark of the ink-pen or routing tool used to shape the letters. It's just
    been blown up to sign-size.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
