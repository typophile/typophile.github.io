  body: 08.001 That typophile cyrillic, is that real? Hmm. Guess I really, really,
    need to study some different lettershapes besides latin. =&#40; But, whether real
    or not I like this one. The simplicity is nice for a change. But, I&#39;d put
    the explanation of the back or eliminate it all together.
