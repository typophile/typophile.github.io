    someone from that website can help you?\r\n\r\nBut the last thing I can find was
    he was a student when he drew Pollen and he put this out in 2003\r\nhttp://www.typeculture.com/academic_resource/articles_essays/\r\n\r\nEduardo
    Berliner\r\n\r\nBrazilian ex-student at the University of Reading who designed
    Pollen (2003). - from\r\nhttp://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/brasilfonts.html\r\n\r\nMaybe
    the U of Reading could help?\r\n\r\nFunny, most of the inquiries from the search
    on Yahoo and Google seem to come from typophile.com\r\n\r\nGood luck - and if
    you find him, please share -"
