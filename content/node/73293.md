  black dress' (many thanks to Chanel) what would be your top ten of tried and tested
  fonts? And why?

  body: "The thing about a \"little black dress\" is that (a woman) can wear it <em>anywhere</em>.\r\n\r\nToday,
    there are pretty well two typefaces that belong in that category.\r\n\r\nTimes
    Roman.\r\nHelvetica.\r\n\r\nBut the sense I get of the mood of this forum is that
    most of the people here are down on the use of overused faces. Even good ones.
    (After all, Papyrus isn't Comic Sans.)\r\n\r\nEven though its subtle flaring is
    unsuited to even medium-resolution digital use, one might add Optima to the list."

  body: 'The little black dress analogy is about a black cocktail dress which can
    be worn anytime and is easy to accessorize. Anytime means cocktail parties. When
    I''ve heard it referenced in chick flicks and makeover shows it always about evening
    wear. The LBD makes you look good but doesn''t need to be robust. The little black
    dress isn''t daring or creative, it''s a safe fallback. The typographic equivalent
    of the ritzy cocktail party? I guess: somewhat highbrow design. Times New Roman
    is out because it''s now considered lowbrow. Helvetica, maybe but doesn''t pair
    well with other sans like Franklin. Maybe Futura. It''s versatile and looks classy.
    There''s no other font more LB than Futura. Case closed.'

  body: Well, in a pinch, since it's black, it can even be worn to a funeral. So I
    had always understood anytime to mean anytime.
