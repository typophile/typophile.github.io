  body: I was reminded of Letterhead Fonts yesterday by a post on another thread in
    this forum, and I think it&#39;s appropriate here, too. Take a look at <a href="http://www.letterheadfonts.com/contributors/briankniceley/strongcaliope.shtml">Strong
    Calliope</a> or a number of other things there. Pretty darn inexpensive and quite
    delicious-looking. I may have to visit there before I do my summer party this
    year.
