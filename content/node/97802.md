    have to be more specific than that.  What's wrong with them at the moment?\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I
    have to do something particular in fontlab?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nWell, yes.  You
    can tell it to generate automatic hints, I believe.  (I don't have FS but it must
    be in the program settings.)\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Also what font should i make truetype
    or opentype?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nIf you have to ask that, then it's highly likely
    that you don't need the special features provided by OpenType.  TrueType is still
    more widely supported so that's probably your best bet."

      to do something with them, because i wrote with my font in illustrator and it
      looks fine. \r\nI have made about 100 glyphs. If my font had more glyphs then
      i could create an OpenType?\r\nI am so sorry if i wasn't specific, but it's
      the first time i try to make a font and i am a little bit confused. "

    you probably do not need to worry about OpenType features but outputting in one
    of the OpenType formats would probably be the best approach. If you would like
    to output Postscript (cubic bezier) outlines then you should generate an OpenType
    PS font. If you would like to output TrueType (quadratic bezier) outlines then
    you should generate a Windows TrueType/OpenType TT font. It is most likely that
    you will be working with Postscript (cubic beziers) by default when importing
    from Illustrator.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the number glyphs/characters you would only
    need to worry if you were creating an older Postscript Type 1 font, which has
    a restriction on the number of characters, limited to 256 depending on the encoding.\r\n\r\nYou
    would probably find [[http://www.lesliecabarga.com/collections/books/products/learn-fontlab-fast|Leslie
    Cabaga's book, <em>Learn FontLab Fast</em>]] very helpful."

  body: "FontLab let you export the font as TT or OT (or even other formats). Your
    .fvb file is not attained to any of these output ways. Even if all your work was
    done with cubic B\xE9zier curves, you can still export it directly as TrueType,
    which uses quadratic ones (and it is also possible to convert the contour to quadratic
    or cubic curves anytime).\r\n\r\nRegarding hints, you can define them (1) manually;
    (2) using a FontLab auto feature; or (3) using a free command-line program provided
    by Adobe after exporting the font. This may be done at any moment, but I prefer
    to define them as soon as I design a glyph.\r\n\r\nIf you decide to manually add
    hints, there is a nice trick: use links instead of hints. Links are very similar
    to hints, but aimed to TT output. The advantage to use links in a production scenario
    is that it follows contour changes (I mean, if you decide to make a stem thicker,
    the link will follow it). In a later moment, you can convert all links to hints,
    although this is not necessary as FontLab will take care of this when generating
    the font. Keyboard shortcuts to add links are [ and ].\r\n\r\nBe careful about
    the result you get in Illustrator. To judge if a font will render and print well,
    you may test it in text editors and do small-size printings (from 6pt and above).
    A non-hinted font may present decent result in Illustrator, Photoshop or InDesign
    due to the typographic controls these applications offer, but then produce an
    ugly result in something like Word.\r\n\r\nBesides this, you may consider to develop
    your whole font inside FontLab. To design in Illustrator and then bring the contour
    to FL is perfectly possible, but this soon become far from ideal when your font
    grows up. About three years ago I was in your position when designing fonts for
    the first time. As I knew Illustration well, it was easier to me to design the
    contours with it. But experienced typophilers suggested to invest some time in
    FontLab and do all design with it. This proved to be a splendid advice as after
    two months I was producing much quicker in FontLab than using the Illustrator-to-FL
    workflow.\r\n"
