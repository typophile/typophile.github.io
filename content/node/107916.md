  you are an advertising agency, acting on behalf of an advertising agency or otherwise
  acting in a similar capacity or for the benefit of a third party, the purchase of
  a license for your client is required...\"\r\n\r\nDoes this mean that I have to
  purchase a license for this font every time I use it for a different client if I
  am an independent designer?  That isn't how I have understood font licenses to work.\r\n\r\nAlso,\r\n\r\n\"The
  user of this House Industries font software agrees to credit House Industries as
  the trademark and copyright owner of the House Industries fonts and list the font
  names, wherever and whenever design, production, or any other credits are shown.\"\r\n\r\nThis
  seems a little absurd.  Does this mean whenever the font is used, it must be identified/credited
  at the bottom of the design or something?  I know that Old Navy uses Eames in their
  in-store displays, website, and even on their apparel, and I didn't see the font
  'credited'.  "

    Industries license reads, in part: \"...agrees to credit House Industries as the
    trademark and copyright owner of the House Industries fonts and list the font
    names, wherever and whenever design, production, or any other credits are shown.\"\r\n\r\nIn
    other words, if other credits (for instance Set Designer: John Smith) are given
    then credit must also be given for House Industries if their fonts were used."

  body: "Thanks George, that makes sense now.\r\n\r\nHas anyone ever bought a font
    that required you to buy an additional license each time you used it on a design
    for a different client?"

  body: "> the purchase of a license for your client is required\r\n\r\nI assume they're
    thinking that clients sometimes ask the designer to email them copies of the fonts
    when the project is done (for future editing, etc.). \r\n\r\nAnd that does indeed
    happen occasionally, although in my experience it doesn't happen very often, because
    clients also need the native files to do any editing, and small clients don't
    own the necessary software (InDesign, Photoshop or whatever), and larger corporate
    clients usually understand the issue of licensing already."
