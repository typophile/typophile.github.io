  tool for Fontographer .fog files. The big feature of the new version is the ability
  to convert .fog files directly to OpenType font files - either .ttf or .otf. In
  addition a number of bugs have been fixed. \r\nThere is no change in the price of
  the product (US$79), and users of version 1 can upgrade for US$19.95. Further information

  body: "Before I even get to this let me announce that I am certainly happy with
    Typophile's abandonment of the beta. Basically, we are now stuck with this piece
    of junk that has fewer options than the previous version. Now we have a crappy
    RSS and a crappy Typowiki. Anyone remember what we had before the beta?\r\n\r\nAt
    any rate, I am getting tired of shelling out dough-re-me to FontLab for these
    incessant upgrades. FogLamp should have been simply an addition to FontLab Studio,
    et al, rather than a stand alone product. Now, I, as a previous owner of FogLamp,
    have to shell out another $20 so I can eliminate the piece of inscrutable junk
    that FontLab Studio has turned out to be. For god sake's, that 900+ page PDF manual
    of theirs won't print out because of PostScript errors.\r\n\r\nThis monopoly on
    type design software is starting to piss me off. Wasn't FOG given over to the
    FontLab folks for free? \r\n\r\n"

  body: "No, it wasn't.\r\n\r\nFeel free to come up with your own type design software,
    fund somebody else to do it, or just buy something else.\r\n\r\nMy commentary:
    FontLab certainly has a dominant position in the type development world. In my
    opinion, having watched and studied the market for a lot of years, I don't think
    the market is big enough to support two companies both making their primary living
    off of retail-priced font development tools. Heck, the market probably isn't even
    big enough for *one* such company, if that company is based in Silicon Valley
    and paying Silicon Valley wages. In other words, I suggest there is a correlation
    between the facts that (1) FontLab has been fairly successful and (2) their programmers
    are all in Russia.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Conor\r\n\r\nAgree away. You have deep pockets? You certainly have a long
    neck. :\u2013)\r\n\r\nWhat's wrong with any RSS? I believe Hrant mentioned something
    negative in regard to the Typophile RSS yesterday. There was also a post in regard
    to the inability to receive e-mail notifications in reply to a post you were responding
    to. A previous and \"invaluable\" Typophile function. But no longer. It really
    is counter-productive, given the Typophile method of multiple subject area of
    the forum to not allow specific reference.\r\n\r\nGerald"

    subject of FontLab, I don\u2019t have deep pockets. Just set up a studio here
    in Dublin. All my type designs are on paper and in Illustrator. When I can afford
    to buy FontLab I\u2019ll buy it.\r\n\r\nSo\u2026 my love for type is (for now)
    limited to the occasional rant/type ID on Typophile."
