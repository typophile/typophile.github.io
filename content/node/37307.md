  made with type?\r\nI'm thinking of things like the Fendi multiple \"F\" pattern,
  the Chanel design checkerboard C's, the House Industries textiles, etc.\r\nHas anyone
  seen an article written about this or can you think of other examples I could look
  at?\r\n\r\nthanks..."

    the photos in the article, too."
