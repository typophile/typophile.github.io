  body: It&#39;s too cute for investment wonks. What&#39;s with &#62;ideas with vision&#60;
    floating as if an afterthought? What global investment company? Branding is absent
    IMO.

  body: 'The words &#34;ideas with vision&#34; mean absolutely nothing. Global Investment
    is rather vague, is it investing globally for clients or is it investing in global
    markets like a countries economy. I don&#39;t get the orange, its pretty but not
    conserative, I also don&#39;t get the shape of the orange mark, is it a person?
    Just some thoughts, nothing mean meant. '

  body: 'thnx for the feedback.  The client I am working for is through the sba, small
    business association, of Oakland.  The owner of Global Investments co. already
    registered her ficticious name of business as the one stated above. I can agree
    its a very generic name and global is not even about of her mission statement.
    but I cant get her to change the name. its what she wants. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>MY school has a program with sba to help small
    companies getting online. Her orginal logal was some clip art. The logo wasnt
    really thought out well because she doesnt have a big idea. If you know what i
    mean. Anyways, she wanted something that was friendly. The cirlces are just some
    thing I was playing around with and came up with a person.  I guess its hard to
    tell I, and I should rethink the logo but I fear we dont have time. Do to our
    scope of the project.  I feel though  that these small business&#39;s do need
    some identity and branding strategy&#39;s. I suggested to my teacher that the
    graphic department should help these company&#39;s with their identities because
    since we are an html class we dont have time to develop it..   <BR> <BR>Anways,
    I sad to hear its hard to read. and ideas with visions is her tagline, but it
    doesnt make sense either. '

  body: 'Gregory, try to win some small battles, make the orange a metalic orange,
    and change the black to gray, it will look more upscale. Make sure the first thing
    a consumer sees on the website is a mission statement. '
