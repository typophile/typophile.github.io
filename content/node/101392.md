body: "A while ago I have finished yet another typographic world map. The project
  is heavily inspired by [[http://www.typomaps.net/|TypoMaps]], the difference being
  that I set the country names in their official languages and scripts, and was being
  more accurate with all the small islands and independent territories (also I think
  I followed the actual borders more carefully). I will appreciate any comments, especially
  about how well non-latin/cyrillic/greek part (Arabic, in particular) matches the
  main font (Helvetica).\r\n\r\nThe JPG render of the map is attached, or you can
  download the EPS from [[http://publicfields.net/textmap/get.html|my homepage]] (<a

    it's the eastern 1/3 of Turkey but that's another story.  :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    to me.\r\n\r\nBTW how have you handled countries with multiple official scripts

    body: "> how have you handled countries with multiple official scripts and/or
      languages?\r\n\r\nBy choosing the most used one from the list of official languages
      (according to Wiki and other sources), or, in case of a tie, the one in which
      the name looked most interesting. It was not exact science, I admit, but most
      of the times the choice was quite clear."
