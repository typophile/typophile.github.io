body: I was recently asked to update some maps for a game because the person who created
  them is no longer around. I tried asking on that game if anyone recognized the font
  but all I got was "it looks like one of the Palatino family" but when I typed some
  of the identical text into MS paint or Adobe Photoshop, it didn't match. So can
  anyone else give a more accurate answer?

    maps and sorted through as much of the alphabet as I could find.  I wish they'd
    all been in bmp format instead; I've never been too fond of jpg or gif.\r\n\r\nI
    can give you a link to one of the original maps and you can enlarge it yourself
    if you want.  \r\nhttp://www.angelfire.com/rpg/crackednutz/astaria/maps/astaria.jpg\r\n\r\nTrump
    Medieval looks close but the 3 and 5 aren't exactly the same.  It might be enough
    that I can make it work though if noone else can figure out anything better.\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "Yeah, that part was done separately, on another map with that sample, he
    used a different font and just copied it into the map I linked above.\r\n\r\nThe
    x in Nexus does look like California FB but I'll say this:  that font isn't worth
    $450 for one computer.  That's just plain greedy."

    clear letter samples my suggestion is to try using the [[http://bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsearch.php|Serif
    Font ID Guide]], or else Identifont. \r\n\r\nYour posted sample is not clear enough
    for me to get any good results with the Serif Guide, so I must not be able to
    see the details well enough.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
