  body: "To me, it's (obviously) not-a-font, more a graphic. Some alignments and gradients
    look to fit too much perfectly to be a font.\r\nMy 2 cents: start with any generic
    sans-serif that basically fits your requirements (in this case you could start
    with [[http://myfonts.us/td-Bt6E1j|Avant-Garde]] Demi-Bold), \"break\" it in elementary
    geometric shapes, extend some strokes, add gradients to each part to create virtual
    layering effect and finally move up or down some points (mainly center connection
    of /Y) to adjust with gradients.\r\n"
