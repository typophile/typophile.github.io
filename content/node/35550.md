  designed to reference computers or video games. Specifically, one thing I'm trying
  to figure out is the relationship between <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/data-seventy/\">Data
  70</a> and this <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/computer/\">Computer</a>.
  Data 70 is relatively easy to find out about, but \"Computer\" (probably because
  of its generic name) is much less so. \r\n\r\nOne thing I'm trying to determine,
  for example, is which came first. The Monotype \"Computer\" I linked to above seems
  to be mostly identical to \"Moore Computer\" which I found in an undated VGC catalog.
  According to <a href=\"http://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/vgc-typefaces.html\">this</a>,
  Moore computer dates to 1968, but I can't find a source to corroborate that. If
  that's true, it's significant since I've got a journal article claiming that Data
  70 (designed in 1970 by Bob Newman) was the first typeface to base its design on
  MICR (E13B) characters, subsequently influencing 70s design, particularly in sci-fi
  contexts. I have found uses of 'Computer' as far back as 1972, but I had assumed
  it was based on Data 70, much like the dozens of examples of Data 70-like lettering
  (check out the <a href=\"http://www.vidgame.net/PONG/magnavox/odyssey_logo.jpg\">Magnavox
  Odyssey Logo</a> for example).\r\n\r\nAnyway, can anyone shed some light on this
  font? I'd be particularly grateful for any ideas on how I could confirm its date
  or figure out who designed it.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

  body: "Wow, thanks for all the replies. I'm pretty familiar with the MICR / E13B
    origins of these typefaces, and in fact what I'm trying to do is track the influence
    through the correct lineage, so to speak. The one article I referred to in the
    post[1] is quite good in some regards, but I think the authors are incorrect on
    a few points and I want to make sure to get it right. For example, they discuss
    the proliferation of Data 70, but even some of the examples they show are definitely
    Moore Computer or Orbit-B. They do refer to Data 70 \"and its variants,\" but
    even that is incorrect if Moore Computer came first. At any rate, Amelia is arguably
    MICR-based, as is Countdown (kind of a stretch), both of which definitely pre-date
    Data 70. Incidentally, my goal isn't to prove these guys wrong, I just want to
    make sure I get the order right when I discuss the history.\r\n\r\nStephen: thanks
    for that link, one of the commenters mentioned Orbit-B, so now I finally have
    a name and a history for this other type I've been seeing but didn't have a name
    for. I think that actually may be the original font (seen on a U-Haul truck) that
    started me thinking about this to begin with.\r\n\r\naluminum: I've been trying
    to come up with a name (assuming there isn't already a standard one) for that
    blocky thing that characterizes these fonts (is it technically a gigantic serif?),
    and \"digital tumor\" is certainly in the running now. I've also been considering
    \"floating chad.\"  Google didn't think that was a common term, so is that yours?\r\n\r\nRicardo:
    Too bad there's not much else in the WTF thread, but the first name of the designer
    is a huge clue. Thanks! \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Owens, Mark, and David Reinfurt. \"Pure

  body: "I found this post whilst searching for the origins of data 70 because I had
    a sneaky suspicion it may have been lost and the reality of where this futuristic
    computer font came from has always amused me.\r\n\r\nFrom this post I'm guessing
    it has, mostly because it's an origin in the hacker domain rather than design.\r\n\r\nYou
    see the way I understand it, these fonts are not based on that icky MICR mess
    at all, they are based on old printers and hacker ingenuity.\r\n\r\nOld printers,
    attached to mainframes, used to have no fonts, all they could do was print text
    in normal, bold or italic. Italic was pretty much the same as normal but the bottom
    half of the letters where all shifted one pixel/dot to the left. Naturally, for
    it is what they do best, the hackers of that time worked out a few tricks. One
    of these simple tricks was printing text in normal, then backspacing and printing
    the same text over the top of this again but in italic. Creating strange letters
    that were normal at the top but bold at the bottom.\r\n\r\nThus creating a new
    font, a new braver bolder font of the future... :)\r\n\r\nThis would I guess have
    been sometime in the 60s, possibly even earlier.\r\n\r\nThis simple trick of combining
    normal/italic to create a computer font, seems to have been lost as I've just
    been searching around for any reference to it and this post was actually the closest
    thing I could find.\r\n\r\nSo I thought you might be interested, the two fonts
    you are talking about could have been built independently referencing this same
    source.\r\n\r\n\r\nKriss\r\n"

  body: "Kriss, this is an interesting hypothesis, and one well-worth thinking about.
    Among the various accounts of Data 70 one can find on the web, some of them at
    least seem to suggest this possibility. MyFonts, for example, says that Data 70
    \"simulates output generated by computers,\" which is pretty ambiguous but could
    indeed include the kind of practice you're talking about.\r\n\r\nI'd love to see
    an example of what you're describing if you can find one. Still, intentionality
    is a tricky thing in type design, it seems. So whether Newman intended Data 70
    to mimic these hacker tricks you describe, it would still be possible and valid
    for type consumers to take Data 70 as a reference to MICR and use it as such.
    \r\n\r\nThe journal article I mention in the first post here only mentions Data
    70's origin in MICR, but the examples the authors provide of Data 70 allegedly
    in use are actually Moore Computer and Westminster -- two faces which bear a much
    closer resemblance to MICR (in my opinion) than Data 70. (FWIW, the earliest accounts
    I have of both Moore Computer and Westminster make it pretty clear that their
    designers each had MICR in mind).  And while the article gets the identification
    wrong, I think it still makes a valid point about Data 70's association with futurism,
    anxiety about cybernetics, and (originally) dystopia. \r\n\r\nMy point is just
    that whatever inspired Data 70, it has been taken as a reference to MICR, which
    in my mind aligns it strongly with Moore Computer, Westminster, Orbit-B etc.\r\n\r\n"
