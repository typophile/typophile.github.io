body: "I am just about testing a font and discovered that InDesign gives me a different
  kerning value for a certain pair than i specified in FontLab (5.0.2). Anyone came
  across the same problem? Does FL alter the kerning values when generating the font?
  Can\u2019t be, can it? I generated an OT .ttf font. Any help much appreciated."

  body: If you used class kerning, it may be that the certain pair pops up in more
    than one class-to-class relationship, with different values in each.

    body: Alright. What i wonder is where does this other value come from? I only
      specified one value. And of course the setting in InDesign is 'Metrics'. After
      generating the font again by updating the kern feature beforehand, i got the
      value i wanted.

  body: 'Also, make sure "Metrics" kerning is on, not "Optical". Optical kerning in
    InDesign means the built-in kerning of the font is ignored and ID is calculating
    its own values on the fly, and different values, depending on the size you''re
    setting.  '
