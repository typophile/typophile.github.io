body: "Hi\r\n\r\nI've been looking for this font for ages and I then came across it
  in a comic book! Sorry that i've included the whole page but couldn't get just the
  panel I wanted. The particular font i'm looking for is the one in the third panel:
  \"Carol Ferris\". It's very retro looking and I was hoping someone might know what
  this font is called.\r\n\r\nAlso, does anyone know of any other 50's or 60's font's
  or images?\r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance\r\n\r\nCliff"
