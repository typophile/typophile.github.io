  \   ignore sub space A';\r\n    sub A' B by C;\r\n\r\nHow do I include the beginning
  of the line in the 'ignores'?"

  body: I used it for fonts with well over 600 glyphs. Shouldn't be a real problem.
    Look at some of the feature code for Bickham. Its like an encyclopedia. Most people
    using OT fonts with graphic applications like InDesign are gonna have pretty fast
    computers.

  body: "Oh the font is big but it's not professional. Actually it is intended mostly
    for the web. It already gives a heavy workout to the CPU just by being Arabic!
    I try to trim down everywhere I can.\r\nIn my specific case, I think I'll use
    your solution but backward. I skip the 'ignore' thing and for my substitution,
    I create a class after which it will be applied. The list of glyphs in that class
    will be much much shorter than 'everything else' class.\r\nBut it's odd that OT
    doesn't have a specific solution for the beginning and the end of the line.\r\n-B"
