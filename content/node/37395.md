  body: "It's probably a custom design since it's a logo. However, the 'O' and 'R'
    bear similarities to Futura. If you flipped the 'U' in Futura upside-down, you
    could get close to the 'N', and adding a crossbar would get you the 'A'. A lot
    of other tweaking would be needed as well, but it could serve as a starting point.\r\n\r\n
