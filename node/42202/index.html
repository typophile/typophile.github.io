<p>It will be faster than CS2 unless you’re low on RAM, in which case Rosetta can really be nasty. At work I’m running CS3 on a dual G5 with 1.5 gigs of RAM and have no issues.</p>

I resent clients who presume to dictate my software, and I don&rsquo;t permit them to do so&ndash;ever. I see no reason to have both clogging my system&ndash;not cheap, either. If InDesign is anything like Illustrator, as some have told me, then that&rsquo;s another reason to spurn it: Illustrator I always detested as counter-intuitive.</div>

<p>Even if said client pays you around 30Gs a year? Sorry if I&rsquo;m not in a position to turn down that kind of money! You must have a pretty old machine if you&rsquo;re worried about two applications clogging it up. Plus, fluency in both softwares makes me much more versatile and therefore employable, why on earth would anyone deliberately fight that?</p>
<p>It is interesting to see so many fellow Quark users climbing out of their holes, it can feel lonely on this forum where Quark-bashing is somewhat of a blood sport.</p>

<p>RAM, of course, makes a difference but i have both versions on both types of mac (both with 2 Gigs RAM) and i can&rsquo;t tell any difference in speed. i think we&rsquo;re talking nanoseconds&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m a fully-committed InDesign user that only rarely launches Quark, usually only to re-save old documents into versions that can be converted to InDesign documents.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a shame, really. Using Quark on a day-to-day basis was a blast. I remember it as one of the most responsive and enjoyable programs I&rsquo;ve ever used. As gamers would say, it had great &ldquo;playability.&rdquo; Working in  Quark was like improvising on the piano. It had it&rsquo;s flaws for certain, but for practiced users it all but disappeared under your hands.</p>
<p>At its height I think Quark enjoyed 85% market share. Unfortunately the company decided to celebrate with intensely predatory pricing, openly hostile customer service and a manic obsession with security. Many of us were openly begging Adobe to hurry up with getting InDesign to market. And I&rsquo;m sure Quark saw in Adobe the end of their monopolistic spree and tried to squeeze as much out of the market as possible before getting kicked back. 
I may be wrong, but it seems that these days most Quark users are holdovers from this earlier era. A majority of working designers have switched to InDesign and, unless I&rsquo;m mistaken, a majority of formal design education in InDesign as well, so it&rsquo;s what all the kids are using. But surely somebody becoming acclimated to InDesign and <em>then</em> switching to Quark is rather rare?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I find Adobe Bridge (using CS2 on a pre-Intel mac) sluggish and cumbersome. Every time I have tried to use it I have been frustrated. I actually use iView which is free and less intrusive than iPhoto and lets you organize and view your photos really easily. That is essential for the kind of work I do, which often involves sequencing photos. I set up the sequence in iView and then lay it out in Quark or InD. You can actually drag photos into those programs from iView.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure Bridge is a fine software and probably just need to sit down with someone who can show me how it is supposed to work.</p>
<p>@Chris - yes, that was what I had heard about intel/non-intel and the various CS versions, which is the main reason I&rsquo;ve hung onto my CS3 without installing it. Also I really dislike the InDesign Interchange system; wish they had a better way to downsave. In Quark you just downsave and it gives you an alert that you are doing that (which of course you already know) but the file isn&rsquo;t altered.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I use both at a master level, they are both necessary. Quark 8 hopefully will be the first update to really add some features. 6.5-7 was a real wasted of time, whooo-hooo, drop shadows! Drop shadows are weeeeeaaaaaaak! A couple of new usability features but I mean come on! The only really great thing about Q7 is the opentype support. InDesign definately takes some time getting used to. And if you don&rsquo;t like illustrator because it&rsquo;s not &ldquo;intuitive&rdquo; then you need to spend more time learning the apps before you jump right in and work on a job for a client. I can&rsquo;t actually say i&rsquo;ve met an app the wasn&rsquo;t intuitive, other than some raw image processing apps throughout the years. Unfortunately I am not the most common user, I am the type of person who loves finding the limitations in apps in the first 30 minutes of use, then bitching and complaining about the hacks that programmed it to begin with! I have a running joke with some friends that if we ever come across someone involved with programming quark, well you know the rest! lol! :)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I dunno, maybe I&rsquo;m just more of a production type. Yes, I&rsquo;m more familiar with Quark. Then again, I came to Quark at version 3. I&rsquo;d been using an old version of PageMaker that limited me to one-page docs, and I was going to be laying out my very first book. This was not a design job. Quark 3 was what the book packager I was subbing the layout work from had their template in.</p>
<p>After awhile PageMaker came out with a version that allowed multi-page docs and books became possible. A non-profit I did book design and layout for over the course of a few years had PageMaker and was not about to spend money and time on the upstart, Quark.</p>
<p>At the time, no one had been dealing with PDFs. This changed for me around 1999. Once I discovered PDFs and printers began accepting them, I tried to send only PDFs to my clients, retaining control over the native files in case of reprints and new editions. I always described them as &ldquo;cross-platform, printer-ready PDFs,&rdquo; hoping it wouldn&rsquo;t occur to the client that most of the value was in the native files.</p>
<p>When InDesign came along, it seemed to be PageMaker on steroids. I learned InDy on version 2, recreating the look of a previously published book&rsquo;s new edition. It had originally been done in Quark, but whoever had done the first book held on to the native files, so I was hired to create a book that looked like the old one. InDy was easy to learn and use, tho' through the first CS version I wasn&rsquo;t much impressed with InDy&rsquo;s much vaunted type-handling powers. Perhaps it was my growing experience with InDy, but I find that in CS2, I like how it handles type a lot more.</p>
<p>As I said, most of the places for which I work use Quark. If it&rsquo;s not a design job, but straight book layout, I&rsquo;m provided a template. 95% of the time the template is still a Quark template.</p>

As Patty so rightly points out, publishers want Quark. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if ID is more sophisticated (argue this at your leisure), Quark is what they&rsquo;ve been using for years, and they intend to continue using it.

<p>Thank you Rodrigue! I&rsquo;ve been such a broken record on this topic I had to read back through the thread to make sure I wasn&rsquo;t repeating myself. As far as I know Adobe has no plans to add this feature unless &ldquo;thousands of users ask for it&rdquo;, which is a real shame.</p>
<p>See here:
<a href="http://www.typophile.com/node/7608">http://www.typophile.com/node/7608</a></p>
<p>Both apps have their strengths and weaknesses, from small stuff (like why can&rsquo;t you forward delete in InD) to how annoying it is to add/change a color swatch in Quark. And like Hillary and Obama, they are more alike than different. As I said, my clients use both, I am very fluent in both, and I think a designer does him/herself a disservice by not being able to master both. Quark&rsquo;s arrogance at the dawn of the OS X era left the door wide open for Adobe to jump in, and luckily for them they got it right. If InD had been just a Pagemaker rehash it would not have caught on. It does seem like the kids are all using InD tho.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I remember about 5 years ago when there was all the agonising over Quark 5, someone posted something a to mac forum about how none of the programmers who had done Quark 4 still worked there — they had all been let go because for a long time there was no work for them to do. So when it came to building Quark 5 there was no one left who had an intimate knowledge of the code. It was outsourced to India and the whole thing had to be coded from scratch. Quark are still recovering from that huge spell where they coasted on their predatory licensing fees.</p>
<p>CEO&rsquo;s who f***-up as badly as Quark&rsquo;s did should be able to be sued down the track for the recovery of some of their outrageous salaries. CEO&rsquo;s seem to be the only people left in the world who get paid whether they are good or whether they are completely crap.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>OK I just figured out something I find VERY problematic about InDesign (and which is requiring a lot of extra work on my part).</p>
<p>When you create a Character Style, InD assigns it leading. If you then go back and change the leading of the Paragraph Style, the leading of the Character Style will override it. What the hell is up with that? In Quark, the Paragraph Style contains the leading, the point of Character Style is to apply it only to certain characters or words within the paragraph, not to affect the attributes of the paragraph itself.</p>
<p>I also find it odd that you can change the leading of only one line of a paragraph in InD. In Quark you simply have to place your curser anywhere in the paragraph (or line if it&rsquo;s one line long) and you can change the leading. In InD you have to select the entire bloody thing.</p>
<p>Plus - why isn&rsquo;t there a key command action in InD to call up the &ldquo;Text Frame Options&rdquo; pane? That is a very useful pane, and it drives me nuts to have to go to the menu each time.</p>
<p>OK griping over for now.</p>

<p>The leading thing can be turned off: Preferences &gt; Type &ndash; check &ldquo;Apply Leading to Entire Paragraphs&rdquo; under Type Options. This will give you behavior more like Quark&rsquo;s. I don&rsquo;t know why this is off by default. I always tell my designers to change their default preferences to have this option turned on.</p>
<p>BTW, I was an avid Quark user for many years, and even though I&rsquo;ve been using primarily InDesign for the past few years, it&rsquo;s still not as fast and efficient as I was in Quark. At first I chalked it up to learning curve. But after a couple years, it seems to me that there are just several basic day-in-day-out actions that require more mousing and menu-hunting in InDesign than in Quark, no way around it.</p>

<p>Character styles in InDesign are a different cup of tea compared to Quark and some other programs: In Indesign they report <strong>only the differences</strong> between them and the paragraph style. So a paragraph style can contain e.g. simply a different color or size, nothing else.</p>
<p>Just try e.g. creating a character style based on a word which is marked bold. When looking into the new character style dialog box, all of the definition fields are empty, there is only one field with &ldquo;bold&rdquo; in it.</p>
<p>This means, if you don&rsquo;t specify the leading in the character style dialog box, the leading of the paragraph style will be applied unchanged.</p>

I totally agree and we have heard about built-in kern pair editing from multiple sources; I remember the childrens' books publishers being especially persuasive. I could deliver the normal &ldquo;resource constraints&rdquo; and &ldquo;feature trade-off&rdquo; excuses but the biggest reason why this feature is difficult for us is that we feel it would be a mistake to have a kern pair editor that could not share the updated kerning with at least Illustrator &amp; Photoshop. That makes InDesign&rsquo;s ranking of the feature less of a determining factor. We are still working on the global solution and we&rsquo;re trying to assist plugin developers who are working on InDesign-only solutions.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Eric, thank you for the first valid explanation I have yet to receive as to why InDesign doesn&rsquo;t have kerning pairs. But I will say that since Illustrator and P-shop are not really designed for typesetting it seems to me this feature is less significant there. Not a good reason to hold up implementing it in InD.</p>
<p><cite>This means, if you don’t specify the leading in the character style dialog box, the leading of the paragraph style will be applied unchanged.</cite></p>
<p>The way I create style sheets is to mock up a design I like and then select the various elements one by one and make style sheets directly from them. I don&rsquo;t know if everyone works this way, but it was a feature of Quark too and it is infinitely easier than creating style sheets from scratch.</p>
<p>What happened was that I created a paragraph style sheet for recipe directions and then a character style sheet for the step numbers. I didn&rsquo;t do anything to the leading when I did that. I later changed the leading in the paragraph style sheet, and it didn&rsquo;t occur to me that I then had to change it in the character style sheet as well. And then I didn&rsquo;t notice for a long time that the char. style sheet was overriding the paragraph style sheet and inserting an additional point of lead. Lots of work to go back and fix alignments and such.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">On Adobes website there is this plug-in:
<a href="http://www.knowbody.dk">http://www.knowbody.dk</a>
Looks ok, but runs 100 USD for kerning, then 100 USD for tracking, and on first blush, not as intuitive as Quarks.
Patty, it is obvious to me that Adobe does not care about this feature, it should have been included in PageMaker! If Adobe wishes not to recognize a feature that would actually pull potential clients away from their biggest rival, why would I want to put in a feature request? This should have been foundational in V1 or 1.5. 
Chipman: Do you really think IDs counter intuitive box implementation is better than Quarks simple one? After 8 years of V1, V2, CS, CS2 and CS3, I still do not get it, or see its benefit, it is clumsy to me.<br>
Ultimately, anyone can make either product work quite well, but who does not get miffed when a feature is left out of a competing product, which claims so much superiority.
As many here have pointed out that Quark so inept, why can&rsquo;t Adobe match this feature? If you believe the engineers at Adobe are so much better than what is coming out of Quark, what is the hold up?
Some time back people on Typophile were posting how backward Quark is/was, but to me features of basic typographical control are far more important than transparency, because I can use PhotoShop for most any transparency. There are some features that I love in ID, like the measurement box with 9 points in it, it is great, so precise for print production, far superior to Quark.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m using Quark. Have been using 4.1 on a Mac G4 for years. It&rsquo;s brilliant <em>in as much that</em> it&rsquo;s very fast and although it doesn&rsquo;t have all the bells and whistles, I can create just about every visual effect that v7 can by way of close integration with Photoshop and Illustrator without spending TOO much extra time on things. Now I&rsquo;m using v7 on an iMac 2.8GHz (2Gb RAM). Oh dear&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sick to the back teeth of it. It garbles bitmap TIF files and the only way I can get the images to reproduce properly is by replacing them with .psd files, which adds a lot of extra weight to the documents. THEN there&rsquo;s the issue of PDF creation - it&rsquo;s cr@p, cr@p, cr@p!!!</p>
<p>Quark 4 - make your document. Utilities -&gt; create PDF; wait while Quark creates a reasonably sized EPS file, opens Distiller automatically, produces PDF file incredibly efficiently.</p>
<p>Quark 7 - make document while having to work around its flaws, including the problem just mentioned. File -&gt; Export to PDF. Wait while Quark creates an impossibly huge EPS file (a looooooooong time&hellip;) and then be amazed when after a similarly lengthy amount of time, a PDF of totally unusable file size has been produced. Doing it through Distiller doesn&rsquo;t make the file much smaller, but does reduce the time the PDF stage takes considerably. But it&rsquo;s the EPS file creation that is the real killer - I&rsquo;m getting Gb sized files.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve pulled my hair out trying to get to the bottom of all of this via various forum discussion - it scares me just how many people come up against this. Does anyone here have any ideas? I&rsquo;m finding all this pathetic. I have InDesign now. I&rsquo;m not using it in anger yet, but the beauty of it being able to seemingly easily convert my Quark 4 files is looking all too appealing&hellip;</p>
<p>help!</p>

<p>Although you sounds pretty frazzled so I will suggest just flattening your photoshop files. And can&rsquo;t you print directly to distiller? I haven&rsquo;t used Quark for year. Or you can print to a .PS (postscript) file instead of .EPS no?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>i&rsquo;m one of those kids who does not know quark well, i used it a few times in my first job, but they preferred indesign, so i used that, and since then every place i&rsquo;ve worked has pretty much just used the creative suite. for me now, quark is just an extra expense i can&rsquo;t justify when i can do almost everything with indesign.</p>
<p>that said, i would love to get into the publishing industry, so if most publishers are using quark, i&rsquo;d be happy to learn it.</p>
