  body: 12 points equals a pica, but 6 picas (72 points) only equals an inch because
    everyone agrees that it does. If you extrapolate 12, 6 pica inches, they do not
    equal a foot. They fall a little short. Everyone who owns a pica rule knows this.
    Admittedly not that many people own pica rulers these days, but there you have
    it.

  body: "Well, there is the traditional pica and the PostScript pica. Six PostScript
    picas = one inch, but six traditional picas = 0.996264 inches.\r\n\r\nPixels are
    a relative measurement and are dependent on device (screen, printer, imagesetter,
    whatever) resolution. On a 72 dpi device, a pixel = 1/72 of an inch. But on an
    iPhone 4 (for example), a pixel = 1/326 of an inch."

  body: The topic of pixels continues to become more complex, as hi-res devices (like
    iPhone 4) no longer map CSS pixels (a.k.a "logical" pixels) at a one-to-one correspondence
    with physical device pixels. <a href=http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2010/04/a_pixel_is_not.html>This
    article</a> explains more on the topic. So, to clarify Mark's statement, 1 <em>physical
    device pixel</em> on the iPhone 4's screen = 1/326 of an inch.

  body: "While a pica is 12 points, nominally 1/6 of an inch (but the hot metal point
    is not actually 1/72 inch exactly) there is a way in which the term \"pica\" is
    used that is slightly more complicated than that which does need a real explanation
    for a newcomer.\r\n\r\nIf you are looking at a column of body copy, 1/6 of an
    inch vertically will be termed a \"pica\".\r\n\r\nHowever, 1/6 of an inch horizontally
    will be called a \"pica em\" instead.\r\n\r\nFor any point size of type, an \"em
    space\" is one that is square in shape, while an \"en space\" is one half as wide
    as a square. If one wishes to measure horizontal distances in body copy in absolute
    terms, rather than relative to the type size in use, then instead of just saying
    how many ems occupy the distance, one has to first specify the type size and then
    multiply by the em, as, in printing, vertical and horizontal distances are measured
    by different units.\r\n\r\nIt should also be noted that in some foundry types,
    a 7 1/2 point en space might not be exactly 3 3/4 points in width - for easier
    setting of tabular matter, nominal en spaces (and, much more likely, nominal 3-to-em
    and 4-to-em and 5-to-em spaces) could well be changed in their widths so as to
    occupy an integral number of 1/2 points. This is described in some ATF catalogs.\r\n\r\nWith
    Monotype equipment, one might have a typeface which is, say, 11 point and 10 1/2
    set, which means that the height of the type is 11 points, but the widths in the
    system of 18 units to the em are as if the type was 10 1/2 points.\r\n\r\nThen,
    there's the fact that while the Selectric Composer had a point of 1/72 inch, the
    foundry point is 0.013837 inches, the Linotype point is 0.014 inches (or maybe
    not; I had read that somewhere, but lately I've read other things that contradict
    this)... and, of course, the Didone is roughly 15/14 of a point... and 12 Didot
    points equal a Cicero, the equivalent of the pica in that system."
