<p>This is my very first attempt at a typeface, and it was inspired by some hand lettering I did for a logo. I know there&rsquo;s still a lot of tweaking to do, and I would love love love any feedback!</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think you have a really nice start. Just a few things I really noticed:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the e, k, o, v, w, x, z are the same thickness throughout the letter, and the other letters have some variations. They seem to be from a different typefaces, at least to me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the w also seems a little wide and leaves a really bad space in the word &ldquo;anyway&rdquo; that I do not believe you could fix with kerning pairs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>maybe the t works better at smaller sizes but at the size you provided it seems to drop below the baseline too much.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the fl ligature looks odd where the ball in the f and the l collide. The purpose of ligatures is to really make the transition smooth and elegant.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the original logo (color) that I did, and then a version of what it would look like now that I&rsquo;ve actually spent time on the letterforms (b &amp; w). It would also be used as a display type on stationery and collateral. I&rsquo;d really like it to be legible/readable at text sizes, although I know it won&rsquo;t be able to get too small since it is a little funky.</p>
<p>Michael: I know, I really struggled with that fl ligature. But I looked at a lot of other fonts with ball terminals, and that seems to be how the fl is treated. Any suggestions?</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m not sure the angled terminals on bdhklmnpqru go with the bouncy feel of the rest - it&rsquo;s like a combination of X-Acto blades and bubbles - but the difference I suppose adds to the liveliness. I would experiment with the m, n, and r at least.</p>
<p>If y is giving you trouble: did you consider doing a y that is u-shaped with a curving descender instead of the diagonal form?</p>
<p>I agree that the fl ligature isn&rsquo;t working - I would abandon the idea of a ball terminal on a line that&rsquo;s not actually terminal.</p>
<p>I think all of your ligatures need to be spaced out more.</p>
<p>I like this font - it&rsquo;s fun. It says to me: Las Vegas, The Price is Right, Sherwood Schwartz shows, 60s stewardesses, Acapulco honeymoons.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Below is an image from Gerrit Noordzij&rsquo;s &ldquo;the stroke&rdquo;. The purpose of the image is to show how easy it is to break up a word and make it hard to read by making the space between letters stop relating to the counter-space or space inside letters. I suggest that you look at the white spaces and get them to start to balance. In general your interletter space is too small to be comfortable. As letters get physicaly ( optically really ) larger you can let them come together a bit more and you might need to add space at very small sizes. But in even in these cases this &lsquo;rule&rsquo; still applies just to a different degree. You might have to make your counters smaller  ( they are very big) as well as adding space between letters. Doing this will make the massive gap between y+w less bad but you should also fix that - probably by making the angles of the diagonal steeper.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Sometimes, in words such as &ldquo;exotic&rdquo;, there isn&rsquo;t enough flavor to carry the word. I wonder if this isn&rsquo;t one of those times where more is better. For instance, should the o have a tiny loop? Should the n have a tail? Should the b and d have curls? I guess why not a little more character on all the blank letters?</p>
<p>The it ligature isn&rsquo;t working for me. It looks almost like an ampersand when small.
The ri ligature isn&rsquo;t working for me either.</p>
