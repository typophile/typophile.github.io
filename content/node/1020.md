    My present office is rather nice though, fireplace, wooden floors. Small, simple,
    Sparton like. I stopped buying things I can&#39;t take with me when I&#39;m gone.
    Besides I spent my life tied down to equipment. Now I am a bit of a vagabond.
    <BR> <BR>But I have some ideas. Ideas are bad for me. <BR> <BR>Gerald Giampa/tramp

    Yeah. I&#39;ve got two systems hooked up to the same monitor/keyboard/mouse through
    a switchbox &#40;just below the screen&#41;. That way I can switch between OSX
    on the laptop &#40;with dual screens&#41; and OS9 on the Cube &#40;for FOG work
    mainly&#41;. Not a bad compromise and it saves desk space.

    from home most of the time, I colonised the dining room table. We have not had
    a dinner party for two years now. <BR> <BR>I still keep an office in a building
    downtown, but only go there once or twice a week. I keep it because I don&#39;t
    have anywhere at home to store more than a small fraction of the library &#40;the
    dining table is now surrounded by stacks of books related to current projects&#41;.
    The office looks like its been wrapped by Cristo: a couple of years back, a small
    fire elsewhere in the building caused sprinklers to go off on six floors, causing
    a huge amount of damage. My floor wasn&#39;t affected, but now I&#39;m paranoid
    and have wrapped all my bookcases in heavy-duty plastic. If you want a book, you
    have to crawl under the plastic to retrieve it. <BR> <BR>I need to move to a bigger
    apartment, or a house, so I can set up a proper home-office and bring my books.
    <BR> <BR>If all this sounds inconvenient and uncomfortable, it&#39;s not so bad,
    and I have an Aeron chair. It only seats the usual number of buttocks, but is
    extremely comfortable.'
