  body: Then what is it? :-&#41; <BR> <BR>If you are looking for the typeface that
    says &#34;Red Bull&#34; in red, yes, it is Futura. <BR>R and B were slightly customized,
    apparently. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/14796.jpg"

  body: The R and B are from our TF Burko, either TF Burko Bold or TF Burko Super
    Duper. Probably the Bold. <BR> <BR>The stencilled cutout on the B was raised from
    the bottom of the B as it is in TF Burko, to the center stroke.  <BR> <BR>The
    balance of the letters appear to be directly from Futura.  <BR> <BR>- Joe

  body: Anonymous is persistant, he/she had the same post on MyFonts &#34;Whats this
    font&#34; and got the same answer Futura, I&#39;m glad Joseph added to my knowledge
    with TF Burko, but for most of John Q Public, I bet futura would work just fine.
