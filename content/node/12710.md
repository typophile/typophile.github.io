  body: "Nice idea. Another great example of people sharing how they view the world
    through what they deem as important.\r\n\r\nI really enjoy the page showing \"The
    Royal Flush\". Do you happen to know who did that lettering?"

  body: Wow, that's a great idea. I have a collection of printed stuff I saved because
    I like too, but it's all in an ugly black box under my desk. Sometime I might
    actually give up the lazyness, pick the best and do something nice like that.

  body: aha! I though I recognized it. that's too bad that people do that. I'll idealize
    and just pretend that John had the opportunity to double-dip from his own work.
