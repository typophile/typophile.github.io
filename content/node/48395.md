body: "I'm looking for a good condensed semi slab-serif for a project, and although
  I've found a few that are close (Boton, Glypha, Serifa), nothing is quite there
  yet.\r\n\r\nI've sketched out something closer to what I think will fit the project,
  and was wondering if anyone knew of a typeface that would match it better?\r\n\r\nI
  guess I'm after some subtle curves into the slabs, a flat (or flatter) bottom to
  the a, subtler serifs in general, and the serifs on the s to be more filled out.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/slabsample_5394.jpg]"

  body: "> subtle curves into the slabs\r\n\r\nThese are called \"brackets\". All
    the typefaces you list are unbracketed slabs. The flat bottomed 'a' is pretty
    unusual so I don't think you'll find a match for that. Best to start with something
    close and modify it. The closest thing I can summon is <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/monotype/amasis_std_bold/?sample_text=Langes&sample_size=96\">Amasis</a>.\r\n"

  body: "Thanks, I knew there was a proper term for the slabs, but it just escaped
    me. But, yes, brackets are exactly what I'm looking for. Something with a similar
    feel to the un-bracketed ones, but just a little softer.\r\n\r\nAt this stage,
    I think Boton is still the closest, so I'll give a go at adapting that to fit.
    \r\n\r\nThanks for both of your help."

    Are their any more weights to it? \r\n\r\nI popped on to the Totem site, but the
    typography link doesn't go anywhere. I'd love to include it as an option in the
    first round, so it would be nice to know license price and so forth.\r\n\r\nI'm
    also digging that Prelo Slab, Stephen. \r\n\r\nThanks all."
