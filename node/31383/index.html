  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi all-
I&rsquo;m trying to help a friend who adopted a system
unfamiliar to them. They&rsquo;re having two similar problems.</p>
<p>An OpenType font they purchased is not working. They 
open it in Font Book but they&rsquo;re getting some kind of 
postscript error when trying to print. As a test, I gave
them an alternate font to see if that worked and FontBook
only enables some but not all of the styles in that font.
Both work fine on my computer.</p>
<p>I have been through everything: dumping other versions 
of it in other folders, repairing permissions, quitting apps
before opening fonts, restarting. To no avail.</p>
<p>The ONE difference between us is that I&rsquo;m on 10.4.3 because 
I heard there were font problems in 10.4.7. They are running
.8. I suggested they re-install the original version of Tiger
but they&rsquo;re afraid to do it. They don&rsquo;t have an easy backup method.
Neither are experienced Mac people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent hours tech supporting them and I need to get this 
solved so I can do my own work! : (</p>
<p>Any ideas?
Thanks!
Jane</p>

<p>How were the fonts installed into Font Book? Did you drag them into the user folder or did you open them and respond to the request to install them?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi All.</p>
<p>Yes, they are being used in InDesign. I made sure they put the fonts into the Fonts folder in the Library for the User. I also had them do a search for other versions of the font and get rid of all of them except the one.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s now getting fonts printing out strangely. Selecting Minion for example and it prints out really weird. I told her to try printing that font from another app first. Then also printing that same text in a new InDesign file, in case the current one is currupt&hellip;.to at least see if it&rsquo;s an app problem or a font problem or a doc problem.</p>
<p>I could try suggesting that they put  the fonts in the Apps folder. Still seems like there&rsquo;s something wrong. I know FontBook isn&rsquo;t that great.</p>
<p>Has anyone heard about font issues with 10.4.7 or .8? A friend who upgraded to Tiger a while back did the .7 updater and had tons of font problems. She downgraded to .3 or something and all the font problems went away.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know about .8.</p>
<p>One last thing&hellip;is it possible anyone is using a printer these days that isn&rsquo;t postscript compatible? Seems she is getting errors that a font she has used isn&rsquo;t available when she goes to print OR make a pdf, even though the printer font is there in the folder, seems to be there in FontBook and doesn&rsquo;t get an error message when trying to choose the font in InDesign. This is nuts. I get an error message on selecting a font if the printer font isn&rsquo;t available&hellip;as it should be.</p>
<p>thanks,
Jane</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>ok dont put fonts in apps folders.
Have you updated acrobat to embed all fonts. check your prefrences.
Wow what a mess&hellip;I would make sure all fonts are off and only load the new ones.
Again try suitcase or other font management software.</p>
<p>I have not had these problems with all versions. all machines are unique. I would not keep upgrading and down grading.</p>
<p>good luck</p>
