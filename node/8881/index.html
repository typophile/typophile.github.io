They do engineering, machining, die making, yadda yadda yadda&hellip; <BR> <BR>All of their marketing pieces thus far are just bad. You look at it and immediately you know their office has dark brown plywood paneling just  from the look of it. anyway - we are trying to move them to a more sophisticated look. We are getting ready to produce a catalog for them and are trying to sell them on a new identity. Below is my first finished stab - will probably comp out 1 or two more&hellip; Any ideas or reactions? <BR> <BR>You can see the old and scary at <a href="http://www.jrhoe.com" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.jrhoe.com">www.jrhoe.com</a></a><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/63889.jpg" alt="Hoe Logo"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well you certainly can't do any worse than what they had. <BR> <BR>Your graphic is interesting. To be honest, I didn't see the &quot;H&quot; for the first 10-15 sec, but now I can't see anything else. I wonder if there is a way to emphasize the &quot;H&quot; without ruining the sophisticated subtlety you've accomplished. It's neat, but I think 10-15 sec is a long time to figure it out. Maybe I'm just an idiot. <BR> <BR>I'll bet you can find more interesting logotype. Perhaps something more substantial. Those boxes (metal sheets, or whatever) create a pretty strong graphic, with a heavy &quot;H&quot; contained within, while that logotype seems really weak in comparison (style, weight and color). The type also seems disjointed from the logo. I would say to either make the type heavier and make it interact more with the graphic or make it much smaller, as a contrasting complimentary element to the graphic. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'll play with the type later - but just wanted to comment - the H in the middle was &quot;accidental&quot; I had the structure in place when I saw it and clipped one more path then I originally had designed and the H was there. It is supposed to refer more to the structural and engineering components as well as sheets of steel being molded or manufactured the H is I guess just an easter egg. I agree that the type is somewhat lackluster, but not sure how far I can really go before it competes with the symbol - I like teuton - I also like Scotts suggestion of maybe even going smaller - I don't  really think that I want the two to really &quot;interact&quot; per se I want to keep them in seperate zones (rambling off the top of my head I really need to think about it) thanks for the suggestions so far guys!!!</div>

<p>not the strongest work but it beats what they had - which you can no longer see - and the client is pleased as punch.<img src="/images/old-images/HoeLogo_6564.jpg" alt=""></p>
