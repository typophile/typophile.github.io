  I need to redo the logo for the website and documents of the orphanage ...\r\nSo
  a similar font is sufficient and if free would be greatly appreciated!\r\nThank

  body: "Nothing free that I can find that is even in the ballpark. About as close
    as I can get is Jeff Levine's Bayview JNL http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/bayview/

    But relatively minor editing can make it very close.\r\nDon"

    sorry for not having thanked you before. I spent more time trying to find a similar
    typeface but nothing better than your proposal. Thank you again and have a good
    day.\r\n"
