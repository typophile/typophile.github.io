  find it myself with some solid browsing. I'm posting this here just in case somebody
  recognises it and saves me the hassle. You may have noticed from a couple of previous
  requests that I am working my way backwards through the <a href=\"http://bookcoverarchive.com/\">Book
  Cover Archive</a>, identifying the typefaces and adding them to the FontShop Gallery
  as well. I can assure you it is a hell of a lot of work. But also kind of fun (hey,
  I am slightly autistic) and very rewarding -- we're making this into a kick-ass
  resource.\r\n\r\nI am looking for the serif face on the cover of James Gleick's
  <a href=\"http://bookcoverarchive.com/book/faster\">Faster</a>. The three dimensional
  treatment is giving me a hard time.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/faster_5218.large.jpg]"
