  body: hm. [[http://www.fonts.com/font/t-26/arete-mono/regular|Arete Mono]] matches
    most. seems as if the M & W glyphs are the oddballs, but only for the Zembla and
    Weisz. alternates in there somewhere? or just special mods?

    Jodie is right, Arete Mono is definitely the closest you could get. As Matt Willey
    is well-known for his work in editorial type design (Port Magazine, Wired, Elephant
    Magazine, New York Times Magazine...), it could easily be a custom job based on
    Arete Mono, adjusting and redrawing some letters.
