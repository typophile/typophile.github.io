  body: "It's likely that the white line through the letters was added later, and
    is not part of the font. You could use a number of Techno fonts, such as [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/space/|Space]]
    just by slanting the letters and adding the white line.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    Labels</a> we could use. You should however, try to find smaller <a href=\"http://www.emanprinting.com/sticker-printing/Wholesale-Stickers.php\">Wholesale
    Stickers</a>. That way you get more for your money and they'll fit into the squares
    on the calendar.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
