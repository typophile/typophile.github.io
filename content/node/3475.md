body: Did anyone else get a strange email from TestPilotCollective with .zip attachments?
  I didn&#39;t open them, cos they looked a bit suspect. Anyone from TPC confirm or
  deny that I am paraniod? <BR> <BR>kris.

  body: Pretty much all viruses are PC viruses. That doesn&#39;t mean that you don&#39;t
    need any virus protection if you are using a Mac since it only takes one. <BR>
    <BR>Chances are that the testpilot mail server isn&#39;t really the problem. Many
    recent viruses will spoof the sender&#39;s email address so that it looks like
    it is coming from someone it isn&#39;t. <BR>Here&#39;s how it works. Someone sends
    an email to TPC, adding the TPC email address to their address book. They also
    have Kris in their address book.  This person gets the virus as an email attachment,
    and opens the file, infecting their system. What the virus does is send out a
    bunch of emails &#40;with a copy of itself attached&#41; picking out random people
    from the address book for both the &#34;to:&#34; and &#34;from:&#34; fields.  This
    way it looks like the email came from TPC. <BR> <BR>Does that make sense? <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1001-916945.html">This</a>
    might be a little clearer.
