body: Has anyone ever found a way to output items like the GSUB Feature values, back
  out to say imagemagick? For example, sending unicode values is no problem, but since
  items like SALTS don't have a unicode value, how can you print those items to image
  in say imagemagick/php? Any ideas?

  body: "BKKMLL,\r\n\r\nThe rendering process should look like the following: \r\n\r\n1.
    You feed in a Unicode string (for plain characters, not the alternates), the font
    and a set of OpenType Layout feature tags into an OpenType Layout library such
    as HarfBuzz, ICU Layout, Uniscribe or the Adobe Flash Text Framework.\r\n2. The
    OpenType Layout library analyzes the Unicode string and the font, and applies
    the transformation of Unicode codepoints to glyph IDs and their positions using
    the OpenType Layout rules included in the font's GSUB and GPOS tables. \r\n3.
    The font information, the sequence of glyph IDs and their positions are then fed
    into the rasterizer such as FreeType or the system rasterizers, which produces
    a bitmap image (in a memory buffer). \r\n4. The bitmap memory buffer is fed into
    a tool such as ImageMagick, PIL or any other image processing library, and a formatted
    image (e.g. in the PNG format) is produced. \r\n\r\nThis means that for use with
    PHP you need a tool that glues together HarfBuzz, FreeType and perhaps ImageMagick
    (or libpng or something similar). You should not deal with the unencoded glyphs
    in any way -- this is what the OpenType Layout layer (the first one, i.e. HarfBuzz)
    needs to take care of. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the opensource community so far
    has failed to produce such a tool, while in fact it'd be a simple undertaking
    (probably some 2-3 days of coding tops). \r\n\r\nThis is why I've linked to the
    HarfBuzz mailing list, where I've been raising this issue regularly for quite
    a while. The developer of HarfBuzz Behdad Esfabod wrote in the linked thread that
    if he gets \"kicked\" regularly on this, he might finally do it -- so I recommend
    that you join that list and postulate this as well. \r\n\r\nThe only workable
    and simple enough solution I've found so far, which enables typesetting with OpenType
    fonts using OpenType Layout features is to employ XeTeX+XeLaTeX. The simplest
    way is to install the TeXLive distribution on the server, have PHP generate a
    .tex file, call xetex or xelatex, grab the output PDF and feed it into ImageMagick,
    GhostScript or other PDF-to-bitmap conversion utility. \r\n\r\nXeTeX/XeLaTeX include
    an integrated version of the OpenType Layout library ICU Layout, which does all
    the processing of the GSUB/GPOS tables behind the scenes. The workflow is not
    superfast, but quite easy to implement. \r\n\r\nI've put up some quickstart TeX
    samples here: \r\nhttp://www.twardoch.com/tmp/xetex-typesetting-samples.zip\r\nI
    hope they're clear enough to follow and modify. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam\r\n"

  body: "BTW, the TeX samples I've posted product the following results (reduced in
    size): \r\n\r\n<code>xelatex-multiline-1024x768.tex:</code>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/xelatex-multiline-1024x768_3778.png]\r\n\r\nand\r\n<code>xetex-sample-cropped.tex:</code>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/xetex-sample-cropped_3822.png]\r\n\r\nIn
    XeTeX/XeLaTeX, you can easily specify the OpenType Layout features to be applied
    as in <code>+smcp,+onum,+pnum</code>. Unlike other primitive methods that try
    to read/process OpenType Layout tables directly (say using FontTools/TTX), this
    method also works with Arabic or Indic scripts which require special processing
    by the OpenType Layout library. ICU Layout is such a library that is quite full-featured
    in this regard.\r\n\r\nI think this might be what you need. (It's certainly what
    *I* need :) ). \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam\r\n"

  body: This does look truly interesting, albeit slightly intimated as its yet another
    thing I have to try and learn or figure out. I feel I keep going in circles, as
    I have spent close to a year trying to resolve this, getting php to render opentype
    fonts the same as you could do in any Adobe application. But so far, using TeX
    as you show above looks truly amazing...I will look into this more, thanks. I
    wonder if Behdad Esfabod would develop the php extensions if he was paid?

  body: "BKKMLL, \r\n\r\none more option could be to use Prince XML: http://www.princexml.com/\r\n\r\nIt
    also supports Unicode and OpenType, and renders PDFs (which you can convert into
    PNGs). It works on a server and it takes HTML & CSS as input, rather than the
    specialized TeX syntax. \r\n\r\nThis means that you could make HTML+CSS page layouts
    that use OpenType fonts with features, run them through Prince XML on your server,
    get a PDF and convert it into PNG. Prince XML is a commercial application, though.

  body: HarfBuzz already have a command line tool that renders text to a png file,
    "hb-view", I think one can call that from PHP, no? it does not support font feature
    selection yet, but I think if few more people asked for it (I did already) it
    might get implemented.

  body: "@twardoch \r\nI am coming back to all this again, had to take a break from
    it, heh. So, I was looking at your TeX examples more, and all your info again,
    this is really looking amazing. I feel as though trying to just use PHP and some
    of these other type libs, is just not cutting it. In your multiline example, thats
    very nice, and it seems to be reading the font very well, seems set correctly,
    etc. I have noticed setting type in Imagemagick has its faults, many times with
    the kerning settings in a font.\r\n\r\nSo makes me wonder, how difficult would
    it be to work with Tex as you mentioned. For example, having this run on our linux
    web server, setting up a layout like that, and then converting that TeX file to
    say a png as you mentioned (using IM I assume).\r\n\r\nI also like you idea about
    using just html and css to putput the charmap, and then use some php extension
    to render that page to a image (screenshot it per say). Before i jump into that
    though, can you output those \"non-unicode\" like values to html as of yet? Have
    you seen anything working like this yet?  \r\n\r\nI also took a gander at that
    mention of the Adobe Flash Text Framework. While I do not favor flash at all,
    I have to say I was impressed with how well that was performing in the examples.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the help so far, and sorry for all the questions. My coding levels only go
    as deep as web stuff, so this is sort of like walking down a dark alley right
    now.."

    do this you need: a b c = awesome font image  . I mean there are tons of silly
    php font-to-image scripts (which commonly only work with TTF), but they are actually
    quite awful for the fonts presentation, as they are typically not rendering the

  body: "Tom, \r\n\r\nI have very good news for you. My laments have worked and Behdad
    Esfabod has written a small tool \"hb-view\" as part of the HarfBuzz project:
    \r\nhttp://cgit.freedesktop.org/harfbuzz/tree/src/hb-view.cc\r\n\r\nYou need to
    install or compile the following packages on your server: glib, cairo, freetype
    and the Git version of HarfBuzz from: \r\nhttp://cgit.freedesktop.org/harfbuzz/\r\n\r\nThe
    usage is very simple: \r\n<code>hb-view --background=00000000 --features=onum=1,calt=1,dlig=1
    --font-size=72 --foreground=FFFFFFFF --line-space=30 --margin=10 --output=test.png
    fontfile.otf \"Text to display as UTF-8\"</code>\r\n\r\nSo you specify the font
    file (.otf or .ttf), the list of OpenType Layout features, the text and a few
    other parameters (--background and --foreground are RGBA where A is alpha transparency),
    and of course a PNG file (if you omit it, the tool will feed the PNG stream into
    stdout, which you can of course capture from PHP). There are a few more options
    (for script, language and direction if you deal with non-Latin), which you can
    look at in the source code of the tool. \r\n\r\nThe tool is actually very small
    and very clearly written. I don't read C++ at all, but I was able to read the
    source of hb-view and figure out exactly what each part is doing and how. By modifying
    the source of hb-view a bit, you're even able to replace the PNG output with SVG
    or PDF because the underlying graphics library (cairo) supports those backends.
    \r\n\r\nUsing hb-view way easier and much faster than using XeTeX. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam"
