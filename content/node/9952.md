body: Hi Guys! This is my first post. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d just like your thoughts on
  a logotype i&#39;m playing around with for a Healing and Thearapy centre called
  Sanctum based in the UK. They offer services such as past life regretion, indian
  head massage, Hypnotherapy, Aura cleansing, Reiki and many more. The designs I have
  produced try to reflect an inner Sanctum using circles as the basis for my design.
  Also the design with the earthy coloured rings represents the different services
  that Sanctum provides. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d just like your thoughts please, it would
  be greatly appreciated! <BR> <BR>Goose.

  body: I&#39;m not a big fan of the letterspacing of your type on the business cards.
    I don&#39;t think it adds to the design. It just looks like a mistake.  <BR> <BR>On
    the colors, they are nice, but If you are going to print them make sure they are
    able to be made from cmyk mixed inks, or your printing bills will be enormous.
    If they are only for on-line presentation they are fine.

  body: For me, the circle design, while appropos, seems too similar to the <a href="http://www.lucent.com/">Lucent</a>
    logo.

  body: I agree with John, it is far too Lucentesque. Landor Associates and Lucent
    may not be pleased.

  body: Yeah I&#39;ve taken the colours into consideration.Thanks guys, I havent seen
    the Lucent ID until now.  <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s another option using the same colours.
    I dont&#39; feel it&#39;s as strong but hey i&#39;m still in the early stages
    yet.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/68134.jpg" alt="sanctum

  body: Also this is another direction. Trying to get across an aura/energies in a
    graphical way. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/68138.jpg"

  body: Maybe Zennists world wide should have a class action against Lucent then for
    stealing one of their ancient symbols, the Zen circle. If they can appropriate
    it, I think Ian can for a healer. If you look at some Zen calligraphic sights
    I think you might find a different interpretation, Ian. This is one of the main
    exercises in shodo, the way of the brush. <BR>Good luck on your logo

  body: Thanks Paul I appreciate your comments. Maybe I should have mentioned Zen
    is an area I had looked at due to researching Reiki and acupuncture. I&#39;ll
    take a further look at Zen symbols. <BR> <BR>Cheers guys.
