  tool for finding errors in [[TrueType]] and [[OpenType]] fonts. Contour errors,
  encoding problems, and similar low-level issues are identified by the tool. Many
  of the same problems are found by [[FontLab]], but Font Validator is freely licensed
  to members of the <a href=\"http://groups.msn.com/MicrosoftFontValidatorCommunity\">Font
  Validator community web site</a>, so it's a quick and easy way to determine whether
  fonts are correctly built, regardless of how they're made."
