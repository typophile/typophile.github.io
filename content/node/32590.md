  books ? I'm a French graphic design teacher and I'm struggling every damn week to
  find proper description data of posters, magazines, ephemera, etc. (size, printing
  technique, etc.) for my graphic design/typography history course \u2014 when these
  facts are commonplace for any painting in any art history book. Are these concerns
  completely irrelevant ? Am I the only teacher around with this kind of problem ?\r\nFor
  instance, does ANYONE know the exact size of Swiss \xAB Neue Grafik \xBB magazine,
  launched in 1958 by Vivarelli, Neuburg, Lohse and M\xFCller-Brockmann ? Thank you
  very much.\r\n\r\nPS : Please forgive me for my poor command of English writing."

    and printing in design reviews, but a small bit of help could be had from <a href=\"http://www.abebooks.com\">abebooks</a>
    to fill in the gaps. Not everyone who sells there gives complete information,
    but sometimes people are very thorough. I think of it because items like Neue
    Grafik are the sort of thing I see for sale there. Search for the item, and if
    anyone is offering one, see their description.\r\n\r\nYour command of English
    is superb, and sadly much better than that of many Americans. "

  body: "<em>Are these concerns completely irrelevant ?</em>\r\n\r\nNo, but I don't
    think they make much difference.\r\nI recently went to an exhibition, Avant-Garde
    Graphics 1918-1934, from the Merrill C. Berman collection. The catalog was very
    well done, and indeed has size and media annotated in the List of Works at the
    back. But in the front of the book where the reproductions are, there is no mention
    of size in their captions. This is extremely misleading, as a huge work like Theo
    Ballmer's \"buro\" poster of 1928 is reproduced smaller than magazine covers.
    There is no sense of scale. It's all about layout: the layout of the history book,
    and the layout of the works shown in it.\r\n\r\nIdeally, works should be shown
    in correct relative scaling, and with an excerpt of type at 100%, because the
    effect of typography is, of course, fundamentally size-specific.\r\n\r\nFor an
    article in <a href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/Assets/Depts/Essays/4theMass.pdf\">Druk
    No.8</a> (171mm x 314mm, CMYK offset on uncoated stock, perfect bound, soft cover,
    2001, edited by Jan Middendorp, published by FontShop Belgium), I showed type
    specimens at 100%, but was not able to reproduce the pages they came from at a
    consistent relative size. The reason is that a reproduction of a large magazine
    page, already considerably shrunk, would have been next to a reproduction of a
    small magazine page surrounded by white space. To the reader, it would seem strange
    that the smaller page wasn't the same size as the larger one, when there was space
    for that, and the layout would have looked nice and consistent. \r\n\r\nIn general,
    it seems that the expectation of a design history book is that the layout should
    look sweet and tasty, and this is more important than mere documentation. \r\n\r\nAt
    the other extreme is brilliant research with abysmal reproductions -- two examples
    which spring to mind are \"Spaces of Type\", with illustrations of Aldine books
    that are poor photocopies, and Alphabets to Order, where many of the scans of
    19th century type books could have easily been improved by a little photoshop
    work with a gradient mask. \r\n\r\nThe best magazine reproductions I have come
    across are in the catalog of the Fotograf\xEDa P\xFAblica exhibition, where the
    documents have been opened, flattened with glass, and photographed and reproduced
    with a vignetted dropshadow, as <em>objets</em>. (This was also the technique
    I used for my Druk article.) However, the dimensions of the works are not included
    in the Fotograf\xEDa book.\r\n\r\nAnother outstanding documentation is Baker and
    Bretano's <em>The World on Sunday</em>, where 1890s newspapers were photographed
    using a view camera and reproduced in a large book. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "This is a pretty crappy excuse, but it's probably because graphic design
    history is a pretty new field, and most of the people writing the books are not
    historians, they're designers. These books are not written as part of a grand
    tradition that's evolved since Vasari wrote the <em>Lives</em>. They're also often
    writing the books alone, without a cadre of interns to do things like excessive
    fact-checking, which doesn't help.\r\n\r\nIt will get better in time. There are
    more design history books popping up than ever before, and future authors will
    be fixing the mistakes of their predecessors. "

  body: "Nick \u2014 I agree that the sense of relative scale is much too often sacrified
    for the sake of a cool layout. The \"Avant-Garde Graphics\" catalogue you're writing
    about is indeed not flawless in this respect, but at least the description data
    is available somewhere in it.\r\nIt is very difficult to give students a sense
    of respect for graphic design history (as something distinct from/as valuable
    as art history) if crucial data about the physical nature of artefacts seems to
    be less important in one case than in another (I don' know if I'm making myself
    perfectly clear here)."

  body: i don't think the real issue is that the history of the field is short but
    that graphic design and, shoulder-to-shoulder, type design are (by practical nature)
    fields of ephemera. it usually wasn't until much after the fact that an item might
    be looked at with the "hey -- THIS piece might be important someday" viewpoint.
    that's starting to change, of course, but i can say it wasn't until 15 years ago
    that the college at which i teach classified graphic design as an "art." before
    that, it was a "craft," a distinction that carried a lot of connotations with
    it.

    you're quite right, most other printing is termed \"ephemeral,\" and to a large
    extent aimed at a very current audience, with an understanding of both time &
    place. The latter would be as or more important than the technical details such
    as \"what size type,\" which is often only an an answer to \"what fits?\""

    of information about them was even purposeful, keeping them just a bit more in
    the realm of the mysterious?\r\n\r\nbut most magazines -- even Neue Grafik --
    have always had a different focus.\r\n\r\neven things that eventually are seen
    as important can be lost in the flood. i am envisioning a 1939 market owner glancing
    down, reading \"Border Skirmishes in Poland,\" and thinking, \"hmmm...\" as he
    wrapped a fish. that same newspaper would be an interesting find in an attic today."

    of Printing, Larry Oppenberg pointed out that at the time the focus of big companies
    like Linotype was on selling the machines, and type was a means to that. And there
    was continual change in the machinery of typesetting and printing from 1850 until
    the digital age. And it is still going on with direct to plate. \r\n\r\nBut what
    turned out to be of most lasting value, Oppenberg--a type designer--pointed out
    were the typefaces. With every change of technology they were redrawn and revived.
    The work of Griffo, Garamond, Caslon, Baskerville, Bodoni we still look at daily,
    when the machines are only in a few museums. "

    such, any particular physical iteration lacks the presence of the single art work,
    and reproduction of the image becomes as good as the original -- in the way that
    an ad may be scaled for poster, full page, or smaller."
