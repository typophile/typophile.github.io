  editors absolutely hate Gridnik and fonts like it. I'm curious about this one and
  am open to any other suggestions.  Thanks in advance!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Rounded

      it. Thanks for the other suggestions. I love Oxide. If only it had a lower case.
      Stratum is a solid suggestion as well. \r\n\r\nMuch appreciated Stephen.\r\n\r\n\u2014
