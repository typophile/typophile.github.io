body: Hi - I hope someone can help with my problem here. Although I am not new to
  InDesign, I'm new to style sheets, but have found them very easy to use. I'm working
  on a magazine and have all my style sheets set up for headline, body, etc. I've
  inserted 8 new pages and on the first new inserted one, I imported my .doc and went
  to apply my styles and none of them apply correctly. In fact, not even close - they
  all look like my subhead when I apply them. The style does not have a + after it,
  so it thinks it's totally applied. When I open the style, it says it's 47 pt, etc.,
  but the type is still 14 pt, etc. The styles are fine on the pages I created previously.
  Can anyone tell me what's going on? Thanks in advance for your help.

    that I was not sure if I'd really call it that.
