body: "Where do I buy it? I'm interested in the family, but the one I really need
  right now is Prosper Open CD Black.\r\n\r\nFound about it in MyFonts, there it is
  listed as a Monotype Imaging font by Joe Nicholson (but it's not on sale there).
  When I click the Buying Choices link, it takes me to Fonts.com, but the font is
  nowhere to be found in that site...\r\n\r\nThis is for a commercial package design,
  and while I can always \"cheat\" it and make it to look exactly like the aforementioned
  font, chances are the client is going to ask for alternative designs or changes
  to text (as they always change it, usually the same day you're sending it to press)
  and it will be annoying and time-consuming if I don't have the font ready.\r\n\r\nThank
  you guys."

      contacting them will be the only way to get it. Oh well."
