  I have settled on what I feel to be a suitable logo for myself when doing freelance
  work (as a client I am a pain in the ass). The only problem is that I can't seem
  to turn my lower-case \"p\" into a question mark without losing the awesome sci-fi
  retro curves of Magistral Extra Bold OT. The standard ? that is part of the character
  set is no help as it in turn looks nothing like a \"p\".\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/knownspace_6199.png]\r\n\r\nTerrible
  attempts at conversion (and the original ?)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/knownspace2_6333.png]\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas? About anything I mean, I'm at the point now where I feel I might have \"settled\"
  for Magistral when something better is out there waiting!"

  body: Have you tried using the p but cutting out the back of the stem where it meets
    the bowl?

  body: I have, it looks very empty and loses the rigidity. I also tried horizontally
    flipping the c but again it lacks that solidity.

  body: "I wouldn't connect the descender with the dot though...\r\n\r\nThat would
    take the ?-mark's easy recognisability, and I think the \"broken\" as you call
    it descender is not necessary: you can interpret it as a small-caps P as well...\r\n\r\nBut
    it's up to you :-)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd I'm happy you like it, I'm happy I could help."
