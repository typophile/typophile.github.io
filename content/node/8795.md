body: I know that there are tons of 40s-50s style stuff available on-line from CSA,
  but I&#39;m looking for more late 60s to early 70s stuff. Searching on eBay for
  &#34;clip art books&#34; is a waste of time, but I&#39;m sure if I knew the titles
  of some of the more commonly available books of print shop clip, I could start with
  a more focused search. <BR> <BR>Anyone have some suggestions? Thanks.

    <BR>Some of the House ones are in the date range. <BR><a href="http://www.letraset.com/uk/info/products/Phototone-Clipart.asp"

  body: I had forgotten about the Dynamic Graphics stuff. They did the &#34;Clipper&#34;
    series of stuff right? I suppose I always associated their stuff with the 80s,
    since we had stacks of their catalogs at the print shop I worked at in the early
    90s, and they were filled with Nagel rip off illos for nail salons and &#34;half
    off designer fashions&#34; ads, along with checkerboard patterns, paint splats,
    and other assorted 80s-ness. <BR> <BR>Isn&#39;t the Letraset stuff mostly patterns
    and what not? I have thier 1994 catalog, and it&#39;s still stuffed with transfer
    type and Pantone paper. Ah, the olden days. <BR> <BR>The House stuff is great,
    but I&#39;m looking more for the whole ironic type of illustration. Good because
    it&#39;s bad. <BR> <BR>Thanks for the suggestions!

  body: So, Nick, are you saying I should learn to appreciate all of that bad Nagel-esque
    art? I guess when I start designing retro 80s album covers or rock posters, I&#39;ll
    be wishing I had a collection of that stuff to. ;&#41; <BR> <BR>On the serious
    side, I don&#39;t see appropriating bad 60s/70s art as any different from using
    old Victorian art in an ironic way. We as designers have a massive amount of visuals
    available to us, and we know very well the power of recontexualizing imagery.
    Plus, without that concept, we wouldn&#39;t have great artists like Ed Fotheringham
    or great designers like Art Chantry. <BR> <BR>Tim -- thanks for the heads up on
    the older Letraset catalogs, I&#39;ll see what I can dig up.

  body: '&#62;appropriating bad 60s/70s art <BR> <BR>Sean, I have a number of objections
    to your method of &#34;recontextualizing&#34; as a modus operandi. <BR> <BR>In
    the first place, it&#39;s intellectually lazy. I could be more forgiving if I
    thought that, like Max Ernst &#40;Une Semaine de Bonte&#41;, you would be using
    collage to create startling surrealist juxtapositions. But the trends today are
    &#34;retro is cool&#34;, and &#34;scrap-booking is us&#34; which aren&#39;t the
    same.  Please explain why &#34;bad is good&#34; is not just banal. Surely, when
    we&#39;ve had the ghetto DIY retro T-shirt featured in a Macdonald&#39;s campaign,
    this trend is over. Or as they say now, &#34;so gay&#34;. <BR> <BR>In the second
    place, it&#39;s plain old lazy, using pre-fabricated materiel for one&#39;s art,
    especially clip art.  <BR> <BR>Thirdly, why not express your own era in an original
    way, using the media of today creatively, rather than just shuffle around cliches?
    Yes, I know the problem that it so easily comes out looking slick and corporate,
    but shouldn&#39;t we make some attempt to move beyond self-loathing? <BR> <BR>Fourth,
    why not support your peers -- illustrators. <BR> <BR>Fifth, &#40;to add to Tiffany&#39;s
    distinction between good art and bad art in cliches&#41; specific to your production
    method: by using retro clip art to poke fun at an era, you are taking a cheap
    shot. Of course, because it would have cost a lot more, or been illegal, to use
    original art from the era, or commission/originate something in that style.  <BR>
    <BR>Besides, who are you trying to fool? -- Fess up, you&#39;re a kitsch-fiend,
    you actually like that bad old stuff at face value but are too embarrassed to
    admit it, and so hide behind an &#34;ironic&#34; posture :-&#41;'

  body: Nick,  <BR>First, your respect might be misplaced, the Letraset images I was
    describing were not good, they were a generic pastiche of other, better illustrations.
    <BR>Second, maybe your prejudice is doing Sean a disservice. Respect may have
    to be earned, but it shouldn&#39;t be jettisoned until you have something to base
    that respect &#40;or otherwise&#41; on. <BR>On the other hand, I do like kitsch.

  body: Tim, it wasn&#39;t the retro stock images I was respecting, but the style
    of the era they came from.   <BR>In general, stock is detrimental to artists/photographers,
    because it lowers the price that can be charged for original commissioned work,
    and because it puts so much of the fee into the pockets of middlemen. <BR> <BR>However,
    there is some stock, such as the recent Getty theatre shoot, that would be prohibitively
    expensive to commission. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m also somewhat hypocritical, having released
    a set of retro RF stock photos on fStop, but those shots are original now, in
    a sense, in that they&#39;ve never been released before.  <BR> <BR>I am prejudiced
    against retro, based on how people typically repurpose old images. <BR>However,
    once in a while I come across something old-new that&#39;s different, like The
    Triplets of Belleville. So, go Sean, mash it up good.

  body: 'Nick, you have some good points, but as you mentioned, folks like Max Ernst
    have used existing art to create new art. <BR> <BR>The work that I&#39;m doing
    lately is rock posters &#40;which I do for free tickets and free beer, so that&#39;s
    why I don&#39;t hire an artist -- there ain&#39;t no money to do so&#41;. The
    audience I&#39;m designing for enjoys kitsch imagery, it will bring people to
    the shows. The bands like the posters for same reasons. <BR> <BR>Why is &#34;bad
    is good&#34; not just banal? Borrowing from the definition of irony from the dictionary:
    The use of images to express something different from and often opposite to their
    literal meaning, and employing such contrasts for humorous or rhetorical effect.
    I like irony. I guess that the design style that appeals to me most has a touch
    of humor to it. Something to engage the viewer, give them a little personal interaction
    with the piece. <BR> <BR>Slick corporate work &#40;gosh though, a lot of that
    uses stock photos doesn&#39;t it?&#41; is the pablum of the design world. Any
    half-assed designer can knock out brochures that have an image of some business
    transaction and some type set in Garamond. We&#39;ve all had to do work like that.
    It&#39;s boring. Not to say that it can&#39;t be done amazingly well, but most
    of it is bad. <BR> <BR>In my day job, I commision over $100,000 a year in new
    art. I love commissioning art. It&#39;s fun, I get to pay artists well for work
    that they enjoy doing. It&#39;s given me a huge amount of professional pride in
    doing right by artists. But that&#39;s my day job. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m a big fan
    of Art Chantry &#40;I&#39;ve taken classes from him, and enjoyed talking to him
    as well&#41;, and Jeff Kleinsmith. The craft that goes into that work is keen.
    I dig it. Repurposing art is a cool way of speaking to the audience. I don&#39;t
    design that way for a financial brochure, but I sure as hell will for a rock poster.
    <BR> <BR>There&#39;s some other folks I&#39;m not real keen on. Charles S. Anderson
    is one of them. The whole CSA archive seemed like a really cool idea to me, until
    they started to sell the images. I have books of clip with images from the 50s
    that are on CSA&#39;s web site, does that mean I can&#39;t use that stuff? Ridiculous.
    They copped images from the same sources that I did. There&#39;s line art of masks
    from the back of Famous Monsters of Filmland, there&#39;s stuff from old ad cuts
    and printer&#39;s clip books, however, to their credit, there&#39;s new stuff
    that is done in that style as well. I wish that CSA had kept those images to themselves
    instead of selling them. Something just seems wrong with re-copyrighting expired
    material. I used to love Anderson&#39;s design work &#40;and I still like the
    old stuff&#41;, but it&#39;s become such a vehicle to sell their art now, I feel
    as though it&#39;s just as bad as that boring corporate work. <BR> <BR>Am I a
    kitsch fiend? Sure. I love kitsch. I like that it&#39;s ironic, that it looks
    old, from another era, and I love that it is bad. It&#39;s like bad television.
    When I watch Fantasy Island or Knight Rider, I know it&#39;s bad. The direction,
    acting, set design, and plotting are all sub par. Yet, for some reason, you can
    enjoy it, if you put away your opinion of it&#39;s inate crappiness. You enjoy
    the crap. It&#39;s the same reason I like vernacular photography, and found imagery.
    It&#39;s just crappy stuff that you can make into art ala Warhol. <BR> <BR>And
    just so you guys can get an idea of what I&#39;m designing, here&#39;s a sample:
