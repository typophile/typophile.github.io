<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I was just wondering if I draw a glyph in a vector application so that the points are in extrema does a font creation application add more nodes.
For instance the bottom picture is a glyph that has points which I think are the minimum nodes necessary for the glyph. The upper character is a glyph that has been converted to an vector object and has more nodes. Would a font program add these extra nodes to the glyph?

<div class=commentbody>I'm not sure if I understand your question. When did it add those extra nodes, and in what application?</div>

<div class=commentbody><cite>When did it add those extra nodes, and in what application?</cite>
The above referenced image is just an example.
I was having a debate with a member in another forum and I was trying to explain to them that typically glyphs are done in a manner such as the bottom referenced image, but when you use the vector application (inkscape) it seems to add extra nodes to glyphs when they are converted to paths (curves). He said that the application would not include extra nodes and that they glyph already had them. I said I doubt that Frutiger would create a font that had 16 nodes in it to make the letter O it is more likely that he would have used 8 nodes.
So my question is would a designer actually use 16 nodes to make a san serif O or just 8?

<div class=commentbody>This can happen if the outlines are converted to a TrueType font along the way. TrueType does not use the same kinds of curves that are used in PostScript fonts and many drawing programs (Bézier curves). TrueType uses quadratic curves. When these are converted back to Bézier curves, you end up with more nodes.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Also, some designers don't always use what might be perceived to be the "minimum nodes" way of working. There are cases where a curve won't flow smoothly enough without adding a couple more points. This is hard to see and explain since the difference is quite subtle, perhaps even in-perceivable to a lay-person. Type designers are a perfectionistic bunch though so a minute change will seem imperative to them.

PS: the upper drawing has some points which seem illogical though.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks guys for the responses, I just figured I would ask those who know better about what they are talking about.
