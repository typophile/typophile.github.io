  nameplate in a condensed or tall serif, maybe transitional or modern. The magazine
  is the market leader so I want to convey a sense of prestige but am also looking
  for something distinctive.\r\n\r\nI'd really appreciate your suggestions! I love
  this board!"

    is underused and very elegant if used at a minimum of 36 pt.'

  body: "If you're looking for something a little more prosaic than the elegant Arepo,
    you might consider Whitman Display Compressed. The fonts are currently only available
    through the Font Bureau Studio library, but I'm hoping that we'll be releasing
    these to Retail in the next month or two.\r\n\r\nI show a few examples here: http://www.kentlew.com/WhitmDisOverview3.html\r\n\r\nAlso,
    a PDF here: http://www.kentlew.com/Type/WhitmanDisplay_Sample.pdf\r\n\r\nIf you
    can tell us the name of your magazine, I'd be happy to set a screen sample.\r\n\r\n--
