body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/imgpdh110807_4557.gif]\r\n\r\ni was wondering
  if certain types of letter forms are \"inappropriate\" for certain type styles.
  of course, the school book (or single-story) forms of a and g look funny in Bembo,
  but are they so bad in something like a revival of Johnston's Underground type?\r\nsecond
  question, is it irresponsible of a designer to make these types of alternates available?\r\nthird
  question, there is a strong correlation between some forms (a & g) and a weaker
  one with other forms (t & l). i'm sure the answer is \"it depends,\" but does anyone
  have examples of some of these conventions being successfully broken?\r\n\r\n<em>for
  the sake of transparency the original post is below, the original title of this
  thread was \"Is this sick and wrong?\" I prefer the ammended post above, but if
  you want to respond to the post below, feel free.</em>\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sickpdh110407_5926.gif]\r\n\r\nwell
  maybe that\u2019s a bit more emotive than i\u2019d like to be, but i wanted to show
  a few certain things and this text worked. what i\u2019d really like to ask is is
  the type above in the image above \u201Cinapropriate\u201D in any way? this is all
  i want to ask at this point. i\u2019ll give more context after a few initial reactions.\r\n\r\n(post

  body: "On the one hand, a copyist has a responsibility to the designer to stay true
    to his design, not to benefit from what is 99% his genius then piss on his grave
    by making arbitrary little changes that taint the flavor of the original because
    you think you know better than he did.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, times do change,
    and the typefaces that survive are the ones that are adapted to the changing times
    and new media, so prolonging the life and relevance of a design is a serious form
    of homage and myth-making.\r\n\r\nThe proliferation of characters in a font is
    a good thing, because it helps redesigners to solve the above dilemma by providing
    both an authentic version of the typeface, and a contemporary freshen-up. Then
    it's up to the users.\r\n\r\nWhile I was disappointed that Slimbach's Jenson has
    chopped a couple of serifs off the M, it was nice to see that he provides the
    fully serifed version in an alternate set. That was before OpenType.\r\n\r\nNow
    with stylistic sets, foundries can have it both ways more fully, and it's easier
    for users than having to find>replace individual characters to deploy the alternates.
    But one version still has to be the default, and I do think that the alternate
    suffers by not having default status, buried in application menus and requiring
    a sympathetic reading of support material (PDF specimen) to fully appreciate it.
    Why not make two fonts, Classic and Neue?\r\n\r\nI've always been impressed with
    the authenticity of P22's revivals, which show great respect for their sources.

  body: I think that the longer you've been designing type the more you learn, but
    at the same time you get more restricted to the ways "it should be". I feel that
    it's often the type designers who know their craft, but break away from restrictions,
    that do the most interesting work (Storm etc.). What works is in the eyes of the
    beholder.

    to cover International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) symbols, both single- and double-storey
    forms of \u201Ca\u201D will be required, since the IPA makes use of both glyphs.
    In addition, if the default \u201Cg\u201D is a double-storey form, then an additional
    single-storey form will be required, since it's the single-storey \u201Cg\u201D
    that is used by the IPA. Once you have those glyphs, it would be a simple step
    to designate them as alternates for the default \u201Ca\u201D and \u201Cg\u201D."

    letterforms. \r\nAn addition of a swash in normal letters may come from the original
    designers need to properly set a particular word with great flare.  - -  Or with
    the need to manage character spacing (by hand) when sign painting to monospace
    characters.  Fast Paced planning a Hand Painted sign is initially laid out in
    monospace when text is to be centered.  Try quickly making a hand painted sign
    from scratch on glass that is on a hung door.  It is far different from the modern
    vinyl cut sign lettering that is the norm now.  The hook tail on the lower case
    \"i\" may have come from such a monospace reason of character placement when hand
    painting a sign.  Many older fonts have origins in hand lettereing. It may even
    be a quirk of a single hand painting sign guy that loves the hook in his letter
    \"i\"(s)...  \r\n   \r\nAs in the sample the R and the K in CLERK  like forms
    emulateing one another and then there is the designers feeling of forcing differences
    to normmaly like forms such as a lower case L and an upper case i in the \"Daisies...\"
    Sample at the top of this thread.\r\n\r\nI would also consider the cap \"i\" in
    that sample sans font would likely be a simple vertical stroke without slabs.
    Most likely the same reason the lower L has the swash to prevent the uppercase
    i and Lower case L from being confused.  The lower r  emulates the lower c .  \r\n\r\nAlternates
    in the opentype fonts ability to contain extra glyphs also afford level 4 typesetter
    ( on a scale of 1 to 10 ) to take advantage of glyph alternates easily - with
    applications that support glyph replacement functions.  Opentype fonts can also
    fetch a higher price when they are extensively embellished with goodies or IMHO
    made correctly and with great care.\r\n\r\nthanks - versonova"
