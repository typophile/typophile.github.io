  body: Or initial cap, or drop cap if it top-aligns with the rest of its line, or
    rubric if it&#39;s colored &#40;I think&#41;. <BR>Or birdletter if it&#39;s Armenian.  :-&#41;

  body: Initial cap or drop cap don&#39;t convey the &#39;colorful or stylish background&#39;,
    since these may be plain. <BR> <BR>A rubric is properly a piece of text, traditionally
    coloured red &#40;hence the name&#41;, indicating appropriate movement or gesture
    during liturgy, e.g. &#39;The priest crosses himself with the paten&#39;. <BR>
    <BR>Love those Armenian birds.
