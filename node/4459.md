  &#40;<a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/27380.html?1078774045"

  <BR> regarding the typefaces used in Kill Bill. <BR> <BR>What I am particularly
  interested in is the typeface used for the end credits of the &#42;second&#42; movie.
  <BR> <BR>Justin Callaghan identified the type &#34;Busorama&#34; as one used in
  the film, and indeed it is very similar to the one I am looking for. However, there
  are distinct differences between Busorama and the actual type used in the film -
  note for example the serifs at the top of the &#34;A&#34; characters! <BR> <BR>Can
  anyone shed some light on this for me? <BR> <BR>Much appreciated, <BR> <BR><IMG

  body: well, it has some charcteristics of Emigre&#39;s Arbitrary, but it isn&#39;t
    a match.
