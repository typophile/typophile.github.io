  about a certain foreign type, a famous typedesigner or the typographical fact about
  a certain period in the history of man. And I would like to create a book for type
  specialists, about the Hebrew type. Because I'm simply fascinated by it's wonderful
  forms. \r\n\r\nFirst one little problem, I cannot read it, so that's a big minus.
  Second, the area of Hebrew type is too big. So I have te narrow my research area
  a bit. Do you have any tips or any categories in wich I can narrow it down? \r\n\r\nAnd
  if yes, where is the best place I can start looking? Mayb there are some awesome
  links out there. \r\n\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nA ductch typophile."

    narrow down the topic of Hebrew typography to a single great Hebrew type designer,
    Mr. Isamar David.\r\n\r\nMr. David passed away recently. So, information about
    him is readily available, even on the Internet. \r\n\r\nDavid had multiple designs
    and styles, in typefaces and art objects, to make a study of him varied and interested.
    He came from Europe, and lived in America; as a result, he multi-culture, and
    reflect not live as an Israel. Everything I mentioned is in print, and accessible.\r\n\r\nI
    don't think that there is another figure has all these qualities."

    about 1972 or so seems recent; probably I'm just getting old. (Since we are talking
    about human affairs, that it's definitely in the Late Quaternary, aka Recent,
    is not relevant.)\r\n\r\nI could mention the fact that Israel is a participant
    in the Eurovision Song Contest.\r\n\r\nBut, of course, neither of these things

  body: "David,\r\n\r\n\r\nIsmar David, German/Israeli/American (1910 - 1996)\r\n\r\nIsmar
    David, considered one of the few graphic designers, illustrators, and calligraphers
    of international reputation, was a\r\nGerman-born graphic artist who practiced
    the first third of his\r\nprofessional career in Jerusalem and the remainder in
    New\r\nYork City. \r\n\r\nIsmar David was born in Breslau, Germany (now Wroclaw,\r\nPoland)
    on August 27, 1910. At the age of fourteen, he left\r\nschool to apprentice as
    a house painter and varnisher. After\r\nreceiving his journeyman papers, however,
    he returned to\r\nstudy decorative painting at the Arts & Crafts School of Berlin-\r\nCharlottenberg,
    where many of the finest book craftsmen of\r\nthe first part of the century taught
    and studied.Hans Orlowski\r\nand Johannes Boeland were among his teachers.\r\n\r\nIn
    1932, at the age of twenty-one, Ismar David entered and won\r\nan international
    competition sponsored by the Jewish National\r\nFund for the design of its honorary
    Golden Book. He traveled\r\nto Jerusalem to supervise the execution of the project,
    and he\r\nsettled there for the next twenty years and established a studio\r\nfor
    interior and graphic design. \r\n\r\nBefore moving permanently to the United States,
    Ismar David\r\nmade several visits to New York City.His first trip, in 1939, was\r\nto
    work on the Palestine Pavilion at the New York World\u2019s Fair.\r\nIn 1947,
    he traveled to New York to study printing methods.\r\nWith the help of Dr. Robert
    Leslie, he returned in 1951 to make\r\narrangements with the Intertype Corporation
    for the casting of\r\nDavid Hebrew. And finally in 1952, David visited New York
    to\r\ndesign and install an industrial exhibition for Bonds for Israel.\r\nIsmar
    David emigrated to the United States in 1953, and on\r\nJune 3rd of that year,
    married Hortense Mendel. Ismar had met\r\nHortense, an associate of Robert Leslie
    at the Composing\r\nRoom, during his 1951 trip to New York to show Intertype hisHebrew
    alphabets. The two spent six years together before\r\nHortense died on October
    9, 1960.\r\n\r\nUpon his arrival in New York City in 1953, Ismar David established\r\na
    design studio and began teaching Latin calligraphy at\r\nCooper Union and Pratt
    Institute. \r\n\r\nIn the early 1990s, Ismar David continued to take on select\r\ncommissions
    for graphic design; however, he also expressed his\r\npersonal interest in three-dimensional
    form with the creation\r\nof such objects as a folding baby cradle and a paper
    Elijah\u2019s cup\r\nand folding seder plate. Before he died on February 26, 1996,
    in\r\nNew York City, Ismar David produced his 1996 greeting card\u2014\r\nthe
    last in a forty-odd-year series that traces the evolution of\r\nhis lettering
    and illustration styles, and the constant influence\r\nof biblical themes.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\nGermany

  body: "Every year, in Europe, there is a famous televised competition in which each
    country is represented by a performer singing a song. There is a strict rule that
    these songs must be original - and thus they must be songs not heard before.\r\n\r\nThat
    rule was made somewhat less strict when a song was disqualified because it's composer
    was overheard whistling it in a cafeteria before the competition date.\r\n\r\nDespite
    the name of the competition, in addition to European countries, Israel is represented
    in the contest.\r\n\r\nTwo well-known songs that were the winner of the Eurovision
    Song Contest were \"Waterloo\" by ABBA and \"Puppet on a String\" (Un Tout Petit
    Pantin) performed by France Gall; in that year's contest, another notable entry
    was \"Love is Blue\" (L'Amour Est Bleu) the entry for Luxembourg. Other notable
    winners include \"Tom Pilibi\", \"Poup\xE9e de Cire, Poup\xE9e de Son\" and \"Non
    ho l'Et\xE0\".\r\n\r\nIsrael's first entry in the competition was made in 1973;
    the participants are the member countries of the European Broadcasting Union.
    Israel was the winner in 1978 and 1979."

  body: "The reason I mentioned the Eurovision Song Contest in passing was simply
    to give a reason why people could refer to Israel as part of Europe - after all,
    although on the continent of Asia, it is in close proximity to Europe, and is
    a Western industrialized nation.\r\n\r\nOutside of Europe, the ESC may not be
    well-known. I first heard of it because Paul Mauriat's recording of \"Puppet on
    a String\" was used as the theme music to a locally-produced TV show here in Edmonton,
    Alberta - so I had purchased a copy of the LP, which noted that it was a European
    Song Contest winner under its listing on the record label.\r\n\r\nOf course, due
    to language barriers, and the unpredictability of public taste, many ESC entrants,
    or even ESC winners, did not go on to become major international hits, even if
    many of them were popular in their home countries. Thus, \"Tipi-Tii\", Finland's
    1962 ESC entry, sung by Marion Rung, was also recorded in a Swedish-language version.
    Finland's debut entry in that competition, from 1961, was [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qrZXmpj1g|Valoa
    Ikkunassa]] (Ett Ljus i ett F\xF6nster), sung by Laila Kinnunen. Both it, and
    she, are fondly remembered in Finland, but outside Finland and its neighboring
    Scandinavian countries (Laila Kinnunen, who performed contemporary popular songs
    on Finnish television for many years, sang many of them in their original English;
    also, as she was evacuated to Sweden as an infant due to the Second World War,
    she had to learn Finnish as she was beginning her singing career - so she also
    recorded some songs in Swedish, in which she was therefore fluent) both are doubtless
    quite obscure."
