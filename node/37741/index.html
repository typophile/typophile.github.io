This is my first post.
Hope that will be a learning place for me.
My first chalenge is to build a page layout for a magazine.
I want to create a Relationship between Headers/Indent/body.
I want inicialy start with free fonts (but we could use commercial also- I like minion for the Body by the way).
Modern/Serious/Traditional/Formal
Its a magazine for medical articles that will be mostly text with small illustration or photos.

Thanks in advance
António

I now this is a very subjective issue, but I want some opinions about fonts.
What I used here, what I saw there. The body in minion will be fine with the header in Arial and you could try to place the indent in italic helvetica, etc.
Since this is a medical magazine with articles I need some Modern/Serious/Traditional/Formal fonts.

I think if you are doing the body in Minion, then you should choose either Helvetica or Arial for heads and indents. Use the regular italic and/or bold for the heads, contrasting or matching the indent depending on the tone you need for the content. E.G. if it's a softer story, use Helvetica regular heads and regular or italic for the indent, or when you've got something harder, use the Helvetica bold for heads and sightly condensed italic for indents. If you want, you can also get a Minion Bold Condensed of some sort for heads. If you get enough Minion, you could easily do the whole thing in Minion for a Modern/Serious/Traditional/Formal magazine for medical articles.

Cheers!</div>

Now that I choose the type all minion, or minion + helvetica what about the best size and number of colums for cientific articles?
From my early studies
A4- 1,5cm from the border (all 4 sides), 2 colums with 8,5cm each (1cm in the middle).
Opinions?

I'm also considering to add a picture (or illustration) for each article in order to have a  more "colored" magazine. Not sure what to do in terms of sizes and place to put. Of course I can move them throw out the magzine but any suggestions are welcome (read someplace that they should not be placed in the middle (?!)).

		<div class="commentbody">Two columns sounds right for the line width you describe. You might find 1 cm gutter between to be a bit much. 1 pica is traditional and I think 1 cm is over 2 picas. Do a test and see, you might want to cut the gutter to 0.5 or 0.75 cm.

Many articles in scientific works start with an abstract, and this is traditionally set in a single column. Use a larger type size and an indent so that the line measure does not get to be too long.

Illustrations can be either one or two columns wide, as appropriate. A 1 column illustration in the middle of a two column layout can be problematic, as you have been told, because the word spacing around then (where the type goes to a half column) can be too loose.

What you really need to do is to build a dummy page now, to see how things look. Post the PDF and we will be better able to comment on it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">After seeing the first example, I was going to suggest the indenting of the abstract, which you have done on the second example. I suggest trying it at double the amount ... it may not look better, but it is worth a try (your goal is to keep that line of text in the 60-90 characters per line range, to improve readability).

Also, some publications will use italics for the abstract to signify it is not a part of the article itself. I'm ambivalent on that one myself. Blocks of italic can be harder to read, but a visual signal of uniquness is useful.</div>
