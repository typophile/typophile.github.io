<p>#3 - K-mart? Uh no. Not working. The &ldquo;K&rdquo; just doesn&rsquo;t work with the rest of the letter shapes here.</p>
<p>#4 - too thin, almost disappears - like it has no weight.</p>
<p>#5 - looks like it&rsquo;s a cheap logo for some band&rsquo;s &ldquo;MySpace&rdquo; site&hellip;</p>
<p>I would suggest further work on your concepts - right now these ideas seem a bit too random and incoherent with little underlying concept behind them.</p>

<p>OK, now&hellip;
my client is a 90 year old family enterprise.
They produce FIRST class machines (but NOT high price) with innovative details - but they NEVER communicated theyr USP!
For the last 20 years they were concentrated in developing perfect maschines - but they almost forgot to do marketing at all.
The head of the company is and always was TECHNICIAN not SALESMAN!</p>
<p>enough?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I was humourously referring to your comment, that may easily be perceived as quite childish.</p>
<p><em>[&hellip;] seems to be the only person who is really able to communicate</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten loads of very constructive, helpful and friendly advise and criticism on my typeface project here on Typophile after quite recently joining, all very well communicated, and most of them of immense value. After all, many of the members here on Typophile are among the absolute best type and graphical designers in the world.</p>
<p><em>And what’s you GOOD comment (?)</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in no way a logo designer, so I can only give you my opinion based on my non-professional taste: I don&rsquo;t like that joining of the letters, it packs an extreme mass of horizontal weight on the logo, while not communicating anything. That red stripe just emphasises it.</p>
<p>In fact, I think your best suggestion is the one with stencil letters. A non-grungey mechanistic black stencil type could work great. And that cogwheel-thing isn&rsquo;t bad, how about simplifying it (fewer and more distinct teeth), making it a full circle and use it as a little sun above the letters?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Okay I like the stripe. Maybe increase the stripe size a bit? Something like a fat racing stripe that suggests Engineering and Precision (as well as speed I suppose) - but you&rsquo;ll need to find the right balance in the stripe size. Maybe even reverse the colors (gray stripe against red letters)?</p>
<p>Satyagraha&rsquo;s idea is also a possibility - I&rsquo;d just loose the &ldquo;grunge&rdquo; texture if you do go down the stencil-letter route - you want good, clean, industrial engineering and design!</p>
<p>(I&rsquo;d also suggest that you stop throwing out less than helpful remarks about the community at large. Please exhibit a bit more patience with us, and if it&rsquo;s not too much, a touch of humility - this will go a long way to improving the quality of the responses you&rsquo;re receiving. It also helps to assume people here are helpful and good until proven otherwise.)</p>

Sounds good at the beginning&hellip; but I have to translate your idea word by word&hellip;</p>

I thought similar, but I&rsquo;m afraid of getting a tooo small wheel.
And therefore I tried to construct a mechanical part which looks like a RISING SUN&hellip;
As you can see the actual cogwheel is a little bit more then a semicircle (55%)
What do u think about that?

<p>The logos he liked:
<img src="/images/old-images/B5_1_6685.jpg" alt="">
and
<img src="/images/old-images/logo8_3896.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>It was a waste of time&hellip;
He didn&rsquo;t communicate the last results of the decisions of his company! :(</p>
<p>The new vision is:</p>
<ul>
<li>they wanna get rid of the family name&hellip; they wanna find a short word which discribes theyr ability.</li>
<li>they are specialised in constructing by modules (this means they are able to manufacture single machines - individual items - because of theyr developed modules)</li>
</ul>
<p>SO: Sorry for the first inefficient transition&hellip; and for the wasted emotions.</p>
<p>In the meantime I seem to be a relaxed pupil here - so my question:
Do you like to crit the RELAUNCH OF MY OWN LOGO??????</p>
<p>THX :)
Nice weekend</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>These two examples are  a step forward from what you&rsquo;ve presented to us before.</p>
<p>However, I&rsquo;m curious as to what kind of a design education you have, because everything I&rsquo;ve seen come from you seems very amateurish.</p>
<p>One thing I see in these is a need to work on getting visual balance and fixing your kerning in some spots.
In your first one, the E and R are too tight and the S and T are just a hair too open.</p>
<p>Second one: the circle is again causing strange spacing of the K from the rest of the letters, at least visually. I would avoid outlining type in most cases. In this case, the S is very distracting because of how close the strokes are together. This makes the letterform look heavier than the rest because optically, the lines blend into one at some point. The letterspacing around the T is again too open. &ldquo;Maschine…&rdquo; is too tightly tracked and close to the rest of the wordmark. Brought down in size, you won&rsquo;t be able to read it.</p>
<p>This website is a great reference for education on typography <a href="http://www.papress.com/other/thinkingwithtype/index.htm">http://www.papress.com/other/thinkingwithtype/index.htm</a></p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I don&rsquo;t want to be rude.  It is not my intention, but I must ask if you have any formal training.</p>
<p>Your diligence is your greatest quality.  Hold on to that, however, there are design choices that are not being made here.  The foremost is the question, &ldquo;What are you trying to tell us with this mark?&rdquo;  What I see happening is that you&rsquo;re doing your best to make this look cool and high tech, but there isn&rsquo;t a reason that we can see as to &ldquo;WHY&rdquo; you&rsquo;re doing it.  Start answering that question as literally as you can, with type or graphics (I push for type) and then expand on it.  Pick up a design book from Bob Gill or Paul Rand or Steven Heller.  Look to the greats to reach greatness.</p>
<p>best regards,
daniel</p>
