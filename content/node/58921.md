    that takes time...and not a one click thing.\r\n\r\ncheers :)"

  body: "The plugin solution is nice, except that:\r\n<code>In Illustrator, Path Styler
    Pro is a raster effect.</code>\r\n\r\nWhich kinda defeats the whole point of making
    your logo in illustrator :D\r\n_____________________________________________\r\nPersonal

  body: "That plugin looks like crap to me. One-click solutions are never the best
    solutions. Best to do things the \u201Cold fashioned\u201D way and use your pathfinder
    tool to make your own bevels, highlights, etc. "

    you to extrude and bevel, and map artwork. Adobe added it to Illustrator after
    discontinuing Dimensions.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bevel_4785.png]"

  body: "The only decent vector bevel program I have ever used is a program for sign
    makers called SignLab. It created true vector bevels that were very impressive.
    It would have been easy to reproduce that Budweiser bevel since each prism of
    the bevel was a seperate vector object that could have a gradient applied to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
