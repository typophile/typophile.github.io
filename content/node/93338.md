body: "Just released: New Cuisine.\r\nFrom MyFonts description:\r\nNew Cuisine is
  a departure from formal, handwriting, and retro scripts. Influenced by the DIY lettering
  generation New Cuisine is a joyful looking script with all the right moves. It\u2019s
  bold graphic presence makes it ideal for packaging, online journals and blogs, signage,
  logos, and menus.\r\nUnder the hood of New Cuisine lie precise connections, unique
  ligatures and alternates, and OpenType programming to orchestrate it all. Because
  of this, typesetting turns into a simple and playful experience. Also included are
  a simple fraction feature as well as Central European language support.\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/stephen-rapp/new-cuisine/\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NewCuisine_3_3690.png]"
