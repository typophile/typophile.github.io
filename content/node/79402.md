  body: Get a decent inkjet printer and use a simple stitched binding. Make sure to
    not get an Epson printer if you need to do a lot of these as the paper feeds on
    Epson printers are finicky and not suitable for a lot of pages.

  body: what i did was print them on top quality paper and I left them as single sheets(A3),
    I then found a nice black leather case to put them in.

  body: I use a color laser printer. I used to bind them together with a 2-hole punch
    and those medical folder clips. I don't bother with the binding anymore as they
    usually get taken apart and passed around during the interview anyways.

  body: "This is probably out of your price range (since you said \"cost effective\")
    but I'm starting to see folks put their portfolios on iPads.  \r\n\r\nFor printed
    pieces (a brochure or poster, for example) I'd rather have the actual printed
    piece to examine, but for showing electronic media (web pages, Powerpoints, PDFs,
    etc) an iPad works pretty well."

  body: "I did a horizontal 8.5x14 metal screwpost binder. It was about $60-70 I want
    to say but you can find similar stuff online if you're looking for cheaper versions.
    It's great if you need to switch/add stuff. Plus, it looks and feels cool.\r\n\r\nAlways
    a plus to take in actual printed samples if you have them for the interviewer
    to take a look at, especially if it's something more involved than say, a poster.\r\n\r\nBest
    of luck!"

  body: "If I were you, I would invest in really good printing on high quality paper
    stock. A print from a machine like the Indigo machine can have you go gaga over
    the richness of colour.\r\n\r\nI use an small SRA4 sized art cardboard binder
    that was a hand me down from a senior of mine and it is awesome."

  body: If you find the right deal for a print on demand publisher, you can probably
    get a well printed and bound, one-off, glossy book for less than ink jet cartridges
    will cost. My wife has found deals that are almost free except for shipping. I
    can't remember what or where those were, but we just used them for books of vacations
    photos.

    cost-effective way to do tiny runs of color booklets.

  body: It depends. How many projects is that? I did mine with 12 projects and then
    a spread of logos. You don't want your portfolio to feel too short, but if you
    don't have the amount of quality work to support it either, then you might be
    okay to leave it as is.
