body: "I\xB4m currently working on a project where we would like to use a font, which
  gives a handset type of feel. Preferrably a nice sans, but with some random adjustments,
  it might be varying heights, kerning, strokewidth etc. I\xB4m looking for a font
  that looks relaxed, as in not perfectly typeset, but keeps a luxurious feel. The
  font Social Gothic by Canada Type is close to where I\xB4m looking, but it should
  include both upper and lowercase letters, and the differences in the letters should
  be clearer and easier to see.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nI have an image in my head about
  what it should look like, but it\xB4s hard to explain clearly. It\xB4s use will
  be as display text on posters or headings etc.\r\n\r\nHope you guys can point me
  in a direction and than I can fill in some more comments as we go along.\r\n\r\nSocial
