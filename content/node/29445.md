  body: I would have said ITC Avant Garde Gothic Book, but the U and the T are wider
    in this example. Maybe someone else here can tell you if there is a wide or extended
    cut of AG Gothic in this weight?

  body: "No, I don't believe it's Folio SB, the \"O\" is much more round in this example
    than in Folio. And, at least to my eye, the attachment point of the angles to
    the uprights on the \"M\"s and \"N\" look just a little different.\r\n\r\nTo whomever
    edited the title to show that the font was found, please don't cut off discussion

    The 1960 or 1980 styles are a lot like Avant Garde, but the T and U are wider.

    you are a wonderful moderator. I like your spirit of playful competition, bonhomie
    and respect for all. In fact, all of the moderators here are excellent. (How many
    boards can you say that about?) They're a big part of what makes Typophile so
    good. \r\n\r\nSkylar"

    here. I don't post a lot, but it's a great board and anyone who's spent much time
    on the internet knows that comes from a sense of community nurtured and nudged
    by good moderators."

  body: "I completely agree about the great job Yves does, and have said so many times.
    We have given him a bad time about keeping solved threads open too long, but it's
    hard to decide in many cases whether the thread is done.\r\n\r\nAs for the O roundness,
    remember there are many graphic artists who are fond of distorting the type by
    making it wider, higher, narrower, etc. A word like 'COMMUNITY' gives very little
    'traction' for making an ID. The amount of closure of the C was really the most
    diagnostic feature that would not be easily altered by font tweaking.\r\n\r\n-
