    I have. Maybe I can upload it if you need it, when I'm back home again next week.

    DVD apparently contains the clip. It is out of stock at the moment, but youworkforthem
    may be able to help you. Try looking also under \"H5\" the name of the studio
    that made the clip. There may be something published in one of the \"GASBOOK\"
    series.\r\n\r\nhope this helps,\r\n\r\npete"
