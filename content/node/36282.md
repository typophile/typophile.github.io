  fonts bundled with Adobe apps are installed into \\Program Files\\Common Files\\Adobe\\Fonts
  rather than \\WINNT\\Fonts. This appears to make them available only to Adobe apps
  (and not MS Office or Quark).\r\n\r\nI can work around this by copying shortcuts
  to the required fonts into \\WINNT\\Fonts, but given I can only seem to find oblique
  references to this, I'm starting to wonder whether this is a bug or intended operation.
  Any advice?\r\n\r\n"

  body: 'I''m on a Mac, but the general setup is similar: the bundled fonts are automatically
    installed in an Adobe folder; to use them in other applications, I believe that
    moving the font files to the folder where you usually have active fonts installed
    would do the trick. They would still be accessible to the Adobe apps.'

    or shortcuts to them to the normal font folder works fine, but I wonder if there
    are licence considerations?"

    OK to move the fonts to another folder and use them with non-Adobe apps (assuming
    that you have a legit CS2 license to start with). BTW, starting from CS3 the fonts
    are installed in a system-level fonts' folder."

    machine.\r\n\r\nIs that your understanding from the EULA or do you have a definitive
    answer from Adobe?\r\n\r\nInteresting point on CS3."
