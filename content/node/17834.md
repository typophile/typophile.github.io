    annoying message number 1:\r\n\r\n- <strong>It's easier to identify a typeface
    than a font.</strong>\r\n(Whaaat!? You mean a typeface and a font are not the

    something is set in, it really depends on many variables. But when a person wants
    a font identified, one must really be a detective:\r\n\r\n- When was it done?\r\n-
    How big is the original sample?\r\n- What do you know about the production of
    the sample?\r\n- Why does it look subtly different than the samples you can find
    online?\r\n- If it's Bembo (or insert another type name here) why can't I match
    it?\r\nTo list just a few key questions."

  body: "The samples were done or rendered at 60 pts and the image is at 100% (though
    it depends on what display settings your monitor is set at).\r\n\r\nOne of the
    samples is hot metal, the others are all digital.\r\n\r\nA 60 pt hot metal type
    is designed differently than an 18 point hot metal type even though they are the
    same \"typeface\". Some digital foundries will or are trying to adapt for scalable
    fonts, while most produce a single master regardless of scale.\r\n\r\nThis is
    not meant as good or bad practice, but it will account for why certain pre-digital
    display size typefaces output differently than their digital counterparts.\r\n\r\n<em>Annoying
    message No. 3</em> >\r\nAn <em>expert</em> typographer will take into account
    all variants and renditions of a typeface. What works at 10 point for text may
    not work at all for display sizes. Selecting one foundry's font for body copy
    and another foundry's font of the same typeface for large display sizes may be
    what it takes to make the difference."

  body: "Selecting Bembo for the challenge was stricly based on getting a clean sample
    of the hot metal version at 60 pts. as well as there being several digital font
    versions available.\r\n\r\nBembo is essentially a text face, and scrutinizing
    it at large point sizes is almost pointless, unless it's going to be set for display.
    Selecting a typeface for bodycopy should always be done by examining blocks of
    text printed at high resolution (1200 dpi+). A pdf specimen file would give you
    such options for printing at hi-res, but sadly, such specimens are not always
    available for today's type specifiers."

    for a font/typeface ID is taking only a small part of the vast type expertise
    they offer for free, and even less than can be actually learned about type and
    how best to use it.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be a deepening and widening gap between
    graphic designers who can name a font and those who can use it well. Getting a
    chance to learn about the <em>black arts</em>, and what your mother wouln't teach
    about type is a gift that can be had, at least in part, from active participation
    in the forum.\r\n\r\nFinding out a font name is okay, but learning about type
    is better."
