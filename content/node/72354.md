  body: "Ok, my first bash at a critique - please bear with me.\r\n\r\nFirstly, I
    like the simplicity and concept of the emblem, but I feel that the extrusion applied
    to the R is a little inconsistent. The mixture of 0\xB0, 45\xB0 and 90\xB0 terminals
    are quirky, but could be better resolved. Also, the concentric curves look like
    they need to be better spaced - especially where the middle curve meets the leg
    of the R.\r\n\r\nThe font you've used for your name is fine, but the kerning needs
    looking at - in particular, the 'an' combinations in both words are too close
    together. I think you could increase the spacing of all the letters in 'Sloan',
    as the 'Rya' combination necessitates more generous negative space.\r\n\r\nAs
    for the last line, and this is possibly a personal preference, I'm just not a
    fan of that particular font - I find it far too dated, especially given the nature
    of the commodity it's advertising, and it does nothing to enhance the rest of
    the design. I don't think there's any need to use a combination of fonts in this
    logo - you may find using Maven throught yields a better result."

    needs the most work. Don''t you think there are enough sound wave logos out there?
    It''s terribly overused. '

  body: "@Alaskan - I agree. Sound wave logos are everywhere. They are especially
    in my client's design brief, as he specifically asked for them. So there is nothing
    I can do about that. Although I did come up with several concepts that I felt
    adequately illustrated the concept of sound. Can you offer any alternatives? \r\n\r\n@chr.s
    - Thanks for the helpful input. I chose Bank Gothic because it tends to be pretty
    legible at smaller sizes, for things like banner ads or business cards. However,
    I'm not stuck on it by any means, and I'm open to suggestions here. I will definitely
    post up a version that uses Maven for the tagline as well. Your kerning/tracking
    suggestions are spot on and I will make those changes as well.\r\n\r\nThanks again
    to both of you!\r\nI also look forward to any other comments/critiques from other
    members"

  body: "I love the mark. Although people may find it overused, it makes the purpose
    of your business clear. You did make it your own with the negative space of the
    reversed \"R\". A nice simple solve. Great job!\r\n\r\nI will have to agree with
    chr.s that the use of Bank Gothic is a bit jarring. Besides the personal aversion
    (which I share), the larger issue is that you've used 2 different sans serif fonts
    in the same context which breaks one of the fundamental rules of typography.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck. :)"

  body: "If you stick with mark: Let the counter shadow continue all the way around
    the curve and thin it at the bottom. The current solution doesn't look right.
    Also make the sound waves equal in weight and perhaps try extending them so they
    line up at 90 degrees. \r\n\r\nThe type is a disaster! "

  body: "@Frode - Can you narrow it down a little? I'm learning now that Bank Gothic
    just may be disastrous in itself, that on top of using two different Sans fonts
    in the same mark. And the kerning, I will do my best to fix that. What else? I
    have been following the forums for a few weeks now, and you always seem to be
    spot on with your critiques/advice. I am open to suggestions!\r\n\r\n@tbufano
    - Thanks for the kind words about the mark :)"

  body: "My English isn't all that good. I could show you a sketch of what I mean
    but then I would be the one designing and not you. \r\n\r\nOn the shadow: consider
    how it would look in real life. The inside counter wouldn't have a shadow that
    was cut off midways unless the counter had a very wierd shape. \r\n\r\nOn the
    sound waves: if they were the same weight as the shadow, I think they might look
    more like they belong (unless there's a reason why they have different weight).
    The waves are cut off by the leg in the bottom, and the same cut is mirrored in
    the top. That might work, but I would also try a vertical cut in the top just
    to see how it looks. It might help with the balance.\r\n\r\nBank Goth can look
    great used correctly. The problem with your pairing is the shapes don't belong
    stylistically. They are two different \"worlds\" mixed together for no apparent
    reason. And yes, that kerning is horrible ;)"

  body: Thematically, I think Bank Gothic can be really well suited to themes within
    3 decades of 1900. Got a brewery that's been around for a century? Bank Gothic
    might do the trick. When Bank Gothic used in a futuristic context it really makes
    my oatmeal hit the wall.

    Beware of Bank Gothic...bleurgh.
