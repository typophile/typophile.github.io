  trying to identify a font with a slab serif.\r\n\r\nI've looked at ITC Lubalin Graph,
  Rockwell, Karnak Pro and Museo. I thought I was very close with Museo but the uppercase
  A has a serif at the top that points to the right and the lowercase \"a\" is shaped
  differently. I also checked the alternate characters on these fonts and there are
  not characters that match this font.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts on what the name of this
  font is?\r\n\r\nThank you,"
