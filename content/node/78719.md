body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI was recently contacted by an American company that wanted
  to license a few of my fonts.(I am in the Netherlands myself) They told me that,
  in order for them to be able to pay me, I needed an ITIN (Individual Tax Identification)
  number, which could be given to me by contacting the IRS. They told me this number
  should be given directly over the phone, as other font creators whom they had contracted
  had done so before.\r\nNow I tried calling the IRS several times, but I always got
  the same answer: download form W-7, fill it out, send it back and an ITIN should
  be given to me within 10 weeks.\r\n\r\nNow my question is this: is there anyone
  who knows how to get such a number directly over the phone? Is there a specific
  institution I should call or ask a certain question or such?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for
  your time,\r\nJoe"
