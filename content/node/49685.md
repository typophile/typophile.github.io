    with ball-terminals for the <a href="http://typophile.com/node/33586">Kate Moss</a>

    my first attempts I had ball terminals on the a and s, but I got dissy looking
    a sample text with all those balls. Adding them as calt is a good idea.

    this, but I suspect the way you've gone with the half-ball terminals is more of
    a distinctive design, compared to other Didones. --I actually had a different
    idea in mind, but I like what you've done; it's got a nice combination of grace
    with still some of the geometric quality. "

    to choose \u2014 both can exist via stylistic alternates. Well, I guess he does
    have to decide on the default. But including both makes this a very versatile
    face. \r\n\r\nI think the main decision to make is whether this should pretend
    to be a text face. I would avoid that. Didones only succeed in text if they have
    <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/itc/itc_bodoni_six_std_book/\">significantly
    less contrast</a>, and extreme contrast (along with its stylized terminals) is

  body: I've made up my mind and go for the half-balls because they are more distinctive.
    As for now I'll leave the lc c with a "full ball". I will also follow Stephens
    suggestion of making contextual alts for lc a & s. Squidot (or perhaps Sidone
    or Yasmin; I would like to give a femine name) will definitely be a display face
    as it was intended from the beginning.
