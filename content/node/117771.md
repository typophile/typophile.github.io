  body: 'Very nice handwriting indeed...but just that--handwriting. None of the repeating
    letters are the same: 3 different a''s; 5 different t''s; 2 of the n''s are close
    but the other 2, nope; 4 different i''s and 2 varying s''s and o''s. There are
    a lot of handwriting scripts out there and one that is similar is Adobe''s Caflisch
    script. '
