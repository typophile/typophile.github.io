  ID the script typeface along the top of this image,\r\n\r\nAnd can anyone ID the
  compressed serif typeface in the following lines.\r\n\r\n...and no <strong>it's
  not</strong> Onyx or Bodoni Poster Compressed. Thats that I thought it was too,
  but if you look at the numerals, it's a dead giveaway that it is neither.\r\n\r\nThanks
  all.\r\n\r\n:)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fireworks_5254.jpg]"

  body: '''ON MAIN'' is a little thicker, but that''s obviously just b/c of the embossing
    effect done on it. It''s possible but highly unlikely the Bodoni Condensed Bold
    was customised slightly here, but they''re de&filig;nitely the same font here.'

    you?\r\nhttp://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=Adobe&ffam=Bodoni%20Condensed%20-%20Bold&fid=45de981ce3f1dc0c8b30bde37dc9a038&fsize=72&text=ON%20MAIN%20JULY%204TH%202014&wrap=2\r\n\r\nEdit:
    I think \"MAIN\" is processed/embossed/emboldened as Henry says and this is the
    only difference."
