  used on a poster during the Third Reich era. I'm looking for this or something very
  similar - a Calligraphic, Germanic/Celtic script style with a Blackletter aspect.
  Any suggestions at all would be appreciated."

    I'll see what I can dig out of my files, but you can start with Augsburger Schrift

    body: "Many thanks for the help Don. It seems like such an obvious, usable font
      yet I've searched the net for hours now looking for something even close, without
      luck. However, your suggestions for alternatives are useful - I think Fondamento,
      narrowed, might do the trick. But if you do find anything closer please let
      me know.\r\n\r\nI've found some other potential alternatives, in case it helps/interests
      anyone else - 'Typographer Rotunda' and 'Paganini'."

    it as the basis for a font. Did you check Dieter Steffmann's collection?\r\n\r\n-

    body: You may be right Mike - the thought crossed my mind. If hand-lettered it
      was done with extreme care and attention to detail (as designers of the past
      tended to do). But I still feel there must be something similar out there in
      font-form. It's such a usable typeface, particularly for the sort of work I
      often do.

  body: "Dieter Steffmann has many fonts, but I usually hesitate to link to them because
    of Dieter's practice of taking fonts that someone else had digitized, improving
    them by adding accented letters etc. and releasing them under a new name. Where
    possible I find the original work and link to it. We really could use a finder's
    list of the digital sources of his fonts. Note that some of his fonts could be
    his own digitizations of printed specimens. We could also use a list of those
    fonts.\r\nDon\r\n"
