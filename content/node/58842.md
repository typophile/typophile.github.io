    ago, and I sent in a bug report and told Adam about it online. Adam said it was
    a \"Known Bug\". Since it is so known and has been for 2 or more years, why have
    they not fixed it? Even if they just get rid of the button all together so a person
    does not accidentally use it, would be a BIG HELP!\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    one known bug for every feature in Fontlab. We\u2019re probably better off just
    waiting for that total rewrite we get with version 7.0. We can all live with the
    classes bug until 2013, right?"

  body: "@ David Berlow\r\n\r\n<em>Every once in a while, FL seems to completely lose
    all the changes made during a work session despite numerous savings.</em>\r\n\r\nYes,
    I had that and thought how illogical it was. It turned out that I have done a
    <em>Save as...</em> (without really thinking) and because I had been working on
    a completely different font in a different location, the file was saved in that
    really weird and rather arbitrary location. Hence I now had two files with same
    name in different places. Open the original (which you are confident of having
    overwritten) and it's the same old, same old. The key is to find if you did a
    <em>Save as...</em> and, if you did, where you saved the <em>Save as...</em> version.
    It might not be as bad as you think.\r\n\r\nOf course, it might be as bad as you
    think, it might be a bug and I gather that FontLab has a few of those. Nevertheless
    not many people stick up for its virtues in this forum. I like it, especially
    when it behaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    different name if a significant change has been done: Fondo01, Fondo02, Fondo03,
    &c. It is better for me, but as a side effect I have a lot of files for the same
    font, so if you are trying to simplify your directories, maybe this solution is
    not for you. Time Machine is a very good choice, as well.\r\n\r\nOn the other
    hand, I recall a couple of times when I just hit Command + S and said: \u201COuh!
    This is not supposed to be saved, it is just a test!\u201D Those old days, .bak
