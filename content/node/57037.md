  is not extraordinarily original or anything. But I actually made the mark for use
  on my website. With that in mind, I felt Georgia Bold was a safe way to tie a thread
  between easy web-fonts and the logo itself.\r\n\r\nWith a name like \"Chris\" I
  know it doesn't stand out much. But all attempts at my last name \"Meeks\" were
  coming up empty.\r\n\r\nFeel free to rip it apart if you like. \r\n\r\nThanks![img:sites/default/files/old-images/c_logo_5898.jpg]"

  body: "i'm curious why there's a difference between the connections of the CH and
    the IS along the x-axis. I realize the serif of the h is there, but does it have
    to be? Check pic to see what im referring to.\r\n\r\nBut then that leads me into
    the question of the half of the stroke on the I and the top half being different
    weights. I see why you did it, if the bottom half is the same width the connection
    between that and the S loses its weight...but it still bothers me any may need
    some kind of adjustment.\r\n\r\nbut i like it. good use of ligatures.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/c_logo_5898

  body: evanbrog's version has a very neat flow from C into the right stroke of H.

  body: I would make a suggestion for the ch, why don't you use a usual ligature for
    those two letters, by the top of the c and the h instead of their bottom?

  body: "Chris\r\n\r\nThis is fast and furious, down and dirty,  etc...\r\n\r\nI think
    you need to slim the joins, separate the i from the h and knock out the serif
    and I really think the ball serif needs to be incorporated into the s. Raise the
    branch of the r and heighten the i. \r\n\r\nRemember advice is free, that tells
    you the value of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/chris_6121.png]\r\n\r\nJust
    keep refining until you are pleased.\r\n\r\nEdit: yes I know all the balls are
    different. What do you expect after a whole day with a cardiologist : )\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: "Some really good thoughts here, thanks everyone.\r\n\r\nTo me, those inconsistencies
    I created by joining the letters don't jump out or anything. But that could just
    be because I am looking at it too long.\r\n\r\nLike the c-h connection actually
    feels like a good solid chunk to me. And cutting away that thick connection I
    made makes it feel awkward as a mark, though more accurate if you are thinking
    of the font.\r\n\r\nI like adding the ball to the end of the \"s\" though. I think
    that would be a good improvement as well. And separating the \"i\" could work.
    \r\n\r\nI'll work with some of this stuff and get back to you all. Thanks for
    the advice, very nice to get feedback like this...\r\n\r\n-Chris"

  body: "\"the c-h connection actually feels like a good solid chunk to me\"\r\n\r\nYes
    it does, but it also creates a hot spot, a dark spot that draws the eye away from
    the \"word.\" You want the viewer to digest the mark without be drawn to 1 particular
    facet of the mark/design. That is the reason that I suggested cutting the serifs...
    minimize.\r\n\r\nWhen working on a word project like this I always think in terms
    of the pen... keep thicks from joining thicks, unless of course it is monoline.\r\n\r\nMichael"
