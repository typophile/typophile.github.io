  body: This is great fun, really quirky. It almost bounces because of your lc_d and
    lc_b. I think the uc_M and uc_W are too wide. Love the uc_K. Is the uc_P too quirky?
    Maybe the uc_S is a bit too wide as well.

  body: I really like this! <BR> <BR>Anyone else thing the &#34;f&#34; might be too
    thin? It doesn&#39;t seem to have the same &#34;oomph&#34; as the rest of the
    face. <BR> <BR>

  body: Eduardo, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t see this post in June... I really
    like this! &#34;Serious fun&#34;, indeed... My one comment is about the tails
    of Q and Y... They seem to need some more separation from the rest of the letter.
    <BR> <BR>By the way, I like the way you show the changes you made in the second
    PDF.
