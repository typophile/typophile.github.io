body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nAs many of you may know, I've been playing drums in British/Belgian
  pop/rock band Troubleman for over 10 years. If you want to know what we do, where
  we've been, and sample our music please visit our <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/troublemantheband\">MySpace</a>
  or <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Troubleman/8599842637\">Facebook</a>
  page. In the increasingly difficult music business the quality of your music isn't
  sufficient enough for a breakthrough and a band needs all the help it can get.\r\n\r\nNow
  that our second album is out we might have a shot at something more serious. Bel-RTL
  has a new concept for Sunday nights between 9PM and midnight. Three bands are featured
  on the Bel RTL website and during the broadcast. Every Sunday the band that garnered
  the most votes will get airplay and an interview on the premier radio of the French
  community in Belgium. Troubleman was selected for the first broadcast with \"Radio\",
  so vote for us! It's simple -- just click the link below and select \"Troubleman\"
  in the list.\r\nhttp://www.belrtl.be/allaccessbelge\r\n\r\nVoting ends on Tuesday
  midnight, so there's a little over 24 hours left. Thank all of you who decide to
  help us. ;^)"

  body: Yeah, I wouldn't ask otherwise. They rebooted the voting because they suspected
    foul play. When it originally started a week ago the middle guy received a staggering
    800+ votes within a few minutes, bringing him to 90% of the votes. I don't know
    if you can devise a program that does that automatically (vote - erase cookies
    - vote - erase cookies and so on), but it was sufficient for the organisation
    to let us compete again. I think now at least we stand a fair chance. :^)

    mean You'd have less time on type forums & blogs?\r\n\r\nI can see that Type ID:ing
    at Typophile and being a rock deity pretty much are equal in sex appeal, but I
    get it if selling mega multi platinum would pay better.\r\n\r\nOff to vote then.
    Thanks for all the memories. "

    are your musical views, left of center, middle of the road or right on?\r\n3.
    who were your musical heroes growing up, if you ever did?\r\n4. why do drummers
    always seem to die first?\r\n5. can a song be popular and not populist?\r\n6.
    is there such thing as non-commercial music?\r\n7. if the three top music companies
    went down, would you give them $700,000,000,000.07, or just the $.07?\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "1. The only time I wore lipstick on stage is when the guitar player wrote
    \"PORN STAR\" on my bare chest for the gig at the Rock Garden in London a couple
    of years ago. My chest is nowhere as impressive as John Downer's nor Dolly Parton's.\r\n2.
    My personal music views are left of center, yet when I play it's right on.\r\n3.
    I'm still waiting to get out of puberty, but Prince made a tremendous impression
    on me and greatly influenced my drumming style. Little did I know back then he
    mainly used a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_machine#Digital_sampling\">drum
    machine</a>.\r\n4. Because they live fast (and consequently die young). And they're
    crazy. A can't miss combination.\r\n5. Yes.\r\n6. That's elitist crap. I don't
    know anyone who makes music and doesn't want the rest of the world to hear it.\r\n7.
    I'd dance on their collective graves as they ripped off countless artists in the
    past and are directly responsible for the current malaise in the music business."

    of the votes. We're trying our very best to hang on in there. Thank you so much
    all of you. The exposure is no guarantee, but let's hope it gives us a push in
    the right direction.
