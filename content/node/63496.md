body: "I have n\xF3 idea what font this is.\r\nI dunno the official term, but this
  is a web-font like Verdana, Trebuchet. I mean at the website http://www.tefalgezondenlekker.nl
  I can select seperate characters (the red headings), it's not a gif or jpeg. I could
  not find a fontname in the page source.\r\nThanks upfront!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/webfont_3827.jpg]"
