  for Seattle City Council\" logo a few weeks ago. \r\n\r\nI just posted the website
  yesterday. It shows the final version the candidate and his campaign manager approved.
  I think the white and shades of green look good set into the earthy color scheme.\r\n<a
  href=\"http://dorsolplants.com\"><strong>Dorsol Plants website</strong></a>\r\n\r\nHere
  is the website of one of young Mr. Plants' opponents:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bloomforcouncil.com/meet_david_bloom.html\"><strong>other
  candidate</strong></a>\r\n\r\nMr Bloom has a long resume, but the graphic design
  kind of sucks, don't you think? He doesn't even have a proper logo, just the title
  set in Gill Sans. The welcome page isn't pleasant to look at...but maybe that's
  just me. \r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\nDina\r\n\r\n\r\n"
