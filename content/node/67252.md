body: "Hi\r\n\r\nI've lost the font used originally in this logo. It was done on an
  old system. \r\n\r\nCan anyone shed some light on it? I can tell you the following:\r\n\r\n1)
  It's not a standard Windows XP font\r\n2) It was a free font downloaded from the
  Web\r\n\r\nFrom doing research trying to track it down, I can rule out the following
  (may/may not match the above criteria):\r\n - 20 th Century Condensed Extra Bold\r\n
  - Futura Condensed Extra Black\r\n - Twentieth Century MT Ultrabold Condensed\r\n
  - Interstate BlackCondensed\r\n - 20 th Century Condensed Ultra Bold\r\n\r\nWould
  be so grateful if you can help.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-2_5720.jpg]"

    Century MT Extra Bold</a>. If you downloaded it free from the web it means it
    was offered illegally. '

    so you may have had it on your machine without noticing that you bought a license.\r\n\r\nAndreas"
