  body: While the font referenced above appears to fit the "Abdulhamid" text it does
    not contain Arabic characters -- Russian yes.  There is likely a second font associated
    with your sample.

  body: "{Edited following Alexandru's gracious removal of reference to plagiarized
    font.}\r\n\r\nI'm sorry to say that this raises a large red flag - I have to suspect
    a case of outline theft (possibly involving Rotis).\r\n\r\nIn fact, please do
    not recommend or use any fonts by XXXXX since it's become pretty clear that he
    doesn't respect fellow designers, based on his comments on a recent Typophile
    thread.\r\n\r\nAlexandru, if you could please remove your recommendation I believe
    that would be good for typeface design in general and Typophile in particular.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    for the Arabic font, it sort of reminds me of the Latin typeface FF Profile.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: 'From what I can see the FF Profile has squared strokes, whereas the OP has
    angled pointed tails.  The problem is the other font which is a fixed width design
    with "flaired" or "wedge" ends. '

    or indifferent.
