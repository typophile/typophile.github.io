  body: "When I first started buying fonts in the early 90's, Papyrus was one of my
    early purchases. I admit I still like it, except that seeing it so often has spoiled
    it for me. I hope Chris Costello made a bundle from it. I think people like it
    because it has a graceful elegance, and the stroke irregularities say 'natural',
    the same way that the damn square fonts mean 'Tech' to people. It's become a clich\xE9,
    but things do that when they epitomize something in people's minds. It's not the
    font's fault, is it?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Associations are all in the beholder's mind and not the font's fault. Papyrus,
    signwritten large in fluoro orange on a dark olive green background for me, will
    always symbolise my first-ever visit to the lucky country... I've never used it
    since, and so the contempt hasn't set in.
