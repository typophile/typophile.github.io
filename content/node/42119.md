    it out with the boss if we\u2019re a couple of entries short. ;^)\r\n\r\nThere's
    some absolutely terrific stuff being submitted, both in the image and text categories,
    and I'm gutted by the fact that for now no new images can be posted. I'm adding
    all the submissions even if the related image can't be added yet. This way you
    can keep track if your entry was received: if you see your name and the typeface
    name in the list you're good.\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who's already submitted
    and keep 'em coming."

    count in the contest I'll post it here.\r\n\r\nIn the same strain of Roland will
    I tell\r\nThings unattempted yet in prose or rhyme\r\nOn whom strange serif and
    kern fury fell\r\nA font esteemed so wise in former time;\r\nIf design, who to
    like cruel pass has well.\r\nNight brought my interrupted design\r\nBy hourly
    wastes, my senses concede my skill\r\nBut strength my daring promise to fulfill.\r\n\r\nDifferent
    weights it drives, and evermore\r\nStrong design, conceptual, historic cries\r\nAnd
    it's presence up-leading on the shore\r\nAnd Fakir her lovely visage spies\r\nEpic
    story, epic battles, epic wins\r\nArriving quickly to the designers eyes\r\n(Through
    many days no news of her had shown)\r\nThe beautiful Fakir is known.\r\n\r\nAnd
    be she cheap with all except the weights.\r\n\"Use Papyrus\" The client did bestow\r\nAh!
    False and cruel Fortune! foul despite!\r\nWhile others triumph, I am drown'd in
    woe\r\nAnd can it be that I treasure such slight\r\nAnd can I then my very Fakir
    forego?\r\nNo! Let me die; it this a sign?\r\nA long life; if I must cease to
    design.\r\n"
