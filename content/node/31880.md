  body: "Come on guys, there has got to be a font that I could mangle that has the
    same A and S.\r\n\r\nChallenging, no?\r\n\r\nOn second look, the two Hs are definately
    different making me wonder whether or not this is hand drawn. What is the dead
    give away for \"hand drawn ness\" ?"

    boundary shape. I wouldn't be so quick to say hand-drawn, even though the letters
    are distorted differently.\r\n\r\nOf course, this would have more credibility
    if I could name the font.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I think I agree with your contention that the S is from a different font.
    It looks similar to the S from <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/citadel/\">Citadel</a>.
    The other letters are similar to <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/renault/\">Renault</a>,
    with the top A serif removed. It seems the designer was looking for a flat-topped
    S to line up with his building outline.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying these ARE the fonts
    used, but they might be close enough to re-create it, if that's what you want
    to do. Of course, finding a font that matched, like just using Citadel, would
    probably be a better look.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
