body: I am a designer, and over the past 2 years I have created several typefaces
  (Latin 9). I have done this at my salaried job. I also do freelance design and have
  recently been asked to give someone a quote for a Latin 9 San-serif character set.
  Does anyone out there have a general pricing guide they use for freelance type design?
