body: 'I have some curiosity to learn about the differences between the registered
  and the copyright glyphs. Robert Bringhurst on his book &#34;The Elements of Typography
  Style&#34; said that the registered symbol is a superscript character and the copyright
  symbol align on the baseline. My question is what is the reason that some fonts
  have this two glyphs so identical each other on size and typography alignment &#40;align
  on the baseline&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Ricardo '

  body: A registered trademark symbol &#34;circle r&#34; is usually meant to add information
    to a marque or a word. It is superscripted just like the standard trademark &#34;TM&#34;
    symbol as its a sort of note, in much the same was as an asterisk is used <BR>
    <BR>The Copyright glyph, however, is used as an abbreviation of the word to be
    used inline as a word in its own right &#40;usually as part of a copyright notice&#41;,
    rather than as an adjunct to another.  <BR> <BR>However, just as T&amp;Cs are
    coming ever smaller, commercial pressures, usually from the legal department of
    a corporation, have resulted in the circle r becoming increasingly big, to the
    point where it takes on the characteristics of a fully blown character, sitting
    on the baseline.

    registration marks were designed in the two sizes for text and display applications.

  body: 'The old hot type specimen books I have all show both characters the same
    size. These characters were never part of a normal typeface, but part of a set
    of universal characters that could be used with any typeface. If a digital font
    follows the traditional model, the two characters would be the same size, and
    this is generally the case with most digital typefaces.  <BR> <BR>But I think
    many recent type designers &#40;me included&#41; have changed the proportion of
    these characters to take the superscripted '

  body: David, Joffre and Mark thank&#39;s for all the comments. All my first typography
    projects I inclued this two glyphs in the same size and alignment but recently
    I have change the registered glyph to a superscript character &#40;after I read
    &#34;The Elements of Typography Style&#34; &#41;. I put this question because
