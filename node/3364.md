  <BR> <BR>hi all, <BR> <BR>I did the logo for local theatre as a part of complete

  actually I&#39;m unsure what font to choose for it. <BR> <BR>In this example above
  I used Adobe Garamond only as an example. <BR>I want to use serif face &#40;but
  am open for san serif suggestions as well&#41; for several reasons that I

    weight of your mark could be complimented by a sans if it echoed the shape. Dan

  body: Luka, I&#39;m back. Take a look at these sans faces and see if any of them
    compliment your logo better. News Gothic Condensed, Trade Gothic Condensed &#40;its
    squarer than News Gothic&#41;, Formata light Condensed, Optima, Agenda Light Condensed.
    You can find these faces at MyFonts to take a look. If you want something more
    unusual, take a look at Dyna Grotesk D Plain, Faber Eins/Zwei Normal, Pragma ND
    Light.

  body: Luka, I think your mark is pretty well done. I&#39;d be interested to see
    how the top of the logo &#34;g&#34; would look if it were closed, like the speaking
    bubble in your first post. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m having trouble seeing the reason for
    the red box. The &#34;g&#34; is a bit unbalanced inside of it and I don&#39;t
    know if it belongs. What do you think about eliminating the box and increasing
    the size of the &#34;g&#34; stroke? <BR> <BR>Of course, losing the box would make
    it much harder to incorporate the theatre name. Hm. One more thing

    looks like one of the easier ones to read at the smaller size, but it has the
    most contrast. <BR> <BR>I like the curved l&#39;s in agenda, but I&#39;m wondering
    if straight l&#39;s '

  body: once again, thanks all for responses <BR> <BR>@Daniel Madden  <BR>Without
    the red box there is danger of interpretation as &#34;ggavella&#34; &#40;two g&#39;s
    in the row&#41; <BR>so its function is to differentiate the logo from type. <BR>As
    you said it yourself, than it&#39;s much harder to  <BR>incorporate theatre name.
    <BR>There will be lots of printed material which format is much wider than taller
    so there wouldn&#39;t be enough space for logo if type goes beneath it. <BR> <BR>
    <BR>@Brian <BR> <BR>I agree that optima is much better option, but I&#39;m  <BR>biased
    with this font, big part of market for cosmetic products has optima on its label.

- body: Oh, I think Optima works in some ways, but the other examples work better,
    so it&#39;s not my favorite. I think it&#39;s contrast takes it out of the running,
    and it looks to feminine. I&#39;m thinking that if there was a monoweight version
    of John sans, that would be perfect, or just to alter the g from either trade
    or news gothic. <BR>

  body: A few things come to mind that I thought I&#39;d share. <BR> <BR>[1] Because
    of the softness of the ear on your mark, it might be interesting to see a softer
    sans. However, I wouldn&#39;t go with a humanist sans, the modulation of strokes
    would contradict the monolinear-ness of your mark. What about Storm&#39;s DynaGroteskRE?
    <BR> <BR>[2] What if you used the ear from a more interesting typeface? Font Bureau&#39;s
    Amplitude has a trap near it&#39;s ear which could be incorporated for a more
    geometric mark. I think this might also make it appear more &#34;talking balloon&#34;
    like as well.  <BR> <BR>[3] There doesn&#39;t seem to be a rhymne or reason for
    the red box, accept to give weight to your mark. What if you made the stroke of
    the mark heavier and red? <BR> <BR>[4] You showed us how you created the mark,
    and I understand the talking balloon, but I don&#39;t understand the box.  <BR>

    don&#39;t think you need a typeface with the base open. It would unnecessarily
    too literal. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>My 2 cents worth. <BR> <BR><img

    target="_blank">DynaGrotesk RE</a>.  <BR> <BR>Before I go shoving my foot down
    my throat again, I&#39;ll ask...Is the gray with the red set in stone? If it is,
    what if the cities &#40;I&#39;m guessing those are cities names&#41; were in red?
    If the gray isn&#39;t in stone, what if you used black? Or a darker gray? I&#39;m
    just concerned about contrast between the cities and the name. <BR> <BR>Is the
    logo too large? Also, is the shape of the red box in stone? Just curious. I&#39;m
    not trying to be a total pest.

  body: Personally, I&#39;m more intrgigued by the presentation in the first post.  Not
    so much the type, though it isn&#39;t bad, but the way you showcased the development
    of the symbol. <BR> <BR>If I were you, I would consider using all three elements
    in their logo.  Without them, I just don&#39;t make the connection of the talk
    bubble.  Also, illustrating the progression might imply the nature of what the
    theater company does -- presents stories. <BR> <BR>Just my 2 cents.
