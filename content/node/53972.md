  \r\n\r\nTo expand my interest of type I have decided to create a Letterform a day.\r\n\r\nPlease
  critique ideas. These are a few starting points, tomorrow I intend to start, with,
  believe it or not...'A'!\r\n\r\nEvery day I will update the , hopefully spanning
  across many typographic genres, in an aim to finally settle on a style I am pleased
  with, and develop a full series of letterforms (typeface) from that.\r\n\r\nI am
  interest in the Gestalt theory, and what we create in the blank space with our mind.\r\n\r\nI
  am interested on everyones view of typography and welcome comments each day.\r\n\r\nThank
  You.\r\n\r\nB&A."
