    for about 8 hours. It's just Germany from the south to the north but it was the
    right decision.\r\nWhen you want to move foreward and this internship will help
    you doing this step, don't even think about it.\r\nIt's there just this online
    application or did you phone with someone from this company and this internship
    is fixed."

  body: "I was an intern at a large company for several months when I was a design
    student and it was a great experience.\r\n\r\nBut one caution -- A true internship
    is meant to help educate and prepare the intern for their future career. But sometimes
    unethical (or unthinking) companies will just view interns as cheap labor, and
    the interns will spend their days doing menial jobs that have little educational
    value. \r\n\r\nNothing wrong with doing those kinds of tasks to some extent, but
    your job should also include substantial educational aspects. So do some research
    and make sure the internship will have long-term value."
