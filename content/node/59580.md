  I can. \r\n\r\nI recently became interested in the typeface used in the first edition
  of Moby Dick (which, since it was the British version, was just called \"The Whale\").
  I found some scans online of the [[http://historical.ha.com/common/view_item.php?Sale_No=683&Lot_No=57563&type=&ic=|title
  pages here]] (nice, large images). Also see the smaller image I've posted. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/leviathan_4242.jpg]\r\n\r\nThis
  typeface is remarkably like Century. I'd ID it as such, except Century was designed
  around 1900 by Moris Fuller Benton at ATF, and this face was in use fifty years
  earlier. \r\n\r\nAny sage wisdom on this would be much appreciated. Thanks!"

    the terminal of the \"a\" for instance.\r\nThen again, I wouldn't know how many
    fonts from that approximate historical / geographical background have been revived\u2026

  body: "Even though DeVinne was designed in 1890, according to my notes, it almost
    seems a better match, because the 't' is closer to the posted sample than the
    't' in Scotch Roman.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega[img:sites/default/files/old-images/devinne_full_4064.gif]"
