  guys for some help. I'm currently finishing my Master's thesis and looking for a
  nice typeface to go with it. I'm looking for a serif, but I don't want it to be
  too classical. What would you recommend for the body text? And for the headers?\r\n\r\nHope
  you guys can help me out. Thanks in advance!"

      of tables. The thesis is approximately 35 pages long. \r\nI find it important
      the font is easy to read and fits in an academic paper."

    its rather modest x-height and its narrow, calligraphic italics. Athelas is probably
    a little better. But if you want something from Type Together, I\u2019d rather
    try a more robust typeface, such as <a href=\"http://www.type-together.com/Adelle\">Adelle</a>,
    <a href=\"http://www.type-together.com/Karmina\">Karmina</a> or <a href=\"http://rosettatype.com/Skolar\">Skolar</a>
    (now distributed via Rosetta). And speaking of Rosetta: <a href=\"http://www.rosettatype.com/Huronia\">Huronia</a>
    is very nice. What\u2019s also nice is that both <a href=\"http://type-together.com/index.php?action=carro/edit_sale\">Type

    for the whole font, mind you, for one glyph (\u2248 letter).</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI
    <cite>think</cite> I know what you mean, but as a whole, this could be misleading.
    Better, probably, to just give a time for, say, populating both *Controls and
    Basic Latin* plus *Controls and Basic Latin-1 Supplement* (basically, and older
    PostScript font, having about 190 glyphs out of the 256 available spots). That
    should not take 1,710 hours (about a full year, using a conventional 8 hour day
    minus vacations & holidays), even for four weights -- though it could be close,
    I suppose (though all four weights is not \"a single glyph\"). Finally, getting
    paid the full amount for each glyph's cost may be appropriate for commissioned
    work where there will be only one sale, harder to argue when a font is released
    as available for multiple users and multiple purchasers.\r\n\r\nIf your general
    point is that the price of $30-$40 each is rather too low even for retail fonts,
    I'd go alone with that. One technology back from PostScript (say, Linotron 202),
    the list price for a single font (e.g., just the roman) was about $150. Less for
    smaller players like Compugraphic, but that would be the price of a Linotype font
    for one of their digital machines like the 202 or 505. While it did take a little
    longer, production of those fonts didn't involve *substantially* more work than
    today's digital fonts.\r\n\r\nBut that number too can be illusory -- another marketing
    trick. If you bought a 20-font pack from Linotype & drew on it as you needed new
    fonts, you wound up paying about $50 a single font -- in 1980 dollars, of course,
    when a brand-new Chevy Malibu was about $6,000. So, closer to $200 a single font
    in 2015 dollars.\r\n\r\nIt's good to let people know the amount of work & attendant
    costs that go into font production, no need to use a number that could lead to
    confusion."

    to my surprised I fully realized its relevance a few years ago. The first outline

    of yesteryear (sadly I forget who) citing the same figure! So I think there's
    something there...\r\n\r\nThat said, it's also become pretty clear to me that

  body: "See\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/68060\r\n\r\nOn John Hudsons's pricing,
    character design averages $40/glyph, hinting $30/glyph, and $480/day for writing
    the features code. I've written a lot of feature code -- It would be an odd font
    for it to take me more than a few hours, except for kerning. It takes me around
    \ 12 to 18 hours to kern a roman font, and 6 to 12 hours for an italic, but that's
    for a working roman for academic publishing, which for me includes a lot more
    than 192 characters -- arbitrary fractions, true-cut superiors, small caps. etc..
    For Latin Basic plus Latin 1 only, 8 hours for both positioning (includes kerning)
    and substitution features.\r\n\r\nSo, on John's pricing, $70 per glyph for design
    and hinting, on simple features (one day) add  another $2.50/glyph, but realistically,
    I'd add $7.50/glyph. For very complicated fonts, the features code will take longer,
    but then, there will be more characters...\r\n\r\nThat yields between $72.50 and
    $77.50 per glyph. If each one takes you 8 hours, you may need another line of
    work -- your return would around $9.00/hr. The truth is, it doesn't take anyone
    8 hours for each glyph. An \"aacute,\" for example, doesn't take 8 hours over
    and above an \"a\" plus a \"combining acute.\" Nor an \"agrave,\" \"acircumflex,\"
    etc. a comma and a period give the pieces for a colon & semicolon, though spacing
    may be a it different. But not 16 hours worth.\r\n\r\nThat was my whole point,
    someone saying \"it takes 8 hours a glyph\" is misleading, and in the end will
    lead to people not trusting what's generally calimed.\r\n\r\nBTW, if you read
    the referenced post, those charges are for a commissioned work -- one sale only.
    Two things: (1) it does not take 8 hours per glyph, and (2) most fonts, like Huronia,
    are <strong>not<strong> commissioned work, but will be purchased by multiple buyers.\r\n\r\n192
    x $77.50 = $61,380. Seems a it high. If you have to sell the font for $35, you'll
    need to sell 1,753 copies to make the same amount of money. And while there are
    added costs for a full family, there are also econ0mies.\r\n\r\n(By the way, for
    the Original Poster, John Hudson is Ross Mills business partner at Tiro Typeworks.
    Ross Mills did much of the work on Huronia, with Rosetta handling some further
    details. Ross will never get rich off Huronia, if you look at the pro version,
    you'll see it is a labor of love.)\r\n\r\nIn the end, while the publisher can
    always set the price as they choose, there is another party in all this, the user.
    If they feel a font overpriced, as long as there are alternatives, they won't
    buy. How hard the designer did or did not have to work isn't particularly relevant
    to them.\r\n\r\n"

    their black bodies. I for one don't produce fonts with very large character sets,

    when you divide the ~800 hours I spent making Maral with the number of character
    it has (~100), guess what you get. And there are characters in Mana that did take
    me way over 8 hours each.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>you may need another line of work</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<em>NOW</em>

  body: "Last time I looked, this was a users forum. \"Typhophile > Typography/Composition.\"
    In such a forum, you might consider the needs of people who use type, rather than
    simply ignoring them.\r\n\r\nThe impression you give to those of us who <string>use</strong>
    type is that ideally, type is created by artists. Like painting or sculpture,
    there are people out there who commission the artist to make fonts (for reasons
    unknown). For the masses to see type, I suppose the sale of fonts has to be to
    museums, like other works of art. The costs of all this are to recovered by the
    museum charging admission, where interested people pay to look at the fonts.\r\n\r\nI
    don't know much about people who create type this way. Whatever. But if that is
    your model, there is little point in \"instructing\" all of us about all the time
    and skill involved, since we aren't the audience you're aiming at anyway. \r\n\r\nThere
    is a marketplace out there. If you can get $1,000 a font (I own Trinit\xE9, remember?
    A customer wanted it, and paid for it. But just one, no one else uses it.) do
    it. If, on the other hand, the marketplace refuses to pay the amounts you want
    to charge, you might want to reexamine your assumptions. If it takes you 1,750
    hours to create 190 characters, but no one will pay $87,500 ($50/hr) for the font,
    what now? Most people who sell fonts would say, well, that time spent factor has
    to come down. By all means,  make your own choices. But stop whining about it
    and asserting it is the norm. Pointless, in any case. You won't get much sympathy
    from the people who use type to create products. \r\n\r\nI use type. I get $3.75
    a page for the composition of scholarly monographs (not straight text), and have
    to compete with Asia, where for $3.00 a page, from a reputable company doing acceptable
    work, you can get (1) the printer-ready pdf, (2) an archival pdf, (3) a \"Universal\"
    pdf (contents page & maybe hooked up for on-line viewing), (4) a usable ePUB file
    to send to Amazon & Apple, and and (5) a TEI-encoded XML file.  It would be silly
    for me to compete by claiming that all Asians are stupid and do shoddy work. Stupid,
    and racist. \r\n\r\nAnd yes, occasionally someone on Typophile makes the claim
    that typesetting books yields $20 a page. Your statements seem about parallel
    to that situation. So we have to ask, \"On exactly what data do you base your
    claims?\"\r\n\r\nAnd yes,  it is a kind of a lie to imply that the way you would
    like to work, which is not supported by a marketplace, is how everyone should
    work.  "
