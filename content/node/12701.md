body: "Thanks for the serif advice for my alumni magazine redesign. I think I'll look
  into Miller or Sabon Next for the main text serif font.\r\n\r\nNow I'm persuading
  them to pick a new sans serif. Must work as a headline, subhead and sidebar text.
  Large family a plus. Any favorite sans? Any that would work well with Sabon/Miller?
  \r\n\r\nI'm drawn to Stalemate or Tschichold at the moment."

  body: "I like very much the way ITC Bailey works in magazine text, but it only has
    the normal and the bold weight.\r\n\r\nI saw Tschichold and I liked it, a very
    Garamondesque Gill Sans.\r\n\r\nChianti BT is a humanist sans serif which works
    nicely in body text, has old style figures, caps, a nice set of italic swashes
    and alternates and three weights. \r\n\r\nH\xE9ctor"
