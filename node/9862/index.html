  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I&#39;ve just started research, I have about 7 months. I&#39;d like to design a face, but am lacking in direction. Have no preconcieved notions on to what, sans, roman, script, modular etc... i would do. Need advice on how to go about establishing a NEED and FUNCTION. The design will be stronger, and I will feel better about it, as it was purposeful. Want to avoid post-rationalization.  To any experienced type designer, I implore your assistance... <BR> <BR>Thank you</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Define &#34;experienced&#34;...  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>Starting in a vacuum is indeed hard. But that doesn&#39;t mean your goal has to be very niche. You could simply decide to make the best general-purpose sans you can for example - something that many people could use to set many kinds of &#40;not-too-long&#41; text. On the other hand, the narrower the goal the easier it is to be original &#40;while always maintaining a functional framework&#41;. Or you could start from a shape you like &#40;like a certain kind of arch or something&#41; and develop a whole font from it; although for me personally that&#39;s a superficial approach &#40;I know because I&#39;ve done it too&#41;, it&#39;s still possible to: arrive at a usable display face, if you can learn to be not too literal, and break your &#34;rules&#34; as needed; and gain a lot of practice in the mechanics. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">By no means am I experienced in anything, but I was recently in a similar situation for my senior thesis. I did a lot of research and reading and eventually ended up with an interesting, though very ridiculous &#40;and somewhat embarrassing&#41; idea for my project.  <BR> <BR>A good starting point would be to decide what type of project you would enjoy doing. Elliott Earls has a good essay in Emigre #65 that helped me with this. He categorizes modern type design as falling into 3 categories, &#34;historical revival, vernacular interpretation, or exclusively formal extrapolation.&#34; From that point it was pretty easy to come up with a clear brief and strategy.  <BR> <BR>I hope that helped. Good luck.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I recommend defining a brief of some kind, which will constrain your thinking about a project and present a direction. Typically, type design briefs are along the lines of &#39;a signage typeface&#39; or &#39;a text type for newspapers&#39; etc., and require both stylistic and technical response. <BR> <BR>Since this is a school project, I think you could set yourself something a little bit more interesting than these typical commercial briefs. Why not consider designing a typeface for a particular text, e.g. some book that interests you? This would force you to consider the material requirements of an edition &#40;at what size should it be set, do you need variants e.g. for subheads or footnotes, how do you envision it being printed&#41; and the stylistic suggestions of the text. Ideally in such a project, the stylistic considerations should avoid the obvious &#40;it&#39;s a Jane Austen novel so the typeface is a revival of an early 19th century face&#41; and reflect your response to the text, which might be affectionate if it is a book that you really like, but could also be ironic or subversive.</div>
