body: "Hello Typophiles,\r\n\r\nA few colleagues and I were discussing book design
  and the interaction of text with images/figures that flow within the surrounding
  text. Specifically, we were debating whether or not the paragraph that follows an
  image (and its caption, if present) should be indented.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nAesthetically,
  I prefer that the paragraph after the image <em>not</em> be indented, as do my colleagues.
  However, looking at it from the point of view of the logical progression of the
  text itself, I argued that perhaps it makes more sense that the paragraph be indented;
  this way, if all the imagery was removed, the text would still read\u2014and be
  styled\u2014in a logical manner.\r\n\r\nBelow I've included a quick mock-up of what
  I'm describing above (see yellow highlights for the specific spot in question),
  should what I wrote not make any sense.\r\n\r\nAs always, the group's expertise
  is greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nWarmly,\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Indent-vs-NoIndent_4073.jpg]"

  body: "There is a risk that the final line of the previous para will run at almost
    full measure, causing confusion whether the text below the image is part of the
    para or the start of a new one. To be on the safe side, ALWAYS indent new para\u2019s
    after the first one (even though the aesthetics bother me, I have to admit \u2014
    I prefer the look of the design on the left)."

  body: "This question assumes that the first line after an image does, in fact, begin
    a new paragraph structurally. It's totally possible to have an image in the middle
    of a paragraph \u2014 or even a sentence, but that's a whole different type of
    situation that what you're talking about. Often, an image will simply be dropped
    in a layout at the most convenient place, not in a place that logically situates
    it within the flow of text. But even assuming that the images are conceived of
    as flowing in the same stream as the main text, I don't see why you couldn't have
    one in the middle of a paragraph. So the question is, I think, does it have to
    be consistent? I say no.\r\n\r\nI run into this with block quotes. Sometimes they
    end a paragraph and sometimes they don't. So sometimes the paragraph afterwards
    is indented and sometimes it's not. It's an editorial decision, not a typographic
    one. (In this case, you can ask yourself, If the quote was just run in with the
    text like a short quote, would it end the paragraph or not?) The textual logic
    may be more important than visual consistency.\r\n\r\n(And yes, when I'm the author,
    I always try to include quotes within a paragraph so as to avoid the unsightly
    indent \u2026)\r\n\r\nBut unless you're the author, ask your author or editor
    what they think."

  body: I'd indent, both for consistency and also because if a change later caused
    the text to reflow, the paragraph break could shift to a different spot and the
    lack of indent could be a problem.

  body: 'With the indented paragraph style you''re using, a non-indented paragraph
    isn''t just stylistic -- it represents a section break. For example, the first
    paragraph of each chapter would not have an indent because they represent the
    beginning of a new section (even if there are other indicators, such as a title
    or a lowered text box). Mid-chapter section breaks would probably have a paragraph
    space followed by a non-indented paragraph (and sometimes a little bauble in the
    white space). Therefore, you should use the indent. At least that''s how I was
    taught. '

    between the caption and para to seperate them, then the eye automatically is drawn
    to the beginning body line. '

  body: "Thanks for the feedback everybody.\r\n\r\nIt looks like the general consensus
    is to typically leave them indented; <em>tmac</em>, your comments echo my logical
    assumptions, which is reassuring. I've been fairly convinced of this for a while
    now\u2014I'm usually one to follow technical rules over aesthetic options\u2014but
    it came up in conversation the other day and I figured there no better place to
    put the matter to rest than here.\r\n\r\nType on! (That was a bad joke\u2014my
    apologies.)"
