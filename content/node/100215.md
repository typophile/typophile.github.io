body: "Hey there!\r\n\r\nI'm curious what typeface BlackBerry was using in their recent
  launch event. I've attached a picture and am linking to several more.\r\n\r\nI tried
  to google it, but it didn't really help, since most of the results deal with the
  logotype. I also came across a brand identity guideline pdf, but it was from 2007
  and apparently they have changed the typeface they are using since then.\r\n\r\nAny
  help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!\r\n\r\n[[http://rimblogs.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/super-nova-rehearsalfootage2-still002.jpg?w=600&h=338|1]]\r\n[[http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_2411.jpg|2]]\r\n[[http://i1-news.softpedia-static.com/images/extra//MOBILE/Evenimente/BlackBerry_10/4.jpg|3]]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bb10hedimgnolongerrim_3660.jpg]"
