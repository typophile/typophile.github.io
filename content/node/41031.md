body: "Hello all.\r\n\r\nIm currently working on a design for a website at work, and
  would like to incorprate a typeface, DIN Schrift 1451, as editable text. Obviously
  with the constraints of the web in terms of typography and various faces, we only
  have a select few to choose from, that we would say where 'safe' to use on both
  PC and Mac platforms.. we all know them and this isnt one of them!\r\n\r\nAnway,
  I know that Typophile feature a new typeface every so often that is editable...
  for example the current face, Borges Titulo which can be selected and highlighted...
  Our studio web monkey believes that this is dynamic flash media placed within php
  content? Does anyone know if this is true... As this would allow me to progress
  with the design, in terms of what I can and cant do with my type on the site.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance...\r\n\r\n"
