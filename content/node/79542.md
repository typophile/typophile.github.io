    by a new (and better) one some years ago.\r\n\r\nPreferences?\r\nAs a reader of
    books printed in Germany I am quite fond of the Stempel version too, though it
    is not actually the most garamondish one (compared to the original). The next
    in my ranking would be the <cite>Typoart Garamond</cite> by Herbert Thannh\xE4user,
    followed by Monotype and Adobe.\r\n\r\nPerhaps someone out here can shed light
    on the availability of a digital Typoart version \u2013?\r\n\r\nLast and least,
    the ITC sort is a non-starter for me, and has always been. "

  body: "I enjoy reading the more modern interpretation of Garamond, like Sabon, immensely!
    I find the new Adobe font Garamond Premiere Pro needs good printing conditions,
    because of the more historical accurate lower x-height, so personally as non professional,
    I would have no use for it. \r\n\r\nSimilar to my preference for Sabon, I admire
    Garamond (sometimes mixed with other old-style influences) <em>inspired</em> fonts
    like [[http://www.terminaldesign.com/Fonts/#/Rawlinson2|Rawlinson 2.0]], Lyon,
    [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/positype/epic/|Epic]], [[http://www.felicianotypefoundry.com/cms/fonts/merlo|Merlo]],
    etc\u2026 I personally would love to see more of them in use. But I guess book
    design is a conservative business, why implement a new typeface (with print optimization
    process involved as well) if one has a set of typefaces already, which proofed
    to be reliable. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

    Garamond, a version I've learned to love after using it. I still prefer it to
    Slimbach's second (and historically, apparently, more accurate) version, the Premier.
    Most of other digital renditions of metal-era types (Sabon, Simoncini, Monotype

  body: "When it comes to Caslon, while Adobe Caslon is just a bit <em>too</em> inauthentic,
    I think it's a good and readable face, and so I tend to favor versions of Caslon
    which skate close to the line that Adobe Caslon, unfortunately, crossed.\r\n\r\nBut
    Garamond, on the other hand, is so beautiful to modern eyes in its original form
    that I see no justification for a revival not being highly authentic (but still
    with <em>some</em> compromises for modern readers).\r\n\r\nOf the faces illustrated,
    I think the Stempel and the Monotype are the ones I prefer. But that could just
    be from being habituated to ATF Garamond, or Linotype Garamond No. 3."

  body: "<em>\u2026sanded lens effect\u2026</em>\r\n\r\nThe blobbyness which many
    old style revivals exhibit is a parsing of the ink spread that was a strong feature
    of printing in the old style era, on rag paper. Goudy was a pioneer of this look,
    and both Monotype Garamond (in metal) and Tony Stan's ITC Garamond had a lot of
    it.\r\n\r\nIt comes from basing a display cut (or single master) on a small size
    letterpress sample, and resisting the temptation to clean things up. Seneca has
    that effect too.\r\n\r\n<em>\u2026Psychedlic Oldstyle\u2026</em>\r\n\r\nI don't
    think so. Trying to capture the sometime strange proportions, irregularity and
    bounce of old letterpress printing in newer, more precise technology, is a clear-headed
    design strategy, not whimsical. It's an integral part of the look.\r\nThe vast
    majority of revivals, which make everything so neat, are white bread emasculations,
    IMO.\r\nAnd not just my opinion, Goudy, Cooper, Weiss and Koch were similarly
    minded, back in the Historicist era; experimental perhaps, but not on hallucinogens."

  body: "Good points.\r\n\r\nAnother point of discussion is drawing the line between
    a Garamond and a Garalde.  Of course Garamond has become the archetypal Garalde,
    but a typeface is only a \"Garamond revival\" if the type designer was attempting
    to recreate/interpret the work of Claude Garamond.  Anything else that simply
    falls under the style is a Garalde.  Is that oversimplifying it?\r\n\r\nFor example:
    \ Adobe/Stempel/Berthold Garamonds are Garamonds, and by inclusion, Garaldes.
    But ITC Galliard, Plantin, MVB Verdigris, Rongel, Espinosa Nova et al are Garaldes
    but not Garamonds."

    Claude would be proud.  Although, what did you mean about your 'dipped in chocolate'
    comment? Do you think those faces are too sweet, too homogenized to do justice
    to the originals?\r\n\r\n\"Renard belongs to the broad category of Garamonds but
    occupies a unique place among them. The roman descends - unlike some other Garamonds
    - from a clearly traceable historical origin. In other words: it's from a good
    pedigree with decent papers. Next to that it's the only Garamond which can rightfully
    claim to be 'Flemish'. Not only because of its roots, but certainly due to its
    almost Breughelian features. Which is something that's lacking not only in competitive
    revivals, but in any other Garamond.\"  - http://www.teff.nl/fonts/renard/"

    general Garaldes, but intend to add Renard to your set of true Garamonds? \r\n\r\nIf
    so, then I think you\u2019ve just contradicted your own definition.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\u201CRenard
    is an interpretation of a 2-line Double Pica Roman (Gros Canon) cut by the Flemisch
    punchcutter Hendrik van den Keere around 1570.\u201D</blockquote>\r\n\r\nVan den
    Keere may have possessed and cast type from some of Garamond\u2019s matrices during
    his career as a typefounder. And he was undoubtedly influenced by Garamond, as
    were most of his contemporaries. But this Gros Canon was from his own punches.
    \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t think Van den Keere should be considered any truer a \u201CGaramond\u201D
    (as opposed to working in the general \u201CGaralde\u201D style) than Robert Granjon,
    for example. Which would make Renard no more eligible for your list, in my opinion,
    than Galliard and Plantin. \r\n\r\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. They\u2019re all admirable
