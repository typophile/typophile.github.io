body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am looking for sources and suggestions on creating a font that
  demonstrates habits. For my final graphic design project, I have to design a typographical
  bookjacket for \"The Power of Habit.\" Briefly, it is about how habits have the
  power to control and reform the success or failures of businesses, transform societies,
  and change our lives. The reaccuring theme is how habits work with a cue that triggers
  the routine, and finally what we gain from it. (Think of a continuous circle, and
  how habits pick up power by happening over and over again)\r\n\r\nI am trying to
  use a process that can guide my design solution, but am having a difficult time
  with representing habits in my type design. Any place to start, ideas and suggestions
  would be greatly appreciated!! Thank you!"

    \"Vertigo\"? It's about obsession. In the opening credits this idea isn't communicated
    so much in the type but instead in the visuals and music, with rotating circles
    and music motifs that are repeated endlessly. Perhaps it might give you some inspiration.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qtDCZP4WrQ\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/vertigo_5207.jpg]"

    going up. I love it. Elegantly brutal.\r\n\r\nLast time I was in San Francisco
    I visited some of the Vertigo locations. Some no longer exist but Scotty's house
    (Jimmy Stewart) is still there on Lombard and has hardly changed. I've heard that
    some company actually gives tours of Vertigo locations."
