  points is frowned upon, and all of our commercial OT fonts contain no PUA encoding.
  But many of our customers are sign makers, and sign making software is generally
  not OT savvy. The only way for these clients to access stylistic glyphs, is via
  Windows Character Map, and that requires a glyph to have a unicode codepoint. Is
  there any \"best practice\" as to using PUA that will allow this?\r\n\r\nJames"

  body: "I think best practice is to stick to a convention within your foundry, i.e.
    you make yourself a system, and put e.g. swash letters always into the same range,
    etc.\r\n\r\nPUA is exactly that: private use area, so there is no \"industry standard\".
    But it's a good idea to use an internal (private) \"standard\"."

    PUA codepoints.

  body: "There are some organized conventions for use of the PUA, but they are, by
    definition of the PUA, unofficial. But if you are working in the relevant genre,
    such as [[http://www.evertype.com/standards/csur/|constructed/artificial scripts]]
    or [[http://www.mufi.info/|medieval research]] it might be helpful to follow those
    guidelines. This probably isn't much of an issue for the sign making market, but
    there it is.\r\n"

  body: "Exactly.\r\n\r\nE.g. If I'm creating a font for the scholarly/philologist
    with publications of oldmanuscripts in mind, I'd use MUFI recommendations.\r\nThen
    again, you'd do that only on commission, so you'd know what to use.\r\n\r\nAnd
    as Jason pointed it out, this one is of no concern to your clients."
