  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">This might be a tough call, but I'm looking for examples of typefaces (preferably text faces) featuring very slightly slanted italics – ideally, something like the 3–4 degree range. Bonus points for slightly slanted italics that also don't show an excessively cursive flavor. Patria is one face I can think of off the top of my head that does this quite successfully. Any others?

Same with Goudy, which I do think has a bit more slant though.

Thanks also for the link to the Slanted Roman thread Tiffany. I suspect slanted romans might need more slant than I'm looking for – although I wonder if it couldn't work if all the other constituents of "italicness" are in place (like narrowness, lighter color, different serif structure maybe).

*

Looking at Letters of Credit, I just came across JvK's Romanée (page 108). Too calligraphic for my taste, but that's the sort of angle I'm looking for (Tracy quotes it as 4 degrees). It seems that much of its "italicness" (which really is uh, a bit much) is achieved by its narrowness – and am I crazy, or do the vertical proportions differ between its roman and italic? </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ben, that's a strange font! Looks like an upright italic with an… italic italic :-). 
What I'm looking for (sorry if I wasn't very concise) are italics designed to complement an (upright) base cut, which succeed in being differentiated enough from said base cut in spite of their steep angle, and if possible also without resorting to too much calligraphic trickery.

No you were concise, you've just specified something, slight of angle and light on calligraphic style, which in combination are not terribly effective to a purpose, so far. As a companion italic it sounds like not enough contrast to the roman, and it's not sounding particularly interesting as a stand-alone italic to have little or no italic or angle, so no one has made one that I have ever seen.

Similar missing fonts of this kind might include SuperUltraBlack Agates, Egyptian Humanists and Monospaced Connecting Scripts, or maybe not. ;)

And that's exactly why I'm looking for them: I'm curious if/how they can be (have been) made to work. I wonder if other constituents of "italicness" &ndash; such as narrower width, lighter color, gentle structural changes (like the treatment of joins and/or serifs), and possibly even different vertical proportions &ndash; can't pull the italics far enough away from the roman even without a heavy slant, or full-on chiro/calligraphic action. 
And before somebody says "Why not try and see if you can make it work": I will. But I'm sure this has been attempted before, so I'm trying to dig up some examples to learn from. Bad/non-working ones also welcome BTW.

It is possible to mechanically adjust tilt in your layout application; you never know how faux that will look for a particular face till you try it, but I would suspect that taking an italic with a fairly ordinary slant of 7 or 8 degrees and modifying it to 3 or 4 would not distort it noticeably.</div>

Same thing. The concept pretty much arises from Morison, as put forward in "Toward an Ideal Italic." I believe he used the phrase "sloped roman," which is why it tends to get used preferentially. But I don't have a copy of the article to confirm.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The Morrison's idea seems to have been a spectacular flop, in spite of some really great talents trying to execute it: Dwiggens, Van Krimpen.  Even Morrison abandoned it for Times New Roman. 

So before putting work in such a direction, I'd want to have a strong response to the objection, of Griffith to Dwiggins in Kent's link, and by David above, that such efforts have too little contrast to the roman to serve as a satisfactory companion for emphasis. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">You want that strong response from me? OK, here goes:

First off, in my world both the "pure" slanted-roman, and the "true italics" are to be seen as abstract extremes on a continuous axis &ndash; in this case, the axis of minimal to maximal chiro/calligraphic influence in the italics, or maybe the chiro-"delta" between a given roman and italic cut (in terms of an additional chirographic influence on the italics causing structural differences between it and the roman). It's possible that Morison (and I'm speculating here, because as I've said before, I haven't actually read his text) was too extreme on this scale, too dogmatic.

But I wonder, might not a position on the non-chiro end of that axis still be workable if other factors were weighed differently? Simply stated, I'd say you can't (usually/easily) take chiro-ness out of "the italics equation" and not add "italicness" back in some other form without the result becoming, well, less italic! And thus less differentiated. But "italicness" can come about by different variables, and the chiro/calligraphic "tone" is just one of them.* There's slant as well, there's color, there's width/narrowness, there's possibly different vertical proportions; and I'm sure there's more too. So reducing both the slant and the chiro-value would probably mean that one would have to consider making the italics notably narrower, possibly lighter, and maybe smaller. And might that not work?
* I could swear I've read a similar discussion on Typophile before, but my recollection of it is too fuzzy to quote or even find it.

So there's counter-weighing, and then I'd personally argue against the idea of the "pure" slanted-roman too. I think it should be possible to make very subtle differences in tone that don't need to escalate into too "literal" references to chirography. Things like different treatment of serifs and/or joins, or a subtly different flavor of the curves… maybe.

The question really is, what do we need an italic to be, and can that be achieved both without borrowing excessively from chirography, and without an exaggerated slant? I would go out on a limb and say that I think it can very well. I'm not sure it will be pretty, but I'm pretty sure it can work.
(And I'm well aware of the fact that now, I'll be expected to try and prove that. ;-)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ok, I see you've got an idea that something else can substitute for the more written aspects of italic, such as the hook like serifs, and for the slant as a distinguishing feature. I have no idea what you have in mind, but if you have something, sure, go for it with a handful of characters, and see what happens. 

Slant is such an elemental thing, that I'm skeptical that you can substitute for it, but I'll be delighted to be proven wrong. We know that upright scripts, such as the recent beauty from Underware, can work, but removing both indications of motion, and slant and making it a companion to the roman--that will be some trick.

Point in case for the "make it smaller" variable. Also calligraphic, though.

<em>"To assist in establishing a salient typographic hierarchy."</em>
Yeah well that's the very short version. :-)
Just two things: I think notions of "standing out" and "hierarchy" are tricky with respect to italics; they're not as simple/straightforward as bolds: They make their content stand <em>apart</em> rather than stand <em>out</em>; they're more emphatic, but not necessarily louder. So they need to pull away, but who said <em>how</em> they're going to pull away? So yes, I'd question if for their pure functionality, they need a strong* slant, and the chiro ductus.
(* Note that I'm not advocating doing away with the slant altogether &ndash; in this case however I prefer/need it to be slight. So Ben it's not going to be <em>non-</em>sloped, and probably not entirely <em>non-</em>cursive either.)

I will try what I have in mind, and will get back with that. I don't know if it will work, and/or if I can pull it off! But it's going to be a moment because I need some other stuff to be in place first. Just testing the waters for the moment, and seeing what's out there. Thanks all for the input!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Kent, I may well have been muddling up terminology.
The way I understand things, I'd say that "chirographic" is a much broader term generally meaning (in the context of type design) "informed by handwritten forms" or "borrowing from the aesthetic of handwriting". 
"Cursive", in my book, refers more concisely to a historically-informed way of shaping italics influenced by / based on a certain calligraphic style distinct/separate from the roman.

In terms of the "broadness" of the terms, it's probably something like
chirographic > calligraphic > cursive.

Glancing over my long post above, I could probably have used "cursive" in lieu of "chirographic" a couple of times… but the looser term wasn't quite unintentional: It appears to me that some current fonts have a <em>chirographic</em> quality to the italics that is absent (or not as pronounced) in the roman, but doesn't necessarily follow the "classic" <em>cursive</em> model. But I might be wrong – I'm not very calli-savvy.
 
Let me know if I have the terminology mixed up (or this stuff doesn't make sense).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nina, chirographic I think is more or less a 'typophile' word. I think it was invented by John Hudson to refer to the aspects of type that derive from or are influenced by handwriting. He prefers this to "calligraphy", as that means "beautiful writing", and so has a narrower meaning of decorative writing. The formal hands of scribes were more utilitarian, and these had the biggest impact on the development of printer's types. 

Hrant picked up the term, and has used it more or less as a curse word against what he regards as the baleful influence of writing on type. But what exactly he objects to about writing's influence has never been entirely clear to me, so I generally avoid the term.   </div>

Really? "Chirography" is the first entry in my thesaurus under "handwriting". 
(Collins Paperback Thesaurus, 2nd ed 1990)

Ben, I agree in hoping Hrant will correct us if we got him wrong, but I understood his stance pretty much the same way you did – that *type* (which is not written) should strive to be optimal for *reading* – which necessitates questioning if the shapes that used to be optimal for *writing*, and the aesthetic that stems from writing (comfortable and familiar as it is), is really relevant in type. And I think there was something about chirography being directly opposed to good notan, but I'll admit I don't get that part.
I see his point on the necessary emancipation of type design from written forms. Actually, if one considers that books have been printed not written for more than half a millennium!, I find it rather strange that this demand would still seem so exotic to many. 
And this is a true Typophile-grade topic deviation. :-)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I will use the term "Italics" as used by editors to describe the typographic form things like book titles should be set in. Italics have a different need than bold although both are attempts to separate some parts of text from the normal roman book face. Bold text set inline with the book face stands out indeed with weight being the primary driving force for contrast. Italics have a subtler use. They are not meant to leap out at you and make a jump in color like bolds do, they just make enough of a distinction for a person to see them as "different than roman" but not be emphasized above roman. You might call this a non-hierarchal difference or separation without dominance. 
By removing weight change as an option, slant is one of the few remaining players that cuts across all type families. There are other things possible such as the degree of cursive form historically used. The earliest use of italic type mixed inline with upright roman texts were not from the same type family and a pairing was made based on how closely the x-heights matched when set as neighbors. Shortly after that, foundries took the opportunity to design a so-called matching italics to be sold as a companion to the upright. We can debate at this point, hundreds of years after the fact, how closely matched the early italics really were. Today, italics are IMO better matched as family than the older ones were. We have trained ourselves to accept the variance over the past centuries. Whatever we come up with as a substitute for the current use of slant with a strong cursive influence and use of entrance and exit strokes, we will also require several years before the reading public begins to "get it".
I would be the last person on earth to say, "don't even try it" and I welcome the opportunity to see your attempts as you proceed. I would only say do not throw out the tools people are accustomed to--or at least do not curse them as evil.  It is a good thing to boldly go about and create an alternative to current italics as long as you do not then make it a crusade to rid the world of other useful tools.

If you build it, they will come.

Ben in the form you put it, "the chirographic forms inherent in writing should not be assumed to be optimal for readability," I would agree, and think few would disagree. From Jenson on, type designers have modified joins, weights, and sizes for greater readability.

But Hrant's position has been far stronger than that. If I have understood him, he thinks that written forms are inherently less readable, because of following the stroke or "moving front" of a pen. When they show a moving front, where the two extremes of the stroke are linked as in a pen, that prevents a proper "notan" or balancing of black and white. And this messed-up notan of necessity makes the type less readable. 

That more extreme view, which implies that type having more influence of the pen is inherently less readable, is what I don't buy. In my view, some features of pen writing help, and some hurt. Containing noticeable pen-like features, such as in Jos Buivenga's new Calluna, doesn't necessarily hurt readability.

		<div class="commentbody">Chris, no crusade in sight on this end, just a desire to see what italics are and what they do, and if they need to be what they usually are in order to do that job. 

Like you say, italics were usually separate types and only later were culturally "adopted" to be a subordinate "style" to complement a given upright font. And my view is, just because it was culturally "learned" to do it this way doesn't necessarily make it the Only True Way. 
Sometimes today secondary fonts are used inline for a different way of adding gentle emphasis or denoting other layers of meaning, for example the sans variant of the text face or maybe a different typeface altogether &ndash; much like the old guys used cursive fonts as secondary "italic" ones. It's a great effect if done well, and shows IMO that the point is not that such an emphasis-mark needs to be cursive and/or slanted, but that it simply needs to be <em>different enough while still belonging</em> to the regular cut.
Beyond that, it's a question of flavor: Setting a word in a matching sans within a body of serif is a <em>differently</em> "flavored" emphasis than using cursive italics &ndash; and that's where it gets really interesting: It means that if we only accept the cursive-italic form of "italic" emphasis, we accept that it automatically comes with a certain flavor, i.e. a specifically chirographic one; and I don't see how that is necessary, or even needs to make sense in many cases. Think about what you'd usually use more cursive/calligraphic fonts for: wedding invitations? Now why exactly would I want a book title highlighted in running text to look more festive, or more personal, than the running text &ndash; more hand-written? I only want it to stand apart!

<em>"I have a tough time seeing your headlong leap into “necessary emancipation”."</em>
Short version (sorry, lots of work ahead): By "emancipation" I didn't mean to say that I'd want type design to break from centuries of handwriting tradition and history just for the sake of it, and crusade for that, and fight the pen, armed to the teeth, burning calligraphic type designers at the stake. My point is (and it *is* a rather benign one, much like William says) that type needs to stop being dependent on the pen and holding its hand, but continue – and a bit more boldly, perhaps – to search for its own, functional aesthetics from within – and ideally based on functionality, rather than tradition. Which isn't limited to italics, but also means asking questions like the one above.

		<div class="commentbody">Nina, I wasn't criticizing your use of the two terms interchangeably above. I don't think either have clear, universally accepted definitions, so it's not a question of right or wrong, or even "muddling" the terms. I was just trying to understand how you are intending to use them. I admit to still not being quite clear.

I think you've outlined the parameters of distinction (at least, within the context of what we commonly understand to be "italic") -- slope/slant, width, weight, relative vertical proportions, and form structure. You've expressed an interest in minimizing the first: the angle from the vertical. 

Width and weight are typically fine-tuned when developing an "emphatic companion" to the roman -- typically slightly narrower and slightly lighter. Sometimes relative vertical proportions are adjusted when the angle is great.

Turning attention to form structure, and the reason for my question about terms, I'm trying to understand which components constitute "chirographic" and/or "cursive" in your assessment.

Taking sloped roman as a point of reference, which changes to the structure would make it necessarily "cursive"? Take the lowercase <em>n</em> for instance. If you remove the left serif of the right stem, have you made it cursive, since this one-sided structure typically arises from the motion of writing? What about if you remove both of the serifs on the right stem, now is it "cursive"? Does it matter whether the transition is soft & round or hard & angular? What about how high or low the join from arch to stem is; since a lower join typically arises from a single motion of the hand, does that play a defining role in "cursive"?

When you object to (or question) "cursive/chirographic," what are you directing your attention at?</div>

Thanks for this, Kent. I will admit I'm not quite getting the difference you see between the definitions of the term as used by John and Hrant; they sound very similar to me. Or do you mean that John essentially introduced the term to structurally/aesthetically describe letterforms that are actually written by hand, whereas Hrant transposes it to typographic letterforms that borrow, structurally/stylistically, from handwriting?

<em>"Hrant used “chirography” in a different discussion on the same list, and essentially as a slightly broader substitute for “calligraphy,” meaning an approach to letter formation that relies upon the logic of the hand."</em>
For the record, that's exactly the way I understood the term, and/or intended to use it. It seems like a very useful term to have, too.

Your question about what exactly constitutes chirographic-ness (I know that's not a word :-) ) in italics is very interesting. I'll have to think about that for a moment (and finish a couple of other things on my desk). Will be back.

		<div class="commentbody">Kent, thanks for the link, my above summary on the term "chirographic" was my mangled memory of your post. 

Nina, I am uneasy about the philosophy I hear--maybe wrongly--in your phrase "ideally based on functionality, rather than tradition."

To me this sounds like the radicalism of post WWI "functionalists" in architecture, who were opposed to ornament on the supposed grounds of improving function.

First of all aesthetics is functional, because human beings want to live with beauty, if we have a choice. 

Second, radicalism in type is misguided. I am not politically a conservative, at least the way Americans use that word, but I do agree with Stanley Morrison that type has an element that is inherently conservative: we are tied to letter forms that we inherit from the past, because if we go too far in altering the traditional forms people can't read them. 

Third, when talking about functionally and readability in italics you are facing a tricky situation. Probably all noticeably slanted letters are less readable, and certainly slanted letters in the midst of vertical ones slow you down. But they are *meant* to slow you down, and draw attention to the word or phrase. That is their function. So here you have slightly less readability as more functional for communication!

I absolutely don't want to discourage your experiments, but I think that the history of radical functionalism in architecture shows that while it inspired a lot of interesting work, it is too narrow and restrictive as a philosophy.

So I am all for chirographic italics, and non-chirographic ones. Let a hundred flowers bloom.

The three things being opposed to functionalism here - tradition, ornament, and beauty - are all quite different. I don't think the slippage from one to the others is warranted.

Wouldn't that be a functionalist's foremost concern?

And if there's a problem with radical functionalism in architecture, maybe it's its radicalism and not its functionalism. (Wouldn't radical traditionalism also tend to be "too narrow and restrictive as a philosophy"?)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">>necessary emancipation of type design from written forms

I don't remember reading that...and I'm not sure whether you (or Hrant) are saying type design *needs to* move away from written forms or simply that it doesn't need to be limited by them. 

I can visualise the chiro- end of the spectrum more clearly than the fully 'notan' end...the chiro- end would surely have to involve traditional stress, some cursivity, stems with edges linked in a way consistent with hand movement. Does that mean the notan end would need to a) ignore these restrictions and do simply whatever makes readability best b) invert all these requirements resulting in independent countershapes, un-linked stem edges, reversed stress, no cursivity??? I wonder if both a) and b) could result in beautiful, readable designs.

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">Craig, you're right I wasn't precise. The problem is that "functionalism" has meant different things to different people. 

Sullivan, who coined "form follows function" actually loved ornament. But if I remember rightly Mies van der Rohe was opposed to ornament as anti-functional. I don't know if he thought all ornament was ugly, but he was opposed to it. Also in type, Bayer's alphabet was I think also pared down of all ornament, breathing of this same ideology. 

So I'm only really talking about one strand in functionalism, but I do think it's the one that made the most noise in the last century--at least what I remember of it, which is the second half.

By radicalism I mean that view that in any field we have to tear up the past and start again. So radicalism and traditionalism, in the senses I am used to using them, are opposed to each other. 

I certainly think type should be functional, but I think "functionalism" has been used for some ideologies that are too narrow and restrictive.

Actually, the italics are a good example showing why it is simplistic to identify functionality with lack of ornament and simple geometrical forms. 

The lack of simplicity of italics, and their slower reading, helps provide a contrast, and so is functional in a different way from the companion roman.

FWIW, I think the two are connected: It should move away, and it will, in part exactly because it's not limited by them anymore. But since I'm now approximately tasting one snowflake on top of the tip of the iceberg that is all this stuff, maybe ask me again in a year, or ten. :-)

<em>"Nina, I am uneasy about the philosophy I hear—maybe wrongly—in your phrase 'ideally based on functionality, rather than tradition.'"</em>
William, to be honest, I don't see how the phrase above is all that radical. What I meant was quite simply: let's do things *because* they work, because they get the job done – not *because* they have previously been done that way. Note that that doesn't mean "let's generally do things differently now, because the old ways don't work". It means that the <em>reasons</em>, the <em>motivation</em> for doing things a certain way should not be based solely on precedent, but on a functional analysis. 
I do believe that, and I do try to work that way when I can. 

<em>"if we go too far in altering the traditional forms people can’t read them."</em>
Take the example I quoted above: A typographer using a matching sans for emphasis inside a body of seriffed type. Are people not going to be able to read that, and understand that it's a subtle way of setting the "sansed" words apart?
I'm not saying that's what I aim to do; I'm saying it's another (uncommon) way of doing something similar to the (common) italicization, and I'd maintain that people would "understand" it just fine.

<em>"I certainly think type should be functional, but I think “functionalism” has been used for some ideologies that are too narrow and restrictive."</em>
But I didn't use the term "functionalism".</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think when we apply doctrine to things so severely, we can error on either side.

If ornament is OK, then lack of ornament must be equally OK

We can have a continuum without excluding the poles at either end. We can indeed bend the continuum into a mobius band and let be an unjudgmental field of endeavor.
I don't think ornamentation or its absence is codependent on functionality. There are cases where poorly done ornament can inhibit function but that is a function of it being poorly done, not that it should not exist in any form. 
Likewise, there are cases where poorly done lack of ornamentation may inhibit function but again, this is an issue of quality, not omission.

It is not so much what you as how well you do it that makes it more or less functional, it is how well you do it.
It is also a case of personal taste coloring our judgement of function. I know I would puke every day if I had to live in Versailles but would love the Square Glass House. The beauty of the house is that it became an undeniable participant in the surroundings while inviting the surroundings of nature to play their daily changes to the inhabitants indoors. Absence of ornament was the key to letting Mother Nature (the true master of ornament) to do her best work.

The buildings of Mies are quite a bit better than the utter crap the long line of wannabes created who followed in later years.

I think we may have some difference in that I think that traditional forms have an edge on functionality just because of their familiarity. So I think they are one variable to think of when designing with an eye to functionality, though other things might override tradition. 

Chris, I agree with you about Mies vs his imitators. I think that his style was very difficult and expensive to design in, and a lot of bad work was done, but though at its best it can be beautiful, and functional. I admit that even at their best I prefer Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright to Mies. 

I think that in type that this similar spirit of simplifying had better results: it led to using sans for text, which opened up the options and variety in type. Not exactly what was intended, but it ended up being good. </div>

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">Getting back to Kent's highly interesting formal question:

<em>"When you object to (or question) “cursive/chirographic,” what are you directing your attention at?"</em>
The overall atmosphere, I'm afraid. I wish I had a formula that exactly weighs the factors needed to achieve that effect, but I don't:

<em>"Taking sloped roman as a point of reference, which changes to the structure would make it necessarily “cursive”?"</em>
Again, I think it's an axis. There's no "cursive switch" that is either on or off… there are some factors that are more deciding maybe, but all in all, I'd say cursivity can be achieved via a cocktail of a number of factors, such as the ones you mentioned (moving away from a full-serif treatment, softening terminals; lowering joins [and thus moving closer to a 'single stroke' structure]; softening connections); softening the stroke itself (like by tapering); softening curves; and then there are some structural features that are very typical of cursive treatments (like the ubiquitous descending "f"). 
I find some of the constituents of cursiveness are hard to express in words, such as a certain "flow" of the curves reminiscent of calligraphy. Then again, shapes can also be quite rigid and still be calligraphic, such as in Joanna – that "g" is structurally a dead giveaway, while the rest of the font doesn't seem very calligraphic to me at all.

I'd suspect that any* combination of these points (and probably more) can play a part in making a letterform appear more or less cursive. I actually wish I had the time for a full structural analysis – but certainly that has been done before?
(* Maybe not really "any" though.)

**

FWIW, a raw sketch from when I started trying to figure out how to do my italics: 
(Pardon the ugly antialiasing.)
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cursiveness-f_5200.gif]

#1 is the original upright design.
A purist might argue that via the concept of "forward motion", #2 is already a chirographic design. I don't think it is. The way #3 plays with the bottom terminal starts to feel chirographic to me, but still subtly enough so. 
#4 obviously doesn't work but starts out in the overall direction that #5 and #6 take: There is an overall different structure/concept to the lettershape. That descender I might object to, because is there really a cogent reason for such a deep structural difference to the roman – besides historical background? (As opposed to something like the "a", where at least to my eyes, the slope almost necessitates a one-storeyed structure on a purely visual level – I think a slanted double-storey "a" just rarely looks good.)
BTW, note the taper in #6 too. #6 is a design I would probably not be crazy about making in my own font, exactly for its "cursiveness".

I admit the "f" is a very obvious example… your "n" would have been more subtle.

**

BTW, William, I'm really not sure how well the analogy of functionality in [text] type vs. architecture works – at least if you discuss its effects on a formal vocabulary. In architecture, functionalism has generally led to a sort of simplification/streamlining of the formal language, which in type would correspond to something like a minimal geometric sans – hardly "functional" for text.</div>

You purist, you! ;-)
But yeah, looking at it again, maybe #2 already has too much forward lean/reach in the curve. I had a full-serif, simply sloped version of #1 too, and the same thing as a semiserif, but I couldn't get either of them to work. OK, under that aspect I should have left out #4 too.
But this is really very rough &ndash; you're right that between any two of those (plus branching out from this one-dimensional axis) there are many more possibilities… it's pretty complex once you start thinking about it. (Not that I'm surprised… ;-) )

		<div class="commentbody">Your example to me shows difficulty of pinning down what exactly is "chirographic".

Your roman f already has a lot of very pen-like features: the asymetrical foot serif, the slight rise of the left part of the cross bar, the heavy terminal on the top. 

So your progression to italic is not more chirographic, but just more "cursive", as I think of it, more of a running hand--written more quickly, as John Hudson has pointed out is a feature of italics. 

> In architecture, functionalism has generally led to a sort of simplification/streamlining of the formal language, which in type would correspond to something like a minimal geometric sans – hardly “functional” for text.

Well, you won't get an argument from me on the utility of geometric sans for text, but I do think that historically you probably would have gotten an argument from the Bauhaus folks, and from Renner, creator of Futura, and perhaps even from Tschichold in his radical modernist phase. My impression from not very systematic reading is that historically the pursuit of the "neutral" sans for text was due to the various movements in functionalism and modernism.

Oh, absolutely. Even this is a continuum. Maybe any font that is designed as "strokes", rather than areas of black and white, has a bit of chirography in its heart. And this one is monoline!

<em>"Your roman f already has a lot of very pen-like features"</em>
Hrm.
The asymmetrical foot serif, it seems, needs to be there, for stability. If I make it symmetrical, the glyph falls over.
The left part of the crossbar is tapered on top for consistency with x-line serifs; and the font has tapering (wedge-slab) serifs overall. Not sure how that's a pen feature. 
And would you say ball terminals are by definition "pen-like"? How about Archer – is that a deeply chirographic font?

It's not that the idea of my font being chirographic makes me run away screaming – it just surprises me to hear that, because I wasn't working from that basis. Actually I even dropped my calligraphy class at that time…

And to wrap that up, I am certainly not a "functionalist" in the historical sense. But in my design work I [try to] value functionality more highly than prettiness.

Chris, do you mean something like this? (Please forgive the crudity of the curves.)
If I make the top curve shorter it stops looking like an "f".

Hey nice, learned something new again! Thanks.

Nah not because it's mainstream, but because my font isn't a hum-sans. I feel the need to put something on that curve… it's feeling naked in a slab. And I think I need it to be less lyrical/flowy. More stable, essentially. But hey, this is an interesting tangent:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/f-more_4847.gif]
#5 is the one from just before. How about a serif/beak on that (#4 &ndash; instead of the ball in #6 from before)? I like the hard/soft balance in that. Or maybe one could even eliminate that descender again and put the semiserif back on (#3). But that might be a bit too serious. Ahh endless possibilities! :-)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This is perhaps veering into a critique-style thread. I'd like to pull back a bit to probe the philosophical aspect of your inquiry (which I find much more interesting than design-by-committee -- no offense intended).

<cite> > And I think I need it to be less lyrical/flowy. </cite>

I take this statement to basically summarize your principal objection to the cursive form structure. 

Previously, we were beginning to inquire into the functional justifications, if any, behind cursive adaptations to form structure when creating an emphatic companion for an upright roman style. 

So let me turn this inquiry back around now: Why would you include the ball terminal in your roman, but reject it as "lyrical" in the companion? What is your functional purpose in deviating between the two in this stylistic detail?

BTW, "because I like it better" is perfectly fine with me. I'm playing Devil's advocate. You've set up your approach as being a functional, deep inquiry, so I'm probing with you.

<cite> > I had a full-serif, simply sloped version of #1 too, and the same thing as a semiserif, but I couldn’t get either of them to work.</cite>

How are you defining "work"? Aye, there's the rub. 

It's difficult to judge the <em>f</em>&nbsp; in isolation, but I'm going to assume that for this inquiry we've accepted the value of a semiserif form structure to accompany the slight angle. So, the question becomes: if this half-serif termination works for other letters, including other long-stemmed letters like <em>d</em> and <em>l</em>, then why does it not work for <em>f</em>&nbsp;? 

If we go on to accept that it doesn't, then does this mean that there is in fact a purpose to extending the stem below the baseline (which others have argued before is a "cursive/chirographic" affectation)? Does this extension need a terminal? Why? If so, what kind is called for?

Yes, it might have been easier to start with something other than <em>f</em>. This character may in fact be the most stubborn challenge. ;-)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for a thought-provoking thread, Nina. After turning this over, I'm convinced that there is no problem with having some cursiveness in a companion italic. The reason, as I have said, is that a companion italic, when in the context of the roman, should read a bit more slowly than the roman. 

I do think there is a lower boundary on readability of a companion, beyond which it starts to be dysfunctional. And I do think some old style italics fall below that minimum, including Caslon's original italics, in text sizes. But so long as the italic design is above that boundary, I think the decision of how cursive to make the italic is an aesthetic one, rather than a question of functionality.

For example, Adobe Jenson roman is a highly readable text font, with a lot of pen touches. And the highly pen-influenced italic, based on Arrighi, to me is just great, and highly functional.    

The fact that some of the features of your f which are similar to pen-drawn f's can be justified on grounds other than being chirographic to me just goes to show: many, though not all, of the features of the way expert scribes wrote letters with a pen were highly functional, and still work in type. </div>

		<div class="commentbody"><em>"This is perhaps veering into a critique-style thread. I’d like to pull back a bit"</em>
Thank you! That's a good thing.

I think one issue at the core of my search is that I object to a too-strong stylistic break &ndash; in terms of the "feel", or "voice" &ndash; between a (my) roman and its italic. 
I admit that this purpose is more aesthetic than functional (except that in type, aesthetics automatically take on a function in communication): Finding a tone, for the italic, that speaks on a similar level as the roman. And that means it can't be all swirly-girly when the roman is stable and somewhat rigid. Except maybe when you make it exactly for occasions that call for swirly-girly type of emphasis, but that should be pretty rare. :->

So it's a lot about the overall "tone", and that's how my objection to that ball terminal came about: I have nothing against ball terminals per se, but in the context of this font, their tendency to feel "ornate", or "pretty", or "flowy" has to be reined in by rigidity in other features. In the roman, I have a very stable and serious overall architecture. In the italic, *if* the structure gets more cursive, that seems to call for a harsher terminal to get some sort of hard/soft balance back. Conversely, in a slanted/semiserif italic that has more inherent rigidity, I can absolutely see the ball terminal work.

<em>"if this half-serif termination works for other letters […] then why does it not work for f?"</em>
Sorry, I realize I was unclear there. I do actually think the semiserif structure can work for the "f" (as in #2 in the last picture I posted); the sentence you quoted was from my reply to Ben, who asked about a sloped-roman without the changes to the top curve (hood?), thus referring to a semiserif version of the slanted roman with an uncorrected curve. (Is this thread getting confusing? &%-) )

<em>"How are you defining “work”? Aye, there’s the rub."</em>
Yep. I should probably have started this thread in a couple of weeks, when I will actually be working on the italics in-depth. I'm still theorizing…
Then again, I was only going to ask about examples to look at. Ah well. :-)

**

<em>"I’m convinced that there is no problem with having some cursiveness in a companion italic. The reason, as I have said, is that a companion italic, when in the context of the roman, should read a bit more slowly than the roman."</em>
But cursive isn't just slower, it smells different! That's my main objection to the idea (see my post of 4.Aug.2009 12.37am above), and I don't think it can just be dismissed. 
Looking at the sort of usage that is common for italics today &ndash; say book titles or maybe foreign words in running text &ndash; why would I want to say that in a "scriptier" tone? A more "handwritten" one? That highlighted book title is not a personal note to the Dear Reader.
And we must agree that this "scriptiness" of cursive italics, like the "tone" or feeling of any font really, gets through to the reader and communicates something besides raw content, and pure function ("oh, it's highlighted") – it communicates an atmosphere, a tone, a <em>voice</em>. If we don't believe that gets through to the reader, we might as well stop designing type.

<em>"The fact that some of the features of your f which are similar to pen-drawn f’s can be justified on grounds other than being chirographic to me just goes to show: many, though not all, of the features of the way expert scribes wrote letters with a pen were highly functional, and still work in type."</em>
Of course: Scribes were experts when it comes to letterforms, and some of these features are solutions to problems inherent in the lettershapes. I'd think that anyone who produces letters and has a reasonably good eye is going to see that an upright, serifed "f" (like an "r") needs a little extra help to not fall over, and will compensate for it with maybe a longer right-side foot serif, no matter if they're working with a pen, or beziers, or mosaic stones. </div>

I think you're exaggerating and over-generalizing here. 

And this is why I think it may be important to get to the bottom of what is "scripty" about the cursive form structure -- is it inherent in the structure or is it more a by-product of certain interpretations and implementations of that structure?

That is to say, if a semiserif structure (i.e., the in- and out-stroke structure generally associated with italic forms), when combined with slant, is inherently "scripty" in tone, then you're thrust back toward the option of a purely sloped roman.

Part of the challenge in your quest is that you're trying to minimize both of the most distinctive and defining parameters of the typical "emphatic companion" -- angle *and* form structure. 

If you wish to eliminate as much cursive structure as possible from your "italic," yet still have it differentiate from the roman adequately to perform the distinguishing role, then you may want to allow greater angle than 3 or 4 degrees.

Conversely, if you're set on a very modest slope, then you may find you need to admit greater deviation in form structure (admit more cursive structure), and then find a way to divorce it from whatever "scripty" associations.

Yes, I realize that brings us back to where you started with your request for exemplars. And I fear I'm just repeating myself. So, good luck in your quest. I'll be interested to hear/see your conclusions.

And Kent: Thank you for your concise questions. Thinking about them is confusing and illuminating at the same time. :-)

<em>"I think you’re exaggerating and over-generalizing here."</em>
Well, I was trying to make a point. :->
Softer version: I would claim that italics that follow a cursive model/structure tend to have a more "handwritten" flavor than their accompanying romans. And that this more chirographic flavor is, at the very least, not a required attribute from a perspective of what the style is required to do &ndash; and at most, detrimental, say to credibility, or to a constant "tone" throughout a text. 
Maybe there's something I'm not seeing here – but I will continue to believe this unless/until somebody convinces me it's wrong / incomplete / …

<em>"if a semiserif structure (i.e., the in- and out-stroke structure generally associated with italic forms), when combined with slant, is inherently “scripty” in tone…"</em>
I actually think that can be very scripty, and pretty non-scripty (depending to a great degree on what you call "semiserif" – I wish words were as specific as curves…).
I'll be trying to stay as close to the non-scripty end as I can, for as long as it appears to make sense. In the end, I'd rather have the thing be a bit more cursive in character than not differentiate enough. Well maybe. :-)

Thanks everyone for your input. This has been quite an exciting discussion!

Okay, an illustration of what I mean for purposes of clarification. Taking a relatively neutral, linear design in order to focus on structure:

A) the typical upright roman serif structure
B) a common approach to semiserif structure
C) roman, slanted 6.34° (1:9 slope)
D) semiserif, slanted

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SemiSlopItal_6000.png]

&nbsp;
Is the B structure inherently more informal than A? Why? Does it seem more "handwritten" simply because people don't write like A?

When people stop handwriting altogether a couple generations from now, thanks to texting, will they completely lose the informal, handwritten association with this semiserif structure also?

When you add slant to the semiserif structure, D, is this more inherently "scripty"? Festive? Personal? Suited more for a wedding invitation? </div>

		<div class="commentbody"><em>Is the B structure inherently more informal than A? Why? Does it seem more “handwritten” simply because people don’t write like A?</em>

It seems more handwritten I think because approximating it with a pen would require lifting the pen less often. (Or, from the other direction, people don't write like A because it requires lifting the pen more often.)

<em>(At least, not anymore. They used to, of course — that’s how we got this roman structure!)</em>

My sense (provided mostly from the Twomey <em>Fine Print</em> article I cited at my Typecon talk) is that the bidirectional serif on minuscules was actually a relatively short trend in later humanist scripts, influenced by inscriptions. I think your B is the structure closest to the way people wrote during most of that development. In other words, I might see B as a variant based on A today, but historically it might be more accurate to call A a variant based on B.

<em>When you add slant to the semiserif structure, D, is this more inherently “scripty”? Festive? Personal? Suited more for a wedding invitation?</em>

In addition to whatever implications of writing the semi-serifs might offer the slanted letters, of course they also help rebalance them. Which of those 'l's could stand on its own? A and D. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">More thoughts--interesting topic! I think for your goals, solutions not so radical as trying to minimize both slant and cursiveness will work. If you do away with both traditional markers of a companion italic, I fear that it will just "read" as a different roman font. 

The slant seems to be particularly useful. For example, Hebrew, which traditionally did not use slanted characters for emphasis, I believe use them now. They don't use cursive Hebrew as a companion--it has very different forms--but just use slant.

The problem with sloped romans of serif faces has been that for some reason they have tended to look very dull and flat footed. Maybe this just has to do with expectations about italics, but I don't know. The sloped roman of sans designs do work, so maybe it has something to do with normal roman serifs in the lower case not being happy with the rest of the character sloped, as in Kent's illustration.  </div>

Craig, sorry, glossed over this earlier. First, we have to realize that writing was still mostly limited to the scribal tradition, as literacy was not widespread. You're right to point out that this "roman" structure certainly wasn't a majority style within that tradition, with plenty of counterexamples, especially up north. One wonders whether we'd be using this as a primary structure today if it weren't for the success and popularity of the thoughts that it was used to express. 

And I wonder if the scribes up north didn't react to these letterforms as being too "petragraphic" ;-) But that's a side topic for another day.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Kent, on the spread of the roman as opposed to blackletter styles, Harry Carter's account in "A View of Early Typography" is worth reading, if you haven't already. While his labored prose is a bit off-putting, the story is fascinating. 

The roman style was associated with printing Latin classics, and contemporary writings of humanists. The battle of scripts got mixed up with the Reformation, with roman style being Catholic and blackletter being Protestant. According to Carter, the patronage of King Francis I of France was crucial for the spread of roman as the dominant script. Of course it wasn't until the 20th century that Germany, the last hold-out, switched to roman as dominant, though interestingly scientific writings in German were often in roman in the 19th century.

I'm sure Carter's account could be filled out to a whole book, following the story after the early years of printing.  </div>

Interestingly, the same is true of Thai, which now uses bold and italic in much the same way as roman type systems. Traditionally, Thai had up to five 'styles': classic (monoline), craft (calligraphic), tail (swashed and slanted), modern (kind of Western looking) and script (cursive and slanted). Combining these in text would be like mixing up Helvetica, Ondine, Avant Garde, Zapf Chancery and Comic Sans, so although they are all still in use, they don't normally complement each other for emphasis.

		<div class="commentbody">Kent, very briefly (impending deadline eating my time, sorry): Thanks for the visual example, that clears up a lot. I'd say on my "cursivity" or "chirograpic-ness" scale, even your #D (which is actually pretty close to what I'm going to use at least as a starting point) is still very moderate. It does look slightly more "informal" to me than the roman (which may come down to some apparent inherent "ease of writing" in these shapes – what Craig said) but not "scripty" yet. But I'd argue most italics in text fonts don't stop there: Add more "cursive" features like curved in- and out-strokes, lower joins, more "directed" and narrower curves, and it becomes more what I'd call scripty – essentially, these classic constituents of cursive structure are inherently chirographic.

<em>"If you do away with both traditional markers of a companion italic, I fear that it will just “read” as a different roman font."</em>
William, you may well be right. I'm prepared to fail, and adjust my ideas/goals accordingly. But there are so many variables in this (on such a fine-grained scale no less) that I feel I can't predict what'll happen (and what'll work) until I actually try.

The angle is 3.58 degrees (which works out as an 1/16 slant) and the structure not very cursive (at least to my understanding), though the curves are tighter, and it uses a semi-serif structure. 
Both these restrictions (slight on slant and cursiveness) seemed desirable due to the pairing with the Armenian part of the family, which shares the same slant and overall structure (so the Italic doubles in function as a very harmonious companion to the Armenian – see the «Family Concept» graphic here: http://ernestinefont.com/about-the-design/). 
The challenge then was to still make it work as a companion Italic to the Roman; which is why I started this thread. To my eye it works – it's a fairly subtle Italic, but it reads nicely, and the upside of it not being excessively cursive or slanted is that it can also work for longer passages without becoming too tiring to read (I've actually used the Italic as a standalone font, too).</div>

> I would have thought you might be critical of how upright the Ernestine italic is.

Critical of it? Here's a clue: the slant is <em>exactly</em> the same as in Patria...  :-)
But I know what you're getting at: I've said -and maintain- that an Italic doesn't need
to be cursive, and should not have a very different voice than its Roman. That might
imply I that believe in strong slant, but actually I like seeing it only as strong as it
needs to be based on the other characteristic; in fact characteristics such as width,
weight and even x-height are typically sufficient in decent repro conditions even at
smaller text sizes, so all that remains is that the slant be visible. When I made
Nour&Patria I arrived at 1/16* (~3.5 degrees) as a good place to be, but to be honest
this did take into account that the slant of the Latin-Italic was to match the slant
of the "non-Italic" Armenian design, which I didn't want to be too slanted (for reasons
of readability, and to leave room for an "Italic" in the future). Now, Ernestine has
an Armenian too** so can follow that logic; a font that is unlikely to end up with an
Armenian (like, most of them :-) does not need to be so stingy in terms of slant.

* It only makes sense to use integer slopes.

** It's interesting that although Ernestine's Italic is
in fact influenced by another writing system I don't think
it's possible to glean that, and certainly not as having had a
negative effect. Probably due to the wonderful "speculative"
design that Latin type has enjoyed, it feels quite acceptable.

As for using Italic structures (like for the "a" and "g") I can think of three reasons:
one that Nina already mentioned which is that some Roman structures just don't look
too happy when slanted; the other is to pull the Italic just a little but further away from the Roman (so nothing to do with cursiveness per se*); and the third could be as a
ruse, to make people accept it (although this smells of peer acceptance).

* You will notice that Nina and I avoid the hokey descending "f".

BTW, I'm happy you like Ernestine.

As to John's and Nick's valid questioning of calling Ernestine's Italic a "slanted-
Roman", I would say (as I did at TypeCon-LA) that -at least until the style becomes
a valid, mainstream way of making Italics (as I think it was before WWI)- it's most
useful to see it as a loose spectrum, unifying the various ways people can go with
its spirit, in contra to the traditional Italic philosophy. So sure, Ernestine's
Italic is not a mechanical (and not even a subsequently-tweaked) oblique, but it
has the spirit of the slanted-Roman. To me even something like Adelle's does.
http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/typetogether/adelle_italic_ot/

I guess the "Roman" in "slanted-Roman" is a two-edged sword: it reinforces the
Italic's [typically] subservient role, but on the other hand it might create too
strong an association in terms of how it was designed. What I was getting at
above is that once enough slanted-Romans have been made we can tighten/expand
the terminology. I would hate to see a fragmentation of effort that terminological
infighting can lead to.

Would I have made Ernestine's Italic exactly like that? No. For one thing
I would have made the diagonals straight. But maybe for that reason it
would have ended up less successful on the market...

BTW Nick, this discussion naturally pertains less to sans fonts,
although I certainly do appreciate what you've done with S&S.

Actually there are a number of older -and better- precedents.
Even ATF's stuff is older (although it suffers from the same
extremeness*) although in their case they had a mechanical
expedient (in the form of the pantograph).

* See below.

That's because -as Nina suggest- he was too extreme.
Deberny and G&S did much better.

Speak for yourself, lady.  :-)
I'm on my horse, flail and shield at the ready.

Nina, your 7-"f" illustration (Aug. 5, 2009) is great.
Can I re-use it?

That makes no sense. The only way to slow
down immersive reading is to break it. Bad.

From my Daidala interview:
"
If you believe that a typeface carries emotional associations in its forms*, then you have to conclude that the conventional practice of having only italics for emphasis is one-dimensional. There can be many kinds of emphasis, many nuances a discerning typographer might want to give snippets of text. So what would be nice is a system of fonts than can nest into each other and convey various emotions, such as stress, sensuality, whatever. What do italics convey? Mostly informality and motion – not necessarily what the text being marked is about.

* And if you don't, how do you justify making yet more fonts?

		<div class="commentbody">Nina, in response to your points in the other thread: <em>John, I'm glad you like it. And surprised about your assessment of the Italic! When you speak of «conventional Italic» letter shapes I assume you must be looking at things like the a and g? ... But if you look at the whole thing in terms of construction, they're interrupted (? not continuous) strokes, the curves are quite rigid, and rather than pen-reminiscent instrokes and outstrokes this one has flat serifs (ok, half ones) in the placement typical of a Roman; all characteristics that to me make it more of a slanted-Roman than a classic cursive-infused Italic.</em>

Not just the a and g, but also the related bowl shapes in the b d p q, and the uninterrupted construction of the e. Note that I was responding to the top line of <a href="http://ernestinefont.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/specimen_sale2.gif">this image</a>, which perhaps biases things by including only one n and no m or h. These letters are closer to what I think of as slanted-roman forms.

I entirely agree with you that this is something other than ‘cursive’, but it probably deserves some better term than slanted-roman. I'd be inclined -- following my analysis that all literary cultures produce both formal (slow, interrupted, <em>formata</em>) and informal (fast, cursive, <em>corsiva</em>) styles -- to call this a ‘formal italic’.</div>

Hm, I see what you mean. Oh yes, the e, of course – I've certainly made some details <em>softer</em> than in the Roman too, like those curves in the diagonals that Hrant never liked but I insisted on :-). I spontaneously quite like the «formal italic» term the way you propose it.</div>
