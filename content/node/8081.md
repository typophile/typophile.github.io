  body: Harrr, shiver me counters! <BR>I was actually asking on behalf of a font house
    where the font technician was absent during some emergency, and I was asked to
    help. <BR>Somebody&#42; actually sent me just what they needed. Although now I&#39;ve
    become curious if there&#39;s anything that does this on the Mac too. <BR> <BR>&#42;
    And it&#39;s somebody who would look quite incongruous donning an eye-patch. <BR>
    <BR>Adam, by renaming I meant a &#34;full rename&#34;, where every field in the
    font is updated. In this case it seems just a prefix needed to be changed though.

  body: 'Hrant,  <BR> <BR>I use a font freeware font renamer for Windows that goes
    the other way around: it changes the filename of a font so it becomes identical
    with the PostScript font name inside of it. I can&#39;t stand font filenames such
    as _am_b__.pfb or something and prefer them being named AmericanTypewriter-Bold.pfb
    and the sorts. There is a nice free app that does this sort of thing in batches,
    for subfolders, but I don&#39;t know its name now &#40;I&#39;m on my Mac now&#41;.  <BR>
    <BR>As for changing the internal names for fonts, I myself use Python with FontLab
    and TTX. Not completely straightforward when it comes to Type 1 fonts, especially
    Mac Type 1 fonts, though.  <BR> <BR>Best, <BR>Adam'

  body: There was a set of utilities that came with Y&amp;Y TeX that would do what
    you want. Sadly, Y&amp;Y TeX is no more, but I imagine there are similar utilities
    available from the Tex Users Group &#40;TUG&#41;. <BR> <BR>These utilities run
    in a DOS shell on a windows machine . . . <BR> <BR>First, using one utility, you
    make a PFA from the PFB. Once you have a Printer_Font_ASCII, you can rename the
    font with the utility, &amp; it goes inside &amp; makes sure everything that needs
    renaming is renamed. &#40;We
