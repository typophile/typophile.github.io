  without posting...sorry. I have a good deal of respect for most of you and must
  thank you for the knowledge you make available.  <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s a link to some
  of my stuff: <BR><a href="http://natenielson.com/type/type.html" target="_blank">http://natenielson.com/type/type.html</a>
  <BR> <BR>Most are, well, crappy but some are pretty mediocre if I do say-so myself.
  If you can bring yourself to critique something I&#39;ll be pleased. If you can
  say even more, I&#39;ll be happy. And if you&#39;re harsh, I&#39;ll be overjoyed.

  body: hey nate, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m kind of a haunter too. you&#39;ve got a lot of
    designs, pretty prolific. <BR> <BR>I really like your gaelic/uncial faces. they
    seem the most refined and the shapes are really beautiful. Some of your other
    &#34;ethnic&#34; &#40;for lack of a better descriptor&#41; faces are interesting
    as well &#40;Runestick in particular&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Are there any that you&#39;re
    currently working on and trying to refine? Maybe a more focused critique would
    be helpful <BR> <BR>eric

  body: I like to think of myself as an illustrator, but all my sketchbooks from the
    past year or so are filled with letterforms! Hah! <BR> <BR>I never consciously
    thought, &#34;i&#39;m gunna make a font.&#34; It&#39;s been  as if something possessed
    me, whether I liked it or not. So having been a designer &#40;with an MFA no less&#41;
    and never studied type, what could I do?... Haunt, and try to apply what I learned.
    <BR> <BR>So this is what I have to show after a year. Don&#39;t ask me where I
    got the nerve to post &#39;em though. <BR> <BR>nate

    my comments until now... I especially like <strong>Ockiahex</strong>... \r\n\r\nAny
    chance that you\u2019ll develop uppercase characters and numerals for it? It might
    be difficult to have a \u201Ctrue\u201D uppercase if you want to stick to the
    hexagonal motif, but making the typeface unicase might be a good solution\u2026"
