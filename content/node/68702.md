body: "Hi I am currently looking for a complemental font to go with Avant Garde Gothic
  Pro. \r\nI will be using it for kind of short length text. \r\nMy problem is that
  AGGP Draws alot of attention to itself and I need to find a balance between the
  copy text and the display font (which will be AGGP)\r\n\r\nRight now I am thinking
  of using any of the web-safe fonts to have it a bit easier on my online portfolio.\r\nBut
  I am not quite shure any of them serifs will do the job.\r\n\r\nBut what do you
  think am I stupid or do you have any suggestions?\r\n\r\n"

    and Candida. \r\nOr a rather broad face like Century \u2013 not the most beautiful
    font ever, but it get's shipped with OS/Software.\r\nSimilar fonts from that category
    (Transitional) should work as well."
