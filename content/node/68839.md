  the following rule in OT font: \r\n\r\n(in human language) If the word ends with
  \"r\", it should be substituted with \"r.alt\"\r\n\r\nSo far I've been trying to
  understand FL manual, search this forum and google for tutorials, but with no luck
  at all.\r\n"

    replaced in the end of the last word only. What\u2019s better, is probably dependent
    from the font. And there is a registered feature for your purpose, the fina-feature.
    So you also can name the terminal form of the r \"r.fina\"."

    <strong>'</strong> is missing in the substitution rule because of the ignore rule
    with the \"context indicator\" (<strong>'</strong>) in it."

    the KERN-table. I am not sure, what you mean. You don\u2019t have to export anything
    separated from the font. Go to FontLab options/generating OpenType and TrueType/Kerning."

    class based kerning, eg @r [r r.end] assuming the left hand side of the glyphs
    are the same.  If not, and you need to kern the swashes separately, you can copy
    and paste the resultant sring from the OpenType Preview window into the Metrics/Kerning
    window.\r\n\r\nI have suggested on the Fontlab forum that it would be good if
    the Metrics window could be set to apply OpenType substitutions, to make this
    process less of a hassle."

    Assistance - Update [kern] feature.\r\n\r\nOne other thing to remember - the kern
    feature only works if there is another OpenType feature in the font.  Simple enough
    to put in liga - sub f i by fi.\r\n\r\nThen when you export it will say something
    like, 'kerning has changed.... blah blah blah'\r\n\r\nClick yes"

    And x, y, z and x.alterSchwede can be single characters, lists of characters (in
    brackets) or classes (@classname) or lists of classes (in brackets). But it is
    better explained in the manual. You will not learn, if you don\u2019t try to solve
    problems by yourself at first. If anything does not work, you can still ask. And
    I recommend to study the feature files, that Adobe provides for Minion (along
    with the AFDKO, as far as I remember)."

    AFDKO is the abbreviation for Adobe Font Development Kit for OpenType, that is
    available for free. You can download the AFDKO and the Minion feature file at
    \"http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/\".\r\n\r\n<cite>What needs to be
    changed in the code if I want to make a start swash or a swash that comes up only

    manual (Context Dependent Substitutions).\r\n\r\n<cite>What's the point in studying
    the code if you don't know the language</cite>\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t think, that
    it is possible to learn a programming language without studying code parallel.
    In case of OpenType I am even not sure, if the feature file syntax is a language."
