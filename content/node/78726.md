body: "Last week I saw the website of Designers & Books, a very nice initiative. But
  in the [[http://www.designersandbooks.com/books/author/genre/all/list|list of books]]
  I was very much distracted by the use of Title Case in the book titles.\r\n\r\nMost
  text editing software nowadays has the possibility to change a sentence into Title
  Case (or lowercase, UPPERCASE, Sentence case and maybe even CamelCase). Personally
  I think the use of Title Case makes the book titles swollen-headed. \r\n\r\nWhere
  does this practice of Title Case come from? Is it an American custom? Who invented
  Title Case? And who can tell me the pros of using it?\r\n\r\n"
