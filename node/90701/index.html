  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hey guys, I was reading Gerrit Noordzij&rsquo;s translated &ldquo;The Stroke: Theory of Writing&rdquo; and am trying to get my head around applying the idea of white space to all forms of writing,</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>as he says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Writing rests on the relative proportions of the white in the word. The various kinds of writing with their various constructions and their various strokes can be compared with each other only in terms of the white of the word – every comparison requires a vantage point that makes things comparable. The white of the word is the only thing all the various kinds of writing have in common. This universal vantage point holds for handwriting and typography alike, for ancient writing as well as modern writing, for western writing as well as the writing of other cultures, in short, it holds for writing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing research for my thesis on urban street typography in Metro Manila (Philippines). This is the link to the current research online: <a href="http://www.whoiscarlgraham.com/urbantype/jeepneytypography.htm">http://www.whoiscarlgraham.com/urbantype/jeepneytypography.htm</a></p>
<p>I am fascinated how Noordzij says this but am wondering if there&rsquo;s some structured way I can speak about the type using the concept of white space. I loved &ldquo;The stroke of the pen,&rdquo; but I&rsquo;m still trying to fully grasp the concepts covered as I feel they can really help me with my thesis.</p>

<p>What he&rsquo;s talking about is &ldquo;negative space&rdquo;, which is the space around an object. It&rsquo;s an important concept in graphic design. Sounds like he&rsquo;s focused on the space immediately around the characters themselves, rather than the entire page or sign.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t call it &ldquo;the white&rdquo; because that&rsquo;s only accurate when writing on a white surface. If a sign has white type on a red background, for instance, the negative space is red.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The white of the word is the only thing all the 
various kinds of writing have in common.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t read his writing, but my offhand impression is that his comment doesn&rsquo;t seem very useful. The negative space is dictated by the shapes of the letters. If the negative spaces have common traits, it&rsquo;s because the writing itself has common traits.</p>

It has been my experience that a professor won’t even dignify the work with a mark. Even at an undergraduate level. It will simply be returned to you with comment to the effect of “re-submit this after you have conducted a literature review.” Regardless of it’s lack of credibility, it can change over time resulting in differennt interpretations of your work.

<li>
<p>I agree with Nick. You need to operatinalize your terms. This means to define what <!-- raw HTML omitted -->you<!-- raw HTML omitted --> mean when you use a word in your paper. Not a formal declaration of the word’s meaning in every context in every dictionary in the world. Just for the purpose of your paper. This prevents potential misinterpretation and is standard practice in virtually all writing at a graduate level and beyond.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The structure of your current writing is remarkably close to the APA structure of a manuscript. I encourage you to move forward in that direction to formalize your work. See:</p>

I do plan on setting that forward in the writing though. I guess what I&rsquo;m looking for is some systematic way of looking at the white space as opposed to just &ldquo;feeling&rdquo; them as I normally do. Any suggestions?</p>
<p>@Christopher: thanks for reading! I actually use the term thesis casually in that first post, which I probably shouldn&rsquo;t have done. It&rsquo;s actually a final project for our undergraduate level course. The interviews were written more casually in hopes that they&rsquo;d be more interesting and readable. The actual project has more weight in the quality of the execution using the medium (web, application, feature video). And the website up there was a smaller class project that served as an impetus for this final project topic which I have yet to execute. You provide some very good points though, regarding the literature. I wanted something even more straightforward in the final site, something visitors would &ldquo;get&rdquo; within seconds and have the option to look into through something like a read more link. Any thoughts on that?</p>
<p>@hrant, I saw that you did work on non-roman scripts on the fonts on your site. How did you go about developing/analyzing the forms? Do you know of any resources I could look into for the evolution of brahmic scripts? The Philippines has an ancient one and i&rsquo;d like to see of the forms may have trickled into the forms of the letterers.</p>
<p>Can I call them that btw, “letterers” any one-word alternatives to sign painters?</p>

<p>It is determined by the relative scale of the tool size to the letter height.
The white space is what’s left over after the ink/paint has been applied.
This applies even to constructed brushwork.</p>
<p>Constraints include the complexity of letterform, and the amount of words in the page layout.</p>

<p>If Noordzij were talking about the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->shape<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of the white, I&rsquo;d agree that there are specific situations in which the marking of the black determines the shape of the white such that the latter must be considered secondary. By the same token, though, if one were to manipulate the pen to shape the white in some particular way, that would subjugate the black to the white, and I&rsquo;m not sure the situation is much changed if one creates the black/white edges in some independent way: decisions about shapes affect adjacent shapes.</p>
<p>But Noordzij is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not<!-- raw HTML omitted --> talking about the shape of the white, he is talking about &lsquo;the relative proportions of the white in the word&rsquo;, in the context of comparing different examples of writing. His point, and I think it is a sound one, is that if one seeks a single common measure by which one can compare <!-- raw HTML omitted -->any<!-- raw HTML omitted --> two or more examples &ndash; regardless of script, age, style &ndash; then the only measure available is relative proportion of the white, because all other aspects of the examples introduce too many variables. In particular, note that the stroke itself does not provide such a measure.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, we&rsquo;re talking about measures of comparison, a basic principle of which is that you need to isolate the factors that are unique to the things being compared, and identify a common factor or factors. In the case of text, given the particularities of writing systems and of individual styles within those writing systems, proportion of white isn&rsquo;t the easiest measure available, it is the only common measure. This is not to say that there are not other common measures that would apply to some particular set of compared examples &ndash; slant is a common measure by which italics can be compared, for example, but not romans &ndash;, only that when you take all text, in toto, the only common basis on which they can <!-- raw HTML omitted -->all<!-- raw HTML omitted --> be compared is relative proportion of white. And I don&rsquo;t think Noordzij is making this point in order to suggest that comparing different examples of writing in this way is a useful exercise, but to stress the universality of the proportional role of the white in all the world&rsquo;s writing systems.</div>

<p>&ldquo;Writing rests on the relative proportions of the white in the word.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What does &ldquo;rests&rdquo; mean to you? To me he seems to be
making a much more radical statement than you state.</p>
<p>BTW are you sure he means relative to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->black<!-- raw HTML omitted -->?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The white of the word is the only thing all
the various kinds of writing have in common.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By &ldquo;the white&rdquo; does he really mean &ldquo;the relative proportions
of the white and black&rdquo;? Because otherwise it&rsquo;s entirely white-
centric. Is this his way of negating black-centricism? Because
to me it&rsquo;s like demolishing a building full of people you don&rsquo;t
agree with; it&rsquo;s better to convince them to leave the building
because it&rsquo;s not livable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it is the only common measure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s the only common <!-- raw HTML omitted -->explicit<!-- raw HTML omitted --> measure. But what I
was saying before is that doesn&rsquo;t make it valuable.</p>
<p>If you take two unlike Latin typefaces where the
Regular and Bold of one is comparable to the other&rsquo;s
in terms of weight, is it accurate to say that the two
Bolds are more alike than the Regular &amp; Bold of each?
Certainly not.</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>If GN is in fact saying what you think he&rsquo;s saying,
it&rsquo;s entirely banal. What I think he&rsquo;s saying -in
obstructive language- is simply that the white is
important. Which is worth pointing out to novices,
but does not really help deal with the deeper issue
of how to build optimal type.</p>

<p>WHITE is critical to me! When I design I am constantly bouncing back and forth between the black and white. In Pooper the black came easily but the white was critical in defining the appearance, fit and texture and frustrated me for quite some time. Without hesitation I would proffer that the white was/is primary, the black secondary (although black was the genesis of the font). Whenever I do commercial lettering the first generation touch up is white letters on black background so I am essentially reworking the &ldquo;white.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This may not bolster your argument if you really think my fonts are &ldquo;junk&rdquo; :-)
When I started 30 years ago Notan was mentioned frequently by calligraphic artists that I respected.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Carl,</p>
<p>You say you are fascinated with what Noordzij says about the white but are wondering if there’s some structured way you can speak about type using the concept of white space.</p>
<p>I see chapter 1 of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Stroke<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as a manifesto about something that eludes ‘structural’ description, and less about the ‘synergy’ between the ‘white’ and the ‘black,’ than about the centrality of the white.</p>
<p>In writing, that is, when it comes to readability, it&rsquo;s all about the white. The black of the letter must be close enough to conventional forms to be identifiable — and these vary from type to type and script to script — but when it comes to words and texts (which are what writing puts in place) the white is primary. If there is no equi-valence between the whites inside the letters  and the whites between the letters, and if there is no disruption between the white of the word and the white space between words, the word disappears because the word-image as a bounded visual gestalt or unitary object-like entity falls apart.</p>
<p>However, while you can get a precise or ‘structural’ description of the black, even when the shapes deviate from the strokes of writing in systematic (and unsystematic!) ways, you can only gauge the whites of the word according to their comparative ‘weights’ or valence.</p>
<p>I said the white eludes structural description, but it is possible to talk about the hierarchy of the whites in typography.</p>

<p>Indeed, and that is its nature. Having two Yins or
two Yangs is just pointless; and the more different
they are (for example one being explicit the other
implicit) the more fruitfully they unite. That said,
the way we make the black can improve, in terms
of ending up with better notan.</p>
<p>One thing that would help me understand things
better, looking at my own very modest efforts in

<p>Hrant, the white gives order to the black and harnesses its &ldquo;randomness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In your piece the white is irregular/disconcerting because symmetry/equality does not exist in the black. Individually your letters are acceptable but do not &ldquo;fit,&rdquo; in toto. Sorry, but at the point when you were doing the letters you WERE CONCENTRATING on the black&hellip; ONLY. You had not yet begun the process of assimilating the &ldquo;Yin and the Yang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I look at the &ldquo;channels, or canals&rdquo; that exist within and around the black. That is the white, and it has to work with the black in a way that is consistent, ordered and rational. It literally controls how the black should appear.</p>
<p>This too defines spacing/kerning.</p>

<p>Your observation that the main thing it produces

the need to separate the edges, basically obviating
the -formative- relevance of the body. And this is
how the white really becomes liberated.</p>

<p>Noordzij is asking the question &lsquo;What happens in the stroke when the pen is manipulated?&rsquo;, and tries to come up with a systematic terminology, independent of particular tools or techniques, within which to answer that question. I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s &lsquo;obfuscation&rsquo;. I also think that it is an approach that is of very little use or interest to a calligrapher, which is perhaps what you are expressing. Noordzij&rsquo;s analysis is of use and interest to people who need to look at and think about writing, not to writers, and still less to readers. I&rsquo;ve found it useful in two areas in which I&rsquo;m involved: palaeography and type design, the latter involving making letters from thought rather than from movement.</p>

It is precisely because I don&rsquo;t think the thought of letter design can be disassociated from the movements of the tool &ndash; although the association can be stretched and bent in various ways, some of which may be fruitful &ndash; that I find Noordzij&rsquo;s analysis of the results of those movements to be useful.</p>
<p>You have the particular facility of being able to perform with your hand what I can only perform with my mind and translate into technology. I have found Noordzij&rsquo;s analysis of the stroke very helpful in understanding what is possible in terms of the results of manipulation: he helped me to see and understand things in writing. I can understand how, to you, as a scribe, his analysis seems unnecessary and probably a complication of things that are easy or self-evident. But I don&rsquo;t think he is presenting these ideas for the benefit of scribes and calligraphers.</p>

<p>I know what drawing an outline is, and I know how adjusting it in font creation software is done. I also know what marking the boundary of a form— where form and counter form meet — is or amounts to, but I must confess, I don&rsquo;t know what <!-- raw HTML omitted -->designing<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the boundary is.</p>
<p>In drawing an outline or marking and adjusting the boundary of a form (“the black”) I think “the pen” can provide a notional reference axis. This is different than setting up the shapes delivered by the pen as the norm. What I&rsquo;ve been calling norm-violation (vis à vis the pen — systematic, across the character set; or ad hoc, in a glyph-by-glyph manner) I can conceive of as enhancing readability.</p>
<p>To me Legato introduces non-incidental norm-violation of a complex and systematic sort, and I think there is at least a theoretical basis for thinking it enhances readability.</p>

<p>Even Bloemsma started from an imperfect point: Modernism (which

<p>Ideally, we start from the right place: reading. The problem is it&rsquo;s ill-

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Peter, I don&rsquo;t think the notion of &lsquo;norm-violation&rsquo; is very helpful, at least not without the kind of nuance in the interpretation of the words that requires quite a lot of explication. I think it is possible to approach type design in relationship to written forms in a variety of ways without evoking &lsquo;norms&rsquo; or suggesting that some of these ways represent violations. My own approach is to recognise that &ndash; presuming one is designing for a cultural script, i.e. one that has evolved over time in the literary life of communities with particular histories &ndash; almost all scripts have originated in and/or passed through writing, and this process has established the shapes of the signs as expressed by particular tools and movements. Hence, reference to those tools and movements is a legitimate and sensible aspect of typeface design, and what is important here is not that this anchors types to &lsquo;norms&rsquo; of letter shape or stroke modulation but that it anchors them within the script culture.</p>
<p>One of the things that is interesting to me about Legato is just how comfortably it sits within the Latin script culture, despite doing things that would be considered norm-violations in your analysis. I think this comes from the strength of structure &ndash; the sense of a skeleton even though the edge relationships plainly demonstrate that none can exist &ndash; and also the quality and measure of tension in the &ldquo;strokes&rdquo;, which although being differently arrived at is of a similar tenor to that found elsewhere in the line of &lsquo;humanist sans&rsquo; derived from more traditional constructions.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I believe Legato seems to exhibit this paradox
only because our conscious perception of the
existence of &ldquo;skeletons&rdquo; is in effect illusory.
To me Legato in essence proves -or at least
demonstrates- that any expanded-skeleton
approach to type design (chirography being
the pinnacle of this) is an arbitrary constraint,
at least in terms of reading.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I didn&rsquo;t say anything about an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->expanded<!-- raw HTML omitted --> skeleton. What I was talking about is the strong sense of structure, and the fact that even though the edges do not follow a traditional or tool derived relationship there is no sense of structural wobble in Legato. Contrast this with types that attempt a traditional edge relationship but fail because of lack of experience or skill of the designer (the Typophile critique forums have plenty of examples): they&rsquo;re less a &lsquo;norm-violation&rsquo; than Legato, but also less structurally sound because what happens in their edge relationships introduces wobble in the perception of the shapes. This is important, and I think it is key to the success of Legato&rsquo;s systematic approach to edge relationships: even though no writing tool or manipulation can create quite those &lsquo;strokes&rsquo;, one can impose a hairline skeleton on the Legato letters and see that a) it is a strong structural form and b) the relationships of the edges to that skeleton are systematic and consistent. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->They&rsquo;re just not tool based.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Now here is an interesting idea: since the relationship of edges to a structural skeleton in Legato do seem to follow a consistent, systematic approach, would it be possible to algorithmically expand that skeleton to produce these kinds of relationships? That seems to me a practical question that could be practically explored. Why would one bother? Well, it would settle the question of how illusory or not the perception of a skeletal structure in Legato is. What it wouldn&rsquo;t do it settle how important that perception &ndash; illusory or not &ndash; is to the readability of the type. I theorise that it is important because what we recognise in reading &ndash; at text sizes in any case &ndash; is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->shapes<!-- raw HTML omitted --> not edge relationships, and hence edge relationships need to support the perception of shape not undermine it (which is why wobble is a problem).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>John, when I use norm in these contexts, I&rsquo;m not using it in the sense of standard or model (an ‘ought’), but in the sense of conventional pattern (or ‘is’) that has accrued over time. Violation in these contexts is just deviation from that evolved conventional pattern. Any feature manipulation away from a conventional base is norm violation.</p>
<p>My use of the term stems from my reading of Douglas Hofstadter&rsquo;s “Letter Spirit: Esthetic Perception and Creative Play in the Rich Microcosm of the Roman Alphabet” in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies: Computer Models of the Fundamental Mechanisms of Thought<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and papers he did with Gary Mcgraw and John Rehling in the aftermath of his critique of Donald Knuths essay in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Visible Language<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on the Concept of a Metafont.</p>
<p>For Hofstadter, “norm violation is the name of the game in creation.”</p>
<p>I once did an an analysis of Legato on Typophile that shows how, starting from an expansion-with-contrast reduction base (the sans serif), a clever series of norm violations are introduced which have the result of producing a humanistic sans, namely one that approaches the conditions of translation.</p>

<p>I do like what you say about script culture, and that what is remarkable about Legato is just how comfortably it sits within the Latin script culture, despite doing things that I would considered strong norm-violations. What I said about my analysis of Legato provides an elaboration of just that.</p>
<p>In the context of this thread it might be interesting to point out that Bloemsma&rsquo;s vantage point in the introduction of his norm violations is the consideration of how the whites sit inside the black and how they co-relate in the context of the word. The outcome is a distinctive contribution to the consolidation of the word, which is his avowed aim.</p>
