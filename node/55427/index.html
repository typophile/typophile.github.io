		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;ve done pro-bono work for a non-profit association/organization I&rsquo;m a member of. Contributing in &ldquo;my way&rdquo;, and thereby hopefully enhancing the perceived value of their publications/materials, does feel like a good thing to do; and I also really enjoy working with them. But I&rsquo;m an up-starting self-employed designer, and I&rsquo;d be lying if I didn&rsquo;t say a large part of my motivation to donate my time and work has been to get some cool work done where I&rsquo;d have more &ldquo;deciding power&rdquo; / artistic licence than in a usual job, and thus get some references under my belt (and into my portfolio).</p>
<p>I interned as an art director at a smallish ad agency a few years ago and they seemed to handle this in a similar way, FWIW: The few &ldquo;free&rdquo; jobs for friends or benevolent organizations were valued as occasions to really let loose and do some creative work without the pressures of a budget and most of all a nagging client. When you do pro-bono, clients just tend to be grateful.</p>

<p>Its specifically about people doing free work for non-profits &amp; what inspires them to contribute. Any ideas?</p>
<p>More and more, I&rsquo;m finding out in my research that for many, the work is largely self-motivated. This is not necessarily a bad thing because, as @altaira noted, many young designers rely upon this kind of work as a portfolio builder. However, in the project I&rsquo;m proposing&hellip; a group of designers would collaborate on a piece of design work meaning that no singular person really has ownership or creative control over it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to figure out if designers are willing to contribute when the personal gain factor is altered significantly—one stands to gain a really unique and collaborative social experience, rather than the opportunity to have full creative control over a portfolio piece.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I did some work for a gallery associated with the school I graduated from. They opened in the museum district where my wife worked. The museums had a tendency to hire from another school that was in the same city. I thought it might help graduates who wanted placement. I was/am also transitioning into more book design and thought it might be an opportunity. My motivations were mixed.</div>
