    the one on our building, however,  none of them have the original fonts pleasing
    proportions and the two arms and the bar of the E are equal on ours. \r\n\r\nHuzzah
    for Ryuk for alerting me to Liberator for it comes the closest.\r\n\r\nSome specimen
    book must have the whole font!\r\n\r\n "
