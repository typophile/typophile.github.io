  body: I, a Japanese, would recommend you to go to see any shop sign of traditional
    Japanese restaurant (normally printed on cotton material) in terms of calligraphy.

  body: 'Take a walk through a light industrial area. That''s where the true Japanese
    font wonders lie. You''ll find bizarre interpretations our our alphabet, grungy
    kanji stencil fonts and clunky scripts with descenders chopped off. Bonus: slogans
    such as "We love wood and humans!"'

  body: "<em>Bonus: slogans such as \u201CWe love wood and humans!\u201D</em>\r\nBe
    sure to visit a couple of 100 yen stores for those, too:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/surely-use_4718.jpg]\r\n\r\nApart
    from that, just walking around can already be total typographic input overload.
    I second the restaurants \u2013 <a href=\"http://homepage.mac.com/altairas_eye/.Pictures/tokyo03/DSCF0021_1.JPG\">lettershapes
    everywhere</a>, some <a href=\"http://homepage.mac.com/altairas_eye/.Pictures/tokyo06/P1010548.JPG\">beautiful
    calligraphy</a> (and/or <a href=\"http://homepage.mac.com/altairas_eye/.Pictures/tokyo06/P1010538.JPG\">funky
    stuff</a>). But even just <a href=\"http://homepage.mac.com/altairas_eye/.Pictures/tokyo06/P1010515.JPG\">stenciled
    signs</a>, <a href=\"http://homepage.mac.com/altairas_eye/.Pictures/tokyo06/P1010517.JPG\">traffic
    directions painted on streets</a>, or LED signs are just\u2026 amazing. I found
    it especially funky how the different alphabets/scripts are combined and interchanged
    (like <a href=\"http://homepage.mac.com/altairas_eye/.Pictures/tokyo07/P1010677.JPG\">here</a>).\r\n\r\nBTW
    if you're in/near Tokyo, and interested in graffiti: while Tokyo doesn't seem
    to have any really, <a href=\"http://homepage.mac.com/altairas_eye/.Pictures/tokyo07/P1010752.JPG\">Yokohama
    does</a>."
