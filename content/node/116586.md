  body: "Congratulations Michel on finding this unique blackletter. I guess it takes
    the mathematics people to bring legibility to blackletter. Some awkward features,
    but they could easily be adjusted. \r\nNote that the letters and numbers are not
    in the standard locations for a Windows font . For regular use it would best to
    rename them to the standard locations and regenerate the font.\r\nDon"

  body: "If that font is to be used as the mathematical bold fraktur font (unicode
    range 1D56C-1D59F), then it does not meet my requirements; that range is not meant
    for text, it is meant to give individually recognizable mathematical symbols.
    For me the symmetric group on n elements, and the alternating group on n elements
    are represented by\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/groupe_4669.png]\r\nin
    the standard and bold math frak fonts, and making the S and the A looking closer
    to those in regular alphabets is pointless."

  body: "As far as I can see the ID request is in the context of running text.  My
    comments were directed towards that use. Bearing in mind that most persons are
    not be able to match the unique shapes of the fraktur uppercase with the letters
    of the Latin alphabet. \r\nBut I take your point on the unsuitability of this
    font for use as the mathematical bold fraktur font. Anyone using the fraktur symbols
    in a mathematical context would not appreciate their transformation into Latinesque
    forms, which would introduce ambiguity as to meaning.\r\nDon"
