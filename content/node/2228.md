  body: Hi Joaquin, I did a run through the FontBook and Rookledge&#39;s  <BR>International
    Type Finder, but unfortunately I couldn&#39;t find a  <BR>perfect match. <BR>
    <BR>There&#39;s some resemblences with <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=205100"
    target="_blank"> Fiedler Gothic</a> and <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=205468"
    target="_blank"> Neographic</a>,  <BR>but that&#39;s about it. I hope one of our
    local Type Gods can crack  <BR>this ID for you.

    &#40;pretty work safe&#41; <BR> <BR>I guess it could be a custom job. It&#39;s
    not that important. I just like the typeface a lot. <BR> <BR>But hey, if you never
    ask...'
