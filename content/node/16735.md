body: "Hi, I've never been on any type of forum before, but I am looking for some
  help. I'm attempting to translate a book entitled, Medula Mistica by Francisco de
  Santo Thomas. It was written in 1695. I cannot find it on the web. WorldCat shows
  only three copies in the world. One in Washington DC, one in Mexico, and one in
  Chile. I am attempting to purchase or borrow a copy of this book through the Carmelites
  in Washington DC. They photocopied a chapter for me and I have begun attempting
  to translate it. My problem is I am having difficulty reading the font. It appears
  to be in italics and difficult to make out the letters. For example, the letter
  \"s\" when not at the end of the word is in the form of an \"f\" without a crossbar
  through it. When using Microsoft word, in the \"Insert\" \"Symbols\" in the \"Latin
  -Extended A\" is a symbol shaped like this \"f\" without a crossbar. \r\n\r\nAnother
  problem in the print is that the accent marks appear to be just heavy dots instead
  of angled lines. Does anyone happen to have a \"key\" of somekind that would show
  17th century Spanish letters = English letters? Is there such a thing as a 17th
  century font in Spanish.\r\nCan anyone give me some help in translating this?\r\n\r\nThanks,
  \r\nPastor Rick "

  body: "Rick, \r\n\r\nthe \"f without a crossbar\" is called the long s and was commonly
    used in the Latin alphabet until the 18th century, and also later in blackletter.
    \r\nSee: \r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_s\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/unicode/017f/\r\n\r\nIf
    you use Microsoft Word for Windows, you can type it by typing 017f and pressing
    Alt+x after that. You can also assign a keystroke to it using Word's record macro
    function. \r\n\r\nYou did not indicate into which language you are translating.
    Also, I don't quite understand what you mean by a \"key\" that would show 17th
    century Spanish letters vs. English letters. \r\n\r\nRegards, \r\nAdam"

    body: "Hi Adam,\r\n\r\nThanks for your reply. I checked out the links about and
      they are very helpful. I am translating from Spanish to English. And by key
      I mean something like the following for each letter of the alphabet:\r\n\r\nSpanish
      \            = English\r\n(symbol for long s) = s\r\n\r\nIt looks like www.myfonts.com
      might have that somewhere.\r\n\r\nAnything else that you or anyone else might
      offer would be greatly appreciated. \r\n\r\nThanks again, \r\nRick"
