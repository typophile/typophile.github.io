  I've been trying to indentify the font ever since.  Word on the street is that this
  is the place for font identification.  Checking the forum, it very well does appear
  to be the case!\r\n\r\nFor some reason I can't embed the image (File copy failed:
  no directory configured, or it could not be accessed) so I'll link to a photo that
  I found of the tankers, and I'll try to embed it with some html.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/tampics/107748414/\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/oilheatsbest.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nSam"

    painted directly on the tankers. As for digital fonts that are similar to those
    letters, you could try Futura or Century Gothic."

  body: Looks like good old Futura Bold to me (and doesn't it look really nice in
    this setting...)

  body: It <em>looks</em> like Futura Bold, but it's not. Perhaps a sign painter's
    interpretation of it, though.

  body: 'Ha! I pass this every time I visit my son in New York City. It is on the
    exit 14 connector from the Jersey Turnpike into the city. Every time I pass it
    I scream out FIX THE A! They didn''t know to taper the diagonals so the counter
    of the A is big enough. --Of course I get the indulgent ''Dad the type nut'' looks.   '

  body: "William!\r\nHa Ha! I pass these guys almost daily. I don't insult the A out-loud,
    although I do repeat it as a mantra in my head. It may need some kerning as-well
    but I like seeing letters that large. If you read them in the order in which they
    appear, as street floor signs are read ( stay in lane is written \"lane\" then
    \"in\" and then \"stay\") then it read \"Oil Heats Best\" which is a nice subliminal."

  body: "Thanks guys.  I thought it had to be a custom font, but I'm not schooled
    enough in signage to know if that's always the case with giganto lettering like
    this.  \r\n\r\nIt does look similar to Futura and Century Gothic (particularly
    Futura Extra Bold), but the differences intrigue me.  Particularly the B and the
    O.  Any other suggestions for similar fonts?  I'm looking to copy the B and O
    for a font I'm using for a film title. BRUNO is the title and right now we're
    using Futura Extra Bold, but it looks a little too \"goofy\" and is very very
    overused in the film industry (Wes Anderson and Kubrick particularly LOVE IT).\r\n\r\nThanks
    again,\r\nSam"
