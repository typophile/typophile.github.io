  inspiration for a project I have lined up in the new year. I'm not necessarily looking
  for sites on typography, but sites that make interesting use of type and typography
  built into the interface. This might include portfolio sites for type designers,
  type foundries, or book designers, etc., but also sites for non-typographic subjects
  that use type in an interesting way. I know this is very vague, but after visiting
  my regular list of web inspiration showcases I'm getting tired of frilly graphic
  design & fancy-schmancy Flash/CSS bragging and am looking to absorb some understated
  and clean layouts that use type and typographic principles and \"iconography\" well."

    quest, I'm actually looking more for interesting use of type and typographic principle
    in the interface itself; think 1998-2002 when designers weren't quite so XHTML/CSS
    Standards-driven and were doing interesting things graphically with type. (I'm
    not, of course, saying XHTML/CSS Standards should be disregarded, just that they've
    become the goal rather than the tools.)\r\n\r\nWhile I'm all for massive restraint
    and understatement in my book work, the internet is its own animal and should,
    I think, utilize it's wide range of opportunity, rather than attempt to simulate
    newspaper/magazine/book layout & design. I'm not suggesting websites should revert
    to the visual chaos of graphic pomp so popular not so long ago, but the current
    trend to pure CSS text in sleek perfect columns on white backgrounds is beginning
    to bore me to sleep. So, with that rant in place, any other suggestions?"

  body: "Alessandro,\r\n\r\nI'll take your post gratefully at face value in that you've
    not taken offense to my comments, which had nothing to do with accomplishment
    or even taste, but simply with objective. My remark as to \"opposites\" had only
    to do with setting up a binary: not of \"good\" and \"bad,\" but instead \"this\"
    and not \"that.\" The problem, of course, is that I have no \"this\" to hold up
    as example.\r\n\r\nAs you mention, \"appropriacy\" is indeed the topic at issue,
    in that I'm searching for inspiration in order to help me determine the appropriate
    approach to a project on the horizon, and that project is to present the topic
    of typography in the medium of a website. To my mind, this hasn't been done to
    its potential, and so obviously that's my goal. I have no illusions about accomplishing
    that goal, but it's a goal regardless. To add to this task is the fact that I've
    brought it up here, in a community of well-educated and experienced typographers,
    which exposes me to all kinds of \"pressure.\" But that's rather beside the point.
    I have a project in mind and I'm seeking input/guidance. This puts me in a position
    to be critically judged if/when the project comes to light, and I'm grateful for
    the opportunity. Maybe I'll crash and burn, who knows. But each project is a challenge
    and boils down to this: accept the consequences and do, or fear the consequences
    and do nothing. So I'll do, with the help of others' advice, and if it all comes
    to crap, well, then I've discovered one more route to crap which I can perhaps
    avoid in the future.\r\n\r\nI also appreciate your comments on the philosophical
    connection to technical work. Mathematicians have long discussed the spiritual/philosophical
    component of their efforts, and it seems to me that the same inhabits this sort
    of thing as well: <em>connection</em>. I tell my students all the time that there's
    little more exciting than watching as they grow into code, to find the pattern
    in the chaos and suddenly \"see\" what they're doing. To see the connectedness
    of every character they type (be it literary or technical). This is trivial, of
    course, as metaphor, but it is not, of course, simply a metaphor. A broken HTML
    link to a CSS stylesheet crumbles a website. The wrong word in a delicate simile
    crumbles a poem. A broken link from practical every-day action to some sense of
    larger order or system crumbles a life. This is the dilemma. It's not a matter
    of designing a website. It's finding the appropriate method to express an experience.
    Lofty as all get-out, and pretentious to boot, but it's what we all do every day,
    if we do what we do without fear of the consequences."

    lately is the dismissing of everything <em>but</em> CSS. It's the new kid on the
    block (not so new anymore, really) and so lots of folks are jumping to be the
    purest of the pure, and it's getting a bit tired. Cameron's site has some nice
    qualities, but to me they're found in the site's textures and depth-of-field (amazing
    what a simple drop-shadow can do to make the \"page\" pop off the background).
    The typography there seems well done, but ironically I find it a bit over-done,
    a bit busy at times (there's a lot of emphasizing going on in the main column,
    and that side bar needs some leading, etc.).\r\n\r\nAs for this thread, the OurType
    site is still the closest to what I had in mind, but all of the other suggestions
    have been helpful in the search for points of reference. It's not at all that
    I'm planning to design a site that looks anything at all like OurType, but simply
    that I've been most inspired by that site so far. That site, more than the others,
    has got my motor runnin'. I'd love to comment on some of the other suggestions,
