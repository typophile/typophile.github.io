  body: "Interesting idea, a swirly font that combines a swirl with a ball terminal
    at one end and a plain swirl at the other end. Here are two fonts that give you
    your choice of these two effects. Janda Hide And Seek http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/kimberly-geswein/janda-hide-and-seek/
    and Emploi http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/emploi/ Emploi might be more
    to your taste than Janda Hide And Seek. If you can tinker with fonts Emploi could
    be edited to give it balls where you want them.\r\nDon"
