  think a modern art director just invented it for show? The quote itself is real,
  I have no doubt. \r\n\r\nI find it fascinating how this was displayed typographically,
  especially the pointing hand, just in case the reader didn't notice the blaring
  screed. And the fact that word \"the\" (enlarged below) is the most decorative.\r\nThoughts?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/womens-votes-7i_4735.jpg]"

    but given how bad American political design is, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to
    find that something so hideous did exist. But until someone shows me the original
    I\u2019ll file this under \u201Chalfassed work somebody did for a non-profit.\u201D"

  body: It's hypocritical to say they don't make this stuff up, when the typography
    is so bogus.
