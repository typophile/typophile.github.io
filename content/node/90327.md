  body: "Oooh. A type excursion to Korea huh?\r\n\r\nI was in Seoul last year doing
    research for my dissertation and visited a number of typographic locations you
    might be interested in going to. I have to say, I didn't go to any of the places
    you mentioned\u2014please let me know if they're worth going to sometime. \r\n\r\nIn
    any case, depending on what you're interested there's some great spots:\r\n\r\n[[http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_1_1_1.jsp?cid=797950|Cheongju
    Early Printing Museum]]: Not in Seoul, but Cheongju. Has a deep collection of
    early printed matter and documents techniques used for early printing. I really
    liked it. \r\n\r\n[[http://www.hangeultium.co.kr|Tium Hangeul Museum]]: Located
    in Heyri Art village (an hour bus from Seoul). Great little museum all about hangeul
    and various means of typesetting it. Owned and run by the CEO of Sandoll. While
    there, visit the Rural Life museum (which had a marvellous collection of old textbooks
    & ephemera) and the Chocolate house (which had one of the most delicious hot chocolates
    ever).\_\r\n\r\nPaju Book City: On the same bus route to Heyri. Though this city
    is the home of many publishers in Korea, it wasn't at all clear how to explore
    the collections nor the library supposedly on site. Of particular note, though,
    is a letterpress studio with full CJK character set and all the matrices needed
    to produce more metal type. You have to see this place to believe it. But they
    don't speak any English at all (made asking questions fun). Michael Green showed
    some pictures of it in [[http://www.gtfoundry.com/?p=125|this post]] (toward the
    bottom).\r\n\r\nSejong Statue: Out in front of the imperial palace there's a monument
    to [[http://www.exploringkorea.com/king-sejong-statue/|King Sejong]]. Go around
    back and down the stairs into the special Sejong exhibit underground. Has original
    documents of some of the really important Hangeul documents from the 1400s and
    various highlights of Sejong's career. The Singijeon (rocket arrows) was pretty
    cool, but in general there wasn't much of interest to me besides the old books
    (I knew all of Hangeul's History already).\_\r\n\r\n[[http://www.ssmop.org/index_e.htm|Samseong
    Museum of Publishing]]: Small little place, not a ton of interesting documents,
    but it has rotating exhibits.\r\n\r\n[[http://english.seoul.go.kr/gtk/news/reports_view.php?idx=1242&|Modern
    Design Museum]]: Smallish, but pretty cool little museum. Some lovely old documents
    including one of the first Hangeul newspapers. No photos allowed tho, sadly, and
    no museum exhibit book. Boo.\r\n\r\nOther than these, just wander around the neighbourhoods
    and you'll find all sorts of exciting lettering on signage and such. I look forward
    to going back!\r\n\r\nHope that is useful to you. Let me know if I can help more!"

  body: "It's especially helpful to hear from someone who's been there personally.
    I've been to 'museums' which turned out to be little more than an enthusiast's
    personal collection. Not diminishing those types of collections in any way, but
    it's helpful to know what to expect.\r\n\r\nHa. I wish I could call this a type
    excursion, but it's really a holiday with my wife & friends. Just trying to put
    together as much information as possible so I can prioritize. Thanks for the tips!\r\n\r\nJust
    found out about Bosu-dong Book Street in Busan. Looks interesting.\r\n\r\n<img
