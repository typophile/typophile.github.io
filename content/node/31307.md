  posted a little story about a few of them on my blog:\r\n\r\nhttp://designdrivethru.typepad.com/design_drivethru/2007/02/helvetica_the_t.html\r\n\r\nI'm
  sure there are other examples and I'd like to do a follow-up story in a couple of
  weeks.\r\nDoes anyone know of other fabrics with type designs?\r\nThanks for any
  ideas....\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Typo Trivia (slightly off-topic) - which type designer said... \r\n\r\n\"Sometimes
    I wish my career was more involved with disciplines that generate tangible items,
    like designing textiles, clothing, or shoes. I find it difficult to find good-looking
    shoes that are comfortable. I often pick up a comfortable shoe and think, if they
    had just done this or that differently, I\u2019d wear it.\"\r\n\r\nIn Cheshire
    Dave solidarity Google may not be used to find the answer. ;-)"

    typographical, put it on the chosen fabric, and voila!

  body: I have some balck & white Marimekko duvet covers and pillow cases designed
    by  Marjaana Virta. The pattern is the alphabet painted with a brush. I think
    they made some clothes from the material, too. Unfortunately I can't find a picture
    of it.
