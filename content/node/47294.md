  body: 'Ricardo, have you tried making the ''spurs'' on the TE etc less wide than
    the stems? I don''t know if that will be better or worse, but it would be worth
    trying, if you haven''t already. '

    tried that yet, and I agree that it's worth a shot."

  body: "UPDATE: William, I tried your suggestion and I liked it. Plus, you made me
    go back and look more closely at the sources I was using. Thanks again! It's a
    subtle change (at least in the condensed weight!), but I think it works. Here
    are two before-and-after comparisons.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/beforeafter_samp2_4110.gif]\r\n\r\nIn
    making the \"spurs\" narrower, I was forced to open up some of the counters...
    I don't think the difference is negligible (see sample below), but FontStruct
    has certain limitations.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/beforeafter_samp1_3523.gif]"

  body: I *do* like the first one better. The second one is a bit "tame" IMHO.

  body: You liked the bolder look, Jos? I'm having trouble making up my mind, to tell
    you the truth! For now I will keep the thinner spurs, and I am already working
    on the Regular weight. Once that's done I'll post some images.

    one far better. It feels more robust and balanced to me."

  body: Thanks for your comments, Jos. Once I have the Regular weight finished I'll
    try different widths of spurs again.
