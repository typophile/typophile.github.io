body: "hello,\r\n\r\n...\r\nbecause its my first one, the font istn a really specific
  one,\r\nbut it should be good readable in small sizes (9-12pkt) with\r\na dynamic
  character and maybe intressting glyphs.\r\n\r\nthere are 2 versions of the font.
  the one try to keep similar\r\ncontures. (for headlines)\r\nthe second one works
  with a little diagonal (renaissance-antiqua?)\r\ncontrast, but i think i must re-form
  the contur more clean. (for small sizes)\r\n\r\nthanks for any help\r\n\r\n*Update
  font\r\n*last update\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n*Update with Caps II\r\n\r\nMaybe some one
  has the experience to say something about the stroke relation from caps and symbols
  and small glyphs. I am not conten with the cap \"y\" and \"X\" because they look
  real creepy, maybe toi narrow.\r\ni hope i've create the classic-antiqua contrast
  as good as i can to all glyphs.\r\nTracking and the space between the extra symbols
  would be the next work to do.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nOk, another version with caps and
  cap-numbers. but i have to track the numbers.\r\ni need a good print out, that i
  can see maybe more details to repair.\r\nplease comment again (in front of older
  versions)\r\n\r\nthanks again"

  body: Not bad; very good for a first typeface. I noticed a few things though; the
    contours for your ligatures need merging as you can see the subtle lines from
    the individual glyph overlaps. Also the "v", "w" and "7" look a little out of
    place (it might be just me though) and the "t" is missing that nice subtle accentuation
    (or pointy tip) which is visible on the other glyphs. It would be nice to see
    some written sentences as part of your sample to see how the glyphs act together
    naturally.

  body: "Hi Oli,\r\n\r\ngood start - I personally prefer the second one with the more
    diagonal contrast (with a revision of the contours, as you said). I think the
    diagonal contrast in page 2 goes much better with your dynamic letter shapes.
    Some of your numerals stick out too much, more precisely 2, 3, 4 and 7 (the shapes
    got worse in the second page - I\u2019m sure it\u2019s but a result of hasty contrast
    modification ;) )\r\nThe \u201CBogen\u201D of your r looks too thin, as if it
    was a cut \u201Cn\u201D it has to be thicker to match the other glyphs. But as
    Domenico said, some written sentences would be nice for a better comparison.\r\n\r\nKeep
    it up!\r\n\r\nJ\xF6rg"

  body: "ok,\r\n\r\nthanks at first!\r\n\r\ni know that i have to merge the ligas,
    i just let them open because its better to work with them.\r\ni dont understand
    the thing with the ''t'', the left side of the arm is missing because i tried
    to write the glyph without crossing lines (like ''f'' but not the 4).\r\n\r\nthe
    second one is my favorite too, its very hard to form a contrast out off a optical
    similar contured font :). maybe thats why some part in some glyphs are destroyed
    by the ''effect''. I dont have any idea how to do it better way then: rotate 30\xB0,
    bold, turn back and correct manual...?\r\nany one knows tips, how can i do it
    better and also control better.\r\n\r\ni will upload a few text parts in english
    [there are no ''versal''-glyphs, so it is equal wether for english or german text).\r\ni
    hope my spacing is no that bad, i tried to keep rules, but some combinations look
    misserable without kerning and i won't kern at the beginning.\r\nmaybe know help\r\n\r\nat
    last. can someone tell me his opinion about the g (the classic one)? which type
    would you prefer?\r\n\r\nthanks again, i will work on this version and follow
    all tips\r\n\r\noli"

  body: "Sorry, what I meant about the \"t\" was that it was missing that little bit
    that runs off the end of the straight lines which create the stems of the glyphs,
    almost like the subtlest serif. It recurs throughout most of the font and the
    \"t\", in my opinion, should have it too.\r\n\r\nI personally prefer the modern
    \"g\", it somehow blends into the general style better than the classical counterpart.
    And also, there's something interesting about the third Eszett (I hope I got the
    name right); I like it.\r\n\r\nI like the new sample, spacing after the punctuation
    marks does look a little big, although the top right sample block looks good.
    I hate to be a pain, but a sample of some sentences or pangrams in the same size
    as the first (or just a little smaller) sample glyphs would be nice. The new sample
    is very good as it focuses on legibility in big chunks of small text but glyph
    style and consistency is more important at the moment to master first."

    also have correct some glyphs like ''t'' an ''r'', think already.\r\n\r\n-many
    creepy glyphs ( in contrast version ) like ''3'' and ''4'' are just product of\r\n
    the effekt and i have also to align the curves and vector-points to one pattern.\r\n
    (next time i will also ''clean the contrast'' -> has anybody a tip?!)\r\n\r\n-the
    ''2'' and ''7'' now are older (but i think better) versions, with straigth lines.\r\n\r\n\r\nplease
    feedback, maybe someone see more details,\r\ni worked for few month an my eyes
    cant select anymore every detail :)\r\n\r\nohh: possibly the forum can awnser
    also some generalquestions-\r\n\r\nspaceing: \r\nfor what size will be fonts space
    generally? what is the size i have to look at right spacing ( without influencing
    of quark or indesign? )\r\n\r\nligatures:\r\n(to the point below) i can influence
    the tracking if a font, but what happend to ligatures if i track the font very
    ''open'' or very tight? do they broke? \r\n\r\nalternates:\r\ni have some few
    alternative glyphs, and i already have command the option that i can change a
    glyph set with another one (SALT). but how can i scipt a command to have more
    versions of alternatives (3 or 4 alternate sets? maybe?). can i create a 3class
    and what must i type in the ot-window\r\n\r\nmy command looks like:\r\n\r\nfeature

    \r\n\r\n>how can i scipt a command to have more versions of alternatives (3 or
    4 alternate sets\r\n\r\nSounds like you need to use Stylistic sets rather than
    alternates. You can have up to 20 sets I think. Define ss01, ss02, ss03 and ss04;
    you can put as many sets and features as you like into a stylistic set, I think.\r\n\r\n>what
    happend to ligatures if i track the font very ''open'' or very tight? do they
    broke? \r\n\r\nI don't think there's anything you can do about that; the software
    should handle that sort of thing.\r\n\r\nI wonder if you should add some definition
    to the ears of g and r. k looks narrow. \r\n\r\nKeep going with this. I'm not
    going to crit much for now as I think you should find your own preferred direction,
    but you'll need to pick a point size and optimise everything for that size, printing,
    testing and tweaking until it looks perfect. There's not a quick way to do that
    ;)\r\n\r\nMy advice would be to draw the caps and numerals \u2014 you'll probably
    find you need to make different sorts of design decisions as you go.\r\n\r\n:)"

  body: "If your going for legibility you should make the horizontal stroke in the
    f and t continue like it does in moest fonts. Furthermore, your g is a bit condensed
    and thereby to dark, Make it just a little bit wider. Maybe your Q stands out
    a bit to much for text purposes. It's probably better to make the current Q an
    alternate and make a new 'normal' one. I have to say I'm impressed. Especially
    if this your first font. Could you have a look at my 'Expletus Sans'?\r\n\r\nJasper
