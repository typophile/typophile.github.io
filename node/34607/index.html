<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>What makes a letter a that letter? How far can you bend it before it's no longer recognizable? I know it's a basic question of type design, since there are only so many ways to draw an "a" or any other letter. (or are there?) I've wondered how it works not only for Roman letters, but for Greek, Cyrillic and Chinese.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Tobias Frere-Jones made an alphabet out of a very limited number of component shapes.
And then there's Slang Gothic, with the glyphs pretending to be letters they're not.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Brad, this fascinating and central question is not
really answerable, at least not yet, not empirically.
But one thing I did during the first TypeCon in
'98 was give a talk about my Trajic notRoman font:
http://www.themicrofoundry.com/ss_trajic.html _
During the talk I flashed images of the glyphs and
asked for quick letter identification. Very informal
and not rigorous at all, but the results -as well as the
process- I think were interesting to the audience.
They were certainly interesting to me!
One other thing: Alfred Kallir has surmised that each
letter has "acrocratic" features, which give it its being.
Presumably these are what can be bent the least.
Our Peter Enneson knows a lot about this stuff - do ask for his insights.

<div class=commentbody>What complicates this is that context plays a large part in a letter's identity. So if you play with the shape of an 'A' in isolation, you're nowhere near testing the limits of what can read as an 'A'. The exact same shape can be clearly one letter in one typeface and clearly a different letter in another.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Is the font meant to be read, or just to "look different." I am reminded of those old Fillmore West posters of the 60s, with the "groovy" lettering. There is no problem reading these. First you take a hit of LSD, and then wait until the poster becomes readable. (Of course, without the LSD, the things are impossible to decipher.)
> How far can you bend it before it's no longer recognizable?
Exactly that far, and not a bit more. In fact, you are probably smart to back off a good chunk from where it is no longer recognizable to you. The artist often has a different vision of his creation than a casual viewer. As in:
"Why Billy, that's a great picture of a cow."
"Daddy, don't be silly. It's a picture of Mommy."</div>
