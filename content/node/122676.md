body: "I am a historian, and not an expert in fonts, but I am frustrated. I am looking
  for an English font that has the equivalent phonetic letters to Arabic letters.
  Eg. A heavy T with a dot under it, a dhall or d with a line through it, etc. Is
  there a font similar to Garamond (for publishing purposes) that has all of these
  characters?  \r\n\r\nEG: Sa\u2019\u012Bd Ibn \u1E24usayn changes his title to Im\u0101m
  \u2019Abid All\u0101h al-Mahd\u012B Bill\u0101h.\r\n\r\nI find myself using multiple
  fonts to find all of the different characters I need. Is there one font that has
  them all? Perhaps an Arabic font that contains them? I prefer to purchase it so
  that I can use it regularly. \r\n\r\nI am currently inquiring about Brills new font,
  which seems brilliant, but not available for commercial use... ie they do not want
  any competitors using it.  Any suggestions anyone?\r\n\r\nDan Gibson"
