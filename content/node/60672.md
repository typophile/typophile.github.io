  charged with doing up a project for the Kidney Foundation of Canada, and they'd
  like some additional messages on their product. I'd like, if at all possible, to
  match the type of whatever their slogan is set in; the unfortunate part is, I can't
  seem to tell what font that would be. WhatTheFont recommended Font Bureau's Relay
  Light Italic, but it's not a 100% match.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wtf_5181.jpg]\r\n\r\nAny
  and all help is greatly appreciated!"
