  <BR>Come to find out, it&#39;s just another Design Flag being raised by Designers
  from Utah, in this case Provo. <BR> <BR>What exactly is in the water in Utah? <BR>
  <BR>Somebody please elaborate. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    Alias, Device and Adobe fonts &#43; some selected designs by others going to a
    customer base of 30,000. It might be worth checking out for type designers looking
    for more distribution. <BR> <BR>Technical point: don&#39;t know whether any of
    their contributors are based in Utah or whether they use solely freelancers, but
    their mailing address is Provo. <BR>:&#93; <BR> <BR>bj '

    good. Somehow they always attract  <BR>interesting speakers, many of whom don&#39;t
    work in  <BR>Utah. I think they lure them with the skiing/boarding. <BR>:-&#41;
    <BR> <BR>When I first got to New York after finishing at  <BR>BYU my new employer
    asked me what  <BR>Provo was like. She believed it was teeming  <BR>with designers
    and a very hip place. I felt like I  <BR>was deflating her grand impressions when
    I  <BR>explained that Provo is a typical town that grew  <BR>up around a University.
    <BR> <BR>BYU&#39;s design program left me feeling very well  <BR>prepared. They
    don&#39;t offer any type design  <BR>courses but there&#39;s a definite emphasis
    on  <BR>typographic integrity and a sensitivity toward  <BR>type that really sparked
    my interest. <BR> <BR>Oh, and BJ, if you ask any more questions you  <BR>may wake
