  were not mapped (and so they didn't appear in the character map in Windows and I
  wasn't able to use them).\r\n\r\nTo fix this, I opened up FontLab and spent countless
  hours mapping each glyph to the appropriate unicode.\r\n\r\nI recreated the font,
  but now when I install it and try to open the character map, it crashes.\r\n\r\nSo
  does every other program when I try to use my new font.\r\n\r\nHow can I even BEGIN
  to figure out what is wrong?\r\n\r\nJamal\r\n\r\nPS - I no longer have fontlab,
  but I can provide anyone willing to help with the font files (.ttf, .vfb, .bak)"

    I created my new font as both TT and OT, available here with the .Bak and .VFB
    files:\r\nhttp://www.esentials.net/JamalsFont.rar\r\n\r\nFinal bit of info:\r\nWhen
    I open up the character map, it can load the first few glyphs, but when I try
    to scroll down, it crashes!\r\n\r\nThanks"
