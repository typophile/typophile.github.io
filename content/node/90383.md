body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI don't have access to a windows machine, and need some clarifications
  on the need for digital signatures for fonts to work correctly in some versions
  of windows.\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that it is necessary for a DSIG table to
  be present for windows to recognise OpenType fonts. However, some sites have suggested
  that this is only necessary for .ttf files. If I am generating CFF-flavoured fonts
  with an .otf extension, can I safely dispense with this table and still have the
  font work in a windows environment?\r\n\r\nIf the answer to the above question is
  'no', will inserting a zero-length DSIG table using TTX suffice, or do I need to
  include some dummy data in the table?\r\n\r\nAlso, does anyone know why microsoft
  imposes this weird restriction on opentype fonts?\r\n\r\nTIA,\r\nAndr\xE9"

    as video & DVD players, lets take just show just a few major differences. Firstly,
    the GHD IV Styler has almost nothing realistic competition. The GHD IV styler
    is widely regarded for a consumer and high end (hairdressers) while the number
    1 hair styling tool.Secondly, as techniology developes the money necessary production
    reduces thus retail prices reduce. Well my answer suggestions that GHD haven\u2019t
    handed over, any reduction in production costs with the retailer (salon owners).
    In fact cost prices have gone up resulting from <a href=\"http://www.louisvuittonpursebag.com/\"><strong>louis
    vuitton bags</strong></a>  a surge in the RRP. Here we are at in the event the
    GHD MK1 to <a href=\"http://www.coachfactoryoutleti.org/\"><strong>coach factory
    outlet</strong></a>  Mk3 were discounted one of the a RRP of ??99, the actual
    MK4 GHD styler provides a RRP of ??119.</P><P></P><P>Exactly what continues to
    be lowering the retail prices? The result we have found simple. Online competition,
    with online retailer endeavoring to out do eath other ghd hair straightener for
    being the lowest priced website for GHD IV Styler . I personally, work at a hairdressing
    salon <a href=\"http://www.coachoutletonlinepicke.com/\"><strong>coach outlet
    online</strong></a>  and i know which price range of GHD IV Styler. Despite that
    these web based stores receive massive discounts on there products, they could
    still merely be making between <a href=\"http://www.coachoutletonline-bag.com/\"><strong>coach
    outlet online</strong></a>  ??6-8 a hard and fast and perhaps any loss. I possed
    this with a senior GHD worker from a GHD event in the year. Her response, was
    which she believed, people were with their company as loss leaders to operate
    individuals to there sites. In the hope they retain the prospect for <a href=\"http://www.buyscoachoutletonline.net/\"><strong>coach
    outlet online</strong></a>  future purchases of hair & bath and body goods.I cannot
    really buy into this theory.Lots of individuals will for sure invest in a straightners
    without additional shampoos and styling products. So, i\u2019m not really really
    sure the way this works, in the form of long-term business strategy. The very
    first thing for several though, would be that the consumer might be gaining from
    these reduced prices. </P><P></P><P>In order <a href=\"http://www.coachpurseoutletss.net/\"><strong>cheap

    about Britney Spears and her hair disasters are not uncommon, but was damage to

    if there is a DSIG. It can be a dummy (null) DSIG, but it's gotta be there. The
    CFF flavour is accepted without question.

    script in TTF-flavoured fonts if they don't contain a DSIG table, also Windows
    explorer will show the font with an OpenType icon if it has such table. This was
    not needed for CFF-flavoured fonts last time I checked.

    On TT-flavoured fonts, the OT icon appeared only on fonts with a DSIG. To me,
    this indicated that what I stated above. If they didn't have a DSIG, WinXP showed
    them to be plain old TrueType.\r\n\r\nAs it happens, the difference between a
    TrueType font and a TT-flavoured OpenType font is pretty damn small. The OT font
    has some OT tables and a different version setting, and that's about it. So why
    would WinXP latch onto the DSIG as an indicator? Beats all hell outta me."

    the beginning of this section, I referred to the DSIG table as a 'required' table.
    In fact, a digital signature is not required in the same sense that the CMAP and
    many other tables are required simply for the font to work. A font without a DSIG
    table will work, but it will not be recognized as an OpenType font by the Windows
    operating system. Because the OpenType format is an extension of the TrueType
    format, and most of the new tables are optional, Windows makes a distinction between
    the two formats based solely on the presence or absence of a DSIG table. A font
    with a DSIG table will be recorded in the Windows font folder as an OpenType font
    and presented with the OpenType icon.</dd></dl>\r\nOk, it is old, 2001, but still

    MS / Adobe event in the mid-90s, it was postured as protection for font vendors.
    Through discussion, however, it was determined to actually be protection for users
    from dangerous fonts. At the time, MS expressed the desire for all documents,
    and all other content running on or through windows to have a digital signature,
    and fonts seemed like the perfect place to start."

    issue for Windows in determining what constitutes an OpenType font, as distinct
    from a TrueType font, inititally for cosmetic purposes (icon presentation) and
    legal purposes (trademark), was confused by the fact that all the OpenType Layout
    tables are optional, and all the common sfnt tables needed to be backwards compatible.
    So Microsoft decided to define a TTF-flavour OpenType font as an sfnt with a OT
    DSIG table. It's an odd decision that has confused people ever since, including,
    apparently, the Word 2010 programmers."
