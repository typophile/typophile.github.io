  to create a [[Cufon]] format font. Upon opening the resulting .js file in a text
  editor I noticed that the font's (c) and trademark strings didn't come across. Anyone
  know if that's a limitation on the font format or if it's possible to paste in these
  strings?\r\n\r\nCheers, Si \r\n"

    case.\r\n\r\nIn your Photoshop example, the font data has been utilized (not \"opened
    up\" btw), as provided, to perform as it was licensed to do: to render letterforms.
    The user is then free to do as he wishes with the fixed, rendered form; just like
    printing.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Cuf\xF3n\" example (I'm using this as representative,
    not to pick on Cuf\xF3n specifically), the font data itself is being materially
    modified to perform differently. Such a modification of the software data itself
    is a derivation under copyright and one needs permission from the intellectual
    property owner to do so.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the general license of most foundries
    does not grant this permission off-the-shelf. So, developers need to ask first.
    Some foundries may grant that permission, some may not. That's their right. Some
    may want additional fees, some may not. That's also their right.\r\n\r\nIf you
    can't come to terms, then you'll take your business elsewhere. I realize you hate
    having to jump through that hoop. The technologies and markets are still emerging.
    It will take a while to sort out.\r\n\r\nThere may come a day when the permission
    to make these modifications becomes incorporated as a de facto part of a standard
    license. I get that that's what you'd like to see happen. But we aren't there

    so your license does not allow your fonts to be used with Cuf\xF3n, right? That's
    perfectly fine. But there's always going to be someone who does it anyway, and
    the \"EULA allows this\" checkbox is pretty much all we can do about it. In cases
    like this, would you rather not have your copyright embedded to the font files
    at all?\r\n\r\nWhat do you count as modification anyway? Even Abode Flash slightly
    modifies the curves of embedded fonts by converting them to quadratic ones (see
    \"Converting TrueType fonts to SWF glyphs\", page 172 of http://www.adobe.com/devnet/swf/pdf/swf_file_format_spec_v10.pdf).
    Now, Cuf\xF3n obviously takes things a bit further by allowing the user to scale
    the font down and optimize the path after that for the purpose of decreasing file
    size, but this functionality can be turned off. After that it's not much different
    from what Flash does. The curves are just converted to cubic beziers and stored
    in VML format.\r\n\r\nFrom the SWF spec:\r\n\r\n\"The complete procedure for converting
    TrueType glyphs to SWF glyphs is as follows:\r\n<ol><li>Negate the y-coordinate.
    (In TrueType glyphs, the y-axis points up; in SWF glyphs, the y- axis points down.)</li>\r\n<li>Scale
    the x and y co-ordinates from the EM square of the TrueType font, to the EM square
    of the SWF glyph (always 1024).</li>\r\n<li>Insert an on-curve (anchor) point
    at the midpoint of each pair of off-curve points.\"</li></ol>\r\n\r\nSo actually
    Flash scales things too. Both Cuf\xF3n and Flash do 1. They both also do 2, although
    this can be turned off in Cuf\xF3n. The 3rd point is different but the purpose
    is the same. So, they're not that much different after all.\r\n\r\nIt would be
    interesting to find out whether PDFs also do something like this.\r\n\r\nSimo"

    - with regards to a work protected by copyright - to not create derivative works
    to include sub-setting that work into parts?\r\n\r\n3) Lastly - and this is a
    real world scenario I recently ran into:\r\n\r\nA font is obtained under a totally
    free and open license. (No doubt about this. Unequivocal EULA included and the
    source verified.) But in order to use it as a web font, you need to convert it
    into an EOT. However the EOT converter software won't convert a file that has
    the embedding bit set to restricted. And, it seems, the embedding bit on said
    font has been set to Restricted by mistake.\r\nIs it then OK to just change the
    embedding bit, and think no more about it?\r\n\r\nBTW - As I've noted elsewhere
    on Typophile, Cuf&oacute;n does not make use of or rely on hinting data. A font
    like Whitman, used decoratively or for headings, would probably look outstanding.
    But the Cuf&oacute;n converter will have to \"utilize\" the font so that it can
    appear, in the browser, in it's ultimate \"fixed, rendered form\".\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nrich\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    to font files? By law I have to have some regardless of what any EULA might say
    and I was just wondering what you thought those might be.</em>\r\n\r\nIn US law,
    as I understand it, fair use rights are determined by a balancing test, which
    is a judicial process. So rather than the usual disclaimer that I'm not a lawyer,
    in this case I should point out that I'm not a jurist.\r\n\r\nWith explicit judicial
    ruling regarding fair use of font files, you have to look at fair use for similar
    copyright material. Since fonts are copyrighted as software, the most obvious
    place to start looking is fair use of copyrighted and commercially licensed software.
    Now, a lot of software licenses explicitly forbid decompiling the software, which
    applied to fonts would prevent font format conversions or any tinkering inside
    the font as a font; even opening such a font in FontLab to take a look at it would
    constitute license infringement. Frankly, I would be surprised if you could make
    a case that decompiling software is fair use if the license disallows it, even
    if you do not do anything more with the software, but I'm not aware of case law
    relating to this.\r\n\r\nIf we presume a font license does not explicitly disallow
    decompiling the font binary, what fair use rights might exist? Given that distributing
    a derivative work is contrary to the whole purpose of copyright, I doubt if any
    balancing test would permit that. So the question is probably whether you have
    a fair use right to modify the font for your own purposes, and to use the resulting
    derivative work but not to distribute it or use it beyond the scope of the original
    license. There are, of course, plenty of font licenses that explicitly <em>permit</em>
    such modification of fonts; but there are others that explicitly disallow it,
    that require you to go back to the font maker if you want a custom version even
    for your own use. So I read your question as 'Are such license prohibitions enforceable,
    or is that a fair use right to modify fonts?' Again, you'd have to look at the
    general state of software copyright first, and then more specific case law and,
    for a final decision, get a judicial balancing test decision on fonts per se."

    that topic.\r\n\r\nI will state that I am not a lawyer (even if I begin to sound
    like one) and none of my comments should be construed as legal advice. Also, I
    am not offering any official interpretation of licenses for any foundries that
    I might work with. I am just giving my personal opinions.\r\n\r\nI will assume,
    as John has, that for the sake of this discussion we are talking about the U.S.
    Copyright Law, which is contained in Title 17 of the United States Code. \r\n\r\nAnyone
    is welcome to read it for themselves. The full text of the law can be found here:
    http://www.copyright.gov/title17/index.html and can be downloaded as Circular
    92.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of \"fair use\" is outlined in \xA7107 -- Limitations
    on Exclusive Rights: Fair Use. It gives the principles for possible exceptions
    to the rights stated in \xA7106.\r\n\r\nSo, before we delve into fair use let's
    just review that \xA7106 of the Copyright Code secures to the owner of copyright
    the exclusive right to do (and to authorize others to do) a couple different things:
    [I'm paraphrasing here]\r\n\r\n(1) Reproduce the work in copies; \r\n(2) Prepare
    derivative works based upon the copyrighted work; \r\n(3) Distribute copies of
    the work by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending;
    \r\n(plus a few others that pertain only to other media, primarily visual and
    performing arts, so I'm not going to enumerate them here).\r\n\r\n\xA7107 then
    outlines a \"fair use exception\" to the exclusivity of those rights \"for purposes
    such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research.\"\r\n\r\nJohn
    is right that the Fair Use Exception is usually an affirmative defense against
    claims of infringement. It would be up case law to determine what uses would actually
    constitute fair use. Since the statutes were written primarily from the perspective
    of visual art, written works, and musical works, it's a little hard to say where
    things would come down in relation to font software.\r\n\r\nI will go out on a
    limb and give my opinion -- contrary to the opinion John expressed above --  that
    despite most EULAs' prohibition against \"decompiling, reverse engineering, and
    disassembling\" you could probably make a case under Fair Use for a right to open
    up a font and examine the outlines purely for the purposes of learning and research.
    \r\n\r\nI'm not sure what application the doctrine of fair use might have in the
    specific case of Cuf\xF3n here. But if you see an argument, feel free to posit
    it.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind, the statute gives four factors to be used in the consideration
    of whether a particular case is fair use or not: [I'm quoting in full this time]\r\n\r\n(1)
    the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial
    nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes; \r\n(2) the nature of the copyrighted
    work; \r\n(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to
    the copyrighted work as a whole; and \r\n(4) the effect of the use upon the potential
    market for or value of the copyrighted work.\r\n\r\nThis is the balancing test
    that John referred to."

    I will. The discussion about web font format for use with @font-face is exactly
    that: a discussion about web font format, not about licensing terms of rights.
    There is nothing in that discussion from which you should extrapolate a right
    to font users to modify fonts or to convert formats so long as the results meet
    the general protective principle of e.g. WOFF. The only such rights you get are
    if the EULA grants you those rights or if a court determines that such rights
    are fair use. I think there are going to be plenty of foundries that will be happy
    to sell you a web use license and provide you with an appropriate format font
    file <em>but who will prohibit you from creating your own web font files as conversions

    web font licensing, because foundries are going to want to serialise or otherwise
    add custom data to web fonts that is not present in existing TTF/OTF fonts. There
    will, of course, be some fonts that you are explicitly permitted to convert to

    some potential grief on their hands. \r\n\r\nBut until some of the issues get
    sorted out and the technology stabilizes somewhat, I'm not sure how a consistent
    policy can emerge and make its way into the standard EULAs so that asking won\u2019t
    be necessary.\r\n\r\nWe just aren't quite there yet. Frustrating, yes. But that
    seems to be the nature of flux and evolution in any market."

    back-biting and eye-gouging rather quickly.\r\n\r\nThey do. In fact I had a tiff
    with a judge over this issue. I don't know why not just the law, but people in
    general, think juries need to be making subjective decisions about the intentions
    of defendants who have affected the value of someone else's property where boundaries
    are not in dispute.\r\n\r\n>We do accept donations, \r\n\r\nI feel like I am making
    one, being constructive.\r\n\r\n>...and they just about cover the hosting costs...\r\n\r\nAre
    you sure? I mean, how can you tell if the volume of the donation stream is going
    to match the hosting and legal costs? What if some liberator with like a billion
    fonts  wants their EOT's made via your service, scripted this incredibly long
    list of fonts to be converted, did not feel like making a donation and just left
    the script running, (until they felt they got it right?  who could afford that,
    wouldn't someone have to donate more?\r\n\r\nHere's my other constructive advice,
    as the basis of law is that the individual has the responsibility for knowing
    their own, the public's, and other private property, instead of making owners
    of font IP come to your property and describe their property, why not tell all
    users that most font property is licensed with restrictions that preclude the
    use of your service. It is not my legal requirement as an owner to draw the property
    lines wherever they might be needed, who could afford that? If I do put put up
    signs that identify my property, I don't expect to have to go off and either explain
    the legality of those signs, or explain what they mean, who could afford that?\r\n\r\nCheers!"
