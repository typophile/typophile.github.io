body: "I am looking for the font used in this design by Antonio DiSpigna in 1975.
  I'd really like to get this font. I doubt it, but it would be awesome if the \"es\"
  is a ligature! =)\r\nThx."

  body: I'm afraid it would be completely custom. Almost all letterings from U&lc
    magazines were unique. I'd try to find some alternatives but I really doubt to
    find even one... Will see.

  body: "Agree with Ryuk.\r\nFocussing on some of the features (inline/biline, closed
    counters, horizontal bar on |e|, etc.), the best I can found are something called
    Double Vision (http://bowfinprintworks.com/LinedFontGuide02.html) and Churchward
    Design No End (http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/blhd/churchward-design/no-end/)."

    a good base font to reproduce this lettering simply outlining it, removing closing
    strokes, rounding terminals and recreating /s (from /8?).\r\nSome more out-of-the-box

  body: Duoline is one of several digital ripoffs of the photolettering face, <a href='http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/LinedFontGuide01.html'
    target='_blank'>Skin and Bones</a> - which, with its original alternates, would
    seem to be the closest match (dollar sign modified for s?). It makes sense that
    this would have been the inspiration, as it was created by Douglas F. Jones in
    the 1970's. I can't give an exact date, though, so it's possible Skin and Bones
    postdates Mr. DeSpigna's design.
