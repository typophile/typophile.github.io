    I have not checked it letter by letter against Obelisk, but at first glance it
    seems reasonably consistent. The designer, Billy Jacobs, seems to not have had
    access to a full character set,  and Drugstore misses some distinctive features,
    such as the spearhead descender on _x_.\r\nDon"

    much because I want to use it for the header of my food blog. I like it''s apothecary

    thank you enough. '
