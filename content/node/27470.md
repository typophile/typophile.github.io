  plan to use the above logo with this hookah illustration, in the same style as the
  logo.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hookah_5372.png]\r\n\r\nColor palette
  will be reddish browns and earthy oranges.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking it should be an informal
  script or appropriate sans that could be used throughout the identity system: letterhead,
  biz card, envelope, menus, signage etc. Something with a bit of a middle eastern
  vibe to go with the hookah lounge atmosphere.\r\n\r\nNo Papyrus please :-D\r\n\r\nI
  was thinking Canada Type's <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/ali-baba/\">Ali-Baba</a>
  or <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/quiller/\">Quiller</a>\r\n"

    when it would ever get digitised. I even worked on a personal version of it, myself.

  body: "Not really set on script, that was just an idea. Nor am I set on Canada Type,
    that's just what MyFonts came up with when I searched Middle Eastern.\r\n\r\nNow
    that you mention it and I started doing some iterations of identity items, sans
    seems the way to go. I'm up for all suggestions. Thanks!\r\n\r\nWow, Gala is pretty
    slick!"

    with the sans. I'd love to figure it out today because I have to show color comps
    for Wednesday. I'll post up quick screenshots of what I have for progress to help:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/deseos_3609.stationary.1.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/deseos_6492.stationary.2.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/deseos_5796.stationary.3.png]"

    pallette, how does that logo look reversed out of the light grey?\r\nTim"

  body: "Thanks, Tim. I haven't tried reversing the logo out, but maybe if I did that
    I could make the supporting type the brownishred.\r\n\r\nI actually have Mark's
    Mostra in Regular weight from my Indie Fonts books, but the soft, yet modern aspects
    of Isonorm are appealing...and I like the Alt _a_ but what else is different in
    that set? I'll test out Mostra and see how that works first.\r\n\r\nThe silver
    is PMS 8100C which is a Metallic Coated spot color, I need to see how it prints
    on the Epson 1280 RIP though because obviously it's going to be different than
    on screen."

    sans, try Tusar if you can. It has something that feels akin to your logo."
