body: "    I've read what you lot have had to say about specimen documents and looked
  at some of the better books. Let me just say that good specimens are almost as much
  work as the type face in question. Now, I want to see from your view points how
  much I've absorbed about what makes a good type spec book. Presented are a couple
  of type books that I've finished in the last couple of days. I expect them to be
  flamed mercilessly, but it might also be helpfull if someone told me what is RIGHT
  about them.\r\n\r\nThe first is Copper Penny, a reworking of Copperplate Gothic
  featuring a lower case character set.\r\n\r\n[[http://cdn.myfonts.com/s/aw/original/40/0/20617.pdf]]\r\n\r\nThe
  second is JLS OverKill, an ultra bold block style display face.\r\n\r\n[[http://cdn.myfonts.com/s/aw/original/40/0/20607.pdf]]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
