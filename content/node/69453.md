  I'm trying to figure out a good serif to match with Brauer Neue from Electrosmog.
  I've gone through most I could think of on my list but nothing is really spot on.
  I would of course like a serif with oldstyle figures and small caps since it's a
  heck of a lot of text. Because of the height and the rounded corners of Brauer,
  a lot of classical serifs (Caslon etc) don't work. Garamond looks a bit too fiddly
  and Baskerville just lacks character. There is a nice Swedish font called Berling
  but it does not have oldstyle numbers and SC. Any advice folks?\r\n\r\nThanks, \r\n\r\nSimon,
  London"

    Pro</a>.\r\n\r\nFailing that kind of proportional matching, you could go for matching
    the \"ink gain\" (assuming that's what the roundedness of Brauer signifies) with
    a \"chubby\" face such as Dolly or in a more oldstyle vein, my own <a href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/paradigm.html\">Paradigm
    Pro</a>. A more offbeat rounded partner for Brauer: Souvenir.\r\n\r\n"
