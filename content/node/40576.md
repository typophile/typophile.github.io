  have been given a \"style guide\" for anything that we put out, however, I do not
  have photoshop or any other program(s) that I am used to having. I need to convert
  two colours to RGB: 1) c - 100%, m - 65%, y - 0%, k - 30% and 2) c - 100%, m - 10%,
  y - 0%, k - 10%. If anyone knows how to get a colour even close that would be great!\r\nThanx
  heaps and fingers crossed someone knows how to do this!\r\nAliG.\r\n:)\r\n"
