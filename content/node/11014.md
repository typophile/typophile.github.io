  for a good blank T-shirt company that carries all of the colors in the rainbow in
  infant sizes. I have looked all over the place and all I can find are cheesy pastels.
  I am looking for some good rich bold colors. Anyone have an idea? Please contact
  me : <a href="mailto:jeff@jeeto.com">jeff@jeeto.com</a>. <BR> <BR>If I am able to
  work with a recommendation you have I will send you a canvas hot off the press from
  our company : <a href="http://www.jeeto.com" target="_blank">http://www.jeeto.com</a>.
  Ill sign it myself and make you all happy and stuff. <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance!'

  body: Thanks so far. American Apparel is kilelr but they only have white for infants
    and i think some pastels. Broder brothers is cool and I dig the colors they have
    but still need a variety like orange and green. Maybe the best thing to do is
    get a dyer for the aa whites... keep em coming if you have something. Thanks!
