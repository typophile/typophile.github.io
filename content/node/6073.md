body: learning InD on this flyer I got to do.  My stupid question that I can&#39;t
  seem to find an answer to is, do I create another page for the other side of the
  flyer?  or do I create two InD files, one for front, another for back? <BR> <BR>if
  I do create two files, do I &#39;package&#39; them seperately or is there someway
  to combine them into one package? <BR> <BR>thanks for your help

    more practical to have both sides of a piece in the same document. '

  body: Thanks Jesus, is that usually okay for the printer? <BR> <BR>the way I have
    it set up is that it is not a facing page, so that it isn&#39;t mistaken for a
    spread.

    InD will out put pages as separate pdf&#39;s? <BR> <BR>&#40;I haven&#39;t gotten
    that far yet, still designing&#41; <BR> <BR> '

  body: You got it right, Peter. it doesn&#39;t really matter because the software
    the service bureau/printer will use for imposing plates can specify the order
    either way, but laying out front and back as consecutive pages will make it less
    confusing. <BR>

  body: Just make sure you are very precise with the positioning of the elements so
    things match exactly when reversed. <BR> <BR>About the output, InD generates all
    pages as one single pdf document unless you specify the contrary. No need to separate
    them. The other option is to collect files and send the whole folder to the printer.

    want. Give them a copy to have something to compare their proofs and/or bluelines.

  body: ' Kinda weird how the layers pallet doesn&#39;t change relative to which &#39;page&#39;
    you are editing. Like if I only have a type layer for page1, but a type and graphic
    layer for page2, I shouldn&#39;t see the graphic layer when I am editing page1.
    <BR> <BR>I think I like how Illustrator handles layers better. '
