  company - our clients are finance companies so we are going for a conservative yet
  friendly image.  would appreciate any font feedback / critiques on the logo/business
  card.\r\n\r\nspecifically:\r\n\r\n1) does the contrasting font in the logo work?\r\n2)
  any thoughts on font-combinations for the rest of the card?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nJohn"

    this that I don\u2019t know where to start and it would take ages to explain.
    Don\u2019t get me wrong, I don\u2019t mean to be rude. I suggest you hire a designer."

    to close up shop and get a job at the local mcdonalds!   judging from your response,
    you're not a fan of the differing fonts in the logo? I thought it might be a stretch,
    not to mention a bit incosistent. any other critques?  \r\n\r\n\r\nps. i agree
    with your suggestion to hire a designer - can't afford one right now!  every penny
    counts until something comes in the door... "

    the font sizes in relation, the kerning/spacing, the ugly false small caps, how
    the type is placed in the format ............"

  body: "I'm afraid I must agree with Jan. I also don't want to be rude, of course.\r\nBut
    I would start with resetting the spaces and letterspacing on the 'gentle breeze'
    and 'capital group'. Now it looks a bit like something has gone wrong with the
    prepress or something. ;)\r\nThe false small caps in the name also need to go
    in my opinion. Either just use lowercase characters with init caps, or choose
    a typeface with proper small caps (you should probably use something else then
    Arial anyway).\r\nThe contact information part also looks a bit cluttered. It's
    mostly because of the (false?) superscript, and the smaller pointsize of 'tel'
    and 'fax'. I'm not a fan of the digits in brackets either, but maybe that's a
    standard way of writing phone numbers in de USA, if so, ignore me.\r\n\r\nAs for
    the placing and composition itself, maybe try to just align the text either left
    of right, instead of centered. And  for example try to align items to each other,
    so that it becomes more a whole, instead of several individual groups placed seemingly
    random on the card."

  body: If you're in a bind, I might suggest this website called logoworks.com. They
    do some decent work for the price. I recently gave them a try only because I am
    working on a project that is "too close to home" for myself and wanted a different
    perspective. They do more than just logos, but that is their specialty. I am not
    trying to give them a plug, but after reading the comments posted (thinking, ouch,
    that's a bit harsh) and then viewing the layout, eh, I think this website might
    be worth checking out for this. Good luck.

    criticism. But honest critique, I guess, is always somewhat harsh for the person
    it's directed at.

  body: "I think you failed to embed the fonts in your pdf and got substitution fonts
    which doesn\u2019t help.\r\n\r\nTo work with what you have think of it as 4 related
    pieces of information\r\n1 Company name/logo\r\n2 Name and position\r\n3 Postal
    address\r\n4 Telephone numbers and e-mail address\r\n\r\nIf you treat 3 and 4
    as equal importance try setting them as two blocks all the same weight and point
    size, no superscript, ranged left, use a tab after tel and fax and before e-mail
    so that each element starts from the same point on separate lines so it is easier
    to pick out the various elements \u2013 that should give you two blocks each with
    three lines; position the postal address to the bottom left and the numbers and
    e-mail so that the type starts at the centre. Name is more important than addresses
    so you could make it a larger point size than addresses although title could be
    the same size. Avoiding small caps will mean you don\u2019t get the mixed weights
    \u2013 Title Case will be better, there are many ways to position it but you could
    start with centred as you have it. The logo is a different problem a simple \u2018holding\u2019
    text logo could be to set gentle breeze in Palatino Italic with Capital Group
    in Palatino Roman underneath.\r\n\r\n<em>gentle\r\nbreeze</em>\r\nCapital Group\r\n\r\nThe
    italic at a larger size, positioning again has many options. \r\nJust some suggestions
    for DIY \u2013 no substitute for the real thing (I took a look at logoworks.com
    which made me wince).\r\n\r\nTim"

    first comment.\r\n\r\nLooking at the property of your PDF file reveals:\r\n\r\n<cite>Title:
    Microsoft Word - business card 3.doc</cite>\r\n\r\nUsing Word -- or any other
    text processing software -- for layout design is an absolute no-go in the first
    place.\r\n\r\nI do think Tim is right with his guess that you've probably failed
    to embed some fonts. But that really doesn't matter as long as Word is used for
    layout design."

  body: "Fear. Thats what I saw when I opened the PDF. Find a professional Graphic
    Designer to do your card. In todays Business world a business card is your main
    contact and first impression tool. If it sucks, then it can reflec on the services
    you provide. Not that the Services are of lower quality. But think about it, when
    you give this card, which is a 1/10 for the look, then the recipient uses the
    card or refers your services to someone else, and passes the card along to other
    people, that perception is also passed along with it. Not good. I would strongly
    suggest using your network and ask around to find a Graphic Designer can be help
    you out.\r\n\r\nDavid Daigle, Canada"

  body: "Hi John,\r\nMy suggestion if you are on a tight budget is to head for your
    local small print shops and see if they offer design services.  I once worked
    for a print shop where we would do the logo and business card design as part of
    a package deal if the client ordered enough business cards.  Ask to see samples
    of their work first.  You might bring in samples of colors you like or tear out
    magazine pages that to you express the feeling your want your logo and card to
    have.\r\n\r\nYou also could look around to find a business card you like from
    a totally different line of work and geographic location than your own.  Show
    it to people you know and see if they too think it looks nice and professional.
    \ Once you locate a good card, choose similar fonts, alignment and spacing to
    what is on that card.  (I said SIMILAR...it's best never to copy exactly...vary
    the colors or font or something.)\r\n\r\nFor your own growth in things graphic,
    I highly recommend the book The Non-Designer's Design Book by Robin Williams (a
    different person than Robin Williams the comedian).  This is a straightforward
    book about how to make newsletters, posters and yes, business cards, look better.
    \ I think it will really open up your eyes."
