body: "Hello everybody,\r\n\r\nThe question above doesn't refer to the original function
  of inktraps, as that is rather obvious. It refers to the fact that, with the current
  printing technology, I wonder if inktraps are still needed. I think (not sure though)
  that most typefaces are designed for offset printing. What first got me thinking
  about this is that Adobe Garamond (a very commonly used book- and magazine typeface)
  doesn't have any inktraps. Infact, all corners are softened, but when I read a book
  set in Adobe Garamond it looks fine to me. So, as inktraps can be distracting at
  display sizes, would it not be better to leave them out? Any help on this is much
  appreciated.\r\n\r\nCheers, Jasper"

  body: "Inktraps are commonly added to fonts that will likely fill with ink at their
    intersections. Newspaper and phone book types like Retina and Bell Centennial
    are the most extreme cases. They have extensive and deep traps because they\u2019re
    meant to be printed on the worst paper available at damn near the highest speeds
    possible. Narrower fonts tend to have more traps because tight intersections form
    dark spots, and in some very condensed display faces traps are added just to equalize
    the balance of light and dark without breaking the rhythm of the design by making
    a letter too wide or adding extreme tapers. A book face like Adobe Garamond is
    fairly wide and was not commissioned to deal with specific printing problems so
    it doesn\u2019t need much trapping. A more extreme example is ITC Giovanni\u2014also
    by Slimbach\u2014which has little or no trapping but can still hold up to printing
    on cheap pulp because it is very wide and has a huge x-height. And this does not
    mean that there are no traps in the design of Adobe Garamond. There are, but the
    entire French renaissance book type genre has its own style of trapping dark intersections
    with tapers and angles rather than the notch traps people tend to think of."

    size (decoration, dare it be said), which is true of all fine details, whatever
    their function in small text.\r\n\r\nFreight Micro is another face which, like
    Bell Centennial, has been exploited for this quality in display settings by clever
    art directors.\r\n\r\nMore \"ink-trapped\" faces: Amplitude and Griffith Gothic,
    and my Worldwide and Walburn. \r\n\r\n<em>\u2026with the current printing technology,
    I wonder if inktraps are still needed.</em>\r\n\r\nYes; there is huge press gain
    on newsprint, a close cousin of blotting paper.\r\n\r\n"

    But I also know that the opinions on this vary widely on these boards. :)

  body: I have to admit, I would be in favor of fonts designed so that the inktraps
    of the sort noted go away gradually as one goes to larger point sizes - and can
    be dialed away, or the face comes in variants, so that the same typeface can be
    used, with the same resulting visual appearance, either on glossy paper or on
    newsprint.

  body: "There's a very simple reason why the distraction of traps at large sizes
    is irrelevant: you're not supposed to set a text font large! If you do, much worse
    things happen than mere distraction. What you're supposed to do is design special
    cuts for large sizes, and those shouldn't have trapping (except possibly for style).\r\n\r\nA
    corollary: any font that looks good large isn't an optimal text font. And for
    a sub-optimal text font you can forego traps, sure.  :-)\r\n\r\nTrapping is increasingly
    more common these days. Why? The same reason optical sizes are more common now
    than at any time since the beginning of the 20th century: because people care
    more now. Not everybody, but enough people.\r\n\r\nBTW:\r\nhttp://themicrofoundry.com/ss_trapping1.html\r\n\r\n>
    And this does not mean that there are no traps in the design of Adobe Garamond.\r\n\r\nActually,
    it is important to note here that Slimbach does not believe in trapping.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    \ It seems this might be a nice way to help avoid clumping at joints, particularly
    in fonts with PostScript curves that lack the fine control of TrueType hinting.\r\n"
