body: "Hey guys, \r\n\r\nI've been a designer for many years but one of the hardest
  gigs I've come across has been an identity for myself that I don't push aside straight
  after making it.\r\n\r\nThe logo I've been sitting on for a while now is something
  that I'm feeling reflects myself as a designer, individual and business. Its to
  be clear, simple and subtle. \r\n\r\nThe reason why I've posted here is to address
  the most important attribute to the logo and myself as a designer, refined.\r\n\r\nI've
  butchered the mac version of Helvetica to come up with something you can identify
  but with quirk.\r\n\r\nThe logo:\r\n<img src=\"http://www.danjwilliams.com.au/images/logo.jpg\"
  alt=\"Dan J Williams\">\r\n\r\n...and here's a <a href=\"http://www.danjwilliams.com.au\">link
  to the logo in context</a>.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to upgrade, embellish, chop,
  burn, praise, help as you see fit.\r\n\r\nDan.\r\n"

  body: "I think your logo does express clear, simple and subtle. I think the \"J\"
    feels a little like it is sitting out in the open by itself, as there is so much
    space between it and the \"dan\" and \"williams\", perhaps it is because there
    is no\".\" and because it feels so slim and elongated.\r\nI would also explore
    the volume of space between the letters and no just be concerned about their distance
    from each other. I like the logo in context with the nice open sky on your site. "

  body: "Thanks for the feedback alchion,\r\nI've just noticed that the version on
    my website has the original \"J\" maybe that's why it looks fine in context and
    less 'alone'.\r\nI think I prefer the cut off \"J\" to match the style and angle
    of the tops of the \"L\"s and \"I\"s but I do agree with the spacing comment."

    would fit with the other letters better. '

  body: Yeah nice one eliason, I like that 'w'. It actually matches the 'm' better.

  body: The thing that's throwing me off is your unicase-style D. You've embraced
    ascenders and descenders in your other three instances, but eschewed the protuberance
    for this one letter. What would it look like if you either embraced the unicase
    format for J, L, & L or went all lowercase and started off with "d"?

    and most of the time just writing my name and number on a card to network.\r\nSo
    I'm back to refining this logo to get my name on some stock of my own.\r\n\r\nBelow
    are two variations after taking m1ch43l's advice.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/danjwill1_6428.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/danjwill2_6015.jpg]\r\n\r\nI'm
    still after more direction if this is still a worthy cause.\r\n\r\nDan."

  body: "i like the all lower-case version. \r\n\r\nthe letters 'illi' in 'williams'
    form an interesting shape. perhaps there is something you could do with it. \r\nelse,
    if you want to stick with a logotype and no mark, i'd go for all lower-case. "

  body: "I'm unsure where to go from here, I'd like to keep it a simple typographic
    logo and steer away from turning it into a logotype.\r\n\r\nDead set victor, its
    the \"illi\" that I'm attracted to. What also lures me in is a character with
    no acender beginning the logo hence the caps D but the practicality of it is nil.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the ideas to keep me thinking JeroenB."

    last left off unsure where to go with this logo and thats where I stayted, for
    1 year and 45 weeks according to my last post. I've finally had a chance to re-look
    at my humble little logo and make some refinements with an update to my folio.\r\n\r\nHere
    is where it got to, not far from the original design but far better in my opinion.\r\n\r\n<img
