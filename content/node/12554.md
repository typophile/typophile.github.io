body: I don't think I have any of the blog features (until the membership system is
  up at least ;) ) but last night the [[type_club_of_toronto|Toronto Type Club]] had
  [[Jim Rimmer]] from Vanouver BC to speak. Hopefully anyone in the area was able
  to attend. Jim in his home studio, designs type, casts lead type, and runs a letterpress,
  plus much more. His talk was really great, and it was interesting to find out about
  his partnership with [[P22]] to release his types. Some of the technical stuff about
  the production of the type was a bit over my head, but he did a good job of giving
  a good overview and descriptions and photos of some of the tools he used. Anyways
  I thought it was cool, and very nice of him and Richard Keglar, that they gave out
  real pieces of lead type that were P22 ornaments that Mr. Rimmer cast in his home
  studio. They had both a mirror image for actual printing and a unreversed image
  for sourvenir purposes. I included a close up photo <a href="http://www.negativespace.ca/misc/p22.jpg"

    these pieces of type. it was just cool to see. i was amazed by jim's talk, but
    at the end of it i didn't know the right questions to ask. i was impressed at
    jim's illustrations and his beautiful books -- absolutely gorgeous!
