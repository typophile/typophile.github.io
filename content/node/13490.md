  happy to be able to use the Typophile forums as an invaluable resource. In fact,
  I will even be attending TypeCon in a few weeks. However, as I venture towards my
  first actual typeface design project this summer I must say I feel quite unprepared.
  I am hoping that some of you can provide me with some resources. Whether it may
  be books, magazines, websites, interviews, articles, or anything else you feel maybe
  helpful, please post them here. Best of all, of course, would be plain, old advice.\r\n\r\nI
  would also like to thank all of you who post here. Typophile has provided me with
  an education I cannot receive in a classroom or on the job in the future. There
  is an abundance of information available here due to the comradery among designers
  and the collaboration that takes place."

  body: "Hi Jason,\r\n\r\nI feel the same about the typophile education. About your
    question, it\xB4s a good one.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, there are a lot of methods,
    almost one for every typedesigner.\r\nIf we are all agree, form follow function
    in typedesign, specially in readable type.\r\nAs Hrant says, you can stay drawing
    letterforms for hours.. but we read words more than\r\nletters one by one.. To
    design a readable type you must have to think in macrotypography and then microtype
    (letter details) in my opinion... i mean the greytones in the page.\r\nA type
    family its the way to create readable grey shades in the page, these are tones
    of different paragraph colors who can build an logical order in the way that you
    scan pieces of information, after and at the same time that you read.\r\n\r\nI
    this that this part of typedesign its very important, specially for graphic designers
    to know how to select the right font for the right layout and content in information
    design..\r\n\r\nActually, i looking forward to understand typedesign better in
    this way...\r\n\r\nmh.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Jason,\r\n\r\nLook at everything. Notice everything about type wherever you
    see it. This becomes a curse, and a bane to the spouses of type nerds everywhere,
    but it is the trained eye that will guide you through the many, layered, interdependent
    processes that result in a typeface, well made for a real need. \r\n\r\nStart
    by dissecting: Blow up small type, reduce large type, notice what works and what
    doesn't. Why is Avant Garde a display typeface? What is a text typeface? Why do
    some typefaces look \"bigger?\" Get some good type and dissect it in a type drawing
    program. How about those asymmetrical serifs?... What are these little segments
    in all the narrow crotches?....\r\n\r\nThe only thing I'd add to Hrant's mantra
    is LOOK. Draw and re-draw. Your ability to perceive subtleties, combined with
    sure draftsmanship, will be bedrock for your future endeavors. Nothing is precious
    while you're learning. Throw away your first typeface. You'll be glad later. \r\n\r\nYou're
    on your way, if you keep your eyes (and mind) open. And you'll definitely jump-start
    the process to attend TypeCon. We'll see you there. "

  body: "I imagine doing/researching calligraphy would be adventagous. Construction
    of basic roman, upper, lower, all with pen and ink. It seems quite a few Typophiles
    here are straight digital, but I recommend at least starting analog... actually,
    a few quotes ...\r\n\r\nFrom the introduction of Frederic W. Goudy's The Alphabet
    and Elements of Lettering ...\r\n\r\n\" Good lettering must be founded on good
    models; for the use of beginners they ought especially to be simple, dignified
    forms that are free from archaisms and mannerisms of the scribes and that exhibit
    in a high degree the essentials of legibility, beauty and character\"\r\n\r\nthere's
    another one in their that says ( paraphrasing )\r\n\r\n\" one must master the
    basics before creating something new \"\r\n\r\nSo, given the lineage of type design,
    I'd say it's fairly safe to say, when first learning why wouldn't you want to
    do it the same way as the masters?  \r\n\r\nStudying proportion of classic types,
    Garamond, Caslon, Goudy, Jenson and learning how to truly see. Making the translation
    from eye to hand is the key...And if you draw it out by hand, and you think you've
    got it, check it with some sample letters of the aforementioned fathers of type.
    Then do it again. And Again, And Again.It will give you much better understanding
    of the character of letters, their history ... thats all i've got for now.\r\n"

    analog doesn't have to be calligraphic. Draw the border between black and white,
    instead of drawing the black and letting the white merely fall into place.\r\n\r\nOh,

    and macrotypography.\r\n2. look at fonts, closely, even at text size.\r\n3. try
    to draw your first letters based on a rigid grid, if you feel confortable with
    it, be creative about letter shapes.\r\n4. start with the \"easier\" letters (in
    my opinion: n, m, o, r, p, d, g, a, P, T, L), then try the \"harder\" ones (esp.
    S, s, R, G, g, Y, y).\r\n5. then.. i dont know, im not any further right now :)\r\n\r\nat
    least thats what i have done, and i dont regret it. im not anything near \"real

  body: "I'm also a total beginner. I've made a few crappy fonts and have started
    making hopefully my first half-decent one. I'm not going to offer any technique
    advice since I'm still learning myself, but I do think there are a couple of books
    that you should check out.\r\n\r\n1) I HIGHLY recommend this book as it is one
    of the few modern type books that actually shows a little about technique: \"Logo,
    Font & Lettering Bible\" by Leslie Cabarga. A must have for any beginner I think.\r\n\r\n2)
    This one is a bit harder to track down, you might have to special order it (I
    did). Idea Magazine is a Japanese design magazine and last summer they did an
    entire issue about typography. It is No. 303 July 2004. The issue is \"Type Design
    Today.\" Its a great resource, it is more of a book than a magazine. Jean-Fran\xE7ois
    Porchez, Akira Kobayashi, Matthew Carter, Andr\xE9 Baldinger, Fred Smeijers, the
    LettError guys and a few others all have features in this issue...great stuff.\r\n\r\n3)
    Trust your own judgement, if it feels right it probably is.\r\n\r\n4) Lastly,
    I just say look at the type designers and type designs you like the most. \r\n\r\n "

    I also found Letters of Credit really really helpful.\r\n\r\nI also purchased

  body: "I am also starting (the first characters from my new font are almost ready).
    So here's my two cents:\r\n\r\nRead the Microsoft typography specifications. There's
    some good piece of advice on the technical side of constructing fonts. I think
    you must read on the expressive and technical aspects of design.\r\n\r\nI found
    a PDF file a couple of months ago which proved to be VERY helpful. The name: Fontographer:
    Type by Design. The author: Stephen Moye. If you find the book and buy it, it
    will make you and the author happy, even if you don't use Fontographer. I found
    the link to it in this forum.\r\n\r\nIn my experience: make the first characters
    by hand. Doodle a lot until you get the look & feel for your font. Then turn on
    your computer. Of course you can start right down on your favourite vector editor,
    but I think you'll end up with a livelier font if you start with handwork."
