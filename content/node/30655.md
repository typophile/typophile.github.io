body: "Hullo,\r\n\r\nhave a look at <a href=\"http://www.letterror.com/code/superpolator/\">Superpolator2</a>,
  my new Mac OSX app specifically for interpolations. As many dimensions as Doctor
  Who, but without the MultipleMaster straightjacket. Partial masters. Glyph specific
  axes, manage dozens of masters, generate hundreds of fonts. Explore design spaces,
  pick promising extrapolations. So you have time left to look at the original designs
  again. Some animations <a href=\"http://www.letterror.com/code/superpolator/gallery.html\">here</a>.
  And pretty colors.\r\n\r\nBased on the Superpolator math presented at ATypI in 2004,
  <a href=\"http://robofab.com\">RoboFab</a> and many other <a href=\"http://www.letterror.com/code/superpolator/links.html\">great
  libraries.</a>.\r\n\r\n"
