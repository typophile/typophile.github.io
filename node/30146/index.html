  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">What design considerations are primary in the design of the 'bar' glyph? Looking at some Sans designs:

Sometimes I see the glyph with a top height just at above the ascender. ( Arial, Andale Mono ). Sometimes it's a bit higher. ( Azkindenz, Ronnia ) or Quite a bit higher ( Fago, Consolas ). 

Sometimes the base of it isn't lower than a descender, ( Fago, Ronnia) Sometimes it's exactly at the depth of the descender. ( Arial, Consolas, andale mono ) Sometimes it's much deeper. ( Franklin Gothic )

And sometimes it's taller & deeper at the same time. ( Gil Sans, Myriad ) 

What kind of thinking informs such descisions? What situations can you tels to eyeball a solution? 

'a|3', "right|wrong'? 

I would feel beter deciding about this if I had a better idea about how this glyph is used.

What about if the design is a Monospace. How does that impact things?

At the moment it's seems utterly arbitrairy & opaque. Help!</div>

a sign of absolute value (math)


( Absolute value gives a positive answer. For example: 

|−25|= −(−25) = 25

|25|=25   )

Vertical rules and bars

Vertical bar 
Unicode: U+007C

Broken vertical bar 
Unicode: U+00A6
Height alignment : There is no general rule in current usage of these characters. Common height alignments are:

Vertically aligns with ascender and descender.

Vertically aligns with uppercase and the baseline.

Vertically aligns so the bar connects vertically when the document is set solid with no leading. For this character to connect when set with no leading the top would have to be equal to the highest character (often the 'Aring') and the bottom equal to the lowest character (often the 'Ccedilla'). These highest and lowest characters are used in TrueType for the WinAscent and WinDescent in the 'OS/2' table. They are also used to calculate the values in the 'VDMX' table. Both these tables in Microsoft Windows define the vertical cell height. See the TrueType Specification for more information about these tables.
The bottom line: What should I do? Modern usage of vertical rules on personal computers suggests there is no need for this character to be a connecting vertical rule character. Unicode characters U+2500..U+256C are line drawing characters and better suited for this task. Also most page layout programs provide horizontal and vertical rule capability.

The alignment for this character would be best if it is in the body height of the typeface and be approximately the height of the lowercase ascender and the depth of the lowercase descender.

Advance width rule : Placed on the en space of the typeface.

Spacing : Horizontally centered between figure zeros.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">When I wrote that (over 10 years ago) it also had a use as a 'logical or' in programming : 

if (myFont > yourFont || (yourFont == "Courier New")

It's also been used by Si Daniels for over a decade on web pages to separate links :

overview  | uppercase  | lowercase  | figures  | spaces  | diacritics  | punctuation  | monetary  |

so it shouldn't be too short. So I prefer it to be the body height.

More than anything else it's used in shell coding to direct the output of one command to another, known to nerds as “piping.” For example I might use a command to spew out a listing of every file in a directory, pipe the listing to another command that sorts into columns, and then pipe those columns into a command that strips out the ones I don't care to see. For people who use CLUI interfaces on a daily basis, it's essential.

But as far as most graphic design is concerned it's mostly used to separate words because it looks different from all the stuff people used to use for that purpose. For this reason I like to see it go really, really deep to make it stand out from l, 1, and so on. It also helps to make it a little wider or a little narrower than those characters, which makes it obviously different when they end up side by side. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I always make it taller than the total body height so that it can be an unbroken vertical line. This works best with monospaced fonts and I first used it on old manual typewriters decades ago but you can still do stuff at the beginning and end of a line and with tabs if you really want too :-)
