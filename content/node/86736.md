  to charitable causes</strong>\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n<a
  href=\"http://www.fontsforhope.com\"><strong>\"FONTSFORHOPE\"</strong></a>\r\n\r\nJoin
  us and Support a noble cause...\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf
  you\u2019re a designer or user of fonts you can collaborate with the project FontsForHope.
  And to say \u201Dyes\u201D we can do something with typography.\r\n\r\n<strong>What
  Fonts for hope?</strong>\r\nA font distribution project in which profit sharing
  is different from usual.\r\nEvery purchase on our site will generate a profit to
  generate hope for aspecific cause. Under the menu \u2018Hope\u2019 you can see the
  open cases.\r\n\r\n<strong>What is special about the distribution of profits in
  fonts for hope?</strong>\r\nA minimum of 25% and a maximum of 100% * (see detail
  at the end of this page) of each purchase is assigned to a specific cause (each
  font mayallocate funds to a particular case: you can suggest one).\r\n\r\n<strong>Are
  the fonts are more expensive than other sites selling?</strong>\r\nNo. The fonts
  are, at most, at the same price elsewhere.\r\n\r\n<strong>How I can participate?</strong>\r\nIf
  you have fonts for sale, or want to get started on it, you can contact us.\r\nWe
  evaluate your typography and if you are able to access the market,welcome!\r\n\r\n<strong>What
  percentage gets the designer of thetypeface?</strong>\r\n* The default layout is:
  50% of each sale goes to the designer of the typeface, 25% for a cause and the remaining
  25% for operating costs, financial and minimal benefit to the Fonts for Hope team.
  But we are humanand are open to handle any situation that requires it.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------\r\nBest
  Regards!!\r\nMart\xEDn Sommaruga\r\nFernando D\xEDaz\r\nVicente Lam\xF3naca\r\n(TipoType's
