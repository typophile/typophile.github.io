    and the broken of J reapets in other letters k, r, v, w, 1. "

  body: "What about placing the broken part down in the lower right-hand corner, like
    you did with the u?  With the V and the W, there's something at cap height on
    the left hand to help identify the letter, so the right hand side can have the
    broken part without sacrificing too much in legibility.  With J, there's nothing
    else at cap height for the eye to latch on to, so it looks (to me) like it the
    brokenness interrupts the visual rhythm you've established.  I think it works
    much better on the 1, though.\r\n\r\n--Jim K."
