  Sans]] has no contrast at all. (E.g. [[http://www.mediumbold.com/04_thinking/type/typeterms/index.html|1]],
  [[http://okaydave.com/projects/saintpetersburg/typography.html|2]], [[http://issuu.com/naomifarrar/docs/sans_serif_11|3]],
  [[http://www.foamtrain.com/glossary/ccc.html|4]]) Assuming this is correct:\r\n\r\nI
  understood contrast derived from modulation of the stroke width, and I clearly see
  variations of stroke width in Gill Sans (where the curve of the lowercase 'n' joins
  the upright, or the upper part of the lower storey of the lowercase 'a', for example).
  This inplies to me that Gill Sans must have some (albeit subtle) contrast.\r\n\r\nWhat
  have I misunderstood?\r\n\r\nMany thanks\r\nDave Higgins\r\n"

    Mathematical equality of vertical and horizontal\r\nthicknesses results in the
    former appearing thinner.\r\n3) Things look thicker when they touch, and this
    effect\r\nincreases with the acuteness of the angle they join.\r\n\r\nAnd #3 is
    where modulation (the way I like to define it)\r\nkicks in: the thinning of joins
    to avoid visual \"clotting\".\r\nIn contrast :-), contrast means the difference
    in thickness\r\n(and not just between verticals and horizontals) between\r\nvarious
    parts without factoring in #3.\r\n\r\nIf you look at Futura for example, it tries
    to be totally\r\nzero-contrast* but to achieve that the joins (like in the\r\nlc
    \"a\") are thinned (modulated) a great deal.\r\n\r\n* Something I actually wouldn't
    attribute to Gill Sans.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
