    B\xF6k. Here's a page:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Diamonds_4221.png]\r\nSubsequently,
    I rendered the alphabet in a variety of type styles, beyond the original \"old
    style\" (shown), which is most suitable for poetry.\r\nIn fact, it would be possible
    to do a Panoptic version of just about any typeface.\r\nI've thought about providing
    Panoptic versions of the types I design, but I don't think it would be worth the
    effort. My next development along these lines will more likely be display cuts
    of the original Panoptica fonts, with proportional widths. That doesn't really
    make sense according to the original premise, but would probably be much more
