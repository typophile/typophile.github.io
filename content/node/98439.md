  additional (terrible) signs for them that match... thanks for any help... I tried
  a font ID site where you upload the picture, but since it's at an angle I didn't
  have any luck....\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/9JstX.jpg\r\n"

  body: "Antique Olive Nord?\r\n\r\nedit: The c, at least, seems closer in Nord than
    in Compact. It would need squooshing, but maybe that's because of the angle of
    the wall?"
