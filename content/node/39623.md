  body: MDR, do you mean these faces as used by designers other than Neville Brody?
    Because his two monographs contain plenty of examples...  :-)

  body: When I was typesetting books in the 1990s it seemed that every other one (textbooks)
    was using Industria (for chapter pages, not text, of course). The narrow width
    meant you could get a long title on one or two lines.

  body: "I've dug up a piece I did in 1989, suitably Industria-l.\r\nIt's a 16-page
    5 1/2 x 8 1/2 booklet, black + spot colour.\r\nAs you can see, the three Brody
    fonts came as a package on diskette.\r\nI used Industria and Insignia, but Arcadia
    was too elegant for this job.\r\nOn the cover, I had fun playing around with dropshadows,
    horizontal scaling, and a piece of software (can't remember its name) that distorted
    type, but not easy to control. So I combined that with a flag I drew in Illustrator
    88. It's a two-colour piece, because in those days, 4-colour was too expensive
    for a lot of jobs. Dropshadows were difficult on my Mac Plus, which was B&W, no
    greyscale, so it was hard to tell which text box was on top, and sometimes it
    was the dropshadow.\r\nI stretched Insignia, somehow it seemed to contrast better
    with Industria that way.\r\nFor text, I shied away from using the Brody faces,
    went with Franklin Gothic, Futura, and Century Schoolbook.\r\nI also didn't use
    the Industria lower case. Too arty, I guess.\r\nIt's sad to compare the environmental
    committment of that time (the Brundtland Commission, etc.) with today, because
    in between, it went missing.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CSA1_4791.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CSA2_3993.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CSA3_6292.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/disc_6352.jpg]"

    is on a Syquest that I can't read any more.\r\n\r\n:)"

  body: "I wouldn't exactly call it a system, just a plan chest.\r\nI might have the
    digital files backed up somewhere on a CD, but it's easier to find a printed piece.\r\nThe
    files were in Quark, so I could probably open them with InDesign.\r\nThat was
    way before PDFs, which is a great format for archiving.\r\nThe font disks are
    in a miniature single-drawer filing cabinet, with a lock and key!"
