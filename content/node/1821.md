  with a short line. <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t find a rule in my german typo-books. What
  to you think of it? <BR> <BR>

  body: If by a short line you mean Indented &#40;sangrada&#41; it depends on the
    spacing before the paragraph so it can be easily distinguished from the previous
    one. The custom here is to separate ragged paragraphs and to indent justified
    ones. <BR> <BR>If by a short line you mean to break it soon, it sounds like a
    good strategy for marking the paragraph beginning.

  body: A short or long first line is really dependent on the copy and the set width.
    Either one can work. But a quality rag setting, either left or right, should have
    the natural organic quality of a gentle coastline. Not too craggy and not too
    even. And should avoid any forced mechanical short-long-short-long solution.  <BR>
    <BR>Setting a good rag is one of the most difficult things to do in typography.

  body: Both full ragged right and full justification are primitive solutions. The
    ancient Greeks knew how to make a &#34;soft rag&#34; paragraph, in that old pragmatic
    way of balancing everything, something that was lost with the provincial absolutism
    of the Romans which pervades the West to this day. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Golly, Hrant, you&#39;re never one to dwell on the subtleties, nuances and
    counter-evidential examples are you? Why look at books when you can just make
    broad general assertions! There are many examples of soft rag in the manuscript
    and print traditions of Western Europe, but the dominant model in the Western
    formal book manuscript was justification by letter expansion and contraction,
    which is itself a very fluid technique, not remotely &#39;absolutist&#39;. Gutenberg
    emulated this technique in the 42-line Bible, but within a few years it was abandoned
    in favour of efficiency.

    is <BR>the difference <BR>between <BR>this <BR> <BR>and the <BR>more even <BR>rag
    seen <BR>in this <BR>example <BR> <BR>Both are ragged right, but the second is
    less ragged and looks way better than the first. If you don&#39;t have the ability
    to control this by expanding and contracting letterforms as one can in manuscript
    and as Gutenberg took the time to do, then you have to be willing to break words
    &#40;as Hrant&#39;s ancient Greeks certainly were&#41;. <BR> <BR>This is <BR>the
    dif- <BR>ference <BR>between <BR>this... <BR> <BR>&#40;Of course, these examples
    are intended only to show different kinds of rag; anyone who sets type in columns
    that narrow needs a kind of help that we are not able to provide on Typophile.&#41;
    <BR> <BR>I think we&#39;re probably all agreed that letterspacing lowercase letters
    to fill out a line, whether for justification or to tidy the rag, is a wicked

    Is it enlightenment fetishism and modernist ideology? <BR> <BR>Most of the surviving

    of the kind of soft rag you speak of so admiringly. So maybe you shouldn&#39;t
    blame the Romans. <BR> <BR>How about the scriptorium monks of the Middle Ages?
    Yes, they&#39;re probably the guilty party, but they didn&#39;t abuse letter or
    word spacing to achieve their justification: they broke words with delightful
    lack of concern for &#39;hyphenation rules&#39;, and widened and compressed letterforms
    often with great sensitivity. So, yes, they justified text but they did it bloody
    well. And before you get hot under the collar about readability, please remember
    that reading in the Middle Ages meant reading <i>aloud</i>, not silent, immersive
    reading. Gutenberg also did justification with great sensitivity, and if you think
    the 42-line Bible is &#39;a painting, not a book&#39; I suggest you find someone
    who will let you sit down and leaf through a copy: that, sir, is most definitely
    a book. <BR> <BR>The so-called Enlightenment? Okay, now we&#39;re beginning to
    see some pretty bad justification, but we&#39;re also seeing looser letterspacing
    generally, and other problems. So perhaps this is indeed where your scorn should
    land. <BR> <BR>Modernism? Oh, the irony: modernists, the ideological champions
    of ragged-right typography, the scourge of the justified text, blamed for making
    justified texts the norm. <BR> <BR> <BR><i>who cares about actual</i> reading...
    <BR> <BR>In case you havn&#39;t noticed, Hrant, people have been reading fully
    justified texts fully well for <i>hundreds of years</i>. You continue to treat
    reading as if it were some incredibly fragile, difficult to achieve thing. It&#39;s
    not: it&#39;s incredibly robust and ready for just about anything that bad typographers
    can throw at it. This is not to say that we should accept bad typography and not
    try to do better, but suggesting that justified text is somehow unreadable is
    irrational in the face of so many centuries of reading.'

  body: Bill, <BR> <BR>Adobe certainly considered using MM technology in this fashion.
    There are a couple of key problems with it, however. First, the width axis setting
    of an MM font is not predictably deterministic in its effect on the width of a
    line. The programming difficulty and performance penalty of having to deal with
    each glyph&#39;s continuously variable degrees of expansion/contraction would
    have both been huge. Performance in interaction with the paragraph composer would
    have been a real problem. <BR> <BR>Technical difficulties aside, how many MM serifed
    text typefaces were made with a width axis? Kepler was one. Minion had a mild
    width axis, but only in one direction &#40;more condensed than regular&#41;. There
    were probably others, but I can&#39;t think of them offhand. <BR> <BR>All of this
    is sort of moot, of course, since Adobe made the decision to stop doing MMs around
    the same time that InDesign 1.0 was finishing development. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR>

    little on what Thomas described, for those who didn&#39;t immediately catch the
    implications &#40;as I didn&#39;t at first&#41;: <BR> <BR>Any given glyph will
    vary by a different amount when widened according to an intelligent, MM-based
    scheme &#40;as opposed to wholesale percentage scaling&#41; -- for instance, the
    change in an &#39;m&#39; is going to be proportionately greater than that of an
    &#39;i&#39; &#40;which wouldn&#39;t really widen much, if at all&#41;.  <BR> <BR>You
    can&#39;t simply determine that a given line is 96% of the full line length and

    &#40;Which, by the way, I think was a foolish, misleading, and mistaken feature
    to include in InDesign.&#41; <BR> <BR>A change in width axis will have a greater
    effect on a seven-letter word like &#34;mammals&#34; than, say, &#34;fillies.&#34;
    When attempting to justify a line with intelligent width expansion, the amount
    of adjustment will be highly dependent upon the specific individual characters
    in each line.  <BR> <BR>Calculating the overall width setting on an MM axis for
    any given line, determined by all the interrelated variations of each of the characters

    what Bayer [thought he] liked. There&#39;s a consistent stream running through
    history since the Romans: <BR> <BR>The Romans &#34;borrowed&#34; the Greek culture
    to create the bulk of their own, but they didn&#39;t inherit any of their wonderful
    pragmatism&#42;. The Romans -being imperialists- were driven by Order and Formality,
    a desire to <i>control</i> &#40;as opposed to the Greek desire to <i>understand</i>&#41;.
    This translated to the desire to control Nature during the Enlightenment, and
    in the microcosm of typography Modernism turned this into nice rectangular blocks.
    <BR> <BR>&#42; That&#39;s why Rome is when Western Culture really started - Greece
    was a hybrid/transit between East and West. The Ancient Greeks would cry laughing

    <i>under</i> them: the desire for superficial control, versus the desire for true
    harmony, which is never absolute. This is paralleled for example in the thought
    that all single letters are critical in reading &#40;because that makes it more
    controlled&#41;, versus the reality that reading is an extremely heurtistic, nebulous
    activity. It is also paralleled in the imposition of identical vertical proportions
    in Latin/Cyrillic type design: it <i>looks</i> better on the surface, but in truth
    it is a violation of functionality. And it is also paralleled in religious fundamentalism;
    the Talibaan are much more Western than they think! <BR> <BR>The Romans were much

    HZ technology. <BR> <BR>InDesign is using a variant of this, but since the glyph
    scaling in InDesign does not preserve stroke weight, it is of much more limited
    use. Some folks wouldn&#39;t use it at all, and those who do use it restrict it
    to just a couple of percentage points in either direction. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR>

  body: Even in InDesign 2, the multi-line composer will try to make a relatively
    even rag in terms of evaluating line break options for all lines in each paragraph
    interactively. <BR> <BR>&#42;IF&#42; you have hyphenation on, it will also use
    hyphenation and you can use the slider to choose your preferred balance between
    more even spacing &#40;= more even rag with ragged right setting&#41; vs. more
    hyphenation. So with ragged right setting, one might turn on hyphenation, but
    use the slider to make it an option of last resort by preferring a rougher rag
    over hyphenation. <BR> <BR>T
