  a new favorite that isn't even Twitter Specific.\r\n\r\n[[http://fluidapp.com/|Fluid]]
  is an OSX app (Sorry PC users) that is similar to Mozilla's Prism application. It
  creates a site specific browser that is independent of any other browser/window
  you have open. Yeah, yeah, bla bla bla. \r\n\r\nBut what is unique is that you can
  make it work as a menubar app, just like Twitterific, but is in fact a full featured
  browser.\r\n\r\nI now post straight into Twitter, the actual Twitter page, from
  my menu bar.\r\n\r\nVery Sweet.\r\n\r\nP.S.\r\nI also plan on having a menubar app
  for Typophile, since I haven't been able to check it too frequently as of late."
