body: 'Hi all: <BR> <BR>I&#39;m new here. I&#39;m not a professional typographer and
  my mother tongue is not English. So, please, be lenient with me. I just love books
  and typography - I&#39;ve read a few &#40;about a dozen&#41; books on it and know
  almost all the classic typefaces and the rudiments on how to plan a book.  <BR>
  <BR>From my youth I was fascinated by two arguably similar typefaces: what I know
  now is Monotype Bembo &#40;the metal version&#41; and Garamond &#40;I am fortunate
  my Grandfather had two genuine Plantin books - one published in the 17th Century
  and another one in the 18th&#41;.  <BR> <BR>I am fairly content with Adobe Garamond
  &#40;which I think is generally closer to the original - I mean in the general way
  a page looks - than Stempel Garamond&#41; but not with the digital Monotype Bembo.
  <BR> <BR>When I manage to locate Monotype Bembo I bought it, but the ascenders and
  descenders were quite reduced. I e-mailed Monotype, they said they were working
  on a new version, but, quite casually, I found a new digital version that is extremely
  similar &#40;I mean, it copies it&#41; the original Monotype Bembo. <BR> <BR>I asked
  Monotype again &#40;I sent a specimen&#41; and they told me it would probably be
  a metal font. Now I know it isn&#39;t. <BR> <BR>Does anyone know what it is and
  how I can get it?  <BR> <BR>I found it in Stereophile - a magazine dealing with
  hi-fi matters.  <BR> <BR>Any contribution will be warmly welcome. <BR> <BR>Yours,
  <BR> <BR>R de S'

    See daidala.com also for a discussion, if I remember rightly.

    <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think it is Aetna. I bought it yesterday and it doesn&#39;t
    quite match.

  body: Aside from the R, what makes you think it&#39;s not Monotype Bembo? There
    is also <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/aldine-401/?PREFS_SET%5BRenderSize%5D=72&amp;PREFS_SET%5BRenderString%5D=Rowland"
    target="_blank">Aldine 401</a>, Bitstream&#39;s version of Bembo. The monotype
    version might well have an alternative R, though. I see that the <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/bembo-titling-mt"
    target="_blank">titling version</a> has a similar R to your sample.

  body: 'To Mister Berkson: <BR> <BR>Well, I have Monotype, Adobe and Bistream Bembos.
    They all differ from this one inasmuch the x height is relatively greater; that
    is, the form of the characters &#40;a, c, e m,and so on&#41; is a faithfull copy
    &#40;To the extent of having the slightly bent m&#41;, but both the ascenders
    and descenders have been reduced.  <BR> <BR>I think when Monotype digitized the
    font they tried to reach a sort of compromise - the new versions work well at
    11 points, whereas the old book version was made, I think, with 12 points in mind
    &#40;actually, it was 12 points&#41;. <BR> <BR>To Mr Serra, dear friend: <BR>
    <BR>Thank you. Could I second Mr Caston&#39;s request for a link - I can&#39;t
    seem able to find it.  <BR> <BR>And to all, thank you. I love the old Monotype
    Bembo - I really can&#39;t tell why, by I assume it is because of its extremely
    elegant proportions and, at the same time, the very slight irregularity and &#34;bite&#34;
    it possesses. Not so pronounced as, for instance, Galliard but far more so than
    Robert Slimbach&#39;s excellent Garamond.'
