    well.

    posters, etc. from the period and approximate the hexidecimal and CMYK builds
    from the images. Depending on the quality of the scands, you can develop a nice
    palette. I did the same thing for a 1950s direct mailer with great success.\r\n\r\nMartin

  body: "I want to thank all of you for taking the time to share your ideas with me.
    \ Frode frank impressed me with his colourlovers skill.  I need to really get
    into that sight and learn how to ask it. In reply to oprion, I was born during
    WWII [and Martin thinks he is a dinosaur!] and the first images that impressed
    me were the publications printed on a stock that muted the colors.  I think it
    is that look I am after.  I am especially thinking of the British publications
    from that era, although all the classic magazines from that period, Colliers,
    for example had the same look.  I suspect it was because of the high pulp content
    of the paper.  And I agree with Bert.  If I can set the mood with the subject
    one discordant color shouldn't spoil and might enhance something.And thank you
    Don, for suggesting Leslie Carbaga's reference.\r\nmgk"
