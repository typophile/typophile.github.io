  ABC3D pop-up book]] <a href=\"#foot_1\" name=\"foot_src_1\">[1]</a> is an amazing
  little gem, produced by Marion Bataille. It's a game of letters, the whole alphabet
  will pop up whilst flicking through the pages and some of transform into other letters.
  The I becomes a K, the K an I depending on which strap you draw. I t plays with
  sweet little effects. like mirror and transparent paper to get different letters
  from the same \u201Cbase\u201D. Check out the [[http://www.metacafe.com/watch/1186973/abc3d/|video]],
  a loveley presentation of the book with very fun music <a href=\"#foot_2\" name=\"foot_src_2\">[2]</a>,
  which surely describes it better than my words...\r\nFunny story behind the commercialisation
  is, the apparently unwanted marketing campaign. A [[http://www.abc3dbook.com/\"
