<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>i think your secind option works better, but you should rework your "N"(structuraly has nothing to do with the other characters), the"V"(Ithink is falling backwards, you should move the base a little to the left), your "R"(shoul have an open part as "B"), the "U"(i think your diagonal terminal should be the other way), the "S"(you should see how it looks with the terminal gest pointing to the inside of the character), and the "G"(move the hook upwards) <br> <br>I am waiting for the "UC" and "lc", cause i think that this is a unicase version, don't it. <br> <br>CG ||</div>

<div class=commentbody>I don't see any problem with the N. It shares the same uncial/semiuncial heritage of other letters. Besides, where's written that an R should morphologically follow the logic of the B or vice-versa? Maybe the intention of John Spencer was to give each letter a different treatment. That's why I think these postings are often tricky for a beginner. They may be confusing more than helping...</div>

<div class=commentbody>I didn't mean to be polemic, Cristian, sorry! <br>Being relatively new I didn't realized fully that being in the Sans Serif cathegory, Pseudo sachsen was meant to be a face for extensive textsetting. <br>Anyway in odd designs the B and the R could be different (I'm odd, you'll see). <br>I'm sorry you spent time doing the image which is useful indeed. I just thought of Pseudo Sachsen as a generic face...</div>

<div class=commentbody>i intentionally posted this face without any introduction or basis, because i was <br>curious as to what kinds of classifications pseudo sachsen would receive from <br>my peers. <br> <br>perhaps i did initially post sachsen in the wrong category, yet my intentions with <br>the lower case are to maintain a legible, modern sans-face while the caps possess <br>a bit of the display majuscule as some of the historical specimens from which i <br>collected reference (namely the 5th to 9th century adoption of roman characters <br>and written literacy into anglo-saxon, irish, visigothic and other northern european <br>cultures)</div>

<div class=commentbody>I'm very interested and look forward to seeing where you take the lowercase. I enjoy both versions of what has been shown as I can see a serif/semi-serf and a sans-serif version, as well as perhaps a wider version. Once set at a text size, it might work better a bit wider. (?) I can understand why some would consider this a display face, it goes against what has become expected and what we are used to using for text. It would be interesting to try this for text in small amounts for flavor. But I want you to convince us (me) that it can be used for longer texts. Perhaps once you are finished, or closer, you could set a page and create a pdf. </div>

<div class=commentbody>John <br> <br>i really like your imrovements <br> <br>only a few comments <br> <br>1.-in your lc "r" i think that the "nose" should be shorter, is to ackward the spacing with these one. <br>2.-i do like the second stem to be shorter but you should be carefull or even forget it in some characters like the "n" or "m", besides this is completely the opposite in the UC "M" and "N" <br>3.- Why not givin' some curvy stuff in the descender of the "x", that would tie it up with the other letterforms. <br>4.- in your UC "S" i think that it should be so rough in the right bottom, you should go up a little bit with that corner, the same as lc "b" <br>5.- in the lc "o" those corners should be more clear, like in your lc "c" <br>6.- lc "z" for me is too wide <br>7.- you should shorten a little bit the acender of lc "t", it's too disturbing <br> <br>anyway, you are progressing with big steps, good work :-) <br> <br>CG</div>

<div class=commentbody>John, <br> <br>This is really fascinating work. <br> <br>Entering the "B/R" debate late as I am, <br>I was going to disagree with Cristian <br>(specific to this face only) on the grounds <br>that the forms seemed to reflect enough <br>of each other to my eyes, but I quite like <br>the solution you presented afterward. <br> <br>I like the direction you've established in the lc, <br>but I'd love to see more uncial forms, <br>especially in lc "a", "b", "d" and "r", and <br>perhaps "e". Check the forms in Omnia <br>(<a href="http://www.myfonts.com/Search?searchtext=omnia" target=_blank>http://www.myfonts.com/Search?searchtext=omnia</a>) <br>to see more precisely what I mean. <br> <br>David</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hello, John -
Somewhat belatedly, but justified by my Saxon descent ;-) How may I obtain a file of the Pseudo Sachsen font, which (as I understand) has been ready for some time? Strictly for my private projects, of course.
Thanks in advance -
