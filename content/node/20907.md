  typeface designer, currently working in Berlin. Born 1965.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.formgebung.com\r\n\r\n1990\u20131993\r\nEmployee
  at [[MetaDesign]]. Involved in the design of the CI and navigation system of the
  BVG (the Berlin transit authority). During this project, MetaDesign created [[FF
  Transit]], which is used by the BVG and distributed by FSI [[FontShop]] International.\r\n\r\nAfterwards
  independent type designer. Krause develops typefaces for corporations and for [[FontShop]].
  During the mid-1990s, he designed a signage font for DeutscheBahn, which was meant
  to be more legible in large sizes than [[Helvetica]]. This typeface will most likely
  be seen less and less, however, as the Deutsche Bahn has a new series of typefaces
  (2005), which were designed by [[Erik Spiekermann]] and [[Christian Schwartz]].\r\n\r\nIn
  2006, FontShop Berlin released [[Trivia]] a demo font designed by Krause. Trivia
  is in the style of many contemporary sporting event fonts, and some consider it
  similar\u2014but significantly better\u2014than the typeface used in the World Cup
  Germany 2006 identity. Trivia is expected to be released as a full typeface family
  by FSI FontShop international in the future.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, he translated (and
  expanded) [[Karen Cheng]]'s [[Designing Type]]. The German edition, published by
  the [[Verlag Hermann Schmidt]] in [[Mainz]] is hardcover, and longer than the english
  edition. It is also not set in [[Univers]]! The German title is called \"Anatomie
  der Buchstaben \u2013 Basiswissen f\xFCr Schriftgestalter\", which is better translated
  as \"Anatomy of Letterforms\u2014Basic Tips for Type Designers.\"\r\n\r\n<strong>Links</strong>\r\n<a
