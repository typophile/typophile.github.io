		<div class="commentbody">I was surprised that nobody had mentioned Sabon, Monotype Garamond or Berthold Garamond. <BR> <BR>I'm not surprised that Stempel Garamond rated highly, but I have to say that I'm not overly fond of it. I think it is just too &quot;chiseled&quot; for my taste as to what I want as a book face. There are even more chiseled looking faces that I like plenty, but not for book text. <BR> <BR>I would also note that as a typeface design, Adobe Garamond Pro (OpenType) is essentially the same design as Adobe Garamond. <BR> <BR>Normally I can't comment on unannounced projects, but Rob's Garamond revival is one that we have actually previewed in public. I will say that it is his top priority major project. I can't comment on a timeline, but it's getting plenty of attention and I don't expect it to end up on the back burner again. <BR> <BR>a) Since I always have all Adobe typefaces, the one I'd go out and buy would be Sabon Next. <BR> <BR>b &amp; c)  Can't answer at this time. Would have to do a more careful evaluation of Sabon Next, and will soon be competing with our new project. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T</div>

In print, i.e. offset printed at 2400 or 3600 dpi, the regular is not too dark at all; in fact it can be a little light. I still think it is the best Garamond revival. Of course, I have a soft spot for <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/tiro/1530-garamond/">1530 Garamond</a>, but it is probably too authentic for daily use.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I found strange to decide that a particularly weight of a particularly typeface is too light or too dark after tests on a particular laser printer. <BR> <BR>For example: to my experience, Apple laser printers give very bold type when HP laser printer give the reverse. <BR> <BR>And, specially, when the final output is offset litho, on a particular paper, what you've got on a laser printer is irrelevant at all. <BR> <BR>If I comeback to Garamond question, I can say that Adobe Garamond was my prefered Garamond until I discovered that the general effect is too wide and too Italian compared to original French Garamonds (from the various original books I had in hands from Estienne and others at the Imprimerie Nationale). Then, Stempel one, despite its angular shapes and Berthold Garamond despite not very available today as before, seems booth better. <BR> <BR>(don't miss Augereau designed couple of years ago, another good one &ndash; but a bit decorative on some forms). <BR> <BR>I can't comment on Sabon Next for obvious reasons.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Albert Barwick! yes got it! thanks. <BR> <BR>&quot;complaining&quot; <BR>I complain myself that Sabon Next Regular is printed too light on the Linotype specimen. But some friends have say to me that german printers like pale printing (?! the black ink is a bit grey) So, I wait for the second edition due in next couple of days-weeks to see. <BR> <BR>The Prix Charles Peignot book (composed in Sabon Next too), is better inked to my eyes. <BR> <BR>What can be wonderful, is too see a book composed with various Garamonds available on the market, each used at their best size. From the &quot;1530&quot; to the Berthold, Stempel, A Garamond, Sabon Next, etc. The result will be appealing to the eyes as old books can be. <BR> <BR>What about a Founders Garamond? (in reference to Founders Caslon)</div>

Stephen suggested that dark type can be a good thing, as demonstrated by Fred Smeijer's types, but I think there is a difference between type that is intended to be dark and type that just ends up that way because of a printer.</div>
