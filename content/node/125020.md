body: "It's been a long, arduous road back, but we hope you're as excited as we are!\r\n\r\nSo
  what's the new Typophile all about? \r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, all the archives
  have been preserved and we've even worked hard to ensure that URLs have remained
  as consistent as possible. You'll find old Forums content now grouped under an appropriate
  Community. \r\n\r\nTypophile has all always been about community. It's the relationships
  and conversations we've built together over years that has made Typophile what it
  is, so we've decided to double down on community. To this end, we've done a few
  things. \r\n\r\n<strong>Home. Optimized for mobile</strong>\r\nWe wanted to encourage
  quick and easy sharing, so we've built a status engine that gives you up to 329
  characters (ahem, Latin 1 + 2 if you're curious) to share a thought, link, or picture.
  Snapping found type and posting from your phone just got really easy.\r\n\r\nGot
  a few free moments? The new Typophile makes it even easier to scroll through updates
  and see what people are up to. \r\n\r\n<strong>Goodbye Forums. Hello, Communities</strong>\r\nWe
  are declaring the message board format dead and welcome Communities in their place.
  Active topics across all communities rise to the surface, allowing you to graze
  and discover new communities that pop up.  \r\n\r\nAnyone can start a community!
  We hope that the new system encourages lots of meaningful groupings and activity.
  \r\n\r\n<strong>Always Improving</strong>\r\nDespite the unfortunate hiatus, our
  commitment to Typophile remains stronger than ever. To that end, if you encounter
  bugs or design glitches, check the <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/125021\">known
  issues</a> and add it in the comments.\r\n\r\n "

    which may remove the need for repeating the same replies by simply upvoting those
    that one agrees with. Although this voting should have some more meaning related
    to it. Replies that have higher upvotes should become <em>visually more prominent</em>
    (not by changing replies order) compared to those that may even receive downvotes.</li>\r\n<li>And
    even though this site became very mobile friendly I don't like the non responsive
    approach because its <strong>usability on desktops</strong> is now very much hindered.
    It should at least limit it's content width. Nowadays designers having huge displays
    with huge resolutions makes this page lets just mildly put it <em>unreadable</em>.</li>\r\n<li><strong>No
    support for markdown?</strong> These days many sites where users add formatted
    content use markdown instead of HTML tags. Markdown is so much simpler, a whole
    lot quicker to type and simple for server side processing. It would be great if
    you'd support MD formatting. If MD is not something you'd like to support then
    at least implement keyboard shortcuts for <code>Ctrl+B</code>, <code>Ctrl+I</code>
    etc. which would insert tags into types content either at caret position or around
    selection. This is a rather simple thing to do.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Formatted
    preview</strong> can be enabled but it will only display what's been typed and
    won't auto update if one continues editing. <em>Update button</em> is also placed

    - now that SOME of us know the site is back up and running, we'd be able to share
    news of them with interested parties elsewhere. For example, I'm a member of an
    ambigrammists group on Facebook, and intend to let the people there know as soon
