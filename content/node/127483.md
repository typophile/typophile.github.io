  the print industry.\r\nSo I keep a keen eye on their work and study their type/layout
  that sort of thing.\r\nNoticed a recent tendency for a use of Leading that to me
  seems odd. I assume it is being done deliberately as they don't miss a trick.\r\nBut
  is it good/done for a reason/what am I missing? I am honestly interested in other
  views as perhaps my own opinion is a bit outdated/wrong.\r\n"

  body: The former book can almost get away with this, but the latter feels outright
    repulsive to me.
