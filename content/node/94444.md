  of the 50 Shades trilogy, because regardless of what my opinion on the books is,
  it's a pretty nice font.\r\n\r\nWarning: Big image\r\nhttp://cityhallblog.dallasnews.com/files/2012/05/FIFTY_SHADES_OF_GREY_MEN_24740074.jpg\r\n\r\nI'm
  sorry it's so big, but it's high res, so maybe that'll help a little?\r\n\r\nThanks
  so much!\r\n\r\n"
