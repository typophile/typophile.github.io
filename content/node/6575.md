body: Does anyone know what font the Xerox logo is? Is it a specially created font
  or can it be found elsewhere?  I mean the new logo, not the pixellated &#34;x&#34;.
  You can see it in the top left corner of Xerox&#39;s website - <a href="http://www.xerox.com"

  body: I&#39;d be very surprised if it isn&#39;t a custom font. However you can get
    a similar feel from <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/peignot/" target="_blank">Peignot</a>
    or <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/optima/" target="_blank">Optima</a>.

  body: I agree this is most likely a custom job, but it certainly has some similarities
    with Mollenstadt&#39;s <a href="http://www.philsfonts.com/detail.html?sku=BQ90139007P1">
    Signata</a>. Maybe a cross between that and Piegnot? <BR> <BR> -t

  body: The Xerox logo is a custom design and has been around since at least the eighties.
    Lettering artist Ray Cruz also did a whole alphabet based on it which they have
    used in their ads, but it is only for their use.
