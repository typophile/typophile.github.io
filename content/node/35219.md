  (Yes, you can hang me on the wall if you like)\r\n\r\nI'm approaching the final
  year of my BFA studies and am doing some study of Dutch type design, specifically
  the work of Jan van Krimpen. I plan on synthesizing the information I garner into
  a typeface, whose parameters have not totally been set yet. I'll make sure to keep
  things posted as the work progresses.\r\n\r\nSo, here's the question: What are the
  best resources for finding specimens (pdfs, scans, or whatever as long as my budget
  will allow) of Jan van Krimpen's work?\r\n\r\nI've ordered a copy of Dutch Type
  by Jan Middendorp and have a copy of Letters of Credit by Walter Tracy. Any other
  recommendations of books I should look into? \r\n\r\nI've also tried to search the
  Typophile forums to see if any other threads have come up about this specific topic
  to no avail. If there are any related posts, that would be helpful as well.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for the help.\r\n\r\nArlo"

  body: "Dear Lurker,\r\nYou hit on my favorite subject. There are a few good books
    on the work of Jan van Krimpen. I had the priviledge of going to Johannes Enschede
    & Zon(s) in Haalem. I saw some of his original work with the firm. Sem Hartz was
    alive then and he worked with van Krimpen in the development of type that came
    out in Monotype form. His most grandeous project was the Cancellersca Bastarda
    with over 250 characters. I'm sorry that htis face was never digitized. I reproduced
    it in a photolettering font over 40 years ago. Van Krimpen was also a prolific
    writer on letter design. "

    will be pleased to hear that Cancelleresca Bastarda is actually in the process
    of being digitised for TEFF. I am a big admirer of Jan van Krimpen's work too,
    and CB is indeed one of his finest. I have examined the original drawings, type
    specimens and punches myself, only to find a world of differences (naturally).
    Paul R\xE4disch, the punchcutter who cut almost all of Van Krimpen's typefaces,
    was a very skilled man and I think he has been praised too little for this. It
    was him who actually made the typefaces work.\r\n\r\nBack to the subject, other
    notable books about Van Krimpen's work are:\r\n- About Designing and Devising
    Type, written by JvK himself\r\n- Adieu Esthetica, written by various authors
    for a JvK exhibition in The Hague"

  body: "'The Work of Jan van Krimpen', by John Dreyfus is a must, as well as 'About
    Design and Devising Type,' mentioned above. If the second is the book I remember
    seeing, the two are among the most beautiful books I have ever seen. I think both
    are letter press, I suspect with a lot of foundry type, so you get to see the
    optical sizing accomplished by punch cutter Paul R\xE4disch. \r\n\r\nPaul are
    you doing the digital Cancelleresca Bastarda? I am also curious about the Romulus
    revival. There is an extensive PDF of it on the DTL site, but it still doesn't
    seem to be for sale. I still think that for Romulus to be practical, it needs
    to be mated to an appropriate JvK italic, weight adjusted. This would be in addition
    to, or maybe even replacing the not so successful sloped roman that DTL has digitized. "
