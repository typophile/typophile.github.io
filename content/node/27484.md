body: "it feels like one of those fonts i should know, like one i have at the tip
  of my tongue, yet i'm totally stumped. i've tried Identifont and MyFonts too, without
  success, which was especially surprising since it does have some fairly unique traits
  (such as the uppercase J and U).\r\n\r\noh, and i'm not looking for suggestions
  on similar fonts, i found plenty of close but not quite ones myself (such as Angie,
  Friz Quadrata, etc).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kingdom-titles_4057.png]"

  body: "thanks, Lex. i knew i could count on a typophile to solve it.\r\n\r\nand
    of course it was a font i knew, so this is definitely a slap-me-on-the-forehead
    \"duh\" moment."
