  else here seems to know how to solve. I have a collection of AI pattern brushes
  which will allow users to create some spiffy borders, just by drawing a rectangle
  and clicking\u2014which, I figure, is pretty idiot-proof, but some people CAN surprise
  you.\r\n\r\nAs I outlined in another thread which I will not link to since my last
  post with a thread got shelved for moderator approval, I had to use zero-width spacing
  lines to line up some of the elements so that they would work correctly. Which is
  cool, unless someone wants to apply a stroke to the overall pattern, which is not
  cool\u2014because, THEN, my brilliant workaround becomes ANOTHER problem.\r\n\r\nSo,
  I figure you gotta know a guy who can help me solve this little problem, since I
  also figure that the pattern works\u2014once the individual elements have been made
  into swatches\u2014without the spacers, as long as the 0,0 origin point remains
  the same. I just don't know HOW to get to the Postscript and, even if I did, if
  the Postscript is not readable by a human being\u2014which, since we are talking
  about me, is a bit of a stretch\u2014I am, have been and shall forevermore remain
  clueless about how to solve what OUGHT to be a very simple problem.\r\n\r\nSo, if
  you know a guy\u2014or even a guy who knows a guy\u2014could you clue me in, please.
  I figure I can do pretty good selling a set of 12 for about three bucks a pop, and
  all twelve for around $25 to $30.\r\n\r\nOr, maybe, even give them away if they
  have to buy SOMETHING ELSE to get them \u201Cfree\u201D. <em>Capisce?</em>"

    has done awesome border brushes, and may be able to help you."

  body: "Pablo,\r\n\r\nThanks for the tip, and\u2014if someone hasn't gotten around
    to doing so lately\u2014thanks for sharing the love. I want you to know that I
    really appreciate the wonderful tools that you offer to people, out of the kindness
    of your heart. I only wish that the people who could easily afford it\u2014like
    Apple, for instance\u2014had the same attitude. The world would be a much better
    place. Although, perhaps, not nearly as ultra-cool.\r\n\r\nKent,\r\n\r\nThanks
    for making me feel like a moron for not considering the obvious solution. And
    I am not being sarcastic: unfortunately, it appears that I need to have it pointed
    out to me, on a very regular basis, that I am not as sharp a cookie as I would
    like to think. Honestly: thanks for keeping me real, pal. Twenty-three skidoo!"

  body: "Well, the good news is, I'm here. The bad news is, this is not a problem
    I am intimately familiar with. I haven't done much work with borders, nor with
    AI pattern brushes. Though I can easily imagine a workflow for turning AI pattern
    brushes into fonts, for either bitmap or vector patterns, if that would help?\r\n\r\nAnyhow,
    it tickles me that I am sought after by name! If turning the brush patterns into
    fonts seems like a useful approach, let me know. Otherwise perhaps you should
    give the thread a title relating to the problem at hand (reposting if needed)....\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
