  responsible for maintaining a music library for the salvos.\r\n\r\nwhen she gets
  multiple copies of songs and other materials, she often needs to throw them out
  because of space... well... when i found this out i asked her if it would be possible
  to pass them along to me. so i'm often getting beautiful old music books and others
  odd pieces of paper.\r\n\r\nhere is a couple of things i recently acquired, and
  i think they are beautiful.\r\n\r\nfirst the front of a page titled 'Famous Cornet
  Solos'\r\n\r\ndoes anybody know what the sans used could be?\r\n\r\nsecond is from
  the back of that page - it looks like a beautiful piece of penmanship, but i'm unsure.\r\n\r\nthanks
  for listening\r\n\r\nbyebye - sye :)"

    or <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/sackers-gothic/">Sackers Gothic</a>
    would be pretty close to the sans.

  body: "thanks stephen! i remember seeing deuzhood a while ago, but had forgotten
    about it!\r\n\r\none thing that contactantly amazes me is people who are able
    to draw letters that look awesome, without a computer.\r\n\r\ni suck at it. in
    fact i suck even with a computer! heehee\r\n\r\ni know this sample is not the
    best blackletter drawing around, but considering it was just on the back of a
    contents page fron a music book, it seems pretty lavish.\r\n\r\n"
