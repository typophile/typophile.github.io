  time lurker, first time poster\" (not entirely true since I posted before, many
  moons ago, my membership got dropped for shall we say, \"lack of use\" and I had
  to re-sign). \r\n\r\nI turn to the gurus here for help in locating the name of this
  typeface (and perhaps where I can find it). I've searched far and perhaps not wide
  enough, to no avail.\r\n\r\nCan anyone help me identify this? Many thanks in advance.\r\n\r\n^_^\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Type-Sample_4890.gif]"

    knew it was going to be an obscure toughie, but it's for a job and the client
    apparently doesn't know the name (only has the printed piece I put up to go on.\r\n\r\n^_^"
