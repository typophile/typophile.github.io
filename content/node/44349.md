body: "Hey all. I'm looking for a font I used to have on my computer before it crashed.
  The font had only one set of letters, both upper and lower, which used parts of
  both letters. For example, the \"t\" was a straight line up, with a crossbar both
  at the top and in the middle, and a curled tail. If you need futher clarification,
  happy to provide.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

    perfectly suitable replacement. Thanks.
