body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Terminology]] : Font</strong>\r\n\r\nA font ont is
  a certain physical form in which a typeface with a certain character set is released
  by a certain vendor under a certain trade name \u2014 for example a set of metal
  type sorts, a digital font in the Type 1 format, a digital font in the OpenType
  PS format etc. Thus, a font can be said to be one weight, width, and style of a
  [[typeface]]. Times Roman by Linotype in Type 1 format is one font, Times Cyrillic
  Regular by Linotype in Type 1 format is another font, Times Roman Std by Adobe in
  OpenType format is another font, Dutch 801 Roman by Bitstream in Type 1 format is
  another font \u2014 all of the same typeface Times Roman.\r\nBefore scalable type,
  there was little distinction between the terms font, typeface, and [[family]]. Font
  and typeface still tend to be used interchangeably, although the term typeface is
  usually more correct.\r\n\r\nIn television production, \"font\" refers to information,
  such as a location or a person's name, electronically superimposed on the screen
  (hence the more common \"super\"). Also used as a verb: \"How should we font this
  guy?\" \"You supered him 'convicted criminal;' he's actually the DA.\"\r\n\r\n<strong>Discussion:</strong>\r\n<a
