  year I create a huge graphic guide to the federal budget.  You can see it here,
  \r\n\r\nhttp://thebudgetgraph.com/view/\r\n\r\nas you can see there is a lot of
  type, infact its the limiting factor interms of how much data i can put into the
  project.  Well this year I have a larger data set so I will need smaller more compact
  type.  Before I was using Helvetica Neue medium condensed at mostly 10point and
  12point for headers.  But this isn't cutting it this time.\r\n\r\nSo im looking
  for suggestions for a new font.  It needs to be condensed more than anything since
  the length of each line is what limits the design and data.  But it also has to
  be readable and breathable.  It also has to be sans serif.\r\n\r\nI was considering
  Gil Sans MT Condensed at 11point but any other suggestions would be great.\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: <a href=http://www.fontbureau.com>The Font Bureau</a> has a number of really
    complete sans-serif type families that could be useful. Antenna, Agenda, and Relay
    appear to have four widths, and Amplitude has an incredible five. Amplitude could
    be particularly good, as its pronounced ink traps could be useful in small sizes.
    Check out the many sans-serifs to be had over there -- many could be appropriate.

    mibi, show some patriotism and pick a Chinese font for crying out loud! ;-)

  body: "Ok, after running a few test prints I am going to run with Frutiger Condensed
    at 8pt.  Thanks for the suggest carlos.  It seems very open which is good when
    there is so much data and text hitting the viewer in the face.  at 8pt it still
    maintains good clarity and contrast.  Bell Centennial and trade gothic seemed
    a bit too emaciated at 8pt when its white on black.\r\n\r\nAmplitude condensed
    regular 9pt was also a contender as it will save me an extra 2mm on average. I
    might switch if I need those milimeters.  Myriad Condensed at 10pt I might use
    aswell as it saves as much space as Frutiger with a little extra height.  Anyone
    know how Myriad differs from Myriad Pro?"

    also wanted to suggest Unger. He designs alot of newspaper type, which as you
    know are usually specifically crafted for economy, while keeping legibility at
    a maximum. And, most of them are also very beautiful.\r\nIf you really need economical
    faces, I would look at something like that, instead of a condensed version of
    a 'normal' typeface, which in my eyes usually are less legible."
