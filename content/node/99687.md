    you a different recommendation from what a poster about airliners would.

    <a href=\"http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/mostranuova.html\">Mostra Nuova</a>.
    \r\n\r\nYou could also use <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itfmecanorma/bodoni/\">Bodoni
    Condensed</a> or some such thing, the idea being that its hairlines relate to
    the linearity of Carrosserie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I would go with the Bodoni; \uFB01ne-tuning the relationship between the
    weight of the headline\u2019s \u201Chairlines\u201D and the subhead\u2019s linearity
    will provide a constraint you can design against, an issue that, when resolved,
    will create harmony in your type hierarchy. Bear in mind that you can adjust the
    weight of the headline type (especially the thickness of its hairlines) by stroking
    the type outline in your layout app. You can also introduce line rules into your
    layout which play against this quality."
