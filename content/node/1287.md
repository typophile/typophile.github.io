  body: Interesting. <BR> <BR>To me it looks like a 1000x magnification of like a
    size 7-9pt helvetica/arial on screen, faux-italicized, using the Mac OS 9 rendering
    engine with atm turned off. <BR> <BR>Am I making sense? <BR> <BR>Anway. It would
    be cool to see some words. Maybe uppercase set too? <BR> <BR>r.

  body: Ryan, <BR>You are close to the idea. Letters are based on screen view of stardart
    typeface. Initially I was thinking about pseudoitalic typeface, which would be
    both clearly readable in  small sizes and primitivized, but not &#39;pixel&#39;.
    I never use Mac. Uppercase is not so &#39;compact&#39; but it still preserves
    the idea. I&#39;ll try to post the picture later.
