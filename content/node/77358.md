  company Called JeekMedia.\r\n\r\nDealing with all things in web development. From
  iphone/android apps to static html pages.\r\n\r\nI wanted to go with a real elegant
  sleek yet a small hint of geekiness. so after a week of locking in and getting things
  done this is what i came up with.\r\n\r\nHow I came up with the design is for simplicity
  I went with the Futura typeface with the \"K\" being and curly bracket used in many
  programming languages.\r\n\r\nPlease throw in your complete 2cents! thanks!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I like the idea but I'm not fond of that bracket, What typeface is used in
    programming packages? try something less stylised and more pixel-like.\r\n\r\nAre
    you going for a brand of just Jeek? or is the 'media' going to appear too? It
    would help to balance it better.....right now when looking very quickly it's looking
    like the end of the K has had a bad LSD experience. \r\n\r\nIt depends where it
    will appear but the kerning of JEE may be too tight.\r\n\r\nLike I said though
    I like the idea.\r\n\r\n"

    so much taller than the stem of K. I also like the idea of it looking pixellated.\r\n"

  body: "Dyfm:\r\n\r\nThanks for feedback.\r\n\r\nType used in many programming languages
    are your basic courier, times, etc. I tried those but was not feeling either.\r\n\r\nThe
    reason for the stylish look is because im a very stylish. So im trying to incorporate
    that into it as well.\r\nI first went with a serif font but thought it was a little
    over the top.\r\n\r\nYes I am going for a more whole branded approach with JeekMedia
    with media being close to the end of the K(bracket) giving the look as if its
    in a line of code.\r\n\r\nJustin_Ch:\r\n\r\nThanks for feedback.\r\n\r\nlol after
    walking away from it for a while and coming back it does!\r\n\r\nI made the curly
    bracket a little bit bigger because i wanted it to stand out more from the logo.\r\n\r\nI
    like the pixel idea!\r\n\r\nIm working on revisions now thanks!\r\n\r\n"

- body: "Oh, dear lord, please don't produce yet another pixelated logo for a web
    development company. It's just so overdone. The concept you have could work with
    some refinement. Don't muck it up with cliches from the 90's. \r\n\r\nPrint it
    out, in black ink only, at multiple sizes from a half inch to three inches high;
    just trust me on that. I know it seems like a useless exercise, but elegance truly
    does reveal itself in print. \r\n\r\nAll the letters are tracked too tightly,
    and the k needs special attention. The legs are too close to the stem, first of
    all. Second of all, there's no need to upscale the curly bracket to make it stand
    out -- doing so gives it a sore thumb quality. Part of the problem is the thickness
    of the bracket doesn't optically balance with the rest of the letters. Not good.
    Also -- the space where the bracket connects to the stem is awkward. It's either
    too short or too long, I'm unsure (too thin?), but it needs adjusting. \r\n\r\nFor
    this to work, remember; you're done when there's nothing left to take away and
    your message is still clear. That's the trick to great design, IMO. So, take away
    the \"oversize\" feature of the bracket because it's just not adding anything
    other than a quizzical reaction. That's not what you want....unless you sell puzzles.

  body: This is certainly distinctive! But perhaps a little bit scary. did you try
    the same concept but with different weights or different fonts?

    posting in a day or so.\r\n\r\nAnd yeah after doing some research on other firms
    I thought that pixel look was a lil overused.\r\n\r\nwill post more in morning
    thanks for all help!"
