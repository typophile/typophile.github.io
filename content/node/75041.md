body: "Hey everybody,\r\n\r\nI have made three different g's for my expletus-sans
  typeface, but I can't choose. Making an alternative might casue the user to make
  a wrong decision and I still have to decide which g to make default. the last g
  will be quite hard to convert to bold, because the gap takes in quite some space.
  Any comments are welcome!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/g's2_5809.jpg]"

  body: "Damn, now you're confusing me. Right now, the ascenders are 20 units longer
    that the descenders, but I can't change this if I go for the bottom g, because
    I simply can't vertically compress it any more without making it look ugly. Furthermore,
    I think it might be very hard to convert the bottom g to bold.\r\n\r\nThen again,
    the descenders being longer doesn't really bother me and if the bottom g looks
    \ best, why not pic that one?\r\n\r\nI was hoping I would get several comments
    with the same opinion, but this is only making it worse."

  body: "I think you should judge the glyph in context.\r\nTo my eyes, the bottom
    one, while a worthy glyph unto itself, don\u2019t plays very well with the overall
    style of the typeface. It seems to me too busy (and too much serif-like).\r\nYou
    should print some text with each option and look at the colour and flow."

    one the best fit in the overall design \u2014 the upper bowls of the double-storieds
    are just too puny (smallish) for me\u2026"

    this:\r\n\r\n1, make the upper part of the loop horizontal\r\n2, make the upper
    part of the loop slightly thicker than the bottom bit of the loop\r\n3, move the
    all bits up and tweak\r\nyou might need to make parts of the letter g thinner
    to achieve optical balance with the other glyphs\r\nAlso, that broken join, it
    may help to make it more vertical in this glyph.\r\n\r\nIf that doesn't work,
    IMO you could use the middle as default, top as alt, or reverse - depending on
    what you want."

  body: Unlike most of the above comments, I see that the top (single storied one)
    is the only one that fits with the rest of the design, but it is already hard
    to judge on such a small sample.

  body: "thaks for all your comments guys. I've made up my mind. The second is default
    and the first is alt. I've decide the last g just isn't good enough, so it's between
    the first and the second now. I guess it's just a matter of personal flavour.\r\n@brian:
    I've already tried everything. Believe me. Offcoarse it's possible to compress
    it further, but at some point it just doesn't look good anymore. I don't think
    your g is really a solution because I think the space between the upper and lower
    bowl is to small, the gap is to small and the curve next to the gap looks even
    worse than in my original. Anyway, thanks for taking some time for this. It did
    help."

    your font. I really like it. And I might pitch it to my yearbook students. I think
    they'd be pretty astonished a 14 year old did it. A rather elegant font you've
    created here.

  body: Wow! That's awesome! I have decided to really take my time with expletus so
    I'm guessing it's still about a year before the actual release, though I'm saying
    that for half a year already now, so it might become even more. I can send you
    a free (Off coarse it's free, what an honour!) version of it now, though you must
    know it's far from finished. Just mail your email adress to jasper_boy.13@hotmail.com     and
    I'll send it to you. Where do you teach?

  body: And I quite liked my example... I really can't see a problem with the space
    between the bowls (look at the space to the right where it starts to open up),
    in my example the bowls weren't equalized.

    The first g fits in with the overall design best. However, I do find the isolated

    g just doesn't look good in expletus regarding style and also looks forced into
    a too small space. I'll upload a new update on expletus with the final g soon.
    It's the middle one with some small adjustments.\r\n@yearbooker: I haven't recieved
    an email yet and I can't contact you via Typophile. Are you waiting untill it's
    finished or has something else gone wrong? "
