  body: Michael, the easiest thing to do is have the dealer contact his regional office
    and have them contact the ad agency. I&#39;m sure the ad agency gets this request
    all the time.

  body: If you need a version of the logo in EPS, you can get it <a href="http://logo.nino.ru/main/?id=525&amp;query_id=51393&amp;page=1">here</a>.
    I&#39;m also guessing it&#39;s custom, so you may have to do something complementary.
    I would strongly suggest that if you choose to do that, please don&#39;t choose
    a font that looks like the Acura font, but rather choose something that goes well
    with it without trying to copy it.

    out by the ad agency on dos and don&#39;t to maintain the consistancy between
    the broadcast and print campaigns. You don&#39;t spend millions of dollars on
    a look and feel and let a local dealer &#34;throw the baby out with the bath water&#34; '
