    artist himself</a> reveals.

  body: "Great to see that the creative lettering abilities of Frank Atkinson, Samuel
    Welo, Ross George [Speedball], Alf Becker and other great lettering artists of
    the past, are shown by a modern lettering artist like Alan Ariail. His blog seems
    to be a good source of letter design ideas.\r\nDon"

  body: "ANIMALS PASTURES CREAM is an interesting combination of influences. Very
    likely lettering. If it is a font, I don't recall it offhand. So my comments would
    apply to a matching font, if found, and to the letters themselves. My first thought
    when seeing this was that someone had taken a chiseled font like Berthold Wolpe's
    Albertus http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/albertus/ and applied the swoosh treatment
    to soften the contours and give it an \"organic\" mood. Foxtail terminals, tilde
    crossbars and mini serifs -- very bovine.\r\nDon "

    very interesting.\r\nThought it might be hand done, but figured I'd find out for
    sure.\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\nJohn"
