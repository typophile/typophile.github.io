body: "Hi\r\ni asked here few times in the past about\r\ncity /arch' typographic relation
  projects.\r\n\r\nwell its been done(few months ago), and i graduate from a design
  school\r\nand this is my final project.\r\n\r\nits mostly visual, and the texts
  that are in hebrew are some \r\narticle related(but they not the main issue.\r\n\r\nthe
  project is based on the relation between city and text \r\non its visual and content,the
  way we read and scan textual information\r\nto the way we use the city,it got some
  levels of resulotion \r\nand in a line ill sum it:we read a content and live the
  content.\r\nits not the best presentation but its the general idea.\r\n\r\nthe final
  product is a 120 pages hardcover book that describe \r\nthis textual journey|i called
  it \"reading space,a textual journey in the city\"\r\nif you find it intresting
  ive upload <a href=\"http://www.yousendit.com/transfer.php?action=download&ufid=379BD123006967E5\">a
  20mb pdf</a> that contain all the book spreads.\r\n(it look better in the book)and
  it would be nice to hear opinions.\r\n\r\nhave fun"

  body: I don't know if it is my machine, or if it is art that I am not getting, but
    there are a lot of black boxes of different sizes on various pages. Are these
    fonts that are not coming through correctly on the pdf?
