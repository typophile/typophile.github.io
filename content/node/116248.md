    believe it to be the font used on the business card...the \"@\" is a bit different
    also the numerals and italics seem to be a bit different as well..."

  body: As you can see in their <a href="http://www.papyrus.com/pdf/deCH/TermsAndConditions.pdf">PDFs</a>,
    the corporate typeface of Papyrus is Papyrus Sans. Once you look closely, it proves
    to be just a customised Stone Sans. And the @ in <a href="http://myfonts.us/td-xKTgDf">this</a>
    version looks exactly like the one on the business card.

  body: "Interesting to see that the newer [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/stone-sans-ii/|Stone
    Sans ii]] uses the Roman '@' for the italics face,  unlike the older the basic
    Stone Sans that R. linked.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
