  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I'm working on desiging (or starting to design) a signage system for a college, specifically for a particular building which used to be an office building, and so has lots of hallways and suites, and now classrooms. I don't really know where to begin. Can anyone recommend resources to refer to when developing a signage system of this sort? Anything I should keep in mind besides the basic legibility and such, particularly when choosing a typeface? Thanks!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I really don't have much experience designing sign systems themselves. I've only done one signage project ever, and it was only temporary. <BR> <BR>As far as typefaces go, the requirements for internal signage for an academic environment would be quite different form say an airport or a highway. For room labels, I dare say, would not be that much different than designing for print, say a poster. But for larger signs, those that would be read from a fair distance, as a rule, would need more space between letters than for print. What looks perfectly alright close up would appear much tighter when seen from a distance, hampering legibility greatly. Counters generally have to be large and open, again for legibility reasons. I'm afraid I don't have figures to support my arguments, or any hard and fast rules in terms of scale and how much the spacing should be. The best bit of advice I could give would be: always test at actual size. Do test prints, hang them up in the hallways, step back and see how well they read. That's essential. <BR> <BR>For a much more empricial approach, you should contact James Montalbano, who designed Clearview for US highways. He would be a much more appropriate person to ask for advice. He gave the most fascinating presentation at TypeCon. Are you around, James? <BR> <BR>Johnathan, maybe you would be interested in looking at Paul Mijksenaar's work? <a href="http://www.mijksenaar.com/index2.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.mijksenaar.com/index2.html">http://www.mijksenaar.com/index2.html</a></a> <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">To answer Hrant's questions: <BR> <BR>No, I don't need to respect any previous signage, because until now it's all been very inconsistent and not very good. There is, however, a new trademark: <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/14202.gif" alt=""> which uses ITC New Baskerville and a bit of another face. The signage may or may not incorporate this logo. This is a Bible college, and so all the majors at this point are Biblical studies and training for pastors and that sort of thing. Therefore I'd like a look which conveys an idea of ancient sacred dignity or something like that.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Although it is the 'corporate' face for the college, I don't think Baskerville would be an appropriate choice for a signage system. The contrast is too high and the type too feeble to function well as a signage type. <BR> <BR>The 'corporate' face for the Vancouver Public Library system is Didot, and, believe it or not, that's what they use for all their architectural lettering and signage across the system! It's bloody hard to read! The hairlines almost disappear! <BR> <BR>It sure would be nice to use something that subtly convey 'ancient sacred dignity' in one way or another, but I feel that it need not be a serif type. Have you seen the new Anglican service books? They use Gill Sans in black and red they they look very diginified and religious. Yet modern. It's a great design, IMHO. <BR> <BR>I have a semi-sans that might work well for this project, but unfortunitely it hasn't been produced yet :-P</div>
