  body: your sample is a little too small to tell, but it&#39;s very similar to HTF
    knockout.

  body: Alright. Alright. It was late. I was tired. I thought it would be nice to
    promote the new typeface. No need to be suspicious. It is me, after all, not some
    random person selling yarn made from dog fur. :^P When I come across a typeface
    that reminds me of an old thread I'll usually go back and add my suggestion. It
    just happens that this time I did it quite a few times. And besides, who cares
    if an old thread is revived? Did it cause a ripple in your life today? :^P
