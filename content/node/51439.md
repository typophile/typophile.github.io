body: "I've been looking around the forums, and don't see a place specifically set
  aside to discuss the Typophile web site itself. Although the Typophile site is maintained
  by Punchcut, I can't find any reference as to whom one should address questions/concerns
  about the site.\r\n\r\nIs the preference to include such topics in the \"General
  Discussions\" forum? Would it make sense to have a separate \"Typophile Web Site\"
  topic in the \"Special Interests\" forum?\r\n\r\nThe sort of posts that I'm thinking
  about would be items such as the following:\r\n\r\nSingle Open Quotes: When using
  a single open quote in a comment, the \"SmartyPants\" function always returns a
  single close quote that looks like this: 'This is the wrong quote opening quote
  mark.' It is possible to get around this by embedding a HTML tag for a single open
  quote, but in a web site full of fussy, fussy typographers and type designers (fussy
  in a good way), shouldn't this be fixed?\r\n\r\nOn the opening page of the Typophiles
  site, there is a summary of postings titled \"Handpicked,\" which until today I
  have assumed was an accurate title. However, today the first listing in this category
  is: \"Technorati Profile (ignore this post, to be deleted),\" -- so it would appear
  that the items listed are in fact NOT handpicked, but somehow machine generated.
  Should the title of this listing be changed to more accurately reflect how the posting
  are chosen?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Typophile Handpicked_6485.PNG]"

    for feedback:\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/contact\r\n\r\nFor discussing typophile
    bugs and (missing/desired) features in public, I guess it is just fine to start
    a thread like this in the general section.\r\n\r\nAFAIK, the Handpicked section
    is handpicked indeed. The thread to be ignored was published by [[Joseph Pemberton|Joe
    Pemberton]], who is one of the founding partners both of Punchcut and Typophile.
    Hence I assume he is just testing something.\r\n\r\nFor the \u2018single quotes\u2019:
    how do you input them?\r\n\r\nF "

  body: "Sorry I missed the contact link at the bottom of the page. I wonder if it's
    just me, or do others also often miss stuff shown only at the very bottom of a
    web page? I would prefer a link higher on the page (perhaps at the very top along
    with the other options) -- but I agree, it's my fault for not scrolling down all
    the way.\r\n\r\nThanks for the confirmation that the items listed in the Handpicked
    section are, in fact, handpicked. I guess I still don't understand why that particular
    item would have been picked to appear there -- but it's not a big deal.\r\n\r\nFor
    single quotes, I simply use the apostrophe key for both opening and closing single
    quotes. I know that there are specific key combinations that can be used to specify
    a single opening (and closing) quote, but many programs, such as MS Word, generally
    have no problem translating the apostrophe mark correctly when converting to them
    \"smart quotes.\" SmartyPants manages to convert double quotes correctly -- but
    for some reason doesn't handle single opening quotes well."

  body: Yes, the opening quote has been the wrong one for a long time now. I think
    since the last redesign of the site/forum. Not really important, but kinda ironic
    for a website about (good) typography. ;)

  body: "Clint - thanks for your feedback. You are welcome to send us an email using
    the Feedback link, and of course there is always the forums to discuss these issues.
    We, at Typophile, may not always participate in the threads, but we are listening
    and are actively addressing issues like this that arise.\r\n\r\n<cite>Thanks for
    the confirmation that the items listed in the Handpicked section are, in fact,
    handpicked. I guess I still don\u2019t understand why that particular item would
    have been picked to appear there \u2014 but it\u2019s not a big deal.</cite>\r\n\r\nAs
    Florian said, the the \"handpicked\" list is actually handpicked. We use it as
    a way to surface topics we find interesting that may not be getting a lot of visibility
    otherwise. As for the Technorati thread, honestly I have no idea what that is
    about. I think Joe must be doing some sort of experiment. :)"
