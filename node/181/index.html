  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Ok, so making continuous optical adjustments to the individual character widths in a typeface I'm working on is taking forever. Is there a more <i>scientific</i> way of doing it than looking at the letters in context (words, text), making (subjective) judgements about their legibility, adjusting accordingly and then repeating the cycle? <BR> <BR>There seems to be an (inate?) optimal width for each glyph. If a glyph is too wide it <i>looks wrong</i> and is distracting. This <i>sense</i> of what is ideal is what I'm trying to use as a benchmark against which to make adjustments. But isnt that a bit too subjective? <BR> <BR>Where does this sense come from? Have our eyes just become accustomed to reading letters at a certain width, or is there an actual optimal width at which each character imparts its information and can thereby be recognisable? (Perhaps related to the number of vertical strokes in a chracter, for example) <BR> <BR>How does you design legibility (as regards charcter widths specifically) into an original typeface? Is it just optical adjustments or is there a more objective way? <BR> <BR>je</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Jumping in as a relative newcomer: <BR> <BR>An important factor might be where in the spectrum from classical proportions to monospaced proportions a typeface lies. <BR> <BR>A classical font like Trajan is built on the forms of the circle, the square, and the triangle. The result is that some letters, like O and C (based on the circle) are twice as wide as letters like E and L (based on two squares). <BR> <BR>With a typeface like DIN, on the other hand, all letters strive to look the same width. <BR> <BR>There's plenty of room in between, but I expect that the classical proportions should give you a good idea of relative widths between letters. Applying this to lowercase might be another matter. <BR> <BR>Paul</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Indeed, there seem to be two models of UC width: the Classical with its great divergence*, and what might be called the Modern with its convergence. But I'm not sure how much there is in between. You do see some faces with a letter or two deviating from the Classical (like the wide &quot;S&quot; of Will Carter and sometimes Zapf, and a wide &quot;E&quot;/&quot;F&quot; here and there), but I can't think of any that deviate much from the Modern - I guess that would look totally lousy. What I'm saying is that your caps have to either diverge a lot or not at all**. Makes sense? <BR> <BR>* Although I'm not sure how strong the geometric basis is. <BR> <BR>** The only exception I can think of is Nick Shinn's fascinating Richler. <BR> <BR>So Jos</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Back to the original issue: <BR> <BR>&gt; There seems to be an (inate?) optimal width for each glyph. <BR> <BR>It seems that the optimal width for a given character is a value that can be deviated from safely, upto a point. This point depends on the sensibilities of the viewer (which is subjective). Furthemore, the deviation can be controlled to make the font more dynamic. However, the <i>set</i> of deviations might have to be consistent, otherwise the harmony is too deep, and it will be seen as discord by practically everybody. What I mean is you can't make half the UC Classical and the other Modern. <BR> <BR>As for what the &quot;ideal&quot; is, I would say it depends on the structure of the glyph. One obvious example is the &quot;B&quot; versus the &quot;D&quot;: the former is narrower because you can't make half-size bowls look nice that wide. But it's not so simple because a &quot;B&quot; with bowls of [roughly] equal height can't be as wide as one with a large lower bowl. <BR> <BR>So there might be a way to quantify the optimal widths of characters by first quantifying their structure, <i>but</i> taste is subjective, so you could only do that for a given person (and really only at a given instant). So what you could do is make a set of caps where the widths please you personally, then make variations of certain characters (like make a &quot;B&quot; with a lower/higher middle) and see how that affects your ideal width, and formulate some numbers for future use. So the next time you make a font, you can draw a single character and &quot;propagate&quot; the ideal widths of all the others, based on their other structural determinants. Once you have the set of ideal widths, you would work inwards. <BR> <BR>To avoid making the solution too personal, you could do this to a &quot;classic&quot; face. For example, you could take the Trajan &quot;B&quot;, lower the middle, see how its ideal width changes, and use that dataset as the guide for a new font. <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR> <BR>This is exactly the sort of thread I think type design needs most now. So I hope many people brainstorm about it and delve deeply towards its warm core. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; Time for something else. <BR> <BR>I'm all for that! <BR> <BR>But just to make sure: we <i>are</i> talking about the widths <BR>that glyphs conform to, right?

Hmmm&hellip; What about this: <BR> <BR>Since letters are put together to form words, and we can appreciate the way a word sets as much as the way a letter sits, the set of optimal widths in a writing system depends on linguistics. If the Classical widths are seen as optimal for ancient Roman inscriptions (in Latin), they simply can't be seen as optimal for a contemporary novel. So maybe we need a new set of widths? <BR> <BR>That said: <BR>1) There are -as I'm fond of stating- two strands of reading: deliberative (where you can consciously appreciate shapes) versus immersive (where your reading &quot;firmware&quot; takes over, and doesn't care how sexy that finial is).

		<div class="commentbody">I found something. An article in the 1968 Penrose Annual (which I actually mentioned in the &quot;Trapping&quot; thread) by Louis Rosenblum, where he's devised a system to standardize the measure of the relative widths of text fonts. The apparent aim being to be able to predict layout and/or save on storage (remember: 1968). <BR> <BR>Rosenblum's style is very terse (he's an engineer by training), so I'm not exactly sure, but it looks like he's taken measurements of many &quot;classic&quot; fonts and arrived at average relative widths: <BR> <BR>Lowercase: <BR> 5: i <BR> 6: f j l <BR> 7: r s t <BR> 8: z e c <BR> 9: q g x a o <BR>10: n h u d p b k y v <BR>13: w <BR>15: m <BR> <BR>Uppercase: <BR> 8: I <BR> 9: J <BR>10: S <BR>11: Z <BR>12: P L F <BR>13: Q O A V B T E C <BR>14: G U Y R <BR>15: N H X D K <BR>18: M W <BR> <BR>Numerals: 9 units. <BR> <BR>One strange thing is that for a given width the letters listed aren't alphabetical. But there must be a reason behind their orders. My guess is that they're listed in increasing statistical divergence from the given width. <BR> <BR>Rosenblum also ties the TTS width system into the discussion, but I couldn't follow that well enough. <BR> <BR>One last thing <BR>In pointing out that metal fonts have smaller sizes that are proportionally wider and darker than the larger ones (optical scaling), he says that's due to practical manufacturing concerns! I'd never heard that before. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>
