body: Hi there, <BR>I would appreciate any advice in choosing a font to complement
  the rough graphic below. My client is a new bar/restaurant that hopes to create
  a sophisticated, yet unintimidating image. The typeface cannot be too stylized or
  retro but must be capable of standing alone without the graphic.  <BR> <BR>Any suggestions?

    sites where I could test out this font? <BR> <BR>Ciara

  body: "Ah right. Hmm. Well anyway I don&#39;t think Costa is right anyway. The graphic&#39;s
    contrast is much higher than Costa&#39;s contrast &#40;thick and thin&#41;. Does
    your client not like your choices so far? What other typefaces have you shown
    them? Maybe you should look at H&amp;FJ&#39;s <a href=\"http://www.typography.com/catalog/gotham/index.html\"
    target=\"_blank\">Gotham</a>\u2014Near to zero contrast, could compliment without
    being overtly decorative. Also has an oblique companion and a good variety of
    weights. Your graphic, it seems to me, won&#39;t work with the new square-din
    style sans, nor will it work with anything grotesque or humanist. Although I did
    think you had used Franklin there and so maybe a Grotesque is exactly what you
    need."

  body: Hi guys, <BR>Took Tiffany&#39;s advice and tried out Gotham and Grotesque
    results below. Please ignore kerning etc. Entire logo still very rough. I&#39;m
    presenting to my client, a construction crew and a group of architects. They like
    the graphic but lots of conflicting comments on choice of font. So suffering from
    creative block at the moment and really appreciate the professional advice. <BR>
    <BR>Paul let me know if you can now view the logo. <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Ciara

  body: Hi Stefan, <BR>Thanks for the advice. Managed to only try out Stalemate with
    Veer &#40;see 4&#41;. Agree with Steve, think 1 and 3 are strongest but 4 looks
    less retro. They hope to attract a trendy crowd along with soccer and domestic
    sports fans &#40;not that sports fans aren&#39;t trendy&#41;. The interior is
    quite sophisticated and streamlined. This in mind I don&#39;t think a retro feel
    hurts but my clients are label savvy, Prada wearing people and I feel veering
    more on the contemporary. Hence the stylized option &#40;3&#41;. Yet, there&#39;s
    concerns that the logo may date. <BR> <BR>Which logo do you think is strongest
    based on the above? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/56894.jpg"

  body: '#1 is definitely the strongest <i>and</i> the most streamlined. Any <BR>time
    you overlap halftones with text in a logo you&#39;re looking for <BR>trouble.
    It&#39;s so difficult to keep an eye on every printing instance <BR>that your
    logo may be caught in a situation where the halftones <BR>are too dark and the
    restaurant name is obscured. Go with #1, <BR>besides being the most versatile,
    the type matches the symbol  <BR>well and can be either &#39;60s chic or contemporary.'
