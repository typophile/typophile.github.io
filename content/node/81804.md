  in the state logo, see attached. At first I thought it might be a custom letter
  job, but then there are some similarities with the [now defunct] eurostar typeface.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/explorega_logo_cmyk_v_rwebaddress_md_4740.jpeg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/eurostar-advert-187526_3816.jpeg]\r\n\r\nAnyone
  have any insight? Thanks!"
