		<div class="commentbody">Computers are the most loyal, devoted pieces of machinery ever invented. They only do exactly what they are instructed to do. The programmers that gave crappy instructions are where to place the blame. AT&T just took over Bellsouth, the company that provides my service. Somehow, without letting anyone know, they switched email servers. That wasted a few dozen hours of my time troubleshooting what was wrong with my machine before I found out, thanks to the internet, that it wasn't my machine. It was them. The hilarious part is that after a few weeks of asking them what they did that caused the problem, they sent back a response with very basic instructions for how to send an email — something I have been doing quite successfully for a couple of decades before they came along. The problem still isn't fixed. But at least I can send an email with an attachment again.

Paul if you really want to give it up though, I think I have some rubylith somewhere around here I'll give you a deal on — xactos, triangles, blue leads, and some other dust collectors too.</div>

I once worked all night on a single-article issue of a science journal in order to FedEx it to the publisher for a rush get-out issue. Somewhere right around daybreak I did my last Save and PageMaker, bless its pointed little head, sent me a Bad Record Index error, would not save, wiped the article from my hard drive, and rendered my copies of the article useless the same way.

I was about to put my fist thru the computer’s screen—this was in the CRT monitor days until I thought better of it.</div>

I might as well say I hate electronic drum sets with a passion. I will never play again with anyone using that kind of set up. It's worse than playing with someone who only knows how to play rock, imo.

Hmm... let me think about that one Paul. Keith Moon - a rotting putrid corpse long buried beneath the soil, along with it's hopes and dreams - OR - a drum machine.

I'll take the drum machine ;)

In any given week I'll go through at least one sketch book (100 pages). And on the 'puter in the same week, I'll throw down about 10-15 pdfs. I'll also pull in about 30-50 scans into my 'work', and about same amount (or more) source material from the www. My brain is one long friggin jam session of impluse/action/reaction.

I'm with you.

Bra-VO! It amazes me how much I can get done, and how fast I can do it, on a Macbook Pro. Core Duo at a time when RAM prices are amazingly low is an awesome thing, and most apps barely use it. But watching Photoshop max out box cores makes me just for the day when I have a quad-core laptop and just about everything is multi-threaded.</div>

Today we have a lot more reasons to upgrade. There was a time when most upgrades were driven by video games because the machines were so slow that performance increases were barely relevant to running anything else. Now performance increases can be pretty astounding, and having enough cheap RAM to keep all of one’s pertinent applications running in concert makes extra CPU cycles a lot more useful.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">How is the forgery business these days Gary ("my computer enables me to MAKE money")?

My first machine was an Amiga running Deluxe Paint. I remember reproducing pictures like the first Batman poster pixel by pixel (actually individually rendering each). I was around 12-14 and had already built a name for myself internationally as a Deluxe Paint pro-user (my learning curve was steeper and competition was only a few guys Germany and the UK). Aaahhh, the love of running home to your computer after school and staying until your mum told you to go to bed, then sneak up and play some more with pixels and hues.

I'm not to sure I hate computers. They are a great tool. Email on the other hand is what's killing our industry. It's so easy for that marketing exec to send out on his way from the office: I need this on my desk tomorrow morning. Leaving you to work through the night. If you only had a phone they would actually have to talk to you and you could decide to pick up or not if the time was 5 min. to 4 and you had plans for the night. These days everyone expects you to read their email even if it's after hours. Not to mention all the time spent on reading and writing them. Instead of collating information and provide a proper written brief things comes in pieces often several times only slightly adjusted each time just enough so you have to read it again. AAAaaaarrrrggghhh.
Bloody emails and mobile phones. Give me back the days prior to speed dial!</div>

I still don’t understand why so many people put up with that attitude. I can understand why all my lawyer friends put up with it—they get paid hundreds of thousands of dollars a year and everything from individual freedom to massive corporations depends on their work. But for a design salary (and rates) people should be happy that anyone reads their email at all, much less after five PM. Try getting a plumber to do any work after hours for what a designer gets paid and one will likely learn what a wrench tastes like.</div>

I remember going to a friend's house in (probably) 1978 and seeing an Apple II for the first time. It was an amazing thing. I remember writing BASIC programs on TRS-80s in the computer lab in junior high. (Ugh, I was a computer geek!)

Then my mom, great mother that she is, bought us our own Apple II and we spent a couple years playing Castle Wolfenstein, and Zork, and The Wizard And The Princess, and Star Maze, and Choplifter...

		<div class="commentbody">I remember all of these old guys working at the sign shops that could take "One Shot" paint and paint the most fantastic letters. Those vinyl plotters put them out of business. 

I also remember the first demonstration I saw of digital photography around 1989. The camera was a huge video camera. It was plugged into a big computer and monitor. The photo  took about five minutes as the red, green and blue channels each panned through their individual scans. Then it took another five minutes or so for the CPU to process the image. Needless to say still shots were all that could be taken. I think that camera cost something like $30,000. The little pocket cameras you can buy for a couple of hundred dollars today take a picture ten times better and a thousand times faster. 

I won't forget the reaction when I told the photo labs that they'd better start establishing a digital base. They completely discounted it saying, "there is no way a digital image can ever compete against continuous tone film photography." </div>

I was hand cutting vynil and Rubylith films for a screen printing company in about '82 or '83, when I saw the first digital plotter for cutting vynil and Rubylith. It was so slow and could only cut arcs in something like 3.6 degree increments... I thought - "These things will NEVER replace a skilled guy like myself" :-)</div>
