  body: "The lowercase \"a\" is very similar to the lowercase \"d.\" I'm guessing
    the original pre-digital ITC version was slightly different than the digitized

  body: The digital version has missed out the alternates of the original. My Letraset
    catalogue shows two different a's, e's, f's, k's, r's, s's, t's, z's, E's and
    L's.

    Sorry the scan didn't reduce very well. Hope this is clear enough.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SerifGothic_5219.png]"
