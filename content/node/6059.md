  body: Avoiding the question of the legality of what you&#39;re doing &#40;my feeling
    is that Apple do not allow the conversion of their fonts&#41;.  <BR> <BR>What
    exactly are you trying to do and why? Also what version of FL are you using and
    on which platform. A guess is that you might need Asia Font Studio to mess with
    an E. Asian font. FL has a 6,400 char limit. <BR> <BR>Cheers, Si
