  body: No idea, but it entered Unicode in version 1.1, which indicates that it most

    is U+2101 and is called \"Addressed to the Subject\". There is also \u2100 (account
    of), \u2105 (care of), and \u2106 (cada una [which means \"each one\" in Spanish,
    I believe]).\r\n\r\nI don't know their derivations."
