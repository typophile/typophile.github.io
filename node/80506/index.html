As for the calligraphic one, I think you should look at how you want the transitions between thick and thin to be (for example, the bottom right part of 'a' is quite different from the rest in this regard).
Start experimenting with more letters, 'n', for a start.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nice start! There are some special features here that bear developing.

That's an unusual set of serifs on the u, how does it read at small sizes? Also considering the right-leaning stem, which again is unusual.

The comparatively short x-height serifs and large, flat baseline serifs of glyphs like i and n gives them a very bottom-heavy appearance, is that the idea?

Does r actually have a heavier baseline serif than the rest of the glyphs, and in that case why?

The o looks rather light compared to many of the other glyphs with their thick serifs, have you considered a more clarendonesque one? Same, to a certain extent, with the v and w - compare to that big, chunky l in vowel.

Finally, I'd agree that the a in its current, rather calligraphic state doesn't really fit the rest of the typeface.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks so much for the comments Birdseeding - I've been playing with these glyphs in Illustrator at the moment, as they originated from a drawing a made and I like the bezier curves so much more than in FontLab.  That said, it's very imperfect for creating a typeface and it's hard to create perfect consistency - I'm going to migrate these glyphs into FontLab soon, where it will be easy to ensure this.

The right-leaning stem of the 'u' and the heavier baseline serif of the 'r' are just mistakes :)  I'll change them soon and get back to you!

It's been tough navigating the space between didone, garalade, and bracketed slab serif! This typeface is hopefully going to fill an interesting space in that spectrum, but I want it to be consistent.  How can I change the 'a' to make it fit? I agree that it's calligraphic - I would love for the other letterforms to reflect that aesthetic without turning it into a true garalde - any advice?

Thanks again!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I quite like the high contrast in letters like m and n, where the bowl meets the stem. It gives a slight human touch to it and make it more unique. However, you should also incorporate this in the rest of the font, or get rid of it. 

The terminal in /a/ could be moved to the left slightly. It looks a bit forced now. Also the tail looks a bit sharp in comparison to the t.

Redesign the r with the n as a starting point. It looks quirky where it meats the stem.

The o is too light. Make the curves on the inside more round (less square), and the curves on the outside more full (more square).

The g's ear is still too short and it looks as if you stole the g from a different typeface. It has that special kind of ink traps typical for geralde typefaces, but it doesn't fit in with the other letters you designed.

Something about the t doesn't quite work. The top looks too much like a cross I think. Try to give it a human touch.

Raise the dot on i slightly. It looks a bit cramped now.

Most importantly, the serifs on the top of stems in n m d b etc, should show a link to how they would look in a garalde typeface. Make them slightly wider where they meet the stem, or something like that. Just try out as many different versions as you can think of.

Keep going! It's a charming concept. In my opinion much more so than the sans serif you're working on.

Cheers!

		<div class="commentbody">Hey, thanks Jasper!  I agree completely with your comments.  The 'g' wasn't taken from another typeface, but I agree that it looks too "garalde." I tweaked some of the serifs on the top of the stems, making them a bit chunkier, and also more human. I also widened the 'a' and rebuilt the 'r' from your suggestion, and I'm quite happy with it!

I attached a pdf specimen for closer inspection.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Haha, great suggestion Gary! So you're telling me it needs more machine, and Jasper is telling me it needs to look more human.  Who do I trust? ;)

I agree that the strength is finding that intersection between the machined and the calligraphic - that was the original idea. But how do I best achieve that? Which serifs and terminals should be perfect, and which should be imperfect?

		<div class="commentbody">yes we do love our comments no I was just looking at the /a/ and it has that curving baseline terminal so typical of old face types. But if you look at Palatino /a/ it has that firm baseline serif. Something like this maybe

		<div class="commentbody">I'll try that, thanks!  What about the terminals of the c, y, s, and j (which I haven't created yet)? How should those relate?

Also, what do you think of the new 'g'? I tried to make the bowl flatter, with less stroke contrast, like the 'g's of Clarendon/Sentinel. Do you think it works with the rest of the characters, and without the quirky peacock-style ear?

		<div class="commentbody">Now that some aspects of the typeface have been settled, consistency may speak for itself. Right now teardrop terminals seem more appropriate, but you should take in account that the forms are not as many as to avoid elasticity in the design process. Even after you have picked out a feature for your forms, force yourself to reconsider it after some time, my advice. Drawing letterforms on a paper sheet (in opposition to working "ex tempore" on the screen) is also very helpful to come up with new ideas.

From my point of view, the clarendonian 'g' doesn't echo the aspects of the other letterforms. Try to fix it; the thin of the bowl extends to much, for instance. Also the link of the loop should be thicker to flow nicely into the horizontal.

Other observations:
- Check the thin of your 'o'. Right now it looks like a lining zero (so recycle it (: ). It is therefore too wide and round to work as an 'o'.
- The upper serif of the 'i' needs a bit of lengthening.

What happened to your original 'a'? I think it had an interesting vitality. Your revised one is also good, nevertheless. Keep up!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">When I altered your photoshop image I agree that the resulting a is a little too mechanical in comparison with your original.
I'm looking at your original and I see a nice font except for e and g . The e has that venetian style cross bar which doesn't look good or suit the font. It looks like the e is tilted. And I agree with Lex that the loop of the g is too wide, and o is very monoline.  Need to see a few more caps.  ;-)  Keep going </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks guys! I've worked on this a bit this weekend, and will have an update with an improved 'g,' 'e,' and 'o' tonight :)

Lex, I loved my original 'a'! It didn't quite work, though, unfortunately - maybe I can recycle it into another, more classical garalde typeface.</div>
