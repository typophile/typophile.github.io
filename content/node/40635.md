  body: "appreciated really a lot.\r\nWell i just need to know anything.\r\nThe objective
    of the work is to know about the typeface. Everything i can.\r\nI have to do a
    presentation to my teacher Dino dos Santos saying what i know from the clarendon
    and Robert Besley off course, actually i have to tell everything related to clarendon.
    See what kind of work do i have to do/show? Obviously images are really welcome.\r\nI've
    seen already the Paulo Heitlinger book named \"Tipografia\" but it doesn't say
    much. I tried already to speak with Oxford Press that from what i know is one
    of the responsibles but i didn't have reply.\r\n\r\nCan you help me please?"

    Typophile, right? He's watching your <em>every move</em>.\r\n\r\nYou might want
    to shoot an email to the Canada Type folks, since they just released a new text
    version of Clarendon. I'm sure they dug up some stuff about it that they'd like
    to share.\r\n\r\n@David R\r\nYou interested in contributing your findings to the
    Typowiki? That would be a good resource."

  body: "ok i don't mind to contribute. Yes i know, this website was brought to me
    by him. Thanks for all the help. And even if i don't have time to present the
    stuff from Canada Type i learned to love the typeface so... i'll try it anyway.\r\n\r\nThe
    course is really fine, i'm doing communication design, graphic design, and i'm
    loving it just loving it. Already worked for some time but it is getting me really
    important notions especially on the tipography that i didn't give the honour it
    deserves.\r\n\r\nAbout Dino's classes, yeah, i'm liking it he thinks that we think
    that is a bore class but i'm loving it, even with all the work we have to do and
    all the sweat.\r\nHe has made a blog for us http://estudostipografia.wordpress.com/
    if you want to check it out.\r\n\r\nDo you \"love\" any typeface? Keep on posting..\r\nPeople,
    the work is done but i would like you to keep sending stuff about clarendon because
    as i said, i'm getting in love for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "So i'll translate the theoretic work i've made to be an auxiliary for my
    presentation for this work, even not being request, as i said, i learned to love
    Clarendon ehehe.\r\n\r\nEgyptians came with, from the word of historians like
    James Mosely, the hands of the \" tablets ads\" (i don't know the english word,
    it is the place that is supposed to be the name of the bar, place, store...) painters,
    very used for pubs and inns, that's why the egyptians were very amused in United
    Kingdom. The typefaces from that time, like Bodoni or Didot, wouldn't have enough
    visibility for the purpose. So, the real objective of the so called egyptian typefaces
    was to offer excelent visibility e that could be easily scaled to big dimensions
    (like an add, it is pratically impossible to do this on the natural materials
    (i think it was steel, i think that's the english word please help me on these
    words) because of the weight that each character would have).\r\n\r\nRegistered
    in 1845, still on the name of the Thorowgood & Co ( the \"Co\" was Robert Besley),
    it appeared the Clarendon. The first typeface being registered, the future of
    the type designers was being written here may i say. The enterprise bought the
    Fann Street Foundry (Fann Street Foundry was founded by Robert Thorne in 1794,
    especialized in making typefaces with strong serifs, mechanical forms. Typefaces
    named egyptians.) and 4 years later Thorowgood as retired and so it changed the
    name to Besley & Co (the \"Co\" now, was Benjamin Fox) and that's why we most
    of the times say as being a Besley's typeface but from what i searched and saw,
    the real clarendon designer was Thorowgood.\r\nJust for curiosity, later, Robert
    Besley as became Lord Mayor of London.\r\n\r\nSo... how did someone remembered
    to do the Clarendon typeface?\r\nThe Clarendon was developed from a bug! On the
    print, some times it didn't print so well and so the final work would have some
    blurs and too much tint ( please the word for this :D) some kind of \"bolding\"
    but it wasnt purposed on this time. The concept idea of Bold comes with this \"bug\"
    when someone remembered to do a typeface from this \"bug\" so it could be an auxiliary
    item of the design. The born of Clarendon. Its \"boldish\" design and the still
    beautiful typeface design could help the designer to make hierarchies on the text,
    doing the diference between the so Clarendon and the roman types. \r\nThe letters
    of Clarendon are pretty close to a perfect square, something i've seen when i
    drew by hand the typeface (later i can post some photos if you want) and at the
    same time it was a squared and mechanical, Clarendon typeface still a beautiful
    typeface, even for the time.\r\n\r\nNow we can see Revivals of clarendon like
    Candida from Jakob Erbar and the digital editions from Linotype or Monotype (done
    in 1935).\r\n\r\nThe Clarendon was used on the United States traffic signs, later
    replaced by Rawlinson Roadway.\r\n\r\nThe original Clarendon can be found at the
    \"Type Museum of London\".\r\n\r\nAbout photos, i can send them later if someone
    is interested.\r\n\r\nPlease, don't let \"Clarendon\" die and help me knowing
    more about this type and so, keep on sending stuff.\r\nNick Shinn has done a wonderful
    job on the node he told me. See it too.\r\n\r\nJoel Santos // youremin\r\nsound

  body: "I like your \"bug\" theory, Joel!\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nClarendon was not the
    first bold, as we understand the concept.\r\nUpdike, in <em>Printing Types</em>
    (plate 310, 2nd edition, 1937) reproduces three samples of Bodoni's Ducale size
    of type, three different weights, as shown in Bodoni's <em>Manuale</em> of 1818.\r\n\r\nIt's
    hard to assess the influence of Bodoni's work, as his types were not used commercially,
    but I suspect that other European type founders would have been familiar with
    it."

  body: "I see... i thought that Clarendon was the first one to be used as the bold
    we know today, i didn't say it was the first one or if i did it wasn't what i
    meant to.\r\n\r\nAbout bug theory i read it somewhere but if we think about it
    ... there is some logical aspects about that. Even the squared typeface if we
    see well that bug but i wouldn't go so far. But even though, i think i've never
    seen that Bodoni, ok, i don't know much about type or types but...\r\nAbout the
    European type founders, well, if we see... the Clarendon was registered just 30
    years plus and no one could use something like Clarendon but when the registering
    ended, from what i read, people got excited and started doing some kind of \"Clarendon\"
    too.\r\nAs i said i'm still an ignorant on the matter I am just using my ignorance
    crossed with what i read.\r\n\r\nOh, sorry but i've searched your name, i'm adicted
    on information ehehe. Nice fonts. I'm on other threads maybe you can help me on
    the other ones too... One is about font recognising and the other is about my
    new respect for the types and i would like to do something... it is better to
    see the thread... if you wouldn't mind.\r\n\r\nJoel Santos // youremin\r\nsound
