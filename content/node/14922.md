  in different browsers.  Everything looked fine on IE6, IE5.5, FF, and Opera on the
  PC, but when I had it tested in Safari on the Mac, I noticed that the machine didn't
  have Georgia at all and the text was rendered in Times instead.  This got me thinking,
  how common is Georgia on the Mac?  I did some research and found out that it seems
  to be bundled with the newest versions of OSX and IE on Mac.\r\n\r\nMy question
  is this: What font should I substitute Georgia with for those users that don't have
  it?  I'm thinking of some a seriffed face with a large x-height and a big appearance
  like Georgia does.  This would have to be a standard Mac font that has been bundled
  with OS's for the last 5-10 years.  A Scotch roman would be perfect.  But anything
  with a large x-height that comes bundled with the Mac will work.  Times looks so
  small compared with Georgia.\r\n\r\nThis is how it would be styled:\r\n<code>font-family:
  georgia, mac-font, serif;</code>\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n"

    have Georgia. However if you're looking for another common mac serif font you
    could try Hoefler Text.\r\n\r\nOf course, now that I just reread your large x-height
    requirement I'd say that Hoefler probably won't do."

  body: "Tiffany,\r\n\r\nI don't know too much about the Safari browser setup since
    I'm screenshots from an online service.  I'm just using one stylesheet since fonts
    aren't really browser-specific, and no plug-ins at all.\r\n\r\nMy problem pretty
    much is that there's no good standard serif to subsitute Georgia with on those
    machines that is missing the font since everything else looks pretty tiny in comparison.
    \ A six-line paragraph would be only about 4 lines when you use Times, Baskerville,
    or other standard seriffed text fonts.  What would be ideal is to increase the
    size of the text from let's say 11px to 12px for any other font than Georgia.\r\n\r\nSo
    we'd have something like:\r\n<code>Georgia 11/16 or Times 12/16</code>\r\n\r\nAnd
    this isn't possible using regular CSS and I don't want to use SIFR, or anything
    like that.  So I guess I have to assume that most users have Georgia, and if they
    don't the text will be a bit smaller."

    XP.  In Photoshop I need to have 12px TNR for a paragraph of text to be as long
    as 11px Georgia (I tried different anti-alias modes; single line composer; no
    optical kerning).  But doing the same experiment in IE6 using CSS, I needed 15px
    TNR to cover the same length as a paragraph of text in Georgia 11px (TNR was taller
    but as wide).\r\n\r\nI used pixel sizes in both Photoshop and in HTML/CSS so that
    it'd be resolution independent and all that jazz.  How come there is such a big
    difference in size btween Photoshop (CS2) and the web?  Is it all about rendering?
    Georgia is hinted in such a way that it appears real big and wide?\r\n\r\nI love
    Georgia, but it's hard to use an alternative since all text will reflow dramatically.
