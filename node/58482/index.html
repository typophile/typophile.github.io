  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Well, given our <a href="http://typophile.com/node/57934" title="Typophile">recent discussion of using fonts on the web,</a> I thought this was particularly relevant. It appears that Jason Santa Maria is working with a company called Small Batch, a company that, in conjunction with unnamed foundries, will have a storehouse of fonts one can use online in a protected manner.

Apparently it will work via a javascript call indicating what font one wants to use and assumably, it will allow direct usage of some sort for select-ability and without image replacement, but that is yet to be seen. I'm a little cautious due to the usage of javascript to make it happen, given than if one's internet is not as speedy, there may be a flicker of some sort as the fonts are replaced, but that is  speculation given that the service hasn't launched yet!

There is nothing magic about it. It's exactly the kind of service I was planning to set up since last year (but nether got around to do it.)
The CSS @font-face rules are created/loaded on the fly on the client-side and the fonts are then loaded from the external server. The server can check whether or not the request comes from a licensed website. Which fonts you wanna use is defined in your account on the website of the service provider. At least that's how I would have done it and from what I read, they also do it this way. (Though I think I would not use JavaScript)

We’ve built a technology platform that lets us to host both free and commercial fonts in a way that is incredibly fast, smoothes out differences in how browsers handle type, and offers the level of protection that type designers need without resorting to annoying and ineffective DRM.

So not only they will be hosting the fonts, it sounds like they will be rendering the text for the webpages as well thus creating a single point of failure and a traditional customer lock-in setup. They will also be in a position to track all activity on my website.

You don't need any "coding" on the client side. A simple unique CSS link would suffice. The rest can be handled on the server side. 

<cite>it sounds like they will be rendering the text for the webpages as well</cite>

I don't think so, they specifically talking about a "font linking license", so to me this real @font-face linking of TT/OT/EOT fonts.

		<div class="commentbody">If your description is accurate and first-hand, it's pretty much what I surmised. There's at least one other company called TrueFontFamily using a similar system that also uses a Javascript insert. But they generate bitmaps from TTF and OTF. In that case, the TTF is being referenced piecemeal as the bitmaps are created. There is never any access to the entire, installable TTF or OTF. Hence, no licensing problems. (Or, at least, far less licensing problems. After all, what's being done is what gets done in Photoshop every minute of every day - only it's being generated server-side on the fly.)

A system which depends upon JavaScript to generate @font-face rules does nothing to protect the TTF or OTF files. No matter how well obfuscated. Cracking it and requesting the entire font file is trivial.
It will also add overhead to the loading of the page. Especially if it's heavily obfuscated.
I cannot imagine in my wildest dreams that Ascender/Microsoft or Adobe or Monotype would acquiesce to such a licensing arrangement.
Plus, my understanding is that FireFox enforces a same-domain restriction on font files. I don't know about IE and EOT files.
I haven't done any research or testing to see if that's true but I will do so in the next day or two. And if true, I don't see how a system that pulls the font file from a different domain can work.
Thanks for the info.

Exactly. 

Even it's not a @font-face per se, but something along the [[http://typeface.neocracy.org/|typeface.js]] it still is going to deliver type definition to the client where it can be re-assembled back into .otf. The only way to prevent this is <em>not</em> to send the type to the client at all, meaning that the type rendering is going to be done on the server side.</div>

I disagree with you as far as typeface.js and the more popular Cufon text-replacement technique.
In both cases the TTF or OTF is almost always sub-setted, reducing its desirability as something to download and re-use. (In fact, such sub-setting could be requested as a licensing requirement.)
But far more importantly, the JavaScript data is not easily reconstructed into a usable, working font file. And that data, in the case of Cufon at least, is almost always incomplete because the browser engine doesn't need every point to adequately render the glyph. And skipping points creates a smaller file for download.

IMHO - font makers have little to fear from this technique.

Just my 2 cents on the subject.</div>

And that is simply a solution that few, if any web designers would bother dealing with. We have that now, for the most part...GIFs and JPGs. 

I suppose based on the info we have for Typekit at this point, we have no idea what they're doing. My first assumption is that it's just a javascript file that renders out the appropriate CSS with @font-face attributes linking to the source font files on Typekit's servers.

I agree that not using javascript is preferable. I'm building out a similar service ( <a href="http://blog.kernest.com">Kernest.com</a> ) that works both with and without a javascript tag. 

epsilicon, 
I agree on the risk of a central-point-of-failure and that the TypeKit service (and even my service) is very close to a DRM service. Long term, I don't think that will be the case, and I'm architecting Kernest to provide a useful service even without the DRM aspects.

Keep in mind that we all probably have different concepts of 'point of failure'

Most web designers have become quite accustomed to progressive enhancements and graceful degradation.

If, for whatever reason, the font doesn't load, OK, use Arial. As type folks, we may cringe at that, but web designers have become quite accustomed to that method already. 

As a web designer, I'd probably find the ease of using someone elses service to deal with the hosting/bandwidth and CSS a very fair trade for the occasional service outage. </div>

Seems like the pros, cons, ups and downs of a font service like this have been well thought out and we are going around in circles.
IMHO - I'm always in favor of experimentation, but I can't see this gaining any traction in the marketplace. It isn't any kind of a long-term solution.
From the user's perspective, there are too many negatives. And they are BIG negatives.

The problem of font-linking will be solved satisfactorily when FireFox, Safari, Chrome, Opera, and IE support linking to 1) both TTF/OTF files and EOT (or an EOT equivalent yet to be decided upon) or 2) just EOT or an equivalent uninstallable file format.
Then, font-linking can really take off without legal hassles.

However, there shouldn't be any illusions. Once those versions of FF, Safari, etc... that do support linking to TTF/OTF reach a kind of "critical mass", many web authors will link to font files whether EULAs say they can or not.

I don't consider such rental services THE ultimate webfont solution, but an additional font market with huge potential. There are still all those corporate clients which have their corporate typefaces and we should offer them a way to upload those fonts on their server.
But there are millions of website owners who have never licensed a font, because the regular font licenses just don't work for them. But if they have the chance to rent a font for a very small fee per month, they would probably consider it, and this could become a huge market. I know I would use such a service for my own blog ...</div>

EOT is not a DRM format anymore than the JavaScript file which typeface.js or Cufon produces is DRM. Neither one will install as a font file in the operating system. I admit that has a "DRM effect" but in this case it really depends on your biases and point of view.
Everything has its advantages and disadvantages.
First, EOT is compressed. That's a plus for me right there.
I believe TTF/OTF files can be gzipped but that involves another step and might not be available unless you run your own server.
Next, if you're directly subsetting TTF to TTF and the name of the font is kept the same it's pretty easy to get confused and end up with some mighty strange looking web pages. Dealing with six different variations of Minion, all OTF files, is not my idea of a good time.
Also, tying the file, as EOT does, to a domain name (or a drive letter for local use) has advantages when you are subsetting, sometimes glyph-by-glyph, for web pages with very specific requirements. The WEFT tool auomatically adds numbers to the file names, and it makes it that much harder for me to shoot myself in the foot by applying the wrong font file to the wrong site or the wrong page.
It's fine to own guns, but safeties and trigger-locks are necessary accoutrements to them, I think.
But all this nonsense over font-file formats for the web and IP issues have gone on too long.
Is the web development community going to wait ten years for the W3C to get off its butt, come up with a format, have the browser makers implement, and then wait out the time it takes for that feature to propogate out to the majority of Internet users?</div>

I agree.

Now, back to talking about fonts...

EOT could work. I'm not saying it won't. But it's MS's invention and rarely does the web browser industry immediately jump on board that kind of proposal. 

The current advantage of @font-face is that it's simple for a web developer to implement and it works. The disadvantage is that foundries think that will cut into sales.</div>

We've already waited 12 years (NN4 & IE4 in 1997) for the W3C to declare a standard and the browsers to implement it in a consistent manner.

Since you undoubtedly know an order of magnitude more than I do about the nuts and bolts of font technology, I'm at a disadvantage here but teach me, please.
(I'm not being snide, I mean it.)
I just bought, a few months ago, the Adobe Web Fonts pack.
They were delivered as TTF files. Nearly all the files in my Windows font folder are TTF's but some of them seem to have Opentype features and display an "O" in the icon as a result. Or, at least, I assume that's the reason.)
Where are the CFF Opentype files you're describing? What am I missing, here?

I'm a web developer with a keen interest in onscreen reading technology and my main focus is on fonts as they are handled and rendered within browsers. And, therefore, I'm also concerned about what effect on page-load time linked font files will have.

So another question is, since there are different levels and kinds of compression, what's best? Is CFF really packed down, or will converting it into an EOT shrink it down further? Plus, I have not tested it, but I've heard it mentioned that TTF or OTF files can be gzipped.
Lotsa questions, I know.
Your input greatly appreciated...

		<div class="commentbody">Typically, CFF OpenType fonts have a ".otf" extension. All of Adobe's retail/end-user fonts are of this form *except* the 12 WebType fonts.

On Windows, for a TTF (TrueType) font, the presence of a digital signature (of all the silly things) causes an "O" icon instead of the usual "TT" icon.

Any file can be run through a compression program, of course. OpenType CFF is pretty compact as far as the outlines goes, and doesn't easily compact further... unless it has really extensive OpenType layout tables.

The optional MicroType compression in EOT uses subsetting plus various TT-specific optimizations. It can achieve slightly better results than straight subsetting plus ZIP compression, say 40% instead of 30% or something like that, as I recall. It won't do so much for OpenType CFF, because that format is already quite compact.

So, bottom line, CFF does the compression job pretty well.
Comparable to EOT.

So I gotta move compression out of the plus column for EOT, as compared to CFF OTF font files.

If you'd be so kind:

Can an easy conversion be done from TTF or OTF (uncompressed) to CFF? And if so, with what software?

Out of pure curiosity I just tried compressing a .ttf and .otf (Effra and Etelka respectively). TTF size was 92K, OTF - 59K. Interestingly enough both compressed down to about the same size:

ZIP -> 37-39K
LZMA -> 32-35K
PAQ8 -> 25-27K

Basically it means that there's still a lot of potential for compression even if the font file is already compressed natively.</div>

Thanks for that. Pure curiosity drives about half my day, lately.
You don't get more authoritative about stuff like this than Thomas Phinney, but "compressed" can mean different things in different contexts.

Current browsers support gzip compression which is what I'll be testing. I don't know how gzip matches up to the algorithms you tested or if one of your acronyms actually is the gzip algorithm by another name.
However, based on your post, my suspicion is there's still some considerable packing that can be done.
Of course, there's a time factor for unpacking on the client end in the browser which, frankly, I haven't look into. But I do know it's rather minimal.
And I'll also compare a CFF file with its EOT counterpart.
See what I come up with.
It won't be within the next couple of weeks. But I will post back the results.
If font-linking is going to happen, and it is, we've got to know these things.

It's part of the Adobe FDK, and also available in FontLab. (The option there is "Use subroutines to compress outlines in the CFF table".) I believe there is some inherent compression in OpenType CFF, but subroutinization can shrink a font significantly (or not, depending on the font).</div>

Incidentally, since this thread started out talking about Typekit and licensing - I actually got some hands-on experience with how it works today.
Had it cracked and hacked in about three minutes and I'm no great shakes at stuff like that.
The OTF data was trivially easy to obtain.
If delivering an unprotected font file is the major sticking point, I can't imagine any major vendor going along with this.
Typekit moves into the nice try column - IMHO.</div>

As usual, Christopher knows his stuff (no surprise, he started at Adobe way back around August 1997). OpenType CFF is maximally compressed when you use subroutinization, and not without it. How much additional compression that adds is dependent on the outlines in the font. Sorry that I forgot to mention that... pretty much all Adobe's fonts use subroutinization, and I turn it on in my FontLab prefs and forget about it.

The main part of the font which is not as compact as it reasonably could be, in OpenType CFF, is the layout tables. The more extensive the OT layout in the font, the more you'd imagine that either going to EOT or doing ZIP compression might make things a bit smaller.

On the protection side.... No scheme that relies on publicly available specs (including EOT) is going to be all *that* hard to crack. It's just a question of what proportion of users are deterred by the barriers put in place, and whether the font vendors are satisfied with that. PDF and SWF are not terribly secure, but are "secure enough" for most font vendors. Mind you, part of that may be because of the lossy embedding of SWF embedding in general, and PDF embedding as typically practiced.

Thanks. That was succinct and I, newbie, understood every word.
My focus is on screen reading and fonts for that purpose, especially within browsers - the browser having become the universal client. (Like the knife and fork, by now, IE is probably one of the most-used tools in human history.)
The sample of Typekit that I analyzed fed an EOT file to IE and fed a base64 encoded string to FireFox. (Very large. Came to about 133 kb, a substantial bit (no pun) of page load time.)
In order to take the font for re-use, I'd have to reconstruct it from either the EOT or the base64 string.
The same, incidentally, holds true for the JavaScript text-replacement product Cuf&oacute;n, which converts the points into a format readable by the browser's script engine.
IMHO - none of these schemes enables easy, drive-by downloading of an instantly installable font-file.
Plus, once I've reconstructed the data into a TTF/OTF file - which will require a tool of some kind - I then have to trust that it's quality hasn't been degraded.
Cuf&oacute;n developer Simo Kunnen explains it well on this thread, <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/cufon/browse_thread/thread/0bb96ddb30bc0064#">Font Security Issues</a>, from Cuf&oacute;n's Google group.
I keep having a vision of 60's comedian Jonathan Winters doing his "Grandma" character saying, "Don't touch that. You don't know <b>where</b> that's been!"
And, truly, I don't. I don't know if it's missing glyphs, or who knows what else.
And what holds true for me holds true for other developers as well. As long as the terms are conscionable, I'd rather pay for what I can trust from a company I can hold accountable.
Bottom line: I think the fear of unlicensed distribution running rampant is overblown. It wouldn't be if Microsoft wasn't holding the line, but they are.</div>

Not yet, but as soon as this kind of implementation would become a common way of using webfonts, someone would build a tool that automates the retrieval of the original fonts. This could be as simple as a website (or app), where you enter an URL and get a package of all the fonts used on this website with the base64 encoding removed. 

<cite>Very large. Came to about 133 kb, a substantial bit</cite>

Wow, that's a lot. TrueType? CFF? Subsetting?

I just tried it with our Graublau Sans Web package. One original OpenType file (CFF) has 44 KB (with the full character set including CE, Greek, Cyrillic ...)
As Base64 it's 56 KB, but with GZIP compression (which all those browsers supporting TT/OT linking should handle) it has only 36 KB! Which could be reduced even further with subsetting.
