    for creating a web page.

  body: "I've used InDesign for some initial web layouts (just to study them onscreen
    or on a printout), since I can work quickly in InDesign and it has good text tools,
    but it's not a good choice for actually building web pages.\r\n\r\nIn CS 5.5 (and
    perhaps earlier versions) can export InDesign to html (File > Export > html),
    although I've never tried it myself.  \r\n\r\nYou can copy and paste objects from
    InDesign to Photoshop, which I think works pretty well for images but text becomes
    rasterized if you paste the entire text box as an object. But you could create
    new text boxes in Photoshop and then paste text into them, although you'd probably
    have to reformat the text.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    do, recreating the look and layout shouldn't be a problem, and they can copy and

  body: "Fred, I pit you. I did this once too. \r\n\r\nSometimes I'll mock up a site
    in inDesign in order to show a client what the text will look like. Otherwise,
    I would build it all in photoshop and also send along a spec sheet for the typography
    and a file of the text. I don't bother to put all the actual text into the photoshop
    file. \r\n\r\nYou will find benefit from learning rudimentary html and css in
    order to mock-up column widths etc so you can see what the sizes and proportions
    look like in actual browsers and devices."

  body: Another approach is to ask the developer if they have InDesign. If they do,
    just send them the native files (use File > Package so that all necessary graphics
    are automatically collected) and let the developer handle the conversion to Photoshop
    however he/she feels best.

  body: "Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign are each designed for different purposes.
    \ Photoshop is mostly for editing bitmapped images (like photos). Illustrator
    is for editing vector images (illustrations, logos, etc). InDesign is for doing
    page layout (creating brochures, posters, etc.).  \r\n\r\nYou can certainly create
    a printed piece entirely in Photoshop or Illustrator, but in most cases (especially
    if it's a multi-page document) you're better off creating it in InDesign, and
    then import graphic elements (photos, illustrations) that you've created/edited
    using Photoshop or Illustrator.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "> Ask any oldtimer about these apps and you will notice their eyes misting
    up\u2026\r\n\r\nI'm one of those old-timers. \r\n\r\nThere are many things from
    the early days that I remember fondly, but not doing pasteup with rubber cement.
    Never liked the fumes, and a fellow designer was hospitalized for a week after
    rubber cement vapors were ignited by a candle and set his clothes on fire. Nor
    do I miss using tweezers to position a single, missing comma into a layout, or
    reflowing a long paragraph by cutting apart each line and manually reassembling
    it. \r\n\r\n(Eventually I switched to wax, which was an improvement but still
    kind of messy.)\r\n\r\nNever used PageMaker, but used Quark for many years, and
    those days I remember much more fondly. At the time I liked it a lot. It seemed
    like a miracle to be able to manipulate type live onscreen. I don't think people
    today appreciate how amazing it seemed at the time.\r\n\r\nI wasn't tempted by
    version 1 of InDesign, as I really liked Quark and InDesign had some shortcomings,
    but eventually I made the switch and never looked back.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
