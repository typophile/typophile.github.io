body: "In an earlie thread\r\n\"A (very) simple question about OpenType Stylistic
  Sets\"\r\nthey were discussing Stylistic set matters.\r\n\r\nI know that some discussions
  here caused adobe amd microsoft to support some stuff.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, I uses stylistic
  sets for varios causes.\r\nin some cases i need to appoint another stylistic set
  to cancal the effect of the previos because that when using Paragraph Style, you
  can't just select some words and uncheck the stylistic set, this wil cancal it for
  thw whole paragraph.\r\n\r\nI would like to see wrather than a static stylistic
  set (1-20), a dynamic one with the ability of giving it a name in the menu.\r\n\r\nLike
  this if a font does'nt support any stylistic sets the menu will be grayed.\r\nif
  the font supports only 2 stylistic sets the menu will contain only 2 items.\r\nand
  if the font supports 200 stylistic sets, the menu will contain 200 items.\r\n\r\nmore
  so, i would like to see sub menus, like this i can group stylistic sets into toics.\r\n\r\nprograming
  a dynamic menu is nothing for adobe, and every thing for a font developer.\r\n\r\nwhy
  limit the options?????\r\n\r\ntags should be not ss01, but s001..s999 with a value
  for subgrouping\r\n>> Main Feature\r\n++>> Sub Feature 1\r\n++>> Sub Feature 2\r\n++>>
  Sub Feature 3\r\n\r\ncant this be done?????"

  body: "At least you can give the stylistic sets non cryptical names, although there
    is not yet a program, that supports that, even not the Creative Suite 5: <strong><a
    href=\"http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/topic_feature_file_syntax.html#8.c\">Descriptive
    names for Stylistic Set ('ss01 - ss20') features</a>.</strong>\r\n\r\nAnd according
    to the OT spec, name IDs 256 to 32767, inclusive, are reserved for font-specific
    names such as those referenced by a font's layout features.\r\n\r\nThe name ID
    of ss01 starts with 256, as far as I remember. Just try, what happens, if you
    generate a ss21-feature with regard to the name ID, if feature params are set
    and if ss01-ss20 exist. I assume, that the AFDKO is already able to generate a
    ss21 feature with an individual name, although I have not checked that. So it
    probably is more a question of the missing apps, that support more than 20 ss-features,
    than a question of a tool, that is able to generate a font with more than 20 ss-features."
