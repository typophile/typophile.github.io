body: "Hello Everybody, \r\ni need to open, edit and save font file formats with the
  suffix \u201C<strong>.c</strong>\u201D. \r\nThey seem to have been generated with
  <strong>FontConverter</strong> on PC. \r\nThe Apps <em>FontFlasher, TransType</em>
  \ and even <em>BitFonter</em> DEMOs couldn\u2019t open this file format in OSX.
  Is there any chance/program i can work with these font files under OSX at all, or
  do i need to get a PC? \r\nThanks for any hint in advance, \r\nJum"

  body: Is there a chance that someone accidentally renamed the document format? I've
    found sometimes that changing the format suffix can make the file workable (or
    at least when it comes to .tif, .jpg, .pdf, etc). Try duplicating the file, and
    renaming the suffix to a common format, and it may magically work. I've never
    heard of a single character format suffix.

    order to see what kind of file it is.\r\n\r\nThat said, if they have generated
    it with Font Converter, the original file(s) could be of a PostScript font, so
    you should have two different files."

  body: "Thanks for the help so far!   \r\nRenaming the <strong>suffix</strong> (.ps,
    .ttf, .otf, \u2026) did not have any effect on being able to open the file at
    all, could still be simply corrupt. The single <strong>suffix .c</strong> appears
    strange to me, too.\r\nThe <em>Palantir</em> tells me: \r\n<em>This file may be
    : ASCII c programm text, with CRLF line terminators. </em> \r\nAny more suggestions?
    \r\n"

  body: ".c is indeed the suffix for \"c program text\".\r\nYou can try to open the
    file with a text editor in order to see if the headings tell you something about
    it.\r\nIf you can, you should ask for the original file(s) and then triyng to
    convert it yourself."

    which costs ridiciously $2,750.00. Finally i installed a Windows on my iMac with
    <em>VirtualBox</em>. In that environment i edited the Unicodes i needed in FontConverter
    and copy/pasted the previously generated characters in a text editor (if you are
    not very careful with the correct coding you easily mess the file up). The whole
    thing is about getting a .c file that can be read out properly on displays. \r\n\r\n{
