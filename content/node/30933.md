  does not include o's and u's with macrons over them. I have never altered characters
  with any software before. Is now the time to start, or is there any other (possibly
  easier) solutions?\r\n\r\nI am setting the type in Indesign cs2 on os10.4.  \r\n\r\nThanks
  for any help,\r\n\r\nDerek"

    keyboards. You can possibly get away with typing the macron after the letter and
    heavily overkerning them together, or you could use the dodge of typing ou and
    uu digraphs, which is acceptable for Japanese transliteration (depending on the
    method), but obviously not your preference."

  body: "Thanks, that actually works quite well. I thought I had tried that before
    but I must have done something differently. \r\n\r\nIf anyone wants to keep the
    thread going though, I am interested in learning how to go about creating the
    character o or u with a macron over it (or any other character for that matter).
    Are there any book and software recomendations out there for adding characters
    or altering them? \r\n\r\nI am definitely naive to the means of type design. I
    hear things like how opentype allows for all kinds of great things to be done,
    but I can't say I really know what that means.\r\n\r\nIf anyone wants to enlighten
    me a bit, that would be great."

  body: Most fonts can be opened in any of the popular font design programs (e.g,
    Font Lab, Fontographer, FontForge) frequently discussed here, and more specifically
    in the "Build" subforum, but be sure to check the license that comes with your
    fonts to see if it allows for such modifications for internal use.

  body: "The macron also appears in Maori language setting and various NZ publishers
    have over the years, customised versions of their house faces - 'ReedNZ Maori
    Palatino' for example, that includes such diacritics.\r\n\r\nYears ago I employed
    a very quick and dirty workaround for the cover of a Maori/English dictionary,
    creating a simple box/rectangle above the vowel character in Quark Xpress; as
    the type was 36pt and the macron only appeared once, it was the simplest thing
    to do. With a longer text or a smaller point size, one could group the vowel character
    and the 'hand-drawn' accent together, copy and paste them into the text as an
    anchored graphic, using the 'search and replace' dialogue to locate all instances
    needing to be 'macronised'.\r\n\r\nJason's methods are correct for what one would
    do nowadays."
