body: "I'm still trying to wrap my head around what exactly is in between a font's
  vector outlines and what we see on screen in web browsers. Based on a little reading,
  as well as the excellent replies in a previous thread ([[http://www.typophile.com/node/57993|Who
  else wants to understand hinting?]]), this is the gauntlet I imagine a glyph must
  survive on its way to being rendered in a web page...<!--break-->\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>A
  glyph starts as a <strong>bezier</strong>-based shape.</li>\r\n<li>This shape is
  made in or brought into a font-creation program like <strong>FontLab</strong>.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Settings</strong>
  like UPM (units per em), key dimensions (for vertical measurements like x-height,
  cap height, ascenders and descenders), and metrics (for horizontal measurements
  like sidebearings and kerning) determine how the letterform will act as a glyph
  in a font\u2014e.g., how much room it will occupy at a given size, how close other
  letters may live.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Hinting or instructions</strong> are added
  (automatically and/or manually) which can provide directions for conservation of
  the fonts design character in environments where less-than ideal output is to be
  employed.</li>\r\n<li>The glyph is <strong>exported as part of a font</strong>,
  in either OTF or TTF format (in this context, I am ignoring all other formats\u2014let
  me know if I shouldn't). TrueType hints are ditched if the font is OTF.</li>\r\n<li>The
  glyph is confronted by operating-system-level and browser-level <strong>rendering
  algorithms</strong>. I am still trying to list these combinations for myself. I
  would want to cross-reference technologies like Quartz and ClearType with headings
  like OS rendering engine, browser rendering engine, result of combination (overrides,
  any ignored font data).</li>\r\n<li><strong>User settings</strong> in various places
  (browser preferences, OS preferences) can modify how and when the rendering engines
  interact with font files. Windows users can turn ClearType on or off. Users can
  turn antialiasing off altogether. Certain preferences can limit the size at which
  antialiasing is applied. Listing these variables is another item on my to-do list.</li>\r\n<li>Finally,
  there are the <strong>physical qualities</strong> of a user's hardware, such as
  the kind of monitor they use, its resolution, whether they run it at native resolution
  or not, and their settings for color and luminosity.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\nHave I
  missed any steps or failed to articulate these well enough? What details might you
  add? Also, sorry the title of this thread is so juicy compared to the content! What
  a way to start a conversation about rasterization, eh?"

  body: "For the physical part -- #6. Rendering -- you could do no better than reading
    up on FreeType. Much of it is dedicated to pure code, but there is also lots of
    theoretical stuff.\r\n\r\nA side-track could be Maxim Shemanarov's [[www.antigrain.com|Antigrain
    Library]] -- he has a nice page on rendering type as well, and even more theoretical
    stuff on the physics of antialiasing.\r\n\r\nOn a more technical note, the divide
    in font technology is not \"OpenType/TTF\" but rather \"CFF/TTF\". Microsoft's
    'TTF' technology uses TrueType curves & hints, Adobe's 'CFF' uses PostScript curves
    and PostScript hints (not sure about the latter--wasn't Adobe phasing these out
    for OTF?). Both filetypes can have an OpenType wrapper; TTFs can also have a TTF
    wrapper."

    placing the PS outlines and hints within an sfnt structure; whereas TTF is by
    definition an sfnt structure."

    piece, John. I have read this ... but <em>years</em> ago, and it will be good
    to refresh. More recently I've thumbed through Leslie Cabarga's <em>Learn FontLab
    Fast</em>.\r\n\r\nTheunis, John, you lost me on the font formats. I need to digest
    this some more.\r\n\r\nTheunis, the [[http://www.antigrain.com/|Anti-Grain]] link
    didn't come through right at first. I found the site, though, and I'm looking
    at it now. Whoa. Lots of stuff here. I'm not sure where to start. Where's the
    page you're thinking of?"

    first paragraph mentions a Joel Spolsky article you might already have seen. If
    not, do read it first :-)\r\n\r\nThe font format difference is a nitpick I mentioned
    because, well, frankly, you started! ;-)\r\nMaybe it's not necessary to differ
    between OTF, CFF, or TTF or otherwise; it's the definition-as-curves that's important
    in the file format."

    environments where less-than ideal output is to be employed.\r\n\r\nHinting instructions
    are two confused fused terms. \"Suggestions\" about stem width, alignment zones,
    overlap management, is not a great term, for though TT instructions, and T1 hints
    do turn off, when turned on, they are simply obeyed, unlike a suggestion, which
    by definition may be ignored, just like this one. And\u2014for TrueType hinting\u2014actual
    pixel placement is never defined only actual outline placement is. This is a subtle
    difference, perhaps, though I would suggest it is crucial to understanding. \r\n\r\nAs
    for reading Beat Stamm\u2019s excellent article \"The raster tragedy at low resolution\",
    please remember this article is old, out of date in many respects, discussing
    only TT instructing for black and white fonts which is not terribly important
    today, and based on a world where TT instructions were interpreted by default
    in environments where less-than ideal output is to be employed, which is no longer
    the case.\r\n\r\n>What details might you add?\r\n\r\nThis is pretty good overall.
    \r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
