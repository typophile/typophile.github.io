  body: In Finland about 95% of the population has a Nokia phone or two. Mine is a
    tiny Panasonic. A lot of people I've met like my phone, especially because of
    its size, but I guess they think I'm unpatriotic for not having a Nokia.

    (equivalent of three drinks of alcohol apparently, in terms of attention span),
    really hate morons who have no idea what they are supposed to buy in the grocery
    store so walk from aisle to aisle under direction from someone whom I assume has
    something better to do. Well, maybe not. The other day a guy walks out of the
    store talking on the phone and leaves his paid groceries behind. "

    it's a good thing. Seeing someone on the phone gives me advanced warning of bad
    driving - \"I'm going to change lanes without signaling\" or \"I'm going to run
    this stop sign\" - it's sometimes more tricky to spot the drunk driver just by
    looking at them. "
