  i thought I'd make a new thread to get it noticed.\r\n\r\nI have modified it and
  I would like to know what you all think. Legibility and the 'colour' are of importance,
  I don't want some looking too dark.\r\n\r\nThere will be no lowercase as this typeface
  is intended for use on the back of football shirts.\r\n\r\nI look forward to hearing
  from you.\r\n\r\nTom"

  body: "I just took a gander at the previous post, there are definitely some very
    nice improvements with this set.\r\n\r\nAre you planning to keep all the fonts
    the same weight or do a bolder version also?\r\nI'd be interested to see what
    the LJ combination looks like now with the tighter spacing.\r\n\r\nSome nit-picky
    things to consider:\r\nI think the W needs to be slightly wider (maybe 1.5 times
    the width of the X) and the M strokes seem thin compared to the N (consider pulling
    the inside points down to thicken the M a little more). At least from a distance
    the M needs to be meatier.\r\n\r\nYou might want to consider closing the bowls
    of the 6 and 9, or at least one of them. The top tip of the 1 seems slightly over
    pronounced, could you curl it back like the U? The 8 seems squooshed on the bottom
    (is it as long as the 0?). Finally, the 4 still seems narrow, it's definitely
    the curve of the stroke. Have you consider opening the top more, like this: http://flickr.com/photos/rehvonwald/361027843/\r\n\r\nThere
    are my opinions, take them for what their worth. Either way, you have a nice looking
    font on your hands and will look awesome on a jersey. I love that R! This font
    definitely has character. "

  body: The sheared or diagonal ends of H, I, J, K, L, and especially Y need some
    overshoot, as they don't appear to quite reach the cap height. You've already
    applied it appropriately to N and U, so make it match those.

  body: "Right, thanks for the advice, I have altered it, check out the new file -
    untitled-5!\r\n\r\nThe LJ combination doesn't look very good, especially since
    its got the U following it too! This could cause problems, any ideas?\r\n\r\nI've
    decided to leave the K hanging below the cap line, I think it looks more balanced.\r\n\r\nHow
    does the 4 and 8 look now?\r\n\r\nAlso, I thought it best to keep the 6 and 9
    as they are, but the 6 is beginning to bug me so I may close it up.\r\n\r\nApart
    from that I'm very happy with it."

  body: "Tom: I started a new thread only to attach my suggestions PDF, I'm not attempting
    to hijack your font or anything alike that.\r\n\r\nAnd I mean no disrespect to
    your lovely letters, I just thought it be easier to illustrate my suggestions
    by modifying your existing PDF letters. I made adjustments to the L,J,1,4 and
    6. Take them with a grain of salt. The spacing isn't adjusted properly to reflect
    my changes.\r\n\r\nWhile making these changes I realized that the LJ combo might
    actually be First Initial Last Name. In which there would should be more space
    between the LJ, which would break up the forming \"U\". I can't think of any other
    times LJ are side by side that you might encounter, but I could be wrong.\r\n\r\nI
    hope you find my suggestions helpful. This is really turning into a nice font.\r\n\r\nThe

  body: "Hello, I know your not attempting to 'hijack' it, it's weird somebody messing
    with it though, weird in a good way I suppose!\r\n\r\nThanks for the suggestions,
    the LJ combination is in fact actually the beginning of a last name, it is Swedish.\r\n\r\nThe
    L you have drawn is pretty similar to the L I had originally designed, before
    I decided to alter most of the characters to make it more south Asian. You can
    see it here... http://typophile.com/node/39440.\r\n\r\nThat a good suggestion
    for the 6, I'd feel like a cheat if I used that now!\r\n\r\nI think I'm just going
    to keep the L and J as they are."

  body: "Oh I didn't see that post. Interesting. \r\n\r\nAnd remember: Good designers
    borrow, Great designers steal! Feel free to steal any of my suggestions/ideas.
    Ultimately you'll be the one getting all the credit, I'll be happy to know I've
    helped even if in a small capacity.\r\n\r\nI didn't try a combination of my J
    with your L, give that one a gander and see if that might sway you more. Anything
    to help break up that \"U\" that's forming. I actually felt kinda bad straightening
    your L out, the curves in your letters make the font unique. Straightening the
    L just made it seem less unique.\r\n\r\nWhat about the 1 and 4? I didn't do much
    with the 4, just extended it slightly more to the left, so the entire shape was
    maintained. The 1 however, I mimicked the curve of the U more.\r\n\r\nI know you
    weren't planning to do any lowercase, but how bout punctuation? I'd like to see
    what you do with the @, ?, and & symbols."

  body: "I don't think the LJ looks bad at all, actually, but if you want to try another
    way to break it up, you could make the J descending.\r\n\r\nI think Andrew's suggestions
    for 1 and 4 are necessary improvements. I would also suggest lengthening the top
    of the 7. You should want to avoid 1/7 confusion by all means possible.\r\n\r\nOtherwise,
    I think you're done. Good show!"
