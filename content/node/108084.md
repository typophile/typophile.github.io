    is also <strong>OPTI Modern Blackletter</strong> which looks exactly like the

    please read more about OPTI fonts legitimacy, before using any of them in a commercial

  body: "Thanks Fivos. I should have found this. Font Shop 1999 was Dieter Steffmann's
    font company -- not to be confused with FontShop.\r\nWhat can we say, pirates
    stealing from pirates? Who did the original work? We know that Dieter Steffmann's
    fonts are often \"improvements\" on existing digital fonts and OPTI's common practice
    was to pick up the digital work of others and reissue it as an OPTI font. I checked
    both fonts and Steffmann's is identical to OPTI's except for the addition of a
    some characters.\r\nI suspect that OPTI Modern Blackletter is one of the relatively
    few fonts that OPTI independently digitized, rather than pirated.\r\nOPTI is a
    defunct operation and its fonts are now orphans. I would not risk using it in
    a commercial application unless  unless I was prepared to be the legal test case
    for orphan fonts.\r\nBut that having been said, I like the font as an improvement
    on classical Fraktur, in that it keeps the features of light weight Fraktur fonts
    as an attractive lowercase script and revises some of the unreadable upper case
    letters.\r\nAs usual in questionable fonts, no links to downloads.\r\nDon"

    fact this is a pirated version of the original  OPTI Modern Blackletter (1990-91).\r\nDon"
