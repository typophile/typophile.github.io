  for the body text\r\nof a student magazine. i decided to go with\r\ndifferent fonts
  for almost every article title,\r\nbecause i think it's not wrong for such an\r\naudience,
  but now i need a legible and not\r\nboring font for the body. i think serifs wouldn't\r\ngo
  with it, or else?\r\n\r\nthanks so much,b."

  body: "Optima nova. The best sans serif ever (after the hot-metal Optima, of course).\r\n\r\nWhile
    it is true that, in most cases, sans serifs are harder to read, this is not the
    case with Optima nova. This font is made of such subtle tapers and curves that
    they play the part of serifs, creating a kind of subtle variance that the brain
    likes to see in nature. In effect, the serifs are \"within\" the characters, spreading
    into their entire bodies.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the design is so subtle that the original
    Optima (hot-metal font) has proven to be very hard to digitize. The first digitization
    attempt, also called Optima, had to sacrifice too much in order to avoid the stair-stepping
    effect at the low resolution of computer monitor. Optima nova is the second, somewhat
    more successful attempt.\r\n\r\nIMHO, Optima nova easier to read than most, if
    not all, serif fonts.\r\n\r\nLeo"

  body: "> Easy to say, harder to prove.\r\n\r\nNearly impossible to prove in fact.
    Fortunately humans don't live their lives based on formal proof. It is however
    quite easy to believe. The alternatives are harder to believe. Some of them (like
    the Emigre codswallop) are plain laughable.\r\n\r\nOptima: actually many people
    -including me- feel it's too gray, and that give it low readability. Remember,
    information comes from contrast.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Shouldn't you be using a serif? Perhaps Expo Serif for a more \"modern\"
    look. Not that I know what \"modern\" really means in this sense, but Expo Serif
    sure aint no Venetian. Looks like a slabby humanist serif of some kind. It works
    well, though. \r\n\r\nThe Optima Nova recommendation is interesting. "
