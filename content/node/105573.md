body: "Hello, colleagues. We, at Intellecta, are proud to announce Invitation Script,
  a modern and clean revival of the classic work of the Portuguese master penman Manuel
  de Andrade de Figueiredo, whose work can be seen in \u201CNova Escola para aprender
  a ler, escrever, e contar (...)'' (1722)(see footnote). Invitation Script is the
  third script superfamily published by Intellecta Design, after Penabico and Van
  den Velde Script.\r\n\r\nInvitation Script has original letters designed by Iza
  W. Creative direction and core programming were provided by Paulo W. Chyrllene K
  assisted with some work on unusual and archaic styles, resulting in a special font
  - Invitation Script Archaic (soon available).\r\n\r\nInvitation started out from
  Andrade\u2019s script style and evolved into a voluptuous script font family. The
  result is a typeface ideal for beautiful headings, signatures, art work typography,
  titles and short\r\n\r\npieces of hand-lettered text. Invitation family includes
  two multi-table Opentype fonts, three supplementary fonts for ornaments and fleurons,
  and the Archaic font with some of the Andrade\u2019s original characters.\r\n\r\nEmbedded
  in the regular fonts are additional sets of letters. Over 40 variations are available
  for certain letters via the Special Sets Opentype table.\r\n\r\nThe two regular
  versions of Invitation Script contains the following:\r\n\r\n(i) An extensive set
  of ligatures providing letterform variations that make eye-popping designs or simulate
  real handwriting. These are accessible via contextual alternates and other open-type
  features.\r\n\r\n(ii) Many stylistic alternates for each letter (upper and lowercase,
  accessed via the glyph palette, encoded in the ranges of the Special Set Opentype
  feature).\r\n\r\nSince there are over 1100 glyphs in each font, we suggest using
  the glyph palette.\r\n\r\n(iii) A set of ornaments and fleurons accessed with the
  glyph palette or using the Ornaments feature. Additional ornaments can be found
  in the two Invitation Script Ornaments fonts.\r\n\r\n(iv) Initial and final letters
  with artistic variations accessible using the initial and final form open-type features.\r\n\r\n(v)
  Major kerning work: over 6000 kerning pairs, hand-set to avoid collisions and to
  create intricate combinations of letters, using swashes and other resources.\r\n\r\nThese
  powerful features are all accessible in InDesign, Illustrator, QuarkXpress and similar
  software. We recommend exploring the magic of this font using the glyph palette.\r\n\r\nOur
  sample illustrations and PDF brochures showcase the power and pizzazz of this calligraphic
  script. Let your imagination go wild and use Invitation Script in ways that Andrade
  could not have foreseen.\r\n\r\nIn non-OpenType-savvy applications, Invitation Script
  is still an exceptionally beautiful calligraphic typeface that stands up to the
  competition.\r\n\r\nThe regular fonts contains the complete Latin alphabet, including
  Central European, Vietnamese, Baltic and Turkish, with a full set of diacritics
  and punctuation marks.\r\n\r\nSEE THE ENTIRE FONT AND ITS FAMILY AT MYFONTS - http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/intellecta/invitation-script/\r\n---\r\nfootnote\r\nFIGUEIREDO,

  parte / por Manoel de Andrade de Figueiredo, Mestre desta Arte nas cidades de Lisboa
  Occidental, e Oriental. - Lisboa Occidental: na Officina de Bernardo da Costa de
  Carvalho, Impressor do Serenissimo Senhor Infante, 1722. - [18], 156 p., 44 f. grav.
  a buril : il., ; 2\xBA (31 cm)Engraved royal coat of arms supported by angels over
  the city of Lisbon, engraved portrait of the author (both of the foregoing by Bernard
  Picart), (12)ff., 156pp., engraved calligraphic section title, 44 engraved plates.
  Wood-engraved culs-de-lampe and lettrines. Sm. folio. \u201CAndrade de Figueiredo
  was born in Espirito Santo, where his father was Governor of the \u2018Capitania.\u2019
  The fine portrait is dated 1721 and is showing Figueiredo at the age of 48. He was
  an eminent calligrapher and a creator of the Portuguese handwriting until the reign
  of Don Jos\xE9 I (ca. 1755). His work follows the style of the great Italian masters
  in its use of clubbed ascenders and descenders, and of Diaz Morante, the famous
  Spanish writing master, in its very elaborate show of command of hand. By his contemporaries,
  he was known as the \u2018Morante portugues\u2019\u201D (Ekstr\xF6m). \u201CCe livre
