    it's <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=BT.107629.0.0&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=j&sampleSize=96\"
    target=\"new\">Goudy Handtooled</a> but the problem is that the character in hot
    metal would vary slightly based on what point size it is. In general, the digital
    font, especially with inlines, outlines, etc., would try to capture a happy medium."
