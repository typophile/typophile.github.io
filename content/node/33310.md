body: "Dear Type Savants,\r\n\r\nI recently came across a fashion magazine that does
  *not* use Didot and/or Avant Garde. Instead, the designer(s) employs a kind of retro-cheesy-yet-appealing
  combination of typefaces. (At least they're trying something different.) I know
  the faces, but I can't identify them. It's making me crazy. \r\n\r\n<em>Specifically:</em>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><a
  href=\"http://www.preenmag.com/issue01/\">The masthead</a>. Though I know the swash
  and spacing are likely custom. </li>\r\n<li>And <a href=\"http://www.preenmag.com/issue01/issue01c.html\">this
  display face</a>, used in various weights throughout.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\nI've
  ruled out Normandy or Poster Bodoni for the masthead, as well as Bernhard Gothic
  or Penumbra Flare for the display. Any ideas?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Lex, you are absolutely right. Thank you. And it figures that a fashion magazine
    can't get away from a Lubalin face. What's up with that?\r\n\r\nThe more I look
    at the masthead, the more it appears to be custom. Though I bet it started as
    a didone."

    a starting point and tweaked from there.

    the type selections are right on.

  body: "Been reading Typophile for ages now and it was a pleasant surprise to find
    a thread about Preen. Justin did a great job with the masthead \u2013 when I was
    burning the midnight oil laying out the magazine he swooped in and knocked out
    the logo. Huge life-saver. \r\n\r\nThe rest of the magazine uses Serif Gothic,
    Caslon, and a healthy dose of Fedra Sans. I must say, Serif Gothic is one of those
    typefaces you don't necessarily take notice of immediately, but even after 3 issues
    I can't wait to keep using it. "
