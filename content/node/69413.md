  by the italian publisher \"Astrolabio\" in 1965?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LittleAstrolabio_4130.jpg]\r\n\r\nYou
  can see the full page here:\r\n[[http://img188.imageshack.us/img188/3295/paginaastrolabio1965.jpg]]\r\n\r\nPS:
  I think headings (as you see in the full page) are in Futura but i can't identify
  the body font... maybe something similar to Transitional 521 or Electra?"

  body: It's weirdly similar to Electra, but some letters don't match at all. It's
    possible that it was an Electra look-alike from a foundry other than Linotype.

    actually Caledonia (short ascenders and descenders) with Electra capitals, both

    lowercase of Caledonia.

  body: "The suggestion that this is Caledonia with Electra caps seems plausible.
    But I suspect it\u2019s a little more complex than that.\r\n\r\nAfter staring
    at the example for some time, I can\u2019t help feeling that there are a number
    of very small, subtle details in the lowercase that aren\u2019t quite right \u2014
    aren\u2019t quite truly Caledonia.\r\n\r\nHere are a few examples. \r\n\r\nFor
    one thing, that\u2019s not a Caledonia apostrophe. \r\n\r\nThe tail, upper terminal,
    and \u201Cswing\u201D of the \u2018a\u2019 are not quite right. And something
    about the stiffness of the spine of the \u2018s\u2019 and it\u2019s miserly upper
    counter aren\u2019t quite true either. (Even taking into consideration the vagaries
    of printing and the low resolution of the sample.)\r\n\r\nThe angle and overall
    sweep of the italic <em>\u2018v\u2019</em> are slightly different.\r\n\r\nAnd
    there\u2019s something about the ear and fitting of the right side of \u2018r\u2019
    that isn\u2019t quite true, even if you consider that the sample is possibly phototype
    (a little on the early side, but possible).\r\n\r\nHere, Caledonia on the left
    in black, sample on the right, gray:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CaledoniaInvestigation_6360.jpg]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nI
    can\u2019t be certain without a much better quality example and some sense of
    the actual type size, but I believe the sample is not truly Caledonia with Electra
    caps. I suspect that it is a European knock-off done for another foundry/technology.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor
    instance, I\u2019m aware that the Simoncini foundry was accused of plagiarizing
    Linotype\u2019s Fairfield in the 1950s. I have some documents where Burke, Griffith,
    Ruzicka, and a Mergenthaler official are establishing the originality of Fairfield
    in order to challenge Simoncini\u2019s Fancy.\r\n\r\nSo, it wouldn\u2019t surprise
    me at all if this sample were discovered to be a European knock-off."

  body: "A closer comparison. I\u2019ve cobbled the Caledonia from an 11-point Linotype
    specimen, printed on harder stock than the Astrolabio example was likely printed
    on. (And without access to authentic sidebearing info, so differences in spacing
    should not be considered evidence.)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CaledoniaInvestigation2_5262.jpg]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nIt\u2019s
    impossible to account completely for differences in reproduction. But I remain
    convinced that the Astrolabio sample is a knock-off of Caledonia lowercase, not
    actually Caledonia.\r\n\r\nA couple details I missed the first time around: the
    insistent \u201Ccorrection\u201D in the placement of the dot on the \u2018i\u2019,
    and the \u2018t\u2019 is missing a certain characteristic swing."

    supposed to be working on for Monotype Imaging (who now owns Linotype) will hopefully
    have short descenders as an alternate stylistic set. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, that

    me to dust it off and get back into it. But it\u2019s still at least a couple
