body: "Hello everyone,\r\n\r\nYes, I am one of those people who have been reading
  typophile for a while, but post only when they need help. I guess I think I have
  nothing to contribute to a cool comunity like this one:). I promise i will try harder
  from now on...\r\n\r\n The Project: \r\n\r\nI am designing a visual identinty for
  a really small nation (which I am part of) that is spread all over the world. We
  have a few small communities in Canada and they are my main focus group (Including
  every single Canadian to whom I have to explain who actually I am:). My main idea
  is to represent our history, culture, tradition, but finally in a very modern and
  \"professional\" way to represent who we are currently. I dislike websites and brochures
  with tons of text on irritating backgrounds (that sadly became a style) and  I understand
  that text is important, but lets face it : \"normal\" (can't find a better word)
  person is not going to be intrigued by this aproach. Fast, interesting, modern and
  fun presentation of my nation ( It even rhymes:).\r\n\r\nMethod of Attack:\r\n\r\nThe
  primary project is a flash website ( Huge image of a small room set in traditional
  style for a background and \"jump\" navigation to different parts of the room to
  represent different aspects of our nation). As a secondary project, I would also
  like to include some brochures, posters... for our presentations at \"folk fests\".\r\n\r\n
  Needed Resources:\r\n\r\nTwo Cyrillic typefaces (sans + serif), they would have
  to work well in white on dark valued backgrounds ( Is that a typographic element?)
  + I love the look of white type on a brown background. :) Of course, they have to
  work well together. Text and Display. \r\n\r\nI am also on a budget (read student),
  with really no way of explaining to certain people that \"fonts\" matter and that
  you are supposed to pay for them. Did I mention I am not getting payed for this
  either? :)\r\n\r\nCyrillic Univers (what do you think about this as my sans) ?\r\n\r\n\r\nPS
  I was warned (In really nice and funny context) by certain people that I should
  watch my spelling and writing style around here and I tried to the best of my knowledge
  (of English language) to follow this advice, again with the help of other certain
  people:) \r\n\r\n^ But I don't know, you don't look that scary to me:)\r\n\r\nThank
  you,\r\nSebastian\r\n  "

    name? How come you speak Serbian?) ), unfortunately you are wrong:)\r\nI recently
    moved from Serbia to Canada (20 months ago), but I am not Serbian, I am: [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rusyns]].\r\nSpent
    most of my life (18 years in Serbia) and have some Serbian blood so I guess my
    \"2nd nationality could be Serbian\".\r\n\r\nBtw I do not consider Serbia and
    Montenegro as small nations, when I say small I mean tiny maybe I should also
    mention a nation without a country:)\r\n\r\nFor the rest of the crowd sorry for
    offtopic and yes, recommendations for fonts are really appreciated. "

    Montenegrin or Macedonian. Rusyn is an interesting option :-) Are you Zakarpathian
    Rusyn or Voivodin Rusyn?

  body: "I Love it! This is pretty much what I was looking for, Stylish Sans (my typography
    language) and nice serif in the same family. I downloaded the free versions from
    www.tipometar.org and was playing with it all night:). I like the fact that I
    will have to buy only few weights, I like that I am supporting a Serbian designer
    and that it is not overused (Is that a word?) font. Thank you Mark and Typophile!\r\n\r\nIs
    it only me (probably) or cyrillic in general has a lot of characters that are
    very simple and they tend to look quite boring(plane) if they are set in \"perfect\"
    typefaces like Helvetica? Talking mostly about capital sans. Or maybe Helvetica
    is the first typeface I had contact with (learned how to read in it) so I'm awfully
    biased:)\r\n\r\nPS I really love Sans Bold Italic version of Resavska."

    being designed to look good at small sizes on screen. They are also freely available
    under the MS webfont license.\r\n\r\nI remember doing some research on the Rusyn
    orthography a few years ago, and found it very difficult to find reliable information.
    In the end, I found some information about an orthography in use among Carpathian
    Rusyns, but I've mislaid this information. Sebastian, what characters are included
    in the Rusyn alphabet as used by the Voivodin Rusyns?\r\n\r\nThere is indeed a

    generalize and talk about all-cap settings and H, yeah, that's boring alright--in
    L, C, or G.\r\n\r\nHowever, the question for typographers is, how would that text
    (set in H) differ if set in Akzidenz or Arial? Which Cyrillic adaptation is most
    faithful? Who ripped off who? What was the earliest Cyrillic grotesque? And so
    on. Now we can have a debate.\r\n\r\nAs an antidote to H, Vladimir Yefimov's version

    Nick, I am really not sure how to respond to sarcasm (if there is any). What I

  body: "<em>sarcasm (if there is any)</em>\r\n\r\nNo, that is my sincere opinion.\r\nI
    genuinely believe that Helvetica is equally dull in Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic,
    and that the Cyrillic alphabet is no better or worse than the Latin alphabet,
    just different.\r\n\r\n<em>cyrillic \u201Cneeds\u201D some sort stylish typeface
    to look more interesting</em>\r\n\r\nThose typefaces are already \"out there\"
    and available at Paratype, such as versions of the presently trendy-in-the-West
    faces Avant Garde, Futura, DIN, Officina, Meta (Go, Erik!), and \"indigenous\"
    designs such as adaptations of Tatlin's constructivist lettering, and brand new
    faces, for instance a new fruity (or was it a vegetable?) script at Lebedev.\r\n\r\nThen
    there are designers such as Slimbach (with the swash calligraphy in Arno) and
    Phinney (with the alternates in Hypatia) at Adobe, providing \"new tools\". (Correct
    me if I'm wrong, but I would imagine the \"alternate <em>a\"</em> feature in Hypatia
    works in Cyrillic as well as Latin.) I'll shortly be releasing a face with cross-script
    features that will, for instance, set bold italic small caps and swash all caps
    in Cyrillic, including Asian Cyrillic. Look out, Kazakhstan."
