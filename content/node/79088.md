  is running a fantastic course at St Bride near Fleet Street in London. They're not
  free, but he's worth it, as is St Bride Library \u2013 it's a national treasure
  and one of the best printing and typography libraries in the world!\r\n\r\n'Richard
  Lawrence has been printing for more than 30 years. Most of his work is ephemeral.
  He gives printing demonstrations and teaches practical classes for students and
  others. Richard also works with artists such as Stanley Donwood of Radiohead fame.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://onedayletterpressworkshop.eventbrite.com/?ref=enivte&invite=NzMwMjU1L2xldHRlcnByZXNzQGhvdG1haWwuY28udWsvMA%3D%3D&utm_source=eb_email&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=invitenew&utm_term=eventimage"
