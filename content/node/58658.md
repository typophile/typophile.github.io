  folks,\r\n\r\nWeb licensing issues aside, what do you think of this type combination
  I suggested recently (Graublau Sans Web with Lucida sanserif), and my typeset example?\r\n\r\nBlog
  post:\r\nhttp://nicewebtype.com/notes/2009/05/22/nice-web-type-likes/\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nhttp://nicewebtype.com/fonts/graublau-sans-web/\r\n\r\nIf
  you\u2019re not sure where to start, consider (from the text in the example page
  itself) any of my claims about the two faces. Do you agree? Do you disagree? Why?
  Also, please criticize the typesetting of the example itself.\r\n\r\nIf we want
  web typography to be respected as a part of our art and craft, web typesetting deserves
  our fullest criticism \u2013 judging the work on aesthetic merits while accounting
  for available technologies.\r\n\r\nTim"

    I think it's worthwhile to use the Microsoft Weft tool to make a linkable EOT
    file for these things. As unfriendly as it is, at least you only have to make
    the file once.\r\nEverybody with Windows has IE to fall back to. (Retreat!)\r\nMakes
    looking at examples a lot more reliable."

    can also check out the screenshot (Safari/Mac) and critique that way:\r\nhttp://nicewebtype.com/fonts/graublau-sans-web/images/graublau-sans-web.png\r\n\r\n@Richard:
    It would be worthwhile, I agree. But so many other things are worthwhile too.
    ;) I think I'll wait for services like Typekit to do that EOT work for me."

    as per the best @font-face syntax I know:\r\nhttp://nicewebtype.com/x/u\r\n\r\n...
    and will attempt to continue revising as time goes on and new methods exist. \r\n\r\nRich,
    I sincerely appreciate your holding me accountable for making sure things work
    in IE/Win. More people need to care, as you do (and as I do), for an unbiased
    experience. Not necessarily the same experience http://dowebsitesneedtolookexactlythesameineverybrowser.com
    \_... but an unbiased experience in that, if there exists the capability, no agent
    should be segregated. I trust you won't stop reminding people to pay attention
    to their entire audiences."
