  body: "in my opinion, enabler should be your display font and you should use another
    font for copy text. it's not very readable over long texts but looks great when
    you use it as a display font.. looks very nice in all caps! \r\nby the way, have
    you tried <a href=\"http://www.t26.com/fonts/796-Progress\">progress</a> which
    has more styles!"
