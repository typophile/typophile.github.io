  Medium"?  I have this (lead) type and can't find information on it anywhere.  I
  know Balto Type had a nasty habit of making up its own names, so thought that might
  be the case here.

  body: "Hmmm, yes... Bitstream also has a digital version called <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/lucian/\"
    target=\"new\">Lucian</a>.\r\n\r\nBut both digital versions are based on <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/person/bernhard/lucian/\"
    target=\"new\">Lucian Bernhard's</a> design.\r\nThat would mean Baltimore Type
    also based their \"Graphic Medium\" off the metal version of Bernhard's design.\r\n\r\nA
    note on David Berlow's Belucian:\r\n<em>In need of a distinctive display style,
    Smart magazine asked Font Bureau in 1990 to revise the work of Lucian Bernhard
    from 1925. David Berlow prepared Belucian Demi, now accompanied by Kelly Ehrgott-Milligan\u2019s
    1994 Demi Italic, added Book and Book Italic for text, and designed Ultra for
    dynamic impact in headlines.</em>\r\n\r\n"

  body: Thanks, Norbert. It was Lucian when I was growing up and somehow had morphed
    into Belucian in the digital age.

    you'd have found this font on your own - it was pretty common.
