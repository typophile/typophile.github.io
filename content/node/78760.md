  What is the character that looks like a lower case \"o\" with a vertical line through
  it, and in some cases a diagonal line in the pic attached (is it different or a
  typographical inconsistency)? Scroll to right to see the other differing versions.\r\n\r\nAppreciatively,\r\nLuca\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/p113_5447.jpg]"

  body: "Greek letter phi (\u03C6), in the form that has a tall stroke. It may be
    either upright or slanted, according to the overall design. Here it looks like
    the intent is that the slanted ones are italic (as mathematical symbols often
    are) and the non-slanted ones regular (because they are a symbol that would normally
    be italic, within text that is as a whole italicized)."

    is really odd. It's true that, in terms of typographic operators, italic\xB2 =
    regular.\r\n\r\nBut I've never seen this convention applied to formulae. Variables
    and function names are usually set in italics no matter the context (the <em>s</em>
    is, for example). This matters, because some functions and variables are distinguished
    from others by setting them upright &mdash; in quantum mechanics, for example,
    Schr\xF6dinger's wave function is often written as <strong>\u03A8</strong> in
    its time-dependent, and <strong><em>\u03C8</em></strong> in its time-independent
    form (at least in the textbooks I've come across). \r\n\r\nAs such, I would suggest
    that you keep all \u03C6's in italic here: both along the axes and in the caption."

    it's definitely weird. But I couldn't think of any other reason why it would be
    vertical in the caption and slanted elsewhere (apart from the possibility that
    this was completely inadvertent)."

    of the typewriter face.\r\n\r\nA good face for math will have a distinct closed
    phi symbol \u03D5 at Ux03D5 (this is \"phi1\" in older encodings) to distinguish
    it from an open phi in the alphabet at Ux03C6."

  body: "<em>I think it only looks different because it's what was available in the
    context of the typewriter face.</em>\r\n\r\nIt's not about the shape, it's about
    the fact that an upright symbol was used in an italic context, thus following
    a convention that doesn't apply to maths (even though apparently the italic phi
    <em>was</em> available).\r\n\r\nOn second thought, I'd say that setting captions
    in italics is a fairly stupid idea here. Formulae rely on the differences between
    italics (variables/functions), roman (units) and bolds (vectors). Changing the
    context like this is just going to make things confusing."

  body: "Formulas should be the same, whether in an italic context (theorems are normally
    set in italics) or an upright context (definitions are normally set upright).
    If a letter phi represents an angle, then it should look absolutely the same inside
    a definition or inside a theorem.  In the example above, not only the phi was
    changed, but also the s. You just don't do that.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/formulas_4245.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
    conventions for the formulas are not universal. French mathematics uses upright
    roman capitals and upright greek letters (independently of the case). In the US,
    latin capitals and small greek letters are in italics, but greek capitals are
    normally upright. Journals may have their preferences for the font to be used
    for vectors, tensors, etc. Once you are given the conventions, you stick to them.
    If a symbol is to be written with an upright bold sans, then it needs to be an
    upright bold sans everywhere in the text, independently of the context. \r\n\r\n[Added]
    Here is how the formula may look like with the LaTeX Fourier math font (Utopia
    based). \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/forms_5011.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
    parentheses are upright even when the letters are in italics. The first line uses
    the US convention, the second uses the French convention. The examples show both
    LaTeX symbols \\phi and \\varphi."

  body: I agree that it looks horrible by modern standards, but I believe it's the
    result of the limited resources of a bygone time. Someone probably pasted the
    diagrams as images from another source, and the manuscript and captions probably
    come from an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Selectric_typewriter">IBM
    Selectric typewriter</a> (note the paragraph about mathematics in the Wikipedia
    article). That's why Luca has all this work to do in the first place. I notice
    that the phi does have a mild slant even though it disappears in comparison to
    the slant of Courier.

    a Selectric typewriter. Here is another one, coming from my own thesis (also typed
    on a Selectric).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/phi_5802.jpg]\r\n\r\nOnce
    you get used to the style, you don't find it that horrible, provided the notations

  body: I don't know for physics. There are interesting slides by Ulrik Vieth (<a
    href="http://www.ntg.nl/EuroTeX2009/slides/ulrik-slides.pdf">pdf, 608K</a>)  that
    provide some useful information for various conventions in mathematical physics
    in general. There is also a nice study of the Russian tradition for mathematics
    (<a href="http://www.uni-giessen.de/partosch/eurotex99/zaitsev.pdf">pdf, 200K</a>)
    but I have no idea up to what extent  mathematical physics may depart from it.
