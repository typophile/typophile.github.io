body: I'm sure this has been answered many times, but can anyone help with the 'Y'
  and the "k" in New York Magazine's title? Is there anything close or are these completely
  custom? I'm close enough on the rest, but need expert help on theses two. Thanks.

  body: "\"Acknowledging the Glaser/Bernard design was firmly in the brief and was
    part of the first conversation with the new editor Adam Moss. Adam talks passionately
    about the early years of the magazine and he wanted to evoke the original without
    copying it. The way rules are used, the condensed Egyptian, some of the illustration
    styles are informed by the 1970\u2019s era design....\r\n\r\n\"It\u2019s important
    to make something distinct and ownable. The New York magazine logo, for instance,
    is a crazy rococo creation but had to be embraced because it marks us so clearly
    and belongs to no one else.\"\r\n\r\n--Roger Black\r\nhttp://www.rogerblack.com/blog/conversation_with_hayman"
