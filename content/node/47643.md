body: "I have some descriptor type (a short sentence) under a logo and would like
  to use something a little feminine but not too\r\n\"scripty\". Something that has
  the character of Dalliance that is perhaps an italic font with a slight swash. Something\r\ncontemporary
  female without being \"fussy\". A script without being a script. Any recommendations
  would be sincerely \r\nappreciated.\r\n\r\nJC"

  body: It would be helpful to see the logo or at least know what it looks like, what
    typefaces it might use.

    shares some of Dalliance''s characteristics. [[http://www.linotype.com/434/fling-family.html|Fling]]
    is another typeface in that same vein, though it might be a bit too "fussy".'
