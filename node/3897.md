  body: ' today i was in a bookstore looking at stuff like &#34;extreme type&#34;,
    etc. it seemed like all the wacky stuff had been done, and then this. it&#39;s
    great to be surprised once in awhile. the mix of bitmap and blackface is one i
    haven&#39;t seen before &#40;anyone else?&#41;. very cool. was there a wry joke
    behind it? is it a friendly poke at blackletter or bitmaps, or just a crazy thought
    you had? if only we had those kind of thoughts more often. '

  body: ' Thanks for the compliments! I appreciate it. <BR>My main client is a vinatge
    haute couture boutique. I have always felt that he deals in anachronisms, it&#39;s
    high fashion for now, but all of it is 30 to 40 years old. So I try to accomodate
    that vision whenever I do a custom typeface for them. My first typeface I ever
    designed was for this client and it was a cross of Stanley Kubric 2001 computer
    screen OS type with Viennese Succession typographic layouts - it was very cool
    and I have always tried to recapture that excitement in the following years. I
    usually do one typeface a year for them. <BR> <BR>This one was designed for the
    holiday card and I wanted it to have that same feeling, somewhat comfortable and
    been there before, but seen slightly differently. Judging from your comments,
    I have succeeded.  <BR> <BR>Again, thanks! '
