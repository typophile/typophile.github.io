  a press release about them in news the other day, <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/72/49534.html?1095888070"

  <BR> <BR>They have become quite popular in Germany, but I&#39;ve never used them,
  Does anyone have any experience with the typefaces? <BR><a href="http://www.linotype.com/200000/compatil-clan.html"

  body: 'Corporate ASE is a type system with three separate families: a serif, a slab
    serif, and a sans serif. Compatil has four: a Venetian serif, a transitional serif,
    a slab serif, and a humanist sans serif. <BR> <BR>The letter widths of individual
    letters in each of the four Compatil families are the same. This is not a monospaced

  body: A number of designers dislike Compatil &#40;and Unica, and other rational
    fonts&#41;, and some of them possibly because they consider themselves artists
    &#40;whether they admit it or not&#41;, and the worlds of expression and logic
    are partly opposed. So something that makes a lot of sense is in a way threatening
    to the &#34;culture&#34; of some type designer. Artists can make some types of
    fonts better than craftsmen, and the other way around too. But even though no
    person is purely one or the other, the more you&#39;re close to one extreme of
    the axis the more liable you are to focus your hatred on the other extreme. Very
    few people can be both at one extreme and appreciative of the other extreme. <BR>

    is necessarily a bad thing. <BR> <BR>However, before digital type, before photocomposition,
    Dwiggins &#40;and many others&#41; were designing for Linotype with all sorts
    of constraints and still managed to create beautiful type that worked and looked
    good in spite of those constraints.

    we&#39;d not have so much from which to choose. I also agree that, perhaps, technology
    and function are different. Compatil was created, I think, for a specific &#34;functional&#34;

  body: Let explain me a bit more, <BR> <BR>I have nothing against such concept of
    various styles on a same family &#40;well I have done one myself, hum&#41;. There
    is some good use of that, and many families demonstrated good design solution
    for that concept for long &#40;JvK, Unger, Stone, Majoor, etc&#41;. <BR> <BR>But
    what I can&#39;t &#34;accept&#34; on Compatil is the way they tried to fit all
    forms on one same unique structure, missing that the different style can stick
    to same set of basic forms. Its a too universal approche for my eye. <BR> <BR>&#34;Oldstyle&#34;
    have some obvious characteristics, &#34;Sans&#34; others, etc. If not adjusted
    with sensibility, your design quickly became a monster, and some element of Compatil
    are like that, the various styles can&#39;t be &#34;Compatibles.&#34; <BR> <BR>Another
    thing &#40;from my actual knowledge, based on the type specimen&#41;, is pretending
    doing a universal family but providing no italic is a bit bizarre. <BR> <BR>Last,
    when you look at the design itself of the letterforms, well, the letterforms not
    balance well to the eyes, like the Frutiger Next too when Avenir Next is wonderful
    compared.

  body: While a nice concept piece, I&#39;d have to agree with JFP - obliques rather
    than italics, combined with the inevitable compromises that come from not allowing
    inherent characteristics of different classes of typeface to express themselves
    make it look, well, <i>bland</i>. And a bit cheap. IMHO. <BR> <BR>Its like making
    the perfect car for all purposes. An exciting sports car that can do 150mph on
    the highway, that carries the family shopping from Sainsburys, thats easy to park
    and has enough room for the kids, big comfy seats, while being fuel efficient,
    safe, 4 wheel drive and low pollution.  <BR> <BR>Likely?

  body: '&#62; Its a too universal approche for my eye. <BR> <BR>I dislike &#34;universality&#34;
    as much as you &#40;probably more&#41; but I think it&#39;s important to remember
    the &#34;design brief&#34;. A style&#39;s preferred characteristics &#40;for example
    that an old-style should have a smaller x-height&#42;&#41; are important, but
    not sacrosanct - matching apparent size between the styles for example can be
    just as important. It depends on the intent, and because it &#34;bends&#34; the
    styles, Compatil becomes more useful in certain ways it couldn&#39;t have if it
    didn&#39;t bend them. <BR> <BR>&#42; Which is why Iowan Old-Style for example
    seems awkward - we probably agree. &#40;Although the caps are great.&#41; <BR>
    <BR>&#62; providing no italic is a bit bizarre. <BR> <BR>That I can agree with,

  body: A couple of comments at the &#39;Making Faces&#39; seminar in New York last
    week are relevant to the issue of whether the &#39;brief&#39; for Compatil is
    a good or a misguided idea. <BR> <BR>Matthew Carter was asked about his redesigns
    of Cheltenham for the New York Times. The questioner noted that some of the titles
    that had before been in different typefaces were now being taken over more and
    more by Cheltenham. Was this a loss? <BR> <BR>Carter said that whether to use
    more or fewer faces was really a matter for the Times to decide, but he personally
    didn&#39;t really see any advantage to a great many faces. He explained that historically
    the same face was just not available in different sizes and weights, so newspapers
    were more or less forced to use many typefaces. He did note that he designed,
    IIRC, five different versions of Cheltenham for the Times, for different uses.  <BR>
    <BR>The other comment was from David Berlow in answer to a question about the
    proliferation of families with a huge variety of weights and widths - much in
    evidence in both the Font Bureau and the HFJ foundry&#39;s faces. He retorted
    &#34;We didn&#39;t start this you know,&#34; --explaining that the demand for
    a variety of weights and widths came from publications themselves. <BR> <BR>Reinforcing
    the merit of a variety of weights was another comment from Matthew Carter. He
    was in general refreshingly modest, but one slide he was clearly proud of, saying
    &#39;this is where I earn my keep.&#39; It was a picture of a serif face with
    3 different weights superimposed. The lines of the different weights were close,
    but the relationship between the different weights was clearly non-linear, and
    the serifs and joins were treated differently.    <BR> <BR>What I took from this
    was that all the optical and other adjustments of a face for different sizes and
    uses in a publication is actually quite useful and valuable, but the multiplication
    of faces in a single publication is questionable.

    is useful, but that different faces, with different underlying structures, such
    as an old face and slab face is a problem. <BR> <BR>How many weights it would
    seem is dictated by the needs of the publication. Newspapers, which have a lot
    of information and charts and pictures to present, often in narrow columns - and
    which want to be &#39;skimmable&#39; - seem to have a much higher demand than
