body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Typefaces]] : Neuland</strong>\r\n\r\nNeuland is a
  typeface designed by the German master calligrapher and early 20th century typeface
  design [[Rudolf Koch]]. The typeface was created at, and released by the [[Klingspor]]
  foundry. Today, the digital version is available at [[Linotype]]. [[P22]] has also
  made their own version.\r\n\r\nNeuland arose out of Koch's desire to begin cutting
  his typefaces himself. Previously, his punches were made by Klinsgpor staff, who
  made them by referencing his drawings.\r\n\r\nKoch cut each letter at actual size.
  There was no pre-planned \"design.\" Because of this, each size of lead type's design
  was different. This is sadly lost in the digital version, which does not have optical
  masters.\r\n\r\nKoch would go on to cut his own \"serious\" type as well.\r\n\r\nUpon
  seeing the initial concept, [[Karl Klingspor]], the foundry's head, told Koch that
  he found Neuland ugly, but that Koch should go ahead and make it anyway\u2026 Klingspor
  was sure that the end result would sell well. It did.\r\n\r\nNeuland Inline was
  used as the logo for the movie <em>Jurrasic Park</em>. The font seems all tied up
  with weird tribal art now. It is of course pure Weimar German, and not African at
  all.\r\n\r\n<strong>Discussion:</strong>\r\n<a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/39867\">Alternative
