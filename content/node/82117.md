  body: "I've looked all over for this, and couldn't even locate a name for the style
    in any of my books. Algerian Condensed is a fairly popular font that is generally
    like this, but here are four other ideas for fonts with something like this feel:
    Arched Gothic Condensed, Seminary,\r\n Hattan Antique and Coney Island (all at
    MyFonts). \r\n\r\nMaybe someone with a better collection of old type books, like
    Nick Curtis or Mark Simonson, could locate the name of the original, but I don't
    hold a lot of hope that this has been digitized.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    second that notion; it doesn't show up in any of the Conner, Kinsley or MacKellar
    specimen books of the 1870s-1800s I have, which is a bummer, because it's a whole
    lotta fun..."

  body: "Is this an Edward Lear book? Is it a British edition and if so, do you know
    who published it? Books from this era tended to be printed locally so it might
    help in tracking down the names of the original typefaces, presuming it is [[http://www.artisticprintingbook.com/|\"fancy\"
    type]] and not lettering. \r\n\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/search/coffee+bin/fonts/|Coffee
    Bin]] at MyFonts have a couple of fonts similar to the \"and\", and others from
    this era. You might also find something you like at [[www.letterheadfonts.com|Letterhead
    Fonts]], but I don't remember seeing anything digital that is very close to this."

  body: "Thanks for all the great tips on this, much appreciated. I particularly like
    Arched Gothic Condensed and Seminary, they are definitely in the right territory,
    not quite as bonkers but getting there!\r\n\r\nJustin - yes it's an old Edward
    Lear book, the only other information on the cover is R. J. Bush, 32 Charing Cross
    Road, London. \r\nThe Fancy Type book looks like a brilliant reference and the
    Coffee Bin fonts are also great."
