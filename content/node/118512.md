  body: "A boutique yacht consultancy, providing project management services. Basically,
    they manage new yacht projects from design to delivery. \r\n\r\nWarm or cool?
    Definitely a clean and sleek style, but rather beach house chic. Not the obvious
    all-white sterile minimalism. Californian modernism comes to my mind.  \r\n\r\nBrand
    ID is authentic, individual (tailored to the client), contemporary, innovative,
    refined, boutique (not corporate), sexy (but still professional), a sense of timelessness.
    Office style is casual chic, no suits and tie. To translate this into a car, I
    would say a Maserati, stylish but with a sense of understatement. In architectural
    language, probably a modernistic house somewhere in LA, like Sheats-Goldstein,
    or a modern loft.\r\n\r\nBesides that, they are a bit of the David vs Goliath
    in their industry. Small business, with vision and good taste, driven to make
    a difference, not just interested in building as much/large as they can.    \r\n\r\nFor
    fonts, I considered Futura, but a competitor is doing that, and besides it sometimes
    looks a bit rigid. For body, I thought to stick with arial, clean and professional.
    I think serif is too formal for a smaller business, in this field. For titles/headlines,
    I consider Gill Sans, maybe Proxima Nova. This site  [[http://www.fasano.com.br/]]
    using Akzidenz looks great, but then you need to use it for body text as well.
    Univers is great, but lacks some edge for headlines and titles. These people [[http://www.oneauthenticproperties.com/]]
    and [[http://www.spykercars.com/]] use DIN for a premium brand, also looks good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Thanks, Andreas. Brandon Grotesque is a great font and works very well in
    this context [[ http://www.laspiedrasfasano.com/]] Fasano is also a premium brand
    (hospitality in this case). It looks modern, warm, kind and welcoming. However,
    maybe a bit too "decorative" for project management services (even in a leisure
    business)? What do you people think?

    would be a good choice; it seems overused in North America, but much less so in
    many parts of Europe.

    Seems like I'll have to re-consider Brandon. First I thought it would look too
    \"1930's NYC\", but maybe that's not good judgement. I think Neutra looks great,
    but in this case, and for headlines, I guess it would be a bit too rigid."

  body: "[Updated post]\r\nGood suggestions. Hope you wont object if I add yet another.
    \r\nSince your business is completely unrelated to digital devices, you might
    try thin weights of Myriad, which has gained a subconscious \"good vibe\" by being
    closely linked with the \"cool\" of Apple. Few if any people would consciously
    think, \"oh, a boat from Apple.\"  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/MyriadThinInUse_5602.jpg]\r\nMyriad
    is often used for titling, .e.g. the Springer science books, but it also seems
    to work at smaller sizes. Regret I don't have a good specimen to offer. But here
    is an opinion piece that claims Myriad works at tiny sizes http://www.thebookdesigner.com/2011/02/typefaces-i-cant-live-without-adobe-myriad-pro/\r\nDon"

      of itself.\r\n\r\nIf you (@Jean Louis) don't mind, Avenir may be a good alternative.
      But mind the dribbblisation it may ensue.\r\n\r\nP.S. I remembered Akko mainly
      because of the name, not the letterform... I personally don't have much affection
      for such industrialized styles with some intentionally, <em>ex post facto</em>
      added humanism factors, but the name \"Akko\" is the diminutive form of \"Akira\"
      in Japanese \u2013 unconventional; because most such nomenclature use the full
      name, i.e. Frutiger from Adrian Frutiger."
