  i got the chance to maybe see one of my fonts being used in a pretty big videogame.
  this is really exciting for me, but im being asked to tell them what im thinking
  of in terms of licensing fees. \r\nnow, i dont have much information about this
  business. i thought that they'd be able to buy a font and use it as much as they
  want (lets say helvetica neue for example), paying an amount of money for one time.
  but how much?\r\n\r\ni already did the font more or less, i \"only\" have to do
  kerning and add some accents so that they can make a spanish/french/german interface,
  etc.\r\n\r\ni dont want to say something that is too high or too low, thats why
  im asking here.\r\n\r\nthanks for ANY help!\r\nthierry blancpain"

    James, Thierry could have ASKED that price but, since by his own admission he's
    a newbie with no sales track record and no established reputation, he could also
    have LOST the sale by asking that price. Please can the \"artistic integrity\"
    and \"affecting the whole industry\" stuff -- everyone's got to start somewhere,
    and making the sale can lead to better things down the road."

    his reputation. He created a font that a \"pretty big video game\" manufacturer
    was interested in. That is really all that matters. Do you think they care who
    created it? The fact that he sold it for 250 euro, now makes that the price the
    next time that company wants to license a font. Better to lose a sale asking the
    fair price than to get one for peanuts. \"Better things down the road\" will mean
    he is the guy to go to for a cheap license.\r\n\r\nI never said anything about

    internet access for $19.95 a month for six months, then $42.95 a month thereafter,
    they fully expect people to drop the service after the price goes up? Or, do they
    expect that, once users have tried broadband, they won't want to go back to dial-up
    again, and will pay the higher price? Special introductory offers can apply to
    other things, too..."

  body: "<em>Solution:\r\n\r\nNewbies: ask early.\r\nPros: reply promptly.</em>\r\n\r\nActually,
    Hrant, the solution is not to try to argue with someone who says apples are oranges
    when it suits his argument.\r\n\r\nShow business is the only business like no
    other; all other business is business, and what works, works. Consider ATMs: when
    they first appeared, transactions carried no fees, neither by the owner of the
    terminal nor your bank. AFTER people started using them more and more, the fees
    appeared, and nobody kicked. Now, some poor slob will pay $4.00 in fees to get
    $20.00 out of his own bank account -- in effect, 20% interest to borrow the money
    from himself. Introductory offers work.\r\n\r\nIf James feels that his livelihood
    is threatened by cut-rate fontoliers, that's one thing...I am sure he has NEVER
    sold any of his work at a discount. But EVERYONE has to start somewhere. If the
    buyer of Thierry's typeface likes his WORK, they'll come back to him, at which
    time he can explain the \"special introductory offer,\" and ask for more. If the
    buyer likes his PRICE, they can find another newcomer looking for a feather in
    his cap, and cut a deal with him."

    down with the price, because he was a poor and needy starter. I went along with
    him, because the project was very interesting. \r\nBut now I'm stuck in his opinion
    as the designer who's price you can split in half and get away with it. I had
    a fight with him about that and told him not to work for him anymore. After he
    thought about it (and sadly tried some other designers) he came back to me. This
    time I won the fight. \r\n\r\nMy argument is the same as James'. It makes no difference
    how long you've been in the type business and how many prizes you took home. Ask
    a fair and reasonable marketprice. It's the normal price and they will pay for
    it, because too they know it IS the marketprice!! You can be sure about that.

    not the point. What the other \"contributors\" to this discussion fail to realize
    is that the typeface in question <strong>is not going to be marketed as a typeface</strong>:
    it's going to be used in a videogame interface. The manufacturer is not going
    to realize any additional revenue by using Thierry's typeface: they just happen
    to like it.\r\n\r\nIf the manufacturer WERE intent on reselling the typeface,
    then I would agree that the suggested sale price was far too low; however, this
    is not the case, and the other voices here don't seem to GET that. Under these
    circumstances, my advice was perfectly reasonable and offered Thierry an excellent
    chance of making the sale, and putting that feather in his cap. Of course, he
    <strong>can</strong> ask for much more, but I sincerely doubt that he would get
