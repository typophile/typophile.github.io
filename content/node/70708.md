  figure out this font and I'm hoping I can get some new insight here. I'm hoping
  to find the exact font to the new Kodak ads they're running. Neutura is close, but
  some of the letters are different like the lowercase t. \r\n\r\nHere is an image:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kodakFont_6525.png]\r\n\r\nI
  appreciate any help you guys can offer!"

    by Ramiz Guseynov. It has some of the same idiosyncracies, but it is not identical.
    I wonder if the same designer may have created this font for Kodak?\r\n\r\n- Mike

    As far as I know, it is a customisation of Alexander McCracken\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.neutura.org/NeuturaReg.html\">Neutura</a>
    for exclusive use by Kodak. Sorry about that!"
