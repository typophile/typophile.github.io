The original basis for the typeface was to create something that had both stamina to withstand the process as well as refined details that would be eliminated by the process. I wanted to create a very straight lined classical font to apply a very conceptual idea towards.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nice.  The P reminds me of palatino gone bad.  I also like the E. It's very usable.  My only suggestions would to be to have a set x-height, as it appears (and I could be wrong) that the x-height jumps around (note the b, e, k, x and y for example.) <BR>Are you going to make a set of lowercase to go along with it?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Vicki. <BR> <BR>I don't mean this to sound rude. The letters really do look like they were developed by a <i>random process of events</i>. That may be just what you're looking for. If so, great! Please disregard my next comments, as my eyes are used to looking at type not designed by a random process, but many many years of convention: <BR> <BR>The main problem I see is that your stroke weights are inconsisent. This font looks to me like it should have two weights, a thick vertical weight, and a thin horizontal one. Compare the horzontal top of your F with the top of the O. The F is way thicker right? They should be &quot;the same&quot; (roughly) Same for the weight in the other direction. <BR> <BR>As a guide to help you, look at a Bodoni. Bodoni Bold if you have it. Your not looking for proportions (for proportions look at Trajan). Look at the thick and thins. It will be much more exagerated than in your font, but try to apply the same principles to your design. In general you will notice the thicks go from upper left to lower right, and never cross each other. The exception is the Z (upper right to lower left). <BR> <BR>As a result of the weighting issue, the color of your letters are inconsistent. Meaning, if you squint your eyes and kinda go out of focus you'll see some are darker than others. You'll notice right away the G, O, Q, and C are light. Also the U, S, K, W and A are slightly light. <BR> <BR>This won't solve all the issues but it will certainly get you on your way. Again, disregard if you know all this and are just experimenting, in which case, I will shut up now. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR>Randy</div>
