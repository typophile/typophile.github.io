  is the front of a Seattle condominium built in 1939 (edit: 1929). Text in question
  is engraved in a stone slab about halfway down. Sorry about picture quality, I know
  nothing about typography so it would be great if someone could point me in the right
  direction with this.\r\n\r\nWorst case scenario I go and take my own photo of this
  thing."

  body: "As you say, this is very small image and details are ambiguous.\r\nIn 1939
    architects still had their own lettering designs which they used for building
    inscriptions, which were done by hand. The technology of the day did not provide
    for the direct transfer of fonts to large scale letters.\r\nNevertheless, the
    lettering might have been modeled on a font rather than an architectural lettering
    design.\r\nI don't see any major conflicts with a 1926 design by Rudolf Weiss
    \ for the Bauer foundry of Frankfurt, digitized as Weiss by Adobe https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/weiss/\r\nDon"

  body: I got the date wrong, the building was finished in 1929. Anyways, what you're
    saying does make sense, Don. What I'm really looking for is just an approximation
    of this font. If you or someone else knows of and could post a font similar to
    this one in style and era, that would be very helpful.

  body: "OK 1929 would fit with a design from 1926. The architects might have wanted
    lettering with a contemporary feel rather than the traditional Trajan style inscriptions.
    Weiss reflects the ethos of the 1920s and is perhaps a fair match. Another digital
    version of it is Weiss Antiqua EF http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/weiss-antiqua/\r\nDon"
