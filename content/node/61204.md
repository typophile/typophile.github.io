  body: "I'm not a typeface buff like some (most?) other people around here, but I
    second fabergraph; it would be very interesting to see a slightly slanted version
    of these fonts.\r\n\r\nI get the feeling that something is \"crooked\", and though
    I'm not sure exactly why, it might have to do with the angle of the 'e' stroke
    misbehaving with the thinner 'n', 'm' or 'r' strokes.\r\n\r\nI think I like the
    Black better :)"

  body: "Looks nice. The \u2018s' in the black doesn't work for me though; looks too
    tightly wound? You might want to increase the baseline overshoot for it and the
    \u2018e' a tad, IMHO.\r\n________________________________________________\r\nEver

  body: "Thank you all for your comments. It's interesting that folks should mention
    the slant as I was originally planning to oblique it slightly, by about 1 degree.
    The rounder forms do still pull to the right, and I suppose that slightly obliqueing
    the others is the best solution for this as otherwise I will loose some of the
    unique characteristics of the font.\r\n\r\nI agree about the baseline overshoot.
    I will work on that. I also agree about the s in the black weight. I've worked
    on the 's' quite a bit, but it still needs a bit more work. \r\n\r\nHow do you
    feel about the E? The serifs?\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\n\r\nJeremy Dooley\r\nwww.insignedesign.com"

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sovba-Page-Source_6114.png]\r\n\r\nI've
    made a number of changes. I've fixed the overshoot, and worked on the color a
    bit. The 's' has been refined. In this context its obvious I went a bit overboard
    on the 'e' in the black weight and I need to pull that back a bit. \r\n\r\nAny
    other comments? These have been great so far. Keep 'em coming.\r\n\r\nJeremy Dooley\r\nwww.insignedesign.com"

  body: "That bold \"a\" is highly charming!\r\nBut overall this still needs a lot
    of work (as you might suspect).\r\n\r\nSlant: what you show just above is great
    - I'm a very big fan of slight slants. But your original 1 degree idea won't work
    - it's way too slight. To me a slant of 1/16 (about 3.5 degrees) is generally
    the lowest you want to go.\r\n\r\nBTW, for better or worse, this doesn't look
    at all Dutch.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
