  body: "Pretty cool. How purist do you want to be about using \"all\" trapezoids?
    Some elements don't look constructed from trapezoids. I like the K especially,
    something about the top and right-hand piece just work perfectly. I'm a little
    less keen on the X and Y-- something about the top of the X looking blobby bothers
    me, and while the Y works shape-wise, it's a bit awkward (extra lumpy on the left
    side I think). \r\n\r\nIn any case, since I'm new here, I do have a question,
    too: suppose you have a job and it doesn't require all the letters. Does it matter
    that some in the system don't quite gel right, as long as the ones you want to
    use fit the formula or rationale (e.g., \"all trapezoids\"). I figure it's a matter
    of taste, but am just curious.\r\n\r\n- Jay"

  body: "Jay:\r\n\r\nYou asked how purist I want to be about using all trapazoids.
    My only rule was that I construct it will only trapazoids, however several of
    those trapazoids overlap in order to form a glyph. The J for instance uses exactly
    four trapazoids; two overlap and two don't.\r\n\r\nThe challenge for the X is
    that I am only using overlapping trapazoids. I've attached some ideas for the
    X. Check out ty_krypton_02.pdf\r\n\r\nI've also icluded some ideas for the Y.
    I think one of these is probably a better choice.\r\n\r\nYou asked if it's ok
    to only design a few letters to fit a formula if a job doesn't require all of
    the letters. Are you referring to creating a few letters for a logo design? For
    a logo, I think its okay to design just a few glyphs that work. The typeface that
    is used for the Chevron logo only had 12 letters when CastleType was commisioned
    to do a digital version in 1996. Some changes had to be made to the original design
    to form a font. Check out castletype.pdf above."

  body: "Thanks for the responses-- there are interesting issues here. On the matter
    of sticking to a formula when one is designing a whole font vs. desinging a one-off
    logo, I agree with you completely. Just to play devil's advocate on the \"purism\"
    issue (I like the discussion and am not  trying to be a pest!), I would suggest
    that \"overlapping\" your trapezoids is a pretty big cheat, presuming you want
    to stick to all-trapezoids. I mean, at that rate, you could make any letterform
    out of any shapes, overlapping them when the going gets tough.\r\n\r\nThat said,
    I like the new second X and second Y the best. They're simple and elegant-- the
    Y has a knife-like verticality to boot (and it's truly all trapezoids, nonoverlapping!).
    The X's simplicity also carries some blandness (while most of the rest of the
    letters are more \"edgy\"), but that's a price to pay.\r\n\r\nHere's something
    I noticed-- with the subtle white lines between many of the trapezoids (at least
    that's how my PDf viewer is rendering things), it actually looks like you've made
    them out of ribbons of folded paper, some pieces being simple long strips, others
    being right-angled strips. Like origami kinda. Neat! "

  body: "Jay:\r\n\r\nThese are the letters that are made of only trapazoids: A, C,
    D, G, M, O, R, S, V, W, Y.  That leaves 15 letters and all of the numbers as non-trapazoids.
    Quite a challenge. I may give it an honest effort and see if I can build a face
    with only trapazoids. I probably would not promote the face as being made of only
    trapazoids, it would just be the underlying structure that gives uniformity to
    the face.\r\n\r\nI have uploaded ty_krypton_03.pdf with the X and Y that you said
    you preferred. I have also added the other Y to the name KRYPTON at the top of
    the file. The jury is still out for me on both of these characters.\r\n\r\nThe
    white lines you mentioned are a result of a PDF being created from Illustrator.
    If I were to use the Pathfinder tool to merge the trapazoids, the white lines
    would dissappear. I'll think about the origami angle and see if I can find a way
    to play that up somehow."

    body: Cool-- sorry it took me a while to find my way back here. I like the look.
      As you might guess, I'm not a typographer-- just a fan of typography and a generally
      curious sort. I'm for anything artful-- whether it's highly geometric, minimalist
      in formal features, etc., or deeply crafted like all your classic hand-tooled
      faces of old. Thanks again for discussion!
