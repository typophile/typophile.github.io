  in the Netherlands [short: one-two months, if it's more I don't care] , doesn't
  have to be about typography, but printed media in general.\r\n\r\nAfter looking
  for this kind of short courses for several weeks, I feel a little lost. Just couldn't
  find anything, just master studies.\r\n\r\nI have looked at Utrecht school of arts,
  KABK, ArtEZ, etc. Im looking for something not too formal, want to experiment. There's
  a school in Barcelona www.tenemosunplan.com . I'm looking for something like that
  -lots of practice- \r\n\r\nSo the question is: Do you know any academy, school,
  university... offering this kind of courses? [can be anywhere in the Netherlands,
  small or big institutions, whatever! :) ]\r\n\r\nThank you all in advance."

    to go. KABK is the only school that has a post graduate course in type called
    "type and media". If you have any questions feel free to contact me.
