  to use BorderMaker.\r\n\r\nI am away from home base -- where I have a G3 Mac running
  System 9.2 and System 8.6 -- and with me at the moment I have only my aluminum PowerBook,
  which runs Sys 10.3.9 and Classic.\r\n\r\nI have the BorderMaker folder on a b/u
  CD from my G3, so I drag-copied it onto the PowerBook, initiated the app by double-clicking
  it, Classic started up, and the splash screen appeared for BorderMaker. But now
  the app hangs and will not present a menu.\r\n\r\nI started by posting a note asking
  if anyone is still using BorderMaker. Now I am broadening this to ask help from
  anyone who can suggest how to troubleshoot the running of a Pre-Cambrian application
  on Classic.\r\n\r\nAny tips very gratefully received! I can do this in Quark but
  it sure would be nice to use Bordermaker.\r\n\r\nBruce"

  body: "68K vs. PowerMac?\r\n\r\nI kept my Quadra 800 (68K processor) until around
    2001, when it finally gave up the ghost. And the last time I used BorderMaker
    was probably before 2001. Maybe whatever work I did in BorderMaker was done on
    *that* computer, and therefore the application is not PowerMac friendly?\r\n\r\nOther
    apps in the Sys 9 folder seem to boot up just fine under Classic.\r\n\r\nThe creation
    date on the BorderMaker app is November 1994.\r\n\r\nBruce"

  body: I used to do this when I had a problem. I would shut off all but basic fonts
    and see if that works. If so find which font is crashing. 2nd I would take half
    the extensions out of the extension folder. If it works I would put half of the
    extensions that I removed back if it crashes I know its in that group etc. Most
    of the time it was a font sometimes it was an extension. Sometimes it's a conflict
    with another app running.

  body: "I didn't see this until WLD posted. You need to restart under System 9, then
    install BorderMaker. You should then be able to restart under OS X and run BM
    using Classic mode. If you haven't done that before, go to System Preferences
    and click on Start Up Disk and select OS 9, then restart and install BorderMaker.
    To switch back to OS X while using OS 9, go to Control Panels. From there you
    can select OS X from the Start Up Disk preferences. \r\n\r\nThe problem is that
    BorderMaker is looking for system preferences and extensions that weren't install.
    And you can't install them while running in Classic mode. At least that's been
    my experience. \r\n\r\nI hope that works for you."
