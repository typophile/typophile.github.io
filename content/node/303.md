  just wondering:  <BR> <BR>Does anyone have a good block of text to check letter
  spacing?  <BR> <BR>How about a phrase that&#39;s good for checking kerning pairs?  <BR>
  <BR>Any help would be greatly appreciated. '

  body: ' Andrew, don&#39;t get hung up on short phrases, or kerning pairs - spacing
    first, kerning after. Just get some decent runs of text and go from there. It
    doesn&#39;t actually  matter whether the font is for text or display usage, a
    decent run of text will show up the character and spacing anomalies - short phrases
    won&#39;t. <BR> <BR>If you want to go all the way - in an abstract manner - generate
    every character next to every other. Again the anomalies are apparent. '

  body: ' &#62; spacing first, kerning after. <BR> <BR>That will indeed cover you
    90%, at least in the mainstream. <BR>But for that last stretch of quality, they
    really have to be done in parallel &#40;as much as feasible&#41;. Certainly, few
    designers do that, but that&#39;s only because even fewer users care. <BR> <BR>BTW,
    kerning even affects the letterforms themselves, not just the sidebearings. <BR>
    <BR>&#62; It doesn&#39;t actually matter whether the font is for text or display
    usage <BR> <BR>? <BR>I think it matters a huge deal. <BR>Especially when you consider,
    for example, that cap-cap setting is much more common in display. But there are
    in fact deeper differences between display and text, even in spacing/kerning.
    <BR> <BR>&#62; generate every character next to every other. <BR> <BR>That&#39;s
    of course completely impractical. <BR>Which is exactly why you need &#42;both&#42;
    test strings and long &#34;real&#34; text to arrive at good results without spending
    20 years on it. <BR> <BR>So, Andrew: it&#39;s not that simple.  :-/ <BR> <BR>hhp '

    runs out of steam for you &#40;different people have a different tolerance/appreciation
    for quality&#41;, you have to decide how much further to take the &#34;quatitative&#34;
    approach. I personally take it very far - like in assigning spacing values to
    serifs. <BR> <BR>Depending on how far you take quantification &#40;noting that
    it has to end somewhere&#41;, you&#39;ll be left relying on the &#34;eye&#34;
    to different degrees. The more you rely on the eye, the longer it takes, and the
    more error prone it is. But, again, it&#39;s not something to be avoided, just
    balanced judiciously against the &#34;math&#34;. <BR> <BR>Rely on real text only
    when you can&#39;t go any further with test strings. There are many reasons for
    this, not least that your font might be used for a language you don&#39;t even
    know exists. <BR> <BR>hhp'
