  body: You can use [[http://www.fontlab.com/font-converter/transtype/|TransType]],
    in which you'll easily group separate fonts into one family/suitcase or you can
    do it manually by editing those fonts' <em>name</em> tables with [[font editors|any
    font editor]] which supports their format.
