  body: Definitely not hand-lettered--look at the A's--all the same and so are the
    rest of the repeating characters. Probably out of someone's case a long time ago.
    Nice, though, does remind of Gotham.

  body: "Getting consistent lettershapes when doing lithographic artwork was fairly
    easy \u2014 the artist would use a type of transfer (meaning he or she would draw
    a letter and using appropriate paper to transfer to and reapply on the stone or
    zinc plate). So: handlettered & clean!"

    body: "I l know, used to do it myself and my grandfather was a sign painter. But
      look at the negative space in the \"A\" at different sizes and the blob at the
      end of the top crossbar of the \"E.\" \r\n\r\nI too, thought it was hand lettered
      the first time I looked at it with the asymetrical \"A's\" and the bugling bottom
      curve of  the \"O's\", and it is very beautiful. But when I look very closely
      at it, it just feels \"set\" to me."

      body: Okay, I looked at it again and I'm waffling--it's impossible on a computer
        screen. If it is hand done, it is very good.

    mean paint brush. Some of the work that Dwiggins did, for example, is quite astonishing.

    body: Yeah, I have some photos of my grandfather's work--just beautiful. Then
      he taught my father and when I was very young, I used to watch him in amazement.
      He loved when they invented magic markers. Then he taught me. And one day he
      watched me cut a silkscreen frisket in Souvenir (sorry) and he was so proud.

  body: "In the old days, when they did lithographed posters like this, they did not
    use type at all. Everything--even small print--was done by hand. It was not like
    it is now when practically anything that looks like type almost always is. There
    were, in fact, practical reasons why they did not use type. \r\n\r\nFirst, type
    was available only in specific sizes, up to about an inch tall for metal, larger
    for wood. Even so, if the type was a little too big or too small, tough luck.
    Theoretically, you could photograph the type and enlarge or reduce it, but that
    was too complicated and expensive at the time. Instead, there was a whole army
    of lettering artists ready to step in whenever you wanted greater control over
    how your letters looked, including the simple (to us) case of making them fit
    nicely into a layout. These people became all but obsolete when phototype, stat
    cameras, and offset printing became the norm. \r\n\r\nSecond (and more important),
    posters like this were made by drawing or painting the art actual size onto lithographic
    stone. (Hint: lith = stone, graph = draw). You couldn't use metal or wood type
    to put letters on a lithographic stone because the surface is hard and smooth.
    Type was designed to work with the soft, absorbent surface of paper. Even if you
    could have used type, the image would be backwards from what you need. The art
    on lithographic stones had to be wrong-reading so that when it was transfered
    to paper it would be right-reading. Type printed onto stone would thus be backwards
    from what was needed.\r\n\r\nSorry for the lecture, but I sense that there seems
    to be somewhat of a lack of knowledge concerning graphic arts history here.\r\n\r\nShort
    answer: Most letters on posters made before the 1950s were done by hand, even
    when it looks an awful lot like type."

    reference, myfonts.com has a really nifty font-identification app called \"Whatthefont.\"\r\n\r\nYou
    upload a jpeg of the font, walk it through identifying the letters themselves,
    and then it tries to match it based upon its database of known fonts. It hasn't
    failed me yet.\r\n+\r\nRyan Ford"
