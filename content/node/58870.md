  new Barclaycard identity aims to convey a calm, confident exterior while being warm
  and vibrant on the inside... and that the globe motif represents a \"chip\" being
  released from the constraints of the plastic card and welcomed in by new, exciting
  methods of payment.</cite>\r\n\r\nThe thing for me is that it's so generic and anonymous.
  And <cite>empty inside</cite>. More discussion and comparisons [[http://www.creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2008/september/an-ordinary-world|here]].
  You can add the new Xerox logo to that list too; what is it with shiny balls and
  'friendly' text?"

    What outstanding BS. :-)\r\n\r\nAnother logo for this crowd:\r\nhttp://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/xerox_the_very_very_very_shiny.php#204365"

    like the way the ball moves and flashes like a photocopier, though not sure that's
    intentional or not.\r\n\r\nThis Barclaycard one looks like all sorts of weird
    things. Some kind of shredded tulip, a rubber glove caught in the wind, an empty
    egg, a vortex of paperwork...not really what a bank wants to convey surely!\r\n\r\nMaybe
    I'll make a compilation of naff logos; I'd have to do the same for nice ones though
