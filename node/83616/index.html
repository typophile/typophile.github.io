		<div class="commentbody">Gill with Futura-esque alternates seems like it could be right. Re: Kubrick nerds, I seemed to remember some related discussion over at alt.movies.kubrick and just found it again; basically people there are either saying it's some version of Futura (with a rogue M), or some version of Gill (with other changes). I think the latter is probably more likely.
Some links for reference:

BTW, note that the sequence title for «The Dawn of Man» apparently uses an entirely different typeface. :-)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">In the pre-digital age (and <em>2001</em> was pre-digital by some 15 years), movie titles had to be photographed from a hard-copy original. To use type for this was needlessly difficult, as it would have required having a printer set up your titles in metal type (the largest sizes they had) and printing a one-off reproduction proof to be photographed. It was much easier to hire an artist to handletter titles, and most movie titles were handlettered until the 1960s. 
By the late 1960s, Photolettering was around, and might have been used for the <em>2001</em> titles. Changing fonts in the middle of a word would have been a pain in the a55, but nevertheless possible, and it's the sort of fussy detail I could easily imagine Kubrick insisting on.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The typeface certainly has the "feel" of Gill Sans, in a lighter version, even if the shapes of some specific letters indicate otherwise.

So I would look at the various sans-serif typefaces that were in use in Britain at the time.

Apparently, though, what happened was that the titles were done in the U.S., and thus, Gill Sans wasn't handy... and for a typeface with a similar feel to that (or maybe to Futura) it looks like they used Intertype's Vogue. At least, [[http://www.abstractfonts.com/font/12605|Am Sans]], said to resemble Vogue, looks like these titles.</div>

Vogue is quite similar to Neutraface which might also work but again it's that gosh-darned M (which I could potentially just steal from Gil but it would probably look like I did just that)

The custom letters don't quite match Gill Sans, but the others are exact matches for Futura. There is a slight unevenness in the spacing that suggests to me that it was film setting (or maybe process lettering), and not metal type. The presence of custom letters also points to this.

If this was the case, you're not likely to find an exact match (or even a close match) in an existing digital font. Although you could try combining Futura and Gill Sans, assuming you could match the size and weights.</div>

It looks like I'm unlikely to find a digital match for this, which is a shame, and since Kubrick fans are notoriously detail oriented, if it's not spot on they'll notice right away.

So again, I think I'm looking at a cut and paste job. There are worse fates in life...</div>
