  usage probably predates by decades.  I apologize for the quality, it was the best
  I could do given the relative scarcity of surviving material within reach.\r\n\r\n1.
  \ SovietBookText.jpg:  typical body text face found in virtually every Soviet textbook,
  also used in newspapers, other official publications.\r\n\r\n2.  GOST1.jpg:  Title
  block on state standards/specs documents.\r\n\r\n3.  GOST2.jpg:  Alternate title
  block on state standards/specs documents.\r\n\r\n4.  PravdaRadio.jpg:  used in text
  boxes in Pravda, in this case the extensive TV and radio schedule.\r\n\r\n5.  PravdaMasthead.jpg:
  \ The (in)famous Pravda masthead, still used at the tabloid successor, pravda.ru;
  \ same typeface was also used for Red Star (Krasnaya Zvezda);  have never seen it
  anywhere else, but was wondering if an entire typeface character set was ever developed.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance."

  body: "One book I have says that Romana was a German variant of DeVinne. There was
    an H. Berthold face from around 1900 called Lateinisch which was even more similar,
    including the serif at the top of the A. Probably it's a cyrillic adaptation of
    that style.\r\n\r\nI've seen Art Nouveau faces similar to the Pravda masthead,
    but I think it was probably custom. \r\n\r\nHey, look! Oprah is mentioned! Are
    you sure this is authentic? (Just kidding.)"
