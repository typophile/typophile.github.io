    those who were not at the conference, there are more pictures -- many of eating
    and drinking -- at  <BR><a href="http://www.porchez.com/article/139/thessaloniki-2004-part-1"

    <BR>It was a great conference, and I thoroughly encourage more Typophiles to attend
    the next one &#40;probably in 2008, unless Klimis is inspired again before then&#41;.

  body: Boy, I woulda loved to have been there for that legibility panel!  You and
    Hrant can really go at it &#40;it&#39;s all good though&#41;. <BR> <BR>Any way
    to see any kind of &#34;transcript&#34; at all?

  body: I was moderating the panel, so didn&#39;t really have a chance to go at it
    with Hrant. Actually, we get on much better in person than electronically. The
    panel was good, I thought, and furthered a lot of mutual understanding. It was
    supposed to be recorded &#40;I have not yet confirmed that it was&#41;, so a transcript
    should be included in the published proceedings of the conference.

  body: John did a great job moderating that panel discussion, and I learned some
    important things, from Kevin especially&#42;. The conference was killer, and I
    made some nice new acquaintances too. Don&#39;t miss it next time! <BR> <BR>&#42;
    BTW, check out his essay in the current Eye. Now I really have to write up a formal
    rebuttal.  :-&#62; <BR> <BR>BTW, I was also lucky to be in Omonia square on the
    night of the Euro2004 final! Man, what an experience that was. Although it took
    two hours to get back to the hotel!  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    can publish the full article at microsoft.com/typography <BR> <BR>Being in Greece
    for the football certainly added to the fun - the France win and the celebrations
    in Thessa were the highlight...  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/40927.jpg"
    alt=""> <BR> <BR> ...but being on Santorini for the semi and for the final was
    special too - distress flares and kids running around wearing flags. Great stuff.

  body: I took some &#34;air shots&#34; with a disposable b&amp;w camera <BR>at Omonia&#42;
    that night - I&#39;ll get it developed soon... <BR> <BR>&#42; Actually Kotzia
    square, right off of Omonia - that&#39;s where the main public bigsceen was. <BR>
    <BR>We actually started heading back to the hotel moments after the end of the
    match &#40;having had a preview of sorts during the semi in Thessaloniki...&#41;,
    and we saw the entire city converging en masse on the very spot we were trying
    to leave. It boggles the mind to imagine what that place must have been like probably
    until dawn! Which is about when we took the taxi to the airport... <BR> <BR>Unforgettable
    stuff. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    &#40;maybe the engraver&#39;s name&#41;. <BR>The year says 1327. If that&#39;s
    a Hajeera date, it&#39;s only ~1909, which seems too young. <BR> <BR> <BR>hhp
