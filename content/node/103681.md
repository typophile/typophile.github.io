  programs to do this, but I'd like to do it the hard way:-) Moreover, I'd like a
  student to work on this as part of a project.\r\n\r\nI'd appreciate any pointers
  to find information about OpenType font files and how to generate them. Ideally,
  I'd like to create the font files using some Java library. If there's any Java library
  that you can recommend then please let me know.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your
  help."

  body: "Using Javascript (which is not Java), I created <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/94235\">IndyFont</a>.
    It uses outlines the user draws with InDesign, so I didn't have to write a font
    <em>drawing</em> program. The script gathers outlines, converts them into Type
    1 instructions, adds a OTF wrapper around it and dumps it into a file.\r\n\r\nI
    already had extensive experience with the <a href=\"http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/font/T1_SPEC.PDF\">Type
    1 font format</a>, the OTF part came from <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/\">Microsoft's
    Typography site</a>.\r\n\r\nThat's all you need to get started -- well, that and
    ~3 months of continuous (nights only) work. It took me that long to write something
    to export an InDesign-drawn rectangle as a working font. YMMV.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Ideally,

    not really \"the hard way\" is it?"

      better. I want to do the design part in Java as well, writing the software from
      scratch. I was hoping there was some library that let me export all information
      to the font file. Even if there's a library that lets me export some glyphs
      and meta-information to the font file, that would be quite some work."

      for.
