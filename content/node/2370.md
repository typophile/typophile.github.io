body: 'I&#39;m selling my Font Book from Digital Typeface Compendium. It includes
  the Font Finder brochure as well. I wanted to offer it for sale here first before
  uploading it to eBay. If it sells here, I&#39;ll donate half the proceeds to Typophile.
  This is a serious offer. For more information, here&#39;s a link to the book on
  Amazon: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/3930023024/103-3926384-5127865?v=glance&amp;vi=reviews"
  target="_blank">The Font Book</a> <BR> <BR>If you&#39;re interested, I prefer PayPal
  as a payment method. Email me for further details: <a href="mailto:dylan@customartco.com">dylan@customartco.com</a>'

  body: The book&#39;s barely been opened... maybe a few times. The Font Finder brochure
    has a slightly dog-eared corner. Other than that, both books are in excellent
    condition. Minimum bid? Huh... never thought of it. It sells for just over $100
    currently... Your thoughts?

  body: I guess the Typophile donation aspect is an extra incentive... In fact I think
    you&#39;ll get more for it here than on eBay because of that &#40;since it&#39;s
    a normally available thing&#41;. I&#39;ll think about it. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: That&#39;s a very generous offer Dylan. The book retails for $98. Can I suggest
    asking for a minimum bid and then putting an end date for your auction here?

  body: Sure, let&#39;s say $10 minimum bid to get things rolling, and we&#39;ll auction
    it for five days. If that sounds good, let it roll. If not, I&#39;m open to any
    suggestions.

    bid with than just the money you save on their presents. <BR>Now if anyone will
    offer me $100 apiece for these 2, I can put a bid in for the book... <BR><img

    target="_blank">FontBook</a>, <BR>I can vouch for its value. It is the best font
    sample reference <BR>available. The best. I have two - one for work, one for home.
    <BR>It&#39;s worth at least the retail $100. <BR> <BR>By the way, it&#39;s published
    by FontShop, not &#34;Digital Typeface <BR>Compendium&#34;. That&#39;s just the
    subtitle. ;&#41;
