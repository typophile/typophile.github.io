  with Adobe Jenson (main text face). It's for an invitation. \r\nAny suggestions

  body: "LTC Metropolitan Italic Alt was based on Beatrice Warde's 1925 Arrighi design
    -- you know, the one that was 'tamed' and then paired with Roger's Centaur? --
    and therefore, can be set alongside the likes of Adobe Jenson. You might, however,
    want to use the same roman for setting the main text.\r\n\r\nOr P22 Operina if
    you like to play rough. It was also based on Arrighi's italic, by the way."

    might be too close unless you use some of the alternates. Check out <a href=\"http://store.adobe.com/type/browser/pdfs/POEQ/PoeticaStd.pdf\">this

  body: "If LTC Metropolitan is not available in an opentype format, or if you don't
    intend to use Metropolitan Roman to set the text, I would totally go for Poetica
    -- simply because pairing two Venetian faces, one roman and one italic, is one
    tough act to pull.\r\n\r\nBy the way, what was Poetica based on? It definitely
    have sharper hooks and more complicated (but rather conservative, in comparison
    to Arrighi's) ligatures and swashes. Was it based on a more contemporary italic?"

  body: "Adobe Jenson Italic, with the swashes, is great in itself, and you have the
    optical sizes to match the size you're going to print. I'd try it first. \r\n\r\nBy
    the way Poetica matches Minion. The structure of its italic is quite different
    from Adobe Jenson's italic. "

  body: I agree, that is the best idea so far. I failed to consider the fact that
    Adobe Jenson did have accompanying swashes with its italic.
