<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hello all -- <br> <br>My name is Andy and I'm currently a graphic design student at San Diego State University. I'm a big fan of the typophile critique discussion group and have been looking forward to posting a typeface of my own design for critique. <br> <br>I'm a little bit eager to get some feedback on a face I'm currently working on, so I'm posting the completed lowercase set before moving on to finishing up the bits and pieces of uppercase and figures that I've started. Please let me know what you all think. <br> <br>When I started out this typeface, my intention was to create a simplified blackletter typeface that is able to be stenciled. As you can see I have definately digressed from this original plan but it still hints to its calligraphic roots. <br> <br>Thanks! <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1477.gif alt="Stencil Fraktur"></div>

<div class=commentbody> I forgot to mention one thing. I've included both regular and roudned versions. I think the rounded version is a little easier on the eyes. Let me know what you think </div>

<div class=commentbody>Miles Newlyn's <a href=http://www.emigre.com/dp/getfontpage.php?PSabR.html target=_top>Sabbath Black</a> immediately comes to mind. <br>Yours is more distressed and uses simpler forms and I <br>think that works well. Yes, the rounded edges are more <br>appropriate for the theme, which I think of more as <br>stamped and worn rather than stenciled. <br> <br>The 'u' and 'v' could use some more differentiation. <br>Note how Newlin adds a flourish to his 'v' and a foot <br>on the 'u' to make them distinguishable forms. <br> <br>Overall it's pretty cool and I can see it used in a variety <br>of ways - both with the classic history in mind and in <br>more grunge/punk DIY pieces. <br> <br>Stephen</div>

<div class=commentbody> > I'm posting the completed lowercase set before <br> <br>Good idea - caps are secondary anyway - numerals tertiary. <br> <br>First of all, the rounded form isn't just "easier on the eyes", it seems much more authentic too. So that's what I'm looking at. What I see is that it works quite well, I'm just unsure about the "downhill"s on the "f" and "t". And I agree with Stephen that there's a problem with the "u"/"v". What really needs the most work though are the "s" and "z". BTW, I think you forgot the smooth the tail of the "j". <br> <br>hhp </div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi, <br> <br>I'm sorry but I mostly desagry with precedent post. <br>I really like the idea, but what interest me in your font is the reinterpretation of historical reference, adapt to a more modern aesthetic. <br> <br>It's the reason why I prefer the first version, more geometrical. The result is more unique, less revival, more inspired. <br>I don't like the round vervion, it's make no sens for me. <br> <br>I am personnaly a fan of stencil font and I think you should go further that way. <br>To do so, you could try to regulate the space between part of the same glyph. For example, the </div>

<div class=commentbody>Andy, I think this is really sweet. And I, unlike <br>Anouk, love the Rounded version. I think that, your historical inspiration aside, the Rounded is more true to the finished result of what this is </div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi Andy. I think this project would be worth finishing, I like the second/less angular
version best. u and v are a bit to close in form, s and z could use a little closing up.
Are you doing any caps? How about a unicase instead of caps?
