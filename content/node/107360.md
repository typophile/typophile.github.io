  am not sure if they are from a font or were custom for the doors only. Any help
  would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: I can't find this exact font but I found one very similar to it. It was published
    in 1999 by Bright Ideas (a defunct foundry), is named <strong>Stacker</strong>,
    and is now apparently freeware available on the net. Do a search for "Bright Ideas
    Stacker font", in quotes, to find a download link.

  body: "The one I would go with is -Stack.\r\n\r\nI remember it from the Letragraphica
    section at the back of the old 70's-80's Letraset catalogue.\r\nAlthough Bowfin
    has it listed from a Spanish Letraset page scan, and Luc Devroye seems to have
    the same pic.\r\nNot sure about a digital version though.\r\nHope this helps.\r\n\r\nhttp://bowfinprintworks.com/LinedFontGuide05.html\r\nhttp://luc.devroye.org/fonts-51663.html"

    as displayed in the Letraset Product Manual of 1985:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/StackFacePhotosettingSM_3627.jpg]\r\nThe
    image in the book would permit a more detailed scan for anyone who wishes to digitize
    the font.\r\nDon"
