  body: "\"<em>What I am looking for is a dictionary to check the spelling of as many
    words as possible</em>.\" is is very broad question. Do you mean the world's biggest?
    Most popular? Most languages? Sold most copies? Electronic? Reviewed? Up to date?\r\n\r\nCan
    you provide a little more background information about yourself and this project?
    Is it personal, academic, or professional? Who is your audience? What are their
    goals? Information like this will help people provide you with more meaningful
    feedback.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary#Major_English_dictionaries\">Wikipedia's
    page on \"Major English dictionaries\"</a> has many options. Be mindful that certain
    people the same word different ways of spelling the same word (eg, Americans =
    color, Canadians = colour).\r\n\r\nI am not a linguist so I cannot offer much
    advice, but I fairly confidant that the people who designed this system double
    checked their sources. From their page, they appear to be an American company
    so they probably use an American English dictionary.\r\n\r\nI still fear something
    is getting lost in translation (pun intended). Are you coming from an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESL\">ESL</a>
    perspective and looking at issues of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spelling_reform\">spelling
    reform</a>? Are you interested in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthography\">orthography</a>
    they used?\r\n\r\nYou may want to research <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Spelling_Society\">The
    Simplified Spelling Society</a>. You have most likely read <a href=\"http://www.eyemagazine.com/feature.php?id=117&fid=524\">this
    article that Eye magazine published about the Initial Teaching Alphabet<a>. \r\n\r\nTo
    rephrase and clarify your question, do you mean:\r\n\r\n\"<strong>What is the
    <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_source\">primary source</a> that
    the <a href=\"http://initialteachingalphabet.org/\">Initial Teaching Alphabet
    Foundation</a> used to determine the spelling of the words they selected when
    they originally developed the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_Teaching_Alphabet\">Initial
    Teaching Alphabet<a></strong>?\""

  body: "Apologies if I have been unclear. What I am looking for is a dictionary where
    I can look up how to spell, for example, the word 'rules' using the ITA. Looking
    at the ITA chart that gives examples of how to pronounce each letter, I can see
    that there is a traditional 's', 'z' and a reversed 'z'. Now, if I am unsure of
    which letter to use to replace the 's' in the traditionally spelled word 'rules',
    it would be helpful to look this word up in a dictionary that shows how an American
    English word would be spelled using the letters and orthography of the ITA. Such
    a dictionary exists for the UNIFON alphabet and is extremely helpful.\r\n\r\nAs
    for my background, I am a Graphic Designer specializing in typography and book
    design, currently studying for an MA in Graphic Design. My original research question
    was 'Can I achieve greater correspondence between the spoken and written language
    by adapting an alphabet or creating a new writing system?', which led me to research
    alphabets such as the ITA and UNIFON. I am therefore, interested in both the orthography
    and the design of the letters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n "

    I did not understand that \"\u2026words set in the ITI\u2026\" meant \"\u2026words

    you are looking for:\r\n\r\nDowning, J. A. (1963). The Augmented Roman Alphabet
    for Learning to Read. <em>The Reading Teacher, 16(5)</em>, 325\u2013336.\r\n\r\nOn
    pages 326-7 they illustrate 32 glyphs (some characters, some ligatures) and a
    few words set using them. You may need database access to get this article. If
    you do not have immediate access, contact me and I can pass it on.\r\n\r\nIf you

    children to read, rather than serve as a phonetic alphabet, was allowed to represent
    the same sound in more than one way, in order that in some cases there would not
    be too large a divergence between ITA spellings and conventional English spellings.\r\n\r\nI
    could be mistaken, but if that is the case, that would reduce its applicability
    to your question. The answer to that question, though, of course is \"Yes\" -
    look at the Shaw Alphabet, or the suggestions of the Simplified Spelling Society
    - I recall a book by Mont Follick, in which the use of a new alphabet was avoided.
    The trick was using ' to indicate where two consecutive vowels did not form a
    dipthong."
