body: Something new has happened here at Typophile. We&#39;ve added a new membership
  section and it is only for the girls! Several of you heard about it at TypeCon,
  and tonight Jared made it so. Before we open up the floodgates, so to speak, I wanted
  to hear from the girls. What do you think it can become? What do you want it to
  be? Should it be exclusively X chromosome? I&#39;ve already got a t-shirt contest
  in mind. We are discussing different possibilities for membership, so let me know
  what you think it is worth.  <BR>

    <BR> <BR>&#40;Though I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d want to be a member. Can I be a
    &#34;Betty?&#34; You can dress me in oversized lady&#39;s clothes and bring me

  body: Haha! Good reply Paul. One of the main reasons behind forming this &#34;club&#34;,
    is to get more girls/woman to participate. As much as I love the odds, I&#39;d
    much rather share with other girls. Take TypeCon for instance, I heard someone
    mention that this year had more girls than ever participating. I think that is
    wonderful. The idea of being an Alphabetty is simply to show our presence, as
    a group, in the the bigger group of typographers, type designers, visual communicators
    and artists. Anyone can tell you that I&#39;m one of the least sexist people on
    the planet. &#40;long pause&#41; I suppose the way I objectify Jude Law isn&#39;t
    healthy though. ;&#41;

  body: No, objectifying men is good! This may be a little off-topic, but I always
    felt that if we want to even things out, either we need to 1&#41; stop objectifying
    women or 2&#41; objectify men more. And hey, some women like being objectified,
    so why deny them that right? Ergo, I pick 2&#41;.  <BR> <BR>So what are your ideas
    for the T-shirt contest?

    how I feel about the whole to objectify or not to objectify topic. <BR> <BR>I
    have something specific in mind, very middle third of the last century &#40;haha&#41;.
    But I&#39;m thinking we&#39;ll open the gates &#40;soon&#41; and let others post
    their ideas. I&#39;m not so sure I&#39;ll open the voting up to the guys &#40;sorry&#41;.
    But, as soon as we nail that down I&#39;ll let you know. So for now, maybe just
    start sketching.

    under your name. Notice that I&#39;m now a Short Cap. That will say Alphabetty.
    That detail isn&#39;t hammered out yet.

    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> --- Someone told me about that at TypeCon. I think it
    was Jill Bell. With the name of Alphabetty, it is already tongue in cheek, but
    I think it is very important that the work and talent of its members should come
    first.

    on? <BR>--- <BR>I don&#39;t want to distance us at all. Well, not much, I realize
    forming the Alphabetty group itself does distance a bit. But it&#39;s members
    would only use excuses such as TypeCon and ATypI to meet and discuss over lunch
    &#40;or something&#41;.

    We&#39;re not distancing ourselves. We&#39;re just setting up an environment that
    encourages a more specified topic of discussion is all.

    and foremost - i don&#39;t see here a lot of girls - so why to do it exclusive?
    <BR> <BR>2. maybe forum about -  design  &amp; women  - the woman as art director;  the
    woman as type designer etc etc  <BR> <BR>3. why i can&#39;t hear/read what do
    you think about something, anything? just since of the &#34;woman/girl thing&#34;

    a sloppy wine drunk on Friday night.&#41; <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s the deal, for me.
    We chicas need and want to develop a separate space because we are currently in
    the minority. I&#39;m hoping that changes someday and this is one way to make
    that happen.  <BR> <BR>There are a tremendous amount of supportive and encouraging
    men in this field, but there&#39;s still that speed bump women need to climb over
    when confronted with a room full of  one type of human being, which in this case
    is predominantly white, hetero men. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think we need to be either
    exclusive or private -- just focused on women. <BR> <BR>

    <BR>I think this is precisely why &#34;to do it exclusive.&#34; I doubt the percentage
    of women posting in these forums accurately represents the number of women interested
    in the topics and lurking. By and large, women have their own conversational style
    [see the studies of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/index%3Dbooks%26field-keywords%3DDeborah%20Tannen%26url%3Dindex%3Dbooks%26store-name%3Dbooks/102-5443600-8270563"
    target="_blank">Deborah Tannen</a>, et al.] and I think many of the threads here
    quickly diverge from an environment where they care to participate.  <BR> <BR>I
    don&#39;t have a problem with exclusivity -- you go, girls! I do hope, however,
    that from time to time you&#39;ll return to join the rest of us floundering plebes
    and share your wisdom. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>

    absolutely must be a forum in which women can freely discuss them.  <BR> <BR>I
    don&#39;t see this as being about divisiveness at all; rather, it&#39;s about
    women communicating with and assisting other women. And I think that, for this

    women users only. Whether men can lurk should, in my opinion, be entirely up to
    the Alphabetties. <BR> <BR>We&#39;re not going to lose Tiffany, Kristin, and Dyana;

  body: Tiffany, killer idea. Minorities naturally need to  bind together more. Majorities
    simply need to understand that, and not use it as a license to amplify their own
    exclusivity. Just make sure you don&#39;t get too cute or pink. Don&#39;t try
    to be &#34;as good as the boys, but different&#34; - be <i>girls</i> - leverage
    that to the max. <BR> <BR>BTW, if we ever have a Male-only type club, we should
    be called Finials. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>
