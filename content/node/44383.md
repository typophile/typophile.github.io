    we can best recommend wether a typeface or hand lettering is right for you.\r\n"

    original set up. The Roman caps are so blurry I cannot even get a gear on the
    face. Any of the Old Style italic caps could be used and a local calligrapher
    could handle the rest. See what P22 has in their Lanston collection.\r\nMichael"
