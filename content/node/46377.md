body: "I was wondering if our goodly Typophile (web)masters would be willing to add
  a custom Typophile icon to the website, so when those of us with iPhones/iPod make
  home screen bookmarks for the site, we'd get the cool Typophile T instead of a tiny
  white box with specks on it (it automatically uses an image of the webpage if no
  icon is present.\r\n\r\nIt's <a href=\"http://www.askdavetaylor.com/how_to_create_custom_apple_iphone_website_icon.html\">very
  simple</a>: you just drop a .PNG on your site in the prescribed way (see linked
  instructions for details) and the iPhone/Touch will pick it up, round the corners
  and add that shiny look automatically for anyone who adds it to their home screen
  (which I have).\r\n\r\nAs a designer, I am pained at the lack of a swank Tyophile
  badge on my home screen, and would be grateful to those empowered to make one available.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
