body: I&#39;m working on a television station for a retirement home. The fonts have
  to be big and bold. I&#39;m thinking of using Segoe bold for some of the text messages.
  I&#39;m open for font selections. For the text only messages on screens, what is
  the easiest readability/legible style for typing out paragraphs. Capitalizing the
  fist letter of each sentence, or first letter of every word or each word in caps?
  Some of the viewers are very old so I have to keep that in mind. Any help would
  be appreciated. Thanks~&#62;

    <BR>This was designed for the visually impaired for the screen. I would recommend
    uppercase only for the first letter of the first word and proper nouns, readers
    are accustomed to this and initial caps are one of my pet hates.
