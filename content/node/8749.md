  there an equivalent &#40;close, not exact, would be fine also&#41; to this PC font?<img

  body: I have numerous Mac fonts, and I would love to be able to use one I already
    own. Can anyone suggest a similar-looking Mac font?

  body: Mark, asking us to guess which similar Mac fonts you might have is a bit difficult.
    Almost any commercial font is available in Mac &amp; PC formats, it&#39;s  &#39;freeware&#39;
    that is often only available in one format.  <BR> <BR>My suggestion is to search
    through the <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/ScriptIDGuide.html" target="_blank">Script
    Font ID Guide</a>, Parts 1, 2, 7 and 8, and see which fonts resemble Vladimir
    to your eye, and see if you have them in your collection.

  body: I&#39;ve had pretty good luck using FontAgent Pro on Mac OS X to use PC TTF
    fonts. This utility is produced by Insider Software. You just copy the font file
    over and use it directly; you don&#39;t need to convert it or anything. <BR> <BR>If
    you send me the font I can test it out for you. <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/blush.gif"
    border=0> Just kidding! Actually, I already have Vladimir. I don&#39;t need or
    want a pirated copy. <BR> <BR>Seriously, I recommend using FontAgent Pro since
    it avoids file conversion, and it seems to be able to use most PC TTF fonts directly.

  body: As a die-hard OS 9 user, I was hoping there was someone who could eyeball
    the font and say, akin to Arial or Univers or Swiss, &#34;Use Helvetica on the
    Mac.&#34; <BR> <BR>Once I have Quark OS X &#40;on the way&#41;, these issues will
    go away--I assume I&#39;ll just use the PC font in its native .TTF file format.
    <BR> <BR>I always assumed this board was created so that designers wouldn&#39;t
    HAVE to use &#34;the Script Font ID Guide, Parts 1, 2, 7 and 8, and see which
    fonts resemble Vladimir to your eye&#34;.

  body: Well Mark, that suggestion was supposed to make it simpler for you use your
    OWN judgement about which fonts were similar enough to meet your needs, rather
    than have me guess. Those portions of the Guide are not big, and you only need
    to see related styles instead of looking at all scripts. <BR> <BR>Since you can&#39;t
    spare the time &#40;unlike us, apparently&#41;, I would suggest Orion Script &#40;on
    one of the Dover font CD&#39;s with Solotype fonts&#41; or <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=206358"
    target="_blank">Saxony Script</a>, or else my original suggestion of buying the
    Mac version. <BR> <BR>Sorry to keep you waiting.

  body: Mark, I am quite disappointed by your stab at Mike. He has  <BR>proven time
    and again to go <i>way</i> beyond the call of duty in  <BR>order to identify a
    typeface. <BR> <BR>Sometimes it just isn&#39;t that easy or clear cut. You said
    yourself  <BR>that you wanted to use a font you already own. First problem -  <BR>we
    haven&#39;t got the faintest idea what you&#39;ve got installed on  <BR>your machine.
    Second problem - a &#34;similar looking font&#34; is  <BR>open to interpretation
    when talking about scripts. There are  <BR>countless alternatives, and we don&#39;t
    know which specific  <BR>quality of Vladimir you want to see in that &#34;similar
    looking  <BR>font&#34;. Third - if anyone would know that alternative, we&#39;d  <BR>certainly
    tell you straight away instead of directing you to  <BR>the Script Font ID Guide.
    Fourth - if <i>you</i> don&#39;t want to invest  <BR>the time and effort in looking
    up something you fancy in a  <BR>nicely delimited selection, I don&#39;t see why
    would <i>we</i> need  <BR>to do that? <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll let it slide for once,
    but please remember next time that this  <BR>Board has helped you numerous times,
    and that everybody  <BR>here helps you on a voluntary basis. <i>No</i>body&#39;s
    getting paid  <BR>for all this, believe me. So please remain courteous.
