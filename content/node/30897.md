  is important to be updated with the latest printing techniques \r\nexplaining in
  simple language (english is not my mother tongue) \r\na wide variety of printing
  issues. \r\n\r\nFor the moment I am thinking for the \"PRODUCTION FOR THE GRAPHIC
  DESIGNER\" \r\nby Craig James. \r\n\r\nI am looking forward for any recommendations.
  \r\n\r\nThanks in advance"
