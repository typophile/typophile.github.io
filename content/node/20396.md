  body: "Waaaheeelll, we had this discussion over at the unfortunately closed Dafont-forum
    and then later at the WTF-Forum. Our conclusion was according to some users which
    confirmed that the designer stated it as the basis of global as read in a magazine
    called \"Photoshop Users\" (or so).\r\nGlobal is the now called font BULLET from
    House industries. The namechange came from a name-collision with a T-26-font.
    \r\n\r\nSo, if no one digs out a better conclusion I'd say as always: custom,
    based on Global/Bullet\r\n\r\nSee here: http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/viewthread.php?threadid=37393"
