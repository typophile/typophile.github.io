    source linked on the FontLab site.  The link is not that easy to find.  I will
    look for it tonight when I am at home. I will also post some book titles for you
    on font design later.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    On http://www.fontlab.com/studio/ , scroll down to the \"Buy\" section and there
    is a quite prominent link \"Buy printed manuals for our products from OnDemandManuals.com\".
