  body: "Rian Hughes has a similar style with [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/device/mastertext/light/|Mastertext]],
    and the Light version is most similar. Only the I is not formed the same way,
    but this could be re-drawn. It seems as if it was designed to imitate the old
    bitmap fonts Guiyong mentioned.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
