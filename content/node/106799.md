  infos about Bembo Std (picked up from the Adobe shop) which I'm using for a book.\r\nFirst
  of all in the Adobe page there's the following statement:\r\n\"Bembo Std family
  is designed to be used at a text size of 8.0 points\"\r\nSo, is it a problem if
  I set size to 11pt ?\r\n\r\nI also have a little problem with kerning (I'm using
  InDesign).\r\nI set \"Metric\" in the paragraph style (I read \"Optical\" is not
  the best choice for text ) but the result is not so good.\r\nEspecially for the
  \"V\". The kerning is automatically set to -175 with the result that there's almost
  no space between the \"V\" and previous character. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/kerning_4368.jpg]\r\nIf
  I set kerning to \"Optical\" everything looks better so I'm thinking to switch to
  that but I'm curious about this strange behaviour.\r\n\r\nAny guess?\r\nThanks in
  advance (and forgive my dodgy english!)"

    fonts could and often did have different designs for the different sizes. When
    fonts were first made available as photocomp, traditionally, an 8-point master
    (for footnotes) was made, a 12-point master (for text), and finally,  an 18-point
    (for display). \"Master\" equals the size of the design with the metal fonts.\r\n\r\nGenerally,
    these were \"somewhat\" successful. The people making up the photocomp fonts usually
    didn't have the skill, or maybe time, to get the thick-thin proportions of the
    metal fonts, when printed with the paper of the time, into the photocomp environment.
    As a result, one size was often more successful than the others, and occasionally,
    the 8-point \"master\" became the preferred version. It could be more than just
    the technical success of the rendering, of course, Magazines were coming along,
    and the design of a \"footnote\" font more closely matched the perceived needs
    of magazines than text fonts.\r\n\r\nFor all these reasons, the 8-point master
    became the preferred one for Bembo in photocomp, and the only one originally offered
    in PostScript (for Bembo \"Standard\"). You don't think they redid anything, do
    you? Not for PostScript, and not for OpenType. \r\n\r\nHowever, it is still terrible.
    If you want to use Bembo for text, you should be using the newer Bembo Book. Why
    do they still sell the Standard? Well, a fool and his money are soon parted; if
    you'll buy it, better they get your money than someone else, eh? And the \"Standard\"
    is still marginally useful for display settings, even though it is an 8-point
    design.\r\n\r\nNice font in metal. Rushed to market in Photocomp (and PostScript).
    Happened to a lot of the fonts popular in the metal era. Your money, your choice.\r\n\r\nAs
    to the kerning. Yes. A part of setting type. That's what typesetters are for.
    You need to learn how to do that. We're still not to the point where you can simply
    dump a text into a machine and wonderful stuff pops out. Probably never will be,
    unless we standardizes everything -- type size, measure, margins, on & on. Most
    of what a typesetter does is to try & pick the best compromise. \r\n\r\nKerning
    isn't a compromise? It falls between letter pairs, with no eye to the letters
    on the other side of that pair. Example: Kern WAVE by hand. For drama, use a setting
    size of 18 points. Now use the same value for WA that you used in WAVE, but set
    WARE. In 14-point. As Alan Greenspan was heard to say, \"oops!\" \r\n"

    Didn't know the story (I should have pointed out that designing books is not my
    cup of tea so I realize I made some noob questions).\r\nI will experiment with
    similar fonts and I'll maybe switch to Bembo Book if it's affordable.\r\nThanks
    also to Nick for pointing out this detail, I was in fact quite puzzled seeing
    that kerning value with no reason, so to say.\r\n\r\nI still have a lot to learn

  body: "<cite>I still have a lot to learn here.</cite>\r\n\r\nMe too, and I've been
    at it over 30 years.\r\n\r\nWhile not an answer based on exhaustive searching
    (I don't know, for example, what ShinnType offers in a Venetian revivalist mode),
    take a look at Espinosa Nova.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/estudio-ch/espinosa-nova/\r\n\r\nIt
    appears the roman is still free and the italic $50; you can go a long way with
    them. To go beyond is essentially the full $400 package, perhaps a bit pricy for
    a beginner, but we in fact have the entire offering, so I'm familiar with it.
    Both my company and my wife's have set several books with the fonts; they worked
    well.\r\n\r\nYes, it is a modernization of the work of a Spanish priest in the
    New World. Call it an oldface if you want, but to my eye, the influences are more
    Venetian than French.\r\n\r\nAnd Christ\xF3bal Henestrosa took the pains to test
    the fonts with high-resolution offset printing as well as laser printing before
    publishing them, an important but usually overlooked step.\r\n\r\nThe thing that
    attracted me in the first place was the EULA -- Christ\xF3bal allows the end user
    to modify the fonts, without prior permission, though he does ask to be notified
    if/when modification work is done. \r\n\r\nNot to say they are bad as published.
    The x-height is a little taller than with Bembo, but that is in keeping with a
    2013 fashion. I think they still need a little more weight, but unlike with Bembo,
    that is at least arguable. A couple of the characters need work, to my eye, perhaps
    not to yours.\r\n\r\nAll in all, if Bembo (Standard) is an appropriate choice
    for your book, Espinosa Nova will be better. Whether it is better than Bembo Book,
    I can't really say. At $50 for the roman and italic, it is certainly cheaper.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "@ Michael:\r\n\r\nHmm. Garamonds seem popular. We get in a number of books
    specified in Adobe Garamond Premier -- you know, the \"historical\" version of
    Adobe Garamond.\r\n\r\nI've always found French typefaces like French cars. \"Interesting,
    very Interesting,\" spoken in your best Arte Johnson voice. Take the Citro\xEBn.
    Now maybe if I were being chauffeured around, I'd think it delightful. But not
    as a driver. I'd prefer an Italian car. And I prefer Italian type, too, when I'm
    driving...\r\n\r\nIf Bembo is just too tutu, There is always John Downer's Iowan
    Old Style. Great big honking x-height, and with a little work, wonderful character
    fit. A little light for text, but they all are, to my eye, so maybe I'm wrong.
    Intermediate on the x-height is Espinosa Nova.\r\n\r\nHaving said all that do
    you care to show it? (& allowing that \"Garalde\" can have a lot of different
    visual interpretations - are you using the term to mean \"between humanist & modern\"?)
    \ If you can post a link where I can see it, I'd like to take a look. Esp. if
    it's flavor is more Manutius than Garamond.\r\n\r\nIf you were too true to letterpress
    & wetted paper, it will likely be of no use to us modern folk -- e.g., offset
    printing on Glatfelter 55 uncoated papers. But if you've reinterpreted it a certain
    way, it might be interesting, esp to those in scholarly publishing who don't favor
    the currently fashionable \"chunky\" letterforms.\r\n\r\nCharles"

    and don't sweat it. Your font simply has a kerning table that is optimized for
    a given point size (or, if you aren't charitable, it has a bad kerning table),
    and InDesign's algorithm does a better job. If the result looks good, it <em>is
    </em>good. If you want to, you can tweak the kerning yourself, but that takes
    a lot of work and your font license might not permit doing so."
