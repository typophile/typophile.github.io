body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know what I have done wrong when the preview of the
  font doesnt show up in Word font menues?\r\n\r\nThe name is there and everything
  works fine with the font, but in the font menu the name of the font is written with
  Arial (or something else).\r\nIt is an OpenType PS font that is generated exactly
  the same as other fonts that Do have previews. The origin has been a Postscript
  font that I no have convertet into OpenType PS-format.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n/ G"

  body: "Word must think it's a symbol font. To prevent illegible font names for symbol
    fonts, it uses Arial (or something else) -- check \"Symbol\", \"WingDings\" etc.,
    these should display the same.\r\n\r\nIf all you did was convert the font, its
    encoding probably <em>was</em> SymbolEncoding or some custom job. Consult your
    convert tools to change it."

  body: "Well, the font has a lot of ornaments that is activated via the ornm feature
    to substitute the letters A-Z, I wonder if that could be the issue here?\r\n\r\nThe
    encoding is however not symbol, it is the same as others that I converted."
