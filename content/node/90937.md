body: I've read a lot of complains every time a new character design emerges. I can
  stand those, but I don't get why a recurring argument against those is calling them
  "artificial characters". Is there such thing like a <em>natural</em> character?
  All characters we use are conventions that have to be taught and get used with;
  they were created by humans, evolved with the time and definitely aren't stored
  in the unconscious mind. It is true that people generally grow being a 'native'
  speaker of some alphabet, yet even with that logic new characters I don't think
  that the "artificial" word is property used.

    That is why you can look at a word and know what it says without consciously \"reading\"
    it, as much as you try only to look and not to read.\r\n\r\nThe difference between
    \"natural\" and \"artificial\" has to do exactly with that \"evolved with time\"
    bit. Still, I don't think this is particularly common or standard terminology."

    characters\"</em>\r\n\r\nCan you provide an example? Who is calling new characters
    'artificial'?\r\n\r\nI suppose such a term might be used in the sense of inorganic,
    as a parallel to how the word artificial is used relative to things like sweeteners.
    For the most part, the signs that we read every day are the product of a long
    'organic' process. They have been filtered through the triple screens of writing,
    reading and culture, and this accounts for both their conventional forms and for
    the stylistic variety of those forms.\r\n\r\nI don't think it is the case that
    all new signs are inorganic; that is, I believe new signs can be devised, thoughtfully,
    to fit within the organically evolved systems of writing and reading and cultural
    expression. Or it can turn out that way mostly by chance, which I think was the
    case with the euro symbol: the speed with which type designers found ways to convincingly
    represent that new sign in virtually any style of type is evidence of its organic
    compatibility with existing typographic conventions and styles. On the other hand,
    I think the new Turkish lira sign has a problem that will be much more difficult
    to resolve in a way that fits organically with other letters, numerals and symbols."

    an awkward status.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s related to the difficulty most people have
    in learning more than one language fluently, if the multiple languages are not
    all learned concurrently as a young child.\r\n\r\nSo to make a character \u201Cnatural\u2019,
    it has to be part of the alphabet taught to (and learned by) children when they
    first read, when the most profound impressions and connections are made.\r\n\r\nIn
    Britain during the 1960s, an experiment was carried out which compared 873 children
    taught with the traditional alphabet against 873 taught with Pitman\u2019s ITA
    (initial teaching alphabet).\r\n\r\nThe results showed that children in the ITA
    group learned faster and wrote better, but ultimately the least able of them had
    severe difficulties in adapting to real-world complexities and irrationalities,
    which children in the traditional group had been dealing with since day one.\r\n\r\nAn
    awesome piece of social engineering, unfortunately to the detriment of some of
    the guinea-pigs.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.spellingsociety.org/journals/j29/itaexpt.php\r\n\r\nOn
    a smaller scale, the last characters to be added to the Western European alphabet
    were two of many improvements proposed by G.G. Trissino in 1529\u2014 the addition
    of V to disambiguate certain usages of U, and of j for like reason with i. These
    caught on slowly at first in Italy, and then elsewhere, but eventually came to
    be the norm.\r\n\r\n A more gradual, organic form of cultural evolution.\r\n\r\n(However,
    I don\u2019t know to what extent Trissino\u2019s reforms were actively promoted
    and/or enforced by various authorities of the day, or how much they spread infectiously
    throughout the medium of culture.)"

  body: "I would think that while it certainly is true, for example, that the letters
    of the Latin alphabet came into being by the hand of Man, and thus they are artificial,
    one can still draw a distinction between symbols which gradually developed over
    time, arising spontaneously from the activities of many people - and characters
    which can be traced to the action of a single individual.\r\n\r\nThis is true
    whether we are speaking of the \"interrobang\" punctuation mark, the new currency
    symbols for the Indian Rupee or the Turkish Lira, or the astrological glyps for
    the Uranian planets of the Hamburg School.\r\n\r\n\"Artificial\" may be the wrong
    word for the distinction which is intended to be made, but it is perhaps the closest
    word we have, and as I think the distinction is real and significant, I can't
    criticize people for using the best word for it that is handy - because to do
    so would simply have the result of preventing the distinction from being expressed."
