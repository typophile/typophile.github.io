  or is it both?\r\n\r\nI have shown it to a few people and the consensus favored
  \"band\", but I thought I'd get you all to weigh in before I put it to use in my
  design.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?"

    in Ottawa!\r\n\r\nFor bilingual, French/English readers, the ampersand as rebus
    might cause problems."

  body: I think this sentence is hard to read because the transliteration of the ampersand
    changes halfway through. Of course "&" is Latin "et", but can also be read as
    English "and"; maybe not both at one time, though.

  body: You make a good point, it's all well and good both ways to an anglophone,
    but once it gets bilingual only "et" works out.

  body: "altaira, you said it better that I did... :-)\r\n\r\nAnother thing I wanted
    to mention is that <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/show?59N\">some ampersand
    symbols are more apt to be read as \"et\" than others</a> -- i.e., some are closer
    in form to the letters \"e\" and \"t,\"while others are a bit more abstract."

    our local garbage disposer has rebranded itself as\r\nTw&te Milieu.\r\n& is en
    in Dutch, ergo: Twente, which is the name of the region I live in. Very complicated
    and an insult to strangers. But that is the way it is.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\nBert Vanderveen

  body: I think you might only be able to get away with it if you're Alfred Bester
    and you surround yourself with people named stuff like Br&on M@eson. Speaking
    of which, has anyone done a typographical study of him? He did a lot of odd typographical
    things as part of his writing style. The guy wrote a whole scene in musical notation.

    not know about his typographic playfulness. I just found <a href=\"http://jamesmpalmer.tripod.com/nonfiction/needles/bester.htm\">an
    essay that briefly mentions it</a>. And <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/review/R53THHUYLK9P5/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm\">an
    Amazon reviewer mentions that he worked \"in the Comix and Advertising industries\"</a>.\r\n\r\n[Veering
    off-topic:] <em>The Demolished Man</em> seems to be a precedent for \"The Minority
    Report\"! Thanks again for mention Bester. I also remember \"Where No Man Has
    Gone Before,\" one of the great early episodes of the original Star Trek, mentioning
    Espers (telepaths)."
