body: "Im making some works for my application for studying design. One of the works
  that im doing for it is designing a displayfont. The idea which I have is too combine
  some different styles together. The forms are based a bit on russian constructivism,
  1920 bauhaus and din. Also my idea was only to use uppercase letters, uppercase
  ligatures and enclaves and some alternates like the trajan.\r\n\r\nFirst I constructed
  the letters clearly but later i decided to give the letters a bit more character
  and gave them a dirty outline, try to let them look like worse printed overfilled
  letters.\r\n\r\nAt the moment I just finished the normal alphabet and numerals.
  Before I continue my work I would like to know what you think about the idea and
  if my letters are correct!?\r\n\r\nThanx: Steven"

    only a sharp point would make an overshoot like that necessary."

  body: oh yes you are right! Haven't seen it before. Thanx, but then the V and W
    are too tall too. They have the same size like the A.

    on the right-hand side. don't know about the 9 falling over.\r\n\r\nthe overall
    impression is very nice, however, and i think i definitely has an impact of its
    own. nice work!\r\n\r\nthomas"

    with long ascenders, and very short (or like Hobo, no) descenders.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    where did you get the term \"enclaves\"?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Thanx for the idea with the lowercase. Sounds really good. Maybe I will add
    the lowercase letters later.  But at the moment I just have 2 more months to finish
    my work which I want to use as references to become a graphic design student.
    I cant rest for a long time on this project because I have to finish 40 workings
    for it.\r\n\r\n\r\nRe: BTW: I found the term \"Enklaven\" on google image search
    while i was searching after \"Ligaturen\" \r\n\r\nhttp://www.phil.uni-passau.de/histhw/TutHiWi/epigraphik/epigraphik3.html\r\n\r\nI
    dont know if the term is correct!? How would you call these things!?"

  body: "Well, godspeed, as they say.\r\n\r\nEnclave: I don't think it can be incorrect,
    simply because\r\nI've never heard a [distinct] term for that! I might've once\r\nheard
    something based on \"nest\" (maybe in something con-\r\ncerning Mantinia or Sophia,
    dunno) but apparently it wasn't\r\nmemorable... And I actually like \"enclave\"
    a lot. I'd give it a\r\nStrong Buy recommendation.  :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
