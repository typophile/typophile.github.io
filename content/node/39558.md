  body: "Not exactly the same. The middle vertex on W in your sample is different
    from Geometric Slabserif 703 Extra Bold, as well as the weight. Possibly it's
    custom type but I doubt it. If you can live a few small differences, Geoslab 703
    Extra Bold with a stroke chucked around the outside.\r\n\r\nSorry, that's all
    I have time to come up with.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

  body: 'You''re correct, James. I did a misstake in the link description in my post.
    It should have said "...a straight Black version of Bitstreams <em>Stymie Italic</em>...",
    that''s got the right kind of a. The a in Geometric Slabserif 703 and Memphis
    is close but no match. because they both got the top serif on the stem. But if
    you straighten Stymie Italic up it''s actually kind of close to the first sample... '

    Try browsing their site, though\u2014or contact them if it is that crucial.\r\n\r\nhttp://fontbureau.com/\r\n\r\nAs
    a semi-related side note. I heard that there was a brief in one of the recent

    anywhere online. Anyone know which issue or where I could find that story?"
