  and advise about the typeface to use for correspondence and legal papers. I'm a
  lawyer at a small firm (my own), and the last 2 years a passionate typophile.\r\n\r\nAs
  for years, we're using Times New Roman. No wonder I would like to change that soon.\r\n\r\nI
  truely like the look and feel of the H&FJ fonts like Gotham and Mercury, but for
  long text it doesn't seem right somehow.\r\n\r\nI love Scala too, but untill now
  I must admit that Minion Pro has the best look on print. And Minion is again well
  used and hardly exiting....\r\n\r\nDoes any of you have good suggestions? Thanks!
  \r\n\r\n"

  body: "I like where Mr. Givens is going. In your case, this is fairly dry matter,
    and anything elegant or bookish wouldn't be appropriate. [[http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=century+old+style|Century
    Old Style]] is plenty invisible, generally attractive in an average sort of way,
    and for those reasons, readable. All that and classically handsome! (Average handsome.)
    Schoolbook is a little too childish for a law firm...it was designed for school
    books and made famous by Dr. Seuss. If you're looking to present a more casual
    image, you might want to look at Comic Sans.\r\n\r\nAnd back to seriously...this

  body: You can't go wrong with Minion. Neither flashy or dull, it was designed for
    modern printing techniques (unlike Times) and comes with several weights, has
    Old Style figures if you want to use them. Dante (Monotype) would be excellent
    too. Adobe has it packaged up nicely in OTF at a better price.

    also good. And Galliard. You can still find many legal texts in Century/School
    Book.\r\n\r\nAnd since legalese is not considered to be meant to be understood,
    by all means do not limit yourself to the legible -- try sans too."

    headings, if I were going to mix in a sans at all.
