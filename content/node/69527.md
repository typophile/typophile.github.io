body: Hello, is every typograpger or typodesigner graphic designer and every graphic
  designer typograpger or typodesigner? Are typography and graphic design same things?
  So I've seen many graphic designers having created the fonts and typodesigners or
  typographers having created the pictures...

    graphic design can refer to a number of artistic and professional disciplines
    which focus on visual communication and presentation. Various methods are used
    to create and combine symbols, images and/or words to create a visual representation
    of ideas and messages. <strong>A graphic designer may use typography,</strong>
    visual arts and page layout techniques to produce the final result. Graphic design
    often refers to both the process (designing) by which the communication is created
    and the products (designs) which are generated.</em>\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_design\r\n\r\nIf
    every graphic designer isn't typographer, why did Wikipedia tell it?"

    that when the topic is one of those rare ones where I really have some expertise,
    Wikipedia often comes up a bit short. Anybody else get this reaction? It is a
    valuable source for information at the survey level, but often not much beyond
    that."

    most out of it you have to read it with the unevenness in mind. It is a great

  body: "<cite>Which one are you referring to?</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>Type designer</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>Then
    the answer is certainly no.</cite>\r\n\r\nI think, it is just the other way around.
    The chance, that a type designer is a good graphic designer is a bit greater,
    because typography does not necessarily mean to use letters as elements of design.
    A type designer must have a closer look onto the single letters in enlargement
    and is confronted more with the forms of the letters, while a typgrapher of text-heavy
    books is confronted more with the harmony between spaces. While I can imagine,
    that the spaces also can be computed in future, I can hardly imagine a computer
    program, that is able to design a typeface.\r\n\r\nBut in the moment, in which
    a typographer is using letters as design elements, he already is graphic designer,
    because then the forms of the letters are more than symbols of sounds (single
    letters) or closely defined notions (predefined letter strings / words).\r\n\r\nBut
    you also wanted to know, if a graphic designer is necessarily also a typographer
    or typeface designer. My answer: No, because both, typography and typeface design
    require a deeper or at least a different comprehension of human perception. In
    a closer sense typography shall transport predefined ideas/notions (words or phrases)
    in the most effective way, while graphic design is playing more with the wide
    range of concrete forms of the notions."

  body: "Many (but not all) graphic designers are typographers. A graphic designer
    is necessarily a particularly good or well trained typographer, however. It's
    not all that unusual for a graphic designer to know lots about expressive typography,
    using type to create mood and feeling, but very little about typographic history
    or the \"rules\" of typography. I see material with just basic errors, such as
    \"dumb quotes\" (a.k.a. \"typewriter quotes\") produced by folks who are nominally
    graphic designers.\r\n\r\nSpeaking as a sometimes type designer, and somebody
    who is definitely a typographer, I can attest that not all typographers or type
    designers are necessarily graphic designers. I'm certainly not. I did a really
    mediocre poster for Hypatia Sans that my then-colleagues at Adobe very sensibly
    suggested wasn't worth posting on the Adobe type blog as a free download.  :(\r\n\r\nOn
    the other hand, I've recently been collaborating with a graphic designer at work
    on some logo designs, and it's been a great process, because she has brought her
    graphic design sensibility into the process, and I have an understanding of letterform
    construction and balance that she lacks. I think our first logo was very successful,
    and I look forward to continuing work on others.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Kevin, graphic design is a registered profession in the province of Ontario,
    which is unusual.\r\nTo become an R.G.D. you need a degree, some experience, and
    must pass a test.\r\nSo that kind of graphic designer has well-rounded abilities
    (although type design may not be part of it, not being included as a part of all
    degree courses).\r\n\r\nWhether with qualifications or not, graphic designers
    have a spectrum of abilities, and that applies to how they handle typography as
    well as things like colour, illustration, photography, motion graphics, interactivity,
    logos, environmental, &c.\r\n\r\nAdvertising art directors should be considered
    too, although they generally manage to fly under the radar, without even a Wiki
    entry for art direction. But what else could one expect of the stealthy bastards
    who orchestrate consumer culture?! \r\n\r\nSome people have a feel for display
    type, some for text work. Some of the best typographers I know are not graphic
    designers per se, but come from an editorial background: to them it's important
    how the text is read. By the same token, some of the worst typographers are graphic
    designer to whom text is nothing more than parallel grey bars in a page layout.\r\n\r\nAs
    a type designer, whether of the Heroic DTP era, or coming to it in the more formalized
    environment of recent years, you have to product test your prototypes in various
    typographic layouts as part of the development process. Get that feedback loop
    going. This requires a certain amount of typographic skill. And one is also obliged
    to present one's designs in specimens: for competitions, if one thinks they are
    worthwhile, as well as for presentation to potential publishers and customers.
    So again, typographic expertise is required. In fact, designing a specimen which
    puts a typeface through its paces is one of the most intricate and technically
    demanding genres of typography . To a typophile, nothing is more admirable than
    a good type specimen.\r\n\r\nSo it is far more likely that a type designer, especially
    one who designs and publishes their own original work, is a typographer as well,
    than a graphic designer may be a type designer. However, there are quite a few
    multi-person foundries where one principal concentrates on type design and production,
    and the other on the web site and marketing, or some other split of job function.\r\n\r\n"

    used to use my own faces occasionally when I was working as a graphic designer/art
    director, before I became a full-time type designer, but it was a compromising
    situation, because I could never be sure that I wasn't just using my typeface
    for a job because it was mine, and that some other face might not be better.\r\nNow
    that I self-publish, I produce my own specimens. So you could do that too. In
    fact, all you have to do is sell a font at MyFonts, and produce a PDF specimen
    for it. Voil\xE0. "

    you should behave as a father, but you don\u2019t loose the feature of being a
    husband or son, when you fill the role of a father.\r\n\r\nMaybe it is comparable
    with the question, whether a particle can be a wave at the same time. And the
    other way around. It is dependent from your focus, which can quickly change. Maybe
    that comparison is hobbling a bit more than the first one. And the next one may
    be already lame: If you ask, whether you can be conscious and unconscious at the
    same time, I would have said, that you cannot be conscious, if you are not unconscious,
    because you are not you without unconsciousness."

  body: "Typography is essentially the control of a single linear dimension (one-D)
    as the eye must travel linearly, and the mind parse sequentially to gain the logical
    meaning of typographically rendered language. Although the line folds back on
    itself to create columns of text, it's still not more than a fractional addition
    to the line.\r\nGraphic design deals primarily with the planar (2D) space, emotional
    and instantaneous impacts. (3D or exhibition, 4D or animation are extensions and
    developments of the first two)\r\n\r\nWell executed design, of course, has a full
    complement of both.\r\n\r\nRegarding type design, it is the atomic to typography's
