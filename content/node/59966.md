body: Am I correct in believing that CFF OpenType fonts can only contain Postscript
  hints? Or does the OpenType spec allow TrueType hints in a font with Postscript
  outlines?

  body: Your initial belief is correct. The TT and PS hints are closely linked to
    the outline formats, so there is no way to apply TT hints to a PS outline.

  body: "The instructions and glyphs are actually mixed into a single table, which
    is one of the first things the next format should address. If we ever get around
    to it, some will probably want to eliminate the instructions altogether, and others
    will want to eliminate the glyphs altogether. :-.\r\n\r\nCheers!"

    \r\n\r\nMy suggestion is directly related to the approach shown by David Berlow
    in <a href=\"http://www.rogerblack.com/blog/screen_fonts_history\">Screen Fonts:
    An Abbr. Hist.</a>, and to my own work on the Elementar bitmap font system (some
    images <a href=\"http://www.typotheque.com/news/elementar_preview\">here</a>)."

    composite font format standard, which is being developed. There is support from
    at least some participants for using this format for different size-specific fonts
    within a single composite font."
