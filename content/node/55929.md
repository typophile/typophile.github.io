    getting kerned in InDesign CS3. (The 'ck' dlig below is only available to German).\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dlig_kerning_5221.png]"

  body: "It's an OpenType PS font with OT kern feature, the c_t ligatures are in the
    classes and work in FontLab.\r\n\r\nAdobe Jenson Pro Regular doesnt work either.
    They seem to be working on the left side like your example above, but not on the
    right side of the ligature. Look here, for instance.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fontlab_6072.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/indesign_5139.png]\r\n\r\nAll
    my fonts have the same behaviour, they work on the left side, but not on the right."

  body: "Ok, it must a bug. Arno Pro and Meta doesnt either have the kerning on the
    c_t ligature. I have not opened them up in FontLab, but since the \"t\" have kerning
    against \"o\" I guess the developers of such great fonts must have put the \"c_t\"
    in the proper class.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/metaarno_6221.png]\r\n\r\nBugger!"

    glyphs affected?

  body: "Yes there's a bug, but the Discretionary Ligatures are getting kerned on
    the right side. Just look at this other example:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dlig_kerning2_5342.png]\r\n\r\nThe
    overlay clearly shows that there's the same amount of kerning between 'pV' and
    's_pV'.\r\n\r\nThe bug is that the kerning value is being incorrectly displayed
    as zero in the UI."

    than if it was not kerned at all.\r\n\r\nGood you sorted this out Miguel \u2013
    thanks :)"

  body: "Goran, \r\n\r\nfor a moment, I thought that the bug is about the horribly
    huge gap between \"a\" and \"c\" that shows in Meta, but I guess that one is not
    a bug, it's a feature :) "
