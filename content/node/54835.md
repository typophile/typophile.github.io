body: "I haven't thought to use this feature before. I don't know how well read it
  will be if at all. It seems as though a very different crowd uses the blogs compared
  to the forums. I have been effectively blogging my font design projects in Typophile's
  Critique forum. Here are links to the ones I can remember, in no particular order:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>[[http://typophile.com/node/51416|Effluent]]\r\n<li>[[http://typophile.com/node/28416|Palormak]]\r\n<li>[[http://typophile.com/node/41105|Agamemnon]]\r\n<li>[[http://typophile.com/node/28380|Cartmeign]]\r\n<li>[[http://typophile.com/node/34370|Rutaban]]\r\n<li>[[http://typophile.com/node/51081|CaliGrot]]\r\n<li>[[http://typophile.com/node/34899|Gohan]]\r\n<li>[[http://typophile.com/node/28175|Triangulor]]\r\n<li>[[http://typophile.com/node/39907|Gohan
