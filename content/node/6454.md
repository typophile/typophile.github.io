  I can&#39;t shake the feeling that it&#39;s very familiar. Thanks! <BR> <BR><img

    <BR> <BR>I looked but couldn&#39;t find it on any other sites with that same name,
    so I will assume that&#39;s the original font unless someone corrects me.'

  body: Great ID Brandee!! It&#39;s something I would have never guessed, and I guess
    it&#39;s not so familiar. Thanks a million. <BR> <BR>Does anyone know who own&#39;s
    the design to Dominator? I recognize some of those from the <a href="http://www.abstructure.com/old_index.html"
    target="_blank">Brainreactor</a> fontpack but Dominator is not there. Any ideas?  <BR>
