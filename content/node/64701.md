  but I'm still very far from good enough. Therefore, I'd really like you to take
  the time and look through my portfolio - http://geminianum.carbonmade.com/ - making
  a few comments, choosing best/worst from it, etc. It'll help me a lot. :)\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance, \r\nCheers!\r\n\r\nNeven"

    personality. And then use it. Your fonts are very plain.\r\n\r\n2. Work on you
    grids. Tighten the positive spaces and open up some of the negative spaces. And
    be more \"geometrical\".\r\n\r\n3. Think about content. Many of your designs are
    not bad, but nothing reaches out and grabs. There is a plain-ness to most of your
    work.\r\n\r\nThat said, I would guess thatyou could greatly improve your work
    by looking to other designers for inspiration.\r\n\r\nWho inspires you?"

  body: "Thanks!\r\nI can see the plain-ness you're talking about... I really am looking
    around for inspiration, everytime I have to design something.. But I guess it's
    just a matter of practice and experience, to get a good result. \r\n\r\nI like
    modernist work like Vignelli, but really prefer David Carson, Sagmeister and similar
    postmodern designers. \r\n"

  body: "There you go! Just figure out what it is about those guys that inspires you...
    and then straight-up imitate it. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. When you
    are starting out, your mantra should be \"Imitate, imitate, imitate!\"\r\n\r\nBut
    definitely spend some time hunting down personable fonts and compelling images.
    Without those, you got nothing."

    I'd like to know, which of the work in my portfolio do you find the worst, and
    is there anything good enough to stay?"

  body: "The magazine layout stuff is probably the most professional-looking.\r\n\r\nThe
    \"Dani Sira 2009\" is a nice layout, if a bit unpolished with the large font being
    totally inappropriate.\r\n\r\nThe Benbello identity is not terrible and you could
    probably keep that in to fill out the future portfolio.\r\n\r\nAs for the stand-alone
    artwork, I would leave that out.\r\n"

  body: "Thanks! I agree with \"Dani sira\" being bad typographically. :)\r\nDo you
    find the \"clarke2006\" poster all bad, or is it just the typography?\r\nI love
    typography and admire new typefaces, but I'm a student and it's impossible for
    me to buy them just yet..."

  body: The main problem with the Clarke 2006 is that it does not have a strong layout.
    Sometimes artwork can actually get in the way of good design. And I can't say
    I'm into the illustration either. But that's just me.

    better, so if you can find the time to look at the designs on [[http://geminianum.posterous.com]]
    and comment on the pieces, I'd be really grateful. I'm near the end of my collage
    so I have to decide what to keep in my portfolio and what to throw out... ;)\r\n\r\nNeven"

  body: "Definitely some big improvements in style. \r\n\r\nI would explore ways of
    creating a bit more tension with some energetic grids. Right now, things seem
    to be floating a bit too loosely in most of your compositions. Sometimes that
    is appropriate. But whenever you've got type, it's usually good to be tight with
    it and establish clear hierarchies and spatial relationships. Or at least suggest
    a reasoning behind why things are placed where they are."
