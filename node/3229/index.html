  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello! <BR> <BR>I'm an undergrad design student about to enter my final year of university, and I was wondering if I could get a few suggestions on a serif and sans-serif combination that could be applied consistently to the written work I'll produce this year. I've been using FF Scala and Scala Sans for the past few years to set my formal texts, and while they have served me well, I'm looking for something different. <BR> <BR>Some basic criteria: <BR>* Work well in shortish texts (&lt;1000 words) and longer texts (~3000 words up to a 10,000 word thesis). <BR>* Combine well together, but also able to stand on their own. On occasion, I might want to set a short document entirely in the sans-serif face. <BR>* Versatile enough to be used in a standard-sized document, the occasional large-format poster, and the very-occasional slideware presentation. <BR>* Combine well with the images I'll be using this year: namely, interface mockups and screen grabs, various diagrams, and maps and photos of urban environments. <BR> <BR>As way of additional reference, the project I'm working on this year is technology-based, utilizing a mobile computing device hooked up to a GPS unit and connected to the internet. The written material will draw quite heavily on such areas as: urban and spatial practices, architecture, the city in art, design and literature, new media theory, anthropology/sociology, Deleuzian philosophy, interaction design/human-computer interaction, information visualization, mapping/cartography. <BR> <BR>Any help very much appreciated!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">You might consider Sabon for the sans serif. It doesn't require ligatures,  <BR>won't give your readers eyestrain at low resolution, and would probably  <BR>look okay with the Scala Sans you have been using. It will seem vaguely  <BR>French to the Deleuze crowd. I don't think your fonts should show off &ndash;  <BR>you want something that won't get in the way of the content of your writing.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'm a fan of Eric Gill, so I've been wanting to see Gill Sans and Joanna paired together, but I always feel that both of these faces are a little more on the display side and am not sure about how legible either would be for long blocks of text. Anyone wanna weigh in on this suggestion? i'd like to hear yer thoughts on whether this'd work (i hope this doesn't derail your thread, Ben!) <BR>P.S. I just checked out Scala&amp;Scala Sans (I wasn't familiar with the faces befor I posted, sorry) and it seems to me that Scala&amp;Scala Sans have a lot in common with Joanna and Gill Sans (but i could be wrong) so if you're looking for something of a different look, I guess my suggestion wouldn't work that well.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks Nicolai! Fedra Serif A and Fedra Sans (leaning slightly to Alt) look near perfect for my needs: versatile, fresh and contemporary, yet unobtrusive and readable. A bit pricey for my student budget, but I think I'll manage. Tops my shortlist, for the moment at least. <BR> <BR>// <BR> <BR>Thanks t christensen! I was considering Sabon, I'm just a little unsure if it fits the character of my thesis completely. <BR> <BR>// <BR> <BR>Paul: <BR>I like Eric Gill too! I'll have to rule Gill Sans out though – it's bundled with OS X and its ubiquity is steadily increasing. I personally don't like Gill Sans used in anything longer than a short single page document. And I couldn't use it without thinking of Edward Tufte (<a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/">http://www.edwardtufte.com/</a></a>) or the London Underground. :-) <BR> <BR>// <BR> <BR>On a related note, I was browsing though a few related theses, and these are the typefaces used in a few of them (at least, the theses which bothered to pay attention to type): <BR> <BR>Scala Sans <BR>Interstate <BR>Akzidenz Grotesk <BR>Meta <BR>Frutiger <BR> <BR>TheMix <BR>Rotis SemiSans (used in body text, urgh&hellip; difficult to read!) <BR> <BR>Scala <BR>Sabon <BR>Plantin <BR>Vendetta <BR>Melior</div>

<p>No. They just don&rsquo;t want their fonts distributed via embedding, which is mainly MS Word and PDFs. Documents and images created in inDesign, Photoshop, etc. don&rsquo;t embed fonts, so they&rsquo;re not an issue.</p>
<p>MS Word is very problematic, because a document with an embedded font can be distributed to a corporate network, thereby installing the font on all terminals of that system, which may not be licensed for the font.</p>
<p>It would be like if you download an image file made by Photoshop, and bingo, the Photoshop application is installed on your computer!</p>

<p>Did you miss the EPS bit? Since a font cannot be embedded in an EPS, it implies you can&rsquo;t even do a convert-to-outlines! The Emigre EULA has that problem too (in fact it&rsquo;s much more explicit about it). This is of course ludicrous, to the point of fascism.</p>
<p>Claire, talk to Peter about it.
I can assure you he&rsquo;s much much nicer than his EULA.</p>
<p>Unfortunately a EULA is a necessary evil.
But sometimes it can make a person evil.</p>
