  what would be best, to list the foundry or the designer(s)? There's not enough room
  to list both so I was thinking it might be best to link the foundry so others can
  find the webfonts if they choose to use them.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n<img scr=\"http://f.cl.ly/items/453a1U123Z0Y3V34291A/Image%202013-04-09%20at%206.41.25%20AM.png\"

  body: "Strictly an amateur speaking here, but either way loses something. If you
    show only the font name and designer, it's possible that the user will locate
    and purchase a different version of the font than you're using.\r\n\r\nOn the
    other hand, the original designer is, to me, more important than the foundry.
    And what IS the foundry? It's often difficult, if not impossible, to separate
    resellers from font makers. \r\n\r\nSo i guess it comes down to the way you show
    it - the designer name (if known).\r\n\r\n - Herb"

  body: "Good point, HVB. I think what I can do here is link to the distributor under
    the name of the typeface (Old Standard in this case would link to its Typekit
    page). And under each designer I could link to their personal site or maybe even
    the people pages that Font Bureau set up: <a href=\"http://www.fontbureau.com/people/TobiasFrereJones\"
    target=\"_blank\">http://www.fontbureau.com/people/TobiasFrereJones</a>\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso,
    I meant distributor on my initial post, not foundry. Sorry for the confusion."

  body: "Pablo, \r\n\r\nTrue. And as far as I know, Typekit will occasionally make
    adjustments to the fonts in their library if need be. Even though I highly doubt
    they will be the one to do this, I'm still hoping Old Standard will one day be
    improved (kerning is awful). Google doesn't make any improvements or am I incorrect
    on that? That's one particular reason why I use Typekit."

    show in the attached image), but for some weird reason it's not working on some

    the original designer is contacted/commissioned first. If he is not able to make
    it, other designers will be contacted/commissioned as second option.\r\n\r\nIn
    my own fonts, as a small example:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Alexi (Cyreal.org) was commissioned
    to add Cyrillic to Lobster.</li>\r\n<li>Irina Kheyso was commissioned to add hand-hinting
    to Cabin.</li>\r\n<li>I was commissioned to expand Matt McInerney's Raleway-Thin
    into a 9 weights family.</li>\r\n<li>I'm also commissioned to expand my own fonts,

    Spacing/Kerning all of them.</li>\r\n</ul>"

    only (keeping side-bearings untouched) you can try DTL Kernmaster.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Also,
    a designer of a Google font isn't forced to use iKern, is he?</blockquote>\r\nNo,
    no one is forced to use it. But is available if the designer want to use it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    good initial sidebearings do make a difference in the end-result... If that's
    true then iKern is <em>adjusting</em> them instead of dumping them.\r\n\r\nSo
    iKern is available for free to any Google font designer? That's nice of them.
    I guess they realized that most people mess up the spacing... :-)  I wonder if
    Marini is giving a discounted price per font to Google, or is charging a (yearly?)
    all-you-can-eat fee.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    of the Google web fonts come with a very permissive licence. If you have special
    requirements, you could hire any type designer/font engineer to modify the fonts
    for you. You can also host them yourself, no need to use the Google hosting."
