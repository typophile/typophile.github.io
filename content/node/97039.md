  for proper letter designs, both a sans and a serif. According to Middendorp,\r\n<blockquote>The
  official digital version of the NEN 3225 alphabets has been made available at the
  type production Visualogik in 's-Hertogenbosch</blockquote>\r\n(\"Dutch Type\",
  p. 299).\r\n\r\nAre these fonts somewhere available?"

    collegeau of mine owns the original 1962 guide, and in it the characters are printed
    on millimeter paper, so re-creating them should be quite easy. I'm wondering if
    anyone has \"been there, done that\" (possibly followed by \"thrashed it\")."
