body: "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nI am currently in love with the font [[http://www.typotheque.com/fonts/greta_text|Greta
  Text]] and would love to use this font for a student magazine. However, everyone
  else on the team feels it's a bit too serious looking. I disagree, but what can
  I say. I am basically looking for a serif font that is between Greta Text and [[http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/families/ff_tisa/|FF
  Tisa]] which was deemed <em>too</em> \"friendly\". \r\n\r\nIt's body copy this would
  be for. Since everyone has suddenly become a typography expert on the team \u2014
  I think I'll need a couple of suggestions to woo them. I'm basically looking for
  something between the two \u2014 contemporary enough, not too serious, but not as
  friendly (I don't know where they came up with this!) as FF Tisa. \r\n\r\nAlso,
  each page of the magazine is 210 x 297 mm \u2014 if people would have any idea what
  size in points the body copy should be, along with any line-spacing suggestions,
  that would be extremely helpful. The magazine is currently at 9.3 pts (I think)
  Freight Sans, but that's too large in my opinion. I come from a background in web
  design, so I'm not really experienced enough and don't want to mess it up.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your help.\r\n\r\nEdmund."

    might be an interesting choice. Tisa, Greta, Freight, they are all great. Thinking
    of Greta, maybe [[http://www.type-together.com/Sirba|Sirba]] is a choice for you?'

  body: I second Fedra Serif. It manages to look strikingly fresh and contemporary
    while still having the neutrality that a text font needs...

  body: "Funny isn't it \u2014\_that you have to be reminded of the wonderful fonts
    which you have spent hundreds on. I bought Fedra Serif a while back, and I actually
    really like it for this purpose. I also love Sirba and PF Centro Serif Pro, but
    I can't justify the expense given that I already have Fedra.\r\n\r\nThank you
    all for your wonderful suggestions.\r\n\r\nI'm just messing around with the InDesign
    file at current \u2014 and having compared to magazines such as NewScientist,
    Time and Newsweek, it all seems that they are set at 7.5 pt. But this seems frighteningly
    small, even though this figure has been thrown around on the web too after a Google
    search. Does this sound OK? And I have the leading at 11 pt \u2014 this seems
    right, too. Any suggestions would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n"

    officially decided on Fedra Serif, everyone else likes it too. Do you think this
    goes OK alongside shorter articles in Freight Sans? \r\n\r\nThanks."
