body: So I&#39;m sitting here working with Meta. I noticed it seems like there are
  no kerning pairs for Meta LF, wich is lining figures. if I select a chunk of text,
  there are not one kerning pair. If I change to meta &#40;not Lf&#41; it has them.
  Are they think that we are suppose to use LF only on the selected numerals? I&#39;m
  curious. <BR> <BR>I believe its Meta 2, as well.

    common in days of Fontographer: when you open a font with it, kerns need to be
    imported after, so the developer perhaps missed an operation? <BR>'

  body: When I said that Fontographer didn&#39;t make very good fonts, I meant that
    there were certain technical problems and limitations with fonts built by Fontographer.
    <BR> <BR>For example, Fontographer&#39;s auto-hinting is quite poor. IIRC, Fontographer
    doesn&#39;t do hint replacement, or doesn&#39;t do it well. The Windows version
    forces PostScript FontNames to match Windows menu names in inappopriate ways.
    It becomes particularly limiting if one wants to make fonts with more than 256
    glyphs and use Unicode &#40;it does have some support here, but it&#39;s not very
    well done&#41;. Fontographer&#39;s irritating habit of doing decimal precision
    in point locations makes it hard to maintain consistent stroke weights, and contributes
    to design problems. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m sure there are other issues, but it&#39;s
    been many years since I used the tool, so I am probably forgetting some. <BR>
    <BR>But all that is just to say that fonts built with Fontographer tend to be
    less than perfect technically, and suffer various technical limitations. One can
    build fonts in Fontographer that are technically good enough, particularly if
    one knows what Fontographer will do automatically wrong. And none of that stops
    people from making fonts that are artistically great. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T

  body: Hey Kyle. Not sure what&#39;s up with your files. All my FF Metas  <BR>have
    kerning, LF styles, too. It&#39;s my understanding that FF have  <BR>been working
    with FontLab for a while now, so the Fontographer  <BR>limitation doesn&#39;t
    apply here. <BR> <BR>I would <a href="mailto:inka@fontfont.de">email the fonts
    to FontFont</a> and they&#39;ll replace if need be. <BR>Tell &#39;em I sent you.
