  I know that with css it's more regimented h1, h2, h3 etc but have run into problems
  in print, receiving large documents with very unclear hierarchies of information.\r\n\r\nThoughts? "

    aswell \u2013, now and later on. \r\nName your styles by function, not by their
    appearance. If you name a style \u2018Bembo all-caps green\u2019, and then change
    the headlines to small-caps of a different font in a different color, the name
    will stop making sense. Better use abstract names that refer to the function or
    structure of the element within the document, e.g. \u2018Headline\u2019.\r\nWhatever
    system you use, make sure it is logical and consistent.\r\nAnd avoid special characters.
    I once ran into a problem with style names that contained colons.\r\nF"

  body: "Largely as Florian says, but think about a self-imposed hierarchy. This hierarchy
    should make sense to you and to anyone else who may have to work with your files.
    & if you do lots of similar work, it could then be the basis for further style
    sheet naming.\r\n\r\nI do only books, for instance. So my style sheets tend to
    look like this (the matter in brackets is not part of the style sheet name, but
    only to explain it here):\r\n\r\n1 CN [chapter number\r\n2 CT [chapter title]\r\n3
    epi [epigraph]\r\n4 epi att [epigraph attribution]\r\n\r\n5 tx 1 [since most often
    the 1st text \xB6 is different than subsequent ones]\r\n6 tx [text]\r\n7 tx noi
    [text with no indent]\r\n\r\nThen I jump to the extract style sheets:\r\nex 1
    [1st \xB6 of multi-\xB6 extract]\r\nex 2 [2nd \xB6 and subsequent until ex3]\r\nex
    3 [final \xB6]\r\nex 4 is for a single-\xB6 extract\r\n\r\nAnd so forth until
    the whole darn thing is styled: footnotes, end notes, shoulder notes, bibliography,
    appendices, tables, index, blah blah blah.\r\n\r\nThe addition of \"a\" or \"b\"
    or \"x\" after a style sheet name allows for variants.\r\n\r\nI've been doing
    it this way for years. It makes it real easy to start a new book design; names
    is one thing I need not think about. Composition shops I work with know this system
    by now. When they find an instance I've overlooked, they add style sheets and
    follow my name system.\r\n\r\nAs far as those \"unclear hierarchies of information,\"
    remember: it is part of the designer's job to sort out the hierarchies and impose
    clarity (with the editor's help).\r\n\r\nhave fun.\r\n\r\npowers"

  body: "Hrm\u2026 I always set my stylesheets exactly based on type specification,
    starting with point size. That automatically orders my stylesheets from top to
    bottom based on size, and thus hierarchy. (Which is interesting, because as a
    web standards nazi, I would never do that in any of my web designs...)\r\n\r\n13/15
    Jenson\r\n13/15 Jenson drop cap\r\n14/15 Jenson SMALLCAPS\r\n26/30 Jenson Heading\r\n\r\nI
    do that knowing how a particular setting is used. The function of the text is
    implied by the very setting of the text."
