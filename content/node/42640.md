  H&J settings, but I messed around with the ones I know about, and nothing seems

    you HAVE to turn on hyphenation \u2013 and use it \u2013 if you are ever going
    to achieve a harmonious page colour and line rhythm.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/justification_4948.png]\r\n\r\nThe
    word spacing is pretty self explanatory. In the letter spacing section you should
    only allow a very small value to be added, and the same goes for glyph scaling,
    as that really can get ugly. Look carefully, adjust with the preview on, print
    and re-adjust until it's perfect... The rest of the fitting is then good old hand
    work. Be aware that if you are using the paragraph composer as opposed to the
    single line composer, you can get in trouble with preceding lines when you make
    changes by hand."

  body: Glyph scaling should be invisible, and it can help nudge a line in place,
    so use with care. And again, there are no rules, it just have to look right...
    By the way I would also add hanging punctuation to the layout.

  body: Check your hidden characters, you might have a hard or soft return that's
    keeping things bunched up. I've had that happen occasionally. Also, the way you
    set your hyphenation might dictate whether a word is split or not, changing the
    amount of characters before and after a hyphenation will change when a word might
    hyphenate or not.

    agree. With a lot of typefaces, I tend to decrease the default word space, to
    something like 90\u201395%. Depends on the typeface (and size, leading, line-length
    &c), of course.\r\nBut the more important part is: word spacing, be it tighter

  body: "First of all, I don't agree that those lines are too tight. They are not
    ideal, but that's a different issue.\r\n\r\nThe points above on adjusting the
    space settings are correct -- I've gone into fonts an changed the wordspace value,
    and it has the same effect as changing the min-ideal-max settings. So, you are
    left with finding the values you want, and accepting all the compromises.\r\n\r\nThings
    to think about-- You can get the effect of looser wordspacing with the same values
    by decreasing the leading. Space is as much relational as absolute. One of the
    reasons designers went to greater leading was to get the appearance of tighter
    wordspacing.\r\n\r\nA second option is to slightly increase the space values,
    and increase the measure. I use different minimum values depending on the measure.
    If we're setting short measures -- say 18 picas in a double-column text, I'll
    go way down on the minimum. If it is a longer measure, raise it. Why? Because
    it is all a compromise. The best way to get text to fit as you want it is to rewrite
    the text. Usually not an option. But wordpace values, hyphenation, line length,
    etc. are all compromises you have to make.\r\n\r\nFor example, consider the compromises
    Dowding was willing to make in <cite>Finer points</cite>, in the Wace edition
    which showed what he really wanted. There are a few lines where there are no word
    spaces at all, only hair spaces -- his preference in compromise in order to avoid
    a \"loose\" line. There are places too, where the natural space between a parenleft
    and the following letter are greater than the wordspace [eg. \"(a\"] he uses in
    the line. Again, a compromise he wanted to make. And I think he was wrong -- not
    so much in his words per se., as in the compromises he showed he was willing to
    make.\r\n\r\nLong, long ago, I tried a test. I set a journal article two ways,
    once with tighter wordspace values, once with looser spacing. Not much, jut a
    touch. Sent the samples to the publisher. All (yes, all) the designers preferred
    the tighter setting. All (yes, all) the editors preferred the looser setting.\r\n\r\nAs
    a compositor, you have to get a sense of these things, and consider your several
    obligations -- e.g., who hired you (usually a designer) versus who's reading the
    text.\r\n\r\nFWIW"

  body: "Like Charles, I don't feel that the circled line is necessarily too tight.
    I think the effect is exacerbated by the lines directly above and below it, and
    by the fifth line, which is looser than I like.\r\n\r\nIf you feel that the native
    value of the word space in Freight is too narrow and is contributing to lines
    that are too tight, then just messing with the Minimum value won't necessarily
    yield the results I think you're looking for, because I think the Min/Max values
    only really affect the outer limits.\r\n\r\nI recommend this approach: \r\n\r\nFirst,
    set some sample paragraphs unjustified, flush left/rag right. See how the word
    spaces feel in this setting. If they are indeed too tight, then adjust the value
    for Desired word spacing in the Justification dialog until it is more comfortable
    for you.\r\n\r\nThen adapt your Minimum and Maximum based around this Desired
    value. Switch to justified setting and fine-tune the Min/Max to taste.\r\n\r\nYou
    might also consider adjusting the slider at the bottom of the Hyphenation settings
    to allow more hyphens for better spacing. It's hard to tell from just one sample,
    but it looks to me like allowing a little bit more hyphenation might even things
    out a bit more.\r\n\r\n-- Kent."

  body: "Yeah, I printed out the first sample ragged & it didn't bother me, even though
    the spaces were just as tight.  I think it was only when I tried it justified
    & you had tight line spacing next to loose line spacing that it started to bug
    me.  Now that I look at the ragged version closer, it is pretty tight there too.
    \ It may be exasperated, because in this type of book, I like to do loose leading.
    \ I think the loose leading may be contributing to the word spacing looking too
    tight.  If I used it in a magazine setting with tighter leading, I'd bet it would
    feel better.\r\n\r\nAnyways, adjusting the desired word spacing up, seems to help,
    so thanks for that suggestion.  I have never got into this detail with typography
    before, so it's great to have all this great input.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "<cite>because in this type of book, I like to do loose leading.</cite>\r\n\r\nWhy?
    because it is all the rage? Spatial relationships all have to work together. That
    includes intercharacter space, word space, line space, and very important, margins.\r\n\r\nWatched
    <cite>Bernard and Doris</cite> on HBO the other night, and went & dug out Durden's
    <cite>The Dukes of Durham</cite>, published in 1975. That book was set Linotype
    metal. At first, you do notice the old technology a bit, but then you don't &
    can enjoy the book. A rather timeless design.\r\n\r\nContrast that to <cite>A
    Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA</cite>, by Tim Weiner. A Pulitzer-Prize
    winning book. No bottom margin. Top margin too great. Space between running head
    & text too great. It bothers the hell out of me on every page.\r\n\r\nWhile I
    do think it is true that all books reflect the time of their manufacturing, designs
    that don't try to tart things up too much, that don't slavishly follow the current
    fashion, fare rather better over time. Not just my opinion, it is also what the
    likes of Ron Costley & Rich Hendel advise. "
