  body: "You've got a good start. I'd suggest breaking out of some of the more rigid
    modularity; the letters aren't going to feel so stiff if they're less \"perfect.\"
    Also watch out for optical correction; many of your round letters look lighter
    than your rectangular letters \u2014 this is especially apparent in the NO pairing.
    I actually like the \"clumsiness\" of the capital G \u2014 it's less rigidly geometric
    than the other letters."

  body: 'Thanks Eric, that''s helpful.  When you say less ''perfect'' what do you
    mean exactly: the round letters should be more elliptical, or the legs of the
    K and R a little curved perhaps?  I see what you mean about the respective weights
    of the round and rectangular letters, that''s certainly worth addressing.  '

  body: "There are some elements here that reminds me of Art Deco (or perhaps late
    Art Nouveau \u2013 not the overly curly style, but the straighter variants such
    as ITC Anna (https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/anna/)). You can press that yet
    further by making the /O and /Q distinctively egg-shaped. Slightly curving the
    legs of /K and /R would also move you more into that direction, if that's where
    you want it to go.\r\n\r\nI'd love to see a slightly lighter variant as well!"

  body: Hi Keith, what I mean is that right now you're all squares and circles, and
    if you ease up on that rigid geometry a bit your letters will feel a little more
    comfortable. Futura works because it's *not* actually perfectly geometric; it
    makes allowances for the human eye. Some of your joins on letters like the m and
    n are really heavy optically; see if you can give them some air by deviating from
    your geometry a bit.

  body: "Hi\r\nNice looking typeface. It has a sort of wood type thing to it.\r\nLike
    others have said maybe slightly work on softening up the geometric feel. Maybe
    by adding some contrast and varying the widths of the strokes (slightly) based
    on a broad nib pen rule.\r\n I would also suggest you make some optical adjustments.
    For instance:I think you need to add some overshoot to the round shapes (G, O,
    Q, U, b, c, o ... etc. ) \r\nI do see some overshoot in the lowercase o and on
    the uppercase C but the rest needs it as well.\r\nAlso \"symmetric/mirrored\"
    shapes such as the S, s, Z and z would probably benefit from enlarging the bottom
    part a bit to balance the letters more. Right now the top and bottom parts are
    identical in size and that kind of makes the top look bigger/heavier.\r\n"

  body: Thanks Magnus.  I'm with you on the overshoot.  I corrected this following
    Eric's comments and it's helped solve the weight discrepancy problem between rounded
    and square letters.  Your other comments are noted too.  Much appreciated.

  body: I've been putting your suggestions into practice and have added overshoot
    to the rounded letters, given corners to the counters of the lower case letters
    and made various other tweaks.  What do you think?  Hopefully you can see the
    attached, although I've been having some trouble uploading files to TPHL.  One
    last attempt, then I'll try again later if no joy!

  body: It's coming along nicely. The '4' feels a little heavy to me, and maybe make
    the bottom half of the '8' slightly broader than the top half?

  body: Hi Dave - yeah, funny you should pick up on that, I noticed it immediately
    myself once the file was uploaded.  Guess I've been concentrating on the alphabet
    so much I forgot the numerals!  The dollar sign looks a bit heavy too, don't you
    think?

  body: "The /G seems to crouch down a bit. I see its top arch is different from /C,
    /S, and /3. Maybe you want to unify these -- I think the almost flat bottom of
    the /C and /3 could work for the /G as well, given that it would lose the spurs
    on the top and bottom but you'd still have the serif in the center.\r\n\r\nThe
    Dollar looks fine to me; didn't you mean the ampersand next to it instead?"

  body: Hi Theunis - what you say sounds logical and I did start out with a flattish
    topped /G, but because it's a much broader character than the /C and /S it just
    didn't look right.  That's how I came up with this rather 'clumsy' /G in the first
    place!  Some of you claim to like it, and it's beginning to grow on me too.  A
    touch of overshoot should solve the 'crouch' problem.  But thanks again for your
    thoughts.

  body: You are right to want a better name for it; Boutique just doesn't work for
    this font. Consider city names, locale names, surnames, etc. Eventually you will
    hit one that just feels right.
