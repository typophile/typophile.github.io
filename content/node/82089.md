  body: "Yes, I'm a designer. I'm looking for type suggestions. Something that will
    match the Chi-Rho (PX) symbol that I included in the attachment.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't
    need to match exactly, of course. But something of that same angular nature and/or
    something that has a Greek language look to it.\r\n\r\nDo you have any suggestions?"

  body: The light weight of Carol Twombly's <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/lithos/">Lithos
    Pro</a> might be a good match. It isn't angular like the treatment of rho in the
    chirograph, but it references early Greek inscriptional lettering and would harmonise
    nicely, I reckon.

    \ That looks like one of the Eastern Orthodox Church symbols."

    [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/andreas-stotzner/lapidaria/|Lapidaria]] seems to
    fit that mood of type, and it comes with Greek support.\r\n\r\n(You may check
