body: "I have recently moved all my fonts into suitcase fusion after years of using
  various font managers and find myself quite happy now. However I have many fonts
  that have over the years been given different suitcase names by different foundries
  and what not, and now I currently have far too many multiples of the same fonts,
  with slight deriviation of name (EX. \"font\" and \"fontAB\"). Normally I could
  just delete all the duplicates, however some have a variation the other does not,
  such as a italic bold or something unique.\r\n\r\nI really am just looking for a
  suggestion on how to clean these all up and get them into one group with just the
  proper name, but you cannot change a fonts name in fusion. Any suggestions would
  be appreciated."

  body: "Not all \"cuts\" of fonts with the same Postscript name are the same. In
    the case of Futura, see this thread:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/18710\r\nand
    this article\r\nhttp://www.spiekermann.com/iblog/C61720386/E1641366970/index.html\r\n\r\nThat's
    why Suitcase's FontSense technology is critical. For auto-activation purposes,
    it can tell the difference between different fonts of the same name. Solutions
    from major font foundries will likely be oriented around re-licensing.\r\n\r\nFonts
    from independant foundries are likely to have unique names. So, I would encourage
    you to support them by buying their products. Fonts are software. So, this is
    particularly important for unique design projects. \r\n\r\nIn Suitcase, you can
    chose Tools -> Find Duplicates, which identifies fonts with dupe Postscript names.
    It cannot tell you which version is better however. Often, people favor the most
    recent version from a given foundry.\r\n\r\nNew OpenType versions of fonts provide
    new features and real advantages over previously issued typefaces. In those situations,
    the fonts almost always have unique names which separate them from previous products."
