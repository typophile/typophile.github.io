body: "hello\r\n\r\nim looking for opinions on <a href=\"http://www.lineto.com/The+Fonts/Categories/Text+Fonts/Akkurat/\"
  target=\"_blank\">akkurat</a>, esp. its use for text - i know, there are more suitable
  faces for longer texts, but i rather think of short paragraphs of text, its use
  in short letters, etc.\r\n\r\nhows the quality of \"craftsmanship\" in akkurat?
  after all, it would eat nearly half my month income, so i dont wanna spill out that
  money for \"nothing\".\r\n\r\n"

    Exhbition in Z\xFCrich in 2004 that were printed in Akkurat. I have never had
    the pleasure of using it myself, but I've always held the design in high regard."

  body: "Well, I'm certainly not an admirer of Helvetica in the first place, but why
    spend more than $400 for a typeface with only six weights when it looks like a
    copy of ... HELVETICA. There are so many other options for better looking Sans
    serifs. The second best option would be to buy a bunch of adobe Helvetica Nuew
    and at least save you some money for other fun things!\r\n\r\nPlease note that
    this is a very personal opinon, and secondly no offence towards Lineto, I just
    think the prices are out of range..."

  body: "I'll have to agree with Stefan, the prices are a bit over the top. I had
    to see for myself and transferred the swiss currency into Australian dollars and
    it came out at $550.00 AUD for only 6 weights. For comparsion, I'm planning to
    purchase Storm Open Library which has 12 type FAMILIES for $651.00 AUD!\r\n\r\nPrice
    aside, I do like the face, it seems to have a mix of some features from Akzidenz-Grotesk,
    Helvetica with a \"gothic\" g."

  body: "I've been using lots of Akkurat for the last year, since it had already been
    specified as the primary type for a client of mine. I actually think it's a lovely
    design, with more personality than Helvetica. It has a certain crisp, clean feel
    to it, but doesn't feel nearly as cold and precise as Helvetica, IMHO.\r\n\r\nIt
    works pretty well as text in short bursts, although I find it the regular weight
    a little heavy for most text uses. The light weight works well, and has nice contrast
    when mixed with the bold. The spacing overall feels pretty good, although I tend
    to tighten it up a little bit for text use.\r\n\r\nFor the moment I still have
    a couple of sample postcards you can look at for an idea of how it works as text
    versus display:\r\n\r\nhttp://transfer.ultrasparky.org/ps122/postcards/Danceoff_postcard.pdf\r\n\r\nhttp://transfer.ultrasparky.org/ps122/postcards/Hell_postcard.pdf"

    and am thankful for the responses!\r\n\r\nyes, it isnt exactly cheap, but i think
    here i profit from living (and earning money) in switzerland. i earn about twice
    the price of akkurat as an intern every month.\r\n\r\nhelvetica neue instead of
    akkurat isnt an option, helvetica is the reason why i am even thinking about buying
    akkurat! i want a sans for everyday use for myself and possibly a client. it has
    a different character than helvetica, and i personaly think thats worth the money.\r\n\r\nthank
    you for your opinions!"
