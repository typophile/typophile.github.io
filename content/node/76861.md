  working on. Part of the project is to create a type specimen booklet for a given
  font - [[http://www.linotype.com/296/cottonwood-family.html|Cottonwood]].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor
  the project I am trying to visually communicate how elegant the font can be and
  want to focus on this with my specimen booklet (the booklet has to be based around
  a certain characteristic of the font, my chosen one being how elegant it can be).
  \r\n\r\n\r\nI am looking for advice on two things:\r\n\r\n1. What font should I
  use for the body/descriptive text - I want to keep it simple and compliment the
  running theme of elegance. I've tried a few so far but nothing sits right so far.\r\n\r\n2.
  Has anyone got any good advice/tips on making type specimen booklet? I've never
  designed one before.\r\n\r\n\r\nAny input would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    You need to shut down your computer, get off your ass, and do some research. </em>\r\n\r\nHarsh,
    but true. That being said...\r\n\r\nThe opinions of what a specimen should include
    are as numerous as the people who use and enjoy them. Near as I can tell, the
    only rule is that there are no rules. There are factors that will decide some
    of the format. A display font like Cottonwood doesn't lend itself to a type waterfall
    (or whatever they are called) at 8pt. 10pt. 12pt. etc. It will never be used in
    a text application. \r\n\r\nSome of the best specimens I have seen have been on
    the web however. Research still needs to be done.\r\n\r\nJames"

    are <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/59825996@N00/sets/72157601971266865/\">here</a>.
    \r\n\r\nOn body types, <a href=\"http://www.aapainfo.org/wesson/seltype.html\">here</a>
    is a charming piece that might generally help, though you're in the not altogether
    rare situation where the display type has been chosen first."

    year student and this is my first time working, solely, with typography. It's
    pretty daunting to say the least. \r\n\r\ndberlow, thanks for the links! They
    are most useful.\r\n\r\nDunwich Type, i have done extensive research, and concepts,
    and though i'd ask some experts for some extra advice/opinions as i'm beginner
    at best (no harm in trying to better myself). There's nothing wrong with asking
    for a little help is there? But maybe i could have worded my questions better.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrian"
