body: "I have two ID requests from a beer container. On the top, \"Refined Pleasure,\"
  a wide (perhaps artificially extended?) connecting script with dual-stroke caps.
  Below, \"PRIMA\" set in a geometric sans with pointed bowls on the <strong>P</strong>
  and <strong>R</strong>. The top script I'm sure is a font, but the geometric sans
  could be custom. (The other typefaces on the box and bottle include Copperplate
  Gothic, Berthold Boulevard, Arquitectura, and Futura Condensed.) Thanks in advance!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Prima_6095.jpg]"

  body: Thanks very much, Stephen! That makes sense, since Arquitectura is from Image
    Club, too.
