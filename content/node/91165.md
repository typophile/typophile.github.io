body: "One of my local television stations will be running <em>Best of Show</em> this
  weekend. In one of the scenes in the trailer, Fred Willard's Mr. Announcer Guy character
  remarks to the effect that dogs of all nationalities still bark the same way, which
  I suppose is true.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nHowever, Fred's assertion begs the question:
  do <em>people</em> of all nationalities <em>hear</em> the barking the same way?
  In the good ol' US of A, we tend to hear either \"Arf\" or \"Bow-wow\"; since the
  make-up of the folks who frequent this forum tends to be cosmopolitan, I thought
  that it might be instructive to post this most burning of questions here.\r\n\r\nPlease
  do not let the facts that this is Saint Patrick's Day, my father's mother was born
  in Ireland, and my local Safeway had Guinness Extra Stout on sale influence in any
  way your decision to participate."

    analogous to \u201Cbow-wow\u201D.\r\nAnyway, I would dispute that \u201Cdogs of

    bark at all."
