  body: "Almost 100% positive it's a custom job as most of car letterings (asked many
    times on [[http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/?q=megane|WTF forum]] and
    still never solved). Very geometric, almost all letters look like to come from
    the same basic /o shape.\r\nIf you need it as vector, it is freely and legally
    available to download [[http://www.brandsoftheworld.com/search/logo/megane|here]]."
