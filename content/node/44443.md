  somewhere between $500 and $1000 to put a set together. I\u2019m interested in picking
  up a reproduction/facsimile. Are some better than others? And is the quality of
  the reproductions good, or is it on the level of the low-budget Dover stuff?"

  body: I got a hard bound edition of the Fleuron from Inter Library Loan & it was
    very nicely bound & printed. You might want to get a few from the Library before
    you plunk down the $. Not because it's unworthy, it was really really great actually,
    but just so you have a good idea of what it is & how you feel about it.

  body: "I have an excellent quality reprint (I think) - hardbound - the one with
    the Beatrice Warde article on Garamont (d) from 1928 and don't think I paid more
    than 100 euros at the time maxi. I'll look it up\r\n\r\nThere are specialists
    in typography books of course (Oak Knoll in the US and Wakeman, Collinge and Clark
    and Barry McKay in the UK etc)... I guess if you look up in ADDALL (amalgam of
    several sites) you'll see tons of copies\r\n\r\nthey are damned heavy so prepare
    to pay mega postage if you find a set out of the US\r\nand you have to insure
    as so much gets stolen by the postal services these days (in my experience!)\r\n\r\n"

    v best articles to appear in Fleuron - it is in same format as original - pblsr
    Univ Toronto Press and Ernest Benn in 1973 and beautifully done in letterpress
    and offset for the repros... it cost me about \xA340 some eight years back...un
    bel objet !"
