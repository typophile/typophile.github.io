  body: "This seems to be a tough one. The closest I have found has been [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/psyops/reykjavik_sans_superset/?sample_text=artfairs%20angeles|Reykjavik
    One & Two]], from PSY/Ops. Certain letters from each of these are better matches
    for your sample, but I know this is only similar.\r\n\r\nThis makes me think the
    font is from a small foundry, because I have been searching the main sites quite
    a bit. Either that, or it is something new.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
