  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I am working in a Typography class, and was able to identify most of my types. But I am looking to get more detailed information on each.

The types I am currently working with are: Heavy Caslon, Clearface Bold, Cheltenham Wide and Bold. 

What I am looking to gather in regards to information is: 

-Who designed them
-Who producted them
-What were they commonly used for
-When were they popular
-Any other links or sources that may be out there to help me with this.

Thanks in Advance!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yeah, wouldn't it be great if you got detailed answers to all your questions, then you could just copy and paste into a document. 
Hey presto! ready made essay compiled by the experts. 10/10. Well done!

When I was at college we actually had to use a library, that is soooo last century.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the post, actually this project is very interesting. We started out with only the physical type, which we had to identify as I have above. Then I did a lot of research online and was able to find most of the basics I need, but the above questions and the more important details aren't just on the internet for me to find. I do have some books that I plan to review, but I was told by my Prof that this website was an excellent and friendly place to get help with information about the types that we aren't able to find on our own. 

Guess I will have to try somewhere else to get the information I need.</div>

No? Maybe you didn’t look properly.
