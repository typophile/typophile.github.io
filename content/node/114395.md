  body: "Hi John, did you see the TV clip showing a bill board, in Detroit if I recall
    correctly, that showed a Canadian and American hockey player with Justin Beiber
    between them? The words said looser has to keep him, or words to that effect :)\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "Didn't see it, but that's hilarious.\r\nNow I'm even more disappointed that
    we lost. :)\r\nI can't be too upset though, it was Canadians that last won the
    Cup\r\nfor Philadelphia. Living just outside of Phila, those players are legends
    in this area and bring back fond memories from my childhood.\r\nBaseball may be
    our national pastime, but hockey is the best sport on earth.\r\n\r\nJohn\r\n"
