  use OS X (for a variety of technical reasons), which absolutely blew my mind. I
  know for a fact Ed Benguiat uses a Mac since I studied under him at SVA, and I'm
  (perhaps erroneously) assuming that most Mac users are currently using FontLab Studio
  under OS X.\r\n\r\nCan anyone with first-hand knowledge talk about what systems
  are used by the folks at Adobe, Linotype, ITC, etc?\r\n\r\nI'm not looking to start
  a platform war/discussion, it just amazed me that anyone thought it would make much
  difference which system type was digitized on, since most designers I know of work
  on paper first and then use Fontlab software (whether FontLab Studio or Fontographer)
  that is cross-platform. But it did get me curious if there was some sort of massive
  systems change that took place since I left NYC and stopped doing things with the
  Type Director's Club.\r\n\r\nI know occasionally we have discussion on the more
  technical nature of digital type here, but most type designers I've known haven't
  spent much time worrying about the algorithms or technology behind any particular
  system, so long as they got good results out of it when the file was sent to the
  imagesetter."

    serious that the horrible antialiasing (and numerous other technical deficiencies)
    on OS X makes it useless for type design. Of course everyone I know personally
    is using Fontlab Studio on OS X (with the occassional XP system), but we're all
    nobodies in the greater scheme of type design. I couldn't find any specific references
    on Google to the software/hardware used by Slimbach or Zapf or Kobayashi or Frutiger
    so I'm left simply wondering, now that the bug is in my brain :D\r\n\r\nDoes FontLab
    ever mention platform breakdown numbers? Since they pretty much own the market
    (at least as far as I know! :P) I can't imagine they'd have to worry about some
    competitor getting an advantage by knowing where their sales are."

    that most graphic designers (and type designers I presume) use OS X. Web designers,
    on the other hand, I believe is mostly in the PC crowd.

    still is. He undoubtedly uses a computer for some correspondence and such. But
    it seems right now his focus is on drawing beautiful forms in his amazingly steady
    hand and collaborating with digital experts to see his vision through in FontLab
    and similar tools.

    I know a bunch of type designers. Some use Mac, some use PC, some use both at
    least for testing. Some like the Macs with intel chips because they can do both
    on the same machine. The antialiasing thing makes no sense. There are plenty of
    folks who prefer the Mac way of displaying over PC. The only issue may be screen
    use only fonts for web where the user-base of web pages is 90% PC so designers
    of screen media look to match the majority's expectations. Most font sales are
    for print media users who are mostly Mac using graphic designers. I don't have
    numbers from a real study but I have enough anecdotal experience to know that
    your friends assertion that \"No Type designers use OSX\" is just plain ridiculous
    and false. I would guess that the majority of type designers use Macs to design
    type but a greater number of computer geeks who do post-design production, tweaking,
    verification, and TrueType hinting, use PCs.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    of rendering, interpolation algorithms, pixel grid fitting, etc -- which as I
    pointed out at the time are meaningless to 90% of designers since the imagesetter
    doesn't care about any of that stuff. In my 15 years I don't think I've ever heard
    the word \"algorithm\" uttered at a Type Directors Club or AIGA gathering, outside

  body: "Speaking as part of the Windows-using minority, I'm clear that the majority
    of professional type design today is done on Mac OS. There is a substantial minority
    on Windows, though. I can't say whether the Mac percentage is 60 or 75, but I'd
    say it's somewhere in that range.\r\n\r\nThe reasons I'm on Windows are mostly,
    but not entirely, unrelated to type design:\r\n\r\n- new beta versions of FontLab
    come out on Windows a long time before the equivalent Mac version. (The time gap
    is a lot smaller if you're waiting for the official release, though.)\r\n\r\n-
    Adobe has a bunch of internal business processes that are Windows-centric\r\n\r\n-
    Outlook sucks less than Entourage.\r\n\r\n- when I switched from mac to Windows
    for my main machine, OS X had just come out and was not really ready for prime
    time, plus you couldn't get a Mac laptop with 1200 pixels of vertical resolution
    on its LCD screen. Both of these factors are no longer true, however.\r\n\r\nNote
    that you won't see rasterization differences on my list of why I'm on Windows!
    Yes, I liked Microsoft's rendering better than Apple's the last time I did a head-to-head
    comparison (which was not recent). But most of my testing and work is in Adobe
    applications, which use Adobe's rendering, regardless of platform. So it's not
    a big issue.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    seems to be teetering on the edge of conversion! And the 12th is running some

    what the Hague's set-up looks like? I suspect they have at least a few Macs. So,
    if this is any indicator, I don't think many type designers out there are boycotting
