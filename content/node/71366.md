  already tried IdentiFont, WhatTheFont, and TypeNavigator, with no success.\r\n\r\nThank
  you very much!"

  body: "I'm sorry, I should've made myself more clear. The attachment is an extraction
    of the text from the original. The original (I think the link in the first post
    is too hard to see) is at http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2010/100/8/0/ARTIST_T_Shirt_Design_by_Okami_Rain.jpg.\r\n\r\nThe
    bumps in the picture were made by me as I tried to remove the background from
    the text - I'm new to GIMP, sorry. But in the original, the font looks way too
    clear and crisp at such a high resolution to be a hand-drawn font, especially
    since the author is a member of deviantART and specializes in digital drawings
    - not fonts."

    no commercial one, but still too amateurish to be a shareware font. Hopefully.
