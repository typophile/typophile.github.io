    than to start a new one. Now there are 3&frac12; threads on the same topic.\r\n\r\nAre
    you looking for fonts with a similar \u2018Q\u2019? Because I doubt that the letters
    in this film title are from an actual, identifiable font. There are some hints
    that this was hand-lettered:\r\nHave a look at the counters of the \u2018R\u2019s
    \u2013 inconsistent. The \u2018E\u2019s are different in width. The big dot on
    the capital \u2018I\u2019 would be a very unusual detail to find in a font. \u2018VOUD\u2019:
    the letters seem to dance on the baseline, and/or there\u2019s no overshoot on
    the rounds.\r\n\r\nF"
