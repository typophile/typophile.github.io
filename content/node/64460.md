  body: Illustrator (or vector artwork program of your choice) is your friend. You
    make 'em. Or you can buy dingbat fonts that have such elements (or even regular
    fonts that have them), but really it's very easy to do on your own. Set up some
    custom illustrator brushes and have a go. The ones that are worth keeping, save
    in an illustrator file that you can then load as a Illustrator brush set for future
    projects.

  body: Thanks for the response. I use illustrator, but I'm not very good at using
    the brush tool. When I've loaded the calligraphy brushes and tried to imitate,
    my result doesn't have the elegant thick thin I'm seeing. Do you have a favorite
    brush?

    tons of stuff, and there are stock packs of ornaments like this that you can buy.
    \r\n\r\nIf you want to do this in illustrator the calligraphic brushes don\u2019t
    cut it, you really need to draw custom art brushes from paths that taper and keep
    applying them to the stroke to get what you want. Another option is to draw unstroked
    paths in Illustrator, print them, trace them with calligraphy markers, and then
    scan those to retrace digitally. "

  body: Thank you so much for itemizing the steps I've got step III (although mine
    looks a lot less smooth), but HOW did you get that shape for for step I and II?

  body: "Nice example, Oprion!\r\n\r\nThere are a number of pre-fab font and stock
    options for this, such as Aridi Printers Ornaments or Bickham Script ornaments.\r\n\r\nBut
    I have found that a pre-fab ornament rarely works. And while I'm no master swoosh
    illustrator. I definitely agree that drawing, even a simple rudimentary ornament,
    is the way to go if possible.\r\n\r\nOprion's brush trick is a good one. In addition
    to drawing shapes by hand, you can also use the spiral tool and the blend tool
    to create smooth shapes. But if you have difficulty using the pen tool, the only
    substitute is additive/subtractive combining of paths using Pathfinder.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    if you can draw by hand, you can scan and trace ornaments. A lot of people use
    this method because it frees you up to try lots of different ornament arrangements."
