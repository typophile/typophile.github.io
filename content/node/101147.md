  in investment consultancy. They are two partners. Young people, smart and openmined.\r\n\r\n
  They wanted to get dynamic, modern but serious looking at the same time. Also trustworthy
  with elegant or luxurious touch. They don t want any tag line explaining the business
  which I think is a shame.\r\n\r\nDef. not an easy task. I ve been busy with it for
  3 weeks. All should be ready in a week and I am just stuck with too many ideas!
  All is explained in the entouchments. Thank you for feedback! A d really appretiate
  it.\r\n\r\nKristin\r\n"

    <strong>03.1</strong>, <strong>03.2</strong> and <strong>03.1a</strong> do nothing
    for me. I can\u2019t figure what they\u2019re supposed to represent \u2014 stylised
    |W|? in which case what's with <strong>03.1a</strong>? \u2014 and I don\u2019t
    think any of them hang together particularly well.\r\n\r\nQuestion: any specific
    reasoning behind not making the graphic a more direct representation of that graph?
    Straight-line elements only for some reason?\r\n\r\nAs far as the type goes, I
    much prefer that in <strong>02</strong> over that in <strong>01</strong>. I think
    it just looks more dynamic here however I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s due to
    an innate preference for points on the |W|, but the wider spacing is definitely
    part of it; I do prefer the type in <strong>03</strong> over <strong>01</strong>
    for this reason. \r\n\r\nJust to mention, the graphic in <strong>01</strong> (and
    <strong>01.1</strong>, which I prefer) may have unintended nautical associations
    for some viewers. \r\n"

  body: "To: Gr\xE4fenberg \r\n\r\nThank you very much for comments. I have to admit
    I see some points you mentioned. Some letter spacing is wrong (I will take care
    of all details once I am close to final version). I know it s not an excuse. \r\n\r\n03.1,
    03.2 and  cosists of elements representing rise as well as letters I and W. But
    it s prob too many combinations. 03.1a should stand for some sort of securement.
    So that s to explain. \r\n\r\nQuestion: any specific reasoning behind not making
    the graphic a more direct representation of that graph? Straight-line elements
    only for some reason? \r\n\r\nI did try to make it more like the graph but at
    the end it looked like 2 bumerangs not forming nice shapes, but I suppose I dropped
    the idea too soon heading for more simplified elements. I didn t want to go too
    much into detail but maybe its too simple to make any impression at all. Good
    for pointing the nautical direction. And with all this blue. I will try to avoid
    the feeling. \r\n\r\nSo, now I have my enthusiamsm back thx to your useful comments.
    \r\nLet s see what I manage to do from the graph. \r\n\r\nThank you again."

    consultancy. That said, I wouldn't have ever thought of anything like that graph
    from your icons. If that means that you took it that much farther beyond your
    inspiration then good. But don't forget to get back to your brief and ensure you
    are communicating the core message of the brand. What I am seeing in 01 is arrows
    pointing back and forth, a kite, skewed bowtie, triangles intersecting, and a
    graph depicting a slow rise followed by a sharp drop and another slow rise. \r\n\r\nHave
    you tried to make a W from the letters IN. Seems like a simple type solution and
    possibility a allusion to WIN. It could easily take a form much like your graph
    ideas."

    NOT the image you want to present to potential investment customers. The logo
    graphic in the first one has no connotations at all - it's just a pretty picture,
    which shouldn't be where it is. Instead, it should be vertically centered with
    the text, or else (with some resizing, possibly) be over the text, left aligned,
    or below the text, right-aligned.\r\n- Herb"

      express movement. The idea was just to make it dynamic.\r\n\r\nIn enclosed attachement
      I made the triangls appear more like a graph, by one I was inspired earlier.
      But it seemed a bit empty (1 to 4), that s why I picked the full form triangls
      (catch attention also). \r\n\r\nThank you also for the layout suggestions. It
      has to be horizontal. So, I changed the layouts by your suggestions. Hope I
      got it right this time...\r\n\r\nK.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/inwiz_layout_6630.png]"

  body: "I prefer the solid version of the 'two triangles', and  I don't think that
    the graphic should go beyond the top or bottom of the text. It should be a bit
    smaller and closer, it now looks very disconnected. In the outline version, the
    weight doesn't balance well with the weight of the text. It might imply motion
    a bit better if the central line were very slightly sloped.  I don't like the
    one that looks like a lambda at all!\r\n - Herb"

  body: "The solid versions certainly seems more dependable. I wonder why you began
    exploring the triangles as movement. It also paints a nice story of zig and zag
    ... zig when then market zags etc ... though I don't know if that's wise investment
    advice, it seems like a nice story.\r\nI also wonder why you decided to switch
    to outlined versions?  They seem to begin suggesting a loop. I understand the
    infinity symbol is a strong icon, but it is lost in this approach.\r\n\r\nPretty

    word (trading) at the last moment...:( \r\n\r\nCan someone try to choose which
    font fits the best? And also position? They wanted to have the word trading aligned
    with inwiz above. But in my view it feels a bit squeezed. \r\n\r\nI wanted to
    make helvetica (I know but it s the only font that really fullfils my needs) more
    interesting. But the guys are quite conservative, so I included a version Helvetica/Helvetica
    as well.\r\n\r\nI tried Garamond but they said it seems too romantic :(. I dont
    \ think so, but ...\r\nAnyway...\r\nIt s not yet aligned, will do it all than
    (after I buy the font) for the word trading.\r\n\r\nSo what do you think? \r\n\r\nThank
