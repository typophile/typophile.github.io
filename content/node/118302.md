    one rung me a bell instantly: commercial font, recent, blue background MyFonts
    font specimen... But no name or foundry. I decided to run WhatFontiS (not using
    anymore WhatTheFont app as most of the time, it can't even identify fonts sold
    on MyFonts... Shame...) to get a little help but no valuable clue. Then I remember
    this type was designed by The Northern Block, a complete different design of what
    Jonathan Hill usually delivers. I browsed his fonts and found Velik."
