body: 'Hello, I am a newbie here and a newbie to the whole font creating thing, so
  hello everyone, and I&#39;ve been struggling with a following issue for weeks now:
  <BR>I was given a bunch of .fog&#39;s created on Mac to convert and generate PC
  TTF fonts. I also wanted to make Italic versions of them, which I made with the
  simple Element:Transform:Shear -12. They converted fine, but I have a problem with
  family building. I generate two TTF&#39;s: the original one and the italic one,
  setting the Font Info:General attributes respectively to Font and Font -Italic.
  When I try to add them via ATM Deluxe I use for managing all my fonts, it would
  show up only one of the two fonts. ID changing didn&#39;t help. Am I missing something
  or is there something wrong w/ the Fontographer itself? Is there any other tool/program
  I could use for such conversions/modifications?'

    fonts on Explorer, for example? <BR>If not, Fontographer probably generated the
    two  <BR>fonts with a same file name.

  body: Yes, I can see both fonts in explorer. They don&#39;t show up only on ATM.
    <BR> <BR>If I put the entire font names in the first window, the system won&#39;t
    percept them as a family, so I won&#39;t be able to use the italic style on my
    font in DTP programs or anywere else.

    notice &#40;at least not consciously&#41;, but I assume you realize that mechanical
    transformations like that produce inferior results. If you look at almost any
    italic &#40;even ones called oblique that maintain the Roman structures, but especially
    so-called &#34;true&#34; italics that are totally different than the Roman&#41;
    you&#39;ll see that at the absolute very least there has been some manual post-processing,
    but very often the whole thing is redrawn. Also, the larger the angle you use,
    the greater the distortion. <BR> <BR>At the very least, call the resultant fonts
    &#34;Oblique&#34;, not &#34;Italic&#34;. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    <BR>I am aware of that. However, I wanted to make those italics in the &#39;quick
    and easy&#39; way, as it is the voluntary part of my job. Besides, the font is
    sans-serif grotesk &#40;like Helvetica, I hope I got the terminology right&#41;,
    so simply shearing it does not do it much harm, and I was told that -12 is the
    optimal angle for such transformation. <BR> <BR>Anyway I&#39;m in trouble, when
    it comes to discussions like this, as there are like 2-3 font professionals in
    my country which is not that big itself, and font design is not taught in schools,
    so I guess forums like these are the only place to learn things. <BR> <BR>I will
    keep in mind the Oblique suggestion, thanks <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    <BR> <BR>&#62; What do you mean by &#34;ID changing&#34;?  <BR>In the Generate
    Fonts dialog there&#39;s a font ID#, which is generated automatically, I suppose.
    I&#39;ve been told that if something doesn&#39;t work, ie. the fonts not being
    generated the right way, altering it manually often helps. &#40;It is lame, I
    know <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"

    look, I guess.'

    for a trouble like  <BR>yours. Specially for ATM. Besides not being recommendable,
    <BR>I don&#39;t think reinstalling your softwares will solve the problem. <BR>
    <BR>Is the italic font correctly generated? Check out with Windows  <BR>default
    font showing &#40;just double-click your font files on Explorer&#41;. <BR> <BR>Btw,
    you don&#39;t need ATM to install TT fonts on Windows. <BR>Try installing via
    Control Panel&#62; Fonts.
