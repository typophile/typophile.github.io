  section: http://typophile.com/resources) that used to be available on this site?
  They are very valueable, and with the new site, I can no longer access any of them.
  I'm particularly interested in the article \"On classifying type\" by Johnathan
  Hoefler, and his courses in \"type styles 101\" and \"intro to typeface design 110\".\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone know if these will all be available anytime soon?"

  body: Ah. I should clarify. I'm only a loud-mouth here and not a tech person. I've
    volunteered, but I think the guys are too smart to allow my hands to get near
    the code. But thanks for caring Dez.
