body: I got an ID request for my least favorite type style - Techno - and the best
  I can come up with to match this is a mix of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/handel-gothic/"
  target="_blank">Handel Gothic</a> and Ray Larabie&#39;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/larabie/zekton-deluxe/zekton-deluxe/charmap.html"
  target="_blank">Zekton</a>. Then I would have to add gaps in the E from Zekton,
  and find a new M and R, because neither of them matches, etc. <BR> <BR>Not a good
  solution. Occam&#39;s Razor, or something, suggests this is too complex. It&#39;s
  probably a font, not a cobbled up mixture. The small lettering looks like the same
  font, so there are a fair number of letters to see. <BR> <BR>Can anyone recognize
  this one, or is it custom? &#40;They use Bauhaus as the other font on their <a href="http://techniceuticals.com/"
  target="_blank">home page</a>, so I don&#39;t think they get a lot of custom design
  done, if I had to guess.&#41; <BR> <BR>Thanks for helping me out.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/49846.gif"
