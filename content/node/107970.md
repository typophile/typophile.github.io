  body: Jack, I have the same impression. But prior to adopting a change, I suggest
    you to make print tests to see if this illusion persists. Screen bright may induct
    different impressions than prints.

    it\u2019s actually a common optical illusion. I mentioned it in the article I
    just wrote for Communication Arts...."

  body: I'm sure you'll see me tweet and FB and such when the article is out. It's
    about how to tell well-crafted fonts from crap, which ends up being basically
    about all the tricks of human perception you have to compensate for in type design.

  body: "Thomas, I would love to read that article as well when it's out.\r\n\r\nI
    also agree the open ends have to be thicker generally, but which E looks better
    is contextual in my opinion. From a distance the left E looks better, and I suppose
    this is the best way to view the typeface. When I look up close though I see the
    left E features semi-transparent pixels to suggest a very slight slant whereas
    the right E features very sharp horizontal lines. I don't think this is an optical
    illusion which actually affects the shape of the letter though. I don't think
    it should be compensated for. Perhaps only if you're doing a really big geometric
    display letter."
