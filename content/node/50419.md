    Zapf's Michaelangelo and Palatino Italic."

  body: It's from a book by Tom Eagleton named War and Presidential Power. The first
    pages are missing so I don't have a print date. It shows some wear, so it could
    be over 20 years old, I don't know.

  body: "There have been countless rips of Hermann's work over the last 5 decades.
    Although it is strikingly similar to Michaelangelo let me make a few observations.
    There was never an italic, it is too bold and the R is not right as well as many
    of the serifs. Possibly phototypositor magic and a bit of noodling.\r\n\r\nMichael"
