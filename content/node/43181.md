  a reminder about the Business of Type event we're hosting on the 3rd and 4th of
  next month. The organizers have added some additional speakers, and are still accepting
  registrations. \r\n\r\nDetails here... \r\n\r\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/news.aspx?NID=6121\r\n\r\nCheers,

    said. \r\n\r\nI would also love to come shoot it if you would have me it but the
    cost to get there from Anchorage is a bit dear at the moment. ;-)"
