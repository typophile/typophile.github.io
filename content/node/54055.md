body: "I am working on materials for a lecture and workshop I am planning, involving
  shapes that could be letters but are not, in fact, part of commonly recognised alphabets.
  These will be used to examine strategies for harmonising arbitrary shapes into sets,
  in the same way that we harmonise different letters into typefaces.\r\n\r\nI have
  come up with some shapes myself, but I thought it would be interesting to invite
  Typophilers to contribute possible shapes. I can't promise to use them all, but
  if I use yours I will include your name in acknowledgements at the end of my lecture.\r\n\r\nI
  am looking for roughly monoline shapes. They will be given to students, who will
  have the job of drawing the shapes in ways that harmonise with various type styles
  and scripts. I will post some images of the results here, and the students' responses
  to the experience will be incorporated into the lecture. I may revise the submitted
  shapes slightly, if I think this will provide particular kinds of challenges for
  the students that will increase the value of the exercise.\r\n\r\nImages can be
  posted in this thread. Thanks in advance to anyone who chooses to participate."

    It's of course an interesting problem to give, compared to the class I've just
    given the low resolution san serif assignment to do.:)\r\n\r\nThe way that we
    harmonise different letters into a typeface are aimed to render meaning to others
    via matter and energy with some sort of tone of voice. So, there is a harmonization
    strategy leading to Gutenburg, to 11 point Old Dreadful 301, another leading to
    Helvetica, and yet another very slightly different leading to 11 point 96 dpi
    Arial\r\n\r\nThe wide range through abstract, pictoral, and alphabetic signs yields
    a long history of harmonization strategy improvement efforts, but they are mostly
    based on improvement to the speed, depth or breadth of meaning, (or better performance,
    quality and functionality), imparted to readers from letters. So, as you know,
    the best solutions usually start with a good specification.\r\n\r\nIf you only
    give monoline for a spec. and the meaning is absent, this leaves meaningless spaces
    to adjust contained by properly contrasted lines, doesn't it? So, what strategy(s)?
    The assignment can look more or less like real text, (the tools ya know), but
    at the end of the day what's the advantage of knowing how to make meaningless
    marks when there're but 26 of the real thing to make?\r\n\r\nCheers!"

    Chinese characters, Naxi pictographs all of which emerged from this sort of abstraction
    of real objects.\r\n\r\nOne can generate new shapes randomly by using analog methods:
    Examples: 1- In Japan girls have a game where they peel an apple into as long
    a length of skin as they can, then toss the skin into the air behind them. When
    it lands on the floor it is supposed to spell the (Latin) letter of the person
    they will marry - most often an S ! 2- The old game when the nose on a card is
    made up of a thin chain and if you shake it horizontally the nose takes on different
    shapes. 3- Divination by throwing bones and studying the shapes.\r\n\r\nFor the
    purposes of the typographic study a number pieces of wire of different shapes
    connected or unconnected to short lengths of rope can be tossed to generate an
    infinite number of proto-glyphs.  A variation of this would be to toss a frame
    shape onto a large jumble of such objects on the floor, and the frame 'selects'
    the glyph by outlining the random shapes within.  Or simply use a frame to look
    around you (or on photographs) and pick out the outlines of objects - the outline
    of a tree branch meeting the straight side of a house would be one line of the
    glyph, for example."

    right (if I understand correctly) in saying the specifications are too loose to
    obtain a set of forms which could compose an unexisting alphabet.\r\nBesides the
    immediate advantage told by Hrant, if forms are too complex, without some shared
    thing, and done by various people without knowing what inspired the others', well
    you end up in a quite arbitrary collection, where many forms could have an excess
    of detail, while others have just a few strokes and so on\u2026\r\n\r\nSo, to
    get \"scriptural\", I would not enjoy drawing an arbitrary alphabet composed by
    some Kanji ideograms, a few Arabic or Georgian letters, and so on\u2026\r\n\r\nIf
    you are not in an excessive hurry, try to fix some rules, i.e.: no more than two
    closed forms in a glyph, a sort of \"x-height\" or something like that.\r\n\r\nAlberobanana
    by Alessio Leonardi is basically the same thing, but done by him as an exercise.
    The shapes are not arbitrary, but based on an invented stylization of different
    objects, i.e. a tree (Albero in Italian), instead of the usual \"Alif/Alef/Aleph/A\"\u2026\r\n\r\nEDIT:

    looking for shapes from which to create an unexisting alphabet. I am looking for
    a smallish number of shapes to present to students to harmonise with regular Latin
    letters in a variety of typeface styles. Some of the shapes will be similar to
    the construction of Latin letters, in which case the strategies for harmonisation
    are expected to be similar to those used within the existing typefaces, but some
    of the shapes will be more difficult to harmonise, demanding the kind of strategies
    that are used when trying to harmonise different scripts.\r\n\r\nAs David notes,
    there are multiple strategies, and one of the deliverables for the workshop will
    be student reflections on process and strategies tested or employed.\r\n\r\n[I'm

  body: "\"... I am looking for a smallish number of shapes to present to students
    to harmonise with regular Latin letters...\"\r\nI think there are 4 useful goals;
    using either meaningful or unmeaningful signs, to blend with a given design or
    not to blend. We know that all the glyphs in your garden variety modern font layout
    are not aimed at just one of these goals, and we know that blending with text
    can be a term massively relative to many things. But, per style presented, as
    I think we all know deep down, there is one best strategy per goal, per glyph,
    and per beyond (into things like output method, display environment and audience).
    I tend to stress the whole ball of wax to make each detailed decision mean something,
    at least in the learning stage, as opposed to allowing \"because I felt like it\"
    to rule.\r\n\r\n\"...I am not looking for shapes from which to create an unexisting

    are [...] based on [..] stylization of different objects\"\r\nI think this is
    a great exercise assuming the students already appreciate fairly deeply the object

    obliged to think about and find ways to describe that strategy, or how the strategy
    for one glyph in a typeface relates to the strategy for another glyph, and because
    we're usually starting with familiar letters and a whole typographic history,
    would-be type designers can achieve a lot by referencing 'tried and true' strategies,
    even those only partially understood. So what I want to do is to present unfamiliar
    shapes, in part in order to get the students thinking about the strategies they
    use for the familiar ones.\r\n\r\nAnd, as I mentioned, one of the key deliverables
    of the exercise will be reflections on process, and if the students were all to
    come back and say 'This is a stupid workshop and I didn't learn anything', that
    would be a viable result."
