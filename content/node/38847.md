  for your help.\r\n"

    spacing of the last 4. It reads like t-e-a-f-o-rt-wo\r\n"

  body: It's heavy at the RT and the overlapping of the WO doesn't fit.

  body: it's such a classic font, i think you can afford to split it up into the three
    words. i love the tea part. so can't you then shift the "for" a bit right, and
    again with the "two" so that you still have the condensed look but you read it
    better, thus avoiding what tiffany said?

  body: 'Better, but the main problem remains: The letters in "tea" are merely touching
    each other, while the letters in "two" are actually melting with each other. To
    make things equal, "te" and "ea" have to at least touch each others on the upper
    part, and not just the lower part.'

  body: "I dont agree. the spacing is fine. look at the physical width of the words.\r\n\r\nto
    melt the 'tea' would mean the logo would be off balanced (as 'tea' would end up
    being alot shorter in length). However. I notice that the 'W' in 'two' seems to
    be  dropping below the line level too far. thats not right.\r\n\r\nis this hand
    crafted text, cos I also notice that the 'e' looks odd. If you look at where the
    cross stroke touches the left hand side, that left hand side isnt a smooth line,
    it indents slightly, thats not right, it should line up. maybe its rendering wrong
    on my screen?"

  body: "Thank you all for your comments! \r\nFudog, some parts of the text are hand
    crafted. Something strange happened to the \"e\" but I've corrected it. Bodoni's
    \"w\" is just as you see in my logo, but I think you are right too. \r\nWhat do
    you all think about the \"wo\" in two? Do you think it looks good?\r\nThanks for
    your support"

  body: I see it as trying a bit to hard, almost forcing the "wo"  together. Try letting
    it breathe a bit maybe. It isn't an original idea to meld glyphs together, creating
    "false" ligatures, so I would just give it some room.

  body: "I agree with Wesley. That \"wo\" is way too tight together. I guess it would
    work fine if the \"o\" touches the \"w\" at a higher spot. ( i don\xB4t know if
    that would spoil the spacing, though)\r\nI personally find very odd the \"rt\"
    ligature. Although in itself it looks very nice, I \xB4d rather see the horizontal
    cross in the t going straight to the left and the curve of the r getting under
    it, maybe it will end up looking similar to the \"af\" ligature which looks so
    natural to me.\r\n\r\n(Un saludo, buen vigia)"
