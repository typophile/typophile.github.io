  in an old AMPHOTO book. I feel I should know what it is, but I don't. It looks a
  lot like Caledonia, but it's less distinctive, leaning a bit towards Century Expanded.
  Also, it has very short descenders.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bold_sam_5519.jpg]\r\n\r\nHere's
  the bold face, as that may be helpful."

  body: "It may well be Caledonia. Looking at V&M's <em>The Type Specimen Book</em>,
    the six and seven point sizes of Linotype Caledonia had very small descenders,
    while the larger sizes, even eight point, had the more generous descenders with
    which I am familiar.\r\n\r\nThe book in question was set in a smaller size than
    is usual for books, presumably so that it could be a small volume and economical
    despite being printed on glossy paper."
