body: "Hi everyone\r\nI'm quite a fan of Phil Baines' work \u2014 as an author, a
  teacher and a graphic designer \u2014 and I recently read that he also designed
  several typefaces, some of which I already knew \u2014 Vere Dignum for Linotype,
  FF Can You for FontFont. Yet it appears that his typographic \u0153uvre is wider
  than that and I wondered if anyone at Typophile had ever seen two other designs
  by Baines I've heard about, Toulon and Horncastle (both 1994).\r\nThank you very
  much."

    digital hybrid - not an original design.\r\n\r\nWhat does Horncastle look like?"

  body: Toulon was shown in Eye Magazine. You might find Horncastle right next to
    it. I may have a look for Toulon & see myself in the next day or two.
