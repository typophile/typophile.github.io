    href=\"http://www.fontshop.be/details.php?entry=160\">my blog</a> at <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.be/\">FontShop.be</a>
    first. There's a handy Search tool, so all you need to do is input the movie title
    to see if I have it covered.\r\n\r\nThis is <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=C.9389.0.0\">Percival</a>
