  body: Not sabotaging, perhaps off the mark. Would you like me to leave? Then you
    could have this place to yourself. You could ask the questions and then answer
    them.

  body: "You and I don't make this place. I don't want you to leave, but I also don't
    want to see something I value be abused. If your particular post above was not
    such a case, then I apologize. But then, I would have to ask:\r\n- Why would somebody
    who wants to make money selling fonts recommend a free one (that's not one's own
    attempt at promotion)? Especially since Steve wasn't even asking to save money.\r\n-
    What's the purpose of neutering old threads of yours?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    that is not military or collegiate and the dafont suggestion (from typodermic)
    is Octin sports, Octin prison...\r\n\r\nBefore choosing prison, you could have
    a look at http://www.identifont.com/similar?428.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
