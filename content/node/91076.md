  about all the crude joinery stopping and starting the lines, this is a first up
  study and I'm no where near comfortable with doing it in only three segments -  but
  as hand drawn goes I can do a lot worse :) \r\n\r\nThe letter is on the end of LOV.
  \r\n\r\nComments & crits greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nn."

    If not, how will you\r\nhandle the overlaps, to get typographic notan?\r\nAnd
    along those lines (pardon the pun) what's\r\nthe deal with the top intersection
    with the \"v\"?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "<img src=\"http://www.graphicdeclaration.com/images/e_study3.jpg\">\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the comments :)\r\n\r\nEventually I had trouble with the expression right
    part of the letter and eliminated the narrower bits and removed the negative space
    seen just before the right side 'ball' terminal. It's now stouter and not so exaggerated.\r\n\r\nI'll
    post up the whole piece soon as I can.\r\n\r\nHrant, the letters will be done
    in outline with a fill. The intersection of the v is a common graffiti technique
    of blending /merging separate elements. So I want to merge the v's right side
    ball terminal with the e whilst having the e as the dominant element seen as an
    overlap.\r\n\r\nn."

  body: "Sort of the final one for now, I brought in the expression to a point to
    where the terminal is now perceived more within the letter shape and enlarged
    (might yet increase the size even more) the terminal to be as large as the one
    of the cross bar, and rotated the inner part of the terminal to add some tension
    between itself and the stroke...\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.graphicdeclaration.com/images/e_study4.jpg\">
