body: Is there a way to figure out how many pixels a string of characters takes up
  from it&#39;s font size? <BR> <BR>Ie. what is the pixel width of &#34;this string&#34;
  in Arial 8pt?

  body: 'To get the width of a string set in a given font, you need: <BR> <BR>- font
    size <BR> <BR>- the font itself &#40;advance widths at least&#41; <BR> <BR>- to
    know if kerning is on, and if so, account for it as well <BR> <BR>- if it&#39;s
    TrueType &#40;as Arial is&#41;, and you&#39;re looking at the hinted widths, you
    need to actually run the glyphs as programs to see whether the widths change <BR>
    <BR>This assumes the text isn&#39;t justified and has nothing else to mess up
    its spacing.... <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T'

  body: Thanks for the replies. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m exploring some ways to get text to
    fit within a certain pixel width of an html table cell. Ideally I&#39;d like truncate
    the text with an ellipses after a certain number of characters, so it wouldn&#39;t
    have to be 100% accurate... but I&#39;d be okay with an html/css solution &#40;which
    I&#39;m also not having much luck with&#41; that just makes the text go bye bye
    after x pixels. <BR> <BR>Anyway, thanks again.

  body: You might consider using a monowidth font - that&#39;ll save you a lot of
    coding. <BR> <BR>Otherwise you might use canned approximations of bitmap widths
    for &#34;prototypical&#34; glyphs &#40;which does depend on point size though&#41;
    - like take &#34;i&#34; to be three or four pixels. Arial would be a good source
    for these. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    best you can do is suggest a typeface at a certain size, but you need to accomodate
    the fact that anyone can change the typeface and size as they personally see fit.
    <BR> <BR>If you&#39;re OK having text just &#39;disapear&#39; then wrap the text
    in a fixed-sized div with overflow set to hidden. <BR> <BR>'
