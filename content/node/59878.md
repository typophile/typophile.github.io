    You can have either in a font but not both.\r\n  (Fonts are no 3D objects)\r\n-
    The two O's are similar but different.\r\n\r\nMaybe the free font Xanax will do
    for you."

  body: "Actually, while the two Os are different, one looks like the other one but
    squooshed. So, it COULD be a font (or based on a particular typeface).\r\n\r\nThe
    3D effect is certainly something one can do in a font (it's not actually 3D) and
    the overlap could easily be achieved via negative letterspacing. Not saying it
    *is* a font, but those two things don't preclude it from being one. "

  body: "Take a look at the thorn inside the bowl of the O - to me it looks larger
    in the \"condensed\" version. It should be smaller if it was simply condensed,
    shouldn't it?\r\n\r\nAs for 3D: Of course you can imitate 3D effects in a font,
    just like you can do perspective in a drawing on a flat piece of paper. But as
    soon as two such letters overlap the effect is gone. The rendering engine does
    not know which letters you mean to have \"on top\", so the outlines of your letters
    \"below\" will shine through. Which is obviously not the case in the image. (Remember,
    I wrote \"You can have either in a font but not both.\")"

    had no luck finding the above t-shirt so this was my last resort!

    can't really tell from the photo. Just a theory that it could be a modified O
    but you may certainly be correct as well. \r\n\r\n\"letters \u201Cbelow\u201D
    will shine through. Which is obviously not the case in the image.\"\r\n\r\nA typeset
    line, no, but one could easy typeset the line, convert to outlines and fill and
    overlap as much as one would like. "
