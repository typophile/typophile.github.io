  body: Hi Graham, <BR>this looks promising. Maybe you should us more details &#40;bigger
    picture&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Do you intent to make a roman as well, or is it an Italic
    design, standing on its own? <BR> <BR>I am not sure about the &#39;O&#39; and
    &#39;Q&#39;. It feels like the top part shouldnt be open. <BR> <BR>---Jacques

  body: A larger one here. <BR> <BR>I like the O and Q, and intend to keep them. The
    font will only be this italic style. I have noticed the Z needs some attention.  <BR>&#92;
    <BR>This is a semi freestyle font, so I do not want uniformity within the font.

  body: This is beautiful! the only thing I see is the L has a funny thing on the
    end and the f tail is kind of wispy and might look better if it was stronger.

  body: Thanx for the remarks, Jess. The f is a bit dodgy at end and the L was an
    idea that obviously sticks out rather tha fits in. <BR>Will have a fiddle and
    fix them up.
