  extended light <BR>32 extended regular <BR>33 extended bold <BR>34 extended bold
  outline <BR>35 extended bold shadow <BR> <BR>the font includes full punctuation,
  ligatures, and oldstyle &amp; lining figures. I&#39;m also planning on including
  a full sans-serif version of the family as soon as the slab version is completely
  worked out. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/2682.jpg"

  body: Y&#39;no I&#39;m looking for that kind&#39;a font right now for some button
    titles on the nav of a site I&#39;m pumping out. Wish there was something in between
    21 and 22. <BR> <BR>perhaps the regular and bold weights are a bit too close.
    Well the bold simply seems larger, not really heavier. wait a second, that&#39;s
    ext bold. there&#39;s no regular bold? <BR> <BR>hmm well the ext regular isin&#39;t
    as bold I guess but too wide. Its so hard finding a bitmap face that is clear,
    not bold, nor 1 line of pixels. Surely harder to design one. nice font though

    Good to see the slab serif. And I agree with Cody I thought of the early mac days
    when it was cool to outline the fonts. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    say, it&#39;s rather big, how about a 9 pt? '

  body: ' think this typeface is great. but many characters seem totaly broken.  <BR>i
    can see what you tried to achieve in the uc k of 21, discarding the pixels near
    the central joint to make the leg and hand of the k seem alittle curvy but i think
    the letter looks distorted.  same goes for the M &amp; N in that set. <BR> <BR>the
    shadow and 22 are great. and this is a nice family.. '
