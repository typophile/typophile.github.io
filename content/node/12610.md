body: "<strong> [[Indices]] : [[History]] : Modernism </strong>\r\n\r\nModernism is
  a highly contested area, a \"mixed blessing\" in [[typography]] as elsewhere.<!--break-->\r\n\r\nIt
  is possible to clear up one source of the confusion. There is a style of [[typeface]]
  sometimes known as \"modern\". In the nineteenth century it was \"modern\", and
  it is the standard [[text face]] in English---from the first quarter of the nineteenth
  century until the first quarter of the 20th. It is characterised by a strong contrast
  between thick verticals and thin horizontal strokes, a vertical axis and vertical
  stressing, little or no calligraphic quality---such as it has related to the steel-nibbed
  \"copperplate\" pen not the broad-nib pen---with a much closer kinship to engraving
  than to writing, thin horizontal serifs, [[ball terminal|ball terminals]] on letters
  such as f and j. As Bringhurst correctly points out it has little to do with \"modernism\"
  as a movement in art and philosophy: it is, rather, closely related to \"romanticism\".
  Its only, distant, relationship with modernism is that it belongs to the era in
  which printing was industrialised.\r\n\r\nModernism in typography, as in art, is
  generally a movement which began around or after World War I, flourishes between
  the wars, and is then challenged and diluted after World War II, although never
  fully vanquished. At its best and strongest, modernist typography is marked by a
  fairly coherent set of aesthetic beliefs: priority is to be given to function (the
  \"decorative\" is not beautiful); rational principles (systematic geometry, grids)
  are essential; there is nothing wrong with the mass-produced, and there is no special
  value to be attached to the appearance of the \"hand of the craftsman\"--much less
  to the <em>false</em> pretense of craftsmanship in items that are in fact a product
  of the machine.\r\n\r\nIn typography these principles tended to manifest themselves
  in such matters as: a preference for \"industrial\" typefaces ([[Akzidenz Grotesk]],
  [[Helvetica]]) or geometric typefaces ([[Futura]]) over types modelled on or aping
  earlier forms; a preference for sans serif type over type with serifs (since, on
  one view, a serif is a form of decoration); a preference for \"rational\" (especially
  asymmetric) layouts and grids over traditional centered or \"artistic\" arrangements;
  a dislike of decoration; a preference for the honestly industrial (standard sizes,
  ordinary paper) over the crafty or handmade. Typographic modernism flourished in
  Germany in the 1920s, under the influence of the Bauhaus and through individuals
  such as [[Paul Renner]] and [[Jan Tschichold]], it flourished in Switzerland in
  the 1950s and 60s. It remains significant to this day, especially in Europe (it
  was never so influential in America).\r\n\r\nIt should be stressed that the particular
  choices described above are not compulsory to modernism, though they are commonly
  held to some degree by modernists. A modernist could well, however, become convinced
  that serifs serve a genuine function, and are not merely decorative. If so s/he
  would cheerfully prefer to use serif text types--but would still be likely to prefer
  a relatively anonymous common font over something lush or antiquarian. The approach
  to typography is informed by and works out of a much more general, philosophical,
  attitude towards design in general and aesthetics in general. Modernism is not a
  set of tricks, nor a style: it is an attitude.\r\n\r\nOr should be. For every philosophical
  modernist, there is a trick \"modernist\", who uses modernism simply as a style--as
  simply another decorative device or style, a matter of fashion rather than conviction.
  As Tschichold's <cite>Die neue Typographie</cite> repeatedly demonstrated, modernist
  devices such as asymmetry, geometric decoration and grids can easily be <em>abused</em>
  simply to create the illusion of being progressive. This approach too, the bastard
  child of the mixed blessing that is modernism, is still with us."
