body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am a student and working on a redesign for Siddhartha by Herman
  Hesse. For the assignment, we are putting together the book start to finish, including
  full illustrations.\r\n\r\nFrom what I've seen, most of the design approaches for
  Siddhartha revolve around a really surface level understanding of the book; i.e.
  a cover with some sort of Buddha/Eastern philosophy/religion-related image on the
  front. Since Siddhartha is really a Western interpretation of Eastern philosophy/religion,
  I really want to get away from this. It's overdone, I think, and inaccurate, and
  it doesn't really do the book justice. It also doesn't appeal to a contemporary
  demographic. I'm hoping to convey a new sense of this book's relevancy to a modern
  reader. Past designs/treatments have been escapist - about traveling into a psuedo-historical
  time through a fable. I want the design and illustrations to direct the reader more
  to the hear and now.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe illustrations I've created will accompany each
  chapter beginning and play upon the main themes of the book: the idea that text-book,
  logic-based knowledge (in this case, represented by a collage of type) by itself
  cannot lead to enlightenment, but rather, intuitive, \"wisdom\" founded on experience
  leads to an ultimate understanding of \"truth\" (with experience-based knowledge
  represented by a collage of bright, images - some pop-culture images, others natural
  forms, others references to history, others consumerism...). These image collages
  also represent the second major theme in Siddhartha: that everything in the world
  is connected and has inherent value and that life, and experience, should not be
  avoided in an ascetic manner. As Siddhartha progresses in the narrative, he finds
  himself closer or farther from enlightenment based on his participation in these
  to modes of understanding; the illustrations -simple silhouettes that are either
  letter or image based - represent these states. \r\n\r\nA link to some of my illustrations
  can be found here:\r\n\r\nhttp://erinkendig.blogspot.com/2009/06/illustration-word-image.html\r\n\r\nI
  am looking for typeface in which to set body copy of the book. I am thinking a serifed,
  old-style font might be best, but I'd like to do something other than the ubiquitous
  Garamond. I'm not too particularly familiar with the various typefaces that are
  out there.\r\n\r\n\r\nI would like the type to be somewhat calm feeling, understated
  - I feel like setting the type with generous (though not insane amounts) of leading
  might be appropriate. I don't want it to feel too overly whimsical - but rather,
  elegant. And traditional, in a way. Nothing too zanny.\r\n\r\nThe format of the
  book will be 8 x 8 square.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions are much appreciated! \r\n\r\n\r\nThank
  you!\r\n\r\n"

    illustrations fit very nicely with Hesse's story. \r\nHave a look at [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Whitman|Whitman]]
    or [[http://www.underware.nl/site2/index.php?id1=dolly&id2=styles|Dolly]]. Also
    [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/arno/|Arno Pro]] just popped into my head.\r\n"

    also thinking of trying to find a Serifed typeface for the Chapter headings that
    has ornate flourishes/tails/style-variations (I'm not sure if any of these are
    the right terms), like Arno has. Do you have any suggestions? (I'm not sure if
    what I'm describing is even clear...)\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hey guys,\r\n\r\nThanks! I have Adobe Caslon on my computer and just took
    a look. The swashes are nice, as is the Italic.\r\n\r\nWill that go well with
    Arno, you think?\r\n\r\nAlso, what do you think about \"stylistic alternates\"
    like this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/stylealternatives_5008.png]\r\n\r\nThis
    is Arno Pro SmText.\r\n\r\nOk, so clearly I wouldn't use the alternates for every
    letter, as seen here...but how are these generally used? I found them when I was
    playing around with the Open Type option in Adobe Illustrator. I kind of like
    them because they seem to provide an antiquated feel and also tie back to the
    idea of Sanskrit - but as applied to a font founded in Western book art (and old
    style font). And you can get a little bit of a more pronounced caligraphic feel
    without going italic.\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think? Do you have any advice about
    these? Like I said, I just stumbled upon them. "

    I figured that much. I just did it as such to show an unmistakable example of
    what I was talking about (since I wasn't sure if I was using the right terminology).\r\n\r\nWhen
    used correctly (like at the end of a ragged line) do you think something like
    that could work for a chapter headline? Is it too...hokey, you think? I've actually
    never seen these used before, anywhere, that I can recall (but I have a bad memory).\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Try setting the first page of a chapter with its heading. Try different combinations
    of Arno's styles, sizes, swashes and even ornaments in the headings and see what
    feels best with the text size you've chosen. And if you don't like any of the
    results maybe try out Caslon or something less ubiquitous. \r\n\r\nWarnock's quite
    interesting but it feels 'spiky' rather than 'calm' to me. Its ornaments are worth
    a look even so."

    I really find it exciting because it have such a different feel compared to other
    \"classic\" designes, while still remaining silent enough for text work. There\u2019s
    also three very different display cuts: Borges Poema, Borges Titulo Hueca and
    Borges Titulo Blanca.\r\n\r\nIt might be too latin american for you, though."

    Wow, I really love some of the display cuts for Borges (Poema is very interesting)
    but I don't know if it good for this project. Needless to say, both are really
    nice and I will definitely keep them in mind for other work. Thank you for pointing
    these out to me!"
