<p>Recently, in a local group of designers, a hot debate arose. (It should be noted that many of these are freelancers with small business clients.)</p>
<p>To make a long story short, there was much complaining about the high price of font licenses. Praise of using freebie fonts over expensive foundry fonts and under the table file sharing seemed to be the norm in this group. There was speculation as to &ldquo;how hard is it really to make a font&rdquo; (which was more-so in respect to digitizing one of the &lsquo;classics&rsquo; rather than designing an entirely new typeface.)</p>
<p>As a graphic designer, this discussion really bothered me. However, I found I had no concrete ammo to back my side of the argument &ndash; which is, you pay for <em>quality</em> and a lot more goes into type design than one would think. But not being a type designer, I couldn&rsquo;t say for sure how many hours it might take to &ldquo;redraw Caslon&rdquo; or why Adobe and ITC charge hundreds of dollars for font family licenses.</p>
<p>Next time this topic comes up, I want to be prepared. Any info is greatly appreciated.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>As I told my mother-in-law (non-designer): a bulk of the work that goes into a good text face is not the letters, but the spaces between them. If you never think about the spacing of the type, then the designer did a good job. Ask them how hard it is, really, to draw and design a logo. I mean, the client gives them most of the answers and the logo&rsquo;s so simple.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Of course not. As for the hours involved: people I&rsquo;ve spoken two can spend 8 hours on a few characters. Seriously, I surprised that working professional designers are even debating this. Do they not know what it&rsquo;s like to have people completely undervalue and hard-to-explain process? Any font&rsquo;s cost can be built into a job, or over the course of multiple jobs if they dont' want to charge outright.</p>
<p>Seriously, those people need to grow up. Do they steal their photography too?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>This comes up with me <em>all the time</em> when I&rsquo;m teaching typography. After suffering the same inarticulate frustrations as you, I end up getting into some rather arcane details re the time spent with kerning pairs, hinting (which I am practically making up as i go along), bezier curves and all sorts of shit that they&rsquo;re too young to know, but with which they are quite impressed.</p>
<p>One of the things i do is show them some screen captures from FontLab of the character sets and outlines of free fonts vs. a good commercial font. I tell them how many free fonts contain incomplete character sets, and how many of them are quickly and roughly autotraced, and i zoom in on the horrors of hundreds of twisted bezier points. Then I show them some breathtaking outlines from e.g. Ross Mills' Plantagenet and go on and on about how much time it takes to make that perfect, and how when you print these at large sizes you can see the beauty of the curves blah blah blah.</p>
<p>I also warn them that poorly constructed fonts can cause Postscript errors (which may not even be true), acne and heart disease.</p>
<p>I also encourage them, if they must use free fonts (and poor wee students always do), to go to good font designers' sites (of which i provide them a list), and try some of the free fonts they have on offereing which are either &ldquo;teasers&rdquo; or sometimes abandoned projects, but bound to be better constructed than what they might find at zang-o-fonts or whereverthehell they&rsquo;re picking up this shit.</p>
<p>How truthful any of this is undoubtedly debatable, but I too would appreciate a little more weaponry in this crusade of explanation.</p>
<p>Incredibly, a student recently noted the poor spacing in the free font they used for a headline, and the time they spent to fix it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>If free fonts are so great, why are they complaining at all?</p>
<p>I look at it this way. A sheet of Letraset dry transfer lettering cost about $6.00 in 1980. That&rsquo;s about $15.25 in 2005 dollars. A digital font typically costs about twice that. Let&rsquo;s compare value:</p>
<p>Useful life
   Sheet of Letraset: Useless as soon as you run out of a character you need.
   Digital font: Indefinite as long there is operating system support; never run out</p>
<p>Flexibility
   Sheet of Letraset: Limited to one size; can be enlarged or reduced with generational loss
   Digital font: Infinitely scalable with no loss of quality</p>
<p>Character set
   Sheet of Letraset: 100 or so characters, depending on font; larger number means you run out of individual characters sooner
   Digital font: Over 200</p>
<p>Availability
   Sheet of Letraset: About 400 fonts in 1980; popular fonts were often on back order at dealers
   Digital font: Over 30,000 commercial fonts in 2005; fonts can be downloaded and used minutes after purchase and are never out of stock</p>
<p>Ease of use
   Sheet of Letraset: Spacing and alignment depend on skill of user; slow process
   Digital font: Spacing and alignment are automatic; as fast as typing</p>
<p>Special effects
   Sheet of Letraset: Dependent on mechanical manipulation or special photographic equipment
   Digital font: Unlimited digital effects and manipulation possible</p>
<p>Back in 1980, designers happily paid for sheets of Letraset, even with its numerous practical limitations. We&rsquo;re talking cheap designers for the most part. If you had a budget, you sent out for type at a much higher price.</p>
<p>For about twice that price (taking into account inflation), digital type is many times more than twice the value.</p>
<p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s not fair to compare digital fonts to Letraset sheets. What about fonts for typesetting machines in 1980? First, you need a typesetting machine, which was $5,000-$10,000 for a low-end model ($12,500-$25,000 in 2005 dollars). A font for a low-end typesetting machine was roughly $75 (and you usually had to buy them four at a time because of the way the machines worked) which is about $190 in 2005 dollars.</p>
<p>No matter how you look at it, digital fonts are a better value than any previous format, even at twice the typical price. True, the development costs are lower, too, but it still takes considerable time and effort to create a good quality font. In any case, it&rsquo;s not the development costs that determine the price people are willing to pay.</p>
<p>The availability of free fonts is the only reason people are complaining about the price. If they can&rsquo;t tell the difference, what&rsquo;s the problem? They should just use the free ones. If they can tell the difference, then it should be obvioius why good fonts are not free.</p>

<p>My respose is that here is no longer anything in this world that is cheap that is also any good. There are cheap and free fonts out there for those who put no more value on a good tye design than they do a bad one; so the bad ones are there for the bottom feeders to use.</p>
<p>This whole &ldquo;how cheap can I get it?&rdquo; attitude has discouraged me to the point that I don&rsquo;t care if I ever design digital font again.</p>
<p>If this seems whiney: tough! I&rsquo;ve had it with people who claim to appreciate type nearly to distraction but won&rsquo;t drop a few bucks to use it. I have had students approach me with packages of more than 1000 fonts that they got for $29.95. They are invariably crappy work.</p>

They have not yet learned to tell the difference between fucking Times Roman and Galliard, let alone the subtleties in spacing and kerning. They can&rsquo;t even spot fake bolds or italics, and when I demonstrate the evils of squishing and squashing type they look at each other like &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see the difference, can you see the difference?&rdquo;. Jesus H. Christ! Explaining what you get from a &ldquo;good&rdquo; font is a hard sell, and believe me the &ldquo;why, in <em>my</em> day &hellip;&rdquo; argument doesn&rsquo;t cut it with them.</p>
<p>I send them to sites like this, and wherever useful discussions about type are taking place (and i will probably send them to this thread), and mostly they just think we&rsquo;re all fucking mad (when my teaching succeeds, they join the madness).</p>
<p>To be honest, in some ways perhaps the most compelling argument for budding, fashion-conscious designers might be that &ldquo;The more expensive a typeface is, the more exclusive it is. It&rsquo;s like Armani or Valentino.&rdquo; Shit. That, they would understand.</p>

<p>I go through this everyday as a design student. Having taken the oppurtunity to design my first face this year I understand the blood, sweat, and tears that are poured into a type design. Not only am I surrounded by students who think <i>I&rsquo;m</i> the crazy one, because I pay for fonts that they pass around to each other, but also teachers that do the same thing in the professional world.

What is a current hourly rate for typeface design</cite></p>
<p>Sorry, friends, you are missing the point. Do you ever consider how long it took a musician to write a song? Or Picasso to paint a picture? If it was all based on hourly rates, all books, songs, photographs and certainly fonts would be free once the originator had his investment in time and materials back (plus marketing &amp; distribution expenses). Those items would thus only cost the price of production like printing and CD-copying etc.</p>
<p>Of course this is rubbish. Things are worth what they contribute. A song or a painting only 
contribute happiness, culture, esthetic pleasure, but we’re willing to pay for them. (Leaving aside speculation like the art business here) If a designer uses paper, he needs to buy it. Same for inks, pens and other materials. A font costs between 29 and 49 dollars, but you can use it over and over (thanks, Mark, for the Letraset comparison), and it generates wealth for the client and the designer. It makes a piece more desirable, more legible, more functional. If we didn’t need more type, there wouldn’t be any. And if clients don’t want to have 49 dollars added to the bill, they’re not clients, but leeches.</p>
<p>The only problem I see is the risk of buying a family for, say, 100 dollars and not getting to use it. For a small studio, that can quickly add a few hundred a months in speculative font expenses. So, if you’re a bona fide designer and have a record of paying proper licenses and also getting you clients to pay for theirs (that’s where the money is for type designers), talk to you favourite font supplier. They may give you an open CD with a lot of fonts on it plus a contract. That’ll state that you agree to buy a license once any of these fonts ever get used in earnest, i.e. in a publication in whatever medium. If you honour the trust invested in you, you’ll get to use thousands of fonts for you presentations, for your own experiments and research, but you only get to pay for them once you get paid. We all know that we only use the fonts we have on our hard drives, at least until we know what we want, typographically speaking. That’s why some of us would even consider looking at freebies.</p>
<p>And finally: my rule of thumb is 100 hours per weight. So an average family these days with 12 weights (some of which, like small caps, may be less work) would take you at least 800 hours, i.e. 20 business weeks or 12 normal designer weeks. It takes a lot of 100 dollar sales (of which designer normally get around 20% if they don’t do their own distribution) to pay for that time, even at modest rates. And out of the 30,000 or so fonts I am just editing for the new FontBook, not even 5% ever pay their designers that investment back.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Erik,
&ldquo;not even 5% ever pay their designers that investment back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was exactly my point when I compared hourly rates of burger-flippers to Glyph-grinders. The title of the tread is &ldquo;The High Price of Type&rdquo; and the sub-question was &ldquo;what is so hard about designing it anyway&rdquo;.
The &ldquo;Leeches&rdquo; you spoke of don&rsquo;t care any more about &ldquo;what they [typefaces] contribute&rdquo; than they do about &ldquo;hourly rates&hellip;&rdquo;.  A vulture is a vulture, feeding on decay. 
The sad truth is that most small, beginning design offices have to put up with all manners of clients to survive.  It is a rare designer who gets to pick and choose clients.  I am glad to see that your suggestion about &ldquo;open disk&rdquo; will at least allow them to pick and choose type by merit rather than if they already own it.  This is a win-win situation for foundries as well as graphic design offices. The less-than-stellar clients may not recognize the value no matter how you phrase it but at least the designer can feel they did the best job they could with the design.
Bravo Eric, I hope other font houses will follow your lead on this.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think a valid point is the fact that sometimes you buy a font and don&rsquo;t get to use it. During two projects I recently bought Bryant and Delicato and it turned out both didn&rsquo;t work for the respective jobs. Notbecause the clients disliked them but because once used in the real document, I didn&rsquo;t like the final look. It just didn&rsquo;t fit, it wasn&rsquo;t what I thought it’d look like. So&hellip; While I figure that maybe I&rsquo;ll get to use them some day, it still was pretty frustrating, and again I found that you can&rsquo;t judge a font by looking at it online, be it PDF or even a typesetter-tool. The only way to judge it is to work with it on a job, print some stuff and SEE first-hand if it works in context.</p>
<p>Apart from that, I don&rsquo;t think fonts are too expensive. While the collector in me wants to have them all, to have maximum choice, and while as a small bureau it&rsquo;s indeed a factor that you cannot just buy a new typeface for some low-budget-jobs, no maztter how much you&rsquo;d like to, I still almost never feel ripped off by most foundries. There are exceptions, such as TEFF, but all in all, I think there is a large collection of fonts that are available and at 200-400 € for a family don&rsquo;t feel overpriced at all. Especially if they&rsquo;re OTF.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>First of all &ndash; <strong>thank you</strong> everyone for your insight! This has become a great discussion.</p>
<p>Secondly &ndash; I feel somewhat compelled to defend my fellow St Louis designers who sparked this conversation. I&rsquo;d hate you to think we&rsquo;re all a bunch of uneducated, font-pirating, middle-American back-woods hacks. There are a lot of talented people in this group, which is all the more reason why this debate got under my skin.</p>
<p>That said&hellip; someone on the &ldquo;other side&rdquo; of the argument brought up this  point:</p>
<p><cite>If fonts were more affordable (in this case, it was implied that would mean just a few dollars per typeface/weight), they would sell to more people. Therefore, type designers would make more money by selling at a higher volume. This theory suggests that they are the ones taking money away from themselves by making their product too exclusive.</cite></p>
<p>What do the industry insiders think of this theory?</p>
<p>Also, the question came up of why &ldquo;classic,&rdquo; &ldquo;public domain&rdquo; typefaces (like Garamond, Caslon, etc) are still charged at a premium price when the original designers are now long-dead. (Well&hellip; <em>I</em> know that <em>someone</em> had to digitize that font &ndash; but for argument&rsquo;s sake, there&rsquo;s the question that was posed).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The more volume argument has limitations.  There is a finite market for fonts.  This is not a broad consumer market.  What would happen is the number of sales would double but the amount of money the font designer gets would drop to 20% of what they get now. My argument is that fonts are already very cheap and have come down a lot in recent years. The amount of piracy has increased though so there is no gain for the type designer.</p>

<p>Stating the obvious. In a way doing a high-quality revival of a typeface where a lot of competition already exists is harder than doing an original design. You have to bring something new to the table. That might include going back to original source material and doing a truer version, or it might mean adding weights, styles that didn&rsquo;t exist originally, or it might mean adding bells and whistles that the competition doesn&rsquo;t have. Compare old Adobe Garamond v Adobe Garamond Premier Pro and on glyph count along I bet the new version is better value for money - and the OpenType features makes it much more powerful.</p>

<p>Full reply:</p>
<p>I have to disagree with the philosophy you&rsquo;re expressing, which measures the value of design in quantitative terms, thereby supporting the price-carpers: If a font is going to be valued for the number of features it contains, and the user get similar high-quality features free with bundled InDesign/Mac/MS fonts, than any price is going to seem too expensive.</p>
<p>It is a mistake to value a restyling of a classic as much as an original design.
Certainly, it can take as much work to do a revival as an original, but that begs the question of the value of the kind of work involved &ndash; it suggests that original design is undervalued in relation to production work and revivals.</p>
<p>How to overcome the perception that computer designed work is not worth much because it&rsquo;s mere technical grunt labor? Or stuff any kid could do with the right software? Not by apologetically rationalizing prices, explaining all the skilled technical effort involved, because you can always get that kind of labor cheaper, or diluted to nothing in a multi-national&rsquo;s commodity.</p>
<p>If you must, charge a premium price for giving an old whore a facelift, with all the OpenType deelybobs, but also demand top dollar for a staggering new work of genius even if it&rsquo;s only available in good old Type 1.</p>
<p>Short version;</p>
<p>Pay up, it&rsquo;s f****** brilliant.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I am not sure if this point has already been raised, but maybe the issue isn&rsquo;t the cost of fonts, but that so many are available free packaged with software.</p>
<p>It seems to me that people complain about the cost of fonts because they assume they are free, like Comic Sans, Times and Arial.</p>
<p>Comic Sans, Times and Arial are NOT free, but because they are bundeled in with the cost of the software, that is the impression designers (and lay man) have.</p>
<p>But this attitude of not wanting to pay for fonts is typical of designers (especially the small, freelance types, of which I am one). They also don&rsquo;t like to pay for photo and illustration rights, nor software. If computers were clonable, you can bet freelance designers would be copying them too!</p>
<p>Why? Becasue it is terribly hard to make money as a small, freelance designer.</p>
<p>But what these individuals don&rsquo;t think about, is what this attitude is doing to the design industry! By not supporting the rest of the industry, these desigers will some day find themselves all alone, trying to defend the cost of design in front of their client, when the client is asking why his secretary can&rsquo;t do the same job with Office and some free MS Fonts&hellip;</p>
<p>In a way, the cost of fonts helps give a designer a reason to charge a real price for his work. And the designers appreciation of the finer points of a well-designed font is what makes him worth the money.</p>

<p>We have gotten into the habit of adding about 150$ to our price estimates for buying a font, even if we won&rsquo;t necessarily use it for the project. That way, we are able to exapnd our font library without feeling that we are cutting into our overhead, and the more contracts we have, the more fonts we can buy!

<p>People who use this argument cannot possible make a living as designers themselves. Do they only charge whatever they need by dividing your living expenses into the hours you can work? And forget about new equipment, software, rent, the times you do not work? Designers who sell through publishers get 20% from the retail price, the rest is spent on marketing (who do you think pays for websites, booklets, support, OT conversions etc?), production, retail discounts (that’s usually 50%),  and – mainly – those fonts that never sell or hardly. Like everywhere else, 80% of revenue comes from 20% of the products, but everybody wants to be able to choose from thousands of them.</p>
<p>And why should revival fonts be any cheaper than new ones? Are books by Shakespeare any cheaper than those by contemporary authors? Book publishers also make their money with a few bestsellers which support all the unknown names. Would we want to do without these? And only have Helvetica, Garamond, Bodoni and a few others? Those could be cheap, because there is no license to pay and no advertising to make them known. The same designers who complain about 29 dollars for a font would be the first ones to complain about lack of choice. I knew a system like that once: it was across the Wall here in Berlin and called East Germany. As a designer, you were told what to design and when, what typefaces to use, what paper to print on and how much you could charge. And if the state didn’t think you fitted in as a designer, they would send you into a factory. For those who liked a non-risk life, this was great. The others ran away into the West or took to the streets until the Wall came down.</p>

<p>Yes, most websites have some sort of preview/tester/engine thingy, but all the ones i have seen will test only a few words at a large-ish size. Great if you&rsquo;re thinking of using it for display but most of the time I&rsquo;m buying for text usage, and I can&rsquo;t tell you the number of times I&rsquo;ve bought a font thinking it was exactly what I was looking for, only to find that set as text, it&rsquo;s not giving the flavour I had in mind. Buying fonts you never use really is upsetting. That, I have to admit, is a major deterrent for me buying fonts. (Do I resort to piracy? No, I just use the same ones over and over and over.)</p>

<p>Erik, I think all that was being said is that this method could sell more product. To me its like high end vs. broad consumer merchandising. Higher price points move <em>less</em> product. Lower price points move <em>more</em> product. Both have the potential to make the same profit. I see that as a valid argument. To me its like Gucci vs. Levi&rsquo;s Jeans. Both make a good amount of money. Levi&rsquo;s makes money by selling more pairs of jeans, Gucci makes money selling fewer pairs of higher priced jeans.</p>
<p>I think a huge problem here is educating the public to understand just what typography is and what is involved in making it. In a nutshell this is what seems to be what we&rsquo;re all debating:</p>
<p>How do we prove or demonstrate the VALUE of type? Until this question is answered the debate will never end. Getting the consumer to understand the VALUE of type is where I think the answer is.</p>

<p>May I remind you of what I wrote a day ago:</p>
<p>&hellip;if you’re a bona fide designer and have a record of paying proper licenses and also getting you clients to pay for theirs (that’s where the money is for type designers), talk to you favourite font supplier. They may give you an open CD with a lot of fonts on it plus a contract. That’ll state that you agree to buy a license once any of these fonts ever get used in earnest, i.e. in a publication in whatever medium. If you honour the trust invested in you, you’ll get to use thousands of fonts for you presentations, for your own experiments and research, but you only get to pay for them once you get paid&hellip;.</p>
<p>Lobby your font reseller, publisher, online distributor.</p>

<p>That is a totally wrong comparison. While it’s true that certain goods carry a premium while not necessarily being <em>better</em> than others, some brands do deliver better value. A Mercedes Benz will still keep its value better than a Ford, but most of the perceived value is in design and – of course – prestige. But a Mercedes Benz will also get you from A to B reliably. Guccy, however, hardly delivers on the practical scale, it is <em>all</em> about prestige – what the neighbours think. I cannot think of any typefaces that one would buy for prestige only. But the functional issues <em>are</em> important, very much like the zippers on Levis jeans would not break easily. With type, you do pay for brand value, because you know that fonts from certain foundries will be technically sound and come from legal sources.</p>

<p>Nick, is your marketing strategy working?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The motivation for outreach is not primarily self-interest. There&rsquo;s no substitute for a good corporate identity, an aggressive marketing and PR program, ongoing product development and frequent new releases, an up-to-date web site with the latest functionality and frequent new material, etc, etc. I must confess I&rsquo;m not checking all those boxes, and if I spent less time online, writing, teaching, and organizing, and more time on the basics of my business, I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;d do even better.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s incidental. The point here is that the &ldquo;never mind the quality feel the width&rdquo; rationalization for the price of type is self-defeating for the independent foundry. It works for the big guys, because it&rsquo;s in their interests to commoditize font design as a mass  market &ldquo;giveaway&rdquo;, amortizing production costs against huge volumes.</p>
<p>But when the sales for a typeface are counted in dozens, which is, I would hazard, a typical average for independent foundries, any user who licenses a hot new indie doozy is getting a pretty damn exclusive product, so price shouldn&rsquo;t be an issue, not just because it&rsquo;s f****** brilliant, but because they will also be able to cock a snoot at their bundled-font-stricken peers and say, with apologies for unprofessional behavior, (short version):</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stuff your H********, losers!&rdquo;</p>

<p><em> A Mercedes Benz will still keep its value better than a Ford, but most of the perceived value is in design and – of course – prestige.</em></p>
<p>This is a great example and I&rsquo;ll elaborate on that. A Mercedes is MUCH more expensive than a Ford. Now, all designers do not have the same standard of living. Some designers can afford a Mercedes and others can afford to drive a Ford. The car industry recognizes the need to address economic status. The point is EVERY graphic designer HAS to use fonts but every car consumer does not have to use a Mercedes Benz. There are rich designers, and struggling designers. I don&rsquo;t see why that&rsquo;s not a valid concern. It doesn&rsquo;t seem fair to force all designers to buy a Mercedes when some are eating Ramen noodles. As long as there are struggling freelance designers around, a type foundry is never going to win an argument with that comparison. My reality is as a struggling designer and a recent design grad I&rsquo;m usually the person who has to explain &ldquo;type ethics&rdquo; to my peers.</p>
<p>Another way to approach this is if we treat type as software, than what is the difference between say Adobe Creative Suite and a type family? Adobe still sells all of the programs individually and as a bundle. Why can&rsquo;t type be the same way?</p>
<p>The font package Erik suggested previously is something I think more foundries should take advantage of, that is definitely a smart business move. Making a foundry appear approachable is definitely an attribute.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Terry, there are cheaper cars and more expensive cars—but there are no free cars (and if you find some, please drop me a line… ;-D ). However, fonts are another story… There are free fonts that are of good quality. There are also fonts that cost just $21, and some that cost thousands.</p>
<p>One thing that many designers are saying here that I&rsquo;d like to reiterate is that graphic designers should not always be covering licensing costs on their own; they should be adding these into client billing. Of course, this isn&rsquo;t going to work for a $60 project, but not every project is that small, even for low-budget freelancers. Graphic design software is much more expensive to license than fonts (even if you get it all at student rates—which are available from many foundries, too, BTW), but most designers who want to stay away from illegal software manage to find room in their budgets for these.</p>
<p>Also, I&rsquo;d like to &ldquo;third&rdquo; Erik and James' excellent suggestion of building relationships with type foundries. Every type foundry knows what is going on in the graphic design industry (the foundries that didn&rsquo;t understand how design works have gone bankrupt…). While not every foundry is as flexible with designers as I&rsquo;d desire, enough of them are that it shouldn&rsquo;t present any real problems for graphic designers who want to pay for all the fonts they end of using in client work (see Erik&rsquo;s thread above). Every foundry is, after all, just a phone call or e-mail away, and most businesses do tend to want to hear from their customers. What have you got to loose?</p>

<p>Approachable yes, but as Erik said, if you&rsquo;re a type buyer and you&rsquo;d like to get special treatment such as font samples for use in assessment and comps, you need a record of paying for licensing. That seems to me like a reasonable working relationship/deal: license some fonts from a foundry and they&rsquo;ll be happy to give you some more to try out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to do that, but if someone I don&rsquo;t know emails me out of the blue and asks me to set a few trade names for them in one of my typefaces and send them a PDF (it happpened a couple of days ago), I will politely direct them to Veer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Flont&rdquo;. But if they were a past customer, I&rsquo;d send them the font.</p>

<p>I agree. I&rsquo;m certainly not arguing that type doesn&rsquo;t have value. I&rsquo;m arguing that people don&rsquo;t understand what that value is when they perceive type to already be free. I have no problem buying fonts. However, I would like to have the option to buy TWO WEIGHTS of a typeface <em>as needed</em> because I cannot afford to buy an entire family for $200-$500. I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s an unreasonable request. If that need isn&rsquo;t addressed, many people will continue to feel put off by type foundries.</p>
<p><em>Terry, I’d like to ask you about this idea of yours, too. What would you recommend that foundries do?</em></p>
<p>This argument always happens amongst type designers and graphic designers. One thing that I think might eleviate some of the tension is to embrace both aspects of design. Type design IS graphic design. The fact that AIGA wasn&rsquo;t involved in TypeCon shows me the turf wars that exist bewteen the two camps.</p>
<p>I think type foundries should position themselves as &ldquo;SOFTWARE distributors&rdquo;. Understanding type as concrete and tangible is something that will go a long way towards educating the consumer. We can&rsquo;t put a digital file transfer in our hands, but we can put a box or a book there.</p>

<p>Terry, this is what (digital) type foundries are required to do, particularly in the States.  US copyright laws have not evolved to cover the actual artwork of a typeface design.  The only thing that is legally protected is the &ldquo;font software&rdquo; and only in terms of the software&rsquo;s use.  Any legally drafted EULA begins with this premise.</p>
<p>But software is not a tangible thing to fileswappers who do not comprehend how it is made or who makes it.  I think the important thing to remember in this argument is the personal connection that everyone is coming around to discussing.</p>
<p><em>Type designers</em> need to position <em>themselves</em> as the source of the artwork contained in the font software. They need to do this between themselves and their distributors as well as with the end users. I would love nothing more than to get up on my soapbox to condemn &ldquo;The Machine&rdquo; for sucking all the humanity out of the distribution process, but I see a massive shift already in progress coming from the grassroots.</p>
<p>Now, there is a direct correlation between Lauren&rsquo;s (engelhardt) uphill battle among her backwards-somersaulting peers and her awareness and willingness to hit typophile.com for our side of the situation.  She knows that we are real people and she can perhaps put the names to the faces (Yes, an obligatory type pun is in there somewhere.) If the rest of her group were aware of this very forum and this discussion and our passion and our contributions to their designer resources, they might begin to understand the value of what we provide.  After that, they might even pay money for it!</p>
<p>And yes, it <em>is</em> about VALUE.  Not of the software or the typeface or the OTF conveniences or the labor hours, but the value of the type designer&rsquo;s ability and decision to share all these things.</p>

<p>Eh, I doubt it. I&rsquo;ve done my best to be an advocate for the cause and now I&rsquo;m just getting mocked for being a youthful idealist. I am so frustrated that I&rsquo;m about ready to throw my hands up and walk away. (Honestly, why would I want to be part of a group that apparently doesn&rsquo;t understand, respect and value their own industry?)</p>
<p>These designers seemingly refuse to see the correlation between their own &lsquo;starving artist&rsquo; status as freelancers and the similar plight of type designers. They just keep resorting to the argument that their clients won&rsquo;t pay up for something they (the clients) fail to see as a valued commodity (type). And the designers don&rsquo;t have enough cash to buy the fonts themselves, so work-arounds (system fonts, freebie sites and occasionally pirated fonts) are their solution.</p>
<p>For those curious, <a href="http://onmysleeve.org/type/fontprices.html" target="_blank">here is our discussion</a>, which I&rsquo;ve mirrored in a different location and scrubbed of real identities to protect those involved. But I felt it was appropriate to show what I&rsquo;m up against here though I didn&rsquo;t want to &lsquo;out&rsquo; these designers unfairly.</p>

<p>For those curious, here is our discussion&hellip;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see what Designer 1 said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Designer 1
How much does it cost to make a font?
Many standby fonts are in the public domain, Garamond, Caslon, Berthold, etc. were made hundreds of years ago. It&rsquo;s 100% legal to scan them into a computer, open them in Fontographer, and create a new version of them.
I&rsquo;ve dabbled with font creation, but not with adding kerning hints, though it doesn&rsquo;t seem like it would be excessively hard.
The question becomes, if Caslon, for instance, only took 20 hours to turn into a new, good quality font, you wouldn&rsquo;t need to charge much to make some decent money from it. I&rsquo;d think you could make a decent business out of just making new versions of public domain fonts, and selling them for much less than Adobe.
(researching it, Caslon does sell for as low as $20 or so for an individual font, though you&rsquo;d need to buy several of them to really use it)
If this is the case, why hasn&rsquo;t someone done it, and/or why are the big type houses still charging so much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>what I really like:</p>
<ol>
<li>kerning hints</li>
<li>if Caslon, for instance, only took 20 hours to turn into a new, good quality font</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>These designers&hellip;..</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sorry. They are not designers. To design  with  freebie  &amp; pirated fonts?  Too sad.</p>
<p>BTW, I&rsquo;d love to see samples — the great design with freebie fonts&hellip;.. and Designer 1 - please post your font&hellip;.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Lauren, here are some facts that may help put things into perspective for your friends:</p>
<p>Yes, there are some people who make a living making fonts, but nobody&rsquo;s getting rich off it. For most people who do it, it does not pay enough to quit their day job. Most font designers do something else to pay the bills. When you steal fonts, quite often you are stealing from people who are unable to make a living at it. This is actually the main reason why it is difficult to make a living making fonts.</p>
<p>Most free fonts are made by amateurs and dabblers. The reason they give them away is because they know the fonts are not professional quality and have not expended much effort on them. They correctly believe that no one would pay good money for them. Plus, by giving the fonts away, they feel they are off the hook if the fonts don&rsquo;t work properly. If you give it away, you don&rsquo;t have to take responsibility.</p>
<p>It is possible to make a mediocre font in 20 hours, but not a good quality one, even from an existing design. And it takes a considerable amount of experience even to make a mediocre font in such a short time. (Except maybe a grunge font.)</p>
<p>A popular font might sell 500 licenses in a year. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are over 200,000 graphic designers in the U.S.</p>
<p>The fact is, since the advent of digital type, the font business relies purely on the good will and trustworthiness of people who buy fonts. A whole industry based on the honor system, if you like. It&rsquo;s amazing&ndash;and reassuring&ndash;that anyone can make money at it at all.</p>

<p>I agree whole-heartedly.</p>
<p>And yes, AIGA addresses the ethics issue, specifically in regard to font usage in their <a href="http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm?ContentID=681">Design Business and Ethics Series</a>.</p>
<p>But do I even need to point out that designers who quibble over the price of a font are certainly not going to fork over the high membership fees to the AIGA?</p>

		<div class="commentbody">The concept of big bucks type houses is long dead.  It is easy to assume that there are type czars out there making a fortune from remakes of classic fonts. Type designers only get 20% of the sale anyway.  Yes, Claude and William are long dead but they didn&rsquo;t even dream of the functionality of the OTF pro fonts available today.  Most classic fonts have very good revivals bundled with design software.  The cost for the fonts is marked up in to the cost of the software suite.  It SEEMS free but it isn&rsquo;t. There is no wealthy type designers who have made their money from their type designs. If they have money, it came from something or someone else. Type designers make LESS money as a group that graphic designers.  Sure, there are a few stars out there but they are not even close to Fortune 500 stuff. Type designers are not &ldquo;The Man&rdquo;, not some abstract wealthy gluttonous behemoth that can be pointed to as the enemy. Anyone who undertakes a career in type design does not do it for the money.  If that were the reason, there wouldn&rsquo;t have been a new type designer in generations.
To those who think there clients don&rsquo;t care what the fonts look like, use the free stuff every time but don&rsquo;t steal someone&rsquo;s work and then give it away.
To those who think they can make a functional copy of Caslon or Garamond by scanning and tracing in 20 hours, be my guest&ndash;and by all means use it in all your work.  You and your clients deserve each-other. In 20 hours, you will have a piece of crap.
If you don&rsquo;t value type and your clients don&rsquo;t value type, then why do you steal it? People steal it because they know it has value. There are places on this earth where people commit murder without retribution. Does that mean those lives have no value? Does that mean murder is not a crime? Does that mean if we placed less value on life that there would be fewer murders?
Stealing is stealing. Don&rsquo;t pretend it is OK just because you don&rsquo;t get caught.

I think too many people with computers don&rsquo;t have a clue what type is or that it was even designed. I think the type community has a large educational job in front of them to educate not just the designers and ad agency types, but John Q. Public as well. It will not happen by wishing or law suits.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Dan has hit it. It&rsquo;s all about ignorance. If graphic designers have such disregard for the value of type, what kind of consideration can we expect from Joe Public? If graphic designers think all the type designers are dead and type is all pirated anyway, then there&rsquo;s a huge disconnect between how type gets made and how people understand type. How to inform this new population? Definitely look for popular venues for publicity and journalism. But can we agree on the message?</p>
<p>Type design is highly skilled, laborious, creative, specialized work that has never earned the kind of returns that other careers do. Type design requires a unique temperament, highly trained visual acuity, historical awareness, and is invisible to the general public. No type designer, living or dead, built any kind of wealth simply designing type for retail sale. The type designers who have a modicum of &ldquo;fame&rdquo; are also not wealthy. Inferring they are, from any popularity they have is ignorance as well. The people that can sustain careers in type do so with custom work that pays off all at once. This is not an opinion, perspective, delusion, or personal position, it&rsquo;s reality. I&rsquo;m in the type industry and I know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pointless to argue the real value of type in dollars, the point is nobody arguing even understands where type comes from.We can go in circles all year with this. Graphic designers obviously need some frame of reference for how good type comes into existence. I&rsquo;ve wished for a long time for a high-profile documentary about the making of a typeface, and preferably one with a respectful or interested tone. The New York Times is barely a step above the Onion in its pervasive disdain for type. The attitude influences the readership and nobody learns anything. Sound bytes are useless if we want the general public to understand what goes into making high-quality type. The entire process needs to be explained and illustrated. Documentarians?&hellip;. Great new subject here!</p>

<p>The best place to do that is in design school. Every design school should have type design as part of the curriculum &ndash; it&rsquo;s a great way of providing insight into typography, which is still the core of the profession. In the educational context, designing a typeface is also a &ldquo;pure research&rdquo; project (whereas most design projects are simulations of real world practice), so it gives breadth to a design education.</p>

<p>This is unfortunately not a universal view among graphic design professors. In fact, many of them here in Germany see such an assignment as an unnecessary relic from the HfG Ulm days (which was when many of them were in design school). Some of them even see calls for type design in the curriculum as being self-serving attempts by type designers looking for [more] work.</p>

<p>Elliot,
Read Eric&rsquo;s comments further up in this thread where he explains the costs foundries have in the process. Everyone has costs and wants to make a living too.</p>
<p>There are a few fonts which sell well and others that don&rsquo;t.  Foundries use their best judgment to sell what they think has a market but they are not always right and have to eat the cost of the initial release.  Sometimes, a font may not become popular until years later when it is &ldquo;discovered&rdquo; by some hot new design firm.</p>
<p>The point is that fonts are really cheap but no one believes it.  Fonts have value but few are willing to pay for it. Thieves steal fonts and rationalize their actions by saying &ldquo;everyone does it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you have to teach a course in type design at every design school.  It should be enough to have a guest lecturer come once a year and give a presentation to the students.  I don&rsquo;t mean where someone comes in and just shows their finished work but where they actually present the process.  For a start, it might be nice to have a book written which might serve as a reference.  I know there are plenty of books on type out there but I don&rsquo;t know of any which would work for this purpose.  It may best work with a collection of type designers each doing a chapter.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine major media printing articles on type design. There would not be enough perceived interest from their audience.
Graphic Designers are the gate keepers to type.  We have to educate them and keep a dialogue going with them.  ( I guess that is why I talk to myself&ndash;I am both us and them.)</p>

<p>Actually, my master plan is to influence generations of students who have studied under me to &ldquo;buy into&rdquo; my theories of typography, and, years later, when they graduate and move into positions where they can influence type purchasing decisions, they will of course choose Shinn-o-fonts*, and I will be a wealthy retiree.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m teaching an undergraduate course in Type Design at Parsons. Last semester was the first offering and I&rsquo;m halfway through the second semester. In a 15 week semester a student is required to create a complete latin script font with a fairly extensive diacritical component that includes at least one OpenType feature. All of the students regardless of what their final font actually looks like come away with a very deep appreciation of the work type designers do.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the semester I told them that they had absolutely no idea how much work they were going to have to do in order to get the result I wanted. At first they didn&rsquo;t believe me, but as the mid-term came around and they saw how little they had accomplished in those first seven weeks, the panic was exquisite.</p>
<p>Every one finished (with a week or two extension) and some of the stuff is actually not bad. A few of them are polishing their designs up for some sort of commercial release.</p>
<p>I have told my chairman that I think the course should be a requirement. He agrees, but current limitations to the schedule make it something for the future.</p>

How much intrest is showng in your class? You have not had enough time for the &ldquo;word-of-mouth&rdquo; effect but I wonder if you will generate a broad base of interested students.  [Maybe that &ldquo;Font in 20 hours&rdquo; guy will take your course and show you how it is done:-)]</p>

I told them it should be a six credt course, but they only get 3. Latin script means latin script as opposed to cyrillic or arabic scripts. It is strongly recommended that they have taken Digital Lettering which is a sophomore elective that both Peter Bain and I teach, but it is not a pre-requisite. The ones that have taken the Digital Lettering do better than those who do not. The class size is limited to 15. Last semester I had 10, this semester there are 14.</div>

I went to design school in the 60&rsquo;s.  We developed &ldquo;alphabets&rdquo; using paint and brush. I can&rsquo;t say it was a complete typeface.  In those days, that would have been well over the 20-hour mark :-) We also did caligraphy and carved Roman capitals into hardened clay.  We even had a hot metal type shop put together by Jack Staufagher so typography was covered at least in the old-school way.</p>

<p>Got some connections at Time/Warner who want to blow the lid off this puppy?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very useful for design schools to offer this kind of class. James is on the front lines of keeping this awareness from becoming completely insular, invisible and irrelevant to the general public. Please don&rsquo;t belittle that work. If every design school required a type design class, it would have several effects including: All those design grads would come away with a personal experience of how valuable type is, and each of them would have had the opportunity to be exposed to something very obscure, which they might go on to explore more deeply. All those people are then equipped to negotiate fair compensation for type products, and are more likely to license them legally. Their experience can influence others in their studios. If that happens each year from 2005 on, we&rsquo;ll be on our way to some more general awareness.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t say we shouldn&rsquo;t have mass media paying attention to type; see my previous post. But everyone is in a different position to have an influence. I also think there&rsquo;s a limit to the completeness of any message delivered to the average reader through general media. How can we be sure the complete message will make it through the editorial mill? Would an editor at a major magazine be willing to devote pages and pages to digital typefounding if Paris Hilton had just thrown a candy wrapper away? Cut that boring type story and put Paris on Page 1! Get me photos!</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ve all joked about reality type shows, but joking aside, is there a channel or network that might be interested in a 43-minute doc about the process of making a typeface? Is there a documentary filmmaker who thinks it&rsquo;s worth pursuing? Imagine a camera crew following Christian Schwartz around to press checks and design meetings, and watching laser proofs come out. Exciting stuff! Matthew Carter has compared it to watching a refrigerator make ice. Could it be made watchable?</p>

<p>If there&rsquo;s one thing that&rsquo;s almost impossible to do, it&rsquo;s to teach Visigoths to just BE CAREFUL. And clients &ndash; JUST PAY FOR WHAT YOU WANT. I think I told the story here already about my bid on a logo design for a fairly large St. Louis company.

<p>A common underlying theme thoughout all of this discussion is the new(ish), digital nature of type design and font construction. The digital age has done similar things to music and graphic design.</p>
<p>It is not just pirating, but the fact that our raw materials are not so raw anymore. Programmers use code snippets, musicians use samples and sound bites, graphic designers use clipart (and free fonts). Yes the work is completed quicker, but that has become the expectation as well, and the perceived value is also lower. &ldquo;You just push some buttons and it&rsquo;s done - right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The craft of these things is being slowly (actually, quickly) eroded in favour of speed of deployment and just-in-time delivery.</p>

<p>LOL!!!  No Chuck, I haven&rsquo;t been to East St Louis in 25 years.  I was on a press check there long ago.  The printing plant had 2 rows of barbed wire fence with nasty looking Dobermans standing guard between them.  I didn&rsquo;t wander off in to any neighborhood bars.

It means anything that pushes the bar up, and makes a older designer have to admit they never understood exactly why the Univers and Helvetica people couldn&rsquo;t just agree. It means not discriminating against handlettering and calligraphy, when taught and practiced at a sophisticated level, because they can imprint history, form and sensitivity without having to make typefaces.
