    EULAs that would prevent such manipulation in the use of a font. \r\n\r\nRemember
    that EULAs are software license agreements. What EULAs restrict is modification
    of the font <em>data</em>, not affecting display of the unmodified font data using
    asymmetric scaling or something like Photoshop filters."

    Was he quoting from a EULA, or being sloppy in his choice of words? EULAs are
    legal documents, so they tend to be very specific in their choice of wording and
    typically say something like 'You may not modify the font data'.\r\n\r\nIf an
    application is able to take the transformed <em>output</em> of a font and produce
    from that a new font, that wouldn't be violating the EULA prohibition against
    modifying the licensed font data, but depending on how the process worked it might
    violate other terms of the EULA regarding creation of derivative works. For example,
    if the process involved converting to outlines and then writing those outlines
    to a font file, that would seem to me pretty obviously a derivative work -- akin
    to the process that SSi used when producing derivatives of Adobe fonts --, whereas
    tracing the results of a Photoshop filter applied to text might not.\r\n\r\nNone
    of this is a grey as you want to make it."

    - but that, being less convenient, won't lose them sales of condensed versions
    of the font as separate products, they may feel.</cite>\r\n\r\nBad example. For
    example, using InDesign, just do the condensing once in the \"Basic Paragraph
    Style,\" and base your other styles on that. However, beyond a small percentage,
    good condensing is usually more than just a mathematical formula. Try it & see.
    \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are some fonts where I think a 1% to 2% condensing
    actually improves the font. Arnhem Blond comes to mind, when used for books rather
    than the newspaper work for which it was originally designed (wonderful font,
    by the way). \r\n\r\nEven more -- if you need a new character, just start your
    own \"supplemental characters\" font, and sub them in with a grep search (with
    InDesign, anyway). The only issue is kerning, so get the side bearings right.
    Remember, in the States at least, a *design* cannot be protected by copyright,
    only data. I suppose you could even sell the supplemental character set in the
    States, under a different font name.. You might have to  have to prove you didn't
    copy the data from the original. Just keep the backgrounded character,  tracing,
    & refining you made. Whether or not it is ethical would be another question. Personally,
    I'd find such sales unethical.\r\n\r\nAbout the only thing you can't do with an
    applications program is increase the weight of the glyphs in a font. But it wouldn't
    be impossible to add that feature ... \r\n\r\nBest would be for the EULAs to aim
    at anti-piracy rather than restricting an end-user from doing work. The font publisher
    is entitled to be paid for their work. However, in my opinion, that principle
    should not stop a user of type from accomplishing <cite>their</cite> work."

  body: This brings up the whole subject of copyright in the world of fonts. It strikes
    me that no other art treads quite as fine a line between originality and infringement
    as type design does. After all, how different ways can you make an uppercase A
    before it is unrecognizable as an uppercase A.  Yes I know there are tens of thousands
    of different designs for the majuscule A, but I believe you all know what I'm
    getting at.  This issue becomes even more difficult when you get into specific
    genres, like grotesque sans.

    There was a guy, a writer, who got a patent on \"the .300 Jamison.\" It was not

    Mr. Jamison ever thought of it. But he got the patent, and threatened to sue Winchester
    & Browning for some of their later cartridge developments. They settled out of
    court. Had they chosen to fight it, any number of us could have shown reamer prints
    (the reamer is what is used to cut the rifle chamber) predating Mr. Jamison's
    work. Winchester et al.  just figured it was cheaper to settle.\r\n\r\nNow consider

    of when they hear the word is the kind of patent that applies to an invention,

    Patents. Typefaces, and other forms of applied design, may be registered as <a
    href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_patent\">Design Patents</a>, which
    is a different class of patent. It is quite specific and, as has been noted above,
    the very first design patent was granted to a typeface design, 170 years ago.
    One of the ways in which design patents are different from invention patents is
    that they are granted for a shorter limited term: 14 years from the date of filing.\r\n\r\nOther
    countries have similar provisions for design works, usually for similar periods
    of time, but use different terms. In Canada, the equivalent is a registered Industrial
    Design. So don't be confused by the term patent in US law and don't jump to the
    conclusion that it is silly without understanding the nature of design patents

    i.e. a design does not need to be unique, novel or groundbreaking in order to
    qualify. Remember, what a design patent protects is the exploitable value of a
    particular work, and the fact that there are people who want to use Adobe Garamond
    in preference to Stempel Garamond (or Simoncini Garamond or Sabon or, for that
    matter, Adobe's Garamond Premier Pro) means that it has particular exploitable
    value and, hence, warrants the particular kind of limited protection offered by
    design patent. Doesn't that make sense to you? If a design is distinctive enough
    to be individually valued and desirable, then there is something in it that warrants
    protection.\r\n\r\nThe process of registering a design patent requires identification
    of 'prior art', i.e. existing works either explicitly referenced in the filed
    design or influencing it in some way. So I'm pretty sure that when Adobe registered
    Adobe Garamond they identified, as a minimum, Claude Garamond's original types,
    and quite possibly some other revivals if they had influenced the design. But
    the patent registrars -- just like you and me -- can see the differences between
    Adobe Garamond and other revivals in the marketplace, and those differences give
    it particular exploitable value. It is a distinct design within the criteria under
    which the US Patent and Trademark Office has been registering typeface designs
    for 170 years."
