  body: Hi Hrant <BR> <BR>oh yes the spacing is always a problem for me. Hope I can
    manage it some day... <BR> <BR>There are lot  of thinks to do. The Caps are in
    a little different style. So i have to copy it from the lower case. Spacing and
    Kerning &#40;Why did I hate it so much?&#41; and complete the uppercase. <BR>

  body: You probably hate it because you don&#39;t feel like you have total control?
    But none of us do - that&#39;s the nature of the beast. Even if you have solid
    methods in place, you just have to know/decide how far to take it, then stop.

  body: About spacing, from your sample, it looks as if the spacing is uniformly wide.
    Maybe you could set a block in Illustrator &#40;or your favorite layout tool&#41;
    and decrease the letterspacing until you find something that feels right. Then
    you have a good sample to improve on. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve found it useful to browse
    around my font collection in FontLab and see how others have solved the spacing
    problem. Finding a font with similar proportions could be a good source of ideas
    for spacing. I haven&#39;t tried to tackle kerning yet myself &#40;still learning&#41;
    but I&#39;m not looking forward to it. <BR> <BR>When you say you&#39;re going
    to change the caps, do you mean you&#39;re going to give them the same slanted
    axis as the lowercase? I like how the strokes of the upper case <b>K</b>, <b>P</b>,
    and <b>R</b> don&#39;t close all the way. Try not to lose that idea when you fix
    the upper case. <BR> <BR>This looks great so far. I&#39;m interested to see what
    the rest of the upper case looks like.

    Maybe i gone to far. What do you think abot the way of Walter Tracys spacing &#40;Letters
    of Credits&#41;? Id tryed it in early font whith this method.  <BR>  <BR>Are there
    any other methods? <BR> <BR>BTW: I wont change the stroke of the K, P and R it
    still doesnt close... I will take the slanted axis from the lower case and assig
    it to the upper. Until yet it looks greet... you will see it, end of the week.'

  body: Text fonts benefit from being -or actually seeming- slightly too tight. <BR>
    <BR>Tracy&#39;s method is a great foundation, but it won&#39;t take you to the
    end. When you reach its limits, you either continue by using the eye, or you create
    more complex rules of quantification &#40;which is what I do, like I give spacing
    values to serifs&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: I like it &#40;I DO love long-tailed Qs&#41;. <BR>This spacing issue is pretty
    personal. Many people approach it in different ways. <BR>I can just tell you that
    I experienced the same with a typeface I&#39;m working on since 1996. <BR>I did
    the spacing too loose because I wanted to give &#34;air&#34; but in the end I
    realized that if you needed a tighter textsetting you ended up with irregular
    results. <BR>So I discarded the whole kerning table and I began the spacing anew,
    from scratch, starting with the O and the |, the vertical bar &#40;In the beginning
    I don&#39;t use the I or the H in serif designs for the reason mentioned by Hrant&#41;.
    <BR>In such way I realized that doing the face with a tighter spacing I was able
    to control kerning very well. And I realized also that the user could increase
    the space as he/she wishes in a tighter design with good metrics, while he/she
    cannot do the opposite in a looser design with bad metrics. <BR>A starting point
    could be an automatic reduction of sidebearings. Then you&#39;ll correct the flaws.

  body: Always start spacing with lowercase letters. Uppercase letters need to be
    more widely spaced relative to each other than lowercase letters do, so they&#39;re
    a bad place to start spacing a text face. For a text face, the best way to proceed
    is to start with a row of lowercase nnnnnnn&#39;s. Fiddle with the sidebearings
    &#40;with a little less space on the right than on the left, to account for the
    curve&#41; until you have something close to an optical balance between the internal
    white space of the n and the amount of white space between the letters. That will
    give you a standard against which to judge the rest of the spacing. <BR> <BR>In
    a text face, uppercase letters need to be spaced to precede lowercase letters
    without requiring too much kerning. This is where Walter Tracy ceases to be helpful;
    his explanation of spacing uppercase letters only works for cap-only display faces.
    <BR> <BR>Years ago, before spacing became ingrained in my brain, I spent a long
    time measuring the relationship of sidebearings to internal white space in my
    favourite typefaces. I recommend this, since it is the best way to understand
    the principles.

    a point much like the &#34;K&#34; and &#34;R&#34; do.

  body: The first thing you do after you visually space with control strings is tighter
    the x-height rounds. The reason is that text has certain letter frequencies, it&#39;s
    not a bunch of control strings! <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: As I have said. Typeface spacing is something like a metaphor of life. Everyone
    needs to live his own, and learn from previous experience. <BR>So Jens, I guess
    it will be better for you to take our suggestions just as a starting point.

  body: I will try to take your suggestions and look what will happen. Until now I
    learnd just designing the character. Because of my late typedesign love I dont
    learned the spacing of chars. My study was a special multimedia topic. So no calligraphy
    and not much typographie. At the I learned typedesign in a very unusual way. The
    guy from whom i learned, also made the spacing wider, and he had a position in
    wich I not really believe. He doesnt use any kerning pairs. I guess this position
    is a little to extrem. But as better the spacing as fewer kerning pairs ar needed.
    Isnt it? <BR> <BR>Currently I am trying a tighter spacing. For the reason that
    i dont lost the mood I made some small caps. <BR> <BR>Are there any tips for the
    chracters? Other Flavors? This would help me also. <BR> <BR>Greetings Jens <BR>

    <BR> <BR>One year later, Insekt become much more clssic stlyes. I imrpoved allmost
    everything. The Glyphes are nearly complet and I added SmallCaps. <BR>Some Glyphes
    are a little experimental. The UC R goes a little different way, take a look.
    Very experimental is the UpperCase &#39;'
