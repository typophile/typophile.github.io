  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I know some of the folks at Punchcut thought it was lame but I really miss being able to IM my fellow typophiles. I made some friends that way - a casual IM conversation turned into more in-depth dialogue. A lot of typophilers don&rsquo;t post their contact info so it was a good way to break the ice. Also a nice way to show support for someone, thank a buddy for their support, say hi where have you been, what&rsquo;s up, here&rsquo;s a funny link, check out this thread, etc. without clogging up your email inbox. People that don&rsquo;t want to use the feature don&rsquo;t have to.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m alone in wanting IMs back - if others agree, please add your names to this thread and maybe we can start a groundswell&hellip;</p>

<p>What is wrong with using any of the handful of exceptional and free IM clients available? Services like AIM, Messenger, GTalk, etc… are all perfectly suited for the out-of-forum conversations, much more so than what our system is able to provide.</p>

How do you do that if their contact info isn&rsquo;t readily available? It&rsquo;s also more work than a quick zap, and can be more intrusive than email.</p>
<p>Dan&rsquo;s is only one opinion (and interestingly the only one you responded to) and there are many others above that differ. Plus this thread has only been up for two hours. I never felt &ldquo;harassed&rdquo; by an IM and I replied when I had the time.</p>
<p>No, the IM feature wasn&rsquo;t ideal as it was, but it was a feature that some of us really used and as I said above, it was the starting point for some friendships I&rsquo;ve developed on this forum. I wish you&rsquo;d reconsider.</p>

Thanks. Not much around here needs to happen &ldquo;instantly&rdquo;, which confused it with things that do. I very much like the typophile that allows one to interact, or ignore. It leads to much more friendly pace and self control for most.</p>

<p>One always had the choice to permit IMs or not.</p>
<p>Another option, just as good, would just be to have the choice to e-mail a person through Typophile, if that person opted to receive such e-mails. That also used to be possible.</p>

<p>Today, I had a &ldquo;need&rdquo; to contact any moderator I could find. There is no &ldquo;CONTACT&rdquo; to press and relay my message. Folks like Miss Tiffany do not have in their &ldquo;User IDs&rdquo; an email address or a website to go find a way to contact her.</p>
<p>I met Miss Patty and Miss Linda through I/Ms when I lost my dog. I will never forget how comforting it was to have others understand what I was going through.</p>
<p>I vote for IMs back.</p>
<p>I also would like to see any easier way of contacting folks that matter.</p>
<p>Thank you Patty for starting this thread.</p>

<p>No, it wasn&rsquo;t perfect, but it beats the heck out of not having it at all &ndash; not everyone has AIM (et al) because of office firewalls, slow connections, etc.</p>
<p>And the contact email system only works if people actually think to turn it on (it isn&rsquo;t on by default, which would make things much easier).</p>

<p>this is essentially the same reason why i think that it&rsquo;s better not to have IM on the site. because you don&rsquo;t always want unsolicited IMs. it&rsquo;s my choice to give my aim/yahoo/msn/google screennames to somebody if i so desire.</p>

<p>Then you could just opt out in the information in your account, no? So having this function would give it to those who want it, and those who don&rsquo;t opt out. I don&rsquo;t see what is lost. How much time it would take to get this functional is another story. With me it wouldn&rsquo;t be a high priority.</p>
<p>FWIW, while the IMs were enabled, I never received any IMs from anybody but Typophiles.</p>

<p>There is clearly no way that I can retort to others' personal stories of how they made great personal connections over the IM feature. Typophile is nothing but a series of great personal connections, really, at least in my opinion. Nevertheless, I never liked the IM feature at all. I had nothing to do with its disappearance. I think that some of the things that people want from it might be better served through other channels on this (or other sites).</p>
<p>Part of this comes from my distaste for Instant Messaging in general, and I&rsquo;ll freely admit that. But I still can&rsquo;t warm up to the idea of Typophile IMs. I&rsquo;ve always found it quite rude to not respond to IMs immediately. They are instant you know. The worst thing was logging into to typophile after I had been away for a few hours, and seeing that several people had thought that I was online, even though I really wasn&rsquo;t. They had sent me things or questions, which unfortunately I wasn&rsquo;t around to answer. Now, this never happens anymore and I love the peice of mind.</p>
<p>I love getting e-mails because they are quick, but not instant. I try to answer everybody&rsquo;s e-mails as soon as possible, and am always happy to receive e-mails via my Typophile contact page. It beats most of the other mail I get during the day hands down…</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Patty et al., I&rsquo;m really glad to hear this kind of feature request and I&rsquo;m sorry the IM feature is missed&hellip; As much as it pains me to admit; the reasons were purely technical. An IM feature is not a flawed idea, but it was a flawed piece of code (and in our view, fatally so).</p>
<p>As you might be aware, the IM component was a piece of open source code (a Drupal module for the PHP inclined among you) that never quite functioned as it should have. Messages were not stored by the database and neither were the responses. If you dismissed a note it was gone forever. In that sense it was fleeting at best, unreliable and misleading at its worst. Moderators had no way of tracking responses, users had no way of knowing if a message was received. It was interruptive (in your face), when it should&rsquo;ve been passive.</p>
<p>The second major problem was if you wanted to leave the IM there, so you could eventually respond to it at your leisure. To Mili&rsquo;s point, this implementation had no inbox or save option. It meant getting duplicate messages every time you hit a new page. The result was a nice feature, poorly executed.</p>
<p>But, the nail in the coffin for <em>this implementation</em> of an IM feature was that it would&rsquo;ve required more work to re-implement this feature that was not supported by the Drupal upgrade. We did not believe the benefit lived up to the level of effort required.</p>
<p>Finally, I would clarify Zara&rsquo;s comment this way. That unless the IM module gets significant improvement we won&rsquo;t be brining this implementation back. We are very interested in finding ways to further people&rsquo;s ability to make connections, foster community and be networked. We&rsquo;re investigating ways to enhance each person&rsquo;s profile page to become a &ldquo;wall&rdquo; of sorts for public and private kinds of messaging in addition to the contact, blogging, bio and links already afforded there.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>On email notification</strong></p>
<p>William, you can let others contact you without publicly posting your email address.</p>
<p>To turn on private &ldquo;email notification&rdquo;:</p>
<ul>
<li>Going to your profile by clicking on your name,</li>
<li>Click edit,</li>
<li>Scroll to the bottom,</li>
<li>Under &ldquo;Contact Settings&rdquo; turn on the checkbox.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can contact anybody who has opted in to this feature:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the users' name.</li>
<li>Click the &ldquo;Contact&rdquo; tab,</li>
<li>Type your subject and message and hit send.</li>
<li>You can even copy yourself so you have a record of the email.</li>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Joe,</p>
<p>Thanks for the clarification. I now see that this was not an arbitrary or presumptuous decision but a feature that became too complicated to implement.</p>
<p>I agree that it didn&rsquo;t quite work as it should have but I do miss it and hope that there might be another way to enable easy communication between typophiles. That&rsquo;s the main loss for me, it was a really nice way to reach out and say hey and in some cases did lead to real dialogues with other users. I hate to lose that. I suppose we&rsquo;ll get used to the email contact option, it is a bit more involved.</p>
<p>How does the email notification work - does it just go to your regular email inbox? Or is there something set up at typophile to receive comments or messages? That would seem ideal, to keep it within the forum rather than needing to switch to another application.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think an &ldquo;opt-out&rdquo; feature in any potential future version of IMs should satisfy those who consider them intrusive. They are not nearly as intrusive as iChat - tho iChat does allow you to make yourself Unavailable or Away if you&rsquo;re busy or on the phone.</p>
<p>Another idea would be a feature that let you start a chat room within the site, which I know a lot of forums do have. I know a married couple who met thru such a feature on a Formula One forum.</p>
<p>I liked the IMs because, like emails, they didn&rsquo;t (to me) demand an instant reply, despite the name. I also have typophile open on my browser most of the time and frequently didn&rsquo;t notice an IM until hours later, when the person had already logged off. I don&rsquo;t think any feelings were bruised if the reply wasn&rsquo;t instant. People are busy.</p>

<p>Chuck - I agree the site isn&rsquo;t as much fun. But regarding the IMs at least Joe did me/us the courtesy of explaining why rather than just saying it wasn&rsquo;t gonna happen. I hope that this thread will help make our case.</p>
