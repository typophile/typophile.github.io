body: "Hi All,\r\n\r\nI'm creating some collateral material for a series of resorts.
  The parent company has a style guide that indicates using Avenir and New Aster.
  Since the pieces will be printed in the field and by people with no design experience
  I have to use MicroSoft Word and I am limited to the fonts bundled with that program.
  A buyout is occurring so perhaps in the future the parent company will purchase
  the needed fonts, however at the moment I am stuck and on a tight deadline. Would
  someone please point me in the direction of a good site that will help me compare
  and contrast typefaces so I can select a suitable replacement or even better can
  some of the Typophile experts make some suggestions? I would greatly appreciate
  your help.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nK"

    be a suitable alternative for Avenir but I still need help with New Aster, again
    I need to stick with MicroSoft Word bundled fonts, any suggestions?\r\n-K"
