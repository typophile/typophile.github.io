  on these:\r\nthe kerning seems to leave the type like broken tombstones in long
  forgotten graveyard..\r\n\r\n[[http://www.light-bikes.de/website/new/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/cipo2.jpg]]\r\n\r\n[[http://www.roadcycling.com/artman/uploads/lightweight_1_002.jpg]]\r\n\r\n[[http://www.zweiradpool.de/u/53aPic1B23508168_zz_LightweightStandardIII.jpg]]\r\n\r\n\r\n(myself;
  i think it's completely dreadful, unique but terrible)\r\n\r\n\r\nit seems to me
  they are trying to go hand drawn script but they don't really know where to start.
  so they chose something 'scripty' and 'typed it in'\r\n\r\n[[http://bikerepairman.com/campagnolo_logo.gif]]\r\n\r\n[[http://home.pacbell.net/trh-arch/alfa/script.jpg]]\r\n\r\n\r\noh
  and these are not cheap wheels either."

  body: "Hi,\r\nI am a big cyclist myself and as much as i would want to have a pair
    of Lightweights, this branding with Apple Chancery would make me so slow. A shame
    because these wheels cost a fortune (for the prize of one pair you would get a
    good complete bike). As for Campagnolo: this is a rather old logo and not a retro
    one. This was the style in the Fifties. But Lightweight is poor. It tries to mimick
    the grandness and reputation of brands and products like Campagnolo. The \u203ALighties\u2039
    at current state are the best wheels you can have. But the wordmark really looks
    like a cheap inscription on a cheap tombstone, i agree. And it is not unique at
    all. Why? It is just typed Apple Chancery with loose spacing. The outcome of an
    engineer who knows how to build high-performance wheels and who therefor thinks
    he can make a good logo, too. As a matter of fact, many many professional cycling
    teams are equipped with those wheels, so success is on his side."

    this logotype.\r\n\u2019clueless german rubbish\u2019: well; it is a German company
    after all ;-) They will soon discover DIN for themselves. Black letter, only if
    they want to address the young and cool kids. But they can\u2019t afford those
    wheels."
