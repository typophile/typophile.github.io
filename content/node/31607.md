    and Univers, if my memory serves. And the name is something Gothic."

    i doubt it's custom made.

  body: I'm surprised that no one seems to know it - it must have been a rare face
    in the 70s. I actually start doubting that it has been digitised... Any I.D. suggestion
    welcome!

  body: There are still a lot of film and metal types that haven't yet been digitized.
    Many foundries made their own versions of Helvetica and other popular faces and
    they aren't all well known.

  body: Yes Stephen, I'm pretty sure it goes in this category. Knowing the name of
    it though would help me tracking it down in specimen books etc.

  body: "There was an ATF typeface called Lining Gothic (shown in Jaspert's \"Encyclopaedia
    of Type Faces\") that seems very similar. In fact, there were a large variety
    of Grotesques/Gothics with numbers which seem to include many that are at least
    similar. Each foundry had their own 'flavors' of these sans serif workhorses,
    and film types had a spectrum of widths and weights and stylistic variations,
    which could be further varied by using lenses. I think this may be very hard to
    pin down exactly.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Thanks Mike + 1985. Good stuff. That C/F/F book looks like a gem! The font
    looks very similar indeed to the one on my book. (Line gothic?) In fact, my book
    might even be designed by C/F/F which would suggest that they did custom make
    it but then use it on some other jobs too. I took a copy from the cover in a library
    so can't look it up now. Intresting lead though indeed...

    in the book they call the outcome Airport.\r\n\r\nThe lowercase 'r' is really
    nice but some of the other characters such as the lc 'y' seem very black. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Airport_4630.jpg]\r\n\r\nHere
    is a quick photo (apologies for quality) showing how they changed  the characters
    of Standard bold. The bottom three show how they arrived at the weight of the
    letters somewhere between Standard medium and Standard bold.\r\n\r\nGreat book\r\n\r\n:)"

    you might call it) on Matthew Carter (you know, Snell Roundhand, Charter, Galliard,
    Tahoma, Verdana, Georgia...) and I saw this thread just now... well, he designed
    a typeface in 1970 that was to be used on the \u2013 at the time \u2013 new terminal
    of Heathrow Airport. I've never actually seen it, but the timing makes sense and
    the influences of the design too. They didn't actually name it, but I've seen
    sources where people refer to it as Airport.\r\n\r\nIf I'm not mistaken, it was
    never produced as a usable font, not even then... I remember reading it was pasted
    up on the signage from Photostats, although I don't even really know what those
    are.\r\n\r\n\r\nruD"
