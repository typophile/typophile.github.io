  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Here's the scoop. This logo is for a client that was a city codes inspector for 28 years, retired, and started her own property management business. After many sketches the thought of a child building a structure using wooden blocks came to mind. Watching a child play with wooden blocks for me just said "property management" (blocks being the property and its arrangement by the child being the management part). I went with this idea because I feel people would identify easily with this concept.

I used blocks stacked one ontop of another and placed one block away from the arranged group. I thought this would be a chance to illicit audience "participation". My hope is that someone would look at this card and subconsciously put the stray block in it's place, thus, getting a sense of what my client does, manage property.

The font I used is Warnock Pro. I'm still debating on whether to go sans (Scala Sans, can't show examples because I've yet to purchase the font) or serif. I just feel the serif would have a more humanistic feel to it (besides I think sans' are being used way too much for logo work). The color I used is pure cyan which I thought would be a good choice when newspaper advertising come into play to avoid registration problems but I might go with another color.

This logo is still in its early stages. But I would really appreciate feedback before I begin the refinement process.

Thanks

Secondly, good concept. I’d explore the execution of it a bit further. Stacked building blocks is quite a clichéed device.

This shouldn’t be a factor. You should go with your instinct of what you feel is appropriate.</div>

Thanks for the spell-check. I was doing it pretty quickly and I'm a horrible speller and typist. But I am a good proofreader when given enough time.

<cite>Stacked building blocks is quite a clichéed device.</cite>

In away I agree, but I chose this one as an alternative to an even more used cliché; a house. I'll definitely explore it more (ideas are flowing as I type).

Thanks for the feedback. Keep it coming!

Some of your locations for it looks like it was just a left over... and doesn't fit. At least this is my opinion... maybe not others.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hey Heron20001
I do agree 100% with your comment. It was not my intention to turn the stray block into a bullet but now that you mention it I guess it does look like one. And as far as locations for the stray block goes I also agree that it doesn't fit. But I still feel having a stray block is necessary. I want to convey the feeling of a need for organization. I'll have multiple revisions (keeping these suggestions in mind) to show soon. Thanks a million!

		<div class="commentbody">I'm in no way a professional designer, but I love the Warnock. It's unexpected for a logo that represents a former code inspector. I also like the light blue "Burns Glover" of letter d. But I think you should flip the 3 cube logo 90 degrees clockwise so with the missing piece, it resembles a lower-case b (I suppose it would look like an upper-case L too, but I would associate it with a b since the company is "Burns..."). Lastly, I think the tagline would read better if it were "Over 25 Years of City Codes Experience."

But I like it a lot!

Also, <cite>city-codes</cite> is a compound modifier, which requires a hyphen. However, since that might look ugly, you might want to rephrase it:

<cite>28 years of experience with city codes</cite>

Or, if you'd like to avoid starting a line with numerals:

<cite>twenty-eight years of experience with city codes</cite></div>
