  trying to identify the monospaced typeface used in the words 'Australien' and 'Sydamerkia'
  in the images attached. The images are of a map found in a Swedish encyclopaedia
  published in the 1950's called Kunskapens Bok."

  body: "You will note that I did not include any typewriter fonts, despite the fact
    that they are generally monoline. This is becasue they are also monospace, which
    means that letters like _M_ are compressed to a standard width and letters like
    _I_ have very expanded serifs.\r\nHowever, there are a few proportionate spaced
    fonts with typewriter style letterforms, such as URW Typewriter Light [img:sites/default/files/old-images/URWTypewriterLightAsSYD_3898.gif]
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/typewriter/\r\n\r\nAs a final comment I should
    note that before the last decades of the 20th century lettering on most maps was
    engraved or lithographed, or hand lettered and photo reduced, rather than taken
    directly from a font. Note that the map states \"litografiska.\"\r\n\r\nNone of
    the fonts I suggested is a perfect match to the lettering.\r\n\r\nDon"
