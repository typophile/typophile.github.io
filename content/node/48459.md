  for awhile now. I was helping a friend with a design project and some of their imagery
  reminded me of the font used on the Smashing Pumpkins album \"Mellon Collie and
  the Infinite Sadness.\" I've seen this font listed as PS Bluegum Forest as well
  as Burton's Nightmare. I remember loving the font at the time, and then slowly getting
  sick of it as I saw it used and overused.\r\n\r\nHowever, looking at it again, I
  still feel like it is an interesting design and was curious to know more about it.
  Does anyone know about the origins/background of this font?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n-M"

    href=\"http://www.p22.com/products/victorian.html\" target=\"_blank\">P22 Victorian
    Swash</a>'.\r\n\r\n<em>P22 type foundry presents a font set created in conjunction
    with the Albright-Knox Art Gallery's exhibition of Victorian-era French artist
    James Tissot. The fonts developed for the P22 Victorian set are based on historic
    typefaces dating from the late 19th century. Victorian Gothic was based on a type
    style called 'Atlanta', a simple, expanded width, quirky, yet elegant face similar
    to 'Copperplate'. Victorian Swash was inspired by the willowy, delicate face 'Columbian',
    which has also been known in recent years as 'Glorietta'. The P22 version includes
    'snap-on' flourishes based on the original 'Columbian' ornamental embellishment
    designs. Victorian Ornaments, features over 150 decorative embellishments.</em>\r\n\r\nDav"
