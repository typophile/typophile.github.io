  body: Concur with Kevin on Univers for 1st sample only. 2nd one is another font
    and which, at first inspection, is very close to Akzidenz-Grotesk (main difference
    being "Helvetica-ish" /R). May be [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/ag-book-bq|AG
    Book]]?

  body: You are quite right, my bad. And the Q was such a good match, too. That's
    the problem with identifying this--easy to find parts that match something, but
    not the whole....

  body: "aq54, if the font is by a smaller type foundry (i.e., not one catalogued
    by Whatfontis or Myfonts), the chances of accurately identifying it are slim.
    \r\n\r\nSorry if you're frustrated, but we volunteer our time here and don't guarantee
    results. \r\n\r\nIf you can provide more details about the sample (country of
    origin, date), that may help us zero in on the foundry."
