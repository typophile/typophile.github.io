  would create fractions in font lab. I'm not talking about drawing the glyphs but
  the opentype needed in the opentype panel.\r\n\r\n\r\nttmt."

  body: "Thanks for the link Nick\r\n\r\nThat looks like a very comprehensive example
    of code to create fractions but there is no explanation of how it works. I'd like
    to understand what I was doing if I used this code. Is there another method with
    an explanation or could anyone explain how the Tal's code works.\r\n\r\nttmt"
