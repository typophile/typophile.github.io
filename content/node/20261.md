  designer Hans Eduard Meier created a typeface for the use in primary schools called
  ABC-Schrift. It is a \u201Ccontinental\u201D typeface which is closer to printing
  typefaces than the former typeface after which Swiss pupils had to learn to write.\r\n\r\nThe
  typeface and instructions to it can be seen at <a href=\"www.Schulschrift.ch\">Scriben
  lernen</a> (German) and is available from <a href=\"http://www.elsner-flake.de\">Elsner+Flake</a>.\r\n\r\nThe
  new primary school typeface is successfully in use in several cantons of Switzerland.
  Its informal approach provides that pupils achieve a more individual handwriting.
  Furthermore it is much more modern than the former so called \u201CSchn\xFCrlischrift\u201D
  which is still in use in some Swiss cantons. It makes it easier to learn to read
  and write because it is closer to printing typefaces pupils are confronted with
  in day-to-day life.\r\n\r\n<strong>Other Resources:</strong>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=ABC\">ABC-Schrift
