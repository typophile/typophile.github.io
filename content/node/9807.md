  body: Very good eye, Dav!  It never fails to amaze me how some of these obscure
    faces can look so fresh when someone puts it to good use &#40;and in a much larger
    size&#41;.  <BR> <BR>How did you spot this one?

  body: Interesting to notice that they flipped the second &#39;z&#39; in Pizza to
    make it look more hand-drawn. I like that font. If only I could think of a good
    use for it. T-26 has some nice, quirky script faces that always seem like a surpirse
    when they show up somewhere. <BR> <BR>I must not have much to do this morning...
    pardon the rambling on a closed thread.
