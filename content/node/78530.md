  embellishments\" to my interface. The fonts are not embedded as \"fonts\", they
  are integrated into the visual aspect of my designs.\r\n\r\nI have fonts that are
  commercial use fonts, providing the standard \"...for Personal or Internal Use...\"
  statement, however it leaves out the real \"clarity\". As I am using these fonts
  \"in house\" on my own computer when developing my software I assume my usage is
  covered under the standard \"Commercial\" EULA, but if anyone can shed some light
  and help to clarify the murky waters I'd appreciate it.\r\n\r\nTim"

    itself merely renders artifacts within your designs. You're cool...
