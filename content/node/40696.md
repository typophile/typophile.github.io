body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nCan anyone help me with the name of the font in the image below.
  It should be fairly simple. They use it often in party flyers and it looks very
  similar to arial narrow.\r\n\r\nThe font I'm looking for is the one used in the
  names (on a black background - i realise the font does not come with this background)
  towards the middle of the page e.g. \r\nShannon, LilPhil, Pascal etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/n898395187_1666681_8957_3960.jpg]"

  body: "<cite>and they all wanna charge for it </cite>\r\nWell, I guess this is just
    how the market works: people create stuff (and spend some \u2013 i.e. a lot of
    \u2013 time, energy and knowledge on it), and then they charge for it.\r\nA quick
    search revealed you can have a black narrow Helvetica for as little as $24 (depending
    on the exact format, glyph coverage, foundry/retailer, etc.). Nimbus Sans Novus
    (a Helvetica version by URW) is even cheaper; $19.95 per weight. Valid license
    for a lifetime."
