body: I can&#39;t place this one...it&#39;s a scan off an embroidered cap that I need
  to recreate, so some of the finer details may not match an existing font, but the
  general shapes should be recognizable<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/4356.jpg"

  body: The shapes seem a little on this side of awkward to be a typeface. Engravers
    Old English or Old English at <a href="http://myfonts.com/" target="_blank"> myfonts</a>
    are close, but not quite. The &#39;O&#39; strikes me as being part of another
    character. But again, Butler might have a match for you.

    been made into a ligature.

  body: you could re-draw it from Engravers Old or Caslon Text Series, same structure
    for Caps. <BR> <BR>that&#39;s an o? looked like a u to me. wotever it is its looks
    bastardized, over and over again. Blackletter&#39;s with outlines?

  body: That &#39;U&#39; would look more like a &#39;U&#39; &#40;for me anyway&#41;
    if the final vertical stroke were flopped thus visually leaving more of a &#39;U&#39;
    shape.  <BR> <BR>Just thoughts.
