body: I'm new to the font making world and do it as a hobby. I'm looking to purchase
  a font editor and TypeTool seems to be a good option but I'm wondering if I will
  be able to create a font using TypeTool that uses pairs and triples. The typeface
  Im creating contains certain a few versions of certain characters so they can combined
  with other characters. For instance AV. I want to know if it can do this before
  I purchase.

    can draw your pair and triplet ligature glyphs in TypeTool 3, and use Microsoft
    VOLT or Adobe FDK for OpenType (both free) to add OpenType Layout feature definition
    code that takes care of ligature substitution in OpenType-savvy applications.

    body: "I know that you can do kerning pairs in TT but what I'm asking is if I
      can create a font that is smart enough to know when to use certain characters.
      \r\n\r\nFor example, the typeface I'm creating has two different versions of
      \"A\" and three versions of Y. I've attached a JPG of the typeface so you can
      reference it.\r\n\r\nNow, lets say I'm type the word WAYS, I want it to be able
      to recognize that combo of characters and use the correct A and Y so that they
      seem to \"fit\" together. I also want it to use different versions of the letters
      depending on which character procedes it or follows it.\r\n\r\nIs this possible?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typeface_4069.jpg]"

  body: "Very cool!\r\nYes. It's possible using conditional substitutions. You are
    going to have to work out the tables very well to anticipate all the possible
    combinations. You can download VOLT from Microsoft's site. The FDK has a higher
    learning curve. Look around on Microsoft's typography site. You'll find a lot
    of information."
