  As English is only my third language I&#39;d greatly  <BR>appreciate it you drop
  me a line if you happen to come  <BR>across typos, spelling mistakes or simply bad
  grammar. THX.

  body: English is your third language and you write this well? Sure, go ahead, put
    the American educational system to shame even more than it already is...

  body: Yves,  <BR>I think you did a great job of sounding informative, friendly and
    humorous all at the same time. The English is perfect.  <BR> <BR>One thing I can
    suggest is that it would also be good to have them tell us whatever they know
    about the backgound of the sample  that might be useful. Information such as the
    country and age of the sample, and whether it is from a web site, or from a scan
    of printed material.  &#40;For example, if we know something comes from an advertisement
    published in the 50&#39;s it would rule out a lot of possibilities.&#41; <BR>
    <BR>Where will you have this so that new posters are very aware of it?

    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>Mike, great tip. I&#39;ll include it in the next
    upgrade. <BR> <BR><i>&#62; Where will you have this so that new posters are  <BR>very
    aware of it?</i> <BR> <BR>Well I made a link in the introductory text for now,  <BR>but
    I&#39;m considering having a permanent link next to  <BR>the &#34;Start New Thread&#34;.
    I can&#39;t do that myself tho so  <BR>I&#39;ll need a bit of help from Joe&#39;n&#39;Jared
    for this.

  body: Hi Yves, <BR> <BR>Thanks for your work on the FAQ. Since you asked, I notice
    one very very very very small english error &#40;of course, I just made 4&#41;.  <BR>
    <BR>Under <b>My sample was ID&#39;d in less than 1 minute, how is this possible?</b>
    <BR>&#42;competitivity of this board&#42; <i>could read</i> &#42;competition on
    this board&#42; <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think competitivity is a word. I could be
    soooooo wrong though. <BR>This is so nitpicky I debated hard before pressing post.
    <BR> <BR>English is my only real language &#40;shamed American that I am&#41;.  <BR>Wait,
    wait. There <i>is</i> Pig Latin and a bit of Anishspay. <BR> <BR>Andyray.
