  body: "Claire, I\u2019m not familiar with the rules outside Norway, but here you
    need to have (or be part of) a firm to make an invoice. You also need to state
    your address and business information (organization number & name), the customer\u2019s
    address and list the items and/or services purchased and/or licensed and specify
    their price and any additional taxes and fees. You\u2019ll probably also want
    to include some information on how one can pay you (account number, IBAN, BIC,
    bank name, &c). Each invoice must have a unique number (invoice #0001, invoice
    #0002 etc), and these must be generated by an automated system. The invoice must
    be in a read-only mode. I use a web service to make mine, and often provide a
    translated copy for international customers. \r\n\r\nI suggest you contact an
    accounting office to ask about what rules apply to your situation."

  body: "Claire, an invoice is just a bill. A Google search will show you many sample
    invoices.\r\n\r\nThings may be different in your country, but in the U.S. an invoice
    doesn't have to use a specific design. I've received invoices from individuals
    that were just emails, or were just handwritten on a plain sheet of paper. But
    if you want the invoice to look more professional you can use a pre-printed invoice
    form (available at office supply stores or on the internet) or design your own,
    and then either mail it to them or send as a PDF attachment. Here's the info on
    a typical invoice:\r\n\r\nDate: today's date\r\n\r\nFrom: your name and mailing
    address\r\n\r\nIdentification: In some countries you may need to list a government
    identification number for yourself, for tax purposes. A local business person
    or accountant (or maybe even a librarian) could tell you if this is necessary
    where you live.\r\n\r\nTo: name and address of the company or person you are billing\r\n\r\nDescription:
    Describe what the bill is for, and list the price. Be specific in your description
    so they clearly know what the bill is for. Also list taxes, if appropriate, and
    then a grand total.\r\n\r\nPayment Instructions: I'm guessing the gallery will
    just mail you a check, so say \"Make check payable to [your name or business name].\"
    If they want to pay you by electronic funds transfer, you'll need to give them
    the appropriate bank info for that.\r\n\r\nReference Number: Each invoice should
    have a reference # of some kind. You could call it \"Invoice #001\". Or if you
    don't want to reveal that this is your very first invoice, number it #501 or pick
    some other number.\r\n\r\nTerms: State when the bill is due (30 days is typical
    in the U.S.) and tell if there are any penalties for late payment.\r\n"

  body: ">  30 days stopped being typical\r\n\r\nMost invoices I receive say 30 days,
    and I believe it's still pretty common nationwide. But if you mean that most companies
    take longer than 30 days to actually pay, I agree."

  body: "Unless you stated it in your contract, the 'due on x' is fairly arbitrary...especially
    if your client is a big company. They'll pay when they're ready to pay, unfortunately.\r\n\r\nYou
    can declare interest after x days. How well you can enforce it is another issue.\r\n\r\nFor
    most of my clients (that I have a good relationship with) my invoice is typically
    just an email:\r\n\r\nSubject: Invoice for (work description)\r\n\r\ndate: xx/xx/xx\r\ndescription:
    (what the work was)\r\namount: $x @ x hours = TOTAL\r\n\r\nAnd then add my address
    for payment.\r\n\r\n"

    by the Graphic Artists Guild. Of course, for most of this to be applicable and.or
    enforcible, you need a similarly worded contract to begin with. Oh, and in the
    process of copying this, I noticed a typo. So thanks, Claire, for giving me a

  body: Don't forget taxes! Depends on the country's rules, but you might have to
    add VAT. In Finland one can sell handicraft items, art and design up to certain
    sum, but after that VAT has to be paid for the whole sum, so it's important to
    be able to estimate the whole year's billing.

  body: "I started using contracts when someone took a brochure I designed for them,
    put it on a billboard, and didn't pay me for the additional use. My favorite part
    of the contract is this fantastic bit here:\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\nRIGHTS
    TRANSFERRED\r\nThe Designer transfers to the Client the following exclusive rights
    of usage:\r\nTitle or product: \u2003\r\nCategory of use: \u2003\r\nMedium of
    use: \u2003\r\nEdition: \u2003\r\nGeographic area: \u2003\r\nTime period: \u2003\r\n\r\nAny

    this section does is makes it clear that you grant the client only the right to
    reproduce your work in a certain medium for a certain amount of time, and that
    you are NOT selling them the copyright to the design itself. Because graphic design
    is technically not copyrightable in the first place, you need to kind of invent
    your own copyright protection, which you do by including the above section in
    a contract. It also says that the client does not have the legal right to use
    your work until they've paid you, which is nice.\r\n\r\n(By the way, my source
    for this wording is the Graphic Artists Guild, which publishes a \"handbook\"
    of sample contracts for all occasions.)"

  body: "Claire, something I want to mention is that in addition to any legal statements
    you want to make in the contract, it's also an opportunity to make sure that you
    and your client have similar expectations about the job, in order to prevent misunderstandings
    or disputes later.\r\n\r\nIt's a place where you can state 1) what services you
    intend to provide, 2) what your charges will be, and 3) what the project's schedule
    will be.  Even if you've already discussed these things verbally with your client,
    putting them in writing and having your client sign off on them is a good idea.\r\n\r\nIf
    you and your client are in agreement on those things BEFORE the work begins, it
    will greatly reduce the chance of problems later. \r\n\r\n"
