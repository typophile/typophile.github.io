body: "Diacritics positioning problem\r\n\r\n\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nI am relatively new to
  fontlab or any similar program. I have a problem with Myriad Pro font. I am trying
  to move the position of diacritics with anchor marks. In font lab everything works
  and in the preview box everything seems to be ok. But if I export font (generate
  font) then nothing changes (the diacritical marks position is the same as before).
  \r\n\r\nAs I have to be based on a certain custom keyboard I am using a certain
  diacritic mark (combining acute accent U+0301). So as Myriad Pro doesn\u2019t have
  this character so I created it based on a similar character.\r\n\r\nI also moved
  these anchor points in Arial and saved the changed font but it still didn\u2019t
  work.\r\n\r\nI have tried these changes in indesign and also in pages. To create
  this character I am using dead key+letter (dead key=U+0301).\r\n\r\nThank you so
  much for your help!\r\nCarmen"

    I understood  you created \"virtual\" composites using anchors and new u+0301
    mark but you did not expand these composites into real glyphs with components:
    bacute, dacute etc. Right? So when you type \"dead key\" + \"b\" you get your
    u+0301 mark at the same \"zero\" position where it was drawn. Anchors do nor work
    in this case because they are not saved or exported into the font. There are two
    possible ways to go further:\r\n1. you use your anchors to create all possible
    composites: bacute, dacute, etc. so that they explicitly exist in the font like
    aacute, eacute, oacute. In this case you will rather need some OpenType feature
    (such as 'ccmp') to substitute \"b\" + \"u0301\" with \"bacute\" etc. \r\n2. or
    you can forget about anchors and simply move contour ' in your u+0301 glyph to
    where you need it. Surely in this case it will appear at the same position over
    every subsequent character.\r\n\r\nFontLab VI will support \"mark\" and \"mkmk\"
    OpenType features (fonts such as Arial use them widely) so there will be more
    possibilities soon with FontLab.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAlex Petrov"
