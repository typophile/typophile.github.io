  body: "My newest project, which we are still developing,  is a <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsearch.php\"
    target=\"new\">Serif Font ID Guide</a>. It happens that the 'b' is one of the
    12 key letters. If you select that characteristic on the Search page (link), you
    will get a list of 257 fonts that have this type of 'b'. There will be samples
    for some of them, but we are still populating the Guide with illustrations.\r\n\r\n-

    search results pages have invalid addresses with the new version of the page.
    Sorry.  \r\n\r\nMy friend, who is helping with the page design, is in Germany,
    and our communication time window makes it a bit hard to communicate quickly about
    problems. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    yesterday with the addional Search Results pages has been fixed, so now you can
    see the whole list of fonts with this kind of 'b'. You will have the designer
    and foundry information, even if no sample image is available yet.\r\n\r\n- Mike
