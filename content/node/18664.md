body: "Another one from the 30-year old vaults:\r\n\r\nThis one is similar to Times,
  but seems a bit more condensed.  Also the tails on the ends of the letterforms aren't
  as profound.\r\n\r\nAny help greatly appreciated.  All I can say is that this face
  is at least 30 years old.\r\n\r\nIt seems like a derivative of Times, but I may
  be wrong. \r\n\r\nNote also the double f ligature on the bottom image... \r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/POPitalic.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/POPitalic2.jpg]\r\n\r\nSorry
  for the poor quality.  These were taken off of the plates for some LP artwork, so
  there's some shadows being cast."

    is the "g" and "r"; However, I think that you can find that "r"  -  TNR Semi-Bold
    Italic. '

    body: "Times is the closest match to everything on my 'puter when trying to overlay
      the text, but yeah, the lowercase r doesn't branch out as soon as it does in
      Times, and the f is definitely more condensed as well as other glyphs.\r\n\r\nTOO
      MANY CLONES!\r\n\r\nWhy does this face have to look better than Times Italic?"

  body: "The 'ff' lig clearly identifies this as a metal Linotype version. That device
    couldn't kern (in the classical sense of overhangs projecting beyond the body
    of a type), so they had to distort the letterforms to compensate. The 'f' almost
    always took the biggest hit.\r\n\r\nSo, I'm pretty sure this is metal Linotype
    Times, and have no reason to disagree with david that it's a semibold italic."

      metal version.  It looks much better.  Time to call the letterpress I suppose.\r\n\r\nThanks

  body: The digital versions of Linotype's Times have a different f, since they aren't
    constrained by matrix production guidelines.

    by [[Storm Type Foundry|Storm]] instead.

    has a narrower f than the digital Times variants\u2026 it isn't stunted (it still
    curves over at the top more) but it is narrow!"

  body: Le Monde replace Times almost perfectly. I recently had to update someone
    else's logo and used Le Monde in place of it. The client did not notice. But then
    I felt guilty and pointed out the difference and they were happy I had replaced
    it. :^)

    body: Thanks for the Lido recommendation.  I'm going to give that a try tonight.  Looks
      like a really solid font.  I'll have to check into Le Monde as well.
