  Theatre Company</a> is presenting a play called <i>The Typographer&#39;s Dream</i>
  at the Thick House in San Francisco. Encore says the show is a &#34;new comedy in
  which a typographer, a geographer, and a stenographer obsess over their professions,
  their identities, and Canada over dinner and several bottles of wine. Adam Bock'

  body: Sorry to hear your trip was delayed, Hrant. But if my calculations are correct,
    you&#39;ll be here in time for the next Impact show. <BR> <BR>As for everyone
    else who&#39;s expressed interest in going, let&#39;s pick a night. If a Thursday
    night isn&#39;t good &#40;which I imagine it isn&#39;t for coming in from Sacramento&#41;,
    then I propose Saturday the 26th. Dinner at the Connecticut Yankee beforehand?
