  It will be used across all sorts of collateral....brochures, quarterly reports etc.
  The mind positively boggles at the possibilities.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "U2 through their design agency [[http://www.four5one.ie/|Four5One]] have
    been using Clarendon for pretty much all their print and web graphics since 2004.
    It might be interesting and useful for you to have a look at how they have handled
    the typeface.\r\n\r\nThe way they seem to make it work is by always juxtaposing
    it with with something very modern looking, [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/eurostile/|Eurostile]]
    in this [[http://www.u2wanderer.org/disco/view.shtml?images/alb021-01.jpg|case]].
    They also make nice use of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/tilde/aachen/|Aachen]]
    in the booklet of the same album. You can sort of see it [[http://www.u2wanderer.org/disco/view.shtml?images/alb021-08.jpg|here]]
    but it looks better on the inside pages. Also worth checking out is the book U2byU2
    were they have used [[http://www.myfonts.com/search?search[text]=garamond|Garamond]]
    in conjunction with Clarendon, but don't know how successful this is really. The
    original use of Clarendon in U2 material is the 2004 [[http://www.u2wanderer.org/disco/alb019.html|How
    to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb]] album, which is entirely set in Clarendon.\r\n\r\nOn
    looking through the U2 stuff I get the impression Clarendon is a difficult face
    to work with. I have also found this myself from experience. My own suggestion
    here would be [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/helvetica-neue/cond-thin/|Helvetica
    Condensed Light]]. It think that could make the right contrast. I also feel like
    I can never use anything other than another classic face with Clarendon. I don't
    know why that is. \r\nAnyway I hope this has been of some assistance to you!"
