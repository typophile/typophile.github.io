  body: "Scriptina has been around for at least 6 or 7 years, and it has been popular
    since 'Apostrophe' first made it available. Free is a big part of its appeal,
    but the attention it attracts, even when people don't know what it costs shows
    that they like the style of it. Whether they <em>should</em> like it is a matter
    of opinion, but it is eye-catching, graceful and different, and sometimes that's
    what the people want.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Not at all, Tobias. Everyone's got opinions about fonts, especially ones
    that you see maybe too often.  Just because I know the designer, and have an autographed
    poster of it on my wall, doesn't mean I think it's great, but I do know that a
    lot of people like it as soon as they see it. I have had <em>many</em> ID requests
    for it.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Yepp, I'm well aware that it's a popular font and that many spontaneously
    like it. Generally I'm pretty open-minded but when it comes to Scriptina I truly
    don't understand its appeal, hence the question. \r\n\r\nSorry if I was too blunt
    and if I offended anyone. All respect to Apostrophic Labs. "

  body: Like Lex said, it feels half way there, the swashes are simply overkill  Plus,
    I get the feeling that it has become the Comic Sans of the 'I am cheap but want
    to look exclusive' world.

  body: "I've seen so many references to Sciptina, and not one that didn't look awkwardly
    set. I understand why people are attracted to the large open swashes. They look
    a lot like what a lettering artist like Rob Lueschke might do. But Rob's fonts
    set properly. Scriptina doesn't. \r\nI used to teach calligraphy classes and one
    of the most common things students do is over emphasis curves and swashes. Subtlety
    is needed even when there is a lot of eye candy involved. Like many free fonts,
    Scriptina is an under developed idea."
