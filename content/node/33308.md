  it could not export a font with more than 6,401 glyphs. I can't find that in the
  manual or as a search topic at Typophile. Was that FL message accurate, or have
  I done something wrong?\r\n\r\nCharles\r\n\r\nP.S. Yes, I know most printer's RIPs
  will now handle .TTF fonts. But that hasn't always filtered down to the printers
  MSRs, so they preflight it, then reject a job because it has \"Truetype\" fonts.
  You always seem to loose a few days in the production schedule. "

    fonts you need to license their Asia Font Studio tool.

  body: Indeed. I think there's no technical reason for the limitation. They just
    want you to buy Asia Font Studio.

  body: "Thanks John. We got up with the printer, who agreed to try the .TTF font
    if we would send a test file. Let's hope it works; a $1,400 upgrade is a bit more
    that we want to spend.\r\n\r\nOdd journal (named <cite>boundary 2</cite>). It
    uses Helvetica for the text font, so when Chinese appears, our usual Chinese fonts
    don't look right. And no, I didn't design it."

  body: "Charles, \r\n\r\ninformation about the limitation has existed on the \"Specifications\"
    section of the FontLab Studio web page ever since the product was released: \r\nhttp://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/fontlab-studio/\r\n\r\nand
    is also included on:\r\nhttp://www.fontlab.com/fontlab-products/compare/\r\n\r\nIt
    is also described on page 20 of the FontLab Studio manual that says: \"Open, edit
    and generate OpenType PS, TrueType / OpenType TT and PostScript Type 1 formats
    with up to 6,400 characters\", as well as on page 152. \r\n\r\nIf you need to
    generate an OpenType PS font with more than 6,400 glyphs, you can either use TypeTool
    3 (which is just $99) or AsiaFont Studio 4, which both can generate fonts with
    up to 65,535 glyphs. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam Twardoch\r\nFontlab Ltd."

  body: "Adam, I wasn't complaining particularly, just trying to confirm that the
    message I got was in fact correct, and I hadn't done some bone-head thing & was
    getting an error message really cause by that. Well, I'll complain a little about
    the manual. I'm an index user & really like comprehensive indexes. I realize paying
    good indexer is an expensive proposition. Anyway, for whatever reason, I have
    a lot of trouble finding specific things in the manual -- the PDF version, maybe
    there is another?\r\n\r\nAnd you are quite right, after John Hudson pointed it
    out, we found the 6,100 glyph limitation on the FontLab web site.\r\n\r\nWe have
    TransType 3 on our old iMac & it ground & ground for a while, then quit. I suspect
    it just ran out of memory. Sound like our best solution, if the printer rejects
    the .TTF format, is to get TypeTool3 for one of the up-to-date Windows machines
    we have. We have several Chinese fonts; all have more than 6,100 glyphs, and the
    ones most compatible with Helvetica are in the TTF format -- also the one that
    has both \"standard\" and \"bold\" weights, which has also come up once or twice.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the help."
