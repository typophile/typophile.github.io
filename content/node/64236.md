body: "Hello, I'd greatly appreciate your help with this one. My client need her logo
  re-created and she keeps telling me to use the \"Papyrus\" font. But this is not
  papyrus and I can't find a font with a similar name. I have not only searched all
  my fonts but also looked at Dafont etc... I have even tried out the Whatthefont
  tool - with no success...\r\n\r\nYou can see the logo here: http://www.eyeinnovations.net/\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
  font in question is the \"Eye Innovations\" logo.\r\nThank you so much for your
  help.\r\n\r\nAmalthea"
