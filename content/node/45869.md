body: "Hi everyone, I am new to the site. I am a graphic designer, I am overhauling
  my portfolio, which, up until now has been actual final pieces glued on paper and
  put in sleeves.\r\n\r\nIt's come to my attention that this is very \"straight out
  of school\" and so I am looking for a smaller, sleeker portfolio to show to potential
  freelance clients and potential employers.\r\n\r\nI've been looking at the following:
  \r\n\r\nhttp://www.pzdirect.com/34viscposetf7.html\r\n\r\nI like the 11x17 size,
  I like that it's screw post and not a binder, and the pages seem to be transparent
  and durable.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you know of an awesome portfolio that I can purchase
  online, I'd love to hear about it. I am just starting to shop for one, and don't
  know what's out there.\r\n\r\nThanks for any info!\r\n\r\n"

    using has resulted in the interviewer complimenting the actual portfolio. Which
    either says a lot for the portfolio or not much about my work. ha. It's only 11x14
    though.\r\n\r\n\r\n[[http://www.veer.com/products/merchdetail.aspx?image=VPR0004000&WT.ac=merch.bags.080501.8.img.folio.alum|Here

  body: "I just bought a $5.00 A4 portfolio by Muji at the MoMA design store. It\u2019s
    just like the generic cheap plastic portfolios art stores sells, but with translucent
    covers that make the whole thing seem really classy. I\u2019m looking forward
    to dumping my 18\"x24\" portfolio for this one."

  body: I personally never use something with plastic sleeves in it. They reflect
    light, which makes the work inside hard to see.

  body: "I like the look of the brushed-metal number. Very smart. I'm sure I've seen
    a Muji equivalent of it, but I could be wrong.\r\n\r\nI have two portfolios, one
    for my design work and another for my photography. For the design work I use the
    [[http://www.londongraphics.co.uk/acatalog/PRAT_Pampa_Spiralbooks.html|Pratt Pampa
    series]]. They're not cheap (and London Graphics certainly aren't -- theirs was
    just the first link I found) but they're good quality, using thick, fine-grain
    leather and have a velvety inside. They use clear pockets, so there is a glare
    issue, but they look smart for years. I have a couple of them, my current one
    is about 5 yeas old and still looks quite new. The A4 version is best, because
    it's small enough to throw into a bag. Why bother lugging a big thing around ...\r\n\r\nFor
    the photograps I use archival polyester sleeves stacked loose in a portfolio box.
    Looks smart. Nice to lay flat open and move prints from one side to the other.
    Unlike the Pratt A4 book, this is far less portable. I print everything 16x12\"
    and use a deep-ish box. I've got a carrying case for it all which though ugly,
    but does the job well. I use [[http://www.silverprint.co.uk/|Silverprint for all
    this stuff.]] They're great, but I reckon you can get 'em elsewhere too.\r\n\r\nThere's
    a London/UK bias here I realise."
