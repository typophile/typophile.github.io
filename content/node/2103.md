  body: I would say AT Sackers Gothic, but the cedilla is wrong. What a goofy looking
    cedilla.

  body: Here&#39;s &#39;Sackers Engravers Gothic Heavy&#39;. I used an extra outline
    and used the lower case to simulate the heavier look of the sample. &#40;Either
    method would have worked, so this could be overkill, but the point was to show
    how a heavier weight could be achieved with a font. I apologize to the purists.&#41;
    The cedilla is still wrong, but if metal type was used that part might have been
    added.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/20656.gif" alt="Sackers

  body: Daniel, I&#39;m guessing that the &#34;Est. 2001&#34; makes it a bit more
    recent sample than you&#39;re thinking it is.

  body: Now, that doesn&#39;t eliminate the possibility that it&#39;s actually typeset,
    as I can&#39;t find a gothic with that kind of cedilla -- most appear to angle
    the other way, if angled at all. However, not being French myself or even knowing
    French beyond the phrases I&#39;m familiar with -- &#34;esprit d&#39;escalier&#34;
    is a favorite of mine, not to mention a frequent affliction -- the search has
    been quite instructive indeed.
