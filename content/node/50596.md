  italics for a typeface that contains the cyrillic letter ghe stroke, I am having
  difficulties finding any information on what the (lower case) italic version of
  this letter looks like.\r\nIs it just a slanted version of the upright, or does
  it follow the rule of ghe (and in that case: how is the stroke applied), or is it
  something third?\r\n\r\nYour help will be deeply appreciated."

  body: "Here's a good if hard-to-parse response on this exact question from the ATypI
    list, when I asked about it last January. Victor Kharyk is a type designer and
    scholar of Cyrillic letterforms.\r\n\r\nHe wrote:\r\n\r\nLook, if anybody, for
    example, ask here what is the form of Latin g -\r\nyou will answer:\r\n\"it is
    a lot of forms relative to typestyles, history, different\r\nnational traditions
    etc\". The same is with Cyrillic letters, especialy with\r\nghe ang its sisters.\r\n
    CAPS is the same in all \"Cyrillic Slavonic countries\" and Greece.\r\nRoman-styled
    lower case is the same, exept modern Bulgaria (circa last\r\n30 years), where
    \"reversed s\" is prefered (naturaly the direction of stress must be\r\ncorrected).\r\n\r\n
    Italic lower case have reversed s-form in all countries, exept Serbia\r\nand Macedonia,
    where prefered form looked as i macron (and the\r\nsame with macron and acute
    together for Macedonian u0453)\r\n\r\n Ukrainian \"explosive\" ghe u0491 is relatively
    new letter and its\r\ndevelopement were stoped in soviet time, that\x92s why research
    of its\r\nforms not finish till now. There are some historical forms relatived
    to\r\nsome forms of Greek gamma (with long tale under the baseline)- this\r\nform
    and its development seems good for \"quill tradition\", other\r\n\"dropped pen
    tradition\" come in early 20th century (we can see it in\r\nworks of Georgiy Narbut)
    - this form used in modern school-books. New\r\nform (reversed s with \"strich\"
    bottom left) was proposed few years ago\r\nby Hennadij Zarechnjuk (Hennadiy Zarechniuk)
    from Lviv and also in use. It is mean that\r\nitalic form of this letter must
    be designed in every font relatively\r\nto its style, as like as any other letter:)\r\n\r\n>From
    my presentation in Helsinki:\r\n(you got it also in goody bag)\r\nhttp://www.ljplus.ru/img/v/i/viktor_kharyk/UL32.jpg\r\nhttp://www.ljplus.ru/img/v/i/viktor_kharyk/UL33.jpg\r\nhttp://www.ljplus.ru/img/v/i/viktor_kharyk/UL33a.jpg\r\n\r\nBest
    wishes\r\nViktor Kharyk,\r\nCountry Delegate for Ukraine :)\r\n\r\n(ps. bad English
    does not mean bad information :)\r\n\r\nTuesday, January 22, 2008 you wrote:\r\nTP>

  body: "Hi Thomas\r\n\r\nThank you very much, though I am not sure exactly what to
    conclude regarding ghe stroke, since this Viktor's answer is concerned with u0491
    and not u0493.\r\n\r\nAs I see it, there are two options: a) no final conclusion
    has been reached as how to draw this letter (either oblique or \"reversed s\")
    and therefore it is optional, or is it b) that the ghe stroke should follow the
    shape of ghe. In my case, a sans serif, I have a \"reversed s\" ghe and an oblique
    ghe upstroke. So I guess that, if option a is valid, I could go for the oblique
    ghe stroke without making Uzbek eyes sore... "

  body: you're welcome, this is the form i've typically used and been asked to use
    by clients. you might double check some [[ParaType]] fonts just for reference.
