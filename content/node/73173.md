body: "Firefox 4 (beta 3) has added OpenType Layout support, controllable through
  private CSS extensions. It works on Mac OS X by default, while in the Windows version
  of Firefox 4, you need to open the URL <code>about:config</code> and set the <code>gfx.font_rendering.harfbuzz.level</code>
  option to <code>1</code>.\r\n\r\nThis is quite an interesting opportunity for font
  developers, and especially Python scripters. You could produce complex HTML renderings
  of your fonts including OpenType Layout feature previews, right out of your font
  editor such as FontLab Studio. Combined with the fact that Firefox supports webfonts
  in OTF and TTF formats, it's trivial to generate a simple web page. \r\n\r\nThe
  CSS property to use in <code>-moz-font-feature-settings</code>. The mechanism is
  <a href=\"http://hacks.mozilla.org/2009/10/font-control-for-designers/\">documented</a>
  on the Mozilla Hacks blog. \r\n\r\nFirefox 4 uses HarfBuzz, an opensource OpenType
  Layout library which provides a similar functionality to Uniscribe. HarfBuzz supports
  user-controllable OpenType Layout features as well as complex-script shaping rules.
  This all makes it a lightweight environment to test your OpenType Layout features.
  Unfortunately, Firefox currently does not <em>print</em> using webfonts, so you
  won't be able to get a PDF with your font showings out of Firefox easily. \r\n\r\n<em>Correction:
  Firefox uses harfbuzz-ng, a \"next generation\" version of the library, which does
  not yet integrate complex-script shapers. So FF4 is, for now, good just for testing
  user-controllable OT Layout features.</em>\r\n\r\nHere's an example which renders
  \"Hello small caps world!\", in which \"small caps\" is rendered in OpenType small
  caps (with the \"smcp\" feature applied). \r\n\r\n<code>\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC
  \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN\"&gt;\r\n&lt;html&gt;\r\n\t&lt;head&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;style
  type=\"text/css\"&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;!-- \r\n\t\t@font-face {\r\n\t\tfont-family:'TestFamily';\r\n\t\tsrc:
  url('MyTestFont.otf')  format(\"opentype\");\r\n\t\t} \r\n\t\t--&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;/style&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/head&gt;\r\n\t&lt;body&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;p
  style=\"font-family:'TestFamily';font-size:36px;\"&gt;\r\n\t\t\tHello &lt;span style=\"<strong>-moz-font-feature-settings:'smcp=1'</strong>;\"&gt;small
  caps&lt;/span&gt; world!\r\n\t\t&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/body&gt;\r\n&lt;/html&gt;\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam\r\n"

  body: About freakin' time. Thanks to the people involved in pushing this very important
    aspect of text handling under HTML. It's there now, other browsers will follow
    if they know what time it is.

  body: "One thing I should point out: Firefox 4 uses \"private\" CSS extensions,
    with the prefix <code>-moz-</code>, which is the way to do it before new aspects
    of CSS have been standardized. \r\n\r\nBut the really good news is that an even
    more comprehensive mechanism for handling OpenType Layout features in CSS has
    been submitted for standardization at the W3 Consortium (I'm proud to say that
    I had a tiny little part in that). The current <a href=\"http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-fonts/\">editor's
    draft of the CSS Fonts Module Level 3</a> specifies the \"official\" syntax, which
    is quite similar to that used by Firefox 4. Once the CSS3 Fonts draft is accepted,
    browser makers will be able to implement the official syntax. So things are on
    the way in the right direction. \r\n\r\nAnd of course, it would be useful to provide
    a <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/\">link to the Firefox 4
    beta</a> which does all this! :) On the Mac, you can copy <code>Firefox.app</code>
    from the <code>.dmg</code> to a temporary folder, rename it to <code>Firefox 4.app</code>
    and then move it to the <code>Applications</code> folder. This way, you'll be
    able to keep the release version of Firefox 3 untouched. You won't be able to
    run both versions at the same time, but you can quit one and run the other. "

  body: "I'm currently testing the latest beta of Firefox 4 (Mac). Overall good impression
    so far (faster, cleaner interface), but I've come across a problem:\r\n\r\nIt
    seems that Firefox is doing some funky ppem-specific adjustment to spacing \u2014
    automatically increasing tracking for bigger text sizes. (?)\r\n\r\nIs this behavior
    documented somewhere? Is there a way to turn this \u201Cfeature\u201D off?"

  body: "Looking closer at the issue after a few weeks with the latest beta, it seems
    that Firefox is messing up with the space character only \u2013 stretching it
    for smaller PPEM sizes, and shrinking it as PPEM size increases.\r\n\r\nFor a
    type designer this is quite annoying. The width of space characters is part of
    the design and should be respected by the rendering engine.\r\n\r\nThis was probably
    intended as a feature (optical spacing), but it should be optional and not activated
    by default."
