    that&#39;s perfect for your home page. Perhaps you could create  <BR>an animated

  body: Hey Kris, I just realized that &#39;klim&#39; is a unidirectional palindrome
    of &#39;milk&#39;. And I like milk, too. Erm... no real point to mentioning this,
    I suppose. <BR> <BR>Sorry.

    name: kris
  body: Ha! Grant, you are the first one to get that without me prompting! That is
    actually how the name came about. For a while I was into rerversing words in order
    to find new ones, to see what happened. One day I reversed milk and out popped
    klim. this is the true beginning of the name Klim. It took me a while to get used
    to the idea that it is completely valid to make a word up and start to use it
    &#40;Hrant does it all the time&#41;. This was confirmed by a spread in &#39;the
    art of looking sideways&#39; that had the word ZAUM across it, zaum being the
    trans-rational poetic language that the Russian avant-garde &#39;invented&#39;,
    they dealt with words by their sound and their visual presence, not really by
    their meaning. I was comforted by this, thus Klim was borne. I initially used
    it in &#40;unoficially&#41; some school projects and thought of dropping later
    on. My friends balked at this and said &#39;no, klim is you, you have to keep
    it.&#39; So I did. <BR> <BR>Ahh, the mystery has been revealed.
