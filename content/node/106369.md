  is divisible by 0.75.\r\n\r\nI can do it manually, but is there a program that could
  speed it up?"

  body: You can change the width of every character with a python script. What font
    program are you using. And do you expect to change the height also? And if you
    change the advance width, do you need to move the glyph contours as well?
