body: "Hi Typophiles,\r\nIn july I bought the book printed by Elzeviers in 1661. ([[http://typophile.com/node/72762|here]]
  you can find some details). After a short research I realised there is no any fonts
  based strictly on types used by Elzeviers[8 pt] available now. [edit: except DTL
  Elzevir, but based on 14 pt /Augustijn Romeyn/ not text]\r\nSo... I decided to make
  a font (first in my life :D\r\nFont under working name VanDyckBoek is intented as
  typeface for books. The shapes look up to printed letters set at about 8 pt.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/vandyck_5470.png]\r\nI
  have attached my first attempt here. I'm particularly concerned about inconsistencies
  in stroke widths/contrast, overshoots etc and overall look of these letters. At
  this moment there is no numerals; italic and titling version are in future plans.
  \r\n\r\nEvery your opinion is highly appreciated.\r\n\r\nJan \u017Burawski\r\n\r\nUpdate:

  body: "Hi Janek. A great work so far.\r\n\r\nAs long as I understood, your goal
    is to keep some degree of inconsistencies and imperfections one finds in original
    print which inspired this revival. So differences in stems or curves are intentional
    and you will not do a normalization (as one finds in Elsevier Book or other \"cleaned\"
    fonts).\r\n\r\nAnyway, I think your |f| could benefit with bigger contrast \u2013I
    mean, to make the curve thinner. Serif in upper leg of |k| also must be heavier
    to be compatible with serifs at top of |v|w|y|. Terminals of |s| could also be
    a bit bolder to keep overall design, marked by a kind of dot gain in old printing.\r\n\r\nAbout
    OSF, I prefer the first set. Surely, |5| needs to be narrower, as Brian pointed,
    but the new design conflits with |3| in the bottom leg \u2013it may have the same
    kind of opening ratio. I also think this style of |5| is very much calligraphic
    and hard to read. I may be wrong, but I believe in 17th Century Dutch school already
    established a nice trend to be more and more legible instead of the ornated and
    artistic approach one finds in French and Italian typography during much more
    time. So a less \"stylish\" approach seems more coherent with the remainning glyphs,
    IMHO.\r\n\r\nI also prefer the first OSF |0|. This is a very personal question,
    but I always disliked OSF 0 with inverted flow/contrast. I undestand this was
    made to differentiate |0| from |o|, but the |0| becomes strange for me. Your first
    |o| is perfect.\r\n\r\nI got impressed how good the font print and reads. Keep
    the great work.\r\n\r\n(I sent you a PM about Roman numerals.)"

  body: "Ooh, Cyrillics. I think a lot of it looks pretty nice; I enjoy the /che/,
    and the /be/ is nicely executed. However, I must critique, since this is the critique
    section. Let's see...\r\n\r\nI think the left leg of your Russian /el/ is too
    big; ideally it shouldn't stray all that far outside of the box made by the rest
    of the character. Sometimes it has to, but in this case I think the very long
    style doesn't really fit with the rest of your font. (Especially look at it side-by-side
    with the ball on the bottom of /ze/, which I think is actually pretty nice, though
    maybe, <em>maybe</em> it could afford to be a bit bigger.) I feel like it shouldn't
    recurve upward, and the ball should just point to the left; at least, that's what
    I would do, but go with your heart. This goes as well for /Ka/ and /Zhe/. Also
    for those two, the bottom legs are distractingly Bodoniesque, by which I guess
    I mean vertical. I think they'd fit your style better if they were more diagonal.
    I second what Freiberger said about the too-wide characters, and I would also
    probably add /te/. I wonder whether the serifs on /te/ (and /ghe/) are big enough,
    too. Speaking of serifs, the spike on the bottom of /dzhe/ seems to me more characteristic
    of the rest of your font than the ones on /shcha/tse/Dzhe/. The stress is a bit
    weird on /eh/ from being made out of a mirrored /c/ shape, and lastly I think
    the left serif of /Tviordiyznak/ should match the left serif of /T/.\r\n\r\n(By
    the way, there's a typo in \u0438\u0442\u0430\u043B\u044F\u044C\u044F\u043D\u0441\u043A\u043E\u0433\u043E

    kind Typophile fellows Roman is early beta. On the other side Italic is still
    in its infancy. I tried to use quadratic Beziers in first corrections, but it
    is extremely difficult and inappropriate at this stage.\r\n\"Any foundry interested?\"
    I didn't ask, nobody answered ;)\r\nMy idea (reconsidered) Family will bundle:
    Roman in four grads, Italic (probably the same), Bold and BoldItalic. Roman with
    coursive Greek (as in 17th century texts), Romans and Italics with Cyrillic of
    course.\r\nTwo samples (ca 11/13 pt, photo)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/26_6376.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/56_5739.png]\r\nBest

  body: "15 minutes bold: http://typophile.com/node/72791#comment-423128\r\nIn FontForge:
    1) scale vertically 1000% 2) style, change weight 3) scale vertically 10%. When
    verticals gain weight by 12 em, horizontals by only 1 em.\r\nOf course this way
    is good for quick evaluating and require subsequent editing/grinding and adjusting
    sidebearings.\r\nBTW vertical size of glyphs changes a bit, so you need to a)
    pinpoint the desired height b) evaluate needed scaling factor (e.g. 9.8% or 9.9%,
    Nota bene: I want  bold to be a bit [e.g. 5 em] bigger).\r\nEdit: everything is

    face.

    even extrapolated Light(not as extreme as this one above)."

    observe how the Regular behaves in real print, on various papers in different
    sizes. Your typeface has some contrast, and finding the minimal stroke width in
    the Light will be crucial, if the font has to be used in the real world.\r\nIt
    is great to have many weights, but I would see (as a designer, not a type designer)
    rather an UltraBlack, than Light in your font, if you want to go further than
    just making a revival."
