  quote from the read me:\r\n\"Stylistic sets have been designed to use all alternate
  characters together (set 1), or to apply alternates to one letter (series=all accented
  variations of that letter) only (sets 2-16).\"\r\n\r\nThis seems very flexible.
  Now, if only we had a way for apps to report something meaningful in their UI, rather
  than just \"Set 13\"!\r\n"

  body: "John, thanks for your compliment. I'm glad someone appreciates this typeface.
    I got this way of thinking from [[Mark Simonson]], when he was talking about his
    stylistic sets in <a href=\"http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/proximanova.html\">Proxima
    Nova</a>.\r\nHenry, basically what John is saying is that you can apply all the
    alternates at once or handpick which letters you want to be substituted by their
    alternates by using [[stylistic sets]] when using the [[OpenType]] version of
    <a href=\"http://www.p22.com/lanston/products/touristgothic.html\">Tourist Gothic</a>."
