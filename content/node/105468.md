  body: "Nice!, that's an insteresting g\r\n\r\nThis is probably a amateur question:\r\n\r\nWhen
    designing typefaces like Schoiffer Sans, all the letters shouldn't follow the
    same shape flow as in the g, a, e, and c ?, Is this an stilistic approach?\r\n\r\nQuestion
    two: Did you use a especial ratio (like Golden Ratio, Perfect Fifth, Octave..
    etc) to decide the max and min values of the rounded borders?\r\n\r\n"

    body: "Hi Noisak,\r\n\r\nSchoiffer Sans is in fact inspired by a old serif typeface
      known as Ensched\xE9 English-bodied N\xB06 (see image)\r\n\r\nI tried to keep
      the particular structure of the original 'g', 'e' for instance while modernizing
      the whole and making it a sans-serif (the 's' is more open and 'humanistic'
      than the original). The 'n' and 'h' 'are more conventional because it is not
      a display typeface but intended to set text.\r\n\r\nThe rounded borders are
      all made optically, I wanted that the face looks hand-cratfed and that the reader
      feels the 'ink' as much as possible. That's also why it is slightly flared as
      well.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/paper-1-300_3906.png]"

  body: "Oh, that's a rare sample, quiet interesting. I like how the L bottom serif
    play with the e and a curves. That Q, the ? sign and the iacute are cool.\r\n\r\nYou
    just made a really distinctive design with Schoiffer Sans. The round borders look
    great even on a display size and all diacritics are very subtle and coherent.\r\n"
