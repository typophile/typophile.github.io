  over one hundred new fonts. Unfortunately, there is no list of them -- there is
  just a complete list of all fonts it contains, where the new one aren't marked as
  such.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know any \"highlight\" among the new fonts in Font Folio
  11? I guess it'd include fonts that have been released individually (like Adobe
  Garamond Premiere), but it there any fonts in there that haven't previously been
  released at all?"

    quite unimpressive for Latin script users -- besides the complex script and the
    Japanese fonts, Garamond Premier Pro and Arno Pro seem to be the only thing interesting.\r\n"

    FontFolio 11 additionally has <strong>Pr6N</strong> versions of both Kozuka families,

  body: "> <em>The Adobe Hebrew and Arabic were designed to match Minion</em>\r\n\r\nThat's
    what some people think, but that's not correct. About a year ago John Hudson wrote
    to the OpenType mailinglist how it happened:\r\n\r\n<cite>The Arabic, Hebrew and
    Thai designs were initiated without reference to the Latin companions. We knew
    there would be a Latin companion from the Adobe library, and I thought this would
    probably be one of the families with an MM source because they offered the most
    flexibility in terms of being able to match the weight and proportions of the
    non-Latins, but we didn't design the non-Latins to enable the instance of the
    Latin. When we started the non-Latin designs, we didn't even know for sure that
    Minion would be the companion.\r\nOnce the relative regular and bold weights of
    the non-Latins were designed, we looked first at the style, and determined that
    Minion was a reasonable match. Then I made custom versions of a few Minion letters
    \u2014 H b i \u2014, made measurements of these (stem weights, letter widths,
    x-height) and delivered these values to Christopher Slye at Adobe. Christopher
    had the job of generating from the Minion MM sources as close a match as he could
    to the values I had provided. I don't think any of the instances were a perfect
    match to the values I provided, but they were all quite close. A couple of the
    Latin bolds are a touch lighter than ideal because within the Minion MM matrix
    we couldn't get the heavier weight without throwing the widths off too much or
    reducing counter sizes unacceptably.\r\nI'm very impressed by just how versatile
    Minion has proven itself to be in this kind of project, though, and the pleasing
    combinations are a result of that versatility, not of designing the non-Latins
    within a specific range of weights and proportions determined by Minion.</cite>\r\n\r\n>
    <em>And aren\u2019t Bickham Script Pro and Arno Pro included with the CS\u2019?</em>\r\n\r\nYes,
    these two families are bundled with the CS3 suites."

    that could only be found in Type 1 format are now available in OpenType. The only
    Type 1 fonts in FF11 are Pi/Ornament fonts, but all these have their OpenType
    counterparts."
