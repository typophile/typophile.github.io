  body: Hi, I can't figure out how to post the image, I'm just using the 'Insert image'
    link at the bottom of the post. I think it's the same type as the 'Featured Face:...
    from Carl Crossgrove" on the right sidebar on this page...

  body: If Carl's Beorcana isn't an exact match to your sample, it's probably <a href="http://www.linotype.com/1305/optima-family.html">Optima</a>.
    I'd use Beorcana for whatever you're using it for though. :^P
