  the copy. It looks like it has some echoes of Optima. Or was it a serif face once
  upon a time and has had the serifs sloughed off?\r\n\r\nNJ"

  body: "Well, you said you thought it had echoes of Optima and I agree. To me it
    seems interesting how few stressed sans seem original. It's hard to fault Optima
    -- it's been around a long time and it is beautifully elegant -- but you would
    think more designers would tackle a new take on stressed sans faces. There must
    be more than I think, but offhand the only other similar style I can think of
    that I like a lot is Monotype's [[http://www.fonts.com/FindFonts/Detail.htm?pid=243318&/cgi-bin/MsmGo.exe?grab_id=0&page_id=37056&query=STRAYHORN&SCOPE=Fonts|Strayhorn]]
    by Michael Harvey. I know it's a sans version of Ellington, but it's more than
    that in my opinion. Harvey shows wonderful skill with the letters, and I assume
    it comes from his stone cutting experience. At larger sizes (or in print), I think
    it's a beautiful typeface.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    Sans]].\r\n\r\nAnd another good one is [[http://fontbureau.com/fonts/Amira|Amira]],
    which has that angular energy of a lot of Cyrus Highsmith's faces. \r\n\r\nI like
    the heavier weights of both of these better than the light ones. \r\n\r\nDoyald
    Young's [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/doyald-young/young-finesse/|Finesse]] is
    a super thin variant on Optima which looks good very big. "
