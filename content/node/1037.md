    target="_blank"> FF Dax &#40;Wide&#41;</a> Bold, although  <BR>the contrast doesn&#39;t

    Barmeno</a> also is a possibility,  <BR>but there I can&#39;t get a decent online
    sampling. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s quite hard, with your sample being &#34;corroded&#34;  <BR>like
    that...

  body: I don&#39;t think it&#39;s Dax because the R&#39;s leg originates too far
    from the stem. How about Formata Condensed Medium, or FF Scala Sans Bold?

    Formata Condensed</a>,  <BR>but the fact that the corners on D, P and R seem to

  body: Ok, I see that now. My impulse was to say maybe they compressed it graphically,
    but then you think I&#39;m cheating.;-&#41; <BR> <BR>I see what you mean about
    the way the corners seem almost rounded, which is why Dax sounded good at first.
    I&#39;m stuck!
