  like some sort of Baskerville, but the tail on the R is wrong, and the top of the

  body: It looks like a nice font, but how in the hell do you find out about pricing
    and licensing on that site? Or view a character set? Do you seriously have to
    "request information"? I've seen some lame foundry sites but this one takes the
    case.
