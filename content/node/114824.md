body: "The style known as <em>Scotch Roman</em> is considered as a modern face.\r\nBut
  if you look closely at the design of a <em>Scotch Roman</em>, it appears it has
  the bracketed serifs of the transitional faces.\r\nModern faces in the Vox-AtypI
  definition are called <em>Didones</em> meaning Didot and Bodoni. These two types
  have hairline serifs.\r\nPunchcutter Richard Austin who previously worked for John
  Bell and gave him transitional types was the creator of <em>Scotch Roman</em>.\r\nI
  observed some specimen of <em>Scotch Roman</em> that have the high contrast of the
  <em>Didones</em>.\r\n\r\nWhat is your view on <em>Scotch Roman</em> inside the Vox-AtypI
  category system?"

    the best, of course. I also like its broad glyph coverage.

  body: "Thanks! Simon Esterson used the Micro version for <em>Eye</em> magazine,
    body text and decks, and it didn\u2019t look at all strange. I would not have
    thought to do that\u2014having scrupulously mimicked the effect of 150-years ago,
    with optical sizing, I was so invested in that idea that I forgot my own mantra,
    which is that you never know what will work until you try to make it work, and
    see what happens."

  body: "There's nothing wrong with optical sizing. But there's also no reason you
    couldn't have made Scotch Micro Micro which starts with the assumption Scotch
    Micro is what the 11 point looks like, and Scotch Micro Micro is the corresponding
    6 point.\r\n\r\nAfter all, a smaller optically sized font is bolder and wider
    - and bold, condensed, light, and wide weights of typefaces exist without being
    related to optical sizing, as well as different typefaces differing in these characteristics.\r\n\r\nOptical
    sizing may involve other parameters as well, but the fact that a certain quantity
    of boldness and wideness makes a 6 point face correspond to an 11 point face doesn't
    prevent that quantity from also being approximately what the 11 point size needs
    to look better to someone. And that was likely because of how tastes changed in
    150 years."
