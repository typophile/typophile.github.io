  body: "Ciao Alessandro,\r\n\r\nI\u2019m not sure I understand your question, but
    I\u2019ll try.\r\n\r\nUsually a database (which is where stuff is stored) is editable
    via a Web application (which is the program that actually takes the input from
    the database, presents it to the user and sends it back to the database once it\u2019s
    been edited) that is written in a programming language (in the case of pages ending
    with .php, that language is called PHP, but theoretically any programming language
    could do it). A Web application is made of dynamic pages in the sense that you
    usually write a generic page that can edit/display content items of the same kind.\r\n\r\nSo
    the page were you edit stuff is actually a part of the Web application that lets
    you edit data stored in a database. It\u2019s called Web application because you
    do this through HTML forms in your browser, visiting a Web page, instead of a
    graphical user interface (GUI) on your own machine.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m sorry if it
    sounds convoluted, I can clarify further aspects if needed. Does this help in
    any way?\r\n\r\nCheers."

  body: "verbosus summed it up well. Yes, \"dynamic page\" typically refers to a web
    page that's connected to the DB in some form.\r\n\r\nA dynamic page, via that
    definition, would have to be built using some server-side programming language,
    such as PHP."
