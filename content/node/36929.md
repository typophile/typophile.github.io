  at the last minute. I won't be in the printed programme, but I suppose my presentation
  details will soon be included in the online <a href=\"http://atypi.org/05_Brighton/20_main_program\">programme
  presentations timetable</a>.\r\n\r\nUntil this is arranged, below are the details
  of my presentation in case anyone's interested in showing up.\r\n\r\n__________________________\r\n\r\n<strong>Oversampled</strong>\r\n__________________________\r\n\r\n<em>Yves
  Peters</em>\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Friday 14 September</em> | 10:45 \u2013 11:15\r\nLocation:
  Seminar Room 202</strong>\r\nPresentation | Theme: <em>Hand made</em> | Duration:
  30 minutes\r\n\r\nFor as long as type has existed, successful designs have been
  copied by competing foundries. More recently, the grunge boom in the nineties saw
  the birth of a new, punk-influenced design aesthetic. Aspiring type designers with
  no formal training adopted the DIY attitude, disassembling the outlines of existing
  typefaces and reconstructing them into bastard hybrids. This approach is similar
  to sampling in hip hop, where rhythm tracks are assembled by rearranging snippets
  of existing songs. But whereas the music business provides a legal framework for
  sampling, the type industry has yet to formally address this phenomenon.\r\n\r\n__________________________\r\n\r\n<strong>Speaker
  details</strong>\r\n\r\nYves Peters is a [typo]graphic designer, writer about type,
  rock drummer and father of three. After a three-year stint as type expert/technical
  advisor at the Belgian FontShop franchise, he was hired by communication agency
  Making Magazines, now Magelaan.\r\n\r\nYves joined the Typophile community in 2002,
  where he currently is head moderator of the Type Identification Board. Besides reviewing
  typefaces for David John Earls\u2019 Typographer.org, Yves edits Unzipped \u2013
  his blog for FontShop Benelux \u2013 and makes occasional contributions to Typographica
  and The FontFeed. Together with Stephen Coles, he is responsible for cross-referencing
  the current edition of FontBook.\r\n\r\nHis talent for being able to identify most
  typefaces on sight is utterly useless in daily life."
