  typography designers used in the 1960s (in books, posters etc.) \r\n\r\nOr name
  some particular typefaces?\r\n\r\nThanks."

    and The Art of Modern Rock which would have good examples for posters.

  body: "The Techni-Process Lettering Catalog, which bowfin cites on his website,
    is an excellent journey through the world of \u201960s typography. Large ad agencies
    keep libraries of their tear sheets, which they may be kind enough to allow you
    to peruse, and any large library will have, at least, microfiche copies of \u201960s
    magazines and newspapers.\r\n\r\nPerhaps easiest to obtain, Amazon is selling
    a 4-DVD set that contains every page of every issue of <em>Rolling Stone</em>,
    including the ads, for $53.44. Yes, the magazine began publishing in 1969, but
    the seventies didn\u2019t truly arrive until the dawn of disco:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Rolling-Stone-Cover-First-Years/dp/0979526108 "
