body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI have a question regarding the (huge) difference between the
  price of certain ITC and Monotype fonts at Linotype and ITC/Fonts.com respectively.
  For instance the MT Photina family costs 162 EUR at Fonts.com and ITC whilst costing
  a whopping 259 EUR at Linotype... I find this hard to understand because they are
  all part of the same company. Can anyone explain these price differences?\r\n\r\nOn
  a related note: why do they not all the same versions of the fonts (ITC might offer
  an OTF version, whereas Linotype doesn't) and why is Linotype the only one to support
  Paypal?\r\n\r\nThanks for your reply\r\n\r\nJeffrey"

    seemed to be accidental.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/216008/photina-valuepack.html\">Linotype\u2019s
    Photina Pro Volume</a> for \u20AC 259 does not contain the same fonts as <a href=\"http://www.fonts.com/FindFonts/detail.htm?pid=242758&cur=EUR\">Monotype\u2019s
    Photina\xAE Complete Family Pack</a> for \u20AC 162. Linotype\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/1697-21121/opentypecharactersetsopentypepro.html\">OpenType
    Pro</a> has a wider language support.\r\nF"

    are right about the pricing, my bad... That explains it. Thanks!"
