body: "Alright, InDy is my b***h, but I can't crack this one: the resize icons and
  other features are missing from the bottom of the Glyph palette. It disappeared
  about a week ago, and I can't get it back. I've tried opening from the \"Type\"
  menu, from the \"Window\" menu; had it in the palette dock, ripped it out. Checked
  out the fly-out menu on the glyph palette. Nothting. App and OS restarts aplenty,
  too. \r\n\r\nI never considered it to be too important, but I really miss this feature!
  Any ideas?\r\n\r\nID CS3 on Mac OS X.4.11 (Intel).\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for
  any help.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Ha! I accidentally clicked the show/hide button (the up-and-down arrows to
    the immediate left of the word \"Glyph\" on the tab). They don't normally hide
    the stuff at the bottom (nor are they supposed to), but my inadvertent click revealed
    it. Sweet!\r\n\r\n"
