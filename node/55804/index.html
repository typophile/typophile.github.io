It's just a modified helvetica bold oblique (although my mock is in myriad), with a couple of cheesy "speed" angles coming off it. Just the sort of thing you'd get from a cheap signage shop. 

There are many similar faces out there on free-fonts sites, but they're all much busier. This one really is as simple as it looks. Just basic, clean, and tacky.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, you have only showed a mock of what you saw. Do you want suggestions for other 'speedy' lettering in the hopes it will match the original 'cheap signage'?


You said you have searched the freebies, so maybe it's possible what you saw is a commercial font, like [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/slipstream/|Slipstream]].

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for helping. I know a fair amount about type but have been unable to track down this exact face; the mock is very faithful to the original. People here seem quite good at IDing, so I'd hoped it might make an enjoyable challenge for the best among you.

I've searched commercial sites and free alike and had encountered Slipstream. Unlike Slipstream, which I know is derived from Futura, the one I saw is definitely just a modified Helvetica bold. I called it a 'cheap signage' font because I honestly doubt that serious typographers are likely to use it often. 

Nevertheless I admired how clean it was. Unlike Slipstream and others, it doesn't try to create the effect of a gradient. The protrusions really are as simple as they appear in the mock, although they might vary slightly in number or placement. The mock is very faithful, athough I did use Myriad for it ;-)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The mock really does look almost exactly like the original. Wind, like the others, is part of the same family but not a match. Thank you, though. 

I also doubt it was custom work; it was for a sign that just said "DRIVE THRU," not for a logo; I doubt a small business in the country would go to that much effort. 

I might have to track down the place where I saw it. That should be tough but it might be doable. Thanks again to both of you for trying to help.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">If your sense is that they wouldn't go to the trouble to customize their own sign, then they might also be too cheap to license a font for doing it, so the freebie world is the likely source. in that case, good luck, because there are millions of 'em. Your best shot would be to find them again and ask what they used.
