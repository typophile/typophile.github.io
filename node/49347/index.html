<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Just been thinking about cedilla options. Microsoft typography says this...
<dd>
Under comma and cedilla
The under comma is the preferred form in the Romanian language for the uppercase characters S and T with under comma accent and lowercase s and t with under comma accent. Four new Unicode values have been defined to accommodate this preference: Scommaaccent U+0218 ; scommaaccent U+0219 ; Tcommaaccent U+021A ; tcommaaccent U+021B
The connecting cedilla is the preferred form in the Turkish language for the uppercase S with cedilla and lowercase s with cedilla: Scedilla U+015E ; scedilla U+015F
An under comma is an acceptable alternative to a connecting cedilla for the following characters: Ccedilla U+00c7 ; ccedilla U+00e7 ; Kcedilla U+0136 ; kcedilla U+0137 ; Lcedilla U+013b ; lcedilla U+013c ; Ncedilla U+0145 ; ncedilla U+0146 ; Rcedilla U+0156 ; rcedilla U+0157 ; Tcedilla U+0162 ; tcedilla U+0163
In the Portuguese and Catalan languages the traditional connecting style of a cedilla is more commonly preferred for the Ccedilla U+00c7 and ccedilla U+00e7.
It is common in modern designs and French typography to see a cedilla design with a stroke that is not connecting or as in common handwriting, a line that passes through the bottom or beneath the uppercase or lowercase c.
</dd>
Are Microsoft right, should I do what they say?
Who is the authority on cedillas?
Does my cedilla have to be a traditional shape? Would an undercomma-style cedilla on my ccedilla and scedilla offend or upset French/Turkish/Portuguese/anyone else? Should I just knuckle down and design a traditional cedilla that connects with the c and s?
</div>
<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Nick, I am no authority on cedillas, but I would stick with what is stated in the paragraphs you quoted... If you check out the <a href=http://unicode.org/charts/><strong>Unicode Code Charts</strong></a>, you will find the same info regarding when to use each kind of glyph (cedilla and undercomma). Also, have a look at the info on the origin of the cedilla shape here:

<div class=commentbody>"is the traditional cedilla being slowly usurped by the undercomma"
I don't think so. There have been language differences for many years. Different countries have their traditional ways. The American spelling of color without the u has not prevented the Britts from using their chosen spelling. Likewise, the use of diacritics will continue to vary with the country in question. Different strokes...

<div class=commentbody>Soho's cedilla is more angled than its combining comma. The combining comma maintains more or less the angle of, well, the comma, but the cedilla has an angle more akin the to acute.
I didn't have an under-acute to compare with, but the comma, undercomma, and overcomma all have roughly the same angle, whereas the cedilla and the acute roughly share a different angle. The blue lines in this picture just border the mark, the dashed red line is the same angle for each and passes through the middle of the accents. (for reference, it's comma, n-undercomma, c-cedilla, a-acute, g-reversecomma)

<div class=commentbody>Well, as Portuguese, I have to reply to this one.
Cedillas are not undercommas, so they should be distinctive. A undercomma looks like a comma, and cedillas look like a vertically flipped question mark ("?"), without the dot.
So, the article you have is ALMOST right. Albeit in Portuguese or Catalan we don't use undercommas and would immediately read a "c" with an undercomma as a "ç", I believe that we should use a undercomma as an stylistic option for two reasons:
- Undercommas and cedillas have different origins, so they should be distinctive (as a cultural mark);
- With the normalization on a Western alphabet of fonetic transcriptions of non-western-native languages, these two could be used in the same language.
It saddens me that Soho, which is such a nice font, doesn't have proper cedillas.
Hope that I've helped.</div>

No.
What you're showing in Soho is just wrong. (A surprise in an otherwise admirable typeface.)
(Note: The above statement should not be taken to mean that I have done a perfect job in language sensitivity of diacritics, myself. The initial release of Hypatia Sans has overly steep acute accents for Czech, when they should have been restricted to only Polish. This has been corrected for the regular retail release, whenever that ends up being.)

That question is asking for factual answers; I have no statistics but those fonts with detached cedillas under the c are indeed being used.
First, here is from a Herzing College advertisement I photographed a few minutes ago in the Montreal metro. Those are big letters, on top of the advertisement:

And here is from the cover of the recently published French translation (in France) of <a href="http://livre.fnac.com/a2345919/James-Meek-Nous-commencons-notre-descente?PID=7929">James Meek, Beginning of our Descent</a>.

<a href=http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/lucasfonts/themix_plain/>TheMix Plain</a> is used for advitersement by <a href="http://www.fido.ca/web/Fido.portal?lang=en">Fido</a>, a local communication provider, and they don't prevent from using a big "c cedilla" when needed.

These images, taken from Linotype's <a href=http://www.linotype.com/5324/eurostilenext.html>Eurostile Next font feature</a>, come with these comments:
<cite>Eurostile Next also contains a rethinking of the fonts’ accents and special characters. In previous decades, these symbols were unfortunately not considered as important as they are today, when fonts are marketed to a global audience instead of primarily to Western Europeans and North Americans.</cite>
The first two letters of each of these images represent cedillas. So it looks like the departure from the traditional shape for the cedilla is presented here as an improvement for the global audience. I'm not sure what to think of this.</div>

<div class=commentbody>very interesting. P22 Underground Pro has both, but the comma form as the default. in my research here for my dissertation, i have found that language specific preferences for forms are not always hard and fast. these types of considerations usually come down to the tastes of the user. in my opinion, options like these may be better served as stylistic alternates or sets, especially where there is some debate about what forms are appropriate as in this case, or in the case of 'Bulgarian' forms for cyrillic, or in the case of language specific forms for Hindi, Marathi, and Nepali. another argument for stylistic alternates/sets is that major languages are not confined to one geographical location and are not bound by a single culture. native French and French-speaking Canadians will likely have different customs for how they use different forms, as will native Spanish and Spanish speakers from the americas, &c. so in my opinion, it doesn't really matter which form you use as a default, as long as you are aware that there are other options and that you make these options available to the user. of course this is tricky with the current state of application support... but that onus is upon others and not typeface designers.</div>

Paul - Not really, let me disagree with you. Imagine that you are Portuguese and you use cedillas quite often. You press your "ç" button on your keyboard (yes, we use it that much that we need a specific button) and you get a "c" with a undercomma. Not good. It should be default, if it is cedilla.
First function, then form, only after stylistic narcissism. So, alternatives should be the new, default should be the old.
Jong - Well, that case isn't so violent. Undercommas are vertical and cedillas, because of the semi-circle shape, seem more diagonal. In fact, in writing, most people use a quarter of circle (right-bottom quarter), connected to the base.
But it could be better, indeed.</div>

<div class=commentbody><em>Not good. It should be default, if it is cedilla.</em>
if you're Portuguese and your preference is for the connected variety, this is not good, but say you are French and prefer the disconnected version, it is very good. This was the crux of my whole post above. It would be a pain in the arse to make different font versions for every language that has a different preference, so these things should be included as stylistic sets. If there is ONE form agreed upon by all members who use a particular language, then this is easily implemented in OpenType so that if you set the language of your document, the correct form is applied automatically. Given, not all applications support OpenType, but it is assumed that those who care enough about these distinctions have more sophisticated software that can cope with these things.
<em>So, alternatives should be the new, default should be the old.</em>
This is tantamount to cultural narcissism.
New ≠ Bad, and Old ≠ Good. It's not that simple.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Paul - Sorry again, but it's incorrect the claim that French prefer the disconnected version. The unconnected version is gaining ground because of new fonts having non-conventional (or even bad) cedillas. And as I said before, since French, Catalan or Portuguese DON'T have the undercomma accent, we naturally read it as a cedilla. But a undercomma is never a cedilla. And a Romenian while learning Catalan shouldn't be confused.
And yes, there is one agreed form for the cedilla, as well as different Unicode entries for both accents.
<cite>Given, not all applications support OpenType, but it is assumed that those who care enough about these distinctions have more sophisticated software that can cope with these things.</cite>
We don't have more sofisticated softwares, we simply have different keyboards. With cedillas. Or undercommas. Or even ogoneks. Or combinations of these glyphs/accents.
<cite>This is tantamount to cultural narcissism.
New ≠ Bad, and Old ≠ Good. It’s not that simple.</cite>
No one has made assumptions has that one. It's more like a Old = Settled and Less Ambiguous / New = Breakthrough, Forwardthinking and probably Naïve. It's not a black and white thing.
So, my point is: As swashes are additional features but still need the "default" glyphs, stylistic accents are additional features and DO demand the default accents.
Thanks for questioning, hope that this helped.
Edit:
There are unconnected versions of cedillas that still look as cedillas.</div>

I think that's what the editor wanted to have on display. Whether it is a sin or not is not for me to decide. I just searched for the word "ação" (in fact, for some unknown reason I had to type "acção") in the site http://www.livrariasaraiva.com.br

<div class=commentbody>Michel - Well, there are some differences between Brazilian Portuguese and European Portuguese. "Ação" is Brazilian, "acção" European. As you see, we read it as a cedilla.
And it can be an accident. As I said, we don't have undercommas. Neither Brazilians do. And most of the people, even editors, don't know of undercomma as being different from cedillas.
[[http://www.typefacedesign.org/|Check Paul Hunt's cedillas in Grandia]]. They are stylistically uncommon but still very functional and unambiguous.

<div class=commentbody><em>it’s incorrect the claim that French prefer the disconnected version</em>
i didn't mean to imply that all French prefer one version or the other, that's counter to my argument. I'm sure there are speakers of French, Portuguese, and Catalan that prefer one version and those that prefer another.
<em>there is one agreed form for the cedilla</em>
this is the part i don't believe. it is true that Unicode encodes these separately, but they do NOT prescribe acceptable forms for what these should look like. Unicode also encodes other characters that may be visually identical (Eth & Dcroat) saying there is one form of cedilla is just the same as saying there is one form for a (two storey and the one storey is unacceptable!) but this is simply not true. If there were only one way to display each symbol, we would only have one font, right?
<em>It’s more like a Old = Settled and Less Ambiguous / New = Breakthrough, Forwardthinking and probably Naïve</em>
i don't mind being considered naïve, but i try to educate myself as best as possible before making decisions in matters such as these. it IS a more than a bit naïve to believe anything you read on wikipedia at face value, so i'll take that with a grain of salt.
re: Grandia. Thank you!

<div class=commentbody>Fábio Martins --
<cite>And as I said before, since French, Catalan or Portuguese DON'T have the undercomma accent, we naturally read it as a cedilla. But a undercomma is never a cedilla.</cite>
<cite>And most of the people, even editors, don’t know of undercomma as being different from cedillas.</cite>
Why then insist on designing different ones?
As long as a language only knows either cedilla or commaaccent but not both, the actual difference or non-difference between them does not matter as long as it is clear -- in contrast to yet <em>other</em> diacritic marks -- that within a text of this language, a certain shape stands for cedilla, or commaaccent.
Paul Hunt's interpretation of cedilla is particularly interesting in this regard. Think of it as todays zigzag z shape, slightly rotated, rather than the round one which not in use any more (illustration from Mr Cordoba's <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedilla target=_blank>Wikipedia link</a>). The only difference between this cedilla and commaaccent is connection vs non-connection. Now imagine the cedilla being unconnected (i.e. the commaaccent) but closer to the letter, and all this printed at 10pt. I bet that while reading you would not notice that they are unconnected except if you were told before.
Personally I think that internationalization of type design, the need to cover more and more diacritic letter, goes hand in hand with "evening out" of national peculiarities. Cedilla vs commaaccent. Flat vs steep acute/grave.
Personally I am more and more reluctant to make statements about what French or Portugese or Turks or Germans "want to see". Actually designers can get away with quite uncommon solutions that are not wrong at all, and without anybody noticing as long as it is still clear what a word or text means. In Germany you will find Turkish shops that use a dot instead of cedilla below c/s, or macron/dot instead of breve above yumusak g.
This does not mean that typographers and type designers should stop caring. It is us who keep up typographic quality. And by choosing one or another letterform we even make a statement about its assumed origin. (E.g. the shape of eszett exhibits whether it was interpreted as longs+s, longs+z or longs+diacritic mark, none of them being "wrong".) Yet we should be pragmatic and not insist on certain rules just to show off that we belongs to those "who know".
P.S.
Looks like this was a very good year both for KABK and Reading.

<div class=commentbody>Paul, K.L. - OK, I was not fully understanding your point (Paul), so excuse me for this. I was trying to make note that (ideologically) cedillas and undercommas should be distinctive.
While I was away, I saw the portuguese translation that my girlfriend has of the Pantanjali's Yoga Sûtra (in Sanskrit, phonetic translation and portuguese), and could stop noticing that cedillas and undercommas are used in the same text.
I noticed also that I left the impression that cedillas should be connected. No, I don't believe in this as I oppose to the idea that all is already made, and that we can't improve anything. Again, I am just trying to imprint that these accents should be distinctive, as they can appear side-by-side.
Oh, and about narcissism and naïveness, I wasn't trying to pull the depreciative mood of the words.
Nick - See the serif on top of the crescent shape? That's related to the cedilla form, so it's a cedilla. And it's distinct from the comma (assuming that would be like the apostrofe. Thanks for posting the image.</div>

Here are a few of my recent efforts.
In general, I would seem to follow the principle that the comma accent should look like the comma, and the cedilla should be connected, pace Didot.
In several, it's practically impossible to differentiate the two accents in normal reading of book-sized text, so Romanians studying Catalan should keep a magnifying glass handy :-)</div>

i'm sorry if i used a bit of overemotive language. all apologies.
<em>that these accents should be distinctive, as they can appear side-by-side</em>
not that i don't believe you, but can you name some instances?
<em>I would seem to follow the principle that the comma accent should look like the comma, and the cedilla should be connected, pace Didot</em>
i tend to follow the principle that the comma accent should look like a cedilla without the connecting portion and typically do connect cedillas, unless the style suits a disjointed version better and then i do provide the option for connecting cedillas for those who want to use them. i believe the original (metal) Nicholas Cochin typeface featured a disconnected cedilla as well... i don't have time to verify this at this moment, though.</div>

<div class=commentbody>My hope is that the language tag would cause the proper form to be used by the software--assuming the type designer has included both in the font. The problem comes with differences that are cultural and not language based as noted by Paul's words about French vs Canadian French and Brazilian vs Portuguese. Hopefully language tags can become more specific to get around this.

<div class=commentbody>As far as I know, the following languages either use a cedilla for ç, ş or both.
<ul><li>Western & Central Romance: French, Portuguese, Catalan, Occitan, Venetian, Ligurian, etc.</li>
<li>certain Basque dialects</li>
<li>Turkic: Turkish, Azerbaijani, Turkmen, etc.</li></ul>
Languages which use a comma accent are: Romanian (ș ț), Latvian (Ģ ķ ļ ņ), Livonian (ņ ț ḑ ŗ ļ). Even though the Unicode standard labels characters such as Ņ as N WITH CEDILLA, I’m fairly sure that they should look like comma accents, but it would be canonically equivalent to N + COMBINING CEDILLA.
Therefore,
<ul><li> Ccedilla, Scedilla, and Tcedilla would be drawn with a cedilla and be equivalent to Character + combining cedilla.</li>
<li>Scommaaccent and Tcommaaccent would be drawn with a comma accent and be equivalent to Character + combining comma below</li>
<li>Gcedilla, Kcedilla, Lcedilla, and Ncedilla would be drawn with a comma accent and be equivalent to Character + combining cedilla.</li></ul>
All this said, pre-Vista Romanian keyboard layouts for Windows incorrectly mapped ș and ț as cedillas, so there are a lot of Romanian documents floating around with cedillas instead of comma accents.

<div class=commentbody>French uses the ccedilla i.e. U+00E7 giving rise to the following lines in the Unicode file <a href=http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/NamesList.txt>NamesList.txt</a>
<code>
00E7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LATIN SMALL LETTER C WITH CEDILLA
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;: 0063 0327
0327 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COMBINING CEDILLA
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* French, Turkish, Azerbaijani
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x (cedilla - 00B8)
</code>
The only diacritic that goes under any letter in French must be a cedilla and must then be under a c. The logical consequence is that if you see some diacritic under a c in French, that must be a cedilla.
In order to see how cedillas may actually look like in French, one can search for <a href="http://recherche.fnac.com/search/quick.do?text=fran%E7ais&category=book&bl=HGACrera&submitbtn=Okj">books with the word "Français"</a> (i.e. French) in the FNAC site (a major French book store) so as to see the cover of a few books to learn or teach French in schools. And here are a few (I am not saying they are representative, but those texts are from major publishers) :

If I look only at those textbooks on top of the search list, to be used in schools, and for which I can get an image large enough to be sure, I get 8 detached against 18 attached cedillas, but publishers tend to be consistent and it would be unwise to draw clear cut conclusions from such a small sample. All those covers are also clearly in a casual style but they may help guessing what people think is a cedilla in French, especially when the cover is hand drawn. As an additional indicator, I have never seen a detached cedilla in a serif font (in French).
@ Nuno
Larousse is a highly respected publisher of dictionaries and here is what figures on the cover of their dictionary of middle french:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/moyen_5435.jpg]
I guess the Presses Universitaires de France** are more of a reference in terms of typography. For their catalogue of the "Que Sais-je?" collection, they use QuaySansEF and here is the ccedilla:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ccedilla_5250.jpg]
This time the attachment stem is clearly there but where is the cedilla? :) That ccedilla figures in the text, and at 8pt size.

<div class=commentbody>You may have a point there, but again... I don't have any idea about why those guys did it. What I know is that in Portuguese Catalan and Turkish the under comma doesn't even exist, "ç" is a solo character.
For non cedilla users it looks just the same and can be seen only as a matter of style... but it's not. I can even compare it with the classic clash between double quotes and the inches... well to you it may have a great matter of importance but to some of us portuguese... we always use it the wrong way... now... is it a matter of style? Or maybe it's because we don't use it like the english do? I could print screen a million of books that are using the inch character instead of the quote, and that wouldnt prove much.
Cedilla is one thing and the under comma is another. The correct way to represent it is clear, but how people do it it's not under no ones control.

<div class=commentbody>I stand corrected: obviously there is quite a bit of usage of detached cedillas and other forms quite different from traditional cedillas.
It would be interesting to understand in what contexts (if any) having poor distinction between cedilla and comma or macron and tilde actually matters. I'm wondering if there are languages or phonetic usages where these newfangled approaches would be ambiguous.</div>

<div class=commentbody>To Ricardo:
They teach it properly, but as you grow up you tend to distort it(as well as many other letters)and make variations like a small straight line that barely touches the C or even crosses it, almost a dot and so on.
To Michael:
I don't even know that Newspaper it's probably a local one... but that doesn't matter, what matter is that, the ones making these changes are probably the typographers that don't use the cedilla. If you check the Dax you just posted, for me its ok, its like a simplified version of the cedilla but not a comma, i would even say that they know what a cedilla is when they designed the typeface (joke). Now... only a small number of people could have this discussion and actually care about it cus in fact... i never ever thought about this "problem" and i really don't care much to say the truth cus no matter how you make a cedilla or a tilde it will always me a cedilla and a tilde... it's like Obama said the other day... a pig with lipstick is still a pig. Being Portuguese, adopted by Catalans and had a Turkish girlfriend ( and have family in France lol) this is pretty clear to me :)
To Thomas:
Actually having it detached doesn't change it at all because people recognize it as a "Ç" always and if you check the Turkish alphabet that has a lot of cedillas and under commas... the letters that have a cedilla don't have a under comma and so on... so even if you during handwriting make no difference between the under comma and the cedilla it will always be read correctly. As for Romanian... there's always the context to help reading it properly. Almost all Romanian computer texts still use S-cedilla or even S instead of the under comma S because the character simply didn't existed in unicode.
here is my opinion :) I think I don't have much more to say or else i will repeat myself :P

<div class=commentbody>> <cite>I have never seen a detached cedilla in a serif font (in French).</cite>
I am sure I have never seen a French text typeset in Goudy Old Style. Here is how that looks on my mac:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/goudy_6138.jpg]
For me, that one looks quite weird; I can't see that thing under the c as a cedilla, I see it a comma even if the only possible diacritic under a c in French is a cedilla. As for Eurostyle or Futura, I see no problem; their detached and unadorned cedilla allows a much larger freedom of interpretation.
By the way, if you are on a Mac and use "Show character palette", View: Roman, Accented Latin and click on the ç on the right, you will see all the ccedillas of all the fonts installed on you mac in the bottom pannel; I was surprised by Adobe's Rosewood ccedilla.

<div class=commentbody>You mean Goudy Old Style's comma? Here it is with the cedillas.
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/goudy_5455.jpg]
At that size, things seem to look better.
By the way, in his book <em>The palaeography of Gothic manuscript books: from the twelfth to the early sixteenth century</em>, Albert Derolez describes on page 173 a script he calls "Iberian Hybrida" (a gothic script used in Spain and Portugal) saying
<dl>
<dd>
Iberian Hybrida is also marked by the form of the <strong>c</strong> caudata (<strong>ç</strong>, which was used as an alternative to <strong>z</strong>): the cedilla was placed well below the baseline and is unconnected to the <strong>c</strong> (26)
</dd>
</dl>

How do you know? There are slides from <a href=http://florian.hardwig.com/manuscribe/>Florian Hardwig's manuscribe project</a> that show that the way children are taught to write letters can vary a lot from country to country.
<cite>What you just showed us is just wrong.</cite>
The question here is not what is right and what is wrong but what is true and what is false. Is the statement "Some (many?) schools in Portugal teach children to draw cedillas as in the font <a href=http://tipografos.net/fonts/letra-escolar.html>Escolar Portugal</a> true or false? The above grab of "Escolar Portugal" corresponds to the glifos + exemplos (<a href=.http://tipografos.net/fonts/Escolar-specimen.pdf>pdf 280 K</a>) on the font site.

I think this differentiation is artificial. I see no reason for it to exist. I personally have no preference over one or the other. They're both acceptable, legible, readable and intelligible as a 'ccedilla'.
In practice, the cedilla in people's day-to-day handwriting is a basic downward (slightly curved) stroke under the 'c', either attached or unattached. FWIW, I can't remember the last time I wrote a hook-like cedilla on my c's, but I certainly do it in my glyphs.</div>

There isn't much of a question here, really. lula_assasina's right too - the portuguese language has not adopted undercommas, only cedillas. If, by definition, cedillas connect to the character, then it seems pretty clear that the cedilla should, well, actually connect to the character. The fact that typefaces might be designed without that concern hardly means they're not wrong.
Anyway, I'm familiar with the teaching methods for the early stages in portuguese education and can say that we do teach our kids to write connected cedillas, so it's a yes to your question.</div>

Miguel, I often find that hooked cedillas on fat fonts look weird. Here is a cedilla that I find bold and honest without being disturbing:

<div class=commentbody>Let me just be clear about one thing: cedillas and undercommas have different origins. Cedillas come from the Visigothic "z", which has a peculiar connected hook shape. Visigoths occupied the whole Iberian Peninsula.
Undercommas appeared in the <em>Buda Lexicon</em>, in Romania, 1825, in order resolve <em>in graphya</em> Romanian missing sounds.</div>

Let me also be clear on one thing. If undercommas appeared in 1825, then they could not exist in 1482. Now, here is a font that was used in the <a href=http://www.ndl.go.jp/incunabula/e/collection/incu_08.html>Ratdolt 1482 edition of <cite>Elementa Geometriae</cite> by Euclid</a> and that corresponds to the link <a href=http://www.ndl.go.jp/incunabula/e/font/0564-t01.html>Typ.1:109R</a> (from the preceding link).
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/radtolt_6357.gif]
Consequently the glyph that is at the right of the c in Ratdolt's font cannot be that a "c undercomma".

Re-checked and <em>Buda Lexicon</em> has the proposition to include undercommas in the letters "s" and "t" in Romanian.
Then again, they still have different origins.

Welcome. I had other interesting things but I don't know where I put them. I have at least this link http://www.danteonline.it/english/codici_indice.htm where can be found manuscripts of Dante's Divine Comedy dating from the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. The first words "Nel mezzo" are sometimes written "Nel meçço", or "Nel meço" and the cedilla can take a wide variety of shapes. Here is a grab from the first page of <a href="http://www.danteonline.it/english/codici_frames/codici.asp?idcod=147">this manuscript</a>; look at the cedilla in red and the two in the word mezzo!
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mezzo_4220.jpg]
It seems that printing had a normalizing influence on Italian spelling. I could not find a single cedilla in incunabila of the Divine Comedy (but maybe I did not search hard enough...)

It would be nice to have access to one of the high resolution versions. In the word bençã[o] above, it is hard to believe that there is ink between the c and the black diacritic. Is it possible the titling was attached and the regular detached? Else I would imagine an extremely fine line that would be beautiful in digital type but that would probably print with difficulty if the metal character is not melted properly.

<div class=commentbody>I think you are right about this font.

<div class=commentbody>I found the files I was looking for. The cedillas come from a hand written text (in Spanish). The source is "Documents of the Hispanic Southwest: The Expedition of Francisco Vásquez de Coronado 1540-1542", Jerry R. Craddock (<a href="http://repositories.cdlib.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1011&context=rcrs_ias_ucb">pdf 9.8MB</a>). The document is concerned with palaeography and displays some fantastic cedillas. Here are a few grabs.

<div class=commentbody>I found a better scan of the grammar (<a href=http://purl.pt/12148/3/res-5658-1-p_PDF/res-5658-1-p_PDF_01-B-R0300/res-5658-1-p_0000_capa-60v_t01-B-R0300.pdf>pdf 5.8MB</a>). Here is what I get for the above grab (this time on page 30 on 124 of the pdf file instead of page 13v).
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/aformacao_5550.jpg]
The attachment I had imagined on the first c does not seem to be there; it is just the c that seems to have been more inked. On the other hand, the attachment on the e is clearly there and there seems to be no problem with any of the "e caudata". It is now my feeling the cedilla is not attached in that font.

<div class=commentbody><cite>Cedillas come from the Visigothic “z”, which has a peculiar connected hook shape.</cite> [Fábio Martins, o Lula Assassina]
Here is the Visigothic "z" in Juan-José Marcos' (Professor of classical languages) <a href=http://guindo.pntic.mec.es/~jmag0042/palefont.html><strong>Paleographic Fonts for Latin Script</strong></a>; this is a grab from page 27 (bottom) of his font sample file (<a href="http://guindo.pntic.mec.es/~jmag0042/ingles.php?d=LATIN_PALEOGRAPHY.pdf">pdf, 3.15 MB</a>).

It does not look like a digit "3" fused at the bottom of a "c" that would have shrunk to give a cedilla like the <a href=http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fichier:Visigothic_Z-C_cedille.svg>svg Wiki figure</a>.

<div class=commentbody>On the other hand, it is in my opinion rather clear from the text of the grammar itself that de Barros did not know the origin of the letter "ç" (the print is dated M.D.XL., 1540). Indeed, on page 10 of the pdf file (<a href=http://purl.pt/12148/3/res-5658-1-p_PDF/res-5658-1-p_PDF_01-B-R0300/res-5658-1-p_0000_capa-60v_t01-B-R0300.pdf>pdf 5.8MB</a>) (leaf 3 verso, only rectos were numbered), he writes
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gramp10_6528.jpg]
That I understand to mean
<dl>
<dd>
And likewise we have that letter "ç" that appears to be an invention of the Hebrew or Moorish pronunciation.
</dd>
</dl>
(correct me if I am not faithful to the author) and he repeats on leaf 46 recto (page 95 of the pdf file):
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/46recto_5491.jpg]
where I understand that "ouuęmos" (with a nice "e ogonek" that may cause display problems) stands for "houvemos" (It appears to us that we got those letters from the Moors).
I am aware that the "ç" that was used in Italian and Spanish are now written "z" [**] and the few books on palaeography that I have seen state that the letter "ç" derives from the Visigothic letter "z". I have never seen references though. May I thus ask the question: who is the first to have stated it. Where is it soundly argumented?
Michel
[**] I know neither Spanish nor Italian. I think the old "ç" may now just be "c" in Spanish. However, the directives for transcribing Dante's Comedy were stating to always write "ç" and not "z" when a cedilla was used in the manuscript and I concluded that in Italian, a "ç" automatically became a "z" in the modern spelling.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Could anyone provide some insight into this lcommaccent/lcedilla ?
On this page: <a href="http://diacritics.typo.cz/index.php?id=9">Comma Accent</a>, I see an lcommaccent in the first sentence: ļ
But when I copied it to Google search, I noticed it is rendered as a lcedilla – I realise this is because it is in Arial, and Arial's lcommaccent glyph has an lcedilla inside it.
Checking further I saw that /Gcommaaccent /Kcommaaccent /kcommaaccent /Lcommaaccent /lcommaaccent /Ncommaaccent /ncommaaccent /Rcommaaccent /rcommaaccent /kcommaaccent /lcommaaccent /ncommaaccent /rcommaaccent
<em>all</em> have cedillas in Arial (though Arial Unicode shows commaaccents glyphs), like the page says "It is easy to come across characters which have cedilla in place of a correct comma accent".
Checking to see other modern/recent fonts, I saw they all display a commaaccent inside the glyphs.
But not Segoe UI, all the *commaccent glyphs show commaccents except Lcommaccent (U+013B), it has a cedilla in it
<img src=http://s18.postimg.org/ig5rbkpjt/Screen_Shot_2014_07_03_at_7_35_58_PM.png>
Is there a particular reason/compromise for this or just an error?</div>

<div class=commentbody>It seems to me that there should be no reason for confusion here.
An undercomma is one accent, a cedilla is another.
But typefaces have different stylistic characteristics. So a particular modernistic typeface might have a disconnected cedilla. That's fine - it's a characteristic of the typeface, and if people find the typeface unattractive because of this characteristic, as for any other reason, they can use another one.
The only thing that makes it complicated is that, thanks to OpenType, typeface designers have the option of offering more than one form for characters. Well, that's a plus. Which one is the default? The one that corresponds to the designer's vision for the typeface; again, I'm hard put to argue against that in principle. It is, of course, incumbent on the designer to have a vision that accords to the requirements of his target market, and so one might wish to discourage overly self-indulgent experimentation... but some typefaces are going to be more avant-garde than others. (Personally, I incline to interest in conventional and traditional typefaces, but I don't want to label the people who make the other kind of typeface as 'bad'; we need display faces too.)
But this thread has brought up an issue of cultural consciousness - the problem isn't cultural sensitivity; it is not will that is lacking, it is that there is so much information to research, often not readily available - that gives another side to this argument. A disconnected cedilla might be pleasingly modernistic to the French, but to the Portuguese it might be hopelessly confusing.
So one uses language sensitivity in OpenType. And that would also make the accents slope more for Polish.
One problem is that OpenType support isn't the greatest in some applications. Type designers can't be expected to rewrite those applications, but they certainly <em>can</em> make available one font for every set of alternates where that alternate is the baseline.
This has a benefit when it comes to another problem. Just because there are many people in Brazil who aren't used to the disconnected cedilla, it does not mean that there won't be someone there who wants to use it for its shocking visual effect.
Language sensitivity leads to the situation where people might say "But they don't let me use the <em>real</em> Eurostile Next because I'm Brazilian"!
So, while I think that if a Century Schoolbook font transparently does what is conventional for every language using the Latin script according to its own local rules, there are likely to be few complaints, one cannot say that the same approach is unequivocally the best one for a display face.
It is good for the type designer to be as aware of the language issues as possible, but the end user of the font has to be allowed to break the rules and use the original appearance of the face instead if desired.</div>

Yes, that is very true. But, the language tag should make the first choice for what is normal for the particular language. The end user can always over ride that choice if he wants to.</div>

<div class=commentbody>@dezcom:
<cite>But, the language tag should make the first choice for what is normal for the particular language. The end user can always over ride that choice if he wants to.</cite>
Initially, I agreed with that, but now I'm not so sure.
If the typeface is a text face, and not a display one, that seems to be good advice.
Also, there's a question about what "normal" for a given language <em>means</em>. It is basic and fundamental that an ogonek is not a cedilla is not an undercomma. So one is indeed on very safe ground in saying that a typeface should not do things that look like nonsense or like ignorant errors in any given language.
When type designers are getting their information about what is normative for different languages from good sources, they will be able to get this right.
But I can easily imagine cases where, because of the difficulty, as yet, in getting complete information of this sort for all languages, people will study existing practice, and come to wrong conclusions. So, if in one language, a particular natively-designed typeface has happened to be popular, and its accent marks differed in some way from other Roman typefaces of the same period, that does not necessarily mean that it is expected that accent marks in all typefaces should look the same way.
Also, to some extent, the Latin script community is a single typographical community, not many different isolated national communities any longer. So attempts to meet the needs of different countries may end up in part being based on a false premise.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I am no font designer and I am happy not having to care for all the needs of eventual users. What I think is that the end user (let's say the typographer, or the "learned" end user) should be given appropriate tools to adjust the fonts to his needs (and be allowed to do so); and I think that FontForge is a good choice for such a tool. Let's take for instance the case of this thread: http://typophile.com/node/114436. All that is required is additional characters with dots or macrons above or under basic latin letters to produce Pali text. A simple copy and paste may produce the desired characters but then the kerning tables may need to be adjusted. Else some anchors may be added and a ccmp entry may decompose the glyph that is typed into a character and a combining diacritic that is then properly positioned by a Mark feature without having to care for the kerning (I think that is at least true for those Pali characters). Just stop taking end users for dummies and educate them instead of prohibiting them from exercising their “fundamental rights”.

Yes, but... unfortunately, errors in early versions of Unicode caused problems which echo forward to this day.
The problem is nothing to do with OpenType as such, but OpenType offers some interesting options for how to deal with it.</div>

<div class=commentbody>As I said above, Brazilians would recognize diverse shapes under c as cedilla, but as somewhat stylized one. The traditional, correct, and widely used form is the connected, hook-like cedilla.</div>

<div class=commentbody>This is an e with acute (é). Ogonek was never used in Portuguese.
Thus, why it was printed with an ogonek?
Portuguese is the younger Latin-based language and Portugal was a periferic country until the great navigations started in mid-1400s. As a consequence, Portuguese from XV Century still shows inconsistencies in ortography which were already solved in other languages by that time. And up to XVII Century we find improvisations in many printed documents due to a lack of proper fonts.
During this period, cedillas and tildes were available in insufficient number or simply absent. To produce them, printers used commas (under the c to get ç) and lowercase l (over a and o to get ã and õ). This explains samples were cedilla appears disconneted.
The sample above is also an adaptation using a font without Portuguese support. Besides the e with ogonek and the ss inconsistency, there also different acutes over o and a. As the language had not direct connection with German or Polish, it seems they printed this document as better as they could.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Sample:
Se preguntássem. De quem é esta árte de grammática?
pódesse responder, do principe nósso Senhor.
Modern Portuguese:
Se perguntassem: de quem é esta arte de gramática?
Pode-se responder: do príncipe nosso Senhor.
English:
If they ask – From whom is this grammatical art?
it could be answered – From our Lord, the Prince.
Besides the typographical issues, one can also note the inconsistent use of punctuation and the word "perguntar" (to ask) still wrote as in Spanish "preguntar". This shows we are handling not only a piece in archaic Portuguese, but a language still in formation with far from defined conventions and lexicography.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Ah. I had been looking around in other Portuguese books of the time period, and found no other instances of this accent; here is another piece from the book in question that does have it, with multiple examples:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/multiple_5801.jpg]
Seeing it in verbo, governa, rege, terra, republica, and Te made me suspect that something such as pied type from Poland was going on. Only rege and Te seemed like they might even get an accented e, though that was just wild guessing on my part.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yes, régẽ (regem) and tẽ (tem) use tilde in both cases. You can see how it varies through the sample and it is not a real tilde. Another example of improvisation.
Interesting is also note the use of i as j and u as v, a Latin heritage (uęrbo > vérbo; seiã > sejã; cõiunto > cõjunto). At a time when Europe was already defined the use of v and j long ago, Portuguese was still tied to this ancient ambiguity. In this period we also see the use of y at the end of words working as a long nasal i (sy > sim; assy > assim). Later, y was removed from Portuguese (it is used just in loan words).
In gouęruã there is a typo: it should be gouęrnã (govérnã).
A side historical information: Portugal was a country under severe Catholic influence, with the Holy Inquisition exerting an atrocious force. Up to the XVIII Century, one needed Church authorization to print any book. With so much control, the number of printed works was relatively small and very few fonts were made for Portuguese those old times.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I should note, too, that I do thank you for your information; in my previous post, I was not trying to take away your credit, but merely to note that when I came back with my new example, it made me less surprised at what you told me about the accented "e"s.
Incidentally, while looking through old Portuguese grammars for information, I noted that they only referred to the acute, grave, and circumflex accents as accents in Portuguese. But the corollary, referring to the letters with the cedilla and the tilde as additional letters in the alphabet, did not seem to be present.
I do also remember from Updike that he blamed the influence of the Inquisition for the sad state of Spanish typography in the early period.
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cedill_6452.jpg]
In my search, I also ran across a book partly in Portuguese (or perhaps Spanish) and partly in French which seems to have used a centered ogonek when they ran out of cedillas for the c... or, again, perhaps something else is going on: its title is Ordonnances Faictes par les Consulz de la Nation d'Espaigne.
So there you have it, another Iberian ogonek, this time on a c instead of an e.</div>

it simply seems that the printer did not have c with cedillas of that size. I would not take that book (printed in Bruges, West Flanders) as a model. It is about insurance policies for boats and is a translation to French of a text probably written in Spanish. The errata starts with “To my reader, the ignorance of the printer is cause of many mistakes of which this translation is full”.

<div class=commentbody>I did notice from a page preceding the one from which I took my sample that there were these unusual "c"s in a larger font size while there were normal cedillas in a smaller one. So I looked ahead for an example of the centered ogonek in the same size as the cedilla, and thought I found it.
I had assumed from the book's title that it was about Spain's diplomatic correspondence and treaties, rather than something so trivial. But given that the <em>other</em> book had the ogonek on the e because of error or a lack of the right type, I was indeed not claiming that it would be otherwise for this example.
And, yes, your sample seems to be from the right book.</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>This book is in Spanish, not Portuguese. As it is from 1568, it shows a Spanish quite different from the modern one. Unification of Castela and Aragon occurred in 1469 and during several decades Castilian was still in its path to become the axis of modern Spanish. Early Spanish has a much greater influence of Aragonese than today. And Aragonese shared some characteristics with Catalan and Provençal, including the cedilla.
In both Spanish and Portuguese, C sometimes acts as K (caballo, cola, culto), and sometimes as S (acero, cinta). In this book, cedilla/ogonek was used to mark these variations. All occurrences of c+a, c+o and c+u, where c works as k, are not marked with ogonek. All the other combinations use c with ogonek and there are both kind of c in the same line. So it is clearly a diacritical usage which was later abandoned in Spanish.
Regarding the old Portuguese grammars omission about cedilla and tilde: tilde was present since the very first incarnations of Portuguese. It came from Latin abbreviations for -um and -am. As there are extensive of nasalization in Portuguese, tilde become an integer part of the language since the beginning. So, I don't know why a grammar, even a very old one, would omit the tilde. It is an interesting issue and I would like very much to know more about these grammars.
In other hand, cedilla is not always called an 'accent' and it is usual to describe it as a special sign associated to c. This may explain the omission, but this is again a matter to deeper analysis.
Finally, I also thank you all for this discussion. It is always amazing to travel through so many centuries.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Well, the grammars I saw didn't omit the tilde - it was present in the Portuguese text in the exercises and examples; it just wasn't called an accent. I couldn't find where it was described in the outline of the Portuguese writing system.
Vieyra, on the other hand, mentions both the tilde and the cedilla -
[[http://books.google.ca/books?id=3hUTAAAAYAAJ]]
This one notes the til as an accent:

<div class=commentbody>The question here appears to be one of terminology, not of usage. For instance, in the current Wikipedia page on <a href=http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritiques_utilis%C3%A9s_en_fran%C3%A7ais>Diacritiques utilisés en français</a>, it is said that three accents and the tréma (diaeresis) are put above letters, and the cedilla is subscribed. The accents are acute, grave and circumflex. In the cnrtl dictionary, the <a href=http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/tr%C3%A9ma>tréma</a> is defined as a “signe orthographique” (orthographic sign), not an accent. That same terminology is used in the Petit Robert online dictionary.
I can see reasons why the trema may not be considered an accent in French (and Portuguese) since it it a contextual transformation; it restores normal pronunciation in a context where some letter would not be prononced; an interesting example is <em>ambiguïté</em> where the tréma on the letter <em>i</em> restores the sound of the letter <em>u</em> coming before it; I can see no reason for the tilde not to be considered an accent in Portuguese, though.
As for the cedilla, it affects a consonant, not a vowel; that is sufficient reason not to take it as an accent at least in the definition that is given to the word in French. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Michel, I agree that these incongruences in old grammars are probably just terminological variations through time. Portuguese is quite similar to French in this aspect, calling acute, grave, circumflex and tilde as accents. Dieresis was also called accent among us, but it was removed after the 2009 reform, already valid in Brazil but still not active in Portugal.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I found this interesting remark in <a href=http://www.filologia.org.br/revista/artigo/5(14)37-48.html>José Lemos Monteiro (UFC), "AS IDÉIAS GRAMATICAIS DE JOÃO DE BARROS"</a> taken from <a href=http://www.filologia.org.br/revista/14.html>Revista Philologus Ano 5 n° 14</a> (Also in Rev. de Letras, v 19, no 1/2, 1997, http://www.revistadeletras.ufc.br/rl19Art03.pdf).
<blockquote>
Outro aspecto que merece al­guma consideração diz respeito ao em­prego dos acentos e do til. Diversamente de Fernão de Oliveira, João de Barros considera o til como letra, talvez traído pela própria origem do símbolo. O til é interpretado como uma letra supletiva, para substituir o n, o m e o grupo ue:
...séruenos por estas tres leteras .m, ue, quando se põem sobre esta letera .q, ou sobre letera uogal (4 r).
...sérue em seu lugár [do m] til, a que podemos chamár soprime)to delle e do, n, como nestas dições, mandár, razám (47 v).
</blockquote>
Maybe the fact that João de Barros, in his <em>Gramática da Língua Portuguesa</em> published in 1540, was not considering the tilde as an accent had some repercussions.

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Just now I saw this thread. As a Brazilian, let me add some information.
As said above, cedilla is the <strong>only</strong> diacritic you find below a character in Portuguese. It's also used just with /c/ in /ça/ço/çu/ combinations. And it never begins a word. Besides this, our contact with Romanian and Turkish cultures are almost none, so Brazilians doesn't know there is a thing like commaccent.
Almost anything you put bellow a /c/ will be easily read as a cedilla in Brazilian Portuguese. It may be a cedilla, a commaccent, a straight line, an acute... all this will work because there is no other diacritic to be confused with cedilla. And also because cedilla usage, although common, is very specific.
Students learn to wrote cedilla as an upside-down hook.
To design and use disconnected cedillas is not an issue to Brazilians. But this is <strong>not a trend</strong> in Portuguese. It's just a variation in cedilla shape made possible due to local language and culture (I believe the same applies to Portugal). In other hand, disconnected cedillas in a traditional serif font may seem strange nowadays. Even if this was not unusual in 15th and 16th Centuries, later it seems to be changed to an always-connected-shape. Remember that Portuguese is a relatively new language if compared to other Romance ones. Its consolidation came just in late 1400s/early 1500s.
And, of course, many people may use wrong cedillas due to lack of knowledge about the commaccent existence. The book 'Ação de cobrança' cited above is a good example. I'm sure its editors have no idea they're using a commaccent-like cedilla, especially considering it's a Law book (Law books are usually badly designed here).
But if one designs a font with international support, both cedilla and commaccent clearly distinguished. The designer may even adopt a disconnected cedilla if this is suitable to general font style – but this cedilla still needs to by clearly different than a commaccent. A 'multi-purpose' diacritic seems not acceptable.
Finally, for me it's quite obvious that if one must observe the correct position and shape of other diacritics, as ogoneks, exactly the same applies to cedillas. Graphical similarity and some circumstantial wrong usage does not justify a font to mix up cedilla and commaccent.</div>
