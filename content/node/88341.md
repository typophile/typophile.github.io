  Border 2D is a collection of ornaments organized into four font files. The ornaments
  can be divided into two groups: Friezes (borders) and Rapports (patterns).\r\n\r\nAll
  the ornaments attribute to the period of Historicism, which prevailed in the art
  in the middle of 19th century. The ornaments are based on elements of architectural
  decorations of Lviv buildings in Ukraine. The author personally collected the material
  and embodied it in the font. This makes the font exclusive and unique among other
  digital collections of ornaments.\r\n\r\nThese patterns perfectly suit to be used
  in the design of invitations, diplomas, certificates or other printed materials
  in classic style design.\r\n\r\nMore samples in the [[http://issuu.com/2d-studio/docs/historismborder2d?mode=window&backgroundColor=%23222222|PDF]]file\r\n\r\non
