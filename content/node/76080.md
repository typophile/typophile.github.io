  body: "I tried whatTheFont on myFonts - didn't turn up anything very close. \r\n\r\nDeerfield
    looks slightly off to me, maybe even a bit stretched vertically? Also, check out
    the K here: \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/secondhome_k_5640.png]\r\n\r\n(also
    here: http://c0573862.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/1/0/25520/297660/SecondHome_4_1000.jpg)\r\n\r\nDefinitely
    different than the deerfield K"
