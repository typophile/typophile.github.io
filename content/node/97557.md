  body: "\"A BOLA\", as almost all newpaper mastheads, is most popbably a custom job
    or, at least, an existing typeface customized. You could start with some extended
    egyptian like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/giza/|Giza Five Seven]],
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/egyptian-slate/|Egyptian Slate]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/typodermic/|Typodermic]],
    mainly reworking /B and /O eyes.\r\nCan be wrong for \"O JOGO\" but to me, it
    has been done all for scratch, all letters recreated with a circle. If you need
    something close, try [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-avant-garde-gothic/|Avant-Garde
    Gothic]]"
