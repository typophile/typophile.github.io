body: "Hello all,\r\n\r\nFor my master's project I'm creating an electronic prototype
  of a printed Aleut-English dictionary.  The information in the dictionary is wonderful
  but many other things about the dictionary are not.  The dictionary's organization
  can be criticized on several levels, including typographically--at least, I think
  so.  But as my background is in linguistics and not design, I don't know where to
  find an authoritative source on this subject.  My searches on \"information design
  and dictionaries\" and \"information design and lexicography\" so far have either
  turned up dictionaries on information design or articles on how to structure lexical
  databases, which are not what I need.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for scholarly works that
  spell out fairly accepted principles of laying out information (specifically, bilingual
  dictionary entries with no pictures) in a way that guides users to what they're
  looking for.  I need these principles both in order to critique the existing dictionary
  and to guide the design of the computerized one.  At a minimum, some source that
  conveys ideas similar to \"presenting complex hierarchical information as dense
  running text is bad\" and \"an 8x10 inch page really deserves wider margins than
  three eighths of an inch\" would be really helpful.\r\n\r\nTypographic considerations
  constitute a very small part of my thesis, but they affect dictionary usability
  in a big way, so I hope to address at least the most major problems.  If anyone
  knows of sources that address the visual design of reference works specifically,
  that would be wonderful; but in any case I'd be grateful for anything that might
  come remotely close.\r\n\r\nAric"

  body: "Dear Aric,\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve been involved in a large number of dictionary
    projects together with Peter Matthias Noordzij and Bas Smidt at TEFF. A portfolio
    of this work can be seen at http://www.teff.nl/design/portfolio.html. You will
    notice that our approach to dictionary design is a pure typographical one, and
    that we place much emphasis on micro-typography; even the tiniest details in the
    text are the result of careful considerations. We also have developed custom technology
    to produce high quality typography in automated layout designs. Quite a lot of
    these types of books are produced with applications like Adobe Framemaker that
    are very inflexible from a typographical point of view.\r\n\r\nI am not aware
    of specific books about dictionary design although many wonderful books have been
    written about information design which to me are very helpful sources. I can particularly
    recommend to have a look at the series of books that Edward Tufte wrote on the
    subject.\r\n\r\nHope this helps."

  body: "Aric\r\n\r\nI think your first concern would be to find a font that will
    incorporate all the possible letterforms you will encounter.\r\n\r\nSecondly,
    you will want to ensure that you have a number of optically correct small text
    sizes for a balanced look to the varying elements of the descriptions.\r\n\r\nI've
    done a dictionary and a work, The Aldine Press (http://Bielerpressiii.blogspot.com),
    that required descriptive bibliographic entries (over 600 large format pages worth)
    in the past and that is the very best information I can give you.\r\n\r\nWith
    the appropriate font you have a great advantage typographically; most dictionaries
    and descriptive bibliographies are rarely considered in this regard.\r\n\r\nGerald"

  body: "I hope you\u2019ve thoroughly read <em>Making dictionaries: Preserving indigenous
    languages of the Americas</em>, William Frawley, Kenneth C. Hill, & Pamela Munro,
    eds., 2002, University of California Press, ISBN 0520229967. That text addresses
    more of the content and structure of dictionary design for indigenous languages
    than it does the form, but there is some discussion of form in there.\r\n\r\nFor
    dictionary design, my professors have recommended simply studying the dictionaries
    of many other languages and getting a feel for what works well and what doesn\u2019t.
    Also, especially in your case, you should examine the design of other Eskimo-Aleut
    and Paleosiberian dictionaries because those families present some difficult problems
    in dealing with long polysynthetic headwords.\r\n\r\nI heartily recommend giving
    the Elbert & Pukui dictionary of Hawaiian a good look, it\u2019s a great example
    of a very usable dictionary for an indigenous language. Also see Robert Young\u2019s
    dictionary of Navajo.\r\n\r\nIf it\u2019s possible, include citations for all
    of the examples you give that are from already published or archived sources.
    This makes it much easier for other linguists who need to study the context in
    which things are uttered, or who want additional information.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve
    already got a grammar published, include references to it for all the function
    words and morphemes in your dictionary. <em>Do not omit function words in the
    dictionary</em> \u2013 a dictionary is the first place people look for answers,
    and being alphabetically organized it also serves as an index for grammar forms.\r\n\r\nAnd
    an absolute must is ensuring that you have good fonts with consistent representation
    of the diacritics you need. Make sure that uppercase diacritics are handled well
    too, this is often overlooked by English speaking linguists who are diacritic-illiterate.
    Avoid a profusion of different fonts, instead stick to one serif face with relatively
    short ascenders and descenders and with a good companion italic, and then a fairly
    strong sans serif for the headwords. Avoid lots of fancy symbols like arrows,
    daggers, and the like; instead use \u201Cstandard\u201D dictionary abbreviations
    like \u201Cq.v.\u201D, \u201Ccf.\u201D, \u201Carch.\u201D, etc. Include a list
    of all the abbreviations you use at the beginning of the dictionary. When you\u2019re
    giving a form of a headword that has an extended context, don\u2019t repeat the
    headword but instead use a long swung dash (like a stretched out and centered
    tilde). You may need to add this glyph to your font, but it should be easy to
    create.\r\n\r\nI haven\u2019t had much chance to look at the new Haida dictionary,
    published by your own ANLC, but from what I saw of it I was fairly impressed.
    That would probably be a good example to ponder.\r\n\r\nIf you can, you should
    consider using XeTeX and XeLaTeX for compiling the dictionary since it seems like
    you already have an electronic database which will be used for it. If you can
    handle learning TeX & LaTeX you\u2019ll find it much easier to deal programmatically
    with your large collection of data. The XeTeX and XeLaTeX system handles Unicode
    natively as well as playing nice with fonts installed normally on your computer.\r\n\r\nFor
    the sake of everyone who uses your dictionary, please make sure to include lots
    of example sentences. An excellent show of example sentences in a dictionary is
    the Tlingit Verb Dictionary by Naish and Story. You needn\u2019t provide finely
    detailed morpheme glosses, just as long as the translations are solid.\r\n\r\nOne
    issue you will need to seriously consider is hyphenation. There are no strict
    rules for hyphenation in Aleut, I suspect. You\u2019ll need to develop some. Is
    the orthography one-to-one with the phonemes, or are there things like digraphs?
    Should you hyphenate only at syllable boundaries, or are there morphemes which
    cross syllable boundaries that are better candidates for hyphenation? These are
    some of the questions you\u2019ll need to resolve as early as possible.\r\n\r\nThere
    are lots of other thoughts I have but my wrists are sore from working on my Tlingit
    grammar... ;-)"

  body: "James, Gerald, and James,\r\n\r\nThanks all three of you for your suggestions
    and for taking the time to post.\r\n\r\nJames P., I stumbled upon the name Paul
    Luna as a result of your suggestion.  I haven't had much time to find any of his
    publications, but after the holidays his work will be high on my to-look-at list.
    \ Thanks!\r\n\r\nGerald, I appreciate the guidelines.\r\n\r\nJames C., it's nice
    to hear from someone else with an interest in indigenous language revitalization.
    \ I agree with your recommendation of <em>Making dictionaries</em>.  It's been
    invaluable to me.\r\n\r\nI should have been more clear about the nature of my
    project.  I'm not actually compiling a dictionary; instead, I'm creating a digital
    version (XML database + GUI) of Knut Bergsland's <em>Aleut Dictionary</em>.  There's
    definitely room for improvement in his dictionary, especially as far as pedagogical
    lexicography goes.  But my biggest complaints about the dictionary are the bare-bones
    English-to-Aleut index, and the complex organizational scheme used to order the
    Aleut words.  These two things create a lot of difficulty for language learners,
    and my primary goal is to create a digital version of the dictionary with an interface
    that mitigates these issues.  Along the way, I hope to address some less critical
    shortcomings of the paper dictionary, including the dense typesetting, which makes
    it hard for the user to extract the information they seek.\r\n\r\nI will look
    for the Elbert and Pukui dictionary.  I've looked at the Young and Morgan dictionary
    of Navajo; is that the one you recommend, or did Young write another dictionary
    on his own?  As far as ANLC dictionaries go, I find the Koyukon dictionary quite
    attractive; the Haida dictionary is not bad either, although the system of using
    lozenges to represent levels of subentries doesn't work for me.\r\n\r\nI see from
    your homepage that you have a background in computer science.  If you have any
    thoughts on the place of technology in language revitalization, I'd be interested
    to hear them.  Since that subject is quite off-topic for this forum, feel free
    to send me an e-mail: the domain is uaf dot edu and the address is ftarb2."
