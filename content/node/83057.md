  body: "I tried looking for this when you first posted it, and I couldn't find this
    Celtic font anywhere, so I gave up. The G was especially hard to match and the
    combination of letters was impossible. Maybe it's a customized font, is the best
    answer I can suggest.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
