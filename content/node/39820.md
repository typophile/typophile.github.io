  I am not gonna pay all that for the few letters i need.\r\nI found a lot, such as
  Sackers Gothic, but most don't have that 3 with that flat head, so to speak.\r\nColin
  Samuels has though: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/samuelstype/colin-samuels/|as
  you can see here]].\r\n\r\nAnd free alternatives are even better! It's just a small
  gig, but i need the Gotham look, not for the trend sake of it, but because it fits\r\nthe
  image of the company (traditional painter's company) so well in this case.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for all your help."
