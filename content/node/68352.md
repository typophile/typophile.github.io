  body: <a href="http://www.re-type.com/fonts/fonts-barbieri.html">Barbieri</a> has
    a similar overall feel, although the individual letterforms are not very close.

  body: Much of the stuff in those days was hand-drawn, though based on the existing
    (Letraset) forms/typefaces. If you want to get the same result, well, follow the
    same rule.

  body: "The late Bob Alonso's [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bagraphics/animated-gothic/|Animated
    Gothic]] is pretty similar, although maybe the baseline bounce is too much. I
    looked at his stuff right away, because he did a lot of commercial lettering work.\r\n\r\n-
