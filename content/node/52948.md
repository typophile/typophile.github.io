body: "I may be a bit misleading in the subject but Robert Bringhurst and David Blatner
  have mentioned it their books about setting H1, H2, Body etc so they share the same
  baseline without having to set to baselne, okay not so well explained but will try
  again\r\n\r\nIf I set the H1 to be 18/10  H2 12/16 and Body as 10/18 that is should
  share the same baseline or be lining up when I have columns  of text, its just that
  I dont have my books with me to check this out and know that both those books explain
  how to do it so they line up with having to set in indesign align to basegrid etc.
  \ \r\n\r\nDid I kinda make sense or you know what Im trying to say?"

  body: "On the matter, but not entirely a good answer:\r\nGraphic design relates
    to rythm in the same way as music does. In the middle of a 4/4 beat there might
    be a break defying all rules, but it always returns to the rythm again.\r\nIn
    the type world, you might set the text 11/15 and the headlines in a completely
    different size/leading, but you make sure space above and below gets you back
    into rythm again.\r\n\r\nI, myself, practically solves this by aligning text to
    the baseline, and placing headlines manually. Sometimes the leading is a double
    baseline step, sometimes I use three baselines to cover two lines of display."

  body: "There really is no 'baseline' concept in CSS.\r\n\r\nHowever, if these headlines
    will always be at the top of the columns, you could get away with some absolute
    positioning of the H* tags to be on the same baseline.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Cheers Frode, I thought there was a way of setting the type so that it would
    mimic as if setting it to the baseline, hmm need to get home and read the books
    again

    it out.

  body: "Use multiples of your body text line height to achieve this. \r\nE.g. if
    you have p set to 12/18pt you could use two imaginary 18pt baselines (36pt total)
    for h1 with 14/18pt with 36-14=22pt margin (distribute those 22pt to your liking
    between margin-top and margin-bottom). For a complete example see [[http://www.alistapart.com/articles/settingtypeontheweb|this
    article]] (via [[http://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/04/10/baseline-grid|daringfireball.net]]). "

  body: You can create a repeating background image with a line of color at the bottom,
    you'll have to figure out your spacing to the grid you want to use, and then adjust
    your em based padding/margins/line-height to achieve the correct spacing between
    elements. With the background used as your visual baseline of course. Just remember
    to remove the styled background when you're done, unless you like it...
