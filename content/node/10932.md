body: This not very pleasant typeface is used in an altar missal published by Benziger
  Brothers Inc. around 1956 &#40;the book has no publication date, but Cardinal Spellman&#39;s
  introduction is dated the feast of St Basil the Great, 1956&#41;. The type is used
  in two sizes 14pt &#40;shown here&#41; and 12pt. A different typeface is used for
  italics, suggesting that this face might not have an italic. Anyone recognise it?

  body: John <BR> <BR>This is a near De Vinne. There were a lot of variants of this
    and become known as the De Vinne family in the US. These were known as romanisch,
    romisch, romaans in European enboldened renditions. Very late nineteenth century.
    <BR> <BR>De Vinne No. 11 is very similar except the lowercase c shown here is
    wrong and, interestingly, wrong for the face. <BR> <BR>Is this a pop quiz? or?

  body: Yeah, it did. But probably the printer didn&#39;t. Metal type bud.

  body: Possibly. Mean fellow. Don&#39;t you think that the sample looks narrower
    than no. 11? But that&#39;s indeed the closest match I can think of. The c is
    wrong, as you said, and the i seems to come from some bolder variant. The foot
    of the d is different too.

  body: Theo <BR> <BR>De Vinne was very influential in his time, and for good reason.
    His faces weren&#39;t the best, in retrospect they were awful, but his instincts
    were right on the mark. There were a lot of variants to his &#34;family.&#34;
    This is not De Vinne No. 11. Thought I said that. We don&#39;t have really good
    records of specimens and their positioning during this very exciting period of
    printing history. <BR> <BR>De Vinne is important because he was a printer with
    scholarly interests. He is the first to point out that Gutenberg may indeed have
    invented the type mould. Something the scholars of the period were unable to fathom.
    His writings were important and influential. Updike followed in his footsteps.
    He was a revivalist &#42;before&#34; Morris. We probably wouldn&#39;t be discussing
    anything type related here and now had this dude not lived. <BR> <BR>This is De
    Vinne inspired face. I don&#39;t know the exact name of this particular typeface
    or the rip off foundry that produced it. And I don&#39;t care.

  body: Many thanks, Gerald. The use of this typeface in the Missal really has to
    be seen to be believed. Considering this is a book that is meant to be read aloud
    at the altar, the type is incredibly difficult to read.

  body: John <BR> <BR>Thought you might find this interesting.  <BR> <BR>DeVinne is
    derived from Elzevir or French Oldstyle faces. But most importantly, the display
    DeVinne &#34;is credited with bringing an end to the period of overly ornate and
    fanciful display faces of the nineteenth century, and with restoring the dignity
    of plain roman types.&#34; !!! <BR> <BR>This from McGrew&#39;s American Metal
    Typefaces of the Twentieth Century.
