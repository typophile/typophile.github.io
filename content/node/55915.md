  I made while thinking about the recent Legato thread. I don\u2019t know if I will
  be able to transform these in a complete set of characters, so I decided to start
  the thread.\r\n\r\nThe idea is behind my initial sketch was the contrast between
  an upright counter and a stretched contour (the dashed lines, more or less).\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s
  all, I must say that I quite hate the 'a'.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typo_4453.jpg]"

    is looking quite interesting. It reminds me a bit of Avance for some reason (especially
    the \"i\").\r\n\r\nI agree the \"a\" doesn't quite click with the others yet.
    It looks kind of\u2026 bored. I think maybe the bowl might reach too far over
    to the left? Also not sure about the terminal.\r\nI like the \"o\" a lot. I have
    a somewhat similar sketch of an \"o\" sitting on my hard drive ;-)\r\n\r\nI wonder
    how the funny shape of the serifs will work in text. \r\nSo yeah, I'd like to

  body: I think it needs to be somewhere more slanted. See how the left contour of
    the left and right legs are curved, try repeating that so the middle leg fits
    between the shapes either side. But actually it's handsome in its non-confirmity
    anyway, so maybe not... sorry that's not much help! :)

  body: "This looks pretty charming, although frankly I'm not seeing the essence of
    Legato click yet (assuming that's something desirable for you). And Avance is
    certainly echoing in your design. Enough so that I might make this practical suggestion:
    make this into a direct companion for Avance - maybe even a font somebody might
    use for special emphasis in place of Avance's own italic. To do this you would
    have to match the apparent size and color of Avance (or possibly its Italic).\r\n\r\nAs
    for your slant, I think it's a good deal outside the barfogenic zone* (although
    it does depend on point size, and you seem to be aiming small, which makes the
    zone larger). You might still want to increase it though (especially if you go
    with the idea above).\r\n\r\n* For the record, I got that term from a book about
    multimedia, in reference to animations with frame rates of between 8 fps and 15
    fps, which can actually induce physical nausea (because the human \"firmware\"
    can't decide if its moving or not).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    I added letters, even if they are only sketches, to start seeing how it works
    in a small text, so I really appreciate comments and critiques.\r\n\r\nThe design
    is so curvaceous (is it a word?) that achieving a certain uniformity in stems
    weights is a big problem. Also, I added to much weight at the connection between

    bulges are freely drawn--which makes it nice--getting the weights right is tough,
    as you say. That why they will pay you the big money :) \r\n\r\nTry making the
    l more straight rather than more slanted than the mn and see how you like it.

    before that the arm (top diagonal stroke) looked a touch weak, and I think it
    still might.\r\n\r\nYou could consider lengthening the right side of the bottom
    serif of 'f' to balance it out (although a little forward lean seems to be part
    of the character of this font).\r\n\r\nThe way the bottom terminal of 'c' stretches
    right seems to pull that letter \"upright\" instead of leaving the forward lean
    I just mentioned. I'd need a text setting to judge whether that would stick out
    or not. I think a text setting could also help tell if the 's''s balance works.
    (I hope it does.)\r\n\r\nDoes the crossbar of 't' get too pinched as it intersects
