  body: Is this an x-direction distance or a y-direction distance? Are you anchoring
    to the grid? Screenshots would help.

    even more dramatic. Here the \"round right\" stem is defined as 4 px, but the
    output is only 2."

  body: "That's sort of a weird way of hinting that situation (although I realise
    this doesn't answer your question of why the distance is not 4 pixels). A more
    typical strategy would hint from the outside of the bowl to the sidebearing.\r\n\r\nAre
    you aligning the destination to the grid? How?"

    build upon each other, so their starting and ending points are all aligned to
    the grid."

    I know this is not a typical hinting method, but that\u2019s not the point here
    (as you already said). I\u2019d like to know why they don\u2019t behave as instructed."

    Of course.\r\n\r\nI'm really not sure why it is behaving this way. My guess would
    be some kind of tolerance relative to the natural outline that prevents hints
    from radical distortion, but I don't know if this is something peculiar to FontLab
    or to the kinds of hints that it writes."

    know how to fix that in FontLab. In VTT it's just a setting you need to increase
    in the CVT.\r\n\r\nJason"

  body: "Fontlab has internal tolerances set to prevent large* jumps in either CVTs
    or deltas. So for this instance, your jumps are still limited to 8/8s for deltas
    (ie. you can only delta move a point 1 pixel or 1/8 fractions thereof), but you
    can increase the tolerance for CVTs by opening TT Hinting Options > General >
    (increase) Stem snap precision to 32/16 of the pixel. This will allow doubling
    of the stem value. Note you're asking to get both 3 and 4 pixels above. The above
    solution could get you up to 4 pixels, but I think as long as your stem has a
    reasonably accurate value entered you should still be able to get 3 pixels @ 20ppm
    without fudging the Snap Stem much**, ie. check your measurement from the inside
    of the stem to the sidebearing point and make sure the 'round right' CVT entry
    corresponds closely to that value.\r\n\r\n*or small, for that matter, as you can
    make much smaller adjustments the 1/8 pixel in TrueType, if you were so inclined,
    just not in Fontlab.\r\n\r\n**otherwise, keeping the Snap Stem at 17/16 may be
    the best bet, but you may still find yourself fiddling with the value occasionally
    to achieve certain results"

  body: He was trying to increase the sidebearing distance, not the weight of the
    outline. Admittedly, doing this from the inside is somewhat odd, but the stem
    of the 'o' here is unrounded (again a bit odd, but not without precedence).

    for an explanation for what this does. From what I (think I) understand, the numbers

    any ppm, the integer values in the hdmx table and the unrounded widths of the
    outlines. \r\n\r\nTogether with the subpixel positioning, you get a lot of different
    results. \r\n"
