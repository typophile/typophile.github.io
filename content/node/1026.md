body: Hi there,  <BR>Can someone help me with this one?  <BR>Trying to nail down the
  &#34;exact&#34; typeface to use for a project... My guesses for the serif face is
  Caslon or ITC Baskerville?? The Sans serif...Univers 55????? <BR>The source is taken
  from the new STEP inside design <BR>magazine, if that helps to know also. <BR> <BR>Thanks
  in advance for the help! <BR>Love this site! It&#39;s a must-read on weekly basis
  for me! <BR>You guys are really great! <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/14681.jpg"

  body: Well, that solves the mystery regarding the serif.  <BR>Good one Kent, I didn&#39;t
    know that about Hoefler Text  <BR>&#40;actually, I don&#39;t even know STEP Inside...

    seems to have worked lovely-jovely  <BR>this time.

    the <BR>same. Do you think Hoefler Text Titling is the match, <BR>like Kent mentioned??

    But I did double-check... <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/wink.gif"

  body: Yeah, DC, I know this for a fact. STEP did a spread on it when they unveiled
    the redesign. I don&#39;t remember which issue -- I didn&#39;t keep any. I didn&#39;t
    like the redesign, either visually or editorially, and let my subscription lapse.
    &#40;I like the types, though, just not the layout. And if you do manage to read
    through it all, the content isn&#39;t worth it, imho.&#41; <BR> <BR>DC, my links
    above are updated to go directly to the Hoefler pages. And yes, the headline is
    Hoefler Titling. &#40;I mistakenly wrote &#34;Text Titling&#34; before.&#41; <BR>
    <BR>Yves, if I recall correctly, Jonathan said he was more influenced by Granjon
    and the generation just after Garamond. <BR> <BR>-- K.

  body: Kent, <BR> <BR>Just looked at your Whitman typeface. It&#39;s a very nice
    one. I&#39;d say it&#39;s quite up there with Hoefler Titling!! ehehe! I have
    to consider that for my upcoming project!  <BR> <BR>
