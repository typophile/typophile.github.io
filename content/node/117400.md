  body: "The site is well known and reliable (no viruses and such things).\r\nMost
    of the fonts are uploaded by their corresponding designers, but be careful to
    check and respect the licenses. For example \"Jersey M54\" is \"Free for personal
    use\" only.\r\nIf you need it for a commercial project you should acquire a commercial
    license from the font designer/publisher.\r\n\r\nNote also that a small percent
    of supposed \"free\" fonts on this site are actually illegal/renamed copies of
    other commercial fonts."
