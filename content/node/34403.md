  body: "Christine, you might get a direct email for Licko, but not in public like
    this, and not just because of spambots: besides being a violation of privacy protocol,
    Licko is sort of the private type. One thing you might do to increase your chances
    (at least for your email to be passed along to her, if not the other way around)
    is enable the receiving of messages via Typophile, since right now:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/user/19078/contact\r\n\r\nOn
    the other hand Rainer's suggestion is solid: being an admirer of Licko's work
    (as per your other post) you're very likely to eventually get a reply by sending
    a nice message to the main mailbox. On the other other hand :-) Licko is the type
    of designer who: might not take kindly to <cite>too much</cite> inspiration, certainly
    not if it involves the copy-pasting of outlines (concerning which she has a \"history\"
    - see the Makela case for one); but you're making an Arabic type (which I actually
    guessed after reading your other post!) so it's not as problematic. One encouraging
    thing is that Emigre has sanctioned Greek and Cyrillic derivations of their fonts.
    Another encouraging thing is that you're a woman.\r\n\r\nTwo more things that
    might or might not provide food for thought:\r\n\r\n1) Everybody makes mistakes,
    and mistakes teach us more than correct things! In the case of Matrix many people
    have a problem with the \"g\"*. In fact previously on Typophile people have tried
    -and I think some have succeeded- in improving it: http://typophile.com/node/14378
    _\r\nMy point here isn't to bash Licko, but to alert you to the level of lucid
    thinking that you will need when working from Matrix (or really when making any
    font).\r\n\r\n2) When I hear somebody making a non-Latin font based on a Latin
    original, my alarm bells go off! Because almost all the time the non-Latin script
    suffers a large drop in cultural authenticity, hence functionality. The reason
    this happens is generally a certain ignorance of what a scipt <cite>needs</cite>
    to be, as opposed to what it can easily be distorted into by copy-pasting formal
    features from Latin. I've talked about this a lot (including at conferences) and
    have written an article as well. A high-profile Arabic example of this problem
    can be seen in Abbar's \"Arabic Univers\" work, featured in Eye magazine, and
    also discussed here previously:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/3306\r\n\r\nThe fact
    that you say you're making a display type attenuates both of the points above:
    the \"g\" isn't so bad for display, but to me it does prevent Matrix from being
    a full-fledged text font, which I personally value more; and Latinization is not
    nearly as damaging when it's done in a \"fun\" display font (even though these
    things do migrate to text sometimes).\r\n\r\nOh, and say hi to Lebanon for me.
