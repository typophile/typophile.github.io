body: I know this is going to sound absurd, but I am in desperate need of a serif
  typeface that has a very modern feel to it. I'm looking for sharp serifs like in
  Cochin. However, Cochin has too many curves. Bodoni and Fenice get too thick. Filosofia
  is too curvy. I need it to be very tight, sleek and sharp with serifs. I think I
  may have to just create it myself.
