  Cambodia etc, for a book I'm producing and I'm wondering how designers normally
  go about it in the right way. Is there a good online resource with simple map outlines?
  can I use a few different sources and come up with a composite that doesn't rely
  too heavily on any of the originals? does NASA have such a thing?\r\nthanks guys,
  I'm a bit stumped\r\n\r\n--N"

    vector maps are of very good quality. More recently, you can check out the maps
    at [[ http://www.istockphoto.com/ | iStockphoto]].

    does anyone know if this is what designers normally do, (use stock maps) or do

    What are other people's experience? If I can figure out an option that won't cost
    $100 a map that would be ideal,\r\ncheers\r\n\r\n"

    kind of political map forms -- I found a vector map from <a href = \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:BlankMap-World.png\">
    \ wikipedia </a> that seems to be OK to use, maybe I'll go with this. Do you think
    there are any issues with using this? I guess my concern is that the map itself
    is not copyrighted but it may be produced from something that is."

    itself which is obviously not protected but with the map's source. Vardion might
    have traced over an atlas to produce his vector work -- it's just hard to know.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    I think the CIA has solved my problem (I never thought I'd get to say something
    like that). It has something called a factbook with lots of detailed maps which
    are all, apparently, in the <a href = \"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/docs/contributor_copyright.html\">
    Public domain </a>\r\nthanks for all your help"

  body: Hi Nicholas, Just to echo previous responses, if you're ever in doubt of a
    copyright or license, the best thing is to contact the owner or provider directly.
    The legalese can be very complicated and it does vary from country to country.
    Those last maps are quite interesting but I don't know if you can modify them
    for your or your clients' needs. Best to check. :)

    particular theme or illustrative style. I'm not sure if that's \"standard\" I
    suppose ideally it's best to have a budget and commission an artist. Even with
    purchased stock maps, I often just use it as a template to draw my own version

    more unique look."
