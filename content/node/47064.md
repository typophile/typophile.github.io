    a hackneyed approach in a market sector where its competitors turn out bird cage

    from reading a real men's magazine like British <em>Car</em>.\r\n<strong>Rivals</strong>:

    be able to design a more beautiful magazine cover than a committee.\r\nNow, just
    suppose that the designer's preferred concept had less copy, which would no doubt
    qualify as more beautiful on the less-is-more principle. But then the editor or
    publisher got cold feet that such simplicity wasn't hard-hitting enough, or didn't
    communicate all the great content inside, or looked like it belonged on a different
    section of the magazine rack.\r\nSo rather than go back to square one, the understated,
    upscale design was added to, and, of course, looked flat, because that's what
    clutter does to understatement. So the type was jazzed: serif here, sans there;
    script here, block there; condensed here, extended there. And now, at the expense
    of mere beauty, there's some excitement to please the powers that be.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nAlex

    magazine, since I don't work in the publishing industry. Regardless, dozens of
    magazines exist with more tasteful covers than <em>GQ</em>. Go figure. There is
    such a thing as good taste, and more to the point, common sense. Common sense
    and taste (presumably, or perhaps it's talent) produce good cover designs at other
    magazines, yet GQ somehow manages to combine pretentious with eye strain.\r\n\r\nDoes
    my not being involved \"in the, most often, cooperative venture that is the designing
    of a major magazine cover\" disquailfy me from making rhetorical criticism of
    magazine cover designs? What absolute twaddle.\r\n\r\nHow *could* students fresh
    out of design school do better? By working for a magazine where the comittee avoids
    navel gazing in a cul de sac. If <em>Car</em> and others can do it, why can't
    </em>GQ</em>? Editorial policy, as Nick has explained. probably has a lot to do
    with it. I didn't call <em>GQ</em>'s editorial policy \"mutually incompatible
    with self-respect\" for nothing.\r\n\r\n@dux: <em>You\u2019re awfully quiet James?</em>\r\n\r\nYou're
    awfully keen to point that out, like it means I'm having trouble coming up with

    hotrodders and hotrod lovers know the difference and shun the car with the 90's

  body: "<em>He [Alex White] wrote that in 1992, does it no longer apply?</em>\r\n\r\nThe
    current a trend is for magazines to put a celebrity on the cover and fill up any
    remaining white space with headlines and more headlines... Of course there are
    different ways of doing this. To repeat an example I mentioned earlier in this
    thread, Fred Woodward's work for Texas Monthly, Rolling Stone, and the American
    GQ has always been outstanding.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gq_cover_5032.jpg]\r\n\r\nOther
    magazines, like Esquire, have also been doing this lately. Esquire has tweaked
    the idea and placed the type <em>behind</em> the cover subject.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/deltoro_4338.jpg]\r\n\r\nHere's
    a tongue-in-cheek thing they did recently:\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jessica-simpson-esquire-01_3575.jpg]\r\n\r\nNotice
    that the headline reads, \"We shot this image to catch your eye so you will pick
    up this issue..., etc.\" Good for a quick chuckle, perhaps, but other designers
    have found better ways to catch readers' attentions. Compare that with the 1960s
    Esquire cover that is being homaged, sort of:\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/esquire_woman_march_65_6485.jpg]"
