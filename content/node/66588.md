body: "This bug is well known. We need <code>BLOCKQUOTE</code>, actual heading elements
  (perhaps just <code>H2</code> through <code>H6</code>), possibly a few more.\r\n\r\nHowever,
  enabling the <code>IMG</code> element is dangerous, as MetaFilter has learned the
  hard way. One can encode JavaScript exploits in URLs or the <code>src</code> of
  an image. Limiting images to attachments (kind of odd for a Web site, less so for
  a discussion forum) is a reasonable compromise."

    cause problems</a>.
