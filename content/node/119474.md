body: "Good day!\r\n\r\nI am a designer/technical writer at a software company and
  am having a difficult time determining whether or not we can develop a documents
  package that includes Myriad Pro. The end user would receive this typeface a part
  of our software installation process; I just can't seem to figure out how to find
  accurate information on this subject. Someone at typophile should be able to tell
  me!:\r\n\r\n<strong>What do I need to do to determine--WITH ABSOLUTE CONFIDENCE--the
  legality of distributing this font?</strong>\r\n\r\nPut another way: we are considering
  incorporating Myriad Pro into an installation that would affect 40,000 (yes, 40k)
  computers.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your advice!"

  body: "Thanks to you both. I sent my inquiry to Adobe and received just the information
    I needed in a response from Typekit staff. This definitely put the kibosh on using
    Myriad Pro for our development effort, hehe (As it turns out, this would have
    probably gone on 50k+ systems). Here's the email, in the off chance that it may
    help someone else!\r\n\r\n<strong>\"At this time, we don't offer licenses for
    inclusion in apps. We hope to in the future, but don't have such a program at
    this time. In the meantime, I recommend that you use the App+ program from FontShop.
    www.fontshop.com They won't be able to offer you Myriad, but they have a nice
    selection of fonts at reasonable prices.\"</strong>\r\n\r\nCheers!"
