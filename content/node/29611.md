  to know how much fonts are worth paying for and which ones. Which are meant to be
  worth it for the amount charged? I could easily be paying more for something that
  isn'nt even worth paying that amount for. Please guide me thanks :D"

  body: "It's worth paying for if you're going to use it, just like clothing.\r\n\r\nAnd,
    like clothing, there are bargains and there are extravagances. We all have the
    $50 jeans we wear nearly every day and the fancy stuff we trot out for parties
    once or twice a year.\r\n\r\nGenerally you will get better value if you buy a
    large family (Adobe Garamond, for example) - various weights, itals, small caps,
    alternate figures, etc. Those families tend to be versatile and useful especially
    if you are just starting to build your font library and the \"per style\" (not
    sure that's the right term) price tends to be lower. However it can be well worth
    your while to buy a fancy one-off if you love it."

    set a book, produce a logo etc., the cost of the type is related to their return
    on investment. \r\n\r\nWhat job are you asking the type to do? On what is the
    return on investment based? "
