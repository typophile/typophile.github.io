  of the 20st century Detroit was the boom town of North America and the car manufacturers
  equipped their cars with shiny chrome parts \u2013 and a new kind of type design:
  Chrome Script. Based on this style, we developed two contemporary retro font family,
  called Hooptie Script. The fonts make full use of modern OpenType technology. Just
  turn on contextual alternates and ligatures and watch how each letter pair always
  connects perfectly. The full package includes seven bonus vector images of vectorized
  hooptie cars.\r\n<!--break-->\r\n<img src=\"http://www.opentype.info/static/typophile1.jpg\">\r\n<img

  the design can be found here: \r\nhttp://j.mp/qSwUpN\r\n\r\nThe fonts are available

  body: "Nice!\r\n\r\nHowever, this style of go-faster \"Streamline\" type wasn't
    just for cars, it was also used on other slick products, eg refrigerators:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/frigidaire_logo_xhkx_5218.jpg]\r\n\r\nDoes
    anyone know who originated it?"

  body: "Nick,\r\nI don't know who invented it but my guess would be that it came
    out of a need due to the cutting and casting of metal and the ease of mounting
    it on products.  If you think about trying to speed up production of products
    such as the icebox and wringer-washer as well as bicycle and later automobile,
    it makes sense for this to come about.  If I want to mount product lettering,
    I need someone with spacing skills if I use individual letters.  If the entire
    brand name is one piece, the skill and time needed is much less. These things
    were then cast in pot metal and mounted as a unit. The casting and removal from
    moulds requires some adjustment to the design so that metal flows into all the
    areas and can also be removed from the mould without damage. This brings about
    the tapered edge and rounded corners we see in these brand markings.  Also, stroke
    contrast was limited by limitations in casting.  The typical script written hand
    joins and tighter spacing were ignored in favor of a strong, flatter baseline
    join and wider spacing required to make a workable mould. ( With todays materials
    and injection moulding techniques, we no-longer need to be so limited by early
    20th Century casting issues.)  The straight line baseline also made mounting easier
    since all mounting holes and guides could follow a straight line.  \r\nFor a timeline,
    I would guess this kind of lettering came about in response to factory production
    assembly-line techniques.  This is more in the 1920s and 30s than 50s although
    assembly line techniques really blossomed in the 1950s.\r\nTo me, that makes the
    designer of this style to be some cooperative work between the metal smiths and
    early \"efficiency experts\" who just did what they had to with the materials
    of the day."

  body: I like them, but find confusing that two styles so different are presented
    under a single typeface name.

  body: Advantages of streamlining vary with the speed desired. Unless the car is
    to operate at more than 45 to 50 miles per hour the advantage is slight. If the
    car is operated continuously at high speeds the fuel saving is worth while and
    is all in favor of the streamlined car. <a title="automotive diagnostic tools"
