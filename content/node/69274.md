  a list of schools where type design is taught.\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Jandorp/Type_design_education\r\n\r\nPlease
  contribute. This is a beta page that will be made live as soon as it starts to make
  some sense. Type design only please (no typesetting, book typography, logo design
  or pure calligraphy courses).\r\n\r\nIf you don't want to register at Wikipedia
  please leave info here.\r\n\r\nBTW -- with such a vibrant and active community of
  typophiles, how come the Type Design article on Wikipedia is still so poor?"

  body: I've added info about Brian Lucid's class at MassArt and Jesse Ragan's class
    at Pratt, though I probably didn't follow the correct format. I know James Montalbano
    has done classes at SVA as well, but I couldn't find any relevant links.

    about type design takes a lot of time and so does designing type. It\u2019s certainly
    not something I would do for free."

  body: "It's a good start, but the article has in-body links, which is not appreciated
    on wikipedia. It's basically a linklist now, and it will most likely be deleted
    if it stays that way. It would be better if you remove the links from the article
    itself, and place them at the bottom under a 'external links' bit instead. See
    [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:External_links|WP:External links]] for
    more info. Another option would be to make footnotes next to the school names
    that contain the links to their websites (which would place the links at the bottom
    automatically).\r\n\r\nOr you could make it a 'list of...' article - which basically
    it is - instead of a regular article, since other rules apply to those. If you
    want it to be a regular article, it needs more encyclopedic information on type
    design education in general."

    it will have to be somebody else. We don't pay Wikipedia, and it doesn't pay us.
    \r\n\r\n@Quincunx:\r\n\r\nThanks for your advice. A list article would make more
    sense if that does indeed allow for in-body links; otherwise the article would
    be a hassle to use and I'd better put it somewhere else. I want to avoid getting
    into details about type design education because it's endless and can lead to
    a lot of ideological discussion."

  body: Nice to have an easy overview for type design education, next to the one on
    the Typophile wiki. I think in-line links in a list page is allowed, so it shouldn't
    be a problem. If not, some purist wikipedian will probably let you know. ;)
