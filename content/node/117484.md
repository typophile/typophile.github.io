  and it did find some close match but nothing dead on. Also I know that before using
  this font, McDo old lookalike font was: \"Berthold Akzidenz Grotesk\"\r\n\r\nThis
  one is much more modern.. the capital R, is straight.. looks great. Thx for the
  help!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/whatsthisfont_4988.jpg]"

  body: "@Siffloteux\r\n\r\nThanks for your answer. The link you sent is not using
    Marianina. Only your first image posted is using it. I even think that your first
    image was done by someone else than Mc Donalds Company. And they just looked for
    a font similar to it, so they took Marianina. But in no other Mc Donalds use I
    can found it. \r\nIf you want to compare, I'll post a screenshot from the coupon
    and Marianina. \r\nBest from France! \r\n\r\n"
