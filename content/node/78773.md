body: "I have a mystery that I need help solving.\r\n\r\nI collect old trademarks
  and labels that were used as adverts on cloth by fabric merchants. I recently acquired
  an old label which is of a 1700's design style but it contains some sand serif lettering,
  which according to the history books was not used until the 1800's.\r\nThe thing
  is, a lot of the typefaces used by the merchants were unique to that trade (I was
  a speaker at last year's Typecon on the subject) and so it is not unfeasible they
  they used a sans serif font before they became popular. These merchants were also
  dealing with far off lands in Asia etc where sans serif may have been used before
  the West.\r\n\r\nThe story of the label, a picture of it and when it might date
  from is here www.textiletrademarks.com\r\nbut I have attached the name part which
  is in that sans serif font. Obviously it looks hand drawn to me but maybe someone
  out there in typeland might help with this mystery of why a sans serif type would
  appear on what looks like a typical 1700's style label. \r\nI don't mind what the
  date of the label is because it is interesting anyway but if it does date from pre
  1686 then I suppose it is an example of very early sans serif type and should be
  added to the history of type.\r\nOf course, it could be a 19th century label trying
  to look old for some reason, although all the merchants wanted their labels to be
  modern, not old fashioned in style.\r\n\r\nThanks for your input.\r\n\r\nAdrian
  Wilson"

  body: "Hi,\r\nare you asking for the oldest sans-serif in absolute?\r\nIf I\u2019m
    not wrong you can find first latin sans serifs by the ancient Romans :)\r\nAfter
    that you can find \"real\" first sans serifs in 15th century in Florence (Italy).
    Optima is taken from these models.\r\nYou can look at some artworks here [[http://www.wikideep.it/cat/medaglie-di-pisanello/sesta-medaglia-di-lionello-d%27este/]]
    \ the images size is forced down, but if you look at them out of the html page,
    you'll appreciate the design. "

    and Greeks had sans before the Romans and there were perhaps others even older.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    Mosley, on his page 48, shows a reproduction dated 1688 and numerous other early
    19th century examples."
