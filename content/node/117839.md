  designing the Esperanto letter h circumflex (\u0125)\r\nPersonally, I don't really
  like any of the usual ways because it's either too high or too offset in my opinion\r\nDesigning
  my new font, Stenfree, i tried different options.\r\nThe first one looks kinda pretty
  but I'm not sure about legibility, though. Number two to four are the typical approaches.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance\r\nrolifri\r\n\r\nPS: I didn't do kerning & hinting yet. That's why the
  text-preview is so pixelated/low quality :)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/h

    and gold unambiguous. Olive suggested by Michael looks good. Just an opinion.\r\nDon"

  body: Good points in thread 68302. I like Michel Boyer's suggestion above. Probably
    you'd want to design a slightly smaller circumflex instead of merely cropping
    the normal one, of course.

    width of circumflex for lower height version rather than reducing size to avoid
    horizontal offset. \r\nDon"
