  a publication (deadline: today!), and as I'm not sure about a detail, I need some
  advices from experimented type designers. Here's my text:\r\n\r\nChiavari is an
  elegant stencil which makes it a fashionable typeface for display uses, headlines
  and signage. Chiavari explores some particularities of both modern and renaissance
  typefaces, oscillating between a vertical and an oblique axis. It plays on the disappearance
  of the hairlines while geometric serifs and rectangular thin strokes give it a radical
  and modern twist. \r\n\r\nI have a doubt about the axis theory, witch in my case
  is mostly vertical, but on all curves, I made a pen rotation, as you do when you
  wanna draw a oblique axis based typeface.\r\n\r\nIt would be awesome if you could
  sen me your thoughts.\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/chiavari1_5513.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/chiavari2_4515.png]"

  body: "I don\u2019t consider it elegant, as the proportions are normal and the weight
    bold.\r\nRather, I would say it is finely detailed (which positions it as a display
    face and also suggests upscale quality).\r\n\u201CContemporary\u201D is classier-sounding
    and offers broader scope than \u201Cfashionable\u201D, which connotates mere trendiness."
