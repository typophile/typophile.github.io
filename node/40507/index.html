<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi -
I'm designing a web site that will serve educators and students. I'm trying to decide on a display face and I thought you nice folks might offer your suggestions. Here's what I'm trying to accomplish:
- The site is going to serve a wide age group, so it has to be regal enough for crusty old professors w/o being too dull or pretentious for students. I'd like to try to capture some of the romance of higher education while keeping a sense of humor about it (closer to "Animal House" than the New England Journal of Medicine).
- The site itself is going to have a dynamic identity that will accommodate the name and colors of a particular institution. Therefore, the typography will need to be unique enough to create a cohesive identity, w/o completely swallowing up the institution's psuedo-identity.
- It's going to be web-based, so most of a page's text is going to be in some system font. I haven't decided on serifs or not, but most likely either Georgia or Arial/Helvetica.
I've just started looking around, so maybe you all can help me get started. I like what they're doing over at the new <a href=http://spacecollective.org>Space Collective</a>, but I think that display face might be too playful. Any suggestions??
Thanks in advance!

<div class=commentbody>> I haven’t decided on serifs or not
Decide on sans. Serifs are harder to read online for most people. The only thing to deal with is that sans generally have larger x-heights, and therefore should be presented at 80% the default size. (Do not specify points in your CSS, and then people using all browsers will be able to change to a larger size if their eyes require it.)
You can use graphics or sIFR to make the headings and subhead distinctive with nice fonts.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks for the replies, but I think my original post may have been unclear. I'm not looking for a system font (I'll likely use sIFR on the site), I just wanted to make the point that the typeface I select will have to compliment either badly-rendered Georgia or badly-rendered Arial.
Thanks again.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Lessee, you want to appeal to stogy old professors & hip young students. Last time I looked, you couldn't get even modernists & postmodernists to agree on an aesthetic, and that's just one small part of academia. I'd say the font you want is named <cite>unobtainable</cite></div>

<div class=commentbody>I really like the feel of Underware's "Dolly," but there aren't many weights to work with. Can anyone recommend something in a similar style with more flexibility?
Thanks. </div>
