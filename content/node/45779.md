  body: The one at the top is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/dynamo/">Dynamo</a>.
    The other one seems to be <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/alternate-gothic/">Alternate
    Gothic</a> or <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/trade-gothic/">Trade
    Gothic Bold Condensed</a>. Also, it seems to be black type with a red shadow,
    but that may just be a video artifact.
