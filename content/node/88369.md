    oodles o' rules that brought some of the pages of Blueprint to mind.\r\n\r\nI'm
    sure Insouciant is up to your usual high standards, and I hope it finds an enthusiastic
    audience."

    you do.

    just interesting, but endearing.\r\nIt's normal - don't knock it.\r\n\r\n> But
    that will never happen.\r\n\r\nSure. For one thing you need a lot less help than\r\nmost
    people who use this forum to such great effect.\r\n\r\nBut would your early work
    (like Orbon) have benefited\r\nif something like Typophile were available? Definitely.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    with something better. Evidence? What did your\r\nfirst published font look like
    James?* And it's not difficult to\r\nargue that FF might not have taken on Ernestine
    without the\r\ngood direction it acquired thanks to that Typophile critique.\r\nThis
    is no slight against Nina, since I think even your own\r\ncurrent work could benefit.\r\n\r\n*

    anything anybody else points out?\r\nGo look at that thread. And while you're
    at it look at this\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/53395 and see how much\r\nTypophile
    helped. Just because you rarely help people\r\nhere doesn't mean they get no help
    here.\r\n\r\nYou might also ask Christian Robertson how this\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/betatype/pill-gothic/\r\ncame
    about.\r\n\r\nAnd what did your second font look like? Probably 50%\r\nof the
    same stuff. Well, Ernestine was a second font, and it\r\nlooks awesome in part
    because of Typophile. This place\r\nisn't just for asking technical questions,
    getting an answer\r\nand then pretending you didn't.\r\n\r\nBTW, I don't get the
    relevance of my not saying much to\r\nyou in person. If you'd said something interesting
    I would\r\nhave reacted I guess. If you look at this thread for example\r\nyou'll
    notice that I found what Michael said interesting.\r\nBTBTW Micheal, what does

    have been critiquing -out\r\nof goodwill- for three years.\r\n\r\nActually <em>thinking</em>
