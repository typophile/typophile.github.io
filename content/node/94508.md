  Any ideas would be helpful.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nGus"

  body: "I think \"beard\" is for the part that projects at the baseline (if it's
    there). Like I would say that the /G in Optima has no beard, while Cheltenham's
    is quite hirsute!\r\n\r\nI'm tempted to make up a new term (like \"jaw\") but
    otherwise I'd go with \"stem\".\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "In type, 'beard' traditionally refers to the piece of the metal face below
    the baseline, usually corresponding to the descender depth.\r\n\r\nI'd probably
    call this a vertical stub, or simply short vertical stem."
