  goes. <BR> <BR>It appears to be a version of Brush Script, the letter &#34;Q&#34;
  is more like this one &#40;shown in this message&#41; in the fact that, it is whole,
  with a tail. <BR> <BR>All of mine look more like the letter &#34;L&#34; <BR> <BR>More
  like the &#34;Q&#34; in Script MT, but without the curl on top.

  body: Dear Anytown, my best suggestion, if you can&#39;t show us a sample of what
    you are describing, is to suggest that you look in either Part 7 &#40;Informal
    connected scripts&#41; or Part 8 &#40;informal non-connected scripts&#41; of the
    <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/ScriptIDGuide.html" target="_blank">Script
    Font ID Guide</a>. That way you can see for yourself if there is a match.  <BR>
    <BR>There are too many possibilities to try to guess which one you have seen.
