  | MyFonts.com]], is a brand new face inspired by the art of the Edwardian poster,
  especially travel posters. It\u2019s good for clear ad legible headings which need
  a gentle and unobtrusive period touch, and is the latest is Greater Albion\u2019s
  line of faces to explore the \u2018small capitals\u2019 idea.\r\n\r\nIn its regular
  weight, Chipperly\u2019s glyphs are semi-shaded within an outer outline giving a
  distinctive look, while the Heavy weight maintains the separate outline but is completely
  filled. The Light form is an outline alone. All forms unite period elegance with
  the modern need for clear readability.\r\n\r\nLight:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Chipperly_l_5140.png]\r\n\r\nRegular:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Chipperl_R_4733.png]\r\n\r\nHeavy:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Chipperly_h_5778.png]\r\n\r\nSee
