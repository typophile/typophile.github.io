  [[handwriting]] scripts. I am especially interested in samples of Blaise Pascal's
  handwriting. Anyone of you ever 'searched' for / noticed / found such samples, sources
  and lettering excerpts? <em>(Please note, I am not \tnecessarily looking for actual
  typefaces, based on famous handwriting. But I am of course open and thankful for
  any suggestions and hints.)</em>\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nDav"
