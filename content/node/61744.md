  and I am keen to get your c&c again.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what you think about
  this.\r\n\r\nI used Duepontezero for the FPA and Nioubes light which I have modified
  to get the desired look.\r\n\r\nlook forward to your c&c\r\n\r\nThanks \r\nJames[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BWLGO_4045.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/WLGO_4770.jpg]"

  body: "Duepontezero means 2.0 in Italian (as in \u201Cweb two-point-o\"). That\u2019s
    for saying that it don\u2019t seem really appropriate for an architecture firm.\r\nBut
    I like the \u201Cconstructivism\u201D of \u201Carchitects\u201D."

  body: "In general I like what you did to \"Nioubes\" since it would look horrible
    in <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/font.php?file=nioubes_font&page=1&nb_ppp_old=10&text=architects&nb_ppp=10&psize=l&classt=alpha\">it's
    original look</a>.\r\n:)\r\n\r\nBut I can see one problem coming from customizing
    the font (especially the \"s\") -> in \"Nioubes\" standard the \"s\" balances
    the \"h\" but in your version the \"h\" looks too wide ... or maybe the new \"s\"
    looks too slender. You could possibly try to make the \"s\" more like in it's
    original font. But anyway ... it looks good and it communicates \"architecture\"."

  body: The F is really distracting to me. Looks too wide, maybe or maybe the arm
    is too short or both?.

    dont mean this in an arsey way..) i would just like further input.\r\n\r\nAs the
    the S - yes I amended it - i thought the standard S was too wide - but you are
    100% correct and I am annoyed I didnt spot it - the S balances the h - \r\n\r\nI
    like the h and dont want to make it slender - maybe the S needs making wider but
    not as wide as the original.\r\n\r\nI think the comment re: the F and the arm
    lenght is spot on too.\r\n\r\nIm gonna come back with ammends - stay tuned.\r\n\r\nCheers
    for the encouraging comments."

  body: "<cite>care to elaborate</cite>\r\n\r\nIt doesn't seem to have much appeal
    to me past its trendiness. It doesn't seem to be built on a solid concept for
    the company, but rather a cool looking font. Don't get me wrong, it's not poorly
    done, I just think it won't have any staying power once this kind of typography
    goes out of style.\r\n\r\npenn"

  body: "Thanks Penn...\r\n\r\nI am struggling to do something that doesn't smack
    of Tweed and Leather elbow patches or something which is perceived as \"cool for
    the time being but...\"\r\n\r\nNot sure how to get inbetween -\r\n\r\nThe logo
    needs to say forward looking / but not pigeon holes the architects as contemporary
    only architects... same as I dont wanna do anything that looks traditional and
    pigeon holes the firm as Traditional only.\r\n\r\nI have taken the comments from
    before on board and I have spent some time addressing the issue of the F and its
    cross bar.\r\n\r\nThe following show a few options- Im favouring 001\r\n\r\n001
    has a dropped cross bar to align with that of the P & A\r\n\r\n002 has a cross
    bar which is unchanged in terms of its vertical position but I have extended the
    cross bar \r\n\r\n003 and 004 are variations on a theme where i have simlpy extended
    the cross bar into the P.\r\n\r\nYour comments are welcomed again.\r\n\r\nI am
    pretty happy with 001 and i have put the two best (i think) options together with
    the architects part.\r\n\r\nI am gonna play with the S in architects now and see
    if i can balance this h & s relationship.\r\n\r\nThanks guys - keep it coming.\r\n\r\nJames\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/EXP01_5788.jpg]"

  body: "I have made amends based on your collective crit \r\n\r\nSee what you think
    - I have made further amends to the architects font.\r\n\r\nI have thinned the
    h to make more sense of the S.\r\n\r\nI have made amends to the F of FPA as mentioned
    in previous post.\r\n\r\nSee what you think of the latest ver.\r\n\r\nWith the
    logos reduced from 300dpi to 72dpi its apparent here that size 20pt is as small
    as it would want to be repo'd maybe 16pt at a push.\r\n\r\nCheers JB[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typotest_4642.jpg]"

  body: "There is still a problem within your \"s\". All the other \"round\" letters
    have the shape of a perfect circle but the spine of your \"s\" is too short and
    so the letter feels out of place. Furthermore your \"s\" doesn't sit on the baseline.\r\n<em></em><em></em>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/s_problem_6277.jpg]\r\n<em></em><em></em>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/round_s_5843.jpg]\r\n<em></em><em></em>\r\nSince
    \"c\" is some kind of an exception -- regarding to where the strokes end (all
    of the others end at either 3, 6, 9 or 12 o'clock) -- it needs a little more space
    towards the \"h\" because otherwise it visually cuts into it like in the first
    picture.\r\n<em></em>\r\nI hope this helps you improving the wordmark."

    mistake when i was fiddling with the s.\r\n\r\nWith the S as a perfect circle
    it just doesn't sit right for me - its just too wide.\r\n\r\nAnd you are correct
    on the c - h interface - I can look at that now.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nJames"

  body: "Check out the font critique forums here - it's a great way to get a feel
    of how fonts are designed and created and I certainly learn a lot by following
    some of the ongoing critique processes. Then also check out the build forums to
    see some of the technical hurdles and challenges in creating fonts. And then,
    if you're still not turned off by the amount of work necessary to create a a \"good\"
    and usable font, start developing your own, either with pencil/pen and paper and
    then converting it in a font creation program or start by jumping right into a
    font-creating software like TypeCreator, Fontlab, DTL FontMaster or even FontForge
    and creating your font.\r\n\r\nIf you're more just interested in creating a one-off
    \"font\" you could just create your characters in your favorite vector artwork
    program and then manually set everything.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps answer your
    question. Good luck!"

  body: "Very much appreciated\r\n\r\nFor what I need you probably right on the money
    with doing it in illustrator or whatever ( i use illustrator) and then just setting
    the characters manually.\r\n\r\nI suppose I just wanted to modify the font we
    use for Architects so i can just type it rather than manually mashing it up when
    I create stuff.\r\n\r\nIt would also be a good learning opportunity - I love type
    and I would like to learn more - I think to truly understand the mechanics of
    a font or type face you have to deconstruct it.\r\n\r\nCheers for the tips - if
    you had to choose one of those font creation progs- what would you go for -  what
    do you use and why ?\r\n\r\nI know nothing - ENLIGHTEN ME :)"
