  to see, but here it is: <BR> <BR>&#60;img&#62; <BR> <BR>Couther Sans is a typeface
  I am designing for the DIA &#40;Design Institute of Australia&#41; Student Design
  Awards, I&#39;ve explained the brief and my rationale in the pdf further below.
  <BR> <BR>As this is for a competition, I chose only the weight I thought most elegant:
  light. I am trying to work off stereotypes of uncouth Aussies &#40;thus, Couther
  Sans&#41;, and wanted the most sleek and modern feel I could get. However, this
  would be used more for display sizes, thus the &#34;display&#34; tagged on the end,
  although the face is intended also for body copy. <BR> <BR>There are little ink
  traps in it &#40;very small&#41; because it is intended for display sizes. <BR>
  <BR>Please, I would love any and all feedback, even harsh critiques are welcome.
  I&#39;ve done a handful of other fonts before, a hand script, a type revival and
  a typeface that was half-done and then lost in a hard drive incident, but nothing
  designed for body text. <BR> <BR>This incarnation must be ready by the end of next
  week, however more detailed feedback for when I develop the complete family is also
  welcome. The alphabet and numerals are done and ready for tweaking, the analphabetic
  glyphs including punctuation are yet to be done, or we just thrown together for
  this sample sheet. <BR> <BR>Sorry if I&#39;ve rambled. <BR> <BR><!--attachment:

  body: 'First of all, il really like this kind of post-modern sans serif typeface.
    However, I&#39;d suggest somethings. <BR> <BR>Why did you choose to have two kind
    of end letter: round on both side, like &#40;K P R, U, 3, d&#41; and round/square
    &#40;C, X, Y&#41;. To me it seems unstable. <BR> <BR>Also, the top bowl of the
    UC and lc s is to much to the left side.  <BR> <BR>Good work'

  body: Thanks Ricardo, will have a look at the Cs again. I wanted something not quite
    vertically symmetrical, if you know what i mean, kind of like a vertically flipped
    version of Rotis&#39; Cs, but i might need to re-think this. Never been the biggest
    fan of Rotis myself. <BR> <BR>Anyone know of a good face with a balanced, vertically
    asymmetrical C? <BR> <BR>And I do need to exaggerate the triangular cust in the
    counters of P &amp; R. Even though they&#39;re not truly closed counters already,
    it is such a small gap and small angle, that when printining it out, it fills
    in on a laser printer. <BR> <BR>Thanks for all your feedback so far guys, it&#39;s
    very much appreciated. And I will let you know how the competition goes.

    have a look at <a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?M0" target="_blank">Max

    some other letter that is a bit asymmetrical, vertically speaking.

    the contest is finished.\r\n\r\nI won third place. Although I still haven't seen
    the other place winning entries, as this was held interstate and they didn't send
    images with the letter I received. Hopefully they will soon add it to their website.\r\n\r\nOh,

    It's pretty rare that a font is recognized in a general design competition - good
    going. So/but let me ask: are you still looking for crits?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
