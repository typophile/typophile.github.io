  see to find the right one anywhere or have any luck with your typical font identification
  services. It's been used by several places, notably, The Bitter Southern, These
  Wild Plains, and Austin Eastciders. Found several that are close (particular on
  the 'S' and 'C' sharp angle cuts), but the real definer I cannot match is on the
  'W', where the middle is much shorter than the two sides.\r\n\r\nAny help would
  be amazing and AWESOME.\r\n\r\nCheers!"
