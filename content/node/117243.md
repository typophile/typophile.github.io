  body: "Clevercrows, could you give a little info on how and where this will be used?
    And is this on a flat or rounded surface?\r\n\r\nTo my eyes, the lettering seems
    to be too much. You've got the fancy letters, the fill in the letters, the shadow
    which maybe has its own fill, and the varying of the shadow for the 3-dimensional
    look. To me, it just seems distracting. I would like to see this without the shadow
    at all. The fill of the letters looks nice (very equine) but it does give a light
    horizontal streak through the letters about mid-height. Is this intended? The
    horse's head seems like an after thought. It looks kind of bolted on rather than
    an integral part. But it might be okay, depending on the use. Those are my thoughts.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Agree with J. Tillman's comments. We really need to know more about the company
    before we can judge the logo properly, but the 3D effect is distracting, especially
    since it makes the letters look liked they are wrapped around some invisible object.
    And the horse head symbol is too small. I would either make the head larger to
    be the dominant element, perhaps with the type below it, or else draw some lines
    so the type and symbol are all enclosed within a common shape (think of how the
    old MGM logo handled the lion head). \r\n\r\nBut it's a start; keep working on
    it.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thank you J. Tillman and JamesM for your response to my post and to the great
    advice!\r\n\r\nThis is the very first logo I have ever tried to create. It sure
    is fun trying!\r\n\r\nThis is a horse trail ride, riding lesson, and horse rescue
    barn (soon to be 501c3 non profit). This is where I go for unguided horseback
    riding. The girl that runs this rescue mentioned that they were looking for a
    new fresh logo, so I am just messing around to see if I can come up with anything.
    Like I said, I have no idea what I am doing.\r\n\r\nI used Corel WordPerfect's
    Textart (which uses a textbox) and this was my first try. After I saved it, I
    immediately went back to change the part I didn't care for at all, which is all
    of that gold shadow/fill, which is way too much! I wasn't too sure about the arch/bend
    to the lettering, but I wanted to first see what the result would be once I cleaned
    it up. \r\n\r\nWell, it turns out that once I open up the Textart textbox, it
    changes completely (the font, color, fill). The only thing that stays is the spelling
    of the two words. I have tried everything, but I cannot edit it at all! So I put
    it aside and gave the project some thought.\r\n\r\nFirst, I did a google image
    search to see what styles of horse/equine logos that exist. I noticed that the
    majority seem to be of some type of black and white outline of a horse head or
    an outline of a horse running. I wanted something a little different and unique.
    I noticed that in a lot of the logos I found, the name seems to get lost and does
    not stand out at first glance. I thought it makes more sense to have the name
    as the primary focus and have the image a secondary enhancement. Then I realized
    that the letter placement of the two words was going to be a bit of a challenge
    with my lack of experience (as far as selecting a font).\r\n\r\nA lot of fonts
    look nice until you put a \"capital E\" next to a \"qu\", then it suddenly looks
    strange. A lot of fonts have funky looking \"q\"s and capital \"E\"s, in my opinion.
    I personally love the font in the logo, just not all of the extra. You are right,
    way too much going on. If only I could edit it! There wasn't much choice as far
    as the color and pattern of the lettering, but I thought it was okay, and I think
    that the horse picture in a weird matches as far as the color scheme.\r\n\r\nTHEN,
    I watched a couple of videos on general guidelines and advice on logos and types
    of fonts, etc....and realized that I had it all wrong! The video suggested to
    never use any type of 3D text or coloring, because you need to consider the different
    possibilities that people could do with it. If someone happened to print it, it
    could very likely print out all messed up and unreadable. Especially if they did
    not print it in color. It pointed out to always use a font type that is very readable
    and printable in black and white and in greyscale. Makes a lot of sense! I did
    it all completely opposite.\r\n\r\nI have a few other ideas, but for some reason
    I keep going back to my original first rough draft. I like it for some reason.
    I like it because to me it is not perfect by all means, but it stands out, is
    unique and original, and it is different than all of the other equine type of
    logos that I have seen. I know it is very homemade looking, but I kind of think
    its flaws are what gives it character.\r\n\r\nI know all that sounds pretty strange.
    I thought I would post it and get your opinions and go from there. At least I
    am having a fun trying. I am not the type of person that is creative at anything.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again, I will keep on trying!"

  body: Hi. The cluttered lettering has an interesting texture that goes well with
    the horse head, and I can see why you like it - it has the crafty hands-on look
    of worked leather.  Legibility will become a problem in some situations - for
    example if it is printed really small on a  letterhead, or on a sign seen from
    the distance.  Make a black and white version without color and if textures create
    a messy washed-out effect erase some portions, for example the "edge" of the lettering"
    or else make some parts solid black.   Then colorize that in two or three colors
    to see how things look. Use layers to add background color or outline.  In any
    case the horse should be much larger compared to the lettering. If you can make
    the lettering on a semicircular line, the lower part of a circle, the horse can
    be at the center. Try that. If you put lettering and horse within an outline shape,
    say a semicircle, everything will look nice and compact. Good luck and have fun!

  body: "Clevercrows, it sounds like you are on the right track. Stay with your ideas.
    I also like (what I think was) your original idea.\r\n\r\nAsk your customer in
    what format she needs the logo. For print, it might be two forms: a color graphic
    such as a PNG file at 300 dots per inch and a black and white graphic at 3oo dots
    per inch. Or it might be part of Corel or Microsoft Word template for writing
    letters. For internet use it might be a JPG file at a lesser dots per inch. Maybe
    Corel permits saving a file as, or exporting as, a graphic format.\r\n\r\nIf you
    are looking for a free graphics program, I would recommend Paint.net. There is
    a learning curve, but it's do-able.\r\nhttp://www.getpaint.net/"

  body: "> The video suggested to never use any type of 3D text \r\n\r\nIn general
    that's good advice. There are occasions when 3D makes sense, but since this is
    your first logo I'd keep it simple.\r\n\r\n> or coloring\r\n\r\nThis is an area
    that's changing. In the past most everything got printed at a print shop, so more
    colors meant more expense, and a color logo would look bad in a Xerox or fax.
    These days many companies do most of their promotional work over the web or in
    emails, where color is free, and most companies email instead of sending faxes.
    But Xeroxing might still a factor if your client prepares promotional materials
    that. \r\n\r\nYou definitely want a good black-and-white version of the logo to
    use when needed, but if your client is using the web then color may not be as
    big an issue these days."

  body: "I've never been a fan of the \"Word Art\" function in MS Word and similar
    applications; the results invariably look like something one might have used for
    the title banner of a personal homepage 20 years ago when the internet was still
    young. In particular, when the results are pixely, hard to read, bent and distorted,
    it does more harm than good.\r\n\r\nThe font and the horsehead illustration don't
    strike me as particularly good choices either. The font feels old-fashioned to
    me (I mistook it for Zapf Chancery at first sight), and it suffers from the horizontal
    compression. You wouldn't squash a photograph to half its width, would you? The
    same thing happens with letters. If you absolutely need it that narrow, use a
    narrow font. As for the horse, I'm getting a meek and hapless vibe from it. The
    cut also reminds me of a wall-mounted trophy a bit.\r\n\r\nDon't be disheartened,
    though; nobody gets it right in the first try. Keep working on it! I suggest trying
    out a slab serif, and maybe experimenting with a more symbolic graphic."
