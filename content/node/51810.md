  as gallery images on the font's page at Myfonts when the thing goes online next
  week.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/make_samples_6256.gif]\r\n\r\nI
  want groovy, hip, artful uses of this new thing called <strong>j a b b e r w u b</strong>.
  You have to have very good color sense and loads of taste. I want very realistic
  uses that look like fully developed advertising comps. Mmkay? Things like soft drink
  packaging and brand collateral you would see in a magazine or on a billboard, poster
  ads and so on, and so forth, etcetera.\r\n\r\nj a m e s\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
