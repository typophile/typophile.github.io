  body: I would like to find a font that looks hand-lettered, and if there is no font
    with the normal width font AND the compressed, I think I would prefer the compressed
    one. <BR>The purpose is to make the same graphism, but with a diferent message
    and context, but I need to get a very similar ambient.
