body: "In another Typophile thread, \"The best fonts you can't have\", I had mentioned
  Antikva Margaret and how I wished someone would digitize this wonderful forgotten
  face. While no one has yet to do this, I had mentioned another font I loved too-
  York by George Salden.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/jorvik-informal.font\r\n\r\nI
  know very little about it. It was released by Visual Graphics Corporation in 1966.
  There was a bold and black weight and that's it.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jorvik_4325.png]\r\nAndreas
  H\xF6feld has done a digitization of York called Jorvik. While for the most part
  the glyphs are true to the original design, there are many details that have been
  rendered imprecisely or flat out badly. And technically the font has very bad kerning
  and line spacing. But for the price of free I can use it and enjoy it for its beauty.\r\n\r\nYork's
  alphabets evoke the idiosyncrasies of carved linoleum or some other chiseled surface
  by way of its variable stroke widths. Its eccentric too. Notice these looped lowercase
  alphabets y,k,w and v- all unique to York. Also the tops of many of the lowercase
  and capital letters have a peculiar stress- lowercase b, e, g, i, o and p. The capitals
  are not without their unique features either. Notice the overall incised look and
  the asymmetrical spurs in the E, K, N, and T. And my favorite glyph?- the lowercase
  w. It looks like a flower.\r\nYes, York is organic and filled with unique details
  that makes this typeface both powerful for display and endearing for (very) short
  captions. \r\n\r\nAnd it is for powerful display work that you can appreciate the
  uncommon York in one of the worlds most recognizable cosmetic brands- Clinque. I
  have always wondered what is that font! Then a few nights ago I was looking at some
  old Insti-Type pressure transfers sheets. There was Antikva Margaret and York and
  some other 'goodies'. I looked them over several times and then while I was looking
  at York- click! The Clinique logo font! While probably the most trivial revelation
  in my life it was an enjoyable one none the less.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/clinique_splash_logo_3414.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/clq_63M8_250_5237.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/clq_6606_250_6080.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/CLINIQUEISYORK_3729.png]\r\nSo
  the next time your in the mall and you feel a \"Bonus Time\" lipstick tote coming
  on, take a gander at the Clinique counter and check out Georg Salden's York in use
  for all its eccentric ways.\r\n\r\n;-)\r\nMikey\r\n\r\n\r\nPS... I attached a 'specimen'
  of Jorvik. You can leave a comment about the design as well. I'm a student and constructive
  criticism helps. Thanks again."
