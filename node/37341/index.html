The issue is instead that he claims he was wrongly portrayed as deeply involved in the story, when he was largely just the narrator. And then he was made the fall guy. And the story itself, if not the document, was true: Bush was AWOL and a draft dodger. 

It's probably foolish of Rather to sue, but I wouldn't be surprised if his claims turn out to be largely true.  </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I guess I compare this in part to the Don Imus thing from a contractual level . . .

The question remains was he fired or did he resign? If it is the latter, I wouldn't think he has much wiggle room to negotiate a settlement but if it was the former, chances are he would've had some clauses in in contract that requires some sort of financial buyout. . .

Personally I have no opinion on the reasons for dismissal, I'm only throwing in an opinion from the perspective of his contractual employment and make no mistake even network evening news anchors have contracts much closer to actors and singers than employees . . .

CBS seems to have scapegoated him, but the network new division took a huge credibility hit as well—after all, most people realized that Dan was just a talking head and that plenty of other people were involved. Combine this with some of his crappier programs on Discovery—especially the no-class “Plastic Planes” scare piece—and it seems like Dan is having some pretty big senior moments.</div>

my take is he shouldered some of the blame for the story (although he shouldn't have) and, ulimately left CBS to be a 'team player.' but when CBS CONTINUED to publicly shove the blame at him, ruining the rep he'd built over all those years, he finally decided 'enough is enough.' </div>

Yes, that is more exact. But he also apparently didn't report for duty later in his Air National Guard career. Probably AWOL is also an exaggeration, but it is a near relative.

Where does that come from? I'm sure Rather would have been just as happy getting a scoop that exposed Kerry in a bad light. He is a newsman. That is the job.

Actually, our friend Thomas Phinney was the one who showed pretty conclusively that the work was forged. You should look up his reports.</div>

I agree, Bill. Resting too much on this evidence will help him greatly. I think he'll do better focusing his attention on how CBS treated him. Considering how much the media is having a field day bashing Katie Couric (with those internally at CBS also discrediting her) I would think it shouldn't be too hard to make that case.</div>
