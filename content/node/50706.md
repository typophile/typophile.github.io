  logotype (well, I think so at least).\r\n\r\nAre there anyone in here who can help
  me find a font in the same style as the logotype. Just a point in the right direction
  would be very helpful.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n\r\nBest regards\r\nPeter"

    the family of my old school English teacher Mr Wilson.\r\n\r\nThe logo was like
    that when I was at school over 30 years ago, and probably a lot longer before
    that.\r\n\r\nNick Cooke"
