body: does anyone know of any books that show photos of lettering that includes awesome
  ligatures as in the sample attached. i've been wanting to do a cyrillic version
  that does the kind of thing that [[Ed Interlock]] does, based on this old church
  lettering which actually incorporates this kind of thing. anyhow, any leads are
  appreciated. thnx.

    target=\"_blank\">vyaz</a></em>. It is discussed and shown in a great number of
    Russian (and non-Russian) books on paleography and early printing. One good source

    1963, but the titles are many. A fairly good listing of Russian books on type

  body: "yes, thank you Maxim! for some reason i seem to be rather impressed with
    the lettering (as well as all the artwork) inside the Spac na Krovi in Petersburg.
    It's been 6 years since i was there now, so i can't remember whether there was
    any [[vyaz]] in the mosaics in that particular church or not. i remember thinking
    that that style of lettering was particularly exquisite. i've been kicking myself
    for not buying a photo book on the spot, but wondering if i could still find one.
    can you recommend any online bookstores, Maxim? Oh, and I bought a ring with the
    inscription \"\u0413\u043E\u0441\u043F\u043E\u0434\u0438 \u0421\u043F\u0430\u0441\u0438

    (Lord, save and keep me) but i've lost it now. I wonder if i could find that online
    too..."

  body: I filled in the wiki entry for vyaz', but now I'm getting the 'Access Denied'
    bug again. The compressed letterforms used in vyaz' begin life in Greek uncial
    lettering, and are related to the style of lettering often employed in Orthodox
    icons. In vyaz', the letters are compressed even more, and made to interlock in
    a variety of ways (shared stems, stacking, enclosure).
