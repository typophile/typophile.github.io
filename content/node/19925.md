body: "Okay, potentially stupid question: Does anyone know the history of the use
  of the baseline grid? Is it something that has been in use throughout the history
  of typography, or just something that was popularized by programs like Quark and
  InDesign, which make its implementation easy? I've read numerous books on typography,
  design, and their related histories, and none of them make any mention of baseline
  grid at all. Google only seems to turn up tutorials for page layout software.\r\n\r\nIf
  anyone could enlighten me or point me in the direction of enlightenment, I'd be
  very grateful."

    in a break from Ancient Greece (who generally preferred a centerline \"around\"
    which the letters would float), who standardized the double lines (baseline and
    cap-height) within which everything (except the ideologically vestigal \"Q\")
    must fit, snell!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    you could buy pre-printed sheets with light blue grids (so the camera couldn't
    pick them up) to use for paste-up (large publications had batches printed up).\r\nTim"
