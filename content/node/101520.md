body: "Dear typophile people!\r\n\r\nNow, for the first time, you can see something
  concrete from GlobalType. Here is a first layout consisting out of six POIs (Points
  Of Interest).\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\n\r\n1. GoogleEarth has to be installed in
  an actual version.\r\n\r\n2. The oceanographic map of Marie Tharp and H. C. Berann
  should be activated. If you don't use it yet, you may find it here:\r\n\r\n<http://www.google.de/gadgets/directory?synd=earth&hl=de&preview=on&cat=terrain_elevation&id=896376123364>\r\n\r\n3.
  The KMZ file that you can download using the following URL can, after the download,
  be opened with a double-click. This should open GoogleEarth and imports the GlobalType
  POIs into the sidebar. This should work with Windows, Macintosh and Linux.\r\n\r\n<http://www.global-type.org/fileadmin/user_upload/GoogleEarth/GlobalType.kmz>\r\n\r\nI
  hope somebody of you may find the time for making expeditions in this collection,
  telling me your impressions here. Don't care that the text is in German language,
  you later will find localized versions. Please tell me if you are running into problems."

    then displays the error message.\r\n\r\n::edit:: Got it to work by dropping the
    file onto Google Earth app rather than double-clicking."
