  body: Hmm. Seems to be modified version of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/bauer-bodoni/italic/testdrive.html?s=1234567890&p=72">Bauer
    Bodoni</a>. Ball terminals removed, a serif removed here and there, roughen up
    with a filter, and you've got it.

  body: "Thanks for the reply Mark .\r\n.\r\n.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking as the typeface
    is being used in a flash script it must be a FONT\r\n\r\nrather than a treated
    version of BODONI . it certainly looks like it may be a variant\r\n\r\nof BAUER
    BODONI; but I would suppose that is indeed a font.\r\n\r\nAny other suggestions
    : : : \r\n\r\nI'll keep looking . My Thanks \r\n\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\naerosyn.lex\r\n\r\n\r\n.

  body: 'Well, I did a sneaky thing: I downloaded the swf and imported it into Flash.
    Of course, it tells me the font is missing, but it does tell me the name: Magritte.
    No idea where it''s from, though. It didn''t show up in any of the major font
    vendor sites. Could be a custom font.'
