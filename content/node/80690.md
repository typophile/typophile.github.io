  of claims has resulted in a search for evidence to back those claims, and, though
  I have seen this with my own eyes, I cannot find what I am thinking of. Or rather,
  what I am thinking o\u0192.\r\n\r\nMy query is three\u0192old:\r\n\r\n1. What is
  the proper name of \u0192? Windows Character Map calls it \"Latin Small Letter F
  With Hook.\" That sounds donkey, but I can't come up with a better name. All I can
  think of is, \"You know, the eff you use when you're writing a function in math.\"
  \r\n\r\n2. When (90s?) and why (ease of typing? sorting?) did the practice of prefacing
  or appending folder names with \u0192 on Mac OS come into practice, and how widespread
  was this practice? The latter question leads me to 3.\r\n\r\n3. This is where my
  conversation got interesting. I feel like the use of this \"Fancy F\" in wordmarks,
  particularly those set in Didone, was very trendy somewhere in the early nineties
  (perhaps coincidental with the nascence of desktop publishing?) But since I don't
  know how to search for this \u0192, I don't know how to do any research on this
  topic.\r\n\r\nSo, wt\u0192 is it called?\r\n\r\n"

    it used in a wordmark, it wasn't set in italic. It's usually just a florin (thanks!)
    used instead of an f for flourish."
