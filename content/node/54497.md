  The only way to learn is doing so I\xB4ve started my first font - nothing cool,
  just a start. So I have some problems that will describe:\r\n\r\n- I build the font,
  install using Suitcase and when open Illustrator, go thought the menu, it appears
  but why it said BOLD in the next menu (weight menu) since I change it everywhere
  in Font Info (fontlab) and use a custom name for it?\r\n\r\n- This one kind of scary
  me. When using the font in illustrator, it feels so tiny in 12pt for example. Is
  there anyway to change the sizes?\r\n\r\nTHANKS A LOT!"

    of a glyph, that might give people more to work with for you.
