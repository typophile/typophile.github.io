body: 'hi everyone. forgive me if i am missing a thread that would have answered this
  question already, but i am designing a series of brochures for a church arts camp.
  the camp is designed for children ages 5-11 and they will be doing photography,
  clay,  painting, and theater. i''m looking for a font that is fun, but not one of
  those sloppy "looks-like-a-kid-drew-it" ones. ideas? favorites? '

    on the traditional Roman. OR,  take a look at Ranunculus by Carl Crossgrove, a
    really nice sans that has a subtle bounce.\r\n\r\nMichael\r\n\r\np.s. what a delightful
    background you have!"

    it possible that Carl is a gardener in secret?"

  body: "you mentioned you wanted a;\r\n\r\n\"sloppy \u201Clooks-like-a-kid-drew-it\u201D
    ones.\"????\r\n\r\nThis is possibly in the worst genre of typefaces ever to be
    created.\r\n\r\nMy advise is to keep away fro any fonts along these lines. They're
    all disgusting.\r\n\r\nIf you want that sloppy look, write the word yourself and
    scan it in, that would hold so much more purpose, and look way better."
