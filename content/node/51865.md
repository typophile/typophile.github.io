  body: "Where did you get these samples? This one looks like someone took [[http://www.identifont.com/find?font=friz+quadrata|Friz
    Quadrata]] and made a light version.\r\nThe [[http://typophile.com/node/51864|other
    sample]] looks like a [[http://www.identifont.com/find?font=trajan|Trajan]] clone."

  body: "Yep, that's Quadrata, aka \"the one from Law & Order.\"  I've never seen
    that Light version, though.  \r\n\r\nThe other one is definitely Trajanesque,
    but serifs are a bit different and the S is prettier.  Plus the example (from
    the cover of Joy Division's 'Closer') predates Trajan by almost a decade. "

  body: 'Gorgeous typeface, but it''s not Friz Quadrata at all. FQ has a weird rounded
    component to it that''s missing here entirely, also a different proportion. '
