		<div class="commentbody">I know what's behind this. I submitted all of my fonts to Identifont last year.  <BR> <BR>I had a similar thing happen when I tried AGFA's Identifont thing to search my own fonts. The Identifont database includes lots of fonts that AGFA doesn't sell. It also uses a system for matching fonts based on a sort of 20 questions strategy. Fonts that give roughly the same answers will be grouped together. This will usually identify the correct font, but the &quot;similar&quot; fonts won't necessarilly look the same.  <BR> <BR>A more subtle problem I found was that it correctly identified fonts of mine that are licensed to FontHaus, but incorrectly stated that they were unavailable from AGFA, despite the fact that FontHause sublicenses all of them to AGFA. You can even find them on the AGFA site by other means. This is because the Identifont database only knows about the main licensee, not the sublicensees. If you go to the Identifont site and search for fonts, it will display links to whatever sources it knows about. But when AGFA uses it, they change the results so if the source isn't AGFA, they offer the &quot;similar&quot; fonts they do sell and hide the links to the other foundries and distributors.  <BR> <BR>It's kind of stinky, but then I don't really like it as much when someone buys one of my fonts from a sublicensee like AFGA instead of FontHaus since I only get half my usual cut. So I don't really care.  <BR> <BR>If you like the Identifont system, use it on their own site (<A HREF="http://www.identifont.com" TARGET="_top"><a href="http://www.identifont.com">http://www.identifont.com</a></A>) and not on AGFA's site. You'll get less biased purchasing information.  <BR> <BR>The most ironic thing for me is that the only other typeface that matches my Proxima Sans, according to Identifont, is Arial. Excuse me while I go shoot myself&hellip;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">There is one distributor that is doing it right. <BR> <BR>I'm often surprised how accurate MyFonts.com's <BR>&quot;see also&quot; suggestions are. As far as I can <BR>tell, related fonts are found solely by matching  <BR>keywords. As long as whoever enters the keywords  <BR>for each font is smart and thorough, the first few  <BR>results are decent. <BR> <BR>An example: <A HREF="http://www.myfonts.com/MoreLike?id=9575" TARGET="_blank">&quot;more fonts like&quot;</A> Mark Simonson's  <BR>wonderful <A HREF="http://www.myfonts.com/FontFamily9575.html" TARGET="_blank">Blakely</A>. <BR> <BR>Yes, there are plenty of narrow art deco faces  <BR>missing on this page, but this system has a lot  <BR>of potential if some more work is put into the  <BR>keywording.
