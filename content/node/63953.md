  might do a little project in the hours that I feel able enough. I am taking some
  favorite lines from Swann's Way, the first book from In Search of Lost Time, and
  translate it visually \u2013 through type, photography and layout \u2013 not restricting
  myself too much.\r\n\r\nI would love some of your thoughts on the typographical
  dimension of this idea. My main concern is to honor the words, the meaning, but
  present them as artworks in themselves. All perspectives are welcome: artistic,
  historic, intellectual, whatever.\r\n\r\nCiao,\r\nBas"

    to such a question easier, and more fun. Maybe you could show us some of your
    sketches or ideas, it will give us an idea where you wanna go with this.\r\n\r\nAnd
    having attempted something simular once (though not Proust) I can only give you
    one really good advise: Don't 'respect' the texts too much, make them your own,
    and just start making things when the words 'inspire' you. Being overly respectful
    will only stifle your creativity (awful word, I know...), making it look forced
    and overloaded with intended meaning. At least: that's my experience ;)\r\n\r\nLooking
    forward to 'your' Proust!\r\n\r\nJeffrey\r\n[[http://www.infraordinaire.com/wordpress|infraordinaire]]"

  body: "Dear Jeffrey,\r\n\r\nI really appreciate your take on respecting the text.
    I think that typographically, I do not want to be too innovative. I want to create
    a contrast between the highly expressive and abstract visual representation of
    the words, and the words themselves (not over-interpreted). The main idea is to
    reinterpret some of the scenes, people, thoughts, feelings through imagery. Your
    comment does inspire me to keep the option open of throwing my approach out the
    window as soon as I notice that I am approaching quasi-intellectual territory.\r\n\r\nCiao,\r\nBas"

  body: I would like to see this. And I agree with Jeffrey that you shouldn't limit
    yourself. Ultimately, this is about YOUR art. Proust is dead. He doesn't care.
    And how many people -- in this day and age -- have actually read Proust? Not many.
    But almost anyone can enjoy a nice piece of art, and maybe it will inspire a few
    people to read <em>Swann's Way</em>.
