body: I am interested if any of you can think of any logos or type treatments of extremely
  long company names - preferably in a traditional style. I am currently working on
  an identity that is kicking my butt.  <BR> <BR>The Center for Aesthetic and Implant
  Dentistry <BR> <BR>I had worked up some  ideas, but they were a little too contemporary
  for the client &#40;well actually for his wife&#41; - they want it to reflect the
  same style they are decorating the new place &#40;cart before the horse - happens
  all the time to me&#41; They have chosen a very elegant style with brocades, lots
  of scrollwork, chevrons, deep colors, and even griffins. Also being in Louisville
  there is the ubiquitous fleur de lis &#40;city symbol&#41;. I have come up with
  some solutions that are... eh ok but still seem somewhat generic. The only one that
  I really am feelling anything from is the one below. <BR> <BR>The critique I need
  is twofold. Do either ofthe two type treatments work for anyone. When I keep all
  the words the same I either end up with something that is blah or my eyes just get
  lost about halfway through - this was my attempt at adding some breathing room in
  the name. I also feel like the typeface should be traditional and needs to be a
  titling font like trajan or requiem or Felix, as I think anything too scripty is
  too difficult to navigate easily and will be hell at reduced sizes - I also keep
  getting the vibe when I try Upper and Lower case that it makes it look less like
  a company name and more like a tagline - It gives it too much Title or Sentence
  structure &#40;does that even make sense?&#41;. So any suggestions about type would
  be most appreciated. <BR> <BR>The second critique I want is of the symbol itself.
  I used several Bickham ornaments to piece together a fleur de lis that is unique
  in our area - though they are everywhere - whenever there is an interesting interpretation
  it actually revives it somewhat. But does this work, is the construction ok with
  line weight and everything? Or does it seem all fluff and no matter &#40;which I
  guess could be part and parcel with anything along these lines anyway - kind of
  like eating a merringue - yummy air&#41;. <BR> <BR>Help me typophiles before I run
  out of energy to even type the name of this practice one more time...<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/40609.jpg"

    but where the decisions are made by the the owner&#39;s wife and she wants the
    new logo to be identical to the new chairs, or rugs, or carpets... <BR> <BR>Of
    the the designs I like the first one best, the one that isn&#39;t mixing regular
    and italic. <BR> <BR>What they need is a new name. If they&#39;re not already
    doing so, they will sooner or later start to say &#34;C.A.I.D.&#34;, which is
    even worse than the long name. <BR> <BR>But I guess wanting to create a new name
    is wishful thinking, there&#39;s nothing doing when dealing with a small firm,
    let alone a small firm where design decisions is made by the owner&#39;s wife.
    <BR> <BR>Come to think of it: the &#42;very worst&#42; design project is the one
    where you are in contact with the owner, but where the decisions are made by the
    the owner&#39;s wife and she wants the new logo to be identical to the new chairs,

  body: sounds like an interesting job. how tied are you to using the fluere de lis
    imagery? it seems some &#40;scanned?&#41; ornamentation from the baroque period
    might work better than the bickham ornaments. I have to admit, though, that i
    can&#39;t help having a negative reaction to bickham in general after designing
    and printing way too many wedding invitation sets. <BR> <BR>have you considered
    poetica for the type? it might be too heavy, but some ornamented initial letters
    and such could be really nice.  <BR> <BR>to my eye, the symbol feels a little
    light.. it might disappear at small sizes. <BR> <BR>maybe dentistry on the same
    line as aesthetic and implant would work? then &#34;the center for&#34; could
    be smaller?

  body: The typeface on your first example looks better to me. I think using small
    caps is a good choice, it gives a solid feel. However i would rather not vary
    the font sizes. Makes reading the name somehow bumpy and i feel emphasizing the
    words doesn&#39;t actually help. The name as a whole looks a little out of balance
    like you have it now. <BR>The symbol is nice, but like others said, it needs a
    little more weight. And maybe you can extend the ornaments downwards to embrace
    the name so it connects everything.

  body: The fleure-de-lis you created is lovely but i second &#40;or third Ben&#39;s
    comment that it is too light&#41; I too prefer your first design with all roman
    characters. <BR> <BR>Have you thought of using an ampersand instead of &#34;and&#34;?
    You could use a flourishy type to mirror the fleure-de-lis and better intergrate
    the symbol with the type. <BR> <BR>The Composition seems too symetrical and yet
    not symetrical enough.  I&#39;ll try to clarify. Because the words are so balanced
    small Big small, then Big small Big I want them to be exactly centered but because
    &#34;aesthetic&#34; has more letters than &#34;Implant&#34; it&#39;s just a little
    off. That said I&#39;m not so sure about my ampersand suggestion. Placing it smack
    dab in the center of all that type may put too much emphasis on the character.
    How does it look if the type is to the right of the symbol, kind of tucked into
    the downward curly-Q?

  body: In this instance, perhaps, the fleur de lis doesn&#39;t need to be big and
    bold. I wonder if the focus shouldn&#39;t be upon the company name and the fleur
    used as accent.  This leaves the fleur open for size interpretation as well as
    allowing it to be light, airy, elegant, and a little non-descript.  <BR> <BR>I
    like the idea of mixing scripts, in this application, with the roman. However
    what if you chose a lighter version of bickham and made it larger, even to the
    point of mixing in &#40;joining&#41; with the others?

  body: 'Thanks for your ideas and critiques - I will try to put a few of them to
    work - in the meantime, I had already fleshed out a few things and this is where
    I am so far - I tried to find a middle ground between the two and chose requiem
    using its italics and small caps so that I could have the breathing room while
    keeping the font closer to the same origin - whaddya think? Also, I too was worried
    about using the fleur at too small of a size so I kept it rather large on many
    of the pieces in the stationery. I have tried other configurations of the text
    and my eye keeps coming back to this one as being the most consistent with his
    traditional tastes. Here is one of the other options I played around with. BTW
    the tan is PMS 871 metallic gold not just a dirty tan as it may appear. I also
    am uploading a sample with the new type, a sample with the positions changed and
    a bolder fleur and a sample with a truncated fleur. <BR> <BR>Does anyone have
    a suggestion on a way to keep the typestyles and flavor of this rendition but
    eliminate the near miss between the R in Center and the f in for? <BR> <BR><!--attachment:

  body: i think you made a good choice with the smallcaps and i really like your fleur,
    it&#39;s very elegant. <BR>To avoid the near miss of the tail of the R- you could
    always tweak it in illustrator to make it less &#34;swashy&#34; in that instance.
    <BR>one thing i&#39;d kinda like to see... a version with the fleur in the background
    as a kind of watermark. <BR>it&#39;s looking great! keep up the good work!
