  on Goudy's 'Deepdene'.\r\n\r\nI am looking for the following:\r\n- Any general comments\r\n-
  Similar alternative typefaces\r\n- Any comparisions you see between 'Deepdene' or
  similar typefaces\r\n- Any pros or cons which you would like to point out\r\n\r\nI
  am looking for industry quotes from users. If you wouldn't mind popping down your
  role in the industry.\r\n\r\nAlso if someone has the typeface, do you think it would
  be possilbe for you to make a heading and outline the heading, I just need the name
  'Deepdene'. Its up to you.\r\n\r\nURL of 'Deepdene' \u2013 http://www.bertholdtypes.com/gifs/type_lib/pkg/90147000.gif\r\n\r\nThanks

  body: "Hi Liam. Good call on Deepdene, it\u2019s my favourite of Goudy\u2019s typefaces.
    Walter Tracy talks briefly about it in his <cite>Letters of Credit</cite>, p.
    121\u2013122 (<a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/books/typedesign-history#000217\">bibliographic
    entry</a>), mantaining that Goudy was fascinated by Van Krimpen\u2019s own Lutetia
    typeface while drawing Deepdene. You might want to look up the similarities and
    differences between the two. Also of note is the italic which is strangely upright
    as far as italics go, but it works remarkably well in my opinion. Another later
    serif typeface with very vertical italics is Eric Gill\u2019s Joanna, another
    of my favourites."

  body: "You should also be aware of [[http://www.p22.com/lanston/products/deepdene.html|P22's
    version of Deepdene]], which is probably more complete, as well as reasonably
    priced. I haven't compared them. \r\n\r\nAs far as similarity, Goudy repeated
    himself a lot with variations, so comparing Deepdene to his other faces would
    be interesting. \r\n\r\n "

  body: I've got P22/LTC Deepdene, which is more accurate and extremely beautiful.
    But it isn't much good for text, being terribly light, with long descenders, and
    if I remember rightly (I haven't used it for ages) terrible kerning. The BQ version
    is nicely dark, well and closely spaced, has shortened descenders and makes a
    good if adventurous book type. Goudy Kaatskill is close cousin to Deepdene, with
    the advantage of having been given the once-over by Colin Kahn after Jim Rimmer's
    initial revival with an excellent Deepdene-based italic. It is a less startling
    type (it even has a horizontal bar on e), with good weight and spacing, and is
    very usable. Neither have bold fonts, which is fine by me.
