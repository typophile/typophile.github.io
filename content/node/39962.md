  body: "Thanks peeps,\r\n\r\nsomehow I din't get alerts for your replies... Must
    check the settings then..\r\n\r\nThe image you see is jsut a part of a pdf file
    and when it was given to me I thought: \"Gooooood, \r\nsome vectors!!\".\r\nJust
    to discover that no, that wasn't the case. It was just a pdf with a jpeg in it...
    :-|\r\n\r\nI do not think that it was completely done by hand, but I will double-check
    on that.\r\n\r\nTrouble is that this word is part of the Bar's name that has to
    be vectorised to be scaled\r\nand printed - by your truly own - on the canopy
    outside the bar...\r\n\r\nIt looks like there's some work for Inkscape here....\r\n\r\nBack
    to work now...\r\n\r\nAnd no, Nick, I don't like it. My fave right now seems to
    be Dirty Headline\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmove your feet\r\nto the smoking beat"
