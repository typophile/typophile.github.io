<p>hello friendly people of the type world. I have spent my Easter weekend working on my first little type-face project. Which i have called &lsquo;ill sans&rsquo;. Being a novice at such things i thought I&rsquo;d start out with an homage to a classic. That way i have a much needed reference point. I have always been intrigued by the black sheep of the gill sans family—the ultra bold weight. It seems so comical and quirky compared to the rest of it&rsquo;s family, which seems, well, quite serious. It&rsquo;s like that Hawaiian shirt i like to wear to work on casual fridays. Anyway, i digress. What i wanted to do was make a kooky rounded hand-rendered version, that was less 70s and more party. I thought it would go nicely with some illustrations that i&rsquo;d been working on for a little recipe book i&rsquo;m putting together.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/ill_sans_recipe_6571.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This font is obviously just for display purposes. So i thought I&rsquo;d try it out for that specific purpose in my recipe book. I&rsquo;ve paired it with Ludwig, because: although they may have a different heritage, I find Ludwig to be a beautifully refreshing alternative to Gill Sans. I figured they could be friends.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/ill_sans_header_5677.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>But what i would love to hear is: some feedback. obviously it is pretty clumsy, but that might be part of it&rsquo;s charm? but some letters seem a lot darker in shade than others. but it&rsquo;s kind of like that with Gill Sans Ultra Bold&hellip;</p>
<p>things i have changed: i&rsquo;ve given the l a tail, and made a single and double storied a. Can&rsquo;t decide which one i prefer as the default. Also—can i expect to get a cease and desist from Monotype?! Looking forward to hearing your aesthetic and legal and otherwise expert advice.</p>
<p>Steve</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Steve</p>
<p>Surprised nobody has commented on this one.  I like it a lot, which is strange considering I hate Gill Sans Ultra Bold.  I can see it being useful, and your examples in the recipe book look great.  I think as long as you haven&rsquo;t used a digital version of Gill Sans as a starting point and just messed around with some curves, you shouldn&rsquo;t expect any heat from Monotype, Adobe etc.  The name might be tempting fate though!</p>
<p>Regarding the actual design:</p>
<ol>
<li>I like the tail on the l</li>
<li>I prefer the single storey a, but keep the double storey as alternate</li>
<li>lower case i - I never understood that silly little tittle in GSUltra, and changing it might be a good way to get away from comparisons - maybe have a wide oval tittle, or drop the stem hight to make room for a big circle</li>
<li>ff looks like crashing glyphs - make a ligature with smoother connection</li>
<li>On the subject of ligatures, either make a load of double letter ones with different wobbles or (even better) make a whole set of alternates and code them to alternate - good article about this by Nick Shinn on I Love Typography at the moment</li>
<li>A few useful dingbats - hands, arrows, stars, borders, frames etc. in a similar style to the mouth illustration above would be a nice addition to the font</li>
</ol>
<p>Cheers
Dave</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I hate gill sans in general, but this is seriously good. The reason (I guess) why you haven&rsquo;t recieved much feedback is because you don&rsquo;t show a simple a-z &amp; A-Z sample.</p>
<p>The only thing that isn&rsquo;t working IMO is the top of the t. Make it curve the other way, so that the triangle becomes larger.</p>
<p>The dots on i and j (tittles) are often small in Display fonts of this kind, but I&rsquo;d like to see larger ones as an alternate.</p>
<p>PLEASE DON&rsquo;T STOP WORKING ON THIS. I&rsquo;d say this has great commercial potential if you select the right audience.</p>
<p>Cheers,
Jasper de Waard</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>BTW: what&rsquo;s the typeface you used for the text &ldquo;Beat egg yolks&hellip;Fold in firm&rdquo; in your sample above?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ill sans&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t sound fun enough IMO. How about &lsquo;Waffle&rsquo; ?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thank you Dave and Jasper for your comments! Unfortunately i was burgled and my laptop and the backup to my laptop were stolen. So I&rsquo;m back to square one on this but thanks for your feedback, I am encouraged to give this font another go. Should be easier the second time round. Yeah would be real cool to have random alternates. I don&rsquo;t know if i am able to do this with TypeTool? Might have to invest in Fontlab? Will read the article and look into it.</p>
<p>And next time round i will also play with the i dot options. I kinda don&rsquo;t mind the small dot but yes it is quite iconic to gill sans ultra and would be cool to see what other options i can come up with. Yes i see what you mean with the &rsquo;t'. And dingbats would be fun to make. Oh, and Jasper, that beautiful font in the recipe book is &lsquo;Ludwig&rsquo; by OurType.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Sorry to hear about your computer. I hope you do finish it - for one thing it would be great to see this mixed up with Gill Kayo for a form of &ldquo;emphasis&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But I do have a concern: exactly how is/was this derived from the original?</p>
