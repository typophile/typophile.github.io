<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>you should almost never use an existing typeface for a trademark. a trademark is created for use as a display and there for needs different attention then does a typeface. typefaces or "fonts" are meant to be read at small sizes in running copy and they are built for this need. when crafting a display face you should never use a typeface. not only for the reason above but also because you should be making a piece of ownable type for a client, something that is theirs and no one else's. if you use helvetica then the voice of the company is diminished by all five million other companies that use helvetica too. if i were a client i'd feel ripped off if some amateur designer sold me a typeface i could buy myself and use with out their help. i think we as graphic designers and typographers need to step up to the plate and start producing real work instead of ripping clients off.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I wouldn't say Jay's advice is extreme, perhaps utopian and quixotic, but not extreme. I think it is fair to say, however, that the average client can't afford a new typeface (font, set of letters). That is why as designers, in situations where the client can't afford a new set of letters, we must know the market and the competition and be able to do as Stephen suggested.</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>a typeface is a generic term encompassing all type. font is a family of one specific typeface. there are countless ways of classifying type. i prefer the vox method, but on a very broad level you can make the distinction between display face or text face. in the post i made earlier i suggested that a trademark should be created with the ideal of display in mind. this is not just a preference but a rule. i don't find this extreme in any way. creating original display type can be very easy. it's not at all a horrible task, for god sakes we are designers, we should enjoy this stuff. over all it's the distinction between text and display that is important. a text face is used for setting copy this is what they were built to do. in the days of metal type one face had many different cuts. it was different at 10pt then at 32pt. this is because as a type face gets larger and becomes a display it needs to become more robust in it's joins and horizontals. making it more of a display face then text face. the fact that the computer makes no compensation for this in a typeface as it gets larger is apparent in the fact that large computer type looks so bad. no one would dream of setting a book in a display face so why should one be as ridiculous to make a trademark out of a text face. yet this is done all the time because most designers are lazy or naive.</div>

<div class=commentbody>> it's the distinction between text and display that is important <br> <br>Indeed. And it's shocking how many highly-regarded designers don't get this duality. <br> <br>> as a type face gets larger and becomes a display it needs to become more robust in it's joins and horizontals <br> <br>Robust? In the meaning I associate with that term, I'd say the opposite. Display type [generally] requires finer detailing, higher contrast, even delicacy and elegance on occasion. <br> <br>Basically, the difference between the two modes of type is parallel to the duality in the reader*: conscious versus subconscious. Display type needs to appeal more to aesthetic preferences (which change all the time), while text face needs to appeal more to our reading "firmware" (which changes extremely slowly - in fact never over the [adult] life of an individual). Of course nothing exists in a pure state, so even text type needs to worry about looks, and display type about basic legibility. <br> <br>* And many other things, like the duality in the structure of the retina. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

I think what you saying is, text type need to accommodate things like ink spread, so details like ink traps at 'joins and such' have to be considered, am I right? Reading in the traditional sense is precisely as you put it - 'skimming over and formed together into concepts'. We don't read letter by letter but 'word-images'. We take jumps and periodically stop at points of fixation, picking up the meaning as we go along. <br> <br>So, in terms of features, text typefaces are less refined, because they are prone to unpredictable reproduction qualities. Besides, we don't really see the details very clearly unless we use a magnifying glass. Display type, on the other hand, have to be delicate and a lot more refined, because everything is exposed right in front of our eyes to see - there's nothing to hide. So display types are usually have higher contrast, thinner serifs, more refined features so we don't get this chunky slab serif when we blow it up. Think this way for a moment: reading text type is like looking at objects at a distance: they are less sharp and less defined. Display type, on the other hand, is like looking at objects right in front of us, so everything is sharper and more detailed.</div>

<div class=commentbody>keith, i agree in part, everything up to the thin serifs in display faces. i think that things need to get thicker and more slabish as they move into display. this is what is traditionally done for trademarks. as far as the more refined issue goes i agree they become more refined as they are simplified but also as more decorative elements are added<img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0></div>

<div class=commentbody>Jay, you know what? I think Hrant and I are talking about a different thing: display as in display type for books (serif, 48 to 72 point), not advertising. Yes, in trademarks and billboard kind of display work, the type does need to be robust, bold and sturdy. When we're looking at type that big then we're talking about the same issues as tiny type essentially! Lower contrast, thicker strokes, looser spacing... and the like.</div>

<div class=commentbody>> text type need to accommodate things like ink spread <br> <br>Traps are actually one of the secondary things that make a good text face - there are much more fundamental factors. <br> <br>I would even go as far as stating this paradox: <br>A real text font has to have a certain ugliness about it. <br>This is because of the optical and "reading firmware" issues. <br>Look at Tracy's stuff - he was da man. <br> <br>> i think that things need to get thicker and more slabish as they move into display. <br> <br>Well, in the display realm it's all about easthetics, so for example if a given identity is based on "slabbishness", you would put moderate slabs on the text cut (because of the need for moderation for readability) but indeed exagerate the slabs in the display. <br> <br>But all things being equal, the display cut generally needs to be less clunky. <br> <br>> in trademarks and billboard kind of display work, the type does need to be robust <br> <br>Because of technical/repro issues? Sure. But still less so than in a text font for use at like 9 point! <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I have read Young's book - in fact at this instant it's less than a meter to my left. <br> <br>I totally agree about the letterspacing part - just not the weight part. My quote-editing must've been misleading. (FYI, I use four dots to include the ommitted stuff, but three dots to skip over it.) <br> <br>BTW, I feel letterspacing needs to vary with any point size, not just above 18. <br>Below about 8 points for example most any font certainly benefits by being set looser. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Hmm... how about 200pt or above? Wide spacing is essential for type that are meant to be read from a distance, as in directional signage. A student was using my Arrival for her signage project. She decreased my default spacing and said the spacing was so wide that the words don't read as words. Well, apparently she was judging from the computer screen! Yes, spacing has to decrease for 'small' display type, but for extreme sizes the contrary is true.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yes, the real measure is subtended angle, not absolute point size. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>>you should almost never use an existing typeface for a trademark. <br> <br>Even though I am still a student (which equates to minimal experience) I find that this is pretty much true. Even though, as tiff said, it sometimes comes down to client budget and not being able to afford a custom face, I find it much more satisfying to draw custom lettering. At the moment I am essentially rebranding my mother's store and I couldn't really bring myself to use an "off the rack" typeface for her logo. Is it really that hard to make a few new letters? </div>
