  \u2014 everywhere you see, it is there; magazines, newspapers and books. It is everywhere.
  But the problem is single-users cannot purchase it for personal use. Why do they
  do that? Anyone else obsessed with Poynter?"

  body: "They do that because they can charge more for the fonts; they sell less copies
    that way, but it makes sense considering the paucity of the retail channel, not
    to mention its greater risk of piracy.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: I am still surprised how FontBureau has managed to keep this type, well, er,
    un-pirated. I mean, stuff like Photoshop comes out the next day. I guess we type-lovers
    are not big on stealing others' hard work. (So, can someone pirate me a Poynter?
    ... Just kidding FB.)
