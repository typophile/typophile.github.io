		<div class="commentbody">I dragged out my Specimen Book of Linotype Faces (aka Big Red) and took a look at the Electra specimens. Revealed there, in 8, 10, 11, 12, and 14 point. The ink spread is held to an absolute minimum to allow the clarity of the letterforms to show. These are much &quot;thinner&quot; that the printed specimens show in this thread. Also the baseline disturbance is more prominent in the smaller sizes and is progressively adjusted thoughout the range. The 14 point baselines are hardly disturbed. The hanging or jumping lowercase characters mentioned previously seem to have been brought in line. These are quite vivid in the 8 point though. I'm suspecting this was a means for creating a certain legibility to the smaller sizes? It is fairly characteristic of many of the Linotype text offerings.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant you write &quot;&gt; The classic standard for beauty    <BR>No such thing, my friend!&quot; <BR> <BR>Ok, it's neoclassical.

They are a way logic can critique intuition and spur more creativity.  <BR> <BR>When I read between the lines of Bringhurst, I have the feeling he thinks that a lot of the digital versions of the classics were done without enough care or thought (under commercial pressures?) and as a result are a comedown from the orginals.  <BR> <BR>The discussion of Electra here seems to confirm that, big time. <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Gerald, you undoubtedly have a more discriminating eye than I do  <BR>with regard to the quality of letterpress impression. And, unfortunately,  <BR>I don't have a copy of Big Red (yet). To be clear, however, I do not base  <BR>my judgement solely on the one example of the Mergenthaler booklet.  <BR>It is based on a number of encounters with both fine and trade editions  <BR>on various papers. I am not suggesting that digital Electra be made to  <BR>look like a poorly reproduced letterpress specimen. I just wish it retained  <BR>some of the substance and vigor of the original. <BR> <BR>Let me see if I can offer a counter example: <BR> <BR>I feel similarly about the digital version of Caledonia (at least Linotype  <BR>chose to call it &quot;New&quot; Caledonia). I feel that it is too light and contrasty  <BR>compared to the original metal Linotype, especially under modern  <BR>printing conditions. <BR> <BR>However, Matthew Carter created a digital version of Caledonia for  <BR><i>Time</i> magazine in 1993. Now this puts some of the ink back on  <BR>the bones and reinstills vigor in the face. It is no historic mimic of the  <BR>letterpress specimen; neither is it an anorexic specter. As could be  <BR>expected of Carter, he has done a thoroughly modern job, but with an  <BR>eye for the quality and spirit of the original design. He recently did the  <BR>same thing with Linotype Monticello for the Princeton University Press. <BR> <BR>I wish the same might be done with Electra. It would be a great service  <BR>to the book publishing field. <BR> <BR>&ndash; Kent. <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">William <BR> <BR>Well, let see it I have this right. I have a letterpress specimen produced by Linotype itself. Very well printed, with minimum impression on a fairly receptive stock, with just the right about of ink control given to it. Representative of what they would want the market to see. The 96 point they present would most likely have been photographically scaled from the 14pt and reproduced photomechanically. My scaling of the digital type to that size indicates a very near match with only the slightest variations built in to correspond to a new printing technology. <BR> <BR>So if I print the digital Electra with photopolymer plates I would expect a fairly accurate representation of the original, as a product of letterpress. <BR> <BR>If the letterpress process itself is really what is giving Electra its liveliness, then it really isn't a problem with the digital rendition as much as it is a preference for the way letterpress reveals the face. But, impression and ink gain will alter any typeface. <BR> <BR>I've printed with letterpress for near three decades now. I obviously prefer the printing process. But I also have a great deal of respect for the work being done with digital typefaces; the impetus &quot;to&quot; revive classical faces, the concerns for optimization and legibility. I don't believe the digital version is the travesty some of the folks here wish it were.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Gerald, yes it may be that the digital version of Electra, if printed by letter press - assuming your photopolymer plates have similar ink spread as metal did - would correct the problems of the digital version, and get a similar superb result. My point from the start was that the digital version should have taken into account that almost all the printing would be from computer to photo to offset press, and so should get the supurb result by the current common technology. However, if Kent Lew's observations are correct - and he seems to have made a deep study of the matter - the digitizer also made the font more uniform than Dwiggins had intended, and made other adjustments. If so, I suspect that the result will still be not as good, even though the problems with the weight, particularly of the thin strokes, will have been corrected by the printing process. <BR> <BR>I am not saying that letter press is inherently better, only that the change in technology sometimes wasn't taken into account properly in the digitizing of old typefaces. Now letter press can get 'sock', the slight embossing of the paper, which is nice. And you tell me, is there any difference in the density of the ink in letter press vs offset? To me these advantages may be real, but aren't that big. The main problem is suiting the font to the printing method.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I have to agree with Kent on this. Electra is not a soft round old-style typeface. It does sparkle more than does the average Garamond (given the same printing conditions).  <BR> <BR>The biggest problem comes with how the user &quot;sets&quot; the typeface, and second what printing conditions they will use. <BR> <BR>I truly think that Dwiggins would have whole-heartedly embraced the technologies of today.

		<div class="commentbody">William <BR> <BR>Well, I think the designers did suit the font to the printing method. If they would have emboldened it to create a faux letterpress look, would not that have been the wrong thing to do? Electra is a spindly face, it was as a metal face as well. It is just more revealed as such on digital printing devices. <BR> <BR>Problem with trying to replicate a metal face with inkspread <em>in sito</em> is that the gain is not uniform and also varies considerably based on presswork, substratum, printing press, etc. <BR> <BR>Yes there is significant difference in the inking of offset vs letterpress. Letterpress is a continual gain that must be monitored continually. Once the ink grows out beyond the letterform outline (not a significant factor in offset) it progressively gets worse as the ink is viscous and continues to draw. There is good letterpress and bad letterpress. But in any printing medium you would want the clarity of letterform to be revealed as the designer intended. In this case it would be as the revival designers intended, not Dwiggins.  <BR> <BR>Fournier said &quot;the letter should not be blamed for the fault of the ink.&quot; This in reference to the punchcutter versus the presswork of the printer. I'd suspect any type designer would like to see their creations presented in the best light, would they not?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Perhaps the best approach is to consider the 'spindliness' of the digital Electra independently of the metal version. I think we're too focused on whether the weight matches the letterpress, and not considering the more basic question: is the digital Electra <i>too</i> spindly to work as a text face in typical offset printing situations? Yes, I think it often is too spindly, especially on white or very light paper stocks. If the visual sense of a typeface is that it is being overwhelmed by the paper, then that typeface it too light to be used at that size on that stock. I've seen numerous books set in 11pt Electra that I would not want to read on account of the weakness of the type. This is irrelevant on the colour of the metal type, or the digital printed letterpress via polymer: this is something that can be judged soley with reference to the digital type as printed offset. Personally, if I intended to use Electra for anything printed offset, I would probably spend a couple of days beefing up the outlines in various ways. I wouldn't do this in reference to any letterpress printed specimen: I would do this in reference to what would read best at the type size I intended.</div>

It's Joanna 14 at two impression levels: the right side is 2 mils* deeper (the difference of one page added to the stack). You can see how much difference that makes in the letterform: the body on the left is not black enough, but the contour is great; on the right the thins and the serifs get chunky, and the cusp between the stem and the arch starts filling in (long live trapping). Conclusion: you need the impression depth on the left, but with more ink. But my hunch is that when you're in a hurry (saving money), you're more likely to just press it harder than regulate the ink. <BR> <BR>* A &quot;mil&quot; is 1/1000th of an inch. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>
