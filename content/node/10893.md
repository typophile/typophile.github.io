  body: 'I think there are actually three typefaces going on: the J&amp;CO is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/helvetica-inserat/helvetica-inserat/testdrive.html?s=J%26CO&amp;p=96">Helvetica
    Inserat</a>, the DENIM may be <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/univers/67-condensed-bold/testdrive.html?s=DENIM&amp;p=96">Univers
    67 Condensed Bold</a> or something similar, and the sideways type looks like <a
    href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/news-gothic/">News Gothic</a>.'

  body: oops. i didn&#39;t catch those R&#39;s on the right side. <BR>i was looking
    for a univers to match J&amp;CO, but  <BR>couldn&#39;t find one. i just assumed
    denim would  <BR>be helvetica as well. good show. but why  <BR>didn&#39;t inserat
    show up on my search @ myfonts?
