body: "I'm wondering if anyone has any insight about proper font licensing as it relates
  to cloud computing... Here's a brief explanation:\r\n\r\nI'm starting a business
  where we are creating custom journals (Bound Custom Journals - [[www.boundforanything.com]]).
  \ Some of the content that will go into a journal will be built on the fly on in
  an Amazon Web Services environment using ImageMagick.  Those pages - usually calendar
  pages which get generated based on the date range you choose - need to be able to
  access a font file in order to properly render out those files, which then get populated
  into a pdf and sent to the printer.\r\n\r\nMost font licenses allow for a user to
  install a font on up to 5 machines, however because we're using AWS, during high
  traffic, that font may appear on more than 5 virtualized machines.  During low traffic,
  it may not appear on any machines - the servers will be individually spun up and
  down based on demand (thus the beauty of cloud services).\r\n\r\nMy question is
  - Is a normal font license sufficient for this kind of use?  Would love to hear
  anyone's thoughts on this... \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nMichael"

    is far beyond the limits of a normal font license. Most font licenses explicitly
    cover a number of simultaneous users equal to the number of licenses you purchased.
    Additionally, What you are doing is effectively embedding the font into software,
    which is prohibited by most retail font licenses. You need to contact the font
    designers directly to negotiate a license compliant with your system."

  body: "I was afraid of that... \r\n\r\nThanks for the info.  I wonder if we just
    restrict it to one cloud instance (and up the power instead of upping the number
    of instances), if that would keep the cost down.\r\n\r\nAlso, (thinking aloud
    here)\r\nThe issue of embedding into software is a weird one... I'm not entirely
    convinced that's what we're doing.  I mean, it's no different than me using illustrator
    to create the final product, it's just a different tool using the font to create
    what is ultimately just a pdf to be printed....\r\n\r\n"

    a software product to allow users to create something. "

    that makes it available to an unlimited number of users over the internet is very
    different from installing it on a single workstation that is accessed locally
    by a single user."

  body: "None of our users will have access to the font file itself.  It is only used
    to build out files.\r\n\r\nLet me explain a bit more - \r\n\r\nWhen a user decides
    they want to get a calendar in our journal, they select for example a weekly calendar,
    and the date range.  When they order the journal, a script runs that builds out
    the custom preferences of that user.  All of our non-dynamic content (basically
    anything without a date attached to it) is pre-built pdfs that gets assembled
    into a 140pg pdf and sent to a printer.  Any dynamic content (weekly calendars,
    monthly calendars, daily) gets rendered on the fly based on the custom date range
    inputted by the user, using our QuickMagick script to place the right dates on
    each page.  The user never sees this happen, the font file is only referenced
    by the QuickMagick script, and the output is a pdf that gets printed.  \r\n\r\nThe
    salient point here is that there is no way / no URL to go to that would let you
    download the font file.  It only lives on the file system of the server, and would
    only be accessible through admin ssh."

    relevant is that your server allows users to select a font and design an object
    using that font. So you need to have a license for every one of those users."

  body: "The user does not get to choose.  The user doesn't get to specify anything
    about the design at all.\r\n\r\nThink of it this way - \r\n\r\nScenario 1 - User
    wants to order a journal, so user goes to a site where he/she can buy a journal
    that has a 2012 monthly calendar in it, followed by regular old lined pages for
    the rest of the journal.  Some designer has created that monthly calendar, using
    fonts that are licensed on their home computer, and converted that into a pdf
    and sent it to a printer to be printed and bound into a journal for the user.
    \ The user has 'selected' to buy this journal because it has the exact date range
    they want - Jan 1 - Dec 31 2012.\r\n\r\nScenario 2 - User wants to order a journal,
    so user goes to a site where he/she can buy a journal that has a monthly calendar
    in which they can decide to start on Feb. 2, 2012 and end on July 2, 2012, followed
    by regular old lined pages for the rest of the journal.  Some designer has created
    the template for that monthly calendar, and run a script on another independent
    computer (not connected to the internet) to populate the monthly calendar with
    the appropriate numbers and month names, using a font that is licensed for that
    second computer, per the specific instructions in the code as specified by the
    designer.  That was then converted into a pdf, sent to a printer and bound into
    a journal for the user.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the difference here?\r\n\r\n\r\nSidenote
    - The reason I'm arguing this is not because I think I'm right - only because
    I want to get it right.  I have a deep respect for type designers and am more
    than happy to adhere to the licensing rights, but at the same time, I also need
    to balance the costs of doing so."

  body: "Michael,\r\n\r\nThis is indeed a thorny issue. Probably the fairest way to
    price the license would be on a per-use basis. If a person chose to print a document
    in a particular font, the foundry would be paid a one-time fee for its one-time
    use. Unfortunately, AFIK, no one is set up to track and bill in such a manner.
    If some enterprising soul did develop such a system, it would be a win-win-win
    situation...IMHO."

    by initiating a dialog directly with a representative of the foundry (or foundries)
    whose types you are interested in licensing and discussing your needs personally
    and in specifics. That way you can get a clearly tailored response. This kind
    of thing is just not going to be covered by a generic EULA."
