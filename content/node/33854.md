  the same look and feel? Any alternatives besides Sudtipos fonts? Sudtipos fonts
  are great but we're looking for other alternatives. We can't use them for everything.

  body: It's hard to compete against the Sudtipos-magic of Sr. Paul. But if you want
    to go another way try Hubert Jochams <a href="http://www.hubertjocham.de/index.php/type/packaging/">Packaging</a>
    selection, especially <a href="http://www.hubertjocham.de/item.php/type/packaging/Schoko/">Schoko</a>.
