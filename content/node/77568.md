  \"B, A, and C\" overlap each other in addition to the yellow cross on the left.\r\nFor
  some reason this is the only picture available and it is already quite small.\r\nAny
  other appearance of this logo is just a poorly scaled version of this one.\r\nI'd
  like to use it in one of my current projects so any assistance would be appreciated.\r\nI
  apologize for any difficulty, and thank you for your time."
