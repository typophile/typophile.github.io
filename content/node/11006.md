  A little Book of Logos. 24 pages, 4x6 inches final size. It will be a mix or art/type

    you to rant.  <BR> <BR>After I posted I realized that perhaps I shouldn&#39;t
    have. Some people instantly equate price with quality. &#34;Honey, you gotta pay
    through the nose, otherwise you aren&#39;t getting quality work.&#34;  <BR> <BR>Well,
    hmmm. Is that what you were insinuating? I hope not. My fingers are crossed for
    you not to say something like that. I hope you tell me the opposite.  <BR> <BR>The
    press I used to do my invitations were very generous. I had lined up another printer
    only to have them cancel at the last minute. &#40;Which was good because they
    weren&#39;t going to be able to meet my deadline.&#41; The press I used saved
    by bacon and that of my clients as well. And I have a feeling they were also generous
    in their pricing. <BR> <BR>It was my first time to letter press anything, ever.
    I&#39;m willing to learn. LIfe is one big lesson, and I&#39;m a forever student.
    So, Gerald, educate me. I&#39;m listening. <BR> <BR>

  body: Tiffany <BR> <BR>I was way too flippant about this. The price you paid seems
    way low but perhaps not necessarily so. If a printer is set up for this kind of
    work and has the right presses for the job, and is doing significant volume where
    they can standardize it a bit, yes, the price could get fairly low I&#39;d suppose.
    I just don&#39;t see these kind of prices anywhere. I don&#39;t do wedding invites
    because I&#39;m not set up for it and could not be competitive &#40;like your
    friend, I just do fine press bookwork&#41;, but in the LA environs I&#39;m seeing
    obscene prices being charged for not much effort. A couple of the bigger boutique
    letterpress outfits who do cater almost exclusively to weddings have me make their
    plates for them. Their prices are easily ten times what you paid.  <BR> <BR>Obviously,
    high price does not necessarily equal high quality, in fact, it rarely seems to.
    On the other hand, I think you were given a gift &#40;?&#41;, and I wonder if
    this is their normal rate of charge. As Hrant suggested, I think also that the
    cost of plates would eat up a portion of the charge here. So your printer wasn&#39;t
    getting much for his effort.  <BR> <BR>But you never did say what they looked
    like. So I guess I should throw this back at you. Is cost more important than
    quality? And what is quality? Is letterpress a qualitative measure in and of itself?

    I missed the initial post to this thread!!! Based on my experience, I would say
    yes, letterpress is going to cost a lot more than offset. But there are levels
    of letterpress. If cost is the main fact and you just want that &#34;letterpress&#34;
    look, go to the cheapest printer you can find, he or she may be able to match
    the price of offset, but then, there are levels of offset &#40;cost/quality&#41;
    as well.

  body: The invitations were simple, not fancy, one color. Printed on Classic Columns
    Pistachio with a medium-dark grey ink. <BR> <BR><i>Is cost more important than
    quality?</i> <BR> <BR>No. I&#39;d say that, for me, I try not to separate the
    two. In general, I can tell what my clients want/need and base my press &#40;paper,
    ink, binding&#41; selection on these things. If they want it quick, but don&#39;t
    want to pay a lot or if they want it quick, but quality is important ... well,
    I have different presses for different jobs. There are presses that I won&#39;t
    use based on the fact that they can&#39;t cut straight and often forget to call
    for press checking, even though they can outbid everyone. And I also don&#39;t
    use presses just because they have Philipe Starck chairs in their front office.
    Quality, Price, Time -- all important.  <BR> <BR>In this instance, this wedding
    invitation, as it was for a friend I wanted it too look good &#40;quality&#41;.
    My friend had seen the letterpressed invitations while doing the rounds of wedding
    planning and saw how it added a little something special. So for her, quality
    meant letterpress. So I suggested letterpress. Now, it could be said that just
    because we printed letterpess doesn&#39;t mean the final project was of high quality.
    Letterpress doesn&#39;t necessarily equal high quality. Although I did use a pressman
    who does quality work. <BR> <BR>While your question is good, it&#39;s difficult
    to say without generalizing. Of course, I always want the final product to be
    quality and cost effective. I don&#39;t like the word &#34;cheap&#34;, but I&#39;ve
    been known to tell my rep that I need the paper to be &#34;inexpensive&#34;. Cheap
    connotes trash and polyester. I don&#39;t like to think I do trash. <BR> <BR>Perhaps
    quality is in the eye of the beholder. You have been known to say that you shouldn&#39;t
    slam the paper into the plate. But, for some the question is &#34;why do letterpress&#34;
    if you can&#39;t see it? To protect myself, we didn&#39;t do any slamming on these
    invitations, only mild tapping.  <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR><i> Is letterpress a qualitative measure in and
    of itself?</i> <BR> <BR>No. I don&#39;t think so. No amount of good inking and
    perfect padding can save a poor design. Or on the other hand, a good design can
    be made bad by poor press work. <BR> <BR><i>What is quality?</i> <BR> <BR>Quality
    is a combination of everything. But mostly, quality is in the eye of the beholder.  <BR>

  body: '&#62; &#34;why do letterpress&#34; if you can&#39;t see it? <BR> <BR>Because
    you can <i>feel</i> it. <BR>It&#39;s subtle, &#34;subvisible&#34;, the way you
    might not concsiously <BR>notice a perfume, but it will &#34;atmospherize&#34;
    you anyway. <BR> <BR>Hard to sell, things that you can&#39;t fondle, I know. In
    fact, some people seem to enjoy letterpress because they like the feel of a lump
    of metal in the hand. This is problematic, in a number of ways. For example, it&#39;s
    display-centric &#40;handling 9 point type is no fun compared to 60 point&#41;,
    and it has nothing to do &#40;except maybe metaphysically&#41; with the result,
    which is the only thing the <i>user</i> cares/needs_to_care about. <BR> <BR>One
    great thing about metal type though is it lets you physically appreciate why chirography
    is anti-typographic. Holding some large Palatino in my hand recently, I couldn&#39;t
    help but think &#34;this is not right&#34;. It&#39;s supposed to be engraved -
    even though the illusion of the result can be convincing. <BR> <BR>&#62; quality

  body: <i>Quality is in the eye of the beholder</i> <BR> <BR>Quality isn&#39;t just
    technical. That said, however, certain things I can&#39;t disagree with. For instance,
    is it in register? Is it trapped? Does the overprint line up? Is it cut straight?
    Are their typos? Did the type bitmap? Is the sky purple? Are buses orange? <BR>
    <BR>Certain things aren&#39;t in the eye of the beholder. I realized once I posted
    that this would come back to haunt me. Technical quality isn&#39;t in the eye
    of the beholder. I take that back. But I still think there is something to it.

    grade? I was thinking maybe an A&#43; &#40;for thinking about stuff!!!&#41;. <BR>
    <BR>I guess when I furtively responded I was thinking about quality without really
    getting in to it. But since quality is difficult to evaluate I&#39;d prefer to
    apply it to the work of persons who have a certain approach to their work which
    would include concern for appropriate materials, work attitude, experience, etc.
    To determine the quality herein, one, unfortunately, must share a lot of these
    characteristics. <BR> <BR>But when I said &#34;degrees of letterpress&#34; I was
    thinking of an easier way to define this. The degrees of letterpress are a combination
    of the above qualities of the printer as well as his or her equipment and technique.
    The latter is actually somewhat important in evaluating letterpress. They don&#39;t
    always follow but... <BR> <BR>At the high end, in cost/quality you would probably
    encounter folks using an iron hand press. These are less machine than tool and
    are quite labor intensive and require a great deal of skill, expertise and &#34;thinking.&#34;
    They also, for the most part, require dampened handmade paper. Most of the work
    here is fine book work. Not many of these folks around. <BR> <BR>A second step
    down, but not necessarily so, are folks working with hand-operated cylinder presses.   Dampened
    handmade paper is often used, and often not. Bookwork, broadsides, and the like
    but not so much jobwork, though occasionally. But you are somewhat dependent upon
    the operater here &#40;lot a variation in quality and professionalism&#41; and
    most folks running these kind of machines have rarely been trained in printing
    &#40;in the traditional technical school way&#41;. <BR> <BR>Interchangeable somewhat
    with the above are fully functioning commercial letterpress shops running big
    automatic cylinder presses. Handmade papers are generally not applicable here
    but these folks &#40;generally trained&#41; are capable of running any kind of
    work, relatively fast, relatively good, and relatively cheaper. Professional grade
    work most of the time. These kind of operations are quite rare though. <BR> <BR>Bottom
    dwellers: motor driven platen job press operations. Job work, cards, stationery,
    labels, die-cutting, stamping, etc. Rarely capable of decent book work. Should
    be quite inexpensive &#40;unless boutique&#41;, rarer to see good quality work,
    fast. <BR> <BR>Basically, operator somewhat aside, the more distancing the machine
    from the human hand, eye, and mind &#40;not to mention heart&#41;, the cheaper
    in cost and quality. But not always so!!! <BR> <BR>My five minute attempt here
    to put a bit of a different spin on this.'

    allows for sizing and leading doesn&#39;t necessarily lend itself to optimal reading

    metal type faces aren&#39;t actually that hard to set. Some folks prefer them.
    Its an experiencial thing. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not sure that wear or damage effects
    small type more. Hard to make that claim for foundry type, maybe for Monotype
    where the metal is softer and the smaller sizes might not hold well. <BR> <BR>Well,
    I always preferred the hunk of type, but like I said, some prefer the very tiny.
    I&#39;ve set as small as 4-pt. Setting Copperplate Gothic in the 6-pt with its
    four ranged sizes within that size is a pain. Without a loop, hard to know sometimes
    if you are setting the cap I, the exclamation mark, or the figure 1. Even the
    proof and the printing can be deceiving at that size. But Copperplate is a bit
    of an anomoly because of its size ranging. <BR> <BR>But I think the more experienced
    one is at hand setting the less size is any kind of a preferencial matter. Actually,
    very large sizes are even more of a pain in the butt.

  body: Ah, &#34;the potential for better results.&#34; There was the potential for
    better results with photofilm as well. Where you could stretch and crunch and
    whatever. Use negative leading, negative kerning, variation of point size, etc,
    all kinds of cool stuff. That turned out well for the &#34;reader.&#34; <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
    not, as you know, questioning what you have to say. But I think that much of the
    &#34;better&#34; of twentieth-century typesetting &#40;with metal, photofilm,
    digital&#41; would have been concerned with the needs of the reader. Limitations
    of technology and all. Digital is no magic pancea if the designer typesetter/designer
    doesn&#39;t share these concerns. <BR> <BR>
