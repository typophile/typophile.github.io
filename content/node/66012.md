  so I'd love to hear what you guys have to say about it.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Custom_6131.gif]

  body: "Great stuff. I prefer the first one mainly because it lacks the flourish
    on the b. Without it, the flourishes on the T and the h get a better chance to
    shine. \r\n\r\nI'm guessing this is probably done with strokes, but if you break
    it into shapes, refine it to be less monoweight, it would be even nicer."

  body: oh, and I recommend using the tittle from the bottom-most version. It relates
    more in scale to the loops found in the other letters of the word.

  body: "I think the bottom one is really very nice. Great work! I do agree with kosal
    that you should leave off the flourish on the b. It is extraneous and takes away
    from the lovely T and h. \r\n\r\nThe top two just don't have consistency with
    only some of the letters having the double lines and it looks unbalanced. Plus
    the dot over the i is just too big. If you did decide to go with one of the top
    two, in the very least I would suggest making the dot smaller. The great thing
    about the dot over the i in the bottom one is that it is nearly the same size
    as the small loops in the h & r (though the r looks slightly bigger) \u2013 if
    you did that on purpose it is very thoughtful. I would be curious to see the same
    small loop on the b, but it may be overkill.\r\n\r\nAll in all, you should be
    happy with it because it's quite nice and with some tweaking it will be very lovely."

  body: Thanks for your comments! Funny you should both mention the b... I started
    off with a non-flourished b, but somehow it seemed to lack something (see image
    below). I've made a couple of variations to try to give the whole thing a more
    balanced look[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Variations_4210.gif]

  body: torn between 2 and 5... agree with ratbaggy that the b flourish on 5 could
    sit higher. Very nice though!!!
