  was asking what this was on twitter and it got my interest - it's definitely hand-drawn
  but wondering if you lot could help ID something(s) similar.\r\n\r\nInteresting
  points about the capitals are the very sharp, slightly obtusely angled long serifs
  and the overshoot on the heel of the N. (Is heel the right word? Or is it it's knee?)\r\n\r\nFire

  body: "It's not easy to find a single font matching both lower and capitals...\r\n\r\nI
    think a good starting point for the lower can be \"ITC Caslon No.224 Black\":\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/n/itc_caslon_no_224_black\r\n\r\n...while
    a similar starting match for the capitals is \"Milano Roman\":\r\nhttp://www.fonts101.com/fonts/view/Uncategorized/51064/Milano_Roman.aspx\r\n\r\nThe
    serifs in Milano are of-course smaller and they don't cross the baseline but i
    think the overall resemblance is good.\r\n\r\nI'm not a font expert, I just found
    some similar fonts using our product [[http:/www.findmyfont.com|Find my Font]].\r\n\r\nFivos"
