body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Terminology]] : Flavor</strong>\r\n\r\nThere are two
  types, or <em>flavors</em>, of [[OpenType]] fonts (OTFs): PostScript flavored OTFs
  and TrueType flavored OTFs. Those with [[PostScript]] outlines are of the [[Compact
  Font Format]] (CFF) variety and are designated by the \".otf\" suffix. Technically,
  all Windows [[TrueType]] fonts can be considered OpenType fonts and are cross-platform
  and may be designated by either the \".ttf\" or \".otf\" suffix. TrueType flavored
  OTFs are thus backwards compatible on Windows operating systems as long as they
  are designated with the \".ttf\" suffix. However, TrueType fonts do not appear with
  the OpenType icon unless they are [[digital signature|digitally signed]] by the
  font foundry.\r\n\r\nsee also:\r\nhttp://www.adobe.com/type/browser/OTReadMe.html#Anchor-Flavors\r\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/OpenType/OTSpec/otff.htm\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/info/opentype-flavors-ps-tt/"
