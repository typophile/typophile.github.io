<p>The following text about FF Legato was written by its creator, [[Evert Bloemsma]] in <a href="http://typophile.com/files/ff%20-%20legato_about.pdf">this <cite>About FF Legato</cite> PDF file</a>.
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/legato110906pdh01_5788.gif]
Most [[sans serif|sanserifs]] have very basic geometric shapes (like [[Futura]]), even those built using classical proportions (like [[Gill Sans]]). But this is not the most satisfactory approach when trying to visually connect separate characters, which in turn usually leads to most long texts being set in serifed typefaces.</p>
<p>FF Legato abandons the idea of a sanserif consisting of simple rigid forms. The mirrored image below shows how (different from typefaces like Gill Sans and [[Syntax]]) movement and direction is expressed by outer- and inner-forms behaving relatively independent, and is maintained through all [[weight|weights]]. It makes characters refer to previous and next letters to build better words and lines.</p>
<p>Many sanserifs published these days combine a ‘pleasant’ appearance with a conventional construction. This is just what I wanted to avoid designing FF Legato. In discussions FF Legato has been compared with typefaces like [[Finnegan]] ([[Linotype]]) and [[Cronos]] ([[Adobe]]). [[Contrast]] of such faces is strong and along a single vertical [[axis]]; vertical bars are emphasized. This becomes clear when looking at a character like the lowercase ‘o’ at bolder weights. The construction establishes a strong rhythm but does not necessarily improve word images.</p>
<p>On the contrary; it optically splits up words into single letters with stems as independant elements, just as our alphabet already splits up terms in separate units on a ‘system-level’. Often the resulting austerity is then masked, for example by decorative details suggesting the touch of a brush or nib. Such typefaces will work fine for packaging etc. but their use for larger texts is questionable and they may not fit contemporary, transparent graphic design.</p>
<p>In [[1993]] my rather experimental [[FF Balance]] was published. It completely reverses the conventional contrast (‘incorrect contrast’); horizontal parts are thicker than vertical parts. The illustration below compares the sanserifs [[Univers]] (emphasizing vertical parts), FF Balance (emphasizing horizontal parts) and FF Legato (emphasizing diagonals from the upper left to the lower right). Each one of them builds a different rhythm, creates a different interaction between the characters; a different continuity.</p>
<p>FF Legato was recognized as one of its <a href="http://typographi.com/000969.php">Favorite Fonts of 2004</a> by the type blog, [[Typographica]].</p>
