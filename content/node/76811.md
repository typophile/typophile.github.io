  body: To move the command bar to the bottom of the Font window, click the little
    round button on top of the scroll bar. Change modes by clicking the appropriate
    button when the bar is on top, or using the pulldown menu when the bar is on the
    bottom.

  body: Thanks Justin, that's quite useful - Why can't it be like that when the command
    bar is at the top? just another quirk of FL I suppose. But it's still not there.
