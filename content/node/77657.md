body: "I am not a typographer. This is only one aspect of my job running a small 2
  person operation. Hence I lack a solid understanding of what is obviously a highly
  complex legal and moral set of issues. The original thread gave me lots to think
  about but I\u2019d like some advice if I may about a situation I find myself in.
  I\u2019m starting a new thread because the original is getting so long and my question,
  while building on the foundations discussed in that thread, heads off in a new direction.\r\n\r\nMy
  company is packaging a new literacy series. Ie hundreds of small books that teach
  children to read. Technically we are not the publisher. We are more or less managing
  the project on behalf of the publisher. We have a sample design using a font that
  we like but that is somewhat stylised and some of the glyphs are not ideal legibility
  wise. Specifically the \u201Cf\u201D and the quotation marks are not suitable. We
  spent massive amounts of time searching for the perfect font or even a reasonable
  compromise font. We could not find one. It would appear the major educational publishers
  have created their own for this purpose so we do not have access to them even if
  we believed they were the best option available. \r\n\r\nComing from a technical
  background and applying a technical perspective to the problem I thought no problem.
  I\u2019ll just modify the appropriate glyphs. I downloaded FontLab Studio, opened
  up the font made the changes and saved it. Seemed to work. While checking something
  in the manual it mentioned licensing. Hmm there was a new thought. Never occurred
  to me that I couldn\u2019t make derivative works. I thought that all I had to do
  was pay for the font and ensure everyone downstream did the same. So what could
  be the issue? I checked the license. They don\u2019t allow derivative works. Now
  this is where it gets messy for me. Many of the terms in the license are not defined
  and I am having problems drawing the line between a derivative work and an original
  work in the sense of glyphs outlines or shapes. \r\n\r\nIn an ideal world I\u2019d
  like to do just as I have done so far. License the font and make a few minor changes
  myself. I am unsure as to whether this transgresses the no derivative clause. What
  is the consensus on this one?\r\n\r\nAssuming that the answer is yes and it is not
  an option, lets examine this from the designer\u2019s perspective. At the moment
  she is laying out in InDesign. She has applied character styles to the problematic
  glyphs that stipulate the use of another font at that point. Hence the problem is
  sort of solved by mixing typefaces for the quotation mark issue. The \u201Cf\u201D
  is a problem not easily addressed in that way however. Assuming it could, the mixing
  of typefaces in the layout is a messy, error prone and time consuming business.
  I could make it easier for her by again opening up the font in FontLab Studio, replacing
  the problematic glyphs with different ones (all legally licensed) as appropriate
  and saving it as a modified font. Is that a derivative work? I am just taking licensed
  fonts and repackaging them for our convenience to achieve the same outcome as before.
  Everyone gets their money and we get a practical workflow. What is the group-think
  on that one?\r\n\r\nThe previous thread seemed to have rough consensus re the issue
  of the outlines not being copyright. Ie converting to outlines to get round these
  kind of issues was more or less \u2018valid\u2019. Certainly it is common practise.
  \r\n\r\nNow if I open up my \u2018licensed\u2019 font, the one I have paid money
  for when I pressed the \u201Cbuy\u201D button (saw that issue addressed some where
  in these forums too) and want to change one glyph, say back to the problem \u2018f\u2019.
  Now I\u2019m assuming that it is ok to mix and match fonts (or should I say gyphs?)
  that I have paid for given the end logic as above is that the end product (the printed
  page) is identical and everyone gets their money so what is the hurt?\r\n\r\nNow
  say I can\u2019t find a suitable replacement outline for the \u2018f\u2019 so I
  make my own. It has to sit style wise within the font design so I kind of emulate
  it (the style) by eyeballing it and I end up with something that I can live with.
  Is that now a derivative work? The glyph has not been copied and pasted but I have
  done my best to copy the style. That could a copyright violation. I really don\u2019t
  know. Is it? \r\n\r\nTo take this weird argument a step further: In the previous
  thread we seemed to agree that the outline was not copyrighted but in FontLab the
  glyph is just that. An outline! A shape defined by Bezier curves just as in Illustrator!
  Wasn't Illustrator an off shoot of Fontographer? Could I get round this situation
  by creating an outline of a font in Illustrator and cutting and pasting it into
  FontLab? Absurd argument I know. However it does, for me at least, point out how
  problematic the font licensing mess is. \r\n\r\nThe need for a lawyer to use a font
  is absurd. It is just all too hard. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m trying but so is this situation.\r\n\r\nI
  am really curious as to your opinions on this. Both from a practical point of view
  (I need to know what to do) and from a more academic or abstract perspective.\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks\r\n\r\nMark\r\n"

    fonts) are a rather complex piece of software. You cannot just open it, make some
    changes and save it again like you would do with a Word file. That's why FontLab
    Studio has no function to \"save\" the font file, but a \"generate font file\"
    function. A lot of things will happen when you generate a new file, based on many
    many checkboxes you need to set carefully in the FontLab preferences. That's the
    job of professional type designers. \r\n\r\n<cite>(I need to know what to do)
    </cite>\r\nIf you need a different version of a font you should simply contact
    the font foundry. They can create an individual version of the font for you and
    make sure that everything is technically correct. In the end this will probably
    be even cheaper than investing your time with something you don't know how to
    do and maybe ending up with a faulty font that causes problems in the print production.

  body: "Let me preface this by saying that I am not a lawyer:\r\n\r\nI would think
    that if you made a completely new f and quotation marks for a font you purchased,
    then re-exported it for your own use, you shouldn't have problems. Realistically
    by doing this, the only thing the type designer could reasonably accuse you of
    copying would be the kerning pairs for those specific characters because once
    you replace their f \u201C\u201D, fontlab is still going to apply all the kerning
    pairs that the designer had originally built into the file onto your new replacement
    glyphs. That would be the primary difference I would see between simply doing
    those replacements in illustrator/indesign, and making the edits more directly
    in fontlab (solely for your own use of course).\r\n\r\nHonestly, I've done this
    to font files in the past and hadn't even thought of it as being potentially problematic
    (probably the first thing I did once I started working in fontlab was to export
    a version of futura bold that didn't have a hideous c). I also wouldn't really
    see the difference between what you are suggesting, and modifying specific letters
    of a typeface as outlines to create specific effects/unique elements in an identity
    mark (something which is fairly common practice).\r\n\r\nIf you really want to
    get fancy and make sure you avoid any possible legal issue, you could always make
    your f and \u201C\u201D in a new file in fontlab, export a font, and do a simple
    find/replace on all f's and \u201C\u201D in your layout. If you did that, I honestly
    don't see how anyone could accuse you of doing anything illegal. Of course then
    you'd have to go through and do all the metrics for those glyphs...\r\n\r\nThe
    concept of derivative work as I see it (and as I would be concerned with it as
    a type designer) would apply more to the idea of directly modifying the curves
    of an existing font file in fontlab, then re-exporting/re-selling the file as
    your own (not modifying a font file by replacing specific characters for your
    individual use). The world is full of \"derivative\" type design, so as long as
    you are actually making the new glyphs and not selling the work, you shouldn't
    have issues. There is precedent for this:\r\n\r\nArial is most certainly \"derivative\"
    of Helvetica (I would call it a rip-off), and it is undoubtedly legal. With Arial,
    we're looking at a typeface which takes the character width, metrics, and basic
    structures of another font, and blatantly copies them. If that's acceptable practice,
    I would think redoing your f would certainly be ok. Realistically, the instance
    of Arial is far worse than what you are proposing, because in that case, the \"derivative\"
    work is now being licensed and sold, putting it in direct competition with the
    original.\r\n\r\nNow, if you were talking about modifying the f and \u201C\u201D
    in the file by dragging points around and moving curves, I would see you as falling
    a bit further into a nebulous grey area in which you would be opening yourself
    up for potential problems, since the starting point for your glyphs would directly
    be another person's work. Still though, designers do things like this all the
    time.\r\n\r\n\r\nHonestly though (since you admitted to not being a typographer),
    I would advise you to contact the designer/foundry, and see if you can get them
    to make a version of the typeface for you that suits your needs more completely.
    There is a lot of subtlety that goes into making type that you shouldn't expect
    to be able to get right the first time. The amount of time and specific knowledge
    that gets put into these things is considerable, and is not something I would
    expect you to be able to learn in a short amount of time to properly do this modification.
    Since you're here on a type design forum talking about this stuff and are even
    scrutinizing single glyphs within a typeface, I would say it's a safe assumption
    that you want this done right. If that's true (which I believe it is), get a type
    designer to do it. Type design is a craft based on a very refined and specific
    skill-set, like any other, and I would urge you to have these modifications done
    by someone who has the requisite knowledge to do them properly.\r\n\r\nBesides,
    as far as custom typefaces go, If all you need is something like modifying 3 glyphs,
    that shouldn't be really all that difficult to get them to do (assuming you're
    willing to pay them to do so)."
