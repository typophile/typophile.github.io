body: "Hello everybody,\r\n\r\nI'm finally about to retire my \u224810 years old Agfa
  F40 scanner (as I rather not resort to using Vuescan\u2014the only solution for
  this old scanner in OS X Lion).\r\n\r\nNow, what scanner should I get? I mainly
  scan black and white lettering drawings (both as grayscale and linear). My old scanner
  had some great optics but was big and heavy. Will I do fine with just a CanoScan
  LiDE 210? It's thin and light (just 1.6 kg/3.4 lbs) and is capable of scanning 4800x4800
  dpi. I must say I like the portability aspect of this scanner. However, it's using
  CIS rather than CCD, will this work just as fine? I've seen some examples of cheaper
  scanners producing reflections on the scanned image even though the scanned original
  was matte paper (the reflections were in some thicker paint parts). Also, from experience
  I know some cheaper scan software can sometimes be really slow when in lineart mode,
  but I don't know about Canon ScanGear\u2026\r\n[[http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/scanners/photo_scanners/canoscan_lide210]]\r\n\r\nIf
  you have any experience from this Canon scanner (and/or Canon ScanGear for lineart
  usage) or similar lighter scanners from Canon, Epson or any other manufacturer,
  please let me know. I'm open for other suggestions as well. :-) Basic question is:
  Is it possible to get such a light scanner without too much of a sacrifice upon
  quality?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

  body: "Indeed. My Duoscan F40 was their last prosumer scanner. Great optics, great
    r&d (glass free transparency bed), great build quality. But as they ceased support
    and development on drivers and software like ten years ago, it's been long overdue
    for a replacement. Besides, the CCD is just 1200x2400 dpi. Great back then, not
    so much today.\r\n\r\nYeah, at least according to Canon's spec sheet for CanoScan
    LiDE 210:\r\nOptical: 4800 dpi x 4800 dpi*\r\nInterpolated: 19,200 x 19,200 dpi\r\n*Optical
    resolution is a measure of maximum hardware sampling resolution, based on ISO
    14473 standard.\r\n\r\nSo that looks good. But I have no clue if it's speedy when
    scanning line art. Or if it fails in some other aspect. For instance, I heard
    that scanners using the more compact CIS (Contact Image Sensor) scanning element
    rather than the usual CCD can hardly be used when scanning any 3D object as it's
    focus range is more limited. Don't know if that still holds true."

    I've been looking at that one as well. It's not as slim and light as the Canon
    scanner. On the other hand it makes use of the traditional CCD scanning element
    rather than CIS. So perhaps it's worth it.\r\n\r\nHave you experienced any problem
    with reflections or inaccurate colors? My friend got an Epson V330 Photo (which
    I guess is more or less the same scanner but with a transparency bed as well).
    She has this problem I described before. There will sometimes show up reflections
    in the painted area (where there are thick paint strokes) on scanned art originals.
    Very disturbing and nothing she noticed while using other scanners."

    they sacrifice something more\r\nimportant. Anything over ~3000dpi is almost point-\r\nless
    because only natural objects have that level of\r\ndetail... and natural objects
    are rarely totally flat.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: VueScan is a great program that is constantly being upgraded - the ability
    to scan in RAW is something that is great for letterforms - I prefer VueScan to
    most scanner supplied sofeware. I think you should reconsider if your Agfa is
    still going strong.

    bojev\r\n\r\nRAW scanning sounds nice. That said, they really should hire a proper
    software GUI designer. Regarding my Agfa\u2026 firewire is mostly not supported
    anymore and the USB port is also a bit unreliable requiring system reboots from
    time to time. And\u2026 it's slow."
