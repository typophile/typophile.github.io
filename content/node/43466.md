body: "Hello everyone.  I'm still relatively new here so it feels a bit exploitative
  to request critique without providing any.  But if you're willing, I'd like to have
  your thoughts on the design of my resume.  I've changed most of the contact information
  because I'm not too hot on the idea of putting my phone number into the wild.\r\n\r\nI
  am interested in <em>any</em> form of comment, those regarding content, design,
  layout, font choice, etc. \r\n\r\nI guess I'd call myself a \"design hobbyist\".
  \ It interests me, and I've taken some classes on it in high school, but nothing
  since then. I have very thick skin though, so please, don't hold any criticism back!
  Thanks!"

  body: "It looks good to me. There are good white spaces and it is all in one single
    page. I don't dare to advice further. You could add professional and personal
    references from people who know you, as a short list as kind of referals, as a
    second page. I like the TT ligature.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nAndre"

  body: "Thanks Andre.  I'm a little ambivalent about the TT ligature---I kind of
    like the cleanliness, but I'm also worried that it calls too much attention to
    itself.\r\n\r\nI also wonder about my use of small caps.  The <em>look</em> I
    have right now is good, I think.  But I'm not sure the usage is entirely consistent:
    \"B.S.\" needs to be capitalized (though as I look at it now, should there be
    a space between the two letters) but GPA could be in small caps.  I tried that
    and it looked a bit weird so I left it with normal caps, is this acceptable?  The
    two-letter abbreviations for the states are in small caps, and I think that works.
    Thoughts?"

    to it. As I said, all looks great. The trick are the blanks. Good luck, and good
