body: "Short for [[Portable Document Format]], an [[Adobe Type|Adobe]] technology
  that allows people to share documents that preserve their original appearance, including
  embedding the specific fonts used in the document. PDFs can also contain interactive
  elements such as web and email links and form fields.\r\n\r\nThough other applications
  can create PDFs, the primary application for creating and modifying PDFs is [[Adobe
  Acrobat]]. Portable Document Format has gained in popularity and credibility as
  many professional printing houses request high resolution PDFs as the default format.\r\n\r\nSome
  type designers and type [[Foundry|foundries]] have reservations about the security
  PDFs as it is still possible for dedicated hackers to pull font [[Outlines|outlines]]
  from a PDF. For this reason some foundries' [[EULA|EULAs]] disallow embedding their
  fonts in PDFs."
