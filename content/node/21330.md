  Baskerville on the same page? The conventional wisdom, I think, is that Fry's Baskerville
  is a sharper face, more appropriate for display sizes. \r\n\r\nIt's also interesting
  that there was a time when one could reinterpret a face, and both give credit to
  the inpiration while still taking credit (or blame) for the changes. I wish I could
  do that with a few fonts. "

    Baskerville really has a lot more \"character\". That is, it has characteristics
    that one can easily argue againt, if your goal is, say, legibility or consistancy.
    I kind of like it though. I wonder what size the Bitstream version was taken from.
    Maybe it was inspired by one of the larger sizes. "

  body: "In response to speculation on the origin of Fry's Baskerville, here's an
    bit from <cite>An Atlas of Typeforms</cite> (James Sutton and Alan Bartram):\r\n\r\n\"Fry's
    Baskerville is much later in feeling than the original, and has more in common
    with Bell or Scotch Roman than with Baskerville. This \"improved\" version was
    cut by Isaac Moore for Dr. Fry in 1769, and reproduced by Stephenson and Blake
    in 1913.\""

    to the original.\r\n\r\nIf you try to use Fry's Baskerville at text sizes, you
    will not be happy. The hairlines are too thin to hold -- think Linotype Didot.
    Unreadable. It looks great at large sizes, especially if you tighten the letterspacing
    and tweak the kerning.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative to Baskerville for text, try Utopia.
    It looks really good in a range of sizes."

    is a sample of Berthold's \"BE\" version of Baskerville Adobe bundled in with
    some of their applications in the early 1990s. It has a more slab-serif feel to
    it. I think the bold weight is an attractive alternative to Clarendon."

    metal versions of Fry's (such as ATF's) had optical scaling,\r\nso they worked
    fine. But to me Fry's is in fact different enough\r\nthat it's a shame it's called
    Baskerville. You have to remember\r\nthough that it was a clone, intended to cannibalize
    on the sales\r\nof the original. Except both actually fared poorly on the market\r\nat
    the time! It was the French who ended up saving it.\r\n\r\nBTW, Berthold later
    replaced that cut of Baskerville\r\nwith a much better one, done by GGL. Many
    people\r\nthink it's the best (digital) version out there.\r\n\r\nLastly, don't
