  body: The e is very comaprible to what they did in the Heineken logo, but doesn't
    work this way. Secondly, helvetica is used so often it doesn't give any distinction
    to a logo, so I'd say use a more distinctive font. Have a look at the myfonts
    bestseller list. There's a lot of good relatively cheap fonts. http://new.myfonts.com/bestsellers/

  body: I agree with 1996type. The e is wrong... and the font you've used as the tagline
    looks stretched into place.

  body: "i think is the safest way possible, there's nothing to criticize about it
    beyond the \"e\" and the tagline, but its not really offensive ugly. \r\nI understand
    that building oneself's logo is the most difficult work one could ever have. (i
    havent done mine yet, because i never get to like something).\r\n\r\nTry risking
    for something more you. :) you will succeed"

  body: 'Why Helvetica? Why the tagline in a different sans-serif font? Why the tilted
    "e" ? It makes litle sense to me. Try with another sans serif (maybe futura),
    setting the tag line in the same font. The "+" could be used in the "e" as a graphic
    element. Anyway, good luck. '
