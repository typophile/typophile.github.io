  Bookman, or Bookman Old Style, begins with the introduction of a typeface named
  Old Style Antique by the [[Scottland|Scottish]] foundry [[Miller and Richard|Miller
  & Richard]], designed by [[A C Phemister|A.C. Phemister]] as a boldface pairing
  for that foundry's Oldstyle about 1858. The design became popular and was soon replicated
  by other foundries, with [[MacKellar Smiths and Jordan|MacKellar, Smiths & Jordan]]
  copying the design as early as 1869. When several smaller foundries combined to
  form [[American Type Founders]] in 1892, their libraries of typefaces had to be
  consolidated. ATF chose to issue the [[Bruce Type Foundry|Bruce Foundry]] version
  of Oldstyle Antique, which they had called Bartlett Oldstyle. ATF added some special
  [[swash|swash characters]] and [[logotype|logotypes]] and rechristed the new design
  as \"Bookman Oldstyle.\"\r\nBesides the special characters, there are other features
  of the font, which have endeared it to typographers since its inception. These features
  include Bookman's large x-height, short ascenders, moderate stroke contrast, heavy
  serifs, and he inclusion of a [[sloped roman]] as a part of the family instead of
  a true italic.\r\n There have been several reinterpretations of the Bookman model.
  [[Sol Hess]] cut a version called New Bookman. Various phototype versions of the
  font added more and more swash variants of characters. [[Jason Walcott]]'s Bookman
  is based on one of these phototype designs. [[Ed Benguiat]] redesigned the face,
  with the goal of making it more versitle for the [[International Typeface Corporation]].
  ITC's version differs from other versions particularly in the design of the italic,
  which is a true italic instead of the customary sloped roman usually provided with
  the Bookman typeface.\r\n\r\n<strong>Discussion:</strong>\r\n<a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/17453\">I
