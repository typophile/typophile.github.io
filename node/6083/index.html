I was inspired by Evert Bloemsma's Avance to build a font with severely asymmetrical serifs. In the spirit of not wandering aimlessly, my goal is to make a font with which I can set papers for my college courses.  <BR>  <BR>At the moment, I've completed the lower and upper case basic alphabet. I want to reorient myself now before I embark on the full character set. I have a few concerns:  <BR>  <BR>1 The character spacing seems wrong. Maybe it's too tight?  <BR>2 Some characters (<b>e</b>, <b>s</b>, etc&hellip;) seem too dark. Maybe this is caused by the spacing?  <BR>3 The character spacing for upper case only works when preceding lower case. Is it normal to have 26x26 kerning pairs to make all upper case text look alright?  <BR>4 Some of my glyph shapes (<b>d</b>, <b>g</b>, <b>k</b>, <b>q</b>) may be too crazy for a typeface intended for continuous text. Should I cave in an conventionalize them? (I refuse to budge on <b>Q</b>; the tail stays)  <BR>5 The bowls in <b>b</b>, <b>d</b>, <b>p</b>, and <b>q</b> may be too large.  <BR>6 My upper case forms are rough because I have less practice drawing them. Any ideas for improvement?  <BR>  <BR>I may be overlooking far larger problems here. If so, please set me straight! Assistance will save me trouble down the road and will be tremendously appreciated.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>The character spacing seems wrong. Maybe it's too tight?</i> <BR> <BR>I think it's just right.

		<div class="commentbody">Actually I think your spacing is in fact too tight overall. However: <BR>1. It seems that some areas (like the &quot;ven&quot; sequence) are fine, and in fact some are too loose - so it's still too uneven to tell. <BR>2. There's no easy way to be sure anyway without a physical printout in the intended medium  - probably through lino, right? <BR> <BR>The &quot;s&quot; is in fact too dark - because of its density it always has to be lighter than you think. <BR> <BR>&gt; Is it normal to have 26x26 kerning pairs to make all upper case text look alright? <BR> <BR>No, although I happen to think it's a great idea to use such an exhaustive matrix to loosen all-caps setting. <BR> <BR>Your &quot;bdpq&quot;&hellip; it depends who you ask: some designers will say they are &quot;wrong&quot;. But I think they're more than fine. In fact, I've only seen such a wonderful &quot;d&quot; structure one other place - in my Patria&hellip; :-&gt;  But be careful of getting too attached to individual glyphs: taming overly flamboyant characters can be very painful but is usually necessary. <BR> <BR>Your main problem right now is the &quot;g&quot; (by far the most difficult character in Latin). Don't let dogma ruin it for you. Some otherwise wonderful designs (like Matrix) really need a much smarter &quot;g&quot;. <BR> <BR>As for your uppercase forms, what I might advise is something I hinted at in the thread about Avance: go orthodox. Those puppies are really gloriously stiff - it's all they got - let them shine in their own way. <BR> <BR>BTW, your comma is amazing! But do make its tail longer. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I've been trying to figure out what I like so much about this  <BR>face. I've decided it's the clunkiness of the serifs combined  <BR>with the overall inconsistency. It's really alive. I've long <BR>loved the clunkyness of slab serifs, but most are a little too  <BR>mechanical for my liking&ndash; too perfect. This has more   <BR>vitality. <BR> <BR>I think it looks great in the setting. I would polish a few   <BR>characters, but nothing to change the overall feel. And   <BR>don't even think about taming the k. If you really want to   <BR>make a font to set a book in, start over. If you want a really   <BR>funky cool something for small blocks of copy, you're right  <BR>on. <BR> <BR>A few suggestions: The spur on the d and the q have got to <BR>go. They are awkward, and don't fit the other characters.   <BR>They imply a line that doesn't line up with anything else.   <BR>The d could take a cue from the a. I would work on the   <BR>terminals on the S, the j and the y. The terminals on the C   <BR>and the G are also a little awkward. The G feels a little   <BR>heavy. <BR> <BR>Don't polish too much though. It would be a shame to loose <BR>the rough, chunky feel that makes this face so cool.</div>

I dug this heap out of the garage a couple weeks ago and gave it some good polish. But I've learned lots and developed a certain taste since I worked on the poor thing last so a good polish turned into an overhaul. So I present the new Sonoma: <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.xtypa.com/ext/sonoma/sonomaspec.gif"> Um, Click Here</a> (cause image uploading is broken) <BR> <BR>There is a pdf version of this specimen <a href="http://www.xtypa.com/files/sonomascintillatingspecimen.pdf">over here</a> and if you'd like so see a pdf of the same specimen layout as the old Sonoma but with the updated design, take a look <a href="http://www.xtypa.com/files/sonomaharoldbloom.pdf">over there</a>. Let me know what you think. I like how things are going so far, but I'd like to hear if this looks like a design that people would want to actually use for, you know, a real project. <BR> <BR>If you're interested in knowing more about this update, there's a bit more detail over on my <a href="http://www.xtypa.com/">type design work blog</a></div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; you kinda can do this now with stylistic sets. <BR> <BR>Hot damn. This opens up all sorts of chances to try new things. It seems like I always pull ideas that might impress 5% of people with the idea of pleasing 80%. Now I have a way to still get to those 5%. <BR> <BR>&gt; Don't forget the original design. <BR> <BR>Well I'm not planning on finishing it any time soon. Maybe later. I have too many other type projects that I'm more interested in. <BR> <BR>&gt; Small caps? Bold? Black? More samples to see? <BR> <BR>How about some old style figures? This new design is still young and my free time these days is small it'll be a while before I have bold and black versions. <BR> <BR><a href="http://xtypa.com/ext/sonoma/sonomafigures.gif">GIF Sample of 1234567890</a> <BR><a href="http://xtypa.com/ext/sonoma/sonomafigures.pdf">PDF Sample of the figures alone and with text</a> <BR> <BR>(I still can't get image uploading working.

		<div class="commentbody">Yeah! Booo to stressless zeroes, at least in this design. The logic of the shapes just doesn't want it. <BR> <BR>I do have a specific question.

		<div class="commentbody">I think of the stressless 0 as being a Gill-y feature, but that's based on gut feel rather than actual knowledge, so I'm probably out to lunch. If you're not going to use that, then I think you ought to make the 0 more ovoid. It really strongly resembles an oversized 'o' right now. <BR> <BR>I don't think the numerals are too wide. I guess I am kind of curious why the 1's serif structure is different from the letters', though. <BR> <BR>&quot;Bitey&quot; means the way the two serifs close in on the middle of the 3 makes it look like it's biting itself. It's too closed in, I would say.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree that the figures are wide, and sometimes I think they look too big. <BR> <BR>One way of solving it is by making the shorter. And smaller, in consequence. This typeface is narrow, so I guess it is appropriate to have narrow figures. <BR> <BR>In general, I think that typefaces with low x-height are the ones that benefit more from having this kind of &quot;floating&quot; oldstyle figures (figures taller/higher than the x-height). But this is a typeface with a generous x-height, so I think the figures should be closer to the x-height. (But don't align them with the x-height! :-)</div>
