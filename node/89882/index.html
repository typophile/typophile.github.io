  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>For my senior thesis at my school, I&rsquo;m looking to create a new logo and tagline. I&rsquo;m a communication studies major and my study deals a lot with the perception and understanding of messages, especially when it comes to typography and design.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very new to the whole process on fonts and what not. I stumbled across this community of typography fans, and was curious if you have any tips (any sort of tips, really).</p>
<p>In the realm of higher education, how important is the font? What are some requirements of representing colleges and universities through various font families?</p>
<p>[disclaimer: I go to The College of Wooster in Ohio]</p>
<p>Thank you for your time!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Of course. I was hoping this would allow me to sort of talk things out and make sure I have a sense of direction on where to go.</p>
<p>A better way to put this might be, &ldquo;how useful is typography in conveying atmosphere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>My school is a unique place. Every college is. But the way in which it is represented graphically is not unique. Look at Denison, to which Wooster is often compared to. Very similar styling. Our website (<a href="http://www.wooster.edu">www.wooster.edu</a>) prominently features our wordmark proudly in Palatino  (slightly modified). Palatino, in my opinion, is in no way a unique family and doesn&rsquo;t quite do our school justice. When I look at Rhodes College and their wordmark for example, I see character. I get an understanding of the feel of the place (somewhat). I&rsquo;m looking to find a way to convey that about my school.</p>
<p>The focus groups I&rsquo;m currently holding are looking to find the root of the identity of Wooster. The values of which I&rsquo;m finding is that Wooster is quirky, fun, and a place where creativity flows unaltered.</p>
<p>Above all I&rsquo;m curious about meaning behind typefaces. They fascinate me in regards to how we understand brands, like colleges.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a good first step. Research is an important element of identity design.</p>
<p>You also might want to see if any university officials would be willing to give you their views about the university&rsquo;s identity. Heck, call the president&rsquo;s office and ask if he&rsquo;d be willing to give you 10 minutes. He might just surprise you and say yes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also suggest compiling a collection of current logos &amp; tag lines from other universities, both for inspiration and also to avoid accidentally coming up with one that&rsquo;s too similar to an existing logo. You&rsquo;ll especially want to know what logos are being used by universities that the administration views as &ldquo;the competition&rdquo;.</p>

critically important. And fonts -being systems of shapes-
certainly do convey moods.</p>
<p>The main question is: what atmosphere do you want to project?</p>
