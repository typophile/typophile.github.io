body: "I have been using the Unifraktur Maguntia font in Microsoft Word, and had this
  idea to use a macro to automatically insert ligatures and special characters such
  as the long s.  Does anyone know if this has been done before and if there is already
  such a tool in existence?  David Manthey used the same idea on his 18th century
  Caslon font:\r\nhttp://www.orbitals.com/self/ligature/ligature.htm\r\n\r\nOne of
  the nice things about Unifraktur Maguntia is that it includes all the necessary
  ligatures and historic characters.  Here is some more information:\r\nhttp://unifraktur.sourceforge.net/maguntia.html"

  body: "Since said macro would be nothing more than a long sequence of search and
    replace actions, why not just record it yourself?\r\n\r\nA much better solution
    would be to use an app that understands OpenType, so that it can do it for you
    automagically. I hear that InDesign and current versions  of Word have the necessary
    smarts, and I know that XeTeX does, so you have options."

    OpenType ligatures. The usage of \u017F can\u2019t be automated (at least in German)
    because the rules are too complex."

  body: That must be the problem then; I was using the 2007 version.  Using a different
    app that supports OpenType would help a lot, even if I would still have to manually
    change some things.
