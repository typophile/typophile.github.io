  designed as a helvetica sized replacement with characters based on a monotype font...\r\n\r\nthat
  data is what i need to search...\r\n\r\nwhat i'm trying to do is look for a font

    to fit the metrics of another one. Arial was specially designed for that purpose,
    but I doubt any others were. '

  body: "It's technically possible to write a program to scan all of your own fonts
    and somehow determine a \"best fit\". There is no guarantee <em>anyone</em> ever
    copied Clarendon's metrics, so it's possible the best fit, when only regarding
    metrics, is (uh), let's say \"Comic Sans\". To name a perfectly random font of
    which I'm pretty sure you <em>won't</em> say \"oh that would be close enough\".\r\n\r\nHow
    would this best fit algorithm need to work? Mathematically closest for the average
    character width, or the entire font (so some chracters would be wide off and other
    would come close), or for a select set of characters?\r\n\r\nIn any case, since
    font metrics per character are not publicly available, such a piece of software
    would only work on the fonts that you already have.\r\n\r\nIf exact looks are
    more important to exact metrics, you could try Fivos Vilanakis' \"Find my Font\":

    to identify fonts in images</a>."

  body: I think one could use <code>ttx</code> to extract the metrics for comparison,
    but the final cut is best done by eye.
