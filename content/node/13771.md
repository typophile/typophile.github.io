  wiki entry is not about the blog software <a href=\"http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/\">Movable
  Type</a></em>.\r\n\r\n[[Typography]] refers to the practice of producing texts from
  a standard, mechanical system. Before the late 20th Century, typopgraphy had been
  made by physically piecing together bits of pre-made letters, which were usually
  blocks of wood or metal that could be printed. These things are called <em>Movable
  Type</em>, as they were literal pieces of type that could be moved.\r\n\r\nWhile
  [[Johann Gutenberg]] normally gets the credit in the West for having invented movable
  type, he was not the first to reach such an invention (although most likely that
  he still reached his invention without any knowledge of earlier and/or foreign methods).
  What are some \"pre-modern\" examples of movable type? Well, it is rather certain
  that Koreans were printing books with movable metal letters during the 1100s. The
  Chinese had most likely been doing the same with blocks of wood or ivory before
  them. \r\n\r\nAlso during the 1100s, at least one Bavarian monastary was making
  monumental lettering by pressing stock, premade letters into a clay surface (the
  same \"stamp-letter\" were clearly used throuoght the piece, but since only the
  letter impressions remain in situ, we do not know what the letter stamps themselves
  looked like). Don't believe this crazy Bavarian story? Here is a link (in German):
  <a href=\"p://www.typeforum.de/news_308.htm\">typeforum.de/news_308.htm</a>.\r\n\r\nGutenberg
  invented a system by which small pieces of lead type could be manuafactured, and
  then succesfully made the first latin font acceptable to readers as type. Later
  that century, harder punches (which Gutenberg had none of), and hand held type molds
  (most likely invented in France or the low countries), allowed the technology to
  spread and flourish. Because all subsequent type-producing systems are based off
  of this system--including mechanical alternatives like the [[Linotype Machine]]
  or the [[Monotype Machine]]--Gutenberg's method could be called the beginning of
  \"modern\" movable type.\r\n\r\nAn example of non-modern movable type is [[Letterpress]]
  printing from polymer plates. Polymer plates have an impression on them that comes
  from photofraphic or digital output. The plates do not move (they are one whole
  element), but they are still type, as they can have lots of digital type outputted
  onto them.\r\n\r\nWhether photo- or digital fonts can really be called movable type
  is another question all together. There are certainly still individuals who print
  from movable type (contemporary letterpress users, for instance). But if the above-mentioned
  technologies do not fall under the range of movable type, then it might be said
  that its days have come to an end.\r\n\r\n<em>(These opinions really just form a
  stub post. Please feel free to edit or delete any of them, including this notice
