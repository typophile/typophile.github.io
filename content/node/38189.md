  body: "Hi Tom\r\n\r\nIf you highlight the text with the type tool in Illustrator
    and then paste it into InDesign using the type tool it will remain as text.\r\n\r\nYou
    will loose all text formatting applied in Illustrator, however if you set up a
    character style in InDesign with the formatting that you want and select it before
    you paste, the pasted text will appear in that style. Alternatively paste the
    text and then apply the style.\r\n\r\nHope this helps"

  body: "I was trying to do the same thing yesterday. I was quite surprised that you
    can't just drag and drop, as both are Adobe programs.\r\n\r\nIt would be quite
    handy if one could drag and drop a few differently styled text blacks from Ai
    to Id without the need for reformatting wouldn't it? - huh Adobe?\r\n\r\nBoth
    are very advanced programs, but I would have thought that this is rather a basic
    function.\r\n\r\nCan this be implemented in the next CS? Please?\r\n\r\n\r\nNick

  body: huh. that's odd. i wonder why it would lose text formatting en route from
    AI to INDD, but not AI to PSD.

  body: The reason that it works well between AI & PS, but not ID is that Illustrator
    & Photoshop share the same underlying text engine. InDesign has its own, which
    was tuned for much longer documents and more complex text flows.
