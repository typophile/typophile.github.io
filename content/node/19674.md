  question, so don't laugh...or do. I didn't want the first time i ever posted to
  be about Arial of all things, but what can you do? \r\n\r\nWe have a client that
  needs Arial in semi-bold form, but from what i (think) i know, Arial Semi-Bold doesn't
  exist. You can almost mimic what it would look like by applying a faux bold to the
  regular font, but that's not going to help the client.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\nThank
  \ you so much in advance and i apologize if this is such a ridiculous post,\r\n\r\nOlivia"

    the world, Arial and Times New Roman?\r\n\r\nIf the latter is the case, then you
    can safely give him a semibold version of Helvetica or Helvetica Neue (or perhaps
    even another more attractive sans).\r\n\r\nBut you are right, there is no Arial
    semi-bold that I know of."

      I wish that wasn't the case.\r\n\r\nI was thinking it could be redrawn, but
      that is my only thought.\r\n\r\nThanks Don!"

  body: Also on Windows the fake bold adds a single pixel to the regular weight -
    might look like a semibold on screen (at certain sizes) but won't help you in
    print at 600dpi and up probably (unless the printer driver is really clever)
