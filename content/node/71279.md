  an architecture graduate. So far, I haven't encountered that many individual architecture
  portfolios online, so I decided to seek for some feedback and some info on it here.\r\n\r\nWhat
  I'm working on at the moment is the type for her full name. I need something that
  would look good both in print and screen.\r\n\r\nThe aspects I doubt about are the
  width of the type and the unusual \"R\" I've used (if the curve looks good or I
  don't need it at all?). I haven't dealt with the kerning on the bolder versions
  yet tho. \r\n\r\nAs you can see, it doesn't really resemble architecture itself.
  Is it a mistake?\r\n\r\nYou can consider me as an amateur in this field of typography,
  so maybe I'm over thinking this whole thing and should stick with something clear/simple?\r\n\r\nLooking
  forward to your opinions."

    concentric?

    of the letters. Either make it obviously smaller, or leave it the same size. If
    you haven't, the \"O\" needs to be adjusted. The curve of the \"R\" is definitely
    bad, needs a bit of work... it doesn't look natural at all.\r\n\r\nWhat is that
    diagonal line on there for?"

  body: "@Steven Acres\r\n\r\nNow that I look at it, the \"O\" does seem a bit too
    small, thanks for correcting. I've increased the size of it and slightly changed
    the curve as well. I think it does look a bit more natural now.\r\n\r\nAnd yeas,
    the line... I was just testing how the type blends with geometric objects (the
    basis of my web design) and just left it there when saving the image.\r\n\r\n@ill
    sans\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if that's what you meant, but I have tried making the
    curve matching the degree of the \"O\" and it turned out pretty appealing\r\n\r\nfixed

  body: I would smooth the curve of the R's tail and make it ends as if the diagonal
    of the Z is a continuation of it.

  body: "In the first of your fixed ones, the R has fallen below the baseline, and
    the curve is still off, it doesn't make any sense. The second is better, but to
    my eye the R looks like a P that's about to topple over towards the O, with a
    tail hanging on it in a rather unconnected way. I would curve the tail up a bit
    towards the Z as Riccardo suggests, and maybe make it connect to the bowl of the
    R slightly further to the right. I've made a very crude example of what I mean
    in Paint, I've tried to make the curve of the R be concentric with the O, look
    like it continues to the Z (I didn't succeed with that one very well), but also
    made it cross the baseline more or less at the furthest point of the bowl of the
    R (blue lines), where it would naturally stop if the R was just a letter with
    no continuing curve.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/inga_6168_6111.jpg]\r\n\r\nJust
    a suggestion from a non-designer who likes to look at things."

  body: "That's what I had in mind! ;-)\r\nGetting the tail of the R to look like
    a continuation of the diagonal of the Z would require a wider Z (to get a less
    steep diagonal) or discontinuing the concentrism with the O at some point...\r\nWhat
    I would at least try is to make the Z & A parallel as well since you seem to be
    aiming for a very clean geometric look with this logo."
