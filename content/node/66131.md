body: "Hi there, this is a (bad quality) reproduction of an old tax announcement I
  have found in a hotel hall the other day, in Brescia, Italy (pics taken with the
  mobile phone camera). It was printed in Verona in 1817; what stroke me at first
  was the fact that it seems to be set in Walbaum, a German typeface produced in the
  early years of XIX century, instead of, say, Bodoni, which should have been a more
  natural choice. But in 1817 Verona was under the government of the Austrian empire,
  so it seems likely that Walbaum punches have reached the \"royal\" typography which
  printed the announcement.\r\n\r\nHere are the two pics I took and some enlargements:\r\n\r\n"

  body: Interesting! Did Walbaums have "French"-style ascending 3s? Current digital
    Walbaums with old-style figures have the usual descending 3s according to a quick
    glance over at MyFonts.
