  body: "I am sorry to disappoint you, this isn't a readily available font but the
    work of an illustrator.\r\nBut why don't you take this sample to your tattoo artist
    (if that's what you are after) and get him to draw\r\nsomething in this style?\r\n\r\nAs
    for the font the artist might have started with, you could have a look at Edwardian
    Script or other formal script typefaces."
