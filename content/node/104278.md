  If you know of any resources that feature Palatino, or have some of your own, I'd
  be very appreciative if you'd be willing to post those here to help me collect a
  number of examples. Outside of specimen sheets it can really be anything - signage,
  posters, book text, on-screen use, etc. \r\n\r\nThanks for your help!"

  body: That is a great site, Joshua. Besides the wonderful work you have done, it
    shows how beautiful the original metal Palatino was.

    one seems pretty close http://www.fontspring.com/fonts/softmaker/marathon-serial
    but does not have italics.\r\nAn older digital version also exist, floating around
    the web, called Pallazo Original that includes italics (both a narrow one and
    a wider one) as well as Small Caps and Old Style Figures."

    the two-color jacket is strong; the combination of Palatino and Syntax seems exactly
    right for the topic and the format; and the page size is very pleasant in the
    hand. (kf) I feel the type ornament is too dominant (perhaps it would have been
    more effective screened back), but the use of Palatino and its accompanying Greek
    font is to be applauded. (cz)"
