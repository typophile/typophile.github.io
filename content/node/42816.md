    is similar... at least, it feels similar. The Hard points remind me of Bureau
    Eagle Bold (http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/eagle/bold/), but it's not
    that clunky. The "E" just gives me a headache. Ick.

  body: Yeah, Eagle Bold is about the closest I've come. After doing a little research
    I also found <a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?5KT">Kobalt Bold</a>, and
    <a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?6A1">Bovine</a>. Gill Sans Extra Bold
    is the first thing I thought of, too, although the "m" and "n" feel more like
    Eagle.
