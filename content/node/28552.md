  to be a Postscript format, and the fonts which are supposedly in this format works
  on a PC, but not a Mac ... \r\n\r\nVery intriguing, and very annoying."

    Adobe, I would have by now. I think that maybe PSM is based on a mis-hearing of
    PFM which is part of a \"PostScript\" (i.e. Type 1) font on Windows.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"
