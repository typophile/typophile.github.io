  body: I&#39;m not sure I quite get the ball on the lowercase y. <BR> <BR>The italic
    seems based on a historically earlier form than the roman.

  body: yah the lowercase &#34;y&#34; is different... it reminds me of something...
    i will have to figure it out. <BR> <BR>it creates quite a bit of white space between
    the previous letterform <BR> <BR>p.s. my original post was under another typophile
    username... oops.  maybe i have two. <BR> <BR>p.s.s. my wifes maiden-name is christensen...

  body: The lowercase &#34;y&#34; might remind you of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/sabon/roman/mac-t1/164410/character/0079/CP4/1/"
    target="_blank"> Sabon</a>. <BR> <BR>I really like it, very nice design by MC
    as always. Looks a bit like  <BR>a synthesis of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-galliard/"
    target="_blank"> ITC Gaillard</a> and the Granjon models ITC Gaillard  <BR>was
    inspired by. I&#39;m quite fond of what he did with the cap A.

  body: '<i>&#62; The italic seems based on a historically earlier form  <BR>than
    the roman.</i> <BR> <BR>I think I see what you mean now: the Bembo influence shines  <BR>through
    a lot more distinctively in the italic than in the roman,  <BR>which looks more
    like a Granjon-type as I mentionned earlier. <BR>That&#39;s why the cap A struck
    me: it&#39;s the glyph in the roman that  <BR>looks the most &#34;Bembo-esque&#34;.'

  body: Yves <BR>Yes, that&#39;s exactly what I meant. I should say I was expressing
    just a general first impression rather than a considered judgment, but the italics
    reminded me of Bembo whereas the roman seemed later &#40;although I hadn&#39;t
    gone as far as you and observed the Granjon influence--probably because I haven&#39;t
    worked much with Granjon&#41;.

  body: Wow, what a great project. Now <i>there&#39;s</i> a great way to make an average
    person&#42; more aware that type is something special, unique, and functional
    beyond just making words. It even explains the uses for the different faces, en
    and em dashes, <i>and</i> it&#39;s free. <BR> <BR>Hats off to Yale &#40;and Carter,
    of course&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#42;as much as the students and faculty of Yale are
    &#39;an average person&#39;...

  body: '&#40;Hi Josh!&#41; <BR> <BR>Wow, what a really really good idea! Even though
    it won&#39;t take long for this to leak to non-Yalers, the idea of a free font
    formally restricted to a select group is really wonderful. As for the font itself,
    I don&#39;t <i>love</i> it, but I like it a lot, and really appreciate some of
    the playfulness, even though I&#39;m sure readability hasn&#39;t been compromised.
    My favorite part? The subtle -and intelligently chosen- variations. Very contemporary
    on that front. <BR> <BR>And yes, the presentation is awesome too. <BR>I hope more
    institutions go this way. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    yale students. <BR> <BR>i am an art center student and setting my essay papers
    in cholla slab&#40;was commissioned for art center&#41; would be scary.  i guess
    i should have went to yale <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: I haven&#39;t been to the new location yet, but the fact that it used to be
    an actual windtunnel is a big draw for me - very &#34;atmospheric&#34;, so to
    speak. Design to flow with the elements. I once had this idea for a dance club
    - it would be in a huge on-its-side cylinder with a gentle breeze blowing from
    one end to the other, and various fragrances released into the air, shifting with
    the music - <i>that&#39;s</i> multimedia, baby. It would be in some Eastern European
    capital &#40;maybe Bratislava&#41;, and be called Apparatus. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>
