  parts of the text are in Russian, so i purchased the cyrillic version of the font
  (Cyrillic, Postscript). The cyrillic glyphs do not appear in inDesign when i apply
  the font to the Russian text. I tried to go through TextEdit - it does not work.
  Please do not tell me that i will have to replace every cyrillic glyph via glyphs
  palette! "

    an OpenType Pro version of the font that includes Cyrillic, not a PostScript font
    which doesn''t support Unicode. '

  body: Hi Ralf, thanx for your reply. FontFont sells Quadraat in either PostScript
    or TrueType (Win) format. I ve got PostScript cause I am working on a mac. The
    characters do not map my keybord, even if I switch to Russian in International
    Settings. Why a cyrillic version of the font is practically of no use?

  body: "It would be helpful to know the exact version numbers of Mac OS X and InDesign
    that you are using, and also the file modification date of the FF Quadraat files.
    How does your text get into InDesign? Do you copy it, and if so from what source
    (e.g. Word Document, plain text file ...)\r\n\r\nIt should work, I tried it and
    can type with FF Quadraat Cyrillic in InDesign using the Russian keyboard layout,
    and apply the font to Russian text that I copy from the web.\r\n\r\nBy the way,
    TrueType fonts are also OpenType fonts, and not restricted to Windows. You can
    use them on any recent Mac OS as well."
