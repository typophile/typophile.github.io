  is easier to read than white on black. I think there is certainly less dazzle, and
  lately I have been seen this colour combo quite frequently recently.\r\n\r\nIs there
  any research on what colour combinations help or hinder legibility?\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I think you need to know the source of the idea that white on dark gray is
    easier to read than black on white. It may be related to text displayed on a display
    monitor. \r\nThere's a difference between black on white on CRT, on LCD, and in
    print. Often white backgrounds in computer displays are said to cause eye strain,
    but I'd guess the effect is not the same, or perhaps not existent, when the white
    is a flat surface color.\r\n\r\nJason C"

    little deductive reasoning suggests to me that the intense contrast of white on
    black results in \"affter images\" as the retina tracks across a line of text
    and has to adjust from receiving light receiving no light. (often described as
    \"dazzle\") ) It seems reasonable that a less extreme adjustment will result in
    a clearer, more legible image.\r\n\r\nDoes that seem reasonable?\r\n\r\n-=\xAE=-"

  body: "There was a chart on the wall that time I worked in a sign shop, displaying
    optimal color combinations for contrast and legibility. Though there is much I
    forget about the thing, I don't recall there being a spot showing white on dark
    gray being superior to white on black (though yellow on black did rank higher).
    White on gray maybe the subject of more recent research.\r\n\r\nI'll have a look
    around for some sign construction resources and get back to you."

  body: "In general, light text on dark tends to overwhelm the readability more than
    dark text on light. The common solution to this problem is to make the former
    text slightly bolder than the latter. Usually jumping from a regular to bold weight
    is too much for this purpose, though, so fonts with multiple weight options are
    more desirable.\r\n\r\nAs far as interior, non-illuminated signage, a dark shape
    with light lettering hung on a light colored wall will cause  most people to immediately
    recognize \"Hey, there is a sign here\", and if they are seeking an unfamiliar
    destination they may pause to read it. Black may not necessarily be the best color
    for the particular interior, but white text on black is perfectly functional."
