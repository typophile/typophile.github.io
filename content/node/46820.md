  City... Although I've already done a bit of research, I don't know where to find
  good bookshops (new or second-hand books) specialized in type or graphic design.
  \r\nAlso, I have to research on Morris Fuller Benton, so I thought I might find
  some material here in college or public libraries, but I have no clue of where to
  look for that.\r\n\r\nSo, if any New Yorker could help me with this, I'd be very
  grateful!\r\n\r\nIf you can think of any event related to type/graphic design coming
  this month, please don't hesitate to bring it up ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    nice. There\u2019s also a <a href=\"http://www.taschen.com/pages/en/company/contacts/823.htm\">Taschen
    store</a> and a nice selection of design titles can be found at the MoMA bookstore.
    The various school libraries may have weird summer hours, so call ahead for those.
    \r\n\r\nOtherwise the New York bookstores aren\u2019t very special, they\u2019re
    just bigger and more expensive versions of the bookstores found everywhere else.
    New Yorkers rave to me about the gigantic Strand Books (which isn\u2019t much
    bigger than a large suburban Barnes and Noble), but it\u2019s really just a huge
    clearing house for remainders and discounted bombs dressed up with some stacks
    of discounted new stuff, and the rare books room is mix of junk and esoterica,
    almost none of which is of use to typographers. Don\u2019t waste time there if
    you have serious research to get done. If you\u2019re looking for special antique
    stuff I have the address of a by-appointment only place that does type books around
    here somewhere."

    be unavailable till September or so.\r\n\r\nColumbia University has a terrific
    rare books library, but I believe it is by appointment only. I remember seeing
    a great collection of type specimens at a private showing there."

    cannot believe the wonderful Strand Bookstore is no more than a dumping ground
    now for B&N... \r\n\r\nMeanwhile - how is Alabaster Bookshop for used & rare books
    these days? Also, one of my old favorites, I forgot the name was on 59th Street
    off of Lexington -- are they even still there? They had a wonderful collection
    of rare maps as well?\r\n\r\nThe city never sleeps... it's always tossing and
    turning."

  body: "I\u2019m reversing my opinion on Strand Book\u2019s design selection; is
    has improved dramatically. They\u2019ve been working hard since January to clear
    out the crap by discounting it, including their backstock of old annuals. That
    space has been filled with an excellent selection of new and used books. The table
    of design books on the sales floor is no longer for bargain stuff, it\u2019s now
    primarily new books (priced well below MSRP) with some interesting used books
    mixed in. Interestingly, the selection at Strand and the giant Barnes and Noble
    design section on the other end of Union Square don\u2019t overlap much, making
    Union Square an art and design book nerd\u2019s dream.\r\n\r\nStrand has also
    just finished a reorganization of the books-on-books nook on the third floor.
    The piles of books are no longer on the floor, everything is grouped intelligibly,
    duplicates are shelved together, and so on. The prices are also much more reasonable
    than they were in the past\u2014I\u2019ve picked things up there for half or even
    a third what other collectors paid there, and it is similarly less expensive than
    buying online. The selection of other rare books seems better overall. I\u2019m
    not sure if this is because people aren\u2019t able to snap good stuff up, if
    desperate collectors are selling books to get by, or if they\u2019ve finally got
    around to shelving a lot of backstock, but it\u2019s a real pleasure to walk through
    these days."

  body: Man, last time I was in the city I came upon a little hole-in-the-wall bookstore
    with lots of rare and out of print stuff (they had a nice collection of vinyl
    as well), but I can't remember the name or address. I <em>think</em> it was within
    a few blocks of Rudy's Music on 7th ave. between 48th and 49th. I'll let you know
    if I find out what it's called.
