  with other fonts in a brochure? And if yes, could you be kind enough to share font
  names that go well with Helvetica Neue?\r\n\r\nThanks very much."

    But a more important question is: what is the brochure about?'

  body: Thanks to all of you... I want to create a brochure for a real estate agency...
    I am using Helvetica neue and I would like to complement it with another one for
    the text within the brochure (long sentences). I tried using the same font everywhere
    (different variations though) but while I like the font for headers, logo letters
    and so on, I found it very cold and too... mechanic?... for long paragraphs of
    text. Was wondering if there was another font I could use to ease a little on
    legibility. Your suggestions are welcome.

  body: "Transitional and Modern Serifs should work quite well, but also Garaldes
    like Garamond \u2013 depends on what kind of atmosphere you aim at. If you are
    looking for a more human, legible, friendly touch, choose an open typeface from
    the Garalde subclass like Plantin, Galliard, Swift or Proforma For more neutrality
    browse the Transitional/Baroque like Utopia, Rotation, Farnham. More classy, austere
    look in the areas of Modern (bracketed) typefaces.\r\n  \r\ngood suggestions:

    would recommend a rather broad face with not too much contrast, something sturdy,
    real estate."
