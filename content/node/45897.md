  Pica and Jules C\xEDcero\r\n\r\nWedding Invitation\r\n\r\nAs Pica and C\xEDcero
  are so much famous, I thought, \"humm, let\xB4s just marry them.\"\r\nActually it
  come to my mind a couple of weeks ago, when I was writing some texts for wedding
  invitations.\r\nAs some fellow Typophiles are even considering names their babies
  as such, I felt that this is the right time to do the public announcement. It is
  probable that Anne and Jules may marry in Orlando, but impossible Pica and C\xEDcero
  doing the same.\r\nThe names work well as words, as the time differs between so
  illustrious names. I used two colors, deep black and gold as to give it a very formal
  approach. The second picture show the tracing to extructure the text. It is not
  as good as Villard's diagram for what I could call it, St. Andrew's diagram.\r\nI
  will be very much appreciative of your comments. Please, Ladies, your comments are
  very important, as I am trying to design a line of invites for sometime now thinking
  about all of you.\r\nThe text is set on a script I am trying to understand and the
  gothic is Engraver's Gothic BT.\r\n\r\nI thank You in advance.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9\r\n"
