body: Currently I'm writing my art history thesis paper on typography in Soviet propaganda
  and I need any help I can get.  It's still early in the semester and I might change
  it to typography in Fascist propaganda, but any links or reading material anyone
  can submit would be greatly appreciated, thanks.

    & either futurist or socialist realism) to Fascist propaganda in the same breath?
    (Italian or German Fascist? - either way, for starters, it's a different alphabet
    than Soviet propaganda)\r\n\r\n-=\xAE=-"

    be at least one in every graduating class. And unless you plan on traveling to
    libraries and private collections to view propaganda books and magazines, you\u2019re
    going to run out of material pretty quickly as the good propaganda posters weren\u2019t
    typeset (especially in the Communist nations)."
