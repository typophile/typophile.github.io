  had been modified though (at once, the \"E\" and the \"S\", as well as the \"8\",
  evidently don't match), I believe that's hardly it?... Couldn't get any closer than
  <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/europa-grotesk-no-2-sh/bla-con/>Europa
  Grotesk</a>, myself, either, which also doesn't quite match yet (roughly, still
  missing that shorter horizontal middle bar in the \"E\", at least)...\r\n\r\nWould
  greatly appreciate any further help to get to the right match, thank you! :-)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rsmt_4798.JPG]"

    The italics might be 'fake italics.'

  body: What else can I say? Thank you! (Had been wandering around for those perfectly
    round "S" and "8".) Impressive. Thank you again so much! :-)
