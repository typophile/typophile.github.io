  for something most similar in style to Linux Libertine? \r\n\r\nAlso, what do you
  suggest as a san serif compliment?"

  body: Hello. You could try Crimson Text or Heuristica which I have not used extensively
    but they are free from fontsquirrel.com. Or try Iowan Old Style which comes with
    Mac OS X; it has a wide range of characters, including some ornaments, and comes
    in titling and black weights.
