body: I am creating a transitional serif face and it occurred to me that it was pointless
  to create an italic and a bold weight of it. Is it normal to create just a Roman/normal
  weight? Has this been done before (for a commercial face)?

  body: It seems to me that lots of typefaces are at least initially created in a
    single weight. It depends on the purpose you intend to put it to what variants
    you would need.

  body: Just a roman is enough for me. But just wanted to make sure that it wasn't
    necessary or strange not to have one. Kinda felt obligated.

  body: "If your goal is to produce a fully featured text face, sure, you need at
    least a plain (Roman), bold, italic, and bold italic. Small caps, old style figures,
    and extended ligature and swash sets in each of those styles are highly desirable.\r\n\r\nOther
    than that, making a single style is not at all unheard of."
