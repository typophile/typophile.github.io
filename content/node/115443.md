  body: "Looks like Old Style 7, designed by Miller & Richard in 1902.   Digital revival
    \r\nhttp://www.identifont.com/find?font=old+style+7&q=Go Note that numbers were
    not necessarily considered parts of a font and printers would substitute numbers
    as they saw fit.\r\nAnother possibility is Century Old Style, designed by Morris
    Fuller Benton and originally published by ATF in 1909.    Digital revival http://www.identifont.com/show?HK
    \r\nR might be closer in Old Style 7. But compare the lowercase. It seems to like
    somewhere between the two typefaces.\r\nThe original version of Old Style was
    cut by Alexander Phemister of Miller & Richard in 1860 and was soon coped by other
    foundries. [Source: Jaspert's _Type Encyclopedia [1970]_ Indeed, this could be
    a variation cut by a Swedish Foundry.\r\nDon"

    like a mix of them both, thanks for the help! I think I\xB4ll go with the Century
    Old Style, I had it in the archives.\r\n\r\ncheers\r\nG\r\n"
