    of your fonts, and I admire your work), but you can also look for other casual
    printing styles in [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/Script11Pg1.html|Part 11
    of the Script Font ID Guide]] to get ideas for other similar styles.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Hi, Mike-\r\n\r\nYou are right that there are plenty of casual hand-drawn
    style fonts, and they are \u2013 in most parts \u2013 very good. But with Suomi
    Hand it is hand-writing in a single style, with all points in all glyphs hand
    drawn into place to keep the scale. I used no auto-tracing, and I never scanned
    anything, just had samples of the text next to me while drawing the glyphs."
