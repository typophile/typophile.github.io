  soldiers of lead\" in Vincent Steer's <em>Printing Design & Layout</em>. Googling
  it has mostly thrown back the quotation \"With twenty-six soldiers of lead I can
  conquer the world\" variously attributed to Karl Marx, Anonymous, William Caxton
  and Benjamin Franklin.\r\n\r\nCould anyone here tell me who in fact coined the expression
  or offer any other details?\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "\u201CThat dramatic statement is French in origin, and (as they say) of a
    certain age \u2013\_which means, here as always, of an uncertain age. Who said
    it, and when? Was it a village-bound boaster with a sudden and wonderful revelation
    of the dramatic spirit? Or was it in very truth a conqueror of men\u2019s minds?\r\nLet
    those who know further tell us. Let the birthplace of his aunt, the recollections
    of his schoolmaster, the intrigues which gave him his start in life, let his habits
    in face of the bottle (to which he was wont to ascribe so musch of his success
    or failure), his taste in cigars, or sword-hilts, or politics, or religion \u2013
    let all be left unknown and ungathered. For whoever he was, however he prospered,
    he said and he did (I'll be bound) nothing else that could justify the sublime
    arrogance of that declaration \u2013 \u2018with twenty-five soldiers of lead I
    have conquered the world\u2019. Anything more of his were a derogation from that
    assertion, or a flat denial, or (worst of all) a jest thrown at it \u2013\_a very
    profanation of his moment of divinity\u201D\r\n\r\nFrancis Meynell, Typography,
    Pelican Press, 1923\r\n\r\nThe number indicates that it is a mid-17th century
    quote, possibly 1640 (again, according to Meynell). Taken from Typographers on
    Type edited by Ruari McLean.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: Thanks Georg, wonderful quote. I found out by googling that it is from Georg
    Christoph Lichtenberg, who is apparently not much read outside Germany. I see
    from a bit of reading about him that he is a fascinating personality--I will have
    to get a book on him!
