		<div class="commentbody">Outside is a monthly outdoor/adventure/men's magazine published out of Santa Fe. If you go to SPD.org you might find some spreads of ours; we won Silver Medal for magazine of the year last year (ha! and yet here I am asking about Minion, hm?).  <BR> <BR>The photos and illos are usually pretty nice (illos by the Clayton Bros, Brian Cronin, Zohar Lazar, etc., photos by James Nachtwey, Anton Corbijn, Jake Chessum, etc.) . <BR>I think the main thing is that our creative director would like to make a departure from the body copy font that she had to inherit when she arrived at the magazine. Right now we're using Caslon224 Book. Yeek. The other fonts we use mainly are Interstate, Giza and BigCaslon for display.  <BR> <BR>I also thought that maybe Miller (Font Bureau) would work well as a new serif?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Jana &ndash; OUTSIDE is too interesting for Minion. Interesting in a bold, graphic, appealing sort of way. I'm not an outdoorsy type, but I still find myself looking at the mag when I'm in Border's. <BR> <BR>Miller is wonderful. And as a bonus you can license the display and text versions when you feel like splashing out with larger serifs. I also think it flows well with Big Caslon. Or if you want something a little more understated you might look at Whitman (also from Font Bureau). Both have OsF and smallcaps and all the requisite goodies. <BR> <BR>Another idea, perhaps a little more similar to Minion, but more interesting IMO, would be <a href="http://bitstream.com/categories/products/nfc/iowan_complete/iowan_complete.html" target="_blank">Iowan Oldstyle</a> &hellip; again all the goodies. <BR> <BR>Or, if you want a little more flavor than Minion, something truly French, you might try <a href="http://www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/view/LeMondeJournal" target="_blank">Le Monde Journal</a></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Actually, Minion wasn't bundled with Adobe apps for a couple of generations, but it is with the CS apps. I think it's a first-rate text face, but it certainly is ubiquitous. <BR> <BR>Most of the other suggestions seem pretty solid. Iowan Oldstyle, Whitman and Miller are all great choices. I think Le Monde Journal is perhaps a little too refined for this usage (an objection that could also be made to Minion). <BR> <BR>One other typeface of ours springs to mind for this usage: Chaparral. I think it would be an excellent choice if you're looking for something a little more out of the ordinary. As the name suggests, it has that sturdy, outdoorsy feel. <BR> <BR>BTW, sorry that our sales folks aren't as up on typography as one might like.  <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif" ALT=":-&#40;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>T <BR></div>

Pick up a copy of <i>Details</i> <BR>for an example of how well it works. <BR> <BR>I think another interesting choice was <i>Wallpaper</i>'s use of <BR>Plantin Schoolbook. Plantin is a proven long-reading face, but <BR>the 'a' and 'g' variants of the Schoolbook version lent a distinctive <BR>quality without being overbearing. Not sure if they're still using <BR>it because I haven't seen <i>Wallpaper</i> in a while, but <a href="http://typographi.ca/000490.php" target="_blank">here</a>'s an <BR>example of the copy I saw. <BR> <BR>Of course, none of these have the condensed quality of Minion, <BR>but I think condensed is overrated for a text face.

		<div class="commentbody">Jana, I'm thinking the three &quot;character traits&quot; you want here are: robust, honest, and youthful. Besides that you want something highly readable for a magazine, mostly meaning something with a somewhat large but not too large x-height. I'll resist suggesting a wedge-serif yet again (my &quot;pet genre&quot;, Jana, since you might not have been here long enough to realize :-), but ideally I think you want something wide, somewhat rigid but a touch idiosyncratic, with chunky serifs. <BR> <BR>Of the suggestions so far, Whitman and Miller seem good, although the former might be a touch too feminine here - but its proportions are right on, and it has a bounce in its step that Miller might be lacking. Now that I think about it, maybe Miller is too stodgy here. <BR> <BR>BTW, in the Adobe library, besides Chaparral (a great suggestion) you might consider Warnock too. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

I find it unattractive, mannered and dark en masse &ndash; look at an old issue of Adobe magazine before it died to see Chapparal used as a text face. (Ick.) <BR> <BR>I'd second (or third?) the recommendation of Miller. It's plainspokenness would be an asset with all of the other faces (and expressive headline typography) that Outside uses.

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; always same things are proposed. <BR> <BR>Yes, that's a problem (with me at least). When asked casually, people will propose what's at the top of their heads at the moment. My own &quot;excuse&quot; is that I have too little experience <i>using</i> type (even less than your average type designer), but what I can try to do is apply what I've learned about &quot;congeniality&quot; (or what Ovink calls &quot;atmosphere value&quot;) to the choices at hand. <BR> <BR>And I think what you're doing JF, staying in our &quot;minds&quot; by participating here, is good for your fonts. <BR> <BR>&gt; Outside is a particularly American looking mag. <BR>&gt; So it is appropriate to go for something with <BR>&gt; a US flavor. <BR> <BR>But suggesting a &quot;robust, honest, and youthful&quot; font for a male outdoorsy mag is not? <BR> <BR>Plantin Schoolbook: yes, I agree it's robust and honest, but more than youthful to me it just feels retarded. Those alternates are not working, as far as I'm concerned - certainly not for adult material - they were made to ease learning, and that's how they really work. <BR> <BR>&gt; gobbledegook <BR> <BR>Yes, do ignore 5 centuries of anecdotal evidence and a century of empirical evidence, because Larson said so. Oh and of course because Emigre said so. &quot;We Read Best What We Read Most.&quot; The Hogwash of the Century.

That would be such a&hellip; <i>cultural</i> statement. Just make sure the content isn't worth actually reading, 'cause nobody will. <BR> <BR>People are making <i>news</i> faces with zero understanding of readabililty. That's &quot;democracy&quot; for you. <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR> <BR>That said, there is I think some cultural justification for using a sans in a magazine&hellip; although it certainly helps that magazine reading sessions tend to be very short!

		<div class="commentbody">It depends on how you define &quot;immersive reading&quot;. Larson's parallel-letterwise model is inherently limited in terms of how deep into immersion it can go. Any act of reading that doesn't use boumas can't be said to be fully immersive. For an adult reader, the only thing &quot;below&quot; parallel-letterwise reading is sequential-letterwise reading, and since adults are proficient in parallelism, it actually takes an extra effort to read sequentially - so the immersive threshold for adults is between letterwise and bouma, not sequential and parallel. <BR> <BR>BTW, I have spent plenty of time learning not only what Larson said, but also reading up on almost all his references. Anyway, there will be a round table discussion in Thessaloniki in a month (with John Hudson moderating, so I'm already at a disadvantage, even though I'm sure John will try to be objective - but a human is a human) and we'll see what people conclude. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hey, wait a second - more than half of those are fonts I recommend all the time!  :-) <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR> <BR>Jana, I just took a look at the current issue of Outside, and here's some ideas: <BR>-It's a really busy, even riotous magazine! Sometimes even a humorless guy like me gets turned on - like I loved the look of that &quot;crazy mofos&quot; article. <BR>-The Caslon for text actually has a charm here, I think - but it's also too frail, and a bit old-fashioned. <BR>-Interstate: although it makes sense in an outdoor transportation sort of way, to me it feels like the odd man out: too plain, and not in a constructive way, because there's a lot going on anyway. <BR> <BR>So I might suggest these ideas: <BR>-Do try Chaparral. Coupled to that charming fat Egyptian for subheads, I think it might sing sing sing. <BR>-Consider dumping Interstate. As a sub, try to find a sans that matches Chaparral. Like what? <BR> <BR>I think the highly &quot;talkative&quot; layout needs a somewhat more focused base to really work optimally, and reducing the number of fonts (which is not the same thing as taming all the fonts) might really click. On the other hand, no magazine I've designed has won an award. My defence here is that I've never designed a magazine. :-P <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>
