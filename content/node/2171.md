  format &#40;.INX&#41; for compatibility with InDesign 2.0. To open these documents
  in version 2.0, you&#39;ll need to obtain and install the Scripting plug-in and
  the XML Reader plug-in. You can obtain these plug-ins from the Adobe Web site.&#34;
  <BR> <BR>OK, I CAN NOT find these plugins ANYWHERE on the Adobe Site? <BR> <BR>Anyone

    to find a form to fax back to them.

  body: WTF! <BR> <BR>Seriously. What about saving earlier versions of AI?? <BR> <BR>Nothing
    like a CHOKE HOLD, into upgrading EVER system in yor office to CS. I mean, this
    WAS the plan, but all at once is a little spendy, so in the meantime, I have some
    systems with, some without, and I&#39;m f&#42;cked? <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif"

    AI.  Just make sure you don&#39;t need to edit any of the text in the saved down
    version.

  body: I am very irritated with Adobe. I would love to be working in CS full time,
    but a lot of my printers have yet to upgrade. I understand that a lot of CS features
    won&#39;t translate to 2.0 &#40;mixed spot inks for example&#41;, but give us
    the option to down-save please!! I would gladly pay $50 for a plug-in to go from
    CS to 2.0.2.

  body: It is possible that a feature like this might show up in the future. As many
    have noted, it was in development for InDesign CS. It got shelved because it didn&#39;t
    work well enough for prime time. <BR> <BR>Even a translation feature that did
    work well enough to be released would &#42;NOT&#42; be useful for sending a document
    to a printer! To use it for such a function would be a Really Bad Idea, and people
    who tried it would be Very Disappointed. The functionality would be to allow a
    document to go back to the older version for changing content. <BR> <BR>As Chris
    suggests, if you want to print, and somebody doesn&#39;t have the right version
    of the application, use PDF. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T

  body: Thomas is right. The real need for a &#34;Save As InD 2.0&#34;  <BR>option
    does not come from users wanting to send docs to  <BR>printers, but for the sadly
    very common scenario in which a  <BR>document needs to be edited by InD 2.0 users
    after it&#39;s  <BR>been created in InD CS.
