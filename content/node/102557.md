  is the result of a serendipitous collaboration with <a href=\"http://soulellis.com/\">Paul
  Soulellis</a>. For his project <a href=\"http://libraryoftheprintedweb.tumblr.com/\">Library
  of the Printed Web</a>, Paul was looking for a dotted typeface reminiscent of the
  punched-out caps on Marcel Duchamp\u2019s 1934 <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/2002.42a-vvvv\">Green
  Box</a>. As he could not find a typeface close enough, I was spontaneously tempted
  to make one. This is it. (<a href=\"http://soulellis.com/2013/04/selavy/\">Paul\u2019s
  beautiful blog post</a> also reflects on the process.)\r\n\r\nS\xE9lavy (named after
  Duchamp\u2019s pseudonym Rrose S\xE9lavy) is a dotted typeface that does not follow
  a non-dotted model; it exploits its dotted character for instance by forming spontaneous
  \xABligations\xBB between letter pairs like fi or fl, but also EE or LL. (Or FTW!)
  It is quirky (especially in the caps) and recognizable, but pretty legible also
  in non-huge sizes (whereas if set very large, it tends to disintegrate into a pattern
  of dots).\r\n\r\nIn addition to being used by Paul in his abovementioned project,
  we are simultaneously releasing S\xE9lavy to the public as a free font under the
  SIL Open Font License. And we are not only making the ready-to-use font file available
  but also the fully component-based source UFO file, making it easy for those with
  access to type design software to generate new instances of the design.\r\n\r\n<a
