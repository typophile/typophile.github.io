    would be ITC Ronda.\r\n\r\nAlthough I'm not sure yet how to do the formatting
    to give you a link. "

  body: "I don't know where (or if) there is a FAQ for posted text formatting & linking,
    but the way I show links is (double opening bracket)url of link|name of font(double
    closing bracket). You can also use html commands if you know them, but they are
    a bit more work.\r\n\r\nYou can look at the Source for any thread page to see
    how various formatting is done.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
