  body: Which newspaper is this from? I believe this is a custom designed newspaper
    headline face, possibly The Font Bureau, Inc. or Hoefler & Frere-Jones or something
    like that.

  body: This is no didone. The serifs are bracketed. It's more of an English Modern
    or Scotch, like <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/font_bureau/miller_display_roman/&sample_text=Al%20Qaeda&sample_size=90">Miller</a>
