  alternate characters is in TT and PS T1 fonts. <BR>What are the pros and cons to:
  <BR>1&#41; housing alternates in a completely separate font &#40;assuming you only
  have one alternate glyph per character&#41; <BR>2&#41; assigning alternates to slots
  that rightly belong to other seldom-used characters &#40;ie. Omega, mu, pi, logical
  symbols, etc.&#41; <BR>3&#41; using private use slots??? <BR> <BR>oh, and just for

  body: In TT you can of course leave them unmapped and add a GSUB table and use the
    alternate OpenType feature - if the font is unsigned it is still technically a
    TrueType font.  <BR> <BR>But as that isn&#39;t one of the answers I think the
    only standards conformant option would be option 1. <BR> <BR>Just for fun - <a

  body: thanks for the info, Si. Can Windows users access unmapped characters using
    the Character Map &#40;or whatever it&#39;s called&#41;? Do Mac users have any
    utility that would give access to unmapped characters?

    - they do not appear in Character Map.  <BR> <BR>Si

  body: Considering the current lack of support for the &#39;salt&#39;/&#39;ss01&#39;
    features on InDesign, I&#39;d think that, even for an OT font, it can be useful
    to ship separate fonts for alternates.
