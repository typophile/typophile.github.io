  help me ID the font used here? Much appreciated![img:sites/default/files/old-images/6149901693_2ebf67716b_o_5327.jpg]

  body: I am a type newb but I'm going to guess it's in the Univers family?  It looks
    very similar to a typeface I was looking for the other day, Univers Ultra Condensed
    Light.  This looks like the Bold version perhaps?  I wouldn't bet the house on
    it though... ;)

    Thanks everyone.
