<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>"Craft is that venerable ability to shape perfection by seeing the big picture but also being passionate about the details. Today, details can be hard to find when everything is moving so quickly and computers are able to produce a multitude of layouts, but the truth remains, it isn’t the quantity, it’s the quality."
In the new Folio magazine, I ask some questions about graphic design style and where design is headed.
Feel free to read and comment.

<div class=commentbody>Craft is essentially about serving people (in contrast to Art, which is essentially about expressing one's Self). If Craft has gone down in value over the past century, it's because the Self has become too important. Let's right the balance by spending less on Art.

<div class=commentbody>Hmmm...probably not much more than a hundred years ago the link between craft and the fine arts was taken for granted and one of them was both the same. The notion that somehow craft is separate, different or lacking in expression and that only art can express one's self: that expression and craft are at odds, is pure ignorant folly. How quickly we forget our past and from what we have grown, if grown we have. The finest "artists" of the past whose work is regarded by many to be the bench mark of fine art were "mere craftsman" earning a living by working to commissions and serving the people. Their work did not lack craft, nor lack expression for the simple fact that one can not exist without the other. Craft is the crucial, the only link between intention and expression. Without craft there is only intention. Craft knowledge may be hard to define, but its not ineffable.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Craft and Art are concepts, never existing in a pure state; any human act is somewhere between pure Craft and pure Art, but never at either extreme. Also, Craft is not devoid of expression; no human act is. The difference -as always- is Intent.

<div class=commentbody>I risk getting into a debate here. I don't agree, Hrant. I would ague that Craft is knowledge, and it has two heads. I would also ague that Intent is discovered through the process of making.
There is no difference between craft and intent for they are not separate concepts. No intent exists without craft for it is craft knowledge that gives birth to intent and vise versa. No doubt we could go on for ever about this, so I had better stop here or I will miss my deadline.

<div class=commentbody>Craft is physical prowess. Art is an intellectual pursuit. Drawing on their passion and emotional response to the world, the craft of designers produces their art.
"Art is a preishood which requires pure souls who belong to it entirely." - Paul Cezanne
"Imagination is more important than knowledge." - Albert Einstein.
"The basic project of art is always to make the world whole and comprehensible, to restore it to us in all its glory and its occasional nastiness, not through argument but through feeling, and then to close the gap between you and everything that is not you, and in this way pass from feeling to meaning. It's not something that committees can do. It's not a task achieved by groups or by movements. It's done by individuals, each person mediating in some way between a sense of history and an experience of the world." - Robert Hughs, "Shock of the New", 1980
"Setting out to do what ultimately cannot be perfected is what makes art. The effort to do the impossible leads to creative work." - John Sloan
"The fact of the matter is that art is not a science and is not subject to any tangible law." - Otto Dix, 1958
"It is harder to see than it is to express. The whole of art rests in the artist's ability to see well into what is before him. Nothing will do but the most precise statement. He must not only bend technique to his will, but he must invent technique that will fit his need." - Robert Henri "Art Spirit"
"Content is not the same thing as subject matter: it is what the artist discovers in his subject. It is its content that makes any work of art dynamic. It is the content that the artist distills from life and which, through its influence on the spectator as she comprehends it, flows back into life…
"The content of a work of art can only derive from definite, specific, particular experience. The artist cannot aim at such qualities directly. They will be achieved by the most faithfull insight into what it means to be a particular person in a particular situation." - John Berger
"It is empathy with the human condition and artistic freedom the ultimately produce the greatest work." - Justin Green
"When one follows nature, one obtains everything." - Auguste Rodin
"Genius is only recognized in people who suceed." - William Merritt Chase
"Since bad art has a harmful effect on society it should never go unchallenged; but since the bad artist (like the good one) is an artist at all only because he claims he is, and has gotten at least one other person to believe him, how is he to be challenged? The only available rules are those of the gunfighter." - John Gardner
"When a painter is unfaithful to his experience in order to meet the needs of a conventional demand of the period's taste, his talents are betrayed."
"The function of the original artist is to renew the tradition to which he belongs." - John Berger
"People who make art their business are mostly impostors." - Pablo Picasso
"Minimal art is maximum profit." - Isamu Noguchi, Minimalist sculptor
"To be at odds with his times - there lies the raison d'etre of the artist!" - André Gide

Craft is also technique, surely? The ancient Greek word for art was <em>techne</em>, and the greatest works of ancient Greek art were a seamless combination of technique (craft) with art and which posessed the quality of "life". Naturally craft involves knowledge, but it seems craft is also inseparable from technique. Maybe I'm only engaging in semantic quibbling here. Technique also involves knowledge, but are technique (craft) and knowledge inseparable?
I really don't know.

<div class=commentbody>Craft is skill, which implies both knowledge and ability. Specifically, it is the skill necessary to realise a thing (shape, give form, design, construct, make real). Art is that aspect of a thing that is extra-utile, i.e. that is not functional but is the focus of our aesthetic sense, our delight in beauty and ideas. Art as a class of object, refers to things whose character is wholly or almost wholly extra-utile. Such objects, like anything else we make, require craft to be effectively realised: it doesn't matter how clever the artist's idea or how beautiful his conception if he can't realise it. Just as art requires craft, everything that human beings consciously make is tinged with some degree of art, some extra-utile quality. Humans are aesthetic creatures, and when we make judgements about how to form a thing, no matter how dully functional the object in question, we include aesthetic criteria. Some objects leave little room for art, of course, because their function really does define their form, but seldom is an extra-utile component entirely absent.
Hrant's definitions of art and craft simply don't work. I am sympathetic to the criticism of individual expression contra making things for other people, but the use of 'art' and 'craft' to characterise the distinction doesn't make any sense and, worse, plays into an individualist and debased romantic view of art as 'self-expression' that is historically unjustifiable. As Bringhurst observed in a recent essay, if your self is the only thing your art expresses, it's not up to much as art. Art expresses the world and the experience of people living in the world, which is not merely individual experience. If art only expressed the individuality of the artist , why on earth would we -- would anyone -- consider it important or interesting?</div>
