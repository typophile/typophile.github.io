  but it has been styled with distressed edges which I don't like. Please can someone
  help identify a similar blackletter font that has similar characteristics, specifically
  the extra stroke that follow the black filled parts of the letters. In an ideal
  world I would like the same font but with hard, computerised edges as oppose to
  the hand rendered look.\r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance."
