  body: "Overall, I like this typeface. I'd make some adjustments though.\r\nNumber
    4 looks smaller than other numbers.\r\nThe \xABoblique\xBB cut you use on some
    letters are not regular. I think it would be better if it was.\r\n\r\nThe lower
    k would have advantage to look like the K.\r\nW : Middle join should be raise
    and horizontal\r\na numeral has a too short lower tail."

  body: I wonder about if you should have a more narrow wW & M & lower the join given
    the rest of the design. Also - it looks like ytou have not worked on iterletter
    spacing yet. In a way it's hard to know about the forms without seeing at least
    a preliminary spacing/kerning. The space character should maybe be a bit wider
    - the words are running together a bit too much for me.

  body: I always have problems with spacing and kerning, I haven't found a good system
    to getting correct spacing. Do you have any advise ?

  body: "Hmmm\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of posts on Typophile about this. And I am less
    expert than most of the folks here. By all means read up on what they say about
    this topic & process. \r\n\r\nBut if pressed I suppose I would have to say these
    kinds of things:\r\n\r\n1. Type shapes need to be bourne out of not just an idea
    of how they could be shaped but how they combine with other letters/numbers/punctuation
    (glyphs). The whole relationship is important & all the elements feedback on each
    other. This makes for a design process not unlike a hall of mirrors. This is true
    in general for all type - but it is *especially true* in a face that may be meant
    for text - which yours seems to be. Getting to the point where the shapes are
    designed in this way will probably take lots of time and maybe even several typeface
    designs. \r\n\r\n2. Before worrying about Kerning try to get as good a set of
    basic Spacing as you can. Learn which combinations are likely to give you trouble
    anyway and discount them for the purposes of initial spacing. An example is 'Av'.
    The spacing on this combination will need to be kerned later, but the spacing
    on Ao should not have to be kerned. Get that one right with basic Spacing. But
    search here on Typophile & on google. Remember, your forms will also dictate.
    Whatever rules you find, your own eye has to be the final judge. \r\n\r\n3. When
    you get the basic spacing right apply kerning to the special cases. \r\n\r\nTest
    the face & you may decide to alter your shapes, basic spacing or kerning - or
    all three.\r\n\r\nAnd then you go around & around again with this process until
    you think it's good.\r\n\r\nI like your shapes BTW."

  body: "The process I use at the moment is described in 'Letters of Credit, by Walter
    Tracy'. This involves spacing characters like oonnoo and oohhoo, then using the
    side bearing values for other characters with the same shapes, so the spacing
    for the left side of the lowercase 'c' would be the same as that for the lowercase
    'o'. I had actually spent time spacing Depot, but I obviously need more practise.\r\nI
    feel more confident with Kerning, but the spacing needs to be more complete, Depot
    does have Kerning at the moment, its proably not apparent as the spacing is incorrect."
