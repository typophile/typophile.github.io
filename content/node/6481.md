  body: Very interesting, yet factually skewed. I could spend the time to address
    each of the many points that are woefully misleading, but as an unpaid officer
    of SOTA, I have to get to work at my paying job, as I do not have endless leisure
    time that many academics seem to have to wax endlessly on topics they are only
    partly informed on. I did hear some rumblings after TC2002 about Freddy Nader
    being squeezed out of the planning committee &#40;Which is funny because his name
    never came up during the planning as a potential planner or potential speaker&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>I will let others clarify the rest of Lucs well-intentioned but all too
    uninformed commentary.
