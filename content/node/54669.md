body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm working on a lifestyle booklet/catalogue for a premium brand
  and want to introduce a complementary serif for editorial use with their house font,
  Avant Garde. Would be nice to get a family that can work both as an alternative
  headline (to AG body) as well as suitable body copy to an AG headline. At the moment
  they only use Avant Garde in Medium and Book. Tonally, I'm looking to warm up what
  is currently a very clinical feel, and introduce changes in pace throughout the
  booklet.\r\n\r\nthanks in advance for any comments/suggestions,\r\n\r\nK"

  body: Lubalin Graph is pretty much exactly Avant Garde with slab serifs attached.
    Still, even with serifs, the geometric monoline look may not be as comfortable
    for reading as you might want for lengthy runs of text.

  body: "Most people do suggest Lubalin Graph, but that doesn't help us get away from
    the harsh geometric feel. Definitely need the warmer curves of a nice serif to
    balance out the spreads. I'll have a look at Brioni, but there must also be a
    few classic serifs out there that work well with Avant Garde.\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\n\r\n"

    Lubalin.

  body: "Thanks guys. Paul, was there a particular Didone you were thinking of? A
    didone would obviously work great for headlines, but doesn't really suit as alternative
    body copy against AG headlines. Gonna try Nick's suggestion of using Times. Any
    other suggestions much appreciated.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I wasn't suggesting using Times, as I have no idea what your layouts are
    like.\r\nIn the AG magazine, Lubalin's heads were all caps and squared off--justified
    columns of Times text went well with that.\r\nIt's interesting to note that another
    famous art director/type designer, Neville Brody, used Times as the text face
    of <em>The Face</em>, again matching justified text columns with squared off heads
    (in Industria).\r\nBoth art directors felt it necessary to become type designers
    as there were no faces available to fully satisfy the strict geometry of the layouts
    they wanted to do."

  body: "Avant Garde is harshly geometric, but because of that you know what sort
    of letterforms to look at. \r\n\r\nWould I be wrong in thinking that some oldstyle
    type might work? I've never really thought about it before. I'm thinking an oldstyle
    O, with very little contrast. Not a spindly oldstyle, and perhaps not too sophisticated
    in its curves. (It is after all, being matched with Avant Garde...)\r\n\r\nThere
    might be too much life in an oldstyle though. \r\n\r\nIs there a such thing as
    a geometric oldstyle? Of course, we have examples like Albers, etc., but oldstyles
    are typically associated with their humanist touch. What about a geometric oldstyle
    with less of the humanism and more of the geometry, but without the increases
    in contrast associated with the move away from humanism and into rationalism and
    the engraving tool?"

    ya, obviously it wouldn't work as a textface. Something like Minion might actually
    work nicely."

  body: "Hey guys,\r\n\r\nI'm struggling with the same issue and found that archer,
    while not exactly geometric, has enough personality to complementy but not overwhelm
    avant garde. It also has a great italic if you need to soften things further.
    Let me know how you go."

  body: Didot. Like AG, it's elegant and beautiful, but make sure you don't use it
    at small point sizes. Delegate/relegate that role to the AG.

    to say your problem is not the pairing with a serif. Your problem is Avant Garde.\r\nTry
    to get rid of it and it\u2019ll be a new life.\r\n\r\nThere *are* good sans alternatives
