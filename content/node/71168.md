  We have come up with a first draft for our logo which you can find attached. Kindly
  provide advice on a better typeface/type treatment for the logo. I will also be
  happy to hear your views on the logo. \r\n\r\nThis is my first post here and I think
  this is a great site. Thanks a lot!"

  body: I really don't like the font, so I'd adjust it. And maybe you could consider
    to not crop the leaf as a square.

    you may try out; use lowercase Baskerville and set the letterspacing at very narrow."

  body: "Hi Chander, welcome. \r\n\r\nTo me the graphic looks rather odd, with the
    square leaf and the faded tree. When reduced small it becomes a strange-looking
    smudge that vaguely reminds me of an animal's snout. And the font doesn't seem
    like a good match for the feel of the graphic. \r\n\r\nNot trying to sound overly
    critical; the logo is a good first step but it just needs more work.\r\n\r\nCould
    you tell us more about the group? What age group? What will they be doing? What
    ideas should the logo represent?"

  body: "Hi James,\r\n\r\n        Thanks a lot for your feedback.It Means a lot. We
    are trying to refine it and it'll be great if you can suggest improvements which
    we can incorporate. The Organization focuses on providing wildlife and conservation
    education to school and college students in India in order to enable them to participate
    in conservation related activities..\r\n\r\n@Martin: Baskerville is not working
    out too well. Tried it out."

    to school and\r\n> college students in India...\r\n\r\nThanks for the additional
    info, Chander. My suggestion would be to see if you could incorporate the 2 concepts
    of education and conservation in the logo. For example, taking the tree image
    you already have (or something similar) and putting it inside the icon of an open
    book. Or combine somehow the image a leaf (preferably in its natural shape rather
    than square) and with the image of a teacher. Or any other combination that combines
    the 2 ideas of education and conservation.\r\n\r\nAs for the type, the current
    font just looks a little gimmicky to me. I'd suggest trying a more traditional
    font, something with a friendly and approachable look."
