  read than caps because they have a varied contour (ascenders & descenders vs. all
  letters the same height).\r\n\r\nThese days, how accepted is this theory? Has there
  been recent empirical cognitive research that tends to support it or refute it?
  I see it passed along as fact in many places but perhaps it has quietly gone obsolete,
  and if so, I would not want to propagate blarney. (Though if you wait long enough,
  most blarney gets rehabilitated.)\r\n"

    there been recent empirical cognitive research that tends to support it or refute
    it?</cite>\r\n\r\nPeople who can barely read never seem to have much trouble with
    the tiny, tightly-spaced, all-caps text in comic books, which suggests to me that
    all-caps is quite easy to read. Design pundits make a big deal about the differences
    in legibility and readability of lowercase and all-caps settings, but the differences
    are measured in fractions of a second. So if you aren\u2019t typesetting long
    copy, highway signage, or wayfinding systems then the difference is probably irrelevant.
    Of course one still needs to consider that many typefaces and a great deal of
    content will look like crap in all caps no matter how well one typesets it."

    speed and comprehension, but I don't have links to them.\r\n\r\nI think most graphic
    designers believe that sentences set in all caps are harder to read. It's not
    significant if you're just dealing with a few words (like a headline), but a paragraph
    in all caps is harder to read. \r\n\r\nIn fact a trick that designers occasionally
    do is that if you've got some text that must be included but your client DOESN'T
    want people to actually read it  -- like some bad news in an annual report --
    you put it in justified block paragraphs in all caps.  You'd think that all caps
    would draw more attention to it, but lots of folks will give up reading after
    the first few sentences of all caps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    \"as readable\", that's because the gold standard/acid test of readability is
    assumed to be books.\r\nBut for many other genres of typography, it's just fine.\r\nIn
    fact, all-caps is easier to read when leading is tight; check out the rock band

    factors when creating a design.  For a book or long article, it's extremely important.
    For smaller amounts of text, other factors may be a higher priority. And it's
    not important at all in a psychedelic poster. :)"

  body: "I just re-read 'A prayer for Owen Meany' by John Irwing. Unfortunately my
    paperback was set in Melior, and that meant that italics were very hard to distinguish
    from roman text.\r\n\r\nBut my point is that Owens' part is written in UPPERCASE,
    because of his unusual voice. And in my personal opinion, READING UPPER CASE JUST
    TOOK ME LONGER than lower case with the rest of the book. And that was the point
    for using UPPER CASE.\r\n\r\nUpper case is made for headlines, and lower case
    is for reading. I believe history has shown it.\r\n\r\nBut you can always do a
    Litmus test: set any text with upper and lower case and pick your favourite."

  body: If you're ever driving on the motorway doing a ton (or whatever the legal
    limit is for the country you're in :) you'll notice the difference straight away
    between a fast-approaching, uniform block of uppercase text, and mixed case place
    names, whose shapes are recognizable many seconds before they are readable. The
    former releases its information stubbornly, and irritatingly late, and the latter
    like a close friend. (Oh, and Transport's lowercase l has a little tail to differntiate
    it from an uppercase I)

  body: Also the came amount of text set in Cyrillic takes much longer time to read
    than in Latin letters. Cyrillic lowercase has very few ascenders and descenders
    so you have to read the text because it is made of longer and shorter blocks,
    not to quickly scan the shapes of words. Try to watch the same film with English
    subtitles and then with Russian. Reading Russian you haven't seen the film.
