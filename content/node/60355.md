body: I have an iMac G4 that runs OS 10.4.9 and OS 9.2.2 for my older programs.  I
  have some older versions of Illustrator and Photoshop (both on 9.2.2) and got some
  new fonts to install. These are FFIL fonts. I have used Fontbook in OSX and they
  show up fine in the OSX apps. But not in the older system 9 programs. Is there a
  way to resolve this short of buying new software?

  body: A "FFIL" file is a Mac "font suitcase" containing bitmapped screen fonts and
    spacing information. If the font is PostScript Type 1 format, there should also
    be a corresponding "LWFN" font file, which contains the outline data. In order
    to display a PostScript font in programs like Illustrator and Photoshop, you need
    both files installed in the OS 9 fonts folder.
