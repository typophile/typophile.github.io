In such an extreme case, I would a) remove the top serif and straighten that side of the stem, and b) lower the top of the bowl as much as possible without distorting the form too much, in order to create space for the crossbar. Something like this (hacked in Photoshop, so not very tidy): <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It is more important in designing diacritic letters for languages to preserve the particular identity of those letters than it is to preserve the particular details of a serif.

		<div class="commentbody">But the vast majority of non-western fonts are not made by natives. Were the comments in Typo 10 re. Croatian letterforms written by a Croat, or were they written by someone who has looked at a pile of CE fonts and recorded what he has seen? I don't remember. In any case, I've read e.g. rubbish written about Hindi type by Indians: basically, I think it is good to be cautious when someone says 'This form is good/normal/acceptable'. What are the criteria of judgement? How historically extensive is this view (often, it represents what one or two generations have gotten used to from type, and is cut off from the traditions of the script &ndash; you know that from your experience of Arabic)? I certainly wouldn't say that one should discount the views of native readers &ndash; definitely not &ndash;, but one needs to approach them critically just as you would any other view. You certainly can't assume that because someone is a native he or she can 'feel' a way to a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->design<!-- raw HTML omitted --> solution.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">No doubt that Type 10 is a great resource. It is good that it even considers e.g. how Croatian diacritics might be made for ultra heavy types: this is the sort of question that much commentary on diacritic design fails to consider. I'm just saying that years of research into the typography of other languages have encouraged me to take most information with a big grain of salt, especially when someone says 'This is the way we do it in our country'. My immediate response is 'How long have you been doing this in your country?' Often, they don't know, and research indicates that it is a new development, frequently in response to some technical limitation, or a time saving measure (certainly, URW's solution for the Cooper Black dcroat is a lot easier and faster than mine), or, ironically, something introduced two generations ago by an outsider.</div>
