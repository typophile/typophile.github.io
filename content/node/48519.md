body: "As well known, my complaint that Fontlab doesn't provide adequate zoom is longstanding.
  Fog 5 beta, available since 1996, 12 years ago, provides 3200% which is just about
  adequate for fine work. \r\n\r\nSome time ago, Adam Twardoch published, on the type
  design list, a technique for tricking Fontlab into zooming to 3200%:\r\n\r\n'In
  FontLab Studio, 100% means that the area between the \"visual ascender\" and the
  \"visual descender\" fits within the current window. In Preferences / Glyph Window
  / Dimensions, you can set up the visual ascender and descender. By default, it\xE2\u20AC\u2122s
  100 and -40 % of the UPM size. If your glyph window is 700 pixels high, and the
  UPM size is 1000 units, then by default, the visual area that fits within the glyph
  window will be 1400 units (100% + 40% of the UPM size). So in the 100% view, each
  pixel represents 2 font units. In the 400% view, one font unit is represented by
  2 pixels. In the 1600%, one font unit is represented by 16 pixels. If you change
  the visual ascender and the visual descender to 5 and -2, then the 400% view will
  show each font unit on 30 pixels. I believe this would correspond to Fontographer\xE2\u20AC\u2122s
  3000% zoom. You can change the visual ascender and descender forth and back in Preference
  without any influence on your font data -- it\xE2\u20AC\u2122s just a screen scaling
  factor.'\r\n\r\nI am not finding this working in Fontlab 5.04 under Vista. What
  am I doing wrong? "

  body: "Adam, it's working. One may have to restart the program if a font was open
    at the time the change was made. Closing the font and re-opening it won't do it.
    Now that we've done that, is there any way to get the font window to look normal?
    \r\n\r\nIn addition, though I understand this to be a program reference only,
    I have heard -- not entirely verifiably -- of the settings being stored somehow
    in the font file and causing havoc when the font is opened on another machine."

    Also, you don't necessarily have to be as extreme as to use 5 and -2, maybe something
    like 20 and -8 would be acceptable for you. \r\n\r\n> the settings being stored
    somehow in the font file\r\n\r\nThe settings from Preferences (Options) are stored
    per user on the local machine. The settings in Font Info are stored in the font
    file. So no problem here. \r\n\r\nA."

  body: "Adam, I still think there may be some way that font databases store some
    of this information. For example, I have FLS 5.02 and 5.04 on my system. 5.04
    has the 5,-2 setting you originally suggested to me, while 5.02 has the default
    100,-40 setting. \r\n\r\nI am now editing in 5.02. If I open a font that was previously
    edited at 5,-2 in 5.04, it opens with the font window appearance and zoomability
    of the 5,-2 setting. But if I open another font file that wasn't edited and saved
    with this setting, I get the default appearance and zoomability. In other words,
    I have one program running, and am experiencing both behaviours.\r\n\r\nWhat gives? "

  body: John, in that session, there were probably four open fonts. Some were scaled
    big, some small, and that one mixed. Next time I opened the four fonts, they were
    all scaled big. Probably interesting things would begin to happen if I opened
    some new fonts. Adam says that the font DB cannot carry any of the relevant information,
    that it is a preference-only setting. So far the program <em>seems</em> to be
    behaving as if this is not true. (Try working in a scaled-up environment and then
    sending font DBs to users with default settings.) We must hope that the issue
    will be moot in a new release by expanded zoom, though I can't imagine why this
    can't be incorporated into a dot release sooner than that.

    <em>Somehow</em> this information is getting carried over into the font DB. Might
    there be a way of removing it? '
