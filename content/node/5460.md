  body: I would have been up for a carpool but I&#39;m gonna see some friends in Sacramento
    for a couple days on my way up to SF. Even if there is or isn&#39;t a SoCal-carpool
    we should at least all meet up once we&#39;re up there...it&#39;d be nice to know
    more local-ish typophiles.

  body: Jonathan, I can&#39;t help you with a ride as I am flying from Oregon, but
    I saw that JetBlue flies from Long Beach to Oakland for $122 RT, and United and
    Southwest are both $144RT from LAX to Oakland... $105 RT on Amtrak from LA to
    SF Union Square... for what it&#39;s worth! I know the bus is a bit cheaper, but...
    well... maybe someone else will chime in about a ride... what days are you planning
    to travel?
