  body: D'oh, nevermind. It's UnicalCaps. The beveling fooled me into thinking it
    was supposed to be a boney-looking face.

    in the legs and the serifs might be different but it is based on Lange's face.\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: "The face I have is called \"UnicalCapsLH,\" but to be honest I have no idea
    where it came from. Google doesn't turn it up, either. Sorry I can't be more helpful.

  body: "<a href=\"http://www.graphic-design.com/Type/medieval/humanist.html\">At
    graphic-design.com</a> it is said, that uncial caps is from Jack Davis. But I
    don't see any more information. Maybe the native speakers do. \r\n"

  body: "Yep, saw it. Do not recognize the face. The titling on the sight only shows
    a moderate nod to Solemnis. If you can afford it buy Solemnis, a beautiful synthesis
    of Roman and Uncial, then buy it. I find some of the structural weaknesses offensive
    but hey, that is purely subjective. The \"S\" is the worst offender. There are
    plenty of Uncials available, and one you might want to look at is Oxford by Arthur
    Baker. It is a bit different but holds to the style. It just has ascending characters.\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: Your font would seem to be rip-off of Letterhead's 1991 LHF Uncial Caps -
    which matches perfectly. It was a freebie from back when they used to give some
    of those away. I don't find it anywhere on Letterhead's website today.
