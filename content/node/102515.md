  body: "To be honest I'm the designer/programmer of Find my Font, therefore my opinion
    is biased ;)\r\n\r\nThat said, I believe is far more accurate than WhatTheFont
    and WhatFontIs web-sites, it finds also free fonts (WhatTheFont finds only what
    they sell, and usually not all of them). Find my Font can find fonts in both your
    computer and our online database at a speed of 5.000.000 fonts per minute (about
    10 secs for an ID), and you can ID a font directly from any color image (no special
    image pre-processing required).\r\n\r\nThe best way to find out is to download
    the 30-days-trial and see for yourself, the online database search is also enabled
    in the trial version.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nFivos"

  body: "thanks to be honest ;)\r\nI thought that it would cost a lot, but 39$ is
    not very expensive.\r\nI think I'll need this soft in the future so I'll buy it,
    no need of a 30 days trial :)\r\n\r\nThanks again for your help.\r\n\r\nPS : I
    tried WhatTheFont several times and this website never found anything !!! "
