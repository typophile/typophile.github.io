body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/marne-spec_4761.jpg]\r\n\r\nI wanted to
  post this for feedback before starting on the numerals and (possibly) a lowercase
  alphabet. It was somewhat difficult to balance a) blackness, b) extendedness, and
  c) a reversed stress, and some letterforms that might otherwise have shared a quasi-analogous
  construction, such as the X and Y, here do not. \r\n\r\nI'm going for a more fun,
  ultra-black vibe than anything mannered or historically reverent. "

    Y may need some more differentiation from what could be a V.
