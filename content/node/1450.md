  <BR> <BR>These are roughs for a company that makes rock walls for landscaping. <BR>The
  logo has to be horizontal to work within existing marketing materials. <BR>Which
  is you favorite, and what needs work?

  body: Although it might seem hoaky, I like the Preissig treatment. Consider Journal
    and Vendetta as well. <BR> <BR>My main worry though is the logo&#39;s horizontal
    expanse. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: One visual problem I&#39;m having with this is how many typefaces there are
    in this one logo. I&#39;m afraid that I would try to find a family that was both
    sans and serif, or sans with a smallcaps. Something that didn&#39;t clash too
    much with the one you apparently have to use. And I also agree that it seems very
    horizontal.

  body: Karl, I&#39;m sorry but your client is asking you to design a Blivit, you
    know 10lbs of s&#40;word&#41; in a 5lb bag. I think you should campaign to have
    the overall idenity be split from the brand name. Isn&#39;t the overall idenity
    somewhere else on the communication. The brand and its sub brand should stand
    alone. Thats my opinion, Dan
