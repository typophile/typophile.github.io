  so grateful.  It looks like something I've seen on T26 but I can't seem to track
  it down.  If you know the smaller sans serif font too, great.  \r\n\r\nI am working
  on some print material for this cafe, and the owner will not let me contact the
  \"friend\" that created this logo for her because she \"don't like 'em no more.\"[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jax_4931.jpg]"

  body: Yes, thank you, it is indeed Antique Olive Light... or I also found Incised
    901 Light which is pretty much the same.

  body: If i couldn't find the font, and ALL i needed it for was the logo, i would
    just draw the letters in Illy.

  body: "First, I think this logo might be custom designed.\r\n\r\nSecond, it's a
    bad idea to use the same typeface as in the logo for other design elements. It
    dilutes the logo and creates confusion."

  body: Wow. I just came on here for help with an id. Thanks for the lesson in design.
    That wasn't really what I meant, but decided that it would get a little long-winded
    if I explained exactly how I was going to implement the font. Let's just say it
    wasn't going to be an entire menu written in the jax font or anything.

    Didn't mean to lecture you, I was just thinking out loud.
