  am looking for a display typeface that...\r\n-is still legible \r\n-works on print
  and on the screen\r\n-has a generally classic / timeless look to it, so it doesn't
  look particularly \"old fashioned\" or like a new trend\r\n-has a bit of an outdoors
  feel to it, a little roughness as though it has not shaven, or it slept in the woods
  last night\r\nbut more subtly so than a face like Papyrus.\r\n\r\nIf you have any
  suggestions for my odd inquiry, I would really appreciate them. \r\nthanks for your
  time.\r\n\r\n"

    Serifa or maybe some more modern slabs like Stag or Apex Serif.

    steer clear of Papyrus!  If using it as reference makes me shudder. \r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\n\"Design

  body: "Thank you Chris and Tony for your suggestions. I like the idea of using a
    slab serif as it has a solid feel. \r\n\r\nTony I understand, I was just mentioning
    that typeface because I was also trying to get a suggestion for ones that had
    a little bit of a distressed look to them. Don't worry, I know to stay away from
    it as I see it everywhere. \r\n\r\n"
