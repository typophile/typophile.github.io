  in 2010, [[http://www.davidquaydesign.com|David Quay]] was asked by communication
  agency [[http://www.fwdesign.com/index.php|FWDesign]] to create a custom type family
  to be used as the new signage and orientation system of the City of Bath, he teamed
  up with [[http://www.re-type.com|ReType]].\r\nBath is a beautiful city to design
  for, and we were delighted to be involved in the project. The process was intensive,
  and demanded a well-documented research into local values, history, and vernacular
  lettering tradition. We didn\u2019t want a \u2018squarish\u2019 sans with a \u2018modern\u2019
  look, or indeed any \u2018neutral\u2019 type family. We wanted something a little
  more idiosyncratic, but rooted in the identity and tradition of the urban environment
  and its surroundings, rather than just appealing to our personal preferences. The
  new family had to be flexible enough to be employed in variable sizes, and to work
  harmoniously on the beautiful maps and orientation graphics devised by FWDesign.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bath-map_6737.png]\r\n\r\nOriginally,
  only a sans-serif was required, but during development, it became obvious that due
  to the system\u2019s complexity, more clear typographic hierarchies were required.
  Because our original sketches had fluctuated from serif to sans and vice-versa until
  we achieved a consistent and coherent family, it proved simple for us follow up
  with a serif version.\r\nBath type family comes in sans and serif versions, each
  with regular and bold weights. It displays strong vertical contrast and pronounced
  counters. Though it\u2019s not based on any existing or previous typeface, it does
  pay tribute to a group of alphabets and lettering models described as \u2018English
  Vernacular\u2018 by historian James Mosley, and characteristic of the Neoclassical
  period.\r\nThe Bath family is modern but not trendy, classic but not old, functional
  but not neutral. As with the city itself, the typeface is conscious of its own rich
  past, while eyeing the future.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.re-type.com|ReType Foundry]]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bath-specimen_5854.png]"

  body: Forgive my ignorance, but what exactly qualifies a typeface as "dutch"? When
    I think of "dutch" faces, what usually comes to my mind are modernist, geometric
    sans.

  body: That's a good question. When I see 'Dutch' I think of dark, moderately-contrasted,
    mannered, oldstyle bookish faces. Almost the opposite of Gerhard!

  body: "Being Dutch myself, hopefully I can shed some light on this. The Dutch are
    known to find new and elegant solutions for problems of all sorts, not only in
    the world of design. Over the years several Dutch typedesigners added their piece
    to 'Dutch type', such as flat shoulders (Unger), lively and calligraphically inspired
    (Noordzij, Smeijers, Ourtype), completely geometrical (Crouwel) and surely I've
    forgotten some. To me, 'Dutch design' is recognizable in it's concept. In the
    world of typography the Dutch have been at the start of many trends. I would even
    argue that the current 'back to personality, away from coldness' was set in motion
    by the types of Fred Smeijers, Gerrit Noordzij, Buivenga, Ourtype, Lucas de Groot
    and probably more. \r\n\r\nI guess what I'm trying to say is:\r\nDutch design
    cannot be recognized by certain characteristics. It's recognized by it's innovative
    and smart concepts.\r\n\r\nThe above might seem like a praisal to Dutch design
    from a dutchman, but it's not. IMO the ideas of Crouwel might have been revolutionary,
    but completely rediculous. Choosing absolute geometry over legibillity is completely
    pointless if you ask me. I admire the ideas of Smeijers and Bram de Does, but
    their works just lack esthetic perfection IMO. I could go on like this for a while..."

  body: This looks very English to me. The sans has some of the flavour of Gill Sans,
    that most English of sans serif types, and the slab serif is one of the key vernacular
    Victorian forms. What it doesn't look is particularly Bath-like. Bath is a Georgian
    city, not a Victorian one, and these types are lacking any obvious sympathy with
    Bath's <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/46284315@N03/4525538082/">justifiably
    famous street lettering</a>.
