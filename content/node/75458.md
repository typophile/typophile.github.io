  body: "Eli,\r\n\"Netsach\" is excellent. My wife thought the numerals were very
    good.\r\n\r\nAn interesting phenomena...   I REALLY liked the title  \u05E0\u05E6\u05D7\r\nset
    in Bold (or was it Extra Bold) and I liked the Text \r\n\u05E9\u05E9\u05D9\u05E8\u05EA
    \u05DE\u05D8\u05E8\u05D5\u05EA \u05D7\u05D9\u05E0\u05D5\u05DB\u05D9\u05D5\u05EA\r\nwhich
    was set in Medium (or maybe Bold).  I liked the Regular, but less.\r\nIn retrospect,
    I think that this is because as the type face is made heavier\r\nso the details
    become less visible and the basic underlying shape becomes \r\nmore dominant.
    \r\n\r\nA little critical point. I think the Zayin is not sufficiently distinguished
    from\r\nthe Vav. This is because the Vav is already rather ornate and so adding
    even more\r\nto the Zayin is difficult.\r\nMike\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Impressive. This has real charm, and a lovely rhythm. Congratulations! \r\n\r\nThe
    only character that I don't like is the shin, where the lower left space seems
    pinched. Also I wonder about some of the kerning, like on \"chayav\" and \"l'kayem\",
    where the final letter seems too far from the two yods.  "
