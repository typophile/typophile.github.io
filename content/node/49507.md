body: All I know is that it comes from a book printed in Venice, ca. 1694. The name
  of the book is Cicceide Legitima, by Francesco Lazzarelli. These are some pictures
  from pages of the third edition. Notice the unusual shape of the g in both roman
  and italic versions. Any help will be greatly appreciated. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/DSC04518_3952.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/DSC04525_6016.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/DSC04530_3716.JPG]

  body: "I went to my copy of Updike's \"Printing Types\" and looked at the sections
    on \"Italian Types 1500-1800\". He shows a type specimen from Rome in 1628 called
    \"Canon Grosso\" from the Stamperia Vaticana. This has the same G of your sample
    and other letters also seem consistent with your Roman sample. The type is named
    according to size, apparently, with \"Ascendonica\" being a similar typeface in
    a smaller size. The italic is called \"Corsivo Grosso\", but it does not match
    your samples. One thing Updike describes is how much of Italian printing during
    the 17th century mixes typefaces, using whatever is at hand, so perhaps this should
    not be surprising.\r\n\r\nI could not find a sample of an italic that matches
    yours. I notice that the italic 'g' varies quite a bit in your samples.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Well, that\u2019s quite a tricky one, and it\u2019s hard to say what your
    chances are to actually find out ...\r\n\r\nMy guess for the italic is:\r\nThis
    font is from poorly justified matrices (too much letter spacing/tracking and dancing
    baseline) from punches by Robert Granjon. \r\nSome letters like \u2018r, m, n,
    p, a, t, g, long s\u2019 share characteristics with Granjon\u2019s italics.\r\n(Some
    letters like \u2018z\u2019 look as if these were later additions/replacements.
    But then again, Granjon\u2019s italics were quite popular, and therefore often
    imitated, so probably it\u2019s not by Granjon at all.)\r\nIt\u2019s quite possible
    that the capitals of the italics are from a different font.\r\n\r\nMy advice:\r\nMeasure
    the fonts (caps height, x-height, measurement for 20 lines) and compare with Vervliet's
    article on Granjon (I hope you have access to a library with good typography books):\r\n\r\nH.
    D. L. Vervliet: \u2018The italics of Robert Granjon\u2019, \r\n   in: Typography
    Papers 3 (1998), pp 5\u201359\r\n\r\nAlso these two books are quite useful:\r\nJ.
    Dreyfus: Type specimen facsimiles I (1\u201315)\r\nH. D. L. Vervliet, H. Carter:
    Type specimen facsimiles II (16\u201318)\r\n\r\nGood luck."

  body: "This is how I started the revival. It's all wrong. I made way too many assumptions
    and did not even start using the actual proportions of the typeface.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/attempt1_6078.jpg]\r\nLater
    on, with the help of a teacher, (Erik van Blokland) I realized that I was making
    a mistake, a big one and started from scatch. I made a high resolution scan and
    superimposed from 6 to 9 prints of each letter. This helped me to find the maximum
    average surface of every letter, as if the ink spreaded out more or less evenly
    from the center of the ductus of the letters in the surface of the lead type.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/maximums_4344.jpg]\r\nThis
    exercise allowed me to understand the real proportions of the original typeface
    even if I didn't have any information regarding details such as shape of the serifs,
    etc. The next logical step was to start drawing with the information available
    but from the inside out, avoiding assumptions about the details and concentrating
    efforts on the proportions and the desired characteristics of the revival. The
    shapes derived from this exercise can certainly be far from the original but at
    least provided a solid ground for drawing.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/attempt2_3580.jpg]\r\nNew
    shapes emerged when trying to be respectful to the self-imposed limits. I borrowed
    some shapes typical from 15th and 16th century typefaces such as Adobe Garamond
    Pro to fill the \"empty spaces\".\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/attempt3_4396.jpg]\r\nNext
    step consisted on trying to simulate a texture with the few drawings available.
    The tool available at adhesiontext.com was a great help on this.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/textura_3745.jpg]\r\nNow
    I am trying to complete the lowercase set. Your feedback will be greatly appreciated.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/textura

  body: "What's your aim with this font? Your method leaves you with \"soft\" looking
    letters - you would get that with letterpressed ink spread of course, but in that
    case the physical impression also lends a sharpness that your font won't have.
    \r\n\r\nYour method has given you very solid proportions, though, it seems to
    me."
