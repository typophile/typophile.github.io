  in this poster:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://i43.tower.com/images/mm113641234/farm-factory-reinterpretation-soviet-industrial-revolution-robert-c-allen-paperback-cover-art.jpg\">Link
  to poster</a>\r\n\r\nI am looking for this or a similar font, I specially like the
  way it mixes the lower-case A with the rest of upper case characters. I actually
  prefer a quality paid font than an medium quality free font, as I need this for
  a logo design.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your help."

    Dunham forthead design\r\n(don't be confused with Vladimir Script which is a totally
    different font)\r\n\r\nA similar alternative you could modify by replacing /A
    with /a etc. is:\r\n<strong>[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/fb-agency/|Agency
