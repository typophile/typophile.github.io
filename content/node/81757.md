  which is a string quartet. I've been studying graphic design for a couple of years
  now but I feel like I've hardly dipped my toe into the world of type!\r\n\r\nBasically
  the quartets uniqueness comes from the amount of experience it has (over 25yrs)
  and the range of music it plays from \r\nclassical to pop and film soundtracks.
  I'm after a font which is nice and modern, but also has a feeling of experience
  and many years under its belt. Mostly playing for weddings, it has to fit into the
  classy image the couples are looking for.\r\n\r\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated\r\nJ"

  body: "Thanks Penn and Nick for your shouts, both interesting choices.\r\n\r\nAnd
    Thanks Andreas, I understand what you mean, but on this occasion the families
    happy for me to work on this for my portfolio.\r\nOr main competitors have logos,
    but none that I would say add any value, they look like they are part of web design
    packages rather than designed specifically, so I feel with some time, effort,
    and a good font choice I can do something that will stand out."

  body: Er, despite your two years of study to date, you omit any mention of the quartet's
    name or the letterforms on which the logotype will be based. Until those decisions
    are made, talk of typeface selection is speculative at best.
