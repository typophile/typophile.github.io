  a list of prohibited books that the Vatican used to publish. It started in 1559,
  my project is about the authors that were on this list. Does anyone know any Italian
  typefaces that were off that period or maybe a new typeface that was based on an
  older one?...i was thinking Bembo\r\n\r\nthank you"

  body: '1559 is late for the actual incunabula types on which Bembo is based, although
    type in this style continued in use in Italy for a long time. You should note
    however that publishing of the Index was not limited to Italy: editions were printed
    across Europe within a few years of the 1559 promulgation. I would consider using
    something in the Garamond style, which is contemporary with the first editions
    of the Index and evokes the counter-reformation period better than the earlier
    Italian types.'

  body: Something by Jonathan Barnbrook (Virus foundry) would also be appropriate,
    as his work addresses the issues of politics, power and religion.
