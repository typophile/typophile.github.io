  to be based around  1970's/80's Americana Truck aesthetics. Also with the possibility
  of having a slightly feminine feel to it as the project is based around two blonde,
  truck driving sisters. \r\n\r\nAny font recommendations would be great.\r\n\r\nThanks"

    have a look at Letterhead fonts... but I would hold off on purchases because he\u2019s
    charging people extra... long story.\r\n\r\nhttp://letterheadfonts.com/\r\n\r\nAs
    for Text:\r\n\r\nA Clarendon feels very American too me. But I\u2019ll let other
    people provide you with American feeling text fonts. \r\n\r\nMikey :-)"

    charging extra for that one font, not all of them, and the price is now back to
    normal.\r\n\r\nSharon"

    electron scope before any purchase, though. ;o)

    his prices seem normal now, so I will recommend this:\r\nhttp://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/stanfordscript.shtml"
