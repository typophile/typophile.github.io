  body: "There was a <a href=\"http://www.creativepro.com:80/story/feature/22368.html\"
    target=\"new\">survey made of 100 American newspapers</a> that I saw which catalogued
    typefaces used on the front pages. This is the closest I have seen to something
    that would answer your question, in a way. I know of nothing that does it for
    magazines, although I have considered it as a project. Any volunteers to help?
    Maybe we could start a list.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"

    newspapers.\r\nWe have been working on a magazine study that hoefully will be
    done early next year.\r\n"
