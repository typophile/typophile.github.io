<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I like to lurk around on these boards a lot, but this is my first actual post. Don't cringe, but I am actually a real estate agent who is infatuated with fonts & design.  I always laugh when I read a post about a design one of you has made for a real estate agent and the comments that follow, such as this from cuttlefish:
"Lots of real estate brokers want their portraits all over everything too. Majorly cringeworthy! The only people who should have headshots on their business cards are performers and prostitutes, IMHO."
I can't agree more! What's with that??? At any rate, I am working on designing a logo & would love to hear feedback.  This company is located in a very small town in the midwest. If you want a feel for the audience, I think an email I once receieved says it best: "you know you're from Wisconsin when...you think Madison is exotic." We're talking pretty conservative, very "inside the box" kind of thinking here.
I hope the final design will portray not only experience (by using a commonly known, not-new phrase for the name) but also that the company is tech-savvy & modern.  I hope it will feel fun without losing any professionalism. The logo will be used for cards, letterhead, etc as well as for yard signs. My original design was the blue/yellow, but I would love to incorporate one, maybe two, other colors just so we have some choices when it comes to web design and things like that. I used Myraid Pro because it always feels neat/clean/simple/uncluttered to me, but I am open for suggestions on any and/or all of it!
I hope it isn't taboo for me to post here since I am not a designer...maybe in my next life I'll be lucky enough to join your ranks!</div>

<div class=commentbody>At least you have a sense of humor…
Why don't you work this out in black and white and get the form the way you want it and then worry about the colors?
I think you will find that degree is going to suffer when this logo is shrunken down (think business card size).
You're off to a good start.
peace</div>

<div class=commentbody>You're off to a good start, but cut back to black-and-white for now. Also, be careful how you use the two circles; when they abut it can create some nasty visual problems. For example, in the second example the alignment of the little circle makes the area around it vibrate as it seems to warp the edges of the inner and outer circle. In the third example, because the circles are different colors, distracting little points are created where the circles abut.
Last, don't use red and green together. They're complementary colors and buzz against each other, which tends to irritate people.</div>

<div class=commentbody>The little circle is redundant and visually distracting.
It's a symbol we read -- unlike a comma, we actually say "degree" when a circle follows a number. Therefore, your company name reads "nth degree degree".
I say it needs to go.
The rest is getting better. I'm bothered by the shift in weights between the "n" and "th" -- the font sizes are too close for these two elements to have different stem weights, it looks odd. Try scaling down the "th" or scaling up the "n". Perhaps the "n" can drift out of the box like the circle does?
Just some thoughts. Overall, a great start for a non-designer design! Well done.</div>

<div class=commentbody>It might help to incorporate some "actual usage" examples into your design process.
Try it small, on a business card, and large, on a lawn sign, and see how it looks in the hand, or driving by.
That way you will be able to tell whether your combination of colors and type weights are working, and whether the design elements will scale nicely.</div>

<div class=commentbody>When I look at your second version, I read "N-O-T-H" rather than Nth Degree...That's just the order in which my eyes naturally read it, so I percieved the degree symbol as an O</div>

<div class=commentbody>First, I think you have overall good and effective design going and shouldn't stray if you like it, but I have to agree w/ the above. Take it back to mono/black & white. That way you can see the "design" element a little better. The large circle is nice, but the smaller degree symbol is distracting and is a bit confusing at first glance. I think the larger circle stands alone as representing the"degree" and I think is the strongest part of the design... Etc and so on , just keep tweeking the Nth part and maybe rethink the color scheme and you have a winner. Good luck.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I can't say thanks enough for the feedback.
I see what you mean about the stem weights of the "n" and the "th" and I also experimented with the "nth" being out of the box like the degree symbol...is this what you meant?
Sabre...any suggestions on a color scheme? My counterpart would have it primary red/blue/yellow if she had it her way - bleh. This was a bit of a compromise, as she is worried no one will see it driving down the street. I argue that people take a second look at something because they find it visually pleasing, and not because it might look bright.
By the way, the image you see here is the yard sign, 24x36.

<div class=commentbody>In the large version, I only see 'nth real estate', no degree (the circle becomes too big to be identifiable).
Also, a black and white version should be just that, black and white (nothing in between). It needs to be able to work at that low a level (think fax machine).
what if it was simple: nthº real estate
One problem you are running into is that 'th' should be superscript, but that conflicts with the º sign. What about enthº?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Why not try using another font that balances the superscript better? Also, I'm attaching 2 versions in B&W using Univers condensed - notice how the fonts appear "fatter" in white on black background? It's exactly the same size font. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/taketwo_4595.jpg]This is just one of the reasons I always work in B&W first; all logos end up black and white eventually - faxes, photocopies, newspapers - and I need to know if my logo will survive the plethora of office machines. Nobody wants to look fat, even a logo :)</div>
