  This year I've been invited to participate as an instructor at <a href=\"http://www.typecamp.org/\">Type
  Camp</a>. This opportunity is a return to something I Iove, teaching, and I get
  to do it with 2 people whom I greatly admire, [[Dr. Shelley Gruendler]] and [[Dyana
  Weissman]].\r\n\r\nType Camp is summer camp for type and typography enthusiasts.
  Talk about getting your cake and eating it too! I'm thinking of it as an intimate
  group of people who share a common passion. An opportunity for symbiotic discussion,
  learning, sharing, exploring, and experimentation. There is no set curriculum from
  year to year, but if you want to see what they did last year check out the <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/typecamp/pool/\">Type
  Camp Flickr Pool</a>. You can see from all of these photos that the experience goes
  far beyond just talking about serifs or collecting shells on the beach.\r\n\r\nType
  Camp takes place in one of the most beautiful places on earth, Galiano Island, BC,
  just off of the coast from Vancouver. \r\n\r\nRead Shelley's wonderful summation

  Camp: REACTION & CATALYST</a> to understand why Type Camp was created. \r\n\r\nDyana
  is just as excited to particpate as I am. Read her thoughts on the Font Bureau blog,

  body: It's the final year for Galiano Type Camp, folks, so this is your last chance!
    Sunsets and serifs, bald eagles and Bodoni, who could ask for more? It will be
    an all-Alphabetty teaching staff, too . . . .

  body: "What a great idea. I followed all the links and read Shelley's summation.
    I like the all-inclusive philosophy behind this. The list of instructors at typecamp.org
    is impressive to say the least Thanks for sharing the pics in the photo stream.\r\n\r\nA
    question for Shelly: you say this is the final year for Galiano Type Camp, does
    that mean this is the last type camp ever?\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

  body: Yes James, it looks to be the last Type Camp on Galiano ever, and for several
    reasons. The primary one is that the location where I have it on the island has
    raised their rates so drastically this year that I'm hoping just to break even
    and it will be close! In addition, it takes a lot of planning and effort (Marian
    and Ross and I were utterly exhausted after last year!) and I have to keep the
    prices low so that all kinds of people can attend. It's been a labour of love
    and as much as I'd like to see it fly, I don't know that I can anymore. I still
    think it is a deal at the price - all your locally sourced food, housing in swish
    cabins, afternoon hangouts at the beaches, and of course your days filled with
    high-level typetalk not found in many other places in the world. It's good stuff
    and last year's lot certainly loved it. So yes, that's it for Galiano. I had to
    cancel Info Design this year from a surprising lack of interest but I do hope
    to run India next year in December 2009.

  body: "Shelly I really hope you can get Type Camp going in another location. The
    low, low price is way too kind of you. Making it affordable is good, but make
    it worth the huge effort you and the other instructors put into it by charging
    a little more. Just a little bit more. I insist. Take care and I hope to meet
    you one fine day.\r\n\r\nSorry about the delayed reply, I lost track of this thread.\r\n\r\nj
