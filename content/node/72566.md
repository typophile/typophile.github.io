  body: "This typeface whas made by hand. There are no typefaces that really look
    like this because it doesn't look good. If you have a bigger picture you might
    wanna try entering a piece of it in What the Font: http://new.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/\r\n\r\nOtherwise,
    you're not gonna find anything. If it's just a small piece of text you need it
    for I suggest you draw a line in an almost horizontal direction in a photoshop
    and make a swash of it so you can draw these letters yourself."
