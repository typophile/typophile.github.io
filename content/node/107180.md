  Parallel Pen my girlfriend got me for my birthday. So far, I had prided myself on
  being a \"digital native\" as far as font design was concerned, finding it easier
  to play around with B\xE9ziers than with pen strokes. For this particular style,
  though, I found the natural constraints of broad-nib writing very helpful in quickly
  trying out different shapes and converging on a solution in an intuitive way.\r\n\r\nThe
  font is, of course, drawn entirely in Glyphs, and is much more regular than anything
  I could muster by hand. Still, I've made sure to soften the straight strokes a bit
  so as to avoid an overly mechanical look. The exuberant caps are inspired by Spencerian
  script.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Brilliance_5033.png]\r\n\r\nCheers"

  body: The small caps are actually what I find most interesting about your design.
    The rest is not bad, but not exactly mouth-watering to me. However, I am not a
    blackletter expert, so take my opinion with a grain of salt.

  body: "I agree that the small caps potentially add a lot of value. \r\n\r\nThere
    are some potential misreadings of letters but of course they mostly come from
    the blackletter tradition, so within that mode they might not register as problematic.
    I'm thinking of the /r/ and especially /c/ reading as an /e/, /X/ as /H/, perhaps
    /A/ as /U/.\r\n\r\nSecond (empty) counter of /W/ looks awkward to my eye. /Y/
    seems too wide. /z/ still feels mechanical. "

  body: "Thanks for the quick feedback! If you guys really think the small caps are
    worth it, I think I should spend some more time evening out the color and relaxing
    some of the awkward shapes (like the too-narrow {R} or the too-wide {E}).\r\n\r\n@
    R: I'm also not really an expert, but from what I've seen, most blackletters (especially
    Texturas, which I guess this qualifies as) tend to be very heavy.  Brilliance
    feels light and airy to me in comparison. In fact, I had been practicing some
    more traditional blackletter with my 3.8 mm and 2.4 mm Pilot Parallel Pens, and
    I discovered this particular style when I used the 2.4 to write at the glyph size
    at which I'd been writing with the 3.8 before.  I also like the texture that the
    caps create when several of them appear close together.  \r\n\r\n@ Craig: I can
    see the ambiguities you mention, but I agree that they're part of blackletter
    tradition, so I think I can get away with them. At least I'm not using the Fraktur
    {k}...  Good point about {W}. It just feels awkward to me, but I haven't found
    a better architecture for it so far. I can easily make {Y} narrower, too. Not
    sure how to make {z} more natural, though. Maybe I should return to the curved
    descender loop I originally had? I think I replaced it with the angular loop so
    it would fit in better with the other descenders."

    \r\nMaybe the \"link-like\" part in the middle can depart more freely from the
    hex-grid?"

    I just have to figure out a convenient way to prevent the {tz} ligature in composite
    words like Zeitzeugen when ligatures are on... do I need to add a non-breaking

  body: "Maybe adjust the ascender of /d/ so it doesn't come over to the left side
    so quickly at the mean line. Your /d/s wind up looking like /b/s. \r\nYour small-cap
    /Z/ is a structure that looks like it should descend--seems a little odd sitting
    on the baseline. Maybe a form with a bottom like the small-cap /L/ would be worth
    trying."

  body: "Good call on the {d}. I stretched out the ascender a bit more into the diagonal,
    and it does look more handsome now. I had to make a somewhat more reserved contextual
    alternate to avoid collisions with {f \u017F}, but that's no problem; I have a
    bunch of such alternates already in place for other letters.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/d_3893.png]\r\n\r\nAs
    for the SC {z}, I'm rather fond of the shape, and couldn't bring myself to move
    it from its default position. However, since an experiment with a flat-bottomed
    lunate {z} shape failed, I made a stylistic alternate in the shape of a Roman
    {Z}:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/z_4508.sc.png]\r\n\r\nOh, and
    this is what I made of the {W} problem...  still not exactly elegant, but better,
    IMHO (new version to the right):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/W_4231.png]\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the help!"
