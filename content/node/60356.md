  body: "I believe someone made this typeface, \r\nnot a foundry. You could check
    \r\nsomewhere like \"dafont\" or any online \r\ncollection of created typefaces.
    \r\nYou could probably download it\r\nit for free or create it yourself.  \r\nIt
    appears to have a stroke (outline) \r\nand a drop shadow of a similar color \r\nto
    the fill of the letterform. \r\n\r\nHope this helps!"
