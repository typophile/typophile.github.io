  but I'm needing a refresher and maybe I can give you a few new type [[foundries]]
  to look at as well.\r\n\r\nI am looking for those small, nitche market type foundries
  that have that charm and excellence. Everyone knows about the following:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typography.com\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fonts.com\r\n\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com\r\n\r\nBut
  I'm looking for more sites like this:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typetrust.com\r\n\r\nhttp://www.processtypefoundry.com\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ascendercorp.com/portfolio_commercial.html\r\n\r\nIf
  you guys have any type foundries you know of or just those one off fonts that someone
  has created and is selling, but is a high-quality font, I'd love to archive it.
  Thanks for all the help."

    it's a 'clever' horizontal-scrolling thing. \r\n\r\nKeep in mind there's no standard
    way type gets sold. Some foundries sell only direct, some use one, or all distributors,
    some are collectives only, and most prolific type designers have work available
    from different sources. See Josh Darden and Christian Schwartz; both have fonts
    available at Village, but not the same ones as on their own sites... My stuff
    is all available at fonts.com but only because of reseller arrangements. Each
    design is from a different foundry. It's complicated. \r\n\r\nA better idea might
    be to catalog the gems themselves, and put the availability information second.
    I agree, there are some gems that don't get as much press as they should. "

  body: "Sorry if this takes the thread off-topic somewhat, but I'm also looking around
    for foundries, to help me release a font I have in the queue. I had a nice email
    discussion with James Montalbano of <a href=\"http://terminaldesign.com\">terminaldesign</a>,
    and he recommended setting up shop for myself, but I'm still thinking that I need
    an outfit that's set up to handle the commerce and deal with the routine day-to-day
    interactions with customers.\r\n\r\nThe font I'm hoping to release is a highly
    faithful digitization of an metal face from the first half of the 20th century.
    In keeping with the exclusive spirit of the original face, I have decided to price
    it very high (say $500), so to my mind that rules out options like myfonts. Of
    course I don't expect to sell many licenses at that price, but that's ok. The
    goal is to make the face available to those who are passionate about using it.\r\n\r\nThe
    foundry from the list above that seems to fit my needs most closely is <a href=\"http://vllg.com/\">vllg</a>,
    but I sent in a query on their webform and it hasn't been returned. I don't know
    why not, but that's certainly not the experience I want customers to have.\r\n\r\nI'm
    not sure whether I need a foundry per se, or more of a shop. I haven't tried to
    get in touch with the people from Veer or FontShop, but perhaps that would be
    a way to take care of the customer service side of things while maintaining my
    own brand (I like the \"despotype\" suggestion of Hrant, and may indeed take that
    up).\r\n\r\nIf you are the foundry I seek, feel free to get in touch. Any other
    ideas and suggestions are welcome."

    need to incorporate, set up a website if only to show your work, and then join
    as many dealers as possible, starting with FontShop and MyFonts, where everybody
    surfs. But not if you insist on pricing that high--nobody will take you on, and
    why should they? The market is now flooded with inventive, quality fonts at affordable
    prices, though not as affordable as I would like. Fonts should be priced like
    paperback books, not bone china.

    typeface and the development of future typefaces. Like novels or albums, typefaces
    take months or years to create, and there is no guarantee that a typeface will
    sell enough to subsidise its creation. But a successful typeface will fund the
    design of other types, as well as (hopefully) paying rent, and in our case, server
    hosting, merchant bank fees, advertising, promotion...\r\n\r\nSome foundries and
    distributors believe in quantity over quality: release enough stuff and some of
    it is bound to sell. Others, including Village, believe that quality is more important
    than quantity, and we know that our clientele continues to visit us due to the
    quality of the offerings from our small group.\r\n\r\nWith many apologies for

    Da Vinci Code) are recent works, the best selling fonts are old. Peyton Place,
    a work of similar vintage to Helvetica, ain't read much no more. If users stopped
    buying the old stuff, and if certain parties stopped bundling free fonts, then
    perhaps there would be a mass market for new fonts which would enable indie foundries
    to sell in sufficient quantity to lower their prices.\r\n\r\nSo, enjoy your classics
    and your bundled beauties, but please don't winge about font prices.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    the price of most bestselling fonts at Myfonts is $12 - $25, which is actually
    quite comparable to paperbacks."

    remain unknown and your fonts unused--is that the best payoff for your development
    efforts? Perfect example: Rialto, a three-font family that represents the finest
    Renaissance interpretation on the market today, comes from European designers
    with no website yet, and costs 580 euros via snail mail, so of course its progress
    in the marketplace is obstructed and slowed. With lower prices and better consumer
    access, they can compete with, say, Josh Darden, who offers Corundum, 12 fonts
    for $189, a really distinguished effort, among others on his site.\r\n\r\nRegular
    half price sales, like DSType is now offering, are a great boon to us freelancers

    There was a boombox in the back making up for no radio. I think it would have
    been less memorable in a Ferrari.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
