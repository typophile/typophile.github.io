    but couldn't find an exact match. However, there are many very similar fonts in
    the [[http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=605&page=3&nb_ppp=50&text=INTEGRITY|Script>Trash
    category at Dafont]]. (I picked a page that has several that I think are quite
    similar. See what you think.)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
