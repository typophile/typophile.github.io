    Good luck!'

    revival, rather than an original by a living designer working in an historical
    genre, derived from various lettering sources.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of distressed
    fonts, such as the very successful Veneer, closely modelled on old typefaces,
    so this practice is otherwise quite acceptable\u2014as long as it is done from
    scans, rather than by \u201Cpoint piracy\u201D."

  body: I  note that Newport Land by URW has some of the distinctive features of Gloria.
    But if one wants to rip off a typeface that embodies the features of a certain
    style of lettering... one should have picked on [[http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/mostra.html|Mostra]]
    instead.

    take a few hours for our records to update.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of other readers
    with similar complaints, it's our policy that any font is taken off sale immediately
    while we resolve the dispute, so just get in touch with us \u2013 we'll always
    listen.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nAnthony"

  body: "Reminds me of this:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/93171\r\nIn the end they
    arrived at some mutually-satisfactory agreement. On the other hand -unlike with
    Veneer and Wisdom Script- Duce possibly adds <em>nothing</em> of value so is not
    worth cutting any slack for. I'm not counting the cheesy Photoshop-redundant distressing
    effect.\r\n\r\nCharles, I assume Gloria is not closely based on any pre-existing
    design?\r\n\r\nBTW:\r\n- This is one great reason to be on MyFonts: if you're
    with them they're much more likely to honor your take-down requests. It also makes
    it much easier to get some/all of the money from sales of the offending font.\r\n-
    Much of the work from Machalski/Borutta seems to suffer from the same sort of
    plagiarism. In fact the numerals in Duce look like they're swiped from Futura.
    Assuming there is that much plagiarism, MyFonts should definitely dump him/them,
    and try to figure out how to get any proceeds into the right hands.\r\n\r\nRelated:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/56010\r\n\r\nNew
    idea: If MyFonts can't get any money back from a dishonorable foundry they should
    ideally confiscate the fonts and keep selling them, giving the money to the right
    people, or at least a good cause, like TypeSnitch. Legally however that's probably
    not workable (and you most probably can't put clauses like that in the contract)
    so realistically the offended parties will have to deal with the offenders directly.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Nick, I have the greatest respect for you too, but let me clarify.\r\nI saw
    a beautiful picture posted here on typophile years ago. I tried to find it in
    the search bar to show what I was talking about but it did not come up with anything
    :( Anyways It showed a dimensional lettered sign that said \"GLORIA\" I thought
    that would make a cool font so I made my version of it. Its not a revival. I drew
    the letters. BTW if you place my letters on top of the photo it will be different
    as I did not trace the letters. In other words I made the font myself. Being a
    lettering artist has its advantages :)\r\nWhat this guy did was he went to Letterhead
    fonts and printed out the sample page. There are no numbers or punctuation on
    the sample at LHF. He then took Futuras numbers and made a font out of it. That
    is pretty low in my book. Now, if I  found this in a specimen sheet from the 30's
    or 40's I would think it would be free reign, but since I drew the letters myself
    I find it to be theft. Nick, you may think otherwise but to each his own. \r\n@Nick
    Shinn, you nailed it!\r\n"

    used Mostra as his basis, the name for the face would have been more appropriate,
    since that face was definitely based on posters of the appropriate period and
    location: of course, doing more research might have made it possible to do something
    original."
