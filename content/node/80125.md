  that there are many great fonts come from Germany.\r\nSo, i know that there must
  be some great museums/gallery's that i need to visit about typography.\r\nAlso great
  graphic design museums/gallery's are welcome.\r\nPlus if you know a great street
  where many gallery's are that needs to be visit, let me know!\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nBrown\r\n"
