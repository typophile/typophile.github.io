  body: Not "Grotesque," because that really refers to a specific range of sans styles,
    which this typeface doesn't fit into.

  body: "I think Contrast is your best bet. The others are too ambiguous. Stress is
    accurate but has a negative connotation for those many who don't know the typographic
    term.\r\n\r\nYour 'S' is leaning backward, btw."

  body: "Good comments. I considered \"Stress,\" \"Stressed\" or \"Stressed Sans,\"
    but I want to avoid the word. Currently going with contrast.\r\n\r\nI made some
    adjustments; mostly subtle, but the K and R are perhaps the most visibly changed.
    I balanced the 's' and adjusted some letter widths.  I am working on the kerning;
    here is what I have so far. I'd appreciate comments on the kerning and spacing
    in particular as I feel  I am not so great at it. Also, it seems more difficult
    or less forgiving with extended faces.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Aviano-Contrast-Sample-Page-Source3_3943.png]\r\n\r\nKerning/Spacing

    imbalanced? Let me know. It looks fine to me, but if you can point out why you
    feel it is imbalanced, please do so. I did make a few minor adjustments to it.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Aviano-Contrast-Sample-Page-Source_5165.png] "
