body: "These signs have been produced from the 1930s onwards, or were at least most
  active in the 30s. Seen throughout the state of New York. There are two faces present.
  The larger one being a bit more unusual than the smaller face \u2013 note the somewhat
  odd shape of the 'O' and the 'U' in 'Hudson'. News Gothic seems like a close but
  not perfect match for the smaller face \u2013 but that's as close as I'm getting
  to figuring it out.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/henryhudson_6324.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/800px-New_York_State_historic_marker_-_Site_of_First_School_Oran_4112.JPG]"
