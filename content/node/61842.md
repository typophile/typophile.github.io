  typeface is due to be released on September 15, 2009. So until then we've done a
  little promotional trailer for you available at:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Ml2n_jfSk\r\n\r\nInspired
  by the typeface Windsor, designed by Eleisha Pechey in 1905. Windsor is the typeface
  used in the titles of many Woody Allen movies. A modern interpretation of this rusty
  pearl is something that always have been missing in the major type libraries. But
  Heroine is not only an interpretation, it goes beyond that. With the addition of
  swashes and alternate letters in several styles it becomes very addicitve.\r\n\r\nMore
  images here:\r\nhttp://www.fountaintype.com/news/2009/09/heroine-movie-trailer\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy!"
