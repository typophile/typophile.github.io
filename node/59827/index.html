  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>So I just saw this blog entry on the new fonts in Windows 7 [[http://blogs.msdn.com/e7/archive/2009/07/07/engineering-windows-7-for-a-global-market.aspx]], and in it they have a new Devanagari family called &lsquo;Aparajita&rsquo;. It looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/image_9_5610.png" alt=""></p>
<p>When I saw this latinized (is it not?) design, this came to mind:</p>

<p>What do you think? Is Aparajita latinized, and if it is, does that matter?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I can&rsquo;t say whether or not the typeface is &ldquo;latinized.&rdquo; It <em>does</em> have serifs on it, and it has a stroke contrast that doesn&rsquo;t strike me as one common in traditional examples of writing in the Devanagari script.</p>
<p>However, I can say that in India, there are <strong>a whole lot</strong> of examples of contemporary display lettering and display typography including Devanagari letterforms that:
– have serifs
– and/or have a stroke contrast that isn&rsquo;t traditional</p>
<p>I doubt that anyone expects Aparajita to be used as a text face in the way that e.g., most of the ClearType collection of Latin faces from a few years back would be used as text faces. As a display face, it might be the right note for certain compositions. In the sample you show above, Claus, there are a few things happening above the headline that I think should be done a little differently. I am going to leave my comments at that, though ;-)</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t go so far as to compare it with Romulus Greek, though. Romulus Greek is an exercise in the naiv… it really was intended as a text face, if I have my history correct (I am not the biggest JvK-fan…). Seeing as there are already plenty of other things that remind me of Aparajita, I don&rsquo;t think the oddity found in Romulus Greek applies. But you never know with typographers, calligraphers, artists, and professors. Maybe somewhere, some writing expert is smiling at this post in that familiar Gerry Leonidas way…</p>

<p>This is quite a strange design though. There is a precedent for this style of design, there are several others in this genre already used/available. However, one would hope/assume that the Microsoft versions will be better drawn and engineered with complete character sets.</p>
<p>Dan is right: there are some really weird things going on with the character shapes. I don&rsquo;t understand some of the decisions made and why it is so consistently inconsistent. At least it will be easily ID-able once it starts popping up in everyone&rsquo;s logos :P</p>
<p>The sloped italics are also unfortunate, especially with the vowel marks that aren&rsquo;t aligned properly in the regular italic (the bold ones are better).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Actually the serifs aren&rsquo;t the most striking thing to me. The &ldquo;modern&rdquo; contrast is unorthodox, and a little amusing, but not unprecedented. &ldquo;Latinized&rdquo;? Okay, maybe. I certainly see what you mean.</p>
<p>What strikes my eyes most, however, (but now, I&rsquo;m not a native user) is some of the seemingly oversized forms. Seems to me like the Indic equivalent of a huge x-height. I mean, look at that full-figured <em>ka</em>, the <em>ca</em> almost hitting the roof, and the honking loop on the <em>na</em>. I find the angled stroke ending on the <em>ta</em> also a little odd.</p>
<p>But really, who cares what I [we] think? I suppose the proof in the pudding will be how the intended audience of Devanagari users responds.</p>

<p>Indeed. It would be very interesting to hear a point of view from a native user of Devanagari about this design. I&rsquo;m very interested to hear about the inspiration / tradition / roots for the serifs and modulation/contrast in this design.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi! Just wanted to chime-in and say that I&rsquo;m pretty sure the typeface isn&rsquo;t new, and wasn&rsquo;t developed by Microsoft, in case heads start butting! (Feel free to challenge this assumption!)</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/font.aspx?FMID=1700">http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/font.aspx?FMID=1700</a> - Aparajita, developed in 2001 by Modular Infotech</li>
<li><a href="http://www.modular-infotech.com/html/otf.html">http://www.modular-infotech.com/html/otf.html</a> - Modular Infotech&rsquo;s font catalog. If you click on the Devanagari pdf, I believe Aparajita is samples 0710, 0711, and 0712.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, I have a feeling that it was designed by Karambir Singh Rohilla (if annyone wants to try to track him down and ask him).</p>
<p>Yeah, I have seen a myriad of serifed Indic fonts&hellip; not sure when that trend started to happen. I personally have never liked them much, and they of course historically make no sense, in terms of the development of the script. This one in particular I just find really hard to read - did they HAVE to choose it, out of all Devanagari display faces? Sigh.</p>
<p>** edit - Also just wanted to say that this font has been used quite a bit in India by now and wasn&rsquo;t hidden from the public or anything.</p>
<p>** edit edit - heh.. heh&hellip;. links might work now.</p>

I think that some of the &ldquo;x-height&rdquo; bigness that you mention is ok. It all depends on the size the type is set at! You see this kind of treatment often in display type and lettering. Newspaper headlines come to my mind… (but I look at a lot of newspapers). Some of the difference is like the difference between book hands being written out with a pen, and larger sign lettering being painted with a brush.</p>
<p>So for a text face, a big round ka like that is probably going to be a no no. But in a display face (that is really going to be used at display sizes…), I think that it can be appropriate. Again, it depends on the usage, just like any sort of typography.</p>
<p>@Erin
Welcome to Typophile!
Good work tracking down Aparajita&rsquo;s info. It is worth noting that most MS faces were not developed by Microsoft, but licensed by Microsoft from designers and/or foundries. Just look at a list of all the latin fonts bundled with Windows!</p>

I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re right; context makes a difference.</p>
<p>My perspective is from my years of learning Sanskrit. Plus, my temperament is naturally classicist.</p>
<p>But Western type design is all over the map; why not Devanagari? Who are we to deny them their pluralism? Maybe Aparajita can become the Hindi Hobo.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I am sure it was a decision of someone who cannot read, or understand Hindi properly. Such designs can only appeal to people who never bothered to read, or make meaning out of it. It may look interesting from a foreigners point-of-view, but it&rsquo;s not legible at all - nor in text, neither on the display sizes. There is no visual consistency in the forms, and skeleton.</p>
<p>To me, it&rsquo;s an ugly design with a weird set of proportions. It&rsquo;s not even refined properly. I am wondering how the complex conjuncts will appear in this design, e.g. in <cite>MRa</cite> or <cite>MNa</cite>?  Just analyze the provided sample only; the <cite>MatraI&rsquo;s</cite> are not coming properly, the <cite>Anusvara</cite> is too small and going slightly off on the letter <cite>Sa</cite> in regular italic (also the <cite>Reph</cite> on <cite>Ma</cite> too), the <cite>MatraE</cite> on <cite>Ka</cite> is not centrally aligned (neither in upright nor in the italic version), joinery in letter <cite>Sa</cite> is detached in Bold version whereas it&rsquo;s connected in the regular version. The letter <cite>Na</cite> looks weak in bold version compared to its neighbors. All the matra&rsquo;s are detached from the <cite>Shirorekha</cite> (Headline), and it&rsquo;s in the middle of nowhere. Also, I have a feeling that the bold and italic versions are automated. These are a few errors I noticed in this sample specific, but am sure I can point-out more if I see the complete character set. I have seen this typeface being used locally and never liked it.</p>
<p>As a universal note, when we read Devanagari, the <cite>Shirorekha</cite> (Headline) serves as a visual guideline like the Serifs do in Latin. But here with both these styles together, it breaks the consistency somehow and makes it less legible. Historically also, these designs says nothing about the development of Devanagari.</p>
<p>And yes, as someone said, it&rsquo;s not a new design. A lot of companies in India, including C-DAC, Modular Infotech, Summit Infotech, and  etcetera have been selling it with a different name since long. And now am seeing it with a new name, Aparajita. Well done, Microsoft! Keep it up! ;-)</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>Btw, Aparajita in Hindi (usually a girl&rsquo;s name) means, the undefeated.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Modular fonts are mostly rip-offs from C-DAC designs or crude original designs which are unusable. The very fact that Microsoft has chosen to outsource fonts from them speaks volumes about their quality consciousness. The way they churn them out with numbers as names reminds one of the Humanist777s, Swiss555s and likes that plagues Roman typography even now.</p>
<p>No wonder despite Windows being availbale in many Indian languages, it hasn&rsquo;t caught on with the publishing industry who still prefer custom fonts.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I guess I missed it too. Aparajita is actually one of several Indic fonts that were licensed from Modular and developed for Office some time ago and were added to the OS in the Windows 7 time frame to provide additional variety of Indic fonts for the platform. To be honest I&rsquo;ve not heard any direct criticism of this design from native speakers and if anything it seems to be one of the preferred Devanagari fonts out there. However, as always if there are improvements that can be made to the design we can take a look, but as for now &ldquo;undefeated&rdquo; seems like an appropriate name. :-)</p>
<p>Cheers, Si</p>
