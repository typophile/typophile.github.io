body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Foundries]] : D. Stempel AG</strong>\r\n\r\nDavid Stempel
  (1869-1927) founded the foundry on January 15 1895 at Frankfurt am Main.\r\n\r\nThe
  foundry fast became one of the biggest German foundries. Shares of other foundries
  were bought, so the resources constandly grew.\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of
  just a few of the designers who worked with Stempel:\r\n[[Hans Bohn]]\r\n[[Warren
  Chappell]]\r\n[[F. H. Ehmcke]]\r\n[[Friedrich Heinrichsen]]\r\n[[Hanns Th. Hoyer]],\r\n[[F.
  W. Kleukens]]\r\n[[Erich Meyer]]\r\n[[Hans M\xF6hring]]\r\n[[Hiero Rhode]]\r\n[[Wilhelm
  Schwerdtner]]\r\n[[Herbert Thannhaeuser]]\r\n[[Martin Wilke]]\r\n[[Rudolf Wolf]]
  \r\n[[Hermann Zapf]]\r\n[[Gudrun Zapf von Hesse]] \r\n\r\nIn the early 1900s, Stempel
  developed an exclusive relationship with Linotype, becoming one of just a few producers
  of matrices for the [[Linotype Machine]] worldwide. In 1985, Stempel became part
  of the German Linotype AG corporation. In essence, the design department of D Stempel
  AG would go on to become the in-house design team of Linotype AG and the later Linotype-Hell
  AG. When Linotype-Hell AG was purchased by [[Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG]] in
  the 1990s, many former Stempel employees would go on to work for [[Linotype Library]].\r\n\r\nMore
