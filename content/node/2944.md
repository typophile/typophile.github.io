  body: I don&#39;t know what it is, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s Mekanik. They
    spelled Espresso with an x, so it makes me think it&#39;s a free font. ;-&#41;

    <BR> <BR>Heh--sorry. I didn&#39;t realize it was from Brazil. That&#39;s the way
    people often misspell Espresso in English. <BR> <BR>Mike, you make a good case,
    and it&#39;s very close, but I still don&#39;t think that&#39;s it. When you squooshed
    Mekanik, it also made the horizontals proportionally too thin.
