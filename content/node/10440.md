    will be ready to ship in August 2006.</strong> May angry Typophiles strike me
    repeatedly with a pica pole if I am wrong again, but this time I have the existence
    of <em>actual press proofs</em> to back up my estimate.\r\n\r\nI'm hoping to have
    a few copies to show off at <a href=\"http://www.typecon.com\">TypeCon</a>. For
    the rest of you unlucky souls who will not be attendance, watch the <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fontfeed\">FontFeed</a>
    for updates as the shipping date draws near. We'll be describing there some of
    the changes and improvements in this edition. There are many."

    easily correctable) it's an amazing, and needed, effort. Kudos.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    I'm an avid supporter of the IndieFonts Books -- they're simply great in that
    they present the typefaces by foundry, which allows you to taste the specific
    style of each one of those foundries. Nevertheless there <em>is</em> a reason
    why they nicknamed the FontBook <em>The Bible</em>."
