body: "i am currently designing a logo/ID for myself. i already have a base of a logo
  under a different name but i wanted to try something insorporating my name. \r\n\r\ni
  have been trying for weeks to create a ambigram piece that i like, but have not
  yet come up with something i have grown fond of. i have experimented with different
  fonts but all i seem to be doing is creating more things that im not too keen on.\r\n\r\ni
  was hoping someone could help me to create something that is fluid and easy to work
  out, yet still have a sense of modern design. i am willing to use and fonts/styles.\r\n\r\ni'll
  start with a blue peter moment, here is one i made earlier:\r\n\r\nps. the name
  i am using is LOWE."

  body: Some words are just very difficult to make into an ambigram.  If you are set
    on the idea, I would start with a lot of sketching, and work out some ideas of
    how each letter will transform into the other, and what style will both enable
    readability and communicate the right brand themes.  What you have now feels very
    rigid and is almost entirely unreadable.  Have you explored something more script
    based?  And maybe try a reflected ambigram rather than a rotational one?  Hope
    that helps!

  body: thanks. yes i have tried with other fonts like calligrpahic and serif fonts
    but the transition between the o and w is quite hard for me to produce. i will
    try and add some sketches i have done to show my preliminary ideas, but like i
    said i am willing to use a range of fonts. many thanks for your help.
