  body: I like it a lot. The R looks like it might have to rely on context to identify
    it.

  body: It&#39;s definitely a pretty neat looking face. I was scrolling and I read
    &#39;Fax&#39; instead of &#39;Fox&#39; and then when I looked at the alphabet
    it was still the case. The lc o just seems like an a to me. The uc O doesn&#39;t
    seem to do this. <BR> <BR>I agree with John about the R. I read BOOS instead of
    ROOS even though I knew the name. I like the Q&#39;s internal tail. That&#39;s
    pretty cool. U feels like it&#39;s about to shut tight as does N. <BR> <BR>Looking
    good though. <BR> <BR>Jon

  body: Wow. This is very pretty. Very cool. No idea what I&#39;d ever do with it,
    but it immediately has an old world flavor with a new skool / post modern twist.
    <BR> <BR>Good luck with the figures. =&#41;

  body: Looks to me that it would be best in large sizes. As it gets smaller, legibility
    diminishes. Plus, you have so much wonderful detail that would get grayed out
    at small sizes. Good luck!

  body: I like it, congratulations! <BR> <BR>I feel that &#34;K&#34; and &#34;k&#34;
    are confused, maybe they can be read as H or h. <BR> <BR>R looks like B <BR>and
    Z looks like a 2 <BR> <BR>well thats my opinion

  body: The revised k is a great improvement, but the upper, hooked stroke may still
    be a little too dark.
