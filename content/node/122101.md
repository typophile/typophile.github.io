body: "A new version of DTL OTMaster (OTM), the highly sophisticated tool for reviewing,
  editing, and altering tables and glyphs of fonts with a SFNT-\uFB01le structure,
  has become available since today. OTM is a must-have for professional font developers.
  To quote Adam Twardoch, product and marketing manager at Fontlab Ltd.: \u2018<em>OTMaster
  works with surgical precision: it will only modify the portions of the font that
  the developer wishes, leaving all other structures unchanged. This makes OTMaster
  a great companion to any font editor and an indespensable element even in the most
  complex OpenType font production work\uFB02ow.</em>\u2019\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OTM_5_illu_1_5180.jpg]\r\n\r\nVersion
  5.0 contains a range of additional functionality, among which:\r\n\r\n\u2014 New
  powerful <em>Text Viewer</em>, which includes Harfbuzz for the interpretation of
  OpenType Layout features. It contains a nice three-state features selector (on /
  default / off).\r\n\u2014 Support for all the competing color OpenType font extensions:
  Microsoft\u2019s \u2018COLR\u2019/\u2018CPAL\u2019, Adobe\u2019s \u2018SVG\u2019,
  Apple\u2019s \u2018sbix\u2019, and Google\u2019s \u2018CBDT\u2019/\u2018CBLC\u2019.\r\n\u2014
  Updated <em>Font Viewer</em>, containing now a search \uFB01eld for glyphs, unicodes...\r\n\u2014
  Updated <em>Side by Side Viewer</em>, which contains among other new options, a
  \u2018Winding \uFB01ll\u2019 as opposed to the standard \uFB01ll option.\r\n\u2014
  Enhanced and now fully mature <em>Glyph Editor</em> (basically a compact version
  of DTL FontMaster), with improved guideline and grid functionality, improved measurement
  options, new clipboard with support for multiple entries, etcetera, etcetera.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OTM_5_illu_2_6342.jpg]\r\n\r\nDTL
  OTMaster 5.0 is available for Mac OS X, Windows and Linux. Please note that because
  of the inclusion of Harfbuzz the lowest supported Mac OS X version is Lion (instead
  of Snow Leopard in case of version 3.7) now.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OTM_5_illu_3_3571.jpg]\r\n\r\nFrom
  today on until the 6th of January 2015, OTM 5.0 can be purchased with a special
  25% <em>Christmas-holiday</em> discount. Current 3.7 licensees are eligible for
  an upgrade against \u20AC 7.50 administration and handling costs. FontLab Ltd. customers
