<p>Thanks for the reply. Maybe I&rsquo;m not able to see the forest for the trees here. I get that the sidebearings need to be tighter on the o&rsquo;s versus the n&rsquo;s. Let&rsquo;s say you have an outlined font in Illustrator, a single word: volume (see previous post image). Now I&rsquo;ve captured the proportional area between the letters and I want to apply the &ldquo;pillars&rdquo;. What is the procedure? Take for example the V and the O in VOLUME. Where do you draw the lines for allocating the pillar space?</p>
<p>Perhaps it is the serifs that are throwing me off&hellip;</p>

If I had the time I could make an illustration, but maybe this helps: in a container oil will be higher nearest to the walls and deeper in the middle. Start from there… : )</div>

<p>If you want to do a font, you need font production software, which enables you to set sidebearings and generate a font.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What  you are going for is <em>visually</em> equal, which means that it is not a precise geometry. Also you can&rsquo;t achieve it strictly, as in the case of the vo, or for example LA. In a font, as opposed to a drawing, sidebearings and kerning have a different definition. Sidebearings apply always, kerning are special exceptions like VA, or your vo.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Such is the beauty of type design&hellip;</p>
<p>My interest is predominantly based in logotype design. I like to customize outlined font glyph&rsquo;s in Illustrator and I always run into a wall with sidebearings and proper spacing.  I&rsquo;ve read up on all the books and scoured the internet for answers, but all I seem to come up with is the need to &ldquo;train your eye&rdquo;. I also tried turning fonts upside down and several other suggestions to no real avail. Sure, I get a result, but it is so subjective.</p>
<p>The Law of Optical Spacing seemed really promising because my interpretation was that there was a mathematical way to approach the issue.</p>
<p>Bert, your explanation makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>William, thanks again for your insights. I wish there was a more precise geometric method for achieving the desired result.</p>
<p>It seems  somewhat archaic to subjectively decide on what is visually equal. Glyphs have a certain ascender height, descender height, x-height, etc. Typically, these values are interlocked or repeated through a logotype or font depending on the letters. The one element of type design that seems the most &ldquo;artsy&rdquo; is the spacing and kerning, but perhaps that is what makes it human. It is still such a mystery&hellip;</p>

<p>But when you think about it, you&rsquo;re designing the spaces as well as the interior of the glyphs and the curves and strokes. So it&rsquo;s not totally surprising that there&rsquo;s no formula. And if you think about a character like a c or v, the question of how much of the &lsquo;open&rsquo; part to count in the between-letter space, and how much to count as part of the letter isn&rsquo;t clear, and may vary with the neighbor&hellip;</p>

<p>With regard to Kindersley:</p>

<p>The problem is that it never worked automatically. In particular I remember that a problem they never cracked was applying a single formula to both round and straight letters, and getting results that met the demands of Kindersley&rsquo;s eye. So that decision had to be imposed by human intervention. And it is a key one, and as came up in a recent thread, also varies by optical size of the letters (the visual angles spanned by a letter).</p>
<p>I still think the idea of &lsquo;optical centre&rsquo; is a useful concept, but setting the overall advance width his theory never cracked successfully.</p>
<p>His effort is one of the more interesting ones, but ultimately like all the others not fully successful.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>To quote myself (at least) &ldquo;remember, what we read are clumps of words, not pairs of letters.&rdquo; In fact, depending on whatever other letters lie next to a pair, the optimum value with that pair will change, when considered in context. If you do not have contextual kerning, you should probably limit your kerning to the worst situation &ndash; the &ldquo;first, do no harm&rdquo; aspect of design &amp; composition.</p>
<p>In my view, proper letterfit &amp; kerning is what helps us take in word boundaries without paying attention to them. The more distinct these are, the tighter the word spacing can be, if one so chooses. Letterfit is one key factor in effective word spacing.</p>
<p>And by the way, the better the word boundaries, that is, ones that don&rsquo;t call attention to themselves by being too close or too loose,  the more leading choices that will work.</p>
<p>Try setting some type. For text, try esp. (approximately) a 10/13 and a 10/15 setting for a full page. If you can get both to look good, you&rsquo;re onto something.</p>
