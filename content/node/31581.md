  most efficient way for me to browse through them (see what they look like) WITHOUT
  installing them.  I'm sure this is a stupid question but i'm new to this.\r\n\r\n...right
  now i've been going from folder to folder, doubleclicking and viewing each single
  font in FONT BOOK... i could be here forever...\r\n\r\nany insight would be much
  appreciated.\r\n"
