  body: If there is one font family that I want, it's Gotham. I know that it's moving
    into the realm of overuse, but it's just so PRETTY.

    worth it, if you like the design, is [[http://www.philsfonts.com/showing.html?sku=LF000150X1P1&start=1|Thesis
    Basic]]. 48 typefaces. It includes The Sans, The Mix and The Serif in weights
    from Extra Light to Black for $520."

  body: I was just about to suggest Thesis. But my reasoning was that I'd have someone
    else get me a huge family so I didn't have to pay for it.

    i've been a good girl this year.  We'll see!\r\n\r\nAny other suggestions?"

  body: "Personally, I'd rather have a puppy than a font family as a christmas present.
    If I were to wish for a font for Christmas, it would probably be a font that does
    not exist (or publicly exist) yet, like the italics for Tom Phinney's Hypatia
    Sans Pro!\r\n\r\nBut since fonts last for life, I'd recommend getting something
    that is likely to be usable for a long time. Maybe something like Thesis isn't
    a bad idea\u2026 a superfamily, with multiple elemets. Personally, I like the
    typefaces families of <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/browse/person/majoor/martin/\">Martin
    Majoor</a> quite a lot."

  body: "The problem with puppies for Christmas is that they quickly grow up to become
    dogs, and many people don't really think that through. Don't get a puppy unless
    you plan for it to be for life (life of the dog, anyway).\r\n\r\nSorry for the
    digression, but my wife is the chair of the board for a local animal shelter and
    I hear all sorts of really unbelievable stories about the \"January returns.\"\r\n\r\nThat
    said, what about something from [[http://www.houseind.com|House Industries]]?
    Many come with cool swag and printed paraphernalia -- much more fun for the giver
    to behold and wrap, not quite so virtual.\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n\r\n"
