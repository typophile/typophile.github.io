  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m designing an identity and web site for a company who does downhill
  &#40;cruiser&#41; bicycle tours. I&#39;m considering Leviathan Black Italic for
  the logotype and looking for some suggestions in regards to a face to pair with
  it. The personality should be friendly, fun, exciting, and somewhat informal yet
  professional. <BR> <BR>Initial thoughts are Base Twelve Sans or Optima.

    sans look. Dan

  body: I would use Gotham. Although Leviathan is a gothic, and Gotham is more of
    a geometric, I really think that Gotham would compliment it. This is breaking
    my own rules, but you only live once. And besides, they are both by <a href="http://www.typography.com/"
    target="_blank">Hoefler Type Foundry</a> so how could you go wrong?

  body: 'So the list grows... <BR> <BR>Daniel - I like Tarzana, it has many of the
    attributes I suggested. I also briefly looked at Triplex, but the italic &#40;which
    I&#39;ll need&#41; is a little too funky. <BR> <BR>Tiffany - Gotham is &#40;of
    course&#41; brilliant, but I feel it&#39;s too geometric for this gig. While it
    would pair nicely with Leviathan, it&#39;s personality is not quite right. <BR>
    <BR>I have the follwing in contention at present: Base 9 or 12 Sans, Optima, Tarzana,
    TheSans.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m going to check out some of Nick&#39;s offerings at
    <a href="http://www.shinntype.com/">ShinnType</a> as well as Rian H&#39;s &#40;<a
    href="http://devicefonts.co.uk">Device</a>&#41;. More face and foundry suggestions
    are <i>more</i> than welcome. <BR> <BR>'

  body: Wow -- some really great suggestions here. Not only have I been exposed to
    some fantastic new faces and foundries, but I&#39;m reconsidering the Leviathan
    pairing all together. <BR> <BR>Daniel -- John Sans is BRILLIANT, as are the faces
    from Terminal. Their quality is immediately evident upon viewing. <BR> <BR>I also
    found a face called Lux Sans at Thirstype which has a nice feel. Feedback on this
    faces&#39; quality would be appreciated. <BR> <BR>So my shortlist is as follows
    &#40;in no particular order&#41;, but funnily I&#39;m still hanging on to Base
    12 Sans &#40;my first instinct&#41; because of it&#39;s character and small caps
    as well  <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"
    BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>Base 12,    Emigre <BR>John Sans,    Storm <BR>ClearviewOne,    Terminal
    <BR>Giacamo,    Terminal <BR>TheSans&#42;,    Fontfabrik <BR>Lux Sans,    Thirstype
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve ruled out Tarzana and Fedra Sans due to certain idiosyncrasies.
    <BR> <BR>&#42;Is there anywhere online where one can actually set/testdrive Fontfabrik
    typefaces with one&#39;s own text sample? I&#39;m able to do this will all the
    other faces above at various sites. It&#39;s nice to be able to see the same words
    in context when comparing faces. <BR> <BR> -t

    <BR>You should check the newly released <a href="http://www.typotheque.com/fedra_sans/alt/index.html">Fedra
    Sans Alt</a>, which removes some of the idiosyncrasies you are mentioning.
