  of critic is accepted..\r\n\r\nhope to hear you soon\r\n\r\nSilvio\r\n\r\nP.S. Obviously

    like Porchez' Costa.\r\n\r\nThe balance between the word space and the letter
    spacing is off to me. The letter spacing is a little too tight I think. Try tracking
    it out a little. Or you could shrink the word space, though I think that would
    be more of a display setup.\r\n\r\nGood work!"

  body: Thanks Randy, I will try what you suggest, spacing and kerning are the most
    difficult things I think...

  body: "You are welcome!\r\n\r\nAlso, most of the letters are relatively narrow,
    which is fine. But with that in mind, some of the letters seem a little wide (VWXYZ,
    and u).\r\n\r\nTop right of the K is low.\r\n\r\nS spine needs attention\r\n\r\nThe
    joins on your diagonals WVM etc seem too flat to me, but my preference is more
    of a point when possible.\r\n\r\nTake another look at your stem connections in
    letters like nmhbd etc. It seems like the arch stroke gets thick again before
    it joins the stem instead of tapering down until it joins.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, spacing
    is difficult. But like all parts of type design, it is mostly about training your
    eyes how to see. To see that something is wrong, and even harder to see what is
    making it wrong. It looks like you have good instincts for it, so keep going!\r\n\r\nRandy"
