body: Okay, I&#39;ve hit the limits of my sanity on this one ... it looks <i>so</i>
  familiar but I can&#39;t place it. It seems kinda Zapfy to me, but maybe that&#39;s
  just because the verticals curve like Optima. It&#39;s not Michelangelo, Palatino,
  or Zapf Renaissance. Trajan and Goudy Trajan have a similar &#34;feel&#34;, but
  don&#39;t match. Where have I seen that R before..? arrgh. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/34655.jpg"
