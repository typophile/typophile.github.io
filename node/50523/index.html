  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Im planning to investigate how during the first and second world wars there was a very small amount of anti-war material in circulation and total government censorship of work produced, and how this differs from modern conflicts such as Vietnam, the gulf, Iraq etc.</p>
<p>I also want to look at the change in public protest and opinion and the way that government leaders are portrayed, an example of this could be the way in which Churchill was used as an iconic pro-war figure during WW2 and in contrast how George Bush has been used to in anti-war material.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve currently looked at:</p>
<p>Milton Glaser- The design of dissent
Graphic agitation 1 +2
War posters: weapons of mass communication</p>
<p>Ken garland CND campaigns/ first things first manifesto.</p>
<p>Herb Lubalin, no more war in Avant Garde magazine (seen in a previous post)</p>
<p>Sagmiester&rsquo;s imperialist comic strip</p>
<ul>
<li>a selection of ww1/2 poster books/designers</li>
</ul>
<p>I was wondering if anyone has any advice on the subject, or can point me in the direction of more material/areas of research! Thanks.</p>

The reviews on the linked page explain the book better than I could.</p>
<p>Images that stick in my head from the beginning of The War Against Terror include the shop signs that said &ldquo;America is Open For Business&rdquo; above an American flag with a shopping bag handle attached to the top, the photo of a  group of firefighters hoisting a flag at the World Trade Center wreckage, and a badly photoshopped bald eagle head with a tear dripping from its eye.</p>

<p>I wrote this piece during the invasion of Iraq, and questioned the design of the &ldquo;quit or die&rdquo; flyers.
Subsequently, of course, I realized that they had been very successful.
Interestingly, a guy from Psy-Ops (the real deal, not the San Fran foundry!) emailed me protesting that my criticism was unfair, considering that he was in the field, working on a laptop in a tent. I replied, but me email was bounced, so I was unfortunately unable to follow up with a dialog, I would have liked to have known if they had a print-shop at the air-base, and other production details.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Interesting Topic benm. From which nationality&rsquo;s point of view are you looking? Military archives would be a good start for research. Will your dissertation encompass all media or just print or film and now electronic media. I would be interested in seeing your findings. Just had a thought about having a look at the court / prison records.</div>
