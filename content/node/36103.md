body: "Some of you have asked about renewing your Typophile Memberships. We've found
  that tracking memberships and dues, in addition to shipping \"thank you gifts\"
  in exchange for your contribution requires a fair amount of overhead.\r\n\r\nWe're
  making this much more straightforward. In exchange for your contributions, we will
  ship you the items of your choice. And we think the products speak for themselves.\r\n\r\nThank
  you, to those of you who have contributed in the past. Your ongoing contributions
  ensure Typophile continues to thrive. In addition to this year's shirt, designed
  by [[Christian Robertson]] ([[Punchcut]]), limited quantities of past years' shirts,
  designed by Graham Hicks ([[Test Pilot Collective]]), [[Mark Simonson]] and Christopher
  Simmons (<a href=\"http://www.minesf.com\">Mine</a>) are available.\r\n\r\nLastly,
  we'll be shipping items on or around the 1st and 15th of every month, so if you
  order today we'll have it in the mail tomorrow.\r\n\r\nOn to the <strong><a href=\"http://typophile.bigcartel.com\">Typophile
  Merchandise \xBB</a></strong>\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nJoe, Jared, Ken and the
  Typophile crew at Punchcut"
