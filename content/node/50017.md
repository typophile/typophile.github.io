  and in their indentity currently includes Vectora LT Std 45 Light. How small can
  I go with this before its print quality starts to get questionable? I've never worked
  with small/light fonts before when going to press.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nMike"

  body: "How are you printing? Matched Pantone colors or black (which will all come
    out pretty crisp) or CMYK? (which will have to be screened to achieve the color)\r\nNeenah
    Classic Crest is a nice paper to print on, but the process will affect the outcome.\r\n\r\nIf
    you're printing dark on light you can go smaller/lighter than if you're printing
    in reverse (ie knocking out white on a dark background etc, where dotgain will
    affect the type weight)\r\n\r\nIn addition to that - what is the smallest typesize
    you're contemplating right now?\r\n\r\nAs to printing small - make sure that someone
    over 40 can read it! (You'd be amazed how much people will struggle with small
    type, and you don't want important info such as the email address or phone number
    to be too small to read by the person who's getting the card).\r\n\r\nGood luck!"

  body: "Looks fine to me. 7pt type on business cards is pretty common. Sure some
    of us might need glasses to read it, but it\u2019s not like this requires long
    periods of continuous reading.\r\n\r\nOn a related note, \u201C5th Floor\u201D
    with the superscript \u201Cth\u201D is totally Microsoft Word and doesn\u2019t
    belong on a business card, especially not an executive-level card. And at that
    size the fake superscript letters just disappear. Either write out \u201CFith\u201D
    or just use 5. "

    recently was the recipient of a market rant by a V.P. at the lauder corp., buddy
    of mine (and mentee) head of packaging for Clinique.  to me he is a kid but, no
    kidding, he is NOWabove 40.\r\n\r\nto my delight and surprise HE was moaning about
    how teeny-weeny type has become.\r\n\r\nwhen i was growing up 8pt was the smallest
    for commercial jobs.  period.\r\n\r\ni, of course, do stuff smaller.  but this
    is okay when engraved.  however, some laser writers doe beautiful teeny-weeny
    type.\r\n\r\nold school minimum, 8pt.  period.\r\n\r\nthe rest of the decision
    is up to you."
