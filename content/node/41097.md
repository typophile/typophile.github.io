  body: "Goran, de Groot's theory of the ratio between stems is not rocket science.
    Its basic idea is that each weight should be multiplied by the same number to
    get the next weight. Thus if your light I is 50 wide, and your heavy weight is
    450, then one intermediate weight should be 150. That is because 3 x 50 = 150
    and 3 x 150 = 450. \r\n\r\nAnother way of saying this is that the weights should
    be in a geometric progression, with a common factor that multiplies each weight
    to get the next one.  Eg: 50, 150, 450, 1350, etc., where 3 is the common factor.
    De Groot's formulas give you a way to caculate n intermediate weights, given the
    extremes. But if you are uncomfortable with algebra, you can just find the common
    factor just by guessing and seeing whether that number works by doing the arithmetic,
    then adjusting it bigger or smaller--trial and error. In my example you would
    get to 3 pretty quickly just by guessing and seeing what is too much and too little
    for the common factor. \r\n\r\nAll that being said, another way is to figure out
    what you want to use these for, and then test them in those usages. After all,
    in the end the usage is the most important thing. \r\n\r\nFor example, James Montalbano
    said something like this, if I remember rightly: If you have made a regular weight
    you like, then make the medium weight something that can substitute for the regular
    in reversed text--white on black. Then make your 'light' so that the medium works
    as a 'bold' relative to the light. And of course the actual \"bold\" should look
    good with the regular. That gives you four weights.   "

    of having a continuous smooth progression of weights at the same ratio is not
    as important as the function each weight must achieve. Think about what each weight
    is for (relative to your particular typeface) and space the weights according
    to best function. \r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Another way to define your progression of weights without any math would
    be to construct it. Below is what I mean. On top is your thinest weight. On bottom
    is your heaviest weight. They are separated by 4 units in the example but you
    can use any number of units depending on the number of weights you desire. The
    unit can be anything convenient, picas, mm, inches, whatever. \r\nOn the lift
    I have drawn a simple straight diagonal line from the width ends of your 2 stems.
    Where they intersect the measured units is the stroke width of the intervals.\r\nOn
    the right, I have drawn a curve instead of a straight line. This will force the
    progression of weights to increase more as it reaches the bolder weight. You can
    use any regular curve depending on how much you want to skew the weight intervals.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/5-weights_3637.png]\r\n\r\nChrisL\r\n"

  body: "To carry this one step further and give you numbers, I have added your scale
    and found the value -100 (in green) and then put it on a 3rd curve at right where
    the curve is adjusted to where the first of the 4 divisions falls on the -100
    length. With the curve now fixed, I took the 2 line segments which struck the
    2 yet undetermined values (see blue lines) and measured them on your scale and
    noted the corresponding values. They turned out to be 345 and 836. This will give
    you an even progression with -100 as the 2nd unit as regular, the medium as 345,
    and the bold as 836 to go with your pre-existing extreme values of -500 and 1500
    for light and extrabold respectively. There was no math involved, only measuring.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/5-weights2_4928.png]\r\n\r\n

    comments about function determining your decisions is a sound one. Do you see
    these fonts being used as coordinated weights? If so, for all members, or just
    between, say, a regular and a bold? If so, you'll need to fine tune those weight
    relationships just like you went through a bunch of work to determine the ideal
    \"regular\" weight. (BTW, if you haven't reconsidered that, it's worth actively
    thinking about whether you have the right value for \"regular.\")\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "I think the spacing is OK, the light has a whole lot more space between the
    letters than the heaviest one, which is rather tight at the moment.\r\n\r\nI think
    I want them all to be coordinated, at least visually. I am making light, regular,
    medium, bold and black (or some other name for this last thick one)\r\n\r\nWhat
    do you mean with right value for regular? The stem thickness? Isn't that different
    for different fonts? I mean, some fonts are heavier than other by nature, are
    they not?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    stem thickness is even different in the same font at different sizes, in some
    fonts... :-o \r\nWhich is one way of saying that 'optical weights' are different
    from what I think you are doing here.\r\nDez's excellent illuatrations give some
    hint to this, with his display of linear and non-linear paths between your light
    to black. \r\n\r\nCheers!"
