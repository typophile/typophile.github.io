body: I'm working with InDesign CS2, and the only hyperlink option I can see is the
  visible/invisible rectangle.  I don't like the way this looks in the PDF version
  of my document, and I want to create typical blue, underlined hyperlinks.  Any help?  Thanks
  so much!

    and create a character style to create the underlined, blue link.\r\n\r\nAnd tag
    'em by hand. If you do it as you place each story, it's not onerous, or you can
    mark it up on a proofreading run."
