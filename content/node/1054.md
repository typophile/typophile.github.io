  body: So these fonts were being sold retail, but then were bought out and pulled
    out? That&#39;s pretty interesting &#40;and equally rare&#41;. Doesn&#39;t the
    client mind that it&#39;s too late to make it exclusive, at least not totally?
    <BR> <BR>&#62; what should a type designer charge <BR> <BR>It depends on your
    personal circumstances &#40;like where you live, and what reputation you have&#41;,
    but I&#39;d say around $1500, plus-minus $500, for a typical three-font family,
    for one or two years. No fancy hinting or character sets. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: '&#62; $1500 is low-ball hobbyist pricing. <BR> <BR>Well, few of us already
    have a foothold in the custom type design business... <BR>You gotta start somewhere,
    especially in this economy. <BR> <BR>Also note that a lot of times fonts that
    sell in retail aren&#39;t as polished as a big client would need. <BR>For one
    thing, they might pay a bit more for bringing their version up to par. <BR> <BR>&#62;
    The fact that the fonts have already been sold eliminates the exclusivity. <BR>
    <BR>But in the case of Revolution for example, that apparently didn&#39;t stop
    them! Were they deceived? <BR> <BR>If the font in question is selling briskly:
    <BR>1&#41; Nobody would want any imaginary exclusivity on it. <BR>2&#41; Yes,
    you wouldn&#39;t give it up cheaply! <BR> <BR>But most of us don&#39;t make $1500
    per font per year. And this is exactly why the client <i>can</i> get de facto
    exclusivity even after sales have been made. It&#39;s just another phenomenon
    of what might in fact be called &#34;hobbyist&#34; type design, where a person
    has another day job, but still has the talent/skill/determination to make fonts
    that some clients love. This client might see a nice font that hasn&#39;t been
    distributed very much and decide to buy it off the market, to halt &#40;more like
    reduce&#42;&#41; distribution. It makes sense, no? <BR> <BR>&#42; Plus it&#39;s
    not like a &#34;real&#34; exclusive font never leaves the company&#39;s computers...
    For example the British Airways font that Monotype custom-made isn&#39;t exceptionally
    hard to come by, and they paid an arm and a leg for it. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: From my experience working as Art Director for two fashion magazines I can
    say that the exclusivity is not such a big issue most of the time. It is more
    common in advertising or branding. <BR> <BR>If you are one of the trend-setters
