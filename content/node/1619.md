body: 'I was walking to a movie theatre when i found a &#34;HIGH VOLTAGE&#34; sign
  on the ground. The sign was made to look like a stencil so they could attach it
  to a wooden phone pole and it would stand out. Anyway it looked cool so i made it
  into a font. Later i changed the curved lines to straight and added the original
  stencil tabs. this is the result. <BR> <BR><!-Attachment: voltage67.swf-!><CENTER><TABLE
