<div class=commentbody>I suppose there are only three you can use anyway, because you have to go by what is on the user's system. My choice: Verdana before Helvetica/Arial. <br> <br>Next Problem: If you really want to control the output use pixels, they come almost same size on most of the systems. <br>(There's is an ever ongoing discussion wether to us "em" as a measure.You might consider this, too, since it's relative and you leave choice of type-size at the user's side.) <br> <br>The Body Copy of this forum is arround 12 I suppose. (It's done by font-tags, so the measure is the HTML classes for text size: 1, 2, 3,...) <br>Here's what's in the font tag: <br>"size=1 face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" <br> <br>Your last question should also be answered with this. <br> <br>Servus <br> <br>Dominik</div>

<div class=commentbody>thanks guys for your help, <br>i was talking about normal body copy text and fonts. <br>Its just that some really clean sites have a nice, well line spaced, good leading bodies of text and it looks really clear, clean and modern to read, not to mention easy to read as well. <br> <br>And i have always been fighting with myself as to which font/s are the best to use, as you want your site to be easy to read and at the same time i want it to look modern and corporate etc. <br> <br>I seem to always use Arial, can i ask is there any reason you prefer Verdana over arial? Is it because it has better leading, character spacing is larger? <br>I would appreciate your answers, and Thanks for your feedback answers, they were spot on. <br>cheers kev</div>

<div class=commentbody>Verdana is far more readable on screen, both in terms of letter shapes and spacing. Arial was a print font that was adapted for screen use. Verdana was designed for screen use from the ground up. <br> <br>With regards to letter shapes, Arial's relatively closed counters for shapes like a, c, and e make those letters less distinctive than they could be at typical on-screen text sizes. <br> <br>Try typing a sentence. Set it in 9 pt Arial and again right below in 9 pt Verdana. Copy those two lines, and do them in 10, 11 and 12 pt. View them on-screen at regular 100% zoom. Which text looks more readable to you across the range of sizes. <br> <br>Note: If you have a Mac, also use 14 and 16 pt. If you have Windows, also use 7 and 8 pt. This will help compensate for the different ppem ratios of the two OSes in normal applications. <br> <br>Cheers, <br> <br>T</div>

<div class=commentbody>> One day, Microsoft engineers were looking <br>> at a comparison of on-screen Verdana versus <br>> on-screen Arial. <br> <br>I think it was being compared to Tahoma, not Arial. <br> <br>Verdana is more readable for the reasons cited, but it's also pretty wide, which can be a problem onscreen. <br> <br>-- <br> <br>BTW, what do I tell you guys about voting? :-/ <br>Voting = venting.

<div class=commentbody>Hrant, are you talking about rating other people's posts on Tphile, or about going to the polls on Nov. 2? <br> <br>If it's the latter, then I disagree with you. There's no way you can convince me that the next 4 years won't be better (for the U.S. and the world) with someone other than GWB in the White House. So I intend to vote on Tuesday, and I encourage everyone else, regardless of party affiliation, to do the same. <br> <br>(I'm not unsympathetic to your arguments about the merits/workings/fairness of of our electoral system -- but in this case, the specter of 4 more years of Bush is too frightening.)</div>

<div class=commentbody>Verdana is great. It's open, and has a generous x-height, but at <br>anything over 12 point, and especially the bold at those sizes, <br>it's very clunky (ugly). I've been known to mix Arial and Verdana <br>(gasp)... using Verdana for body text (11pt, usually) and <br>captions (9pt) and using Arial for headlines and large call-outs. <br> <br>Mixing sans like this is blasphemous in some circles, but on the <br>web, where options are limited, I find it works well.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yes Joe, <br>i agree i have just been trying different combinations and i funny enough arrived at almost the same 2 combos. <br> <br>For body copy i used Verdana at 11 point looks nice and clean with a bit of line spacing. <br>I even took the colouring back to 70% black and it opened the page up very nicley and was still nice to and easy to read. <br> <br>Small Headlines and Captions I actually do prefer Arial at around 12 point bold. <br> <br>I find thats a nice clean combination. <br>Although i wouldnt use the same 2 together in my graphic design for printed materials for example. <br> <br>To you all, thank you very much for the time you have invested in giving the feedback you did, its beens a big help especially now that i have a final workable solution. <br>Thanks and Cheers <br>Kev <br> <br>PS: 1 last question, as you mentioned Verdana can get a bit wide sometimes, can we apply tracking to the body copy with HTML or CSS sheets and close the letter spacing up a bit to combat this problem for the web?? <br> <br>Cheers Kev</div>

<div class=commentbody>&lt; avoiding the bush-kerry debate... > <br> <br>Ummm <br> <br>I' don't know how many of you have experience with CSS, but we try to avoid the "point/pixel-problem"( as Thomas described) by defining the font-size & lineheight in Ems. <br> <br>like: <br> <br>.bodycopy { <br> font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; <br> font-size: 1em; <br> line-height: 0.2em; <br>} <br> <br> <br>that way, the font-size depends on the configuration of the user. If I'm not mistaken, an Em in Web-typography is the size predefined in the control panel of the browser or the size defined in the parent object. For better info see: <a href=http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/articles/webrev/199910.html> More fun with font-sizes by Eric Meyer</a> <br> <br>Anyway, to answer your question: yes you can define (negative) letter-spacing (css-property: letter-spacing) with CSS, but alas, is a little bit flaky. Especially in IE. It's a bit of trial & error really... <br> <br>letter&lt;/font></div>

<div class=commentbody>A republic, run on democratic principles, doesn't necessarially preclude that its citizens won't live in in freedom. Like most American schoolchildren, I grew up thinking that America was the only "free country" in the whole world. Now, living in Europe, I realize how not true that is. Granted, the United States is older than every European democracy, except maybe Holland's, but the continent is now filled with free, "democratic" societies, which are all Republics too. <br> <br>Hurray for Republics! <br> <br>Of course, in many ways, the United States is more of a "democratic" republic than most European examples.

We elect a local representative, those representatives constitute the (main body of the) legislature, and the executive is drawn from the members of the legislative body. <br>Its this process, the need for local representatives and the presence of a significant third party that allows anti-democrats to hide behind this system and deny us a democratic electoral system (though one is available). <br>I can't imagine what reasons a sane person could find for the US not just having the candidate with the most votes, winning the election. <br>In whatway does the electoral college promote democracy?</div>

England, although its Parliamentary tradition dates back to the 1600s, or even the 1200s, did not even have universal white protestant male sufferage until at least 1848.

Without going into all of the arguments for/against certain type sizing online, I'll just say this: <br> <br> - points are for print...not screen measurements <br> - pixels do not mean it will render the same in all browsers or will be non-resizable in any browser <br> - ideally, if everyone knew how to adjust their browser settings, you'd set body type at 100% (and this is the point of debate). <br> <br>As for the electoral collage, it is an outdated method that serves no purpose in today's world. It made sense in the 1800s--not in the 2000s.</div>

<div class=commentbody>>>...our republic was founded when the US Constitution was ratified in 1789. England...did not even have universal white protestant male sufferage until at least 1848... <br> <br>But just as England had a parliamentary system many years before it even came close to being a democracy, the US was still way off being a democracy for many years after the constitution was ratified in 1789. In 1789 only <i>rich</i>, white adult males got the vote. Women had to wait until 1920. African Americans had to wait until 1870, American citizens of Chinese ancestry had to wait until 1943 - even Native Americans had to wait until 1924. And in practice, for most non-white Americans, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 marked the advent of a near-democratic electoral system. <br> <br>>>Well, in the US, we get to vote for both our local representatives in Congress AND for President (even if we elect him indirectly). <br> <br>This happens in the UK too, but both things are combined into one election process. <br> <br> <br>>In whatway does the electoral college promote democracy? <br>>I never said it did. <br> <br>OK, sorry. I misunderstood - when you said 'I'm for the electoral college' I couldn't think why anyone would be for the electoral college, and assumed there must be some argument that it promotes democracy. If it doesn't promote democracy what does it do? <br> <br>================================== <br>================================== <br> <br>One thing that I keep hearing here at the moment is 'Why does the US make elections so complicated?' Not so much in terms of the electoral college, but more in terms of the voting arrangements, voting machines etc. No US state has a population more than half the size of Britain, yet here with turnout usually well over 70%, many areas having more than the usual 5 or 6 candidates, and a voting system that uses nothing more than paper and pencils, we get a fairly accurate count, returned by about 7am the morning after the election.</div>

I think you probably know that I'm as unconvinced by global capitalism as you are, but for me, there is a point in discovering exactly what's wrong with it. The reason for that is so that we move on in the right direction, which as everyone else knows, is exactly the opposite direction from monarchism.</div>

<div class=commentbody>OK, I should also apologise for the hijacking of this thread. But, while we're here... <br> <br>>>The Mystery of Capitalism by Hernando de Soto <br> <br>de Soto comes across as a little too much like that Fukuyama idiot that captured a lot of media attention a few years back. I have to admit that I didn't read his book properly, but I read enough to know that some of the things he claims to have 'discovered in the history books' had been discovered about a hundred and fifty years before, and are, or have been, the subject of intense academic debate.</div>

<div class=commentbody>And most importantly, exactly how does it make any real long-term difference? :-/ <br> <br>> how many Califiornian electoral college votes were awarded to each candidate? <br> <br>It's all or nothing (per state). That's at the heart of this farce. <br> <br>The reasons for the Electoral College are obvious: <br>1) Makes the election much easier to rig, like in 2000. <br>2) Avoids the bad aftertaste of your president being elected by 1% of the popular vote.
