  a Champagne offer in a trendy lounge in my hometown, and I'd like your opinion on
  the copy as opposed to the design (which is in early stages) of the poster.\r\n\r\nAdditionally,
  some opinions on the typography would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nYours apprehensively,\r\n\r\nPaul

  body: "It could be stronger both in idea and grammar. You don't want to insult your
    potential customers \"only people without an imagination can't find a reason to
    drink champagne\" assumes people are stupid. We might know they are, but they
    don't need to be told they are. Keep it light-hearted and omit any negatives...\r\n\r\nMy
    suggestion, consider the reasons that people drink Champagne. I'd say the majority
    do it to celebrate something. \r\n\r\nSo, approaching it as: \"Any reason is a
    great reason to celebrate!\"\r\n\r\nThen in smaller text, you can say something
    like, \"When you purchase a bottle of Moet & Chandon's from Ruby's, you can keep
    the celebration alive with a second bottle at a price worthy of your celebration.\"
    Expect cheapskates, and don't beg for more money. Omit the part about being generous.\r\n\r\nIn
    summary, most people are stupid and cheap, don't point it out. Approach it as
    a chance to bring in quality customers who will pay for a second bottle. So, make
    the idea appear smart and rich and smart, rich people will come. "

  body: Many thanks for your insightful comments Asvetic - I completely agree with
    your musings on the Wilde quote too, and I'll be offering it as an alternative
    to the client.

  body: "Dump the quote. If you\u2019re going to do a simple all-copy ad then you
    should have one idea that can work as one block of text. If that block needs supporting
    copy the ad lacks confidence and feels desperate. It\u2019s important to not give
    that impression because this ad amounts to a restaurant coupon which itself is
    a sign that the restaurant isn\u2019t good enough to get by on the food and service
    and is using gimmicks to bring in business."
