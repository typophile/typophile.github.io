  of Type foundries offering iOS embeddable fonts?  I've been doing alot of research
  lately on fonts and applications and there is so much mixed information out there
  on the licenses.  I design a good amount of apps and want to make sure I'm giving
  the foundries their credit. \r\n\r\nI'd be interested in creating a list here for
  paid, open source, etc in iOS fonts? \r\n\r\nThanks. "

    apps' and you'll get alot of different views on this including some complete disregards
    for the type designer - I thought making a list might help that out. \r\n\r\nI'm
    still trying to figure out if fonts on Google fonts are available for iOS - getting
    nowhere. \r\n\r\nTypekit just got back to me - \" Typekit is only licensed for
    web use; to embed in an app you'll need to purchase license from the foundry.\"
    - says nothing about that on their site.  No one is really tackling this but I
    see a huge opportunity for Type designers. \r\n\r\nI don't know but this thread
    may serve a nice purpose if we can get it ranked up high enough on search. "

    You are free to do pretty much anything you want, except reselling the fonts by
    itself"

    type designer </cite>\r\n\r\nWhat does that mean? \r\n\r\nIt's very simple: Embedding
    software in an app is \u201Csoftware distribution\u201D. If you purchase a print
    license, you are allowed to use the font on local machines, not to distribute
    it with an app. Just as you are not allowed to distribute Dreamweaver, Xcode or
    whatever software tools you use to create your work. You have a license to use
    them, not to redistribute them. Not even in a \u201Chidden\u201D way, which is
    not directly usable by the user of the app. \r\n\r\nWebfont license are supposed
    to be called from web servers by browsers. You might call those fonts from a web
    server from within a web browser in your app, but you are not allowed to embed
    the font files in an app. \r\n\r\nOFL licenses are very liberal. You can do a
    lot with them, including app embedding. "

  body: "Thanks for clearing that up Ralf. \r\n\r\nWhat was meant by the above is
    that the information is not clear at all and that the type designer may not be
    getting compensated - for example take a look at Font Squirrel - there's nothing
    on there about iOS apps but it says 100% free for commercial use.  It's a very
    grey area although I know Apple is turning down apps without licenses. \r\n\r\nI'll
    get a blog post going also in the upcoming weeks and will include any Type Designers
    posting in here that are offering iOS embeddable fonts. "
