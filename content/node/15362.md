  designing a Lego advertisement billboard which is targetted towards parents about
  their past interactions with Lego. \r\n\r\nWhat I need is a typeface that reflects
  on the 1950\u2019s (Because Lego first began to use plastic injection moulds around
  this time), however needs to have a friendly, inviting mood. The other problem is
  that the typeface can\u2019t look too out dated because it\u2019s a billboard for
  the present time. I\u2019ll bulletpoint things to make it easier: \r\n\r\n- Require
  a 1950\u2019s typeface\r\n- The type needs to have an inviting, friendly mood\r\n-
  When parents look at this billboard, the typeface should have a nostalgic feel\r\n-
  The typeface can\u2019t look too out dated (Sounds like a contradiction - how can
  it be nostalgic and not look too outdated???) \r\n\r\nIt seems like I\u2019m having
  trouble. I thought about using Comic Sans since it has a kid like feel, however,
  doesn\u2019t reflect a 50\u2019s feel. \r\n\r\nIf anyone has some really good suggestions
  about choosing a good typeface or anything else, Please post! =)\r\n\r\n"

    might work. It's \"childish\" in a certain way and has some features suggesting
    50s lettering. Still it's modern in many ways.\r\n\r\nI also suggest you to study
    Lego packaging from the 50s, recycling some things from the old packages might
    do wonders.\r\n\r\nWhat ever you do, please - I repeat - please, don't use Comic
    sans.\r\n"

  body: "I just used Sauna yesterday for a job. This font kicks much butt! Great in
    text. Superb in display. My only beef is that it needs the open type treatment.
    I need more figure options! For example, I almost always want Cap Height numerals
    for the Black weight in display, but it comes with OSF. I give Suana 4.5 golden
    dingbats out of 5.\r\n\r\nDear Underware,\r\n\r\nPlease update your buttkicking
    font sauna, and bring it to opentype glory.\r\nHopefully, with a minimal upgrade
    price for T1 users.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nRandy Jones"

  body: "Hi everyone! Thanks for everyone's opinion about what typeface is suitable
    for the job! I'm currently studying at university and tried to find the fonts
    that people recommended. Unfortunately, my university doesn't offer any of the
    ones stated. \r\n\r\nMy question is that can anyone suggest ideas to replicate
    typefaces? Most of the websites offer typefaces to download (about $150+) for
    certain fonts. As a student, I don't have that kind of money to give away, especially
    on a tight budget. Fonts such as Brown, Grenadine, or Antique Olive Nord would
    be great! I'm quite interested in the font grenadine.   \r\n\r\nIf anyone by chance
    has the font grenadine by Akemi Aoki, please reply. I don't know how much I can
    offer you, but we could come to some agreement perhaps. \r\n\r\nThanks for your
    time again! =) \r\n\r\nVincent.  "
