    of \"ITC Avant Garde Gothic\" and \"ITC Lubalin Graph\" to include 10 styles each.
    \  SoftMaker's versions of those 2 font names being cloned under license from
    Brendel - \"A850 Geometrical\" (ITC Avant Garde Gothic clone) and \"L850 Slab\"
    (ITC Lubalin Graph clone) - are both finally coming in all 10 styles each for
    the \"regular\" parts, and the small-caps parts each have approx. 2 styles.\r\n\r\nSoftMaker's
    versions of those 2 font names being cloned under license from URW++ - \"Avignon\"
    (ITC Avant Garde Gothic clone) and \"Square Serif\" (ITC Lubalin Graph clone)
    - are both finally coming in all 10 styles each for the regular, alternates #1,
    alternates #2, and old-style figured parts.   The \"condensed\" width parts of
    each font comes in 4 styles (Book, Medium, Demi Bold & Bold), and the small-caps
