  displayed in a program like Illustrator)?\r\n\r\nI am interested in reclassifying
  some fonts, so that (a) they show up under one family in a piece of software and
  (b) don\u2019t conflict with each other thus preventing a font manager like Suitcase
  Fusion from activating several weights at once.\r\n\r\nI apologize for posting this
  <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/35230\">again</a>, but I haven't received any
  answers yet."

    should be aware that some foundries would consider this modifying the font. Those
    same foundries do now allow for it. Your best bet might be to contact the foundry
    from whom you licensed the type and ask if they can supply you with split families.
    I know Linotype offers this for one."

    ... I''m having particular problems with a broken family of Scala used by any
    major application: specifically Illustrator, Photoshop and InDesign CS3. Is that
    specific enough?'

  body: "\"Is that specific enough?\"\r\nYes. Thank you for your response. My advice
    is to contact the vendor from whom you purchased the broken family of Scala and
    have them replace it with a product that works for you. \r\n\r\nCheers!"
