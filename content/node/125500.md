body: "This book is a little confusing because although the font used on the title
  page and for chapter titles look similar, there are two kinds of \u2018e\u2019 here.
  They seem to have used two similar fonts for different chapters, using both in the
  Notes title. Any chance of identifying them? I\u2019m particularly interested in
  the more distinctive one with the sweeping tail on the Q, the blunt-tailed y and
  the angular g.\r\n\r\nPublished by Frederick A. Stokes Company, New York. There
  is also a George Allen & Unwin Ltd. credit at the end of the book."
