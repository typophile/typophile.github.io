  body: i'm guessing that this has to do with most fonts coming standard with [[tabular
    figures]]. With [[OpenType]] fonts, you can have several sets of figures, proportional
    figures in addition to tabular figures. However, with your standard Postscript/TrueType
    font, the decision has to be made about which style of numerals will be most useful.
    Apparently in many cases this means tabular figures.

  body: "You're right Eric, if a foundry publishes a font with only tabular spacing
    of figures, then the figures should be designed for that spacing.\r\n\r\nHelvetica
    should have 1s with a foot serif, like the Franklin, Trade and News Gothics.\r\n\r\nIf
    Herb Lubalin had ever considered that Avant Garde would be used for anything so
    menial as setting a column of figures, he would probably have designed an alternate
    set of figures for that very purpose. \r\n\r\nI'm wary of proportional old-style
    figures: skinny little 1s, 3s, and 5s can lack presence in a lower case setting.\r\n\r\nFor
    Bembo, why do foundries bother with lining figures? -- for a face like that, real
    typographers use old style figures in text, and roman numerals in all-cap settings.\r\nSUPERBOWL

    you bring up an extemely valid point that is absolutely lost in today's type usage
    and \"font marketing\".\r\n\r\nThe majority of typefaces available in digital
    form are actually adapted from \"pre-digital\" type designed for particular usage
    (booksetting, handbills, ads, posters, financial, statistical or mathematical/scientific
    publications, etc.) with little necessity to create a full complement of characters,
    let alone \"super-family\" all inclusive sorts for every imaginable application.\r\n\r\nI
    don't know why some type buyers today feel cheated if they don't see lining, tabular,
    old style numerals, nut fractions, etc., and I feel some foundries might feel
    it is now expected by the type buying public. \r\n\r\nWanting it doesn't make
    it right, and in many cases \"the customer (unknowingly) is definitely wrong\"!"

    spacing between the 1 and 9.\"\r\n\r\nThere's your problem right there! Your assumption
    is wrong. Most regular PostScript fonts were released by large foundries with
    tabular figures only as default. So the default behavior is going to be just what
    you see. If Berthold adds kerning to certain number pairs (as most foundries do
    with letter pairs), then those combinations would look better. But if there is
    only one set of figures, the thinking goes that it should do the most jobs, and
    satisfy the most uses. Since tabular figures are essential to tabular sets of
    figures (money), the default figures are tabular, and the font won't contain any
    kerning pairs between those figures because that would wreck the alignment of
    the tabular columns. \r\n\r\nSo, though I think we all agree that tabular figs
    are not typographically useful most of the time, they have been a very common
    default style in PS fonts for years. If you do not want to invest in OpenType
    (see the new <a href=\"http://www.fonts.com/FindFonts/RecentReleases/2005/04-06-2005.htm\">Bembo
    Book</a>!), you could alternatively edit the kerning table for your font so that
    you get the behavior you want every time without hand-kerning. "
