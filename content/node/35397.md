  Deca.\r\n\r\nI joined your community an hour ago. I look forward to reading your
  blogs, etc.\r\n\r\nRecently, I earned a BFA in graphic design from the Savannah
  College of Art and Design. Before that, I earned an associate's degree in commercial
  printing from New York City College of Technology in Brooklyn, New York.\r\n\r\nWhile
  I was a student, I took an interest in Polish Poster Design, Karel Martens, the
  history of the Lumitype (or direct-photographic photocomposition), and some of the
  lettering designers for American book jackets during the postwar period.\r\n\r\nLately,
  I have become enamored of the work of German typographer, Jurgen Huber, especially
  his 'Hothouse' typeface.\r\n\r\nAll the best,\r\n\r\nMAD \r\n\r\n"
