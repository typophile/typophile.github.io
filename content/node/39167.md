body: "Hi fellow Typophiles. I was looking through some old vintage labels on eBay
  and I found this one below. The listing says \"old brewery stock\" Tivoli Brewing
  Company original <em>Mile Hi</em> beer bottle label.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/milehi_5904.JPG]\r\n\r\nI
  was wondering if anyone here would know what font is being used for \"Mile Hi\".\r\n\r\nThanks
  :)"

    to look fairly close, see <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/indy/\">Indy

    discussed in another thread) is almost a dead wringer.
