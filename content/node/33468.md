    with a reversed 'W'.\r\n\r\nTyler - Are you looking for something to compliment
    this logo, or something to <em>replace</em> Popgod? Who is the company? Who is
    its audience? More info please!"

  body: "Lex, thank you for your tip! I'm looking into Chalet now. London 1970 might
    work, but I have to figure out how to get a typeset sample.\r\n\r\nStephen, you
    are on the money, as always. I really like Popgod for its funkiness, but for my
    word, Poptwin, the letterforms clash.\r\n\r\nSo, yes, I am looking for a replacement
    for the entire logo. I'm starting to think that a custom design is the only real
    solution here.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nPoptwin is media-driven online meetingplace, and
    represents one of the new projects I'm putting together now for my new venture,
    Plastic Trophy.\r\n\r\nTarget ages: 16-35 with runoff into 45; which is what makes
    the branding tricky; I want it to be a little cliche, but not without sophistication.
    Something for the clubbers and the boosters as well.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking something
    like Bomb magazine, but with the edge toned down."

  body: "Yes, I've looked at this face before. It's an interesting combination of
    sophistication and funky, no?\r\n\r\nI really like it on its own merit, but don't
    think it's right for my project. In fact, I haven't seen any face that suits me
    when set in upper/lower case.\r\n\r\nSo I've focused my efforts on an all-caps
    solution.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nRegardless, I really appreciate your help Stephen!"

  body: "Yes, you are absolutely right. I just haven't found a lowercase set yet that
    was *pop* enough for me.\r\n\r\nMaybe what I ought to do is double back and begin
    my search again just focusing on the lc version of the word.\r\n\r\nThe closest
    I've come to finding a lc set that felt right was Omnes Black Italic at the Village.
    I l-o-v-e that family of faces, and while the word looks great to me, and looks
    *popish* as well, it has a bit too much motion in it, me thinks."
