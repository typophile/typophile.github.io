  body: "The 1940s were still the era of metal type. Noting the way the letters overlap
    I suspect that that this is photographed lettering. Might be worth checking some
    of the published alphabets for lettering. For example by lettering artists such
    Becker and Atkinson, if this is an American book. If this is a British book you
    might check for published alphabets by British lettering artists. \r\nDon"

  body: Thank you Don, that is helpful. It is a British book so I will start looking
    for relevant lettering artists. Is it possible that the book's illustrator created
    this lettering himself, or would that be quite unlikely?

  body: If you look at several of the book covers on line - the Toby Twirl's are all
    related but a bit different, so Don is right this was lettered by the series illustrator.
    Fun lettering, could be a nice font developed from this.

  body: "Thanks Bob for the additional info. I love the piggy snout on the r -- as
    if Toby Twirl was pushing his nose into things. From the wiki http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toby_Twirl
    we learn that TT is an inquisitive young pig with human hands and feet. The illustrator
    was Edward Jeffrey, who I presume also did the lettering. More info on Edward
    Jeffrey http://www.ravenstonedale.org/features/toby_twirl.htm\r\nPix of the TT
    covers organized by series http://www.tobytwirl.co.uk/TT%20Books.htm\r\nFor more
    online pictures  of TT covers google \"toby twirl sheila hodgetts\" or a variation
    of this request.\r\nUnfortunately for a font designer, none of these online images
    include more words in the style of TT adventures.\r\nAnother possibility is that
    the publisher Sampson Low, Marston & Co. Ltd.  had someone else do the lettering
    or the original title.  But this seems remote, given that they seem to have had
    Edward Jeffrey from the outset.\r\nSo for additional letters it seems that a search
    for other work by Edward Jeffrey is as good a lead as any.\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: Thanks Don and Bob. I am going to research further your suggestion that the
    lettering is designed by Toby Twirl's illustrator, Edward Jeffrey. In raking light
    it is possible to see the impression of the printing block (is that the right
    term?) in the soft fibre of the paper. If I can find out any more information
    about the lettering I will post it on Typophile. Vince.

    or at least catches the general style. This could be a fun font to make.\r\nDon"
