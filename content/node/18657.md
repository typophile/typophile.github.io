    Days </a> by West Wind Fonts. \r\n\r\n(edit: Nah, it is not. Just similar and
    it looks a lot like <a href=\"http://www.type-o-tones.com/p_fonts/p_memi.htm\">Memina</a>.
    Hmm, maybe this is a knock off!\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/daisy.png]"

    I came up with one of Nick Curtis's freebies called <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script07Pg5.html\">'Lost

    It is another case of an amateur''s rendering of a typeface as they saw it in
    print. As such, it''s not exactly a digital knockoff, but not a responsible design
    either. Though we disagree on the ethics, <a href="http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/westwind.html">Luc
    Devroye</a> basically proves its similarity to MeMima on his site.'
