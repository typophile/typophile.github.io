  body: "I think the Howland answer may be right. I don't have my copy of McGrew handy,
    but I found a link talking about Howland shown in McGrew's book. [[http://www.flickr.com/photos/16863237@N06/4199543723/|Here
    is an image]] of some of the Howland type. I think that is yours too.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "I am looking at the sample of Howland in McGrew's book, and I notice differences
    from your sample. The G is especially different, but many of the other letters
    seem to have larger serifs than your sample. The G is more like that in DeVinne
    Condensed, but the serifs in that typeface are not the same as your sample.\r\n\r\nHowland
    seems closest, but not exactly right.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
