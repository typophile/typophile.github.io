    <BR>&#34;History of &#39;All Your Base&#39; <BR> <BR>1.\tToaplan creates the Zero
    Wing video game.  <BR>2.\tToaplan releases a port for the Sega Genesis console
    with the addition of an intro scene, which is then translated into english &#40;very
    poorly&#41; and released in the United States.  <BR>3.\tToaplan goes out of business.
    \ <BR>4.\tSomeone from a Zany Video Game Quotes website notices the poor translation,
    and highlights the game.  <BR>5.\tOverclocked.org does a humorous voiceover of
    the Zero Wing intro in a fake Wayne Newton voice.  <BR>6.\tDozens of game-related
    messageboards begin to post quotes from the parody, and images altered to show
    the phrase.  <BR>7.\tMost of the threads lose interest and die off quickly as
    the trend is pronounced dead countless times.  <BR>8.\tThe Flash movie/video is
    released with images from the threads and music taken from the origional game
    someone had added the phrase &#34;all your base&#34; to.  <BR>9.\tAYB explosively
    expands to the general &#40;non game messageboard-reading&#41; public.  <BR>10.\tThe
    origional site for the video is shut down within hours due to excessive traffic,
    and moves to PlanetStarsiege.  <BR>11.\tLycos ponders how &#34;All your Base&#34;
    was transformed from obscurity to a top 50 search practically overnight.  <BR>12.\tMainstream
    media begin to notice the trend, and stories appear in Time Magazine, USA Today,
    Fox News, The Los Angeles Times, Tech TV, Wired, and many others.  <BR>13.\tAs
    the &#39;remix&#39; used in the video goes from 58 hits a day to several thousand
    per day, mp3.com notices the track has been ripped directly from the video game
    and pulls the music off their site due to copyright violations. It is later returned
    unchanged.  <BR>14.\tThe trend continues to grow as it expands into nearly every
    corner of the web.  <BR>15.\tLarge websites like Angelfire and Hewlett Packard
    sneak &#34;all your base&#34; references into their designs.  <BR>16.\t&#34;All
    Your Base&#34; is pronounced dead several times every day, yet it&#39;s 15 minutes
    of fame continue for some reason...  <BR> <BR>"

    about purism, or linguistic imperialism &#40;I&#39;m sure Polish speakers get

    about supposedly qualified people who are quite well paid to do one thing &#40;copyeditors&#41;
    not doing it properly and thereby ultimately making language less beautiful and
    useful.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m most certainly not a lingua-purist -- I&#39;m quite
    content with neologisms and I&#39;m quite content to let archaisms like &#39;an
    history&#39; and the don&#39;t-end-a-sentence-with-a-preposition rule slide. But
    it annoys the hell out of me to be reading a quality newspaper and find redundant
    parentheses &#40;commas all over the place where they&#39;re not, needed&#41;
    and the like. It confuses meaning and annoys a close reader. <BR> <BR>It is actually
    the job of the copyeditor to uphold certain values in language and punctuation.
    He/she should know not just the correct usage of colons and semicolons, but should
    be able to, e.g: distinguish em and en dashes; correct &#39;three period&#39;
    ellipses; remove redundant punctuation; etc. <BR> <BR>I think when these skills
    decline -- as they are declining -- we lose a certain amount of precision from
    our language, and are thus less able to be precise in our communication. That&#39;s
    important, and worth getting wound up about. Wack apostrophes in the local supermarket,
    not so much. <BR> <BR>R <BR> <BR>&#40;Please mark this post with red pen, give

  body: '&#62;&#62;when these skills decline -- as they are declining <BR> <BR>Are
    they declining? <BR>In England there was a neglect of teaching English properly
    at primary schools throughout the 1980s &amp; much of the 1990s, but under the
    new National Curriculum, standards seem to be improving, and going beyond the
    levels that were prevalent before the decline. My kids learn grammar in a much
    more formal way than I ever did. <BR>I think we &#40;in the 1970s&#41; were expected
    to pick up the rules through osmosis, via exposure to correct English, rather
    than by actually being told what they were. <BR> <BR>I <i>am</i> concerned about
    cultural imperialism &#40;even within England, the language police have been,
    and continue to be, busy suppressing regional and class variations in speech and
    writing&#41;. <BR>On the other hand, I think that where precision is important,
    it is necessary to be able to write exactly what you mean, and to expect others
    to be able to correctly read what you have written. The primary purpose is communication,
    and if the rich tapestry of cultural variation gets in the way, then maybe that&#39;s
    not a good thing.'

    National Union of Teachers, the <i>British</i> Broadcasting Corporation, and the

  body: '&#62;&#62;Maybe we should rethink using words such as &#34;damage&#34; and
    &#34;proper&#34; <BR> <BR>Yeah, agreed. That&#39;s sloppy on my part. Variation
    and innovation in language is of course inevitable. But variation/innovation can
    be beautiful and intelligent -- when it makes its own kind of sense and/or grows
    out of a love and deep understanding of communication and language -- or it can
    be just dumb, lazy mistakes that get to seem OK because they&#39;re repeated often
    enough by &#39;authoritative&#39; sources. E.g. I really enjoy reading David Foster
    Wallace&#39;s stuff. He has an amazing ear for language. You find yourself eventually
    thinking the way he writes, which is very far from &#39;proper&#39; usage a lot
    of the time &#40;beginning sentences with &#39;And but&#39; etc.&#41;. And regional
    vernaculars often have their own grammatical tics which make total sense within
    their contexts. <BR> <BR>But there is usage, I think, which is just plain wrong
    and ugly -- generally usage which is trying to be transparent and authoritative
    but which falls over owing to lack of knowledge or skill on someone&#39;s part
    &#40;either the writer, who can be excused, or the copyeditor, who can&#39;t&#41;.

    making it closer to the mainstream of reality. <BR> <BR>Two landmarks: the Watergate

    the difference between corrected, edited, proper grammar, as it is supposed to

    quite revealing to see, from transcriptions of the Watergate tapes, just how un-proper

    by the sports press in Boston, so they decided to report his utterances verbatim,

    reading you right, you&#39;re hitting the point bang on: Joyce made an<i> educated
    choice</i> about how to punctuate &#40;as did e.g. J P Donleavy, probably under
    a heavy Joyce influence; or Burroughs with cut-up grammar, or Burgess with A Clockwork
    Orange, etc.&#41;. Knowing the rules and playing with them for your own and the

    I think he&#39;s capable of really great writing though, and a few people I know
