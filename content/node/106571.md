  body: "The stonecutter would have used the lettering styles that were familiar to
    him rather than a font as such. Note that the 1936 lettering has some minor differences
    from the 1900s lettering. \r\nThe earlier lettering can be reproduced with some
    success by using a font such as Dharma Gothic, which is modeled on 19th century
    woodtype similar to the lettering. See http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/dharma-gothic/\r\nAs
    for the numbers they are again the stonecutter's idea of what is appropriate.
    Note the clear differences between the 1913 and 1936 versions.\r\nDon"
