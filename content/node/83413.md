    with a sort of similar 'd' was Dino dos Santos' <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/dstype/andrade-pro/?refby=bowfin\">Andrade</a>.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "The reason I ask about other letters is that without any more letters all
    I can do is search MyFonts for 'Didone', looking at those 3 letters. If I had
    more letters the search could be expanded beyond MyFonts by using the <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsearch.php\">Serif
    Font ID Guide</a>.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
