<p>I am at the very beginning and have just made some sketch concepts - concepts only!</p>
<p>The logo is for a business for medical professionals involved in real estate transactions.  A good friend of mine asked me to create the logo as quickly as I can, and I keep getting stuck at the very beginning with how to incorporate the stethoscope with the house.  Those are the two things the company wants included on the logo, placing the steth on the house.  I know the stethoscopes look bad - I just freehanded it fast.</p>
<p>The stethoscope is supposed to read &ldquo;y&rdquo;  Do you see that or have to look for it?</p>
<p>I also considered not using caps, but I feel that it needs to be stronger because it is a real estate company.  Any tips for typeface?</p>
<p>Thank you for your help and time.</p>

That sounds like an unusual business :)</p>
<p>&ldquo;The stethoscope is supposed to read “y” Do you see that or have to look for it?&rdquo;
I got the &lsquo;y&rsquo; readily. If you hadn&rsquo;t written it, the stethoscope may have been harder. But once you draw it better, I guess that shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem. And anyway, you&rsquo;d get it by association.</p>
<p>Of the two options, I prefer the one on the left where the profile of the home is more simple. Why not try an option where the two words, Healthy and Realty are stacked - in such a way that you have the stethoscope making a common &lsquo;y&rsquo;?</p>
<p>As for typeface, I&rsquo;d definitely go for something less neutral. Do see if [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_speak_ot|FF Speak]] works for you. The lines of the font may cue a way to draw the steth.</p>
<p>You may also want to look at replacing all-caps with title case.</p>

<p>Also, this logo will be used primarily for yard signs, but also business cards, flyers, other branding, etc.  Should a 1200 px wide, 360+dpi .png image be sufficient for most printing companies, or will I need to start over and make this as a .bmp or .svg?  Thanks for your help.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The other idea I’m considering now..&rdquo;
Looks interesting. I&rsquo;m not sure you really need to draw the house so literally. Probably just the roof profile, as you had done earlier, would be sufficient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;but my friend wants the stethoscope to only act as the lower “y”&rdquo;
I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re friend was just giving a suggestion to get you going, and would be  quite okay if the idea evolves a little, as long as it addresses the client brief. Here it looks as if it is.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should a 1200 px wide, 360+dpi .png image be sufficient&hellip;&rdquo;
If it&rsquo;s anything other than an on-screen application, you&rsquo;d be better off creating it in vector so that it can be scaled to whatever size. That means drawing it in a program like Illustrator, Freehand, Corel Draw etc. If you need an on-screen version, you can always create a jpeg/bmp from that.</p>
