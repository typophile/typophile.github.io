  images of the book \"Divina Proportione\" from 1509. Can anyone point me in the
  right direction? Specifically, I'm looking for big images of the gridded titling
  letters inside.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nMatt\r\n\r\n"

    I guess it's time to make some calls.

  body: "Sorry, it's by Luca Pacioli and the real title is \"De divina proportione.\"
    \r\n\r\nIt's a work on mathematics and proportion and includes drawings by da
    Vinci as well as a great proportional alphabet that no one has done a good job
    of restoring IMO. I'm not going to let the fact that there was no \"w\" or \"u\"
    or even \"z\" stop me. ;-)"

    It's not a complete facsimile of the book, but a synopsis of the letters only
    and this version was published by none other than Stanley Morison.\r\n"
