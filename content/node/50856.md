body: "Hi, everyone.\r\n\r\nRight now I'm writing Opentype programs, and there are
  two things I don't get it.\r\n\r\n1.\r\nThe font has small cap characters and Th
  ligature. Th is controlled by 'liga' feature (sub T h by TH;), but when the smcp
  feature is turned on, Th doesn't separate into T(cap) and h(smallcap) and remains
  still. How can I avoid this?\r\n\r\n2.\r\nI'd like to use 'valt' feature, which
  is used for vertical setting. It's supposed to controll vertical bearings(like moving
  g up or l down), but I have no idea how to write the code. It's very strange thing
  for Japanese people to ask about this, but I know almost nothing about Opentype
  things. If you know anything about this or any good books to learn these, please
  tell me."

    replaced h by smallcap H, there is no T h left for ''liga'' to replace by T_h.'

  body: "You need to manually order your lookups so that the smcp lookup precedes
    the liga lookup. These kinds of features are applied simultaneously by the layout
    engine based upon the order of lookups in the font, not on a specified order of
    features hardcoded in the layout engine (as happens for some other kinds of features).\r\n\r\nIf
    you are making your font in FontLab, you have to order the lookups by ordering
    the features to which that are associated. You do this in the OpenType panel by
    clicking on and dragging feature tags up and down in the feature list.\r\n\r\n[In
    Microsoft's VOLT tool, you can control the order of the lookups independently
    of the features with which they are associated, which is sometimes useful.]"

    this,\r\n\r\nfeature valt {\r\n  pos A <0 -1000 0 0>;\r\n} valt;\r\n\r\nand then,
    FLS showed it correctly in Preview palet, but it didn't work with Illustrator

  body: "I should first state that the 'valt' GPOS feature is effectively deprecated,
    because there is a better way to achieve the functionality. Given that the context
    in which its functionality is expected to be used is vertical writing, and that
    it is also expected to be default behavior, we discovered that we could effect
    this through 'vmtx' table overrides.\r\n\r\nI developed a Perl script, several
    years ago, that takes two files as input. One is a coverage table, specifically
    a list of CIDs and CID ranges that are candidates for this treatment. This means
    anything that is classified as full-width Latin, full-width Greek, or full-width
    Cyrillic, including full-width symbols. The other is the AFM file for the font,
    which has the glyph-level BBox information. (The AFDKO tool called \"tx\" has
    a mighty convenient \"-afm\" option for generating AFM files from a font.)\r\n\r\nConsider
    the full-width Latin glyphs for a, b, and p. In Adobe-Japan1-6, the CIDs are 816,
    817, and 831, respectively. For Kozuka Mincho Pr6N Regular, the AFM records for
    these glyphs are as follows:\r\n\r\n<CODE>C -1 ; W0X 1000 ; N 816 ; B 276 -12
    754 514 ;\r\nC -1 ; W0X 1000 ; N 817 ; B 240 -12 762 772 ;\r\nC -1 ; W0X 1000
    ; N 831 ; B 248 -257 775 514 ;</CODE>\r\n\r\nGiven that the top and bottom of
    the design space is at 880 and -120, what we effectively want to do is to center
    the glyphs within that 1000-unit space. When I run my script, which I named mkvmtx.pl,
    the following is the output for these three glyphs:\r\n\r\n<CODE>table vmtx {\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VertOriginY
    \\816 751;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VertOriginY \\831 628;\r\n} vmtx;</CODE>\r\n\r\nWhat
    happened to the entry for CID+817? Look at its Y-axis values, specifically -12
    and 772. There is exactly 108 units between the edges and the edges of the design
    space, so the glyph is alrady centered, and no adjustment is necessary. The default
    value is 880, and thus is not necessary.\r\n\r\nThe workhorse portion of my script,
    which iterates through AFM records, ignoring those not in the coverage table (%cidrange),
    is below:\r\n\r\n<CODE>$ybottomlimit = -120;\r\n$ytoplimit = 880;\r\n$ycenter
    = ($ybottomlimit + $ytoplimit) / 2;</CODE>\r\n\r\n<CODE>while ($line = &lt;STDIN&gt;)
    {\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if ($line =~ /^C.*/) {\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chomp
    $line;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;($cid,$ymin,$ymax) =
    (split(/ /,$line))[7,11,13];\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if
    (exists $cidrange{$cid}) { \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$halfy
    = ($ymax - $ymin) / 2;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$yminnew
    = $ycenter - $halfy;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$pushy
    = round($yminnew - $ymin);\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$pushy
    =~ s/^\\+(\\d+)/$1/;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;printf
    STDOUT \"  VertOriginY \\\\$cid %s;\\n\",$ytoplimit - $pushy if $pushy !~ /^-?[0-4]$/;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}\r\n}</CODE>\r\n\r\n<CODE>sub
    round {\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my ($arg) = @_;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if
    ($arg =~ /\\.[0-4]\\d*/) {\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$arg

    collections, or both, please feel free to drop me an email.\r\n\r\nDr. Ken Lunde\r\nSenior
