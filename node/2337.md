body: I need a printer, pretty much to preview type designs. I <BR>understand that
  a b&amp;w laser is almost perfect. But I have  <BR>also been looking at photo-quality
  printers and they seem  <BR>to have excellent image quality, but nonr of the shops  <BR>could
  print me out type samples. <BR> <BR>So, what do the typophiles recommend? What is
  everyone <BR>else using to print out type-in-progress? <BR> <BR>kris

  body: Some high resolution inkjets &#40;especially HP ones&#41; can create excellent
    type when used with special inkjet coated papers. This is because they are coated
    with &#40;I seem to recall&#41; a ceramic-derived coating that absorbs and dries
    the ink immediately, stopping ink from spreading through to the fibres of the
    paper itself. However, the paper is very expensive, and so its not really practical
    as a medium for testing fonts, as you should be making LOTS of print outs through
    a face&#39;s development cycle. <BR> <BR>Far better to use a laser printer, where
    it can provide good quality results consistently and inexpensively. Then, when
    its close to completion, sent it to an imagesetter at an output bureau for the
    final tests.

    <BR> <BR>FontLab&#39;s high rez preview also helps a great deal. <BR> <BR>Also
    I think the subject of printers has been discussed in other threads, but if you
    want a recommendation, Xante&#39;s 2400 dpi laserprinter is terrific, though a
    tad expensive.'

  body: Never used that particular model, but we have a Minolta QMS at my office.
    It&#39;s higher on the food chain &#40;1600 dpi, 11 X 17, IIRC&#41; than this
    one, but it works like a charm. I&#39;ve no complaints. I&#39;ve been thinking
    about getting the same model Randy has ever since a student sent me a link to
    TigerDirect a few months agao.
