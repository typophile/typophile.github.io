<p>I am currently working on a major new international typography book – called “1000 Fonts” – which will be published by Chronicle Books in early 2009. I’m looking for outstanding examples of typography to illustrate the book.</p>
<p>I have already received a large number of artworks for the title, from huge agencies such as Saatchi &amp; Saatchi through to one man graphic design companies working out of bedroom studios: the only condition for work to be included in the book is that it is of the highest quality&hellip; and that it uses one of the fonts on our shortlist of 1000.</p>
<p>The book will cover typography in a wide variety of media, so examples ranging from publishing to corporate identity, product design to signage, are all encouraged. Also, feel free to submit as many examples of typography as you wish, using as many or as few of the fonts on our list as you like.</p>
<p>A full list of the fonts which we need artworks for is at the foot of this message. The deadline for submissions is Monday 14 July 2008.</p>
<p>If you would be interested in showcasing your work (alongside your URL) within the book, please get in touch at the contact details below, or upload your work directly to our FTP site, along with: your contact details, client details, the date the work was produced, and the font the work was produced with. If your entries are selected for inclusion, you will also receive a complimentary signed copy of the book.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading, and I look forward to hearing from you,</p>

<p>I have to agree with Kent that the chosen typefaces are mostly rather common or &ldquo;dull&rdquo;. Many of them exploited way beyond the border of &ldquo;health&rdquo;. Also there has already been a large amount of books covering these ones. What designers need is to be introduced to newer designs (and there are many great examples) to get inspired and filled with new ideas.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Kentlew</p>
<p>Thanks for your message. A little bit of background about the criteria for choosing the fonts&hellip;</p>
<p>The target market for the book is graphic design students and those starting out in a career in design, although more experienced designers would doubtless find it useful as well. The idea behind the book is to order the fonts featured by major aspects of function, allowing the reader to quickly identify a range of suitable fonts for a particular project at hand. The book is heavily illustrated with examples to demonstrate the range and variety of results achievable with a single font, examples which will hopefully provide both experienced designers and newbies with inspiration to apply to their own projects. Given our target audience there was a need to include a percentage of classics/tried and tested/&ldquo;workhorses&rdquo; as well as some more contemporary typefaces. In this regard, our consultant editor on the title, Bob Gordon of the University of Brighton, was ideally placed to direct the selection as he has massive experience with both design students and young/emerging typographers. What we&rsquo;re aiming for is a book that will stand the test of time though, so we believe it&rsquo;s important to maintain a proportion of &ldquo;classics&rdquo; (we have also found in our image research to date that there is no shortage of designers producing exciting and enduring work with these fonts).</p>
<p>Coming back to the issue of artworks. Yes, we have found examples for the majority of fonts that we are looking to illustrate, these 170-odd are the ones that we are now directing our search towards&hellip; no fear: there will be 1000 fonts in the book!</p>
<p>Any questions, please don&rsquo;t hesitate to ask!</p>
<p>All the best</p>
<p>James</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p></em></strong>It&rsquo;s an interesting method of compiling a selection of font showings&ndash;showing them in real-world usage, rather than the usual practice of culling from foundry specimens (including faux ads) or creating artwork specifically for the publication. The user-driven method of compilation is very contemporary.</p>

I imagine it&rsquo;s more cautious than sour. As JH has already applied peanut butter, here&rsquo;s some jelly. 
The cost, if one licensed 1/2 of the fonts in this book, would be around $20,000, an unlikely sum to pay for most.
We get a couple dozen, &ldquo;give us your fonts so we can make a book about fonts&rdquo; requests per year. 
The number of fabulous type books that come out per year, is somewhere around .45.
Sandwich complete?</p>

<p>Best ad-libber.</p>
<p>Let me see now,
When students were only beer they had no books to buy money.
When beer was a student I only had money books to buy.
When books bought money I was only a beer student.
When I was a beer student I had no money to buy books.</p>
<p>Aw spit, what&rsquo;s the topic of this one again? Oh yeah, one time a few years ago a woman wrote to me to ask for permission to use one of my retail fonts in a book about typography, promising my font catalog URI would be printed next to samples of the font in the book when it was published. She conveniently made no mention of license fees due. She only asked for permission to use the font. I told her I was very busy and my time is worth money, and just answering her crawling request had cost me twenty bucks, and she certainly had my permission to use the font if she paid the license fee. She wrote back saying another font maker had granted permission to use their font at zero cost (no license fee) in the book. I told her that person was a  fool she had bilked into letting her use their font for free.</p>
<p>Turned out her husband was writing the book, and the woman was doing the soliciting. I won&rsquo;t disclose the woman&rsquo;s name or religion, because that would be seen as bigoted discrimination against people of her ilk.</p>
<p>Cheapskates! Never give in to cheapskates. I almost billed her for wasting my time, but that would have cost me even more time and revenue.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Dear all</p>
<p>First, a big thank you to all of those who have submitted work following my initial post. We have received some really interesting submissions and it will take some time to go through them and determine which ones we use for the book, but I will be in touch with you individually as soon as we have made our decisions to let you know if we will be using your work.</p>
<p>Thank you also to all those who have responded to my initial post. Whether positive or not, all of your feedback is useful. It&rsquo;s good to see that the post generated some debate as well. Of course, it&rsquo;s an impossible task to keep everyone happy with a book of this type (a list of 1000 of anything will always divide opinion to some degree)&hellip; however, we&rsquo;re open to all types of feedback (although naturally we prefer the constructive type!).</p>
<p>For those who were disappointed at the omission of certain fonts, please feel free to submit work. If you feel that we&rsquo;ve made some glaring omissions we would welcome the opportunity to see examples of those fonts we have omitted&hellip; we&rsquo;re completely open-minded and prepared to have our minds changed on this one.</p>
<p>Secondly, I just wanted to address the issue of font licenses. We are not, as some have suggested, soliciting works in order to obtain font licenses. We in fact have licenses already for all of the fonts that will be included in the book.</p>
<p>Lastly, a reminder that the invitation for entries is still open. Deadline: 14 July.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your interest and feedback.</p>
<p>All the best</p>
<p>James</p>
