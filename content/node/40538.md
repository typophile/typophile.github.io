    links.\r\n\r\nI love John Cale's (new) album BlackAcetate. Jim O\u2019Rourke is
    really nice. I'll delve into the others soon to hopefully find some new long term
    inspiration. thx.\r\n"

    that my recognition makes it so).\r\n\r\nI wish there was a better mastered version
    on 1919, my CD sounds like mud.\r\n\r\n[[http://mog.com/music/Jim_O%2527Rourke|Jim
