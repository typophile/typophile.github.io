  body: "I have the feeling some people think that fonts are made by computers in
    the background. They think each PC produces some fonts when they have \xBBsparetime\xAB,
    maybe when they are dreaming ;) So maybe they think fonts grow on harddisks. \r\nAnd
    the only challenge for the users is, to find the fitting typeface. That would
    explain why many people get angry when they are told that sharing isn\u2019t legal.
    They think it is a personal thing, not a matter of fairness. "

    It's something you easily ignore. Sometimes, because of the fact that I am now
    aware of that and the fact that I became aware of not being aware, I find myself
    looking at the multitude of things around me and thinking \u201Csomeone actually
    made this chair, the carpeted floor, the windows, the freakin' building, and I
    take it all for granted!\u201D When we use a pen to write we never think we owe
    something to the people who made the pen. Or a hammer or whatever.\r\n\r\nYes,
    I know: you don't just come by a hammer; you have to buy it (or at least borrow
    it). But typefaces just appear where you want to use them, nowadays. And the pen
    is actually not a bad example\u2026 people just give out pens! :P\r\n\r\nPatience
    and understanding required. :)"

    he got distracted and ended up with the optic nerve and the appendix and men with
    nipples, it was the kerning you see, he only had 6 days.
