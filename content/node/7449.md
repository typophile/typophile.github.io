body: 'Hello everyone, <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been reading here for some time now and finally
  decided to register and participate. So I&#39;m posting something to be criticized,
  as a start. <BR>Explanation: sulPET is the annual meeting of all PET - Programa
  Especial de Treinamento, &#34;special training program&#34; from universities in
  southern Brazil. PET is kind of a study/research group made up by really good students
  &#40;you need high grades to get into a PET&#41; and professors. There are PETs
  about all areas of study - Architecure, Engineering, Literature, Biology...  <BR>So
  this is the 8th sulPET, and the three small sentences on the right are this year&#39;s
  subject: &#40;from top to bottom&#41; Sharing Knowledge, Science and Society, Constructing
  Paths. <BR>We&#39;ve tried to stay away from &#34;pictorial&#34; logo because the
  budget is very low and we don&#39;t feel it makes much sense to create a logo that
  will be lost as soon as the meeting is over. <BR>This year&#39;s meeting focuses
  on the relationship between PETs and society in general, in opposition to other
  years which were generally about inside-PET discussions. We tried to convey that
  by putting the subject lines as outgoing lines that start from the word PET. That&#39;s
  the main idea we think should be passed to the participants: that this year is about
  an outgoing thought, not restrictive on the PET.  <BR>Oh, the font is Helvetica,
  in it&#39;s Bold and Black variations. We tried to keep it straightforward and simple
  so we tried with different sans-serif fonts, but Helvetica has such a nice balance
  we decided for it. A classic&#39;s a classic, eh? <BR> <BR>Anyway... we&#39;re open
  to all king of suggestions, concepts, typographic details, etc etc. Thank you all

  body: My only thought is to make the type on the rotating divisions the same size.
    By making them different sizes it &#40;one&#41; looks like a mistake or &#40;two&#41;
    you are making some more important than others.

    try"> <BR>Here&#39;s a new version with some slight changes. Tried to balance
    out the box size/font size.  <BR>I&#39;ve tried making the same &#34;box size&#34;
    and also having the same font size, but both look weird once you rotate, either
    the surrounding &#34; invisible circle&#34; feels weird or &#40;as was the case
    in the version i first posted&#41; the text looks too different from each other.

  body: Here&#39;s the new, updated version! We&#39;re trying to reinforce the &#34;getting
    out&#34; idea, and thought that to communicate it we had to show that things were
    getting out FROM somewhere. The great thing about this is that it&#39;s still
    a two-color job, but feels like there&#39;s more.  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/53359.jpg"

  body: the legibility on the angled words is lost now. <BR> <BR>the black outlines
    on all the orange words are making it look like desktop publishing.  not very
    professional. <BR> <BR>can the VIII look a bit more like roman numerals. &#40;ie
    - add horizontal bars?&#41;  it gets lost for me, blending in with sul. <BR> <BR>the
    box isn&#39;t really needed.  the older version was better.  maybe try making
    a &#34;box&#34; out of the other elements?

  body: Unfortunately &#40;and I REALLY think it&#39;s unfortunate&#41; we can&#39;t
    go back to that older version. It looks way too much like the logo a previous
    version of the same event.  <BR>I&#39;m gonna try and post some new versions soon.
    Thanks for the comments loren.

  body: Continuity is not a bad thing. I think evolving a logo by making it more illustrative
    and less legible are the wrong directions. <BR>Maybe try rearranging all of the
    same elements as the year before, stacking, turning, scaling, until it&#39;s similar
    but unique.  <BR> <BR>aaron

  body: 'Normally, I don&#39;t think continuity is a bad thing either. However, according
    to the people who are organizing this event, this one is a turning point in terms
    of content - it&#39;s a new direction. So they don&#39;t want it to look like
    it&#39;s a sequel of last year. Also, there was no previous continuity, every
    year it&#39;s hosted by a different university and a whole different groups works
    on it.  <BR> <BR>Steve: that&#39;s an interesting idea, maybe it would have problems
    when reduced, but I&#39;ll try it anyway. Thanks <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
