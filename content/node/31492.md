    Classico</a> comes close, as do Sabon and Bembo.\r\n"

    one ... and, no, it is not sabon or bembo. but thank you.\r\n\r\ni have a feeling
    this must be some \"classic\" typeface saville had lying around but i can't say
    which one it is.\r\n\r\nanyone else?"

  body: "Thanks Bart. In 'Dutch Type' it also says that a digital version of 'New
    Alphabet' (in three weights) was released in 1997 by The Foundry. So a more recent
    digital version could have been possible, but I agree about the numbers. If this
    was done in the late 80's it might have been done using film type, and who knows
    how many Garamonds were in use then, or whether they were ever digitized.\r\n\r\n-

  body: Cool. I actually owned a copy of the original release on vinyl, but I didn't
    trust my memory enough to confirm that the techno font in the image was the same
    as in the original. It seems likely now that it is.
