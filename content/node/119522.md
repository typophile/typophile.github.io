  body: "I also recently saw this trailer and simply assumed that the typeface used
    was [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sweet/sans/|Sweet Sans Heavy]]. I was wrong.\r\n\r\nThe
    closest I got on this is [[http://www.fonts.com/font/monotype/sackers-gothic|Sackers
    Gothic Heavy]]. The apostrophe and quotes don't match at all but the basic lettering
    is pretty close. Of course, we're looking for something much bolder, here.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sackers_6400.png]"
