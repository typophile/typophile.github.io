  body: "Hello Ryuk,\r\nthanks for this. It is very similar but the S connection (in
    Moser) and also the M are different no ? Capital C also different."

  body: Agree on differences but the base is definitely Sloop. You may have to consider
    it has been edited and modified. /H is identical, cut the curly bottom left part
    of the /M, merge it with, for instance, the half down part of /f, remove the upper
    swash, edit and rework the /os connection, reduce the left curly of the C and
    you're done.
