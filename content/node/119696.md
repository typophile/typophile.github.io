  body: To better undersand a "gesture", I usually follow a few links and may also
    read comments in source files. Those source files can be obtained at the URL <a
    href="https://github.com/girish-dalvi/Ek-Mukta">https://github.com/girish-dalvi/Ek-Mukta</a>
    (click on "download zip"); the README.md file is worth reading, with explicit
    thanks for "support and encouragement". In the <a href="https://github.com/girish-dalvi/Ek-Mukta/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.txt">CONTRIBUTORS.txt</a>
    file it is written that the copyright holders are listed in the <a href="https://github.com/girish-dalvi/Ek-Mukta/blob/master/AUTHORS.txt">AUTHORS.txt</a>
    file, which contains Girish Dalvi and Ek Type. The link <a href="http://www.idc.iitb.ac.in/~girish/index_en.html">Girish
    Dalvi</a> may help seeing the link between the Industrial Design Center IIT Bombay
    and Ek Type.

  body: "Thanks. This is fascinating - one more instance of what I think of as an
    international trend for all scripts to evolve what, for want of a better term,
    may be called a 'san-serif' style:\r\n\r\n Strokes historically made by a stylus,
    brush, pen etc. become simplified. Extra decorative flourishes and artefacts specific
    to the technique used to produce the line are deleted (serifs in Latin script,
    the extra stroke on top of verticals in Arabic, the fuzzy ending of a brush-stroke
    in Japanese and Chinese script). More importantly a generic form of  any given
    letter is adopted distilled from the many calligraphic or decorative script styles
    in use. A 'hidden' requirement may be to make each glyph visibly different from
    the rest, whilst retaining a unified harmonious style for the font as a whole.
    \ Unfortunately most modern Arabic \"Sans\" fonts mimic Latin lettering for no
    good reason, and ignore their own splendid traditions, in that many font letters
    now use the same design element, creating a regimented look and are often illegible.\r\n\r\n
    I first learned about all this in the 1960's from Eric Gill's book \"Typography\".
    It inspired me start a project (almost finished now 50 years later, my AlQuds
    font)  to convert Arabic into Gill Sans style type. I corresponded with the late
    Hiromo Hara the Japanese designer and there he had developed such a Sans style.
    Early non-European Sans-Serif adopters were Thai scripts... and now we learn about
    the trend on the subcontinent. Best of luck. \r\n\r\n"
