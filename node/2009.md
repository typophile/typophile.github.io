  body: 'Rene, the type of artwork most commonly associated with Scandinavian culture
    -- at least in the U.S. -- is <a href="http://www.rosemaling.com/">rosemaling</a>.
    These are brightly colored floral patterns, typically hand-painted by amateurs
    onto wood &#40;furniture mostly&#41;. <BR> <BR>Stephen&#39;s example, while not
    rosemaling, is definitely a good one as well and might be a better source of dingbat

  body: 'Hi Gerald,  <BR> <BR>Thanx for your input. I&#39;ve also asked my ex, she&#39;s
    Finnish, and also said the Norwegan flower ornaments would be to much. They don&#39;t
    mean anything to her, she said. She herself suggested something from the Vikings.
    That was my first thought also, but I realised too that it could be too prototype.
    She also suggested using the ear-marking of the raindeer, but that&#39;s a little
    too abstract for me: <BR><a href="http://tuikku.urova.fi/avoin/poronhoito/merkitys.htm"

    an alfabet for it self, but not enough decorative. <BR> <BR>Personally I liked
    the birds under the trees on your site. Something like that would be great. If
    you have more suggestions, I have time. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been in Finland once
    and it was great. My ex&#39;s parents live in Rovaniemi, very close to the north
    pole as I could feel. Perhaps I visit Finland again. I liked it a lot. I&#39;ll
    also visit the &#39;Santa Pukki&#39; again &#40;is that spelled correctly?&#41;.

    Scandinavian art anymore. <BR> <BR>Most of the Scandinavian immigrants came to
    my state of Minnesota in the late 19th and very early 20th Centuries, and they
    brought it with. It was a very &#34;Swedish grandma&#34; thing to do. But if you
    were to ask a typical Minnesota Scandahoovian, they&#39;d swear up and down it
    was the real deal. Well, I guess Europe has left us behind again. Damn it!

    Their museum is quite the place. If you get to Finland don&#39;t miss it. <BR>

    closed down their hand painting department since I moved here. Things are moving

    you, that has useful function too.</i> <BR> <BR>That ornaments have strong purpose,
    that they have served man and nature profoundly well. They do not deserved to
    become orphaned ancestors. They are building blocks of society, building blocks
    of nature. <BR> <BR>That is why I am so delighted Ren'

    be a fun addition that would help &#34;brand&#34; the font. Plus, it wouldn&#39;t

  body: The &#39;Latinisation&#39; of Futhark mainly involved extension and re-ordering
    of the sign set to match the set of Latin graphemes, so one could write Futhark
    as a one-to-one transliteration of contemporary spelling. An interesting aspect
    of this is the addition of dots to create new consonants. All in all, this &#39;Latinised&#39;
    Futhark doesn&#39;t <i>look</i> very Latin. One could argue that the changes to
    Futhark kept it alive as part of the culture for 600&#43; years after it ceased
    to be used to regularly write a living language.

    also the occult use of runes. It&#39;s important that the language didn&#39;t
