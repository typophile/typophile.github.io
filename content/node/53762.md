  body: Ooooooooooh that's nice. I know how hard it is to do lettering with the brush,
    but the Japanese and Chinese learn it stroke by stroke.  I loved the kid's ingenious
    backtracking solution when the w ran out of paper!

  body: Wow, just found this wonderful clip. It's fascinating to watch which letters
    are more familiar to the baby. Amazing :)
