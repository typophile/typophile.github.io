  See the attachment for what I am trying to achieve.\r\n\r\nHow do I make the logo,
  or any vector for that matter, do this positive/negative thing when placed over
  images?\r\n\r\nI placed the vector on a separate layer in InDesign, colored it white,
  and set the transparency to Difference or Exclusion. The vector appears black over
  the light colored background, but over the dark background it appears a gray.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Difference blending mode, simply creates the inverse value, if the underlying
    image isn't truly black or white the result will look gray.\r\n\r\nYou can achieve
    the effect in photoshop.\r\n\r\nCreate text on a new layer above the photo or
    image. \r\nSet the text layer mode to 'difference'.\r\nRasterize your text layer
    and and create a selection from that layer.\r\nSelect the photographic layer with
    the selection still active, increase the contrast of the photographic layer (
    will only affect the area beneath the text).\r\n\r\nThat should do it.\r\n\r\nIf
    you're not familiar with photoshop, these instructions may seem a bit cryptic,
    be warned."

    to divide an outlined shape (read: logo), apply colors, then bring it into Photoshop
    or InDesign."
