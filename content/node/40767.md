body: "I have been using the font Nocholas Cochin for a while now.\r\nI got one sent
  to me via a designer for the company that I do work for.\r\nIt was unable to load
  onto my mac (intel osx) using Font Agent pro,\r\nI then tried to load it onto a
  os9 mac w/ suitcase, no luck there.\r\nI then brought it to 3 other Macs in 2 other
  locations and all no go.\r\nI then purchased the font from Linotype themselves.\r\nAll's
  well, so I think....\r\nNow I am sending the finished artwork (ill file) to the
  printer.\r\n(an actual offset printer not my ink-jet printer on my desk)\r\nThe
  fonts are 'incomplete' is what I am being told. \r\nYes, I sent the printer and
  screen fonts. (I actually sent the whole folder)\r\n\r\nSo other than the printer
  is clueless, what gives?\r\nIs this an example of \"only being able to use fonts
  your self\" and not \r\nbeing able to copy them, (ie restrictions) or is that really
  possible?\r\n\r\nThanks for any help in this matter!"

  body: It could be that you have remnants of the font your client sent somewhere
    in your Illustrator doc. You can check by opening your illustrator file and go
    to the topbar menu Type / Find Font...

  body: How did you send the fonts to the printer? If you send a font suitcase over
    the internet without enclosing it in a StuffIt file, there is a good chance that
    the file will not survive the trip. (A .zip file created using the "Compress"
    command in the OS X Finder will work, too, so long as it is opened by OS X Finder
    on the receiving end.)
