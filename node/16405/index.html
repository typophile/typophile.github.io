This being my first post, I'd like your opinion on this logo. The internet community for which it's meant is all about communication between young people, and expressing themselves on the net. I'm also redesigning their site, but it all starts with the logo!

I'll appreciate any comments!

I'm going for a combination of

a) a graffitied, dirty look (for which a logo treatment giving it a stencil/spray paint look will be appropriate)

b) a bubbly, dreamy look with rainbows, clouds (just stylised shapes, not  photographic)

which adds up to street art hard core rapper meets absent minded bird loving my little pony collector. Something like that ;)

And thanks!

The only problem I see is that it will read as 'ARIO' because the 'R' is UC and it creates the expectation that the 'TIO' is UC as well. The crossbar on the 't' doesn't read immediately as a crossbar. The idea is strong and the execution is good but needs further refinement to work.</div>

Yep, making the t readable is not so easy, while maintaining the look. I have tried to emphasise the crossbar a bit here below. Also added a small swash to the t.

What if, to emphasize the talk-bubble idea, you had the letters in black and then that which is currently black outlined in white? And perhaps make the exit part of the bubble a little larger?</div>

Funny you should mention that, an earlier version of the logo had the outlines you talked about (if I understand you correctly)

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/artologo_03.gif]

I just think it overcomplicates the logo. I might be mistaken, though...

As for the 4RTO, that was on purpose: I tried to make an A that looked almost like 4, emphasising the 1337 aspect of the chat culture and so on... The exit might need some enlargement, though. Maybe like this:

I think the quasi-traps to add air do not help readability though. I'd say go back to the first and rotate the A a little bit more -- counter-clockwise -- and go. The modulation you've added in the strokes doesn't feel as real or quickly written as the first.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Miss Tiffany & Engelhardt,

Thanks! I have made a smoother transition, mostly by going back to the original and narrowing the line through A and R, but still with a fairly thick crossline in t. The small swash at the buttom of the t is still there -- it might help readability, but it also subtracts from the vertical feel of the A, R and t lines being parallel. A bit unsure about that.

I'm not too keen on rotating the A though. As I see it, it doesn't matter if the A is read as 4, just as long as you read the t as a t at most times. As the logo does owe a thing or two to tags, grafitti etc, ultimate readability is not the real goal.

		<div class="commentbody">This new one is definitely better. The crossbar has a more natural thick-to-thin-to-thick now, too. Now that Tiffany mentioned it, I can't stop seeing a 4 as well. But if it's not a problem for you, then stick with it.

EDIT: Though now that I'm looking at it more, i'm not so sure about the A's crossbar. It feels too narrow before leaving the arch of the legs. I'm staring at it too much.</div>

Soren, if you can get a copy, look up: Fresh Styles for web designers (eye candy for the underground) by curt cloninger from New Riders. ISBN: 0-7357-1074-0

It could help give you ideas with the cloudy grafitti style. Especially look at the paper bag style.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi, I like the way the logo is progressing, however, it would be nice to test it without the crossing line and maybe, so that they don't get too apart, getting the letters closer.

I think the "communication between young people" could is well expressed just by using the "comic bubble" and the form of the letters is young enough for me.

Just an idea :)

Yeah, I could do that. However, having stared extensively at the logo I'm beginning to feel that it has a bit more of a Comic Sans feel in it than I like. Not quite sure about that, but it's supposed to be -- well -- cool looking as well as saying communication between young people. I'm afraid it is getting too childish.

Any suggestions/comments?

Also I've remembered something like this in www.skype.com , not the same of course but a similar idea with the comic bubbles.

Just for playing, why don't you come up with a totally different concept? I know you've invested lots of time in this one but sometimes when I feel I'm getting a little stuck I just drop the idea and start all over again, sometimes doing that allows me to come with new ideas for the original idea, isn't it strange the way our brain work?! :)
