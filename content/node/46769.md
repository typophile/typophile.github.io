body: "When I bring up characters with diacritics in Fontlab (5.04 on OS X 10.4) using
  their keyboard commands Fontlab often crashes. For example, if I use Opt+` followed
  by e to bring up egrave, Fontlab crashes. It seems to happen after I\u2019ve already
  entered other diacritic characters. I\u2018ve tried removing my preferences and
  uninstalling/reinstalling Fontlab with no luck. Is this a common problem?"

    than on a Mac or vice-a-versa. I've not yet encountered the crashing condition
    you describe, but then I don't use shortcut keys like that to enter accented characters.
    I learned to spell out the glyph names, eg: /acircumflex, ccedilla etc. I find
    that easier than remembering shortcut keys, but then writing is something I actually
    enjoy doing so it's not for everyone.\r\n\r\nSave your file often. I hit command
    + s after every edit or at least every ten edits. You just never know when Fotnlab
    is going to crash.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

  body: James P., type the accented characters in TextEdit, copy them and paste in
    FontLab. Does it still crash?

  body: "I can copy and paste, but sometimes not all of the characters paste over.
    Right now my workaround is to just paste over names of the characters kept in
    a text file. Oddly, now I am seeing characters appear in the color of dependent
    pairs\u2026and what is a dependent pair, anyway? It\u2019s not defined in the
    manual."

  body: "My Fontlab crashes everytime I enter diacrits aswell, for example if I want
    to write \xE5\xE4\xF6 right when I start Fontlab, then the program crashes every
    time, but if I open the \xE5, \xE4 and \xF6 glyph one time before writing in the
    metrics window it works just fine."

    would really be easy would be for Fontlab to get their act together and actually
    release a working Mac version of Fontlab Studio. They have had six years to get
    it fixed."

    drag and drop into the metrics window - it's a lot quicker than all that typing."

  body: Typing in diacriticals on the Mac is faster than drag-and-drop. We just enter
    it all in with simple modifier keys as opposed to the alt + numeric codes.
