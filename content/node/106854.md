    sample]], wasn't able to identify it. May be another newspaper/magazine woodmark?
    Reminds me of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/birch|Birch]]/[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/latin|Latin
    Condensed MTI]] but that's far from being even loosely similar...\r\nSecond: 'The
    New York Times' woodmark, close to [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/Engravers+Old+English|Engravers
    Old English]]\r\nThird: 'The New Yorker' woodmark, [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/New+yorker|New
    Yorker]] is derived from\r\nFourth: 'NEW YORK POST' woodmark, see [[http://typophile.com/node/106792|latest
