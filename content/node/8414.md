body: It&#39;s a new year, and I&#39;d like to change the icon which appears next
  to my posts, but when I try and log in at the top of the screen it doesn&#39;t seem
  to do anything... so I can&#39;t get in to my account to change details. <BR> <BR>I
  have tried to log in on both a mac and pc, various browsers? <BR> <BR>Jim

  body: Jim, I am on a mac, using Safari. I just clicked on &#39;edit profile&#39;
    in the upper left hand of the page and was asked for my password. I entered it
    and was right into my profile where you can change your avatar/pic. <BR> <BR>So,
    no problem on my end. Are you using the &#39;edit profile&#39; link? <BR> <BR>Mike

  body: When I went over to TypeMedia at KABK a few months ago, I saw that the students
    had designed monogram as a project, so I sketched out this icon with my own J&amp;R
    combination. <BR> <BR>Jim

  body: I hit reload and got the same. Maybe I need to do a power-up or find a medkit
    ... ha ha. <BR> <BR>I will log out and back in and see if that does the trick.
    It must be my cache.
