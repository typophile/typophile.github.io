body: 'I don''t do display work very often so I''m a bit paranoid re: the kerning
  on this. It''s set in Avenir (LT) at 97pt. I''m thinking the "ep" is too loose and
  the "ti" is too tight - or am I crazy?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Reception_4950.png]'

    make it easier to adjust those tough combinations. Just my opinion\u2026\r\n"

    this is fine in those terms, to me moving the \"t\" left a hair is all it needs.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Jacob, I think \u2018ti\u2019 pair is looking ok. \u2018ec\u2019 and \u2018ep\u2019
    pairs look too close. Also, are you doing this to save space or you don't like
    the original kerning? "

  body: "Hrant - Thanks for giving me the benefit of the doubt, but I think the loosening
    Bert suggested will help legibility in this instance; and reverting to the original
    metrics accomplished just that. But, to my strictly \"graphic designer's\" eye,
    the \"Re\" seems just a hair too loose, and the rhythm seems to break at the \"io.\"
    Should I loosen the \"ti\" in this case? Or is there a better solution?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Reception-metrics_3493.png]"

  body: "You should probably tighten the \"Re\" slightly, but the \"t\" still needs
    to be nudged left. In fact I just looked at the string \"ntnoto\" in MyFonts,
    and it seems that in all the cuts of Avenir the \"t\" sits too far to the right.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
