  a typeface over the summer break.\r\nI started off from some sketches but had no
  real goal other than to produce a typeface and learn how to use fontlab in the process.\r\nAnyway
  I'd like to know what you think and would appreciate any guidance.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks very much Frank, I certainly will I have caught the bug. \r\nBut I've
    been looking at them so long I'm not sure where I am with it all.\r\nI have had
    trouble keeping the stroke widths consistent and balanced, well I still am actually
    and there a some glyphs that I I feel look little awkward.\r\nI was wondering
    what people make of it.\r\n\r\n"
