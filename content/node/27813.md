    find someone with an imagesetter (Linotronic, Accuset...) and get a proof run

    little update here, I\u2019ve just printed out some type on a modern print proof
    machine called Kodak Approval. Similar to traditional imagesetters, it works with
    laser and films and outputs 2400 dpi, but with a modern technique. The result
    was stunning, and I believe it\u2019s similar quality as with the old imagesetters,
    Linotronic etc. BUT, I will testrun one of those old Linotronics aswell :)"

    Fuji Finalproof) are great because you can proof on the same stock which you will
    print and they have very high resloution 2,400-2540 SPI. For type I would think
    you could buy a L-300 or L-200 with a no frill L3 RIP and processor or a drysetter
    (imagesetter and film procesor with no chemicals to add) for far less than 10

  body: "Hi Hrant, \r\nYou can buy a classic Approval for under a grand, but it is
    a little smaller than the 1984 380Sl my wife has. Approval prints run the gamut,
    but I think Tabloid should run $35.00 if you are not in a rush. They are pretty
    available, not everyone uses them for contract proofing and Inkjets are quickly
    biting away because of the cost per print. I've seen legal size (5 pt) type printing
    black on a yellow  and it was indistinguishable from film output. I have had Latran/Polar
    proofs made and they were great too, with 7pt serif (Bemtus from URW) knockout
    type being sharp as a razor.\r\nFor line art an old lino(or Agfa or Monoype, or
    screen or scitex, or\r\nRipit/Exxtra etc) work wonders even at Level 1 postscript.
    You get a level 3 RIP just to be able to iron out any minor issues and Level 3
    is where most output devices are so you can have predictible results You don't
    have to calibrate if you are going for line work and a desktop imagesetter (Ripit/Exxtra)
    are no larger (and lighter) than a tabloid laser printer. A roll of film has about
    100' feet and can be had at around $80.00-$120.00.\r\nI had great experiences
    with L330s, Screens (very expensive even used), and Ripit/Exxtras. What I liked
    best about the Ripits is Adobe based RIP and ingenious flexible Drum,very accurate
    and light.\r\n\r\nActually the problem that Goren describes is more of a Toner
    and SPI than any acutal laser issue, it is doing its best, but given the resolution
    and that the dots have to be made with Toner make it heavier. Have you ever noticed
    that type gets lighter and lighter when you go from Laserprinter to the actual
    printed piece? This is even more noticlble with inkjets on offset/copier paper
    too.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Truth shall set you free"

    Approval print of sheet one of my tabloid-size Nour&Patria specimen. Goran was
    right, and that guy was wrong - it's quite impressive. I can't find any of my
    old velox prints to compare it to directly, but to the naked eye it looks way
    crisp enough. Looking at it with my 35x loupe, I can see that the black is not
    extremely black however: it has faint whitish spots spread about. What's most
    interesting though is the lack of aliasing - instead the outlines are a bit coarse,
    basically what photo paper does I guess. Ironically, I suspect this might actually
    make the naked-eye result even better, at least in terms of fidelity to the -eventual-
    offset output, but possibly even in terms of readability (where I happen to believe
    there's such a thing as too crisp). On the other hand there's still much to be
    said for seeing what you've made as crisply as possible - especially when it comes
    to judging a font's color.\r\n\r\nAs for the paper stock used, it has a slight
    off-white aspect, but also has a nice gentle matte feel, and most of all it's
    luxuriously thick: I measured it at 9 mils* which is almost as thick as a typical
    business card. This is I think about 3-4 times thicker than lino \"RC paper\",
    and probably twice as thick as velox.\r\n\r\n* With the Soviet micrometer I bought
    from Yerevan's flea market in October.  :-)\r\n\r\nThe bad news: the stuff is
    very expensive, about $120 for a tabloid print! :-/  Which makes it not cost-effective
    for \"internal\" specimens, but -considering the superb paper- probably just the
    ticket for showing off your fonts.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
