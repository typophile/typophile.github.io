  for Adobe Illustrator CS3?\r\n\r\nAlso, I know basic knowledge of the program, and
  have been trying to finish one of the tutorials off of this website: http://www.ndesign-studio.com/resources/tutorials/itune-icon/\r\n\r\nI
  am stuck at the part where it tells me to create a black to white gradient and to
  \"screen\" blend it onto the previous blend. Is there something I'm missing to achieve
  this? I have followed every step told to me, and when I blend the gradient with
  the shape it ends up looking deformed.\r\n"

    uses the word \"blend\" a little too much (or Adobe does)... The \"Blend\" they
    are referencing in the second section (after you make the grayscale gradient circle)
    is found in the TRANSPARENCY palette. Don't try to use the Object > Blend menu
    command or tool. The little pop-up menu at the top left of the transparency window
    lets you change how an object \"blends\" with other art below it... by setting
    it to \"Screen\", the gradient will only lighten up what it is on top of (the
    green note head).\r\n\r\nI'm not sure this is the best way to create this art.
    For one thing, it is referencing Illustrator version 9... you could create the
    3-D green globe a number of other ways in later versions of Illustrator.\r\n\r\nI'm
    curious as to why you don't use/follow the tutorials on the Illustrator discs,
    or the ones on Adobe's site?"

    disagree! There are a lot of very talented designers here with advanced knowledge
    of Illustrator and a plethora of other design programs from Adobe and more. Don't
    be afraid to ask a question about how to do something. You'll be surprised by
    how many people will be able to answer. Plus, they'd probably share more information
    on how to do it better!"

    And they are not costly.

  body: Mike, in addition to lynda.com, there is a great series of books from Adobe
    called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/index=stripbooks&field-keywords=adobe%20classroom%20in%20a%20book&results-process=default&dispatch=search/ref=pd_sl_aw_tops-1_stripbooks_4204023_2&results-process=default">Classroom
    in a Book</a>... I highly recommend them. They walk you through a series of projects
    and come with a CD that has finished and unfinished versions of each project.

    I just looked at the tutorial. What they mean by \"Screen blending mode\" is an
    option you select in the Transparency palette... All you have to do at that point
    in the tutorial is to select \"Screen\" from the pop-up menu (in the illustration
    that accompanies that step, look for the Transparency palette, and you'll see
    what I mean). Don't blend any gradients at that point.\r\n\r\nGood luck,\r\nRicardo"
