<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>As designers and typographers, we all encounter moments where we need to make a decision on the mixing and matching of typefaces. And as purveyors of the letterform, we also know that it is not just a matter of throwing two typefaces together.
While it is not a perfect science, establishing a good, functional match between two different typefaces is akin to striking design gold. It is an acquired skill to master as there are steadfast rules and tips to follow, but at the same time these rules need not hold back your creative sense of adventure.
The idea behind this thread was to start a dialogue where any us can discuss, inspire and display their favorites "mixes and matches" of typefaces. Pairs that have been your tried and true solutions in a pinch, or ones that are on the edge of reason yet still seems to ignite an excitement of our creative senses. The most conservative or the most experimental matches are welcome
I'd would like to begin with a pair of typefaces that I recently felt has become a very tight and strong pairing after weeks of research and experimentation.
Berthold Akzidenz Grotesk with Hoefler text. A marriage of a mid-century classic to a modern take (and homage) to the typestyles of the Transitional Period.

<div class=commentbody>Good idea for a discussion, Alvin. It will be even more useful and revealing if there are some broad guidelines for those wanting to respond with samples of their pairs, such as: display the two typefaces in the same line or at least at the same size.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi Stephen,
As far as any guidelines, your suggestions are ideal
1. Displaying typefaces on the same line.
2. Displaying typefaces at the same size.
There is a lot of flexibility with this discussion as far as how one can display their samples. Other suggestions are as follows:
3. Show the typeface pairing in a text block sample (paragraph, headlines, etc.) that highlights the pairings.
4. A photo or screenshot of the typeface pairs in real use (current or past projects, logos, etc.).
5. A photo or screen shot of found typography pairs (signage, billboards, posters, ads, etc.).
6. Or even as simple just having a single word formatted in each typeface sample next to each other.
Also, if anyone wants to really add to this thread, they can also explain why they feel their samples works for them.
Hope to see some great pairs!
~ A
