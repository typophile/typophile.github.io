  one, where the P and R are matched to the mid pin in the E and with a matching C
  as well.\r\n\r\nAnyone else recognise the exact font used for this metal lettering?\r\n\r\nI've
  tried my best to clean up the original photo and turn it into black on white, but
  of course it's supposed to be all clean and not \u201Cweathered\u201D.\r\n\r\nAnd
  given that it's metal lettering on a wall, it may of course not even be a font,
  per se, but I thought I'd at least check if anyone here recognises this one.\r\n\r\nCheers!"
