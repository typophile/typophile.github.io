  this project for a friend of mine who has started his own architecture firm. He
  wants to show a \"fluidity in work while sticking to the rules\" sort of approach
  in their work. So far of all the sketches I made he likes the one that's attached
  with this post.\r\n\r\nBTW, the firm's name is 'CE' \r\n\r\nPlease be unmerciful
  with your feedback. I am really look forward to them!!"

    agree that a nicely treated typography based logo is always one of the best bets.\r\n\r\nIn
    this case however I want the mark to have an identifiable quality & an \"abstract
    while obvious\" sort of thing going on with it in keeping with the company's approach.
    I plan to add the company name in a suitable type & at the most appropriate location
    as well, once I am satisfied about the mark. \r\n\r\nBut I will keep your suggestion
    in mind. I will definitely try out a few logos, experimenting with only the company
    name, CE in this case, set in a suitable typefaces and will upload them soon. "

  body: "Yeah, I love the idea, but I'm usually partial to that kind of idea so there's
    that. But it seems to me that it has to be further developed. Somehow, something's
    missing; I see it as not yet strong enough.\r\n\r\nI also don't think blkkkkk's
    examples are great\u2026 in fact, I think they're all pretty weak when compared
    with something like what you're showing, in terms of concept and of graphic strength
    and interest. But again, and as aluminum said, I'm \u201Cbored\u201D with this
    constant use of industrial-like grotesques in all caps. It screams nothing. It's
    like shouting silently or with nothing to say. It's just lifeless. It kind of
    plays along with a sense of nihilism which is common in this day and age \u2013
    and which I thoroughly understand but usually try to fight \u2013, like it's saying
    \u201Clife has no meaning and nothing really matters; I'll scream, but I won't
    ignore that\u201D. But that might be what you're looking for and it does have
    its uses, of course. \r\n\r\nSo I'd somehow play around with your idea a bit more.
    Maybe try to make it something like the second alternative but strengthen the
    notion of it being a volume, which might not be readily seen the way it is now.\r\n\r\nBut,
    if you're aware of the possible shortcomings of what you've got there, such as
    the one I said and the fact that the letters might not be immediately perceived,
    and that's what you were going for, then I think you could probably stick with
    that second one and leave it at that. Then maybe you could make some use of the
    first one in developing the mark to make it stronger and wider-ranging in some
    application, but I think the second could be a final stand-alone mark. Just remember
    that if you're going to add text to that then you'll probably need to use some
    thin type that doesn't overpower the mark."

  body: "I think awsamosa's submission to the forum is simple. The examples you gave,
    however, in my opinion, the way I see things, are not really simple; just dismissive
    of any thought, lazy. When I look at those I just think the designers, whoever
    they are, were only giving in to a trend, and one which, as is common with trends,
    is so diluted that might have lost its meaning and strength. I'm familiar with
    MVRDV and their work and have thought about their logo before and \u201Ccriticized\u201D
    it to friends precisely because of this, because I think the logo doesn't do them
    justice at all; the other ones I wasn't familiar with, but still, only one of
    them wasn't following that same pattern, and I considered that one still not unique
    enough to be remarkable.\r\nI don't see any real thought put into those, and I
    see some thought put into awsamosa's mark. That's how I was disagreeing with what
    you said. I wasn't criticizing you, I was just trying to show awsamosa another
    way of looking at what was on the table. This isn't about you\u2026\r\nI'm sorry
    if I didn't make myself clear and if I in any way came off as offensive towards
    your opinion and ideas.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I'd like to emphasize that I was
    once asked to design a logo/mark for an architect friend and I think awsamosa's
    idea isn't exactly new and wonderfully original (I thought about something along
    those lines, too, but with far less success), but I do think it does easily beat
    grotesques in all caps. (BTW, that project of mine is still unfinished business
    precisely because of the challenge this can be and also because it really wasn't
    that urgent.)"

    Alaskan,\r\n\r\nThanks for the great link! \r\n\r\nTried out some variations with
    the weight and also the feel of the space. I didnt want the enclosed space to
    become very hard and heavy so was going for a lighter stroke. I did alter the
    stroke width a little bit though. Here are the results.  basically I have just
    made the strokes more blockier and/or heavier. Anything worth pursuing in these?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/POST

    last post, alt 1 is way to generic. Alt 2 is interesting, though. But I get a
    completely different vibe with that than I do with your first logo. Your first
    logo (to me, at least) says \"modern architecture\" or \"engineering\" while the

    strokes in view 2 (caused by perspective) bothers me as it's so slight that it
    almost looks like a rendering error. I know its deliberate, but try making them
    truly parallel and see if that helps.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't make the strokes any thinner
    than they are in view 2, as when they become thinner (like in view 1) they start
    resembling a weird pitchfork.\r\n\r\nYou might find this article on logo trends
    helpful as it shows several examples (in the \"Hexahedron\" section) of 3D shapes
    rendered with translucent elements, similar to what you're doing:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.logolounge.com/logotrends/\r\n\r\n\r\n"
