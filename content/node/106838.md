  body: Upon careful examination, I'm fairly sure that's the number "8.0".  The narrow
    shape of the zero strongly favors numerals over other interpretations.

    if you put the image upside down?\r\nThe direction I took the picture isn't necessary
    the direction of the text."

  body: "Initially, the legend appeared, obviously, to be \"S. C.\", to me. But when
    you look closely at the \"S.\", the top part appears to be a smaller C in its
    own right, and the bottom part a single character, shaped like a scythe, with
    the . as its handle.\r\n\r\nIt appears to be the camera's rewind knob, but that's
    R\xFCckspulknopf in German, so the meaning of the abbreviation remains unclear.\r\n\r\nLooking
    again at the photo, this is definitely the rewind knob, at least if the camera
    is a Leica I, II, or III. Leica did not label this knob, however. Also, note the
    angle the letters make with the arrow, and the small arc below the C, indicating
    an earlier attempt to strike the letters. I would suggest that since Leicas are
    expensive cameras, these are the initials of a previous owner, stamped into the
    rewind knob."

    camera is former Luftwaffe and we are trying to  match it to a certain\r\nplane/group.\r\n\r\nIf
    you follow this link, you can enlarge the image to it's original size:\r\n\r\nhttp://smg.photobucket.com/user/HellraiserIII/media/Leica/DSCN1035_zpsa3317bc7.jpg.html?sort=4&o=4\r\n\r\nDidn't
    encounter to me that it could be an attempt to strike the letters!\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: Hmm... Might be intended to be PB. The knob looks rounded or conical so getting
    a good strike would not be easy.
