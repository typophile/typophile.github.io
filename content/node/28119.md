  did something I KNOW I should not have done... I tried to install 6000 fonts...
  all at once... and they made it into my font folder (I am working on a mac -- OS-10)\r\n\r\nAnd....
  I loaded In-design....  and now I cant use ANY of my fonts except for the ones that
  actually came with the computer....\r\n\r\nI have opened font book and it has taken
  it 10 minutes to load all of them, and now I dont know how to sort them, or which
  ones to delete..... Is there some sort of default setting I can revert to?\r\n\r\nThis
  isn't my computer, its my work computer and If my boss finds out I broke it, Im
  DEAD MEAT!\r\n\r\nWHat can I do BESIDES going through them one by one....."

  body: Where did you get 6,000 fonts? I would take them all out of the font folder,
    and install only a core set that you know you need and go from there. I wouldn't
    panic, I think you probably just have too many fonts in there and InDesign is
    having trouble reading all of them. I'm sure someone else here will have some
    better advice. But that's my 2 cents...

    type... and removed all of the ones that matched the kind I downloaded.....and
    I just pulled them all out.\r\n\r\nBUT now I am missing half of the fonts I DO
    USE.... AND my default internet fonts are messed up. (ANyone know how to fix that?)\r\n\r\noh
    and 6000 fonts came from a [link removed by moderator], for $7.95,  AND this was
    all stemmed because I NEED ONE certain font... I used once a few years ago....
    in a galaxy far far away..\r\n\r\nSO I downloaded the fonts thinking I could scroll
    through them in fontbook, and FIND THAT ONE FONT. \r\n\r\nI decided that 6000
    fonts shouldnt be THAT much of a problem, (but I knew I was taking a risk.)"

    unkind works.\r\n\r\nI operate three workstations. If any employee (or freelancer)
    did that to one of my computers, I would freak. I know, and have accepted, all
    the licences of fonts and of applications on my computers.\r\n\r\nThat an employee
    would, without discussion or consultation, add fonts to the computer they were
    assigned causes me grave concern. I don't know the EULAs they have (or have not)
    accepted. I don't know where these fonts or applications have come from. Whether
    they are legit or pirated. Or full of viruses. So. Nothing is put on my computers
    that I don't know about. Ever. \r\n\r\nDo you disagree?"

    since Desiree seems to be unaware of it and has not posted otherwise, why the
    moderators have not pointed out to her that such sharing is illegal (especially
    since Typophile has a stated policy). Desiree's concern was that she had screwed
    up her boss's computer not that she had done something unethical or illegal. I
    can perfectly understand trying to help her out of her mess but it also seems
    a missed opportunity.\r\n\r\nGerald"

    helping you solve the posted problem. But, the fact remains, as Gerald pointed
    out, that most of the fonts which you have are illegal and derivative works. Please
    support the foundries that did the work in the first place and license directly
    from them. \r\n\r\nI hope my original post did help you and that you were able
