  about [[http://www.flickr.com/photos/criminalintent/2744038788/sizes/l/| THIS]]
  engraved type. \r\n\r\nIt's obviously hand-done and possible one-of-a-kind. How
  would one classify the style? Is it art nouveau? Have any of you seen fonts like
  this?\r\n\r\nAny info would be useful!\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: It reminds me of [[Adrian Frutiger|Frutiger]]'s <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/linotype/pompeijana_std_roman/">Pompeijana</a>
    and Bouwsma's <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/creative_alliance/pompeii_capitals/">Pompeii
    Campitals</a> both <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/pompeijana/roman/?refby=typographica">modeled
    after early Roman inscriptions</a> and perhaps named for those found in the architectural
    ruins of Pompeii.

  body: Stephen's suggestion of Pompeijana is likely the closest you'll find, but
    I thought I'd mention other fonts in this Rustic Roman style. <a href="http://www.mouserfonts.com/Showcase/mous001.htm"
    target="_blank">Mouserfonts</a> offers, among lots of other wonderful freebies,
    Rustic Capitals and <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/browse/person/scarpitti/michael/"
    target="_blank">Michael Scarpitti</a> hs made several fonts in this vein for SCriptorium.
