  for the <em>T</em>,<em>t</em>,<em>L</em> and <em>l</em> and maybe the <em>K</em>
  and <em>k</em>.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tl-lines_samples-noblue_5943.resized.png]

  body: I was just looking for shaded type like this a few weeks ago, and my search
    was not so fruitful. The best I turned up was <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/lexon-gothic/lexon-xylo/>Lexon
    Xylo</a>, along with <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/treasury/>Treasury</a>,
    <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ihof/p22-zebra/line-cut/>P22 Zebra Line Cut</a>,
    <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/chevalier/>Chevalier</a>, and <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/calypso/>Calypso</a>.
    But I'm hopeful that as usual someone will know something I don't.

  body: "I don't want shaded type; I meant for those lines to be of equal length and
    weight. I want the type to be designed such that it doesn't need outlines and
    that the lines can be of mostly equal length.\r\n\r\nIt should probably be based
    on some style of writing in which the angle of the pen doesn't change."

  body: Since you are only looking for a small number of letters, and you know exactly
    what you want, why don't you have a go at drawing them! You can't really go wrong
    with straight lines!

  body: "I do agree with 1985, you don't have always to use other people fonts!\r\nWhy
    don t you give your drawing a try? You'll get better and faster because you already
    know what you have in mind and it isn't that hard to draw those letters.\r\n\r\nJoel

  body: "I don't really have something in mind; I just wrote them like that because
    I looked through a calligraphy book and chose one style in which mostly parallel
    lines of equal length could be used to write the letters. I wanted to see other
    ways that this had been done.\r\n\r\nI guess this hasn't been done, though, so
    I should change my request: I want ideas of other writing styles in which these
    letters could neatly be constructed with mostly parallel lines of equal length.\r\n\r\nActually,
    anything without lots of curves should work if I let the lines overlap a lot,
    and this should allow me to choose from a rather wide range of styles, but I still
    feel like some style should work particularly well."

    all my Spanish documents used a font similiar, though they were almost exclusively
    on checks, and so I don't have an example...maybe someone else can post one.  But
    it wasn't just parallel, it was all vertical.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una
