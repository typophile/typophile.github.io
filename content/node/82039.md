body: "Being a book addicted, I've decided to start posting some pictures of what
  I believe are some of the finest examples of printed books taken from my library
  - and I invite you to do the same in this or another thread. This means fine typography
  but also particular binding methods, illustrations, typefaces, way of printing,
  and more. Pictures can't tell the physical form of books the but they can reveal
  their beauty.\r\n\r\nI start with an out of stock book I just found in an antiquarian
  store. It's the first Western translation ever of Pavel Florenskij's masterpiece
  \"The Pillar and Ground of the Truth\", originally published in Russia in 1924 and
  translated in Italian in 1974 with an introductory essay by the great Elemire Zolla.
  It's a 600 pages hardcover book printed in the gloriuos metal Simoncini Garamond,
  with a very nice, minimal dust jacket using ornaments and - I guess - a Monotype
  Garamond. A great holder for one of XX century's most penetrating mind.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/P5093249_6555.JPG]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/P5093255_6466.JPG]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/P5093256_5082.JPG]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/P5093259_5552.JPG]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/P5093260_3956.JPG]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/P5093261_3524.JPG]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/P5093263_5343.JPG]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/P5093254_4012.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/P5093266_3673.JPG]"
