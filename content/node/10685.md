body: I think I prefer the italic. It works a tiny bit better. In both the italic
  and the Roman the &#39;h&#39; keeps jumping out at me &#40;same as in the nasty
  &#39;Dwiggins Uncial thing&#39;&#41;. He could have used a &#39;h&#39; with an ascender.
  Not many words in English with &#39;h&#39; and &#39;l&#39; next to each other. It
  wouldn&#39;t have messed up his plans too much.  <BR>The &#39;f&#39; and the &#39;g&#39;

    is all about intuition.</i> <BR> <BR>Okay, we have different definitions of intuition.
    In the case of the M-formula, I see a purely logical path, based on observation
    and experience, from the marionette to the typeface, as explained by Dwiggins
    in his own words. If this connection had been made by someone with only a passing
    knowledge of either marionette or type making, then I&#39;d ascribe it to intuition.
    In the case of someone like Dwiggins, who was intimately and daily involved in
    the making of both marionettes and type, the connection might even seem to be
    an obvious one. Perhaps the lesson in this is that type designers benefit from
    having other hobbies. <BR> <BR>Re. Dwiggins uncial: one of its bastard children

    <BR>On the other hand, readability is all about <i>contrast</i>. Otherwise we&#39;d
    read all-caps better. Conscious deliberative appreciation of the page is not strongly
    correlated to subconscious immersive reading. <BR> <BR>&#62;&#62; &#34;it would

    <BR>What I see different here is that WAD was not in fact intimately involved
    in the making of <i>very small</i> type &#40;where my &#34;subvisible&#34; came
    from&#41;, at least at that point - that&#39;s why the connection he made seems
    so impressive. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>BTW, maybe &#34;illogical&#34; was the wrong
    idea. But he was still wrong about extenders, and he had enough information that
    he didn&#39;t need to be - it&#39;s just a matter of looking for it. Something
    lacking even more today! So maybe in comparison to us WAD <i>was</i> more analytical
    after all...  :-/ <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: The M-formula as laid out in the document of July 3, 1937, is a typically
    engaging expression of WAD&#39;s ideas along these lines; but it was not a sudden
    epiphany on Dwiggins part. Neither was it formulated specifically in relation
    to newspaper designs, as one might infer from Unger&#39;s article. I have evidence
    of at least two earlier documents outlining some of the same ideas -- although
    neither of these specifically mentions marionettes. One of these, in fact, from
    February of the same year, is essentially a proto-M-formula. I haven&#39;t tracked
    down the drawings to see whether he put these ideas into practice before the July
    document. The application of the theory to small, newspaper types came about a
    year later. <BR> <BR>My point is that the M-formula is a culmination of thinking
    that WAD had been doing in this direction for about two years. <BR> <BR>-- K.

  body: To get back to Dwiggins and logic/intuition &#40;after a very short nap&#41;.
    I think the most serious attack we can make on him in relation to the above experiment
    concerns the serious anachronism inherent in his perception of the Irish-English/semi-uncial
    as an essentially &#39;English&#39; letter. I&#39;m wondering what the level of
    scholarship was like on that sort of thing in the 1940s? What sources might he
    have been using? <BR> <BR>In the 8th and 9th centuries the &#39;English&#39; he&#39;s
    talking about didn&#39;t exist yet. Letter frequency statistic are completely
    different for Old English and Modern English, so his theory about the suitability
    of semi-uncial is way off. On top of that, the letter forms he&#39;s talking about
    were developed for use in Latin texts and not English &#40;or even Irish&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>But I love it anyway. To hell with logic. <BR> <BR>Matha.

  body: Tiffany, <i>Book Fancier</i> is a Dwiggins text that, as far as I know, was
    never published. It was probably never completed. It comprised a series of essays
    on the various elements of a book. I have a copy of the section on Design, which
    was used in the first setup proof of Eldorado. I&#39;ve seen little bits from
    the section on Paper that were used in some test proofs of the second Falcon.  <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;d never come across this section on Type. This looks like it&#39;s an
    early draft &#40;and seriously in need of an editor&#41;. Too bad you don&#39;t

    experimental type design at ATypI 94 in San Francisco. It is truly hideous, and
    also very difficult to read due to the almost complete absence of extenders. Basically,
    Ricketts took the view that all legibility was in the x-height ergo one could
    dispense with ascenders and descenders. It is, perhaps, an object lesson in the
    importance of the distinction between legibility and readability.

    as I remembered it. It is still pretty horrid, but does not display the bloated
    x-height and truncated extenders that I must be remembering from something else.
    Unfortunately, the illustration is not captioned, so I can&#39;t be absolutely
    certain that this is the King&#39;s type, but it makes sense in the context of
    Dwiggin&#39;s comments. Also, the title of the work is The Kingis Quair. <BR>
