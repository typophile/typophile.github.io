  body: 'The cut details in top and bottom of stems are interesting. Just some quick
    observations: (a) S needs work, its curves seem irregular; (b) r is too wide;
    (c) your ft ligature actually appears to be a long s+t ligature. Even if you don''t
    include long s in the font, this may be confusing.'

  body: "I've changed it around a little but to make it a bit more refined. The kerning
    is still wrong: especially at small sizes it looks too cramped, and the width
    of the space is too wide. But in any event, I would appreciate your opinions on
    this latest revision.\r\n\r\n\t\r\nhttp://typophile.com/files/Type Specimen.pdf\r\n"

  body: "I'd like to see a bit less weight on the horizontals.  looks lovely though,
    nice one! \r\nsee you are from gold coast?  I'm studying in Brisbane, nice to
    see another student(?) from my neck of the woods working on type design."

  body: "New Revision (12/Sept/2010): http://typophile.com/files/SpecSheet.pdf\r\n\r\nThis
    version differs significantly from the ones I have uploaded previously. Strokes
    now thin when they near the verticals, giving the font a look that reminds me
    of the Danish State Railways (DSB) font, and, for some odd reason, Kontrapunkt.\r\n\r\nYour
    comments would be most appreciated on how this is progressing!\r\n\r\nKind regards\r\nCale"

  body: "Good overall feel, looks especially good at larger sizes. I like the m, o
    and a especially and the cuts on the m, n, etc. look great. \r\n\r\nNot entirely
    keen on the w; I think the right hand stem makes it look too much like an upside
    down m. The bowl of the uppercase R seems a tiny bit too tall - I'd like to see
    it maybe a little bit smaller to make it less identical to that of the P (looking
    at word 'APPROACHES' here). The f seems to interact somewhat awkwardly with the
    other letters ('fun', 'coffee', 'shuffle) but maybe some looser spacing would
    help this. \r\n\r\nComing along nicely!\r\n- Claire\r\n"
