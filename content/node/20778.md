  but this should give you a good idea.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve looked at Helvetica, Optima,
  URW Linear, etc., but they pretty much all look the same with the letters I have
  (\u201CKite & Key;\u201D possibly uppercase).  I would not presume to learn your
  craft in any meaningful way, I have tried to do my homework (\"RTFM\") by reading
  and browsing many design books and purchasing and reading Bringhurst 3.1, but only
  get stuck and overwhelmed.  Bringhurst was a disappointment, since he actively criticized
  logotype and focused mostly on typesetting books (preferably, it seems, books in
  history and the humanities).\r\n\r\nCan anyone suggest a good typeface? Linear also
  looks a bit like one of our suppliers/competitors.  I\u2019ve got hundreds of samples,
  but they are all starting to blur together.\r\n\r\nI'd like to use something with
  serifs, but that seems to clash with the modern spirit of \r\nthe glyph's design.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/05-25-MiddleURWLinearRegularShrink_3620.GIF]"

    be the first problem - the logo and the related type should work together and
    the best way to do that is to have them designed together.

  body: "Thanks everyone for the comments and suggestions.  I will continue to think
    about the suggested typefaces.\r\n\r\nAs to the designer's skills, she has done
    very good work on other projects, but seemed to struggle on mine.  I probably
    should have ejected a bit earlier, but she's young and I wanted her to get a \"win\"
    on this one (plus I know she can do some really good work).\r\n\r\nIn her defense,
    I was incredibly clueless about what I wanted at the beginning, and working with
    her has allowed me to get a pretty good grasp of what I'm after (I have another
    idea rather different from this one).\r\n\r\nAs to the \"clip art\" comment, the
    glyph reminds me of Apple, Motorola, Herman Miller, and Burton Snowboards, but
    I'm not in love with it and there's something else I'd like to try (I can explain
    it, but don't have the skills to produce it).\r\n\r\nI guess the lesson is that
    Paul Rand did several things that the client rejected, and there's no shame in
    realizing when something's not working and having an amicable parting of the ways."

    that sounds like your first problem :p I think you are spot on on this project
    though. The young designer helped you develop your ideas which is really i think
    the hardest part so you got your moneys worth in her. But now it's time to try
    other things. Send a thank you, a check and keep at it!\r\n\r\nSorry about the
    clip art comment. I really shouldn't have used that term without specifying more.
    I mean that the mark is not styleized. It looks like a default reversed key and
    lightening bolt. The problem with the companies that you mentioned is that they
    were made with that 80's corporate trend look- although they still have some style,
    like apple's apple.\r\n\r\nAlso the companies you mentioned are competing in different
    markets. Again It would be easier to give you advice if i knew more about your
    business. Drop me a line and I can try some concepts for ya when I get a bit of
    free time. Then if you like anything we can work something out.\r\n\r\njphillips@norcaldesigns.com"

    just a lightening bolt lighting up a double k ligature? Leave the key implied.

      and she has sent me some variations with the lightning angled differently, but,
      as mentioned, I've been very patient with her and it may be time to give another
      person a shot.\r\n\r\n\"a sans would be fine, but perhaps consider one with
      more variation\"\r\nThat's why I came here: I was looking for a sans with more
      variation. With the letters I have, most of the sans faces started to look almost
      indistinguishable; I'll consider the suggestions and am open to more.\r\n\r\n\"Also
      think about including a very sweepy ampersand\"\r\nI've considered this, and
      the ampersand has a long history of livening up dull sections of prose.  But
      my tentative conclusion is to search for an attractive but plain and unobtrusive
      ampersand that won't compete with the icon.  I want people's attention on the
      marque and the company name, not the ampersand, if possible.\r\n\r\nDo you know
      of a sweepy ampersand that won't dominate the design?  I'd like to see an example
      of what you had in mind.\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for the suggestions, j_polo9.  Just for accuracy, none of the logos
    I mentioned are from the 1980's: Herman Miller hails from the 1940s, Motorola
    from no later than the 1960's, Apple from the late 1970's, the Burton mark is
    from probably the last 2 years, and Nalgene has recently adopted something very
    similar: \"Paul Rand with attitude\" is quite the rage in some circles these days,
    at least as far as a nerd like me can tell.  The half-century plus between Herman
    Miller and Burton says something longevity of such simple designs.\r\n\r\nAgain,
    no offense about \"clip art.\"  It's good to get honest feedback from disinterested
    parties (most people, even strangers on the street \"make nice\u201D).\r\n\r\nYour
    point about the relative size of key and lightning is good...I want the mark to
    be distinguishable at a distance / small sizes / low resolution, which, with this
    illustration, led to a big key.  And a simply reducing the size of the key actually
    looked worse than this.  I do like how the angles subtly mirror the letter \"K.\"\r\n\r\nAs
    far as the brainstorms, the designer proposed no shortage of concepts, including
    many very similar to yours, some of which looked pretty good.  But we rejected
    them in favor of a graphical icon and distinctive, but relatively unmodified,
    logotype.  So we don't need more concepts, just execution, and are very close
    to hiring someone else to do a very different-looking variation on some of the
    same basic ideas.\r\n\r\nAs the company name includes the word \"kite,\" a graphic
    of a kite is considered superfluous.\r\n\r\nThanks again for the help; I will
    try to update this as we progress."

    what did you expect? You hired a junior designer to create your identity and gave
    her no real direction about what you wanted your mark to do. After much talk about
    Paul Rand, Apple and Herman Miller logos, Bringhurst and Glyphs she's was graciously
    given the task of formulating some workable concepts for you. Since she's inexperienced
    and doesnt know better, she goes off on a whole gamut of concepts, rather than
    clarifying what needs to be communicated. At this point, you've probably spent
    a long time developing and seen hundreds of treatments, you still dont have what
    you want (because you dont know), and you settle for basically a wordmark and
    an illustration of that name. So now you've taken one of HER designs and offered
    it up here for an overhaul.\r\n\r\nGood design doesnt work that way. And I suspect
    you know that. It seems you have an appreciation for good design, but dont realize
    what a designer requires to achieve it. \r\n\r\nHad you given her a clear design
    brief, with realistic expectations, and not saddled her with famously successful
    work as her goal, you may have gotten a good design that was meaningful and original.
    Surely, a win for both of your businesses."

      I am (hence my presence on Typophile).  But it could just be the case with this

      you read my original post, I was <strong>not</strong> asking for an overhaul

      the logo (with Linear: my choice, not the designer\u2019s) so that people could
      recommend appropriate typefaces for it; it was other posters who called the
      icon into question, and I have defended it.\r\n\r\n<cite>Good design doesnt
      work that way. And I suspect you know that. It seems you have an appreciation
      for good design, but dont realize what a designer requires to achieve it.\r\n\r\nGuilty
      as charged!  Yet where would you expect an engineer turned salesman turned entrepreneur
      to learn this?\r\n\r\nI have admitted that working with this designer has given
      us a much more concrete idea of what we need.  We were really planning to use
      this icon, and still may.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve been here defending the designer
      quite a bit, and in her further defense, this was kind of a low-budget project.\r\n\r\nI
      still think that she is very talented, and would be horrified if anyone thought
