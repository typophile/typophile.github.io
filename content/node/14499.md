body: "The alphabet used by the Romans. Sometimes called [[Latin]], the [[Latin Alphabet]],
  or [[Roman]] (see [[Alphabets]]).\r\n\r\nThe Roman's picked up the concept of an
  alphabet either, directly or indirectly, from the Greeks during the eigth century
  BC. Over time, they would evolve it into what we now think of as [[capital]] or
  [[uppercase]] letters. The Roman alphabet reached its final form sometime during
  the Republican era, although [[serifs]] would be added a bit later.\r\n\r\nBy the
  reign of the Emperor [[Trajan]] in the second century AD, the alphabet had certainly
  long been \"finished\". Nethertheless, letters would later be added to it during
  the Middle Ages (W and Z, for instance).\r\n\r\nRoman handwriting differed significantly
  from inscriptional lettering. Over time, handwriting styles evolved into what we
  think of as various [[uncial]] styles, which later influenced the [[Carolingian
  Minuscule]] around the year 800. These letterforms would be paired with Roman inscriptional
  forms\u2014\"[[lowercase]]\" the the older \"uppercase\"\u2014during the Renaissance.\r\n\r\nRoman,
  and later Christian, conquests spread the Roman alphabet far outward from Italy.
  Today, it is one of the most-used writing systems in the world."
