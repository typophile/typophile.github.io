  hand-rendered look and an illustrative style. \r\n\r\nI am trying to design an italic
  to complement the regular style i have sketched.\r\nThis question has bothered me
  for awhile, and in my type readings I am yet to find an answer. What aspects/features
  of an italic relate it to the regular or even make it belong to its family. Is it
  supposed to relate to the roman. \r\nI understand that italic derived from scribes
  needing to reproduce books etc. at a faster pace, but surely there must be a reason
  why garamond italic belongs to garamond family and not caslon.\r\n\r\nI apologize
  if this is confusing, i'm tired, and having trouble forming coherent sentences. "

  body: "Good question. To a companion roman, an italic should have consistent heights
    of upper and lowercase, as well as figure height and other character alignment.
    The spacing and weight of the two should be optically equivalent, which means
    they appear to be about the same, (the trickiest part). The italic should be offset
    so an italic word set amongst roman will balance between roman words. The design
    of the uppercase forms should be within the same class, i.e. you would use the
    same serif structure for uppercases in both. the lowercase structure can have
    more variety between roman and italic, by tradition, but you wouldn't e.g. make
    the lowercase tails, terminals or serifs much wider, heavier or contrasting than
    the roman. Whatever kind of stress, or pen angle, that is apparent in the roman
    should follow in the italic, despite the angle of the italic stems. \r\n\r\nYou
    could think of this as if you were writing the fonts, and didn't want anything
    but emphasis to change, or not. ;)\r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: "My position is a pain to defend in public, but I stand by it like some crazed
    Japanese soldier in a tree: in terms of \"belonging\" to its roman (which is what
    an italic in a text face needs to primarily do) the best an italic can do is a
    be a slanted version of the roman, albeit with two important twists:\r\n1) Aesthetics:
    some features (like double-sided serifs) don't look good slanted, and some glyphs
    (like your average bicameral \"a\") look lousy too. Those need to be fixed.\r\n2)
    Differentiation: some slanted glyphs (especially if you like your slants slight
    like I do) need extra help not to be confused for a roman glyph.\r\n\r\nSo the
    slanted-roman I'm proposing is nothing like what ATF did and Morison proselytized;
    it's much more like what the Deberny foundry was doing in France towards the end
    of the 19th century and some German foundries were doing in the first quarter
    of the 20th century.\r\n\r\nI've done something in this vein as well:\r\nhttp://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&patria/dev/nour-latin.gif\r\n\r\nEssentially,
    I would caution against the mainstream parroting of \"an italic must be cursive\"*,
    because cursiveness is almost guaranteed to lend an atmosphere to the italic that
    the roman does not share. We need to find something more sensical, and really
    slant capably does all the heavy lifting.\r\n\r\n* Which leads to dysfunctional
    banalities like \"upright italics\". Gag.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "<em>To a companion roman, an italic should have consistent heights of upper
    and lowercase...</em>\r\n\r\nI'm sure David meant to say <em>visually</em> consistent
    heights. There is an optical effect that can make a slanted letter look taller
    than an upright letter when they are mathematically the same height. This is because
    the actual stroke length of a slanted form is longer than that of a vertical form.
    In particular, one may want to make the actual height of the italic lowercase
    slightly shorter than that of the roman, to compensate for this effect. This must
    be judged visually.\r\n\r\n<em>Whatever kind of stress, or pen angle, that is
    apparent in the roman should follow in the italic, despite the angle of the italic
    stems.</em>\r\n\r\nThat's a solid approach, but I think a more basic observation
    would be to say that the stroke construction model should be the same -- even
    if the actual 'pen angle' were allowed to vary. Note that this observation doesn't
    imply a strictly chirographic approach: whatever 'idea' is used to regulate the
    construction of the roman letters should be applied to the italic letters in order
    to make the two work together."

  body: "It's not the the differences or commonalities between an italic and a roman,
    per se, it's the ratio of one to the other. This is particularly true if one is
    jettisoning the cursive model for an \"oblique and tweak\" approach as the reader
    has just lost a lifetime of learning that cursive equals italic. \r\n\r\nA related
    and interesting historical study might be how italics were married to romans in
    the centuries before families (font families, not mom, dad, and that short aunt
    who smoked too much). Upon what did they base their choices? I fear much of it
    was simple availability, but even then the printers were probably going down the
    same criteria checklist. \r\n\r\n\"Oblique and tweak\" is more fun to say than
    to read, by the way."

    do you do? I also don't apply your suggestion to uppercase, where the italic length
    of stroke is also greater than roman, but composition often demands Roman and
    Italic in proximity too close for a height difference of any kind or the serifs
    clink. I got screwed on that one twice by clients mixing the two in words... :)\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    \r\n\r\nMr. Berlow,\r\nAre you suggesting a greater discrepancy between mathematical
    (actual) heights of a roman to an accompanying ital when the faces in question
    are display? Is this strictly a question of size?  \r\n\r\nI'm not a novice and
    was well aware itals should be a bit short to optically appear right; but I had
    considered that the amount of difference would be more or less when designing
    display fonts."

    is only the x-height optical difference that seems to cause a problem, e.g. when
    you have one word set in italics in the midst of roman text. Cap height and also
    extender length don't seem to matter much, and variance might be accepted as a
    stylistic feature of the italic. But if the x-height is not optically adjusted
    it can result in something that looks like a change in font size."

    (and \"undershoot\"). [DB, correct me if I'm misinterpreting.]\r\n\r\nThat's how
    I make sense of what he's saying. In larger scales, the amount of overshoot required
    for rounds to appear the same height as squares/flats is proportionally less than
    at small text sizes. This also affects the relative alignments and perceived heights
    of italic l.c. (where there are relatively few flats at x-ht, for most traditional
    styles, with f and t being the main determinors).\r\n\r\nAlso, I would say that
    the degree of slant makes a difference. The greater the angle from the vertical,
    the more the optical illusion that John describes will come into play (since the
    strokes become proportionately longer as the diagonal becomes greater).\r\n\r\n--

    just dogma. Of course, if you are designing a text typeface, most people will
    expect you to follow the rules, one of them is to provide the basic four styles:
    roman, bold, italic, bold-italic. Anyway, you said it is a display face, so maybe
    the rules don't even apply. Anyhow it's always good to review dogma from time
