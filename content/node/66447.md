  body: "The trouble is, though, that a punctuation mark indicating sarcasm is most
    sorely needed with things like USENET postings, which are viewed by other people
    in a typeface of their choosing.\r\n\r\nThe sort of sober printed material which
    makes it to paper... or even to Adobe Portable Document Format (.pdf) files...
    generally has no need for a punctuation mark of this nature, since any irony will
    not be so off-the-cuff as to be likely to be missed. Thus, while this product
    may achieve <em>publicity</em>, it lacks a well-defined market."

    idea is daft on so many levels it is hard to know where to begin. How about the
    idea of trademarking a punctuation sign? You want people to use this? You want
    it to be possible to use it on a computer? You want this to be included in standard
    character sets? You want this to be included in fonts? Trademark is a barrier
    to all these things. A complete non-starter."

  body: "You want to sell a few T-shirts with the symbol on it? Trademark helps <em>that</em>.\r\n\r\nI
    don't think there is a serious intent to get the SarcMarc added to all the fonts
    the way the Euro symbol was (despite being trademarked) - although if Microsoft
    were to offer him a pile of money for permission to do so, I'm sure he would take
    it.\r\n\r\nFor the moment, though, we can always just use an existing punctuation
    mark which had once been suggested for the purpose, according to one of the news
    articles about the SarcMarc.\r\n\r\nSo instead of posting \"This statement is
    false (grin).\", I can just say \"This statement is false\xA1\" since \xBF is
    upside-down instead of mirror-reflected, the <em>other</em> old suggestion that
    article mentioned."
