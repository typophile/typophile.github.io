  seem to remember being able to generate this effect in Photoshop CS3's Filter menu,
  under \"3D\".\r\n\r\nBut how can I do this in CS4??\r\n\r\n\"3D\" now has it's own
  menu in CS4 and I can't find the old -- admitedly crappy -- 3D functionality.\r\n\r\nHow
  can I do this with Photoshop CS4? \r\n\r\nDo I need a plugin? \r\n\r\nDo I need
  to \"extend\" CS4?"

    to the right and 3 mm down, then sending it to the back and finally, giving the
    front one a white fill with a black stroke of (say) 1pt?

  body: I've never seen a simple way to do this in Photoshop (I jumped from CS2 to
    CS4) but you can do in Illustrator like Jonathan said.

  body: "Thanks, people.\r\n\r\nWell, my good old CS3 had the 3D \"Bevel & Extrude\"
    function in the Filter menu. But it got dropped in CS4.\r\n\r\nI am definitely
    looking for a quick one-shot way to do this. I guess Illustrator is the way to
    go. :-( What is sad is that it is still just the same old crappy tool, but now
    I gotta go back and forth to get it right.\r\n\r\nI did find an Electric Rain
    \"Swift 3D\" plugin that will do this -- and I'm sure it is a vast improvement
    over the old Adobe 3D Filter. But Swift 3D is $150 and... well, I've got Illustrator...
    so I guess I just have to regress my method. Oh well."
