body: "Hello, \r\n\r\nI have recently concluded my first font on Fontlab. It is a
  Latin base character. I have been testing out the font on programs, like Illustrator,
  and I have noticed a problem when I write the diacritics. Everytime I write the
  diacritic Illustrator automatically changes the font to Myriad. I have tried fixing
  the problem on Fontlab by going on the Glyph Properties window and assinging the
  OT to simple or ligatures, nothing works. \r\n\r\nI have inserted an image into
  this post to better illustrate my problem. \r\n\r\nThank you. "

  body: "To ask a pretty basic question:\r\nIn your font, did you include the glyphs
    using diacritics? (/atilde /aacute /agrave etc.)\r\nIt sounds like AI is falling
    back to Myriad, as the glyphs are not included."

  body: This is unfortunately pretty normal, try to apply the font from the menu again
    while keeping CTRL pressed. I guess you didn't set the right encodings in the
    font info.
