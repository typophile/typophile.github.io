body: "If we are to gauge, as proven, that we only need the upper extremities of the
  letter (from which all blessings flow, i.e. the Roman) then we must assume that
  there are subtle differences in their individual genetics which provide clues as
  to their identity (excluding the \u201CO\u201D and \u201CQ\u201D) when reading is
  performed. But Q is always followed by a U except in Qatar.\r\n\r\nJust a thought...
  If you shortened the left serif on the capital J, or the right serif on the capital
  L is shortened, or if you randomized the lengths of the serifs on the capital I
  then anarchy would ensue. As minute as they are they provide major clues to the
  \u201Cdivining (reading)\u201D process. This is lost in SANS. God forbid we should
  play with the height of the cross bar of the H. Hi would become III. Well, sort
  of.\r\n\r\nCan you imagine if we equalized the height of the X and Y. Pure bedlam!\r\nThe
  sky is falling!\r\n\r\nLong live the serif!\r\n\r\nMichael"

    more complex and therefore data rich... by Katharina. \r\n\r\nAlmost as profound
    as... The word and each of its constituent parts, is, after all both container
    and content. Michael O'Sullivan"

    because I felt it to be true, though I can't prove it.
