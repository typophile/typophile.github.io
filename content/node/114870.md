    on the right side), as that is where the type ID specialists hang out.

  body: "Heavy metal bands are popular among Americans born after WWII, and I suspect
    that they chose these fonts because of Fraktur's associations with Nazi Germany*.
    In other words, it symbolized something powerful and dangerous that Boomers' parents
    had fought against. What better symbol of adolescent rebellion could you ask for?\r\n\r\n(*Before
    the Nazis banned it in 1941)"

  body: "Victor tells the truth about the Fraktur ban. In 1941  Martin Bormann banned
    Fraktur in a Schrifterlass (edict on script) because it was \"Schwabacher Judenlettern\"\r\n---start
    quote---\r\n\"For general attention, on behalf of the F\xFChrer, I make the following
    announcement:\r\nIt is wrong to regard or to describe the so-called Gothic script
    as a German script. In reality, the so-called Gothic script consists of Schwabach
    Jew letters. Just as they later took control of the newspapers, upon the introduction
    of printing the Jews residing in Germany took control of the printing presses
    and thus in Germany the Schwabach Jew letters were forcefully introduced.\r\nToday
    the F\xFChrer, talking with Herr Reichsleiter Amann and Herr Book Publisher Adolf
    M\xFCller, has decided that in the future the Antiqua script is to be described
    as normal script. All printed materials are to be gradually converted to this
    normal script. As soon as is feasible in terms of textbooks, only the normal script
    will be taught in village and state schools.\r\nThe use of the Schwabach Jew letters
    by officials will in future cease; appointment certifications for functionaries,
    street signs, and so forth will in future be produced only in normal script.\r\nOn
    behalf of the F\xFChrer, Herr Reichsleiter Amann will in future convert those
    newspapers and periodicals that already have foreign distribution, or whose foreign
    distribution is desired, to normal script\".\r\n---end quote---\r\nMoreover, Herr
    Hitler, wannnabe classical architect,  seems to have always preferred the purity
    of text based on the Roman Trajan Letters. Note a Hitler declaration made in the
    Reichstag in 1934\r\n---start quote---\r\n    Your alleged Gothic internalisation
    does not fit well in this age of steel and iron, glass and concrete, of womanly
    beauty and manly strength, of head raised high and intention defiant ... In a
    hundred years, our language will be the European language. The nations of the
    east, the north and the west will, to communicate with us, learn our language.
    The prerequisite for this: The script called Gothic is replaced by the script
    we have called Latin so far ...\r\n---end quote--\r\nI pulled these quotes from
    a wiki: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiqua%E2%80%93Fraktur_dispute\r\nAnyway
    the love of blackletter by rock rebels and bikers seems to have missed the mark.\r\nDon\r\n"
