body: "hi there.\r\n\r\ni'm working a new logo for Tricific, a linen manufacturer
  and wholesaler. the company has been around for about 40 years and they wanted a
  new identity to show their history and success.\r\n\r\ni've come up with a simple
  logo that resembles a corner of a piece of fabric. the company sells a wide range
  of table cloths, napkins, bedsheets, and aprons, among other products, and i wanted
  to hint at the textile/linen nature of all these items without going into the details
  of stitching, threads, etc.\r\n\r\nfor the wordmark i've used minion bold and i'm
  trying to finalize the character spacing and logo size and position right now. any
  comments will be much appreciated. thanks a lot. \r\n\r\n[edit]\r\n\r\nok i've tried
  kerning the logo, but i'm not very good at it. could someone please give some pointers?
  please refer to logo3.jpg. thanks. "

  body: I like the second option the best, but the spacing still needs a little work.
    My eye is drawn to the IFI combo, as it seems spaced differently than the rest
    of the letters.

  body: "How does one pronounce the company name?  Try Siffic?  Trissiffick?\r\n\r\nThe
    second seems to work best for me as well.  Perhaps try a smallcaps version? \r\n\r\nAlso,
    check your spacing between the 'R' and the 'I'.  In fact, it looks as though the
    letterspacing is all the same..."

  body: "I think #1 or #2 are better than #3.  That one is too spaced out.  I've always
    found the best way to kern a logotype is to take it in 3 letter groupings at a
    time.  Get the TRI worked out, then do RIC, then ICI, CIF, IFI and finally FIC.
    \ That helps ensure an evenness.  Then you can go back and optically tweak everything
    to perfection.\r\n\r\nFor clarification, Tricific isn't a consumer brand, is it?
    \ If so, the whole thing seems a bit cold.  If it's just a manufacturer and supplier
    (i.e. B2B), then you're fine."

  body: "For kerning I would suggest printing it out and squinting at it from the
    top of the page (the characters are upside down, so you are not concentrating
    on the characters in a familiar setting, squinting reduces the amount of light
    that your eyes register so it should appear almost as a grey blur), the squinting
    should reveal any particularly dark or light patches, the aim is to reduce these
    areas.\r\nHowever, a small logo should have looser kerning than a big one (letterhead
    compared to side of a van) so you need to do this at approximately the correct
    size.\r\nAs a start get the RI correct (I think that is going to be the crucial
    pair) and then work the other characters until the squint technique shows that
    there aren\u2019t any significantly lighter or darker areas. Ultimately you don\u2019t
    want to reduce the readability, especially important with an unfamiliar word,
    so you might have to sacrifice some kerning.\r\nTim"
