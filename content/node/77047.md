  body: This would instantly remind me of the novels and essays printed in France
    during the XIXth century. They have a charm of their own, but Dinones are not
    legibility champions and they bear heavy connotations :) Whether it's a good thing
    or a bad thing, you decide.

    out that ITC Bodoni is not his work alone. He oversaw the project, but the drawings
    were done by a team of folks. From his own description:\r\n\r\n\u201CThe ITC Bodoni
    was produced by a team of designers, art directed by Sumner Stone. Holly Goldsmith
    designed the Six Roman; Janice Prescott-Fishman the Seventy-two Roman; Jim Parkinson
    the Six Italic; Mr. Stone the Seventy-two Italic, the Swash Capitals for the Seventy-two
    Italic, and the Ornaments. The Twelve point versions of the family were produced
    by computerized interpolation between the Six and Seventy-two point versions.\u201D\r\n\r\nJust
    thought I\u2019d clarify."

    for french publishing. Just one more barrier for my reading comprehension as I
    try to maintain my hard won 'francisasion'.\r\n\r\nActually, I have an 1809 book
    printed by Pierre Didot that is shockingly readable, french language not-with-standing."

    (i.e. the absolutely worthwhile books by Paul Rand).\r\nEspecially when printed
    on coated paper it is a pain to read!\r\nSo, if you choose Bodoni make sure you
    pick a variant/weight without too much contrast and/or a natural uncoated stock
    (maybe with some volume). Readability will probably benefit from dot gain."

  body: "The didone types are hard to master.\r\nThey are frequently criticized for
    poor readability, but IMO the fault generally lies with the typographer, not the
    face.\r\nThere is also prejudice, within some sections of the typographic community,
    against anything which is not an easy read.\r\n\r\nThe violin, it could be said,
    has poor listenability.\r\nIt is a difficult instrument to play, and to listen
    to.\r\nThe Bach Partita in D, for instance, is not background music.\r\nBut if
    it is played by a maestro, and one is prepared to apply some concentration, the
    entire piece may be listened to and the experience can be quite rewarding. "

  body: "There are a large number of Bodoni fonts out there. Berthold Bodoni Antiqua
    medium works OK for books. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.bertholdtypes.com/bq_library/90005.html\r\n\r\nLong
    ago, I made up a set of Bodoni Book fonts with os figs and small caps, based on
    whatever Adobe was offering. May have had to changed the contrast of the thick-thin
    strokes a little, I can't remember.\r\n\r\nI think the smallest master size from
    Sumner Stone would probably work for text. It may say six point, but with today's
    workflows (direct to plate), probably the best bet, even for an 11-point setting.\r\n\r\nAs
    with so many older fonts, all it takes is somebody sitting down and looking at
    the ink on the paper rather than the type forms. You can't quite duplicate the
    look of meal, but you can come close enough. The problems is most Bodoni's go
    for sparkle, and that means too high a contrast between the thick and thin strokes
    of the characters."

    text. I bet the contrast would be better, but the characters themselves a bit
    worse for a 10 or 11 point setting. If that was only ascenders and descenders,
    that'd be easy to fix. Usually there is a bit more to it. And the sidebearings
    might need some work -- again, not too hard."
