  body: "Looks like I just sent e-mail to Steve with the same opinion. I suggested
    looking at the <a href=\"http://letterheadfonts.com/styles/script.shtml\">Letterhead
    Fonts script collection</a> for something that might be similar. 'Ballpark', 'Ephemera'
    and 'Royal Script' are in this stylistic vein, in my opinion, if similar would
    work.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    very surprisewd if it is type. Another current type in that style but with less
