  at the church I work at. I was wondering what sans you would pair with it for headings.
  Obviously other than Fedra Sans which I'm not a fan of. I'm looking for something
  very neutral.\r\n\r\nAlso, a more open question, how do you go about pairing two
  typefaces? What technical things do you look for? And any particularly successful
  examples of this would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\nSamuel"

    60: London and New-york\" from House industry (the \"Paris-60\" cut is too thin):
    www.houseind.com\r\nI think it works well.\r\nBest regards\r\nDamien"

  body: "I quite like chalet but it lacks small caps and text figures which I love
    using.\r\n\r\nJust looked at fago and unit and I noticed they are very similar
    in design to fedra, as in they both look like modern humanist faces. I've always
    been under the impression that you don't pair similar typefaces.\r\n\r\nJust thinking
    now and after reading the link I want quite a bit of contrast in the styles.\r\n\r\nI
    attached some examples below\r\n\r\nAvenir Next SC\r\nFago\r\nFedra Sans (don't
    have alt for now)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Borchure Heading Variations_5980.jpg]"

  body: "As mentioned above, there are different approaches.\r\n\r\nBut looking at
    your example, I see your point.\r\nI think the wider Fago would work better.\r\nAlso,
    de Groot\u2019s Corpid comes to mind, it shares the more fluid feel without beeing
    too playful (as Fedra Sans).\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\nAs you\u2019re looking for more contrast,
    have a look at FF Kievit:\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/kievit/"
