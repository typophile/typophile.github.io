		<div class="commentbody">I was very impressed by his tale (at TypeCon Buffalo?) of how he got into the business, IIRC he rode the rods to the West coast during the depression and ended up at school there learning lettering by making drawings from big specimen letters of Caslon. Some element of chance, walking down the street, figured into it too. Did I get that right, or is it just a romantic memory?</div>

  <div class="comment card m-3">
	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody"><p>I’ve had the great pleasure of meeting Doyald Young on a few occasions: at Hermann Zapf’s 87th birthday in 2005, at the TypeCon conference in Buffalo, NY in 2008, and again at TypeCon in Los Angeles last year. I’ve exchanged some wonderful e-mails with him over the years.</p>
<p>Once, he most kindly drew a custom logo for my then-girlfriend’s jewelry brand — as a gesture of appreciation for my bit of assistance with the production of his fonts. Doyald could draw the sexiest letterforms. To me, they were a perfect embodiment of femininity. This somewhat surprised me when I realized that Doyald preferred Michelangelo’s David over Venus de Milo. But perhaps this should not be surprising. Grace, finesse and beauty are of in any way to be confined to clichés.</p>
<p>Doyald Young has authored several books: “Logotypes &amp; Letterforms” (1993), ,“Fonts &amp; Logos” (1999) and “Dangerous Curves: Mastering Logotype Design” (2008). He was working on his next book about the lettering of the English formal script, although I am not sure whether he managed to finish it.</p>
<p>It was due to his “Dangerous Curves” book that I came up with a stunt at the TypeCon 2010 conference in Los Angeles. At the same hotel venue as the conference, a Playboy charitable event was being held. So after the presentation of the SoTA Award to Doyald, I’ve grabbed him and escorted him to the stand where the Playboy bunnies were accepting donations, and arranged an impromptu photoshoot of Doyald, his “Dangerous Curves” book and, well, some “dangerous curves” of a different kind.</p>
<p>I think Doyald did not quite appreciate the stunt at the beginning. I apologized to him, and he explained to me that it was not him but Stefan Bucher suggested the title of the book — “as in Gina Lollobrigida”, Stefan said. Doyald himself felt that “as for the stunt, I thought that I’d be a sport and do it, though on reflection I see no value in it for me. I’m stuffy and conservative and not much interested in camp, irony, or wit. I hope that my book is now not seen a manual of sex.”</p>
<p>I’m certain that this will never be the case. When I wrote to Doyald that I saw the value of the stunt in contrasting the cheap and superficial Playboy bunny outfits that so unsuccessfully aspired to be “dangerous curves” with the true beauty and mastery delivered by Doyald, he did, after all, agree, and laughed about it.</p>
<p>After meeting Doyald on several occasions, I cannot concur with his own estimation of being “stuffy” and “not much interested in irony or wit”. I think he was just too modest — yet when talking to him, I could see a person who was full of warm-hearted humor, great positive energy, and true talent which was so deservedly and widely appreciated.</p>
<p>As already mentioned in this thread, Lynda.com recently made a 40-minutes documentary about Doyald Young. It’s beautifully shot, and certainly worth watching (non-native English speakers are encouraged to turn on the “CC” subtitles). Here’s the video: 
<a href="http://www.lynda.com/home/Player.aspx?lpk4=75866">http://www.lynda.com/home/Player.aspx?lpk4=75866</a></p>
<p>I also recommend reading the piece that Doyald’s good friend Marian Bantjes wrote about him: 
<a href="http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/medalist-doyaldyoung">http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/medalist-doyaldyoung</a></p>
<p>Thank you, Doyald, for your wit, your wisdom, your attention to detail, and all the dangerous curves you have discovered and presented to all of us.</p>
