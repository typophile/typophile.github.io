  all of the studying it dawned on me, Linotype seems to be so superior to Monotype

  of Linotype 1886 - 1887.\r\n\r\nThe only clue that I have is that Wikipedia says
  that  Linotype was faster because its set a line of type at a time. While Monotype
  was better for \"fine\" printing because it set in singular blocks (one letter per
  block) it allowed for the easier correction for misspellings.\r\n\r\nI don't fully
  trust Wikipedia. So I have to ask is this true? And were there other differences
  that made Monotype worthwhile in the first place?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nTodd\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\r\n\r\n</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>Charles
  Spontelli\r\nAssociate Professor, VCT-Tech Education, Bowling Green State University\r\nhad
  this to say about Linotype vs Monotype\r\n\r\n\"I've worked on a Linotype in my
  career.\r\nI guess that makes me old. I'm pretty sure the machine\r\nstill runs
  at Star Calendar and Printing Co. in Cleveland.\r\nI would agree with Wikipedia
  and add that my understanding\r\nis that the Monotype was used more for financial
  printing\r\n\u2013 financial reports and the like. If there was an error\r\nor if
  the numbers changed after the type was set,\r\ncorrections could be made to individual
  figures\r\nwithout resetting the entire body of work.\r\nI also understood that
  it was easier to do tabular columns\r\n\u2013 (common in financial work) but I really
  don't know exactly why,\r\nso I can't verify that. It's interesting \u2013 so I'll
  pass this on\r\nto some people I know.\"\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n<cite>Patrick
  Schreiber, University of Cincinnati Professor AIGA Cincinnati President\r\nand my
  old room mate in Havana, Cuba last Fall for the AIGA XCD Sharing Dreams\r\nExpedition
  had this to say about Linotype vs Monotype\r\n\r\n\"For anyone who has had the experience
  of composing significant\r\nquantities of 'hand-set' type, the ability to quickly
  make a change\r\nwithout having to completely recompose a galley is significant.
  While\r\nLinotype does indeed set type on a predefined measure would from the\r\noutset
  appears to be a significant time-saver, typesetters were\r\nrestricted to the mechanical
  process; letter spacing (tracking) was\r\npossible, but craft issues such as the
  ability to kern (remember the\r\nkern is actually the sawing away of the cast lead
  that allowed the\r\nthe descender of a 'y' to overlap the previous character and
  slug)\r\nweren't easily accomplished. It is also easier and faster to replace a\r\nsingle
  letter than to compose an entire new line when a keystroke\r\nerror was made.\"\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n<cite>Wikipedia
  had this to say about the Linotype vs. Monotype question\r\nin an article on the
  Lanston Monotype Machine Company\r\n\r\n\"The original Monotype machine used \"hot
  metal\" to form individual letters.\r\nThus spelling mistakes could be corrected
  by adding or removing individual letters.\r\nThis was particularly useful for \"quality\"
  printing - such as books.\r\nIn contrast the Linotype machine formed a complete
  line of type in one bar.\r\nEditing these required replacing an entire line (and
  if the replacement ran on to another line,\r\nthe rest of the paragraph). But Linotype
  slugs were easier to handle if moving\r\na complete section of text around a page.
  This was more useful for \"quick\" printing\r\n- such as newspapers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally
  There several videos on You Tube and other sites that show Linotype and Monotype
  printing processes.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.archive.org/details/Printing1947\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRYxOs1oCRY\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks

  body: "Linotype was excellent for newspapers and simple books. However, for scholarly
    books, where you needed complex math equations and the like, Linotype was less
    than ideal. Monotype could run circles around it in the ability to create multi-level
    math equations (think college Calculus). And it could also do straight text well,
    so for those users who needed even occasional math setting, Monotype was the way
    to go.\r\n\r\nThere is another bit that might interest you. Some years after the
    Linotype was invented, a machine called the Intertype was developed that used
    many of the same features as the Linotype (just different enough to avoid patent
    issues, I guess). You might want to look into it in your research."

  body: "Linotype was faster and cheaper than Monotype, and, in consequence, it was
    much more popular. In fact, as I type these words, \"Monotype\", but not \"Linotype\",
    is underlined in red, indicating that whatever spell checking my browser is using
    did not even recognize the word.\r\n\r\nNewspapers, paperback books, and magazines
    were set almost exclusively on the Linotype, and I believe that a great many hardcover
    books may have been set in that fashion as well.\r\n\r\nWhy, then, did the Monotype
    even exist?\r\n\r\nWell, the main reason is that the Monotype was more flexible
    than the Linotype. Since Linotype produced a line of text as one elongated slug,
    it was absolutely limited to the setting of straight text matter.\r\n\r\nNewspapers,
    of course, have headlines. It isn't impossible to mix foundry type - or Ludlow
    - with Linotype, and indeed that was standard practice. However, there were limits
    to how intimately Linotype could be mixed with other kinds of type. That one solid
    slug was a big part of it.\r\n\r\nAnother was the fact that while the point size
    of foundry type (and Monotype type) is 0.013837\", just under the nominal 1/72\",
    the point size of Linotype is 0.014\".\r\n\r\nSo casting a short line of type
    in Linotype and then putting something in foundry type on the same line would
    be difficult. This wouldn't be needed to insert sorts - Linotype had such matrices
    - but for things like equations it would be painful.\r\n\r\nAlso, with Linotype,
    the regular and italic versions of a typeface had to have the same widths, character
    for character. This was a noticeable aesthetic limitation.\r\n\r\nMonotype, on
    the other hand, fit perfectly with the use of foundry types - and, indeed, because
    it produced individual type slugs, it would normally make it unnecessary to use
    foundry type even for the most demanding typography.\r\n\r\nAlso, Monotype had,
    as has already been noted in this thread, a separate keyboard and caster. This
    meant that multiple keyboarders could prepare paper tapes that could brought to
    a single caster working at full efficiency.\r\n\r\nOriginally for newspapers with
    special fonts, but later for all Linotype users, this particular advantage was
    eventually matched by Linotype thanks to TTS perforators. They created paper tapes
    that controlled a machine that would operate a Linotype machine. The perforators
    calculated where each line would end. At first, this was done by designing newspaper
    fonts to fit the same 18-unit system as a Monotype caster had. Later, the Multifont
    perforator used a 32-unit system internally; this was fine enough that line breaks
    could be calculated properly even though the perforator calculated on the basis
    of character widths that were rounded into those units, not exactly matching the
    actual widths of the Linotype characters.\r\n\r\nHowever, since a TTS perforator
    had a keyboard almost like that of a typewriter - while a Monotype keyboard was
    big and complicated, just as a Linotype keyboard was - it is possible that there
    were union-related issues connected with the use of TTS to eliminate the gap with
    Monotype in this area."
