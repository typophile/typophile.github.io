    a relaxed type of design. Maybe you don''t even need the lowercase of ''for''
    and ''&'', the eyes go very fast to them. What do you think?'

  body: Yeah, you are right, but I am so stuck on them. I love the &. Thank you! Do
    you think that Univers is too overused?

  body: "Well, maybe you can use the '&' but increase a little the height to look
    similar to the rest of the letters. It's only a suggestion, I don't know if it
    will look good. \r\n\r\nUnivers overused? Maybe I'm not the right person to ask,
    because I love Trade Gothic, Helvetica Neue, Officina, Georgia: all overused.
    I've seen many times Univers, but it's a good typography, clean, simple, definitely
    not trendy, but I think suits what you want to express. (sorry if my english is
    poor)"

  body: "It's cmyk, I could see it, so I'll upload an RGB.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/help_4682_RGB_5833.jpg]\r\n\r\nNice
    pallette and elements, however, I think you are going to be limited in the uses
    for this, the proportions need to be more even between cycle and type, they are
    too separate at the moment; which leads onto the illustration I would guess that
    at small sizes you would need to consider either a simplified drawing or a detail
    of the drawing, details around the spokes, skirt guard and pedals are going to
    fill in (btw the cycle doesn't appear to run parallel to the type). I think you
    can also investigate stacking the type element into three lines, you could then
    enlarge them closer to the width of the illustration (this will be tricky because
    you don't want the weight of the type to overwhelm the illustration).\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "Hi merz,\r\n\r\nI agree with timd on the proportions and the idea of stacking
    (also agree with the bike going up, not parallel). I find the \"for\" and \"&\"
    somehow weak, but I do like the italic between the sans.\r\nThe green is pleasant
    and goes really good with the bike and overall feel but still, it somehow lacks
    color, I think.\r\n\r\nI would suggest choosing only one of the two italic expressions;
    or if stacked into three lines, turning the whole \"sentence\" into italics (\"for
    web & print\").\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________\r\nwww.gabssnake.4t.com"
