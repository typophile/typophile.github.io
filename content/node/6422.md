  <BR>Yet another incomplete face from provo, utah. One day I will finish one. <BR>
  <BR>This is an aberration of pill gothic. Worth pursuing? There are some forms that
  I think are just downright stunning, but I think I might have two faces here. &#40;the
  a and the w, for example&#41;.

    and solid, but then it <BR>became calligraphic. It looks great in either <BR>respect,
    but looks incongruous. Also, it&#39;s 4 A.M.  <BR>MST. and I just put my milk
    in the cupbaord and <BR>cereal in the fridge. <BR> <BR>I like the squarish shape
    and the left beaks. <BR>Every glyph that sports a one is stellar &#40;&#34;u&#34;,

    I&#39;m not sure what can be done. Maybe too <BR>heavy &#40;&#34;f&#34;,&#34;r&#34;&#41;?
    <BR> <BR>The &#34;e&#34; looks like it&#39;s in the middle of a yawn. <BR>Is it
    finished? Maybe turn the &#34;a&#34; upside-down? <BR> <BR>The &#34;s&#34; is
    nice, but also looks like it&#39;s from <BR>another font. Serifs too large? <BR>

    See, now you&#39;re making me mention  <BR>Zapf again. Have a look at his Melior
    for more ideas  <BR>here. There are some similar forms and some <BR>opportunities
    for derivation. Take a gander at the  <BR>serif solution for the &#34;s&#34;.

  body: ' It&#39;s the w, v, and y. I need to change them  to fit the face. They are
    too calligraphic. I like them too much though. I might have to do a different
    face to match them. One thing, I found out, though, is that in a body of text,
    the w, v, y don&#39;t stand out so much, as they aren&#39;t usually together like
    that. They kind of add some spice. Maybe I can find a way to keep the spice and
    still match. I definitely agree on the ball serifs. They need some serious work.
    <BR> <BR>And the s! I can never figure out appropriate terminals. I need to do
    some serious s research. I&#39;m getting to where I can control the bez-curves,
    though. &#40;yay, this one didn&#39;t take me half as long as some of the others&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>I have to cite hermann as an influence for this face. He does some funky
    cool stuff with squared serifed faces. Zaph eliptical is one of the coolest things
    I&#39;ve seen, it just lacks some flavor. '

  body: ' Actually, I think the lc &#34;v&#34;, &#34;w&#34; and &#34;y&#34; are some
    of the strongest glyphs of the font. Rather than changing them to fit the face,
    I&#39;d love to see you change more of the glyphs to fit the characteristics of
    these three, without changing the &#34;Pill Gothic&#34; structures upon which
    they were based. <BR> <BR>Also, of the two lc &#34;x&#34;s, I prefer the one with
    half-serifs. Perhaps several of the other glyphs could get by with half-serifs
    worked in instead of completely relying on the more classic full-serifs. <BR>
    <BR>I also think that the &#34;a&#34; and the &#34;w&#34; work well enough together;
    I think it&#39;s the &#34;h&#34;, &#34;m&#34;, &#34;n&#34;, &#34;r&#34;, and &#40;perhaps,
    but definitely to a lesser degree&#41; &#34;u&#34;, &#34;p&#34;, and &#34;q&#34;
    that are throwing off the balance by looking too conservative. &#40;Must be the
    Utah connection, no? ;&#41; &#41; Judicious use of half-serifs in addition to
    your serious &#34;s&#34; research &#40; :D &#41; may help pull the font back into
    cohesiveness. <BR> <BR>As for that &#34;s&#34;, have you tried applying the same
    logic that worked so well with the &#34;a&#34;? That diagonal stroke is really
    a winner. It might even be interesting applied to the &#34;g&#34;. <BR> <BR>As
    for the &#34;f&#34; and &#34;r&#34;, do you need the ball terminals at all? The
    abruptness of the &#34;j&#34; and &#34;t&#34; terminals seems to be working well,
    and may work just as well on the other characters with similar form. <BR> <BR>Finally,
    I don&#39;t at all mind that Pill Gothic is solid and monolinear, while this one
    &#40;Pill Aberration&#41; has stroke modulation. The two structures work harmoniously
    for the FF Scala family, and it looks to me as though they will work equally well
    for this family. <BR> <BR>Keep it up -- I&#39;d love to be able to use these someday!

  body: ' Actually, the c is almost there. It&#39;s square. I think I like it that
    way. It is like the opposite of humanizing a san-serif face. It is a dehumanized
    serif. The c just needs a little thinner thins. the e is still yawning a little,
    but I like it that way. It needs to yawn a little to be properly matched to the
    unnatural squareness of the other letters. Maybe. <BR> <BR>The whole thing is
    unnatural, kind of uncomfortable. It feels like it should be really organic, because
    it&#39;s calligraphic, but it&#39;s so rigid it&#39;s almost mono-spaced. '
