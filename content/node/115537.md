  In here if you scroll to humanistic, the example he shows had no characteristics
  of humanistic such as the diagonal stress, crossbar on the e, serifs are more wedge
  shaped, etc\r\n\r\nIs there something I'm missing here or he's just wrong about
  his exemplar? "

    he mix up old style with humanistic in his exemplar? '
