  body: "<cite>&gt; Note: it also has the error 407 and 907</cite>\r\n\r\nHere is
    a long list of error codes from Sprint users: http://www.sprintusers.com/forum/showthread.php?t=51042\r\n\r\nThey
    write: &nbsp;&nbsp;<cite>407 HTTP error 407: The request from your browser cannot
    be satisfied by the server. HTTP Error 407. Indicates that the client must first
    authenticate itself with the proxy to complete the process. </cite>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    As for 907, it would follow from a bunch of previous errors. "
