  the whole family and delete some of the bitmaps - say the italic 12 and 24 points.\r\nToday
  with OSX, once you double click the suitcase it automatically launches FontBook.\r\n\r\nAnd
  within FontBook - there is nothing I can do if I want to get rid of some bitmap
  files.\r\n\r\nAny idea?"

    think the common practice would be to remove all bitmaps except 12pt. However,
    it only saves a few KB, so I'm not sure why one would bother. "

    font. The suitcase however contains all 4 weights (no single suitcases per weight
    exist). I can send him the bold printer font but have to remove the others from
    the suitcase first.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nDH"

  body: "No, the outline references are a different situation. You asked about bitmaps.
    Bitmaps were the pixel fonts contained within suitcases that were used to render
    text in OS 9 and before. This only came into play if you didn't have ATM-Light
    installed, which under OS 9 would have been very unusual. On the early, pre-ATM
    Macs, if you didn't have lots of bitmap sizes text wouldn't render as nicely.
    \r\n\r\nThe outline references can also be modified by Font Doctor with it's Move
    Fonts feature--basically a clone of an ancient utility called DA Font Mover. I
    would not really recommend this either. In fact, if you collect fonts out of Suitcase
    Fusion, they will always be separated into one face per suitcase. This is partly
    related to Suitcase Fusion's face-level activation. Fonts that are correctly named
    for family style-linking still show up in modern applications as a family. However,
    in an OS X environment, it is no longer necessary to have them occupy the same
    suitcase file. It's better if they're separate, like OTF fonts. Then, as in your
    example, if you want to give someone just the Bold weight it's easy to do so.
