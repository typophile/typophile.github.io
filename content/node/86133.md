  body: "Although it is probably from the era of [[http://www.artisticprintingbook.com/|Fancy
    Type]], this looks hand-drawn. Ignoring the spurs on the top and bottom, which
    you could add yourself quite easily, it is like a [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/latin/|latin
    wide]]. [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/great-western/|Great Western]]
    from FontMesa is the only latin wide with such a high contrast but the A doesn't
    have the top serif. There might be bank note-inspired fonts that are closer.\r\n\r\nIs
    it possible to see the full image?\r\n\r\n"
