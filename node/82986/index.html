  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello,</p>
<p>what would you propose as an alternative to the common Minion/Myriad- and Sabon/Syntax-combos?</p>
<p>The application would be mainly technical project reports, several dozens to sometimes a few hundred pages, typeset with LaTeX on A4 paper, in two columns or with wide margins, 10 to 12 pt, with loads of tables, figures, &ldquo;in-text-markup&rdquo;, etc. Sometimes read as PDF on screen, but mostly printed with &ldquo;office&rdquo; printers (laser). Also, as secondary applications, presentations, letters and similar &ldquo;office&rdquo; documents. European readers, German, English, French language.</p>
<p>The criteria would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Readability. Should be as easy as prose, as far as technically possible under these conditions. Whether these documents get actually read or not makes a <em>significant</em> &ldquo;competitive advantage&rdquo;. In the industry nearly everyone uses a certain &ldquo;text processor&rdquo; for these applications and certain &ldquo;typefaces&rdquo;, together with a certain type of &ldquo;layout&rdquo;, and as a result, the documents are simply <em>never</em> actually read.</li>
<li>Features: Both serif and sans should be available at least as regular, italic, semibold, semibold italic, with oldstyle figures and small caps at least in the regular weight, both upright and italic. A variant appropriately spaced for headlines would be nice to have for the sans.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Garalde&rdquo; look (and &ldquo;feel&rdquo;) for the serif. Preferably as bright as possible without compromising legibility too much.</li>
<li>The sans should also be suitable as main text typeface for certain applications.</li>
<li>Opentype postscript flavor for integration with LaTeX.</li>
<li>The typefaces in question shouldn&rsquo;t be as common as Minion/Myriad or Sabon/Syntax, that&rsquo;s why I am asking here. ;-)</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a look at the &ldquo;similar fonts&rdquo; at myfonts.com and identifont.com already, also at the families of &ldquo;companion&rdquo; sans and serifs at identifont.com. And while I do like quite a few of the sans typefaces listed there (Celeste, Charlotte, Freight&hellip;) I haven&rsquo;t managed to find a matching serif typeface that I really do like. I definitely do not like the serif members of &ldquo;corporate identity&rdquo; families such as Thesis, Corporate ASE, Nexus, Generis, Meta, etc&hellip;</p>
<p>Any proposals?</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Wolfgang</p>
<p>P.S.: I&rsquo;m a typographic layman, and I don&rsquo;t have the possibility to test these fonts, that&rsquo;s why I hope to get competent advice from experienced users of various relevant typefaces here&hellip;</p>

<p>As for the Sans, any humanistic Sans would work. Nick Shinn&rsquo;s Sensibility, Stella, Mundo, PF Centro Sans, Depot New.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for the replies. I hope it was not my question that crashed the Typophile database&hellip; &gt;;-&gt;</p>
<p>I really do like Novel, thanks for the hint. However, I haven&rsquo;t managed to find a PDF specimen to test it in print&hellip; :-(</p>
<p>Lyon and Pona also look nice. Much better to my eyes than the average &ldquo;corporate&rdquo; typefaces that I have found so far.</p>
<p>For the sans, imho the point is to find one that matches color and metrics of the serif as far as possible, and this in both weights (regular, semibold) and shapes (upright, italic). And without the possibility to actually test the combination myself&hellip; :-/</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Apparently, Andron doesn&rsquo;t have italic small caps anyway. Why I need these? For acronyms/abbreviations (I have L-O-A-D-S of these in my documents) in blocks of italics text, such as quoted text, margin notes, etc.</p>
<p>The fact that Andron doesn&rsquo;t have a sans that&rsquo;s made specifically for it wouldn&rsquo;t matter to me, I&rsquo;m not looking exclusively for purpose-made &ldquo;superfamilies&rdquo;. Sabon and Syntax were made by different designers, yet as far as I understand they seem to be generally considered as The Reference for documents like the ones that I mostly write.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t have to be typefaces that were released recently. For example, if you know of a nice matching sans for Albertina&hellip; Would Today work? I picked these two from the &ldquo;Schriftwechsel&rdquo; book, and Albertina also from the &ldquo;Textism&rdquo; web site. I have no clue how they would work for my kind of application, however, especially with office printers.</p>
<p>I have also come across Epic and Organic (from Typetrust) by chance. What do you think about them? Epic looks to me essentially like &ldquo;a better Garamond than Garamond&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Calluna looks a bit too idiosyncratic to me with that asymmetric &ldquo;twist&rdquo; in the connection between the lower serifs and the stems.</p>
<p>And Centro looks a bit too &ldquo;slabby&rdquo; for my taste.</p>
<p>So, if you know of more such &ldquo;hidden gems&rdquo; like</p>
<ul>
<li>Novel,</li>
<li>Lyon (matching sans?),</li>
<li>Pona (Orenga is beautiful - does it pair up with Pona?)
keep them coming! :-)</li>
</ul>
<p>As for the sans; I do like Stella, Mundo, Depot New a lot, thanks for those.</p>
<p>Und Grüße in das Land wo die krossen Chicas auf den Palmen wachsen. ;-)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Epic seems to be more a reinterpretation of Sabon, with new italics, than any other Garamond-type. This is interesting, as somehow Epic seems to be more close to Sabon than the revival of Sabon Next. In any case I am not qualified to assess the quality of how the typeface is crafted (outlines, spacing, kerning, etc&hellip;).</p>
<p>As well it seems to me that Epic is different than other typefaces (and Sabon) in the size and position of the German Umlaut dots in comparison to the i dot. I mention it as it seems like we share the same mother tongue.</p>
<p>All in all it seems to me a useable typeface.</p>
<p>Something else that fits your criteria is FF Celeste, which has a [[https://www.fontfont.com/fonts/celeste|serif]], [[https://www.fontfont.com/fonts/celeste-small-text|small-text (serif)]] and a [[https://www.fontfont.com/fonts/celeste-sans|sans face]]. Celeste takes more inspiration of the modern era. It is a good text face though and very suitable. It does not need to be a Garalde. (EDIT: I just saw you mentioned Celeste in your original post. You said though that you did not find a matching serif you liked. That means you did realize that there are Freight and Celeste serif versions, but you did not like them, right? Just in case you did not notice.)</p>
<p>Did you try to ask the designers of the serif typefaces, which fitting sans they recommend?</p>
<p>As well there is no real agreement on how to pair typefaces. I think it was Hrant here in this forum who said once that one should not aim for all too similar metrics and x-height. You can find more advise on pairing here: [[http://www.google.at/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=typeface+pair+OR+pairing+OR+match+OR+matching+OR+combining+OR+combination+OR+tango+site%3Atypophile.com|Typophile threads on pairing]]</p>

<p>Yes, I know about Celeste (serif), but for my taste it has too much contrast. Too &ldquo;vertical&rdquo;. Freight is even further away (too &ldquo;modern&rdquo;) from what I&rsquo;m looking for.</p>
