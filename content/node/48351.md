  it was too critical and was taking most critiques as insults instead of inspiration.
  I hope to start using it more as a progress in my design.\r\n\r\nI've really been
  thinking hard about a lot of things and I don't truly want to be a designer anymore.
  I would love to market peoples design such as [[http://www.tylorjreimer.com]] who
  is my partner and close friend. I just can't stomach being a designer for the rest
  of my life, I just don't think I have what it takes.\r\n\r\nWhats the next step?\r\n\r\nDo
  you have inspiration for me, should I keep going as a designer? Feel free to talk
  me out of it or fucking rip me apart. All will be taken as it is.\r\n\r\nSincerely\r\nChris"

  body: "Chris,\r\n\r\nWhat kind of design do you do? Web, print, branding? Can you
    list a few things that excite you about design? Is it the problem solving you
    have issues with, or is it the task of pixel pushing? Perhaps you are feeling
    too many limitations with your clients?\r\n\r\nThe only thing I can recommend
    is maybe exploring other design related disciplines. Industrial design, architecture,
    cartography or maybe photography. If you an find the motivation, try out some
    new things in your spare time (something difficult for me to do, I find). Take
    a calligraphy class, or go outside and paint a landscape. It helps also, to attend
    local design gatherings (AIGA, GDC, Pecha Kucha, etc), get in touch with your
    community and see what kinds of amazing things they might be working on, be inspired
    by your peers. You might have to do a bit of self discovery and really try to
    push your own limits. You might find something really magical that can lead you
    to recovering your creativity.\r\n"

  body: "Christopher,\r\n\r\nI hate to hear of someone leaving a creative field. Do
    you think marketing other people's work will be satisfying for you? I scanned
    your other blogs and you seemed very excited about starting a new job. Maybe that
    company just isn't a good fit for you. Critiques can be harsh and tough to bear
    at times, especially since a lot of design does fall under personal preferences.
    If design truly isn't for you, then yes, look elsewhere - find your passion. But
    if you're just feeling kicked around a lot lately - and most of us have gone through
    that - step back, Zara made some great suggestions, get re-inspired. Determine
    is it the work? or the job? Then decide what direction will be best for you. "
