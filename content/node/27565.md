body: "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nI've been working on my first homemade font for the past few
  days, but encountered a bit of a problem.\r\nSince I wanted the font to be as complete
  as can be, I checked around for any kind of character/accent I could find & ended
  up with a little over 300 characters in total. When I export the font from Fontographer
  (version 4.something) in EPS, everything is included, but when I drag the font into
  Font Reserve Browser, the character map only shows 256 characters. In PopChar Pro
  it might even be less.\r\nCan anyone tell me what happened to the rest & how to
  get them to show up in at least Font Reserve Browser?\r\nI could always divide the
  font into 2 typefaces, one with the \"normal\" characters & the second one for all
  the strange accents, but I'd like to keep it in a whole if possible."

    the characters, but just that it unables me to use them (PopChar Pro shows even
    less characters).\r\nI'm already up to about 320 characters, so maybe making a

  body: "Well, Miguel is bound to have a lot more experience than me with Macs and
    Unicode, but I do believe that dividing the character set into two fonts would
    do the trick, albeit it at a considerable loss of convenience (especially if you're
    using InDesign).\r\n\r\nThat's because, in an \"alternate\" font, the characters
    that would have high Unicode numbers can be put in the slots normally reserved
    for common characters. So, for instance, in Scala Sans Regular Expert, the dimension
    sign (\xD7) glyph can be found in the slot normally reserved for the tilde, and
    the fl ligature resides in the slot normally reserved for the question mark. In
    other words, when you switch to Scala Sans Regular Expert and type a tilde, you
    get \xD7, and when you type a question mark, you get an fl ligature.\r\n\r\nAs
    far as the operating system is concerned, there are no characters above ASCII
    255; the OS doesn't need to support Unicode for you to be able to access \"special\"
    glyphs if they're put in the slots for \"normal\" glyphs."

  body: "Thanks for the information!\r\nIt is indeed a lot less practical to divide
    the font into \"regular\" & \"alternate\", but finding the right character won't
    be a problem thanks to PopChar. It'll just be time consuming to switch fonts all
    the time.\r\nStrange though that Fontographer does allow you to add more characters
    than can actually be used. I opened an existing fontfile in it to see what kind
    of characters existed (a whole lot more than I ever imagined!) & that had more
    characters than you can actually use as well. I just thought it would be easier
    to make one huge font instead of selecting characters per language. Heck, I don't
    even know in what languages half of the strange combinations (eg. a \"t\" with
    \"\xB8\") are used ;-)\r\nI also added a few custom characters such as an exponential
    \xA9 & \xAE (next to a normal sized \xA9 & \xAE), an exponential \"st\", \"nd\",
    \"rd\" & \"th\" (for 1st, 2nd,...), some extra fractions & a character for Co.,
    so I've got even more characters than any font I've seen so far.\r\nI'm also working
    on a dingbat font to go with it, so I guess it'll have to be a 3-piece typeface."

    line is that a proper OpenType font with all bits and pieces in the proper places
    is better than the old \"hacks\" -- such as PS1 fonts divided into basic and expert
    etc -- for a number of reasons, especially standards compliance and ease of use
    (with software that can handle automatic glyph substitution etc such as InDesign).
    If you plan to release your font(s), you should upgrade your OS rather than opt
    for what Miguel has rightly called a hack.\r\n\r\nFrom your comments, it seems
    that you need to study Unicode a little more before expending more time and effort
    on your font production. A good place to start is the <a href=\"http://unicode.org/\"
    target=\"_blank\">Unicode web site</a>. A useful tool is their <a href=\"http://www.unicode.org/unibook/index.html\"
    target=\"_blank\">Unibook application</a> (free), which is actually not very easy
    to find on the site."

  body: "Well, seeing as I don't have any typographic background whatsoever (except
    for knowing the diference between Arial & Helvetica ;-) & what I learned along
    the process now) & only made this font as a \"study\" (it started off as 10 custom
    letters for an illustration I was working on), I think the hack would be a well
    enough solution.\r\nI'm not planning on releasing this font, but just wanted to
    have all the characters for myself. Once you start working on a few neccesary
    accents, it's hard to know where to stop. Since I propably won't ever -or very
    rarely- use the expert characters, it'll be OK to stack them together in an expert
    version. I'd have to use PopChar to select the right character anyway since I
    haven't got a clue where they would normally go (I don't even know what some of
    them are supposed to be or when they could be of any use). I'll spend some extra
    time in selecting all the characters I'll probably end up using & put them in
    the regular version.\r\nThanks for all the usefull information though, I learned
    a lot!\r\nIf I ever decide to make a second font including all accents, I'll be
    sure to check out the Unicode website & do a proper study bef\xF3re starting.\r\nOh...
    \xE0nd I'll finally update to OS X first as well ;-)"
