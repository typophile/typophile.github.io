    and part of the bottom of the 't'. This could be custom, based on an existing
    font.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    body: I do wonder, Lex... I've spent hours looking for it. It looks deceptively
      common to me, which is why I thought it would be easy to find... Unfortunately
      I'm obsessive by nature so am going to find out one way or another... I agree
      on your comments though! Thanks for your input.

    it.\r\n\r\nEdit, They broke it because it never needed fixing. :^D"

    body: Many of the proportion are similar I agree... Certainly the x-height is
      right, but there are too many differences. There is a consistency in the design
      of the mystery typefase that makes me think it isn't a hatchet job... I'm just
      amazed that such an inconspicuous looking sample has proved so hard to recognise!

  body: Not to be a negative party pooper, but I think the reason there are so many
    consistencies in the design is because they started with Caledonia and systematically
    tore it apart.

    body: It's not good having an obsessive tendency when you're trying to identify
      a font... I can't give up! If it comes to it I'll contact the owners of the
      sample!!! I will find the truth behind this oddity :) and report back!
