  text, though this could be a complimentary font) for the financial sector, and the
  company name contains an ampersand.\r\n\r\nWondered if anybody had any particular
  favourites up their sleeve with a great ampersand?"

    wrong with taking one from different font, as long as it's not too far off (aesthetically,
    historically, &c).\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontaid/coming-together/coming-together/characters.html\r\n\r\n<img

    to edit all headlines to have ampersands now."
