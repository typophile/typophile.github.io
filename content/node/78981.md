body: "Hello.\r\n\r\nI have a company that builds/manages web software as well as
  providing design services to a small number of clients. For quite a while we've
  looked at changing our logo to a simple wordmark. However; finding a perfect font
  that \"just looks right\" for our company name has proved elusive. We're great at
  designing stuff for other people but our own seems to be an achilies heel. To be
  honest, it's now driving me crazy lol.\r\n\r\nPeople on here are extremely knowledgable
  about fonts (more so than me) so I thought I'd reach out for some help. If you suggest
  a font and we decide to use it, I will send you $200 (or \xA3125 / \u20AC150) via
  PayPal.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrief:\r\n---------------------------\r\ni)   The name of the
  company is Aylis\r\nii)  Letters can be upper/lower (Aylis AYLIS aylis)\r\niii)
  Wordmark only (no icon).\r\niv)  No restrictions on style.\r\n\r\n\r\nRules:\r\n---------------------------\r\ni)
  \  No limit on suggestions but be sensible; don't spam every font you can think
  of.\r\nii)  No 'close date' (if/when a font is chosen, it will be announced on here
  and the winner will get paid).\r\n\r\niii) <strong>ALL suggestions must be a link
  to a page or an embeded image that depicts our name using the font. Posts that say
  things like \"Check out FontX\" will be ignored.</strong>\r\n\r\n\r\nYou might only
  be a suggestion away from a nice bit of spending money (plus I really need some
  help lol). Get suggesting!\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nDave\r\n\r\n"

    range of $75 - $150 an hour, and a complete identity system costs thousands. $200
    wouldn't even cover the time spent making phone calls and emails.\r\n\r\nStart
    with a long meeting with the client to discuss their company and what they're
    trying to communicate. Spend time doing research (for example you need to know
    what their competitors use). Come up with concepts. Have a 2nd meeting with the
    client. Continue this thru several rounds until a final logo is chosen. Make the
    final art. Design the letterhead, envelope and card, and after approval make final
    art. Get estimates from printers. Meet with the printer, then later review the
    printer's proofs, and then maybe do a press check when the stationery is being
    printed. Design the signature line for corporate emails, and maybe design some
    common forms (fax, etc). Design and prepare a corporate identity manual (a big
    job in itself). And so forth. It's a LOT of work.\r\n\r\n"

    Gerhard suggested, that many designers are doing whole identities for less. In
    fact, by saying what he said, I think he kind of undercut the whole argument\u2026\r\nAlso,
    many young designers will often do stuff for free just to get some work under
    the belt, so getting paid for suggesting a typeface? Not too bad. Some of us feel
    like, at this point, we have to take whatever we can get.\r\nYes, ethics. But
    let us not forget what we're working for, in the end: not ethics; money. Doctors
    and lawyers and accountants too. And while <cite>I</cite> don't really much care
    for money and don't want it, <cite>most people</cite> (he said, unnecessarily
    ironically) who can get me the stuff I really want and need <cite>do</cite>. So

    agree with it; but this is also a kind of bullying, because this argument makes
    people who would otherwise do this feel guilty for doing stuff for money. And
    you all do it. It doesn't matter how involved you are or how creative or how ethical
    or how serious; doing stuff for money is doing stuff for money. It's all bad.
    It's all selling out. We're not talking about killing someone, we're talking about
