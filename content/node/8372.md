body: I regret the lateness of this announcement, but it must be declared no matter
  the date... <BR> <BR>December 26 marked not only Boxing Day and the beginning of  <BR>Kwanzaa,
  but also the day on which was born one <a href="http://ms-studio.com/bioresume.html"
  target="_blank">Mark Simonson</a>  <BR>of St. Paul - a man of great talent in <a
  href="http://ms-studio.com/letteringdesign.html" target="_blank">lettering</a>,
  <a href="http://ms-studio.com/fontsales.html" target="_blank">type design</a>, <a
  href="http://ms-studio.com/articles.html" target="_blank">writing</a>  <BR>and many
  other things, I&#39;m sure, which we have yet to uncover.  <BR>From personal experience,
  I can also say he is an amiable and  <BR>very gracious fellow to boot. While he
  never hides his abilities,  <BR>Mark radiates that fine Midwestern quality of humble
  helpfulness  <BR>in all that he does. Oh, and he&#39;s dryly hilarious too. <BR>
  <BR>Best wishes, my friend!

    and joy, and that you didn&#39;t get any of those evil &#34;combo&#34; Christmas/Birthday
    gifts that so often plague end-of-December babies. ;&#41;

  body: Thanks, everyone. I&#39;m away from my desk this week and only just caught
    this thread from a hotel in upstate New York. <BR> <BR>Having a birthday the day
    after Christmas, I often get concerned questions and comments from people who
    have birthdays on &#34;normal&#34; days. But, really, I don&#39;t know any better,
    plus I like the fact that I almost always get my birthday off. <BR> <BR>Anyway,
    thanks again and I hope we all have a good new year.
