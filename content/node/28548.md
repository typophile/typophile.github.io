    of ambiguity for all.</strong>  (It's in the Bill of Rights, isn't it?) \r\n\r\nI
    am working on a bilingual signage system right now and I get so much pressure
    from people who either believe it is easier to say practically everything with
    pictograms than to translate words into another language, or else so resent having
    to use the second language that they are willing to sacrifice the very concept
    of communication to avoid doing it in the second language.\r\n\r\n"
