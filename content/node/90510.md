    Slab]].\r\n\r\nThe \"St. Jack\" title is a hand-tracing of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/engravers/alternate_cuts.html|Engravers]].\r\n\r\nEverything
    else is just handwriting, no fonts."

  body: Again, that's just hand-lettering, not a font. Look at how all the different
    letters that occur more than once (/U/ and /L/ most visibly, but the others too)
    are different in each instance. Someone has written out these words, scanned them
    in and used them as (bitmap) menu graphics.
