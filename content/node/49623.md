body: "I need help for choosing font so I can design passive house logo. \r\n\r\n\"Passive
  house\" is not a building but standard in architecture that requires that building
  uses 15 kWh of energy for heating and cooling per square meter over period of one
  year, and that is very little.\r\n\r\nSo passive house is green standard, it is
  connected with architecture, ecology, and technology (to achieve PH standard in
  some part technology is used - eg. heat pumps).\r\n\r\nI was considering to use
  DIN, and that font is still my first choice, but I would love to hear more suggestions
  because my knowledge about type and it usage is very limited.\r\n\r\nAlso primary
  usage of logo would be on web page.\r\n\r\nHope to get some great suggestions."

    here. Also if there's going to be a mark or if it's simply going to be a logotype
    would be helpful info. And if there's going to be a mark, post that or initial
    sketches of it too.\r\n\r\npenn"
