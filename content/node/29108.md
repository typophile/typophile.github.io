body: "I've been wondering for some time about this. I'm in high school right now
  and lately I've realy wanted to explore a carrer in typography, possiblely as a
  type designer, graphic design with a typography specialization, ect. I've been looking
  at universities, and I wanted to know 1. what degree would I pursue for a career
  like that and 2. what schools specialize in this field.\r\n\r\nI live in Los Angeles,
  California, so I've been looking at the Art Center College of Design and Laguna
  College of Design. I would rather go to school on the west coast, but I'm interested
  on what you all (as experts in the field) know."

  body: "There are two full-time typeface design degree programs in the world: one
    at Reading University in the UK, the other at the KABK in the Netherlands. But
    I know the former is Masters level, and I suspect the latter has steep entry requirements
    as well.\r\n\r\nI myself teach a typeface design course at ArtCenter, Thursday
    nights.* One reason I would recommend trying that first is you need to make sure
    you really like the idea of designing type before committing to it, since it's
    really a strange, strange field... :-)  BTW, you mention that you're in high school
    - I think ArtCenter has special deals for high schoolers.\r\n\r\n* http://typophile.com/node/27672\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "It's not a strange field, it is different from most of the design jobs considered
    under a survey, route and gaze perspective : mental representations of environmental
    spaces can be viewed in any three different ways (Tversky, 2004), most probably
    the same is true for the cognitive collage of the space of design research in
    typographic art and fontography.\r\nNo other design discipline requires so much
    learning and training as fontography, and by no other aspect can amateurs be so
    easily distinguished from professionals.\r\nYou might find useful what Sebastien
    Sanfilippo shared :\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/17612"

    course as well. \r\n\r\nedit: It's listed under the masters programs but is called
    a post-graduate program in the specific course description. "
