body: 'I''m trying to figure out whether Frutiger is in use as a road-sign font anywhere
  in the world. I''m under the impression that it''s used in Switzterland, but that
  the version there (ASTRA-Frutiger?) may have been reworked by the Swiss government.
  Does anyone know anything about Frutiger being used on Swiss roads, or whether any
  version of it appears on highway signs anywhere else? If so, what version is currently
  on those signs? '

    old road signs using another font are being replaced slowly with Frutiger (ASTRA?).
    I have also spotted Frutiger Condensed on road signs with long town names.\r\n\r\nBut
    mostly it's still the old signs with that no-name font. \"VSS\" is the name, as
    I recall from another recent thread (Belgium has the same old road sign font):\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/12978"

    I don't know who designed it. Frutiger gave his blessings, though. The vertical
    strokes in ASTRA are heavier than in the standard Frutiger, and the letters have
    been a bit condensed as well.\r\n\r\nASTRA Frutiger's development was documented
    in the Fresh Fonts exhibition at the Museum f\xFCr Gestaltung Z\xFCrich in 2004.\r\n\r\nIf

  body: "as im from switzerland (coming from the city of zurich where this exhibition
    named \"fresh type\" was), i have also bought the book about it. i'll just type
    directly off it:\r\n\r\n(begin quote)\r\nShifting road-sign production to a different
    process prompted the federal roads department (Astra) to replace their existing
    standard typeface, dating from the sixties, with a more up-to-date version. But
    the body responsible within the Swiss Road Expert Association (VSS) decided not
    to go for a new development, but went back to Frutiger 57. Adrian Frutiger approved
    the modifications to his typeface, which allow for current insights into legibility
    at a distance and when on the move. the most striking feature are the widening
    up- and down-strokes, which are intended to give the eye a better hold than was
    the case with the earlier version. but for a pragmatic reasons, it was again decided
    not to take account of the different legibility of sheet-metal and back-lit signs.
    so astra frutiger now has two styles, for motorways and for streets.\r\n(end quote)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nit
    seems like you are actually able to buy the font, but maybe its also just the
    text to tell you how to use it...\r\n\r\n<cite>Anordnung und Darstellung der ASTRA-Frutiger-Schrift
