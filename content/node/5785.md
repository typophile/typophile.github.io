  their answers here. The answers are &#40;and remain&#41; anonymous and mixed but

  body: Nigel, Avenir is not a rip-off of Futura. It is an entirely different design
    which any competent typographer can distinguish at a glance without any careful
    inspection. Sure, it&#39;s a design in the same genre, and one which some folks
    think is better. It&#39;s not as &#34;in your face&#34; with its geometric underpinnings,
    which is either a good or bad thing, depending on one&#39;s point of view. <BR>

    <BR>In any case Frutigers own words say that it is the &#34;better Futura&#34;
    so while the design is obviously not identical Linotype is certainly trading off
    the goodwill in the Futura name by using the quote. <BR> <BR>Nigel <BR>

    what it is - a cross-section of anonymous opinion - which the ATypI board should
    probably take time to review and address. However, as someone at TypeCon suggested
    there&#39;s little in the survey that should come as a surprise to the ATypI board.  <BR>

  body: Avenir as Futura have similar maining, ist all about &#39;future.&#39; <BR>When
    you design a new typeface, as a new music or book, there is natural references
    to predecessors. So, when Avenir Next booklet refer to Futura is pretty useful
    to explain from which ground came from Avenir. No typeface came from nothing.
    <BR> <BR>About the ATypI survey, yes, I tried first to post that on the news,
    last week, but nothing happened and the news wasn&#39;t posted &#40;perhaps due

    there is already 3 places where that survey is discussed, well why not? The problem
    is more wider than ATypI itself I think and all organisations should think a bit

    is a deliberate and acknowledged clone of Palatino. One Monotype manager described

    <BR>Avenir is a new typeface in the same genre as Futura, with totally different
    proportions and &#39;colour&#39;. Yes, Linotype are marketing it, in some respects,
    at the expense of Futura by making comparative statements. This wouldn&#39;t be

    and cloning a typeface.

    It is not the &#34;tagline&#34; of the font family, just a quote from the designer
    himslef that is quite liked. Put this into perspective: Adrian Frutiger is one
    of the world&#39;s most respected type designers, living or dead. To insinuate
    that he is a font pirate is unfair. <BR> <BR>Linotype does sell basic commercial
    in its webs shop. The font description clearly states that it is based on the

  body: Nigel, I&#39;ve spent all night researching German Trademarks. From my preliminary
    research, &#34;Akzidenz Grotesk&#34; is NOT a registered trademark in Germany,
    as far as I am aware. Perhaps you can show me otherwise. To provide me with the
    exact details of Akzidenz&#39;s registration in Germany, you may contact me either
    on or off this board. <BR> <BR>As Richard Hamilton stated above, Akzidenz Grotesk
    was registered by <i>he who must not be named&#39;s </i> Berthold in Feb. 2000
    as a trademark in the <i>United States.</i> <BR> <BR><i>Linotype</i> has been
    selling Akzidenz Grotesk legally since the 1950s. This is impossible to dispute.
    All of the records are in its Bad Homburg office. A few years ago, the company
    changed the name of AG to Basic Commercial in its webshop soley to avoid a potential
    lawsuit from <i>he who must not be named</i>. BC is the same electronic font data
    that LL had previously been selling

  body: First you should get some sleep. <BR> <BR>It is quite easy for anyone to lookup
    online in the German trademark database that all of H. Berthold AG&#39;s trademarks
    were assigned to Berthold Types Limited early in 1998. I am sure Linotype can
    help you with this. <BR> <BR>In the ATypI survey people were harsh about Monotype
    and Book Antiqua. Linotype is no better, that&#39;s all. It is the nature of the
    type industry. <BR> <BR>If Linotype &#34;officially&#34; is interested in this
    post then they should join in rather than have you be their voice. <BR> <BR>I
    also noticed the other day that Linotype has applied for the &#34;Eurostile&#34;
    trademark in the U.S. When did they acquire those rights exclusively?

  body: 'First of all, Linotype is well aware of its own rights and legal satanding,
    and does not need to officially respond to your statements on this forum, which
    as Yves pointed out, are deliberately troll-like. While they do not need to officially
    respond. I personally  feel differently. I cannot understand how you can possibly
    agree with the statements you have entered here. Linotype, as a company, is not
    the one posting derogatory comments on several different web sites. It was you
    who started this discussion by trying to paint Linotype&#39;s Avenir Next in a
    false light. As I have recently designed a few promotional pieces for Avenir Next,
    I feel that your comments are a deliberate questioning of my ethical allegiances.
    I responding out of my own accord. I would not design type samples for stolen
    designs. <BR> <BR>However, the post that I made earlier this morning WAS slightly
    influenced by Linotype. Your defending of Berthold is a reiteration of a tired
    argument over the nature of that company. Linotype did assist me in a preliminary
    search of German trademark records. This preliminary search proved no apparent
    results for a Trademark on Akzidenz. The new Berthold DOES have many trademarks
    registered in Germany, however, I could not see AG on the list. Therefore, I am
    asking you directly to back up your statement, which I think is perfectly logical.
    I would do the same. If AG is registered here, Linotype would like to know that.
    As far as it is concerned, AG is not registered here at all. I am not denying
    Berthold&#39;s right to sell Akzidenz Grotesk. I also did a bit of asking around
    about Basic Commercial, since its provenance was specifically asked about. Again,
    for the last time, I am not a lawyer or spokesperson for the Linotype Library.
    I was, however, hired because in part because I am a native speaker &#40;of English&#41;.
    I wrote the last post beacause I can write better English than most of the employees
    in the company &#40;although I personally think that my writing is terribly awful!
    If I could be more concise, this argument would be over&#41;. If you would like
    to continue this discussion in German, I&#39;m sure that you would get some interesting
    responses. <BR> <BR>As far as I am aware, there will be no &#34;official statement&#34;
    from Linotype, because my above points are correct, and Linotype has nothing to
    hide. <BR> <BR>Besides, as far as I know, &#34;official statements&#34; are really
    something for the lawyers. None of us here are lawyers. Ideally, we would all
    friends talking about the things we love most. <BR> <BR>Eurostil: On our website,
    it states that Eurostile is a registered trademark of Nebiolo. I do not know anything
    further about its case, however, Linotype would not register anything with anyone
    if it were a violation of any of its standing contracts. <BR> <BR>First you brought
    up Avenir Next in an attempt to paint Linotype in a bad light. No one held your
    argument for valid that Avenir is a Futura rip-off. Then you brought up Basic
    Commercial, which is not illegally sold &#40;or named&#41; either. Now, you are
    offended by some sort of purported moral violation on behalf of Eurostil. You
    seem to be grasping for straws.I am finding it difficult to maintain an appropriate
    level of coordial dialogue under these circumstances.'

    of the typeface. However, note that there is currently no copyright owner on the
    design of Akzidenz-Grotesk even in Germany. The design was created more than 100
    years ago for a now defunct company. The copyright has expired and there is no
    current owner. Berthold Types Limited did not &#34;inherit&#34; the copyright

    does not generally apply to typeface designs, in the E.U. it does, or at least
    may. Speaking in European standards, and according to the Berne convention, the
    design of &#40;the basic cuts of&#41; Akzidenz Grotesk is public domain, the authors
    have been dead for a very long time and the company which marketed the designs
    is no more. The additional weights that have been created later by G.G. Lange
    may still be subject to copyright and they are not marketed by Linotype as &#34;Basic
    Commercial&#34;.  <BR> <BR>Adam'
