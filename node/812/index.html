<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi everyone. <br> <br>This is an idea i've been kicking around this summer and <br>wanted to get your reaction. It started as sketches that had <br>the diagonal break in the bowls, over time it became more <br>economical in width. I will certainly need loads of help with <br>the forthcoming italics.

<div class=commentbody>I like it. One thing I noticed right off was that the bottom serifs on both the a and b look almost like mistakes(bumps)when I'm not focused directly on them. IMHO the serifs might need to be a little more pronounced. I usually don't post since I'm just starting out learning about typography, but this struck me purely on an asthetic level.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hey Randy, <br> <br>Very impressive! My eye went immediatly to the lc a. It made me wish the "e" had the same flair. It would be interesting to see a closeup of the b, h, p etc. Does the diagonal stroke meet the curve at a point? If so, what would it look like if this was more exagerated or obviously angled?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Tom, LC a was the first glyph. Tried the e with the same angle as the break in the bowls but it looked too odd. Here is a pdf for close viewing. The answer is that they are curved slightly. I felt they gave a bit of sparkle without hurting legibility. <br> <br>Hrant, linguistics?

<div class=commentbody>Looking at the PDF, my only problem is that you're using both <br>totally sharp corners and slightly rounded corners: discord. <br> <br>Linguistics: The Latin alphabet (when used for most languages, and particularly English) uses the vertical Cartesian space in different proportions in terms of ascender, x-height and descenders. The x-height conveys the greatest chunk of information to the reader, and the descenders almost nothing. You still have to balance that against the importance of diverging boumas, but irrespective of the proportion you give to the x-height/ascender ratio, the descenders have to be notably shorter than the ascenders. In a real text face. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Randy: Yes, I see what you mean. I guess what I am missing is possibly what Hrant is alluding to: the terminal of the "a" is not reflected in the other characters. I almost want to see the s and f end in the same manner. I also agree that the descenders could be slightly shorter. I do like the angled strokes. <br> <br>The letter "e" is jealous of the "a" though. I can sense it. ;-)</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hrant, thanks for the explanation, makes sense. <br> <br>Tom & Hrant. sharp + round = discord. <br>Yep I detected that but was hoping it might be ok. The <br>slight roundings are mostly noticed at the break in the <br>bowls which Tom saw, but also in the f, t, c and r. The <br>sharp corners are most pervasive in the serifs (which I'm <br>not totally thrilled about). <br> <br>a) round the serifs? <br>b) sharpen the joins? <br> <br>This has some garamondation to it which makes me lean <br>toward rounding the serifs. Not sure though. Shorter <br>decenders it is. <br> <br>Tom, tried the a-style beak terminal on the s, c , f and r. It <br>hurt legibility bigtime. But I don't want to lose it in the "a" <br>as it's one of my favorite parts. <br> <br>Thoughts on the g? I like how it keeps that nice angular <br>rythm, but not sure about how it looks up next ot a foot <br>serif as in "-ing." <br> <br>Randy</div>

<div class=commentbody>Randy: I don't mind discord in a font as long as it is done purposefully and consistently. I agree with Hrant, between those two options, I would sharpen the joins. This, to me, is what makes the font interesting. But how far do you go with it? If the beak terminal does not work on the other letters, perhaps you should modify the "a" so they are consistent? Another thought: perhaps the angles could be slightly more obvious? (see below...it was easier to show than describe) <br> <br>Angled on the top stroke, slightly rounded on the bottom.

<div class=commentbody>I really like this too. <br> <br>For some reason, it makes me think of an angular version of Poppl Pontifex (<a href=http://www.identifont.com/show?U6 target=_blank>http://www.identifont.com/show?U6</a>), although it really is quite different in many respects. <br> <br>The only thing I might suggest so far is to try thinning the join of the lower-case "a" where the bottom of the bowl meets the main stem above the tail. It looks a bit dark there, and might clog up a bit at smaller sizes, or at least muddy up a bit. That might help alleviate the "flat tire" look that Kris mentioned. <br> <br>I'd also apply the same aesthetic that you applied to "hamb" above to all of the curves. The lower-case "f", "t" and "s" seem to want similar treatment. <br> <br>Nicely done. This will be a font to watch. <br> <br>David</div>

<div class=commentbody>The main problem in this nice font, is that the counters follow too much forms. The horizontals of the n, m, h and b, d, p etc. are really toooo light. The lower part of the a don't follow enough the usual way to connect u for example. You've designed mainly a vertical typeface and miss that horizontals exist too., connections between horizontals and stems are a key part in typeface design. really. <br> <br>To see more what I wrote, check the usual suspects: Galliard, Adobe Garamond, Sabon Next, Palatino, Apolline, etc.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I'm not sure how you started, but what do you think of printing a sample big enough to redraw some letters in pencil, trying to find common traits among related letters as well? Usually I'm not worried about having very different forms within an alphabet, but yours seems pretty ordered and it would benefit from a bit of homogeneization.

<div class=commentbody>I've taken your advice claudio and printed, going back to <br>the pencil (started there too!) With certainty, the next <br>incarnation will not be quite as condensed (this is definitely <br>helping the horizontal flow). Plus I am reworking the serifs. <br> <br>I've been fooling around with an assymetrical serif-- <br>bracketed on the left, not on the right. The reasons I like it <br>are: <br> <br>1) It seems to drive the type forwards <br>2) It has some of the sharp round discord found elsewhere. <br> <br>However, I see those same serifs (ok, not exactly exact!) on <br>two recent postings in the serif forum, Quetzal and <br>Bertrand (both super by the way). I don't know the history <br>of this form, or how unusual this treatment is, I hadn't seen <br>much of it in mainstream fontland. If there's a history <br>lesson coming, I'd love to hear it... <br> <br>Please tell me: "One of the old/dead guys thought this up <br>long ago and it pops up from time to time, so don't get <br>worked up about going there." <br> <br>- Is this treatment left over from a serif drawn in one <br>motion with a flat tipped pen? <br> <br>- What are some other fonts that have this kind of serif? <br> <br>Thanks, <br>Randy</div>

<div class=commentbody>Apolline, Berkeley too. <br> <br>Anyway to answer to the question about asymetric in serifs: <br>"Is this treatment left over from a serif drawn in one <br>motion with a flat tipped pen?" <br> <br>Yes, the form came from a study of the ductus produced by the broad edge pen when doing the terminals. But, as there is various interpretation how humanistic letters has been done at serif level, their his place for infinite variations. <br> <br>I like particular the "ecce hereditas Domini" typeface done by Noordzij as illustration of his essay called 'The truth about the serif" published in letterletter dating back the end of the eighties for ATypI. <br> <br>You can access again to the reprint of his texts published in lettereletter in a book of the same title published by Hartley and Marks in 2000.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi All. <br> <br>Here's a third version. I've done the spacing and some kerning. Also, I revisited the shapes. Previous versions still showed too much up and down movement -- not enough horizonal. I've reworked the branches and bowls to give more emphasis to the horiz/vert. transition of the curve (see the diagram in the pdf -- blue is old, black is new). In addition, I exaggerated the angle of the break to keep the character of the old sets despite the thicker horizontals. <br> <br>I'd love some of the experienced text folk to give me some feedback at this point. It seems much improved to me, but i value your opinions. <br> <br>Would you set long text in it? If not, why not. <br> <br>Thanks, <br>Randy <br> <br><center><table border=1><tr><td><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_pdf.gif align=left alt=application/pdf>prodigal 3.0<br><a href=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/prodigal_3_0-16803.pdf target=_blank><b>prodigal.3.0.pdf</b></a> (205.4 k)</td></tr></table></center></div>

<div class=commentbody>g: up, as in up like goudy? (away from the x-height) <br>j: more convincing if it shows more pen/angle? <br> <br>BTW, the new printer is fantastic. Going to have to reinforce the floors! 6-9 pt text looks great. One quick test i've used is to take a well hinted font, and compare a paragraph with and without type converted to outlines. All at various point sizes. Haven't compared output vs. offset vs. film yet. <br> <br>Thanks, <br>Randy</div>

<div class=commentbody>g: doesn't have to be vertical (and certainly not a Goudy horn), but I think making it more of a "clockwise" curl going above the x-height would be better. <br> <br>j: I don't do pens. :-) Aesthetically it just seems to need something at the end of the terminal, instead of the wimpy tapering. Strong terminals on extenders help readability too. <br> <br>-- <br> <br>> compare a paragraph with and without type converted to outlines. <br> <br>So what was the result? <br>And I <i>will</i> be waiting for the lino comparison! :-) <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>At 1200x1200 dpi <br> <br>Sabon at 6pt <br>Outlines version looks like a semibold version of the hinted text. Outlines are still crisp and well defined (you could id it as sabon), tight counters (lc e) still well open. <br> <br>Sabon at 9pt <br>Outlines version looks marginally darker than the hinted text. <br> <br>Sabon at 12 pt <br>Very very slight difference. <br> <br>Don't know if this is a good test or not? <br> <br>Cheers, <br>Randy</div>

<div class=commentbody>It's a good test, although somewhat predictable: assuming your printer isn't out of whack, outlines will gain half a pixel (on average, of course - since it's binary) in size when converted to outline. This is because of different rendering algorithms within Postscript - not smart, Adobe - unavoidable? <br> <br>On a 600 dpi laser outlines will gain twice as much as on a 1200, so the 12 comparison would be like your 6, and you'd have to go to 24 to get "Very very slight". <br> <br>The best test would be somewhat subjective: figure out at what PPEM most people can't tell the difference between a real font and outlined text. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I've been agonizing over the <b>a</b> for some time now. It was the original sketch that triggered this whole project, squarish-ness and all. I've rounded the bowl and you're right. It's better :-) <br> <br>I've also been working over the e and the c. They both feel awkward -- like they're not sure if they're oldstyle or modern. Also on the e, i've been toying with a diagonal bar ala Berkeley. The nice part about this is that it keeps the hard diagonal theme i have working in the a, b, d, g,h, m, n, p, q, r, s ... we'll see. <br> <br>I'll post up a new pdf tomorrow -- Randy</div>
