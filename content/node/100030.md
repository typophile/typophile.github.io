  not stuffy or too historical? Something a little quirky, but good for body copy?

    think starting with Bodoni is fine. I would not finish with Bodoni, though. Using
    a didone face in order to achieve that <em>air de Paris</em> ambiance feels a
    bit too obvious. What about trying one of those rarely-used Frutiger serif designs?\r\n\r\n<img

    Bodoni and Didot are neolassical fonts used all over Europe starting from the
    end of 17th Century.\r\n\r\nYou'll maybe find some nice inspirations in this video\r\nhttp://vimeo.com/channels/nicetype/18886355"
