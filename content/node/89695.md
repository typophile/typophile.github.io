  body: Damn impressive indeed! I really wish I was well versed in other scripts so
    I could explore ideas like an arabic blackletter. Not that I have enough time
    in my life to explore all ideas in Roman type...

  body: Looks very nice! How do you make sure you get everything right and anticipate
    how ligatures might look like and other similar problems though? I want to design
    a cyrillic typeface one day but it's quite similar to the Roman script so I don't
    anticipate many problems. I find more exotic scripts to be quite risky to design
    if I have no insight in the language.

  body: "More than language, to me it's a matter of visual \"nativity\".\r\nSome designers
    don't agree, but I believe that although without\r\nnativity you can produce acceptable
    imitative typefaces, you\r\ncannot really innovate. Which is not to say that nativity
    cannot\r\nbe acquired later in life; few however can manage that luxury.\r\n\r\nBTW
    when I made Akhalkalak I consulted with an expert native in\r\nGeorgian at UCLA
    (where I used work) to make sure none of the\r\nletters were too far out. And
    the expert did actually find fault with\r\none letter, which I duly tamed (but
    I could not innovate).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: I must say it sounds both risky and exciting. I can imagine if you don't know
    the language you indeed have chance to break new ground.

  body: "But only by dumb luck, at least in text fonts.\r\nDisplay fonts probably
    do benefit from a lack\r\nof imposed precedent though. In fact as I state\r\nnow
    and again, formal education is a two-edged\r\nsword. And I like to say that in
    type design I'm\r\n\"classically trained\": I'm self-taught.  :->\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I'm also self-taught. I studied graphic design at the art academy for one
    year and my basic typographic knowledge was acquired there. I then went on to
    study multi media design. I started being active in type design during my first
    internship in 2009. I have my diploma now and I plan to go back to school upcoming
    year to get a bachelor in graphic design and then a master in typography & communication.
    I have been pondering though whether I'm really doing this for the experience
    or that I will genuinely learn more than I would on my own. I'm sure I will be
    learning through the experience though. I've never really had the pleasure to
    surround myself with type geeks but I really want to enter that environment.\r\n\r\nIn
    any case, when it comes to type design I'm self-taught. I very much romanticize
    the idea of being mentored by a type designer and I find the idea of techniques,
    styles and concepts being passed on from the master to the pupil very charming.
    I guess it's also about the pleasure of working on a single design together as
    opposed to having to find out a solution for every problem yourself. I mean, as
    a solo designer it can be both exhilarating and frustrating/tiring."

  body: Hi hrant that was damn impressive indeed. I am not so well versed in Arabic
    or other scripts, but I would really like to know more about learning the Arabic
    script. I am doing a research in language scripts and I would like to know where
    I could find scripts. <a href="http://www.ordergripgo.com" rel="follow">www.ordergripgo.com</a>
