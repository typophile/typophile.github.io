  appears to be quite a wealth of information & interesting design concepts wandering
  around, so here goes......\r\n\r\nI'm an architect.  looking for a very tall very
  slender font for a new logo.\r\nSimilar to Blakely light, Newport classic, Bougainville
  Light, Ingram BT.\r\nthin, wispy,\r\nneeds to have a cool S.\r\nThe S's the above
  fonts all are more like letters - i'm thinking like a soft S turn in the road.....doesn't
  round over at the top or bottom.  kind of like the S in city blueprint, but more
  compressed, taller.\r\n\r\nIt SEEMS like I have seen this font .....somewhere.\r\n\r\nI
  will understand if the general response is pfffffffft.......\r\n\r\nbut any help
  appreciated.\r\n\r\nbob\r\n\r\n"
