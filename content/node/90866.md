body: "Hi, the logo I'm working on is for an Irish development in Haiti. It's essentially
  a mall (or will be), with shops, cafes, and naturally - a pub.\r\n\r\nAnyway the
  brief is fairly sparse, but they want celtic imagery/symbols used along with something
  to suggest the rebuilding project, and an Irish feel.\r\n\r\nThis is the first concept.
  I appreciate any feedback\r\n\r\n"

    with a less bland typeface. For suggestions about modern typefaces with an irish
    feel, you can look here:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/71989\r\nAlso, you could
    look at Font Aid IV for some inspiration: \r\nhttp://www.typesociety.org/fontaid/iv/

  body: On a technical note, everything looks very very tightly spaced. This is suitable
    only for large display, not so much for logos that are most at home as very small
    icons or distant signage, where generous breathing room is ideal.

  body: "riccardO: You're probably right, and the logo is probably a bit on-the-nose.
    I've worked with this client a few times before, and let's just say they're not
    big on a subtle approach. That doesn't mean I won't try and sell them a more subdued
    concept. They definitely want some celtic imagery/symbols in there, but perhaps
    the regeneration/rebuilding side could be understated a bit more.  \r\n\r\nWith
    regards to the typeface. I'm looking at a few alternatives, but I am trying to
    avoid the Uncial or overtly-Gaelic-typeface approach. I'm Irish myself (and so
    are the clients) and we see these typefaces everywhere, on practically every Oirish
    pub in every city in the world (along with street signs and a lot more in Ireland
    itself). I've come to dislike them, not just aesthetically but as a lazy way to
    scream 'THIS IS IRISH'. I'll take a look for something suitable though, less what
    I'm referring to.\r\n\r\nLuma Vine: Thanks for the tip. I'm probably going to
    end up using a different typeface. This one is condensed and I might have gone
    overboard on tightening the kerning.\r\n\r\nThanks both for the advice. "

  body: "I agree with you about the pitfalls of overtly uncial fonts. \r\nAs for reconstruction,
    I think the right treatment of a celtic knot motive could be enough by itself."
