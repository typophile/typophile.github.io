  body: Fivos, I think your software is the only one available that can match such
    a distorted sample--or did you recognize it on sight?

  body: "Kevin I have learned a lot in Typophile in the last years about both typography
    and font-ids but No I don't think I will ever be able to recognize such a distorted
    sample by sight :)\r\n\r\nIt's the software yes ([[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/find-my-font/features|Find
    my Font]]).\r\nAs I'm the designer of the matching engine, I can assure you it
    has some unique features that other font matching service (like WhatTheFont or
    WhatFontIs) are missing:\r\n=> It can identify extremely expanded or compressed
    samples (like the above)\r\n=> It identifies artificially italicized or emboldened
    samples\r\n=> It's more accurate on low res as it can identify samples with letters
    of e.g. only 15 or 20 pixels height\r\n\r\nPS: We are also in the middle of a
    major update of our online database. After 3 months of hard work (contacting small
    foundries, removing duplicates, upgrading our servers) we are ready to deploy
    in a few days, a faster online service which will recognize about 125.000 free
    and commercial fonts (we actually doubled the number of fonts it can identify).
    I will keep you updated about when the update 'll go live :)"

  body: "Knowing that Find My Font is your baby, I've avoided using it for solving
    requests on this board, mostly because I've been trying to broaden my general
    knowledge of type and because I wanted to learn more about smaller foundries and
    their offerings.\r\n\r\nBut I'm going to definitely have to use it for my personal
    searches...."

  body: "Reading the great responses of many people on the id-board all these years,
    there is one thing that I'm now sure about: A software tool can never replace
    the deep knowledge of people about typography, type styles, type design or the
    history of type foundries and font families :)\r\nIt can only help to reduce the
    id-time [in some cases, if there is a digital font] and thus allowing anybody
    interested to deepen their knowledge, to spend his time better by searching for
    additional information.\r\n\r\nPS: I know there are actually many people on this
    board using Find my Font to provide font-ids (although most of them have never
    publicly admit it)."
