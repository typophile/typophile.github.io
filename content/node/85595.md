  from the cover of 'The Firebird', a collection of Russian Fairy Tales from 1935
  (I think). Here's a link to the full cover:- http://kuala06skylab.blogspot.com/2010/10/blog-post_8313.html\r\n\r\nAny
  help would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\ncrssp\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/0011_3721.jpg]\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Unfortunately it looks to be hand-lettered - the slight differences between
    the /E/s and /R/s are a dead giveaway.\r\n\r\nThe only typeface I've been able
    to find which mimics Old Church Slavonic (which is the writing system that's been
    inspirational here) is ParaType's [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/izhitsa/|Izhitsa]].
    Unfortunately it's not as good as the above ans shares few other characteristics."
