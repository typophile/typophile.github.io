  body: "The thing about IDing a font from numbers is that you sometimes can't be
    sure whether you're looking for a serif or sans face. You have to be prepared
    to look at thousands of fonts, unless you recognize them from the start.\r\n\r\nI'm
    sorry to say this, but it would have to be a really SLOW day for me to want to
    spend that much time hunting for a font based on two numbers. This looks maybe
    like a condensed sans to me, but it might be a slab serif too.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I must have had nothing else to do ;-)\r\n\r\nI concluded that this is probably
    a slab serif, because few sans serif 2's look like this. My closest candidate
    is <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/geometric-slabserif-703/?refby=bowfin\">Geometric
    703 Condensed</a>. This is the Bitstream version of Memphis, I think, but other
    Memphis versions didn't have the condensed weights.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
