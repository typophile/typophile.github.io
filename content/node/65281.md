  what a vertical axis is but I don't get the idea of horizontality.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for your help!\r\n\r\nD. "

  body: "The Romain du Roi was a very considered design where every line making up
    an individual letterform was forced to fit to a standardised grid (lines for both
    horizontal and vertical axis) which was used for all letters. Before the Romain
    du Roi it is obvious that punch cutters made their types align to the various
    vertical heights required: descender, baseline, x-height, cap-height and ascender
    lines \u2013 but it was likely to be a more random consideration for how the letter
    would fit on the horizontal. This was more a matter of a judgement by eye. This
    was restricted somewhat by perhaps having a set of predetermined widths to fit
    types onto but this wasn't really necessary until machine manufactured type for
    the compositors [Speculation].  So perhaps up until Romain du Roi type widths
    were random - Can anyone confirm or deny this?\r\n\r\nConsider that Gutenberg
    had same letters of various widths so as to fill out lines. Setting type (by hand)
    always needs variables to make the system work. i.e being able to add in various
    widths of space to make a line of type fit its set measure.\r\n\r\nFor Romain
    du Roi, fitting the design to a specified grid structure was less a mechanical
    requirement , but rather one of aligning letters to the 'high art' of geometry.
    [See D\xFCrer, Albrecht (1471\u20131528), German engraver and painter also did
    an investigation into the geometry of letterforms]. The designs were being created
    in a time where geometric purity in architecture and the arts were desired, especially
    by the King, and the illuminati.\r\n\r\nI hope others can add a couple of references.
    Interesting topic.\r\n\r\n/michael\r\n\r\n"

  body: "To me \"horizontal axis\" means the horizontals are thicker then the verticals,
    which is not at all the case with the RdR. Excoffon and Bloemsma are the two best-known
    designers of such fonts.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    I (and I think most people) would refer to as vertical axes\r\n(such as in the
    RdR). Maybe because they imagine a horizontally-\r\noriented pen?"

  body: "For everything else - the thick horizontal bar makes sense (Antique Olive
    etc.) but does not seem to fit for RdR...\r\nI see a horizontal bias only on the
    figure 7 as you might expect.\r\n\r\nSorry for big picture but good to look at!\r\n\r\nFrom:
    Jammes, Andr\xE9. La naissance d\u2019un caract\xE8re, le Grandjean. Paris: Promodis,
    1985.\r\n\r\nThe type used for the setting of the book was significantly based
    on the RdR original. (See the horizontal bar across the l).\r\n\r\n@dojr2 - can
    you elaborate more - was what you were told in response to a question you had?\r\n\r\n@hrant
    - I need to see Bloemsma. I am unfamiliar with this designer.\r\n\r\n@altaira

  body: Axis is usually reckoned through the thinnest part of the contrast, not the
    thickest -- hence the RdR has a predominantly vertical axis --, but this is just
    convention.
