  for a webshop. The logo seems done but feels unfinished or lacking impact in my
  view. Would like to hear your suggestions on how I could improve it for more impact."

  body: "<strong>Concept</strong>\r\nThe shopping bag to represent shopping is very
    obvious and forgettable.  Look at logos like amazon for an example of a great
    concept that keeps things memorable, simple and unique.  I would work more on
    the concept for sure.\r\n\r\n<em>Example:</em>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Amazon-logo_3556.gif]\r\n\r\n<strong>Execution</strong>\r\nThis
    seems more like an illustration than a logo.  You will want something more iconic
    and easily rendered as a favicon or single color print on a shipping box.  You
    have way too many tiny details and shadings to work in any situation other than
    large full color like your example.  Try looking at it scaled down to a postage
    stamp or printed on a pen.  An example of an iconic shopping bag logo (and a bit
    better concept) is shopping.com\r\n\r\n<em>Example:</em>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Shoppingcom-Logo_3734.gif]\r\n\r\n*Edit*\r\nLooking
    again, is that clipart or stock imagery?  That should be avoided at all costs.
    \ Have you considered hiring a logo designer?  That will get you a lot farther
    in my opinion, and there are a lot of great & inexpensive freelancers to choose
    from."

  body: "I agree with most everything that Luma Vine said. \r\n\r\nThe shopping bag
    may be an obvious concept, but it certainly has possibilities if you can find
    a more creative and practical way to use it in the logo. The way you're doing
    it lacks impact and wouldn't reproduce well, especially in one-color jobs or when
    the logo needs to be small.  I'd suggest trying some concepts using just a single
    bag, or if you want to have multiple bags maybe just have one in the foreground
    with the type on it and others just peaking out from behind."

  body: Great improvement!  The grey is looking a bit too light to stand out enough
    to me, especially when it has the same darkness as the colors.  I think that square
    around the symbol is not adding anything.  The stroke on the text will make it
    hard to read at small sizes.  I would go with solid letters.  There is also a
    bit of trouble with 'the' capitalization - the logic of capitalizing each word
    makes it seem like Allthe Deals.  Great update!

    as well hmm) however it will be placed on a blue banner, see below:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Logo-V5_4737.png]\r\n\r\nI've
    used some of your suggestions, it would look like this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Logo-V5a_5138.png]\r\n\r\nI
    agree with your comment on the box, without looks better however now the pricetages
    seem to be floating around a bit.\r\n\r\nOne more with the blue background:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Logo-V5c_5898.png]\r\n\r\nOne
    more with the blue background and white font:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Logo-V5d_6061.png]\r\n\r\nDamn
    it's hard to make a choice!"

  body: 'while you''re at, have you taken a look at removing the stroke off the tags?
    or at least on the three long sides of the tag and leaving the tip as is with
    the hole? might read easier. they feel a little heavy and came across as colored
    pencils. looks loads better though. great job! '

  body: "> while you're at, have you taken a look at removing the stroke off the tags?\r\n\r\nNow
    make All and Deals heavier and The - lighter. Push it to the right, away from
    the mark. Then consider different colors for the tags. What you have at the moment
    looks wildly random and \"loud\", overwhelming everything else in the logo (including
    the actual concept in the mark itself)."

    the colors I actualy did a lot of variations, actually using the colorwheel etc
    for complementary colors, although these are webcolors which slightly differ.
    \r\n\r\nAny suggestions? I would think they do need to stand out a bit as these
    do."

    I would strongly consider dropping the italics. It makes the logo look dated."

  body: "Your background color is the biggest issue right now.  Branding is more than
    just a logo, and the background color should be part of the larger picture of
    branding.  \r\n\r\nWhat is the concept behind making an X out of tags?  Could
    you find other ways to get at the same ideas?  The tags are ok but a bit expected.
    \ In the shopping.com example they have combined a smiling face with a checked
    box and a shopping bag.  Those three elements tell a story of a successful online
    shopping experience, and therefore make for a pretty good logo.  What story are
    you telling?"
