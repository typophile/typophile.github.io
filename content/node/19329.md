body: "So I'm at school and using ITC Tiffany for my current project. The family includes
  a Medium/Medium Italic, Light/Light Italic, Demi/Demi Italic and Heavy/Heavy Italic.\r\n\r\nI
  have my laptop in the labs and am trying to activate the font. I load it into Font
  Explorer X and activate it. Font Explorer activates it correctly but it comes up
  with an error about duplicate post script names, resulting in only being able to
  use the Medium and Heavy weights with Italics. I'm really looking to use the Demi
  weight...the lab workstations use FontBook and have no problem activating the whole
  family.\r\n\r\nHelp!"

  body: "David, you could try splitting up the font suitcase (the one with the screenfonts
    in it) into separate ones for each weight and just load the one for Demi, together
    with the corresponding printerfont.\r\nYou'll have to do it under Classic or on
    an older Mac with OS 9 on it, with Font/DAMover."
