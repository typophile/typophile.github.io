  body: 'OK, so I think I figured out what the problem is&#0151;now it&#39;s just
    a matter of developing some sort of cheap work around. Hopefully one that&#39;s
    not too clumsy. If anyone&#39;s listening to me talk to myself, feel free to chime
    in with your opinion. <BR> <BR><b>The problem:</b> <BR> <BR>&#40;1&#41; Flash
    only enjoys working with the native codepage of the OS that it&#39;s working with.
    So Flash on my US version of Windows XP spits out the text formatting from the
    the 874 Thai codepage. So that: as I&#39;m typing, Windows handles the text processing
    &amp; all is good, but when I&#39;m done Flash takes over and fu&copy;ks it all
    up. <BR> <BR>&#40;2&#41; It&#39;s possible to call up Unicode points using variables
    in dynamic text fields&#0151;which seems like it would sort everything out. But
    it&#39;s [seemingly] impossible to embed the necessary characters from the PUA&#0151;so
    this too is useless. Well, since the end user would have to have the font installed
    to see things correctly. <BR> <BR>&#40;3&#41; It&#39;s also possible to use external
    UTF8 encoded files &#40;a la Notepad&#41; to generate Unicode characters in Flash,
    but the same embedding problems apply. I don&#39;t know the Actionscripting for
    that anyway :-/ <BR> <BR><b>The solution:</b> <BR> <BR>&#40;1&#41; Theoretically,
    users running Windows Thai edition won&#39;t have any problem using the font as
    it conforms to the 874 codepage. So in this case no fix is necessary.  <BR> <BR>[<i>downfall:</i>
    I still need to test this on Windows Thai] <BR> <BR>&#40;2&#41; It seems, for
    2000 and XP users, that a font could be built using GPOS and GSUB to do the vowel
    positioning and/or substitution. I.e., the vowels could be removed from the PUA,placed
    in points in the 1252 codepage, and that way they could be embedded in Flash.  <BR>
    <BR>[<i>downfall:</i> apps &amp; OSs that don&#39;t like GPOS &amp; GSUB will
    be screwed] <BR> <BR>&#40;3&#41; Or I could build a propietary keyboard driver,
    and map the variously positioned vowels &#40;once again, placed in the 1252 page&#41;
    to different key combinations.  <BR> <BR>[<i>downfall:</i> non-standard and clumsy
    text imput method] <BR> <BR>Argh.'

  body: As I understand it type design in Thailand is undergoing a bit of a slump.  <BR>
    <BR>K. Punlop seems to be the main commercial font vendor, and Pongsathorn Sraouthai
    leads certain Open Source efforts. As I understand it neither vendor is actively
    making OpenType Thai fonts. I think one of the official Thai Linux implementations
    uses fonts designed outside of Thailand, by Yannis Haralambous &#40;I could be
    wrong&#41;. <BR> <BR>Most of the Thai fonts Microsoft ships were acquired from
    a company called Unity Progress which has gone out of business.  <BR> <BR>Cheers,

  body: '&#62;type design in Thailand is undergoing a bit of a slump <BR> <BR>That&#39;s
    probably an understatement :-/ I know a handful of people from Thailand, but none
    of them are type designers. Artists &amp; farmers mostly. One of them lives upstairs
    and has a localized Thai OS, but he&#39;s in Chiang Mai until the end of the month.
    So testing isn&#39;t a huge problem - just a waiting issue. <BR> <BR>In the meantime,
    I&#39;ve figured out how to make the diacritics and vowels sit in the right places
    by using ActionScript to import UTF-8 encoded .txt files. But I still can&#39;t
    alias and/or embed the fonts without problems. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve thrown together
    <a href="http://www.eightyproof.com/image/bitthai/none.gif" target="_blank"> a
    file comparing several fonts</a> - and I&#39;m led to believe it&#39;s an issue
    with Flash and not with the fonts. I&#39;ve got Unity Progress&#39; Dillenia,
    PSL&#39;s Chamnarn, Norasi &#40;which is one of Yannis Haralambous&#39; fonts&#41;,
    Tahoma, and my Daasaang.  <BR> <BR>&#40;1&#41; <a href="http://www.eightyproofpress.com/image/bitthai/alias.gif"

    href="http://www.eightyproofpress.com/image/bitthai/alias_embed.gif" target="_blank">
    aliasing <i>and</i> embedding causes the diacritics to disappear</a>. Problem
    2 might be caused by Flash only embedding the Unicode points within the Thai range
    - because the 874 codepage calls up the correctly placed diacritics from the PUA.
    <BR> <BR>I suppose I just need to find a Flash guru to sort me out. In the meantime
    though I will try to contact some of the folks you&#39;ve suggested Hrant. Thanks

  body: Jesus and Mary. So I figured out how to add my own custom embedding range
    for the Thai characters in the PUA. Thought I was on the home stretch. Had already
    opened the champagne even. But when I embed &#40;choosing Basic Latin, Thai, &amp;
    my custom PUA&#41; I still get my jacked up glyphs.  <BR> <BR>So...until I embed,
    I assume Windows is handle glyph processing. I.e., Windows is controlling which
    glyphs appear for which character code. At that point, in the right contexts,
    0xE9 is being represented by any of u&#43;0E49, u&#43;F706, u&#43;F70B, or u&#43;F714.
    [based on certain APIs, correct?]  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/23683.gif"
    alt=""> <BR> <BR>Once I embed however, it seems that Windows glyph processing
    is beaten down by Flash&#39;s big clumsy stick. Even though my PUA glyphs are
    [supposedly] embedded, they&#39;re no longer being called. Notice below that &#40;1&#41;
    the first cluster&#39;s tone mark is too high, &#40;2&#41; is perfect, &#40;3&#41;vowel
    collides with the ascender, &amp; &#40;4&#41; well, the consonant should be subbstituted
    so you can see the vowel below. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/23684.gif"
    alt=""> <BR> <BR>I&#39;m working under the impression - correct me if I&#39;m
    way off base - that even though Flash is somewhat Unicode savvy, it works with
    the codepage of your OS. So, theoretically, if I localize my machine &#40;XP Pro&#41;
    for Thai, Flash shouldn&#39;t have problems with the Thai codepage. But that&#39;s
    not what I&#39;m seeing. I&#39;m getting the same output whether I&#39;m localized
    for English, Thai, or a good ol&#39; southern drawl.  <BR> <BR>Is there a way
    around this? I&#39;m beginning to feel even dumber than usual. I&#39;m starting
    to dream about this for Chrissakes.

  body: I never found a good resolution, Hayden. I ended up writing a macro for Word
    that turns the characters into Unicode values, and then a bunch of other macros
    that do the glyph substitutions. It&#39;s a pretty heavy-handed and ungraceful
    hack, but it works. Wish I had better news for you.
