  body: The only Parisine is the largest lettering. The rest is Gill Sans Italic and
    some small Roman Gill Sans at the very bottom. If your question is why they used
    the two different styles instead of just Parisine with it&#39;s own italic, maybe
    the poster designer didn&#39;t vote for Parisine ;-&#41;

    fantastic Parisine for everything on the poster.. <BR> <BR>beats me..  and i have
    never been quite fond of the &#34;p&#34; in Gill Sans...   <BR> <BR>i bought some
    of the Relay from Fontbureau last week  &#40;could not afford the complete kit
    and kin, so i shall have to get them 1 by 1&#41; <BR>and Man.. i really love the
    way they &#34;cut&#34; the font...   <BR>it feels like a Gill Sans/Johnston Underground
    with magic touch of Americanism...  like Interstate. <BR> <BR>sometimes i think
    i am crazy for being so in love with a font. <BR>'

    I see your point, but I fail to see  <BR>the added value of using Gill Sans Bold
    Italic  <BR>specifically in combination with Parisine. In this  <BR>case I would
    have gone for Parisine Italics or  <BR>another face altogether, as Gill Sans yells
    too  <BR>loudly &#34;London Underground&#34; to be used for the  <BR>Paris RATP.

    they knocked through into Paddington station or something and they&#39;re trying
    to introduce the idea to the French very gently. <BR> <BR>M.
