body: "(I should preface this by saying that the book mentioned below is fantastic,
  and I'd recommend it to everyone. However...)\r\nHere's a book jacket design that's
  so bad, it's comical:\r\n[[http://www.amazon.com/Great-Unraveling-Losing-Our-Century/dp/B000OZ28CE/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-5397305-4613716?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1186412955&sr=8-1]]\r\n\r\n\"The
  Great Unraveling: Losing Our Way in the New Century\", by Paul R. Krugman\r\n\r\nLook
  at the little \"foldover\" triangle at the top right of the red rectangle. What's
  up with that? Is it a piece of Rubylith that started to peel off the board? (for
  those old enough to remember.) \r\nNo, I think it's actually supposed to be a visual
  reminder of the title, \"...Unraveling\". Besides the fact that the idea is lame,
  cliche'd and obvious, it doesn't even make sense! That's not a picture of unraveling,
  for that you'd need something woven. That might work if the book was titled, \"The
  Great Dog-Eared-ness\"!\r\n\r\nJason C"

  body: "Besides which, \"unravel\" is a tricky word. Like \"moot,\" it's gradually
    shifted in meaning over time to sort of mean its opposite. \r\n\r\nIn any case,
    the key idea the word is intended to evoke in this context is the movement from
    an ordered state to a disordered state. The logic might have been that if a firmly
    affixed sticker somehow represents order, then peeling it off achieves a kind
    of disorder. Still kind of lame. \r\n\r\nWhat do other books in this genre typically
    look like, though? Perhaps  this sort of book's ideal reader prefers sober, flag
    colors to a clever interpretation of the book's content/title. "

    need to know it''s BIG. '

  body: "In large publishing houses in NY - this book would be considered a low-budget
    book. No money alloted for art or freelance design. Just someone in the \"bullpen\"
    asked to put together a type cover... and well, with their inexperience or lack
    of knowledge of type of fonts out there - this is a typical effort for the project.\r\n\r\nIt
    is not alone - there are many out there just like this.\r\n\r\nDo you remember
    in the 1980s when Jove Books put out \"Generic Covers\"? They were white backgrounds
    with black slab face fonts -- just like the generic toilet tissue, lotions, etc.
    that the supermarkets were selling at the time. The first book was a huge success
    - however, the company decided to launch a series based on the first one - generic
    mystery, generic romance, etc. and it failed - big time!\r\n\r\nSo I guess W.W.
    Norton just didn't have the money to do anything to help Paul Krugman have an
    attractive cover. Maybe they thought his name alone would help sell the book?"

    copies there than the US cover would have. I don't know if it would have worked
    in the US, especially four years ago.

    but back then I remember reading about the British cover elsewhere... perhaps
    in a print magazine. That article said pretty much the same thing you're saying.
