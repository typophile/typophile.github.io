  is a type design studio that produces [[typeface|typefaces]] for commercial use
  or sale.\r\n\r\nThe term foundry has its roots in dead technology wherein type makers
  would cut their [[sort|sorts]] out of metal. Some modern type designers are transitioning
  to the term type studio instead.\r\n\r\nSee also [[Foundries]]."
