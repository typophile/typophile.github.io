body: I'm in a diploma in writing and publishing and am taking a class on letterpress
  printing. One of our assignments was to clean and identify some type cases. These
  are two type samples that I can't identify. I've already tried what the font and
  have looked through a lot of books and have come up with nothing. Similar types
  will not work in this case as I need to know the exact name of the type. Any help
  will be greatly appreciated.
