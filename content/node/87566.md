  in style to 'Konstruct Square' -\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?productid=475162\r\n\r\nThis
  will primarily act as the main font for the logo and any headings but I was curious
  what people's opinions would be for a good secondary typeface, that would compliment
  this one when used alongside for body text?  My initial thoughts are a mono-space
  typeface. \r\n\r\nI admit this is potentially a very open question and has endless
  options for choice... but think of it in terms of - you have this 'squared' typeface
  what would be your initial choice for pairing with it."
