  body: "\"Pinch to the _C_\" is actually a thickening of the lhs stroke caused by
    the addition of median/medial spurs. \r\nMedian spurs were usually used on Tuscan,
    i.e. split or fishtail terminal fonts, rather than ones with flat terminals.\r\nAgree
    with Ryuk's list of similars. \r\nAnother: Font Mesa's Cowboy Western http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/cowboy-western/\r\nAnother,
    \ digitized by Dan X. Solo under the name Cavalcade. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CavalcadeasCOMER_6108.jpg]\r\nUnfortunately
    the only legitimate way to get this font is by purchase of a new or used copy
    of \"24 Circus Display Fonts (Dover Electronic Display Fonts) (CD-ROM and Book)\"\r\nDon"
