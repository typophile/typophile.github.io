  that uses them to make an income in any way so I stick to free fonts.\r\n\r\nI was
  hoping someone might be able to tell me about a font similar to PMN Caecilia that
  I could get for free.  I'm in love with the font, but of course I can't find it
  for free.\r\n\r\nMuch appreciated,\r\nCourtney"
