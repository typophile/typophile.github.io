body: Anybody here have broadcast design experience? I do, but I&#39;ve never worked
  with credits at the end of a film.  <BR> <BR>I offered to do some pro bono design
  for a documentary filmmaker.  She has a thing for Verdana, though I have doubts
  about using it in a broadcast format.  The regular weight seems a little too thin
  for NTSC and buzzes at the smaller sizes.  The bold is too hefty for credits.  If
  only....there was a weight in between the two. <BR> <BR> You have to pack so much
  type into credit pages. And with the low res NTSC environment, it seems to require
  a simple open sans serif, like akzidenz. <BR> <BR> <BR>Is there a font that is closer
  to verdana with a full range of weights?   <BR> <BR>Thanks!
