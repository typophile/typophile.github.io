  machines in operation!), located next door to a shop that sells nothing but custom
  paper from around the world... \r\n\r\nhttp://vimeo.com/33359230\r\n\r\nI think
  it's an awesome video because it's a real hard look at life refusing to quit.\r\n\r\n:) "

      is a great video by the way, very enjoyable. I laughed very hard when the guy
      said he couldnt afford to pay the electric bill.  Ah HA HA HA HA! Ah HA HA HA
      HA! \r\n\r\n;-p\r\n\r\nNo I really did think it was well done though."

  body: "FYI, FWIW \u2014 The machine used for the film\u2019s titles is the Linotype.
    Those are the mats being assembled for casting, and the letters you see are the
    references stamped on the back so you can confirm your work as you key it in.
    (These reference letters are basically generic and not representative of the face
    and style being set.)\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s also a passing shot, early on, of an
    operator at the Linotype keyboard.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the machine demonstrated
    at length \u2014 the one used for casting \u201CGeorge Lucas\u201D \u2014 is a
    Ludlow, I\u2019m pretty sure.\r\n\r\n"

  body: INK and PAPER were statements <em>and</em> PRINT modifiers. As statements,
    they set fg/bg for all following screen-affecting statements. As modifiers, they
    changed the colours temporarily. Look for a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum|Sinclair
    ZX Spectrum]] emulator if you want to play with this stuff.

  body: "The machine <strong>is</strong> a Ludlow.\r\n\r\nIn my home town the <em>Hobbycraft</em>
    chain has recently succeeded in closing down the last of the two independent artists'
    materials shops. Our only choice now is their range of pre-packaged crap. And
    if they don't have what you want they <strong>won't</strong> get it for you the
    next day.\r\n\r\nAs the guys in the video said (more or less), they just don't
    fit in our modern world.\r\n\r\nSHAME ON YOU WORLD. You are a sadder place without
    them."

    sell artists' materials, and I believe that most of them are independents, although
    at least one chain has a presence.
