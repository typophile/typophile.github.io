    translation: It\u2019s not capital what connects us, it\u2019s the small capitals."

    I would get rid of the word \"capitalism\". Were there not banks under Hitler,
    Mao, Mussolini, Marx etc (even if some were nationalized). Why not just say banks
    and leave out the \"C\" word. \r\n\r\nOr just ask about typefaces associated with
    the financial community.\r\n\r\nMichael"

    comparing two histories, the first of typography and capitalism and the second,
    typography and financial institutions.\r\n\r\nSo if you know of any good sources
    for either, i will certinally add them to my list.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nJ\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Jay\r\n\r\nI doubt you will find any books on this as the two subjects stand
    too far apart. I would suggest examining economic cycles and industrial production.
    In this case, say, design and sales of typefaces during periods of prosperity
    and recession. Capitalism is all about economic cycles, is it not? For instance,
    the back to back recessions that are termed the Great Depression had a significant
    impact on both new designs and production of Monotype faces. Why were/are Centaur
    and Bembo more successful/popular than Pastonchi? Well, examine the years of design
    and production and compare these to the worldwide economic situation of the time
    period. I've done a couple of these and it changes your viewpoint. Aesthetics
    are popularly, and intellectually lazily, assigned to the success of a typeface,
    when it is far more often due to other unacknowledged or forgotten factors, such
    as popular culture, economics, technology, etc.\r\n\r\nGerald"

    the connection between the mercantilism of the Netherlands and the darker, more
    condensed and economic type style, coined <em>go\xFBt hollandois</em> by Pierre-Simon
    Fournier (<em>le Jeune</em>)."

    stock certificates. Jay Parinno I believe. It has been a while. Some absolutely
    beautiful work. If you do not find it let me know and I will dig back through
    my history.\r\n\r\nMichael"
