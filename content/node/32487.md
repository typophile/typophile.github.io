    very over the crashing on my intel laptop. \r\n\r\nCant wait either way. . . "

    sure I understand your comment. CS 3 may include some fixes too complex to include
    in a CS 2 update. However, it will also contain new features, and hence new bugs.
    Some designers are only recently switching to CS 2. InDesign 4.0.4 is going to
    be as good as it gets for a while...."

      hence the bugs and crashes that are on top of anythign else that arleady exists.
      To run  CS2 on the Mactel requires that slug of a program Rosetta to run behind
      the scenes. \r\n\r\nThere have been a number of other duiscussions regarding
      these Intel crashes. "

    date is the release date. Based on past announcements, it would be 6 to 8 weeks
    to ship date. But things are different this time. There never was a pre-announcement
    1 year early, as Chizen did last year, and there was never a public beta before.\r\n\r\n>
    I wonder if there will be any mention of typography, or even OpenType?\r\n\r\nI
    suspect we will see a glyphs palette like ID has in Photoshop (or is that already
    in CS2 ... I skipped that one)."

    seem like worthy upgrades. There was almost no mention of new type features (if
    there are any), but some seem to be implied. \r\n\r\nFor example, Flash can now
    import Photoshop and Illustrator files directly, and one of the options is to
    keep imported text editable. This seems to imply that Flash will now support OpenType.
    If not, then I'm not sure how this could work. The question is, if this is true,
    what is the extent that Flash users will have to OT features, etc.?\r\n\r\nAlso,
    I noticed on the <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator/features/allfeatures/\">feature
    list</a> for Illustrator CS3 a bullet point that says \"Advanced typography.\"
    It has a little plus sign disclosure box, which usually means more information
    hidden below, but it doesn't do anything if you click on it."

      shipping in April 2007. Adobe Creative Suite 3 Production Premium and Adobe
      Creative Suite 3 Master Collection will begin shipping worldwide in the third

      why the heck does Adobe seperate \"Production\" from \"Design?\" I can see (a
      little) where Web Designers wouldn't want to mess with a lot of pre-press stuff,
      but C'MON ALREADY -- Most of the world still needs ink on paper, and that means
      designers who know production!\r\n\r\nConsidering that A) the \"art\" of production
      (those professionals whose one-and-only job is pre-press) has continually dissolved
      over the years as more and more of the \"production\" burden is rolled into
      the designers' work (\"just send me the file...\" -- who cares if it's not color-corrected/separated/etc.),
      and B) Adobe spends so much of their press time hyping the concept of multi-purposing
      documents (\"...your InDesign print job transfers seamlessly into Dreamweaver
      and displays on a Nokia phone!\"), WHY OH WHY does Adobe kepp \"crippling\"
      their mainstream (read: affordable) bundles by leaving out real production tools?

    bundle or the Dreamweaver/Flash/Fireworks bundle for $1999 and $999 respectively.
    The three "Premium" bundles take, say the basic "Design" bundle and add a couple
    of "Web" apps (but not all the "Web" apps). The thing that seems to be missing
    in this line up is a basic "Production" bundle (After Effects/Premier/Soundbooth/Encore)
