  body: I&#39;m sorry to see no one has commented yet. I think this is remarkable.
    <BR>I love the drafting/architectural feel. It&#39;s like techno-deco. <BR>There
    is room to create useful alternates like an A that leans the  <BR>other direction
    &#40;a la Avant Garde Alts&#41; for fitting with upright  <BR>letters to its right.

  body: I have seen similar type design before, although this one is certainly unique.
    I wonder why you created it. Was it project specific, a partial alphabet design
    from a branding/identity job,  <BR>a consumer face or just experimental. As you
    may have anticipated the critique would be with regards to consistancy. <BR>Some
    character need a bit more work. The numerals are great, why not add old style
    numerals. I will try to think of where I have seen this type of design before.

  body: Hi there. I guess my last post didn&#39;t make it. My laptop ran out of juice
    during my upload. Well moving along. I think this is a very innovative design,
    I have seen this direction in type design before and I have been racking by brain
    trying to figure out where I saw similar type of work. Regardless this type of
    work is very interesting as an artistic expression. I am wondering if there is
    any &#40;for lack of a better term&#41; sacred geometry applied. I see repetition
    of circles and angular strokes. Kris could you please elaborate on your general
    concept. Was a few of the forms from a logo you created and then decided to expand
    on the design and build a full face?

    Ott&#43; Stein used a character or two similar to your work in their designs.

  body: Thank you for the comments and critiques. This display typeface was actually
    conceived for a graduate class in Typography. The general idea came out of looking
    at Wolfgang Weingart&#39;s My Way to Typography, a book on Frank Lloyd Wright,
    and various other sources like Metropolis magazine. In addition I was looking
    at research by Nikola Tesla and his theories on acoustic resonance--hence the
    name.   <BR> <BR>All of these sources seem to &#34;resonate&#34; something to
    me and came together through my sketches. I wanted to create an original typeface
    that reflected my interests in several areas of contemporary design. And even
    though my background is not in architecture, I often draw from other media and
    disciplines for inspiration.  <BR> <BR>Also, I can perhaps see the resemblance
    to Ott &amp; Stein&#39;s work, but this was not a source I looked at when researching.
    <BR> <BR>Keeping a consistent look and feel for each letter and number is difficult
    and I will continue to develop my designs. Again, I appreciate any and all comments/crits.
