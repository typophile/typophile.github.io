  value of 1000 UPM I get really poor results. With a value of 2000 UPM the quality
  is at least acceptable. Both FontLab and FontQA give me errors because of the differing
  values.\r\n\r\nSo I wonder: What problems could I run into if I use an UPM value
  of 2000 in an CFF OpenType font?\r\n\r\nRalf\r\n\r\n"

    not sure what Chris means by \"the UPM value is consistent with the actual outline
    size.\" Perhaps he just means that the outlines should not be massively larger/smaller
    than the UPM, which is good advice.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

    a factor of the square root of 2 and therefore can be expressed more quickly by
    a computer. I think it was Vincent Connair who said it while he was at Microsoft.

  body: "ChrisL: powers of two used to be important for early TrueType rasterizers,
    back when integer math was considerably faster than floating point. They have
    never been relevant for Type1 rasterizers. It might still be worth worrying about
    if you're designing TT outlines for handheld devices, but modern CPU's process
    floats just as fast, or faster, than integers.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, it's possible
    to do fractions in Type1 (and OT CFF), so the units per em is not really a hard
    limit the way it is in TT. FontForge can do fractions (it's turned off by default),
    and I wouldn't be surprised if other tools could too. A font with 1000 and fractions
    will have fewer potential compatibility problems than one with a nonstandard em
    size. Fonts with nonstandard units are valid, but the problems come when you do
    glyph substitution and replacement across multiple fonts, and when buggy applications
    get confused by the metrics. But for this application, it doesn't sound like any
    of these problems are particularly worth worrying about. You need lots of units
    to represent your detail, so go for it."

  body: "As far as we were ever able to determine at Adobe, the \"power of 2\" thing
    stems from optimizing scaling operations for Motorola 68000-series CPUs, which
    could use binary bit-shifting for multiplication.\r\n\r\nWe attempted to test
    this, and were unable to discover any measurable performance differences in rasterization
    for slight differences in em-square values on Intel or PowerPC hardware, across
    a variety of sizes.\r\n\r\nBut it's still a Microsoft requirement today. It's
    possible that some tools or environments have dependencies on a 2048 em for TT
    outlines. It's also possible that some tools or environments have dependencies
    on a 1000-unit em for Type 1 or CFF outlines.\r\n\r\nFor example, InDesign CS1
    and earlier assume a 1000-unit em (for Type 1 and CFF) when determining cursor
    and selection size, which can cause a cosmetic problem. One can imagine more serious
    problems, but I haven't seen any (yet).\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT\r\n"
