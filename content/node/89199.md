  body: "Hmmmm \u2026\r\n\r\nNot bad. Really, not bad. But:\r\n\r\nFirst of all, what
    are you trying to say about you? Do Electra and Trade Gothic say it? Does your
    layout say it?\r\n\r\nI would want to see, right under your name, a description
    of what you do: John Smith, graphic designer.\r\n\r\nToo much internal white space.
    Try moving the date column closer to the text column, maybe flush right.\r\n\r\nTrade
    Gothic with crazy Caslon ital style ampersand works for Barnes and Noble; not
    working here\r\n\r\nWhere's your focal point? Not sure what path my eye is supposed
    to follow.\r\n\r\nWhy the wavy underlines? Don't match anything else.\r\n\r\nNitpicking:
    \"@\" in e-mail is too high (the a part sits on the baseline); ditch parens and
    add hyphen in phone number \u2014 area code isn't optional anymore; what's wrong
    with the letterspacing in paragraph under \"design intern\"?; York comma PA no
    comma 18104; what's \"Word/ Office\"?\r\n\r\nMake the important things stand out.
    The headings are not important; your experience is.\r\n\r\nBullet points aren't
    sentences. Don't design them like they are.\r\n\r\nOverall, it's just a bit bland.
    But keep working on it!"
