  logos I am unsure about -- I played with the type more then I played with the colors.
  Your critique would be appreciated. Just wanna get your thoughts before I move ahead.
  If you have any additional questions, feel free to ask.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\nbrin"

  body: I love the font and the dark green colour you use on some of the first options.
    So I think definetely on the way. Quite like the first option with the circles...could
    you just loose the icon all together? Just think the icon is a bit too fussy and
    it needs more simplicity. The second options are good too but the different colours
    almost look a bit child focussed so maybe something abit crisper? Perhaps less
    wavy almost?

  body: "Oh thank you chasteauneuf for your feedback!!! =)\r\n\r\nThe child like colors
    were suppose to be \"rgb\" -- that's the only reason I used it. Not my most favorite
    combo. \r\n\r\nI did play with the type and kerned and tweaked the hell out of
    it. But I don't know how interesting it would be without the visual elements in
    both the options. \r\n\r\nThe idea for the circles comes from mathematical theories
    (but that is way to technical and off base with what the company does). So I refined
    it to be a simpler and more visual appealing. \r\n\r\nThe test tube idea came
    from reading some of the copy (i.e. business plans/elevator pitch) and even though
    there isn't a lab. The words \"experiment\" \"mix\" \"blend\" were words reoccurring
    in the copy. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
