Sure, it's a design in the same genre, and one which some folks think is better. It's not as &quot;in your face&quot; with its geometric underpinnings, which is either a good or bad thing, depending on one's point of view. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T</div>

No typeface came from nothing. <BR> <BR>About the ATypI survey, yes, I tried first to post that on the news, last week, but nothing happened and the news wasn't posted (perhaps due to TypeCon, the moderator find something more interesting to do :-) <BR> <BR>So, there is already 3 places where that survey is discussed, well why not?

One Monotype manager described it to me as 'a moment of moral weakness' on the part of his company. <BR> <BR>Avenir is a new typeface in the same genre as Futura, with totally different proportions and 'colour'. Yes, Linotype are marketing it, in some respects, at the expense of Futura by making comparative statements. This wouldn't be my approach to marketing a typeface, but there's a difference between this and cloning a typeface.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nigel, this quote that you keep referencing is not even Linotype's main marketing push behind Avenir. This line appears on the inside cover of the broschure. It is not the &quot;tagline&quot; of the font family, just a quote from the designer himslef that is quite liked. Put this into perspective: Adrian Frutiger is one of the world's most respected type designers, living or dead. To insinuate that he is a font pirate is unfair. <BR> <BR>Linotype does sell basic commercial in its webs shop. The font description clearly states that it is based on the design of AG. I do not know anything about its design, but Linotype is not trying to cover up, or deny the existence of AG, or Berthold's right to sell it. BC is not a copyright infringement of their work in any country or jurisdiction. <BR> <BR>I hope that my views and opinions do not sound excessive. Although I am an employee of Linotype, I am not expressing any sort of official sentiments in my posts. This is all personal. To further elaborate, I will cease being an employee of LL on Sunday, as my German work permit has temporially expired. However, I would have gladly responded to your mis-formed opionions in the same fashion before I worked here, or knew any of its employees. And I can guarantee you that I will be just as feisty on Monday, because your viewpoint on Avenir is too complexly silly for me to possibly understand.</div>

I really like Avenir (whereas I'm not that fond of Futura), and I commend the honesty of attributing Futura as an influence, and as an alternative to. Let us remember that the two fonts are not the same, Nigel, and if you genuinely cannot see that, then can I recommend &quot;Elements of Typographic Style&quot; as the first book to add to your library.  <BR> <BR>Grrr.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This is my understanding of the situation: <BR> <BR>Linotype (D. Stempel AG) signed a license agreement with H. Berthold AG  <BR>on Akzidenz Grotesk in 1977 and sells its versions of this typeface  <BR>since then. No other existing type foundry has a longer, unbroken  <BR>history on this typeface. <BR> <BR>H. Berthold AG reported insolvency in 1993 and ceased to exist. This  <BR>company has no legal successor. <BR> <BR>There is no designer on Akzidenz Grotesk to be credited. The design  <BR>goes back to 1896, It is now a classic just as Bodoni, Garamond and  <BR>others are. Linotype digitized its own version. <BR> <BR>Berthold Type Ltd., Chicago, received US Trademark  <BR>registration on &quot;Akzidenz Grotesk&quot; on February 1st, 2000. <BR> <BR>After this, Linotype was forced to stop using the name &quot;Akzidenz  <BR>Grotesk&quot;. Linotype decided to invest time and money on other projects rather <BR>than on another legal battle with (name withheld). Consequently,  renamed the <BR>fonts: &quot;Basic Commercial&quot;.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nigel, I've spent all night researching German Trademarks. From my preliminary research, &quot;Akzidenz Grotesk&quot; is NOT a registered trademark in Germany, as far as I am aware. Perhaps you can show me otherwise. To provide me with the exact details of Akzidenz's registration in Germany, you may contact me either on or off this board. <BR> <BR>As Richard Hamilton stated above, Akzidenz Grotesk was registered by <i>he who must not be named's </i> Berthold in Feb. 2000 as a trademark in the <i>United States.</i> <BR> <BR><i>Linotype</i> has been selling Akzidenz Grotesk legally since the 1950s. This is impossible to dispute. All of the records are in its Bad Homburg office. A few years ago, the company changed the name of AG to Basic Commercial in its webshop soley to avoid a potential lawsuit from <i>he who must not be named</i>. BC is the same electronic font data that LL had previously been selling</div>

		<div class="commentbody">First you should get some sleep. <BR> <BR>It is quite easy for anyone to lookup online in the German trademark database that all of H. Berthold AG's trademarks were assigned to Berthold Types Limited early in 1998. I am sure Linotype can help you with this. <BR> <BR>In the ATypI survey people were harsh about Monotype and Book Antiqua. Linotype is no better, that's all. It is the nature of the type industry. <BR> <BR>If Linotype &quot;officially&quot; is interested in this post then they should join in rather than have you be their voice. <BR> <BR>I also noticed the other day that Linotype has applied for the &quot;Eurostile&quot; trademark in the U.S. When did they acquire those rights exclusively?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">First of all, Linotype is well aware of its own rights and legal satanding, and does not need to officially respond to your statements on this forum, which as Yves pointed out, are deliberately troll-like. While they do not need to officially respond. I personally  feel differently. I cannot understand how you can possibly agree with the statements you have entered here. Linotype, as a company, is not the one posting derogatory comments on several different web sites. It was you who started this discussion by trying to paint Linotype's Avenir Next in a false light. As I have recently designed a few promotional pieces for Avenir Next, I feel that your comments are a deliberate questioning of my ethical allegiances. I responding out of my own accord. I would not design type samples for stolen designs. <BR> <BR>However, the post that I made earlier this morning WAS slightly influenced by Linotype. Your defending of Berthold is a reiteration of a tired argument over the nature of that company. Linotype did assist me in a preliminary search of German trademark records. This preliminary search proved no apparent results for a Trademark on Akzidenz. The new Berthold DOES have many trademarks registered in Germany, however, I could not see AG on the list. Therefore, I am asking you directly to back up your statement, which I think is perfectly logical. I would do the same. If AG is registered here, Linotype would like to know that. As far as it is concerned, AG is not registered here at all. I am not denying Berthold's right to sell Akzidenz Grotesk. I also did a bit of asking around about Basic Commercial, since its provenance was specifically asked about. Again, for the last time, I am not a lawyer or spokesperson for the Linotype Library. I was, however, hired because in part because I am a native speaker (of English). I wrote the last post beacause I can write better English than most of the employees in the company (although I personally think that my writing is terribly awful! If I could be more concise, this argument would be over). If you would like to continue this discussion in German, I'm sure that you would get some interesting responses. <BR> <BR>As far as I am aware, there will be no &quot;official statement&quot; from Linotype, because my above points are correct, and Linotype has nothing to hide. <BR> <BR>Besides, as far as I know, &quot;official statements&quot; are really something for the lawyers. None of us here are lawyers. Ideally, we would all friends talking about the things we love most. <BR> <BR>Eurostil: On our website, it states that Eurostile is a registered trademark of Nebiolo. I do not know anything further about its case, however, Linotype would not register anything with anyone if it were a violation of any of its standing contracts. <BR> <BR>First you brought up Avenir Next in an attempt to paint Linotype in a bad light. No one held your argument for valid that Avenir is a Futura rip-off. Then you brought up Basic Commercial, which is not illegally sold (or named) either. Now, you are offended by some sort of purported moral violation on behalf of Eurostil. You seem to be grasping for straws.I am finding it difficult to maintain an appropriate level of coordial dialogue under these circumstances.</div>

One of the fundamental aspects of trademark law is that if you take a license for something you are prevented from challenging that which you licensed. Imagine the field day that Berthold would have with this. <BR> <BR>Also the fact that Linotype assisted you and your post included the term &quot;generic&quot; (which I do not think Akzidenz-Grotesk is) could be grounds for Berthold to take action certainly in the U.S. against Linotype as it could be grounds that Linotype is &quot;impairing Berthold's rights&quot; and that would certainly be standard trademark language in the Adobe agreement. <BR> <BR></div>

Berthold's trademark Akzidenz-Grotesk was assigned in 1998 to Berthold Types Limited so there was a successor to the type assets. &quot; </i> <BR> <BR>Nigel,  <BR> <BR>Your <i>pars-pro-toto</i>-style of concluding is inadequate and pre-mature. What you have written perhaps suggests that there was a successor to the <i>trademarks</i> in the type assets, but not to the type assets in its entirety. My understandins is that <i>type assets</i> include designs, digital data and trademarks. To my best knowledge, Berthold Types Limited never obtained the entirety of type assets of H Berthold AG, which was recently confirmed by [rot13]Uneirl Uhag[/rot13] on Typophile.  <BR> <BR><i>&quot;If you are correct that Linotype had a license agreement and if they used Berthold artwork for digitization then it should not sell Akzidenz-Grotesk under any name. &quot;</i> <BR> <BR>Linotype used old H Berthold AG's artwork for digitization of the typeface. However, note that there is currently no copyright owner on the design of Akzidenz-Grotesk even in Germany. The design was created more than 100 years ago for a now defunct company. The copyright has expired and there is no current owner. Berthold Types Limited did not &quot;inherit&quot; the copyright for the design.  <BR> <BR><i>&quot;One other important point that I neglected to mention. Linotype sold Akzidenz-Grotesk under one (Adobe) or two (H. Berthold AG) license agreements. One of the fundamental aspects of trademark law is that if you take a license for something you are prevented from challenging that which you licensed. &quot;</i> <BR> <BR>You seem to be ignoring the fact that trademarks are one thing and designs are another thing. While in the U.S. copyright does not generally apply to typeface designs, in the E.U. it does, or at least may. Speaking in European standards, and according to the Berne convention, the design of (the basic cuts of) Akzidenz Grotesk is public domain, the authors have been dead for a very long time and the company which marketed the designs is no more. The additional weights that have been created later by G.G. Lange may still be subject to copyright and they are not marketed by Linotype as &quot;Basic Commercial&quot;.  <BR> <BR>Adam</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Mr Hunt: <BR><i>(oh, I mean Nigel Hamilton&hellip;</i> or perhaps I really meant Harvey Hunt&hellip; <i>what's the difference; they are obviously the same person)</i> <BR> <BR>You keep mentioning that Berthold Types is the legitimate successor to H Berthold AG, yet recently, I've begun to hear that the legal facts in Germany state otherwise. Just because you repeat over and over again in an online forum that this is a legal fact does not make it true. <BR> <BR>In one respect, you are sadly not H Berthold AG's successor: H Berthold AG was one of the most respected player in the type business. It is clear that your new incarnation of the Berthold name, legal or not, has lost this respect, and that regaining it is not a priority. This is the feeling I get from reading your posts, as well as the tone of Bouncer and Nigel Hamilton's post, who are most likely just further aliases of yours. <BR> <BR>How about you just try being nice? Mies van der Rohe (ridiculous name dropping, I know, but the quote is great) once said that it was almost important to fight <i>for something,</i> not against something. How about we all work together as one community to protect all of our interests? <BR> <BR>(Please don't answer my post by saying something like <i>&quot;I would personally LOVE to work with the rest of community, but bad apples like that former employer of yours are already breaking the rules, so why should I follow them?&quot;</i> This would just be the repetition of a tired argument that is not upheld by anyone&hellip;)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nigel: <BR>&gt;Linotype propaganda. <BR> <BR>I don't know who you are, Nigel. But you're obviously hellbent on making a name for yourself by taking sides against the big guys &ndash; well, a couple of them &ndash; and creating a riot. The way in which you're doing this in this thread has not convinced me of your insight in letterforms, or of your intelligence. It did remind me of Beavis and Butthead at some point. <BR> <BR>H Hunt: <BR>&gt;Berthold Types owns the entire remaining type assets <BR> <BR>Now Berthold Types &ndash; that's a different thing. It seems to be tricky to comment on it in public because the company has a reputation for sueing anyone who expresses an opinion of it &ndash; as well as the forum where this happens. [Disclaimer: this is me, in Europe, expressing an opinion; Typophile has nothing to do with it.]  <BR>But as you're reading this anyway Mr Hunt: what is true of the rumor that you are reluctant to pay copyrights or percentages to the living designers whose typefaces you have  &quot;inherited&quot; from Berthold AG? Don't you agree that taking care of designers in a proper and decent way is the first duty of anyone claiming to represent a heritage of designs &ndash; and not just a bunch of legally protected font names? I'm not talking about finding a legal way *out* of paying rights: anyone with good lawyers, a lot of stamina and low moral values can do that. I'm talking about taking up responsabilities to living creative people. And ultimately, about being a good &quot;father&quot; of the cultural heritage you've acquired.  <BR>Note: this is not an accusation, it's a question. You answer it convincingly, I shut up. <BR>Jan</div>
