		<div class="commentbody"><p>The last time I heard from Andy he was going back to school.</p>
<p>I think he was involved somewhat with the letterpress configuration of the proprietary face for Arion Press, and I think he mentioned some involvement with the Yale Carter typeface.</p>
<p>But those are a couple/few years back already. And I&rsquo;m not sure if he was involved or not or whatever happened to him.</p>
<p>But in his short period of influence he changed us all. When grunge/post-modernism/de-constructionism/etc ruled the roost he brought us back common-sensically to the nuts and bolts of typography. We owe him a great debt.</p>

I tried contacting him several months ago using updated info I got from Chuck Creesy at Princeton University Press. But I received no reply from Andy. Last I heard, he was living in Bethesda, working for a publisher of some sort, I believe.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Lines &amp; Splines was one of the first type-related website I was aware of. Definitely the first type-related blog. (An earlier incarnation of David Earl&rsquo;s Typographer.org was around then, too, but I didn&rsquo;t know about it yet.) My recollection is that Typophile and Typographica appeared as Lines &amp; Splines disappeared.</p>
<p>Here is what it looked like in February 2001:</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/linesandsplines2001_6231.gif]</p>
<p>(I did this screen cap when Andy posted a link to an article I had just posted on my site, which is also how I found out about Lines &amp; Splines. It was the first I&rsquo;d heard of Joe Clark, too. Hi, Joe!)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hey all, I just got here from a Google search.  I used to know Andy in middle school and for a year in high school before I was kicked out.  Here&rsquo;s what I know:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>He was sort of a spaz in middle school.  (not that I had a better reputation)  He was sort of an over-active, pull girls' pigtails, don&rsquo;t-quite-fit-in type.  When I found Lines &amp; Splines I was amazed at how mature and brilliant his writing was compared to how I remembered him acting in person most of the time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He grew up in Bethesda, MD.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He and I were in a group of probably less than 10 people on BBSes in Pyle Middle school in 1991.  I remember asking him if he had a &ldquo;Focke&rsquo;s List&rdquo; for that month and when he realized I was a BBSer, he got really serious and intense.  He asked if I was on any &ldquo;elite BBSes&rdquo; but I didn&rsquo;t yet know what those were.  I lamely replied that I was an The Elite Few, which was a policy/politics debate BBS in Washington DC.  It was like being asked your favorite action movie and saying &ldquo;I only watch PBS.&rdquo;  He was not impressed, but later I think we shared some BBS numbers with each other.  It was strange seeing him talk about computers because he went from low on the totem pole socially to having a commanding presence. He wasn&rsquo;t a spaz when he talked about computers.</p>

<p>When Lines and Splines became the most respected blog on the planet (I remember thinking he was late to the game but it just didn&rsquo;t matter because he was so amazing) I wrote him an email telling him we went to middle school together.  He wrote right back.  When I explained who I was, he stopped writing.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t expect to see him make his presence known in the same way again.  Maybe he&rsquo;ll write a book.</p>
