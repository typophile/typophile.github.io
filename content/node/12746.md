  body: 'Glyn - I am a graphic designer, not a type designer, so my comments will
    be limited. 1) Technical merits/flaws: I think it has a very even "color" and
    nothing particularly stands out to me as looking odd, although a .pdf sample would
    be good in order to see the characters more closely. 2) Style & Fitness for Purpose:
    Of course this depends on the type of business. Seems to be a nice blend of humanist
    and grotesque sans styles. It varies enough from many other sans-serif types to
    be unique without calling too much attention to itself. 3) Originality: I think
    you''ve done an excellent job here, maybe not breaking new ground, but if you''re
    new to type design give yourself a break - this is a very impressive first attempt.'

  body: "Glyn, I think I'd seen this before, but had ignored it, because frankly there
    really have been too many conventional sans fonts released over the past few years.
    But then I read that this was your first attempt (really more than that) at a
    complete typeface! I'd like to be able to encourage your progress, since on many
    levels you seem to be doing really well. So could you please provide a PDF?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "It looks nice and fresh. Professional \"amateurs\" represent!\r\n\r\nThe
    tail of the Q seems a bit out of place to me. I would either bring it up to the
    baseline or crop it into a rectangle. Others may disagree, of course."

  body: "Thanks for all the comments and encouragement.\r\n\r\nThe counter of the
    'g' being too big has been a source of trouble. In the first cut, I copied the
    bowl of 'd' onto the 'g'. On a test print at 12 pt, the big counters were very
    noticeable. Also, the bottom counter was too small. I then lifted the base of
    the bowl above the baseline by 24 units, relative to an xheight of 484 and overshoot
    of 12. This appeared to fix both problems. This is the current version. If I need
    more correction (which I think I do), should I lift the base of the bowl further,
    or narrow the 'g' and keep the current lift?\r\n\r\nI agree about the tail of
    the 'Q'. I will try different types: a straight diagonal line as a rectangle (suggested
    above), a curve joined at the base, a curve crossing the base, etc.\r\n\r\nI will
    do a pdf sample shortly."
