  to The Baron Typeface, so quite tall and large but not too bold. \r\n\r\nI'm especially
  looking for a complete font family that would have also lower-cases but still it
  the Baron typeface look.\r\n\r\nhttp://fontfabric.com/baron-free-font/"

  body: "Hey, Thanks Plax but this is not exactly what I meant, I'm looking for font
    families that are simply sans serif, (not necessarily striked through or with
    orther lines on it) maybe with ligature though ! like the Megalopolis one. (http://www.smeltery.net/fonts/megalopolis-extra)\r\n\r\nSo,
    just normal sans serif font, not as big as Arial in width yet not condensed either,
    the size of Baron ! (in width) maybe more like Proxima Nova family, any other
    similar ideas ?\r\nhttps://typekit.com/fonts/proxima-nova"
