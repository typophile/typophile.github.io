  easy on me :)\r\nI found this typeface on a [[http://www.somostodosum.com.br|local
  website]] and have been trying to ID it for a while now. I've tried several online
  identifiers and found the results to be somewhat underwhelming. It's a small sample\u2014I
  can provide a longer one if it helps, but no larger unfortunately. Thanks in advance.\r\n\r\n(P.S.
  if anyone understands Portuguese, please ignore the glaring misspelling...)"

  body: There are thousands of handwriting fonts, so they can be difficult to ID,
    especially when all caps. If a similar font will do, have a look at <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/linotype/linotype_sketch/">Sketch</a>.

  body: Though the "S" is obviously different, one of the <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dtptypes/pen-tip-dt/thin-oblique/charmap.html">Pen
    Tip</a> fonts might also be an alternative.

  body: I realized it would be difficult to pinpoint :) Thanks everyone. I particularly
    like House Script as an alternative.
