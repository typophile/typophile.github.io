  body: Hard to say, very neutral, nothing really distinctive part of this pointy
    /V, that could be a lot of thing including some freebies. The only I have that
    looks to fit almost all specifications is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/thomas-kaeding/ollie-wollie|Ollie
    Wollie]] but I really doubt it could be the one, too much "exotic" to me... Possibly
    more suggestions to come.

  body: /V (pointy) and /C don't match to me. Try asking ([[http://www.thehcollective.com|website]],
    [[https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-H-Collective/324217044357213|Facebook]],
    [[https://twitter.com/hermioneolivia|Tweeter]]), they may answer (and drop the
    answer here).

  body: The closest I have at this time is [[http://www.houseind.com/fonts/neutraface2|Neutraface
    2 Text Book]]. The only letter that doesn't match is /M, even using the alternate.
    So may be they simply mirrored /W to create it.
