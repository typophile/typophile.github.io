  body: "Oddly enough, I think a good 'gravis' replacement could be <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/device/gravel/\">'Gravel'</a>,
    by Rian Hughes (Device). It has a lot of similarities, and could be tweaked to
    be even closer.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: I have no idea what these gravis people do, but we just designed everything
    for Germany's biggest Apple dealer, also called Gravis. I attach a few images.
    Gravis Rounded was designed by Christian Schwartz, based on FF Unit Alternate,
    and Gravis Hybrid by Susanna Dulkinys, based on a bitmap font i designed, based
    on FF Unit.
