  body: "I recognize this as an old Image Club font called Carolus Roman. It looks
    like it's been squooshed a bit. (edit: I can only find one version online now,
    and it's at <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/carolus-roman.font\">Dafont.com</a>;
    if someone knows of an existing commercial version, Yves can delete this link)\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Stephen's suggestion of Tiepolo is very good. Cynthia Hollandsworth's <a
    href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/hiroshige/\">Hiroshige</a> is also
    a beautiful calligraphic typeface, so is Arthur Baker's <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itfarthurbaker/hiroshige-sans/\">Hiroshige
    Sans</a>, and so are many fonts by Philip Bouwsma. (Also see my add-on note to
    my previous post)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
