  body: Though this looks very much like <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=FF.11553.0.1&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=PHOTOGRAPHER&sampleSize=32"
    target="new">FF DIN Light</a>, I think the minute inconsistencies and little flaws
    in the design indicate that this was done by hand. Observe for example that there
    are little "dents" where the curves go into straight lines.

  body: Then again, it could be [[YouWorkForThem]]'s <a href="http://youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T0044"
    target="new">Variable</a>. They are known for the sometimes rigid geometry of
    their faces.
