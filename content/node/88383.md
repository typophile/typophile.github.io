body: "Since this is my first post, I believe some introduction is in order: I'm Alexandre
  Ataide, from Bras\xEDlia, Brazil, 29, single, Libra and unemployed. I love type.
  Well, maybe I love calligraphy more, but hell, who's to judge ones heart? \r\n\r\nNow
  to business - I did that about 7 years ago, when I was graduating in graphic design.
  Was supposed to be used for signage. It's obviously very rough, but I would very
  much appreciate your opinion about the typeface. Please citique, criticise, flame,
  bash and/or troll to your hearts desire.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font_5143.png]\r\n\r\nP.S.:
  I have done but one commercial typeface, so to say, but I cannot show it to you
  :-[. At the time I was working at Banco do Brasil (it's a bank, in Brazil) and was
  commissioned a typeface for printing checks. It was security stuff, so I don't have
  access to the files. I don't think it would be a wise idea to post a picture of
  a check online, too. Anyway, the fonts are still in use, so, if you have an account
  on Banco do Brasil and you use checks you have seen my the typeface."

    what I see\r\nas a hint of blackletter. It will need a good deal of refinement
    though.\r\nThe first thing I would do is loosen the spacing.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Now that you mention, I do see some Textur in it. One of the reasons I never
    finished this concept is because I never felt it good enough. Looks kind of bland
    to me, not that bad, but lacking personality. I think there are much better blocky
    geometric stuff out there. Maybe adding some high doses of Rudolf Koch will give
    it more energy. Back to the quill for me.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot Hrant for the input."
