body: "I would love some feedback on the logo for Headfood.\r\nHeadfood is the new
  canteen for Vega the Brand Communication School. Vega is South Africa\u2019s premium
  school of design and branding. The idea is for the canteen to create food culture
  activities. It is the opposite of fast food and we want people to cerebrate their
  food (correct spelling - cerebral + celebrate ). The basic premise is that good
  food please all the sense and thereby\r\nstimulate the minds of young designers
  and innovators. The canteen will combine good natural food with technology like
  fingerprint identification for account holders and a beautiful stark interior.\r\n\r\nI
  used Joshua Darden\u2019s great Omnes font for the logo. Any feedback - spacing,
  legibility? I plan to use Omnes for all Menu boards and associated communication,
  and would like to laser cut the logo out of thick wood at the entrance.\r\n\r\nplease
  help?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/headdomnes_3484.jpg]"

  body: It seems like a great idea, but I struggled to read it. I'm wanting to read
    the H as an I.

  body: "It does seem like a great idea. I might narrow the head a bit \u2014 perhaps
    echo the shape of the D that forms the mouth \u2014 to make the character appear
    less overweight. It looks fun, but it also looks a bit fatty, which runs counter
    to your description."

  body: I agree, The H reads as an I. But I do think it's a great concept and would
    love if you made it work smoothly.

  body: You might find people read IDea FooD alternately, or even first, which seems
    to distort and reinforce the actual name. You've also got this sort of black face
    issue to consider.

  body: "It seems like it might read better if you rotated both the e and the a -
    all the other letters are sideways. The fact that the e and the a have a normal
    orientation probably helps to create the H reading as an I problem - it may be
    far easier to read if people don't have to decide which way to read each letter;
    make it obvious which way the H/I should be read. You could still have the e and
    a on the same line as above\r\n\r\n-Rafe"
