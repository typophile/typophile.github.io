  Type Designer I will come in several variants. A basic package, comparable to Fontographer
  2.0 in scope, will cost $449 for a private license. That is, the user cannot make
  fonts for sale. However, he can prepare fonts and logos for in-house use. Hint-insertion
  tools are an extra $750; the Optical Scaling module is a $1,000 option. <BR> <BR>Commercial
  font designers must pay a much higher price: $55,000 plus a royalty of $3.40 per
  face. Alternative licenses, trading off the up-front fee for higher royalties, may
  also be negotiated.&#34; <BR> <BR>Perhaps if it were under $50,000 it might be worth
  looking into.'

  body: This is the Kingsley stuff that Gerald Giampa is always hinting at, pardon
    the expression. <BR> <BR>The really interesting part is the optical scaling module,
    since it probably incorporated the ATF wizardry from the Benton era. But my guess
    is that once the Kingsley boys realized that you can&#39;t get rich doing this
    and decided to call it quits, they also decided to take the knowledge to their
    graves, damn everybody else and the large benefit to the craft of type design.
    <BR> <BR>But one of us will eventually reverse-engineer the stuff and pull the
    carpet from under them, hopefully before they all go six feet under, making them
    regret their grubbery. Even though I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a word. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: Yes, it was released. I have disks and documentation for ATF Type Designer
    version 1.3 and 1.4 stashed away in storage somewhere. It was roughly equivalent
    to Fontographer 2.x at the time of its release and I think I recall it having
    some basic hinting tools. I&#39;ll see if I can dig it up this weekend and post
    some additional information.

  body: I&#39;m aware of the ATF Type Designer software, but am not really excited
    by it. For one, how do we know that they really got the optical scaling stuff
    right? It&#39;s not as if Morris Fuller Benton himself wrote any of the code.
    <BR> <BR><a href="http://mooseyard.com/Jens/2004/04/jenss-tangled-job-history">Jens
    Alfke</a> worked on the software. Maybe it&#39;s worth asking him about it. There&#39;s
    also a bit of an ad blurb by <a href="http://members.aol.com/willadams/typetech.txt">Henry
    Schneiker</a>. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m also not really sure we need to understand exactly
    how ATF Type Designer accomplished its optical scaling. Adobe manages to crank
    out their share of optically scaled fonts, using Multiple Master technology at
    least internally, if not for release. Also, the landmark Metafont system &#40;part
    of TeX&#41; is capable of optical scaling, and the free Computer Modern fonts
    are optically scaled. Metafont is amazingly sophisticated, but unfortunately requires
    the equivalent of a computer science PhD to use effectively. I think a middle
    ground is possible - a highly interactive, visual tool that&#39;s powerful enough
    to make good optical scaling, but relatively simple to work with and not anywhere
    nearly as labor-intensive as current methods of optical scaling.

    <BR> <BR>Not really. We obtained ATF Type Designer on an evaluation basis and
    never actually used it for production. One of the reasons we were able to play
    with it was because we were licensing a ton of designs from ATF/Kingsley for the
    Image Club library. There were trying to get us hooked into supporting some of
    their attempts at &#39;diversifiction&#39;. The multi-thousand dollar commercial
    license that Richard mentions above would have certainly been out of the question
    for Image Club during that time. We were a dyed-in-the-wool Fog shop from day
    one.'

    <BR> <BR>We don&#39;t, but it&#39;s still our best bet. And maybe the Bentons
    documented everything &#40;they <i>were</i> engineers&#41; and the Kingsley boys
    got access to that. <BR> <BR>&#62; I think a middle ground is possible <BR> <BR>I
    remeber discussing exactly this some years ago on the TD list. I think the consensus

    mine does too, and that would make the effort to check it out worthwhile. <BR>

  body: I had a brief email exchange with Jens. He didn&#39;t do the optical scaling;
    that was probably Henry Schneiker. He was able to tell me that it was based on
    stroking and filling, rather than interpolation. <BR> <BR>I can come to some tentative
    conclusions, then. I think the characters were drawn in PostScript code by defining
    a path &#40;moveto lineto curveto&#41;, then doing a gsave fill grestore stroke
    sequence. My strong guess is that the outlines were drawn at the largest optical
    scaling size &#40;i.e. thinnest, most delicate features&#41;, then positive gain
    added for smaller sizes. Of course, in the Benton matrix engraver, you have a
    combination of positive and negative gain &#40;erosion&#41;. It&#39;s possible,
    but rather difficult, to do erosion in PostScript code. <BR> <BR>Because I am
    a curious sort, I hacked up some Type3 fonts to apply gain in this way to existing
    &#40;Type1&#41; fonts. The optical scaling results are pretty good, but I don&#39;t
    think the technique would work very well in production. Most importantly, optical
    scaling has profound effects on the metrics, and the Type3 approach has no way
    to communicate the adjustments to metrics to the layout application. Type3 fonts
    are notorious for flakiness and other problems; I&#39;m not even going to post
    my file because it renders differently on the different PostScript interpreters
    I have available. <BR> <BR>Applying the ATF Bodoni scaling parameters to modern
    fonts yielded mixed results. The effects of optical scaling looked a bit heavy-handed
    to my eyes, especially in the 6pt size range. Some fonts looked great &#40;most
    especially, my draft of the Centaur caps&#41;, while othersl, especially Helvetica,
    looked low-fi. The &#39;e&#39; in Helvetica doesn&#39;t optically scale well using
    this technique, because it tends to close the aperture even more. I find it quite
    plausble that the fonts in the ATF catalog were explicitly designed to scale nicely
    using the Benton techniques. <BR> <BR>In any case, my curiosity about the Kingsley/ATF
    software is now satisfied. I think I have a pretty good idea how to take these
    basic ideas and do them right, especially so they&#39;ll work well with modern
    software and processes. Even if the Kingsley software produced stunningly beautiful
    results &#40;for which I have not yet seen any evidence&#41;, it is obviously
    not capable of grinding out OpenType&#39;s with optical scaling features, so that
    the Right Thing just happens in InDesign.

  body: 'Hrant: yeah, I saw your earlier post on that, but I think you might be overcounting.
    In particular, I don&#39;t believe that variations in extender length should count.
    In the case of the ATF Bodonis, the descenders do get shorter as the font scales
    down, but I think that it&#39;s mostly done by adjustments in the pantograph,
    not by multiple pattern plates. For pqj, I think they just translated up the pattern
    plate while cutting the descender, and for gy I think they did nonuniform scaling.
    <BR> <BR>Ha! Now I can make a point actually relevant to the thread. If what Jens
    told me is true about Kingsley/ATF optical scaling being based on adding a stroke
    rather than interpolation or any other Metafont-like manipulation of the coordinates,
    then it almost certainly lacked the ability to do scaling adjustments like pq
    in ATF Bodoni. <BR> <BR>In any case, my analysis &#40;from the same source as
    yours&#41; yields four ranges: 6-9, 10-12, 14-24, and 30-72. The most obvious
    &#34;tell&#34; is the comma; the 14-24 design in particular is quite distinct.
    Other more subtle tells are the left serif of the u &#40;angle varies&#41; and
    the top curve of the f. For the smallest sizes, the clearest tell is the top bit
    of the t; it extends farther above the crossbar, which is the opposite of what
    you&#39;d expect from simply raising the x-height. <BR> <BR>I haven&#39;t fully
    figured out what&#39;s going on the 6 and 8pt sizes yet, except to note that the
    8 looks considerably lighter than the 6 or the 9 &#40;arguably a failure of optical
    scaling; it&#39;s very hard to find an example of this kind of lack of consistency
    anywhere in the ATF books&#41;, and that the 6pt has really short extenders. <BR>
    <BR>I found some curious defects, too. Check out the nick in the e at 11:30 in
    the 48pt size, the too-small 36pt o, and the broken Q tail at 42 and 72. I found
    some other subtle curve problems as well. Are these flaws typical for Monotype
    faces? They would not be for ATF.'

    extender variance should indeed not be counted &#40;although things like the &#34;f&#34;

    in the case of the &#34;f&#34;&#41;. But in terms of understanding optical scaling,
    for one thing by working around practical/physical constraints that are no longer
    relevant&#41; what&#39;s going on in every part of the letterforms is important.
    <BR> <BR>&#62; it&#39;s very hard to find an example of this kind of <BR>&#62;
    lack of consistency anywhere in the ATF books <BR> <BR>Interestingly, my waterfall
    of ATF Garamond from 6 to 48 reveals that the 7 is off in color. Not sure where
    that was coming from though, especially since there&#39;s no 7 in the 1923 specimen
    book. Also, the 14 that I had access to seemed to be a text 14, not a display
    14, the latter being what&#39;s in the 1923 book&#42;. This might be due to ATF
    simply changing their mind about where the text/display cutoff should be some
    time after casting the original version; and Garamond being so small on the body,
    making the 14 a text might make sense. <BR> <BR>&#42; Thanks to Kent for pointing
    this out. <BR> <BR>Defects: well, Monotype was running a business, where quality
    is never the ultimate goal, it&#39;s a means; the process has to be cost-effective,
    first and foremost. And ATF were indeed better... although with their invention
    of the pantograph they certainly gave the best excuse to designers to start dumping
    optical scaling!  :-/ <BR> <BR>&#62; the 6pt has really short extenders. <BR>
    <BR>This is also the case with ATF Garamond. I think it&#39;s because at really
    small sizes you&#39;re more likely to set all-caps, and doing so gives more room
    to the caps. The other factor &#40;something else that Kent has pointed out here,
    more than once&#41; is that the vertical proportions were integral: the absolute
    sizes above and below the baseline were based on typographic points, and 1/2 points
    were avoided&#42;; so at Monotype as well the descenders might have been 2 points
    for the 8 but only 1 for the 6: <BR><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/ATF_line.gif"

    type would be most likely used for notes and other secondary material. Since this
    tended to space-sensitive, with as much text as possible crammed into as little
    space as possible, extenders would be made short in order to minimise necessary
    leading. <BR> <BR>As a related aside, when I began researching traditional Byzantine
    cursive ligatures for Greek, I discovered that the smaller sizes of Granjon&#39;s
    Greek fonts contained more ligatures than the larger sizes. My guess is that this
    too was a space saving technique, since ligated text is more compact than unligated.
    The smaller the type, the more likely that the typesetter would be trying to cram
    as much text as possible into a small area or small number of pages, so type makers
    would facilitate this in various ways.

    <BR> <BR>But the point is that the <i>descenders</i> are disproportionately short.
    <BR> <BR>Six point type would indeed be used mostly for notes, etc. in a <i>book</i>,
    but in a newspaper or advertisement all-caps &#40;like the small legalese that
    mentions that the 0% commission only applies if your mother is from another planet&#41;
    benefits a lot from a shorter descender depth. <BR> <BR>BTW, not really &#34;leading&#34;
    &#40;since type that&#39;s larger on the body generally needs <i>more</i> leading&#41;,
    but maybe &#34;line height&#34;. <BR> <BR>&#62; The smaller the type, the more
    likely that the typesetter <BR>&#62; would be trying to cram as much text as possible
    <BR> <BR>Certainly true, but that seems to be overplaying economy: there&#39;s
    also the issue of apparent size &#40;legibility&#41;, since smaller type &#40;I
    mean below like 9 point&#41; needs to be larger on the body. I think this is a
    better way to look at it, since type with a smaller x-height actually sets in
    less space! <BR> <BR>hhp'

    this is a telling attribute to the power of print over that of digital media?&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>They never did get to the optimization feature as far as I know. I did
    talk to the Adobe type manager when it first came out and all he would say was
    he had problems loading it. So did I. It never seemed to have actually worked
    for anyone that I know. <BR> <BR>Gotta say though, as I recall, the manual had
    some good introductory info in it. Must have been a day of lunacy when I tossed
    it. Maybe I was thinking better things were coming down along the old type road.

  body: 'Hey all <BR> <BR>This is my first post here - and possibly my only post,
    given the tenor of some of the comments I have been reading tonight - but as I
    think I am probably unique on this list in that I own both a Benton Engraving
    Machine AND the Optical Scaling module for ATF Type Designer, I thought I might
    weigh in with a snippet of clarification and a couple of other comments. <BR>
    <BR>1. ATF released the OpScale module integrated into Release 1.5 of their software.
    I have a feeling this was not a general release, and I further believe that any
    potential plans for its release were shelved when the company began to flounder
    so spectacularly. I have tried unsuccessfully to make use of it several times,
    but - as Henry Schneiker pointed out to me when I bought him a meal here in about
    1993 - the information the module expects is directly related to ATF&#39;s original
    cutting slips. These slips are slippery beasts; I have never seen one, and I suspect
    most of them went into the many and copious bins apparently lined up outside ATF
    on the day of the infamous auction. Henry further pointed out that these cutting
    slips were in no way standardised, and that interpreting them required a personal
    and particular familiarity with the typeface being cut, the slips used to record
    that typefaces&#39;s cutting schedule, and the actual machine itself used to cut
    the matrices or punches. That is, one workman&#39;s notes were another workman&#39;s
    nonsense. <BR> <BR>I recall Henry mentioning cutter/follower sizes and ratios,
    sliding scales, expansions and contractions, etc; all the things you&#39;d expect
    if you are familiar with the processes involved. I also recall him saying that
    without the cutting slips the OpScale module was essentially useless, that it
    was designed to allow ATF&#39;s staff to enter existing information when digitising
    their extant designs rather than develop tables for new faces. And that has been
    my experience. <BR> <BR>I am unfortunately completely unqualified to comment on
    the underlying mathematics, although Henry described it minute detail. He also
    showed me some tricky &#40;read: baffling&#41; semi-interactive postscript where
    a character outline was modified disproportionately depending on some variables
    I didn&#39;t fully grasp. I remember wondering if it was similar to the way Metafont
    did its magic, but didn&#39;t get a chance to ask. <BR> <BR>2. Someone said: &#39;the
    6pt has really short extenders&#39;... <BR> <BR>I believe that this was done for
    purely practical reasons, and without any consideration at all for the intended
    use of the type. This extreme shortening of extenders, which is generally to be
    seen most prominently below about 8-point, is required to maximise x-height. This
    is supported further by the fact that usually it is the descenders which suffer
    the most, an explicit acknowledgement of and concession to the dominant role played
    by the upper half of a character image in maintaining readability. It is entirely
    feasible &#40;and has been done, see Cancellaresca Bastarda for one example&#41;
    to cast a size of type on a larger body as standard release. &#40;And I don&#39;t
    mean, &#39;6-point on a 7-point body&#39;; that&#39;s a typographer&#39;s specification
    rather than a founder&#39;s.&#41; But when foundries sell 6-point type, they&#39;re
    selling 6-point type, not 7-point, so they make the design fit a 6-point body;
    and they sacrifice the least important part, the descenders. I think that considerations
    of use, such as solid setting for subsidiary matter, are of consequential rather
    than primary significance. <BR> <BR>3. Regarding &#39;discolouration&#39; in size-series.
    <BR> <BR>It&#39;s pertinent to remember that foundries occasionally released versions
    and sizes of types without regard to the tonal contiguity of their neighbours.
    These apparent discontiguities were simply the result of variants which had been
    cut for a specific reason and were thus out of the normal series or progression,
    but which were sometimes shown in the specimens regardless. I had a conversation
    with David Saunders of Monotype a decade ago and brought up this very issue, and
    that was his response. <BR> <BR>4. &#39;Most probably to make mixing different
    sizes/fonts on the same line a lot easier.&#39; <BR> <BR>This is never easy, ever.
    You should try it on your adana! <BR> <BR>5. And lastly, it&#39;s plain silly
    to say that Monotype&#39;s drawing or production quality was inferior to ATF&#39;s;
    you could argue the toss either way and no-one would win. And to blame this imagined
    inferiority on the fact that Monotype was running a business...no, sorry, that&#39;s
    right, ATF was a charity; I&#39;d forgotten. Both companies produced solid designs
    and superb types. You can&#39;t take seriously any criticism of &#39;types&#39;
    based on their printed images alone; or not these kinds of criticisms, anyway.
    &#34;And ATF were indeed better...&#34; Uh-huh. <BR> <BR>All the best. <BR> <BR>Nick
    <BR> <BR>ps. I have chosen &#39;mr_benton&#39; for my username, but after reading
    through some of the forums, it really seems that Mr Giampa is the real mr_benton,
    and that I am merely a pale imposter. If you get around to reading this, Mr Giampa,
    I would appreciate it very much if you would contact me off-list at your convenience.
    I feel we may have a few things to discuss. Or, rather, that I desperately desire
    someone to talk BEM with. Thanks'

    <BR> <BR>Reading your most revealing post, one thing I realize is that tracking
    down the cutting slips is probably a waste of time. Reverse-engineering from the
    actual fonts seems better. <BR> <BR>But let me ask: <BR>What are the chances we

    Monotype&#39;s drawing or production quality was inferior to ATF&#39;s <BR> <BR>Just
    last night I was setting and printing ATF and Monotype cuts of Baskerville. The
    difference in quality &#40;of the alloy, the face depth, and certainly the fitting&#42;&#41;
    is staggering. Sorry. The one aspect where the Monotype is better however is that
    it has trapping - which I think is telling, considering the [probable] greater
    reliance on the pantograph at ATF. <BR> <BR>&#42; For example, the Monotype&#39;s
    &#34;j&#34; has an elephantine left sidebearing, predictably. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: Nick, <BR> <BR>   Thanks very, very much for your comments, which add much
    light to the questions I&#39;m struggling with. I certainly hope this is not your
    last post. <BR> <BR>   I&#39;m definitely not trying to make a blanket statement
    about the relative quality of ATF and Monotype fonts; while the particular data
    points I&#39;ve seen seem to favor ATF, I&#39;m sure the real story is a lot more
    complicated. Of course, since my main sources are the printed specimen books,
    there are a great many variables other than the quality of the type itself. Indeed,
    I believe that the 1912 and 1923 ATF books are notable largely for the insane
    attention to detail in printing quality. It&#39;s rare to find an instance of
    an objective technical flaw such as a broken hairline, misaligned baseline, etc.
    <BR> <BR>   I have, by looking at these printed samples, inferred quite a bit
    about the optical scaling &#34;algorithms&#34; used by ATF. I am excited about
    the possibility of adapting these algorithms to the digital world. One of the
    things I&#39;d like to do soon is write up my findings so far, especially so that
    people who know more about metal type will be able to tell me what I&#39;m missing.
    I would be honored to have you look over a draft of this paper, if you&#39;re
    so willing.
