  body: The second cover is better. <BR> <BR>The authors name looks better in upper
    and lower case, and &#34;slaves&#34; looks better as the bold sans.  I do like
    the tighter leading on the first cover though. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s a very good start.  And
    with a picture like that, I&#39;d say you&#39;d want to deemphasise the text and
    use as little of it as possible.

  body: Miu, you need some dynamics, try this make the photo a negative image, or
    posterize it. The Image is dull and tell nothing of the story. If you have access
    to more photos I&#39;d make a montage, the operative word of the title is Slaves.
    I&#39;d also not justify the authors&#39; name and credit. By not justifying it
    could create some more tension visually. You might also play with making the title
    of the book the focal point and make the weak photo small. If you can play with
    21st Century Slaves as it reads faster and is more dynamic. Just some thoughts,
    Dan

  body: See, I think the image is great like it is.  I think degrading it would degrade
    the message.  I mean, two kids who look uncertain about what&#39;s going to happen
    to them...and they even have sales tags around their necks. <BR> <BR>Should photoshop
    500 yuan on the little one and 1000 on the big one.

  body: i find myself agree with Chris more, i thought the image is rather effective
    and the fact that it&#39;s a black and white photo also adds a somber dimension
    to the whole subject of slavery.  <BR>I had been wanting to add bar code&#40;21st
    century invention&#41; to the tags but it could be too distracting. mmm...hand
    written number might work though. let me try it. <BR>I do like the bold sans SLAVES
    more cuz it looks more graphic than the serif SLAVES. Maybe i should increase
    the credit to make it more legible? <BR>Thanks both for commenting! =&#41;

    with tags on them at Airports with their names on them so they can be Idenified
    by a person picking them up. I don&#39;t feel the image is strong enough. Now
    put them in a field or sweatshop and malnutritioned and you have a compelling
    image. Dan

  body: i got my solution! or did i??  <BR>I am printing one copy to red transparency
    paper and another to regular cover stock and then stack&#40;off a bit for blurred
    effect&#41; them together. This way, i can spice up the photo with a prominent
    color, and at the same time, do away with messing with the photo. &#40;i want
    to keep the integrity of the photo =P&#41; <BR>never tried printing to transparencies,
    gonna get messy, maybe just give the cover a red tint is easier..mmm..

  body: The transparency is the best idea yet. Got me thinking of overprinting SLAVES
    &#40;condensed sans&#41; in red, the full width of the bottom, ultra tight spacing
    bleeding off the page in 3 directions. 21st Century mixed case and small, flush
    to the top-left of SLAVES &#40;or possibly over the top left of it&#41; in white
    or grey. <BR> <BR>To do the overprint you may need to lighten the image &#40;only
    behind the letters&#41; since it is dark. Or, create two identical layers of red
    type in photoshop, one set to 50% opacity, the other to 100% multiply. <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t
    put anything on the tags or do any photoshop filter trickery, IMHO. <BR> <BR>Randy

  body: I agree with Randy that no photoshop trickery should be involved. To me, having
    the authors name on the top of the image makes this layout less effective. My
    eyes kind of jump inbetween the type- missing the image. Especially since their
    orientation creates a diagonal line.  <BR> <BR>Drew

  body: What varnishing the word slaves across it? I mean, instead of having it in
    red? This image is very powerful. If they stack this book face forward, the image
    alone will attract viewers.

    in this case?

- author:
    name: Dan Weaver
  body: Tiffany, Miu, there is a technique that is very popular here. You liquid laminate
    the cover with the type under the laminate then you print the rest of the book
    cover with a matte ink over the laminate. The type explodes from the page, at
    least 10 fold over varnishing.

  body: 'there are two types of varnish: <BR>1. gloss <BR>2. matte/dull <BR> <BR>varnishes
    can be run as a flat panel or halftone. they are handeled the same as inks and
    require their own plate on the press. varnishes do work better on coated stocks.
    they are also a must when running matte inks, to reduce scuffing. and  - they  do
    tend to yellow with time '

    &#40;or whatever font that is, which i&#39;d never use...&#41;  doesn&#39;t look

    if there were no typography, i&#39;d be attracted to it and pick it off the shelf.  the

  body: There is also a UV coat ... can&#39;t remember &#40;this early Monday morning&#41;
    which protects &#40;better?&#41; from finger prints. I&#39;m pretty sure it is
    UV. In which case you could do a flood UV &#40;it is an art book, right?&#41;
    and a spot high gloss varnish.  <BR> <BR>One book I have in mind, and the reason
    I suggest &#34;hiding&#34; the type, is Herb Ritt&#39;s <i>Africa</i> .. incredibly
    elegant, understated, refined. The meat of the type is on the spine. Where the
    type really belongs anyway. Well, in my opinion anyway. If it is a high-impact
    photo, such as the one you have here, the type will  not be necessarily the thing
    that draws them in. It is the story which the photo is telling. Personally, I
    think that if the book is lucky enough to be face forward &#40;or up&#41; in the
    history or art section, or new books piles&#41; you won&#39;t need the type. And,
    when the book is relegated to the shelf, spine out, that is when the type needs
    to do its job. If you can, I wouldn&#39;t make the type near so big, or find a
    way to make it invade less of the image. And that is why I suggested varnishing.  <BR>

    see is actually the back cover, you have to click forward once to see the cover.
    And while I&#39;m at this self-addendum, I&#39;ll also say the image crop isn&#39;t
    the best either. But, you can&#39;t fault the model, not one bit.  <BR> <BR>;^&#41;

    in a US concentration camp &#40;on US soil&#41; during a war &#40;although I forget
    if it was WWII, the Korean War, or Vietnam&#41;. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t care if
    it was a school project, I think re-using a picture like this in this way is disgusting.
