body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nI was wondering if there are any resources available for
  CorelDraw users trying to learn Adobe Illustrator. Google has proven fruitless,
  as it just returns a list of debates about the merits of both pieces of software.
  I don't care which one is better - I use Draw and want to learn Illustrator too
  in case I need to use it in the future.\r\n\r\nIdeally, I'd like to find a chart
  along the lines of \"INSTEAD OF THIS -> DO THIS\". Quick and simple.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    mapped to the equivalent commands would be helpful too, but I may be asking to
    much :-)\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: Lex, why would you want to? CorelDraw has a single tool which can add or delete,
    align, scale and/or rotate nodes, plus define line segments as line or curve and
    connections as smooth, sharp or symmetrical...

    the rivalry between CD and IL users made no one considerer there are people who
    want to know both.\r\n\r\nDid you try to get an advice at Adobe forums?"

  body: "Nick - That's the kind of comment I keep finding on the 'net! :-) I love
    CorelDraw too - I've been using it for half my life - but I'd like to have some
    familiarity with Illustrator too. Plus, every time I want to use advanced OpenType
    features, I have to start up Illy, export the text, then import it back into Corel.\r\n\r\nIgor
    - Thanks for the suggestion. I guess I should have posted there after I couldn't
    find anything :-)\r\n\r\n - Lex"
