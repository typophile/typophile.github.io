body: "I have come upon 2 complete cabinets from Hamilton Mfg. co. Completely full
  of many different types and sizes of what appears to be steel lettering. Also have
  around 60- 70 picture plates from the late 1800\u2019s to the 1960\u2019s. Some
  with the articals to go with them. Also have printing letter box, and many extras
  to go with it. Including spare parts and several manuals and books for an intertype
  press. All were used in a small town newspaper. Newspaper is aprox. 130 years and
  still going. I am looking for a VERY knowlegable person to figure out what I have!!!"

    the pic. plates taken yet, maybe today. Pics dont do justice but the best I could
    do at the time. '
