  from another thread. You never know, we may end up with cool matching jackets. Like
  a bad-ass gang, only with fonts instead of ghetto-weapons (mine is \u201Clength
  of chain.\u201D)\r\n\r\nSo far, someone has mentioned \u201Cletter sweater.\u201D\r\n\r\nFollowing
  that logic, I would opt for <a href=\"http://www.jacketsinside.com/varsity-jackets-for-men/red-white-classic-varsity-jacket-for-men.html\">varsity
  jackets</a> (we can deal with embroidery later).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Typophile_jacket_5968.jpg]\r\n<em>Figure
  1</em>: A potential (unembroidered) red and white Typophile varsity jacket.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd
  I\u2019m not joking. Kickstarter could <strong>easily</strong> help produce an initial
  run."

    a jacket. I was more interested in generating different ideas for merchandise,
    not jacket logo design per-s\xE9. We could debate logo design \u2019till the cows
    come home, and still be stuck on jacket. Kind of like putting the horse before
    the cart, or as I do, pick a font before I write the paper.\r\n\r\nHow about a
    paper-weight for those of us who still like paper? My grandfather left me a really
    nice gold one.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t need another coffee mug. \r\n\r\nAn apron like
    the kind letterpress printers wear would be pretty sweet.\r\n\r\nAny other ideas?\r\n\r\n(and
    best to use my last name too when there is more than one Chris in the thread ;)"

    a human anyway. \r\n\r\nI would also be interested in other ideas for typeface

    Even if we could Kickstarter the initial run, we\u2019d still have to buy them.
    I don\u2019t think I can afford a $300 jacket right now, but I\u2019ll keep looking.\r\n\r\nA
    small stool would be handy. I agree with scarf and kitchen. A cookbook where we
    all pick our favourite recipe (that you are capable of preparing) and design the

    others to use their fonts for this purpose.\r\n\r\nUtilitarian, something we all
