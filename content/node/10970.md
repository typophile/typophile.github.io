  been working on a logo for a product and I can&#39;t finish it :/ <BR> <BR>The product&#39;s
  name is &#34;panagora&#34; it&#39;s from the greek words &#34;Pan&#34; and &#34;Agora&#34;
  witch translates something like &#34;All-Marketplace&#34;. The product is a web
  based application for smaller companies that want to make their products available
  online. <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t offer money, however credits, it would be greatly appricieated.
  <BR> <BR>Thanks! <BR>Fredrik '
