    body: "Thanks Tim!\r\nHere's the link to <a href=\"http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=301332\">10.4</a>
      in case anyone needs it.\r\n\r\nIt seems like I can remove all fonts except
      Geneva.dfont, Keyboard.dfont, LastResort.dfont, Monaco.dfont and Lucida Grande.dfont.\r\n\r\nHere's
      some additional information that I found about this:\r\n\r\nAdditionally, five
      fonts are installed in System/Library/Fonts that you may want to replace with
      your PostScript version of the fonts. Service bureaus might want to replace
      fonts with a customer\u2019s version on a per-job basis using a font manager.
      These fonts are Courier.dfont, Times.dfont, Symbol.dfont, Zapf Dingbats.dfont
      and Helvetica.dfont.\r\n\r\nWhile Helvetica is not an essential system font,
      some applications still require an active version of Helvetica in order to operate
      correctly. If you regularly use any applications that require Helvetica: As
      soon as you remove Helvetica from your system font folders, be sure to activate
      a version of Helvetica using your font manager (Suitcase or Font Reserve). It
      doesn\u2019t matter which font format you use (PostScript, OpenType, TrueType,
      etc), but for professional creative, print and publishing environments, we recommend
      using a PostScript version of Helvetica.\r\n\r\nOystein\r\n"
