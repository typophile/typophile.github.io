  <BR> <BR>I love all the transitions...very smooth. <BR> <BR>I always liked the <a

  poster</a>. I don&#39;t think the new poster is quite as strong, but it&#39;s still
  a refreshing change from the usual batch of headshots &#43; type.

  body: I really like that, its interesting not seeing a trailer without any scenes
    from the actual movie for a change. The transitions were really nice and the rework
    on the WB logo to match the preview looked good. The coordination with the music
    is also nice. <BR> <BR>This is kind of good for inspiration for me at the moment
    as I have recently started fooling around with after effects.

    <BR>That poster was inspired by the <a href="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B000006N4U.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg"><i>Smithereens&#39;
    11</i> album cover</a>. That, in turn, was inspired by <a href="http://www.deandaviswrotethat.com/oceans11.jpg">this
    book</a>. Funny how things come full circle.

    <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/miramax/comedian.html" target="_blank">Which
    reminds me of this.</a> <BR> <BR>I thought the trailer was pretty nice, too. Motion
    graphics looks like so much fun. I wonder if it really is? I have After Effects
    and have used it a bit, but haven&#39;t done enough of it to tell.

    Too many trailers completly give away the movies... '
