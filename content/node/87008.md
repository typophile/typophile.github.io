  They let you download a font test font which is very helpful so I've been able to
  use it on layouts. \r\n\r\nMy company would have to buy it, but not sure how eager
  they will be to purchase a font which is very, very similar to Swiss, or even Helvetica
  which we already have.\r\n\r\nHave you any opinions of this font? \r\n\r\n(It would
  be used in magazine editorial - not for vast amounts of body copy, but more for
  box copy/headlines/caption text etc)\r\n\r\nthanks!"

  body: "Worth it? You have to figure out that one out on your own. Possible plus:
    more \"uniform\" than Helvetica, not so squarish, good OT handling, better text
    figures, nice a & l alternates. Possible minus: The northwestern part of the lowercase
    s looks slightly ankward, \xC6 is too wide and the \xD8 slash is too thin."
