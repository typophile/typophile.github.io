  and cannot seem to find any resource for vintage newspaper front pages, particularly
  from that period. Does anybody know if, how, and where I can find such an archive
  online?"

    the LA Times from 1881 to 1981. What's your time period?\r\n\r\nThen there's these
    guys:\r\nhttp://www.newseum.org/todaysfrontpages/archive.asp\r\nI have a contact
    there - I can forward your search to her if you like.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    New York Times: The Complete Front Pages: 1851-2008\"\r\n\r\nhttp://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=97020751\r\n\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/New-York-Times-Complete-1851-2008/dp/1579127495\r\n\r\nIn
    the discussion of the book on the radio the NPR guy (was it Robert Siegel?) wondered
    why there is a period after the paper's name on a 19th-century showing of the
    nameplate. In the NPR link above you can see some front pages. You'll see the
    period persisting until JFK's assassination in 1963, but that it disappeared by
    the Kent State shootings in 1970. Maybe it was cut off sooner than 1970, but there's
    a gap in front pages shown on the web site. (We also see color added in 1998,
    with Bill Clinton's mug telling us he did not have sex with that woman.)\r\n\r\nI
    keep wanting to drop Siegel a line and tell him the period was used in earlier
    eras much more than it is now. Look at 19th-c newspapers, both editorial and ads,
    and you'll see a multitude of periods at ends of lines where we'd never use them
    now. On many painted building signs also. But I haven't written him that note
    yet because I don't know what more to say other than \"Well, it was used a lot
    back then, more than now.\"\r\n\r\nCan anyone say anything interesting about this?
    It has always puzzled me.\r\n\r\nI bet this is a fascinating book.\r\n\r\npowers"

    I was able to do my research there. :) I'll link to the FontFeed article when
    it's up.
