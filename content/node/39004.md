  become quite fond of [[http://www.identifont.com/show?9XK|Sansa]]. While this takes
  care of the branding device, I would like to investigate some nice body fonts that
  can go along with the identity. \r\n\r\nI've been looking at Akkurat, but don't
  really believe that is available to me at this time, so I would like some recommendations
  up that same avenue (although I would like to avoid Helvetica/Akzidenz Grotesk as
  I want to instill a sense of originality - even if I'm the only one who notices
  it). Any gems out there?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nBen"

    is embarrassingly desperate. Are your sales so slow that your advertising plan
    is to reach the few hundred visitors of this website? Second, it is annoying.
    You are the Jehovah's Witness of the type world, knocking on doors with your sales
    pitch. (And I like some of your work!)\r\n\r\nIt's not just you, either. It has
    come up that Stephen Coles is employed by FontShop, and they seem to pay him to
    suggest fonts available from them on this site. If he just posted \"I work for
    FontShop. Here are some fonts we sell which you might be interested in.\" It would
    be like the nice shirt and tie which Jehovah's Witnesses wear, which allow you
    to spot them before you open the door.\r\n"

    I'm surprised they would stir up anything to begin with? You are the first to
    say so. I might not  be on target at all times, but many here have found my \"recommendations\"
    sometimes useful for other projects or just happy to discover some new faces in
    the \"ocean\". Comparing me with Jehovah\u2019s Witness is to me hilarious. When
    I was young,,, they sometimes came knocking on my door, typically early on a Sunday
    morning! I have \"scared\" them away twice showing them my hammer of Thor, saying
    something about I'm NOT Christian! ;-)\r\n\r\nAs for living on type, I'm doing
    pretty well. I still do logotypes, graphic identities, graphic design for Greenpeace,
    but mostly because I still love doing it and it's a good way of mixing both type
    and design. But I'm almost independent from just royalties and custom typefaces.\r\n\r\nRegarding
    Stephen Coles, I find it very low to accuse him for being a salesman for FS! Yes
    he works for them and \"EVERYONE\" here knows it, but he's passionate about type
    and his knowledge is without any doubt! The Typosphere would be dull without him!
    I feel honoured to have become his friend over the years.\r\n\r\nLOVE, PEACE &

    the initial proposal I'm sticking with Akzidenz Grotesk, as I didn't realise OurType's
    EULA didn't allow outlining (I am aware this is common, silly me didn't check)
    so I have to make arrangements with my printer.\r\n\r\nI do however like the suggestion
    of using typefaces within OurType's library, I will follow that up and try to
    squeeze a bit more budget out of the client.\r\n\r\nAlthough... Flama is very
    nice indeed (thanks David, Chris). I'm still a bit new to this, so would anyone
    be able to tell me if purchasing this allows me to outline? "

    somehow turned into a flame war involving innocent bystanders.\r\n\r\nFirst of
    all, I happen to BE one of Jehovah's Witnesses.\r\n\r\nSecond, JWs, like all people,
    have differing individual levels of tact. I, for instance, never knock on a door
    before 10AM and never ring a doorbell before 11AM. If someone isn't interested
    in talking, I thank them for their time, wish them a good day, then take my leave.\r\n\r\nThird,
    Stefan H can post his fonts wherever he wants, because they are good fonts. He's
    never pushy, never puts out a giant sales pitch. Just, \"Hey, maybe such-and-such
    will be exactly what you're looking for.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, let's keep the discussion
    focused on the fonts, eh? People really start to show their ignorance when they
    start discussing religion without even a baseline understanding of the subject
    and a smidgin of tact.\r\n\r\nWe're font people, people."
