  to ID a font from just one character, but hoping someone is more talented than I

  body: This one's not hard to ID from one character. It's the classic ampersand from
    <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=LH.107918.0.3&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=%26+&sampleSize=96+">Caslon
    540 Italic</a>. Looks like they've modified it slightly by opening up the loop
