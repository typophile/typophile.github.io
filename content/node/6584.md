body: Recently I noticed that AB has snuck into my type palette. I can&#39;t seem
  to find it on my system. I&#39;ve looked for visible and invisible files. Nothing
  against this fine specimen, but I feel as if my system is in control and I don&#39;t
  like it. Ideas?

    Windows?

  body: I&#39;m on a mac. I have done a search and the copy of it which I have is
    in my fonts folder at the root not activated. I looked where you&#39;ve shown,
    John, and nothing like that resides in my folder.

  body: I think some of the Adobe fonts that they bundle with their suite are autoactivated
    by the Adobe application and may not even be available to other apps.  Maybe Mr.
    Phiney is lurking and can set me straight on it? &#40;or maybe Thomas is busy
    squeezing his sweet baybe as much as possible&#41;. :-&#41; <BR> <BR>ChrisL

    <BR>I&#39;m curious about two things. First, the initial post. Why is Arnold Bocklin
    loaded into illyCS and where is it so I can get rid of it. Second, should Brioso
    Pro be at the bottom of the menu? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/49403.jpg"

  body: i wondered about this bottom of the menu thing too and i think i was told
    it was an encoding thing. i hope &#40;for your and my sakes&#41; that someone
    comes along and does a better job explaining this phenom.

  body: Funny that AB is misspelled in your font menu, Tiff. When you did a search,
    did you search for &#39;Boecklin&#39; or &#39;Bocklin&#39;? <BR> <BR>Why would
    you ever want poor old Arnold off your menu anyway ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>I&#39;d also
    be curious [with the rest of you] why Brioso appears beneath the CJK fonts. Funkytown.

  body: In Windows, there&#39;s a way to create &#39;artificial&#39; fonts in your
    registry. Not sure if a similar thing exists on OSX or not...

  body: For Arnold Boecklin, I&#39;d do searches for shorter parts of the name, like
    &#34;Arnol&#34; and &#34;Boe&#34; in file names. &#40;Thanks to the naming conventions
    of Type 1 fonts.&#41; <BR> <BR>The correct spelling uses an o with dieresis &#40;umlaut&#41;
    not oe or plain o. So these are just different renderings of the full name. <BR>
    <BR>As for Brioso&#39;s place in font menus, that&#39;s just a bug. It may be
    partly the OS&#39;s fault, but we hope to fix it in future releases of our affected
    applications. <BR> <BR>Finally, I think Nathan is referring to a registry hack
    that allows a font which has extended langauge support to show up as several &#34;virtual&#34;
    single-byte fonts. So instead of just Brioso Pro, you could get also &#34;Brioso
    Pro &#40;CE&#41;&#34; and so on as separate fonts that would work like single-byte
    fonts in non-Unicode apps. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T

  body: These &#34;virtual fonts&#34; that Thomas mentioned make it possible for applicatios
    like QuarkXPress, that are only capable of accessing the first 256 chars in any
    font, to properly access different codepages in multilingual OpenTypes. Under
    MacOS X this would be just as vital - does anybody know a similar workaround?

  body: Yeah, that&#39;s what I was referring to, and that&#39;s also what I use it
    for. It&#39;s a pretty handy hack when you [unfortunately] need it.

  body: 'Oleg: <BR> <BR>No, there&#39;s no equivalent hack on the Mac AFAIK. Also,
    note that QXP would presumably only work with this in the &#34;Passport&#34; version;
    last I looked, the regular version of QXP suppresses all single-byte fonts that
    identify themselves as other than WinANSI/MacRoman. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T'

  body: 'Thomas, thanx for the reply. What you said of QXP was true of versions 4
    and 5, but some brains here in Russia hacked that a with an OS 9 system extension
    - I can share it if anyone needs. But QXP 6.1 under OS X seems to have no problem
    handling Cyrilic and CE fonts, at least those created by FL4.6. I will recheck
    that tomorrow - not sure if the version I used was single-language and not Passport.
    <BR> <BR>As for that Mac hack I was asking about, there definitely is something,
    the question is whether it can be put to easy use: on a MacOS X system with a
    cyrillic keyboard layout installed, the LucidaGrande font, while represented as
    a single file, shows in font menus as 2 instances: LucidaGrande and LucidaGrande
    CY simultaneously. It&#39;s not a regular OpenType though, but a datafork TruType...Keeps
    me wondering.'
