body: "My first post here, but I could use some community and insight.\r\nI've run
  into a sticky problem.\r\n\r\nI do a lot of thinking and writing about web fonts
  and web typography.\r\nMy audience is primarily people who are interested in learning
  how to use type on their website/blog, and are not type experts (even if they took
  some typography classes in college, they may be feeling rusty and in need of help).\r\n\r\nI
  find classifying fonts for non-experts is really hard. (Duh.)\r\n\r\nWhen it comes
  to serif fonts, I can show them Venetian, Old Style, Transitional, Modern, Slab.
  I can talk about how changes in materials, techniques, and social/cultural thinking
  lead to shifts in the forms of letters.\r\n\r\nGreat.\r\n\r\nThen we get to \"contemporary\"
  fonts (which is a crappy classification, because next year it's not contemporary
  anymore. grrrr. I already have to explain that Modern fonts are not Modern and Egyptian
  fonts are not from Egypt. Let's not make that mistake again, please.)\r\n\r\nMost
  fonts designed since the advent of the mac -- even the ones that are NOT display
  fonts, but legible, lively text fonts -- do NOT fall neatly into one of the above
  categories. Even Georgia, which we classify as a Transitional font is, well, quite
  different from the earlier transitional typefaces. \r\n\r\nThis is causing a problem
  (I think it can't just be me) for those of us thinking about, talking about, using
  web fonts. Why? Because there are a lot of non-type people suddenly looking for
  fonts and using type! For example, if you go to TypeKit, they categorize their serif
  fonts by \"serif\" and \"slab serif\" -- which makes it really hard to find a serif
  font because there is so much to wade through.\r\n\r\nI want to teach people they
  can use font classifications to help them \"picture\" a general \"kind\" of font
  they are looking for. (For example, if they were looking for a car, they wouldn't
  just look for a car. They'd look for a sedan, hatchback, station wagon, convertible,
  and so on.) \r\n\r\nClassification systems can help a designer narrow her search,
  give voice to what she needs, what she is looking for.\r\n\r\nBut I've done a pretty
  exhaustive search, and can not come up with another category already in use that
  means something like: mixes and matches aspects of earlier periods in font design,
  doing so in a beautiful, legible, useful new way.\r\n\r\nI considered using Elegiac
  for a while, since Bringhurst uses that as a subclass for postmodern fonts. But
  Elegiac means \"resembling an elegy; expressing sorrow or lamentation\" and I think
  most type designers are not expressing sorrow for earlier periods when designing
  their fonts/typefaces... I think they are creating new compositions, piecing together
  approaches (parts, shapes, transitions) in new and beautiful ways.\r\n\r\nSo I've
  been kicking around adding a new classification to my vocabulary.\r\n\r\nThinking
  maybe something like \"compositional serif\" or \"composed serif\" (something that
  could also be applied to sans serif if needed) but neither of these feel right.\r\n\r\nI've
  also thought of sort of cramming these fonts into \"Transitional\" since Transitional
  fonts are more about the \"idea\" of a letter, not as tied to calligraphic forms
  as Old Style and not as specifically defined as Modern fonts. But frankly, this
  just feels *wrong.* \r\n\r\nThough maybe that's because I see Transitional as a
  point between two other styles, and I should let that thinking go and instead embrace
  it as an approach to type design that is valid as a separate entity from Old Style
  and Modern?\r\n\r\nSo I'm wondering. Is anybody out there already thinking about
  this? \r\n\r\nHave you created your own language for classifying these \"don't quite
  fit the five families of type\" serif fonts... but NOT in a minute detail kind of
  way? As a type geek, I can totally wrap my mind around a classification system with
  50+ ways to subdivide serif fonts alone. But I'm looking more for a general classification.
  Something that would help a blogger or an in-house web designer think about general
  categories of kinds of fonts.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n"

    dozen keywords for their types (to help potential shoppers gravitate in their
    direction) and throw in popular terms such as \u201Cmodern\u201D indiscriminately.\r\n\r\nMore
    precise is a taxonomy that is strictly based on physical features such as:\r\n\r\nx-height\r\nstroke

    that large groupings are hopeless. So I'm\r\nwith Nick on this - break things
    down to specific formal\r\ncharacteristics and you can sink your taxonomic teeth\r\ninto
    any font. It does mean however that: you have to do\r\na lot more work; and you
    need to try to assign meanings\r\nto each characteristic - for example: narrow
    ~= elegant\r\nand wide ~= friendly.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    the Font Categories are giving me more to think about. Problem still sticky, but
    more informed. :-)

    about exactly this for the last 14 years and have researched and written about
    it extensively \u2013 in German :/\r\nI just wrote an article for a book in English
    though and have some entries on my blog. Do I find your email address via the

    classifications, plus some of my own). Then I try to fit in my fonts according
    to the category I think is appropriate. At least I get to find my desired fonts
    in a very quick fashion. As you have already read, font classification is quite
    elusive and definitely not exact; just as with music.\r\n\r\nhttp://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f217/moshdesigner/Fontclassification.png"

  body: "Laura,\r\n\r\nAs a writer with the same problem, my advice is to give up.\r\nConceptually,
    any descriptions you offer will, to the average joe or jane putting together a
    web site, last about a nanosecond, if that long.\r\nJust put together a cheat
    sheet with a sample of the basic classifications and leave it at that. Over time,
    using the cheat sheet, some differences bewtween the main classifications will
    begin to sink in.\r\nThe selection today is so large, finding just the right font
    is and will remain largely a matter of persistence and serendipity. Unless you
    want to imitate an existing design, it's mostly a matter of trial and error. Classifications
    won't help with a darned thing.\r\n\r\nMy 2 cents.\r\n\r\nRich"
