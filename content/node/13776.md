body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Terminology]] : Mid-Capitals</strong>\r\n\r\nMid-capitals
  (also called medium capitals) are a larger form of [[Small Capitals|small capitals]].\r\n<!--break-->\r\nBy
  strict definition [[Small Capitals|small capitals]] (or small caps) come to the
  top of the [[X-height|x-height]] of their [[Roman|roman]] counterparts. Designers'
  aim with mid-capitals is to make the small caps slightly larger so that the overall
  difference between the small caps and the roman, in a given setting, is more subtle
  and therefore more unified. Mid-caps then simply refers to striking a balance somewhere
  between the x-height and the [[Cap Height|cap height]].\r\n\r\nThe term mid-capitals
  could be the nitpick of purists to simply put a name on slightly enlarged small
  caps to run more cohesively in text. Some would argue that it is therefore appropriate
  (and more practical) to refer to what might technically be mid-capitals as a variant
  on small capitals.\r\n\r\nIn recent years mid-capitals are becoming more common,
  especially for types that are geared toward use at smaller sizes. Some designers
  believe that at smaller sizes a less noticeable difference between the roman and
  the small capitals is desirable.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe [[OpenType]] specification admits
  the [[Small Capitals|small caps]] feature [[http://www.typophile.com/node/33993|smcp,c2sc]]
  and a petite caps feature [[http://www.typophile.com/node/33993|pcap,c2pc]].  Fonts
  providing both often have petite caps that match the [[X-height|x-height]] while
  the [[Small Capitals|small caps]] are somewhat larger, thus filling the mid-caps
  role.\r\n\r\n<strong>See Also:</strong>\r\n[[Small Capitals]], [[SmallCaps How-To]]\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Discussion:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a
