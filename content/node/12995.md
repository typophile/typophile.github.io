  body: "I have an Underwood typewriter, but a much earlier model than the portable
    used by Kerouac. Do you know precisely what model Kerouac used? \r\n\r\nThe model
    I have is the <a href=\"http://www.typewritermuseum.org/collection/brands/index.php3?machine=underwood5&cat=kf\">No.5</a>,
    but without the tab set keys at the front shown in the Virtual Typewriter Museum
    photos."

    tour. Heard about it on MPR a while back. Apparently a dog ate the end of it.
    There is probably a photo or two that can be obtained via Google.\r\n\r\nGerald"

  body: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=18538754&size=l">Here's a
    scan</a> of Monotype's printing face based on the Underwood Typewriter design.
    You can use this for reference in choosing <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=typewriter">a
    Typewriter font</a>, many of which have been digitized. It looks like Bulletin
    Typewriter may be a good match? Or perhaps Typewriter Elite...

  body: "Bulletin is actually an old metal face cast by BB&S. Designed in large sizes
    (18pt, 24pt) in 1925. And then in 36pt in 1933. I have all the sizes in several
    cases. It was quite a nice looking typewriter face. A bit absurd to have a typewriter
    face in such large sizes but it fit a niche (display) and sold well in its time.
    It was cast as a monospaced font and required special spacing. I printed a large
    broadside \"chain letter\" in it once. Quite fun. The page form weighed 70 pounds!!!\r\n\r\nAs
    an aside, but alluding to your remark about Kerouac and tattoos, and perhaps indicative
    of our changed times: as sceptical and suspicious of authority (or the powers
    that be) as the beats and hipsters were, I suspect they would have avoided permanent
    identificational markings.\r\n\r\nGerald"
