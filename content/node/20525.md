body: I've recently been hired by two new clients that both require me to use Berkeley
  Old Style (who'd of thunk it?) so I visit itcfonts.com and lo-and-behold, there's
  <a href="http://www.itcfonts.com/Fonts/NewFonts/2006/June2006.htm">Berkeley Pro</a>
  fresh out this month! I know Tony Stan gets ripped here every now and then (mainly
  for ITC Garamond) but this looks nice if you prefer a more sedate Goudy font. Has
  anyone else tried this out?

    with the victorian crossbar on the e. I had a client once who's identity guidelines
    required Berkeley Old Style set at 85% width with -40 tracking. It was beyond
    painful to read. By contrast, the regualar setting of started to look really nice.
    They also used Avenir with 115% width. Anyway, the \"Pro\" version just looks
    like they bundled it up into opentype format. \r\n\r\nDoes Tony Stan remind anyone
    else of Iron Man? "

  body: "I would prefer Lanston's or Font Bureau's Californian to ITC Berkeley, but
    the work requires Berkeley, so that's what I'm using.\r\n\r\nI don't mind Berkeley
    so much -- to me it has an 80's vibe, makes me think of Roger Black's story on
    magazine layout in U&lc. And I use the word \"sedate\" because it's much more
    homogenized than the real Goudy font -- not nearly as unique.\r\n\r\nThis is the
    first time it's had small caps and osf, right?"

  body: "I have seen Berkeley used very successfully. \r\n\r\nI think more 'sedate'
    is accurate, and that can be good or bad depending on what you want. If you want
    something with that Goudy warmth but less assertive--with the slanted 'e'--then
    Berkeley is good. It is well drawn and sets very smoothly. \r\n\r\nBy the way,
    the slanted crossbar is not Victorian, but Renaissance--Jenson.   "
