  ancient writing systems that presently have no known translation:\r\n\r\nEtruscan\r\nMeroitic
  hieroglyphs\r\nOlmec, Zapotec and Isthmian (curiously collected under only one heading)\r\nLinear

  I'd bring it to your attention. Discuss as you like.\r\n"

    be interested in ancient scripts than the general population.\r\n\r\nAt least
    one of these undeciphered scripts, namely the Phaistos Disc symbols, has been
    included in Unicode and there are some fonts that support it. It helps that it
    has a limited inventory of signs (45). In contrast, there are ancient scripts
    that have already been deciphered but have not been properly encoded or supported
    by digital typefaces because of the sheer number of signs.\r\n"
