body: "Is there a recent version of all the attributes of the FontLab Options() class
  somewhere? The [[http://dev.fontlab.net/flpydoc/view_html.html|Unofficial FontLab/Python
  API Reference]] is still based on FL 4.x, and the attributes are not listed in the
  docstring too unfortunately.\r\n\r\nI'm especially interested in controlling the
  'Export old-style non-OpenType \"kern\" table' option.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n-Paul"

  body: "It's \"TTEWriteKernTable\".\r\n\r\nAs regards a list of available options:
    Just go to the Options/Preferences Panel and save the options. The .reg text file
    covers all available options -- they are the same for scripting.\r\n\r\nTo find
    out which is which (sometimes, names are a bit cryptic) do this:\r\n(1)\r\n--
    in the Options/Preferences Panel, save the current set of options\r\n-- switch
    on/off the option that you are looking for\r\n-- save this new set of options
    by different name\r\n-- open both text files e.g. in BBEdit and use \"compare
    front documents\"\r\nThis will show you which entry was altered.\r\n(2)\r\nIn
    a next step, set the desired option to the desired state, again save options,
    and check the .ref file for the value of this option. Or \"print\" the value of
    this option by script."
