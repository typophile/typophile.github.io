  body: "Oz and Sauna are both awesome faces!  Thanks for the tip.\r\n\r\nI cant wait
    to use one of these babies.\r\nNice and informal, unpretentious, curvacious and
    sexy.  Perfect for simple branding with some personality.\r\n\r\nHow do you think
    this type of treatment will age?  \r\nIt seems to be increasingly popular, at
    least here in Australia.\r\nI guess it depends on how well thought out the design
    is, and whether its executed nicely...\r\n\r\nthoughts?\r\n"

  body: Its true good design does last longer. However, nothing exists in a vacuum.
    I try to avoid fonts which have been overused so as to avoid the negative associations
    which a reader may form in their mind. That is, if someone is bombarded with a
    font again and again eventually that font is something they notice rather than
    the work itself. As much as i love type - i always hope the viewers of my work
    see past the font to the message.

  body: "Hah! You're right, Jonny. Lots of little details point to that actually being
    Goudy Heavyface Italic rather than Cooper Black Italic. I failed to even compare
    to your image, much less notice that Dav had already mentioned this font (a rare
    inadvertent ID?). Wake up, Mike.\r\n\r\nGlad the guys found you a gem."
