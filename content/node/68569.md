body: "Dear helpers,\r\n\r\nI am restoring an old bike that was built for my Dad (who
  raced it) by my great Uncle (who built bikes for a living) in about 1958. My plan
  is to restore the bike back to as close to 100% of its original condition as I can.
  I will therefore need to re-create the decal of my great Uncle's name. The problem
  is that I cannot figure out what font it is in. Any help to this end would be greatly
  appreciated!\r\n\r\nMichael\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LCA1_6252.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/LCA2_5187.jpg]"

  body: "That is a very good point; on closer inspection, it was hand-painted. I guess
    that would mean it wasn't created with any particular 'font', right?\r\n\r\nI
    suppose part 2 of this query then is whether it would be best to have it painted
    on by hand again, or whether it would be better to create a decal instead. Currently
    the entire frame is being chromed; it will then be re-painted. I imagine there
    are at least a few people on here who might be able to advise as to what option
    (re-paint the lettering or seal a decal under clear coat) would result in a better
    finish?\r\n\r\nThanks very much for the reply Lex!\r\n\r\nMichael"
