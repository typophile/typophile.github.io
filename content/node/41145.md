body: "I'm looking for a matte uncoated paper available in various weights with an
  old/retro feel. Not too brownish, neither sparkling white.\r\n\r\nIt will need to
  fit digital laser printing. The usage varies from brochures and flyers to office
  material. My client is a non profit organisation so it can't be expensive.\r\nA4
  and A3-sizes.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you could suggest a glossy stock to contrast the matte
  as well?\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm on the lookout for envelopes with high opacity. One should
  be able to discern a logo through it."
