body: 'I have just starting playing with FL&#39;s MM feature. &#40;FL 4.5&#41; It
  is almost working, but I am having a few problems. I am only using a single axis
  - weight - and only have two masters per glyph. So, a few quick questions: <BR>
  <BR>Is it possible to delete the outline of one master without deleting the other?
  <BR> <BR>If so, can I just paste another outline to the master? <BR> <BR>Is it possilble
  to define Startpoints on both masters? I am getting some screwy interpolated results,
  and I think it is because the startpoints on the two master outlines are in completely
  different places. When I define it for one master, it automatically  changes the
  other master. grrr. <BR> <BR>any answers would be much appreciated. <BR> <BR>kris.'

  body: You have to remember that once you have created the masters, they behave as
    a single glyph in the glyph window. Delete a Point on one, and it will be deleted
    on the other. It goes the same for start point. <BR> <BR>Hopefully you have one
    or more of the masters still existing as single fonts. <BR> <BR>Change the start
    point of the Glyph of the single font so it is harmony with one of the start points
    of the troublesome MM glyph. Use Assign Mask to place the new altered font to
    the mask layer, and they use Mask to Master to Replace the Master that is out
    of sorts. <BR> <BR>If I have increased your confusion, I apologize. <BR>FontLab
    4.6 is a little easier to use in this regard.
