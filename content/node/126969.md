    companion sans and serif versions from the same designer?\r\n\r\nThat being said,

    similar that and Conto is. See link below (BTW, does anyone know how to upload
    a image in a subsequent post? I really liked the old Typophile better. ) \r\n\r\nhttps://imgur.com/a/KLKzh\r\n"

  body: Wow! That's a blast from the past. It is indeed a custom family for Which?
    that I developed years ago. I think they stopped using it quite a while ago. I
    wasn't aware of Conto but it does bear a superficial resemblance to the sans.
