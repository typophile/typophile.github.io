body: "I working on the new 2006 Corvette apparel and accesories catalog for GM. I
  want a new face for the item names in the copy. Something sans serif and modern,
  but very readable at 10pt or so. I'm thinking of using Avenir for the descriptive
  copy for this, so something that will stand out from that.\r\n\r\nIdeas and recommendations?\r\n\r\nThanks-\r\nWalkman"

    something more aggressive and hip, like maybe Klavika,\r\nor something else from

  body: "Klavika is just the kind of thing I've been looking for. \r\n\r\nBTW- Avenir
    is just for the body copy for the item, it has to be clean and simple.\r\nThe
    set-up would look something like this:\r\n\r\nA. Classic Leather Jacket (Klavika)\r\nThis
    leather jacket is yada, yada, yada (Avenir)\r\nItem number, size, price (Avenir)\r\n\r\nAny
    other fonts in that realm anyone can recommend?"

    that would be a better match both with Klavika and the subject.\r\n\r\n* With
    some gentle straightness in the bowls.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
