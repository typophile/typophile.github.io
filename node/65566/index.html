Forcing line-breaks sometimes interferes settings for the visually impaired. But I do agree with the ~65 character/line convention employed by everyone from Tschichold–Bringhurst. I often find web type too small (and as a result, the line-length too long) so the first thing I do is increase it's size. This, for the most part, then reduces the character-count. For example, I look at typophile at this size:[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mytypesize_6589.jpg]

>This, for the most part, then reduces the character-count.

As you say "for the most part" this is what happens. That's because, typically, a web page gets laid out in pixel-sized boxes without explicit heights and without regard to font metrics and text just gets poured into it. When the text re-wraps, the bottom of the box moves upwards or downwards, depending. This can also happen at different Zoom levels, as well. 
This kind of design is made possible only because the page can scroll endlessly downward to accomodate however much text you throw into the box or boxes. An escape hatch of sorts.

Christopher, (or anybody, please), do you know of any studies about the effect of scrolling on reading? 

BTW - The effect you've described on Zoom can be mitigated greatly by sizing the containing HTML element not in pixels, but in em units. If done precisely, yes, the character count will change a bit but the number of lines can remain unchanged so the height of the "golden rectangle" remains the same.
You rarely see pages designed this way for at least two reasons:

1) Until recently, support for the em unit was uneven from browser to browser.

2) It's so much less work to just let the text flow downward.

Now that fonts can be linked to web pages, and almost all new browsers support the soft hyphen, maybe there will be a bit more attention paid to onscreen typesetting. We shall see. Certainly with static content of importance it makes some sense to take the time.

Also, as of Firefox 3.6, Firefox has followed the lead of IE8 and given web developers a JavaScript property with which to measure the Zoom level. So at least on the initial loading of the page, there does not necessarily have to be a change in character count at all - it can be rigged programmatically to be the same at every Zoom level.
However, the text actually looks better if you let it reflow a bit and settle in.
I'll be trying to talk browser makers into giving web developers an <strong>onzoom</strong> and (in IE) an <strong>ontextsizechange</strong> <em>event</em> so that user-changes to Zoom and Text Size can be detected programmatically. With those tools the issue of line length and column width at any Zoom can be solved completely and permanently. 

@hrant

>I will even change the words and/or the line measure to
>get a good rag.

Yeah, so will I. But few people bother. (I assume you're talking onscreen?)
And did you ever wonder why most printed text (in English, at least) is justified and hyphenated and almost nothing on the web is?
Doesn't have to be that way anymore. All new browsers support the soft-hyphen and the means to massage and tweak the text to avoid widows, orphans, rivers, etc... exist.

IMHO - scrolling interferes with a smooth reading experience much more than most people realize. We've just had to accept it.

(Sorry for going on about this. An area of special interest to me.)

How?

That's huge. What's your monitor's ppi?

BTW, when I try to make what I write more readable, I don't worry about iPhones and such. Frankly readability is so poor on most hand-held devices* that there's no point.

* The Motorola Droid and some HTC models are notable exceptions.

> I had no idea you were so interested in issues of legibility/readability. 

Interested, yes (for over a decade now). But I can't compete with Kevin's formal background in the field (I'm entirely self-taught, and have zero research funding). Mostly I see my potential usefulness in this area as an instigator.

And beyond. I've dreamed of a font format that defines not only outlines, but vectors perpendicular to the outlines that define the black-white gradation around the limen.

> scrolling interferes with a smooth reading experience

Indeed. That's because reading isn't smooth.

That is an awesome idea. Creating different grades of opacity using diluted ink in ink drawings is the only context I've seen the term <em>notan</em> (濃淡) before coming to Typophile, so I had been puzzled to see it applied to a normally black-and-white discipline such as type design.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">@ hrant: 150ppi, but again, my eyesight is poor so I tend to make things bigger than most (a side effect of my anticonvulsant medication sometimes give me blurry vision. A typographer with poor eyesight. How ironic). Even my supervisor who is 30 years my seniour thinks it's funny how big I like my screen type. I tend to increase the size of type as big as I can without inducing a horizontal scroll or to ~65 cpl. Whichever comes first. 

Re: forcing line-breaks and accessibility software, an old friend of mine who was seriously visually impaired used accessibility software (I do not remember the name and this was some time ago) which increased the size of the type of whatever he looked at to letters that were literally over one inch in x-height which auto-reflowed everything to fit on his screen so he didn't need to scroll horizontally. If there were forced line breaks in the text, as I once saw, they created big unnatural gaps in the text as they didn't allow for a clean re-flowing. He commented on this very fact. Years later this may  be moot.

Thanks for the tip to the [[http://phones.verizonwireless.com/motorola/droid/#/home|Droid]] and [[http://www.htcpda.co.uk/product_category_page.htm|HTC devices]]. New to me. Do you recommend any one in particular (referably something bullet-proof)? I have a soft-spot for small screen devices.

That makes sense for Japanese - just as it does for Chinese. But there is no standardized stroke order for the Latin alphabet.

I suppose that, just as stroke order is made visible in the more cursive styles of Chinese character writing, one could derive a stroke order for the Latin alphabet from handwriting.</div>

There is no one standard. But sadly some people do have their cherished one they wield like a battle axe; and actually something like Italian chancery is pretty strict. But most of all, take the case of that Leapfrog device: when I use it with my son, half the time it buzzes at me because my fine-looking "E" wasn't made in exactly the right stroke-order. This is bad for our kids, hence all of society.

I've told this story before, but my Japanese and Chinese friends laugh when they see me write Chinese characters, because the order of the strokes is all wrong. Koreans of my generation generally have varying reading knowledge of basic Chinese characters, and unless we study Chinese or Japanese as a foreign language we have very few occasions ever to write in Chinese characters.

Interestingly, there are differences between the Chinese and Japanese norms in the stroke order for some characters. The Japanese order tends to follow character etymology while the Chinese order tends to follow the geometry of the character construction with less regard for the original etymology, if I recall correctly.

It would be great to have an international survey of stroke orders so we can see the variety in which pupils in different countries are taught to write the same letters..</div>

In some scripts the ordering might actually contain information
that helps reinforce meaning - but in Latin it's just fascist.

> It would be great to have an international survey of stroke orders

Yes, but even more interesting would be
to study how people violate the norms.

Yes, a survey of how people <em>actually</em> write letters in different places would be illuminating. I didn't mean to confine it to the way they are taught, as I imagine stroke orders are not drilled to the same degree everywhere.

These stroke order differences, as well as differences in how the letters are split up into different strokes, result in important differences in the shapes of handwritten letters between different cultures. I would add numerals to this survey.</div>

I'm sorry, I had misunderstood you. I thought you were trying to get your son to use the right stroke order, and the Leapfrog device was the opposite.

I remember the old Palm Pilot Graffiti input method, although I didn't use it myself, so I understand why something like stroke order is used there. It is not stroke order for writing; instead, letters are entered with a gestural code, and the correspondence between the gestures and letter shapes is... a mnemonic device.

So this is cybercrud, not fascism: since handwriting recognition is not accurate enough, or requires too many CPU cycles, text is entered in a sub-writing fashion. The intent is not to promote "better" handwriting.</div>

Come to think of it, <em>I</em> do in most cases, except when it is joined to the letter before it in cursive. I'm a Korean native writer, and we have a similar horizontal-before-the-vertical habit to the Chinese. Good observation! It didn't occur to me before that drawing the crossbar first would be atypical for Latin native writers.</div>
