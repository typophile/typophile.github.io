body: "All, \r\n\r\nI am trying suss out two of the three fonts in this image. First,
  does anyone know off-hand what \"Summer\" is? Second, anyone know what \"Water Slide
  Party\" is? My first inclination on that one is something like 58 Rodeo or Hellenic
  Wide, where \"Water Slide\" has been squished, but the glyphs are a little too irregular
  to be either of the ones I initially thought. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nTIA,\r\nGabe"
