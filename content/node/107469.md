  have a cherished steckenpferd.\r\nyours-a-many is typophilia - mine is the embellishment
  of my digital music library with original release covers.\r\nrestoration via photoshop
  is the means by which i try to bring faded lp-covers back to a more mint life.\r\ndeutsche
  grammophon recording seems to be the stylistically consistent-most amongst the recording
  companies when it comes to the design of their lp-era-covers. a fact which not least
  relates to their specific use of fonts in cover-art.\r\ni am hereby trying to verify
  which fonts exactly dgg used in their covers 1950s-60s\r\n\r\nspecimen 1 shows a
  detail of lpm 18 010 a 1951 recording with a 1st post-war style cover\r\ni've come
  to think that bauer bodoni roman osf fits best to the letters whereas the numbers
  are bauer bodoni lt.\r\n\r\nspecimen 2 shows slpm 138 072 - a 1959 recording in
  the 2nd post-war style (and 1st stereo style)\r\nboth letters and numbers seem to
  be in weiss std. \"amadeus-quartett\" however appears set in weiss sb italic sw.
  main problem here is that i couldn't find a font that provides me with the alternative
  style swashes (e.g. at top-right of a; extra wide bottomstroke of q)\r\nthroughout
  all cover styles the record-id seems be set in a futura font.\r\n\r\nspecimen 3
  finally is a detail of slpm 138 114. it is from a 4th style cover and stands at
  the transition in font-use and design at the time between 1959/60.\r\nidentifying
  its fonts provides me with the most difficulties.\r\nif i set \"johannes brahms\"
  to garamond premier pro italic the differences to the actually used font don't meet
  the eye in a way to brutish. here \"amadeus-quartett\" is set in regular italic
  as well although other covers show an inconsistent use of alternative swash letters
  for initials and finitials (is that a word?\u2026)\r\nHOWEVER: i've spent a lot
  of time looking for the matching roman style font. to me it looks well like garamond.
  yet: neither garamond out there which i tried fits quite right. \r\nat this point
  i don't want to go into further details but rather ask bluntly:\r\nany ideas?"

    a photo lettering era version of Garamond that has not been digitized?\r\nDon"

    your minds on specimen 1 & 2 fonts as well!\r\n\r\non nr.3 :  i take it that don
    too believes the roman text to be a garamond yet not one of the many (at least
    to my eyes: closely) garamondesque fonts.\r\nthere are a few points i want to
    point out which might help coming closer to a solution for YOU the typophile experts.
    forgive my poor idiom - i hope you get what i mean to say\r\n1. the small letter
    a seems very distinctive - top leftward curve is rather fat, sitting on a slim
    downwards stroke,; the belly is not exactly drawing a curve but a little square
    top-left.\r\n2. the i's corpus - i may be mistaken - gives the impression to narrow
    down a bit towards the bottom AND its dot is further up than any other garamond
    i\r\n3.  the e's horizontal stroke is way in the upper half of the corpus and
    looks more like a serif that goes \"all the way\" (consider the strange dark spot
    in the right corner)\r\n4. the t's cross-beam is positioned further up than in
    any other garamond known to me; if one draws a triangle from both ends ot the
    cross-beam to the top of the vertical stroke - the top angle is much more obtuse
    than in all the other garamond small letter ts.\r\n5. the capital s might be leaning
    a bit further to the right than otherwhere and it might well be \"kneeling\" a
    bit more in the bottom curve.\r\n6. small letter p & q have an obviously shorter
    shorter vertical stroke than found elsewhere.\r\n7. capital q \"tail\" is much
    longer\r\n8. perhaps very interestingly number 7 does NOT have a serif!\r\n\r\n"

    you have a certain stempel garamond in mind?"
