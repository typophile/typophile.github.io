  same style as the popular \"Here's to the crazy ones...\"  poster. I am looking
  for pointers and design tips when it comes to making a typographic poster with many
  different fonts and typefaces. What are some basic things I should know when it
  comes to designing for print? I have designed many different things for online work
  but this will be my first venture into the world of print.\r\n\r\nAny tips or suggestions
  will be appreciated!"

  body: Technical tips related to printing process or design tips only ? If it's the
    latter, the only limit you have is the one that you impose to yourself. However
    I would say, do a poster that emphasizes the type itself, his feature, the weight,
    the contrast between each other.
