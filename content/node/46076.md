  yes, that's correct.\r\n\r\nlooking for something legible but not tricky or too
  beautiful. \r\n\r\nthinking of Proforma or Utopia but would like to check out others.\r\n\r\nalso,
  what would be a good sans serif companion for headings.\r\n\r\nTHANKS!"

  body: "I'd suggest Palatino, as that is highly legible and has a nice, clean, modern,
    'scientific' look. Helvetica makes a good sans combo, but do check your font libs,
    'cause there are alternatives.\r\n\r\nGot any tips for budding gardeners? :-)"

  body: "Freight Text would be really good for that. Lots of weights, with the small
    caps in corresponding weights and styles. 20 fonts in the family. A good value.\r\n\r\nIf
    you can fix the naming conventions. See this <strong>[[http://typophile.com/node/45930|thread.]]</Strong>\r\n\r\nCycles
    Eleven is extraordinarily readable at small point sizes, but it lacks Bold italic.
    \ And (or but) it is beautiful. The corresponding display font is Arepo.\r\n\r\nWhy
    do so many type designers insist on being so idiosyncratic?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n"
