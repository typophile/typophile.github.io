  1950's Cuba, and was wondering if anyone had any info on fonts, design, music or
  art movements popular in that region at the time? I am always amazed at how knowledgeable

  body: "Scott, are you talking about Batista's Cuba or Castro's Cuba?\r\n\r\nSome
    suggestions:\r\n\r\nFor music, Buena Vista Social Club is obvious both for the
    DVD and the CD. \r\n\r\nFor film, run, not walk, to your local quality video store
    and rent I Am Cuba. The film is Russian, not Cuban, but is a landmark in cinematography
    and shows what Cuba looked like visually just after the revolution. About a year
    ago, a film came out about how I Am Cuba was made. It is a Brazillian production,
    shown as I understand it on the Sundance Network and at festivals, but not yet
    available, to my knowledge, on DVD. \r\n\r\nNestor Almendros, a Cuban cinematographer
    who left to work with some of the great French directors and ultimately in the
    US (he won an Academy Award for Days of Heaven) wrote a book called Man with a
    Camera, in which he talks about his years in Cuba. He also made a film about Cuba
    that is available on DVD. \r\n\r\nJulian Schnabel, the New York painter, made
    a film, after his Basquiat, called Before Night Falls. While shot in Mexico, the
    recreation of post-Castro Havana rings true.  I should say that this film, about
    the persecuted writer Arenas, has been criticized by some people as right-wing/anti-Castro.
    \r\n\r\nFinally, a couple of years ago, the Museum of Modern Art in New York ran
    an exhibit called Fashion in Photography. The exhibit, for which a catalogue has
    been published that is readily available, includes a number of photographs made
    in Havana by Philip-Lorca di Corcia. One of his photographs in particular, of
    a woman and other patrons in a bar, is extraordinarily evocative of Havana. \r\n\r\nCheers"

    Cuba. It is an extremely. important film, contemporary with the period that you
    are studying, and you will learn a great deal from it about what Cuba, including
    Havana, looked like at that time.  There is even a sequence about the printing
    of revolutionary leaflets.  \r\n\r\nAnd if you aren't familiar with it, Ry Cooder's
    Buena Vista Social Club is a must. \r\n\r\nGood luck. "

  body: "Scott,\r\n\r\nDon't pass on Before Night Falls. Schnabel brings a painter's
    eye to film, and Before Night Falls has wonderful performances by Javier Bardem
    and Johnny Depp. \r\n\r\nIf you like Before Night Falls, check out Schnabel's
    Basquiat, with David Bowie playing Andy Wharol and a young Jeffrey Wright as Basquiat.
    \ Nothing to do with Cuba, but interesting in its own right.  \r\n\r\nBefore Night
    Falls is a good antidote to the politics of I Am Cuba. I Am Cuba is important
    because of its extraordinary camera work and use of film stock, especially infrared
    stock.\r\n\r\nFor your purposes, I Am Cuba is also important because it was shot
    during the time that you need to know about, and much of it shows Cuba and Havana
    as they actually were.\r\n\r\nPhilip-Lorca di Corcia's work is not confined to
    the MOMA exhibit. If you don't have access to the MOMA catalogue, check out his
    work on the web. \r\n\r\nIf you see Buena Vista Social Club, it may interest you
    to know that Ibrahim Ferrer died last August, aged 78, just after a tour of Europe.\r\n\r\nIf
    you are interested in film,it is very interesting to watch I Am Cuba and Nestor
    Almendros's Days of Heaven within a short time of one-another.\r\n\r\nCurious
    about your reactions to this stuff. "

    you'd surely get some superb insight into the country's past\r\nby visiting it
    today, and talking to & observing real, living, 3D\r\nCubans in the flesh, and
    how they see and make their visual land-\r\nscape today. Considering they still
    drive and admire the same style\r\nof cars as back then for example (correct me

    I would try Dirty Trilogy of Havana by Pedro Juan Gutierrez, even if it's contemporary
    Cuba there are some interesting references, I think.

  body: "If that is the project you are working on, what you will get from I Am Cuba
    is an accurate depiction of the architecture, dress, etc. of the time. \r\n\r\nIf
    Norbert's Havana Journal article is correct in saying that Garcia's film gives
    the middle class, and especially students, a prominent role in the revolt against
    Batista, you will find that I Am Cuba is at least partly in tune. One of the film's
    story-lines focuses on the University of Havana.\r\n\r\nGiven what the Havana
    Journal article says, I find it interesting that Almendros, in his autobiography,
    says that he returned from New York to Cuba in 1959 because he supported the revolution
    and that, at the time, the revolution had not declared itself communist. Indeed,
    he says that in 1959 Havana cinemas were showing the latest French New Wave films
    including The Cousins, The 400 Blows and Hiroshima Mon Amour. By 1961/2, Almendros
    decided that he had to leave Cuba due to the emergence of a dictatorship, censorship
    and concern for his own security.\r\n\r\nUnrelated to all this, and probably irrelevant
    to your project, there are a couple of things about I Am Cuba that are likely
    to jump out at you.\r\n\r\nThe first is the use of sophisticated, highly choreographed
    camera movements. These were achieved with very simple equipment, not complex
    cranes and fancy stabilizing devices like the Steadycam (a device that didn't
    exist, at the time, even in Hollywood). As hard as it is to believe, it is said
    that some of the movements were done by having the camera passed by hand from
    one person to another.\r\n\r\nThe second thing that you will notice, in this black
    and white film, is that there are scenes in which the shades of gray are wrong.
    This is not due, as a young film student suggested to me recently, to poor Russian
    stock. It is due to the use of infrared stock, which turns light skies dark and
    green sugarcane leaves very light."
