body: 'Hello all, <BR> <BR>I realize that logotypes can be a bit challenging since
  many are modified or even custom drawn. I was wondering, however, if you guys can
  come up with Id&#39;s on these.  <BR> <BR>Time: I have no idea what this is <BR>
  <BR>Gucci: Americana is close but not it exactly, is there something obvious I&#39;m
  missing? <BR> <BR>Le Coq Sportif: This looks like modified Franklin Gothic but I
  don&#39;t think that&#39;s it since the e and  &#39;c&#39; have horizontal lines
  at the end of the stroke whereas in FG they are slanted. Any ideas? <BR> <BR>Johnston
  &amp; Murphy-I&#39;ve come across fonts that look similar but none has the distinctive
  ampersand.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m doing this for a spoof poster where I&#39;lll need
  to modify the logos to read something different but similar as in Johnston and Murphy
  -&#62; Jason and Murrray. It&#39;s non commercial project for a student organization.
  Any help would be greatly appreciated as always.   <BR> <BR>Logos: <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/18338.jpg"

  body: I can&#39;t help you with the Time logo, but try TF Arrow for Gucci, one of
    the Grotesques &#40;Monotype or Bureau&#41; for Le Coq, and Goudy Old Style for
    J&amp;M. <BR> <BR>&#40;These are all just faces that will get you close, not the
    definitive sources of the logos in question.&#41;

  body: Time was definetly hand drawn and I would guess Gucci was too. You will have
    to fake the look. Are you good at Illustrator or Freehand? Choose a close font
    create outlines and manipulate the points. Dan
