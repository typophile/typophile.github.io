    gets paid what they are worth, mediocrity rules and the fool gets reelected. Why
    doesn't he just keep building lawn mower engines and motorcycles : )\r\n\r\nMichael"

    will he display his ignorance of the "working man" next? Visit a farmer's market
    and declare Walmart is the only place he'll shop? Perhaps he'll go to a music
    festival and give out thousands of duplicated CDs of the musicians as they're
    playing live?

  body: "<em>...he should crowdsource his own job..</em>\r\n\r\nLOL. \r\nActually,
    anyone (well, most citizens) can put their name on the ballot, but it helps to
    have a lot of money to spend on your campaign, and to represent a political party
    with a possibility of forming a government. So that severely reduces the size
    of the crowd to, well, not really a crowd at all. "
