  vehicle is \"Bauxite No2\" a steam locomotive that was built 10 years before the
  Linotype was invented.\r\n\r\nClick here to take a look at this month's video:\r\nhttp://www.metaltype.co.uk/rail/clicks/click.php?id=17\r\n\r\nThere
  were plenty of interesting articles posted onto the forum, one I'd particularly
  like to highlight is Help Restore the Oldest Newspaper Press in Britain.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.metaltype.co.uk/rail/clicks/click.php?id=12\r\n\r\nThere's
  a chance to see video of this magnificent press's last ever run, and details of
  how to donate money to help restore the press back into working condition.\r\n\r\n
  Also on the forum, a half-hour promotional film for the \"Newsday\" newspaper, Long
  Island, USA called Dateline Long Island. Made in 1964, the film is a good trip down
  memory lane, with plenty of hot metal newspaper action thrown in for good measure!\r\nhttp://www.metaltype.co.uk/rail/clicks/click.php?id=18\r\n\r\nAll
  the Best\r\n\r\nDave Hughes\r\n\r\nYork, UK\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nChandler & Price T-Shirts,
