    Customization?

  body: "<blockquote>the 'o' in this links beautifully.</blockquote>\r\nThat's why
    I suspected a customization. Overall design and outlines of Lavanderia look pretty
    close and I guess it'd be not so hard to reproduce the woodmark starting with
    it."

  body: I think there are to many differences, i.e. the 'h' and 'o' and general character
    width.

  body: Thanks Kevin. I made a mistake. I firstly thought to Mission Script but while
    browsing Lost Type, my attention was caught by another JAMES T. Edmonson's font,
    Lavanderia and I completely forgot (my) Mission ;) So now I can safely say, I
    think it is very similar to Mission Script :)
