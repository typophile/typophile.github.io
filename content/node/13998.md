  an InDesign file that the final PDF has a line where the outline of a textbox is,
  the line should not be there in the PDF. Ive attached an example, the line (box)
  around the word \"Bolands Mill\" should not be there.\r\n\r\nThanks for any help."

  body: "My guess would be because it's generating a newer (+1.3) version of pdf,
    and therefore the transparency borders show. They do not print however \u2013
    do the ones you're seeing?"

    you have smoothing turned on in Preferences. Even with a PDF X1-A. Turn off smoothing,
    it goes away. I have heard of very few instances of these lines printing\u2026\r\npeace"

  body: "Indeed Paul, they will sometimes print, especially on injects \u2013 depending
    on the source application you're printing from, so look at your proofs carefully.
    I don't think there is a \"fix\" for this as far as I know. (and that's not far)"

    an inkjet*.
