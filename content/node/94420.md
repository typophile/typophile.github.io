  for University as a research project.\r\nI fully intend however to make this a real
  thing, or product as some might call it.\r\n\r\nI'm not a coder, programmer or app
  dev. If you know someone who might be able to help in this respect, show them my
  video [below] and see what they think about putting a pennyworth in. I'm going to
  take this to Kickstarter eventually.\r\n\r\nI wish to tap into your collective knowledge
  and find the best information out there on type that is designed to be any of the
  following:\r\n\r\n> Read quickly\r\n> Be easy to read (*not the same as read quickly*)\r\n>
  Is designed to work on/optimized for computer displays\r\n> Is designed to work
  on/optimized for Smartphone/Mobile/Smaller displays\r\n> Closed Caption typefaces-
  what are they and how were they developed?\r\n> Colour and text, and how this relates
  to reading speed and ledgibilty\r\n> Type in motion\r\n\r\nI'm thinking of a new
  project and need to start addressing these key points.\r\nTo explain my concept,
  I've (a while ago) put a video together that hopefully outlines what I want to create.\r\nThat
  video is here: http://youtu.be/KuskQGKcaAs?hd=1  \r\n[it's the first section really,
  the second is more of a \"why this is needed\"]\r\n\r\nIf anyone is interested in
  creating this with me (online/digi-communication) then PM me or reply below.\r\n\r\nMrGraphics"

    efforts? \r\n\r\nRegarding choice of fonts and so forth, these are important decisions
    but I think they'd come far later in the project, after you'd successfully created
    the necessary technology."

    technically and visually in the dark ages (here in the US, anyway).\r\n\r\n -
