    but weight and /s are totally off.

    me so hopefully anybody out there can pinpoint it.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

    something strange about the shapes; they look as if they have been auto-traced\u2026"

  body: "I agree. I see a few things that I recognize but I just cannot find the font.
    Perhaps this is even handmade, based on a font. I don't know.\r\n\r\nHopefully
    somebody finds it."

  body: yeah, i can't agree about verdana. the strokes change in it, albeit not a
    great deal, whereas in this example the strokes are consistent.

  body: "I think this is a custom-made wordmark, not based on any existing typeface.
    The one who did it apparently tried to derive many forms from others. The results
    look somewhat off to me. \u2018r\u2019, for instance, is almost the same as the
    left half of \u2018n\u2019. \u2018g\u2019 and \u2018b\u2019 have virtually identical
    bowls. Also, rounded letters have no visible overshoot below the baseline. Maybe
    autotracing worsened the appearance of the logo (a look at <a href=\"http://www.engbers.de/uploads/pdf/Mediengestalter_HP_engbers.pdf\">this</a>
    PDF seems to confirm that). If you aim for a similar (but more professional) look,
    I agree that Verdana (or Tahoma) is your best bet."

  body: "Sorry for the late reply. I've been ill. The flew is chopping away on Holland.\r\n\r\nI've
    also got the feeling the basic is Verdana, but because it's not well executed
    it thought this might be a freeware font swirling the internet. The weight seems
    heavier than the Verdana Regular, the logo font is wider but the balance is off.
    The 'e' for instance seems to wide for me. \r\nBut seeing the fact that this is
    quite an old company it seems strange to me that this is a freeware font or even
    Verdana. \r\nSince the company doesn't use Verdana in any publication I skipped
    this font. But I think I should dig a bit deaper in the companies archive. Perhaps
    the've got some old file on a disc somewhere.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help!"

  body: if you're just looking to have the logo, you can likely find it in a pdf somewhere
    and just extract it in illustrator. (i feel kinda dumb saying it, as you probably
    know that already but can't hurt, right?)

  body: Hi Jodie, I've got the logo. I just want to find out the typeface since this
    is not known within the company. ;-)
