  body: That's exactly what I thought, Microspective. But I have been wrong before.
    I find it best to ask you experts.

  body: Actually, Bernhard Modern is incorrect. This is [[http://www.fonthaus.com/fonts/vintagetype/pabst_oldstyle/vt10054|Pabst
    Oldstyle Roman]] by Vintage Type and sold by FontHaus. Compare its letterforms,
    and you'll find that Pabst Oldstyle has the same antiqued letterforms as your
    posted example. This version of Pabst Oldstyle has slight differences from the
    more popular [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/lanston/ltc-pabst-oldstyle/|LTC Pabst
    Oldstyle]] by Lanston. Bernhard Modern is too refined, and the letterforms aren't
    the same shapes. (Compare the capital R.)

    figured out for myself that both the title and the text below it are the same
    font. Excellent, EXCELLENT work! Thank you SO, SO much!

  body: I'm glad I could help you out, Frans. And as both you and Kenny pointed out,
    I failed to mention that both the title and the text are the same typeface. The
    capital T is the telltale sign, and plus the lowercase g and y give it away as
    being Pabst Oldstyle Roman.
