  for a church that has seen quite a bit of change in the last few months, and wants
  to carry that through to their print identity. While the church body has been around
  for a while, in many ways they're like a new church plant. This church is part of
  the <a href=\"http://www.foursquare.org/\">foursquare denomination</a>, which is
  a more charismatic church somewhat in between a baptist church and a pentecostal
  church. I'd love to have your opinions.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo3_4234.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo2_4631.jpg]"

    but I would love to see something more done with the type. The whole thing looks
    unbalanced. \r\n\r\nMaybe reducing the size of the logo in relation to the type
    and choosing a different type. The name GENESIS looks great set in all small caps
    in a font like Dolly. I think a font that has more character would be great. I
    keep mentioning Dolly because the small caps in Dolly has a squarish shape to
    me. I think it would match the shape of your logo better.\r\n\r\nSharon"

  body: "Sharon, thanks for the comment, I'll definitely take a deeper look at balancing
    out the different elements. Also, I'm seeing that maybe the font kerning is too
    loose for the shape.\r\n\r\nalyz, Can you explain what you see in this that feels
    web 2.0? Is it the mark? I'm actually not opposed to giving off that vibe, but
    it would be interesting to know why that registered with you. When I think of
    web 2.0 I tend to think of rounded fonts, glossy shapes, and reflections."

  body: "I looked at this several times before choosing to comment on it.  Overall,
    I think that you're moving in a promising direction.  \r\n\r\nHere's what I like
    about it:\r\n- The shapes tastefully and subtly suggest foursquare.\r\n- I get
    the impression of a cross in the negative space between the shapes.  With the
    curves, the cross seems to flow around the shapes and has motion.\r\n- It looks
    better in black and white than in color (which is good, because it means your
    core design works well; you can always tweak colors later).\r\n\r\nHere's what
    needs improvement:\r\n- The smaller shapes in the upper left and lower right quadrants
    may improve by being increased in size slightly.\r\n- A second on getting \"Genesis\"
    in all same-sized small caps.\r\n- I think a more useful arrangement would be
    to center \"genesis\" (now in small caps) over \"Christian Fellowship\" and then
    horizontally (or even vertically) arrange the text with the shapes.  Right now,
    the arrangement is lumpy; I'm not perceiving a strong line that moves the eye
    through the whole work."

  body: "Hiroshige, if you've got any tips on making the logo feel more alive, I'd
    love to hear them. I definitely don't want it to come off as lifeless.\r\n\r\nnvhiadek,
    I'm so glad you saw the things you did like, those were definitely intentional
    aspects of the shape and I'm glad to see someone mention them. I will definitely
    play with the other details though and agree that at the very least the arrangement
    could use some improvement."

  body: "This feels really, really forced, but if you loosen up a little it can work.
    Also, the downward angle on the middle stroke of e just doesn\u2019t make sense
    and looks odd. Last, ditch the \u201CChristian Fellowship\u201D tagline; leaving
    it in there is going to put everything this goes on in the same class as \u201CChristian
    Babysitting\u201D and \u201CChristian Housekeeping\u201D\_logos. There\u2019s
    no reason the tagline cannot be added to individual project when appropriate,
    and in more creative ways."

  body: "The mono line weight around the squares and the mono line weight of genesis
    are so alike that the meaning of either element is lost and these two elements
    tighten up and bland. Loosen up those squares, give them their own rhythm and
    let genesis play on that. Put some life into that thing. And I too think the byline
    interferes with the other elements.  \r\n\r\nCrank up the Rolling Stones for an
    uninterrupted twenty four hours, then get back to the design...  \r\n"

  body: 'As a pastor who is used to seeing churches who have no basic understanding
    of identity and design, I have to say, it is thrilling to see the beginnings of
    a design like this one that looks smart and refined. I agree with everyone who
    has said, thus far, that it is on the right track, but needs a little bit of help.
    The main issue (as others have pointed out) is balance. The four squares look
    like they are going to flip the whole logo on its side. I agree with nvhladek
    that the negative space in the mark is nice. I disagree with James that you need
    to ditch the tagline entirely, because, in this context "Christian Fellowship"
    is how you are trying to denote that Genesis is a church. Thus, "Christian Fellowship"
    here isn''t a tagline, but rather an integral part of the name "Genesis Christian
    Fellowship." As such, I think you should lose the italics and actually rework
    it into the overall design to give it more weight than it currently has. Does
    that make sense? Nice work. I''m looking forward to seeing how it evolves... '
