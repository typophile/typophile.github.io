body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI have tried to search the forums for anything on this subject but
  could not find anything. I am designing a book in Adobe Indesign ME CS4 on mac and
  we are using Microsoft's Traditional Arabic font in Regular and bold. I am not able
  to export a PDF as I get a message saying the font cannot be embedded due to licensing
  restrictions. Does anybody know who designed this font and is it possible to buy
  a unrestricted version? I have tried calling Microsoft Corporation but with no success.
  I am able to print the file as Postscript and then open it in Preview which converts
  it to a PDF. I can then save as a PDF from here but this seems to only work with
  A4 page size. My book is square and I cannot get this method to work for my size.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance."

    restriction on embedding the fonts into a PDF. \r\n\r\nWe hear problems like this
    from time to time (with Microsoft fonts, even though embedding is set to Embeddable).
    So my suspicion is that it is a problem with Adobe Acrobat and its settings that
    prevent certain fonts from being embedded.\r\n\r\nHas anyone else experienced
    this problem with other fonts set to Preview & Print or Embeddable Embedding?\r\n\r\nAscender
    has a license to a wide variety of Microsoft fonts, but unfortunately this is
    one of the few that we cannot offer. We have tried to obtain the rights from the
    original designer/foundry without success. So there is not much further I can
    suggest to help."

  body: "Hi Billdavis,\r\n\r\nThanks for the reply - yes seems strange as I didn't
    have this problem with CS3 Indesign ME. It worked as long as you had the font
    installed on your system. I will look at the Acrobat settings. We may not use
    this font after all so that will be better than exporting the pages as jpegs and
    then importing back into Indesign to make the PDFs."
