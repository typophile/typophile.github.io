body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI have a simple question. Can lining and old style figures be
  mixed in a design? I attached images. I thought the leading between the address
  line where the address number is and the next line where \"New York\" is was a bit
  too tight with OSF, then used LF for just the address number because I wanted to
  use OSF. Can we do something like this typographically?\r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Graphically, the mixture of OSF and LF in your example looks off. It should
    be consistent, either OSF or LF.\r\n\r\nImagine if this person were talking to
    you, giving the same info that is pictured. They would begin talking in, say a
    Southern accent, telling you their name, title and \"516.\" Then all of a sudden,
    mid-sentence, they begin to speak with a heavy \"Nu Yawk\" accent. Sure, they're
    still speaking the same language, but you'd still be looking at them thinking,
    \"What the?!\""

  body: Oh, if you do go the OSF route, perhaps bumping the leading of the contact
    info a point or two may help with the legibility.

  body: Here's one I have wondered about. In a book, using osf within the text, but
    using lining figures (folio numbers) in a running head that is all capitals. Seems
    appropriate to me, but I have never seen it done.

  body: "I have combined the two for an identity I have been working on, UK addresses
    always end with a postcode which is a combination of uppercase and numerals, for
    example AB12 3CD, which really requires lining figures, while I used osf for the
    street number. In your second sample with lining figures for 516, should 11th
    also be lining?\r\nTim "

  body: "timd-\r\n\r\nThat's the thing. If I combine LF and OSF, it makes difficult
    to make decision which one to use and why, and so on... In your example of the
    postcode (AB123CD), did you try small caps for \"AB\" and \"CD,\" so that you
    can keep OSF for \"12\"?"

    information to sort the mail, so all envelopes have postcodes that are written
    or typed with uppercase as the last line. So logic rather than aesthetic ruled
    the day.\r\nTim"
