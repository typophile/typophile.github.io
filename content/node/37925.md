  which I'm greatly enjoying aside from one tiny annoyance - it's set in [[http://www.type.co.uk/index.php?p=a_to_z_listing&let=S&id=8157|Sovereign
  Light.]]\r\n\r\nI don't know whether it *is* just me, or the fact I think it's been
  set with kerning and leading that's just not \"quite right\", but it seems a strange
  choice for a novel, and one I've never seen before. I find the face itself quite
  distracting, as though it's fighting with itself to decide what to be (\"I want
  to be a display face! Oh, wait, no, too scary standing out, I'll be the weird kid
  instead.\") if you know what I mean?\r\n\r\nNo idea where I'm going with this, other
  than - thoughts? It *is* a good book, I'm just finding it hard going reading it.
  Has an interest in typography really come the point of visual aesthetics over content?\r\n\r\nI'll
  go away now.. :)\r\n\r\n"

  body: I certainly wouldn't want to read a whole book set in that. Okay for display,
    or very short text in certain advertising or brochure usage. Within the more modest
    range of good "transparent" text typefaces there is still plenty of diversity
    for variations in the tone the typographer wants to convey.

    good (it was), but because of that horrendous typeface! Thanks for saying something!

    interfering with the reader\u2019s experience of the writer\u2019s work. A quirky\u2014more
    so in the Light\u2014but not unattractive typeface, the serifs are a distraction.
    Choosing a typeface such as that for main body text makes the book about the design
    (form), as opposed to the subject (substance)."

  body: "I'm glad others feel the same here, and appreciate Steve's comment of interfering
    with reader experience.\r\n\r\nIs it because as a shameless consumer of books
    usually set in same old same old, that it's possible to just become habituated
    to what one perceives to be a \"normal\" typeface fit for purpose? (A point well
    made in the Speikerman short in regard to groceries.) And yes, what *would* you
    use if you were to write a novel? As a book designer do you have a solid set of
    guaranteed fonts you'd fall back on and run into a burning office to save?\r\n\r\nAs
    a designer - not books may I hasten to add - I do appreciate the publishers trying
    something new; and as a face per se I quite like Sovereign - I just wasn't expecting
    to see it there, mixed with another indented serif (I think Garamond) when Thomas
    switched between narration and citation.  \r\n\r\nBut maybe like any new - almost
    rebranding I suppose - exercise should be tested out on us, the great unwashed
    before being released into the wild? Does such a practise exist, or is book publishing
    centred upon fail safes and tradition or what the design team like? "

    distracting; it's just too noticeable to be a text face. I would find it extremely
    irritating to read for any length of time.\r\n\r\nI admit it's a turkey - I was
    trying to do something different when I designed it - I don't know what the hell
    I was thinking of. I quite liked it while I was working on it, but now with the
    benefit of hindsight, (and not seeing it for a while) I'm not keen at all!\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    you will not have to suffer it very often; it hardly sells any copies at all!
    So that's good!\r\n\r\nI can only apologise from the bottom of my heart and promise
    to only design good typefaces in the future. \r\n\r\nI just Googled it - the book
    also uses Geetype - any adverse comments on that?\r\n\r\nNick Cooke"

  body: "Even an appropriate text font can be hard to read if it isn't set well -
    too small, too tight, bad H&Js, too close to the gutter, even no ligatures can
    be distracting. I read a book recently that was justified with no hyphens. Some
    of the word spacing was absurdly loose.\r\n\r\nBut nothing more so than the problem
    I'm facing right now - I accidentally ordered the large print edition of a book
    recently from Amazon. The type is probably at least 16 or 18 points, looks like
    a kid's book. But it's making the book a real page-turner."
