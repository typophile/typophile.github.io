  I've been working on for a couple of weeks that displays my initials, 'cav'. It's
  for personal freelance purposes, not for a business; I've done work from <em>entertainment
  design</em> to <em>web</em> to <em>print design</em>, so I don't really have a specialty.\r\n\r\nIf
  anyone can give me some guidance I would appreciate it.\r\n\r\n~ corey"

    easy, but the one in the middle...no. Them I read the post and see that its an
    \"a\", but...\r\nTry to do a diferent lower case \"a\"...\r\n\r\nAnt\xF3nio"

    Have you tried a capital A, or maybe a two story a?\r\n\r\nTerrance"

  body: "I have not, but those are two very good suggestions.\r\n\r\nIt's interesting,
    though, when viewed by my other designer friends, they can spot the 'a' and the
    'v', but not the 'c'. Others can spot all three letters, and some others can't
    spot anything.\r\n\r\nI suppose the convention of guessing what a logo is is sort
    of self-defeating, so I'm going back to the choppin' block."

    it is supposed to say, so it's always good to get a fresh eye to look at it.\r\n\r\nPlease
    post your next revision, I'd like to see it."

    what it's worth that was the case with me too. Primarily because of an elongated
    top part of the 'c'."

    eyes have said that too, and that it's reminisce of the infinity symbol, which
    may or may not work.\r\n\r\nI'll see if I can alter the top of the 'c' and brainstorm
    some options for another 'a'."
