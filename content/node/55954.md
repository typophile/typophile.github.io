  or Californian typefaces. May be sans or serif...\r\n\r\nI've been looking at Optima,
  but I don't really like for the lack of true italic. Otherwise shapes could complement
  each other.\r\n\r\nSo I'm looking for other alternatives as well.\r\n\r\nThank you."

  body: "Sorry not to tell anything more. I thought OK I've chosen Berkeley and need
    something with the same contrast that will be mixed with it without intrusion.\r\n\r\nAnyway.
    I'm working on a magazine targeted at affluent readers. I didn't want to go with
    something usual. I've chosen Berkeley because of it's character and stroke modulation
    beauty. But I also need a different one to complement it. Either contrast or just
    sans serif with same overall contrast/colour.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps. Oh. One
    more thing. Affluent readers yes, but content will not be about fashion and accessories.
    So I immediately put all Script/Swash/Modernist (like Bodoni) fonts out.\r\n\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert

    Museo. Thanks Jos. Such an innovative font you've made. What's even more important?
    You've added \u010C\u010D\u0160\u0161\u017D\u017E with it. :)\r\n\r\nWhat do others
    think about pairing it with Museo? I used 300 and 500 weight...\r\n\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert
