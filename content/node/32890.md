    other sample?"

    body: Details Mag has been using it toward the front of the magazine in their
      "Know + Tell" section. I will snag a photo from the magazine and post it. Thanks
      for the comment, man.

    body: "It *is* very close. Thanks so much.\r\n\r\nAt lunch I am going to pick
      up a copy of Details and get an actual sample up on here. One of defining features
      of the mystery font is that horizontal crossing lines (say that cross the t)
      are fine lines-- this is not apparent on ilyt.com because that image is an illustrator
      drawing based on a tattoo. Jeff."
