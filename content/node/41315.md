  body: "Wow! (scratches head) These letters don't seem so unusual, but taken altogether
    I am having a heck of a time matching them. The features I was trying to spot
    were the geometric curve of the counters, the open-ness of the C, the legs of
    the R and K. Even if this is the condensed member of a larger family, some of
    those attributes should be in the parent font, but unless i just went letter-blind,
    I couldn't see it. The closest selections I could find at MyFonts -- which I thought
    gave me good odds of finding it -- were [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/astigmatic/mighty-tuxedo-aoe/|Mighty
    Tuxedo AOE]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/primetype/golary-red/|PTL Golary
    Red Light]] and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/elemeno/trivet/solid/|Trivet Solid]].
    None of these is an exact match, and squooshing and faux SC tricks would help,
    but still not be identical, I think.\r\n\r\nConclusions: I don't think it's sold
    at MyFonts; this proves why I love doing this -- how else could someone be so
    entertained looking for such mundane letters?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
