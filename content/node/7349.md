body: Now that InDesign 2 and Photoshop 7 support OpenType, does anybody around here
  have a clue when we can expect OpenType support in Illustrator? Couldn&#39;t find
  anything on their website. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m considering upgrading my license for
  Mrs Eaves to the OpenType version and purchasing a license to Neutraface. As I&#39;m
  doing almost all my single page work in Illustrator, this is important information
  to me.

  body: Illustrator first needs to be updated to handle Unicode text input and processing,
    once that is in place &#40;or at the same time&#41; Adobe will doubtless start
    adding OpenType Layout support. Rewriting core text handling for an application
    is a major job, which can easily take more than one typical rev cycle. I know
    Adobe won&#39;t make any public statements about this, but my guess is that they
    are actively working on updating the text engine for Illustrator. I&#39;m hoping
    that we&#39;ll see the results in the next release.

    be fully Unicode savvy &#40;I hope&#41;. New version is planned for this winter.

  body: At the risk of souding like a salesman, they way we are handling the issue
    with illustrator is that we bundle the &#34;Neutraface Standard&#34; fonts with
    the &#34;Neutraface Expert&#34; collection. So if you wanted to specify, for example,
    small cap tabular figures in NeutraText Bold in Illustrator, you&#39;d have to
    use the &#34;Standard&#34; fonts &#40;which, incidently, also ship in .otf format
    only&#41;. If you wanted to do the same in InDesign, it&#39;s as simple as invoking
    a few features with the NeutraText Expert counterpart. Both collections &#40;Standard
    and Expert&#41; will coexist peacefully in the type menu. Drawback is that you
    have a boatload of fonts added to your menu...the full Neutraface Standard collection
    is 85 fonts &#40;OpenType programming in the Expert collection trims it down to
    29&#41;. <BR> <BR>At this point, we are telling people who have no intention of
    using InDesign that they should not bother spending the extra 50 bones for the
    Expert collection at this point. We also tell them that we&#39;ll &#34;upgrade&#34;
    them to the Expert collection for the $50 difference if they change their mind
    down the road. <BR> <BR>Not having OT support in AI is a bummer, but I&#39;m sure
    Adobe will have it in subsequent versions, especially since all of their new collections
    since 1999 ship in OpenType only format.

  body: Since we&#39;re on the matter. <BR>In the US Illustrator is big, but in Europe
    FreeHand is big, too. <BR>As far as you know, are there any serious indication
    on Macromedia discontinuing FreeHand? <BR>I&#39;ve always used both programs &#40;I
    started with FreeHand 2 and Illustrator 88&#41;, and although they may seem similar,
    you can&#39;t even imagine to do with Illustrator what you do with FreeHand, and
    vice-versa. <BR> <BR>Besides, many Illustrator 10 features stinks and there are
    many bugs, while FreeHand &#40;well, FreeHand 10 stinks as well&#41; has now a
    &#34;copy special&#34; feature very useful for type designers. <BR>I used Illustrator
    to copy directly my outlines in FontStudio, but now you can do it directly from
    FreeHand 10, which supports a copy format like the one of Illustrator 8 and 9.
    <BR> <BR>Typographically FreeHand is so superior to Illustrator that I would die
    if they decide to discontinue it. I need to hurry to upgrade my home copy to version
    10.

  body: Freehand MX &#40;11&#41; was released last week, but does not support Opentype.
    It won&#39;t even do font grouping. <BR> <BR>While I love it dearly, I&#39;m glad
    I don&#39;t use it much for typographic work.  <BR> <BR>You can download a trial
    version at macromedia.com. <BR> <BR>Joe VanDerBos

  body: '&#62; [Ciao Jon, welcome! This is very stupid of Macromedia. Before InDesign,
    and even after it, FreeHand was the only program handling complex graphic design
    and excellent typographic layout capabilities at the same time. No Opentype support
    is a really stupid move. But I&#39;m just glad they haven&#39;t discontinued it
    for now. Before InDesign there was no program allowing you to force punctuation
    out of justified text, for better alignment, or to adjust so finely tracking and
    other type issues. I have been a PageMaker user since version 3 &#40;back in 1988&#41;
    and I welcomed InDesign as a fantastic step forward. But if you do things like
    packaging, where the complex handling of graphics is often paired with the need
    of great typographic control, FreeHand is invaluable.]'

  body: Argh, I&#39;ve been hoping the Macromedia folks got OpenType included with
    the MX version of Freehand. I wish they&#39;d just sell Freehand to some smaller
    comapny that doesn&#39;t view it as a kind of Flash-plug-in and started to really
    work with the potential of FH in a good way. If Adobe adds multi-pages-of-various-size-in-one-document,
    OpenType and a bit more speed to Illustrator, that&#39;ll be it for me and I&#39;ll
    switch, I do most of my work in InDesign these days anyway... &#40;oh well, at
    least the upgrade from FH 10 to 11 isn&#39;t too expensive :-&#41;&#41;

    and I must say it&#39;s excellent, apart from the Opentype lack. You work at lightspeed
    and the revamped interface is incredibly functional. The visualization is perfectly
    antialiased like in Illustrator now, no more lousy Flash-like visualization like
    FreeHand 10 offered.]'

    work, but find myself more and more switching to ID, as the typographic engine
    and the way the images etc are handled are just superb &#40;and plugs like Smart
    Style simply save LOTS of time&#41;. There&#39;s no tool even close to InDesign
    right now, and my wish list for ID is quite short indeed these days. '

  body: '&#62; [From what John Hudson has told me, InDesign ME &#40;Middle East&#41;
    is even better than the international Adobe version. It&#39;s been developed by
    a third-party software firm for offering support for indic scripts and it&#39;s
    probably the state of the art of layout programs today. I wonder if as an InDesign
    registered user I could get an upgrade. I&#39;m on a Mac, anyway. I don&#39;t
    know if InDesign ME exists for both platforms... FreeHand will always be in my
    heart, anyway. I recalled when I started using FreeHand 2.0.2 in awe. At the time,
    PageMaker 3.0 didn&#39;t allowed color separations, rotations, and it allowed
    only point size increments of 1: 11 pts or 12 pts, etc... Anyway, just as a reminder:
    FreeHand offered color separations from within the program since 1988/89 while
    for Illustrator people had to wait until release 5 or 6 if I recall correctly.
    And version 6 still didn&#39;t allowed the import of tiff files. Illustrator is
    good for Illustrations. FreeHand might go away, but it&#39;s been a landmark for
    designers and typographers as well...]'
