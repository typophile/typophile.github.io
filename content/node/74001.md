  with. I've tried identifont but had no success.\r\nNo one in the company knows who
  designed this logo, it's kinda sad - but understandable due to the look of the design
  itself and the minimal amount of exposure the logo received lol. Ugly logo eh?\r\n\r\nCurrently
  I need this font to use in a few branding product I'm working on. I could just replicate
  it in illustrator but it is probably better if I can get the actual font to work
  with.\r\n"
