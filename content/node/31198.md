    body: I agree it's hand rendered. I posted this a few weeks back but with no great
      leads. I have to recreate this.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LIG_5413.jpg]

      body: recreate the Bob's your uncle part which i'm pretty sure is a font. Notice
        the lowercase "o". The incosistencies come in with the "r"in relation to the
        "n"

  body: Hand rendered I reckon. Both the lowercase o's and i's are different. Unless
    it's a type that's been tinkered with.

  body: "This topic has been discussed at our 'cousin' group of <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/viewthread.php?threadid=45805\">WTF
    Forum</a>, over at MyFonts. They concluded that it was 'not a font' on the shirts
    (supposedly based on a statement from L.I.G. folks). However, I think the site
    that Conor linked shows that a similar styled font was generated to make the site
    captions.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt it would be proprietary, since that is a big
    part of their brand 'look'.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
