body: I was wondering if any of you have a fool proof method of making a seamless
  pattern within Illustrator? Any tips/tricks/voodoo you may pass on is greatly appreciated.
  I'm about ready to give up and start selling coffee.

    something always ends up shifting over a little after the first few rows."

  body: "I turn the grid lines on & turn on snap to grid. Make sure each seam point
    falls directly on a grid intersection. Keep an eye on the X & Y coordinates in
    the transform palette so you know it's snapping to the grid like it should (you
    should have values such as 14 or -6, not something like 14.002 or -6.175).\r\n\r\n\r\nTo
    me it's easiest to check how it will tile by duplicating your working copy, dragging
    it down and aligning it where it will tile. It sometimes takes a few times to
    get it right.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have noticed some patterns will still show tiny hairlines,
    even after I go through and inspect the seam points and everything checks out.
    They print fine though.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen adding a pattern to a shape you may find
    that you want to move the fill itself without moving the shape. Make sure nothing
    is selected, then hold down the tilde (~) key, then click on the pattern within
    the shape to move it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope this helps. I must apologize if any
    of this is difficult to follow, I didn't get much sleep last night to make a deadline
    so I'm going through the motions today. :-)"

  body: "Step 1: Define the rough pattern in a square\r\n\r\nStep 2: Make a copy of
    the square, aligning it with the first; this will show any weird overlaps (see
    red arrows)\r\n\r\nStep 3: Select any element you want to move AND it's \"clone\",
    and move it til it's in a better position. \r\n\r\nStep 4: Keep doing this until
    your \"original\" square is completely surrounded by copies. If you need to tweak
    an element, make sure all its copies are selected at the same time (so any changes
    \"update\" in all nine squares).\r\n\r\nStep 5: Select EVERYTHING that overlaps
    your original square (any object going over the \"edge\" will be repeated on an
    opposite side, and anything on a \"corner\" will be on all four corners) and copy
    it to a new area/file/whatever. I find this easier to do in outline view. Select
    it all and define a pattern (rect should be in BACK, and probably not stroked).\r\n\r\nStep
    6: test it and go!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/patterns_3964.jpg]"

    find that you want to move the fill itself without moving the shape. Make sure

    within the shape to move it.\"\r\n\r\nI was pulling out hairs trying to find out
    how to get my watercolor swatches created in Painter to stop tiling. I had resorted
    to making them huge, and I even read the manual, sort of. Finally I googled my
    question, was sent here and all my planets are lined up again. Thank you MJ! And
    I look forward to reading more on this site.\r\n\r\nRobin in Oregon"

  body: This almost slipped by me. You're welcome, although I think it was kinda luck
    this carried over to Painter. Nonetheless I'm glad it was able to help you out.
    This is a great site with many talented people, welcome aboard!

  body: Thanks again! To clarify, I created the swatches in Painter but was building
    the illustration in AI, using my watercolor fills instead of flat color. Even
    my editor is impressed with the new look and that = a very good thing.
