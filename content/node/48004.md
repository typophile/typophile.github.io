body: "Hello, I am wondering if anyone has used or is using this new Universal Type
  Server by Extensis. My creative department has been using LinoType Font ExplorerX
  for some time now and it isn't bad, but I feel we should be on a server based system
  so we can track usage and purchases and what fonts we actually own and which ones
  are download by some HACKS! hahahaha!\r\n\r\nAny feedback would be greatly appreciated.
  If anyone is in the Boston/NYC area I would love to check it out in action too!\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "Hi Mario,\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to test out Universal Type Server, it's available
    as a free fully-functional trial demo that works for 30 days from the Extensis
    website - typserver.com. \r\n\r\nIf you'd rather not install your own server,
    you might find some of our demo videos helpful in evaluating Type Server: http://blog.extensis.com/?p=1548\r\n\r\nFeel
    free to PM me with any questions.\r\n\r\nJim Kidwell"
