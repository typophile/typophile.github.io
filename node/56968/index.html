  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>i seem to remember somewhere here either hrant or sii suggesting licensing fonts via subscription, but i have no idea how to find those discussions, so here are my thoughts on the topic.</p>
<p>i have two situations where i think this could be really useful.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>i am a poor designer who wants awesome type but cannot afford to buy families outright, so i go to my foundry of choice and sign up to a monthly subscription deal not unlike what [[http://www.emusic.com| emusic]] does for music - where for a set monthly fee i can download a certain number of faces, each month my account gets topped up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i am from a community group/non-profit/church/cheapskate company and don&rsquo;t have the funds to licenses quality fonts for the number of users i actually need, so i enter into a subscription deal with the foundry where they charge me a monthly/yearly (whatever) fee to use the fonts on a larger number of computers. eg: my church might need a family of fonts to use for it&rsquo;s identity, but because of the nature of a church lots of the materials are created by volunteers on their own computers, so standard licensing would be too expensive and limiting, but a subscription fee might be workable.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>i&rsquo;m sure their are myriad other ways this could work, and problems with it, but i suspect they could be overcome.</p>

<p><cite> Perhaps a subscription model would be interesting for people who don’t really need the fonts, but want to “collect” them as it were (that’s how I read Mike’s “I plan on get the rest of Odile and starting in on National.”).</p>
<p><cite> Receive a new weight every month until the family’s complete and pay the discounted package price in monthly instalments :)</p>

		<div class="commentbody">This has come up a few time. The problems are pricing and piracy. Type designers don’t trust end-users to not pirate fonts. It’s likely that people will sign up, download the latest original versions of everything (something most pirate font collections don’t even offer), cancel the subscription, and keep the fonts. That leaves us with two options. One, make up for piracy losses by setting a very high price that nobody wants to pay. The other option is font DRM. Font DRM has a very nasty history and users hate it. Software developers hate it as much or more than users. Adobe has made it clear that it does not want to go down the DRM road again, which means that the DRM has to be part of the operating system, which is unlikely to happen and would only happen in a way that screws everyone involved.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think type designers have to become friends with graphic designers, and work together. For our long-time clients, we offer a license that gives them access to our entire library for a small yearly fee. Whenever they use our fonts in a client project they add the cost of the fonts to the bill. The client licenses the font. The designer gets a 10% discount off the price of our font license, allowing them to either pass this along to their client or take it as a commission. It works great.</p>

<p>But I never mentioned what the yearly fee was. How can you make that statement without knowing what the fee is?  Ultimately it is not about the yearly fee. It is about a partnership with certain designers, who respect our work, find it valuable, and want to use it.</p>

<p>eg, i wish to purchase fonts from vllg.com, instead of just buying font at random when i can afford it, why don&rsquo;t i pay a smaller fee, which gets altomatically billed monthly, and then i get a maybe 4 font credits, so i can download 4 faces with that months subscription. of course you can have different levels of subscription.</p>
<p>so, in that example, it&rsquo;s just a subscrption in the sense of being charge a monthly amount for buy credits.</p>
<p>@terminaldesign - i like the sound of that, and if i had that kind of relationship with a foundry it would be great. would you do something similar for a non-profit?</p>

<p>Sorry, what I meant to say was that I thought that you had brought it up and people weren’t willing to go with the price. The old thread is inaccessible due to broken search indexes so I’m going by memory and I apologize if I’ve confused things.</p>
<p>That said, you probably are right about type designers entering into such partnerships with designers they trust. But I don’t know if that can work on a large scale—there are a heck of a lot of designers out there.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>As it has been brought up, I&rsquo;ll repeat here things I&rsquo;ve previously said or written in public and online, back when I worked for Adobe&hellip;.</p>
<p>Adobe repeatedly engineered font DRM schemes and then ditched them over the last 25 years. The ones that are public knowledge are (1) the original protection scheme that locked Mac Type 1 fonts to specific output devices (discontinued in the early 90s), and then (2) the encryption and device-tying approach using PACE technology, developed for CID-keyed Type 1 fonts for the Japanese market (phased out starting around 1999-2000, though Morisawa used it for some years after IIRC).</p>
<p>The fonts locked to output devices weren&rsquo;t as hard, as I understand it (though that was before my time). But once we had fonts that lived on the end users' computer, and were accessed in applications, the engineering costs of supporting the encryption scheme throughout the workflow were immense, in the multi-millions of dollars. Customers were hardly fond of these DRM schemes either, because they got in the way of legitimate and reasonable uses of the fonts. Ultimately, Adobe decided that DRM for fonts was more trouble than it was worth. There was even a third scheme that was fully developed but never deployed&hellip;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll never say never, and of course I&rsquo;m not with Adobe today, but it seems mildly improbable that Adobe would lead the way back into font DRM today. Not that they are morally opposed, but they&rsquo;d have to be convinced that the benefits outweighed the costs&hellip; including the &ldquo;cost&rdquo; of frustrating one&rsquo;s customers.</p>
<p>Today with font handling being done primarily at the OS level, and with so many apps needing to interact with fonts (and some bypassing the OS to &ldquo;talk&rdquo; to the font directly), DRM for fonts would be much harder than it was back in the day. Perhaps somebody should go talk to the folks at LetterHead Fonts who recently experimented with font DRM for a while (<a href="http://www.typophile.com/node/30452)">http://www.typophile.com/node/30452)</a>.</p>
<p>Also, on the topics of both DRM and font rental, the folks at Morisawa in Japan could be informative. They have a long history with DRM, and they have a font rental product called &ldquo;Passport,&rdquo; which is aimed at the student market if I recall correctly.</p>
<p>Personally, in principle I think that offering a DRM-based rental scheme as an optional alternative to traditional permanent licensing is a fine idea (that is, offer the same fonts with a choice of licensing models, they can get them without the DRM the &ldquo;old way&rdquo; if they want)&hellip; it&rsquo;s just the wee technical details that get in the way. But those are some pretty big &ldquo;details.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>T</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>thanks thomas.</p>
<p>interesting.</p>
<p>i also think drm for fonts is not a good idea.</p>
<p>the more i read about the type business, the more i see parallels to the music business.</p>
<p>nowadays, since most music is available digitally, and sold digitally, the music companies are having to come up with ways to meet customers and try to reduce the affects of piracy.</p>
<p>first, itunes stopped putting drm on songs, now the companies themselves are offering high-quality mp3&rsquo;s with no drm (at least in australia where sony/bmg have <a href="http://www.bandit.fm">http://www.bandit.fm</a> ) and saying quite plainly that the mp3&rsquo;s can be used on multiple devices.</p>
<p>in all honesty, is there really that much difference between a music artist investing lots of $$$ into making an album and having it sell for $15, which will take them a long time to recoup cost without a big following, and a type designer?</p>
<p>i know lots of people will think i&rsquo;m an idiot, but what if fonts were available for roughly set prices like music?</p>
<p>i mean songs tend to cost around a dollar each if sold individually, does that represent the amount of effort and money the artist put into making it, no, but it is the standard. what if fonts had similar &lsquo;standard&rsquo; prices and could be bought like songs?</p>
<p>one of the biggest reason i don&rsquo;t buy more fonts is because of cost. and i believe lots of other people are in the same boat. if type was a cheap as music, then i think more people would pay for it, just so they can sleep at night.</p>
<p>it will not stop pirates. but if we are honest, pirates are unlikely to ever pay for fonts anyway.</p>
<p>i recently saw an assignment done by a fellow student at my university, and when i asked her what font she used, as it looked really nice, she told me, since it is a commercial, not-free font, i commented on her having it, and she had this guilty look on her face, then she said that it was too expensive to buy, so just acquired a copy of it.</p>
<p>naturally, as someone who spends lots of money (well for my salary) on type, i was saddended. i told her off, in a gentle way.</p>
<p>anyway, my point, if type was treated like music is, then i think more would be sold and the market might increase.</p>
<p>imangine if itunes had a &lsquo;fonts&rsquo; tab. that would be awesome.</p>

<p>Yes. Most font designers don’t have someone else paying the production costs. Most font designers can’t count on selling a few million pop fonts to subsidize the rest. Most font designers don’t have massive back catalogs selling a few million units a year to subsidize new work. Font designers don’t have touring and merchandise revenue. Music also has a much larger market than fonts. Between albums, mp3s, and ringtones music has a potential market of billions of consumers. The market for fonts is much, much smaller.</p>
<p>There are some people experimenting with inexpensive fonts. Jos Buivenga seems to be doing well with it, and IIRC Chank Diesel has said he does well with an array of pricing and license options. But some other designers have released inexpensive fonts that don’t sell at all. I think that end-users still need to get used to the idea that inexpensive fonts aren’t junk.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It&rsquo;s very difficult to churn out fonts on a regular basis, whatever the size of the foundry.
That alone would mitigate against offering subscriptions to new products.
I tried producing new fonts on a regular basis when I first started being distributed by Veer, but only kept it up for a couple of years, it was too demanding.
Distributors would be better able to offer subscriptions, as they do have a plentiful supply of product.</p>
<p><em>in all honesty, is there really that much difference between a music artist investing lots of $$$ into making an album and having it sell for $15, which will take them a long time to recoup cost without a big following, and a type designer? </em></p>
<p>What James P and Jackson said.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think most font purchasers are interested in fonts they don&rsquo;t have an immediate use for.
You can challenge me on this Sye, but would you really buy those expensive fonts you&rsquo;re drooling over, if they were half the price&ndash;and you didn&rsquo;t have a project to use them on?
IMO, people will license a font they&rsquo;ve noticed a while ago and kept in the back of their mind, when they need it.
James M&rsquo;s plan works with that reality.</p>
<p>However, I suspect things might be different for really popular typefaces, but I haven&rsquo;t produced one of those for a while, and that&rsquo;s not the kind of thing that can be predicted.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think there are many currents to this discussion.</p>
<p>Most designers cannot afford to invest in large libraries from many different suppliers.</p>
<p>Designers are going to use fonts which they already have, so getting a library of fonts in the hands of a designer is going to encourage them to use those fonts.  Subscriptions or other licensing arrangements (like the one I described) are going to help get fonts to the designers making decisions.</p>
<p>But I think it goes farther. Are type designers making the fonts that graphic designers want to use? Yes and no I think. I shared some thoughts on this in a previous thread on the TDC winners. I do think there is generally a disconnect between type designers and graphic designers. I have been trying to bridge that by getting my graphic designer buddies involved with the type design process. Encouraging them to act as a sort of art director during some of our development process.</p>
<p>Just a few thoughts.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@nick - for me personally, yes i do and would buy fonts i have no need for. in fact i would estimate that at least half of my type purchases were because i just liked them, and hope to find a place to use them in the future. some were bought just because they were on special. i have managed to convince my work to buy some of the larger families that i personally could not afford, thus at work i have the Neutra and Meta families.</p>
<p>but i do see your point, and i know i am in the minority. most designers just use what they know or already have. which i guess is where i see alternative forms of licensing helping.</p>
<p>@james m - i totally agree in there being a gap between what graphic designers want and what type designers create. one family i would love to get, as a graphic designer, is Gotham, i know it&rsquo;s the new helvetica and everyone is using it, but it just seems to practical and looks good almost everywhere. as a type nerd i want and buy other faces, not really to use, but just to have. i remember when i use to work for a print shop that had the LinoType Gold discs, we never even looked at buying type, there just wasn&rsquo;t a budget for it, so we just used what we had (or freebies).</p>
<p>@james p - i see you&rsquo;re point, and you&rsquo;re right to a degree, except that there are thousands of people making music who do not have big label support and all the other stuff. i guess the main point i was trying to make was that these artists invest heavily in making something that gets sold cheap. i have a buddy who make an independent album, it took him months, plus lots of money to make (recording, mastering etc) yet he has sold hardly any cd&rsquo;s (or digital downloads) at all.</p>

<p>i think i need to clarify, i think fonts are worth the prices charged. the simple fact is that lots of ones that i want i just cannot afford.</p>
<p>but i guess that&rsquo;s like cars. or anything else.</p>
<p>i do wish all foundries had a variety of ways to license their fonts, for example, H&amp;FJ do not license single weights unless there is a large quantity ordered. for a small fry like me, that stops me being able to buy their fonts.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Good topic. If you look around you can find a variety of new licensing models being explored. All with the goal of meeting the needs of customers, and allowing type designers &amp; font vendors to earn a livelihood.</p>
<p>For example, the traditional font license that includes 5 workstations by default. Some foundries, including FontBureau, offer a single workstation license, which lowers the entry fee. We&rsquo;ve done this with our [[http://www.Fontmarketplace.com|Fontmarketplace.com]] site (we offer TrueType fonts with single workstation licenses). Of course the hope is that honest users will be honest and select the number of workstations they intend to install the fonts on from the drop-down menu.</p>
<p>Another example is the &lsquo;personal use&rsquo; vs. &lsquo;commercial use&rsquo; licenses. Some type designers and foundries are offering a discount for a license that is only for personal use (to appeal to home &amp; office users much like FontMarketplace).</p>
<p>Back in 2003 when Steve Kuhlman and I worked at Agfa Monotype we applied for a patent for a &ldquo;Font Rental System&rdquo;. [[http://www.wikipatents.com/apps/20040177056.html|Wikipatents.com - Application 20040177056.]] We both left in 2004 so I don&rsquo;t know what happened to it (other than it does not appear to have been issued). From what I remember DRM was an integral component of the system. As Thomas and others have mentioned, in today&rsquo;s market that would meet a lot of resistance.</p>
<p>I think the main objective with any licensing system is to make it a win-win for all the parties. For the customer they must see the value, and it must be easy to understand and administer. For the type designer and font vendors it must protect the font software and IP.</p>
<p>Some of the comments and ideas posted above are great in that we all must continue to think about how to best serve our customers. If we are not meeting their needs (by not having the right fonts, or making it easy and cost-effective to acquire), then we&rsquo;ll have to continue to evolve and innovate, or face even tougher challenges ahead. So from that standpoint I would agree that the font &amp; music business have many similarities.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>A font management app with DRM . . .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An online or remote design application that allowed access to fonts based on the user account which could be &lsquo;subscribed to&rsquo; as well as assets to design with . . .</p>

<p>Neither of these is a stretch when you look at how technology is evolving the design market . . . But, neither is likely to be funded unless a profit is sniffed out . . .</p>

<p>i know most designers would not think of fonts as being &lsquo;rented&rsquo; but lets say i purchase a license for a really small token fee (like $15 for a cd of music) in order to see if the fonts will work for a project, then if i did use it, i submit the usage to the independant body who bill me and pass on the royalties to the relevant foundry/distributer/designer?</p>
<p>plus this body would also be responsibel for tracking down illegal use of fonts for commercial purposes. i;m assuming it would be funded by the foundrys&rsquo;distributers/designers who wish to use the service.</p>

<p>Right. But how do we know you will submit the usage? How many will ignore the usage? I don&rsquo;t know about Oz, but in the USA there is a freedom of the press that pretty much prevents the government from licensing media or forcing people to submit publications to any governing body.</p>

<p>At what point do you decide if you&rsquo;ve &ldquo;used&rdquo; a font? Is it when you download it? When you activate it? When you set text in it? When you show an art director?
