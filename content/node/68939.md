  body: "Yes, I honestly think it's a coincidence. Sometimes font design under strict
    limitations produces similar results. Try making a geometric font out of circles.
    You have to try really hard not to end up with Avant Garde Gothic. When you start
    dealing with pure geometry you always going to get something similar to something
    that's already been made. \r\n\r\nIf you set up a grid for this, of course you're
    going to make it an odd number vertically so you something like a D or S crosses
    in the middle. The grid would most likely be the same if I were to make a Romanized
    runic font. Then you're going to try to let the lines pop into 45 degree angles
    as much as possible.\r\n\r\n<em>Now why would he/she use the same grid as I did
    for all the characters that look exactly the same, and then throw it away for
    just few others?</em>\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, that's what you're \"supposed\" to
    do when you make a modular font. You make it modular but then you do things to
    it after to make it look more interesting, less modular. In this case, it's supposed
    to look hand drawn . . . or kind of ancient or something. So you'd should deliberately
    go off grid. If you were trying to make something that was drawn by a computer
    plotter, then you'd want to always stay on grid. From the looks of it, it wouldn't
    surprise me if it wasn't a runic font that was scanned in from a book and altered
    to look Romanized . . . I only say that because of the weight variation, perhaps
    it comes from different sample sizes, scaled to look the same Also consider: maybe
    the grid was twice as fine and the designer was sticking to every second square
    except in cases where something else was needed, like the cool little crossover
    on the B."

  body: "It's not a coincidence.\r\nSveinn's E, for instance, is a novel idea, quite
    unlike any character in the runic faces.\r\nIt's a Runic \"F\" with an extra bar;
    however, the usual Runic \"E\" looks like M.\r\nCheck out the alphabets on the
    Rune Wiki, you will find no glyph like it.\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runic_alphabet\r\n\r\nHaving
    said that, It looks like general inspiration and some copied letter forms, with
    a grunge finish; a lot worse has been done.\r\nIn fact, the overlapping strokes
    of \"ingwaz\" (O) have been applied to B in the derivative font, something which
    Sveinn didn't do.\r\n\r\n(Hope I've got this right. Not a Rune scholar!)\r\n\r\nAlso,
    has this supposedly derivative font been published, or just used privately to
    create artwork?\r\n\r\n"

    of pictures, people and paper to prove it. Thanks for your help.\r\n\r\n@typodermic\r\nIt's
    my understanding this isn't a modular font (also, if you cheat on the modules,
    is it still modular?). I'm sorry if my terminology is wrong.\r\n\r\nThe crossing
    bars came when I was sketching on a grid-paper, and trying to keeping everything
    monospaced. I had dozens of variations of each letter, and noticed the resemblance
    to the elder fu\xFEark and cumae forms in many of them, and decided to study that
    more. I did include the fu\xFEark runes, you can see them under the cyrillic and
    greek characters in the big text-block on top.\r\n\r\nAnyway... I think you're
    making a lot of assumptions, and I still think it's too much of a \"coincidence\".
    \r\nAnother example, why would the designer do the X the exact same way as I did,
    if there's no strict grid to follow? Wouldn't it make more sense considering the
    rune-like nature of it to just keep it straight instead of bending the end of
    the bars 45\xB0 in?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/x_3832.jpg]"

    guess there's a tipping point where you've changed so much that it's not modular
