  I wonder if anyone can ID this serif, the closest match I got before was Bembo Book
  but the distinctive W is missing. Many thanks in advance."

      so I am guessing it must have been in the 70s.

  body: woodwood, sorry, I do not know this. It may pre-date digital typefaces. Perhaps
    someone else can answer your question.
