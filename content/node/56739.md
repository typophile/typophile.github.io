  but thought someone might be able to help. I have to redraw a map using InDesign
  (or Photoshop I suppose). It exists only as a flipchart with marker pen drawing.\r\n\r\nThe
  map contains type and normal map icons such as hills and houses. There is a river
  on the map. I want to have the river growing in width as it nears the sea. I don't
  think a stroke can change width along its length so is there another way I can draw
  the line with a uniformly expanding width?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance :)"

    outline it, draw the river growing as a polygon and compound them.\r\nOr leave
    them as to objects...\r\n"

  body: "What Allimac said.\r\nUsually what I do (I love making maps) is draw the
    rough basis as a stroke, then duplicate the layer just to make sure, outline the
    stroke and manually edit the outlines (because depending on map style, a river
    especially might actually look better when it's not \"mathematically correctly\"
    growing in width). \r\nBut yeah, definitely do it in Illustrator. Hell, you could
    even do it in FontLab. ;-)"

    Illustrator, because I don't usually do the kind of work for which it would be
    useful. But very occasionally I do have a need to create a vector graphic. This
    is how my wife's wedding ring came to be designed in FontLab :)"

  body: "I thought it might be better to use Illustrator. I've only played with it
    a few times years ago and couldn't get tot grips with it. I need to get over that
    and download a trial of Illustrator I guess. \r\n\r\nI used InDesign to make a
    street map of central Bangkok this week (will post if anyone's interested) and
    liked the result so thought it could be ok to try rivers with it too.\r\n\r\nNot
    sure Fontlab will solve the problem as I need to design the river around the non-vector
    parts of the map.\r\n\r\nThanks for the tips, will play with it and post what
    happens."

  body: That is clever typography! I wonder how that would be set up in InDesign...can't
    be columns, just manual spacing I guess. Nice.

    with strokes?\r\n\r\nStrokes are a pain in the ass, they are unreliable. Just
    trace the contours of the river with the pen tool, then remove any strokes and
    fill the shape with a solid color?"
