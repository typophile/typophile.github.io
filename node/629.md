  body: 'Hmm... have I finally made a stumper? OK, here&#39;s a hint: there&#39;s
    another typeface which is practically identical to this one. The names of these
    two typefaces have two words each, and the second word of each is identical to
    the other. The two first words, put together, form the full name of a 20th-century
    author who, at one time, was quite well-known.'

    <BR> <BR>I&#39;m assuming we&#39;re talking about Nos. 5 and 7. <BR> <BR>Unfortunately,
    I have no idea what those are, but the No. 5 looks Storm-ish, and the No. 7 looks
    like some variation of Garamond, though not one I&#39;ve found so far, though
    Garamond #4 looked promising for a minute. How close am I? Any clues?'

    5 might look Storm-ish because he recently did a  <BR>revival of this text face.
    This is not the Storm version,  <BR>however.  <BR> <BR>No. 7 traces its roots
    earlier than Garamond, but is a  <BR>relatively recent &#40;well, 1996&#41; rendition/interpretation.

  body: Although not an exact match &#40;the sample seems to be an italic or at least
    slanted/oblique; while the FontFont catalogue shows no such versions; and the
    radius of the upper left corner seems to be greater in the sample&#41;, it seems
    to share some characteristics with FF Zan by Albert Boton.
