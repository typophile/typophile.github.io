  there are hundreds of graphs. Currently the graphs are almost to the point of not
  being legible. I am wondering if there are any webfonts that really work well at
  smaller sizes...sort of in the same vein as HF&J's Retina but for web. I have found
  a few options but figured I would see some variety from the folks here..\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    are other options besides Arial and Verdana, but how many depends on size. For

    and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trebuchet_MS\">Trebuchet</a> were designed
    for screen usage. For positive confirmation I\u2019d ask <a href=\"http://typophile.com/user/4431\">Kevin
    Larson</a>.\r\n\r\n<em>However</em>, beyond ~300 PPI at a distance of ~30 cm,
    resolution doesn\u2019t matter. With certain exceptions \u2014 such as a crappy
    ATM or giant airport sign \u2014 we are moving away from needing to concern ourselves
    with screen resolution as a factor (and eventually hinting and rasterization).\r\n\r\nThis
    has been discussed at great length here, but I do not have any specific threads
    ready to mind. You can read more about it in <a href=\"http://prometheus.med.utah.edu/~bwjones/2010/06/apple-retina-display/\">an
    article about Apple Retina Displays</a> from Jonesblog, as well as:\r\n\r\nCurcio,

    topography. <em>Journal of Comparative Neurology, 292(40)</em>, 497-523. doi>10.1002/cne.902920402\r\n\r\nBernard,

    need database access to get at those last two, but I have had great success simply
    contacting the primary authour and requesting an electronic copy of the article
    in the hopes it will you assist you in your research, and you will be able to
    cite them (academics like to brag about how many times they have been cited)."

    you were to make that \"...doesn't matter for legibility,\" then I might agree.
    I'm guessing that's what you meant.\r\n\r\nHrant, why do you expect resolution
    to still affect legibility under such circumstances? Let's say 300 ppi but at
    a distance of 60 cm, so typical book-reading or tablet e-reading distance."

  body: "Good question, but do we mean legibility or readability?\r\nHeck, the former
    does fine at double-digit resolutions!\r\nConcerning the latter, since the difference
    (at the 30cm,\r\n12\" typical reading distance for a printed book) between\r\n1200dpi
    and 2400dpi is noticeable*, but between 2400dpi\r\nand 3600dpi isn't, I'd say
    at least 2000dpi. I'd estimate\r\nthat good** onscreen anti-aliasing halves the
    resolution\r\nrequirement, so around 1000 ppi.\r\n\r\n* And anything that can
    be seen\r\nconsciously <em>must</em> affect reading.\r\n\r\n** Which BTW is <em>not</em>
    the iOS/OSX stuff.  :-(\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
