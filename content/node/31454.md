  and natural history museum.\r\n\r\nNow I'm in to work on the wall texts/labels etc.
  Help me find the charm and possibly point me toward a sans that would stand with
  this mighty stencil to inform the wee ones about caveman surgery and other marvels
  of natural history."

    it.\r\n\r\nI think when I look at this I'm not sure why you would make a stencil
    version of Garamond\u2014so it feels like a kind of joke.\r\n\r\nSo given the
    editorial development is already a bit behind and I don't know word counts, I'm
    thinking DynaGrot is probably a decent choice and with the various versions I'm
    going to be able to deal with about anything.\r\n\r\nI'm thowing this out to see
    if anyone tells me something I don't know about the stencil version, and the particular
    Garamond version the stencil is based on."

    face could theoretically or potentially have its stencil version, if you need
    to paint a sign with it...  :-)\r\n\r\nHave you ever seen <a href=\"http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Avia\">Avia</a>?
    It's inspired by hairlines that go missing in \"faulty platemaking or light inking\"...
    There's no real \"need\" for a font like this, but I think that it's fun that
    someone was inspired by this kind of error to make a typeface from it. (Maybe
    I'm crazy for seeing a parallel to Garamond Stencil in this, but it just popped
    into my head when I read your post.)"

  body: "I think you are right, but I see stencil fonts as being simplified fonts
    designed to endure spray paint or other less perfect appications. To take a serif
    face, that is naturally maybe not a great candidate for the stencil treatment,
    and do this\u2014I wonder about the designer's own sense of humor in relation
    to the work."

    Stencil as though it were a physical stencil (large, on walls and glass, ideally)
    as much as possible, but then throwing a twist in there - placing it at a size
    or on a surface where stencils would fear to tread (web? carpet? 6pt?) with a
