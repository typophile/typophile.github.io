  However I'm not so sure this works...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Guillemet

  lower them, I suppose it would be useful to have a case variant for caps settings.
  What do people prefer?"

  body: Yes, I will have a closer look at it then. And yes, I think the guillemets
    sit too high in the lower line. That might just be because I'm too used to x-height
    centered guillemets, though. Do you know of a typeface that has cap-centered guillemets?

    the question has changed slightly then. The lowercase ones should be centred on
    the x-height, but the case-sensitive ones seem to be sometimes centred on the
    cap height (Meta Serif as Florian posted) and sometimes substantially lower (Warnock
    above). I wonder which is more \xAD\xABcorrect\xBB with the majority of designers?"

  body: "For Camphor I used centered on x-height for default and centered on cap height
    for case sensitive. I'm not getting why Warnock's is lower; it may be partially
    a function of a high-ish crossbar on the H throwing things which are actually
    centered south, nevertheless it certainly appears low in spite of the high crossbar.
    I imagine some designers go for optical centre over mathematical centre. That
    would pull the crossbar and the guillemet closer together for sure.\r\n\r\nCan
    anyone shed any light on Warnock's caps guillemets being lower than centre?"

  body: I have put "all cap" punctuation alternates in a number of faces, and for
    some reason it often seems problematic to centre them vertically (optically or
    otherwise). I suspect that we are so used to seeing mixed-case punctuation that
    centred punctuation doesn't look right, even in an all cap setting.

    course. That said, size and colour of guillemets is a tricky business, and it\u2019s
    related to the intended use of the typeface. In a book setting, for example, where
    they\u2019re used to mark dialogues, they need to stand out enough to aid scanning
    the text, but not too much, otherwise they could hinder reading.\r\nI think Vesper\u2019s
    ones are of the latter type: beautiful and good for display. Not so much for running

  body: The beauty of Opentype is that case specific sets of marks are easily possible.  I
    always include height variations as classes so that the same opentype feature
    code picks up all supported variants. Since I always include case variations for
    hyphen, endash, emdash, paren, etc, adding guillemots is quite easy.  It is in
    most cases a shift of vertical position only but there are a few times when you
    may kern slightly differently. I also make a variation for smallcaps and sometimes
    adjust size as well as position.  I usually make the same sort of variation for
    currency, ampersands, and sometimes math symbols. The user, by selecting smallcaps,
    will automatically get the correct set to match so it is easy to use.  The problem
    comes with some applications not properly supporting opentype features.  This
    I can't control. Smallcaps is tricky in one respect when you have mixed case so
    I just have the variants in place when Smallcaps from caps is chosen or in some
    cases I use contextual alternates so that it will only precede a smallcap glyph.

    in text. Maybe the difference in size is a bit extreme here, but in principle,
    both is possible \u2013 having smaller outer ones (as in Rob Keller\u2019s Vesper,
    when pointing inward), and larger outer ones (as in Karsten Luecke\u2019s Grotext).
    For more examples of guillemets where the outer ones are smaller (although not
    as much as in Vesper), have a look at several fonts by Luc(as) de Groot \u2013
    especially those that he did for German newspapers: <a href=\"http://www.lucasfonts.com/typeshow/?ts-font=Floris%20JW&ts-style=Regular\">Floris

    off the intervening letters better than the same-sized ones, drawing less attention

    not really familiar with this style of quote. Have you had any feedback from continental
    designers?
