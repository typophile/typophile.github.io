body: "The issue of the correct pronunciation of names and terms has come up periodically
  on Typophile. Don't worry, this isn't going to be a rehash of those threads, I think.\r\n\r\nRecently,
  I started work on a pet project of mine, <a href=\"pyogi.pbwiki.com\">a website</a>
  (almost entirely in Korean for now) to help standardize the spelling of foreign
  names using the Korean alphabet, hangul. There are certain rules and guidelines
  to this process set by the National Institute of the Korean Language, but most Koreans
  are not familiar with them and find them difficult to follow. The website will be
  a database of sorts with numerous examples of properly applied hangul transcriptions
  of names.\r\n\r\nTranscription of non-Korean names into hangul, a process I call
  hangulization, is based on the pronunciation of the names in the original language
  rather than the original spelling. For certain languages including Spanish, Dutch,
  and Czech, the pronunciation is fairly predictable from the spelling so there are
  rules for converting the original spelling into hangul. For English, French, and
  German names however, a knowledge of the original pronunciation is absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nFor
  fun, I started a list of type designers there, culling names from Typophile and
  other sources. I kind of went overboard with the list, so it has several hundred
  names; it is also very Typophile-heavy and not very objective or balanced.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
  I'm confident about the correct hangulization for most of the names, and I e-mailed
  a couple of people to get the pronunciations of names I wasn't sure about. But there
  still are a lot of names whose pronunciations need to be verified, and that's why
  I'm asking for your help.\r\n\r\nI would specifically like help with the pronunciation
  of any of the following names:\r\nMarian Bantjes (Canada)\r\nGerald Giampa (Canada)\r\nPatrick
  Giasson (Canada)\r\nJames Grieshaber (US) \r\nMark Jamra (US)\r\nGerry Leonidas
  (Greece) - Is the 'g' in 'Gerry' hard or soft?\r\nG\xE9rard Mariscalchi (France/Canada)\r\nJames
  Montalbano (US)\r\nNeil Summerour (US)\r\nKai Oetzbach (Germany)\r\nThomas Marecki
  (Germany) - Is it 'Marekki' or 'Maretski'?\r\nJulien Janiszewski (France)\r\nG\xE9rard
  Mariscalchi (France/Canada)\r\nThierry Puyfoulhoux (France)\r\nMagnus Rakeng (Norway)
  - Is the 'k' pronounced 'k' or 'kj'?\r\n\r\nAlso, was I right to hangulize the following
  names according to the Catalan pronunciations?\r\nJoan Barjau (Spain)\r\nLaura Meseguer
  (Spain)\r\nJosep Patau (Spain)\r\n\r\nIsraeli names are also confusing. Is it Yanek
  Iontef or Yontef? How is 'Henri Friedlaender' pronounced in Hebrew?\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pyogi.pbwiki.com/%25EA%25B8%2580%25EA%25BC%25B4-%25EB%2594%2594%25EC%259E%2590%25EC%259D%25B4%25EB%2584%2588\">The
  full list of type designers can be found here.</a> I included my own notation to
  show approximately what was transcribed into hangul for each of the names, so you
  can check if I'm using the right pronunciations.\r\n\r\nIt's a huge list, so I'm
  bound to have made a number of mistakes. Let me know if you spot any. Let me know
  also if you want additions to the list. It will be better if you supply the correct
  pronunciations as well. Don't be too shy to suggest your own name if you are a published
  type designer."

  body: "<cite>There is an English word for what you are doing: it is called \u201Ctransliteration\u201D

    in the narrow sense of a mapping from one writing system to another, as opposed
    to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_%28linguistics%29\">transcription</a>,
    the mapping of the sounds of a language to the writing system of another language.
    Everyday usage conflates the two, but I want to maintain a distinction between
    the two terms since it's a somewhat specialist website.\r\n\r\nThe rendering into
    hangul that I describe is theoretically transcription, since it is meant to be
    based on the pronunciation, but in practice it's a mixture of transcription and
    transliteration. The words <em>romanization</em> and <em>cyrillization</em> refer
    to such broad mixtures of the different modes of rendering words into the Roman
    alphabet and the Cyrillic alphabet respectively, so I'm using the analogous word
    <em>hangulization</em> to broadly describe any rendering of foreign words into
    hangul.\r\n\r\n<cite>Shouldn\u2019t be a problem with Shinn :-)</cite>\r\n\r\nIndeed.
    'Nick Shinn' is rendered \uB2C9 \uC2E0 in Korean, and \uC2E0 is actually a Korean
    surname as well!"

  body: "I see the strict definitions of transcription and transliteration that you
    link to, but you are right they don't quite work, so maybe your word is indeed
    best. \"Transcription\" in English is normally from spoken to written, as when
    a court reporter takes down everything that is said for a court record. \r\n\r\nI
    am familiar with Hebrew transliteration, which is rarely done as the article defines
    it, namely as a system which enables you to reconstruct the original spelling
    in the other language. \r\n\r\nAs [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Hebrew|this
    article on Romanization of Hebrew]] explains, the Romanization of Hebrew is basically
    a mess. There are so called 'scientific' ways of doing it, systematically, in
    the strict definition of 'transliteration', but they are rarely followed. There
    are a lot of different ways that are practiced, so 'Iontef' and 'Yontef' are the
    same in Hebrew, and he himself might not romanize it the same way all the time.
    Basically people today tend to romanize Hebrew roughly as it sounds spoken in
    modern Hebrew, but 'roughly' the operable word. \r\n\r\nHenri Friedlaender was
    raised in Germany and left because of the Nazis. So his name would I guess be
    properly pronounced as in German.  "

  body: "William, thanks for your explanation about the romanization of Hebrew being
    a mess. Koreans can't be depended on to romanize their own names consistently,
    either, and most do not follow any of the existing systems for transliteration.
    It would be good to know which spelling Iontef/Yontef himself uses though, if
    he does favour one over the other.\r\n\r\nFrom what I can gather, Henri Friedlaender
    was born in France and lived in Germany and the Netherlands before going to Israel.
    He has a French given name and a German surname. I'm going by the Hebrew spelling
    of his name (\u05D4\u05E0\u05E8\u05D9 \u05E4\u05E8\u05D9\u05D3\u05DC\u05E0\u05D3\u05E8),
    which seems to represent 'Hnri Fridlndr' going by a chart of the Hebrew alphabet.
    I was hoping a typophile could supply the missing vowels in the most common pronunciation
    of his name in Hebrew. I'm guessing 'Henri Fridlander' or 'Henri Fridlender'."

    like a long ''e'' (see), but without the diphthong that English has. Both the
    ''ae'' and the ''e'' before ''r'' would be like an English short "e" (bed), I
    am guessing, as that would be closest to the German. '

    so epenthetic vowels (in most cases '\u3161' IPA [\u026F]) are inserted, after
    which the devoicing issue is moot since they are no longer consonant clusters.
    \r\n\r\nIn addition, unlike most European languages, Korean consonant phonemes
    don't follow the voiced-devoiced distinctions but a three-tier distinction based
    on aspiration and tenseness. We don't have voiced consonants per se, but some
    consonants that are voiced in certain environments (and most Koreans won't hear
    the difference anyway). The idea that voiced and devoiced consonant pairs like
    'v' and 'f' can be different realizations of the same underlying sounds is not
    at all obvious to Koreans.\r\n\r\n[edited to add:]\r\n\r\nThank you Julien! It's
