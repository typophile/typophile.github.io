  body: "It looks like you're barking up the wrong tree. The original book appears
    to have been published in 1962, when handlettering was still a mainstay of any
    art-school curriculum, and publishers often used handlettering on book covers
    and jackets, as is the case here. The two <strong>B</strong>s are not identical,
    nor are the two <strong>a</strong>s. (It's harder to see the differences in the
    three <strong>e</strong>s, but they aren't identical, either.) \r\n\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/baker-signet/|Baker
    Signet]] is similar, though it doesn't have the single-story <strong>g</strong>.\r\n\r\n"
