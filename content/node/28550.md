body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nUpper management where I work just decided that the Convocation
  booklet (the order of proceedings and list of graduate names for the graduation
  ceremony) ought to be bilingual. And I think I may be bald by November. \r\n\r\nIt's
  a small-ish book. (8.5 x 11 folded) and there are a few pages of text like \"message
  from the President\" and \"A word about Concordia\" etc... I'm having a tough time
  figuring out how to incorporate all this French text--Even the titles of the dudes
  presenting degrees (Vice-Dean of Fine Arts, Provost, etc) need to be bilingual.
  \r\n\r\nSo what I'm wondering is this: Can anyone point me to examples of other
  similarly sized *bilingual* books? I think this would probably be a lot easier if
  I were working with a full letter sized page. Somehow, though, I don't think I'll
  be able to convince them to change the booklet size.\r\n\r\nAs I see it I have three
  options: 1-- do a flip-over back to back booklet. This means double the pages and
  also double the work importing and updating names in two different places. 2-- Double
  columns left-english righ-french. This may get confusing for the reader and I think
  it looks cluttered. Results in short, newspaper-column-like line lengths. 3-- alternating
  so that French always appears on the left hand page and English always on the right.
  \r\n\r\nAt least with option two and three the list of graduates names only has
  to be included once, with the headers (Bachelor of Fine Arts) appearing in both
  languages above the list. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any thoughts or experience with
  this? I've never done a bilingual publication--usually we do them separately. I'm
  feeling a little lost and dejected about this. The book had just been re-designed
  and was looking very lovely. No more. *sigh*\r\n\r\nThanks for any input you can
  give.\r\nKristina"

    too) solutions, where Finnish is in different font and/or colour and/or size to
    Swedish, even when they appear on the same page. Swedish being the minority language
    (but an official one), it usually gets the secondary role. I assume in Canada
    one should treat the languages equally, at least in size?"

    discouraged. I'll try using 2 different fonts -- because I think that on the second
    and third pages the reader will need some kind of visual cue -- and, no, I couldn't
    make the French smaller. Although I wonder if the sign law applies ;)\r\n\r\nI'll
    post when I'm done. This kind of stuff always happens at the 11th hour, though,
    doesn't it?\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\nK."

    it's Quebec, anything is possible.  ;-)\r\n\r\nDepending on what sort of colour
    specs you're working with, there may be an Option 4: what about setting the English
    in one colour and French in the other?  Combine that with one as a serif and the
    other sans, and you've got some good visual cues that won't take up excessive
    space or eat into a whole lot of time on your part.\r\n\r\nLinda"

  body: The only I can add is the text in French is longer that text in English. So
    the options that place French and English together will result in a shorter English
    column than the French. But I figure you already know this.

  body: "As much as I would like to be able to do two colours, we are unfortunately
    limited to black inside. The cover is black and burgundy.\r\n\r\nI tried combining
    sans with serif, but honestly I don't have much selection (can you say budget
    cut backs?) - I think all the sans I have look terrible next to any of the serifs
    I would want to use, and also don't include all the features I'd like them to.
    We're trying for \"elegant and conservative\" (not my words)... as well as legible
    enough for the parents and grandparents of the graduates. ;) I've settled on Minion
    Pro and I think I might set the French in italics. I know it's harder to read,
    but English is our primary audience. Also it may help keep the French text from
    surpassing the length of the English by too much. I think I'll play with the two
    column/one column idea as well. \r\n\r\nThanks you for the suggestions!\r\nGotta
    go - fire drill.... grrr.\r\nK."

    least it's <em>only</em> a fire drill, given how close you are to Dawson.)\r\n\r\nL."

    that on facing pages bilingual pages (option 3 above) I can/should number them
    with the same page number. However, I will switch after about page 10 to the list
    of names, which I won't repeat on both pages of the spread. Do you think it's
    ok for me to change the page number mid-booklet or should I number even the beginning
    pages sequentially despite them being the same content. (was that clear?)\r\n\r\nThanks
