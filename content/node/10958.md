  body: Almost, Eduardo, but notice the bottom of the lc &#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;
    and &#39;d&#39; are not right. Did anybody else digitize a version of Agency?
    Or maybe it <i>is</i> a little customized.

    a difference that makes or breaks whether you use Agency, I&#39;m sorry, but that&#39;s
    ridiculous.'

  body: I doubt this is a font available for purchase. It&#39;s most <BR>likely a
    knockoff derived from the custom logo. Fan <BR>knockoffs are increasingly common
    and rarely well- <BR>designed and engineered. So, Tom, the font you need  <BR>depends
    on what you need to use it for.
