body: 'I''m currently working on typesetting a novel for a class project and I''ve
  chosen A Clockwork Orange and while I know it''s not common to use too many typefaces
  in one book I want to push the boundaries slightly. I want to express in the three
  parts of the novel the change in personality that comes across the main character
  Alex. If you have read the novel you will know what I am referring to. I have currently
  set the book in jensen but my teacher made the recommendation of perhaps using different
  faces from a relative family ie: helvetica + univers + frutiger (or an equivalent
  trio of serif families)he then suggested Lukas Degroot''s Thesis family here: perhaps
  TheSans + TheMix + TheSerif and I had a look and they are beautiful typefaces but
  I wanted to look at some other options. In particular an all serif selection. '

    subtle change, unless you happen to be a typoholic reader. ;-)\r\n\r\nBook designer
    Chip Kidd, in his novel <a href=\"http://www.trashotron.com/agony/reviews/2002/kidd-the_cheese_monkeys.htm\"><em>The
    Cheese Monkeys</em></a>, changed the typeface at a certain point in the novel
    (he wrote it, typeset it, and designed the cover).\r\n\r\nIt's been a while since
    I read <em>A Clockwork Orange</em>, or seen Kubrick's film of the book. But here's
    an idea: since you want to push the boundaries slightly, and you are looking for
    serif faces, how about using three different classifications of serif types? In
    other words, use an Oldstyle (or Humanist) face, a Transitional face, and a Modern
    (or Didone) face."

  body: Oh that is a nice idea could you perhaps make some reccommendations as to
    what faces would suit that perhaps? Just so I can see if I have them. And this
    book is for my typography class so we're all typophiles lol
