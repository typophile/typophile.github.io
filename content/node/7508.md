  body: Caslon 3 is bolder. <BR> <BR>540 has old style figures, small caps and swash
    variants. It&#39;s a more versatile choice. <BR> <BR>Depending on your application,
    you might also look at Adobe Caslon, Big Caslon, Founder&#39;s Caslon and Lanston
    Caslon.

  body: The digital version of Caslon 540 is better suited for display use--Big Caslon
    and the display cuts of Founder&#39;s Caslon are made for display. Adobe Caslon,
    the text cuts of Founder&#39;s Caslon, and Lanston Caslon are geared for text
    use. <BR> <BR>Adobe Caslon has all the trimmings--small caps, swashes, ornaments--plus
    it&#39;s available in OpenType. <BR> <BR>I haven&#39;t used Founder&#39;s or Lanston
    Caslon so I can&#39;t comment on them.

  body: 'There was once an article titled &#34;Which Caslon?&#34; in Serif magazine.
    It compared: Adobe Caslon, Berthold Caslon Buch BQ, Big Caslon CC, Lanston Caslon
    337, Caslon 471 BQ, Adobe Caslon 540, Bitstream Caslon 540 and ITC Caslon 224
    BQ. I&#39;ve only kept one page of the article, showing the title of the article
    in the eight faces. Of those, to me the Adobe Caslon &#40;first one&#41; seems
    to strike a good balance between authenticity and readability. Then there&#39;s
    HW Caslon, of course: <BR><a href="http://www.hwcaslon.com/" target="_blank">http://www.hwcaslon.com/</a>

  body: If you intend to use Caslon Oldstyle for text it is highly recommended you
    use Lanston&#39;s Caslon 337. <BR> <BR>Lanston version ranked first ahead of Adobe
    in &#34;Publish Magazine&#34;. <BR> <BR>Gerald Lange I believe was unable to distinguish
    the difference between the digital version and the hot metal version lines inserted
    in &#34;The Fount&#34;. Caslon 337 was made using the original Caslon punches
    for source. <BR> <BR>Caslon 337 is a complete face, with oldstyle, lining, small
    capitals, full set of ligatures, italic, with swash and the long {s}. <BR> <BR>Also
    it is complete with long and short descenders.  <BR> <BR>The Boston Globe used
    Caslon 337 for their anniversary edition. <BR> <BR><a href="http://lanstontype.com/CaslonFountEight.html"

    are reading impaired then you could take Hrant&#39;s advice into consideration.
