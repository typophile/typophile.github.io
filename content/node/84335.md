body: Hi typophile and typophile's members. I'm taking advantage of this blog platform
  to write some words about my MA graduation thesis in graphic design, talking about
  typography in music publishing (first of all typography in western or mensural notation)
  and how it could be improved. Right now I'm still collecting resources (any suggestion
  is obviously welcome), I will start start soon posting and sharing my work in progress...
  I hope it will take me to succeed my dissertation (at least...). Stay tuned!
