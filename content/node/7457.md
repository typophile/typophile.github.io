  well-written and easy to understand to help me get a better grasp on this beast?

  body: If you know InDesign then Quark won&#39;t be hard. I learned on Quark and
    then switched to InDesign. As long as you know some basics, you&#39;ll be fine.
    <BR> <BR>I am a fan of the Visual Quickstart Guides. They&#39;re normally very
    concise and to the point, and I have a short attention span, so that helps. It
    doesn&#39;t go as in-depth as say the Bibles, but it&#39;s much easier to find
    answers to specific questions with one of these. <BR> <BR>I hope it helps. <BR>

  body: Just take inventory of all the standard keyboard, mouse and software conventions
    that you are used to in all of your graphic design software. Then just do the
    opposite inside of QuarkXPress. <BR> <BR>;o&#41;

  body: I&#39;ll second the suggestion made by DeWitt. The Visual QuickStart series
    is worth a look-see. I&#39;m not so sure I&#39;d buy one though. I&#39;d sooner
    check the local library and then photocopy the quick-key pages.  <BR> <BR>As cheesy
    as some tips &amp; tricks sites may be, you can also google for a lot of useful
    stuff. <a href="http://graphicdesign.about.com/gi/dynamic/offsite.htm?site=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitrain.com%2FTips%2FQX.html"
