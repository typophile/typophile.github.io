  body: "The ring is an interesting idea, but the diamond itself is too subtle; it
    looks like a smudge in the smallest size logo. And the ring's upside down orientation\_bugs
    me."

  body: ok, that makes sense.  A close friend and advisor also said that the ring
    needed to be more visible.  I can see where you're coming from on the orientation
    of the ring also, I will try to adress that. Thanks

  body: I realize the type choices are vintage, Does this read as being dated? would
    this turn off a younger market?

  body: "It's dated in but in a atomic-age way.\r\n\r\nI like the ring, but it may
    need some beefing up when rendered at the smaller size. The diamond on the bottom
    doesn't bother me.\r\n\r\nThe tracking of P H O T O does, though. ;) Tighten that
    up. I realize the H and y might conflict. Perhaps make the H lower case to remove
    the right portion to leave room for the y's descender. Or...maybe allow the ring
    'O' to be larger and then drop PH TO down a bit. \r\n\r\n"

  body: The script is a nice choice, but the font for photo is too stylized and competes
    with the title - try to find something to compliment and play 2nd fiddle better.  The
    ring is ok, but it doesn't seem essential, so maybe try doing something more subtle
    with it or even just let the nice script stand alone.  I think it (the script
    alone) speaks to the industry enough without the explicit inclusion of the ring.  Or
    maybe also try including a simplified version of the ring where it is, but not
    use it as part of the word photo.  I think icons as replacement letters tends
    to be corny anyway.  Hope that helps.
