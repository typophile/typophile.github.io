  body: "Hm, that's a tough one, as the type is blurry, bent, shaded, and filled with
    a gradient. It's in the same style as <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/29304\">Trooper
    Roman</a>, but not quite. I'll see if <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Rookledges-Classic-International-Typefinder-Christopher/dp/1856694062\">Rookledge</a>'s
    provides any solace.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, maybe check this handy FontList of
    <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/genres/extra_bold_high_contrast_serifs/\">Extra
    Bold High Contrast Serif Faces</a>."
