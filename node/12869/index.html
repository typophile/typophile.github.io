  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello to everybody,</p>
<p>I was thinking on this day, in which i am building my website to sell my font designs, to get a deal with an ecommerce service like e-sellerate. They get a 10 percent of the sales, and send them at the end of the month with a check. Checks here in Chile spends 3 weeks in been verified by a bank so its very slow. Wire transfers are slow and cost us$40 aprox.</p>
<p>I think western union its the most fast and secure way to receive money direct from my customers, but i dont know if some typographer of foundry use this method. Dod you know someone?</p>
<p>WU costs 10% to the customer. My idea is to receive the transfer code and email from customer, and then send an email to them in the same day.</p>
<p>Do you think that customers will use this method? i think its more direct and its secure too but i dont know what customers will think about it. In fact any can send money via WU, no need to use a credit card and WU exists in almost any city..</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Miguel Hernández.</p>

<p>I would not use Western Union, they have earned a bad rep because a lot of scammers are using their services. This might not be their fault, but  then there are other services to consider, the biggest one being Paypal.</p>
<p>You can set up your website to collect payments through Paypal and offer the fonts to download immediately after Payment has cleared, so you don&rsquo;t have the to send emails manually and people can get their fonts any time of the day.</p>
<p>Paypal sure has it&rsquo;s problems too, but after coding some sites for clients, I have to say it&rsquo;s the best choice as of now.</p>
<p>Cheers,
The Giraffe</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hey Miguel,</p>
<p>First off, I&rsquo;m very excited to  hear you are going to consolidate your designs under your own brand. In my opinion, this is long overdue.</p>
<p>The service you describe sounds expensive to me. 10% of sales is pretty high, and the fact that they hold your money until they decide to send it to you, less their fee, is also undesirable.</p>
<p>Have you looked into verisign&rsquo;s payflow pro? It&rsquo;s a bit more difficult to implement an SSL certificate, and a bit more expensive to set up a merchant account at your bank, but once you go through the initial expense and hassle, you get a much better system that you control, and you only lose a percent or two per sale to bank fees and credit card fees.</p>
<p>But most importantly, you get access to your sales the day after they occur. That&rsquo;s pretty quick, and no one is holding your funds hostage.</p>
<p>I agree that Paypal leaves a lot to be desired. But, there are a lot of casual web users that use Paypal extensively. You&rsquo;ll probably make more sales if you offer Paypal as an option. But, I wouldn&rsquo;t go with them exclusively.</p>
<p>That said, I don&rsquo;t offer PP as an option at MT.</p>
<p>Also, check out GoDaddy&rsquo;s SSL certificates. They&rsquo;re much cheaper than Verisign&rsquo;s solutions, but there are compromises in the service that make me slightly uneasy. However, depending on your needs, they might offer the best balance of performance and price.</p>

<p>Why not open a Merchant Account with your bank which will allow you to accept credit cards as payment. Your bank should also be able to recommend an on-line payment gateway that they accept.  Depending on the credit cards you accept, the &ldquo;discount&rdquo; they charge (discount is their clever term for fee) can range from around 3.5% and up. There are monthy minimums, but you just have to look at those fees as part of the &ldquo;rent&rdquo; for your online store.</p>
