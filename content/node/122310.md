  body: "This smacks of custom type design.\r\n\r\nThis logo replaced an earlier version
    that was set in Lubalin Graph Bold:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/lubalin-graph/\r\n\r\nThe
    type in the new logo may be a heavily customized adaptation of Lubalin Graph Bold
    Italic:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LubalinGraph_4495.png]\r\n\r\nPlume
    Ad Italic, by Dalton Maag, comes close for the |F| (and it\u2019s not bad as a
    starting point for the |X|):\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/daltonmaag/plume/\r\n\r\nNew
    York to Las Vegas might work for the |O| (and it\u2019s also not a bad starting
    point for the |X|):\r\nhttp://www.fontbros.com/families/new-york-to-las-vegas/styles/regular"
