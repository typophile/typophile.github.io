  body: "Hi Etah!\r\n\r\nThe basic idea is kind of fun and leisure. However I would
    use some better typeface for \"I do\" and the backside of the card.\r\nThe info
    text (and symbols) in the bottom will scare clients away. Just make it as simple
    as possible. That would make a good contrast to the fun approach on the front.
    Had a brief look at your site and I think also that putting a title like \"Artist/Graphic
    designer\" would make a true impression. Well just my personal thoughts. Good
    luck!\r\n\r\nCheers"

  body: "Thanks a lot Stefan. I don't really know what you mean by \"better font\".
    So I just chose another font. And you're right about making the back more simple
    to read. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cardback_5885.jpg]"

  body: "Etah, looks better now. A few things though. Why choose lower case \"e\"
    and \"c\" in your name? Also I would lower the name\r\na bit and put you web address
    at the bottom with the same typeface as the rest of the contact info. Maybe rise
    that whole\r\ntext a tiny bit from the edge. Changing the \"hotmail-address\"
    would also give more respect from clients.\r\n\r\nWlll, a bit of humour/irony
    can't hurt?! I often see graphic design as a \"good wrapper\". For example, if
    ha book has a terrible content, the client still would like to have a good looking
    cover. Now either you accept that and make a good cover or you say \"no thanks\".
    You (hopefully) have the choice of say no if, it doesn't fit your ideal, moral
    etc.Also, as a designer you will not be blamed for the content, product etc. You
    will be judged by your design. right?\r\n\r\nWhen I worked with advertising, I
    could very well be judged in a broader sense because I was sometimes involved
    in the design, strategy, statements etc. And of course in some cases things can't
    just look good. Getting involved in a logo design means (for me at least) it has
    to look great, be logical, practical, economic and be able to work in a wide range
    of environment. \r\n\r\nCheers\r\n/Stefan H"

  body: 'Quirky. <em>I</em> like it, but I suspect that I am not in a majority. Also
    I can see problems with an initial impression it makes if someone is to pass your
    card to a third person. This card needs to be given away with a comment and in
    person. Otherwise its quirkiness may get mistaken for a cockiness. '

  body: "Will, I know what you mean. I wrote that because that's how I feel about
    myself as a designer, not because that's how I feel about graphic design as a
    whole. I'm still a beginner, so I didn't feel I could say something greater than
    that. \r\n\r\nI was just trying to put my personality into this card instead of
    making it serious looking. so maybe that's why it's quirky and cocky looking.
    \r\n\r\nThanks a lot for your help guys. \r\n\r\nI changed the E and C into upper
    case, but is there really a difference? I just liked the lower cases better for
    some reason. And I didn't know there was something wrong with hotmail. But I guess
    I'll have to get a new email then. haha.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cardback_5028.jpg]"

  body: Just some food for thought... I'd suggest slightly kerning your contact info.
    It's pretty tight. I'd also put something else besides dashes in your phone number.
    I dig the rest of it.

    the edges? I want to think they are part of the the shirt from the front, but
    I don't know.\r\n\r\nAlso, the b/w kid's hand is shaped more like a pig's foot.
    Maybe you can try finding a better hand?\r\n\r\nI see way too maybe typefaces,
    especially for a business card. IMHO, this demonstrates creativity but doesn't
    showcase your ability to effectively use type."
