  - but here's the catch - it needs to be condensed and somewhat elegant as well...\r\nI
  did the original design with Letter Gothic but I'm looking for something else, with
  possibly more weight.\r\n\r\nDo you know of a great condensed monospace typeface
  that I may have overlooked?\r\n\r\nI'd love to know about it!\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nViviane"

    it on my list of fonts to try out for this and it just might work.\r\n(Now let's
    see if the client likes it...)"

  body: All monospaced fonts are condensed? Don't type designers make the "M" and
    "W" as narrow as possible, and that sets the width of the font?

  body: "I have seen tricks done with the middle stroke of an M and W to make narrow
    even narrower.\r\n\r\nI think one of the failures of Adobe's Muliple Master technology
    was related to the M and W. \r\n\r\n\r\nIf we inspect Merganthaler/Linotype's
    metal type designs of days gone by, we will find the designs of M and W very much
    differed dependinfg upon the point size of the design. At wider at smaller point
    sizes, and narrower at larger point sizers.\r\n\r\nThis is because to promote
    readability, a wider M or W is required at smaller point sizes, but at larger
    point sizes the increased white space is unnecessary and too dominant.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,
    good monotype designs to appear at smaller point sizes should be wider, than designs
    to appear at larger point sizes, which should be narrower.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a related
    topic, I heard from a professional type designer who did very interesting creative
    work for Microsoft's Typography Group. The designer explained that at very small
    points sizes, widths could be manipulated for on-screen only (@ lower resolution)
    representation, where certain characters could appearer wider than during printing
    at a much higher resolution.\r\n"
