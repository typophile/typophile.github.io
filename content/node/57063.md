    typefaces starting from the advent of cold metal type, then Gutenberg still gets
    credit, because you can still find that typeface available (digitally, of course),
    quality not-withstanding.\r\n\r\nIf you mean still being used from the original
    foundry cold metal font, then I think that maybe Caslon is the one of the oldest.
    I'm not an expert by any means though.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't know the very first \"font\",
    as in hot metal though, which would actually be interesting to know.\r\n\r\nGo
    to the library, find A Short History of the Printed Word by Warren Chappell, and
    you'll find exactly what you're looking for."

  body: "This is a difficult question to answer, because the typeface called bodoni
    is not neccesarily designed by Gianbattista Bodoni. Rather it is based on the
    work of Bodoni, with characteristics the typefaces he cut. Garamond is an even
    more complex story... I second Dan that it would be a good idea to read Warren
    Chappell's book, which is nice to read and gives you lots of insight into the
    history of type. The oldest 'font' is probably Gutenburg's fraktur used for his
    42 line bible, but isn't used much now anymore, because fraktur gave way relatively
    quickly to roman typefaces (except in Germany). Venetian typecutters were very
    important in the development of these roman typefaces, which are still eminently
    readable and are the basis of popular fonts like Bembo. I think the fonts based
    on this period are probably among the oldest still in use.\r\n\r\ncheerio Queneau"

    talking about oldest font that we still use, then a Jenson gets the top nod, I
    should think. But then again, you bring up the point that we're not actually able
    to use a genuine Jenson because it doesn't actually exist anymore.\r\n\r\nSo the
    oldest typeface that a) is still used and b) is still original is the question.\r\n\r\nThat
    brings me back to Caslon, or thereabouts."

  body: "As many of you noted, there are several ways this question can be interpreted.\r\n\r\nIf
    we allow for Bembo and Garamond, but disqualify Trajan and examples such as Jonathan
    Perez and Laurent Bourcellier's <a href=\"http://www.typographies.fr/index.php?page=fontes&s=Hi%E9roglyphes\">Hi\xE9roglyphes</a>,
    then a sensible set of criteria might be as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The font must be
    still in use, in a digital format (the prevalent format today), not collecting
    dust in a museum somewhere. This disqualifies the re-cut B-42 Blackletter type
    that Kegler mentioned, because it doesn't come as a font that can be used on a
    computer.\r\n\r\n2. The original design must be a 'font' as well, that is, a system
    for mechanical reproduction of writing that incorporates at least some basic analysis
    of the graphemes that make up writing so that they can be used to set a wide range
    of texts. Hand lettering does not count. Cylinder seals and woodblock printing,
    capable as they are of reproducing writing mechanically, can only reproduce the
    specific texts they are designed for and cannot be used to set other texts, so
    they don't count either. I don't think there is anything we can really call fonts
    before the invention of moveable type.\r\n\r\n3. The current digital incarnation
    must be a faithful revival of the original design, enough to be widely accepted
    as an adaptation into a different format of the same design rather than a design
    loosely inspired by the original. Much of this is up for debate; it helps when
    as in the case of Bembo or Garamond, they are marketed as digital versions of
    the original designs.\r\n\r\nThere was an essay in the 2005 <em>Geulkkol</em>
    annual published by the Korea Font Development Center about a revival of the hangul
    (Korean alphabet) wood type used for <em>Dongguk Jeong-un</em> ('Dictionary of
    Proper Sino-Korean Pronunciation'), published in 1447. I left the annual back
    in my old apartment in Seoul, so I couldn't tell you what came of it.\r\n\r\nI
    do know that Sandoll, a Korean foundry, are selling a revival of the hangul metal
    type used for <em>Worin Cheon-gang Jigok</em> ('Songs of the Moon Shining on a
    Thousand Rivers'), also dating from 1447.\r\n\r\nThese are not straightforward
    revivals. They have been adapted for horizontal writing, and there is no support
    for archaic letters while syllables needed for modern Korean but not found in
    the original documents had to be filled in. In particular, the <em>Dongguk Jeong-un</em>
    revival adds a post-modern twist by simply leaving the space for the syllable-final
    consonant blank instead of stretching out the other letters to fill the square
    (the <em>Dongguk Jeong-un</em> orthography always marks the zero syllable-final
    consonant with '\u3147', so a syllable composed without a syllable-final consonant
    doesn't appear in the original).\r\n\r\nStill, I would submit that according to
    the criteria outlined above, they would be fonts still available in the digital
    age with some of the oldest dates of creation, preceding the Gutenberg Bible (but
    not some of Gutenberg's earlier efforts). I don't know about any revivals of the
    oldest Chinese-character fonts, but maybe others can fill us in."

  body: "Things could be narrowed down a lot if these new digital revivals of centuries
    old originals are left out of the argument. Otherwise a font created in 2009 but
    using an original font from the 12th century could be the oldest ever font, which
    I think is silly. I would rather look for fonts that have a long continuous history
    in typography. In this way you probably end up with fonts like Garamond, Caslon,
    Jenson etc. It is deceptive though that there are many fonts named Garamond, often
    with significant differences between them. In this case I think the name rather
    refers to a style of typefaces, rather than one single typeface/font. Garamont
    (!) cut several typefaces in his day, so deciding which one is the real one is
    probably impossible (as several of todays Garamonds even go back to the work of
    others than Claude Garamont's, for instance the work of Granjon). Another element
    to take into account is that there have been several changes in typography, like
    in the role of italics, boldtype and even in the adding of new characters. If
    one tries to find the font that is in use as it was designed until this day you
    probably end up at a later date (Caslon might be close in this case).\r\nA hard
    nut to crack if you really want the definite answer. It could be the work of years
    of typography history research... :)\r\n\r\nA note on chinese type: Though the
    chinese invented movable type before Gutenberg did, the complexity and the sheer
    amount of characters in chinese made it hard to use, and most of the books in
    chinese have actually been made from woodcut texts of entire pages, rather than
    using movable type. It wasn't until the twentieth century that this really has
    changed.\r\n\r\ncheerio Queneau"

    an entire page out of a woodblock would be an unfamiliar concept to Westerners.
    But it makes sense. Once you had the breakthrough of moveable type for linear
    alphabets like Latin, there is no real need to go back to recreating whole pages
    from woodcuts except for illustrations. In Korea, woodblock printing was still
    in use alongside moveable type until the 19th century, because the lack of a printing
    press made moveable type cumbersome enough for woodblock printing to be a viable
    alternative.
