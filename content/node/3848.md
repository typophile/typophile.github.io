  body: Most of these are hand drawn logos. But there are <BR>some fonts along the
    same lines. Have a look at <BR><a href="http://typographi.com/2002_05_15.php#000037"

  body: Please help! <BR> <BR>I am looking for a font/typeface that is close to a
    combination of the Frigidaire and/or Cadillac/Chevrolet, and Eureka, &#40;a hearse
    manufacturer&#41;. It is a script type font sort of art-deco, what would have
    been considered futuristic looking in the 40-50&#39;s. <BR> <BR>I have no money
    to spend on it at this time and need a free public domain font, that can be tweaked
    a little. &#40;I also could use some recomendations on software that does that.&#41;
    <BR>Someday I hope to start a hearse manufacturing concern,&#40;a small one&#41;and
    want the typeface to look a certain way, &#40;I can see it in my mind&#39;s eye&#41;
    I am sure you all get the general idea! <BR> <BR>Well that&#39;s about it. <BR>Should
    someone have a font/typeface like this please contact me at. <a href="mailto:joeyp@anet-dfw.com">joeyp@anet-dfw.com</a>.
    <BR> <BR>Thank you in advance for any help you can send my way! <BR> <BR>Joey

    almost Verdana but not quite! Note the level ends on the lower case &#39;s&#39;
    for example. <BR>Not sure whether the upper case words at the bottom is the same.

    on the site are very rudimentary, so I don&#39;t know  <BR>for sure. This might
    be Ninetysix K and Premiere, both from <BR><a href="http://www.playtype.com/"
