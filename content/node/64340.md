    on earth not?\r\nOn my <a href=\"http://readableweb.com\">blog</a> I'm using a
    free font for the logo type called \"chunky\".\r\nI find it delightfully ugly
    but that's my druthers.\r\nAnd it does double-duty at a much smaller size for
    column headings, too.\r\nIn the midst of writing up a case study about the steps
    involved in choosing, deploying, etc...\r\nPlease post about what you decide and
    where it ends up.\r\n\r\nrich\r\n"

  body: "I agree with aluminium: Use it if it makes sense for the project. Don't,
    however, use it just because it's free. (Unless you're one of those GPL nuts,
    but that's another issue altogether.)\r\n\r\nEven if it's a non-free font, you
    want your work to stand solid. As it so happens, Aller is a professionally designed
    font, sans-cost, that you shouldn't feel ashamed to use."

  body: "There is always one thing one should consider (in my humble opinion): \r\n\r\nAm
    I going to create a logo, and is that going to be it? In other words, will my
    customer get the logo, and be happy with it, and simply use it? If so, I can use
    ANY font I deem suitable!\r\n\r\nhowever, should it be possible that my customer
    might one day use the font in the logo to do other stuff, like flyers, posters,
    or even use it as a textface.... then I would make sure I am using a font from
    a foundry that I can rely on to keep the font in good shape, and up-to-date. I
    would not use a free font.\r\n\r\nI ran across the following problem quite a few
    times: there was a logo made with a free font, and all of a sudden my customer
    wants to use it for some big time advertisement campaign in all kinds of languages,
    including Cyrillic. The free font was good enough to do the logo - but you could
    not do decent print jobs with it, there was no OT version, and of course no Cyrillic
    version, either. They were quite angry with me when I told them. Shucks.\r\n\r\nSo
    if it is an artsy logo, which will end up being nothing but a cool logo, use everything
    you want! But if it is a business logo, and chances are your customer will get
    ideas, think twice before doing it. I, at least, learned the hard way :-)"

  body: "I'd argue that (most of the time) one would not want the logo typeface (or
    logotype) to be used as standard headline/body type in the rest of the branding.
    You'd want the logo to stand out on its own.\r\n\r\nExceptions would be maybe
    something like the Walker, where the typeface *is* the overall branding element
    moreso than a specific logo. (But in those cases, you likely wouldn't be using
    a off-the-shelf commercial font--let alone a free font)  "

  body: "Free fonts typically won't hold up well for a high-exposure, iconic, branded
    logo.\r\n\r\nBut for lower profile, non-iconic logos that aren't seeking to develop
    a strong brand identity... yes.\r\n\r\nI think it really comes down to branding.
    Most free fonts just can't hang when it comes to competitive branding. But there
    are exceptions.\r\n"

  body: "It also depends a lot on what you do to the font to make your logo. Really
    strong logos most often don't depend ONLY on the font, but its smart usage including
    possibly, tweaking; just setting a word in a font, free or not, does not necessarily
    make the strongest logos.\r\n(Unless maybe if the font is custom and basically
    IS the brand.)"

  body: "Following up on what Werfer said, it is important that if the type might
    break out for other purposes at a later date, the client needs to know that the
    lesser quality font they're considering won't withstand that. It's a dead end.\r\nThe
    font i'm using on my blog is a complete dead end but it's not an issue.\r\nBut
    for a company looking to use it to publish or whatever, they're in real trouble!"
