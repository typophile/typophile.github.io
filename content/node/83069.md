  in each program.\r\n\r\nThe issue that has been bothering me is matching up my lines
  weights between drawn diagonal lines. I want to assure that they are running parallel
  to each other, and I am also curious how hard it is to tweak the angle to match
  if it is off a bit.\r\n\r\nI hope my phrasing makes sense and if not let me know,
  and i'll provide illustrations if needed.\r\n\r\nThanks, again."

  body: 'You can use the measurement tool to check the angles of the lines. If the
    angles are the same, the lines are parallel. You can also check visually by selecting
    the end points of one of the lines and temporarily dragging it over the other
    one. '

  body: Another way is simply to copy one diagonal line segment, paste and drag. The
    copied segment can either serve as a guide, or can be rescaled to replace its
    partner...
