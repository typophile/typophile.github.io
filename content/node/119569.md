    still is not the same font :(\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/schizotype/kazumi-sans/\r\n\r\nIf
    anyone else has any font suggestions, please share. Thanks much"

  body: "Titanium is certainly closer than Gaden Sans (previous post suggestion) or
    Kazumi Sans.\r\n\r\nAnd I wouldn't be so quick to assume that it is an actual
    typeface. It may have been inspired by one\u2014or several\u2014but may be more
    custom than not."

    settings to avoid strange artifacts.\r\n\r\nI repeat, not every logo is hatched
    fully-formed from a typeface...."

  body: Can't agree more with Kevin. This one is surely custom(ized) and Titanium
    is a great ready-to-go alternative, definitely the closest ever suggested.
