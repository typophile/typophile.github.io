  am a student of Graphic Design at the National Institute of design, Ahmedabad, currently
  in the second year. We are having an ongoing course in typography and for an assignment
  we are supposed to research and study different typefaces and their designers. The
  typeface that I have chosen to conduct the research is Myriad Pro. Though I have
  found quite some information on the web but I was hoping if anybody could add to
  my research by providing some useful information about the design process, history
  and other interesting nuances or stories which are not published - or - hard to
  find online because this is a dedicated forum for type design and typography. \r\n\r\nAny
  kind of help and inputs would be greatly appreciated.\r\nThanks, Manushi\r\n\r\n"

    heard from a few sources that he doesn't believe they're useful.\r\nAnd since
    Twombly's first famous font (Mirarae**) has some juicy\r\ntrapping, I suspect
    she had to put her foot down to get trapping\r\nincluded in Myriad. And if it's
    true that the two didn't get along,\r\nI'm sure that didn't help.\r\n\r\n* http://themicrofoundry.com/ss_trapping1.html\r\n\r\n**
