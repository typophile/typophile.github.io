  about type designers, and i'm just writing a long list with the name of (106) type
  designers, where-off they can choose one, to prepare a little lecture ... and as
  so often i'm wondering about the small amount of female type designers. \u201DIs
  there anybody out there\u201D - beside the \u201Cto-me-known\u201D  \u2013  Jill
  Bell, Zuzana Licko, Sybille Hagmann, Veronika Burian, Carol Twombly, Marian Bantjes,

    the breadth isn't there yet. But if the research is only  a quickie 1-pager then
    I guess that there will be enough information. \r\n\r\nSara Soskolne (Currently
    working at Hoefler & Frere-Jones)\r\n\r\nTechnically Marian has only designed
    one typeface, isn't that right? I wonder if she doesn't consider her self more
    of a lettering artist. Although if the research involves a specific typeface .

    \ far by search on typophile ...\r\nto Simon: it's okay ... they are divided in
    six groups ... and we are three colleagues, but it's up to me to do the planning
    ...\r\nto Jelmar: Oh yes, you're right, i forgot her ... but i think she has been
    mentioned also in the tdc-book?\r\nto Tiffany: It'll be a quickie 1-pager, and
    therefore it's enough information! One question \u2013 do you can tell me the
    name of a typeface Sara did work out? \r\nFor today i close now, it's late here

    1 class I was teaching several years ago, one of the students raised her hand
    and said, \"That's the first woman you've mentioned. Are there more?\" So I named
    a few others (including Beatrice Warde, who was not a type designer but was a
    key figure in the development of 20th-century type), and we talked about the imbalance.
    \r\n\r\nI also recall noticing, at a FUSE conference in London in 90-something,
    that the majority of the audience was women, while the preponderance of the presenters
    was men. How come that didn't translate, over the past ten years or so, into a
    much larger number of women at the top of the graphic-design field? (Well, all
    right, the pressures and the reasons are obvious, but still. But still.) \r\n"

  body: "In the first step, I want them to know distinguish typefaces to open their
    mind for the different forms and the uncountable ways to say: A (or B or C ...)
    therefore i'm concentrated to type-designers. The typographers are the second
    step, first they have to learn that typeforms are man/woman-made and that type
    ist not something fallen down by sky or born in computers ...\r\n\r\nBy the way
    \u2013 60% of the 106 students are female, but this has been so since years, when
    i remember my time of studying in the early eighties. The role-model didn't change
    really since that time. To be patient is not sooo easy ;-)"
