  someone here explain me how to use this tool, step-by-step? \r\n\r\nThanks in advance!

  body: "My memory is a little fuzzy, but I did this on two font families back in
    November. Here is what I did (I think\u2026):\r\n\r\n1. First, generate the TTFs
    from FontLab (with the VOLT info box checked in the FL preferences, and the flat
    kerning, too)\r\n\r\n2. Copy the kern2VOLT.exe file into the same folder as your
    TTF on Windows\r\n\r\n3. Open the TTF up in VOLT. VOLT will tell you that all
    OT data will be overwritten. This is OK, OK, of course. Rename all of the glyphs
    using the Glyph Names. Save the TTF.\r\n\r\n4. I will presume that your font is
    named something like MyFont-Regular.ttf\r\n\r\n5. Open up the command line. Type:\r\nkern2VOLT.exe
    MyFont-Regular.ttf Kern.vtl\r\n\r\n6. This should generate a VOLT look-up file
    in the same folder as the .exe file and the TTF, called Kern (of course, it does
    not matter what you name the look-up \u2026 the name will be whatever you type
    before the .vtl extension in the command).\r\n\r\n7. In VOLT, you can import this
    look-up, and assign it to <kern> features\r\n\r\n\r\nMaybe someone will come along
    and correct any discrepancies I have here. Perhaps my order of stuff in the command
    line is off \u2026 I'm pretty sure that it is the .exe, then the .ttf, and finally
    the .vtl, though. Good luck!"

  body: "Dan's explanation is basically correct. kern2volt requires as input a TTF
    with a) an oldstyle kern table containing all the kerning you want to import into
    VOLT and b) glyph names imported in VOLT. So generate a TTF with a kern table
    from FontLab, open it in VOLT, import the glyph names from the post table, save
    from VOLT, run kern2volt from the command line.\r\n\r\nNote that kern2volt has
    an option for right-to-left kerning, but if your project involves both LTR and
    RTL kerning you will need separate TTF sources for each. If a font contains multiple
    scripts, you might also want a separate TTF for each, so that you get separate
    VOLT lookups for different scripts rather than one giant one."

  body: "Thank you, Dan and John for your detailed explanation - however - I'm still
    unable to make it work. The Font 'TulikaBengali-Bold\" contains Flat kerning and
    Post-script names (as you explained), but when I run the Commandline, this is
    what I get:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen_5090.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nAny
    idea where I might be doing wrong?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n"

    that is why it was unable to located the script and font. But since I never used
    the command-line before, I didn't realized. Anyway, all sorted now. :)\r\n\r\nThanks

  body: It is also possible to add kern2volt to your Windows path variables, so that
    you can run it from any directory.
