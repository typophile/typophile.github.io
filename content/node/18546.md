body: "Is it usefull to use a common small cap letter K for the glyph \"[[kra|kgreenlandic]]\"
  (uni0138)? Due to the fact most small caps are a bit higher than the common x-high,
  should this K have the same x-high? \r\n\r\nHave anyone real world examples of the
  usage of this glyph? Is it used on the beginnigs of words only?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0138/index.htm

  body: "if i'm not mistaken, modern orthography favors the use of \"q\" instead of
    the \"greenlandic k\".\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kra_%28letter%29\r\n\r\nwhen
    making the greenlandic k, i usually use the stem of the n and the arms of the
    k."

  body: "The Greenlandic kra is a lowercase letter with no uppercase form. It should
    conform to the proportions of the lowercase letters and be x-height tall. The
    serif treatment of the top of the left stem is best harmonised with that of the
    corresponding serif on the lowercase u (note that this is often flatter than the
    serif on the n to which Paul refers). The right side may be identical to that
    of the k, but if the latter is particularly jaunty you may want something more
    stable for the kra, as in Minion Pro:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ikrak.png]\r\nThe
    Kalaallisut orthography was reformed in the 1970s, and kra is now considered obsolete.
    However, it may occur in older documents whose spelling needs to be preserved
    when digitised, so the character remains useful. Also, it is quite easy and hence
    fun to make."

    opportunity to add some flava. Like what about\r\nthat decidedly jaunty one on
    the Unicode site?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
