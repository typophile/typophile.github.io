  guidelines for a series of twelve books. Its a translation of Marcel Prousts \"In
  search of lost times\". Im not total shure about what my approach will be yet, since
  i just got the job. \r\n\r\nSo if you have any suggestions for some great book types
  from the start 20th century France, it would be helpfull in this initial phase?\r\n\r\n:)\r\nThanks
  in advance.\r\n\r\ncasper"

    target=\"_blank\">Elzevir</a> (or, in this case, Romana, which claims to be based
    on Elzevir), or a simple classic Garamond. A copy of <em>L'Art et Les Artistes</em>
    from 1925 which I am looking at right now uses Garamond throughout for body copy,
    and <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/saturday-morning-toast/\"
    target=\"_blank\">Curtis Post</a> for subheads.\r\n\r\n"
