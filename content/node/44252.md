body: Anyone watch it last night at 9 pm on BBC 4? What did you think of it. I thought
  it was amazing how the historian decided to build his own machine according to Guttenbergs.
  It was amazing how accurate the type seemed etc. What did you think (if you watched
  it?)

  body: "I've just watched the programme and it was fascinating. It covered the whole
    process of designing the press - probably based upon wine presses of the time,
    as Gutenberg lived in the world's largest wine producing area, to the casting
    of the lead type, the making of the paper and finally the printing. The first
    mass-production in the world - ever. Zero to 20 million books in 50 years is some
    going!\r\n\r\nAn interesting fact: If the Bible were to be printed on vellum 140
    calves would be needed. I assume vegetarians only bought the paper versions.\r\n\r\nNick
