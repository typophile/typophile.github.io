body: "Can anyone tell me what font they have used here. I always though that it was
  Futura but at close inspection I'm thinking it might be a combination of fonts because
  of the 'R' looking like a Avanti Garde and the 'S' like DIN but not sure. \r\n\r\n"

  body: It is (mostly) Avant Garde Light. I believe Adrian Pulfer (a former instructor
    of mine) did the type work. It wouldn't surprise me if he had the S altered.
