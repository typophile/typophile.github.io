body: "I need opinions on a good timeless typeface for a few lines of poetry that
  will be tattooed on a friend. Since this will be permanent, I'm treating the responsibility
  of choosing the typeface rather seriously. Here are the lines:\r\n\r\nBut fiction
  flaunts its grave deception,\r\nFlies its flags of grand illusion,\r\nCast a glimpse
  of truth across my eyes,\r\nThen blames me for not anticipating\r\nWhat foreign
  ideas have danced across \r\nMy very being ever since page one ...\r\n\r\nI know
  this could go a number of ways in terms of mood and personality. I'm currently considering
  a few Blackletter style typefaces for a more traditional tattoo feel - namely a
  free font (I know, yikes!) called \"Cloister\" from DaFont.com. But I am also considering
  Minion Pro Semi-Bold and Trajan Pro Bold. I like Trajan for this, except that all
  caps is a horrible idea for something with the expressive, musical quality of poetry.\r\n\r\nI
  am probably looking for a serif font with a timeless appeal that has just enough
  \"style\" to make it stand out from the typical classic serif fonts. But I would
  love to hear any of your ideas or suggestions, regardless of whether they fit within
  these parameters.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nEd "

  body: "If I was you I'd try not to agonize over picking a digital typeface and laying
    out your sample on screen. I think a more fruitful approach would be to find a
    good tattooist who knows / specializes in lettering, explaining what kind of \"feel\"
    you're after, and have them work from your ideas. \r\nSkin is not paper is not
    the screen. And there are people who specialize in skin.\r\n\r\nAnd whatever you
    do: that's a lot of text; be sure you don't go too small with it, especially if
    you're considering a somewhat detailed (such as a seriffed) face."

  body: "Altaira, thanks for the advice! I know that skin is an entirely different
    animal, but I am hoping that a tattoo artist who knows what they are doing will
    be able to use my printed type as a starting point and adjust as necessary to
    make it work without losing the essence of the font in translation.\r\n\r\nI don't
    think size will be an issue. The friend of mine who is getting the tatt already
    has some fairly large lyrics on his back, and I wouldn't want to go much smaller
    than what is already there. Which brings up a point in how the new font will interact
    with his existing ink. I requested a photo of what it looks like now, and I fully
    expect that to influence my decision."

    the same paper / screen / body: yikes (unless they are really very different).

  body: David, I agree. Only problem is that there are already 2 different types in
    use. Maybe it would be best to just go with the better of the 2.

    lately.\r\n\r\nAs a typographer, I think If I got a tattoo, it'd almost certainly
    be type related, but if the thick-thin transition or kerning was even 0.25 mm
    off, I'd probably end up severing an appendage."

    I had half my left arm inked. Not with type. I chose instead to go with an abstract
    constructivist design, bauhaus / mondrian style, and i''m very happy with it.'
