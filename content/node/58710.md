  time and skills to finish them. Is there anyone who would like to continue with
  them and make them real fonts? Examples here: [[http://janneharju.com/2009/06/04/make-my-font/|my

  have time, please check out and comment my illustrations too."

  body: How old are you? I'm sure there will come a moment when you have the time
    to work on Gummi. Otherwise you'll miss all the fun ;-)

  body: "I think perhaps it would be easier to get help if you pay a font designer
    to finish the fonts, instead of offering royalties sharing as stated on your website.
    \r\n\r\nBut then I agree also that you miss all the fun if you let someone else
    do it for you :)"
