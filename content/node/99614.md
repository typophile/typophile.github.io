  body: "Martin, since Typophile is a watering hole for people who make type, it's
    not correct to ask for pirated fonts here. Actually it's not really correct anywhere...\r\n\r\nAnd
    it would be nice if you could manage to develop more respect for a what a good
    font can do for you - enough respect that you give up other things so you can
    afford to pay for them.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I'm sorry. I don't usually download stuff for free on the internet, because
    of the risks involved. I also don't buy other things I don't need. But you have
    to recognize that paying for everything is also quit hard, especially if you don't
    have the money. I, for example, listen to allot of music, and I respect all composers
    and singers who make me enjoy every day. I listen to several local radio stations,
    because they usually like to reveal new talents who dream of becoming popular,
    and I buy the CDs with my favourite songs. Only then do I put them on my mp3.
    But I can't pay 1\u20AC sth for thousands of tunes, so I select them like this:
    I pay for the artists who are unknown and I make free downloads of those which
    are famous, for they definitely have enough money to have a normal life. I don't
    know if you agree with me, but I hope you are able to understand my point of view.
    Again, I apologize for my message, I recognize that it was very incorrect."
