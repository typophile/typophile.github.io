body: "Whe I saw Raphael Freeman's profile picture, I was reminded of a question I've
  had for some time: Is there a good reference for historical Hebrew lettering\u2014perhaps
  even the Aramaic alphabet? Is there another engraved inscription as old as the \"place
  of trumpeting\" stone from the Temple?\r\n\r\n(I know the (Koren) [Yerushalmi] font
  is based on these forms; I'm wondering where there are good primary sources.)\r\n\r\nETA:
  I just remembered that Koren is based on the letterforms in the Aleppo Codex; my
  question has been corrected.\r\n\r\nEATA: Also I found the Uzziah Tablet online.
  Are there other good examples? I'm sort of looking for the equivalent to Trajan's
  column. "
