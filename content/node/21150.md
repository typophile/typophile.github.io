  In any case, I'm searching desperately for a sans serif that isn't so warm, fun,
  cute, etc. Something along the lines of Din in coldness/seriousness, but not so
  tech-y. I just tried Aaux Pro, but I think it's a bit too Din-like. Freight Sans
  and Whitney are nice, but a little warm. Galaxie Polaris is close, but maybe too
  similar to Helvetica. Am I crazy or is this hard to find? Any recommendations?\r\n\r\n"

      too whimsical.

    \r\n\r\nCould you give some examples of the non-stressed sans whose proportions
    you do like? \r\n\r\nIncidentally, very heavy weights tend to be inevitably stressed
    so the joins are not clotted and the counters don't close up. Do you have a problem

    think you and I might have similar taste in Sans. I licensed Whitney before I

    Now they are my go to sans for a lot of things. I will license Verlag because
    I do see it as a nice in between and because I see a lot of Metro in it and I
    love Metro. The only character I'm not completely enraptured with is the lighter
    weights of the lowercase t. In general I'm not fond of that sort of angling off

    dance smoothly on the page when set on large, but are surprisingly usable at small
    sizes.\r\n\r\nBut I can never say no to Kievit -- one of the most versatile creature

    who really has put a lot of time and thought into their work. Of course another
    person of similar experience and thoughtfulness might have quite different taste.
    But still it is quite informative. \r\n\r\nThe sans you like I think are all quite
    strong, with a degree of formality. --Except for Today Sans, which has some modulation
    and some 'serif' action. That one doesn't seem to quite fit your list. Well, so
    much for theory! \r\n\r\nAnyway, I think what might be going on is that a lot
    of the strength of seriffed faces comes from their serifs, and when you take that
    away they but still have the variation in stress, they tend to be weaker, even
    when they have some charm. \r\n\r\nI think that bolder weights of stressed sans
    can still be quite strong, though with less formality. "
