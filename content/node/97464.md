body: Hi all! I have to give a talk for about 7-10 minutes as part of my English course
  at the university. It has to be an informative talk on a topic of my interest and
  I have to describe how things are done. I am into typography and would like to give
  a talk related to it, but I have no idea where to start or what to talk about which
  will be interesting as well as simple for the students to understand. Can you suggest
  what I could do or talk about.

    Maybe there is a way to tie typography into it? The <a href="http://tinyurl.com/d7hlxtw">AgencyRiches</a>
    system is pretty elegant just like Ed Gill's stuff.

  body: "If you're speaking to an audience of students who are not type designers
    or graphic designers, they may wonder why typography is considered a specialized
    skill. After all, most people have a word processing program that lets them choose
    fonts and layouts, so why should they pay a professional?\r\n\r\nI like to compare
    type to music. I love music, but I have never studied music theory. Some kinds
    of music make me feel happy, other kinds make me feel relaxed, other kinds make
    me want to get up and dance--or march. I don't know why music has these effects
    on me, but I feel them whether I understand them or not. The composer of the music
    creates these effects by choosing certain melodic lines, harmonies, rhythms, etc.
    \r\n\r\nType design works the same way. The designer uses curves and lines, contrast,
    x-height, letterspacing, line spacing, line length, etc., to communicate to the
    reader that the text is is rigorous or accessible, elegant or edgy. The typographer's
    unique professional skill is that he or she has learned how the characteristics
    of type resonate in the eye and brain of the reader, and how to use type to amplify
    the message that is being read.\r\n\r\nYou could show several examples that illustrate
    this point (and maybe play a little music, too). "

    letter (like a scripty \"L\") is scanned into a computer and b\xE9zier curves
    warpped around it (automatically and/or manually). If you have time mention the
    following: some people don't scan drawings, they draw with b\xE9ziers directly;
    and if you're making a font you have to do that to hundreds of characters (show
    some Vietnamese ones) and they all have to harmonize bigtime (show a word with
    one letter in the middle slightly too dark).\r\n\r\nAnd record yourself in case

    only enough to give an overview of one aspect of typography. What I would choose,
    because you can show a lot of pictures, is font appropriateness, which fonts can
    be used for different topics. You could show pictures of both display and text
    fonts.\r\nFonts for business reports, like Skolar and others.\r\nUnhip over-used
    fonts, like Times New Roman or MS Comic Sans.\r\nWarm, friendly readable fonts
    for a cookbook, such as New Cuisine or Coline or maybe even Turnip.\r\nElegant
    fonts for a serious art book. Make sure they're not too thin.\r\nFonts that have
    good italics (which in my opinion means dark and full strength) for books with
    a lot of foreign words. Or fonts with complete Western and Eastern European coverage
    for this same category.\r\nBook fonts, here are some nice dark ones: http://typophile.com/node/51171\r\nFonts
    for newspapers\r\nFonts for romance books\r\nSturdy fonts if you suspect the output
    will be photocopied a lot.\r\nOf course there are MANY different opinions about
    what is appropriate. Make sure you say that you are just offering some suggestions!"

    Andreas St\xF6tzner I see typography a craft and although we live in digital age
    I'd like to show people that it's an old profession and that it just doesn't happen
    in an instant like people think it does. Since letters are all around us the average
    person  takes them for granted and being an art student in my short talk I'd like
    to tell the students how typography happens and how letters are created, initially
    i was thinking of asking the students to draw a letter each and then we would
    put them up on the wall, make a sentence and discuss the importance of design
    and planning in typography. But since it's students from different majors that
    i will talk to I wanted to present things as simple and clear possible. All I
    want is to crate awareness for typography, just like there is awareness for industrial
    and fashion design. I know it is challenging but I will try. "

    your professor demands that you hand in the writing assignment typed in a specific

    who forget or ignore professor's instructions and as a result get lower grades.
    To them this might make no sense, but you know that this things matter. \r\n\r\nFor
    example you could pick a font i.e. Times New Roman and talk about its properties,
    history, how and why it has become the standard choice amongst the academics when
    there are many other fonts on our computers. Explain why is it a better choice
    than Arial for longer texts, etc. Good luck!"

  body: "I would distinguish between typography as done by graphic designers and type
    design, and focus on typography.\r\n\r\nIf you are speaking with visual aids (Powerpoint?),
    you can demonstrate how a typographer can change the appearance of a page by altering
    the basic typographic parameters: typeface, size, leading, and paragraph style.\r\n\r\nThat
    way, your expertise in speaking and presenting will be demonstrated in the way
    that you strike a balance between what you say about the images, and the text
    that you have written for the descriptive captions in the images.\r\n\r\nIt does
    seem to me that you should be using images in your talk, as the subject is visual.
    However, if it\u2019s just talking, you could discuss a non-visual aspect of contemporary
    typography, such as the change that was brought about by digitization; the \u201Chow
    it\u2019s done\u201D in this case would be the emergence of the independent foundry
