<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi! I've just finished my typeface Arrival, designed for signs. It has three variants: Normal, Normal Italic and Extrabold.

<div class=commentbody> Keith, <br> <br>Hey there I've not seen your posts before. Welcome from a fellow Reading Grad! Did you just finish then? Are you going to ATypI? <br> <br>I disagree with Milan. I see more of a meta-esqueness in it. I also think the eversoslight stroke modulation is very nice. Will you make more weights? It made me smile to see an extrabold. Seems like most people put this off until they've finished all the other weights. I'm downloading the PDF so I'll have to read this before I can make more comments. <br> <br> <br>Tiffany </div>

<div class=commentbody> Hi there Tiffany, it's nice to see someone from Reading too! No, I haven't finished yet. I'm in the process of writing my 10,000-word dissertation! You might be interested to know, it's on the influce of calligraphic writing on the development of sanserif type. Well, only 7,000 more words to go now! Hey, thanks for your comments! Waiting to hear more from you! <br> <br>Keith </div>

<div class=commentbody>I haven't looked at the PDF yet, but from the Flash views I'd say it's a nice, solid humanist sans. The problem is we have so many of those now, it's hard to appreciate! :-/ The good news is that your flares (although I don't see how they might promote "clarity of reading from a distance") do give the design some subtle originality. And the Heavy has a nice presence. <br> <br>For signage I presume this needs to be conservative, but for the retail market you might consider putting some funkiness in it, somehow. A good example of what I'm talking about is FF Profile. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Nice clean site. <br> <br>I'll have to check out the PDF later: I think your server crashed from all the simultaneous downloads! :-/ <br> <br>BTW, the loose spacing seems to be right on (for highway signage), partly from what I've gathered from James Montalbano.

<div class=commentbody>Thanks, Hrant. Yes, Michail is a good friend of mine. We studied together at Reading. He's an excellent calligrapher, and his type really shows. <br> <br>I'm afraid the text version of Arrival still won't be very funky. It will be a good serviceable humanist sans (yet another, I know.). Quirkiness will come later with my DG Sans... even more calligraphic (a sans version of Albertus?). <br> <br>I'll definitely try to go to TypeCon this year... <br> <br>K.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Some quick observations from the PDF: <br>1. The italic angle seems jittery. <br>2. I'm liking the Black more and more, especially in all-caps. <br>3. The spacing seems uneven in places. <br>4. The roman lc "s" seems malformed to me. <br>5. Love the [primary] italic lc "a"! <br>6. Love the Euro. <br>7. UC accents too high. <br>8. Cedilla too cramped/dark. <br> <br>The "process" part looks very interesting - I'll be perusing that soon! <br> <br>Keep this up, eh? :-) <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>M Carter made a slew of Latinized Greeks in the 70s via Linotype, at the sorry-arse request for such culturally degenerative designs by certain Greek news designers. He rightfully had an allergic reaction to this process, and made Cadmus, and unconventional but in a way culturally authentic (at least "lapidarily") design. About 20 years later he made Skia, which is in effect a Hellenized Latin font: <br><a href=http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/cadmuskia.gif target=_blank>http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/cadmuskia.gif</a> <br> <br>Michail's email: <a href=mailto:msemoglou@operamail.com>msemoglou@operamail.com</a> <br>BTW, a few months ago this place was full <br>of Greeks - maybe they're still lurking? <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Thank you so much, Hrant! <br>I loved Skia since my old Mac and its System 7.5 and I'm sorry its advanced features are built in just as a Quickdraw GX face. Do you know if someone translated in in Type1, OpenType or something? <br>Cadmus is too wide. A bit narrower and it could be the perfect greek counterpart to the recent Skia. Do you know if Cadmus has a digital version or if Carter is intentioned to work again on Skia. Is Skia still a property of Apple? <br> <br>What do you mean by "culturally degenerative designs"? Something like bastard and dull roman fonts designed on the wave of advertising urge from the 1960s onwards we have for latin?</div>

<div class=commentbody>After looking through your PDF and printing it to my <i>completely</i> undeserving and lowly hp posing as an inkjet. Being extra sensitive to the letter w, I love the fact that yours works. I think this is one character that usually looks frumpy and out of place in other sans types that are trying to maintain constraint. The dot over the i and j, only looked big on my monitor and the remark was supposed to be tongue in cheek, but instead it came across more foot in mouth. Very <i>very</i> nice work. Will there be a condensed version? <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Re. Cadmus: I agree that it is generally better than the heavily Latinised old Helvetica Greek, Baskerville, etc., but I still wouldn't describe it as authentically Greek. It is really a kind of 'what if?' historical fantasy, in which Matthew applies the fairly rigid geometry of early Attic inscriptions to a lowercase alphabet that did not exist at the time. It's interesting and in some respects successful (it doesn't suffer from the deadness and lack of rhythm of the Helvetica), but it is no more authentically Greek than the other types of this period. The straight <i>lambda,</i> the symetrical <i>chi</i> and <i>gamma</i>; the lack of descenders on <i>beta</i>, <i>zeta</i> and <i>ksi</i>; the monodirectional ascender on the <i>delta</i>: none of these are any more authentic to Greek than the serifs on the Baskerville. Perhaps Cadmus just seems more Greek because it is less obviously Latin? <br> <br>Anyway, sorry for the digression. Back to Arrival...</div>

<div class=commentbody>Congrats! <br> <br>Wait a second: don't they already "own" it? You made it while you were there, right? Since a nasty legal precedent a few years ago at Stanford, colleges have been very dog-eat-dog about this type of thing... <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Yes...the PDF is a beautiful presentation. <br> <br>I did notice that you have left and right facing directional arrows. May I suggest you add up and down, and, possibly, the 45 degree angles? I would those quite useful when creating signage. (but maybe that's best left for an Arrival Dingbats face...)</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yes, I did design it when I was there, but it's Reading... How can you teach type design without respecting a student's intellectual property?</div>
