  for iphone.\r\nThe logo comes to me 10 years ago while i was playing with this type
  of quotation mark  << blah >>\r\ni also found a name for the company wich have at
  least one quality: the domain name was free.\r\nSo i reworked the logo, because
  it had flows, i hope i have done most of the work\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/quotangel_6024.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/quotangel1b_6232.jpg]\r\n\r\nI'm
  not sure about color, and not sure this is the best typo.\r\n\r\nAny though ?"

  body: "a domain name being available is (IMO) one of the weakest reasons for selecting
    a name. Using QuotAngel as an example ... it conjurs images of \"quotation angels\"
    which (to me at least) makes no sense.\r\nSurely you can find a better name, and
    th edomain doesn't have to be the company name, it can be a related phrase, or
    unrealted phrase/word ... just make it memorable.\r\n\r\nAs for the mark ... it's
    got potential I particularly like the reference to programming - the core difference
    between games. In the examples you've provided the mark overshadows the text and
    won't work at realistic text sizes (for quotes etc.)\r\n\r\nWithout wanting to
    burst your bubble too much, I think you've approached the thing a bit arse about
    - i.e, developing identity/branding treatments without thinking the core message
    through.\r\n\r\n:)\r\n\r\nSo with all that said ... enlighten us, what's the company
    about?  what's on offer? what's it going to do? what difference will it make?
    who will it make a difference to? how will it communicate?\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br

  body: "In the company we are five, one designer/developper (me), one 3D specialist
    and better developper than me, one dialogue writer and humorist, tow specialist/writer
    of role playing game since they play every rpg/strategy game that existe starting
    with the table game more than 25 years ago. We will make first games for iphone.
    One of our goal is to buy a licence of a french comics, humoristic, sort of futuristic
    Improssible Mission with losers, and make some 3-4 hours episode of some adventure/rpg
    fun games we sell like 5$ each episode. but before that we have two other games
    i can't tell about (because it's someting new and exciting )except that they could
    need a lot of bandwith for live fight and we have the right partner for that.
    So right now technically speaking everything is going well. We will also have
    an gameplay advantage but cant tell about because of the patent process. Another
    thing, our main target i to gently make casual gamers come to the world of hardcore
    gamers, our games will\r\nbe progressive enough not to affraid casual gamers,
    and gently evolve for someting more evolved/hardcore trough a learning curve sytem.\r\n\r\nSo
    i have to find another name, but i love this logo i want to keep it. So i think
    i will call the others to make a brainstorming, i we need/want to the word 'angel'
    is needed or whatever, maybe 'flyingcoders' would be better, i just don't know.\r\n\r\nThe
    quotation mark thing is only for use in Title, big size (the text will be bigger
    and the quotation smaller and i don't think\r\nthe ending quote will be the logo,
    i think i'll snap the head, it's too much)\r\nright now this is the very beginning
    of the communication process and i think we will focus more on communicating about
    the games we will make than about the company's communication who will be more...
    i dont know (we have the knowledge and competence to do a 3D flash website it
    would be a shame not to do it for ourselve, but what's the story/message would
    be, again\r\ntoday i don't know)"

  body: I really like the mark. And the colour. It's clever how you can see the angel
    in the shape. I agree the name is a bit puzzling. I think the type may be fine
    for the logotype but I would choose something more readable for the rest of your
    communications/body text.

  body: Thanks Bendy, for the name i put there, it's over, bad idea, understand. We
    we'll do a brainstorming about that. I have another idea with a concept for the
    site, but i have to talk to our 3D specialist.

  body: "I don't get the name/concept either, but just wanted to say I'm in love with
    the selection of type for the logo. AUdimat, yeh? I've used that too, but this
    is probably the best usage of it I've seen. It seems to match the angel/quote
    mark perfectly.\r\nKeep us updated!"

  body: Dunno ... "this is how we will communicate messages" looks a bit .. err ..
    un-elegant and un-polished. I mean it in a sense that the same idea could be done
    better and more visually pleasing. Consider the "loading/busy" animation used
    in PS3 - that should be a design to beat IMO.

  body: "@altaira: wow, i'm blushing, Thanks :)) of course as soon as a name is define,
    i'll post it here\r\n\r\n@Ratbaggy: it's just a idea that pop in my minde, it
    looks like quote, let's try to use it to reinforce the brand, the more they see
    it the more they remember it. But it's maybe naive. i have made a new version
    with only quote and quote being a lot smaller, i think it's looks good, but the
    usage maybe improved.\r\n\r\n@epslicon: i agree, i shouldn't publish a first draft
    like that, i've made change. The loading/busy animation of ps3 is a round blurred
    thing right ?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "FINAL NAME\r\n\r\nin fact the basis of the logo (the angel) was made 10years
    ago, i've just arraged it recently.\r\nit's not the first time i'm trying to do
    something with this logo, and just before i had to stop\r\nworking because of
    health problems, with a friend we found a \xFCber cool name MODERN MADNESS\r\nbut
    the concept going with was a kinda \"Clockwork Orange\" concept wich was maybe
    not the best choice.\r\nso we choose to keep the name, but change the spirit behind.
    The new concept is base on the movie \"Brazil\"\r\n(if you know the movie - you
    should, it's a masterpiece - and remember the dreams of a flying man)\r\nand were
    working on a Flash site with realtime 3D of this flying man.\r\n\r\nBut this is
    the logo\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/momad_5689.jpg]"

  body: I'm going to add to the sentiment regarding the disconnect between the mark
    and the company name. I understand your explanation, but I think for a logo it's
    just too much of a stretch. For me, the meaning and intent of a logo should be
    pretty obvious, and this just isn't. And even if the intent is for the consumer
    to put some thought into divining its meaning, I feel that the payoff just isn't
    there.
