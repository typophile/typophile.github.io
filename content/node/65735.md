    you are allowed, according to the Vera font license, to make your own medium weight,
    as long as you don't call it Vera $SOMETHING. The Fontographer \"Blend Fonts\"
    feature comes in handy for that (use normal and bold weight). Check your Vera
    license to see exactly what you are allowed to (IANAL). Andreas"

    and share it back with the world! :-)\r\nThat said, you can try to obtain a \"medium\"
    look just adding a thin stroke to the regular weight using the desktop publishing
    app of your choice."

  body: "Historically Prima was to have been Netscape's answer to Verdana.  Also noteworthy,
    the Vera hinting was downgraded from that in the original font.  \r\n\r\nI've
    no idea what if anything Gnome paid for the fonts, although the positioning suggests
    that Gnome is donating them to the OS cause, rather than Bitstream, just as Red
    Hat and Google get credit for Liberation and Droid, rather than Ascender. \r\n"

  body: "@sii and Gerry K,\r\n\r\nThanks for the info. Interesting.\r\n\r\nAs far
    as credit - I would suppose, them's who paid to make the font or bought the rights,
    get the right to decide on licensing and labeling.\r\nI like Droid a lot.\r\nLiberation,
    Red Hat should send back to Ascender so they can finish up the kerning and hinting.
    (Not a big fan of that one. At least Liberation Serif haven't looked carefully
    at Sans.)"

    to be a metric replacement for Times New Roman - which means you're kind of stuck
    with TNR's metrics. Re the hinting most (all?) Linux distros avoid using hints
    due the Apple patents - maybe when they expire things will be different."
