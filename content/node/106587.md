  body: Oblik Classic comes very close (the Gs don't match and some of the letters
    aren't as rounded as your sample), but not quite. Check it out on myfonts.com

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PeignotDemiModified_4826.jpg]\r\nHere
    are your letters in the lower case of Peignot Demi -- a font designed in 1937
    by A.M. Cassandre with Charles Peignot for Deberny & Peignot -- with the ascenders
    on l, k and h clipped to the x height; the base stroke on the l extended to match
    the base stroke on the e; the spur on the g raised to the baseline; and all letters
    widened 120%.\r\nCassandre's \"space age\" design would do the job.\r\nDon"
