    when I was very young, noticing that a typeset double-storeyed lc &#34;a&#34;
    and &#34;g&#34; looked quite different from the handwritten single-storeyed &#34;a&#34;
    and &#34;g&#34; that I had been taught to write in school. Further, I could recognize
    either instantly as the letters they represented. This realization might have
    been a sign of the first inklings of my developing love of type. <BR> <BR>To answer
    the question, the &#34;Emigr&eacute;&#34; standard of familiarity &#40;&#34;We

    part of the answer, in any case. <BR> <BR>Consider the old-style &#34;long s&#34;

  body: 'This is not a great topic. This is &#42;THE&#42; topic. <BR>To me it&#39;s
    really the foundation of typography. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve thought about this myself
    for a while, and it&#39;s actually part of what motivated my Alphabet Reform work.
    One thing to not lose sight of here is that writing and reading are separate things,
    especially these days when we read typeset text almost exclusively. For example,
    David&#39;s example of the &#34;D&#34; is actually very telling! It&#39;s a very
    ambiguous letter, not least because efficient writing makes its corners softer,
    as a result making &#42;reading&#42; harder; look at the &#34;D&#34; in OCR-B
    for an effort to counter this ambiguity&#42;. BTW, amazing but true: many Japanese
    people actually put a crossbar on the stem of the &#34;D&#34; when writing in
    English, specifically to disambiguate it! And I can bring many other examples
    of how writing has reduced readability. <BR> <BR>&#42; http://www.myfonts.com/CharacterInStyle0044-62668.html
    <BR> <BR>Familiarity is one of the two foundations of reading. But it&#39;s just
    as misunderstood &#40;or actually, just as ignored&#41; as the other foundation:
    human physiology. It doesn&#39;t matter how familiar you are with the UC &#34;I&#34;,
    lc &#34;el&#34; and numeral &#34;1&#34;, they&#39;re &#42;still&#42; unnecessarily
    ambiguous. And it&#39;s not just a matter of the type design making them less
    ambiguous - they have a &#42;structural&#42; problem. On top of all this, there&#39;s
    the fact that we &#91;generally&#93; read boumas &#40;word shapes&#41; as opposed
    to individual letters. <BR> <BR>&#34;Essence&#34; is a great word to use, even
    though it might erroneously convey that the letters have a static nature. The
    truth is, the essence of a letter is different for each one of us, depending on
    our personal realities, and it even changes over time! The main thing to realize
    about the essence is that it depends on what&#39;s been called &#34;acrocratic&#34;
    features, or features that stand out and differentiate each character. For example,
    the UC &#34;Q&#34;&#39;s acrocratic feature is its tail. When a letter has weak
    acrocracy &#40;like the &#34;P&#34;, specifically with respect to the &#34;B&#34;
    and &#34;R&#34;&#41; then it&#39;s less decipherable. <BR> <BR>The issues of gender
    is another &#42;very&#42; interesting topic &#40;at least to me&#41; - although
    I&#39;m not sure how deep its relevance is in decipherment/reading. <BR> <BR>BTW,
    here&#39;s a shameless plug: <BR>I&#39;ve tried to deal with these issues in some
    depth in my article &#40;called &#34;Improving the Tool&#34;&#41; in a recent
    book called Graphic Design &amp; Reading, edited by Gunnar Swanson: <BR> <BR><A

    &#34;Well, now, look, Dr. Johnson, I may be as thick as a whale omelette, but

    - I know it&#39;s not exactly the right metaphor - but it seems to me like trying

    there could be a reductionist, engineering specification for each letter, but

    is probably a good term here, I don&#39;t think we&#39;re on the same wavelength
    otherwise. I can&#39;t be sure about anybody else, but what I myself have in mind
    I think can be very useful for anybody interested in pushing the boundaries of
    type, as opposed to just churning out variations on the conventional theme - a
    senile theme. <BR> <BR>If we can define &#40;not necessarily absolutely, but just
    as much as possible&#41; for a given writing system what makes each of its characters
    decipherable &#40;note: in the context of the whole&#41;, and more importantly
    &#40;at least for a text face&#41; what makes each character contribute to the
    decipherability of boumas, then we&#39;ve created some firm ground to walk on:
    we can push the structure -and subsequently the finish- of each character to the
    limit &#40;not that this limit is static, though&#41;. This approach is the main
    guidepost of my Alphabet Reform efforts. <BR> <BR>Let me try to give a quick,
    specific example: <BR>As much as I like Tarzana&#42; overall, its UC &#34;Q&#34;
    is flawed, because the tail seems part of the left curve, instead of being independent.
    By ignoring the acrocracy of the tail of the &#34;Q&#34;, Licko pushed too far,
    or more accurately, in the wrong direction. <BR> <BR>&#42; <A HREF="http://www.emigre.com/dp/getfontpage.php?PTarNR.html"

    foundation for creating good fonts is the understanding of each character&#39;s

  body: ' As much as I agree with and admire Hrant&#39;s arguments on the subject
    of readability &#40;and I think Hrant would agree with this&#41;, I&#39;m pretty
    sure that readability is only a part of the equation. <BR> <BR>Similarly, Martin&#39;s
    analogy from Black Adder &#40;which I also love <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":&#41;"> &#41; is flawed for almost the same reason. George&#39;s problem
    was in his definition of &#34;book&#34;. A book CAN be a narrative, with a hero,
    plot, conflict, etc., but that is not the ENTIRE definition of the word book.
    A book can also be a book of reference &#40;as a dictionary&#41;, a book of stamps
    or even a bankbook. <BR> <BR>Similarly, readability is not the only element of
    typography or design. It is an important element in many &#40;perhaps even most&#41;
    contexts, but it is not the only consideration -- and may not even be the most
    important consideration. <BR> <BR>If we learned anything from the grunge and deconstructionist
    experiments of the &#39;80s and &#39;90s, it is that very good typography, design
    and letterforms can be not very readable at all -- and still be considered &#34;good&#34;
    or successful solutions. It all depends upon the context and even more, on the
    design problems that are to be addressed. <BR> <BR>The point of my previous post
    is that MANY things influenced the letterforms we have today: language, phonics,
    iconography/symbology, tools of writing, writing surface, community education,
    vernacular, popularity/familiarity, printing technology, style, experimentation,
    and yes, readability. I have probably left a few out of my list as well. <BR>
    <BR>We may be getting a bit off-topic, however; as I interpreted Spiral&#39;s
    original question, it was &#34;What is the essence of a letterform?&#34; In other
    words, why do we recognize an &#39;a&#39; as that letter, and not as a stunted
    &#34;d&#34; or &#34;q&#34;, for example? <BR> <BR>I think Hrant is on to something
    when he mentions boumas &#40;the gestalt of word contours&#41;, but again, I think
    that is only part of the answer. If that were the whole answer, I suspect that
    our alphabet might have shed all of its counters centuries ago, relying instead
    only on outlines of words. Or, perhaps, individual letter glyphs might have been
    dropped long before typwriters or even typesetting made them a now-necessary staple,
    and we would have instead evolved toward a system not unlike Chinese or Japanese
    pictoglyphs. But of course we haven&#39;t, and we manage to recognize varied forms
    of the same intended letter glyphs just fine, thank you very much. Spiral&#39;s
    question is, if I read her question correctly: why? '

  body: ' &#62; readability is only a part of the equation. <BR> <BR>Well, yes, I
    do agree. And I don&#39;t think the essence of a letter is restricted to some
    dry skeleton that one might be tempted to draw. For one thing, I might expound
    on what Phil wrote and say that many letters might have actual physical associations
    &#40;noting that humans &#42;are&#42; physical beings who live in Nature, after
    all&#41; - and these associations tie in to the essence. But how much of that
    pertains directly to decipherment, a very low-level function of the human mind?
    I think some of it does, but it&#39;s very hard to grasp things buried so deeply.
    Not to mention this bummer of a philosophical truth: &#34;A system can never understand
    itself.&#34; <BR> <BR>BTW, Alfred Kallir has a book called &#34;Sign and Design&#34;
    where he explains how the Latin alphabet as a whole and each letter in particular
    are derived directly from our psychosexual reality! He refutes the classic &#34;A
    = Ox&#34; bullshit &#40;pun intended :-&#41;, and although his premise might sound
    far-fetched, many of the points he makes have the unmistakable smell of truth
    to them. <BR> <BR>In focusing on readability I was trying address one -important-
    aspect Spiral&#39;s question, and to me it&#39;s important because it&#39;s possible
    to improve the Latin alphabet &#40;or any other writing system&#41;, &#42;if&#42;
    you first understand how the thing really works! <BR> <BR>&#62; If &#91;boumas&#93;
    were the whole answer, I suspect that our alphabet might have shed all of its
    counters centuries ago, relying instead only on outlines of words. Or, perhaps,
    .... <BR> <BR>Well, just because these things didn&#39;t happen doesn&#39;t mean
    that they &#42;shouldn&#39;t&#42; have, and it also doesn&#39;t mean such things
    shouldn&#39;t happen in the &#42;future&#42;. Social inertia is always a thing
    to consider, and very often to fight against. <BR> <BR>&#62; we manage to recognize
    varied forms of the same intended letter glyphs just fine <BR> <BR>In the same
    way that I managed to live out my adolescence in Beirut with electrical current
    only about half the time?  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>The deeper functionalities of writing
    are hidden from casual observation - and this is directly related to the difference
    between legibility and readability. Furthermore, the reason change is slow/difficult
    is largely because it&#39;s hard to convince people something needs improving
    when that thing is virtually invisible. <BR> <BR>&#62; Spiral&#39;s question is,
    if I read her question correctly: why?  <BR> <BR>I think you lost me. <BR> <BR>hhp '
