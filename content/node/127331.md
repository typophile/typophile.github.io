body: "I'm trying to find out what fonts are in this printed military dispatch stationery,
  especially words in the fill-in lines \"Hd. Qrs.\", \"o'clock\", \"M.\", \"186\",
  \"To\" and \"No\". \r\n\r\nI have searched through hundreds of script fonts but
  none of them have that capital \"H\", \"M\" nor \"N\" or even that lower case \"d\".
  \r\n\r\nIt actually doesn't look like a cursive font as the letters seem very upright.
  It's a really interesting and different looking script font. I wonder where these
  were printed, or if the fonts in printed dispatch stationeries varied depending
  on the print.\r\n\r\nThanks for any help."
