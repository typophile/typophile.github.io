  body: It would be good if the title of your post was more specific. I say this for
    many reasons, but the reason you might want to consider it most is that you might
    get more traffic.

  body: It would be interesting to see the results of the survey when it is completed.
    Have you surveyed people outside of the typography and graphic design community?
    I wonder how their responses would differ.

  body: "thanks for all the responses,\r\n\r\ni am in the process of writing this
    up at the minute, so please no more questionaires.  in response to cumaso, yes
    i am conducting a wider range as possible with my survey.\r\n\r\nso far it seems
    that fruitiger and meta are considered very masculine, and plain with caslon and
    garamond are seen as distinctly feminine, traditional and fancy.\r\n\r\nthe light
    weight helvetica is considered to be much more feminine, warm than the bold.\r\n\r\ninterestingly
    it also seems that none of the fonts register as being eithe rhappy or sad.\r\n\r\nthanks
    for all your responses, i will keep this updated with my findings."
