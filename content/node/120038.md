  body: "Font Bureau came out with a typeface called Type Writer in 1990/1991; this
    appears to match. Thanks to frequent poster Fivos and FindMyFont for the ID:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FB_TypeWriter_5740.png]\r\n\r\nHowever,
    it is no longer commercially available:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/94299\r\n\r\nThe
    post referenced above suggests a few options, the closest of which is Passport:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/coniglio/passport/"

    of the site.\r\nAt the bottom of each font-preview page there is a \"Link to this
    page\" URL you can copy & paste here, which preserves the preview text and any
    formatting options. \r\nExample for this specific font you mentioned:\r\nhttp://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=Font-Bureau%20%2F%20%28Commercial%29&ffam=TypeWriter%20-%20Roman%20Cnd&fid=34e6a2b032399919869c4ae53aad4677&fsize=60&text=CRISTOBAL&wrap=2"
