body: "The beloved past president of Photo-Lettering Inc. and co-founder of ITC, 101-year-old
  Ed Rondthaler, is featured in a series of television and print ads for Genworth
  Financial. I was half paying attention to MSNBC tonight when I heard Ed's unmistakeable
  voice and looked up in time to catch the commercial. The TV spot is beautifully
  filmed, and offers a glimpse of Ed in his home and his little town. It shows his
  mailbox, too, which sports some nifty lettering.\r\n\r\nThe campaign is available
  on the web at http://onehundred.genworth.com/. After load, click on the book in
  the lower nav, adjacent to the text that reads, \"The Genworth Story.\" Once the
  virtual book opens to the index, click on the link at the bottom: \"See Our Centenarian
  Advertising Campaign.\" The pages will flip to the campaign. Click the third thumbnail
  in the top row to play Ed's TV spot. His print ad is second from the left on the
  bottom row.\r\n\r\nSeeing Ed on TV was really cool! Mainstream TV viewers may not
  know about his role in the type community and his efforts with the American Literacy
  Council, but it's lovely to see him recognized as the special person he is.\r\n\r\nEd
