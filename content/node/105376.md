  in from [[http://typophile.com/node/104961|last post\u2019s survey]] on what I should
  pay for [[http://practicaltypography.com/|<em>Butterick\u2019s Practical Typography</em>]].\r\n<!--break-->\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/surveymonkeyresults_6736.png]\r\n\r\nI\u2019m
  not sure what the results do to inform the discussion around reader-supported web
  publishing endeavors but here are a few of my own thoughts on this little experiment:\r\n\r\n1.
  Most Typophile readers are not interested in what I pay for <em>Practical Typography</em>.
  \ \r\n2 . Very few people actually read this blog. OK, maybe a few more than 16,
  but definitely not more than 23.\r\n3. My 150+ Twitter followers have failed me.
  Can one \u201Cfail\u201D at Twitter?\r\n4. Anyone with a decent Klout ranking wouldn\u2019t
  touch this one with a ten-foot ascender. I can\u2019t blame them. \r\n5. Maybe this
  was a silly idea. \r\n6. I should probably go back to, you know, <em>designing stuff</em>
  and <em>teaching other people how to design stuff</em>.\r\n7. I just paid $7.50
  to take my kid to a local children\u2019s museum. <em>He spent the whole time playing
  with a train set we already have at home</em>. \r\n8. $7.50 is a respectable payment
  for <em>Practical Typography</em>. \r\nI think. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/practicaltypographypayment_5831.png]"
