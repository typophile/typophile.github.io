  body: I'd say custom, probably by [[http://www.ceveritt.com/|Caleb Owen Everitt]].
    You could find a closer look on [[http://www.hufnagelcycles.com/images/logo_2.gif|Hufnagel's
    website]]. Should try to find some similars...

  body: Couldn't find anything enough similar... Hard to classify. It mixes tuscan,
    latin, slab and athletic/geometric/college/octogonal influences... May be "geometric
    tuscan"... I would probably start with something like [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/brothers/regular-alternates//|Brothers
    Alternate]], moving out/inward some junction points of serifs and adding a (big)
    outline stroke to make it thiner...
