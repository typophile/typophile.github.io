body: Can anyone recommend a functional book holder (that does not damage books)?
  Something like <a href="http://www.amazon.de/Bookchair-Standard-Schwarz/dp/190510703X/ref=pd_sim_sbs_k_4">this</a>?
  Alternatives to the ones, that are available from Amazon? Available in Germany?

    shipping to Germany, though.

  body: "Thanks, James!\r\n\r\nI found a manufacturer, who is specialized on book
    stands: \"http://bookstandworld.net/\". But he is in the USA. The relation betweeen
    shipping costs and costs of the stands may be okay. But I think, the stands are
    a bit too exclusive for my needs. (I did not check all prices.) Maybe I am going
    to build one by myself."
