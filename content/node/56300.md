  body: I don't know the answer, but something in my brain tells me that the fonts
    of the time were built on something like a 13x9 or 14x9 grid. I remember having
    an old Hercules card that let you edit the fonts, one pixel at a time. Great way
    to waste a few hours.

    typesetting on an AM VariTyper -- some 10 years later -- and actually never knew
    its \"resolution\". I *do* know a few tricks you could do with it: overflash,
    to make type appear bolder, and super-sizing, right until the edges grew blurry
    and the outer parts were chopped off.\r\n\r\nAh now I remember -- that was one
    machine later. For its precursor (and the very first thing I had ta do in the
    studio), I had to manually change the wheel containing (film) negatives of fonts
    [*]. No resolution needed, it scaled fonts by moving the wheel back and forth.\r\n\r\n[*]
    One font per wheel. First, insert disk labeled \"Roman\" and image a page (or
    rather, a strip of type). Remove disk, insert \"Italic\", re-program computer
    and image italic text. Repeat with other required fonts until bored to death or
    making a mistake."

  body: "The Linotron 202 was about 960 lines per inch. Early imagesetters for PostScript
    fonts were frequently used at 1200 dpi, given our experience with the 202, we
    ran our Birmy imagesetter at 1,000 dpi (for type only). \r\n\r\nThe 2,400 and
    3,600 dpi output you see today are only needed because images and type are in
    the same file. And worse, you can't \"increase the exposure\" today, because that
    would translate into greater dotgain for the images. With the older techonologies,
    like the 202, we'd increase the exposure when setting a font with fine lines (like
    Perpetua), and decrease it with a front that didn't have fine lines. The overall
    weight of the font depended on things other than it's design, namely the exposure
    when output, the development used for the repro paper, the exposure when the negative
    was made, less on the development of the negative, but again, the exposure when
    the plate was made.\r\n\r\nSort of hard to compare. . ."

  body: "Theunis,\r\n\r\nSort of off-topic, but I too began computer comp on an AM-Varityper
    -- the CompSet. Our machine used disks that (standard) had four fonts on them.
    But we also had AM make us up custom font disks, all ligatures, all the small
    caps, etc. on one disk. I'd make them redraw a few characters to boot. That took
    us down to roman & italic on one font. It was also a bit pricy; we had custom
    disks for Times Roman and Sabon. Plus later, a pretty good Galliard. These were
    Monotype masters, and both the Times and Sabon were quite nice.\r\n\r\nThe ComSet
    had a one-line buffer. Once you set a line of type, it was gone. You could see
    approximately the next line. If, one line yet later in a paragraph, you came on
    a line ending with an unbreakable word (\"strength\" \"women\" etc.), you were
    going to run the chapter out again. In fact, that was the normal way of working.
    You set and ran out a chapter, then marked up the repro so that when you set it
    the next time, you had accounted for all the problems. You absolutely had to guess
    right about how things were going to fit, or you had to run it out a third time.
    Repro paper wasn't cheap; errors were costly.\r\n\r\nWhen the compEdit came along,
    it had a buffer. You could set a whole paragraph before sending it off. Thought
    I'd gone to heaven. It also had \"reverse feed\", which made setting display equations
    much easier. I use to set them using tabs, and that was a bitch when a line was
    gone as soon as you set it.\r\n\r\nThe plus to the Varityper equipment was (1)
    it didn't break so much, and (2) the measure stayed pretty constant. I'm not sure
    \"measure\" was a recognizable term for the VIP -- or the 202, for that matter.
    When we ran corrections on a job with a 202, we'd run off a couple test lines,
    so as to keep the \"measure\" to within 3 points of the original. Ah, the wanderings
    of horizontal amplifiers . . .\r\n\r\nThe early days of photocomp weren't much
    different than metal in terms of operator skill needed for good quality work.
    But there were no heavy trays of metal, probably the most important thing in getting
    women into the composing room. Health issues changed too, no lead, but I know
    a number of comps who spent long days at those early terminals who now have lymphoma.\r\n\r\nBut
    all this is off the topic . . ."

  body: "Charles \u2013\r\n\r\nThere was definitely a difference in output quality
    on a Linotronic between 1200dpi and 2400dpi, at least if you were using ITC Garamond
    (an unfortunately common text face in those days). That wasn't the only typeface
    where you could see a difference, but it was the one I used as a benchmark, because
    it was so obvious. At 1200dpi, the strokes just looked anemic.\r\n\r\nYou remind
    me of when I would send files to a service bureau for output, and for certain
    typefaces I would ask them to boost the density. One shop was great for images
    but not so good for text; another gave me good strong density for text-only output,
    which was most of what I was doing. I would never have used digital Centaur for
    one book if I hadn't been getting it output to RC paper and had the option of
    asking for higher density; otherwise, the digital font isn't strong enough. \r\n\r\nBut
    the Linotron 202 wasn't introduced until 1978, so that doesn't really answer the
    original question.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fonthaus.com/xheight/linotype.cfm\r\n\r\nJohn\r\n"

  body: "I don't know if it is available online, but Dick Angstadt (Keystone Typesetting)
    and I had a longish discussion on this in <cite>The Glossary of Typesetting Terms</cite>
    under *Output Resolution*. I'm not going to type in the whole page+, but after
    I'd talked about adjusting the exposure with the 202, Dick said \"Many imagesetter
    fonts have been designed to perfectly match metal type fonts without compensating
    for the slight spread of the ink when the characters were printed letterpress.
    At very high resolution, these fonts appear too thin when printed by lithographic
    process. Outputting at a lower resolution (about 1,200 dpi) helps these fonts
    regain some of their original character.\"\r\n\r\nI agreed, and added \"A similar
    effect [gaining density through exposure] can be achieved with imagesetters. For
    example, when Monotype Bembo was released in PostScript form, it appeared too
    thin at small sizes. We experimented with different output resolutions --  1,200
    dpi, 900 dpi, and 600 dpi -- on a Linotron 200 imagesetter and with different
    exposures at each resolution. we found that increasing the exposure at a 1,200
    setting produced a more usable image than simply lowering the resolution setting
    . . .\"\r\n\r\nSo yes, if you are trying to reproduce *the font as drawn*, higher
    resolution is better. But if the drawing is wrong (as so many are), it's the wrong
    way to go after a certain resolution is reached -- about 1,200 dpi, in my testing.
    BTW, when we went to a DTP workflow, even a font like Scala needed an increase
    of 2/1000 in character weight to match what was printed with repro-negative-plate
    workflows. And of course, if Majoor was paying attention to what was *printed*
    when he drew the font, he designed Scala when repro-negative-plate was the dominant
    workflow.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nOur 202 had a plate inside the doors which gave
    a date of sometime in the 1960s, but maybe that was just for the computer part.
    At any rate, the 505 and 202 (I never knew much about the 303) were the first
    photocomp machines I knew of that used a video tube to expose the paper. The ones
    before these that I'm familiar with used a projection system. Not to say there
    wasn't one."
