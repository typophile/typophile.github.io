  body: I was bummed that there were multiple tracks. I chose to stick to the main
    track in the big hall and catch the talks from the smaller hall on video (though
    they don't seem to be available yet). I enjoyed nearly all the talks I saw (I'd
    rather not mention the exception, except to say that one was not as interesting
    as I'd hoped). I liked that it had a broader focus than just type and fonts. But
    my favorite thing about conferences like this is seeing and talking to old friends
    and meeting new people. As always, there were some people I wanted to meet but
    missed the opportunity. There's always the next one.

    I will probably remember most is that the part of San Francisco where the conference
    was held has such beautiful buildings, old and new, but so many mentally ill people
    (and not just sketchy) on the streets\u2014mingling with everybody else going
    about their business."

  body: "I was unhappy that I missed pretty much half the talks I had paid to see
    simply because the rooms were too small.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed everything I saw and
    heard, and was very gratified that Typo/FSI staff promised that everything would
    be up on video, although I'm still waiting for that to happen.\r\n\r\nThe BBC
    presentation was interesting, Bierut was as always, and Jim Parkinson was amusing.
    Good to see lots of old friendly acquaintances like Nick and Mark and the San
    Francisco crew.\r\n\r\nYours\r\n\r\nJoshua"

  body: "Too bad the second venue was so small, I didn't get to see Yves or anyone
    else there. I was happy to see Tiffany, Miguel, Paul, Jill, Petra, Yves, Mark,
    and Nick again and met a few new young designers.  I missed the Punchcut guys
    and saw others from afar.\r\nI found the presentations entertaining but did not
    learn much.  Sure wish there were more talks about type and less \"This is me\"
    show and tell.  I love San Francisco, crazy people and all :-)"

    Roth-Eisenberg</a> (a.k.a. Swiss Miss)\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://typotalks.com/blog/2012/04/27/joshua-davis-finish-of-day-one/\">Joshua
    Davis</a>\r\n\r\nBoth of these were great. I confess that I hadn't heard of Joshua
    Davis since the early 2000s when I was enamored by Flash. He was one of the \"experimental\"
    Flash guys.\r\n\r\nI was hoping that the talks that were on the secondary track
    in the smaller venue would be available later online, but it looks like they are
    only making the most popular talks available, the ones that were streamed live
    at the event."

    Mike Montiero's talk, about "bad" clients</a>, which was great, but a little jarring
    to see immediately after Neville Brody's talk.

  body: "One thing that really bothered me: I had looked forward very much to Koi
    Vinh's talk, after being a fan of his work for some time. But I don't like paying
    money - a pretty good amount of money - just to sit through a product pitch. After
    Spiekermann's great introduction (which was, unfortunately, the high point of
    that session), we got one long commercial for a toy product Vinh has created,
    which apparently - like so many other toys - promises to help us be creative,
    or something; I'm not really sure.\r\n\r\nI was and still am pretty offended by
    the fact that the organizers allowed him to blatantly pitch something that had
    nothing whatsoever to do with typography or much else for 45 minutes to people
    who really should have been paid for sitting through the commercial. It was completely
    and utterly out of place and the opposite of what conferences like this should
    be about.\r\n\r\nVinh could have talked about so much more - his time at NYT,
    his pioneering work with CMSes and grid-based css layouts, his thoughts on the
    future of online news, readability ... but instead of telling people about what
    anyone who is familiar with him would have wanted to hear, he tried to sell us
    on a toy that really has no bearing whatsoever on our businesses, careers, trades
    and/or (for most of us, I'll bet) our interests or hobbies."
