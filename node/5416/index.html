I created my own Thread by now in which you could give your Critique to the BlackPearl   ;-)
Sorry for Hi-Jacking this Thread ( I really like the Adam-Font ... think it's far better than my Bastarda, although they are quite different )

Here's the new BlackPearl Thread : http://typophile.com/node/15888

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, the Village Hebrew type you mentioned above is <a href="http://www.vllg.com/Thirstype/Kaas/mudTyper+Weights/">Kaas</a>. It isn't really a Hebrew typeface per se, rather a big OpenType font with Hebrew characters in it as well. Most of the glyphs are Latin. All in all, I like [[Kaas]]. Maybe you'd like to discuss it in an additional thread? I'd like to keep this on track, mainly because Paul had better finish <strong>Adam</strong> as soon as possible if he knows what's good for him ;-)

[moderator's message]I'd like to encourage everyone to keep talking about <strong>Black Pearl</strong> as well—but please, in its own thread. You can go there via <a href="http://typophile.com/node/15888">this link</a>![/moderator's message]</div>

BTW, in another thread I said that a Hebrew blackletter was a good,
needed thing, but I thought you said it was "insulting" or something.

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, I assume that [[Kaas]] is being primarially marketed to Latin users and as a Latin typeface. Inasmuch, it isn't a "Hebrew" typeface, per se. Although I'm sure that you can set excellent Hebrew display strings with it (disclaimer, I cannot weigh in pro or against the design of these Hebrew glyphs. I know too little about the writing system :-(  ).

It is just like I wouldn't call [[Helvetica Linotype]] a Hebrew typeface, even though John Hudson included Hebrew into its character set. Helvetica Linotype is a Latin face that can also set Greek, Cyrillic, Hebrew, and Arabic. Or maybe it is a global face that can set Latin (even Vietnamese!), Greek, Cyrillic, Hebrew, and Arabic. But the main focus & audience of the font isn't Hebrew (disclaimer, I cannot weigh in pro or against the design of these Hebrew glyphs. I know too little about the writing system :-(  ).

Yes, I must have posted somewhere that I find the idea of Hebrew blackletter distasteful. I love Blackletter, and I love Hebrew, but I wouldn't ever mix the two, personally. Maybe there is someone who can pull that off—maybe Kaas does it—but the "idea" just doesn't sit well with me. I'd rather not go there.</div>

To each their own I guess, but if blackletter was good enough for Gutenberg, who was jewish by the looks of things, why so squeemish? </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I don't see how the idea of "primarily" (<cite>especially</cite> in terms of marketing) is useful here. Nour & Patria is meant as a "multi-balanced" system for both scripts (which I would argue is the ideal), and it's marketed (well, maybe not yet) to whoever wants to use whichever of its components (including the subordinates as stand-alones). Does that mean it's neither Armenian nor Latin?!  :-/

That said, maybe calling Kaas a "Hebrew typeface" can be
confusing; but really, that's just a terminological issue.
You can set blackletter Hebrew in it - that's what counts.

> the “idea” just doesn’t sit well with me.

Maybe that's why you're having a terminological gallstone? :-)
Maybe you even wish it didn't have Hebrew in it?
I hope the designer shows up.

Good morning!

Wow, I haven't ever heard this before. Can you point me to the scholarship that has lead you in this direction? That would be something for conspiracy theorists, all right…

…and here I thought all along that Gutenberg was so interested in making money from the Catholic Church because he had to face the harsh reality of having a Patrician father and commoner mother (both of who, I had also always assumed, were Catholics as well…), and therefore got to grow up in the midst of Mainzer aristocracy, without getting to be an aristocrat himself :(</div>
