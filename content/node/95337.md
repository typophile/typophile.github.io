  body: "The two images are the same typeface (from the same wine label). It's probably
    a design made for that wine label, and not a commercial font, although they might
    have had it made as a proprietary font. It's interesting that on [[http://www.mouchaowine.pt/|their
    website]] they use Trajan to display those brand names and descriptions, but that's
    not the same font as on the labels.\r\n\r\nYou might contact them directly (there's
    a contact button on their home page) and ask them for more information.\r\n\r\n
