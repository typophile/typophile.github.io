    York</a> is a peculiar specimen of early digital typography. It is one of the
    first to be developed specifically for the screen, so it has an unusually high
    x-height for an old style serif because it was <a href=\"http://www.kare.com/MakePortfolioPage.cgi?page=4\">designed
    as a bitmap</a> first. There isn't much like it, but, besides Times, it seems
    like <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/palatino_std_ot_virtual/\">Palatino</a>
    could have been a model for Bigelow and Holmes' outlines.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&story=World_Class_Cities.txt&sortOrder=Sort%20by%20Date&detail=medium\">Here's
    a great story</a> about the origin of New York and the other Mac \"city\" fonts."

    with the 1984 Mac. New York 14 was really good too. The later TrueType version
    of New York never did much for me, though.\r\n\r\nIn addition to Stephen's suggestions,
