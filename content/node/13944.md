  the text wil be squeezed into 3x5 cards.. vertically. \r\nSet in Garmond as everything
  for this company is.\r\nIs it appropriate to set the ingredients in Regular Garamond
  and the instructions in Italic? It looks a little off maybe, but I need to diferentiate
  between the two elements. Any advice would be appreciated.\r\n"

  body: "I would be inclined to keep the main text (i.e. the instructions) in the
    main style, Roman.\r\nThe you can do the ingredients in Italic or Condensed, or
    maybe in Regular or SemiBold at a slightly smaller size, which can also be effective."

  body: I like the hierarchy of the type the only thing I would investigate is increasing
    the leading on the ingredients and open the letterspacing on the titles.

  body: "Thanks folks...\r\nNick, I intend to take your suggestion to heart, however
    I think I should keep the company's products in big/small caps for the ingredients..\r\ntell
    me if you think these work together. Its set in 8point type... would 7points be
    too small?\r\nhttp://brendansheehan.com/recipe.jpg"

  body: "Overall, I like the hierarchy. Get rid of the two word spaces after a period.
    And make sure you never use them again. It's a bad typewriter-era habit.\r\n\r\nI
    agree with Nick about the all small caps. Using the regular caps to highlight
    the company's products doesn't feel consistent enough to me. It looks like an
    error to my eye. If you have to differentiate between generic and the company's
    ingredients, I'd go with something that's a variation applied thoroughly to the
    type. For this reason, small caps may not work for the ingredients (though otherwise
    I like it). A roman/italic contrast might be more appropriate. Roman/Bold might
    be suitable but the bold might throw the hierarchy of the page off. Or maybe I'm
    talking out of my ass. It might be subtle and obvious enough to get the job done.\r\n\r\nAs
    for the type size, try standing at your kitchen counter with a vegetable in one
    hand and a knife in the other, then turn your head and try to read the ingredients
    laying on the counter hands-free. But my gut tells me the smaller proportions
    of Garamond probably make 8 pt an iffy bet."

  body: Do you have the Garamond Premiere? If you could get away with using that for
    the text, you could use the "caption" cut to improve readability at 8 pt.
