  searching this but i wasn't too successful.\r\nHow long does it take to create a
  font.\r\nPlease specify the details like If it's a pro font or not and all the family
  members(i meant bold italic condensed extended?)\r\nPlease mention your profession
  also( if you are a full time graphic designer or just design fonts as a hobby)\r\nI
  know some have been playing with the software for years but have not made a font.
  Why is that so?\r\n"

    in a few hours)."
