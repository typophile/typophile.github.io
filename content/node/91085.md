  combination of letters: f and \xFC?\r\nThere seems to be a bunch of words in german
  language containing these. (Im do not speak the german language myself, but im working
  on a multi-language book at the moment and reacted when i saw it for the first time.)
  \r\n\r\nDoes anyone know if such a ligature exists? Or if not, perhaps why it doesn't?
  Just curious."
