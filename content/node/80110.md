body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nwhen I try to make Mac TrueType fonts out of FontLab, the diacritic
  letters get all mixed up. The standard alphabet stays where it belongs, but all
  the letters with umlauts are in strange slots. The unicodes for the letters are
  right, but something like the codepage or encoding settings must be wrong. I just
  can't figure out where and how to set them correctly. \r\n\r\nAttached is a picture
  of the prefernce settings the way I have them right now. Is there something in this
  panel that needs to be changed?\r\n\r\nAlso, does anyone know of a PDF or website
  where all the different FL settings are shown for producing any kind of font format
  out of FL? Something as nice as the KLTF documents on font naming.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any advice.\r\nHenning\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/settings_4630.jpg]"

    there is. The fine program of FinalCutExpress does not accept them properly. I

    handle fonts in a creative manner ;)\r\n\r\nI remember we had a case where a video

    table or what the letters actually looked like, but on what the letters usually
    should look like ;) Led to interesting results with custom icons in the place
    of unneeded glyphs ..."

  body: "\"Use following codepage for first 256 glyphs\" must be set to \"Do not reencode
    first 256 characters\". \r\n\r\nThis option remaps the Unicode codepoints of the
    Windows 1252 codepage to something else (in you case, MacOS Roman), which results
    in a font that is not fully Unicode-compliant. Settings other than \"Do not reencode\"
    in this option are only for users who need to make custom-encoded TrueType fonts
    that should work with VERY old non-Unicode applications (such as, say, Adobe PageMaker
    6.5 or Illustrator 7). \r\n\r\nA.\r\n"

  body: Adam, doesn't this suggest that this option is better hidden if not removed
    in a future FLS version? Since making non-OT/TT fonts has almost become an exception,
    this "dangerous" option is presented in a too prominent way in FLS5, being number
    one on this FontInfo page. Same for the option that follows -- generating a Mac-specific
    cmap subtable may be unnecessary already. Perhaps put both into a box whose interface
    elements can be deactivated with a checkbox (which should be the default) ...

    target="_blank">FLS5 manual</a> is pretty detailed and offers background information
    too. Settings in Font Info and Preferences for font export depend much on what
    kind of font you are about to make, hard to summarize in a simple how-to.
