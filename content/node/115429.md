  body: "Hi Johan, re your comment \"Strange no-one has found it! :)\" I suggest this
    is because the lettering may have been prepared by a photo-letting company. They
    routinely compressed fonts to fit available spaces. For a base font we would need
    to look at fonts that were wider. The scale is too small to do any analysis.\r\nDon"

    may be right about the scale, though \u2013 there appears to a bunch of intriguing
    details (like the apparently flat-topped A, M and N, the G with the very low juncture,
    the steep-angled K, and so on) but it's hard to know for certain."

  body: My sentiments exactly, Don. There are several fontmakers who appear to value
    exclusivity over more sales - as reflected in their pricing. Some are thriving
    with that approach, so who am I to argue with the business model. Still, it must
    suck for the small designer.

  body: "What really irritates me, Mike, about the pricing of this font is that from
    a technical point of view it's very easy to make. If pricing had anything to do
    with the work put into a font, then someone like Michael Hagemann, who put months
    of work into some of his ornate Font Mesa fonts, which are outstanding in their
    technical details, could price at least ten times what he is now charging.\r\nBut
    in an open market pricing has nothing to do with cost. \r\nThere are plenty of
    reasonably priced sans serif fonts, but almost all of them try to have distinctive
    features rather than stick to a standard Grotesk design that is well over a century
    old. \r\nI liked the idea of replicating the lettering in this movie poster. So
    I put together my own classic Grotesk capital letters in this weight and proportion
    from scratch. If I bother to add the extras, language support etc., and put it
    up for sale, my pricing would be closer to Font Mesa than Berthold.\r\nWell, that's
    enough of a rant for today :)\r\nDon"
