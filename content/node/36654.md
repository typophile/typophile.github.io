  one of the magazine pages -- and it kept bombing out QuarkXPress (yep the latest
  7.3) two hours of hair pulling.\r\n\r\nI finallly went into the ads on the page
  and found one that had used NuevaMM -- and there was the culprit.\r\n\r\nSo I figure
  I'd write to you and maybe save you some bald spots -- and let you know that --
  it isn't nice to give a busy person an ad with an MM font in it... LOL\r\n\r\nHappy
  to say, Photoshop has flattened the PDF - no one but you guys will know - and now
  I can get the work out to the printer. You think I'm a little late? My September/October
  issue - which should be in folks hands right now -- will be uploaded to the printer...\r\n\r\nWhew
  and Good-night Grace."

    recently posted that Adobe Multiple Master fonts will not work on Vista. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.adobeforums.com/cgi-bin/webx?14@@.3bc3d9b2/26\r\n\r\nAlso:
    \"Our testing also shows some significant problems with ATM (Light or Deluxe)
    on Vista; it's not just that we don't support it, but we actively recommend you
    not try running it on Vista. \"\r\n\r\n\"That being said, we realize that people
    have different expectations for fonts than other software, and we've made an effort
    to help with the migration from MM fonts (and Type 1 fonts in general) to OpenType.
    However, the writing is on the wall for all Type 1 fonts in Windows....\"\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "From the same posting as the link I posted:\r\n\r\n\"Years ago, after Adobe
    discontinued sales of MM fonts, and before we discontinued support, we made a
    special heavy-discount offer for registered owners of those MM fonts for equivalent
    OpenType fonts. I think it was 50% off. However, this was back in 2003 or 2004,
    IIRC. There is no current free upgrade path, and the OpenType versions have considerable
    extra capabilities compared to the original versions.\""

    these, a good number are things like Minion, Myriad, Nueva, etc., which are provided
    in OTF format with the Creative Suite. So, I think Adobe''s position has been
    pretty reasonable. '

    had was Myriad. Now I have the Myriad Pro that came with CS. For my purposes it
    doesn't offer anything extra that the MM version did; in fact, I find it less
    capable because I liked to fine-tune weights and widths. I wouldn't have wanted
    to buy it even at 50% discount. I suupose I could generate MM instances I liked
    and generate them as separate fonts to use in OpenType format."

  body: MM Nueva has caused a lot of trouble at an agency I freelance for occasionally.
    Their solution is to outline the font before printing (they usually work with
    Freehand and a non-intel mac).

    into it. But... fortunately, Photoshop was able to open the pdf and well, saved
    as an .eps no problem. Just irks me how much time it took...\r\n\r\nAlso. that
    same exact ad worked well for the past few issues, it was just all of a sudden
    with this one - and the only changes - 7.1 to 7.3 in Quark and 10.4.9 System going
    to  10.4.10 -- so go figure!"

    that allowed you to alter them.\r\n\r\nAnd once it was altered those instances
    were available in the other Adobe CS1 programs.\r\n\r\nAt the same time they included
    Myriad Pro, Nueva Pro and Minion Pro (perhaps others) in the CS1 release to ease
    the pain of MM dying. Myriad Pro does it pretty proficiently but certainly Nueva
    Pro was a less substantial release.\r\n\r\nAt the time I was involved in a multi-year
    project that had Myriad MM specified for the identity. I was able to transition
    to Myriad Pro thanks to the free release of Myriad Pro with CS1. So thanks Adobe.\r\n\r\nAlthough
    I do miss MM - it seemed like a very good idea at the time\u2026\r\n\r\npbc"

    most of my modification work in Fontographer and FontLab. The trick I've learned
    to port them over to anything that works on OS X is to compress them with Stuffit.
    If not, OS X rips out the resource forks. If so, when opened up in OS X, oh looky
    here, a PS1 font, how quaint.\r\n\r\nTypographically though, doesn't matter the
    format, good type is good type, doesn't matter if it originated in 1452 or 2007.\r\n\r\nGerald"
