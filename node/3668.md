  about the history of this pretty unique and excentric design? <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/28835.gif"

  body: According to the FontShop &#34;FontBook&#34;, Jackson was designed in 1971
    by B. Jacquet. I could not find any other information about the designer or the
    typeface.

  body: I think Agfa still has some of their fonts, but if I recall, they were acquired
    about 4 years ago and are no longer producing/selling fonts.

  body: See the <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/mecanorma/" target="_blank">writeup
    about Mecanorma at MyFonts</a>. The only site that lists many of their fonts is
    Atomic Type &#40;UK&#41;. Judging from some of the other font offerings there,
    I question whether this is a quality font source. Does anyone know more about
    them?

  body: BTW, <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=206450" target="_blank">MN
    Jackson</a> is still sold by Agfa, and I think that&#39;s where Jack Jackson&#39;s
    image originated.

  body: OK, thanks for the input. I had been told that it was out on the Mecanorma
    label, i.e. whatever there is left of it. but, - what about this B. Jacquet -
    who is he, has he &#40;or she&#41; done anything else? How on earth does one come
    up with anything as great and ugly as that? Surely must have been french?
