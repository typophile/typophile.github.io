  = &#34;don&#39;t look like crap&#34;.  The humor/humour was lost on me, but the
  &#34;hint&#34; or &#34;snub&#34; wasn&#39;t.  '

    look at the source for any page with posts, that&#39;s actual code they&#39;re
    using on the pages, for everybody. Nothing to do with you personally.  <BR> <BR>Cheers,

    tags and comments..</i> <BR> <BR>&#40; I think this has to do something with CSS

  body: 'A while back, about a year ago I think, some Typophile members were complaining
    about how the Typophile forums looked in their browser of choice on their platform
    of choice. This lead to some attempts by Joe and Jared to control the code produced
    by  the engine which runs this discussion group. They were only partially successful
    &#40;as I recall&#41; and, apparently out of frustration over the difficulty of
    doing this, named one of the styles they created &#34;dontLookLikeCrap&#34;. Unfortunately,
    the way they did it must have been something of a hack, since the style declaration
    shows up when you try to edit your post and then becomes part of the post when
    you save it &#40;unless you know to remove it&#41;. It adds it in every time you
    edit a post, so you might end up with several littering the beginning of your
    message. <BR> <BR>Until Joe and Jared find a better solution, the only thing you
    can do is try to remember to remove the offending tags when and if you change
    your mind about something you post. <BR> <BR>In the mean time, I have a suggestion
    to Joe and Jared: Maybe you could rename the style &#34;RemoveThisFontTagMarkUpIfYouEditYourPost&#34;
    or something similar.'

    accept my apology for my impulsive overreaction. <BR> <BR>I guess either way,
    the joke&#39;s on me, but now I see the humor in it &#40;only I&#39;m more embarrassed
    than anything&#41;.

  body: I dont think the type community is elitist, anymore than I think the bongocero
    community is, its just not well understood or known about.  <BR> <BR>Spending
    your life explaining to people that yes, new typefaces do sometimes need to be
    created, or that no, I can&#39;t &#34;just&#34; send the font files for that job
    to you, or that there is a good reason why you chose Verdana over Helvetica for
    that website is often lonely and frustrating. <BR> <BR>Typophile reminds us that
    there are other like-minded nerds out there too. And thats cool.

    terms of content, though, and, as always, content trumps technology. ;o&#41;

    smilies to show up. I just use the old method. :-&#41; <BR> <BR>&#40;It drives
    me a little crazy that you have to use non-standard markup for links here. It&#39;s
    gotten so I sometimes type backslashes, commas and curly brackets when I&#39;m
    writing HTML code. Argh.&#41;

    people think I&#39;m hating. <BR> <BR>Well yeah, explaining why we need new typefaces
    usually makes people smile and then turn to talk to other people, like car designers,
    who somehow never have to explain why we need new cars.
