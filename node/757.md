    client is not going to tell the  guy what typeface was used for that logo. <BR>

  body: The other possibility is that no specific font was used. I know that logo
    has been around for a long time - I could easily believe it was more than twenty
    years ago that I first saw it as a kid. Is it possible the letters were drawn
    explicitly for the logo? I&#39;m not a graphic designer, but I have to assume
    that happens/-ed, especially in the days before digital type.

  body: 'Based on some of the &#39;artifacts&#39; displayed on the Bata Memories web
    site, I&#39;d have to agree that the logotype has been around for much of the
    company&#39;s existance and is probably was originally a hand-drafted design.

    <BR> <BR>On a related note, check out the rather wonderful variation of the typeface
    used in the masthead of the company newspaper from the 1940&#39;s: <BR> <BR><a
