    street&#39; while wearing their TypeCon T-shirts? <BR> <BR>Apparently John Berry
    was accosted by a graphic designer on the streets of Seattle who&#39;d heard of
    the event and wanted to know more.  <BR> <BR>Perhaps TypeCon is the Woodstock
    of typography? <BR> <BR>Si <BR>

    I wear such a thing.

    early 90s&#41;. &#34;What does that mean?&#34; the waitress spurted as we were
    leaving, visibly contorting between the two pressures of &#34;the customer is
    always right&#34; and [manipulated] patriotism. These days I think I&#39;d just
    get shot before even making it to the entrance. By the guy who cleans the toilets.

    to Sacramento and had a very pleasant conversation with a young woman who had
    just graduated from CCAC. She was leafing through the red Emigre specimen book
    so it was easy to tell.

    - Thursday, March 18, 2004, 3:19 pm <BR> <BR>As for being &#34;extreme&#34;, I
    guess it&#39;s a matter of viewpoint. To me the world is currently in an &#34;extreme&#34;
    state, there&#39;s no sign of possible improvement on the horizon, and gradual
    correction has become preposterously idealistic. Sometimes you have to destroy
    to rebuild properly. <BR> <BR>&#62; what would Matthew -- and Walgreens -- think
    about all this? <BR> <BR>Most probably diametrically opposite things. Carter&#39;s
    &#34;I am a communist&#34; during his kaffeeklatsch at TypeCon98 is memorable
    - it could have been an auto-simplification &#40;something I do a lot&#41;, but
    still. <BR> <BR>Yves, a kaffiyyeh is apparently something you wear to signal that
    you want to kill innocent Americans. I don&#39;t want to kill Americans &#40;even
    guilty ones&#41;, but I do own one: it&#39;s a black-and-white &#40;the red-and-whites
    come from the badaween, I believe, and I consider classier&#41;, it&#39;s made
    in Syria, but it&#39;s one-sided, so not really the real thing. Not that I can
    wear it any more anyway. <BR> <BR>BTW, Karen Huang occasionally does good food
