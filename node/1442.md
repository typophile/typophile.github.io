  be accused of hijacking someone else&#39;s. <BR> <BR>Now that I&#39;ve thought about
  it for a whole day and looked over all the Heller texts I have hanging around at
  home, I can rationalise my feelings to a certain extent. <BR> <BR>In a nutshell,
  then, I don&#39;t like it when a prolific and respected writer abuses his or her
  position and disseminates their own prejudices/political agenda disguised as critical
  writing. <BR> <BR>This extract from Heller&#39;s <i><b>Designing Hate: Is There
  a Graphic Language of Vile Emotion</b></i> takes the biscuit as far as I&#39;m concerned:
  <BR> <BR><i>German Fraktur type &#40;as opposed to other medieval gothics, such
  as Old English&#41; still evokes iron-fisted authority. The words ULT!, VERBOTEN!,
  and JUDE! are frightening when spelled out in these letterforms. Actually, anything
  set in Fraktur, even the most harmless words and phrases, takes on a decidedly ominous
  look.</i> <BR> <BR>I&#39;m sorry, but this is pure propaganda. He should be ashamed
  of himself for publishing it. Or maybe the publisher should be ashamed.  <BR> <BR>Anyway,
  this sort of thing coupled with the tripe in his Swastika book have most definitely
  turned me off his work.  <BR> <BR>Matha'

    review of the book &#34;Beirut&#39;s Memory&#34; in the previous issue of Print.
    I wrote a letter to Print as a result &#40;my first ever to them&#41;, and they&#39;ll
    be publishing it - probably with some &#34;last word&#34; rebuttal by Heller tacked
    on. <BR> <BR>Although in an email exchange &#40;that ensued as a result of my
    letter&#41; Heller ended up telling me &#34;we are not on opposite ends of the
    political divide&#34;, I can&#39;t read his mind to know what that really means.

    curious explorer who writes down his impressions about subjects he&#39;s interested

    Heller is <BR>&#62; jewish, so am I&#41; people making propagandist <BR>&#62;
    statements of the swastika? <BR> <BR>All the time. And for very good reason: it&#39;s
    a superb graphic symbol of the Enemy, hence very useful to keep reminding people
    to be nice to the [erstwhile] Victim. <BR> <BR>I wish the Turks had such a symbol
    that we Armenians could use. It can even be argued &#40;based on speeches Hitler
    made&#41; that the Holocaust wouldn&#39;t have happened if we Armenians had such
    an  enemy symbol available and had used it as effectively as the Jews use the
    Swastika. On the other hand, media wasn&#39;t nearly as good as brainwashing and
    manipulation as it is now. <BR> <BR>So in a way I understand the Jewish desire
    to keep it Evil, but I can&#39;t stand the duplicity necessary in applying it
    &#40;even though it&#39;s part and parcel of such propaganda&#41;, I guess because
    Jews aren&#39;t the underdogs any more. Now they have an underdog, who I guess
    are in turn lucky to have the Star of David as a symbol with as much potential
    as the Swastika!  :-/ <BR> <BR>But what really riles me up the most isn&#39;t
    the Swastika treatment, it&#39;s the blackletter blacklisting. It is a violation
    of venerable typographic culture to subjugate blackletter to the Jewish cause
    &#40;no matter if you think the cause is just or not&#41; the way is done with
    the Swastika. Leave blackletter alone, so that it may flourish again. <BR> <BR>&#62;
    To me it just takes big balls to tackle <BR>&#62; such a project and face the
    consequences. <BR> <BR>What the hell are the consequences when all you&#39;re
    doing is catering the existing power structure?! What would take balls is to publish

    teasing! <BR> <BR>But, <BR>..... <BR>German Fraktur type &#40;as opposed to other
    medieval gothics, such as Old English&#41; still evokes iron-fisted authority.
    The words ULT!, VERBOTEN!,and JUDE! are frightening when spelled out in these
    letterforms. Actually, anything set in Fraktur, even the most harmless words and
    phrases, takes on a decidedly ominous look. <BR>....... <BR> <BR>The words ULT!,
    VERBOTEN!,and JUDE! <BR> <BR>Well, if you look at these words they don&#39;t look
    overly pleasant in Sans Serif either!???? <BR> <BR>His opinion, his problem. <BR>
    <BR>Usage outstrips form. Earlier I mention propaganda. Later about that! For
    me Fraktur has nothing evil embodied in the forms themselves. Many words are ugly
    no matter what the type face. <BR> <BR>Especially, cough cough, in bolds. <BR>
    <BR>&#34;Heller&#34; for instance &#34;evokes&#34; something that could be ugly
    in itself. It does not have a Polly Anna look to it. <BR> <BR>For instance, HELL,
    HELLER and HELLIST. Think about it? <BR> <BR>By the way, when you have multiple
    Zerox copies, are they called Zeroxies, or Zeroxen? <BR> <BR>I suppose it is always
    easiest to blame the medium rather than the messenger. I remember my great distaste
    for &#34;Pastonchi&#34;, not the &#34;nuts&#34;, the &#34;type face&#34;. Thought
    it was a &#34;Bread Truck Typeface&#34;. Then Dave Farey sent me a copy of a book
    set in the face, one word, &#34;beautiful&#34;. I have like bread trucks ever
    since! Not many around these days? <BR> <BR>Fraktur has thorniness in form. I
    am surrounded by it in Finnish bookstores. Thorns are certainly a respectable
    fence. My past life gave me a great deal of time gardening. Most thorns evoke
    in me a sense of raspberries, blackberries and even the &#34;lonely rose has thorns&#34;.
    <BR> <BR>Gardening, bread trucks and typography, there you have it. <BR> <BR>Gerald

    its central swastika will always be offensive Jews as the symbol of a regime that
    chose to murder nearly half of the Jewish population in the world simply for being
    Jewish. &#34; <BR>....... <BR> <BR>You have a good heart. I know that. You do,
    I see it in your writings. <BR> <BR>Naturally you are aware that many American
    blacks find Jews offensive because of their systematic participation in the slave
    trade? We have not stopped eating bagels though have we? <BR> <BR>Further more
    what happened to the North American Indian? But we have not given them back their
    land, have we? Oh, land, but, but, that&#39;s much more than a symbol? <BR> <BR>Few
    people are aware of how many Indians lived in America when the white man came.
    Few know that the white man used biological warfare on them. And some democracy!
    I am not sure when the Indians were even allowed to vote. In Canada it was the
    fifties. Possibly the Canadian Indians got to vote earlier than the American Indians.
    <BR> <BR>Anyway, how many Indians do you figure there were? Lots! Far more than
    half of them were killed. So lets not talk so much of symbols. They are not evil.
    Mankind is evil. Lets get back to the Palestinians, or the Jewish &#34;state&#34;.
    Heller seems to have much time on his hands. He should do something constructive
    such as identifying good from evil. The Palistinian question is a short study.
    But if he simply does not like Germans he should just come out and say so. <BR>
    <BR>Maybe he is a racist, anyone asked? <BR> <BR>Furthermore the Swastika has
    great meaning to other cultures. Also it has great meaning to the European cultures.
    I am not so sure that it should be &#34;swept under the table&#34;. It is offensive
    to many and it should be. But symbols don&#39;t kill people, people kill people.
    So given Heller&#39;s logic we should get rid of people.  <BR> <BR>Those are the
    issues that should be dealt with, as Henry Kissinger states, the &#34;National
    Psychiatric of Cultures&#34;. The swastika should remain hanging in every household
    as a reminder of how terrible man is to each other. Frankly, I do not think things
    should be forgotten in 100 years, if ever. <BR> <BR>Furthermore, most of those
    illustrations, particularly the first set that Matha exhibited are indeed just
    plain ugly. They are offensive just because they are. Ugly! <BR> <BR>But I could
    design a swastika that is beautiful and meant as such. Not only that but I would
    have spiritual justification for doing so. I could also print a beautiful book
    in Fraktur. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>Gerald Giampa <BR> <BR>
