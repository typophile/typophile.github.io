  body: Yeah, it's hard to see the nuances of the type at that size. Gill does look
    pretty close though. Thanks a lot Nick.

  body: "There are three reasons I have doubts about Gill Sans:\r\n1 - The G shape
    slightly too curved in Gill;\r\n2 - the 't' top looks wrong;\r\n3 - the 'f' seems
    to arc over more in the sample than Gill.\r\n\r\nMy suggestions from a partial
    scan of the Sans ID Guide:\r\nAlinea Sans, FF Kievit, Whitney, and Seria Sans\r\n\r\n-

    a frutiger with \xABwrong\xBB cut-angles)."

  body: "After further looking I don't think it's Kievit either -- too heavy for one
    thing. I'm making test drives to try them for comparison.\r\n\r\nThe main problem
    is not enough letters. With an 'a', 'g', 'y', 'M' and 'R', I'd think we could
    nail it. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Well I looked at my other two suggestions and I'm convinced neither of them
    is a good match either. So then I tried Gill Sans in a test drive at MyFonts.
    Look at <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/gill-sans/light/\">Gill
    Sans Light</a>. The 't' is different than in the regular weight, and the 'r' is
    about the closest match, and the G looks better too. I think right now that's
    my vote.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
