  learn more about typography. I'm not very good at creating a font, and I get tired
  of using the same old font in a lot of my identity designs. Well I don't use the
  same font, but you know what I mean. It seems like a broken record to me. I would
  like to have some more creativity under my belt.\r\n\r\nMy favorite type of logos
  are the ones that have a clever use of negative space, and ones that use text more
  effectively than just at the bottom or to the side of the logo.\r\n\r\nThanks for
  reading and I hope I can prove to be somewhat useful here.\r\nJ"
