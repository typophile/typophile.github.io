  the forums a bit for the past year or so. \r\n\r\nAnywho, I plan on creating a typeface
  for use on the web and I haven't ever done that...sooo I was wondering if anyone
  had some advice from experience and examples if possible.\r\n\r\nI've been examining
  Verdana's development and other current web standard typeface features, but I'm
  just looking for some things to keep in mind when designing this typeface. \r\n\r\nThis
  typeface will be used as body copy and that will be its primary use. I might extend
  it later but right now the plan is just to develop a nice typeface for use on a
  website I'm creating."

    both are.\r\n\r\nand this has just reminded me of David Crossland's Cantarell

  body: "There isn't a lot of pixelfont action these days, but when they were \"in\"
    the accepted way to make them render out predictably was to shoot for 8 point
    (at 72 dpi) no matter how many pixels high the font actually was. For example
    my three sizes of Mana* all need to be set at 8 to come out right (you just need
    to determine the leading accordingly). Yes, it's a hack, but it makes -or at least
    made- things as controllable as possible.\r\n\r\n* http://www.themicrofoundry.com/manademo/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Yes.\r\n\r\nOf course if your font is very large (which rarely makes sense
    though) you get in trouble, so you might use 20. Nothing in between works well*
    because Windows uses a nominal dpi of 96, so you want 75% (72/96) of the number
    to result in an integer. The problem with anything besides 8 is that the user
    needs to be aware of what size to use for it to click.\r\n\r\n* Remember, it has
    to divide 1000 evenly.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Eh? The first line said; designing a web text font to work best at 8ths of
    an em, (assuming you're not also designing a style for each of the other sizes)
    is really small. Verdana! which was designed some 15 years ago is based on 13ths
    of an em, (though strictly speaking it's more attuned to 26ths of an em). This
    is, I think, a 96 dpi 11 pt?\r\n\r\nEh?2 The second line says how does it help
    an 8 ppm \"web text face\" to be scaled down to a 125ths of itself? \r\ni,e, if
    you're only concerned with the font's appearance at 8ppm, then 64 or 128 units
    per em is enough even for a script face, (assuming it's only intended for use
    at 8 ppm).\r\n\r\nCheer~!\r\n"

  body: "Just looked at Verdana which is 2046 UPM - so I would guess it divides down
    more evenly into unit 16units/ pixles (x80 to make the UPM). Though I might be
    understanding this wrong.\r\n\r\nYes, by setting 'Grid step' to 16 hits all the
    horizontals bars spot on, then there is a certain amount of movement elsewhere.\r\nEverything
    seems to be a little bit off the grid (even straight verticals)- I guess consistently
    so. Perhaps after roughing in the glyph outlines onto the 16 unit grid then the
    process is to actually make the outlines look good aesthetically, (using your
    inert optical typographic principles) then control the lines - moving them back
    to where is required to viewing on screen with the hinting. This way getting the
    best of both world, however printing gives you a good looking font - though a
    bit round and square (like Johnstone's Underground), well you can't have everything?\r\n\r\nCan
    anyone comment on the process?\r\n\r\nT- has no sidebearings! - Verdana is an
    enigma...\r\n\r\n/m"
