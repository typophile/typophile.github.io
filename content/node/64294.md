  series for infants and little kids. I need to make a few posters.\r\nSo far the
  studio hasn't been much helpfull, so does anybody know a typeface resembling Bumba?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance, Brieck\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bumba_4146.jpg]"

    I would guess the BUMBA lettering is custom.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
