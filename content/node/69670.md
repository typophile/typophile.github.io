body: "I'm planning to use Warnock Pro as the text face for a book. However, I need
  a sans that will work well with it. The trouble is, the obvious options fail on
  one or more of the necessary criteria.\r\n1. It has to have small caps and maybe
  also an italic (or oblique)\r\n2. It has to have Greek, or at least there has to
  be a Greek face that's similar enough I can drop a word or two of Greek caps or
  small caps into the same line of text as Latin caps or small caps. Monotonic Greek
  should suffice. Cyrillic isn't absolutely necessary, but it might not hurt. (The
  Greek requirement is also limiting my options for the text face.)\r\n3. It needs
  to be reasonably sturdy for good color when set amidst 10.5/13 Warnock Pro Regular.\r\n\r\nAt
  the moment the best I've come up with is Hypatia, but the lack of italics may be
  a problem.\r\n\r\nThe book has to do with twentieth-century sculpture (everything
  from Beaux-Arts in the early decades through Art Deco to some more contemporary
  styles in the 1980s and early 1990s).\r\n\r\nAny ideas?"

  body: "So it does, and it's a very well-executed design too. But how well does it
    work with Warnock?\r\n\r\nSame issue with the ClearType fonts, although I suppose
    Candara might do if I were to fiddle with the setting. Informa may be a possibility.
    Perhaps Underground also, although again it might get along better with a different
    text face.\r\n\r\nMaybe I need to reconsider the Warnock part of it. Something
    more bland would be a lot easier to match."

  body: "<em>But how well does it work with Warnock?</em>\r\n\r\nI couldn't say without
    setting comparative mixed text. Stylistically, the choice of \"g\" with either
    one or two bowls gives you some leeway. Similarly there is a plain (geometric)
    Greek and a stylistic alternative, more \"scripty\".\r\n\r\nWarnock and Figgins
    are not equivalent in vertical metrics.\r\nI don't have Warnock on my computer,
    so was not able to compare x-height, which is a crucial factor for mixed text,
    but it's not critical for x-height to be identical. I decided against that for
    the Modern Suite, finding that a Regular weight sans serif looks bigger than a
    serifed face of the same x-height. \r\n\r\nWould you like to try it out?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Nick: Yes, I'd be interested to try it out. I did try MT Grotesque, which
    is the closest design I have to Figgins, and in some respects it worked well but
    the overall effect was kind of odd - partly vertical metrics (though this worked
    better if I set the Grot about 10% smaller) and partly spacing. From what I've
    seen in your specimen PDF I'd expect Figgins to work considerably better, though,
    and it certainly has all the features I need for this project.\r\n\r\nSi: Geschke

    number of intriguing possibilities suggest themselves, but the single best pairing

  body: If the text face and its sans companion need to be mixed on the same line,
    in lieu of matching color and x-height, you may simply choose a single super-family
    such as the aforementioned Anselm Pro (a useful reinterpretation of the types
    of Jean Jannon). The exact relationship between the sans and the serif all depends
    on how intimately they are combined.

  body: Thanks, Christopher. I guess I had been thinking of something with geometric
    tendencies due to the Art Deco-era inscriptional lettering that will be in many
    of the illustrations, but in terms of the type itself, I like the look of Anselm
    Sans. The Anselm superfamily as a whole is probably not viable for this job based
    on the client's objections to other text faces I had considered, but the sans
    looks like something that has a reasonably good chance of surviving the three
    or four people there who will have something to say about the design. The weight
    looks good, and I think the lack of Greek small caps will not be a problem, based
    on the portion of the manuscript I've worked on so far.
