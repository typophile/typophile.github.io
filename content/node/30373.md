  reading around the forums and doing some other resarch of course too i am pretty
  much set that i want my final major project to be based around type. My problem
  is that i get to choose what its about. Now that doesnt sound too bad but i havnt
  a clue what i want to do for it. This sounds like one of those situations where
  anyone reading this will go \"well if you dont know what to do how are we going
  to know\" well really what im asking of all you helpfull people is if you have seen,read,know
  of any outstanding work which was based on a design brief or set of rules. Also
  anything else you can think of that'l help me becuase i am really stuck! my one
  and only idea is to design evocative typography based around the theme of hate is
  beutifull but that is a very vague FMP. Btw im not BA :( im ND i know its silly
  to be this worried about a FMP at this level but im sure everyone has work they
  did when they first started out that they are really proud of. Well i want this
  to be it for me :)\r\n\r\nThanks a bunch!\r\nKarl"

  body: "Your course is graphic design I assume?\r\n\r\nStart by thinking about what
    interests you; make a list of topics and consider also how you might manifest
    these into exciting personal portfolio pieces. I have seen students take a desperate
    stab in the dark at choosing an FMP topic, only to realise that they have bitten
    off more than they can chew or that they soon grow tired of a subject that they
    initially thought would be exciting. Don't forget that this project needs to sustain
    your interest for around nine (?) weeks. What type of (typographic) projects have
    you found most intersting and enjoyable so far? \r\n\r\n\"I know its silly to
    be this worried about a FMP at this level\"\r\nNo, it's not silly, I suspect that
    you are preparing a portfolio for HE or employment. You're right to be concerned
    about the outcome.\r\n\r\nAbove all, you need to discuss this at length with your
    tutors as soon as possible."

    body: "Yes its graphics, and its a 10 week project. Im taking a gap year between
      year 2 nd graphics and a ba in graphics to get some industry experiance as it
      is quite a diffrent world than college and uni! The most enjoyable project so
      far was a global warming awarness campaign but after talking to my brother (year
      3 of graphics ba) it seems everyone and there dog is doing a global warming
      awarness campaigns and i know i could do another one and i would hope it would
      be good/better than others but if its a overdone project than i feel it would
      hav type is te lost its zing if i talk to someone about it. The thing that i
      like the most out ofhe contruction of it (of course) but i often see mixed media
      type peices where the type has been constructed out of carpet,fire,thread anything
      the list is endless. true you have a point about it needign to sustain me for
      10 weeks and maybe this is a large factor towards what i am thinking about doing.
      thank you so much t bones thats helped a great deal!\r\n\r\nkarl"

  body: "Hi guys\r\n       Thought id update you on what im most likely going to do
    for my fmp. I will be producing two a2 posters promoting diverse music being brodcasted
    by digital radio, the way this is going to be done is by creating two stories
    (probly one love and one hate) and make a mix tape thing (which when my fmp is
    being shown will be played) of the lyrics being sung as you read the lyrics being
    typographically represented on the a2 posters. ive givern a little bit of thought
    about this and the way im going to do the posters is to look at each snippet of
    lyric. For example jayz saying 'i dont know' from 99 problems as a peice of the
    overall puzzle and work on them indivuadaly looking closely at how i can best
    represent 'i dont know' from jay z typographically without looking at the genre
    of music that it has come from. The idea behind it being that whatever genre of
    music you prefer, they are all saying the same thing (roughly :S) What do you
    guys think... honestly :) its abit experimental and might be a little to complex
    in my opinion tyring to explain it to people but i think it has creative potential.\r\n\r\nthanks
    alot karl"

  body: "Karl,\r\n\r\n\u201Cits abit experimental and might be a little to complex
    in my opinion tyring to explain it to people but i think it has creative potential.\u201D\r\n\r\nAgreed,
    I think the project has potential, though the brief needs to be tighter. Just
    a couple of questions:\r\n\r\nFirstly, these \u201Ca2 posters promoting diverse
    music being brodcasted by digital radio\u201D.\r\n\r\nWho is the typical listener?\r\n\r\nIs
    this a new station or a station trying to draw in a new group of listeners?\r\n\r\nHow
    diverse is the music? You mention Jayz (of whom I know little) but let\u2019s
    say the music played is truly diverse, like world music for example. Then the
    poster might be markedly different to that with an R\u2019n\u2019B angle.\r\n\r\nHow
    important is it to promote the digital aspect? Is it digital radio that\u2019s
    the focus of attention or a specific broadcasting station?\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t
    understand the \u2018love/hate\u2019 concept. How and why did you arrive at that?\r\n\r\nIs
    there any other copy?\r\n\r\nI think you need to consider <strong>exactly</strong>
    what it is that you want your posters to do. Keep distilling the ideas until the
    focus is that much clearer. Simplify.\r\n\r\nFinally, have you discussed these
    ideas with your tutors? They should be helping you and they will be marking your
    work. Utilise them.\r\n\r\nPerhaps post your initial draft ideas on Typophile\u2019s
    critique section.\r\n"
