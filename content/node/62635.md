  I lament the lose of a Rand logo, like the classic UPS logo, but in this case, I
  wasn't a huge fan of the Yale logo. I've tried understanding the construction of
  the type and the geometry and I don't quite see the reasoning in it. Here's my quick
  study of it:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rand2_6203.png]\r\n\r\nIf anyone
  could shed some light on the grid, the negative space, the reasoning I'd love to
  hear it. Based on all his other work and the fact that he's considered to be the
  father of logo design in America, this one seems inconstant and idiosyncratic."

    \r\n\r\nMy best guess as to the change is that people may not appreciate this
    form of witty communication as much anymore. Also, the letters he designed for
    this symbol do seem very much of the time he lived; therefore, dating the mark.
    \r\n\r\nI always thought that this design looked like the buildings on the Yale
    campus. I thought it looked like the architecture. If you have ever visited there
    I believe you would see them as Professor Rand saw them each day he taught at
    the campus; however, I am almost positive that he explains the design himself
    in one of his books and I apologize for not recalling it now. \r\n\r\nHe always
    struck me as a very illustrative typographer. He invoked images and personification
    with his handling of type. He was a master of graphics, iconography, typography,
    line, shape, color, space,image, instruction, and writing on his trade. He is
    a designer I always thought was a fantastic communicator. It was often something
    simple (keep in mind that simplicity is hardly simple to do), witty, and observed
    by all; however, not articulated until he put his finger on it. \r\n\r\nDoes Matthew
    Carter's typeface constitute a great logotype? No. I don't believe it is very
    successful. Yes, it does bring the university and press together; however, Paul
    Rand's intention was to separate and differentiate the two. That being said, it
    is not the reason Carter's logotype seems to fail. I think the logotype, in my
    opinion, does not make the mark (pun) because it lacks character. It seems pedestrian
    and common. Don't get me wrong as I like the type design. I think that it is not
    adequate as a mark of distinction. Just an opinion. "
