  a little ornament at the end of a paragraph but I don't know if to omit the 'period
  and place the ornament right ahead' or to place the ornament in the next line. Look
  at the example at the bottom of this link:\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/16287#comment-317418"

    at all to the poster. I believe it would be cleaner without it.

  body: "I've seen such things used a the end of articles in magazines, usually in
    ones that had partial column continuations in the back. They were something simple,
    though. Most often a square box, sometimes with a simplified logo inside, sometimes
    with a color. One magazine I read would drop an \"\u03A9\" in that spot. But these
    were used to separate one article from another. On your poster with a single passage
    of text, it isn't necessary, and the particular ornament you chose doesn't match
    the style of the type. If you feel you must put <em>something</em> there, I think
    a square box would work well enough, especially since you've established squares
    as a design theme in the rest of the poster."

  body: "I do not feel that an ornament is necessary, but I understand the desire
    to experiment typographically. If you feel that it makes your design stronger
    then I say go for it. Sometimes designers can become too ornamental or too clean
    in their approach. I would hate to look back on my body of work and feel like
    I had never taken any risks.\r\n\r\nIn response to your original question, I would
    use either a period or an ornament, not both. The ornament will act as a \"termination
    point\" for the paragraph by itself. I would recommend not allowing the ornament
    to hang out beyond the grid directly above it. Eliminating the period will give
    the ornament some room to tuck in, but some space  should be left around the ornament
    itself. The last word of the paragraph will becoem illegible if the ornament is
    too close in proximity.\r\n\r\nOther thoughts:\r\n\r\nOverall, it looks to me
    like you could close up your word spacing a bit, it feels loose. This will give
    you more room for your ornament.\r\n\r\nSpacing your text so that there is no
    hyphenation would benefit your design. It's one thing to hyphenate in a novel,
    but this is essentially display type on a poster. There's no reason to break the
    thought.\r\n\r\nThe \"INSCRIPCIONES\" part should also find some placement in
    your grid, after all the entire poster is a grid so it makes that part stick out.
    It feels like the type has been stuck there to fill the space."
