body: "Hi, I have spent a couple of weeks looking at the site and forums etc and found
  a lot of interesting and useful information. But now I need some help and thought
  this would be a good place to start.\r\nI am making a piece for a Uni project on
  the history of punctuation. \r\nI want it to be all about the style of writing using
  appropriate fonts for each period of time. But I am stuck with the layout.\r\nI
  only have 6 small paragraphs of text, and they are small. But have pictured this
  as a long narrow print with lots of white space. I am really struggling to find
  anything to help me with the layout of this.\r\nAny advice/suggestions I can go
  to the library with would be much appreciated.\r\nI have included an image of my
  first attempt I am aware I may need to change a few fonts and simplify the 'C's'
  in the background. But any advice/critisism gratefully recieved.\r\n "
