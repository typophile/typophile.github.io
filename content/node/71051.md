body: This is Geometric 415 set I think as in InDesign with kerning set to Metrics
  and no tracking. Will the metrics have been designed deliberately to isolate the
  1 like this, or is it just accidentally ugly?

  body: Could be that tabular figures are default...see if there's a proportional
    one somewhere in the glyph palette?

    an extremely <em>thick</em> '1'!\r\n\r\n(It's even more visible in the otherwise
    very agreeable Gill Sans.)"

  body: "Some sans typefaces have a large \"beak\" on the one. e.g. Helvetica.\r\nOthers
    have a baseline crossbar on the one, e.g Franklin Gothic.\r\n\r\nNowadays, many
    typefaces have alternate designs for proportional and tabular \"one\"s.\r\nI usually
    put a baseline crossbar on my tab \"one\"s.\r\n\r\nYou need to use an OpenType
    layout palette to access the alternate."
