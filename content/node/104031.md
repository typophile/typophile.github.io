  body: "I would concur with bojev's find of Koloss. The B in the logo is in discord
    with the rest of the letters. I suggest this is probably a logo designer's custom
    touch. However, it is possible that someone released this Koloss variation as
    a font under another name.\r\n\r\nI like <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/castletype/koloss-ct/\">
    Koloss CT </a> from Castle Type which includes the addition of  Koloss Bold Condensed
    and Koloss Bold Wave.\r\nKoloss was designed by J. Erbar and released by Ludwig
    & Mayer in 1923. Some differences from the digitized versions, including an angled
    termination to the leg on R.\r\n\r\nDon"

  body: "Well, I did some investigating, and found out that the Koloss CG (Regular)
    is actually used on one of The Paley Bros. 7\" singles, so I'm going to consider
    it a win.\r\n\r\nThank you both for the information, it is greatly appreciated!\r\nTT"
