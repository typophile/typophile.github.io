  I feel like I should make another effort to register Paragraph. Over the past year
  I sent numerous emails to Microsoft Typography, followed all sorts of outdated links,
  supplied all sorts of info, emailed technical support, and in the end ended up where
  I started: tsitebug@microsoft.com, where as far as I can tell, nothing happens.\r\nHow
  important is the registration, and does anyone still provide it?\r\nprgr ;-)"

  body: Oops - sorry about that - I found a mail from 2007. Sorry we didn't register
    you. Would be good to know what other methods failed - apart from the spam-filter
    it should be pretty reliable.

  body: "Great, Simon.\r\n\r\nHere is the text:\r\n\r\nParagraph is a foundry of Jan
    Schmoeger, an Australian designer. Jan has been fascinated by fonts since his
    childhood in Prague, Czech Republic (born there in 1949). Having spent most of
    his working life as a graphic/book designer and a part-time lecturer at a Melbourne
    university, he now plans to divide his time between typography and sailing.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    could you please change the address to:\r\n7/60 Beach Rd, Mentone, Victoria 3194,
    Australia (I am retiring the PO box)\r\n\r\nPRGR (wow!)"
