body: "My mom uses Arial Rounded . . . a lot. She sent an email to a mailing list,
  as she often does and some crazy woman totally flipped out on her for ALL CAPS YELLING.
  However the original was not in all caps. I suspect the internetwhiner didn't have
  Arial Rounded and an all caps font with similar Panose settings was substituted.
  I don't think there is Panose setting to indicate that a font is all caps. Should
  every Panose setting in an all caps font have all setting set to \"no fit\"? What
  about the Latin Decorative/initials setting?\r\n\r\nI don't want a despot to launch
  missiles because Obama seemed to be yelling at him in an email."

    mum used Arial Rounded and commented on its lack of serifs -- and a whiner would
    say \"hey, on <em>my</em> screen this font <em>has</em> serifs!\".\r\nA quick
    check would be to copy the text from the whiner's screen and paste it anywhere
    else, then change the font.\r\n\r\n<cite>I don't want a despot to launch missiles

    the whiner was too <em>intense</em> to listen to reason. I wonder how many often
    people have received emails which inadvertently appeared to be yelling because
    fonts were substituted for all caps fonts.\r\n\r\nI imagine the typical Panose
    settings for a typical all caps font doesn't differ from a regular font. For example,
    if someone created an all caps rounded sans and faithfully applied <a href=\"http://www.panose.com\">proper</a>
    Panose settings according, it could end up with exactly the same Panose settings
    as Arial Rounded.\r\n\r\nTo prevent future yelling, perhaps font creation software
    could automatically set all Panose categories to No Fit for all caps font. Provide
    an ALL CAPS checkbox the same way FontLab studio provides a Monospaced checkbox.
    When checked, it would automatically set all Panose settings to no-fit.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf
    you're reading this and you don't know what Panose settings are, check out http://www.panose.com
