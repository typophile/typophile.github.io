  body: "The 'AMET' looks similar to <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-kabel/\">Kabel</a>,
    but the '&' is from something else. Do you need 'Group' too? (not Kabel). Seeing
    it in test drive, I guess Kabel's A is not quite as wide, but it might give you
    something to work with.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
