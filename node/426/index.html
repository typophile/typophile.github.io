There isn't, and every single compagny paper they have are of very poor quality (the worse is that there's a &quot;graphism&quot; branch in another school of the same group). <BR>So though i know my things really not deserves to be there, i guess maybe you can give me ideas to make it less miserable (in all cases, it will be better than the nothing they have). <BR>There's an old first version, made with Dominican (which appears to me to fit well with ceramics) and another with tyfa (which is more modern but still make tghink of some past in my view). <BR>Be hard, i really haven't any pretention. You can't hurt me.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/12086.gif" alt="logo"> <BR>Only typography, it's not a brand but, let's say a &quot;pretty name&quot;.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;Yes, a logo working for ceramics is probably harder to do. But i'm not sure letters are more difficult to do than a mosaic thing. It's an interesting way to go, but despite the name, the school teaches also plate decoration &amp; things like that, so if the ceramics motto is a thing to explore, i guess i don't have to be to precise about it, if you see what i mean. About the ADEF (this is it) logo, i don't think i can do anything. They don't have even a designer (there's maybe someone who's in charge of it, being a secretary or so, and they don't care all all.

		<div class="commentbody">&quot;Chris, thank you, but JFP and others were sadly right on one point : the big E doesn't mean anything. And i don't want so much a meanless design, even if it's aesthetically nice.&quot; <BR> <BR>That's the crux of the matter though. <BR> <BR>If people recognise what you're trying to say, even if the design is meaningless through a design standpoint, you've done your job as a designer. <BR> <BR>You can have perfectly good design, playing by the rules and all that, that can be aestheticly pleasing, yet more often than not, it's the breaking of the rules that actually makes a design aesthetically pleasing. <BR> <BR>When I see your first logo, I see right away what it says, and I look at the way you emphasize the E and think it's a novel away of dealing with the situation. <BR> <BR>Then I look at your updated design, and see the same type of process going on, but say to myself &quot;how boring&quot;. <BR> <BR>Before you decide, do this:  Take both of your designs and show them to laypersons and see which design they like the best.  That is the design you should stick with. <BR> <BR>You're not designing your logo for designers, you're designing it for the common person, and they want something that looks nice.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Guillaume. There is something nice about this latest version. The hand shows through. Similar to ceramics, you can often see the hand in the work. However, I think the silhouette of the vase is too tricky. I wouldn't use that.  Can you unify the weights? The widths on the strokes and interior lines change too much. <BR> <BR>As for the first version. Having the E large as you do, completely confuses the hierarchy of legibility. And as JFP pointed out you have too much going on. <BR> <BR>I would say Tyfa is of the crunchy variety. Not creamy. On the other hand, Biblon is super creamy.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Guillaume, <BR> <BR>I have to agree with Tiffany. The vase shape seemed too contrived before. Now that it's also the C and the accent, it feels even more so. <BR> <BR>I like the handlettered feel of ECP2. Take out the vase and work to make the weight even as Tiffany suggested (Draw a real cap for the C and P rather than enlarging one). I like the horizontal rules in the type though. It subtly suggested a coil pot to me. This can look very elegant too if you want.

		<div class="commentbody">I really think that you stick too much to this single concept. Maybe you should try something completely else (I don't know how you are used to do that, but I would take a sketchbook and go to the coast or mountains somewhere&hellip;). Actually I would read this last version as &quot;eramique&quot; instead of &quot;Ceramique&quot;, if I would not have seen the earlier posts. Personally I even can't see a possibility to make a vase out of a serifed C letter without loosing the legibility completely. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, it seems that this C is not easely readable as a C, as some other people tell me. It's a pity because i liked both the idea and the look. I'm going to the south, very soon, so i guess i'll have to think about it around the seaS&lt;caron&gt; My father himself is a drawer, and a talented one, so i'll try to work with him on other ideas.</div>
