  &#34;Revenge of the Sith&#34; part? <BR> <BR>http://photos6.flickr.com/8466279_b2121a3cc2.jpg

  body: The &#34;EPISODE III&#34; part looks to be some form of Garamond. <BR> <BR>There&#39;s
    also a freeware font on DaFont&#39;s movie section that is &#34;inspired&#34;
    by the Star Wars poster titling, if you&#39;re into the whole poor quality rip-off
    thing. <BR> <BR> - Lex
