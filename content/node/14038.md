  body: "unfortunatly i cannot get a clean sample as i'm using a iMac G3 500MHz with
    os x 10.3.9 and i can't find a way to capture the credits. when i try it just
    gives me a blank screen. \r\n\r\nhere are some really low-res pics taken with
    my phone... i know they are bad but it's the best i can do... sorry...\r\n\r\nhttp://www.varultz.com/hellboy_closing_credits.jpg\r\n\r\n
