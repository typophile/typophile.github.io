  is &#34;theater for people who hate theater; theater for people who love theater.&#34;
  <BR> <BR>Our audience, for the most part, ranges from 18-35, not your typical theatergoing
  crowd. Here is the logo, plus some recent poster images, to give you an idea of

  display and text weights&#41; that reflects the company&#39;s attitude. Show logos
  will always vary, but I want to keep the information font the same from poster to
  poster &#40;other design elements will also help create a consistent look among
  posters&#41;. <BR> <BR>In addition, I want the typeface to be appropriate for text
  usage, such as for the program. Two faces I&#39;ve considered are <a href="http://www.typography.com/catalog/gotham/index.html">HTF
  Gotham</a> and <a href="http://www.psyops.com/html/spec_faceplate.html">PsyOps Faceplate

    I just couldn&#39;t do it. I absolutely love their work. Our stab at Shakespeare
    was subversive, but it&#39;s not everything we do. If it were, I&#39;d be all
    over Storm in a heartbeat. <BR> <BR>I think the successful face will be a versatile

    a little square for my tastes -- I&#39;ll have to check out other FF options.
    <BR> <BR>Thanks for the critique and suggestions, HD. I agree -- I should be more
    subtle in my typography, which is exactly why I want to create a consistent set
    of posters where the type mostly gets out of the way, but doesn&#39;t roll over
    and die, either.

    the German magazine H=F6rzu used it, horror on the eyes. &#41; Other than = that
    ANY font by Lucas is well worth ist money, you&#39;ll never regret spending your
    money on him :-&#41;. I cannot think of another European Font Designer with as
    much flair and a taste for readable and practical, yet very unique and individual
    fonts. Luc&#40;as&#41;, in my humble opinion, is one of the finest typographers
    on the continent, with a sense of sleek and pure functionality and a wild streak
    that leads to monstrous gigantic families and hundreds of extra characters and
    thousands of kerning pairs... And on lucasfonts.com we just see the fonts on sale,
    there&#39;s a bit more he did for corporate designs, like the Volkswagen Futura
    riff, a Multiple Master with old style figures... Coolest Futura ever :-&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>Also very good, if you work with InDesign, albeit not as unique as Lucas

  body: 'FF Info.  <BR>VERY nice font, typical Spiekermann, a mix of Meta and Officina
    sensibilities. But be careful: The info, you can&#39;t see this as clear on he
    web, is very rounded, as it was designed for the Duesseldorf International Airport
    and was to be used in backlighted signs and displays. So it has a very unique
    feel, and after a time of using it as nodesign&#39;s house-font, I got very very
    tired of it, especially as it isn&#39;t really a good font for longer text. &#40;Well,
    duh.. the new CD font we use is FF DIN, not much better to read when it comes
    to long texts, but at least clearer and colder... and better suited for the steel
    engraving we use on our letterheads and biz cards&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Bliss is cool

    Neufville looks more Art Deco, but Luc somehow captured the cleaner, more geometric
    and practical aspect of the Futura. While it doesn&#39;t feel as historical, maybe,
    it just fits better into the context and it is MUCH better for practical purposes,
    at it doesn&#39;t feel as jarringly old-fashioned. Such a shame I cannot use that
    font in any commercial work at all, as it is licensed to Volkswagen exclusively. '

    offer that since my organization is a nonprofit &#40;or &#34;charity,&#34; as
    they apparently say in Britain&#41;, he would charge me the normal price &#40;100

    could print my posters and postcards. <BR> <BR>I understand and completely sympathize
    that creating high-quality typefaces is difficult and is worth good money, but
    this was really disappointing, not to mention out of line with most other foundries&#39;
    prices. I guess I&#39;ll be going with something else.

  body: 'I don&#39;t know why Emigre fonts mostly leave me cold. I never seem to have
    projects that Emigre fits nicely, at least in my opinion. I appreciate their craft,
    but their designs just don&#39;t usually speak to me, with the notable exception
    of Triplex Sans Condensed, but I would never set text in Triplex Sans, so I&#39;m
    out of luck for this project. Quelle bummer. <BR> <BR>FF Meta, on the other hand,
    seems to be gaining interest for me. Info, as HD pointed out, has a softness to
    it that may ultimately undo it for me, plus that the romans and the italics are
    in two different sets, as opposed to separated by weight. I don&#39;t understand
    people sometimes. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s the lowdown on the Impact logo -- I didn&#39;t
    design it so much as redesign it. Originally it was like this: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/7151.jpg"
    alt="impact old"> <BR> <BR>And I never really cared for it that much. The old
    artistic director &#40;as opposed to an art director&#41; made it. So when I came
    on board, I just wasn&#39;t using it on posters, and no one seemed to notice.
    <BR> <BR>Then I came up with a different direction: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/7152.jpg"
    alt="impact revision"> <BR> <BR>But it turned out, they liked their logo and didn&#39;t
    want to go too far afield. &#40;Plus, I&#39;ll admit, Bell Gothic is a bit overused
    these days.&#41; So I fused the two into a solution I can live with: <BR> <BR><img
    src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/7153.jpg" alt="impact"> <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;m mostly happy with it, but it&#39;s really hard to use. I&#39;m currently
    trying to get them to agree to a fundraising idea where we just have t-shirts
    with the logo without the splat, and people can pay to shoot a paintball gun at
    their shirt and make their own splats. Could be fun.'
