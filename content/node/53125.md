    mod for thread necromancy. Wonder why. :straight-faced:\r\n\r\nAside: Thread necromancy
    is the act of reviving old threads. It's very easy to forget or never notice that
    a thread is past its sell-by date when one gets deep into the reading, especially
    with weak or no telltales. I still don't know what's the best telltale, probably
    a reasonably well-sized \"Last post: ### ago.\" just above the submit button."
