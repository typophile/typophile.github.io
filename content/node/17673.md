body: So it seems that I for some reason have a large number of fonts that are either
  missing their postscript printer or display partner. What is the easiest, and most
  cost effective way of rebuilding the missing font data fork and and pairing them
  together again?

  body: "\"missing font data fork\" is quite the misnomer, but appears to indicate
    that you're talking about Mac OS PostScript Type 1 fonts.  If that's the case,
    and you still have the Type 1 font, you're in luck - many Mac OS X applications
    will use that without a \"screen\" or \"display\" font.  Older QuickDraw-based
    applications will not, but some newer ones will.\r\n\r\nIf you have the Type 1
    font, go look at the vendor's Web site - many of them make at least one bitmap
    suitcase available free of charge.  Adobe's old \"Type on Call\" CDs included
    free bitmap fonts (up to 24 point) for all of their Type 1 fonts, because without
    the PostScript fonts, you couldn't get high-resolution output anyway.  You might
    be able to download or request a vendor suitcase that solves your problem.\r\n\r\nIf
    you're missing the Type 1 part, good luck - that's the part they never give away.
    \ If you have a receipt, some vendors might let you have a new copy of the font,
    or send a replacement disc, but most probably won't.  With luck, you're only missing
    bitmap fonts, and those are easier to replace.\r\n\r\n--Matt"

  body: I may be stating the obvious, but you could always talk to the vendor from
    whom you licensed the type to begin with. Perhaps they'll give you new versions.

  body: sorry for the confusion. I know type from the design end, not the software
    end, i'm still learning. apparently I have a mixed lot, some of my fonts are missing
    their postscript pairs, which I am understanding I will more than likely not be
    able to get, were as the ones that are only missing their bitmap or screen partners
    will likely be able to be attained. Thanks for your advice, and I will try to
    contact the vendor.
