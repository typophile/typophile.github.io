  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I think that the first two Adobe latin character set have the same characters of Windows and Mac default western encodings, but also adds another characters like the minus sign, the L with stroke (or L with slash), the estimated symbol and the litre symbol. Anyone knows why? I can figure some thought, but I&rsquo;m specially intrigued by the L with stroke inclusion, since it seems that the languages that use it aren&rsquo;t supported by the sets, because them lacks another characters.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The default Mac and Windows western encodings are not the same. And then Adobe had a mind of its own. So, Unicode was invented to reconciliate all of them. At this day and age, it&rsquo;s probably a bad idea to constrain yourself to one or another 256-byte character map.</p>
<p>As for &ldquo;why&rdquo;, Apple, Microsoft, and Adobe are all three American firms, and were most likely just guessing which characters they had to include :-) The basic range of accented characters is quite random.</p>

<p>I would imagine that the people determining the basic Mac character set wanted to include enough bits and pieces to set every European Latin script language, and they almost* did. It was then up to the software designers to figure out how to utilize the components.</p>
<p>The reason that lslash and Lslash were included as precomposed glyphs would have been because there was no point in including just the &ldquo;slash accent&rdquo; by itself, as it only appears in these two characters, at different angles.</p>
<p>*comma-below for Romanian and caron for d, l, and t in Slovak are missing&ndash;perhaps they thought a scaled and repositioned comma would suffice.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I&rsquo;m pretty sure that putting the Lslash and lslash (and several other characters) into the low ASCII locations in the Mac character set was not an Apple thing, but a hybrid encoding introduced by Fontographer to make it easier to create fonts that could be targeted to either Mac or Windows. The extra characters are from Windows ANSI and Adobe Standard Encoding that are not included in the basic Mac Roman character set. You won&rsquo;t see these characters included in any Apple developer docs showing the Mac Roman character set.</div>
