  body: The the name of the company is actually Moment A/S <BR> <BR>All I can give
    you is a couple of names from the colophon <BR>and <a href="http://www.moment.dk/Kommunikation/indhold.aspx?action=navigate&amp;pageid=81"
    target="_blank">this</a> link. Whoever designed the magazine should do <BR>something
    about the &#40;lack of&#41; website... <BR> <BR>At first glance the typeface made
    me think of some of the <BR>work made by <a href="http://www.kontrapunkt.dk/flash.html"
    target="_blank">Kontrapunkt</a> or <a href="http://www.e-types.dk/Default_uk.asp?artikelID=11&amp;nav=&amp;print="
    target="_blank">e-Types</a>... <BR> <BR>I can post more samples, but not much
    more info... <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif" border=0>

  body: Nicolai, <BR>I followed your e-types link out of curiosity and their <a href="http://www.playtype.com/"
    target="_blank"> mdd</a> font seems to <BR>at least be very close. I mean I can&#39;t
    really make out much detail from the <BR>e-types sample image provided, but letterforms
    seem to match up as <BR>best I can tell. <BR> <BR>Maybe it&#39;s actually way
    off ... <BR> <BR>Is it just me, or is that font navigation method rather unintuitive?
