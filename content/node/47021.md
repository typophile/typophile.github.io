  never really developed a full font. I am wondering which is the best program for
  developing fonts? Thanks"

  body: "There are two (i was on the same step as you, graphic designing for a fair
    while, and still designing) but the one i use is Fontlab and i think it is the
    best...\r\nAnyway, you should give a look at some books too because most of the
    work is made by hand and not on the computer.\r\n\r\nJoel Santos // youremin\r\nsound

  body: Don't forget FontForge (Joel, was that your 2nd choice?). It's free, and looks
    great -- if you get it running, that is. Sadly, on my Win XP + Cygwin it crashes
    a bit too much for my liking.

  body: "Yes was my second choice, it's a software talked around here. But i don't
    know, i never tried it, and my \"tutor\" showed to me FontLab, started to use
    FontLab, so... I don't know.\r\nYou still have that website... really basic website
    not much to do on it, kind of modular base. What is it called? I think it is from
    linotype...\r\nAnyway, i still with my idea, 90% of hand-draw and 10% of digital
    work.\r\n\r\nJoel Santos // youremin\r\nsound & visual"
