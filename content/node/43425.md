  element to insert into the Periodic Table; I want it to look as identical as possible
  to the other ones on this particular table. Can somebody help me find the font names
  and styles (bold, etc.) for each of the different data fields? It may be more difficult
  because some of the fields - boiling point, atomic weight, etc. - only include numbers;
  I don't know, I know nothing about fonts...\r\n\r\nIf you guys could help me out
  by identifying as many as you can (if there are in fact more than one) that would
  be great.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDaniel"
