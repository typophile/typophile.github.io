body: "Hello all,\r\n\r\nI work with fonts in my spare time.\r\nThe most work I do
  is editing original fonts, but sometimes I make ones.\r\nThis my latest release,
  <b>MF Dots Pro</b>:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mfdotspro_5158.png]\r\n\r\n\_\r\nThis
  is the second font I've made completely by my self.\r\nMF Dots was done in 2007,
  containing only Latin. Now I've extended it with much more glyphs. Maybe I post
  my other self-made fonts also.\r\n\r\nYou can download a free-for-personal-use beta
  version from [[http://flitskikker.fl.funpic.org/downloads/server/files/15102008/225016/MF%20Dots%20Pro.zip|here]].\r\n\r\nSpecifications:\r\n-
  TrueType format\r\n- 3 weights (Light, Regular, Bold) + Italics\r\n- 653 glyhps
  per file\r\n- Contains Latin, CE, Greek, Baltic, Turkish, Romanian, Cyrillic and
  special symbols.\r\n<!--break-->\r\n\r\nPlease rate. :)\r\n\r\n\_\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nPlease
  note, that I'm a beginner in making fonts.\r\nI used Font Creator Program 5.6 for
  this typeface, so don't expect high detail, OT features, etc. I have some really
  cool ideas for fonts, but I just don't know how to convert them to real fonts. This
  simple (dot-based) font I almost the only font you could make with FCP. I have FontLab
  installed, but don't know how to use it.\r\nMay I post some drawings of these fonts
  so you can give tips how to make real fonts of it?\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n
  \r\n\_\r\nThanks in advance, and enjoy MF Dots Pro!\r\n\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nMartijn

  body: "Nice work, Martin. \r\n\r\nLike for me, very good for the first font. Special
    thanks for Cyrillic.\r\n\r\nI think you must change in Greek some glyphs, as illustrated\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/greek_6500.gif]"

  body: "Thanks for your reply.\r\nI think I'll compress those Greek chars a bit,
    so that they reach the x-height.\r\nI won't fix the \"i\", as this is a monospaced
    font.\r\n\r\nAbout MF: In this design it's impossible. All chars needs to be max
    5x7 dots, as based on the original LED displays.\r\n\r\nI'll look for some FLS
    tutorials, so I can add OpenType features, small caps, etc.\r\n\r\nI discovered
    some more mistakes that must be fixed. ;)\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nMartijn"
