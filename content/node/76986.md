  most of the related discussions related to what I am asking here, so I hope it is
  not a repetition of some already asked questions.\r\n\r\n1. I am asking myself if
  there is any difference in quality between the Franklin Gothic Fonts by URW Foundry
  and ITC. The former you can get rather for a low price and the latter for the standard
  prize. After having bought some basic professional fonts, I can only invest in one
  more Gothic font and if the quality of the URW Fonts are not much of a difference
  to the ITC Fonts, I could afford also the compressed and extra compressed fonts.
  However, if the quality is too low, than for me it would be better to have few good
  quality fonts than a lot of low quality fonts. (I am no professional but have to
  do with some minor publications (and websites which sometimes require texts (PDF
  Files)), and I want to set these texts with quality fonts.\r\n\r\n2. I am looking
  for companions for Whitman\u2014a very nice typeface which I bought based mainly
  on the specimen made by the designer and the discussion here. (Initially I had in
  mind to buy either Arno or Warnock.)  As far as I can see Franklin Gothic and Benton
  Sans are recommended companions, there was one argument that Verlag might be compatible
  but no real recommendation to use it. Are there any other combinations which could
  work with Whitman except those three? What about Gotham or Akzidenz Grotesk? I was
  thinking it might be better to buy Akzidenz Grotesk instead of Franklin Gothic but
  if it could not combined with Whitman it would reduce my desire to buy it. On the
  other hand AG is so much praised, if it is by far better than Franklin Gothic, this
  would again increase my wish to buy AG. I am doubting what is the right choice...\r\n\r\n3.
  Do you have any recommendation with what fonts Hypatia Sans could be paired? It
  is a very nice typeface but appears so unique that it is hard for me to be sure
  with what serif or sans fonts it could be combined. Any suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks
  a lot for your input,\r\nmick\r\n\r\n"

    had increased x-heights, so they were not "faithful" reproductions of the originals,
    which you may or may not give a rat's patootie about. However, overall quality
    of ITC and URW fonts is comparable.

    as Bureau Grot and Fedra Sans; it's a fascinating, multi-faceted typeface, and
    different pairings can also bring out different ones of its aspects / character
    traits. So if you can tell us more about where you're trying to take this, that'd
    help.\r\n\r\nAs for Franklin, the ITC version (assuming we're talking about <a
    href=\"http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/ITCFranklin/\">the rather new one also
    available from Font Bureau</a>) is actually not as bloated in the x-height region
    as many ITC fonts are, and I must say I wouldn't know any reason to not recommend
    it."

  body: "Thank your very much so far for your time and advice. I will check Alright
    Sans\u2014which came to my attention already but I didn't investigate this font
    closer. I will also check Sensibility.\r\n\r\nThe audience is usually in the context
    of either religious texts or academic analysis in the context of religion. There
    is no business behind it all is done or given for free, but this should be no
    excuse to not setting the texts as best as possible. At the moment I am working
    on a prayer book. Sometimes the text is an academic analysis or a summery of a
    specific tricky topic which might be interesting for a broader public to be read.
    \r\n\r\nSo far with respect to the subject matter and audience. It should be good
    enough for academics/researcher and religious people and the fonts should support
    the credit or quality the texts are felt to possess. In future a project like
    a small magazine might be an option too.\r\n\r\nWhen Sanskrit Fonts are needed
    I found a solution. There is a nice Palatino Font which is offered for free: http://www.columbia.edu/~ph2046/RnD/Hackett/Sanskritfonts.html\r\n\r\nIn
    one context I combined Whitman with Avenir and Benton Sans which appeared to be
    a good choice. The Franklin/AG question is rather if there is one font to be taken
    for future purposes which font would be the better choice or if Franklin from
    URW is similar good in quality than ITC or FB's / Adobe's version of it. \r\n\r\nThe
    Alright Sans Font font seems to be quite what I think I could use very much in
    the contexts I work and for future projects. Franklin and AG were options so far
    rather because they are classics, and Franklin was suggested to be used with Whitman;
    but now having had a closer look on Alright Sans, this font appears to be more
    suited and also more warm to my eye than AG or Franklin."

    figures. Alright Sans has them. This font looks also more \"human\" to me than
    AG or Franklin. I assume both latter fonts have superior figures too, havne't
    they? \r\n\r\nMy tendency goes now really to Alright Sans. I work mainly with
    Apple's Pages but if required I would shift to InDesign. For the time being pages
    does what I need."

    Sans: http://2krogh.dk/bibles/#/il-bibbja. I was surprised by how well it worked.
    I think Hypatia is a great choice for religious material, actually.\r\n\r\nAs
    for what Hypatia Sans goes with, I agree that it depends on context. I probably
    wouldn't pair it with a serif body face that was too aggressively modern (Bodoni,
    Walbaum, Melior). But other than that, it's fairly flexible. I think it tends
    to go well with oldstyle typefaces and have used it with Arno several times.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

    Devan\u0101gar\u012B (although, I\u2019m not sure this component has been released
    . . . Dan?). I think it would be stylistically compatible with Whitman, although

  body: "Another question came up which I couldn't clarify reading some articles about
    it: \r\n\r\nDoes Apple's Pages fully support the use of all the features OpenType
    Fonts have to offer? Until now I used pages and the cmd+T option from MacOSX 10.6.5
    to get access to the different stylesets of Hypatia Sans for instance. Now I am
    wondering if this way is too limited and finally maybe even too complicated to
    take full advantage of the OTF features and if it were better to buy InDesign
    or QuarkExpress. \r\n\r\nWhat I could find out is that Mellel is a word processor
    which allows to take full advantage of OTF but has its own limitations too. However,
    this might be an option in case Pages is too limited. What do you think?\r\n\r\nYour
    advice is highly welcomed. (I worked so far mainly in the domain of websites,
