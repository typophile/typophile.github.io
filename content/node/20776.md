body: "Hi Guys,\r\n\r\nA new client has approached me to design a new logo/identity
  for her Interior Design company called \"Modern Spaces\".\r\nHer work is incredible
  and is very minimalist with a focus on custom made surroundings.\r\n\r\nAnyway-
  she has provided my with the following sample of particular typefaces she likes.
  (attached)\r\n\r\nI'm wondering if any one can name them?  : )\r\n\r\nI'm stoked
  they aren't Arial! \r\nAlso while we are at it what are some of your all time favorite
  contemporary type faces?\r\n\r\nI'm looking into \"FF Din\" where would I find the
  history behind this font.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\nJason\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font_1_6015.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/font_2_3879.jpg]"

    is overused, there are many fresh alternatives out there worth considering.\r\n\r\nAs
    for IDing these samples, the top one could be custom as the E looks optically
    odd. :^P"
