    agree with the classification nomenclature."

    afraid, I haven't. But keep in mind that I'm a product of the desktop publishing
    revolution, which, in Italy, wiped out almost all the traditional specialised
    nomenclature trough bad or inexistent translations.\r\nMaybe Antonio Cavedoni
    (http://typophile.com/user/8976), which I gather have a vastly greater historical
    knowledge than mine, could give you some further insight.\r\n\r\nBy the way, it
    would be interesting to know if the term was used in later Nebiolo specimens."

  body: "Here is a couple of references I have found in my library about the Italian
    \u201CEtrusca\u201D typefaces. They show how the same name was given, in different
    times, to very different typefaces.\r\n\r\nThe first is taken from \u201CQuestioni
    di carattere\u201D, a 1997 book a book Italian 20th century Italian typography,
    written by Manuela Rattin and Matteo Ricci. An \u201CEtrusca\u201D typeface was
    quoted, among others, by designer Carlo Frassinelli in 1921, as a \u201Cnew\u201D
    typographic way, linked to the the Liberty style; in Frassinelli\u2019s view,
    the Etrusca, crafted by Augusta foundry in 1910s, is a loose, dynamic typeface,
    able to set a certain \u201Cmovement\u201D to the printed page (a feature most
    seeked by the Futurism typography). Here is the typeface from the 1910 Augusta
    foundry catalogue \u2013 the Art Nouveau influence is noticeable:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/augusta02_6329.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
    other reference is from a 1969 printed specimen, by Fonderia Tipografica Cooperativa,
    which was founded in Milan in 1886. The specimen was designed by Umberto Fenocchio,
    who worked at Nebiolo with Aldo Novarese, and features severals typefaces, some
    of them designed by Fenocchio himself (like \u201CLinea\u201D), others most likely
    from the Monotype or Nebiolo catalogues. The specimen features two similar sans
    serif typeface families named \u201CEtruria\u201D and \u201CEtrusco\u201D, grounded
    in the Grotesk tradition. Etruria came in light, book, demi, bold, black, light
    italic, bold italic (approximate transalation of Italian terms); \u201CEtrusco\u201D
    was a different, condensed sans (for titling?), in light, book, bold, bold extracondensed,
    extrablack.\r\n\r\nHere they are:\r\n\r\nETRURIA:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/etruria01_5185.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/etruria_4099.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nETRUSCO

  body: "Yes, thanks, Nicola, for adding this information.\r\n\r\nI'm interested in
    puzzling out the first example, particularly. This \"Augusta\" foundry, I have
    gathered, was the name for a while given to merged Italian foundries including
    Nebiolo. In fact, the name also appeared on the cover of the specimen book that
    I cited in my blog entry. I don't think there was a date on that book - I took
    the \"ca. 1910\" from the Harvard catalogue information. So in other words your
    example and mine issued from the same people right around the same time (though
    I don't think the specimen books are the same). \r\n\r\nHave you seen the entire
    page from which that first image was taken, or was the excerpting done by Rattin
    & Ricci source? I ask because by \"Etrusca\"'s placement as a header and next
    to the word \"Serie,\" I'm led to wonder if the label was also intended to refer
    to other, different fonts on the page. \r\n\r\nThat's an interesting font - I
    can see it used as signage for a tiki bar!"

    to merged Italian foundries including Nebiolo.\"\r\n\r\nYou are right, Craig.
    Rattin and Ricci's book give the same information: Augusta was established in
    1908 by Nebiolo and Urania foundries and soon came to gather fourteen different
    foundries: Nebiolo, Urania, Paolo Alb\xE9 and son, Filippo Fiazza, Carlo Radaelli,
    Francesco Rizzi, F. Zappa, Wilmant L., Baccigaluppi & C., Ferdinando Negroni,
    Rayper & C, Fratelli Alessandri, Cucco & Gorigli and Dell'Orto. It seems that
    common specimens were also printed. The image I posted was published in Rattin
    and Ricci's book. It was originally printed, I believe, in the already mentioned
    1910 Augusta specimen, then re-printed by Frassinelli in his 1921 piece on \"Il
    Risorgimento Grafico\", titled \"Rivoluzione Grafica (I)\". The other featured
    typefaces - all in the same Art Nouveau/Liberty vein - are Lisbona, Minerva and
    Electa. I'll post the complete image as soon as I can.\r\n\r\n"

    doing this research in spare time) I can say the term \u201Cetruschi\u201D used
    to be quite common in Italy to indicate generically all kinds of industrial-age
    sans-serif alphabets.\r\n\r\nMost of the samples you provided are from the ubiquitous
    German typeface which is mostly known as \"Aurora\" (from the C.E. Weber foundry)
    in its original incarnation. I have still to track down which was the first version.
    In Italy, we have had our \"customized\" version, Cairoli, which was also copied
    and copied (\"Etruria\" here is an example of these \"copies of a copy\")."
