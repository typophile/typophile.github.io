body: "Hi, I am developing a nastaliq font, which requires two individual spaces:
  one for arabic script, other for latin. So questions is, how do I do it in ms volt?
  I have already tried substituting space -> arabic_space and placed it in ccmp. This
  solution works fine for MS products, but not for adobe cs5 me.\r\nAny alternatives?
  Also tried kerning space, but that is not the good solution... :)"

  body: "Good question. I suspect that Adobe's layout engine is not doing substitutions
    on the space glyph. If that's the case, and you don't want to kern it, I'm not
    sure I have any other suggestions.\r\n\r\nI will note that a more appropriate
    glyph name would be \"space.arabic\"; the glyph name \"arabic_space\" suggests
    that it is a ligature of the \"arabic\" glyph and the \"space\" glyph. There are
    some paths to PDF creation where this naming could cause problems for later text
    recovery.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Thank you sir!\r\nBtw, if i do use kern, exactly where its table should be
    added? On latin script or arabic? My last tests shows that adding kern.space on
    latin script isnt recognized on microsoft products. However, adobe indesign is
    handling it fine.\r\nAnother option could be; not adding any latin glyphs in the
    font. But that might trigger many problems when applying underline, bold etc,
    later... :)"

    things that ought to work in OpenType that are not fully supported in all environments,

    And yes it works now on all platforms.
