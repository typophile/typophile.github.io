  this font used in a Logo which has been created years ago. Font search engines can't
  find the correct font, I guess with only 6 letters it is not very easy either.\r\n\r\nI
  hope someone can Identify this font. \r\nThanks in advance to everyone willing to
  give it a shot ;-)\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nFr\xE9d\xE9ric\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Cambio
