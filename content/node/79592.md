  anyway I've been enamored with this font for a while now and want to use it for
  a chest piece I'm getting soon, and I was wondering if anyone had an idea of what
  font this could be. \r\nI hope not to offend anyone with the barely dressed in the
  picture. I really just need to identify the font.\r\n\r\n "

    the script face on the belly \r\n- the pic is a tad too small to see the details
    of the blackletter\r\n- there may not be an exact digital equivalent; the tattooer
    might have adapted/simplified an exisiting typeface for the medium\r\n\r\nHaving
    said that, [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/classic/abby/|Abby]] seems to be in
    the ballpark."

  body: Wow really sorry about the confusion. I'm trying to identify the font right
    below his belly button. I'm really just trying to find something similar to what
    he has so I can show my tattoo artist.

  body: "Have a look at [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/buffet-script/|Buffet
    Script]] from Studipos. Look at some of the other Studipos scripts. Search for
    \"tattoo script\" for some other options.\r\n\r\nMake sure your tattooist can
    spell. The poor guy in the photo has to live with \"Foreuer\" across his belly,
    and I've never seen \"Phantom\" spelt with two h's either. Also make sure they
    are good at lettering. Typographically, that script is a bit of a mess with its
    irregular stem widths. Compare the first e to the later ones. I realise a lot
    of conventions in tattoo lettering go against typographic rules, such as all-caps
    blackletter and scripts, or that traditional sailor A with the heavy stroke on
    the left."
