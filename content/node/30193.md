  questions. Here is my first design:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Religional_3871.png]\r\n\r\nThe
  institute owned by Islamic clerics that answers Islamic question by email, phone
  and oral. I would like to hear your opinions (any) about this logo\r\n\r\nThank
  you"

  body: "I don't know enough about Islam to comment on your choice of symbols/characters
    and I would think that those are of primary importance for a logo of this kind.
    Therefore I can only comment on its aesthetics and exectution.\r\n\r\nI like it,
    but...\r\n\r\nI think the three elements (frame / three characters / star) need
    harmonizing. They each look like they are in a different style and would be better
    if they were all drawn with the same 'brush' with the same stroke thickness and
    sharpeness or roundness.\r\n\r\nThe frame is inconsistent in itself. The seven
    arches are rounded at their base and apex (and a bit wobbly) whereas the bottom
    point is sharp, and if it's a book spine it needs some width.\r\n\r\nThe overall
    dimensions are rather square. It may look more elegant if it was taller, maybe
    with the dimensions of an archway.\r\n\r\nThe left and right characters (?) are
    a bit too close to frame. Maybe have those two less angled so the three of them
    form a more slender vertical shape.\r\n\r\nOn the frames bottom left and right
    corners the inside curve needs a smaller radius so the line doesn't appear to
    get thicker there.\r\n\r\nHope these comments are of some help.\r\n"

  body: What about a cresent and a star? That symbolises Islam more than the star
    on its own. The strokes just seem too heavy. I think more experimentation may
    be needed in regards to that. The flames portray a 'heated debate' to me. I don't
    know why but it's creating tension for me. Sorry but this is the truth. Just trying
    to help you in making it better.

  body: "Mamouri: I wouldn't worry about the 3 characters being mistaken for flames.
    They aren't very flame like. I'm guessing you have used them because they are
    a significant Arabic letter and they also look like the stroke of a question mark.\r\n\r\nMissgiggles:
    I think a crescent and star would not be very original in Iran or the Muslim community.\r\n"

  body: "Is the institute intended to answer questions from Muslims or non-Muslims
    or Arabic speakers or non-Arabic speakers? \r\nIs there going to be any type connected
    to it or should it work on its own? \r\nDoesn't Arabic uses a mirror image of
    the question mark?\r\n\r\nI like the architectural qualities of the star and question
    marks, I feel the arches/petals should probably also be treated in a sharp-edged
    way, rather than rounded, there are certain inconsistencies in the execution,
    especially of the arches/petals, which will need to be ironed out. It might be
    easier to read/understand if there were only one question mark, do you have a
    reason why there are three?\r\n\r\nTim"
