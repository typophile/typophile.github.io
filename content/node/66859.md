body: "I run on Windows XP Pro. Over the last few years I've been \"collecting\" some
  good quality OpenType fonts, many from P22 Type Foundry in their \"PRO\" format.
  The \"PRO\" .otf files include a lot of the special characters: ligatures, glyphs,
  swash caps. small caps, etc., etc.\r\n\r\n<strong>Problem: The <em>Windows Character
  Map accessory program </em> will only show me the <em>standard</em> 256 characters
  usually included in .ttf fonts.</strong>\r\n\r\nI use a page layout program (Serif
  PagePlus X3) that is able to display and implement a font's special characters.
  But, having to open large, fullblown software just to view a character's map is
  ponderous.\r\n\r\n<strong>So, can anyone recommend a SUPER Character Map</strong>
  that will show fonts' special characters above and beyond the first 256; hopefully,
  enabling the user to see the fonts' \"information\" and permitting the copying and
  pasting of individual characters and symbols a'la the Windows Character Map.\r\n\r\nThanks,
  Jim"

    and will give them a trial look.\r\n\r\nI can't get the Windows Character Map
    to show me much. I get it into \"Unicode mode\" and I get a separate dropdown
    off to the side showing the special \"areas\" in the \"map\". But, the \"cells\"
    above the 255th are all filled with a generic placeholder character (an empty
    square) or are empty.\r\n\r\nI guess I have to learn a bit more about how font
    files are structured if I'm going to really understand \"the problem.\" For instance,
    I'm wondering how any software knows how/when/where to \"exchange\" ligatures
    for certain character sequences if the font's ligatures are not mapped.\r\n"

  body: "<cite> .. For instance, I'm wondering how any software knows how/when/where
    to \"exchange\" ligatures for certain character sequences if the font's ligatures
    are not mapped.</cite>\r\n\r\nThat's actually very simple. For non-OTF fonts,
    a program cannot know the position of <em>any</em> ligature at all, except \"fi\"
    and \"fl\". These are defined in the standard character mappings -- even in Unicode,
    although nowadays that's considered a judgment error.\r\nIf a program sees a font
    has characters on position \"0xde\" and \"0xdf\", it might use these as \"fi\"
    and \"fl\". Now usually, font designers stick to this position convention, but
    there are always some that put other characters in that place. So, with lots of
    \"old\" Type 1 fonts, you have to actually disable ligatures with a modern program
    such as InDesign.\r\n\r\nOpenType fonts solve this possible problem two-way: first,
    rather than a position, all glyphs (as characters are called in this context)
    are defined by a unique number -- their Unicode value. It's also possible not
    to assign a Unicode at all, or one in the Private Use Area; this in case the 'glyph'
    is a ligature that's not defined in Unicode. The other way is that the font itself
    contains the information which characters can be combined into which ligatures.\r\n\r\nAs
    for your empty Character Map: well, not every font contains all those characters
    -- and Windows itself is quite unsure which fonts do and which ones don't ...
    If you select a font such as Arial, Arial Unicode, or Times New Roman, you should
    see lots and lots of characters beyond 255."

    note that of course any font is limited in its Unicode coverage, so when you see
    squares it doesn't mean Character Map isn't working, it just means the font you're
    looking at simply doesn't have those characters.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    thoughts:\r\n\r\n<strong>BabelMap</strong> is definitely worth having on your
    computer. It's small; is not even <em>installed</em> in the normal Windows sense,
    and you can't beat the price ($0.00)! Its UI is not elegant -- good for analysis
    in depth -- not so much for using \"open on the side\" while composing a doc in
    MS Word.\r\n\r\n<strong>PopChar</strong> has a more polished and efficient UI.
    The trial version grays out most of a font's characters so it's a mite tough to
    be <em>totally sure</em> that PopChar is showing me <strong>all</strong> the available
    characters.\r\n\r\nPopChar's big selling point is its ability to enable you, fairly
    automatically, to select a \"special character\" in PopChar and have that character
    be instantly inserted \"back\" in MS Word or whatever program you're working in.
    It <strong>did</strong> do that, but I quickly determined that if I changed fonts
    and sizes while in PopChar, what was finally inserted \"back\" in my Word document
    was maybe not necessarily what I was expecting.\r\n\r\n<strong>MainType</strong>
    While googling around researching my super Char Map need I came across MainType.
    Besides doing a a spiffy job of showing all the Unicode characters, etc it is
    also appears to be a competent font manager.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have experience
    with MainType?\r\n"
