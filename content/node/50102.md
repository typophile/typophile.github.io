  this Gotham-y sans is from the <em>Four Christmases</em> one sheet?

  body: Very interesting. I don't find this Gothamesque, but it is almost a kind of
    modern Gill Sans. I'm interested in the answer if anyone can ID it.

  body: it's more than one font. <em>Christmases</em>, as well as the actors names
    and the copy, are set in [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/albany|Albany Bold]].
    <em>Four</em>, however, is not.

  body: <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/monotype/albany_std_virtual/?sample_text=FOUR%20Witherspoon">That's
    it!</a> Good work, fellas. I had forgotten all about Albany. Looks like WTF is
    on the fritz, or it's ignoring the Monotype stuff that MyFonts doesn't carry.

  body: Thanks folks! I did try WTF, but I figured the type samples just weren't big
    enough. It never occurred to me that they might not ID stuff they don't carry.
