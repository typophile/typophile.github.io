  to a foundry, is it legal for another foundry to name a font Big Serif? I know you
  folks aren't lawyers. I know that, were the situation to come up, I'd fold like
  a bad poker hand and change the name. \r\n\r\nI just want to hear your thoughts. "

    term \u201Cserif\u201D to be trademarked as the name for a font. I\u2019m pretty
    sure it doesn\u2019t pass the litmus tests."

  body: There already is a family called TheSerif. I have no idea if it is trademarked,
    or could be (in the US). On that basis, I'd bet you could use one word for the
    name, say BigSerif.

    and allow a generic common use word to be registered. Stranger things have happened.
    If not serif, some other generic word, like Heavy or Big, maybe Square. '

  body: "I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s an \u201Cofficial\u201D litmus test. Trademarks
    are characterized as \u201Cstrong\u201D or \u201Cweak\u201D based on a number
    of criteria. Generic marks are considered quite weak and must have other aspects
    going for them to qualify for protection.\r\n\r\nSome basic info here: http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/qualifying-trademark-protection-faq-29129.html\r\n\r\nBut
    really, you\u2019re asking questions that should be asked of an IP attorney."

    example. I guess it falls into the category of a dumb question. I'm good at those.

  body: "You could register the trademark \"Xxxx Serif\" but your registration would
    have to make clear that you are disclaiming any rights to Serif on its own. I
    own the registered trademark \"VF Sans\" but certainly have no right to the word
    \"Sans\" on its own. However if something is too descriptive of what it is, you
    will not be able to trademark the name. I once attempted to trademark the name
    5 X 7 for a typefont made up of dots on a 5 x 7 grid, and that application was
    rejected.\r\n\r\nThat said, hire an attorney!"

  body: "The only certainty I\u2019ve found within the U.S. legal system is that there
    are no certainties. This was made abundantly clear to me when I sat on a jury
    in a civil case. The law is very objective. The interpretation of it is not. That
    said, you could hire an attorney, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessary
    at this point in your hypothetical legal pursuit. I have a client who obtained
    the coveted \u201Ccircle-R\u201D from the USPTO for a new product. He also successfully
    pursued a cease and desist from someone who was diluting one of his existing trademarks
    by using a name that was too similar, a name which at that time didn\u2019t have
    the official \xAE protection. He used an online legal service along the lines
    of legalzoom.com to acquire the official USPTO registration at a cost of around
    $600 to $700. Hiring your own lawyer to pursue getting the USPTO trademark registration
    usually cost around twice that or more.\r\n\r\nWithout going the official route
    of registration and getting the \xAE, at some cost, you can declare a trademark
    by just placing the TM indicia on your product. I\u2019ve gotten into mild dust
    ups with some brand managers over that because it\u2019s not even legally required
    any more to use the TM, \xA9, or \xAE indicia. They insist though that the lawyers
    will have an easier time pursuing a case if the outright claim to ownership is
    staked on the logo or product. You can just stick the TM on anything as a declaration
    that you claim the trademark. Without the official registration though it\u2019s
    easily challenged by someone with a registered trademark who believes you\u2019re
    infringing on theirs. \r\n\r\nA case in point similar to your hypothetical example.
    The air cargo company here uses two generic terms, Federal Express as a registered
    trademark. I tend to think others in the air cargo company could use other generic
    combinations of those generic terms and withstand any legal challenge, e.g, Big
    Express, Blue Express, Federal Air Freight, etc. However, others in different
    businesses have been hammered by the FedEx lawyers for infringing on that registered
    trademark. One of the cases that got nationwide attention along those lines was
    the coffee shop in Syracuse that decided to trademark the name Federal Espresso.
    They were overwhelmed by FedEx\u2019s lawyers pursing legal action and I think
    are now called Freedom of Espresso. \r\n\r\nTake the above for what it\u2019s
    worth. I\u2019m no lawyer, but do have to play in the same sandbox with them from
    time to time. The question in fighting big trademark issues usually doesn\u2019t
    come down to right or wrong, rather who has the bigger shovel in the sandbox.
    The question for you (hypothetically) is how big of a shovel do you want to buy
    to own that name. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s also worth pointing out that with trademark
    law, it only last as long as you legally pursue ownership and work actively to
    protect against infringement, i.e., they do go stale and expire with neglect.
    That\u2019s why big brands like Coca-Cola, FedEx, Apple, etc. aggressively go
    after anything and everything that remotely looks like an infringement. "
