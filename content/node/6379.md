  <BR> <BR>This is a logo for a psychologic test for kids &#40;5-15 years&#41; regarding
  their ability on memory for faces. Thsi test will be simmilar to the image below:
  <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/47615.jpg" alt=""> <BR>
  <BR>The idea is to have this book spiral binded, with the photo in front of the
  kid and on the other side instructions for the one who gives the test, so this person
  has to turn the pages  revealing some faces and afterwards a composition of 3 photos
  and the kid has to point out the one he saw before. <BR> <BR>So, I came out with
  an identity that explores the idea of spiral binding, triangular basis with the
  same face on the 2 pages. <BR> <BR>The problem is that I&#39;ve always managed to
  get this &#34;3D&#34; perspectives right with the reflect tool on illustrator...
  until today <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"
  BORDER=0> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/47616.gif"
  alt=""> <BR> <BR>So, What I want is the faces looking on the same direction like
  the examples below, but I came out with a problem on getting the face on the right
  page. The top example was managed with reflect of the page&amp;face, but the face
  is looking on the opposite direction that I need. So, basically the face must fit
  the new page perspective and I&#39;ve failed miserably on this. I&#39;ve used the
  Shear tool on the 2nd row right, but it gives me a &#34;fake&#34; transformation
  effect. NExt I&#39;ve tried to manually adjust the face &#40;2nd row - left&#41;
  and this look better to me, but it&#39;s not &#34;totally right&#34;. <BR> <BR>Does
  illustrator can nail this? Any 3D expert out there? I can upload the .AI if necessary.
  <BR> <BR>Thanks.'

  body: Adriano, I&#39;m not sure I follow, but I can tell you that with the new 3D
    tools in Illustrator CS it is possible to place separate objects onto different
    surfaces and then rotate those in perspective. Does that help at all?

  body: couldn&#39;t you use --&#62; object pull-down &#62; transform &#62; shear
    ... keep track of the amount and then shear the other object negatively? <BR>

  body: I&#39;ve made that on the one that says transform&#62;shear. Somehow I&#39;m
    not convinced by that skew... Maybe I&#39;m doing something very wrong. Thanks

  body: 'Adriano: <BR> <BR>You have done a pretty good job already. The concept is
    there, the problem is that as a designer you have a better than average trained
    eye. You will never satisfy the optical correctness that you are looking for because
    the graphic doesn&#39;t use correct perspective. You are using a flat perspective
    that doesn&#39;t accurately convey depth. Even if you were using accurate perspective,
    the fact that one face is traveling away from the viewer while the other is traveling
    toward the viewer would create a visual distortion of the size relationship. <BR>
