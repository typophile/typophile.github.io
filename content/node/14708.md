body: "Does anyone know of a rule for the size/scale of a registered trademark symbol
  in both body copy and logo design? From what I can tell, the body copy registered
  trademark is larger proportionally than it would be in the logo version of the same
  term. For example the (R) after Coca-Cola is proportionally larger when it appears
  in body copy (superscripted) than when it appears (subscripted) in the Coca-Cola
  logo. Are there universal and legal minimums/maximums for each of these applications
  or is it entirely up to the designer and typesetter?\r\n\r\nAlso, does anyone know
  of a good book that deals specifically with print ad typography?\r\n\r\nAny feedback
  would be most appreciated."

    So its big on 9pt and very big if you set smaller text. On larger text sizes it
    becomes smaller. So you should choose a size for what your design best fits for
    - mostly body text or display. \r\n\r\nI think the R in the registered sign should
    have the same size (caps high) as the TM mark - but maybe it depends on personal
    taste. I see very often a different approach.\r\n\r\nLots of fonts don't care
    much about such issues and use a standard sign and size.\r\n\r\nmy suggestions
    to start from: \r\n(percentage of the caps high) \r\n\r\n4-8pt: bigger \r\n9-12pt:
    55 - 47%   \r\n16-28pt: 45 - 40%\r\n\r\n--<a href=\"http://www.astype.de\" target=\"_blank\">astype.de</a>--"

  body: 'I''m working on a logo design right now, where I''m supposed to add an registered
    (R). Does anyone no about any legal or typographic rules how to place the (R)?
    Can I place it anywhere close to the logo or does it have to be at the lower or
    upper right corner? Any certain rules about the size? Or is there a minimum percentage
    for the size in relation to the logo?  '

  body: "They just needs to be legible. I usually make them as small as I can, while
    still being legible.\r\n\r\nIn fact legally they aren't even mandatory at all,
    but they provide additional legal protection in case of a lawsuit. Here's a quote
    from the International Trademark Association:\r\n\r\n\"Use of the registration
    symbol or other statutory notice is not mandatory, but it is important not only
    because it provides notice of the owner's registration of the mark, but also because
    it allows the owner to assert certain types of damages in lawsuits against infringers.
    Failure to use a registration notice limits the remedies available to a trademark
    owner in a lawsuit...\"\r\n\r\nSo in other words, the government doesn't require
    them, but if company X sues company Y for infringement, the lawyer for company
    X can say, \"They should have known it was a registered trademark because we put
    the symbol on it.\""

  body: "> But it does actually have to be registered \r\n> to warrant the \xAE symbol\r\n\r\nYes,
    the International Trademark Association says:\r\n\r\n\"A \u2122 is usually used
    to indicate an unregistered trademark. It is an informal notification that there
    is a public claim as a trademark...\r\n\r\n\"The \xAE (commonly pronounced \"R-in-a-circle\"
    or \"Circle-R\") is a warning notice to advise the public that the mark is registered
    and their use provides legal benefits. This notice can be used only with registered
    marks. Use of a \xAE with any unregistered trademark may result in claims of fraud...\""

  body: "In fonts, the informal standard is that \"Registered\" and \"Copyright\"
    are cap-height.\r\n\"Trademark\" is generally rendered as a superscript, about
    the same relative size as other superiors such as figures and ordinals.\r\n\r\n\"Registered\"
    and \"Copyright\" are cap height, even thought they will be reduced in the main
    text, because they are also required in reference footnotes, so it is up to the
    typographer to superscript and downsize them for use in running text and logos:
    there are defaults for this in Quark and InDesign, around 60 -70 %, IIRC, which
    is therefore the de facto standard.\r\n\r\n\"Trademark\" is not cap height, because
    if it were, there is the likelihood it would be read as part of the preceding
    word, and be too wide in footnotes. So it can look too small in some footnotes.
    However, it doesn't require special superscript treatment by the typographer.\r\n\r\nFor
    logos, it's up to the discretion of the graphic designer/art director, but it's
    quite alright to make them very small, with the proviso, as Ben says, that if
    it is part of a logo that is going to be scaled, then the graphics standards for
    a corporation should provide different versions of the logo for use at different
    sizes.\r\n\r\nAFAIK, infringement has never been legally defended on the grounds
    that the infringer didn't see the mark because it was too small in a document,
    but I'm not a trademark lawyer, so perhaps it has happened!\r\n\r\nIn a few typefaces
    (such as those of my Modern Suite), there are alternate, optically scaled glyphs
    for \"Registered\" and \"Copyright\", accessible through the OpenType \"Superscript\"
    feature.\r\n\r\n"

    so I'm on the save side using the (R).
