body: "Hey everybody. :)\r\n\r\nA friend asked me to design a logo for his about-to-open
  firm. They're not in a rush, they have no money to spend and I'm a lazy unemployed
  unexperienced college graduate, so that was a match made in heaven if there ever
  was one (that's an exaggeration, I'm just madly trying to practice my english).\r\nSince
  I'm a typophile, my primary focus was, of course, the type. So what I'm looking
  for, here, is mostly any advice/tip/suggestion you nice folks might have to share
  regarding the type I designed for their logo and the kerning.\r\n\r\nIf you're curious
  as to what they do, that's a tough one... basicly, they are five people with different
  backgrounds (three engineers, one industrial designer and one marketeer) who plan
  to develop projects in different areas together and then get them to whoever might
  be interested in using them. (It's tough enough to explain even in portuguese, let
  alone in another language...)\r\n\r\nThey know it's quite a risky adventure, but
  they seem to be OK with that; so much so that they risk it more by using an english
  name (which, when read in portuguese, sounds something like a meaningless \"oontee\").
  So much so that they don't even mind asking ME to do their identity!\r\n\r\nAbout
  the kerning: I kerned it a bit on the loose side to improve legibility and also
  because kerning these forms (which I'm really pleased with, I must say) tightly
  is kind of difficult.\r\n\r\nAbout the symbol: basicly it's a mix of the inequation
  symbol (two of them, actually) \u2013 which represents the fact that they're not
  equal to anything else \u2013 and that little drawing we make when couting votes,
  for example (you know, \"||||\" with a diagonal line over it, representing five
  votes \u2013 look at the symbol at a 90\xBA angle and you'll see what I'm talking
  about).\r\n\r\nWithout further ado (but with a bit of fear)...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/newScreenshot_27_4912.jpg]\r\n\r\nAny
  comments regarding the widths of the letters and the strokes are also welcome.\r\n\r\nruD"

  body: I have no problem with the grey mark and the font is interesting, but for
    me the "e" and even the "i" could be kerned a bit tighter.

  body: "Although the dot on an \"i\" is often that high in a text face, it feels
    a bit awkward in a logo. I'd maybe drop it 1/3 of the distance to the top of the
    \"i\" stroke.\r\n\r\nVisually, the space between the u and the n is less than
    the others, I think. Either increase it or tighten the others.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Once you drop the dot on the i (a good idea) the gray mark needs repositioning
    (and perhaps even some scaling) \u2014 even now it's positioned a bit too high
    in relation to the lettering. I also think that the two =\u2019s need some work
    on the left side. The four oblique ends there cause a lot of unrest. On the right
    side this effect wouldn\u2019t harm.\r\n\r\nHope I have been clear enough ; )\r\n\r\n.

  body: "I think that there might be a difference in weight between the characters?
    Or so it seems, optically. 'U' and 'N' are quite heavy, then comes 't', which
    seems a little lighter, and then 'i' and 'e', which are even more light to my
    eyes. I don't know if this is what you wanted. If not, a little tweaking here
    and there wouldn't hurt. :)\r\nI think it makes it a bit restless, so to speak,
    and a little more uniformity might make the whole mark more harmonious."

  body: "Thanks, everyone!\r\n\r\nI perfectly see what everyone means about the kerning
    and weights...\r\nWhat makes this hard is that I'm using upper and lowercase forms
    together, which makes it difficult to kern and to make the weights match. We all
    know that kerning uppercase letters is quite different from kerning lowercase
    and there's always some kind of adjustment to make to the weights when mixing
    small caps with lowercase... so I think that's where most of this trouble comes
    from. So, with that in mind, does anyone else still have anything to say about
    those two problems? This really was hard for me (lots of tweaking was involved,
    I'm a bit of a perfectionist, and an inexperienced one, too), so more input will
    be appreciated. :)\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, regarding the dot on the lc I... I don't
    think I can drop it. It really is what makes the lc I form most recognizable,
    and this is a tough word for some portuguese people to read; I don't think I'll
    make it even harder on them. But I'll try it again later, thank you for the tip.
    :)\r\nNow about the height of the dot... actually, it comes from the mark. If
    you look closely, you'll see that everything is aligned: the bottom of the last
    horizontal line on the mark is aligned with the baseline of the lettering; the
    bottom of the second horizontal line is in line with the x-height; and the dot
    on the I is perfectly in line with the first horizontal line. That was how I got
    to the size of the mark and how it related to the lettering. I'm still looking
    at the mark for some improvement, but I thought the left side (those oblique ends
    Bert mentioned) gave it some charm and made it a bit more dynamic. Adding obliques
    on the right side instead (I did try it, before) made it too busy, because it
    clashed much more with the large oblique line... but even so, Bert, do you think
    the mark should be bigger or smaller? I didn't understand what you meant.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nruD"

  body: "Well, just to show you what I believe will be the final version.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/newScreenshot_31_5118.jpg]\r\n\r\nI'm
    really stubborn, so I didn't want to give up on that T having the upper part that
    much shorter \u2013 and more to the left \u2013 than the bottom curve, but I guess
    I just had to change that to give balance to the whole word. I believe it's much
    better, don't you?\r\n\r\nOh, and I dropped the dot on the I to align with the
    white space between the = on the top of the mark. It's a bit too close, but I
    guess it is a bit better than having it that far away as I did. There were also
    other minor adjustments.\r\n\r\nThank you! :)"

  body: I see you also slightly increased the weight on some of the letters. I think
    it looks much more balanced now, because of that. :)

  body: "Yes, I did. :)\r\n\r\nYou were right, the lowercase letters did seem a bit
    more fragile than the uppercase ones... when I showed the first version I'd already
    tried to correct that, but I just couldn't hit the \"sweet spot\"; they always
    looked a bit too fat or a bit too thin... so I tried a different approach.\r\nI
    can pretty much always see what's wrong \u2013 I think I'd thought about all the
    things everyone said about my first version, before \u2013, but then I still have
    a really hard time making the correct adjustments...\r\n\r\nAnd I still have a
    problem with the U, for example; that white space makes the top of the word seem
    too empty at the beginning... makes me want to push it closer to the N, but that
    makes everything else look just wrong. :P\r\n\r\nTweak tweak tweak... :P\r\nruD"
