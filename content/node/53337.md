  for in the Title Sequence for Beverly Hills Cop II (1987).\r\n\r\nI have looked
  through FontBook, but couldn't find anything exactly like this script. IdentiFont
  suggested Zhikharev by Igor Zhikharev, but it does not look identical: http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=zhikharev\r\n\r\nIf
  you have any ideas, please help. I have made a collection of screen dumps as a sample:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/beverly_hills_cop_5307.jpg]\r\n"
