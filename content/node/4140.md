  body: Is this even a font? It could very well be custom designed;  <BR>most newspaper
    nameplates are.

  body: Thanx, but I don&#39;t think its a custom designed font &#40;maybe a little&#41;,
    because the logo of Toppharm is the same. Only the T is different, but it doesn&#39;t
    matter <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/32746.jpg"

  body: The &#34;TopPharm&#34; logo doesn&#39;t look exactly the same, Steven. <BR>The
    serif at the apex of the &#34;A&#34; is missing and its cross-bar is  <BR>positioned
    higher. Also, the tail of the &#34;R&#34; moves away from the  <BR>stem at a greater
    angle in the &#34;TopPharm&#34; logo than in the mast  <BR>head. The contrast
    between thick and thin strokes and the angle  <BR>don&#39;t match neither.

  body: I know, I want a font with that kind of &#34;R&#34;, same style... I don&#39;t
    mind if it isn&#39;t exactly the same.

    Morris or Frederic Goudy.

    target="_blank">Goudy Modern</a> is in the ballpark. There are some differences,
    but the overall feel and some of the characters are very close. The long tail
    on an R is almost always a customization and not a difficult one. There are a
    few fonts with an R like this, but such a font will not likely match the style
    in the Prague Post masthead.
