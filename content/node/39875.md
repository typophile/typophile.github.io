  font which is used in many books such as published by Prentice Hall, McGraw-Hill,
  John-Wiley, etc.\r\nI try to get some information about the font by reading through
  the book.\r\nMostly, they said that the name of the font is Times Roman and 10/12
  point.\r\nI assume that the font is made by Monotype.\r\nSo, I contact them.\r\nThey
  do give me clear information.\r\nThen, I feel confidence to purchase a single Regular
  (or Book) style in TrueType format for PC and spent 26 GBP worth for it.\r\nHowever,
  this thing makes me so confuse after saw that the font name in the font dropdown
  list toolbar of MS Office Word 2003 is TimesNRMT!!!\r\nWhat is actually the difference
  between \u201CTimesNRMT\u201D and \u201CTimes-Roman\u201D font?\r\nOr, does font
  foundry of Times-Roman font is Monotype?\r\nIf yes, what the foundry name would
  be?\r\nLinotype?\r\nIf anyone here has them worked for GGS Information Service,
  Inc, do you mind if I purchase the font directly from you for sure?\r\n\r\nSECOND\r\nDoes
  anyone recognize this font (image is attached)?\r\nSimilar / closest font would
  be OK.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nTom\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/untitled_4184.GIF]"

    Roman is Linotype's version of the font which Monotype calls Times New Roman.
    There are minor differences, like you'd find in different cuts of any typeface,
    but they are essentially the same to my eyes.\r\n\r\n - Lex"
