body: Hi, <BR> <BR>I hope someone can help.  <BR> <BR>Does anyone know of a suitable
  classical typeface for use on print material &#40;at any size - body and headline&#41;?
  <BR> <BR>These are my closest references &#40;see jpg&#41;.... Trajan - way too
  clasical &#40;but rather lovely&#41;, Debenhams - owned by them so I can&#39;t use
  this &#40;and still too classical and &#39;thin&#39; &#41; and finally Mylius -
  owned by British Airways so unfortunately non-commercial but the closest to what
  I want. <BR> <BR>And I also need to buy both PC and Mac versions. <BR> <BR>Any suggestions
  at all are greatly appreciated. <BR> <BR>Many thanks in advance. <BR> <BR>Ged<img

  body: Beaufort, from Shinn Type, could fit the bill. I use it for a newsletter,
    where it handles display and text duties admirably. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/beaufort/"
