  I hope you could indentify for me. The white one in the middle of the pic and the
  gray one in the lower right part. Couldn&#39;t find any better pics than this, but
  you can see how they look. Hope you can help! <BR> <BR>fonts: <a href="http://dille.yagr.com/fontz.jpg"

  body: Thanks for your suggestions, but it wasn&#39;t those fonts as far as I can
    see. <BR> <BR>The house 3009 font looked like the lower right font, but the house
    3009 had... I&#39;m not sure what it&#39;s called, small strokes that finish the
    lines like in times new roman and other such fonts, which &#34;my&#34; font doesn&#39;t
    have. <BR> <BR>And I tried to search for dustbust fonts on google and downloaded
    all I found but I couldn&#39;t find any that looked like the font on &#34;minimalistix&#34;.
    Maybe I didn&#39;t find all dustbust fonts? I think I have seen that &#34;minimalistix&#34;
    font before, with circles around all letters, but I don&#39;t know where. I looked
    trough the font lists on my old computers, but couldn&#39;t find it there. <BR>
    <BR>But thanks a lot for trying to help!

  body: If you&#39;re referring to serifs &#40;as in Times Roman&#41; House 3009 Space
    Age Heavy definitely does NOT have those. Based on your sample it looks like a
    match to me &#40;for the grey font&#41;.

  body: Here is a image of the font you suggested. It is quite similar, but if you
    look at for instance the 3 in this image compared to the 3 in the screenshot,
    you see they are different. The 3 in my first image has straight endings while
    the 3 in this image has... things on the ends. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> I guess I&#39;m wrong in comparing the things on the end
    of the 3 with the things in times new roman though, as spaceageheavy doesn&#39;t
    have any serifs now that I really compared it to times new roman &#40;wow, now
    I know what serifs are <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: MJD the question is what are you going to use the font for? If its a logo
    or one or two words, modify &#34;close&#34;. You can always eliminate the things
    one the ends. Did you ever think you might be spending more time finding a solution
    than creating one.

  body: I&#39;m going to use it for my own video, so it will be time consuming to
    change the font in every frame. Maybe I could modify the font itself in a program?
    That might work as that space age font is not too different. Anyone know about
    a good program for doing that? Is it simple?

  body: If you modify the font you are violating the licencing agreement. If its video
    I don&#39;t see how someone could be so focused on whether a font has serifs or
    not. How many seconds will it be up?

    to do with reselling the customized font. <BR> <BR> <BR>What if I don&#39;t like

    <BR>Please understand that we have nothing against experimentation and the customizing
