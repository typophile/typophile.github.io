  monoline script. But, I'll be honest, it's driving me nuts. I am an amateur typographer,
  so I'm guessing it's either just inability or maybe it was just naive of me to think
  that building an upright script face wouldn't be that dissimilar from designing
  some kind of \"fancy monospace\", but (as you can see) I am failing.\r\n\r\nI'm
  almost there with my letterforms, but what I'm struggling with is the rhythm and
  logistics of actually building a seamless connecting script. I've dismantled other
  similar scripts to see if I can ascertain how they work, but it's not helped.\r\n\r\nRight
  now all \"connecting strokes\" along the baseline are exactly the same. I had them
  of varying widths previously, but it definitely screwed up the kind of rhythm of
  the baseline. The face just didn't flow. But as you can see now, building of a sort
  of \"monospaced\" connector between letters is making for uneven and tight spacing
  between letterforms. The \"r-g\" relationship is confounding, and the \"e\" is just
  weird.\r\n\r\nAny basic script face design advice?\r\nHELP! \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Monoline_5899.jpg]"

  body: "Try to write with some monoline instrument (felt-tip pen, for example) to
    understand the logic better. And i think you could make ligatures for the most
    difficult pair connections. Also you could have 2 or 3 forms of some letters to
    receive more accurate connections depending on what kind of letter in next (like
    in handwritten scripts). \r\nFor example your can use your present form of \xABe\xBB
    as a beginning form and also make \r\na middle form with more elongated eye for
    a better connection with previous letter. \r\nGood luck!"

  body: "I second the recommendation to try writing the letters first. I also suggest
    writing an non-connecting version of the basic letter structures and experiment
    with spacing these before introducing the joins. One of the most obvious problems
    with your design is the tight spacing and the imbalance of internal white spaces.\r\n\r\nI
    suggest you look at the French upright script style that was developed in the
    18th Century. This style was cut in type by Nicholas Gando, and <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/person/Nicholas_Gando/\">revived</a>
    in modern times by Matthew Carter. It is the best realisation of an upright joining
    script."
