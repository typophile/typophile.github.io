  Design student producing a publication about The Shining, in relation to Sigmund
  Freud's seminal paper The Uncanny, as my end of degree project. I've thought long
  and hard about what typefaces are most appropriate to produce the book and concluded
  that Futura [Kubrick's favourite font] and Perpetua [designed the year he was born]
  would work really well for this project. Obviously I want to utilise Perpetua's
  wonderful open type features, discretionary ligatures, small caps etc but I'm finding
  the family package price range a little out of my budget. Can anybody here please
  tell me if Linotype offers a student licensing discount?\r\nThanks in advance, all
  the best\r\nMatt"

    institution student store, then a student licensing discount probably is not available.

    a good choice. The director's favorite font isn't necessarily a good choice (like
    to me Futura isn't) and certainly the coincidence of a birth year seems like a
    total gimmick. Note that Perpetua was very aptly used for the most recent royal
    British wedding...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "In the case of Perpetua, I\u2019d ask Monotype\u2019s British office because
    that\u2019s the foundry where Perpetua actually comes from. I\u2019ve had several
    students who wanted to have certain typeface families for their student projects.
    In most (if not all) cases they got a kind of student license from the foundry.
    Some of the foundries wanted to see something of the project in advance. Others
    came up with a licence agreement which allowed the student to use the typeface
    for the time they were a student only."

  body: "Futura is definitely the typeface most associated with Kubrick; he used it
    in several movies. \r\n\r\nI read once that he started using it with 2001: A Space
    Odyssey because it resembled fonts often used by NASA, and liked it so well that
    he stuck with it."

  body: "I guess one needs to figure out whether the typography is supposed to evoke
    the topic, or the movie director. Futura is about control. Does it fit the former?
    Kubrick seems to have made sense with 2001, but maybe he gave that initial success
    too much credit. Above all else, let's not be a Vignelli.  :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    partner, and I] have sifted through everything to select what we thought best.
    We sifted through materials to find those for which we have the closest affinity.
    We sifted through colors, textures, typefaces, images, and gradually we built
    a vocabulary of materials and experiences that enable us to express our solutions
    to given problems\u2014our interpretations of reality.\r\n\r\nIt is imperative
    to develop your own vocabulary of your own language\u2014a language that attempts
    to be as objective as possible, knowing very well that even objectivity is subjective.\r\n\r\nI

    ambiguity means plurality of meanings. I love contradiction because it keeps things
    moving, preventing them from assuming a frozen meaning, or becoming a monument
    to immobility.\r\n\r\nAs much as I love things in flux, I love them within a frame

    The theme of Freud's 'The Uncanny' places a lot of emphasis on mirror images,
    symmetry and body doubles, as far as my limited knowledge goes I had a good think
    about how I could make fonts relate to both the subject matter of Stanley Kubrick
    and his films and also Freud's essay. I chose Futura because not only is it Kubrick's
    favourite font but it also has a lot of symmetry in the letterforms. I was reluctant
    to say because I'm sure someone's going to tear me a new one for stating that
    my tutors have encouraged me to pick recognisable 'common' fonts and distort them
    slightly in fontographer to create and Uncanny effect (ie recognisable but something
    is not quite right). As far as Perpetua goes, (I've always been slightly entertained
    by the story of Eric Gill's debauchery) but the addition that the typeface was
    designed in the year of Stanley Kubrick's birth was a coincidence I was rather
    proud of stumbling across. I must say part of what influenced my decision also
    was meeting the RCA grads Murray & Sorrell of Fuel design and seeing how they
    had put Purpetua to use for their work on the Chapman Bros publication Bedtime
    Tales for Sleepless Nights. In my own opinion theres a sorted of a twisted logic
    to the use there and it always stuck in my mind as looking fantastic in that book:
    http://fuel-design.com/media/uploads/thumbs/uploads/homepage/10-11_jpg_460x306_q95.jpg\r\n\r\nHaving
    said all this, I do of course value the opinions of everybody here so if you have
    any other suggestions I am very open to hearing them at this stage!\r\n\r\nAlso
    I agree with this \"I love systems and despise happenstance.\" Hence my choices,
    I always make an effort to make as many connections as I can when choosing typefaces
    :)\r\n"

    meanings as The Shining did. \r\n\r\nMost of them, in my opinion, are rather wacky,
    and in some cases try to draw meaning from continuity bloopers and other normal
    oddities of filmmaking (like interiors not matching exteriors), but they are interesting
    none the less. \r\n\r\nMatt, you've probably seen this already, but there's an
    interesting video shot by Kubrick's daughter about the making of the movie. I
    think it's also available on YouTube.\r\nhttp://www.slashfilm.com/votd-the-making-of-the-shining/\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/shining_6149.png]"

  body: '@JamesM yes I imported a US version of the film and ripped it from the disc
    (in the process I had to change the region of my mac optical drive, which you
    can only do 5 times) because little did I know that the version of the film shown
    here in the UK is actually 22 minutes shorter than the full American cut. In fact
    until Halloween last year the US version had only been shown in the UK once, inadvertantly
    by ITV. The documentary came as an extra on the  disc but thanks for the heads
    up :)'

    up the film after its initial release in the U.S. and considered the shorter version
    to be better.\r\n\r\nHe did something similar with 2001, making it shorter after
    seeing audience reaction to the first few showings, but I don't think the original,
    longer version of 2001 is available anywhere. "
