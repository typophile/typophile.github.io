body: 'Would anyone know of a serif font &#40;a classic as much as possible&#41; that
  contains roman numerals? &#40;I think roman numerals is the right name, by this
  I mean: I, II, III, IV, etc.&#41;. I&#39;ve checked experts sets and couldn&#39;t
  find anything. Any input? <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Em'

  body: Why not use a classic font like Bembo or Dante with an expert collection and
    just use the small cap i, v, x, etc.?

  body: You can always extend the serifs between those characters  <BR>and make them
    connect in order to emphasize the feel. <BR>I really don&#39;t see your problem.
