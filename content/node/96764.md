  body: "That's the only critic I'd give to mostly all distributors. Sometimes it
    really knows to take too long to be published. But I believe that's too complex
    thing to be discussed about, especially when you must pay attention that somebody
    might upload something else (like spams). But on the other hand, I don't think
    there's any designer who would like to wait until all distributors publish font
    first (cause it is unspecific time period) and then go with announcement. So,
    we just wait for few of them do that and go in public. \r\n\r\nBTW, so far it
    is available on FontSpring and MyFonts."
