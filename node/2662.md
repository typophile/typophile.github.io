  body: Looks like Arrow, available from <a href="http://www.treacyfaces.com/sample.html">Treacyfaces</a>.
    It also looks like it&#39;s been stretched a bit horizontally.

  body: I thought it was Arrow, but the R is wrong. Maybe they just straightened the
    leg. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"

  body: I did a test setting on the Treacyfaces site before I posted and it matched
    what&#39;s on the BR site as near as I can tell. I don&#39;t have any of their
    catalogs around to check it more closely. They may very well have modified it
    a bit here and there &#40;the crossbar on the E seems to be slightly lower, or
    it could just be the low resolution&#41;, but looks like a match to me.

  body: Well I&#39;ll be a monkey&#39;s uncle. I just pulled my BR card out of my
    wallet and you are right. Although I never doubted you Mark, I just always saw
    that R as straight. Hmm. :^\

  body: Someone joked recently that they don&#39;t expect it will be long before Banana
    Republic starts instituting a cover charge for a customer just to get into the
    store. I thought it was funny, anyway.
