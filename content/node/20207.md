  if anyone could identify this font for my girlfriend. She's in the process of doing
  a publication for a photographic journal. Are there any fonts worth recommending
  her? Serif ones. \r\n\r\nMany regards to everyone."

  body: "She needs something contemporary. She likes Fedra Serif. But cheaper. And
    plans to pair it up with DIN. \r\n\r\nIt's actually for an artsy exhibition publication
    instead of a photographic journal."
