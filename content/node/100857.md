  body: 'Another pretender is [[http://myfonts.us/td-XQZYFa|Titling Gothic]] (Normal
    Bold precisely). Needs a lot of work tweaking but really believe it could be the
    one, /15 looks pretty darn closed, too close to be a coincidence, only needs to
    make bottom line of its top horizontal. Rest of the letters could have been modified
    to work like a "Mono" font: reworking /M centre vertex to match /D width, adding
    horizontal bars to /I (same goal as previous), removed /G spur/tail and recreating
    top-rounded /A (starting from a upside-down /U?)'
