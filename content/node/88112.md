body: "Hi, all\r\n\r\nI'm trying to replicate the logos for two '80s TV series, but
  I'm having trouble identifying the font used.\r\n\r\nThe first is the font used
  for the VHS release of \"The Flight of the Condor\". It's quite a distinctive serif,
  with odd finials etc. but I just can't place it. The series aired in 1982 on the
  BBC, and the VHS release this cover is from was - I think - released in the mid-to-late
  1980s.\r\n\r\nThe second is the font used in the title card for \"Reaching for the
  Skies\". At first I thought this was Futura, but the \"S\" is wrong, and a few other
  details don't match. The distortion of the text doesn't help of course! This was
  from the original airing of the program on the BBC in the late 1980s. \r\n\r\nAny
  help would be much appreciated!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "\"Flight of the Condor\" must be <strong>CK Flip Serif</strong>\r\n\r\nI
    tried to restore a little the perspective of \"Reaching for the Skies\" (see the
    image bellow).\r\nIf the original typeface looks like this, then <strong>[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/flyer/|Flyer]]</strong>
    is a close alternative.\r\n\r\nPS: I found the fonts using Find my Font - http://www.findmyfont.com\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/reaching_skies_01_4036.jpg]"

  body: "Fvilanakis - \r\n\r\nCK Flip Serif is spot on, thanks!\r\n\r\nFlyer is almost
    there, but there are still some noticeable differences - the characters in the
    logo are squatter and heavier, and the R and G don't look quite right. It's close,
    but not quite it. "
