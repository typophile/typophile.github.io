  TCVW. \r\nDo you think it can be improved? and how? I'm not sure if the serifs are
  right, but I've been looking at it too long\u2026!\r\n\r\nAny advice is much appreciated"

    I think |C|\u2019s and |T|\u2019s serif should either be aligned or moved further
    away from each other."

  body: "Thanks Riccardo,\r\n\r\nI tried extending the 'T' serifs, not sure if i liked
    that. I can see what you mean with the 'C' and 'T', i'll bring the 'C' serif in
    a bit further towards the 'W' and away from the 'T' \r\n\r\nCheers"
