  you might want to check it out.  I used to do a lot of \"bad\" stencil type in Junior
  high so this cover just grabbed my attention.  Here is a link to the story:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/30/magazine/30brand.html?pagewanted=1&8dpc&_r=1\r\n\r\nER"

  body: "The NYTimes, like most traditional media news outlets is usually at least
    a month behind on these younger trends. I remember when they had a big article
    on the 'Snakes on a Plane' buzz from the web about 2 months after it started.\r\n\r\nI
    like the type on the shirt and the reference to Urban Outfitters. The Times Magazine
    is very comfortable with type-centric covers, which I've always enjoyed."

  body: "Ah, the hipster and the poser indies.\r\n\r\nThe 70's reference (Lubalin-style
    type, etc.) is what puzzled me, though. The hipster market is not that early in
    the era, are they?"

  body: 'The type, I find, reflects what Urban Outfitters have been doing with their
    type over the past couple of years. Not that I''ve ever been in their stores or
    purchased from them but their head designer was featured in a design magazine
    a year or so ago but can not for the life of me remember which one it was. '
