  \r\n\r\n<cite>(Blah Blah) Printing Inc. is seeking a Graphic Designer to design
  and build ads for newspapers. Must be proficient in EnDesign, Quark, PhotoShop,
  and Illustrator. Medical and Dental + 401K ...</cite>\r\n\r\nIt brought to mind
  this funny mistake I saw a few weeks ago:\r\n\r\n<cite>(Blah Blah) Grill is now
  hiring for summer/fall season 2008. Bintliff\u2019s is a fast paste restaurant supported
  by our resort ...</cite>\r\n\r\nAnyone ever eaten fast paste? I suspect it may be
  brutal on the digestive system. \r\n\r\nJust for laughs,\r\nEileen"

    lines of:\r\n\r\n<em>Hiring junior designer with 3-5 year experience. Must know
    print publication and be capable interface designer. Know Adobe CS3, Dreamweaver,
    Flash, Cold Fusion, Java, Javascript, XHTML, CSS. Be willing to work nights and
    weekends and kiss no-name art director\u2019s ass because he paid a $500 entry
    fee for an award from a free monthly design publication. Your one interesting
    client will be a local Shakespeare company that can only afford two-color printing.\r\n\r\nPays
    $35,000</em>"

    job descriptions that seem to encompass several full-time positions, then finish
    with something like \"This position is part time. Limited benefits include employee
    id and discounted parking.\"\r\n\r\nIt's the economy, right? Why else would a
    company want their graphic designer to do their accounting?"

    more than any of the other typos.\r\n\r\nJames...went to a web conference this
    weekend where I was on a panel discussion where that very topic came up. It's
    a VERY strange trend in the web world. We concluded that there's just one stock
    job description for every web related gig so that you should just ignore it and
    apply for the job anyways."

    find that they usually say Acrobat instead of pdf. I got into an argument with
    an author who kept asking me for acrobat files. I sent her pdfs, for some reason
    she couldn't open them (I downsaved them to like v4) and she'd email me again
    asking for the acrobat file.\r\n\r\nThat said, Quark has entered the vernacular
    as the name for that application. If you tell someone you work in XPress you will
    get a blank stare. Deal with it!\r\n\r\nAnd now I need to stop playing around
    on the interwebs and get to work. It's a series of tubes!"

    a Macintosh computer. At that time only the original seven (I think) guys who
    invented the Mac would have qualified. \r\n\r\nWhat they really wanted was more
    than 5 years experience on a computer, with some Mac experience. I qualified.\r\n\r\nAs
    for the first posting, don't blame the advertisers. Newspapers paying $6 an hour
    for classified ad takers (no spelling skills required if you work for cheap) and
    no more proofreaders mean that errors like this are common."

  body: "Point taken, Don, but these ads weren't in a newspaper. They were online,
    on websites with no \"classified ad taker\" to be a creative speller. Sadly, it's
    ignorant (or illiterate) employers.\r\n\r\nMacintosh wasn't released by Apple
    until 1984, so technically that requirement was impossible. But, had I not been
    17 years old, I may have qualified for that job! My dad was a salesman and worked
    for Apple when I was a kid - in 1980, dad brought home an Apple II Plus for his
    study. I learned to write a little program that drew a happy face on the monitor.
    When I was 13, Dad got an Apple IIe, but I think I fell in love with Rick Springfield
    that year and the computer lost it's appeal. "

  body: I can't tell you how many times I've seen XPress spelled "Express" or "Xpress"
    in ads. My guess is that these ads are dictated to someone who doesn't use the
    applications and hence does not know the proper spelling or capitalization...
    But even then, I would expect the ads to be proofread before being posted!
