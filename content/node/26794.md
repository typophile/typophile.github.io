  body: 'Like I said: if you read the <i>&#39;info &amp; samples&#39;</i> bit, you&#39;ll
    understand  <BR>why it is not a &#39;cheap&#39; family. We purchased licenses
    to the complete  <BR>Thesis-families &#40;144 fonts in total&#41; back when it
    was still FF Thesis,  <BR>and we haven&#39;t ever regretted cashing out the dole.
    <BR> <BR>PS: YRWLCM, though I&#39;d prefer to know who I&#39;m talking to. ;&#41;'
