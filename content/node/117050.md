  body: "This resembles Sudtipos [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/buffet-script/?refby=bowfin|Buffet]],
    which is based on the work of Alf Becker. I could not find another similar Becker
    interpretation, but this font has many alternates and might be similar enough
    if the matching font does not turn up.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Yes Mercury Script is close. \r\nThe same designer Emil Karl Bertell recently
    released a similar font, _Carpenter Script_ http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fenotype/the-carpenter/
    that could be used to duplicate the letters. Note that _Carpenter Script_ has:
    1.  An alternate _I_ that is almost identical to the sample. 2. An alternate _k_
    with an upper loop similar to the sample. 3. An alternate _f_ that is almost identical
    to the sample. 4. An alternate _a_ that is is almost identical to the sample.
    5. An alternate _t_ with the cross stroke extended backwards. Slope the phrase
    less than 5 degrees right and _Carpenter Script_ looks like a match, with almost
    no editing required.\r\nDon"
