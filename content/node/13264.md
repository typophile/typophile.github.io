  body: It seems to be a variation of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/gill-sans/condensed/testdrive.html?s=GEROLSTEINER&p=48">Gill
    Sans Condensed</a>. I think maybe they added a stroke or something.

  body: I think Mark's right. There is also a <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=M.7002.0.1&attributes.sampleSize=74&sampleText=GEROLSTEINER&sampleSize=96">Gill
    Sans Extra Condensed Bold</a> that is only slightly different.
