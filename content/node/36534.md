body: "Please excuse any ignorance on my part, cause I'm fairly new to the study of
  typography and new to Typophile. \r\n\r\nOnly a year ago I started purchasing commercial
  fonts - to augment the usual collection available bundled with programs or shareware/freeware.
  Now I'm hooked...but I don't have much $$ to invest in fonts and don't have many
  clients yet, so I have to restrain myself!\r\n\r\nI was recently seeking a heavy,
  clean-looking, modern italic sans, and found Leitura Sans [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dstype/leitura-sans/italic-4/]]
  on MyFonts - that worked well for my purpose. All the DS fonts were half-price that
  month, so I helped myself to some of the Leitura Roman text fonts too. \r\n\r\nNow
  I don't like Leitura Roman text font at all, and asked myself why I bought it![[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dstype/leitura/]]
  The PDF advert was so beautifully designed it deceived me... \r\n\r\nMostly, I detest
  the lower case \"g\" - it has little flag sticking up on the upper right like a
  cowlick. Rather than gracefully leading the eye to the next letter, it sticks out
  most unpleasantly. I can't seem to get past that. Did you ever decide not to use
  a font because of a single letter? \r\n\r\nLast week a page on this site pointed
  me to a modern text font bundled with Powerpoint that I like better - Cambria.\r\n\r\nI
  know that someone is likely to tell me that Cambria sucks or is already becoming
  overused, but my question is this:\r\nHave you ever made a misjudgement choosing
  type? and why?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    because you don't like the drawer pulls. ;o)\r\n\r\nI will say DSType definitely
    has strong personalities, so you either get along with them or you don't. That
    said, if it's just the g that's not doing it for you, modify it (provided the
    EULA allows it, of course)."

    I can do is outline in Illustrator. Not too practical for that purpose.\r\n\r\nBut
    you didn't answer my question! "

    everyone to some extent or another might have had a similar experience. \r\n\r\nThe
    strongest tools foundries have to sell their typefaces are the specimens. If they
    are well designed I will raise my hand with guilt that I find myself wanting to
    license the fonts. \r\n\r\nDino's specimen demonstrates clearly how the g from
    the Leitura News was changed or designed to contrast with Leitura. Did you like
    you not notice it in the specimen? (Maybe I'm looking at a different specimen.)
    I actually think it is quite cute, but can imagine that once you've locked onto
    something you don't like it won't disappear. I have a few typefaces that I won't
    license because of quirks I've noticed. \r\n"

  body: "You're right, the weird \"g\" clearly shows in the diagram.\r\n\r\nAt the
    time, I admired the chiseled, angular outline of the Leitura letterforms and preferred
    them over the rounded edges and curved brackets of the Leitura News. \r\n\r\nThe
    \"g\" flag bothered me only when I saw how it annoying looked with the other letters
    in a line of text...after I had bought it and started experimenting with it, of
    course.\r\n\r\nI've bought a number of fonts on impulse, but believed I had made
    a studied decision with Leitura, damn it. \r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nSpeaking
    of impulse, I have a weakness for juicy, beautiful retro designs like Nick's Fonts.
    I have all of his older free ones and bought 5 or 6 of his commercial fonts. Not
    once have I used one for a job - it just gives me pleasure to play with them like
    a pair of frivolous shoes. Every time I tell myself: Okay, no more Nick's Fonts,
    Dina, until you get a paying job using one of these...\r\n\r\nAt least with Nick's
    I've never stop liking any, though I knew each was an unecessary purchase. "

    italic in a poster headline. I've got loads of other fonts which I've yet to use,
    just waiting for the right project. Priori Sans is a good example, I almost used
    that recently but changed my mind at the last minute. And I bought Amplitude three
    and a half years ago, when it was really fashionable, and couldn't find the right
    project for it! I've used it a couple of times, but not enough to do it justice.
    And now it isn't so trendy anymore so I've effectively shelved it.\r\n\r\nOne
    of the funny things about big font collections, like the Bitstream Type Odyssey,
    is that you don't really know what you've got for the first few years. Even now,
    I'm still feeling my way around. But I still want to buy more type!"

  body: "Thanks for the feedback, everyone; it's very helpful.\r\n\r\nI would never
    have guessed that Amplitude is no longer trendy. It looks trendy to me, but of
    course a working design professional in the industry is much more conscious of
    trends. My customers would never know the difference. Frutinger and Amplitude
    would look the same to them. They would even be surprised that \"trends\" aand
    \"fashions\" in type exist. \r\n\r\nYou might guess they are not magazine publishers
    and high-end boutiques."
