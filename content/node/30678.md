  Typography gurus.\r\n\r\nI need an elegant, cursive and organic font for a Floral
  Designer.  He's looking for a free-flowing, modern font that would have some kind
  of  floral feel to it.  \r\n\r\nHis target clients (Donna Karan, Dior, Giorgio Armani,
  Barney's NY, etc) would be found in magazines such Martha Stewart Weddings and W
  Magazine.\r\n\r\nHe creates the Floral Arrangements for high-profile clients events
  such as weddings and events.\r\n\r\nThanks a million... "
