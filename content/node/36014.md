body: This is a quicky prototype logo or a friend who's starting a web design company.
  The idea is the company will be like blogger where you upload your files and use
  templates to create your own website. The idea behind the logo is it's supposed
  to be a somewhat famous landmark in the Southern San Francisco Bay Area. Any critique
  would be appreciated.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/towerhillproto1_5217.jpg]

    perhaps the mark could be a bit more friendly and accessible.

  body: here's another go at it. I ditched the rays emanating from the background
    as i think that still adds too much to the "book publisher" feel. The three stars
    added represent the three founders of the company. Any suggestions for different
    fonts to use are welcome.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/towerhill2_3941.jpg]

    a problem, though: since you''re working black figure/white ground, the stars
    -- represented here in black -- take on the "bullet holes in a road sign" look.
    perhaps if they had fewer arms? i don''t know.'

    in a few.

  body: "I liked the revision before the gray. Using gray cheapens the mark, as it
    does just about any mark.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the stars were reading as bullet
    holes had less to do with the foreground/background color and more to do with
    the shape of the stars. Personally, I would try just using three different size
    dots, which I think would bring some roundness back into the mark.\r\n\r\nOne
    other thing, why are they calling this \"The Tower Hill?\" Using \"the\" in the
    name is so dated, it hardly seeems appropriate for a web publshing outfit. \"Tower
    Hill\" not only sounds better, but it would look better, too. Why put a word into
    your name that does nothing to differentiate yourself whatsoever. The only time
    \"the\" makes sense in a business name is when you want your business to sound
    old-world.\r\n\r\nAs it is now, the type seems to small relative to the mark.
    Removing \"the\" would also allow you to make the type that much larger."

    to be more of an umbrella business whereas the web publishing site will be a different

    your frame. I don't think it's doing anything for you except perhaps giving you
    false comfort. A tower on top of a hill on the other hand might work quite nicely.
    I would make the windows either smaller or bigger. Right now they fight with the
    tower for primacy. \r\n\r\nWhy this type choice?\r\n\r\nAlso, I disagree with
    darrel (Aluminum). I suggest you fully work it out in black & white & then thing
    color afterwards. Unless your logo will never receive any significant black &
    white only use."

  body: "<cite>I\u2019m leaning away from that school of thought.</cite>\r\n\r\nYou
    have a heck of a good point. But I still think that logos that rely on color too
    much in order to work are usually not as strong. I can't back that up with examples
    just now - I would be interested to see counter argument especially with examples.
    And it's not just faxes. Faxes are in fact almost a non-issue I think. The real
    issues are \r\n\r\n- sometimes a logo needs to be in a newspaper.\r\n- it could
    also be cut into stone or steel. \r\n- or it might be used in a two color only
    situation like the typecon corporate sponsor web page. \r\n- or the typecon program
    guide - one color. \r\n\r\nI agree the momentum is shifting but as a logo is a
    serious business decision, and an investment, I would still not advise a client
    to make black and white an afterthought - yet. \r\n\r\nIt's true that not all
    companies have these venues as serious options. And so contraint in these cases
    might be besides the point. But on the other hand, you never know what situation
    a business will be in for sure. So over all I still say - why risk it?"

    when the logo is scaled down.\r\n\r\nI like the original version of the building
    -- it's distinguished. The new version looks too common and dull -- the windows
    make it better, but not really good.\r\n\r\nSame goes for the landscape -- the
    original one has style, the new ones are too symmetric.\r\n\r\nThe box corners
    can be both rounded or not -- I prefer square, because it's a nice contrast to
    the rounded corner of the building (the original version). Either way, inner corner
    and outer corner should be consistent.\r\n\r\nThe text looks better to me in uppercase
    -- don't know why, as I'm usually a strong opponent of all-caps. I like the \"the\",
    but I don't like any version you've presented for it. Maybe try lowercase \"the\"
    with uppercase \"TOWER HILL\"?"

  body: "Love the simplicity of the mark. You instantly draw a correlation between
    the name and the mark. Also many thanks to Eben Sorkin for his remarks on finalizing
    in B&W before you move to color. I work in a corporate environment where a majority
    people don't go through this process and raise an eye brow when you put pencil
    to paper before grabbing the mouse. I have began to fell that I'm a bit crazy
    for this belief. If you need examples of bad full color logo design just look
    at Command and Scotch-brite, both owned by 3M (who ironically has a very strong
    corporate logo). Neither of these logos can work in B&W and more alarmingly the
    Scotch-brite only exists in color and has to sit in the upper left hand corner
    of something because of the triangle shape. But enough venting.\r\n\r\nIf the
    point of the logo was the tower, or the hill than I'd agree that they need to
    be more memorable. But the point is to identify with people familiar with the
    landmark and it's vicinity, but not give the impression that the company is in
    some way related to the tower. Your evoking the area that the tower is contained
    in in essence and the culture identified in and with the area (at least I hope
    this was considered).\r\n\r\nAnother consideration is this is for the web. That
    means that the mark also has to be understood at some level by people unfamiliar
    with Tower Hill. In this instance recognition with the concept is far more important
    than the landmark. Making this an effective solution \"tower on a hill\" easily
    equals Towerhill to viewers unfamiliar with the landmark.\r\n\r\nAll in all I
    like the progress so far I agree with the corners needing help. I'd go square
    if only to avoid the \"rounded corners web look\". Also look at the roof line
    on the \"white side\" of the building the line appears to have a slight taper
    that either needs to be greater or not there. \r\n\r\nMy only main concern with
    the lack of association between the companies name and what they do, but I am
    well aware the this is probably outside of your control and trying to force the
    association through the logo would be a mistake. \r\n\r\nSorry to be log winded.
    You are approaching a memorable and effective solution. \r\nGood work."

    you look at colour - you've got to design for the worst-case scenario. Like your
    logo used small, single-colour  by a screenprinter, for example.\r\n\r\nI hope
    I'm not stating the obvious, but if the word 'the' (as you had it orignally) referred
    to the URL of the company, maybe try a version of the logo with the URL as the
    name (you don't have to have the leading 'www.'). I've always thought this was
    a shrewd move because you're communicating more than just the company name with
    the logo - you're making them aware of the web address (and therefore much more).
    Especially as it's a web design company."
