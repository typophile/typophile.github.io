  file "for real" I need to obtain  files from Certification Authority such as Verisign.
  Then what kind of certificate should I buy? Would you tell me how to sign my font
  successfully without the Warning: This file is signed, but not timestamped.Thank
  you very much.'

  body: Thank you! I am waiting for your news.By the way, I learned that Verisign
    is currently the only vendor selling digital certificates and time-stamping services
    that can be used with the MS signing tools.As you said that's not true, isn't
    it?
