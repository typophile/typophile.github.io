body: "Hi typophile mates!\r\n\r\nI'm trying to improve this first version of this
  typeface, called \"Limonada\" its meaning is litteraly \"Lemonade\" and was sinesthetically
  referred as a formal abstraction to lemon shapes (i.e. lemon seed, lemon leaves,
  and lemon juice drop, etc.)\r\nThis weekend I'm very interested in make some correction
  on this one, so hope somebody can see it with another eye further than just mine
  ones and give me an opinion.\r\n\r\nI'll very thankful in advance.\r\n\r\nKind regards\r\nPedro\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Limonada_WIP-IX_4416.gif]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Limonada_WIP-III_bn_5488.gif]\r\n\r\nP.S.:
  PDF Attached to check it out  in a better way."

    baseline serif of /f/ (and ligatures) go right instead? Should serif directions
    of /V/W/Y/ follow the lowercase model?\r\nBowl of /a/ feels a little out of character
    to me.\r\nDescenders could use a little more space."

      news about 2nd version of this soon, so there I'll seize all this new appointments,
      specially try another option to bowl of /a/ but it's hard to find another shape
      to fit on (I really like this version /a/ because fit at least to the concept
      inspired, but anyway I'm also open to experiment and discover new design possibilities,
      so I'll try my best for).\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/a_limonada_09-10-2012_4039.png]\r\n\r\n/fi/

  body: This is pretty cool. I'd try a double story g and v-shaped y, and try to get
    more of the AE style A into the A, if you know what I mean. I like your sterling.
    Why is the zero floating?

    body: "Thank you Dave.\r\n\r\nI'm working now in the another /g/ and also I'll
      try to make a more conservative version of /y/ yes.. but I think leave this
      kind as alternatative design.. thanks to mention it.. so I really like even
      more... because this become a very attractive OTF idea. I'll try to do a version
      close to AE.. if looks well sure I replace the new version.\r\n\r\nAnd about
      floating zero version is a kind of solution to avoid confusions between the
      letter /O/o/0 (zero without slash or center pointed version)/. I know this look
      a little disturbing but wen you running alphanumeric combination this works
      a little eficiently.. even more than inverted contrast, but I need mor opinions
      about it.. in fact it's an alternative of zero slash.. and looks aesthetically
      close to oldstyle so my collegues that yet use this zero version mention no
      one negative comments or any, because I always finding ways to make more legible
      and clean versions of each letter and avoid ambiguity meanings.. I know this
      is not so easy, I appreciate a rational coments about.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/floating-zero_6034.png]"

  body: "Terminal of /e/ should be more pointy IMO.\r\nI actually liked the informal
    character of /@/ before the revision (except again the terminal and the shape
    of the left arc).\r\n/s/ is too wide.\r\n\r\nI like that you're being organized
    in your design. It shows off your dedication. Those corrections all go in the
    right direction, specially that of raising the tittles.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Para
    mejorar la legibilidad de una forma es m\xE1s relevante prestarle atenci\xF3n
    a la contraforma que concentrarse en la forma misma.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nBeing
    conscious of and \u2018tweaking\u2019 the inner space of a shape <em>is</em> concentrating
    on the shape itself, isn't it?\r\n\r\nIs \"contraforma\" a usual term in spanish,
    or is it a neologism? :-)\r\n\r\nMe est\xE1 gustando bastante, sigue as\xED!"

    body: "Absolutely agrre with you about pointy version of /e/ and if I do this
      I must to do on several terminals too in order to keep a formal concordance
      until most possible be.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/e_limonada_09-10-2012_6706.png]
      \r\n\r\nAbout /@/ I'll try how this looks like this version you mention here
      and after have a good comparision decide wich one works better in small sizes
      or digital environments, that's the reason of that kind of serif function, but
      if still workind could be no necesary, but I need test it, thanks to mention,
      I like the idea of a cleanest version one. Now I notive about width of /s/ really
      need fix it.\r\n\r\n\"contraforma\" is a term used to be very often on latin
      grafic desing to refer the opposite to \"forma\" (closer meaning could be \"shape
      outer space\")\r\n\r\nSo it is, yes, and to be even more specific according
      previous idea it is not only inner space but also outer space, because a simple
      stroke involve both out sides, even a close shape like a circle, so is everything
      out of the shape it self.\r\n\r\nCon certeza seguir\xE9, muchas gracias por
      vuestras valiosas opiniones :)\r\n\r\nPedro."

  body: "I like the \"a\".\r\n\r\nI'm trying to decide whether this would look better
    \"fauve\" (as it does now) or \"polished\"... And now I realize this might be
    a good opportunity to have both versions - call them \"Country\" and \"City\".
    To make the latter I think the key would be modulating the joins (and thinning
    the serifs).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
