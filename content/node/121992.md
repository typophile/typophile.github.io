  body: I think that, as in lots of Japanese games, it's a <a href='http://fontworks.co.jp/'
    target='_blank'>Fontworks</a> font - probably Reggae, which was also used in Legend
    of Zelda/Wind Waker. Unfortunately, the only <a href='http://www.lunaconcepts.com/e/downloads/LunaFontSamples_FW_JPN.pdf'
    target='_blank'>image (# 32)</a> I can find of Reggae includes only a few letters.
    The Fontworks website seems to be totally Western-unfriendly.

  body: "To see the full alphabet & other characters follow Akira's link, find the
    tiny Adobe logo and download the pdf. It contains an embedded subset of Reggae
    which provides scalable images.\r\nI have not figured out how to purchase the
    font.\r\nDon"

    an annual license program. If you join the program, you can use all of their fonts
    for one year.\r\nhttps://www.lets-member.jp/"
