  \ Not enough active design forums out there.\r\n\r\nAnyways, I'd love everyone's
  feedback on the logo I created for my company, mid-brain design.  "

  body: "Here are a few things that I'd suggest looking at:\r\n\r\n1. Let's start
    off with the big one: do you really need a symbol for this?  A symbol is best
    used when augmenting a slightly abstract name or concept.  Here, you're just explaining
    the name, which is unnecessary.  Plus, I don't think it's really distinctive enough
    as a symbol.  I get it \u2013\_the mid-brain.  If there were something else hidden
    within, like a great monogram or something, that might help.  But still, I think
    it's superfluous.\r\n\r\n2. If you are going to use this symbol, then the typeface
    for \"mid-brain design\" is competing visually with it.  The serifs, the open
    'a' counter, and the ligatured \"gn\" are all distracting from the symbol.  I
    think the type should be simpler, with a little bit more modernity to meld better.\r\n\r\n3.
    I get web and print.  What is \"photo\" ?  Is that another service you offer?
    \ So you're a photographer too?  Great.  Should be a separate business, I think.\r\n\r\n4.
    The layout of the various type elements are all over the place, also contributing
    to a visual mess.  The symbol on the left, the \"web, print...\" modifier on the
    right, and the tagline too-tightly stuck underneath the name.  Kill the \"web,
    print, photo\" bit.  It's not necessary.  By saying you do web and print, that
    says you do pretty much anything, so it's not needed.  Find a better way to place
    the tagline that balances better with your main typeface.  Balancing form with
    function is a decent tag, but the type lockup is all unbalanced.  "

  body: "Good points.\r\n\r\nDo I need a symbol?  Hmm, perhaps not, but it does work
    well.  The logo as you see it is really the master logo.  Components can be removed
    (and often are).  \r\n\r\nI don't want the main type to be too simple (I want
    people to know that I'm not just selecting a typeface and running with it).  \r\n\r\nre:
    photo - yes I am a photographer as well, and yes its a bit muddled.  I don't lead
    with it, and its really just support for the other things I do.  Separate business
    idea is good, perhaps in the future.  I agree that the web, print, photo part
    isn't entirely necessary (think of it as a separate graphic element, not necessarily
    the logo proper)."

  body: "Agree with Jonsel : too complicated, too much things and symbols.\r\n\r\nA
    suggestion. I think you have a design opportunity with your Company name : the
    \"d\" and the \"b\" can represent the two parts of a brain.\r\nAs this, you put
    your symbol inside your name by a typographic way. It can work with a geometric
    font. Look at this quick draft for exemple with the font Neophyte.\r\nHope it
    could help you.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/midbrain_6173.jpg]"

  body: "Yeah, I considered using the db relation as a symbol...  Didn't work for
    me however, primarily because I need the dash in there (since the url is mid-brain.com).\r\n\r\nPeople
    do tend to see what they want in my symbol...  Fruit, walnut, womb etc.  Not sure
    if thats all part of the fun of it, or if thats distracting.  I think with the
    name next to it, it becomes self-explanatory."

    running with it</em>\r\n\r\nIsn't your logotype just a typeface, or did you draw
    it from scratch?  Nobody who sees that will think, \"Oh, he does type design particularly
    well.\"  I consider myself to be a type fanatic and love to modify type for my
    own needs, but I'm still quite happy to select a typeface and run with it when
    it works.  I think you're overanalyzing this.  But if you want to stick with type
    of a similar vein, kill the symbol.  Or, use the symbol as an extra graphic element
    on your stationery or website, but not locked up with the type."
