  body: "It is very close to House Industries [[http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=23|House
    Slant from their signpainter collection.]]with an added stroke. It doesn't match

    of H.\r\n\r\nThis is an image form their letter tester as the link I gave doesn't
    show samples of House Slant \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ls_5516.png]"
