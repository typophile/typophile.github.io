body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI'm creating an erotic magazine as a school assignment, and for
  the logo I'd like to use an extremely decorated font. I'd like it to be something
  like the following:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/22f0ded100261060ba8acbc3d148c0b7fc252905_m_2_5334.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/200px-Pulp-We_Love_Life_5974.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/porn-_4705.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  thing is, I can't find any digitized versions of the like. I found out the guy that
  did the cover typography on Pulp's \"We love life\" is called Louis John Pouch\xE9e,
  but it seems like these decorated typefaces only exist as metal. I've tried Identifont
  and all the others, and also tried searching the forums, but so far nothing showed
  up.\r\n\r\nAny help on digital versions in this style would be greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDaniel\r\n\r\n"

    a letterpressed \"gentleman's\" rag. Dig up some old woodcuts and engravings to
    go with it."

  body: "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nthanks a bunch for your help. I think the idea of going with
    old metal is wonderful, but excuse my ignorance when I ask, where do you find
    that sort of thing? Who could have something like that?\r\n\r\nLex, I think that's
    a strong possibility, f.ex I think the FUR logo (or what it is) probably has been
    done that way. \r\n\r\nHere's another beauty, from an old cover of Fanny Hill,
    an erotic novel. Also, a logo for a late 18. century condom manufacturer. The
    sign around it's neck says 'Force'. All found in the Danish erotic museum. Please
    blame Motorola for the extremely poor quality, I hope you can still get the idea.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/03-12-07_1711_4007.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/03-12-07_1734_6407.jpg]\r\n\r\nAgain,
    thanks alot!\r\n\r\nDaniel"
