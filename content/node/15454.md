  that the fonts are different members of one family).  Help!

  body: "Robin Kinross has compared Mrs Eaves to a loose bicycle. My own favorite
    comparison involves a beautiful woman with a serious speech impediment. One shameful
    thing is to have coupled such superb letterforms with such horrid spacing. Another
    shameful thing is that so few designers who use it are paying attention.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    . . All you have to do is make a photopolymer plate and try to print it letterpress.
    There is something quite wrong there. Emigre fonts are \"designed\" for graphic
    designers, other than that they technical disasters. There is something quite
    wrong with them that I suspect has to do with a failure to understand the relationships
    of letterforms one to another. The only thing I can compare it to are those depth
    perception tests you take during an eye examination. Is this letter closer to
    you than this letter? Well, imagine erratic accumulation of color on a letterform
    relative to another letterform, and that's what you get. Letters jumping out at
    you. Maybe letterpress functionality should be the litmus test of type design.\r\n\r\nGerald"
