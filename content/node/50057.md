  together for a college project, and was wondering what people would consider to
  be well executed, and/or well known logotypes. I was thinking along the lines of
  avant garde, coca-cola and fedex, can people think of anything else?\r\n\r\nYour
  help would be greatly appreciated!"

    As for really, really great identities you may have to step back in time, as the
    minimal, one-colour logotypes of the 80's and beginning 90's are way better than
    the shiny, glossy, bevely, 3dy stuff that's so hyped today.\r\n\r\nDav"

    T, V, and W with all the lower-case vowels were important. There were a lot of

    solely comprised of type, such as the examples I gave? Is what you're talking
    about not referred to as a glyph?"

  body: "The term \"glyph\" came about in the late 1990s I believe. It means something
    like \"sort,\" but does not have quite the same connotations. In modern (Unicode)
    usage, a Greek capital \"Alpha\" can be the same \"glyph\" as Latin capital \"A\",
    but they are different characters. It would be odd to use the term \"sort\" here;
    the notion of having both Greek and Latin in a single metal font would be unusual.
    Caslon Greek would be thought of as a different font in the old days (\"old\"
    meaning before the 1990s). In type cases, they would be thought of as different
    sorts only because they would be in different cases. But if you ran out of *A's*,
    you could use an *Alpha* & not loose meaning. \r\n\r\nAnd while all logotypes
    are sorts, not all sorts are logotypes. \"Sort\" doesn't specify what is unique
    about logotypes (two letters on one body). It would be the same as saying we don't
    need the term \"ligature\", because \"sort\" or \"glyph\" is sufficient. (see
    note)\r\n\r\nBy the way, there were logotypes in systems other than Linotype.
    With foundry type, a Q with a long tail required a \"Qu\" logotype.\r\n\r\nIt
    may be that in the past few years \"logotype\" has come to mean a logo consisting
    only of type, I don't know. While words can change meanings even in formal usage,
    that would seem to be a bit far. Sort of like expecting everybody to know what
    \"dudine\" means.\r\n\r\n(note): A \"ligature\" means tied letters; by extension,
    used where elements of the two letters touch, such as the glyphs *fb*, *fk*, etc.
    The individual characters in logotypes (old usage) were not tied; nothing touched,
    hence not \"ligatures.\""

  body: "In addition to the two-letter sorts that Charles has explained, I believe
    that \"logotype\" also referred to catchphrases and other complete words set as
    a single metal sort. (Hence the derivation of the term.) A printer's glossary
    I have from 1924 gives the definition: \"Logotype -- Two or more letters, or a
    whole word, cast on one body.\"\r\n\r\nIn some cases, a company would have had
    it's name specially cast up as a single sort, perhaps in a variety of sizes, to
    facilitate the setting of advertising material, especially once the practice of
    custom, identifying marks became a common part of business practice. This might
    have been more frequently a zinc etching rather than a proper type-metal sort,
    but I think the term was still applied. \r\n\r\nI believe that's how we've inherited
    the usage that is pretty common today, where a company's distinguishing wordmark
    is referred to as a logotype.\r\n\r\n-- Kent."
