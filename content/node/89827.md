  I just sorted glyphs and all alternate versions of numerals, small caps, etc are
  now all mixed up and difficult to work with:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mixed_3964.JPG]"

  body: "If you switch to Index mode, you can sort them manually via drag and drop.\r\n\r\nOr
    you can write a Python macro to build an Encoding file following your preferred
    sorting rules, and then use the menu command Glyph \u2192 Sort Glyphs \u2192 By
    Encoding."

  body: "You can also just write your own custom encodings (= sorting lists) in a
    text editor.\r\n\r\nGo to Library > Application Support > FontLab > Encoding >
    and then choose therein one of the existing .enc files to open.\r\nRewrite its
    content and edit the header; you must give a new number and name in the first
    row.\r\nThis is the beginning of such a file:\r\n________\r\n%%FONTLAB ENCODING:
    10029; <strong>MacOS Central Europe</strong>\r\n%%GROUP:Type 1 non-Western (Mac)\r\n%%Source:
    FontLab 2005-02-26 codepage release with AGLFN 1.3\r\n%%Release: 2005-02-26\r\n%%Changes:

    33\r\nquotedbl 34\r\nnumbersign 35\r\n...\r\n_  _  _  _\r\n\r\nNote that the part
    set in Bold here will be the identification line in the glyph sorting menu.\r\nYou
    can omitt all the %% lines except the first one. You can also omitt the numbers
    behind the glyph names. In the list, you can insert technical entities like \u2022\u2022\u2022
    or [\u2013] or whatsoever which you may wish to use as a kind of rubrication (they
    will show up as glyph cells but you don\u2019t need to furnish them).\r\n\r\nSave
    the new encoding file under a new name with the .enc suffix. The file must be
    stored in one of the > Library > Application Support > FontLab > Encoding places
    so that FL can draw on it.\r\n\r\nVery convenient way, i.m.o.\r\n"
