  kind of report</a> for typographi.ca. This year, I have no organised notes, but
  it was important to me to put down something, as a way of expressing gratitude to
  everyone involved, and also to begin a thread where other attending typophiles can
  add their own remarks.\r\n\r\nThe single most powerful impression that the conference
  made on me was how much the discipline of typography is a \"distributed\" project
  - a worldwide collaboration of diverse individuals. (To veterans of the world type
  community this idea may seem obvious and banal, but since I am just an unknown provincial
  and don't belong to academia, it strikes me afresh. I am not even a practicing typographer
  at the moment, having decided to take a break from the mad, mad world of small studio
  design and advertising.)\r\n\r\nThe Thessaloniki conference thus brings a remarkably
  diverse group of individuals and interests together. Dr Klimis Mastoridis' opening
  remarks emphasised this point, that the event is of value to all community members:
  those in related industries, the artists, makers and users; the engineers and tool
  makers; and researchers, writers and students. The underlying idea, which came through
  strongly to me, is that together as a wide community we are making a distributed
  \"attack\" on a field which itself seems infinitely large.\r\n\r\nWhere else could
  you meet a wood type historian with particular interest in Extreme Reverse Shadeds
  (David Shields), one of the very few working punchcutters (Dan Carr), Karel van
  der Waarde who warned us of the communication catastrophe that is pharmaceutical
  packaging inserts (can they be modelled on aircraft safety cards, I wonder?), an
  OpenType geek hacking on the outer limits (Richard Kegler), Arafat al-Naim - an
  expert in Arabic logotypes, and Dan Reynolds who we'll remember as \"the Bank Gothic
  guy\". Who knew that the two world authorities on the Spanish tilde - Andreu Balius
  and Jos\xE9 Scaglione - could make the topic so entertaining; as were Stiff's Notes
  on what people do when they need to hand-scrawl maps or directions; and dozens more
  lit up, one by one, small windows of a massive cathedral. The message is that everyone
  has something to contribute, somewhere.\r\n\r\nAn emphasis on history is hardly
  misplaced. David Shields mentioned, and I also feel, that young digital-era students
  and designers more than ever need access and encouragement to explore the history
  and traditions of the craft they employ every day. It may surprise some to learn
  that we are even now losing artefacts of <em>digital</em> typographic history -
  but I think those who are older than I am will quickly agree, on reflection. This
  is the result of generations of rapid technological change... so there is a great
  need for preservation and intelligent study. Of course we heard at the conference
  about one great exception, the Plantin-Moretus museum, but elsewhere in the world
  it is almost impossible to keep the past from slipping through our fingers (as I've
  personally seen with letterpress, hotmetal and digital era artefacts). So the conference
  reinforces a vital reverence for this history, and gives us some access to it.\r\n\r\nIt
  was therefore very timely that Dr Karow's keynote recapitulated the stages of digital
  typographic development and, like most of the speakers, pointed towards \"what still
  needs to be done\". It's a pity that he did not use the stage to plug his books
  on the subject, which IMHO should be among the required reading for typographic
  students. As software incorporates each new layer of sophistication, the machanisms
  become invisible. What was once done manually becomes automated. Perhaps 2007 is
  a good moment to take stock and refresh ideas of what might constitute a thorough
  typographic education.\r\n\r\nA thought that occurred to me more than once during
  the lectures was a permanent online home for the presentations and related material.\r\n\r\nThe
  conference also makes sure that we feel the inclusiveness and tolerance of the international
  typo-visual world, where dilettantes like me can rub shoulders with the real architects
  and authorities. In this sense it is more than just a metaphorical 'typographic
  heaven'.\r\n\r\nPS. Please note there is a <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/ictvc2007/\">Flickr
  group</a> devoted to the conference.\r\n"

    well. It is too bad that more Typophiles weren't able to make the trip\u2026 it
    would have been nice to see Hrant in person at a Mediterranean conference again.
    Maybe some more attendees will chime in here?"

    been a less kind summary so I will take that as a positive review. Meanwhile I

  body: Hi Richard, I actually tried several different wordings. "Pushing the envelope"
    was one that came to mind. "Making experiments on the fringe" was rejected. Outer
    Limits it is. ("We control the horizontal. We control the vertical...") But in
    any case, someone has to make the tech do things that were never thought of (a
    font that answers questions?! - I wonder what the metal type analogy is) which
    inevitably expands the space of things that can then be thought of.
