body: I bought one for school last year and have yet to use it &#40;asides from the
  pica ruler&#41; or receive adequate instruction on how to use it.  A few of my type
  teachers have mentioned how they are handy, and everyone should have one, but no
  one has shown why. <BR> <BR>I even went to the Library last week and was looking
  at Graphic Design studio technique books,  and while they mentioned more about it&#39;s
  uses, I think it was assumed that their pre-macintosh readers already knew how to
  use them. <BR>And now that I&#39;m taking an editorial class, I&#39;d like to actually
  use one with confidence. <BR> <BR>So I humbly ask two questions,  how exactly do
  you use a type gauge,  and as a professional do you still use one?  <BR> <BR>thanks
  one million <BR>Mike

  body: Thank you so much.  that&#39;s exactly what I needed to know.  and it&#39;s
    useful to know that it can be used in multiples as well.  Indeed this is faster
    then the alternative, but not as complicated as I imagined it to be.  &#40;I had
    the impression it was about as user-friendly as a slide rule&#41;
