    all of the diacritical marks, and then you can use Fontlab to generate all of
    the accented characters. Fontlab will mathematically center the marks by default,
    so you can either reposition them manually or prepare anchors to control placement
    in advance. Leslie Cabarga explains techniques his book <a href=\"http://www.logofontandlettering.com/bookorder.html\"><em>Learn
    Fontlab Fast</em></a>, and it\u2019s probably covered in the Fontlab manual.\r\n\r\n<cite>Does
    it software import or open illustrator files?</cite>\r\n\r\nThis is where you\u2019re
    going to run into trouble. You should have prepared your Illustrator to export
    to Fontlab before you started drawing. You\u2019ll have to make changes to the
    Illustrator files, scale the letters, and then import them to Fontlab. This is
    covered in the Fontlab manual and <em>Learn Fontlab Fast</em>."
