  Frensch, 27 <BR>Can a new typeface help people with dyslexia read and write more
  effectively? Britain has 2m severe dyslexics, including 375,000 schoolchildren.
  Frensch has designed Read, a sans serif typeface she hopes will help people to read
  and write more clearly. It works because each letter is drawn individually. She
  has produced a limited edition book that explains how she did it and why and hopes
  to sell the typeface via a website, <a href="http://www.readregular.com" target="_blank">www.readregular.com</a>
  &#40;which has yet to be set up&#41;. For individuals, it will be &#39;the price
  of a CD&#39;, while bigger corporations will have to pay accordingly. There is also
  a version for children. Email contact: <a href="mailto:natascha.frensch@readregular.com">natascha.frensch@readregular.com</a><!-/quote-!><hr

  body: The &#39;background&#39; section of the readregular.com website focuses on
    letter differentiation and simplicity, but the section on dyslexia doesn&#39;t
    actually indicate how dyslexia relates to letter confusion. What is the relationship?
