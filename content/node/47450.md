    thru it. I guess Jos you will have a lot of work in the future adding more weights
    to Museo.\r\n\r\nNeed Business Cards with Museo ?\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: Lol. Not yet. Museo is still selling well at the moment and I don't think
    she wants to gain weight(s). I am thinking of adding italics thou, but I will
    first finish Museo Sans (+ italics) and Calluna (+ sans).
