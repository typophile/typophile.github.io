body: "I am working on a redesign of one of my first fonts (Tirana released by T26).
  I feel that this fonts has flaws as it was my first. Since I feel strongly enough
  about it, I\u2019d like to make something better of it, so I am redrawing it and
  expanding it\u2019s weights. I think it is improving lot to the point of starting
  to become a different font, although the basic characteristics like the curves and
  proportions, which were my main motivation for going back to this font, are kept.
  I think this is a common feeling among type designers, if you were in the same situation,
  what would you think would be best the best way to release it? Releasing it with
  the same name and adding it something like \u201Cpro\u201D or \u201Cnew\u201D? Releasing
  it with a different name and assume it is a new font? Not going back to it at all?\r\n\r\nYou
  can see attached a sample of the new upper cases.\r\n\r\nThank you in advanced.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tirana0_5553.jpg]"

      is: I'm trying to achieve a new level of coherence in Tirana more suitable for

      and the amount of ideas combined in the same typeface gets smaller.\r\n\r\nobrigado"

    agree, but distinction can be found in details as well. All I'm saying is that
    I like the font the way it is now regardless of whether or not it resembles other
    existing fonts. I think by designing something yourself, you'll obviously be inspired
    by a certain amount of things, but you'll always end up with something unique
    (unless ofcourse you're literally copying a design). Important to keep in mind
    when judging Tirana is that it's a \"remake\" of Rui Abreu's first font which
    also already featured many of the characteristics that resemble the new herd."

    you have a corporation lined up to pick it up, sure. But there's a limit to how
    bland you can make it before an \"out-of-the-blue\" corporation becomes much more
    likely to simply go with another similar design, with even more polish! What I
    mean is, unless you put an inordinate amount of polish on this (I'm talking about
    multiple weights, widths, all kinds of extras), a \"special look\" is what will
    sell it best to a corporation.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    the majority of your newer characters are well done and definitely rise above
    the older ones. \r\n\r\nTry revisiting your G,K,R, and B and see if you can hint
    back to their original styles while maintaining the clean look the other characters

  body: It's an interesting question. For me the thing that stands out about the font
    is the way you handle curves - the C obviously but also the 3 & so on. They have
    a nice tension & invention about them. To make a the redesign worthwhile I would
    try to find a way to make the other glyphs with straight lines inherit some subtle
    shift and maybe tension as well. To me the glyphs don't quite all relate as a
    group yet - in either set. I think they need to. You could loose the weirdness
    even more but I think that would be a shame. The shift I mean doesn't have to
    be huge. Just there - & helping the letters to belong to each other. If you are
    not sure how to do that yet; I would wait until you are & then finnish a version
    2.0 You are clearly developing the sensitivity you need to do it. I think you
    can.

    on the upper bowl of the B and R, you might look at the B in <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/andrijtype/zion-train/">Zion
    Train</a> and use a similar form and see if you can use this same treatment on
    the uppercase R. The only other character that might feel out of place for me
    is the K, i just can't figure out why, but for some reason, i don't think it's
    quite working.

    opposite/complementary tension of the stokes. I will continue on the rest of the
    font, with this new ideas in mind, so that I can get back to the uppercases with
    more congruence.

    you were acheiving in the first version.\r\n\r\nMy notes would be to keep what
    you have here, but perhaps reconsider the following glyphs:\r\n\r\nG, R, 1, 2,

    it'd add what's possible missing to the G.\r\n\r\nR: I feel this character falls
