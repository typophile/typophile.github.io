  has her birthday today. ;-)\r\n\r\nAmongst others I'm giving her a subscription
  for a dutch psychological magazine (which she likes).\r\nBecause the first issue
  has still to come, I do have to come up with something. This item can not be handed
  over empty handed.\r\n\r\nSo I made this little card.\r\n\r\nIdea was to let the
  mind work.\r\nI used complementary colors so the brain will have to work hard.\r\nSince
  I was late again, I had little time to come up with this.\r\n\r\nAlso a small study
  concerning the colors.\r\n\r\nI used the negative areas of Egyptienne F LT Std.\r\nAnd
  placed them at random making it more alive.\r\n\r\nRemarks are welcome!\r\n\r\nRay\r\n\r\nPS:
  By the way, the byline is in dutch. Reading: annual supscription for mind magazine.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Afbeelding-2_4931.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Afbeelding-1_3930.gif]"

  body: I like the concept and you surely get the psychotic effect you want. Go tough,
    red on blue, blue on red. If possible use the backside for "explanations" and
    i wouldn't bring " the mind-lettering" a second time. Your wife will enjoy this,
    i think.

  body: The toughest for me are the orange & blue ones (firefox colors). I agree with
    poms that you should lose the second, smaller "mind" in white at the bottom.

    used the orange-on-blue-of-equal-values scheme. It was impossible to read. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Oke, it has done its job.\r\nI have finetuned it here and there.\r\n\r\nI
    do feel that the orange/cyan version has the most psychodelic colors.\r\nBlue
    and red are not that violent.\r\n\r\nI removed the second 'mind' and cleaned it
    up a bit.\r\nI think it has improved.\r\n\r\nThe dot on the 'i' was asking a lot
    of attention.\r\nSo I changed it \u2013 for fun - into a moon.\r\nMy wife reads
    the magazine in bed. (No remarks here, guys. ;-)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Afbeelding-1_5982.gif]"

    I place the subtitle somewhere out of line ..."

  body: ">No remarks here, guys. \r\nHaha, i couldn't resist to quote this.\r\n\r\nYes,
    the orange cyan version feels better. But i don't think that it was necessary
    to center the subtitle, the square format does enough for stability (is that understandable
    what i mean, my poor english). And i prefered the \"dot\". Overall very nice in
    my opinion. "
