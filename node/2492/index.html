If so, please refer me to the thread and this will die a quiet death. <BR> <BR>If not, what are your recommendations?  I've basically just got the fonts that came with my computer, plus a few free fonts I was able to find.  What fonts are essential for a collection?  What fonts will be most widely useful in graphic design?  What packages are cost-effective? <BR> <BR>Please keep in mind that many people (read: me) cannot afford the wishlist fonts.  I'm just trying to figure out a good, cheap starting point.  Concurrently, if there are any font-purchasing strategies to avoid, please let me know.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">What software are you using? Do you have page layout software such as InDesign, or will you mainly be working with word processing software such as Word? Also, what operating system are you using? This will determine whether it makes most sense for you to buy OpenType fonts or 8-bit Type 1 or TT fonts. <BR> <BR>I recommend investing in one full-featured family with a good range of weights and with smallcaps, ligatures, swash letters, etc. This will give you more practical flexibility than a lot of different fonts which don't have all the bells and whistles you need to do decent typography.</div>

For students who are interested in serious typography, who also use InDesign and Illustrator, OpenType fonts with bells and whistles are of particular interest.

And then look at the fonts of individuals, such as those who post here. Don't fail to look at the Dutch houses who are supurb and an education just to look at, even if you can't afford them. <BR>   <BR> <BR></div>

The $99 for the student deal gets you those and more. <BR> <BR>Not being in this game I have a different perspective: I would be glad to hear from you pros what you think is your best stuff - and that of others. I don't see anything wrong with it.  <BR> <BR>Your list is really interesting, and includes one of your own. And I don't think you were being a 'huckster'. <BR> <BR>When people have poured their heart into producing something of value, I just don't see why they can't say they love it, even though it is for sale. We are smart enough to take into allowance the source, and discount accordingly.  <BR> <BR>In the case of Thomas, he identified his bias, and to me that makes his recommendation very fair and above board. Same with Giampa. People can look and make up their own minds. Advertising is just not 'dirty', so long as it is honest. <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well William, I recommended Adobe Garamond as the &quot;full sort&quot; typeface. That was a couple years ago, before OT was so viable. Now there is a larger choice of typefaces that have all the bells and whistles. <BR> <BR>Also, my list was for an educational establishment, and as you say William, individuals should personalize more. <BR> <BR>I've been using Adobe Garamond since it came out. It was the first digital font with all the typographic goodies, and I loved it. As I say in my article, it restored the diginity of the Garamond line. <BR> <BR>However, I recently received a book of poetry from a friend (the designer) who had set it in Adobe Garamond, and it has become so overexposed it just looked so bland and like a corporate brochure, I couldn't bring myself to read it. <BR> <BR>Myriad I recommended as the most affordable extended-family sans, which was true. However, I have become increasingly anti-Adobe recently (primarily for their marketing policies, and that tends to color my feelings towards their type designs), and sensitive to plagiarism, and am now very critical of Myriad (along with FF Transit and Prima) as a knock-off of Frutiger. <BR> <BR>So, in my list of recommendations, I compromised for affordability. Damn, it's so easy to get corrupted by money. <BR> <BR>OK, you're right, Thomas did identify his bias, but he went ahead and used the phrase &quot;amazing deal&quot; anyway, as if identifying one's bias makes it then OK to be a total hypemeister.  <BR> <BR>The Display and Novelty fonts in the Adobe Type Classics for Learning are a terrible collection of cliches. Did Adobe actually consult with anyone in Education before putting together this collection? I doubt it. <BR> <BR>While I'm on this hobby horse, many of the Type Classics are not even remotely classic! Chapparal, Warnock, Cronos, Nueva?  Perhaps Myriad, Minion can be considered to have become classics recently, but in general the name of this package is somewaht misleading &ndash; hardly the way to package a product for education. <BR> <BR>In fact, some of the only classics here are those that Adobe elsewhere identifies as Adobe Originals &ndash; Caslon, Jenson, Garamond. Talk about NewSpeak!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hype is hype (ie exaggeration), irrespective of intent. <BR> <BR>Given Adobe's near monopolistic position in  type distribution for professional graphic designers, it's hard to consider Adobe Type Classics for Learning to be an &quot;Amazing Deal&quot; &ndash; it's their usual deal, giving away fonts for next to nothing. Is anybody really amazed any more that they do this? <BR> <BR>I would be pleasantly surprised if they had consulted with several leading typographic educators, and put together a package that showed more taste, restraint and accuracy.  <BR> <BR>Actually, a few years ago, I would have expected that. In the little &quot;Adobe Type Library&quot; catalogs (Type Guide), there is a very useful exposition of type styles; these categories could have been in some way integrated with a selection of Typefaces for Learning &ndash; that would have been a more serious approach to education.</div>

The only other major vendor with a library in OpenType format is Elsner+Flake. That leaves a lot of mighty usable, popular, and desireable non-OT faces out there, don't you agree? Not every library is going to be OpenType right away - if ever. Even the bulk of the converted Adobe doesn't take advantage of the really cool features and glyph substitution that OpenType has to offer. There are countless smaller productions shops alongside large in-house agencies which simply cannot afford to simply change over to using another type format (as good as it is). In some cases, it's akin to switching computer platforms. Like it or not, PFBs and bitmap suitcases are going to be with us for a hell of long time yet.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>That leaves a lot of mighty usable, popular, and desireable non-OT faces out there, don't you agree?</i> <BR> <BR>I didn't say that Type 1 fonts are obsolete in themselves &ndash; they are still widely supported and useable and, yes, there are still lots of fonts that are only available as Type 1. What I said is that the <i>format</i> is obsolete, but which I mean it a) has been superceded by a superior format (superior in all the ways that TT has always been superior, and also smaller and more efficient, a single cross-platform binary, etc.), b) is inherently limited to 8-bit codepage support in an increasingly Unicode text processing environment, c) fails to take advantage of new features in major applications and systems. Continued support for the Type 1 format must be understood as backwards-compatibility support. When I said Type 1's days were numbered, I meant that this backwards-compatibility support is not going to continue indefinitely. My guess is that MS will be the first to stop offering system support for Type 1. Then either Adobe will have to restart the ATM programme (unlikely, since they want to kill off Type 1), or some third party will provide a user-installable Type 1 rasteriser (FreeType?), or Type 1 simply won't be useable on Windows. The history of type is littered with dead font formats, many of which were once the dominant formats for entire industries. Just because you have a lot of Type 1 fonts doesn't mean they're going to be supported forever.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Some very interesting stuff posted here.  I'm sorry I haven't been able to get back to it sooner, but I really appreciate all of the input. <BR> <BR>So far, the two approaches recommended seem to be to aquire a large, nonspecific collection at bulk prices, and go from there, or to start with widely applicaple individual families and add on one by one. <BR> <BR>To tell you the truth, I'm still torn. Does anyone else have anything to say on this topic? I don't have a lot of &quot;jobs&quot; per se; I'm not a professional and I'm probably not going to become one, so I don't know if it makes much sense to get them on a per job basis.  Not to mention, I wouldn't necessarily know what specifically was needed for a job to begin with.  I am, however, very interested in good typography and design, even if it's not commercial.  I'll do it for myself if no one else. <BR> <BR>I don't know if this helps.  Maybe it just makes it more complicated.  The three complete serif families tht have been recommended are Caslon, Adobe Garamond, and Monotype Ehrhardt.  Are there any other recommendations in this line?  What serif families would you recommend for a variety of weights? <BR> <BR>Thomas, a question on the Type Classics for Learning package:  Is at least one of the serif fonts offered the Open Type version that would include all the aforementioned bells and whistles?

T1 as we know it today, with the .pfm and .pfb (screen fonts and suitcases on the mac side) files will eventually become obsolete.  But the basics of the T1 format still live on inside of Opentype.  Opentype .otf files are T1 outlines inside of an Opentype wrapper.  While it supports the extended glyphs it doesn't support the advanced hinting that you get with standard TT fonts or TT fonts with an Opentype wrapper (which are still shown as .ttf and not .otf)</div>

By extension you're investing in the future development of a good thing. <BR> <BR><b>Re: Fonts</b> <BR>Daniel, I'd say start with the core weights (Light, Roman, Bold with matching italics/obliques) of a few large, workhorse families (to name a few: Frutiger, Thesis, Benton Sans, Akzidenz Grotesk, Scala / Scala Sans, Officina). Then later, as projects warrant you can buy additional weights of the same families you've started. I'd rather have the core weights of a handful of faces than just one complete set of Univers, for example. Some foundries offer competitive &quot;upgrade&quot; paths as you want more weights. <BR> <BR>When it comes to display faces, buy them for the specific projects that warrant them. No sense in buying Bees Knees  or Base 9 if you never have to. <BR> <BR><b>Re: Dissing Adobe</b> <BR>If you're going to diss Adobe's classical pack, I'd say out of fairness we should lump in the Bitstream packages too. Schools aren't helping their students by making Ballon, Hobo and Handel Gothic available.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>But the basics of the T1 format still live on inside of Opentype. Opentype .otf files are T1 outlines inside of an Opentype wrapper.</i> <BR> <BR>No, that is not correct. PS-flavoured OpenType fonts contain CFF format font data, not Type 1. Yes, the two are related and both use the same kind of cubic bezier outlines &ndash; although expressed in a different way in the binary &ndash;, but CFF is a different font format. This is really obvious when you consider that CFF and Type 1 require different rasterisers. This is why I suspect MS will be the first to ditch Type 1 support: they don't want to maintain three different system rasterisers, one of which is for a format that they consider inferior and obsolete. <BR> <BR>One of the key things that made TT superior to Type 1 from the beginning is the extensibility of the sfnt font structure. The table structure of the sfnt format is what makes OT fonts possible; without it, we wouldn't be able to have a single binary format capable of containing different outline types. Type 1 fonts were a developmental dead end.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>T1 is superior to TT because the cubic beziers generally have fewer points and can provide better quality. </i> <BR> <BR>Cubic beziers require fewer points to define the same &ndash; or very similar &ndash; curve. The actual quality of the curve depends on how many points you want to use and, indeed, what kind of curve you want. The main advantage of cubic beziers is that they are easier to design with, but that has always struck me as a tool issue. It is possible to conceive of a native TT outline editor that would allow you to assign editing properties to points in the same way as you can specify a PS node as being smooth or tangent. Of course, the advantage of the TT quadratic b-spline outline is that both on- and off-curve points can be addressed in hinting.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>I thought CFF was a form of compression?</i> <BR> <BR>It is compact &ndash; hence the name, Compact Font Format &ndash;, but it is not simply a compression of a Type 1 font. CFF uses Type 2 charstrings. <BR> <BR><i>And doesn't Fontlab let you edit in native truetype?</i> <BR> <BR>Yes, but you work directly with the TT outline format, which doesn't include any ability to assign properties to on-curve points such as one has in PS editing. My point is that it would be possible to design an editing layer on top of the native outline that would make it easier to work with TT outlines. For example, at the moment if you want a smooth transition through an on-curve point on a diagonal you have to put in a guideline and manually make sure that appropriate points are aligned along it; there is no way to define a point as a smooth transition in the TT format, but that doesn't necessarily mean that one shouldn't be able to for editing purposes. I was discussing this a couple of years ago with Sampo Kaasila, the inventor of TrueType, and he expressed surprised that no one had made a really good and easy to use TT editing environment.</div>
