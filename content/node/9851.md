body: 'I&#39;m developing some OpenType &#40;CFF&#41; fonts in FontLab. Suddenly,
  I&#39;m getting a strange error when I try to print samples from Illustrator CS:
  <BR> <BR>&#34;Can&#39;t print the illustration. There&#39;s a bad font used in the
  document.&#34; <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve looked all over the web, but I can&#39;t find any
  explanation as to what this error means. <BR> <BR>The font prints fine from InDesign
  CS. If I save as PDF from Illustrator CS, that prints okay, too.  <BR> <BR>Certain
  characters seem to be causing the problem, but it&#39;s difficult to say. If I change
  one word to small caps, it prints. If I change a different word to small caps, it
  prints. But, if I change both words to small caps, I get the &#34;bad font&#34;
  error. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve tested this on two Macs, so I know it&#39;s probably a
  problem with the font. But what the heck does that error mean? It would be helpful
  to know what kind of flaw I&#39;m looking for.'

  body: I am assuming that FontLab showed no error mesage when you generated the the
    font.  Is your &#34;liga&#34; before your &#34;smcp&#34; in the open type panel?
    And would tere be a ligature in one of the words?

  body: 'The OT features compile just fine, I&#39;m almost positive it&#39;s not related
    to that. <BR> <BR>I think I figured it out: I decomposed all the composite characters
    and merged all the paths and now it works. I like to keep things flexible by using
    composites and overlapping paths during development, but I guess Illustrator CS
    is picky about one or both of those things &#40;the composites, most likely&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>If this is actually what&#39;s going on, it&#39;s not a big deal because
    I always do those things as a final step anyway.'

  body: I work the same way with composites.  I sometimes make a copy of my final
    FontLab file and keep it as composites just in case I need to fix something.  It
    would be nice if FontLab would decompose and merge on the fly when you output
    but keep the editing advantage of maintaining composites in your file. <BR>BTW,
    I have also noticedthat AI-CS handles type differently than InD.  The way OT fonts
    group is not the same and sometimes a weight is ommitted. Maybe Adobe will tighten
    up there OT look-and-feel amoung their CS apps in the next rev. <BR> <BR>ChrisL

  body: Illustrator CS handles alternate characters better in one way. You can select
    a range of text and select Stylistic Alternates from the OpenType palette, similar
    to the way you apply small caps or discretionary ligatures. In InDesign CS, the
    only way to get alternate characters is from the Glyph palette, which displays
    them with a little pop-up menu on characters that have more than one design. But
    it only works for single characters. It does mean that you can get access when
    there are multiple alternates, something which you can&#39;t do in Illustrator
    CS. Adobe should have both methods in both programs, as well as a better way to
    handle multiple alternates. Cycling through would work for me.
