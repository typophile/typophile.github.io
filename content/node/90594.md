body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nI'd like to use AFDK to compare the glyph widths between
  two fonts: a revised version, and it's original. I need an easy way to list which
  glyphs have been modified in the newest revision. If there's a way to do this without
  using AFDK that would also be useful. I'm new to AFDK so please bear that in mind
  when responding.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nJonny"
