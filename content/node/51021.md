  is viewable here: [[http://www.BirdInTheCity.com]]\r\nI'm sticking with the vending
  machine concept, but just updating the graphics/individual pages for a more cohesive/slick/professional
  flow.\r\n\r\nI'd love some suggestions for picking a new font for the web title/logo
  at the top.  I'm planning a redesign of the logo, but I'd like to keep a similar
  general aesthetic.  I'll be using this font in various contexts (business cards,
  resume, etc), so I'd like for the font to work in many sizes.  On the old site --the
  one currently posted-- I'm using Frutiger.\r\n\r\nIdeally, the criteria that I'm
  looking for in order of importance:\r\n1) Mesh well with the little bird logo\r\n2)
  Should denote \"Bold, Professional, with a little sense of fun\"\r\n3) Perhaps slightly-retro?\r\n\r\nAny
  suggestions would be greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nBrian Bird\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Hi Brian, check out some of the typefaces by [[http://www.ms-studio.com/fontsales.html|Mark
    Simonson]]. There are at least a few here that could work well.

  body: "Helvetica is the best all-round font around, but it is pretty overused. It
    can look great in anything though.\r\n\r\nIf it's fun and retro you want, go with
    'Cooper Black'. It's great! You may recognize it, easyjet use if for their branding.
    I think they utilized it pretty well.\r\n\r\nexample.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/birdinthecity_3536.jpg]\r\n\r\nHope
    it helps you.\r\npeace."

  body: "I know you weren't asking for usability advice but I would avoid names for
    links like \"demo reel\" (just call it \"portfolio\" or \"my work\") and \"mr.
    goodblog\". Every time a user has to think about what a link is you risk them
    just giving up on your site entirely. \r\n\r\nOn another note, I graduated from
    IU in the same year as you! Woot, go hoosiers."

  body: "Cooper black reminds me of Archie Comic Books\r\n\r\nI think the header right
    now could use some work but you could stick to something like Syntax or Verlag?
    Nice Sans serif with a little character. I'm not sure you'd actually have to try
    them to see if it works.\r\n\r\n--\r\narjun"

  body: "Brian, my thought is to pick up on the thick and thin strokes in the little
    bird logo, and try to find a font that has similar features. I don't know if you
    would be willing to consider a script, but if so, you might try something like
    Ribbon 131 Bold (see sample below). Otherwise, perhaps you might try something
    like Bodoni Italic.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Ribbon 131 Bold

  body: "Wow, a big thanks to everyone on some great ideas!  I'm leaning toward Chris'
    suggestion of Mark Simonson's fonts.  Filmotype Glenlake seems like it might be
    a good fit.\r\n\r\nClint: I'm also digging the stroke idea.  I'm trying to think
    of another way to incorporate it.  I just feel like a script font is too formal.\r\n\r\nfi:
    that's awesome about IU!  what was your major?  Did you take any telecom classes?
    \ I also appreciate the usability feedback.  I'm definitely hoping to incorporate
    some additional UI tweaks in the upcoming website revision.  In fact, I am going
    to be replacing the \"Photos\" section with \"Projects\", but I'll probably keep
    the \"Demo Reel\" as it'll house my newest demo reel.  I totally hear you about
    the UI's complexity.  I have freelance clients all the time that ask for something
    similar in the sites I build for them.  I always have to explain that my site
    doesn't work for 99% of websites.  Since my job is selling web \"bling\", I can
    get away with it, but a normal e-customer would just give up on the site.  In
    the next revision, I intend to add some additional interactive elements to help
    clarify that intention tho.\r\n\r\nKeep those ideas coming!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nBrian"
