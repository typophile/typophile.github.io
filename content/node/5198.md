  What do they mean/represent? <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve seen them one in print &#40;just
  the first one&#41; and once in the interface of a database software &#40;first and
  second&#41;. '

  body: A good symbol dictionary &#40;like Liungman&#39;s&#42;&#41; will tell you
    that the first is Scorpio &#40;although it seems that usually the arrow either
    curls to point up or goes diagonally down-right, not straight&#41;, closely associated
    with birth, sex and death; it&#39;s also the symbol for Separation in alchemy.
    The second one is Virgo; Distillation in alchemy. The third sign I couldn&#39;t
    find &#40;I checked in Koch&#39;s &#34;Book of Signs&#34; too&#41;, but it seems
    to be closest to Saturn/lead, although it&#39;s also similar to the sign for Leo/Digestion.
    Or it could be a &#34;facilitation&#34; of Virgo. <BR> <BR>&#42; Interestingly,
    the first two signs are on the back cover of his book! <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    apparently influenced by Chucks versions, also appear in Apple&#39;s Symbol font.  <BR>
