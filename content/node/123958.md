  body: "I agree that these are the correct non shaded versions. URW also has Roman
    Shaded http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/roman-shaded/ which should be used rather
    than the OPTI Roman Shaded because of the questionable legal status of OPTI fonts.\r\nIf
    you also want a lighter weight font with the letter-forms of Roman Solid you could
    use Solid Antique Roman http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/solid-antique-roman/
    or Sackers Solid Antique Roman http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/sackers-antique-roman/\r\nThe
    design of all three fonts pre-dates the digital era but I have been unable to
    find out anything about the origin.\r\nDon"

title: I'm trying to find a non-shaded version of this font, OPTI Roman C Shaded.
  The triangle serifs look vaguely familiar but for the life of me I can't remember.
  Can you help?
