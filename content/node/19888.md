  typographic book dealers, libraries with typographic resources, and stores with
  a good selection of bow ties and / or socks. Do you have bow ties in Europe? I don't
  recall seeing any except in England now that I think about it. Typographic bow ties
  would be nice, but I'm not holding my breath. I've got a few typographic socks and
  definitely want more.\r\n\r\nI'm interested in type specimens, especially any san
  serif stuff. Any pointers to libraries would be appreciated. \r\n\r\nGeorge\r\nI

    They generally have the best selection of typography and design related books.
    Be sure to ask to see the used and antiquarian stock, which they keep upstairs.

    lists of antiquarian dealers and not finding anything -- most appear to be in
    Utrecht -- so I missed Nijhof & Lee. So far they're all I've got on my list though.
