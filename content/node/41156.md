    Hamburg</a> are close matches for the \"Pro-Paganda\" text (the O in each font
    is a bit narrower than the example you've posted, though).\r\n"

  body: "Yes Ricardo Cordoba, TS Hamburg is very similar to the PRO PAGANDA, there
    is somre variaton on the O and on the height, maybe i'm not seeing a light version
    that it seems to be on the image.\r\nBut i do really agree with Jan, i don't think
    that cover designer used more than a font too.\r\n\r\nWhat about january - february
    '07 that \" ' \" is kind of kinky, and it seems flipped but then i say... do the
    cover designer do some variations on the type? I do design and maybe i would go
    to that detail!\r\n\r\nFutura it isnt we can even compare with the font on the
    right side the N and the M. What can you tell me about that?\r\n\r\nThanks for
    all\r\n\r\nJoel Santos // youremin\r\nsound & visual"

    is totally different from the one M on the right side!\r\nI checked out but yes
    it is real similar that must be it... but... what about that \" ' \" ... strange

    that for the headlines they zapped the counters into oblivion.\r\n\r\n<em>JANUARY-FEBRUARY
    07 is Futura Bold</em>\r\n\r\nI was going to mention that in my first comment,
    but left it out because I thought it would be evident! Oh, well.\r\n\r\n<em>what
    specifications on those letters did you find... revealing?</em>\r\n\r\nJoel, in
    the word \"PRO-PAGANDA\" I looked at the tail of the R (i.e., where does it join
    the bowl?), the way the stems of the A join at the top, and the vertical stroke
    and horizontal terminal of the G... Hope this helps."
