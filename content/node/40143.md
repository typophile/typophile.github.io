  is available anywhere? It's copied from his handwriting, and it definitely exists,
  as you can see inside an album or CD. This sample is actually hand-written, I'm
  pretty sure.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NY_font_4375.jpg]"

    sure</cite>\r\n\r\nyes, I second that: same letters are not identical. Why should
    it be a font then?\r\nF\r\n\r\n[edit:] Sorry, now I see what you mean: <em>some</em>
    letters actually are identical."

  body: If you were to look at the inside of a CD insert, where the song titles and
    other small text is, all the characters of the alphabet are the same, so it has
    been digitized for some time. Would it help to post a sample of that?

  body: "I should get out more often...\r\n\r\nIf I open the PDF page of the PW booklet
    in Illustrator, I can delete the background, and build an alphabet of outline
    letters -- <em>with alternate characters</em> -- then build words to my heart's
    content.\r\n\r\nYou get some font substitution notices, but they open up as outlines
    just fine."

  body: Yeah. I wouldn't suggest Rahlgren's method to anyone. You might find yourself
    using something which could get you into trouble. Accessing typefaces out of Illustrator
    as outlines isn't a legitimate way to use anyone else's work.

    floating around on the web a few years ago. I bet it can still be found.

  body: I worked for Warner Bros. back in the 90's and did many Young cd's. It is
    NOT handwritten. It is a font for mac. I had it until a hard drive crashed. Look
    at the enclosed pic, it is of a cd I made up of rough "live" Neil performances.
    I created the cd for fun and you'll see how the font looks. The cover with "headphones"
    was actually an EMI George Martin project that I worked on. Any can email me and
    keep in touch on the Neil font.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/neil-cd4_3608.jpg]
