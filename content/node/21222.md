  body: Well, Stephen, it should be a FontFont-typeface (therefore available at Fontshop,
    because our printer-description-file has the typical FF-icon on it). But we bought
    it in the 90ies, maybe it's not available anymore, ...

  body: FSI has no record of that style of Dynamoe, so it looks like an unauthorized
    modification.
