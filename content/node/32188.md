  used it before and could give me their impression about how it works in terms of
  leading etc. I'd love to see examples of it in use too. I have not bought the ornaments
  yet because I have no idea how to use them!\r\n\r\nTHanks in advance for your help\r\n\r\nPS.
  Anyone has the same problem as me with the font? The ligatures fl et fi are in the
  font but I cannot use them (all the letters seem wrongly labelled when I open it
  with Fontcreator - is that the reason?). In any case I don't think I should like
  to use them."

  body: "I have used it as a Type 1 font. Unless it has been substantially redrawn
    since the late 1990s, it won't work at small sizes -- say less than 20-point --
    for offset printing.\r\n\r\nRich Hendel (author of <cite>On Book Design</cite>)
    uses it some for display, and it works quite well. But leading in display type
    depends of both the size of the type & number of words involved, as well as other
    design factors."
