• The masters in the PDF are weights 100 and 1000.
• I don’t plan on releasing as many weights as appear in the PDF, these are faces I’m comparing to decide what weights to use.
• 1100 is an extrapolation. I’m planning to manually thicken it to having almost no counters and then use the result to create one or two superheavy weights between 1000 and itself.
• I’m not sure if the lightest weights are even worth using. If you think they’re horrible and I should just focus on the big end, let me know.

I’ve never seen Clicker before. And there’s no small number of differences between the two. And my Eagle revival was based on the ATF metal version, not FB Eagle. The only connection between myself and the Font Bureau crew is that we share an affection for twentieth-century American letters. And Font Bureau is hardly the only foundry to release types in this mode; there are at least three other revivals of Eagle.</div>

No, because there are also similarities to the majuscules of Eurostile, City, Agency, Univers, Franklin Gothic, Museo and other fonts that I referenced when working on this one. As for United, what, nobody else ever gets to publish an all caps face in multiple weights just because someone else did? Should everybody stop drawing multi-weight sans families because of Univers? Should the development of serif families have stopped in the 1930s when ATF and Linotype were done expanding Cheltenham?

When I said this was an original I design, I meant that I sat down and designed all the characters myself without basing the design on an existing face. I even worked without a reference photo of the painted lettering that gave me the idea. And I think that is original. No it isn’t a paradigm shift or some unprecedented idea like Frutiger was, but I’m not claiming it is.</div>

<em>• I’m not sure that 100 really represents a good starting point. Should this face start at a heavier weight?</em>

Maybe so - at the lightest weight the change in weight that happens on the strokes with a curved outside contour and a straight counter (e.g.. top/bottom of the round letters) is a little distracting, though perhaps with a touch less weight and a touch less overshoot they might work. But the blockiness really shows well in the thicker cuts.

<em>• I am especially interested in knowing what people think of the figures and the letter B</em>

The figures, again, work better as the weight gets heavier, in general. If you didn't already, I might try reversing the straights/curves on the bowls of 3 and 5 to see how that looks (so the curve is on the lower side and the bottom is flat, compare P). A 2 that looks more like a backwards S might be worth trying, too. My eye kind of wants an upper serif on 3 (compare 2 or C) to fill in that counter space (same on 7 would be a possibility).

4's diagonal looks slight to me throughout. I like 6 and 9 in the heavy weights a lot.

B seems out of character - that notch seems like it's from another font (true of & too), and I expect the counters to have a curved side like PR. I'd look for another solution. 

B also seems very close to 8, and D to O, but I can see the argument that in a display face like this context will usually sort out those confusions.

§ is a nice solution; £ needs work.

Re: lowercase, I can see the blockiness of this arguing for a caps-only font. But I can also see the quasi-hexagonal foundation of it fitting lowercase letterforms well (think of fraktur minuscules). </div>

Yes! I don't agree there's an over-population, but I happen to really like this "genre" of type design. I think we need more of all kinds of type, and I think it's presumptuous of anyone to suggest what should or shouldn't be designed. The more I look at type, the more I can appreciate the subtleties that go into each design to truly make it unique. </div>

Some comments (please have lots of salt ready):

I very much like the basic idea and the consistent way you've thought it through. This has a bit of a Constructivist feel (or maybe I'm imagining things :-) ). I can see it working very well on posters and flyers, or maybe magazine headlines.

I agree this gets really strong the bolder it gets, but I can see the usefulness of lighter ones as well. I wouldn't chuck out that 100 just yet.

The glyphs with the curved tops & bottoms are startling me slightly as well. Do they look tall? The "C" definitely seems larger than the "D". Maybe those could do with a bit less overshoot?

You asked about the "B", and in fact it was the first thing that caught my eye. I was wondering why it didn't have the curves that "S" has. I see you did the same thing in the "8" and the ampersands, but I agree with Craig that it looks a bit like it'd belong to another font. 

Speaking of curves & angles, I was also wondering about the notch on the right side of the "3" – that looks *extremely* angular compared to say the "6" and "2". 
On the other hand, I'm wondering if the curve on the bottom of the "2" may be too soft.

The "J" looks a bit clunky.

I love the "K"!

Is the "M" a bit too heavy? 

The tail of the "Q" looks a bit like it's embarrassed to be there :-) (though less so in the bolder weights). It could be bolder in my eyes – not bolder as in heavier, but as in, more daring. Also, did you try a (more) horizontal terminal on that?

The "W" looks a bit uncomfortable in the heaviest weight. The bottom looks quite tapered, but the apex seems very dark. Can you still make it wider or would that be too much?

I think the second ampersand fits better with the font – the first one looks a bit forced to me, and produces that awkward little corner on the inside. 
How about making the top of the second ampersand curved?

You might try an Euro sign with just one crossbar. That's not standard / intended, but I believe it can read quite well, and would let you keep a bold weight on the crossbar. (I wouldn't know if that works for the Yen, too, though.)

Thanks for sharing this, James. I'm looking forward to seeing it progress. It does look yummy. :-)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">For me this has a lot of problems. 

First, I don't see a coherent design. The DRP don't seem to have a reason to be flat on top and round on the side when the others are sort of the other way around. I say sort of because the verticals on the DRP are rounded inside and out, whereas the horizontals on the OSCG are round outside and straight inside. And the B is neither here nor there. 

Second, the weights of the horizontal strokes on the OSCG seem to be clunky compared to the verticals that are straight on both sides. I don't know if this can be resolved by keeping the shapes and changing the weights, because the strokes are so different. 

Maybe you can make it work if you take the idea of the DRP and make the others consistent with it. 

But in any case, I think this design would greatly benefit from being reworked to be more coherent. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">"NS Gothic is back" and it still hasn't grown a reason for being. 

Now before you all get back on the hating bandwagon, I am just trying to ask the "peanut gallery" to consider this design as a design, and to discuss it not just formally but also conceptually. If the hundreds of "type designers" who "publish" work through MyFonts and other vanity presses would just consider why they are making what they are making, we could be experiencing a golden age of type. A review of this page -- http://new.myfonts.com/whatsnew/ -- is close to heartbreaking to a true typophile.

NS Gothic, I maintain, looks like so much of the stuff in the “over-populated field of squarish sansserifs” that its value to the graphic design community is nil, so talk of its publication is folly. By all means, complete the font -- use it as an exercise --  but why does every little half-formed idea and rough sketch have to be published? </div>

NewGuy, what are you talking about?! This is a critique board. This is exactly where I'd expect to find half-formed ideas and rough sketches! And *constructive* criticism geared to helping the designer improve them. 

I wouldn't even demand that your comments here be "nice", but if they're not both respectful and constructive, it really sours the thread.</div>

We are experiencing it, in my opinion. It’s faster and easier than ever before to design a typeface. No more labouring in isolation over decades. For each great new typeface, there are many less great: that’s how Golden Ages operate.

		<div class="commentbody">New Guy - we learn by "failing". Every design you make is likely to be something you later regret in some way or even completely simply because you learn more and have better insight. Without pretending to judge James' design in that this context I do think it is worth asking if your design adds something or is just a "me too" design. But not necessarily too early in the process. You have to have room to see where something ends up going. Let it run a little.

James - my take is that optically speaking if the curved forms begin their curves closer to the interior of the letters they will "jump about" less. Some of that jumpiness it their charm really so you would have to make a choice. But if you feel it's too much that might be one way to turn down the effect.

What about letting the bottom bowl of the B be larger? I think a boxier top to the A will integrate with the others better. V too. Wider forms for split letters like s B R etc might work better too. Other letters too. If C is reference ( just for the sake of arguement ) Look at the K It might be the same width or wider but it feels narrower. So I would expand it's width a little.

I don't know if this stuff will work but it might be worth a go.</div>

What does everybody think about this design having softly rounded corners all around? I think that it could soften up the places where the curves hit hard edges and makes the whole thing feel less distracted and a pleasant in that worn out wood type kind of way.

		<div class="commentbody">James,
There is a major struggle that comes with bolder weights of low contrast sans serifs. Take a look at your first line and the word "INVISIBLE" and you will see Shilow, The Marne, and Normandy's blood-stained battlefields.  compare the N, B, S, V, E, & L. There is precious little room to accomodate the color problems with the stroke weight.
The N is too wide to feel at home with the rest but narrowing it brings the typical angle impingement of the diagonal. You will need some creative trickery to make a family resemblance out of that combination. Compare the crotch of the V with the N and see how they need to relate more. You solved the V by tapering the diagonals but this fights the monoline feel of the rest. The S and B are quite bolder than the rest and the horizontals on the E make for a tough sell next to the B perhaps the E then is too wide. I have done battle in this genre several times but still can't tell you an easy fix. I can only say that you have to cheat on stroke widths and sidebearings to get a happy marriage going. 
Keep at it, you may or may not find a good solution but whatever happens, you will certainly learn a great deal about type design in the process.

To me, it has a 20th Century signpainter look so how about a slightly casual companion face? Make the ends, not perfectly flush. Not in a "hey I'm sloppy" kind of way but more like something that was painted very carefully by hand. Try to visualize a baseball stadium in the 1940s with a sign painted like this, letters taller then you are on the outfield fence.  On the other hand, maybe the current version is fine the way it is in that context. Only one way to find out: Photoshop, some painty textures and a public domain picture of a baseball stadium or a goat. 720X360 (wink wink)</div>

in regard to weights, as a graphic designer i like having options and if you can make some fo the lighter weights work it would be very handy... especailly for things like logo's etc. maybe a superthin/hairline would work?

anyway, the heavy weights are grey and with all the feedback above to consider i think this could be a great design.</div>

No, that’s just what I’m calling it until I finish it. The original painted letters read “NO SMOKING BY ORDER OF DC FIRE MARSHALL”, so I started calling it “No Smoking” and then shortened it.

<cite>I think it’s done.</cite>

Thanks for the advice, Ray. You’ve really nailed what I’m working toward; a deliberately imperfect design, and sometimes it’s hard to let go and not fight for the total normalization of features that often comes with digital type design. 

<cite>James, what is the ’RoundingUFO demo’ you mentioned?</cite>

RoundingUFO is an incredible tool that was designed to create to facilitate the design of Unit Rounded. It can round corners, bevel corners, or add inktraps to an entire font. And it’s only €100. I haven’t bought the full-version yet, but I’m already planning a design that will utilize it. http://roundingufo.typemytype.com/ 

<cite>maybe a superthin/hairline would work?</cite>

This is as light as the font can go. If it gets any lighter the relationship between the corners and curves in letters like O goes from being a pleasant quirk to really distracting. I can fix it by curving the interior, but that loses the one feature that really justifies the font (at least in my mind.). </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hey James,

This is really great. I'm totally into the slightly rounded corners (inside and out). 

Glad to see you're pursuing this despite the comments above. Unfriendly, nonconstructive critique offers no integrity, thus can be ignored. 

I look forward to seeing the completed version.</div>

Have you considered trying some lowercase characters? Even if it's just for fun?

		<div class="commentbody">I think it loses something with the rounding. The appeal of this style is that it has a very strong, masculine presence, especially in the heavier weights. That said, I think this still needs refinement. To me, there appears to be a lot of inconsistency where curves, angles, arcs and straight lines are used both within individual forms (spline of the S, 2) and throughout (compare R and B). In particular, the bowls with rectangular interiors look "off" when compared to D, P & R. I'm wondering if more of the curves should be mirrored in the interior as with these. </div>

I’m unpacking my studio tomorrow morning and getting back to work.

I’m sticking to uppercase for now. I still get in over my head working with both cases. Although I have started sketching a slab that with a lowercase.

<cite>Is there going to be an ultraphat?</cite>
Yes. The first batch I release will come from the 100 – 1000 range. After that I’ll be  working in a range from 1100 – cyclopean.

		<div class="commentbody">I really like it - and there's a clunkiness that isn't ... Well, as digital as Clicker comes across. And that's sooo wonderful to see. 

Often, using digital tools tend to over digitize a typeface, and I think what you're doing is on the right track. It screams 19th Century signage, I'd hate if you cleaned up that aspect too much.

Little tweaks that are jumping out at me (and I know everyone sees things differently):

The balance on the R seems off. I know the leg is deliberately sticking out on the right, but consider playing with it a bit more. It's not quite there yet.

Same thing going on with the B, K and the E. They visually look right hand side top heavy.

The overshoot of the S and Q are cool, but I'm wondering if they're too much. If there's a happy medium between too much and not enough.

The A seems just a tad light compared to the other letters. Same thing with the I, T and W.

I can't tell if the X is off at this size. But an X is a BITCH to draw and get to work.


I actually like light weights a lot - and I sort of think the ultra ultra bolds have become a trend right now, that after it shakes out - people are going to be craving lights. Would love to see a thin version, actually.

But what do I know, I just released an ultra bold! :)
