  body: 'Thought it was as easy as ''Avenir'' but can''t identify it even with a clearer
    and more complete [[http://psd.fanextra.com/fanextraimages/fanextrajoinbanner.jpg|sample]].
    Closest I have at the moment is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/kievit|Kievit]].
    [[http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/source-sans-pro|Source Sans]] would work but
    /M is off. All visible earmarks look to match but I really don''t think that''s
    it. Still searching... '
