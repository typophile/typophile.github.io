  body: Alex, when posting wait for the error message then go back to your posting.
    Go to topics and just like magic your posting will be there. As for your logo
    I like it but I question weither the A will be read as an A. I guess it depends
    on the context in which it is used.

    of revising it? <BR> <BR>b&#41; done with it and looking for feedback? <BR> <BR>A
    and E are extremely versatile letters, <BR>both in uppercase and lowercase. <BR>
    <BR>I would guess that if you played around with ALEX, alex, and Alex  <BR>

  body: I haven&#39;t made any comments yet, but I have been following this critique.
    I&#39;ll have to agree with Darrel about reading Alfx. I think I&#39;m finding
    the &#34;E&#34;, but that&#39;s only because I&#39;m looking for it as a design
    critic. Tanya&#39;s direction isn&#39;t a bad one to explore, although the &#34;A&#34;
    and &#34;E&#34; shapes aren&#39;t exactly the same. As she has illustrated it,
    the &#34;l&#34; and &#34;E&#34; would need to be pulled much closer together.
    <BR> <BR>Have you looked into any other designs/concepts that you&#39;d be willing
    to share? <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott

  body: nlfx thats a strange name. Try this make the top half of your letters black
    and screen back the rest of the letter forms 10% Black run behind your last name.
    That way you could show enough of the letterforms to read with out being forced.

  body: I think the &#34;a&#34; form you have in your revision could make a much more
    e-like &#34;e&#34; than the one you have currently &#40;rotated and flipped so
    the flat side is on the baseline and it opens to the right&#41;. <BR> <BR>But
    you would have to take great care that it looks like an &#34;e&#34;, and not f,
    c, or g. <BR> <BR>I think the spacing on &#34;Heilmair&#34; could use some work
    as well; as it is, it gets very pale in the &#34;eil&#34; region, and &#34;ma&#34;
    is quite dark.

  body: I thank you all for the great tips. When I was designing this type I had in
    mind something that made the eye follow the curves giving the hole logo a unity.
    It sounds kind of crazy, but I was looking for something different. <BR> <BR>I
    did some new experiments, that I think look a little bit better. The big problem
    I&#39;m having is that I dont whant it to look to heavy. Anyway I thank you all.  :-&#41;<img

  body: '5{is still a difficult read, but I think the &#34;e&#34; in #2 is finally
    more apparent to me. That &#34;e&#34; relates better to the &#34;A&#34; than does
    the &#34;e&#34; in #1. <BR> <BR>Before you said you didn&#39;t want to make the
    logo heavy, I was going to suggest knocking the letterforms out of a black rectangle
    with &#34;HEILMAIR&#34; below. This would allow you to return to the simple shapes
    of your original design'
