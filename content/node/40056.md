  what the proper jargon to use would be.\r\n\r\nI'm meaning something in the vein
  of an Avant Garde Gothic, a Century Gothic, a Futura, and Avenir.\r\n\r\nHowever,
  not one of these fonts. I've used them in the past a large number of times, and
  am trying to find something new to brand a company. Something more 'compact' vertically.
  \r\n\r\nJust throw out  your favorites, so I can check them out. I'm not sure exactly
  what I'm looking for, but i'll know it when i see it. Damn, I sound as bad as a
  client!"

  body: This is true. And honestly, as much as I hate to say it, Gotham is super clean
    and nice. Especially in the medium weight :p

    was.\r\n\r\nSo far, Gotham's rockin' it for me, the problem is, you can't buy
    individual faces from HFJ :\\\r\n\r\nSo I'd need to purchase the whole family,
    and that means getting my company to foot a bill. Beautiful font though."
