  serif font but can't find it.\r\nIt's used for carving on a tombstone and needs
  to be renovated.\r\nIt could be a custom made font, but I wanna know for sure, that's
  why I'm asking the experts here.\r\n\r\nany help is appreciated."

  body: I would say it's almost certainly hand-done lettering. It doesn't look like
    anything I've ever seen, and tombstones aren't something that got computerized
    or mechanized in a hurry. When was the stone carved?

  body: It was carved in 1957, I hoped there was a font which looked a lot like it.

  body: It reminds me a bit of [[http://typophile.com/node/28862|Agamemnon]], by Typophile
    <em>cuttlefish</em>, but still fairly different. You might also look at the very
    distantly similar Schneidler. But I don't think you're going to find a font that
    matches it. It honestly looks like the work of a fairly amateur letterer, whereas
    someone who'd make an entire font, one that you could find, would probably be
    a bit more advanced. If you need to match the style, you'll probably have to hand-draw
    it, or find someone who can. But someone besides me may have an idea of a font
    that's close.
