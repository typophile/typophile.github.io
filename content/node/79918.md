body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI've done some research but not sure if I'm choosing the right
  aesthetic choice. Being a student Graphic Artist for some time now, yet I still
  have much to learn.\r\n\r\nMy question, I'm designing a film-magazine cover, contents,
  and several spreads for my portfolio to graduate from school this year. Moreover,
  I have selected Mr. Olson's Klavika typeface for call-outs, headlines etc, but I;m
  not sure what serif face I use for body copy that will compliment Klavika. As of
  this moment I'm using Caslon 240 I believe.\r\n\r\nAre there any suggestions that
  I may consider?\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAaron  "

    offered in both those threads. I have Museo, but I think the letter forms are
    two perfectly balanced in geometric sense to go with Klavika as body copy. '
