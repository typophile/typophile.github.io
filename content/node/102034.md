    to slugs cast on Linotype/Monotype/Ludlow machines.\r\n\r\nAnd they have nothing
    to do with ASCII art. Generally speaking, \u201Ccuts\u201D (the illustrations
    and/or decorative elements you see in these specimen books) were cast from stereotypes
    (otherwise known as \u201Cmatrices,\u201D or \u201Cmats\u201D), and mounted on
    wood bases."

    knowing anything about all of that I found this article on stereotype printing
    very informative...\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_%28printing%29\r\n\r\nn."
