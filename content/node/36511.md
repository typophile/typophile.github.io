  body: "\"Take Flight\" is based on the Blade movie series logo, so I guess it's
    one of those amateur pirated freeware fonts that were produced after the original
    film was released. Look for it on DaFont in the <em>Famous</em> section. It's
    name will probably loosely reference Blade or something with vampires.\r\n\r\n\"Blood
    Scribe\" is a custom degenerated Helvetica Inserat/Helvetica Compressed."
