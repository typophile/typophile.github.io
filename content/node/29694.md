  clue what it means, but does anyone else find this to be the most interesting font
  preview in FontExplorer X? I don't want hamburgerfonts-whatever or a quick fox jumping
  over a lazy dog. I like dogs. (and hamburgers...)"

  body: "<em>Zwei Boxk\xE4mpfer jagen Eva quer durch Sylt.</em>\r\n\r\nx, q  and y
    are very rare letters in German. Luckily, there is the name of an island in the
    North Sea, <em>Sylt</em>. And a word we took from English: <em>boxen</em>, which
    means to box, and <em>K\xE4mpfer</em> means fighter, so the <em>Boxk\xE4mpfer</em>
    is a boxer (boxing fighter). That also takes care of one Umlaut which is important
    in creating German-looking text. <em>Quer</em> means across. There are too many
    l/c e, a and r to make this as efficient as the <em>quick brown fox</em>, but
    it is a fun sentence and easy to remember. If you're German. \r\nWe have many
    more that are impossible to translate and difficult to remember, even for us."

    Eva?</cite>\r\nWho originally started using the phrase?\r\n\r\nIs it wrong for
    me to like <strong>STRANGLE strangle</strong>? Originally I just used RSTLNE like
    on Wheel of Fortune, but I wanted to see an A and a G. Then I wanted a word to
    arrange them in for my memory. \r\n\r\n(You could use \"str\xE4ngle\" if you needed
    an Umlaut, but then that would be silly.)"
