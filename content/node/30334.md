  body: "Are these the only letter samples for this font? Except possibly the S, it
    would be hard to pick letters that are less helpful for ID purposes. I think we
    could name dozens of sans serif faces that would be hard to tell from this sample.
    We need letters like G, J, K, M, C, W and R. The shape of the O, for example,
    can be easily changed with a little compression or widening, so it hardly matters
    unless we know there has been no distortion. The other letters I mentioned are
    structurally more distinctive, and not so easily altered by width distortions.\r\n\r\n-

  body: I think Gotham has a rounder O. I agree with Mike that this sample is pretty
    generic. I ran it thru Whatthefont and nothing quite matched but there were a
    lot that were similar.
