  body: "Caslon and Fairfield are good calls. \r\n\r\nTo my eye it combines the thick
    and thin contrast and sharp junctures of a didone (Bodoni/Didot) with the eased
    serifs of Caslon (as well as Caslon's Q) and Fairfield (as well as Fairfield's
    C).\r\n\r\nA classical revival (Caslon = 1725, Bodoni = 1790) with transitional
    details (Fairfield = 1949)."
