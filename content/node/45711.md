  |  Darjeeling limited]].\r\n\r\nAt the end of the film, I thought the typeface was
  perfect for the titles (even if the yellow was unreadable) but hey, whatthefont
  ? \r\nI googled it quickly, to see if someone on earth already asked himself the
  same question. \r\n\r\nThe [[http://typophile.com/node/36831 | answer was here]],
  on typophile.\r\n\r\nI'm not alone, thanks."
