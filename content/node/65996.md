body: "Last year I taught a one-semester course in type design at Humber College in
  Toronto, as part of the Graphic Design Advanced Diploma (GDA 3-year). Four hours
  a week in class, plus homework.\r\n\r\nThe project I gave students was to make a
  TTC (Toronto Transit Commission) font.\r\n\r\nBackground: In the 1950s, Toronto
  built a subway system, with comprehensively modernist architecture. As part of the
  program, a geometric, all-cap typeface was designed (anonymously), for use in signage.\r\n\r\nThe
  course began with digitizing the original drawings, to introduce the technicalities
  of font production in FontLab, and then proceeded with students producing their
  own designs for a matching lower case.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"htpp://www.shinntype.com/TTC_Fonts_09.pdf\">Here</a>
  are the results."

    or is it a mix?\r\nIs your class in addition to the usual studies?\r\nWish I had
    the option of a lesson like this when I was studying.\r\nThanks for posting, I
    know there was some requests to see your students in the Reading thread.\r\n\r\n(By
    the way, something seems to have gone amiss on the first page.)"

    to your students' work.\r\n\r\nI'm surprised to hear, though, that the face is
    often mistaken for Gill Sans, although perhaps some of the letters resemble it.
    Without knowing what it was, I would have mistaken it for another typeface, but
    it would have been Kabel or Bernhard Gothic - or something like that."

  body: Interesting to see the influences of other faces on their lowercase designs
    (Triplex, Futura, Dessau, Trebuchet, Kabel, Avant Garde Gothic). Were they instructed
    to start with an existing typeface or did they naturally find  that to be the
    most accessible entry point?

    to digitize the upper case exactly, then design a matching lower case that adopted
    the same formal vocabulary as the capitals. Despite such strict constraints, there
    was still plenty of room for interpretation, for instance in the the choice of
    x-height. I think they did a pretty good job of keeping things \"geometric\",
    with the exception of one who just had to have a grotesque \"a\".\r\n\r\nSo in
    this respect, it's a similar idea to Gotham, with \"given\" capitals and a lower
    case up for grabs."

  body: "Joe, this is not some long-lost typeface you've rescued from oblivion.\r\nIt
    doesn't need research and a \"definitive article\" to have its worth attested
    -- it's a very obvious part of Toronto's graphic heritage, one that any Toronto
    resident remotely interested in typography can't help but be aware of and impressed
    by.\r\nDesigners often notice these things, you know, without prompting by writers!
    \r\n\r\nI have a great deal of respect for your advocacy in trying to preserve
    the integrity of the TTC design, and like you am appalled by the piecemeal liberties
    that have been taken to \"update\" the design of parts of the transit system.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    whether the type system is corrupted or not, a large amount of the original signage
    remains, and this is typographically relevant and a suitable subject for a type
    design project, with or without your contribution. Making \"found\" lettering
    into typefaces is a commonplace for type designers. For instance, I was greatly
    inspired by the old lettering on the downtown Toronto post office (now the Air
    Canada Centre), in the design of Fontesque. I have considered publishing a version
    of the TTC typeface in the past, for example, as something for the goody bag at
    Typecon 2002. And there is Gotham, which I also didn't mention in my original
    post, but which was quite instrumental in shaping my ideas for this project: font
    with lower case to match cap industrial signage. \r\n\r\nJonathan Hoefler's notes
    on his revival of the Fell types, when he showed that there are several ways to
    interpret a revival, and Oz Cooper's demonstration of different ways to overdo
    the revival of an Incunabula face, have both reinforced my interest in the multiplicity
    of possible revivals/interpretations.\r\n\r\nI was also looking to move away from
    the type design courses I have taught in the past, where the emphasis I felt had
    been too much on individual expression. So you see, there are many reasons I came
    up with this project, none of which have anything to do with a certain pundit.\r\n\r\nCertainly,
    you are responsible for publishing the original drawings online, but I didn't
    actually tell my students those drawings existed, and I had never seen them. I
    had wondered whether any of them would work from the signage directly (rubbings,
    drawings, or photos), or go to the TTC offices and find source material, but thanks
    to the Internet and Google, they discovered the scans of the original drawings
    online, and so they all took the straightforward route and worked from those.
    I didn't have a problem with that, although I would have been extremely impressed
    if someone had worked more immediately from the image in the wall tiles, trying
    to capture some of the quality of that medium."
