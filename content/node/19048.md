  Layout Creator (theres no abkhazian language and keyboard layout in system). But
  now I want to prepare the same Unicode OT fonts for Mac, but cant find the tool
  to create layout. What to do? IS there any application like MKLC but for MAC.\r\nThanks "

    for him to select it - so he needs to actually make a\r\nkeyboard for it. I used
    to use ResEdit for that with great success,\r\nbut it doesn't work on OSX.  :-(\r\n\r\nBTW,
    is Tibetan (script and keyboard) supported on OSX?\r\nIf not, is there a good
    relatively inexpensive font that does?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    all information you need to produce Unicode keyboard layout for your language
    is there.\r\nBig thanks goes to Mr. Alan Wood... :-)\r\nI suggest using Google
    to find information about your language usage on computers before. May be it's
    already done for OS X ...\r\n\r\nFrom this page:\r\n\"Ukelele provides a graphical
    interface for creating or modifying Unicode keyboard layout files for Mac OS X
    10.2 onwards. It allows you to start from scratch, or to modify an existing keyboard.
    Characters can be dragged from the Character Palette, or from other programs that
    can display the characters that you want to use.\""

    body: "Thank, Miguel. Thanks all.\r\nUkelele is realy what I need. \r\nIts true,
      abkhazian language have no input in <languages> or <keyboard>. So if you make
      a font using proper unicode places for national characters you need to create
      special keyboard layout until Microsoft and Apple dont include it oficialy.\r\nThanks
      again.\r\nAkhra."

  body: 'I am a Mac novice, forgive my terminology ignorance.  I have created a custom
    keyboard layout for Hungarian using Ukelele.  It works great.  The question is:
    How to create a custom flag to show up when this keyboard layout is activated?  The
    reason being that I also need to make a custom Ukrainian layout and want to be
    able to distinguish them easily (Custom, because I just don''t like and am not
    used to the default layouts).'
