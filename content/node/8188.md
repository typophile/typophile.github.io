  body: I had a wonderfully inspiring visit with the TypeOff folks during a recent
    visit to Germany and I look forward to doing it again. Thanks to their efforts,
    a true dialog and dynamism in this field has emerged from a historically important
    source of type development. Its great to see some coverage from the press, too.
    Keep up the good work, while having fun in the process. <BR> <BR>Leon Mayeri <BR>Berkeley,
