  features for the first time a simple method of synchronizing glyphs and enables
  real time multi-glyph editing.\r\n\r\nIt's a browser based software so no installation
  required\r\n\r\nI'm very interested interested in your opinion about it "

    body: "Hi Synthview\r\n\r\nWe take FontArk very seriously, and aim to make it
      a full professional font design software. Obviously we still have some work
      to do, but we've made some pretty decent progress so far.\r\n\r\nI'm not familiar
      with any other skeleton based font builder, would you mind link me to one?\r\n\r\nDid
      you try FontArk? and would you mind to let me demonstrate it to you? I can show
      you what it's capable of  in a 5 minutes screen-share demonstration.\r\n\r\nIt
      can be interesting to hear your opinion on it afterwards... for good or bad\r\nTell
      me if you're interested\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I think this project has potential. It's not common to see this kind of iniciative
    on web environments. I tested it a little bit and those are my firsts impressions:\r\n\r\nRight
    now the app has some performance issues (maybe my fault because im on a old machine),
    and is also difficult to edit the nodes with the cursor. The smart multi-editing
    is quiet nice though. Would be great to have more control over the actual stroke
    (and not just the skeleton) but for basic geometric typefaces and prototyping
    this is really nice.\r\n\r\nCongratulations, keep doing good work!"

    body: "Thanks noisiac\r\n\r\nIt's a Big project, and not so trendy, but we love
      it :)\r\n\r\nWorking in the browser is challenging 1. for computing resources,
      since we allow real time editing of over 100 glyphs simultaneously, so newer
      computers recommended for better performance. 2. cursor sensitivity is different
      in the browser than on desktop and harder to be controlled. in some cases you
      better edit paths in 100% zoom (there are 100% and Fit, zoom buttons on the
      bottom right of the work area for quick zoom toggling).\r\n\r\nEditing the Outline
      of the glyph is done in the Outline layer <img src=\"http://fontark.net/farkwp/ftool/images/outline.png\">
      (the layers buttons are the big ones on the top of the work area), there you
      have full control over the Outline regardless to the skeleton (if that's what
      you meant by \"actual stroke\").\r\nYou can see it here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYMyuffi1O0#t=64\r\n\r\nThe
      thing is, in this stage of the development, outline changes are not synced,
      you have to do it manually to each glyph on it's own, same as in any other software,
      and you better edit the outline after you've finished with the skeleton because
      currently any modification of the skeleton is regenerating the outline automatically.
      \r\nIt'll take some time until we'll finish the outline synchronization development
      and advanced outline modification tools but we're working hard on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

    just contact me here. \r\nIt shouldn't take more than 5-10 min and can be done
    easily with common screen sharing tools.\r\n\r\n"
