  Ornaments & Borders.\r\n\r\nAll picked from 2 legendary 19th century type foundry
  catalogs.\r\nI'm very proud of this release, the quality is amazing and they are
  all vectorized by hand, with great attention to the details and the soul of this
  decorative art.\r\n\r\n\"PRINTER'S PARADISE\" contains 430 frames and 179 seamless
  patterns, taken directly from George Bruce's Son & Co Type Catalog (1882). The seamless
  backgrounds are perfect for retro packaging, posters and flyers, and you\u2019ll
  also find hundreds of eclectic borders, corner fills and embellishments.\r\nhttp://www.vectorian.net/collections/printers-paradise\r\n\r\n\"LUXURIOUS
  FLOURISHES\" is perfect for wedding invitations and certificates, with its 543 ornaments
  and 179 frames taken from Specimen Album catalog, by the Charles Derriey French
  type foundry (1862). If you need some authentic French penmanship in your life (and
  who doesn\u2019t?), this pack has everything you could ever want.\r\nhttp://www.vectorian.net/collections/luxurious-flourishes\r\n\r\nThese
  packs give you the exact tools a printer would have had in the late 19th century
  \u2013 meaning you can mix and match frames, ornaments and backgrounds from each
  pack, knowing they\u2019ll work perfectly together.\r\n\r\nI would love to hear
  your feedback on it!\r\n\r\nVincent,\r\n\r\nPS:\r\nI plan to release very soon thousands
  of victorian illustrations, coming from original catalogs - 1879\r\n- Zeese's Specimens
  Of Electrotypes: Comprising Cuts, Borders, Initials, Ornaments...\r\n(a very rare
  book, which was the foundation of a lot of type foundry illustration catalogs)\r\n-
  James Conner's Electrotype Specimen - 1888\r\n\r\n\r\n"
