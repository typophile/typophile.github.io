body: "One problem is explained reasonably clearly (I hope) here\u2026\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/94664\r\n\r\nAnother
  problem is: I am not exactly sure where the proper \"price point\" is for these
  handy tools.\r\n\r\nToo much, and nobody will buy them; too little, and I am giving
  away the farm. Unfortunately, when I Google, looking for some comparable products,
  I either end up with 404s, or I land on some page with an extremely annoying feature:
  a pop-up box appears smack dab in the middle of the screen and, if you try to scroll
  around it, it follows you. And, then, just to make it patently clear to you that
  YOU WILL READ WHAT I HAVE TO SAY, it blacks out the REST of the screen.\r\n\r\nWell,
  Bub. I have news: if you are going to go to such extremes to make my compliance
  mandatory, I am going to do you one better: I am going to close the tab BEFORE you
  have a chance to load your spiel. So, Mister Smarty Pants, you lose; unfortunately,
  so do I, because I was not going to be forced to read your stupid message before
  I got to the info I was looking for. What a winning business strategy: lose-lose.
  Who wouldn't want to do business with a concern with an attitude like that?\r\n\r\nTime
  for an irony break.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, anybody got any clues? I could sure use one that
  didn't come with a gun to my head attached to it."
