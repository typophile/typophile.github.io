body: "I'm interested in attempting to make my own, based upon a few handwritten samples
  of very, very amateur calligraphy.  Are there any tutorials out there that describe
  how to quickly design a font within any of the more popular font-creation tools?\r\n\r\nThese
  tutorials should be more detailed for newbies, as I have almost nothing in the way
  of schooling in graphic design (one year in high school, and most of that dealing
  with presses, cameras, and darkrooms, and I'm an expert, right?).  Should cover
  hinting and best methods of copying paths so that letters are uniform in size and
  shape.\r\n\r\nWith luck, they should also provide suggestions on how to scale widths,
  to produce Bold and Narrow versions."

  body: I bought <a href=http://www.logofontandlettering.com/>Learn FontLab Fast</a>,
    but it's now out of print, although the PDF ordering option sounds fine. I haven't
    gotten a chance to put it to use yet, but it looks very good from my skimming.

  body: It's not what you're looking for, but if you're digitizing calligraphy, there's
    nice article on [[http://www.typeculture.com/academic_resource/articles_essays/|TypeCulture]]
    treating about "Problems Relating to the Translation of a Drawn Letterform to
    a Digital Typeface" written by Eduardo Berliner. <cite>A dissertation that looks
    at the difficulties of translating by means of a tool or machine the human qualities
    of the hand-drawn letterform.</cite> It could be a nice prelude to all this strictly
    technical stuff.

    refining, but the essential difference is there: creating new typefaces is not
    typography, but type design.'

    a font quickly and easily using Font Creator Program (a shareware font program
    that I use as one of my tools--I'm very much an amateur). Caveat, though, in that
    to make your font any good you need to spend a lot of extra time working on it.\r\n\r\nThe
    books the others are recommending are definitely better, though, if you're serious
    about font-making."
