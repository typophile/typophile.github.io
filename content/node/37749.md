  body: It's entirely possible that the two fonts in question are the same outlines
    with different names, since Knockout is H&FJ's expansion of Champion.

  body: "I fired up iChat and there he was. ;^)\r\n\r\nJonathan thinks it's Champion,
    though it's pretty hard to tell for sure, also because he thinks -- whatever it
    is -- it's been messed with. The outlines of H&FJ Knockout and Champion are not
    the same, but they're very close in the capitals at the thin end of the spectrum.
    Most of the juju happens in the lowercase, and in the proportions in general plus
    various things in the terminal strokes of the C, G, and S.\r\n\r\nSee below for
    a comparison of Champion above, & Knockout below.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Metropolis_4516.jpg]"

  body: thank you! i think i agree with jonathan... it seems to be closer to champion,
    and has definitely been altered... like the T.

  body: "Well, I'm happy if everyone else is. I think this one would have fit the
    \"Gudonov Rule\", i.e. If the choices are so close that you'd have to see the
    original sample side-by-side with the choice to tell them apart, then the choice
    is 'Gudonov' to use. (I know this is bad, but the Rule is a good one, whatever
    you call it.)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
