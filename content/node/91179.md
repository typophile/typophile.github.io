body: Few months ago I came up with an idea for a typeface. I digged through the archives
  and internet, to check if it is similar to something already existing. So far I
  did not found anything close enough. Have you seen typeface like this released?

    include Freight, Vendetta, and, to a lesser extent, Maiola. "

  body: Very nice. I second Hrant's suggestion about the ascenders and descenders.
    Also, don't make the lcaunas "cut off", make them pointy (i.e. without the short
    horizontal segment), which will look more natural and less conspicuous.

  body: I mean the (sort of) triangular white space. They seem to be emphasized (noticable
    in the q) and look like they have this very short straigt section at the end.
    Both of which looks quite unnatural to me, it is even drawing attention to itself.

    dump that. However I would worry about\r\nmaking this design too \"natural\",
    lest it becomes yet\r\nanother boring mainstream contribution.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    \"y\" might follow \"u\" (\"g\").\r\n\r\nAnyway, I like the name; Kminek means
    Cumin."
