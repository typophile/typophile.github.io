    target="_blank"> Quirky Qwerty</a> by Torbjorn Lundmark, which I happened to be
    reading this afternoon &#40;after picking it up for only a buck at my local Barnss
    and Noble yesterday <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>&#41;, my guess would be the : &#40;colon&#41;. <BR> <BR>Although
    according to the Mr. Lundmark he didn&#39;t really invent the mark but more or
    less the name that we use for it today. And it&#39;s not really used for ambiguity,
    right? <BR> <BR>Maybe I&#39;ll find out the real answer after I read the rest
    of the book &#40;which is quite breezy yet informative&#41; <BR> <BR>Although,
    thanks to today&#39;s reading,  I now know that the ? didn&#39;t come along until
    the 12 century and that there once was a reverse ? used for a while in medieval
    times for rhetorical questions.'

    Chris is quite certainly referring to  <BR>Aristophanes of Byzantium, the scholar
    and director  <BR>of the library of Alexandria, who lived about six  <BR>centuries
    later than Aristophanes the Athenian  <BR>playwright, and is the one who organized
    the <BR>Greek critical and diacritical rules. <BR> <BR>[ Correction: <i>two</i>
    centuries, not six. ]'

    &#34;quirky querty&#39; which I received as a gift, after someone recommended
    it here at typophile. That would probably be the only pie piece in trivial pursuit
    for me the whole game. ;&#41; <BR>

    whose plays, I believe, often deal with ambiguity. The other one, the librarian,
    just made up the dots. The names for the dots we use, the dots, as he used them,

    after lunch and find it ... no dice. My B&amp;N has the paperback for 12 bucks

    was only a dollar? <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif"

    be on the &#34;clearance shelf&#34;, which probably depends as much on the local
