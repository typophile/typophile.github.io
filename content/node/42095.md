  body: "I'd second the chancery guess.  the 'b' and 'k' certainly seem to point to
    Chancery - not my favorite font I have to add, as I was forced to use it for a
    series of pitta bread packagings - and it looks a bit shoddy (imho).\r\n\r\nJH"

  body: "For some more specific 'chancery' suggestions, you could look at Zapf Chancery
    Italic (the 'k' is not the same in the regular version), or Bitstream Cataneo.
    All the other Chancery-ish styles I have found have a looped 'k'. (Corsiva, Poetica,
    Lucida Calligraphy and Le Griffe, to mention four.)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Thanks a lot for your suggestions.  It looks like I will be using ITC Zapf
    Chancery Bold and manually leaning it about ten degrees.  It's not a perfect match,
    but it's alot closer than where I started.  If the client has a problem with it,
    I guess we'll find something new together.\r\n\r\nThanks again for your time and
    effort."
