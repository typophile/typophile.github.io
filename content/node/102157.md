  body: "Thanks, that is pretty close. To me, It looks like they modified it just
    enough and maybe mixed fonts so it doesn't fit any established font.\r\n\r\nI'll
    probably just end up rebuilding it but, I thought I'd take a shot and post it
    here."

  body: my thought too. i suppose it's possible someone actually made that exact font,
    but to me it looks like LG sqooshed, and the e turned/cut or just a different
    font altogether. whenever i see a sortof matching e the rest is a no-go.

  body: Can't agree more with Jodie. Definitely Lubalin Graph to me and dramatically
    squooshed. If the /e is the only letter that really bothers you, I suggest you
    to borrow it from [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/avant-garde-gothic/std-demi-bold/glyphs.html#glyphs/541078/308|Avant-Garde]]
    (available as stylistic alternate though OpenType features). Avant-Garde has been
    designed by amost all the same persons (Lubalin, Carnase, Benguiat...) and is
    likely the sans version of Lubalin Graph (or Lubalin Graph is the slab serif version
    of Avant-Garde).
