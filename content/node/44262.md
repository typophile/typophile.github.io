body: "Hi, this is the first time I've posted on this site. I will admit, I am not
  very experienced in the area of type. I am currently going to school for Visual
  Communications in Oregon, and am taking my second course on typography. I am, however,
  suprised how much more interested I am in type than I thought I would be!\r\n\r\nOur
  first assignment for this course is to design an upper-case alphabet based on the
  letters \"Dakota\". This was a logo for a local store that our instructor got permission
  to use for this assignment. \r\n\r\nI decided that all the letters should be based
  on strict geometric shapes, with no compound shapes. And this is what I came up
  with.\r\n\r\nThe top line is what we were given to work with, followed by the alphabet.
  The bottom two lines are two sample words to see how they start working together.\r\n\r\nI
  guess I am just looking for some feedback, comments or criticism. \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nDani"

  body: "Nice work overall. Here are a few thoughts:\r\n\r\nI understand you were
    locked into the \"T\" from the \"DAKOTA\" logo, but \"T\" and \"Z\" don't follow
    the rules established by \"E\" and \"F\", and instead look shortened since the
    crossbars are set lower. While you are locked into this with the \"T\", you might
    find a different solution with \"Z\".\r\n\r\n\"B\", I think, needs a vertical
    bar on the left as in \"E\", \"F\", \"H\", \"K\", \"L\", \"M\", \"N\" and \"W\".\r\n\r\nI
    very much like \"R\", but there's a bit of tension where the circle and the left
    bar almost touch. More space here (and less space for the triangular tail) could
    balance it better. This same tension exists in \"G\", \"J\", \"P\", \"Q\", \"U\"
    and \"Y\".\r\n\r\nIn the tail of the \"Q\", the base of the triangle should sit
    flushly and horizontally on the baseline rather than being tilted.\r\n\r\nThe
    \"G\" reads almost more like a \"6\". Would a square or triangle be a better solution
    than the smaller half-circle?\r\n\r\nConversely, would perhaps a quarter- or half-circle
    make a better tail for the \"J\"?\r\n\r\nDavid Thometz"

    points, a few of which I had noticed but hadn't come up with solutions for. \r\nIt
    is really good to get some constructive criticism!\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\nDani
