  next year. I have always wanted to teach and I feel next year I will be ready to
  try and give it a shot. The reason for this post was just to see if there was anyone
  out there who is interested in learing hand lettering and to see if I would be wasting
  my time or not. I live in Washington State, so i guess this post would more or less
  aply to people who live here.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n-Charles Borges de Oliveira"

    question. I know for the Trajan Brush class it would have to be over a period
    of time, but for the Brush Script I think the basics could be taught over a weekend.\r\n\r\n:)

    through a school or at your own studio (or rented space)? This could be a great
    night time class. "

    be interested in learning.\r\nI may teach it at my calligraphy guild or I may
    rent some space somewhere. \r\n\r\n"
