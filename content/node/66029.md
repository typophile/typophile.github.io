body: "I'm limited for space on an envelope i'm designing for where i'm using a title
  that contains an em dash. I'd like to break the line, but wasn't 100% sure of the
  right way to handle the situation. At the moment the type is too small and the line
  remains unbroken while still fitting for width.\r\n\r\nI've read through http://typophile.com/node/41071
  and the commentary in http://www.typophile.com/node/30372, and I think I agree with
  what Bruce Kennett said. I just wondered if there were solid rules like \"never
  break titles even for the sake of an em dash\"\r\n\r\nanyhow, thanks in advance

    with the same thing.\r\n"

  body: "i agree too, but that's how the wikipedia entry has it\r\nim not sure why
    you would need an em dash in most titles, \r\n\r\nbuuut since its printed in this
    manner, and on websites like this, i'll break after it the same way\r\nthanks
    for taking a look :)"
