body: "I'm looking for high-resolution scans from pages of Arrighi's <em>La Operina</em>,
  which is a classic manual for calligraphy and for the 'chancery italic' approach
  to pre-printing-press typography. I'm aware of an on line resource of \"the\" work,
  but the resolution is too low.\r\n\r\nThe work doesn't have to be authentic and
  I'll consider examples of modern interpretations. I have a copy of <em>Three Classics
  of Italian Calligraphy</em> but it doesn't show enough detail.\r\n\r\nAny help appreciated."

    a very large scan, even though 72dpi, would work.\r\n"

  body: "If the P22 font won't work for you, there are scans available. They are only
    72dpi but the pages are very large. For study or for making a font (redrawn) I
    would think they are adequate. \r\n\r\nThere are two versions available:\r\nThis
    file is the original scans, with the pages in a horizontal format, uncropped.\r\nlaoperinadiludou00arri_orig_jp2.tar\r\n\r\nThis
    file has the pages rotated and cropped, final page size about 26x41.\r\nlaoperinadiludou00arri_jp2.zip\r\n\r\nBoth
    files are available here:\r\nhttps://ia801704.us.archive.org/27/items/laoperinadiludou00arri/\r\n"

    There are scans of manuscripts that exist.

    body: Thanks @typerror. I was aware of the origin, but I just wanted some larger
      examples so I could accurately measure the relative distances of points on the
      scans.
