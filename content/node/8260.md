  body: No no no no no no no no no, it doesn&#39;t work that way Ze. <BR> <BR>Ask
    yourself if you&#39;re you prepared to give away your work  <BR>and livelihood
    for free? You know, beautiful typefaces don&#39;t  <BR>just miraculously appear
    out of nowhere. There are some  <BR>people, real people of flesh and blood with
    families and  <BR>mortgages to pay, who actually put tons of dedication,  <BR>talent,
    effort and time into creating typefaces that not only  <BR>look good, but also
    work well. If they want to get paid for  <BR>all their work and dedication, would
    you deny them that?

    you want free fonts, just go to one of the freeware fonts sites  <BR>and get one
    there. Do <i>NOT</i> come here and ask for commercial  <BR>fonts for free or to
    trade them: it is prohibited by the user license.'
