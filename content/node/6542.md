body: The cheap &#40;GAP like&#41; Japanese clothing store Uni Glo in Wimbledon &#40;London&#41;
  has t shirts with Linotype fonts, Stop, Crillee, Slipstream and another for sale
  as a joint venture with Lino and the cheap jean retailer.  <BR> <BR>They are white,
  with black text that just repeat Stop, Stop, Stop, or Crillee Crillee Crillee or
  just Slipstream and finally a digital LED ASCII character set on each set. They
  also had some student designs that might not be Linotype tshirts. <BR>  <BR>They
  had them on the Manikins at the front of the store. I thought they just got them
  from Oxfam and stuck them under the button up shirts for the third world peasant
  look. <BR> <BR>The end is near!

  body: Some pics were shown during Akira&#39;s talk at TypeCon. I thought the T&#39;s
    and Palatino Sans were spoofs, but maybe they are real after all! <BR> <BR>Si
