  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello All, 
Its my first time posting here after watching for a long time. In my Graphic Design class we created a non-profit organization based on a cause we were interested in and created a name for it. I&rsquo;m concerned about school nutrition and eco-literacy so my non-profit is one that helps develop school gardens for learning and to provide the schools with fresh foods. The gardens would be run by the students of the schools.</p>
<p>I have created three different logos. I want to exude a playful look without being childish because the company has to get across its mission to the school officials and parents not just the students.</p>
<p>Two are more of symbol like logos and I am still working on them and finding the proper type to go with them. Please let me know your suggestions and otherwise. For the typographic marks I used Plak by Paul Renner, Clarendon, Glypha, and Gill Sans.</p>

<p>Have you thought about taking the S formed in the logo and creating a typeface (or just the letters needed) based around it for the word Sprout? It would create a stronger relationship between the logo and type.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">That is a interesting idea. I haven&rsquo;t tried that yet. I guess you are referring to the fourth image. My only hesitation is that the letters would be of a light weight b/c the S created in negative space is thin but I will attempt to execute your suggestion. Thank you!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Certainly, picture 8 is the strongest of the logos presented. However, I don&rsquo;t think the S in the leaves is a good candidate for becoming a typeface. I think the heaviness of the Clarendon anchors the logo. (You could try other slab serifs, but I think a slab serif is a good choice.)</div>

<p>This is my quick attempt to execute what <br> WhereIputStuff </br> suggested. I don&rsquo;t feel its working too well and is crude- my grasp on Illustrator is weaker than my grasp of a pencil. The letters are too stylized for my purposes. Perhaps I should draw more, scan, and then try again&hellip;or not.</p>
<p>Speter- Thank you for your comment. I agree with your observation about the S within the leaves. I like the feel of slab-serifs with it and will continue to try this approach. I have a few on my computer and I think I got some when I purchased my school&rsquo;s font set. What are your feelings/observations about the first image in my post?</p>

<p>Take the idea of Picture 8 and polish it up a bit. It&rsquo;s got the &ldquo;hidden message&rdquo; of, say, the FedEx logo. <em>That&rsquo;s</em> powerful. Go with it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I guess my approach to this logotype would differ in its choice of imagery. 
What I have seen so far are not so much sprouts but leaves. The image that comes to my mind here is one or a row of seedlings, just poking their fresh green heads through a mound of soil. 
I am unsure whether spelling out text with an image is a bad solution here, considering it has been done - and badly so - so many, many times. 
The alternative to this would be augmenting the image with some type. I scanned a page of sketches I made just now. 
Hopefully I can free up some time tomorrow to elaborate and these a little.</p>

<p>Also, it might just be the way I&rsquo;ve seen crits done in school and on this site, but you didn&rsquo;t address my original posts at all. While I appreciate your approach, not giving me anything to build on what I&rsquo;ve already done is throwing the baby out with the bathwater.</p>
