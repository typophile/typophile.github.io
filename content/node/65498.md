  body: "I would say this is a very popular style of serif font, related to Scotch
    Roman, which was designed around this same time. It has had many imitators, which
    continue even today. Font Bureau and Hoefler are just two modern foundries with
    recent adaptations of this serif style. You could use the [[http://bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsearch.php|Serif
    Font ID Guide]] with information about some of the other upper case letters (M,
    J, K, E, U, R and W, in particular), if you want to try to narrow down the fonts
    that may be close digital representations of this style.There are quite a lot
    to choose from. Just using these lower case letters, I had 189 families to compare.
    With the upper case key letters I mentioned you should be able to narrow that
    somewhat. Then you can checkmark ones that are closest, and compare them against
    each other.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
