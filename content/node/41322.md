  URL:\r\nhttp://www.dardenstudio.com/typefaces/omnes\r\n\r\nOmnes\r\nDesigned by
  [[Joshua Darden]]\r\nDesign and production assistance by [[Jesse Ragan]]. \r\n\r\nOriginally
  conceived as the brand typeface for a national retail chain, Omnes fulfills the
  need for a [[rounded typeface]] which is neither overly mannered nor excessively
  literal. A selective approach to rounding adds subtle visual interest, while a large
  assortment of non-[[geometric]] forms pay homage to 19th-century rounded [[Grotesque]]s
  which appeared well before the crisp visual style of the [[Bauhaus]].\r\n\r\nLink
