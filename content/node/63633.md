  touch for identity work. Following image is just a sample about overall look and
  feel what I am looking for. Any ideas about that font? Hints and tips are appreciated.
  I suppose squarish sans are quite common in sport branding. Am I rigt?\r\n \r\nThank
  you.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sample_5052.jpg]"

    would say so. The Dafont Techno>Scifi category might be a place to look, or if
    this is for commercial use, maybe check for Techno Sans at a reseller site. Assuming
    you are not literally trying to match your sample.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
