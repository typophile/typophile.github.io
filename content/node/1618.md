  body: No, that&#39;s definitely a font, I&#39;ve seen it before.  <BR>I think it&#39;s
    something like early <a href="http://www.t26.com/changeyourface.php" target="_blank">
    T-26</a>.

  body: Yves,  <BR> <BR>I think you are remembering T-26&#39;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/entropy/"
    target="_blank">&#34;Entropy&#34;</a> and <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/osprey/"
    target="_blank">&#39;Osprey&#34;</a> which were hybrid fonts made from overlaying
    parts of various letters to look like other letters. I think this could simply
    be someone&#39;s own &#39;homage&#39; to one of those designs.

  body: No Mike, I&#39;m pretty sure, because I recognize the  <BR>methodics in constructing
    the letters, which struck  <BR>me when I first saw the face. While Entropy&#42;
    and  <BR>Osprey&#42;&#42; are hybrids constructed from two or more  <BR>fonts&#42;&#42;&#42;,
    this one is assembled by fusing parts of  <BR>the next letter in the alphabet
    of the same typeface  <BR>&#40;Trajan by the looks of it&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#42;
    <b>Entropy</b> is uppercase <i>Missive</i> fused to lowercase  <BR><i>Memphis</i>.
    <b>Missive</b> itself looks like a mix of <i>Garamond</i>  <BR>and <i>Trade Gothic</i>.
    <BR>&#42;&#42; <b>Osprey</b> is basically <i>Entropy</i> with <i>Park Avenue</i>
    lower- <BR>case thrown in for added flavour. How far can you go? <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;
    a popular practice in the deconstructivist heydays  <BR>of the early nineties;
    see also P. Scott Makela&#39;s  <BR><a href="http://www.emigre.com/EF.php?fid=88"

    Max Kisman&#39;s <a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?M0" target="_blank">
    Fudoni</a> &#40;you can guess which faces&#41;.

    <BR> <BR>It&#39;s addmorph with a fake bold applied. I can not find a sample online.
    <a href="http://www.emigre.com/ArticleCoppingAnAttitude.php">Here is what I did
    find</a>. Brian Schorn designed addmorph while at cranbrook in 1993 though because
    it was based upon Twombly&#39;s trajan, a licensing dispute ensued and the font
    was never released.I have no idea where it came from, but I have a copy of this
    typeface. &#40;?!?&#41;
