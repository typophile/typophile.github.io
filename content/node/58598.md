  is a new sans family to complement the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/53885\">Organon
  Serif</a> family which I recently completed. Organon Sans will have the same six
  weights, have same stem thickness and x-heights as the corresponding Serifs.\r\n\r\nIf
  you compare character shapes of Sans and Serif you can see they are not always the
  same, but there is a familial resemblance.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Organon-S+S_6676.gif]"

  body: "Very nice work!\r\nThere is one thing i don't really like: it's the dynamic
    of the \"n\". I prefere the round start of the \"d\".\r\nI realise now that you
    had this difference in the serif, were it works quite well, still i'm not fond
    of this \"style\" in sans serifs, for me it always looks too hard.\r\nAlso, what
    about an old style \"g\"?"

  body: "This looks fantastic!\r\n\r\nThe only thing I could suggest is that the top
    of the vertical part of G looks a little bare somehow. Maybe it the top could
    be raised a hair, or the inside contour could flare a touch more, or something?
    \r\n\r\nJust curious, did you try a Kk with a horizontal connector?"

    be a bit too open and wide.\r\n\r\nThe W looks a bit heavy.\r\n\r\nJeremy Dooley\r\nwww.insignedesign.com"
