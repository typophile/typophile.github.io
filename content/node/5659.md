  body: 'Another first post today, welcome Wesley! <BR> <BR>I thought it was T26&#39;s
    Aaux, but I checked the website and it doesn&#39;t match. We&#39;ll keep looking!
    <BR> <BR>On a side note, I was just telling another fellow searcher that when
    you post on the type ID section, it helps if you give the thread a more descriptive
    name. Otherwise, particular searches get difficult to locate among the many threads.
    <BR> <BR>Good luck with this one. '
