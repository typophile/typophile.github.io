  body: I don't have a resource handy, but in one of the more recent TDC books there
    was a font design that had a similar feel and was used for a resteraunt menu.
    Maybe someone else might remember what that is.

    library</a>.

  body: "Wow, Stephen! I should pay you for doing my homework!\r\n\r\nYour suggestions
    are smart and much appreciated, though the handwriting in the sample evokes a
    bit of art deco, which is the flavor I am hoping to get across. Something that
    would capture New York in the 30s/40s. I would like to avoid something too cartoon-captionish
    if at all possible. Doesn't even have to be handwritten.\r\n\r\nSince you asked,
    I'm working on a book project, written by the late Dai Vernon, who is revered
    as one of the greatest sleight-of-hand artists who ever lived. He practiced well
    into his 90s, mentoring many famous magicians\u2014ranging from Houdini to Ricky
    Jay. His creative thought process truly revolutionized the art, so much so that
    he was lovingly called, \"The Professor.\" The sample you see above is from one
    of his personal notebooks; a list of favored methods for nullifying the cut in
    a game of cards, or otherwise moving things around in a deck of cards \"invisibly.\"
    He spent his latter years at Hollywood's Magic Castle, which, thanks largely to
    his presence, became the epicenter of all things magic. \r\n\r\nThanks so much
    for all the assistance!"

    has the right S's and feels similar, but adds more quirks than you probably need.
    <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dstype/estilo/">Estilo</a> is probably a
    better choice, but you'll need an app with good OpenType support to get the characters
    you want.
