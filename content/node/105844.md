  body: "Perhaps it's the size of the file? \r\n\r\nThe Insert Image option seems
    to have a file size measuring method all on its own. A  ...number/number... type
    of deal. I noticed that if the file size is kept under 100/100 or there abouts
    it works fine for me.\r\n\r\nHope that helps."
