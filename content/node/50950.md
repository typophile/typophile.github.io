  body: "That scene / picture / composition from <em>Raiders</em> owes everything
    to <em>Citizen Kane</em>.\r\n\r\nJames, I own a copy of Indie Fonts 1. Indie Fonts
    2 isn't hard to acquire since most of the participating font makers, like those
    featured in Indie Fonts 1, had substantial difficulty selling any of the copies
    of the book given to them by its publisher in exchange for the substantial sum
    of cash they handed over to be featured in Indie Fonts 2. Like Indie Fonts 1,
    Indie Fonts 2 did not sell well. There are hundreds of copies around and they
    are not hard to find.\r\n\r\nFor example, it can still be purchased new from <a
    href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/products/ptype/indie-fonts-cd-vol-2/\">here</a>,
    <a href=\"http://www.p22.com/indiefonts/indie2.html\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Indie-Fonts-2-Richard-Kegler/dp/0963108239\">here</a>.\r\n\r\nAmazon
    is offering 5 new copies at $20 apiece, and 7 used books at $12.95 apiece.\r\n\r\nIf
    the text typesetting and design of Indie Fonts 2 is anything like Indie Fonts
    1, I haven't a scintilla of interest in acquiring IF2 at any price. I might even
    express an interest in paying somebody to take away my copy of IF1 (joking). My
    complaint: the descriptive text typesetting on the sample pages is so small and
    hard to read it makes everybody who reads my copy of IF1 wonder aloud \"Why, why,
    why?\"\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

  body: "James A,\r\nYour definition of \"substantial\", may be different from most,
    or at least misinformed.\r\n\r\nOur method of self publishing the first 2 Indie
    fonts books involved a fee to be included in the book which was offset by being
    sent a number of books (100) that mathematics determined would be less than any
    wholesale rate would ever be. (therefore participating foundries would actually
    make money if they sold most of their books. The additional exposure has been
    reported to be helpful as well...not unlike advertising) This is how we paid the
    designer and for some of the printing. Our distribution was limited, but was somewhat
    effective: The first 2 sold quite well. In fact the indie fonts 1 book is all
    but sold out. \r\n\r\nThe books that James A is no doubt referring to is the Rockport
    publishers reprinting of the Indie Fonts books. We went with Rockport due to their
    tremendous distribution which we could not get anywhere near (in fact our only
    distributor that would take us at the time of the first book completely stiffed
    us and we never saw a cent from those). Our biggest disappointment with this arrangement
    was that Rockport decided to set the descriptive text a point size smaller than
    we had, in order to fit text in the event of a translated version of the book
    (which never happened). This reduction for our readable 5 point Faceplate to a
    miniscule 4 point made it unfortunately difficult to read. The other unfortunate
    change from our first edition was the Indie Fonts 2 being printed in halftone
    grey rather than the spot silver that makes the first edition quite appealing.
    The third volume was printed exclusively by Rockport with our concerns about the
    descriptive point size addressed, but late in the process we were told it would
    be a flexbound cover to match the reissues of 1 & 2 that Rockport was releasing.
    Our compromise is that we commissioned an edition of hardcover Indie Fonts 3 to
    self distribute.\r\n\r\nTo answer your \"Why why why\", it is because you bought
    your indie fonts book from someone selling the Rockport reprints rather than directly
    from a foundry who was in the books.  The small text is in the Rockport Edition.
    For full disclosure, we bought out some of the last stock of the indie fonts 1
    book from Rockport and are selling them (at a special sale price, act now!) because
    we have no more of the first edition.\r\nhttp://www.p22.com/indiefonts/indie1.html\r\n\r\nSo

  body: James is referring to the original printing; I sent him my copy. We had to
    create our own specimens which, in retrospect is rather odd. I'm not a graphic
    designer so I had to plonk down cash for Illustrator just to be involved. I've
    been in many font books since then but I've never had to create my own specimens.
    It was very, very expensive to get in on Indie Fonts 1 and impossible to sell,
    at least with Canadian shipping costs. In two years I managed to sell 2 books.
    We (the participants) were told not to drop the price so I was unable to offer
    them at a discount. I later noticed that the book store versions had jackets but
    mine did not. A couple of years later I asked Tamye/Richard if I could lower the
    price as they hadn't been selling and was ignored twice. Perhaps I could have
    sold some if I could have dropped the price. So I donated/dumped about 70 books
    to/at a college and didn't bother keeping one for myself. So, at least for me,
    Indie Fonts was a bad experience. But I thought it looked pretty good.

  body: "From memory of correspondence between Ray and myself, Rina managed to sell
    a few copies on Ebay at a snipped price, and that was the only way Ray was able
    to sell any of the substantial number of the books allocated to him.\r\n\r\nA
    technical note for James Grieshaber and Richard Kegler&#8212;Indie Fonts could
    have been a much better designed book if you had made the page / book format rectangular
    in a landscape orientation. A rectangular format would have allowed twice as much
    width for the columns containing the descriptive text set in Faceplate sans condensed
    and left an adjacent square area for each font sample. You would have wound up
    with a rectangular-shaped book and lost the square appearance, but at least the
    area for the font samples would still be square, and the column for the descriptive
    text would have been wide enuff to use a normal width font or the same Faceplate
    condensed series at a larger point size.\r\n\r\n@Kegler: <em>Your definition of
    \u201Csubstantial\u201D, may be different from most, or at least misinformed.</em>\r\n\r\n\"substantial\"
    is a subjective word with variable meaning depending on context and the person
    using it. I spoke of participants having \"substantial difficulty selling any
    of the copies of the book given to them by its publisher in exchange for the substantial
    sum of cash they handed over to be featured in [one or another Indie Fonts book]\".
    Apart from that, I haven't defined \"substantial\". I only used the word twice.
    How readers define my use of the word is largely up to them, as I did not give
    any figures or sums.\r\n\r\nAccording to Ray, the \"substantial\" difficulty he
    had selling any copies of the books allotted to him was quite substantial, so
    substantial he wound up giving most of his stock away. How substantial was the
    fee paid by participating font makers to be featured in the IF books? I don't
    know because nobody has ever given me a figure in dollars, and I haven't quoted
    any figure(s). So there goes that. People will have to use their imaginations.\r\n\r\n<em>The
    books that James A is no doubt referring to is the Rockport publishers reprinting
    of the Indie Fonts books.</em>\r\n\r\nIncorrect. Mine is a first edition printing.
    The imprint proves that.\r\n\r\n<em>To answer your \u201CWhy why why\u201D, it
    is because you bought your indie fonts book from someone selling the Rockport
    reprints rather than directly from a foundry who was in the books. The small text
    is in the Rockport Edition.</em>\r\n\r\nWrong. It's a first edition. Evidently
    you are making excuses for what is a poorly-designed book. \r\n\r\nj a m e s"

  body: "I am sorry Ray, I didn't know you had such a hard time with it. It was an
    experimental concept in co-publishing a specimen book. Each foundry did design
    their own sections, giving freedom to show their work as they saw fit. We were
    not out to fleece anyone. We did at one point offer to buy back copies of Indie
    Fonts 1 we also had foundries buy extra copies. I think the exposure garnered
    from being in the book hasn't hurt anyone involved. I have never intentionally
    ignored any email, so I am sorry there Ray, the request to have everyone keep
    the price at retail for a while was not for that long and I recall sending emails
    to say you could sell as you saw fit. There must have been a us/can border email
    filter. You lived an hour away from us at the time. Funny how the internet warps
    actual proximity.\r\n\r\nThe \"fee\" was less than the cost of a quarter page
    ad in a monthly design magazine. In Indie Fonts each foundry had 17 pages.\r\n\r\nI
    am sorry James, I assumed that because you were complaining about the small text
    that you were referring to the second edition. By comparison the first edition
    text is huge. The apparent lack of success in design leaves an opportunity for
    you to do it one better. Feel free."
