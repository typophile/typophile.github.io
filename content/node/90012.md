  to use Arial or Helvetica...but what is this?\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/birthofahat_4253.jpeg]"

    Image\u201D link below the bottom left corner of the Comment box. Make sure there
    are no spaces in your file name and try to keep images 500px wide to avoid a horizontal
    scroll."

  body: "~75% of people do. Perhaps a link to a video clip would help? Whatever it
    is, it looks as though it has a gausian blur filter, which is most likely due
    to poor film quality. Given it\u2019s from 1920, it can\u2019t be Helvetica, Airal,
    Vag, Univer so age could be a tell. The tail on the lowrcase a, and the capital
    R are also distinct. And ah-ha! I just located <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/59329\">an
    old Typophile thread on 1920\u2019s san-serif fonts</a>. There\u2019s plenty of
    suggestions there."

  body: Thanks for posting the thread.  You're right...not a Gaussian blur filter
    (although that is what I apply to newly made titles to match the old film) but
    an old (1930s or 40s?) 16mm dupe print.

  body: Looks a lot like Miller & Richard's English Grotesque, an old nineteenth century
    face. Never digitized as far as I know, although I think it was one of Kris Sowersby's
    influences with Founders Grotesk.

  body: "I remember reading that, now that you mention it. I saw a M&R specimen book
    at the Newberry Library in Chicago a couple of years ago (doing research on Bookman).
    I didn't make a note about the publication date unfortunately, but I think it
    was 1880s or 1890s. I surreptitiously snapped some photos of pages that caught
    my eye, including this one:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/englishgrot_6375.jpg]\r\n\r\nYou
    can see it matches the details in the OP's image. The difference in weight can
    be attributed to film reverse and/or exposure issues."

  body: I like that grotesque! It has all the liveliness that has been blandified
    away from Helvetica. More than Akizidenz as well.
