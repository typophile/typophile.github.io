  body: Well, they <em>are</em> very characteristic, so chances of finding similar
    fonts are very slim. Why wouldn't you use the actual Neo Sans or Neo Tech faces
    if you like them so much?

  body: "Well it's a bit complicated, since I don't have those specific fonts right
    now.\r\n\r\n But here is another font that looks like the Neo Family and I'd also
    like to know it's name.\r\n\r\n Thanks again."
