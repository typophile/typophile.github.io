  Hattenbach (born 1961) is an espresso-fueled art director and graphic designer specializing
  in type and logo solutions. \r\n\r\nAfter two decades in the industry, a third of
  that running his own studio, he has managed to keep his work strong and compelling
  via a dynamic balance of experimentation and traditionalism: a blend which has worked
  to the benefit of clients such as Greenpeace, Amnesty International, Telia, and
  Hennes & Mauritz. \r\n\r\nHe is an avid traveler with a special passion for Italy,
  and proudly claims A.S. Roma as his favorite soccer team. He, wife Catharina, son
  Victor and daughter Sarah live in a sunny flat in downtown Stockholm. \r\n\r\nStefan's
  work is released under his [[MAC Rhino]] label.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>External Links</strong>\r\n<a
