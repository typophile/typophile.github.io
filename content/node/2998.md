  body: Hilarious. We get irrelevant and stupid exactly as Coltz parodies us. But
    we&#39;ve also got the guts to make mistakes in public, and to learn from each
    other, which I find kind of endearing.

    is just to illustrate how something some questions in some forums are like Daidala
    describe&#41; <BR> <BR> <BR>The answer is not very interesting, but to don&#39;t
    died without to know... <BR> <BR>Well, I still don&#39;t know for sure: &#34;Font&#34;
    came from French &#34;Fonte&#34; who describe same thing from old hot metal days.
    Police, is more the list, the content of what you get from a font &#40;how many
    a, how many e, etc.&#41; <BR> <BR>But one day in early days of computers, a stupid
    translator guy decided to use that Polices in menus rather that simply Fontes.
    <BR> <BR>Now, we stick to this horrible double meanning word. <BR>'
