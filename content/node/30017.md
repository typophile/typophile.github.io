  body: I still think it might be hand-drawn or at least custom. I have an Altoids
    tin here as well. You can find some like it if you do a search at myfonts for
    slabserif but I didn't find anything all that close.

  body: I believe we've visited the Altoids fonts here before and they were determined
    to be custom. The original label was hand drawn and then a proprietary font was
    made from those forms.
