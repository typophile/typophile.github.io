  wondering if someone would be kind enough to offer some advice on font selection
  for the header?\r\n\r\nTrying for a simple retro theme.  Attached clip-art will
  feature prominently on main page.  Header will be underneath.\r\n\r\nLooking for,\r\n\r\nRetro\r\nSlightly
  comical + self deprecating\r\nA little authoritative.\r\n\r\nI have been looking
  for a bold sans-serif (headline) but possibly with slightly irregular lettering.\r\n\r\nMaybe
  something like,\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/aerotype/pacifico/regular/\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/ortizlopez/olnewsbytes/bold/\r\n\r\nSo
  many choices its easy to get lost !!\r\n\r\nWould appreciate any suggestions/pointers.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance,\r\n\r\nMatt\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    might suit your needs. I searched in Veer's type collection with the [[http://www.veer.com/search/results.aspx?keyword=1950s%20retro%20bold%20sans&producttype=TYP&resulttab=vr&category=Type|search
    terms]] \u201C1950s retro bold sans\u201D.\r\n\r\nIt may also be fun for you to
    have a rotating nameplate, sort of the way the T changes here at Typophile, or
    the way the banner changes over at [[http://new.typographica.org/|Typophile]].
    Maybe your blog won't be so much about type, so it's not as appropriate, but sometimes
    fun should win out over propriety."
