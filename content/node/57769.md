    this case, since it\u2019s a logo, I guess it\u2019s custom."

  body: "For techno fonts like this my advice is to search at Dafont, in the Techno>Sci-Fi
    category. It seems like 80-90% of the vague techno font questions turn up there
    (the exceptions are the better known commercial techno fonts), but when your post
    doesn't immediately ring any bells, it often means it's one of the countless 'hobby'
    (free) fonts that are so easy to make, as Jan said.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
