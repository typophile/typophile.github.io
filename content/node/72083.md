  varying in their level of distress. Know any like this?

  body: Brilliant. Thanks. I did look at FF Trixie, but it looked too distressed for
    my needs. But I'll give it another look.

    Typewriter</a></strong> does not have multiple letter alternatives,that vary in
    their level of distress, but it is less distressed than Trixie.\r\n\r\nWith regard
    to Trixie I would ask Fontshop for a sample PDF. I think, it looks more distressed
    on screen than in print and especially the light weights could profit from an
    inkjet printer."

    No distress, but really nice.
