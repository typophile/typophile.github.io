body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm doing an advertorial for a magazine and I'm trying to pin the
  fonts, so I can layout the spread like the original magazine. \r\n\r\n- One font
  definetly looks like Apex New\r\n- One \u2013 the large heading \u2013 looks like
  Helvetica black/heavy condensed \u2013 but has a different 'E' \r\n\u2013 The serif
  I'm not sure about at all, other than it looks very familiar. The lowercase 't'
  puts me off trail (it's kinda like Bodoni, but not really)\r\n\r\nWhat are we looking
  at?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/scanorama_sans_6382.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/scanorama_serif_3799.jpg]"

    I'm not sure why I'm helping because I think this sort of \"advertorial\" concept
    is an assault on readers."

    they should just have the magazine's art director do it. Plus, as Stephen said,

    was correct in his original post, the text sans is Apex New, and not Apex Sans.
    The numerals being used are the default hybrid/Scotch style, which are working
    well in running text.\r\n\r\nI wish that I could help with the text serif ID,
    beyond saying that it's not Miller or Mercury. In the sample inline above, there
    is a little bit of italic, which is very helpful. I'm not as good at IDing as
    I used to be, but I would say that one should look to older faces, perhaps something
    in the 5-15 year-old range."
