    It could also be a unique/proprietary font built-in to embroidery software or
    hardware.  Whether a computer font or embroidery, the actual digitization and
    stitching allows for, and sometimes even causes, variations.  For example, the
    'C' in your image has two distinctly different terminations.\r\n\r\n - Herb"
