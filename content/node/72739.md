body: "Hello!\r\n\r\nI'm on this project right now in which I'm trying to design a
  business card to a friend who is a psychologist. She's not the most dogmatic or
  orthodox person, but she's somehow traditional.\r\n\r\nI showed her some layout
  with Mrs.Eaves font and she liked it.\r\n\r\nMy questions:\r\nIf I do use Mrs.Eaves,
  on the parts which goes telephone number and e-mail, what is \"the right\" or \"correct\"
  thing to do, to use old style numerals or lining ones?\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think
  of Mrs.Eaves being used in such thing as a business card?\r\n\r\nI appreciate your
  feedback!\r\n\r\nThank you so much!"

  body: "Mrs Eaves is a great utility typeface, and prints well at small sizes, so
    business card use is fine.\r\n\r\nThere is no \"correct\" way to do phone numbers;
    however, if you have several of them stacked (e.g., office, cell, fax, etc., one
    above the other, all flush right or left), lining numbers are preferable from
    a visual balance standpoint. On the other hand, if you're stacking a single phone
    number and an email address, there's no real reason not to use the far more interesting
    oldstyle numbers."

  body: "Hmmm, the thing is, I'm having them stacked in the layout! Phone number,
    office address numbers, zip code and e-mail (which doesn't use any numbers, but
    uses the @!)\r\n\r\nMaybe I'll do better using lining numbers, right?\r\n\r\nYou're
    right, oldsytle numbers are charming, but if they do not stand alone in the overall
    layout/design, I think they kind of feel \"out of place\" in the overall visual
    balance of it.\r\n\r\nThank you for your tip, oldnick!"

  body: "I'm not familiar with that font, but there are oldstyle figures that are
    tabular (that is, fixed width) that can be set up so numbers that are stacked
    will line up.\r\n\r\nAnd some fonts have lining figures that are proportional
    - that is different figures are different widths, even though all are the same
    height.\r\n"
