  body: "Most of the serif fonts I can think of with oblong-shaped counters are condensed
    typefaces, like all of the following from Red Rooster: Bodoni Black Condensed,
    Bodoni Campanile, Elongated Roman,  Keyboard, and Pall Mall. (The reason for picking
    these is that I happen to have their catalog handy and I know they had a lot of
    these styles in their collection.)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
