Art Nouveau
Here is a poster by Emmanuel Orazi for La Maison Moderne in 1905. This later art nouveau piece moves the texture away from the flowery embellished borders and backgrounds, instead creating texture with the typography.</p>
<p>This is an interesting composition because although there is great detail in the imagery, the detailed images are set in the background. The foreground image of the woman is relatively flat which creates this spatial quality of a two dimensional woman in a three dimensional world.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/04-11_el_lissitzky_cover_4120.jpg" alt="">
Constructivism
Here is a classic example of constructivism. This cover was designed by El Lissitzky for Wendingen in 1941. I enjoy breaking down this cover and I feel there is a certain conformity to this seemingly fractured design. I categorize the shapes by those which are rotated, and those which are not rotated. In each of these categories, the shapes stay at 90 degrees of each other. So it appears as if there were two designs based on two grids, then Lissitzky simply rotated one of the grids by about 30 degrees. But ask yourself this: Are the circles (including the partial circle at the bottom) on the rotated grid or the natural grid? Why?</p>

Dutch Design
It doesn&rsquo;t feel right to exclude Dutch design in a post about 20th century design. So alas, here we have a poster by Gert Dumbar for a Piet Zwart exhibition, date unknown. This poster contains all the fun stuff we&rsquo;ve come to love from dutch design: incorporated photographs, 45 degree angles, and much activated space. This poster leaves me wondering how much was an actual photograph and how much was composed into this final composition. Notice the illusionary dimension added by painting a wall that appears to extend the room, but no attempt is made to cover the seam where the real wall meets the floor. This illusion is common in Baroque art, where artists would extend the ceiling in a room to show the saints and the heavens.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>De Stijl, Bauhaus, and Russian Constructivism bear a common thread. You might even call their collective selves one &ldquo;movement&rdquo; with only nationalist separation. There was enough difference inside each of these among various members to encompass the the other countries as well. From Moholy-Nagy to, Van Doesburg to Schwitters to Piet Zwart to Rodchenko, Malevich, El Lissitzky, there was more a singleness than a differentiation.</p>

<p>i think he created it so that they could work on both grids, yes? there is no
way to play a circle on an angle due to its spherical properties&hellip;cool&hellip;</p>
