  but earning a business degree and earning to live in NYC takes out a lot of time.
  \ I've recently picked up some Adobe products and began learning about Web development/design;
  now I'm trying to branch out of the technicality of building websites and reinstate
  my creative mind.  I'm looking to learn the ins/outs of typography and coloring
  to play around with for some basic websites.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately my work computer
  doesn't allow me to view the Typography 101 in resources, but that just means I'll
  have something to look forward when I get home.\r\n\r\n\r\nHello Typophile."
