  by a collaboration between a group of people. \r\n\r\nThe most prominent project
  that comes to my mind is [[http://www.typesociety.org/fontaid|Font Aid]], but are
  there any projects like this where a functional typeface was created?\r\n\r\nWhether
  it's an open source project or perhaps even just a collaboration between a small
  group of typographers, both old and new, I'm really interested to find out about
  them - if they exist.\r\n\r\nThanks amigos.\r\n\r\nJordan"
