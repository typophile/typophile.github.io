  body: It&#39;s Schneidler Initials, but I can&#39;t find anything other than <a
    href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/castletype/shango/regular/testdrive.html?s=BISHOP%2BMcGUINESS&amp;p=72">Shango</a>,
    which Jason Castle explicitly says is a Schneidler digitization.

    <BR>The &#60;font class=&#34;dontLookLikeCrap&#34;&#62; code is Typophile  <BR>reminding
    us it has been built on extremely whacky code. <BR>It appears when you edit a
    post, and the only way to get  <BR>rid of it is to manually erase the code while
    you&#39;re editing. <BR>And don&#39;t forget the &#60;/font&#62; at the end of
    your post. <IMG SRC=\"http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif\" ALT=\":-&#41;\"
