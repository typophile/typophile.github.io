  body: thx - that is a beautiful face...was thinking of staying serif, but should
    consider sans as well perhaps

  body: Serif and Sans together can lead to a very pleasing combination. <BR> <BR>What
    would you be looking for if you wanted a second serif face?

  body: mainly just good support of Roemisch, but good hinting / legitibility at 8-9pt
    would be necessary

  body: Yeah, but support it how? I mean, &#42;any&#42; font could support it somehow,
    depending on the usages

  body: as a &#34;tag&#34; under the wordmark, and in supporting print collateral
    / ID system pieces at sometimes small sizes....i want to marry well with the mark,
    but be different enough to let the mark stand out

  body: Maybe a Scotch serif like <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&amp;displayfontid=FB.106470.0.0"
    target="_blank">Miller</a> or <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&amp;displayfontid=UR.109927.0.0"

  body: I have never used this font but it looks nice and elegant, seeing as it is
    a glyphic font i would stick with a glyphic partner font; Zapf Humanist is nice,
    keep it thin in weight though otherwise it becomes a heavy overbearing type font.
    Another you may like to try is Litalitha.

  body: any experience with Melior....good/bad qualities in print at small sizes ?...it
    looks great and matches Roemisch well i think, but i don&#39;t own it yet, so
    any shared experience with it would be great
