  everyone, this is my newest typeface that started as a Python script experiment
  and now transformed into a regular font family.\r\n\r\nION superfamily consists
  of 3 families  \u2014 condensed (ION A), normal (ION B) and wide (ION C). The glyphs
  are based on the classic 7-segment display. Every ION family has a compelling range
  of 10 weights, supports more than 70 Latin-based languages and various OpenType
  features, including discretionary ligatures, fractions and stylistic sets. The family
  is completed with a special box-drawing font called Cells. See and read more at
  [[http://www.urtd.net/ion|Urtd]] or go check it at [[http://new.myfonts.com/foundry/Urtd/|MyFonts]].\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your comments!"

    that scripting/interpolating the design would work out so well. Good work."
