body: Hello Typophiles. I&#39;m working on a typographic piece &#40;for the upcoming
  Veer catalog&#41; that references the &#34;middle dots&#34; used in Roman inscriptions
  and such &#40;like on Trajan&#39;s column&#41;. Can anyone share more information
  on the history of &#34;delimited text&#34;, how it changed from dots to spaces,
  etc.?  or point me in the right direction? Much appreciated.

    marked at all until Irish scribes invented the practice in the 8th &#40;?&#41;
    century. <BR> <BR>This is actually a rare case where one can recommend a single
    book that will cover the topic exceptionally well! &#34;Space between words&#34;

    I&#39;ll certainly be seeking a copy of that book now. <BR> <BR>The development
    of scriptura continua to words as individual objects is fascinating. I&#39;ve
    never seen those &#39;mid dots&#39; used in anything other than examples of Roman
    inscriptions. I refer to them as mid dots as I&#39;m unsure whether they have
    an established name. We have an overdot, so it seems a reasonable guess. <BR>
    <BR>-- <BR> <BR>Interesting reading on the asterisk too HHP. I was with you in
    thinking that it concerned the playwright.&#60;/font&#62;'

  body: The mid-dots are actually a typographic character in the basic latin font,
    named &#34;periodcentered&#34;. <BR> <BR>I use it occasionally to separate two
    all-cap titling words/phrases, on the same line. As an alternative to the vertical
    bar. Or sometimes in a folio, eg MARCH

  body: I use middots for phone numbers. In a font with tabular figures it&#39;s good
    to make its set-width half the numerals. Another thing to measure against is the
    width of the bullet. Plus don&#39;t forget that it&#39;s used between two &#34;el&#34;s
    in Catalan. <BR> <BR>BTW, for a text face, the middot should ideally be lighter/smaller
    than the period. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: 'As I noted on another thread, with visual, the dead sea scrolls &#40;the
    latest year 135&#41; have word spacing in the Hebrew. And as no change is noted
    in the literature that I know of, the practice is likely far more ancient.  <BR>
    <BR>I read somewhere recently that in Latin, being a highly  inflected language,
    it is easy to spot word endings, by comparison to some other languages - which
    would explain the lack of spaces to some extent.  <BR> <BR>All this makes me question
    how much of the story Saenger really has. I am not a scholar in this area, and
    I may be wrong, but my scholarly alarm bells went off when I saw this claim. '

  body: 'To be fair, &#34;invented&#34; seems indeed too strong a term for what the
    Irish scribes did. But the real point of Saenger&#39;s work is basically to show
    that &#34;immersive reading&#34; of Latin simply didn&#39;t exist before the Irish
    contribution &#40;at least not for a few hundred years, when literacy was a huge
    luxury anway&#41;, and in this I see no problems with his stance. <BR> <BR>Hebrew
    might suffer more from lack of spacing, so this might have indeed accelerated
    the incorporation of spaces. But Hebrew still suffers from something worse to
    this day: waaaaay too much homogeny between characters, and too much alignment
    &#40;like Latin all-caps&#41;. A powerful, masculine script with great presence
    and a unique pedigree... but low readability. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    word spaces go hand in hand, as do immersive reading and the presence of word
    spaces. You can&#39;t read very well when you have to sound everything out &#40;even
    silently&#41;, and lack of spaces makes souding out a helpful &#40;in a retarded
    sort of way&#41; technique. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>
