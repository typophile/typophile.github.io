  body: "Well, it's just one shirt for now.  And why not start with a face born the
    year I was? We've got plenty of other faces and topics near and dear to typophiles'
    hearts in the works.  Also, a few pithy sayings about life in the industry are
    coming soon.\r\n\r\nMany thanks to the fine folks at Typophile, who brought a
    ton of new traffic last week.\r\n\r\nhttp://typographyshop.com\r\nhttp://kinggroupmedia.com"
