  of Communication. It seems that it could do the job.\r\n\r\nDoes any of you have
  other suggestions for courses in Europe?\r\n"

    I can recommend the mastercourse Type&Media from the academy in Den Haag (The
    Hague) in the Netherlands.\r\nhttp://www.kabk.nl\r\n\r\nPieter"

  body: "Thanks, Pieter. Funny thing is that back in 2000 I was actually accepted
    to the KABK. I went there to talk to teachers and students and see the work done
    there. It was when I was just getting started in type-design.\r\n I'll probably
    get slaughtered for this, but I thought it was too calligraphy-based. It seemed
    like a really good school though. I'm more on the lookout for graphic design,
    really."

  body: 'I am currently enrolled in LCC on the MA graphic design course which is one
    year. I think the strength of the course comes from the department itself. The
    tutors are very knowledgable and the course is well structured and quiet flexible
    in the sense that you do what interest you. The disadvantage though is that it''s
    a one year course which means you really don''t find the time to digest the information.
    very intense... and there is not really an emphasis on typography but you can
    always choose the direction of your projects. Check out the tutors: Paul Mc Neil
    (type designer), Russel Bestley (wrote few design books with Ian noble), Tony
    credland (designer/activist and founder of cactus network) and Wayne dayley (designer).
    i applied to many courses before choosing this one; check out reading university
    http://www.rdg.ac.uk/AcaDepts/lt/ if you are interested in typography it is the
    best, although it''s a 2 year course, another interesting course: http://www.designacademy.nl/
    bordering design if you are fed up...'

  body: "I did the Information Design MA at Reading in 2003\u201304, which was great.\r\nIt's
    very rigorous and challenging. I saw this year's work and it was also really good.
    I think Reading generally is a great place to study. \r\n\r\nI suppose it depends
    what you want from a graphic design education. There is definitely a Reading way
    of understanding and doing design \u2013 well reasoned, logical \u2013 which I
    have found very useful."
