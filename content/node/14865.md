  What is this titling face? Could it simply be a hacked version?\r\nhttp://www.metromystics.com/home.htm\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any help."

    You'll never know. \r\n\r\nAlternate(s) that I know:\r\n\"J\", \"M\", \"W\",  \"&\",
    \"2\", \"4\",\"0\" \r\nAlbertus Bold: \"&\"\r\n\r\nBut I don't know about \"e\"
    or \"E\""

    that alternate glyph in the character set.

    the font used in the 60s TV show the Prisoner. From the <a href=\"http://www.faqs.org/faqs/tv/the-prisoner/part1/\">Prisoner
    FAQ</a>:\r\n\r\n<cite>The font used in _The Prisoner_ is a modified version of\r\n
    \   \"Albertus\" (dots removed from \"i\" and \"j\", loop of \"e\" opened).</cite>\r\n...\r\n
    \  \r\n<cite> There are two freeware Albertus derivatives, both of which have\r\n
    \   been modified Prisoner-style.  One is by Glenn Fleishman and is\r\n    called
    \"Furioso\"; the other is by Mark Heiman and is called\r\n    \"Village\".  Both
    are available via anonymous FTP from\r\n    dworkin.wustl.edu:/dist/prisoner.</cite>"
