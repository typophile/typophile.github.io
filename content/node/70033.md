body: I am working on a manual, book size body type and I have a lot of bullet lists
  that I am currently using round bullets or dashes for, to indicate a new item. Are
  there any alternative typographic devices?

    bullets. You define this in the paragraph style and may choose the bullet from
    any glyph in any font. There are many glyphs which can be used as bullets in fonts
    like Warnock, Arno, Minion, Meta Serif and so on (bullets, arrows, hands, asterisks,
    flourishes etc.)\r\n"
