    when the server switch happened.\r\n\r\nFor whatever reason, the script is pulling
    4-day-old posts. (It also happens to be listing unpublished spam threads!)\r\n\r\nI
    believe the team is working on squashing the bug."

    don\u2019t usually go through the front page, so only just happened to stumble
    across this. But as I say, I think this appears to be just a recent glitch and
    likely associated with the server move.\r\n\r\nThere are always nuisancey things
    to iron out after a move, dontcha know.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "While we're on the subject of glitches, my track user page isn't telling
    me how many new comments there are (like \"2 new\" for example). I sound like
    a right misery.\r\n\r\nIt needs to be stated that I think the Typophile site is
    excellent; I massively appreciate its scope and the quality and generosity of
    those that frequent it. Thank you Punchcut/punters."
