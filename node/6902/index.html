  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello, <BR>I'm looking for advice on type for an artist's book. The book will be mostly photographs, printed in warm quadratone, one to a page (in some cases one to a spread). There will type on title pages, acknowledgements, and on a one or two page essay. The type is set simply, fairly large (13pt) and the essay is set with very large margins. Page size is 15 x 13 inches. <BR> <BR>The photographs are dense and lush, but of stark subject matter, and formally could be seen as late modern. The overall time feel of the images is &quot;some time in the 20th or 21st centuries.&quot;  <BR> <BR>I've expermimented with a couple of treatments, including sans serif (which just seemed to plain in the context of the work) and traditional serif faces like Garamond and Bembo, which seemed to &quot;retro&quot; and to overemphasize that aspect of the work. <BR> <BR>My current mockup uses Mrs. Eaves. I like the general look of it, but the letterspacing in the body copy is kind of wonky. Also, it seems kind of trendy right now &hellip; I'd prefer something with a similar feel but fresher. <BR> <BR>As a final note, I may end up having the text printed letterpress from plates made from digital files. Mrs. Eaves seems designed to give a &quot;letterpress look&quot; and I'm not sure if it's a good idea to print a face that mimics letterpress on an actual letterpress. However, I may end up printing conventionally, so ideally I'll use a type that would work with either approach. <BR> <BR>Any thoughts on what I might look at? <BR>Some samples of the photographs are at <a href="http://www.paulraphaelson.com" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.paulraphaelson.com">www.paulraphaelson.com</a></a> <BR> <BR>Thank you very much for any help.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for all the advice, everyone. <BR>I've been experimenting a lot, and nothing looks as good as Mrs. eaves for the title page and cover type. But it's not working for the body copy, partly because of the low x-height and partly because of the messed up letterspacing.  <BR> <BR>Of everything I've looked at for the text, the two faces that look best are baskerville (which I guess eaves is based on) and cochin. <BR> <BR>Do you think it's strange to use two different serif text faces like this? They won't be on the same page as each other &hellip; the mrs. eaves will only be at the front of the book, since there won't be display copy used with the text. <BR> <BR>One thing I find I like for this project is a capital W without a center serif (as in the baskerville and the eaves, but not the cochin). I know this sounds nitpicky, but it stands out for me since the title starts with W.</div>

But if you find a typeface that has many weights in a very tight range (or if you manage to tweak the weight of the font yourself, or maybe outsource that task) then you could just swap the two weights as needed. Just watch the linebreaks if the two weights are not uniwidth. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

It may be the foreigner's romantic view of early 20th Century New York but, to me, those desolate industrial spaces are calling for some of Benton's faces. <BR> <BR>I think a nicely spaced and carefully sized Franklin Gothic Heavy would work very well for titles and, specially, captions. And if you print photopolymer-letterpress it will help convey the strong human-scale dimension of that face. <BR> <BR>Raph Levien has on his site some <a href="http://levien.com/type/atf_1923/" target="_blank"> images</a> of the 1923 ATF specimen book, with nice samples of both Franklin and News Gothic. <BR><a href="http://www.linotype.com/12600/itcfranklingothicheavy-font.html?PHPSESSID=0b3163a10bba60888762e3d419511cb3" target="_blank">Link</a> to Linotype's ITC Franklin Gothic. <BR> <BR>I hope this helps, your work is really good and, regardless of your type choice, I'm sure it will be a beautiful book.</div>

I thought this might be the case and printed a sample; indesign definitely flowed the paragraph better, but the letterspacing within the words was about the same. Is there a preference or something within the program that can adjust this? <BR> <BR>I've also been looking at Veljovic. The color is a bit light, but otherwise I like the type very much.  <BR> <BR>I'm definitely sticking to serif fonts .. my experiments with sans serif just haven't worked out for this project. <BR>Still looking, but I'm considering all the suggestions here and I greatly appreciate all the input. <BR>&lt;/font&gt;</div>
