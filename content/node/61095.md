  body: "I don't recall which thread it was, but quite a bit of information about
    him and his famous work Hadasa was presented by a few people.\r\n\r\nWhen I lived
    in Israel in 1983 or 1984,I spoke with Heni F. when he was a very old man, after
    writing to him. \r\n\r\nI sent him a royalty check, which he returned. \r\n\r\nI
    think that he called me, and we spoke over an hour together. At one point, he
    began to cry like a baby, when I told him that the Jewish religious world had
    accepted him design and was using it extensively in their prayer books and Bible
    books.\r\n\r\nAs an experienced type design, Henri revealed to me secrets of excellant
    Hebrew type design, and he critiqued my interpretation of Hadasa. He pointed only
    one short coming, and praised my effort as being the most faithful to the original.\r\n\r\nI
    attribute this not to any unique skill. Rather, I am a Lubavitcher chassid, and
    have studied in depth Chassidic philosophy which emphasizes the importance of
    not involving one's ego in regard to another.\r\n\r\nYou may contact me at go.hebrew@gmail.com"

    know if it's \"important information\"... Are you looking for a certain type of
    thing? Like personal recollections, design analysis, or what?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
