  body: By the way Don you might check you computer font collection as Kolo was bundled
    with some Adobe apps like Illustrator at some point and you may have it (or on
    an install disk).

  body: "Thanks Bob. I did find it in my fonts. I must have seen it long ago and forgotten
    about it. But seeing it on the book cover impressed me as to its suitability as
    a running text sans with a good combination of legibility, even color and interesting
    but not overly distracting letterforms. I would probably limit its text use to
    no more than 50 or so words.\r\nDon"
