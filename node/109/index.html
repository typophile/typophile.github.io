As usual, the end of the year, the students have so much to finish, they don't seems serious as it need to finish it! Anyway, its where they are. And its seems interesting to see what the world (Typophile IS the world!) say about it? <BR> <BR>Its a revival of a late 19th century french typeface, from a foundry called Fonderie Bertrand, who probably be purchased by Peignot later. Some of the caps proportions are strange, like the B or M. <BR> <BR>My question is do we need to stick to this strange proportions, or need to correct them?  <BR> <BR>The serif structure came from a friendly confrontation between three groups of students (after a close observation of some results of cutting technics). It seems to work for lc, less in some caps, I think about C, G, S, E at vertical position? What do you think? <BR> <BR>Any others comments welcome, despite, we don't know what can be done to correct after your comments. Only next friday of work and the typeface need to be achieved. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/10688.gif" alt="Bertrand 3"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think you should keep the strange stuff (we have enough &quot;normal&quot; typefaces), but you might correct optical things: color issues (like in the UC &quot;V&quot;), the lc &quot;k&quot; join, etc. <BR> <BR>One thing I wonder about is the descender depths: maybe it's nice to have them different? But if they're made the same, the &quot;y&quot; is the best one to match. <BR> <BR>The serif structure on the other hand seems to clash too much with the overall style. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">So fast as usual! My answers go to various points made by all of you. Thanks a lot, the students will appreciate, that the job they done is appreciated elsewhere than in their classroom! <BR> <BR>Use this link for the pdf of the gif posted here. Don't look to close to the forms, they are done from various methods, softwares, various students! <BR> <BR><a href="http://perso.ensad.fr/~ensadtypo/imagesbertrand/Bertrandtest090503.pdf" target="_blank"><a href="http://perso.ensad.fr/~ensadtypo/imagesbertrand/Bertrandtest090503.pdf">http://perso.ensad.fr/~ensadtypo/imagesbertrand/Bertrandtest090503.pdf</a></a> <BR> <BR>Ok, lets kept the serifs. Not sure to understand what Hrant say in its last sentence? <BR> <BR>Yes, the proportions of the caps are odd, but they are like that in such late century typefaces, very large mono width caps, such we found on earliers Sans too. The S was not on our sample (I think), and indeed, we've done it too narrow! <BR> <BR>But, your comments convince me that the B, P, R are really to large for today eyes. We will make them more narrow a bit enough to kept this strange feature, without to be disturbing too much. <BR> <BR>Yes, Hrant, the k need to be corrected, i don't asked them to correct it yet!! Some others glyphs need to be corrected too. The ampersand is a pure invention from the student who have done the figures&hellip; <BR> <BR>Normally, the figures follow an intermediate weight between caps and lc (its what i say during teaching). But, its possible that some are to heavy. <BR> <BR>Yes I like quite a lot the numerals! the five in particularly. You right David, we make it little more wider. <BR> <BR>thanks again!  <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">The irregularity of the serifs and the angles aren't so disparate that they need to be made the same. The only thing that catches my eye from my printout is the odd character widths. And really, they aren't so odd. For the question mark, I don't think it is too soft, but what if the front (top) end was trimmed flat and the back (bottom) end was left soft? Maybe this would make it match the somewhat irregular serifs?? I also like the color when it is printed. Maybe a little light for book work at the smallest point-size, I can see that, but maybe only just.  <BR> <BR>I printed this out on a 600dpi laserprinter.</div>
