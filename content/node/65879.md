  body: "'speranza' looks a lot like [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/classic/amadeus/|Amadeus]]
    by Anthony Nash, but it may only be one version of this antique script. Someone
    else may have done a similar revival. I only say this because I'm not sure the
    font is identical to your sample, though it is quite close.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
