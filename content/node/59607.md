  We Go\" (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1176740/)? I was able to snap a crappy picture
  of one of the credits with my iPhone. I submitted the picture to \"WhatTheFont\"
  and received some so-so guesses. Sample attached.\r\nthanks,\r\n\r\n- Dan"

  body: Whatever. The font in your sample is DIN, probably <a href="http://fontshop.com/search/?q=FF+DIN&x=0&y=0">FF
    DIN</a>.
