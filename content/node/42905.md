body: I am trying to find/remember a logo with two interlocking hands in a kind of
  yin and yang way (i.e it has rotational symmetry (within a circle, I think). Think
  it might be a UK logo but I'm not absolutely sure. Anyone know it?

    symmetrical fashion.

  body: The one I'm thinking of is based on a circle or ellipse and the hands are
    not shaking as such but flowing into each other. The whole thing has rotation
    symmetry.
