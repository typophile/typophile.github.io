body: Having trouble identifying the typeface used on these old signs, and the dates
  that they were in use. I could dig up a few conflicting dates, between early 1900's
  and into the 40's, but haven't found anything definite. Also, they were apparently
  printed white on Navy, and used in several neighborhoods in New York. I checked
  a couple type specimen books from the 1905-1915 era and got nothing. Any help identifying
  this typeface would be greatly appreciated!

    were (compare the <strong>S</strong>'s).
