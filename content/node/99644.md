  example is a rather silly image found on Pinterest, but I'm looking for an elegant,
  extra bold, Bodoni-like serif like the one used. Any idea what this seemingly more
  modern take might be?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    it more, which version specifically were you thinking of defiantone? I was thinking
    it may have been Sahara Bodoni Regular but the |y| doesn\u2019t match."
