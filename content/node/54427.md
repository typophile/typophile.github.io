    of: http://www.typographer.org/2005_06_01_digests.html\r\n\r\nBut why high x-height?\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nBTW
    there are strong clues (like the head serifs, and the\r\nnumerals) that Stanyan
    is based on ITC Garamond Condensed.\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/garamond/condensed/\r\nBut
    that's no text font.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
