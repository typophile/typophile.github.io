  body: "Your graphics are great, but I found the site frustrating to use: it took
    over a minute for the front page to load, and the loading circle appeared twice,
    giving me a false sense of when it would be ready.  The play controls or whatever
    they are are odd - what does the plus mean?  There were no tooltips to let me
    know.\r\n\r\nIt's still a lot more usable than most design flash sites, and looks
    a lot nicer.  :)"

  body: I believe the flash part used for displaying pictures and stuff is SlideShowPro
    http://slideshowpro.net/) meaning it's not really something he can change I don't
    think. As for the site and work I think it's nice, simple and effective.

    your internet connection or browser.) His site loaded in less than 3 seconds on
    my computer, and while the \"full screen\" doesn't work in the best way, the site
    did work just fine in FireFox. \r\n\r\nOh, and in my experience, the plus sign
    always means \"click the plus sign for more\".\r\n\r\nJoe - I wouldn't tell people
    your age in your bio. Too much information, and it's more likely to work against
    you than for you.\r\n\r\nAK"

  body: "Hey Guys, \r\n\r\nI hear you Alaskan on the age thing. Ageism is alive and
    well in America, I guess 25 year old's are scarier to work with then 35 year olds
    in our industry. ( that's a joke btw, it's about experience and knowledge of our
    industry imo.) \r\nRegardless I think I heard this statement enough that I should
    remove it. \r\n\r\nBut I will be updating my site a bit further with a Blog about
    stuff I see here and there to contextualize my personality to the work I do. And
    I will be fixing what I can on that slideshowpro flash swf. I think their are
    some gizmos I can turn on and off including the + and the full screen options.
    I think if I remove the full screen and either remove the + option or include
    a bit of a project description when you click on the + that would be a nice feature.
    \r\n\r\nIt's still a work in progress and I wish you all thanks and for taking
    a second for the comments, critiques, and praise. I'll link you all to a personal
    wall paper illustration I created feel free to download it! \r\nhttp://www.sisudesigns.com/submission/beginning.jpg\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJoseph

    other student these days does a condom project in college ;o)\r\n\r\nNice site.
    The Flash isn't over-the-top. That said, I'm not sure you really need flash. The
    one thing that I miss mostly on all-flash sites is the ability to bookmark specific
    pieces of work to show others."

    It's not flash that takes page bookmarking away, it's the site owners who don't
    write their own code. \r\n\r\nSorry if I sound snippy, but I have clients all
    the time that say \"no flash\" because they believe the two top myths; it can't
    be bookmarked, and it can't be spidered by search engines. Neither has been true
    since about 2003."

    usually added to the site as they take work above and beyond the basic presentation.
    As long as they are put into the requirements document, then yea, they don't specifically
    have to be issues."

    about it as you might think. I have a flickr account as well as a behance.net
    account. I get a tremendous amount of traffic from my subpages like that. To anyone
    else in this industry FLICKR holds the key to getting you into blogs and such.

    for Flickr...be careful...I know they've been (or were, at least) cracking down
    on NON-photographic work being posted in there. (Kind of a dumb policy, IMHO,
    but just FYI...)"

  body: 'Regarding Flickr: I was hesitant too at first but I carefully read their
    legal, and it is considered safe under the design agreement that I read and the
    policy checker that reviewed my site. I also Purposely do not allow people to
    download anything. Last I checked if they remove design work from there, then
    I''ll get my 40 bucks back lol. But it is a great place to get tags.. and bring
    traffic into your site if you do it right.'

    perspective.  Graceful degradation, progressive enhancement - that good stuff.
    \ But that turns out not to be the issue anyway (FF, latest flash, fast connection)!
    \ It's just a very bizarrely slow slideshow.   I expected a movie... or something,
    and the first time I visited, I didn't stay on the homepage long enough for the
    second img, just long enough to see:\r\n\r\n-Loading circle\r\n-Static image\r\n-Loading
    circ-\r\n   *click on a link I am bored*\r\n\r\nAnyways, it's obviously not a
    problem for anyone else. "
