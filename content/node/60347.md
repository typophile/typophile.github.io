  newsprint as a flyer for an Edinburgh Festival comedy show - and have been using
  the font News 701 at point sizes ranging from 7.5-8 (not usually good design practice
  I realise, but mimicking letterpress of yesteryear allows for some irregularity)\r\n\r\nMy
  concern is whether this point size will be too small to read printed at 150dpi on
  newsprint? The font is great (bix x-height, perfect for the occasion) but it is
  set very tight. \r\n\r\nWhat is the recommended smallest point size for legibility
  n newsprint, i suppose is my question.\r\n\r\n"
