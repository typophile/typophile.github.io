  smaller?) in this Muccatype ad that reads, \"Fine letterforms & moustache twirling\":\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/moustache_6406.jpg]\r\n\r\nAlso
  looking to ID the Victorian era display font used on the two tiny images of \"Staehle\"
  and \"Rio\".\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/staehle_4797.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/rio_6076.jpg]\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks!"

  body: "I searched using \"1800s\" at MyFonts and came up with one fair candidate
    that looks like a flattened version of your typeface: [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/flatrock/|Flatrock]]
    from Font Mesa. It came closest to having the strange geometry of your sample
    lettering. Dan Solo (Solotype) also had a number of fonts recreating typestyles
    from this era that had a similar feeling, but not the angular \"O\": Riviera,
    Houdini, Penny Arcade and Dawson (all at MyFonts).\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
