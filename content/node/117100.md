  I'd love to lay my eyes on a typeface that's quite close to Times New Roman in its
  skeletal structure, but with the following differences: (1) optically monolinear;
  failing that, then having a very low stroke contrast, (2) serifs more slab-like
  than standard TNR.\r\n\r\nMetric equivalence to TNR not relevant.\r\n\r\nIs there
  such a face? What, to your eye, comes close? And are there any like this that are
  any <em>good</em>?"

    to my inquiry. But they don't have a TNR eText. (http://www.myfonts.com/search/name%3Aetext/fonts/)\r\n\r\nYeah,
    I'm not so much looking for a list of everyone's favorite slab faces. I'd like
    to see something quite a bit Times-like that's a little... ooophier. \"...all
    while ensuring that the typefaces appear as unmistakable cousins of their original...\"\r\n\r\nOh,
    and, hey, if there's something with a TNR-like skeleton that's a monolinear or
    low-contrast <em>sans</em>, I'd love to see that too.\r\n\r\nEDIT: http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/rotation/

    I've looked at Life from both sides now, from win and lose, and still somehow
    it's life's illusions I recall.\r\n\r\nGFS Elpis looks amazing and, for my purposes,
    will just need a bit of a closer look.\r\n\r\nTimes Europa Office was easy to
    check out on myfonts.com and see that it might work very well indeed as a \"screen
    Times.\"\r\n\r\nhrant, I love that you take long shots.\r\n\r\nI'm glad you showed
    me Beaufort, Nick. One thought was the tiny little almost-serifs such as you made.
    This too will need a closer look.\r\n\r\nBoth Concorde and Plantin are also great
    directions for me to look. I'll include them in my close-looks.\r\n\r\nNone of
    these are quite the \"monolinear slab Times-variant\" I imagined, but most are
    just what I was hoping to see. So, fantastic suggestions as always, folks. Thanks
    again.\r\n\r\nI really don't know Life at all."
