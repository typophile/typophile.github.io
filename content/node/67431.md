body: I just can't ID this font. I'm so close but not quite there. It's like a Straight
  ITC Eras.It's also close to AvantGarde but not entirely. Ugh. Can anyone help?

  body: That's Eras all right. Back-slanted so it's upright and stretched horizontally.
    (It's also possible it's the old upright version that Adobe shipped with the normal
    slanted version, intended for low-res devices.)

  body: That it's an old upright version is far more likely. ITC Eras has very modest
    bends the type. This version is very clean and "Upright". Is it possible track
    down old typefaces like this one?
