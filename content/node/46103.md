body: "I recently started designing a typeface that I am really excited about. This
  is where it started:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/simplify_5694.gif]\r\n\r\nWhile
  it looks like a script, its really more of a sans serif. I don\u2019t want cursive
  or italic forms (like s, one storey a, f and so on), rather I want a relaxed sans
  typeface that is interconnected. I know this will take some serious work, but I
  am up for it.\r\n\r\nPlease give feedback and let me know your thoughts.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nEvan

  body: "As far as readability goes, I think the i might be problematic. Next to the
    s, it kind of looks like a t, and next to the l, it looks like a lowercase b.\r\n\r\nOf
    course, I'm assuming that the word in the graphic is \"simplify\" and not \"stmpbfy\""
