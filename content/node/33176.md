body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/blog_quantico_3417.gif]\r\n\r\nI'd like
  to announce the release of my latest type family, Quantico. Quantico is an angular
  typeface family that was inspired by old beer packaging and military lettering.
  It utilizes 30 degree angles and completely straight lines to form unique character
  shapes. Equally at home in text or display settings, Quantico includes 3 alternate
  characters as well as several ligatures.\r\n\r\nBuy and preview it now at <a href=\"http://www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T0103\">Youworkforthem</a>
  and <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/madtype/quantico\">Myfonts</a>\r\n\r\nAnd
  don't forget to stay tuned to my latest efforts via www.madtype.net and my recently
  implemented blog."

    and my naming scheme. I''m working on having at least one font for each letter
    of the alphabet. So far I''m missing: N, O, T, U, X, Y, and Z. ;-)'

  body: "I agree with Eben -- the lc really makes this font (and I loved Quantico,
    when I lived in Virginia) fill a gap that's missing with other styles like this.\r\n\r\nIs
    this the full character set or are there some missing from the pix you posted?"

  body: "I've updated the first post with a PDF for you guys to peruse. It will be
    the same PDF that Myfonts uses for their \"gallery\" image.\r\n\r\nThe fonts have
    a full character set (pretty much everything here sans some of the mathematical
    characters: http://www.alanwood.net/demos/macroman.html). The Myfonts character
    set viewer does not currently support referenced characters in OT fonts, so you
    won't be able to see the accented characters there yet on their site. But they
    are there. Myfonts has informed me that it will be a couple of months before that
    is fixed.\r\n\r\nP.S. I think the lowercase g makes the font also. Be sure to
    check it out in the PDF."

  body: "I dunno Nick, I don't see beer as a violent thing, more of a pacifier. And
    overall, the font to me doesn't really project violence. It's more about the underlying
    simplicity and elegance of something that may be regarded as violent or rudimentary
    at a glance. :-)\r\n\r\nI would call this genre Blocky Sans or Geometric."
