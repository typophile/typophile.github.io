  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Pls look at this deign.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/woodspecialties_4904.PNG]
 My client has asked me "The art attached needs to be set up for screen print.  Please use a simulated process (CMYK) and create the appropriate color separations" 

He has asked for Illustrator files. I am totally unknown with "simulated process". Pls can anyone help me what & how to do it. I can not say my customer that i can not do this:(  Pls help to sort out this.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Screen printers used to reproduce full-color images with a kind of paint-by-number approach using spot colors. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/batman2_4608.gif]
<em>Example swiped from [[http://thelittlefriendsofprintmaking.com/oops/|this site]].</em>

Modern screen printers can print fairly high-resolution halftones in 4-color process, but you should talk to your (or your client's) screen printer and find out what his/her requirements are (and what substrate they're printing on--your artwork looks like it might go on a vehicle). Also, ask your client if they want "simulated" process color for an intentional retro look.

		<div class="commentbody">"Simulated process" means setting it up with four colors, but the colors aren't CMYK, and typically there's an underlay color because the substrate (usually a dark T-shirt) isn't white. In your case, you could have black, two shades of brown, and white. Check out [[http://www.impressionsmag.com/impressions/content_display/screen-printing/e3ia99a083a1bd87a2b808db05af2df38fe|this article]] about it, and/or google "simulated process separations."

Also, it's probably worth mentioning that antialiasing is a bad idea in printing in general, so you'll want a version (if you don't already have one) at a higher resolution without antialiasing. You'll need to know the final size they're printing this at.

There probably are plug-ins to streamline this process, but essentially you want to end up with a Photoshop file with a channel for each color. When you make a new channel, you can pick the color and screen angle, and then you can move the appropriate parts of the image into the new channel.

Good luck!

If they want Illustrator files, it sounds like vector graphics, and then Photoshop wouldn't work. I second the idea of talking straight to the printers to find out what they want and how many colours are there at your disposal.</div>
