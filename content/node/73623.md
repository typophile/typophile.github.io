body: "I've been working on a font and I just came up with a great name for it. I've
  searched the internet and there's nothing alike. I really want to use this name.\r\nI
  saw in earlier threads that you can't copyright the name. So, what steps should
  I take? Just hope someone else doen't take it first? Pre-register it at MyFonts?"

  body: Copyright does not apply to names, but Trademark does. In the US one would
    register the Trademark with the Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). The European
    Union offers a similar process I would think.

  body: "Jean Paul: \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t work for MyFonts but in my opinion this is
    something they cannot deal with: even if you can pre-register your font (which
    I don\u2019t think is even possible), this is not going to protect you against
    someone else using \u201Cyour\u201D name. MyFonts is a commercial website, not
    a government office.\r\n\r\nIf you want to protect the name, you must go to the
    EU Trademark Office. According to http://oami.europa.eu/ows/rw/pages/CTM/feesPayment/feesPayment.en.do,
    the fee to be paid is 900 euros if you file online. It is valid for ten years,
    and then you must renew it (1350 euros). It must be a very good name indeed."

    find 900 euros to be a lot of money for just a name (but then again, it's only
    90 euros a year)... I don't know if it's that good ;-) I think I'll keep my fingers
    crossed and hope no-one else thinks of it too. Glad I didn't mention it here!

    other distributor, the name won\u2019t be protected unless you trademark it, so
    someone else might copy it (or change it a bit, if that makes any difference)
    and upload a new design with \u201Cyour\u201D name."

  body: "Well, this form of registration is not one that offers a lot of protection
    - it just establishes the fact and the moment that one has registered an idea
    (sketch, image, words, whatever). Which, of course, can come into play when there
    is a dispute and litigation\u2026\r\n\r\nI like the fact that it is a lot cheaper
    than other forms of 'protection' and is a more viable alternative to sending yourself
    a registered letter and keeping that safe somewhere\u2026 : )"

    directly. They kindly replied:\r\n\r\n\"It is quite rare to register trademarks
    for font names. As I understand it, the main benefit of registering a font name
    is that you get triple damages in the event of a violation. For small foundries
    and independent designers the cost of registering a trademark is unlikely to be
    cost effective.\r\nAll that is generally necessary is to ask us to mark your font
    name with a TM to signal the fact that you consider it to be your trademark. This
    is sufficient to establish priority in the use of the name for commercial sale
    of the font.\"\r\n\r\nSo, no cost and no guarantees. Not that I'm cheapskate (although
    Dutch) but there are not a lot a guarantees in life anyway. And *if* someone does
    copy the name, I'll consider that flattering."

  body: In Europe you are better of. As long as you pursue infringements on either
    an established name, or infringements on your design you are pretty golden. As
    I understand it, typeface designs are not protected in the US because it was ruled
    that they constitute 'derivative works', and as I understand it, derivative works
    cannot be copyrighted. This is partly why typefaces have protected Trademarks
    (proper), because it is the only properties of a typeface the foundries <em>can</em>
    protect. Correct me if I'm wrong please.
