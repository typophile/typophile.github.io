  Monotype  metal typeface specimens; it is a letterpress printing service by Michael
  & Winifred Bixler in Skaneateles, NY, using classic English Monotype book faces.
  I guess lot of people here could be interested in seeing them.\r\n\r\nThe specimens:\r\nhttp://www.mwbixler.com/specimens.html\r\n\r\nAnd
  the homepage:\r\nhttp://www.mwbixler.com/"
