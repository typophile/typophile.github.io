body: "hi guys!\r\n\r\nI'm currently designing a logo for a small company which produces
  both software as well as hardware (terminals) for a yellow pages kind of service
  called \"city exhibition\" (translated) which they sell to small cities and townships.\r\n\r\nThe
  solution I came up with focuses on the information and location aspect of the product
  (i for information and the arrow kind of thing for the location) However it still
  incorporates the aspects of towns or cities, although be it subtle. The arrow is
  shaped to reminiscence of coat of arms and the dot on the i is shaped like a house
  to represent the idea of small businesses (main customers) adding their data to
  the service.\r\n\r\nI would love to hear some feedback on this thing (especially
  on typo and size relations to the symbol)\r\n\r\n[[http://www.michaelnagy.at/files/SA_Entwurf_5.png|image1]]

    It\u2019s too wide.\r\n\u2022 While it plays well with the rest, the house says
    \u201Creal estate\u201D more than \u201Ccity\u201D."

  body: "Hope girls can reply too. :->\r\n\r\nI didn't get a <em>house</em> from the
    tittle (i-dot), but an <em>arrow</em> pointing upwards, which conflicts with the
    overall arrow pointing downwards. That would be my main critique point \u2013
    conflicting movements/directions. \r\nOh and, the 2 fonts don't work together
    ideally \u2013 they're almost the same, but not quite (or are they supposed to
    be the same? What's up with the \"S\"s then?). \r\nAlso they might be just a hint
    too techno-ish*, but maybe that's what you want.\r\nOther than that I agree it's
    coming along quite nicely.\r\n\r\n* Just a word of caution that this \"cold\"/angular
    look seems to be on its way out; and I'd guess you don't want this to look dated
    in a year or two. But maybe others would disagree."

  body: I dunno, this has potential as a sort of marker for finding things, rather
    than a shield - although I never mind that connotation. I would make the shadow
    a tad 'flatter', about 3/4 the current width and like 12.5% darker.I would nudge
    the 'i' ever-so-slightly downward to better cement it inside the shape. The dot
    on the i is nice to look at but I agree there is some sort of conflict going on.
    Maybe it is that it doesn't echo the outer shape exactly in proportion ( or, conversely,
    that it is not different enough ). Have you tried just a straight circle or square?
    Maybe it's trying too hard..
