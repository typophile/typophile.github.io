  body: It looks good, but the spacing is too tight and also too jumpy. Do you have
    a full character set, or is that still in preparation? Also, I think the horizontal
    stroke in the g is too thick.

  body: "I like this, The letter forms have so much character. That lowercase b is
    exquisite. I agree with Nathanael, the letter spacing does seem a bit tight and
    the flow of lowercase letters is jumpy, the uppercase forms seem pretty solid
    though. \r\n\r\nNot to nit-pick, but you misspelled Copyright. "

    of spacing.  The some and main letter symbols were designed, to that height I
    am developing others glyphs.  Comply with its comments about `g`.  \r\n\r\nMarconi

    reminds me of Eureka (<a href="http://www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&searchby=manufacturer&displayfontid=FF.11046.0.0">FF

  body: Actually, the sheered serifs are more reminiscent of [[Nikola Djurek]]'s new
    <a href="http://typonine.com/typo9/index.php?n=Typonine.Amalia">Amalia</a>. I
    like them both.

  body: Looking nice. I like the 'b', 'r' and 's' very much. Although I'm not too
    big a fan of such a small counter in the 'e', also the horizontal stroke of that
    glyph looks a bit thin?

  body: Just to add to the jumble of similar typefaces, I first saw some <a href=http://www.christianschwartz.com/farnham.shtml>Farnham</a>
    in the letterforms, especially those huge serifs in the u and d. But then again,
    maybe I've just been looking at Farnham for too long.

    Chance?  \r\nDo not I know, therefore I have the sketches of the Adriane to at
    least two years.  \r\n\r\nJelmar,\r\nThanks by the comments. I am going to evaluate
    its observation about the 'e'.  \r\n\r\nReed, \r\nReally not with himself see
    resemblances between the Adriane and to Farnhan.  \r\n\r\nEdward, \r\nI am going
    to analyze with its calm observation.  \r\n\r\nP.s.   am preparing a new sample
    brought up to date, and soon I will place. \r\n\r\nMarconi"

  body: "Hi Marconi,\r\n\r\n\r\nThis looks very very nice. \r\nI think it would look
    better if you make the serifs on the baseline of the f and r a lil bit wider at
    the right side. Although I think that the E is a bit too narrow. And make the
    G a bit wider at the top.\r\n\r\nAnd I have to agree Quincunx Im although not
    such a big fan of the small counter in the e and the crossbar is a bit too small.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteven"
