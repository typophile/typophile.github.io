  body: "Firstly are you going to admit that you actually own a Keane CD!!\r\n\r\nOK,
    there was a lot in the UK design press a about a year ago regarding this cover
    design, so google Creative Review, Grafik magazine maybe? Design was by Big Active.
    Illustrator Sanna Annukka. \r\n\r\nIf memory serves the whole marketing roll out
    was a tightly managed 'branding' job. I'm fairly sure that the type was drawn
    especially, its not impossible that it is an adaption of an existing font.\r\n\r\nNot
    much help I know."

      Big Active's website and grabbed a screenshot for my \"Inspiration\" file. Really
      nice work overall, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nYeah, probably is a custom adaptation
      of an exisitng typeface.\r\n\r\nThanks for the suggestions!"
