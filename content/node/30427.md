  body: ENGINEERING is Eurostile Bold Extended. As for the Rays bit - I do not know
    if it is custom or not but you could redraw it with much ease if needs be!

  body: The text around the rim does have stroke widths and proportions very similar
    to Eurostile Bold Extended; but characters are more similar to Trademarker Light
    (the heavier faces of Trademarker aren't monoline). Similar to Typodermic's Korataki
    or various T-26.But no exact match yet.
