    is a faithful rendering of Jan Tschichold's 1929 experimental alphabet which was
    influenced by Bayer's single-alphabet. His design was never put into production.
    This re-creates his original geometrically constructed design, including some
    phonetic characters.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\nI
