  have seen before and know the answer to.\r\n\r\nI've been sent some fonts on a CD
  and some of the fonts have lost their word spaces! Apparently they were designed
  on a Windows machine, but the sent files were intended for the Mac. There are the
  post script outline files and the bitmaps, as there should be. The files themselves
  were not sent compressed on the CD. My Mac is running 10.4.11. Some fonts seem fine;
  others have lost their word spaces and so appear as an unbroken string of letters.\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone have any idea what has happened here?\r\n\r\nbest\r\n\r\nEl.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    that they were there. In his own uses of the typefaces I can see that they are
    there as well.\r\n\r\nThe programs in which the spaces didn't show up were Word
    and Text Edit. He (the type designer) is as baffled by this as I am.\r\n\r\nbest\r\n\r\nEl."

  body: The only thing I can think of is if he somehow created a space of zero width
    that only works by positive kerning with the set of all other characters. Or vice
    versa, a space with correct sidebearings but kerning that makes it disappear.
    I don't know how one would do either of those things by accident, but see if there's
    a difference if you turn kerning on or off.

    \"metrical data\" but a character.    A TeX dvi file is the only thing I know
    of where a space is \"metrical data.\"\r\n\r\nMy wife had something similar happen
    with InDesign and a job that mixed OpenType and Type 1 fonts. When they made a
    PDF, the spaces went away. They finally got them back, don't remember how.\r\n\r\nI
    would suggest that as a start, the fonts be resent, but zipped or stuffed. Second,
    would be to remake the Mac fonts from the Windows format. Of course, all this
    assumes you're not violating a license; couldn't recommend that. "

  body: Hmmm thanks guys. Curiouser and curiouser. I'll have to put it in the hands
    of the type designer and see if he can see if there was a problem with the initial
    conversion. I guess that's the most likely thing.

  body: One thing your type designer friend should check for is whether the font has
    an "HT" (horizontal tab) character--it shouldn't. I seem to recall a problem with
    some Type 1 fonts that cropped up with OS X wherein, if there was an HT character
    in the font, OS X would use it instead of the "space" character in TextEdit and
    some other apps. It seems that Fontographer would (sometimes? always? not sure)
    add the HT character automatically, giving it a width of zero. Hence, it would
    look like the space character was missing.

  body: "Well I've checked and the space \"character\" is certainly there in the font,
    so the problem must be that it isn't being read. Mark, what slot does this HT
    character typically occupy. If I can find it I could probably just delete it to
    make everything work fine \u2014 or give it the same width as the space character."

  body: "What I meant by name conflict is that the characters from one font will be
    crammed onto the metrics of a narrower font, making it look like there are no
    spaces -- and also tight tracking.\r\n\r\nCan you post a visual so we can see
    what the problem looks like?"

  body: "I think the problem is this horizontal tab character. It is indeed present
    and does indeed have zero width. I have the slightly clunky fix of first giving
    that character the same width as the space character. Then I save the entire thing
    as otf rather than ps 1. Now the spaces are in the font as they should be \u2014
    and I needn't care where the word spaces are coming from.\r\n\r\nBut is it possible
    in Font Forge to simply delete the horizontal tab character? I suppose that would
    require undefining that slot. Is that possible? Clearing the slot doesn't do it
    since it is already clear.\r\n\r\nAs to name conflict: yes the names are really
    all over the place on this, but no amount of editing them is making the problem
    go away. And the problem is occurring where there are no condensed fonts.\r\n\r\nOne
    last bit of info: the fonts were made on Mac 8.6 and I don't think they've previously
    been tested on OSX.\r\n\r\nA very intriguing puzzle though!\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    don't mess with Macs, so I can't test this. But if the presence of the HT character
    in the font causes the \"space\" in text file to be hex 0009, all you have done
    is leave a time-bomb. Consider justified copy . . . Consider an XML file made
    from a Word document where the \"spaces\" are really a HT . . ."

    here is an update: this problem seems to be fixed in OSX 10.5.2, because the fonts
    that show up in the menu actually work properly. (The downside: not every weight
    shows up in the menu!)"

  body: Charles, the bug doesn't change spaces to HTs in the text file, it just affects
    how spaces are displayed on-screen in some fonts. It's still encoded as a space
    when saved to disk. So El's workaround shouldn't cause any problems. The better
    solution, however, is to remove the HT character from the font. There is no reason
    for it to be present.

    Or maybe once a long time ago. I seem to recall seeing 2/3 of Koerner, Ray & Glover

  body: "Thanks for your help guys \u2014 it's been invaluable. I said above that
    this bug seems to have been fixed in 10.5.2. I'm not 100% sure of that. I had
    a case crop up, but now I can't reproduce it. So Leopard may still have a little
    way to go before it irons out this problem.\r\n\r\nFont Forge doesn't have an
    obvious way of simply undefining a slot \u2014 not that I have been able to find
    \u2014 so I've done the next best thing and changed the slot to .not def. Actually
    I suspect that just saving the outline file to OTF makes this problem go away
    because I think OSX.4 understands where to get the space character with open type
    fonts. At any rate, I have been able to get the font to work reliably now so thanks.
    (I've even added extremal points, corrected directions, and added autohints.)\r\n\r\nNick
    \u2014 sorry, I couldn't post an image as it would have been breaking a confidence.\r\n\r\nCheers
