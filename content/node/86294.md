  documents (dictionaries and textbooks) over the next 12 months as part of my Masters
  programme in Reading, and I'm just wondering if there's anybody here who I should
  be in touch with.\r\n\r\nI'm fully aware of the scarcity and quality of Burmese
  fonts currently available, which is one reason why I've chosen such an under-represented
  script. I will be doing research into the derivation and styles of the Burmese letterforms,
  the writing system, OpenType scripting, keyboard layouts, and the current and future
  challenges and needs of lexicographers and educators in Burma.\r\n\r\nMany thanks."

  body: "Incidentally, while I don't know much about this area, I have read that the
    Unicode characters allocated to Burmese, while they are sufficient to represent
    the language using an advanced Unicode implementation, are insufficient - one
    needs more glyphs with distinct codes - for conventional software to handle it.\r\n\r\nBut
    because there weren't a lot of computers in Burma back when, there weren't pre-existing
    standard codes with those glyphs defined, so unlike more economically important
    languages, Burmese got the full purist treatment from Unicode.\r\n\r\nSo anyone
    aspiring to design a Unicode font for Burmese will need to know a lot about the
    writing system to properly implement support for the language - and the list of
    characters won't show all the glyphs you will need to define."

    and African Studies (SOAS) in London. He literally wrote the book on Burmese script,
    and is an invaluable resource.\r\n\r\nI am in touch with a typographer in Burma
    too, and I will direct him to this thread.\r\n\r\nI strongly recommend checking
    out the Win8 developer preview to which Si alludes. This is the first official
    implementation of the script in OpenType (there have been some hacked attempts),
    and is a useful guide."

  body: 'John, what you say is true of all the South and Southeast Asian scripts in
    Unicode: they all require complex character ordering, glyph shaping and dynamic
    mark positioning. Burmese is no different in this respect than Thai, Khmer, Lao,
    or any of the many Indian scripts or Tibetan.'

    yes, as the font won't work without the shaping support. \r\n\r\n>Si, I'll e-mail,
    thank you.\r\n\r\nActually Okell and the designer John mentions are probably the
    best people to talk to,  but get in touch and we'll try to give you some details
    of known limitations with the Win8 DP support. "

    true that Thai has similar complexities - I remember seeing specific complaints
    about the treatment Burmese had gotten from the Unicode consortium, and I thought
    that Thai was more economically important and had a longer history of use with
    computers (i.e. there's a six-level TTY code for Thai that's been in use a long
    time) and so might have had a slightly easier time of it.\r\n\r\nBut I also had
    read other comments that Burmese was just one example of the short shrift the
    less major languages had received - unlike even, say, Arabic - so I'm not surprised
    to hear it's a general complaint."

  body: "Right. I've installed Windows 8 on my desktop machine. Not enjoying the experience
    unfortunately, but I'll have a good explore with Myanmar Text that comes with
    it. At first glance, I'm seeing a lot of OpenType features I've never heard of
    before (rphr, psts for example) but after a couple of days' learning about how
    complicated the writing system is, I'm not surprised there's going to be a lot
    to learn.\r\n\r\nIt seems I need to get really clear on the distinction between
    'letter', 'character' and 'glyph'. There are some odd behaviours I hadn't counted
    on (unlike in Thai which I'm very familiar with). In Burmese, the 'a' vowel should
    have a tall variant when positioned next to certain initial consonants, but the
    tall variant also needs to be keyable directly and has a codepoint \u2014 no problem
    there (at least until you start on Karen which I understand uses the two characters
    to represent different letters!). By contrast, the 'u' under-vowels are sometimes
    contextually switched to tall variants (where there's already a descender in the
    way?) and in other cases it'll be interesting to figure out how to allow the user
    to choose them (perhaps even without a glyph palette) even when not actually necessary,
    when there isn't a codepoint. Challenges ahead. I'm really starting to see why
    proper Burmese fonts have taken so long to appear. "
