body: A while ago I came across a website about scripts used in Bible manuscripts
  and other books. Black background, some text, and lovely examples of pages sum up
  the content. Unfortunately I can't remember the URL or where I found a link to it.
  I know the information above is sketchy, but does anyone know what I am talking
  about? Other resources concerning the same subject are welcome. Thank you.

  body: "Well lets see, the original languages were Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek.\r\n\r\nSince
    then it has been translated into many languages.  Latin was common for western
    civilization and many monks spent years illuminating latin bibles.  Gutenberg
    printed bibles in german, which have been compared in quality to existing german
    manuscripts (in blackletter) so I imagine after that german manuscripts became
    popular as well.\r\n\r\nI think by the time the english bible came into existence,
    the era of hand-written manuscripts was over.\r\n\r\nWhat did the pages look like:
    where they all text, or did they have colour or illustration on them.  I think
    of the Book of Kells first when you said this.\r\n\r\nA blackletter bible would
    also be easy to recognize because of the unique script used."

  body: The site contained different samples of manuscripts. The treasure was in the
    images. It had examples of illuminated manuscripts, with exquisite drop caps,
    borders and other visual elements. I think it presented different manuscripts
    and the evolution of the writing style.

    I have more Times New Roman to look at :)

    Dan (Is the logo working o.k.?). Could it have been the site for the St John's
    Bible out of Michigan done by Donald Jackson and his bunch?\r\n\r\nMight want
    to try cynscribe.com as a starting point.\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: "@Michael, \r\nI appreciate your suggestions. No, it's not those sites, but
    the links you gave me are helpful as well. As for the logo, it's great! I did
    not get a chance to use it officially yet, as we ended our summer camp season,
    but will start work on the website soon and next year's materials (i will send
    you a couple of samples). You didn't get my last e-mail when I confirmed the final
    version of the logo? \r\n\r\n@ Graham, \r\nThank you for the link. "

    the only German translation until Martin Luther's edition of 1522.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
