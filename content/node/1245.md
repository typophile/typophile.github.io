    who owns a legal software - FontLab, i think that i deserve the benefits as a
    customer. <BR> <BR>i don&#39;t think that i need to wait over a month to update
    my FL4.5. let&#39;s say, even i sent an email to the wrong person. at least -
    i deserve an email,  an answer, something like: &#34;sorry. i&#39;m not the right
    person. you need to contact....you need to do....&#34;. so i&#39;ll be happy.
    and my clients too.  <BR> <BR>but to wait over a month!!! why??? <BR> <BR>so -
    if i&#39;m not happy. why to work with FL? <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>David Hamuel'

  body: 'Because the initial question of Daniel is still unanswered, I will give some
    first-hand info here. <BR> <BR>Although the demo splash screens of both Bezier-
    and IkarusMaster in the light edition may cause some confusion &#40;we will change
    this in the coming update&#41;, the functionality of the editors is only limited
    concerning the numbers of glyphs &#40;256 maximum&#41;. All the other functionality
    is the same as in the full version. With the light version of DataMaster PostScript
    Type 1 fonts for Mac OS and Windows can be generated. <BR> <BR>Although FM has
    been developed for extensive font production, it is actually quite easy to handle,
    although the first impression might perhaps be different. For full control over
    the functionality the learning curve might be steeper though, but it is worth
    the effort to learn the structure of the supporting files, like for instance the
    Character Layout files or the files that control the generation of the composites.
    <BR> <BR>A short &#39;quick start manual&#39;: <BR>To be able to open a font in
    Bezier- or IkarusMaster, it must be converted with DataMaster first into a BE
    or IK file. To test the modules, it is also possible to open a font from the FM
    Demo font folder, which the installer places in the FM &#40;Light&#41; folder
    &#40;on the Mac by default in the Applications [Mac OS 9] directory&#41;. To work
    on the glyphs you need BezierMaster for the BE format or IkarusMaster for the
    IK format. When you open a font file in for instance BezierMaster, the first thing
    you will see is an overview of all the glyphs on the left from where glyphs can
    be opened, deleted or added. This will be quite unfamiliar for those who are used
    to Fontographer or FontLab, especially because you need to understand the way
    the database numbers work. As an alternative you can use the Font Administration
    window, from where you can work more or less the same way as in most other editors.
    In the Font Administration tool characters can be opened, copied and pasted using
    code pages, character numbers or Unicode numbers. The available batch functionality
    in the Font Administration tool is quite helpful. Changes in the Font Administration
    window are automatically saved. <BR> <BR>You will notice that the available functionality
    differs when a Character Edit window is opened. You can switch between the glyph
    list on the left and the character window to see that for instance the Metrics
    Editor and Metrics Table are available when the glyph list is selected and specific
    tools for the contour editing will come available in case the Character Edit window
    is selected. In the Metrics Editor you can type the standard characters and use
    the character numbers to select all the glyphs from the database. To generate
    kerning you need to select a .afm or .fea file first. If you don&#39;t have such
    a file already you can generate an empty text file using a text editor, which
    you can give for instance the same name as your database. To change the appearance
    of the editors and for instance the behavior of the cursor, you can alter the
    settings in the Config menu which is available when the Character Edit window
    has been selected. <BR> <BR>Generating a font is quite simple: just select the
    database in DataMaster and select the output format. The naming of the font is
    taken from the name of the database. Info for the auto-hinting is taken partly
    from the Font Header, which can be altered in both editors. If you want to be
    in full control, you have the push the &#39;Advanced&#39; button.'

  body: 'David, <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t actually want to do technical and administrative
    support on this forum, but in your case it looks that something was just wrong.
    It usually takes about 24 hours to process any request by our sales department.
    Please, fill an update request form one more time and contact me directly if it
    will not work. <BR> <BR>We decided to not publish freely downloadable 4.5-&#62;4.6
    update because we are releasing it for free and we don&#39;t want to give this
    update &#40;which is very serious&#41; to non-legal users of FontLab. That&#39;s
    why you have to pass trough this upgrade process. 4.6.1 update which we plan to
    release soon will be available as simple download and will fix few problems in
    4.6. <BR> <BR>I will say it again: if you contact us and get no reply in 48 hours
    then it means that there is a problem in communication. Just post your question
    again to <a href="mailto:support@fontlab.com">support@fontlab.com</a>.  <BR> <BR>And
    you always have a backup support system: <a href="http://groups.msn.com/fontlab"
    target="_blank">http://groups.msn.com/fontlab</a>. All messages posted to that
    forum go to my mailbox immediately. Sometimes you will get faster answer from
    other FontLab users who are there. <BR> <BR>Best regards, <BR>yar[at]fontlab[dot]com'

  body: Thanks a lot Frank, <BR> <BR>I have downloaded the manual now and it sounds
    very interesting. If I have enough time i will have a closer look at fontmaster.
    <BR>I think its a great idea to publish a limited free version, especially for
    people who are new in typedesign. So you can get started and if you get more professionell
    you buy the full version. so i thougt when i bought TypeTool.  <BR> <BR>thanks
    again!
