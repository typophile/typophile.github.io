They should be placed shifted down, but not as far as the baseline. Some (most?) typefaces have them aligned at the ascender by default, which is also wrong. I can't post images just now, but I will try to do that tomorrow, if that helps and if you can wait that long.</div>

Hello Mr Cordoba, <cite>how</cite> wrong is this? I made the same observation as Mr Papazian, and for this reason -- deliberately -- chose the position between baseline and H-height. Another issue is that an x-height-aligned questiondown may require quite a few kerning pairs.
But seeing '¡Hola, Ricardo!' above (exclamdown aligned with uppercase), I could as well argue that descending exclamdown and questiondown are easier to recognize. Hm.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Like all things in type the details of the face ( style, weight, serifs etc.), and your intent will come into the equations as well. The shape of the Question mark & Exclam are important too. 

Not that it is important, I tend to like the feeling of x-height ish alignment better. But I don't read it very much so my opinion is only worth just so much. Some ideas about why I feel that ways include: 

- It might be that lowering the mark before a capital let's me see the the next letter faster/easier. eg - the mark gets in the way of my reading less. (If true this would be a good reason or an endorsement )

- It might be that a lowered x-height ish alignment has a better 'cue value'. Or put another way it may be that I can recognise the ¡ or ¿ faster when they take that alignment.  (If true this would be a good reason or an endorsement )

- It feels more even more 'different' than an H height alignment & I like the exotic quality ( not an endoresement or a negative ) 

None of this is more important than using your own Eyes. Find what works best for the face & the reader.

<em>The inverted symbols are usually followed by a cap.</em>

Well, if they are at the beginning of a sentence, yes, they would be followed by a cap. But a question or exclamation can begin mid-sentence, thus:

<strong>Hrant, ¿qué opinas de esta fuente?</strong>

<strong>Hace calor, ¡quiero un helado!</strong>

These upside down symbols act as visual cues, to let a reader know when to change intonation, much as the accents (or tildes, as they are known in Español), let you know where the stress falls in a word -- but that is a whole 'nother subject.  :-)</div>

Well, I just read the Microsoft guidelines that Paul posted, and I didn't know about the display setting...

Hey, that's our job as type designers anyway. Most punctuation needs to be kerned. Quotation marks can be annoying, but you don't go around changing their vertical position to make them easier to kern... right?   ;-)</div>

R.C. -- <cite>Hey, that’s our job as type designers anyway. Most punctuation needs to be kerned.</cite>

Definitely. Yet one cannot kern <cite>everything</cite>, I mean, even in high-quality typefaces I find combinations which slipped attention but may occur in this or that language. So if adjusting shapes helps avoid necessity of kerning in the first place, great.

E.S. -- <cite>None of this is more important than using your own Eyes. Find what works best for the face & the reader.</cite>

The latter in particular, since I do not read Spanish! It would be interesting to hear many opinions of Spanish speaking collegues.
Just like in previous discussions (would Americans accept guillemets? what about spaced punctuation marks?), I am interested in finding out whether something is de facto convention, or readers do not really care but typographers are taught or teach so, or is propagated by specific typographic 'schools', or is the opinion of individuals.</div>

Karsten, I agree. And one cannot anticipate every situation, especially in languages one does not know! (If I remember correctly, <em>The Elements of Typographic Style</em> is a good resource, as it gives examples of frequently occurring letters or combinations for several languages.) And then once the typeface is out there, different typesetters will have their own kerning preferences... (And I just saw your e-mail, which I'll reply to!)

These first two images are from the novel <em>Puras mentiras</em>, by Juan Forn, an Argentine writer, and published by Alfaguara in 2001 -- presumably this book was typeset in Argentina (sorry, the colophon is rather skimpy on details). Here the exclamdown and questiondown line up at the x-height.

This volume was published by Editorial Gustavo Gili, of Spain, in 1998. (Again, there is no colophon explaining who did the typesetting or which faces were used -- usually, books published in Spanish-speaking countries simply have a note at the end stating the printer's name, how many copies were printed, and the date. Sometimes the designer of the cover will be mentioned on the copyrights page.)

Anyway, these examples are interesting because one uses small caps, but the questiondown still lines up with the small caps rather than the initial cap; the second example shows the questiondown following a colon -- and still lining up with the x-height.

		<div class="commentbody">Very nice examples. I've been looking at all the Spanish-language editions on newseum every day*, and I think there's a definite preference for x-height alignment. Nearly all the uses I've seen there (admitedly <em>very</em> unscientific methodology) have caps-height alignment only in ads (which seems to me to connote shouting). 

(<em>Del Diseño</em> looks like it could have used better typography: there's no fi-ligature in <em>manifiesta</em>, and those small caps look faked!)

		<div class="commentbody">I think the design of an individual typeface cannot be completely hostage to convention / tradition any more than it can afford to ignore them. Sometimes it's a great idea to break a rule. Not often. The only way to know is to look; and then weigh the consequences for yourself.

So it could be that those with the H height are being somehow culturally insensitive or something but  - I can't quite sign up for that because I am not utterly sold on the idea that there is a 'convention' yet. Partly I get this from looking around the font universe. 

Looking at News Gothic the Bitstream version uses the H height. The Linotype NewsGothic uses the x. These seem to be true house-wide ( mostly ). Freight uses the H. Bello, & Feijoa the x. Tiptoe & Omnes the H. Amalia, & Fedra the x. Parry & Sansa Slab the H. Candy Script ( and all of Ale Paul's others) use the x more or less. Eduardo's fonts ( emtype ) all seem to use the x.

It also seems to me that the heavier the face is, and the more geared to display work the face is, the more an H height alignment seems reasonable. The spirit of the type might suggest what is right too. A slab Egyptian or a modernist face 's 'raison d'être' might be most compatible with an H height aligned '¿'.  

Still, Ricardo, thanks for posting the link to Malena. And your example is exactly the kind of thing that looks pleasant/natural to my foreign eyes; naive as they are.

I also agree that hearing from further from Ricardo, Ale Paul, Eduardo Manso, & Miguel Hernández would be far more useful than the meagre theory & observations I have offered.

Still, since that's all I have I will go on a little further. 

It seems to me that the design of the ¡ ¿ ? & ! probably aught to be done differently if you intend a heavy Spanish/Catalan use. In addition to certain alignments being easier to kern for; or looking better; ( or insert your concern here )- certain forms probably work better when they are spun around than others. Maybe softer hooks?  Does anybody create a different shape for their '¿' vs. '?' ? It seems like that might be a very good idea as well. I should check to see  if that is already being done actually... Maybe these are silly ideas. What do you all think? Any examples?

		<div class="commentbody">Both of Ricardo's examples are set in Adobe Garamond, so they don't provide much variety of evidence. I would guess that, in these cases, the position of the questiondown is more a matter of the typeface/font design, than any typesetting convention. Presumably, however, Adobe and Slimbach did some surveying and gave some consideration to the standards that they've adopted for their Originals series. And, presumably, the designers of these books gave some consideration to what the questiondown looked like before settling on Adobe Garamond. (Or not.)

What these examples do show is that the x-aligned questiondown does not violate any general cultural acceptance. 

The best perspective, however, will still be provided by a native Spanish-speaking typographer or type designer who is steeped in his/her own tradition.

I would hypothesize that historically (meaning handset metal) the questiondown was originally just an inverted question mark, and so it's position relative to the baseline would depend upon the proportions of the font at hand. (Similarly, the earliest opening quote was an inverted comma, and so the alignment of opening quotation marks sometimes varied from that of closing quotes/apostrophes.)

Relatively longer descenders (like in a Garamond) would yield a top alignment closer to the x-height. Relatively shorter descenders would yield a questiondown that aligns higher.

Eben said... <em>I am not utterly sold on the idea that there is a ‘convention’ yet...</em>

Kent said... <em>What these examples do show is that the x-aligned questiondown does not violate any general cultural acceptance.</em>

I need to expand a little on my earlier comments... I had some schooling in Argentina and some in the States... It is in Argentine grade schools that I was taught to vertically dip the upside-down exclamation point and question mark in my handwriting... After a while it becomes second nature and you don't even think about it. Of course handwriting is not the same as typography, but they are closely related, no?  :-)

<em>Both of Ricardo’s examples are set in Adobe Garamond, so they don’t provide much variety of evidence.</em>

Thanks for catching that, Kent! As tired as I was two nights ago, picking out books, and as tired as I was last night, scanning and posting examples, I can't believe I didn't even notice that either of them were set in Garamond to begin with! 

Now, I don't have that many books in Spanish with me right now; I left a lot of them in Buenos Aires when I moved to New York. But even if I had them all here, I suspect that a lot of the fiction titles would also be set in Garamond... While I was working in Buenos Aires during the 90s, there was a pretty big economic recession in progress, and I know that most book publishers could not afford to spend a lot of money on cover design and illustration... I doubt that they would have been able to invest in many typefaces, either... (I could be very wrong about this, though. It would be good to hear from some other Argentine designers, to see what they say.)

Kent also said... <em>I would guess that, in these cases, the position of the questiondown is more a matter of the typeface/font design, than any typesetting convention...</em> and <em>...presumably, the designers of these books gave some consideration to what the questiondown looked like before settling on Adobe Garamond. (Or not.)</em>

Very nicely put -- maybe they did, maybe they didn't.

I'll be posting some display face examples next, and they may just add to the confusion!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Here are a couple of scans from the book <em>¡Yo no fui!</em>, by Argentine cartoonist Quino (first published by Ediciones de la Flor in 1994; layout and cover by Pablo Barragán).

In the first image, from the cover, the exclam-down lines up with the caps... is it the typeface or the typesetter?

And the second image is from one of Quino's cartoons... I decided to post it in light of some of the topics coming up in this thread. I know that Quino studied architecture at university, and that he is oh-so-meticulous in his drawings... If you look at the bottom lefthand drawing, the two exclamatory sentences in a row provide another good reason to dip the exclam-down. Also notice how Quino makes his exclamation points slightly diagonal, to either give emphasis or to keep the exclam-down from looking like a lowercase i...

		<div class="commentbody">Here are three examples from a children's magazine, Billiken -- I briefly (very briefly!) worked there as a layout artist in 1992, and this was before they switched over to Macintosh production of the mechanicals. So they had typesetters doing phototypesetting in another part of the building.

In the first sample we have an all-caps Futura headline in which the exclam-down is slightly shifted below the baseline... wheras in the U&lc sentence within the yellow word balloon, we again have Futura, but the exclam-down is aligned at the x-height.

In the second example the exclam-downs are lined up with the caps in an all-caps subhead, but in the third example the exclam-down is once again shifted slighty down, in spite of the all-caps headline...

My only guess is that in this case, in which all of the magazine's headlines were set in Futura, the variations in the vertical position of the exclam-down and question-down depended on the knowledge/care/obsessiveness of each individual typesetter at the plant... I never got to meet any of them, so I really don't know. But Kent's earlier observation certainly seems to apply here.

That's because the small caps are faux.

Here's the breakdown:

1. Caps with small caps - wrong
2. Caps with small caps - correct
3. Caps with small caps - wrong
4. All small caps - correct
5. All caps - correct

Adobe Garamond Pro gives you (1) with both small caps, and all small caps settings.

Am I right about (2) Miguel -- or is (3) preferred? And if so, presumably because of the tails to cap Q and J?</div>

Indeed, this should be part of the -preferably dynamic/contextual-
determination of what kind of opening question mark looks best.

In contrast, as Kent Lew says, it is not clear whether typographers decided for this or that positioning intentionally or just relied on the font's default.

Out of interest, since we touched kerning earlier: Are no quotation marks used in Spanish, so quotation mark to exclamdown/questiondown would be an unlikely combination?

Lowered relative to what?! -- relative to the capitals that immediately follow, yes, but in relaton to the text as a whole, which wanders considerably from the baseline, no -- and that is logical, when one considers that the exclam down always prefigures by the final exclamup, and in so doing establishes a relationship with every character in the journey to the end of the sentence, and must harmonize with them all. 

<em>the little spaces after ¡ and before ! </em>

The exclams' spacing too should be contextual -- needed for an all-cap setting, and more so for sans than serif. Memo to OT developers: alternate exclam glyphs for "case" feature should have wider sidebearing.


Here's a typeface where there are no descenders in caps or small caps (notably, the Q and J).
Is option (3) still preferable to option (2)?

No, but people also "read" the typography as a whole, and are aware of deviations and consistencies in the overall matrix. After all, it's against this background understanding of the implicit  "big" grammatical structure -- which can extend to long sentences with many subordinate clauses -- that punctuation marks and page layouts have meaning. Emphases (parentheses, italics, bold) must also be read in this way, with a remembrance/anticipation of text outside immediate focus and attention.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nick, thanks for expanding the Small Caps issue. You are right - it's more complicated.

Karsten said <cite> it shows that the positioning was chosen intentionally</cite> I feel slightly uneasy cleanly extrapolating from handmade comic lettering to text or even to display in type. That said, I think there is plenty to learn from handmade comic lettering, not least in this case. So I agree - mostly.

Miguel, thanks for checking in! 

The thing that strikes me most about 1-5 is that it looks to my eye like it would be possible to design agreeable versions of both Cap aligned & x aligned question & exam marks. If I have time I will try to show what I mean. 

<cite>The exclams’ spacing too should be contextual</cite>  Of course I think it should all be contextual.... but that's a side issue.

Even though this thread has been interesting, I don't think my mind has been changed - just shifted. It seems valid to me to do either thing, but in general and for text especially I will favor Richard & Miguel's preference. As far as Nicks CAP examples. I think 3,4& 5 all look okay to me. 1 & 2 do not. But As I said, I think that's a function of the design of the faces used nearly as much as it is a function of what tends to look/feel best. 

The ¡YO NO FUI! example is nice because It's a great example of where a Modern sensibility seems to be better served or at least is more consistent with the H align model.</div>

I've occasionally had the experience where the first first thing I notice about a page of type--the instant I look at it--is a typo. (or an f-i that isn't ligatured, or a straight quote mark). I wonder if other people have had the same experience.

Wanna hear something funny? Yesterday I was examining that book more closely, and on the spine the title is set in a different typeface, with a lowered exclamdown character! Talk about inconsistencies.  :-)

I'll try to post a scan of it later.

Sure, spotting typos is learned, but so are such simple activities as picking berries or lice eggs.

Not every text is as simple as a book page. Legal and government documents with their hierarchy of numbered paragraphs and sub-sections (and the Bible) are texts where page-context is important in reading. I'm guessing that not all saccadic scans follow the bouncing ball, and a brief internet search of scientific literature reveals that the "foraging" nature of saccadic eye movements has been documented.

The presence of an opening question/exclamation mark in some languages and not others suggests the complexity of the issue. How is it that English readers are able to start reading a long question with the final mark well in the distance? Are there sufficient grammatical cues in the opening words, or do we "catch" the question mark in "the corner of the eye" in a foraging saccade?</div>

Is immersion therefore primarily interpretive?
I'm imagining a concept rather like a "magnetic" Flash interaction, where the reader attempts to direct a concentrated flow of saccadic movements towards the next word, but foraging saccades are always bouncing off all over the place retrieving information that's mostly irrelevant, but nonetheless has to be processed in the feedback loop.</div>

I'm not sure what you mean.
What I'm getting at is that during immersion we don't care much
about consistency of alignment and other such conscious frills.

> foraging saccades

Errant saccades break immersion.

A good example here is when you start to read a question but only realize it's a question when you see the mark at the end, often resulting in a regression just to revisit what's been previously read. This is in fact why opening question marks are so useful. I wouldn't mind seeing them ported over to English! Or even better, do what Armenian does: allow question marks directly on the vowel(s) in question, so to speak.  :-)

On the other hand, a reader can -and does- go in and out of immersion,
so there certainly can/should not be such a thing as a "pure" text face.

Look at your own sentence. Spanish structure is less explicit and benefits from leading punctuation. English tends to put big honking clues at the beginning of sentences that are questions. Generally in English you invert the order of the statement and that signals a question. Spanish, not as much. </div>

I was thinking about what Hrant said about putting the ? mark at the beginning of a sentence in English. I think that while it's obvious it isn't likely to happen any time soon - it's an interesting question anyway. But I don't agree with his idea that it would be a good plan. Discovering that a sentence is a question, or guessing based on the structure is a deep part of English. It seems like an essential aspect of the language to me. 

English is really flexible, and keeps changing so 'why object?' you might ask. But the flexibility is mostly in vocabulary I think. Which is why English has an unusual number of words. The grammar sticks around. No? And Unlike using <<>> (or >><<) vs "" ; the use of ¿ at the beginning of a sentence changes the 'way' it means what it means by changing the process you use to get there.

I would be interested what readers of Spanish think of this idea. Does it feel different to find a question in English Vs. Spanish?

¿Would it feel weird to me to see an opening question mark in an English sentence? ¡Yep, it sure would!  ;-)

Just as weird as coming upon written Spanish questions or exclamations that are missing these opening characters... (Full disclosure: I grew up bilingual.) But I see this a lot in e-mails and on websites -- not every Spanish-speaking person bothers to place all of the accents on the vowels that need them, for that matter, or to even draw the tilde on top of the <strong>ñ</strong>, even when they know that <strong>año</strong> does not mean the same as <strong>ano</strong>...  ;-)  I've seen examples of people deliberately spelling <strong>año</strong> as <strong>anio</strong>, because they don't know the keyboard shortcut for the <strong>ñ</strong> (whether on Mac or on Windows).</div>

No.
The establishment, in any given field, is always fighting change,
even if the benefit to most people is clear. Because people tend to
care about themselves, about their own comfort, more than the
development/integrity of what are essentially abstractions.

That sounds like speech to me, not writing; I'd expect the writing of the same speaker to be atrocious in a different way, or possibly better than his/her speech, but not the same. I've seen a lot of examples of this. Some very eloquent people write like children and vice versa.

You tend to be on the constant lookout for ways to reform language and writing, and you must realize it's not my opinion or conservatism that's in your way, it's the collective momentum/weight of some long-evolved systems that have been adapted by millions of people to be very, very flexible and expressive.

		<div class="commentbody">So Hrant, your argument to us is that it is a purely functional benefit. 

Maaaaybe. But consider this counter argument: Culture. 

Before you convict me of being a poet or something; [ <Cite>heaven forfend! ;-) </cite> ] consider Japanese. In Japanese they have a less precise way of describing most things. A lot of context is needed to successfully 'get' what going on both in written form & speech. It's not a language in which it's easy to say for instance precisely where something is located like it is in German or English. But they like it that way. It's a positive cultural value from their point of view and I have heard many quite convincing arguments about what the benefits are mostly having to do with the richness and subtlety of expression that possible and engagement that the language requires - an Engagement that English doesn't require or cultivate to nearly the same degree.   

Why all the Japanese stuff? Because I think that a valid counter argument might well be that English is already so over-specific that it needs all the room for swoooshy vagueness it can get. The inherently structurally repressed subtlety might be cultivating an unconscious wish for a more vagueness & poetry. That wish might account for the habit of English to acquire endless new words ( Oooh! What could <cite>that</cite> mean? ); and a significant tolerance and even love of dialects. Both things provide perhaps a kind of needed 'terra incognito' ready to be explored.

The additional immediacy and clarity that an added ¿ to the front of an English sentence/question makes it clamp down harder. Or put another way - it stamps out a minor sense of suspense. 

<cite>You</cite> might like that a lot given your predilection for spiky fonts and short brusque replys. And that's fine. I even like it about you. 

But what's good for you may not be what the Culture of English wants - quite apart from what cultural gatekeepers, establishment types, the conservative by virtue of being frail and scared, and assorted stand-ins for 'the man' and Cruft might say.  Sure they may be a pain in the ass. May be? ARE. But I think that's not all that's going on.

Well, need is relative. Is the need for Beorcana so great? Both opening question marks (in English) and Beorcana are <em>improvements</em>, and that's all the reason crazy people like us need! And when you say "your POV is not average", I would counter that <em>our</em> POV is not average!

> You tend to be on the constant lookout

Well, I tend to be on the constant lookout for improvements anywhere. It's just that I don't share most people's inhibition against reforming the most basic things we take for granted. The fact that I'm a writing-system mongrel is probably the reason.

> Did you have trouble understanding those last sentences?

Well, to clarify, it's not about understanding, it's about readability (specifically, reducing regressions). You can understand text set in NotCaslon, but that doesn't make it a text face.

> the collective momentum/weight of some long-evolved systems that have
> been adapted by millions of people to be very, very flexible and expressive.

I think a lot of it is dumb luck, and a lot of it is just dumb. Some things make sense, some don't. I believe neither in perfection, nor in improvement through oblivion; the users of something (in this case written language) aren't necessarily experts in understanding and leveraging it. And they don't even want to be. That's our job/problem.

> English is already so over-specific that it needs
> all the room for swoooshy vagueness it can get.

I actually don't think this is far-fetched. A good example is the power of ambiguity in the English "you", which is not explicitly singular or plural. It's really quite powerful in that way.

But this is not what's driving the resistance we're seeing here.

		<div class="commentbody">Okay a few quick notes here.

If you take a look at the publisher Cátedra (one of the most common I see in literature courses because they always do very good critical editions), the font they used to use was always the lowered version.  However, in recent editions, they have changed fonts and now use one that has the ¡ and ¿ at the same positioning as an l, rather than a j.  I've always considered the l-positioned version to be more "modern", with the j-positioned being the more traditional.

hrant: Just like in German you might see a double-acute instead of an umlaut, in Spanish I know many people who write both ´ and ~ as a macron over their letters, myself included (mine is a very low-slanted acute over both).  This isn't a modern convention, at least not in anything handwritten as you'll see handwritten documents dating back hundreds of years doing this, although in the typographical world it's a little bit more contemporary.  A lot of road/metro signs in Spain will use it.  I don't know about Latin America though.  Incidentally, as you can see from most of the examples already posted, it is far more common and traditional in Spanish texts for the tilde to appear slanted upwards, that looks more like the flames coming out of lamps in a lot of university logos than what most consider a tilde.  Also, at least in the Golden Age books I've worked with, a smaller italic tilde would actually look more like an inverted breve, though a lot more crescent-like.  I can't get the insert-image thing to work but I'll try posting for work tomorrow when I'm on a PC.

Hence Cataluña / Catalunya, año / any, cañón / canyó.

I forgot to mention earlier that this happens a lot to Spanish names and last names in the U.S., too.

Every time I see the name of film director Victor Nunez, for example, my reaction is always to think, "Well, it's <em>really</em> written Núñez"... Or even my own last name... in print (on my letterhead, say) I still place an accent on it: Córdoba. But with my username here on Typophile, or for e-mail and other online stuff, technological limitations force me to use Cordoba.

Well, wait a minute... "Canyada" (or "Cañada", or "Caniada") does not sound like "Canada"... In the case of a place name that's been "localized", isn't it better to just go with the flow?

In the suburbs of Buenos Aires there is a borough called Hurlingham, because it was settled by Britons, but in Spanish the "H" is silent, and the "u" sounds like "ooh" does in English. So you always get people discussing what the correct pronunciation is... But most people in Argentina pronounce it "in Spanish" and silence the H, even the ones who know English. It's not "correct", but it makes life easier, y'know?  :-)</div>

It's a shame you can't upload any images right now, guifa, because as Kent said earlier, it would be good to see the fonts they were using before and after. And of course there is no way of knowing if anyone at Cátedra took note of this difference, or if they just didn't have time to change that... 

I was looking at some books from a Buenos Aires schoolbook publisher I used to work for, and I found one where depending on the font, the placement of the exclamdown and questiondown varies... I don't remember anyone ever saying anything about that while I was there...

But I wouldn't say it's been "localized", for the

When it's missing, or it's replaced with a macron

This is just blind speculation on my part, but it could also be that the makers of the older, handmade signs were more aware of the Spanish origins of the name, or even that they came from Spanish-speaking families. Anyway, it wouldn't be the first time a word that comes from another culture gradually morphs into something slightly different -- just look at the origins of the word <strong>moccasin</strong>, or the name <strong>Manhattan</strong>.</div>
