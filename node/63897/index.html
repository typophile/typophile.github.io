  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi there, 

First post and I hope its in the right place.
I have a odd request/question for you all here.
I want to buy fonts from LHF - Letterheas Fonts, but when I try that I get the answer "We don’t accept orders from Sweden" ... thats it, no statement why or anything like that.

So my question is, does anybody here know if its possible to buy em from somwhere else? Or is it possible to buy it from one of you users here maybe? (And yes Ive asked LHF but got no response back. )

Thanx!

/Henrik</div>

		<div class="commentbody">That's an odd one for sure. I'm in the UK and have bought direct from their website in the past with no problems. I guess the first question I have to ask is what are you using to pay for fonts, as it could be possible the card (I assume) you're using may only work in Sweden. The only other thing that immediately sprang to mind was the The Pirate Bay is 'of Swedish origin' and so maybe the owners of 'LHF' are taking some moral position about that - a stretch maybe, but you never can tell...

		<div class="commentbody">Thanx for the answers, but I cant even create an account there.
Thats when I got the "We don’t accept orders from Sweden" when I asked why.

So yeah, seeing em working hard against piracy I dont see how this will help em. If they stop certain costumers for being honest and buy from them, the only way is.... piracy.
I dont want to see that happen.

Thanx again :)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Henrik,

A few of them (5) are sold at MyFonts; http://new.myfonts.com/search/LHF/fonts/

I had a quick look at Letterheads website, and I have to admit it's a bit odd why they just sell their typefaces to certain countries;
United States, Germany, Australia, Ireland, Austria, Japan, Belgium,	Netherlands, Canada, New Zealand, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Spain, France and United Kingdom. So all the other ones are not good enough???

I fully respect and agree with his piracy policy etc, but it's not good publicity if they are hard to find. There should be no problem to buy typefaces from smaller or bigger foundries/vendors.

I suggest you send them a nice e-mail again and ask why they don't ship to Sweden.

Good luck.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">a bit of a weird policy from LHF I'd say...when people can't buy them they just get it some other way, meaning people will just download them, i feel LHF is kind of pushing potential clients to download fonts illegally.

kind of reminds me of the Microsoft policy, Microsoft doesn't do business with certain country's, yet 90% of pc users is on windows over there, how do you think they got it?</div>

I did send them a letter asking why and if they could offer me an alternative. They havent responded to that. It was some days ago.
I would look for other fonts, but they do have those that match my designs perfectly... sadly :p

Hope I can find someone who can sell some "second hand" :)</div>
