body: "When drawing the outline of a glyph where the stroke changes from straight
  to curved, how should the points align?  As an example, consider the points A and
  B in the P shown below.  Should they be horizontally  aligned?  If not, should the
  inner or outer point be closer to the curved part?  How much? \r\n\r\nThanks for
  any insights!  It seems this issue arises in several characters, most notably U,
  but also B,D,P,R, and a bunch of lowercase letters.\r\n\r\nI have also posted a
  pdf for closer examination that shows the points defining the outline of the P.\r\n\r\nBest

    are satisfied with relation between the outer and the inner curves. To avoid sudden
    jerks, sometime you need to add extra nodes, and sometime you need to remove.
    Since I don't see any diagonal stress in your letter P - I guess the current nodes
    alignment is fine. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "If your glyphs have stress, think about the angle of the pen that creates
    that stress. That will inform the angle between the inner and outer contours.\r\n\r\nYou
    get different effects by moving the inner nodes in and out in relation to the
    outer bcp. It's not always very noticeable and the only way really is to try both
    ways and see how it looks. I think a geometric face would generally have the nodes
    aligned on a glyph like this, but as yours looks more neo-grotesque (wider), I'd
    try pulling the outer contour including the A point (and the corresponding one
    on the base of the bowl) inwards a little, towards the stem a few units.\r\n\r\nOn
    a tangent, how about removing the intermediate points with the diagonal bcps?"

    think about the angle of the pen that creates that stress. That will inform the
    angle between the inner and outer contours.</cite>\r\n\r\nSo suppose I'm using
    a pen tilted at a 45 degree angle (so that the bottom leg of the K is thick and
    the top arm is thin)--in that case, A would be to the right of B, and the top
    of the bottom of the bowl would be to the right of the bottom, correct?\r\n\r\n<cite>as

    that grotesques would have a different alignment than geometrics!  I will try
    your suggestion and post the results tomorrow.  I looked at Arial (with quadratic
    curves) and the points are aligned as you suggest.  However, I also looked at
    URW Nimbus Sans (a Helvetica clone with cubic curves), and the inner points are
    closer to the stem.  Might the order of the curves affect which alignment to use?\r\n\r\n<cite>how
    about removing the intermediate points with the diagonal bcps?</cite>\r\n\r\nThe
    intermediate points are there to ensure continuous curvature, particularly at
    the join from curved to straight.  I found that I could not get a smooth enough
    transition otherwise.  I'll try to post a plot of the curvature tomorrow that
    shows the smoothness.\r\n\r\nThe issue of the alignment arose because I was considering
    how to get smooth transitions from straight to curved.  I think I now understand
    how to do that with an individual curve, but I still have some difficulty with
    the outline of a stroke transitioning from a straight segment to a curve.\r\n\r\nBest

    really depends a lot on the philosophy of the font you're making. And judging
    from that \"P\", this doesn't look like a very calligraphically-inspired font\u2026
    So why imagine an imaginary pen making imaginary strokes and then emulate those
    with digital tools? ;-)  It should be a lot more interesting and beneficial, like
    you've already done, to look at more existing fonts and study how they deal with
    the relative node placement. And of course, play! Make variants, try different
    solutions, put them side by side.\r\n\r\nAnd I agree with Ben about using as few
    points as possible for as long as possible. Adding more points is actually more
    likely to make your curves *more* bumpy. \r\nAs far as I understand, it's only
    on rather exotic occurrences that you should consider using intermediate (non-extremum)
    points \u2013 but certainly not in a \"normal\" sans serif \"P\".\r\n\r\n<cite>\"I
    still have some difficulty with the outline of a stroke transitioning from a straight
    segment to a curve.\"</cite>\r\nWhat editor are you using? Knowing that would
    make it easier to give practical advice."

    the statement with 'If your glyphs have stress'. But of course it depends on whether
    your stress is chirographic (oh no, let's not get into <cite>that</cite>). \r\n\r\nNina's
    right: play! Just see how different positioning affects the contours.\r\n\r\n>Interesting
    that grotesques would have a different alignment than geometrics\r\nI was speculating
    there. Geometrics are based on circles and rectangles; grotesques can afford more
    rhythm. \r\n\r\nI think the key is for straight-curved transitions to be as smooth
    as possible, which may mean taking the nodes inward toward the straight section,
    whilst keeping the bcps fixed. Or at least that's my experience.\r\n\r\n>Might
    the order of the curves affect which alignment to use?\r\nI don't know, but I
    doubt it. The order of the curves shouldn't have much to do with the position
    of nodes, just what happens between them."

    around the contour.  The plot shows curvature on the y axis and arc length on
    the x axis (units are em units).  The straight line segments have curvature zero,
    and the curves have positive curvature, indicating that they curve to the left.\r\n\r\nThe
    point B is at about arc length 840.  Note that the curvature is continuous here;
    this occurs because the point B and the two off-curve control points are collinear.\r\n\r\nThe
