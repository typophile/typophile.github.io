  GILDA, the famous movie poster from the 50s, I believe.\r\n\r\nI am including the
  movie poster here. It would be great if you can help.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.moviegoods.com/movie_poster/gilda_1946.htm\r\nhttp://www.laartwork.com/product/XGLILDA_ART/Gilda_Rita_Hayworth_Canvas_Movie_Poster.html\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nMabel\r\nhaikufilmsorg@Yahoo.com"

  body: With a little tweaking you could use <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typadelic/sweetheart-script/">Sweetheart
    Script</a> from Typadelic. You could also use <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/onyx-mt/">Onyx</a>
    for the serif. Note that the entire thing was handlettered though.
