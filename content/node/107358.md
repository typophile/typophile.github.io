  uppermost catch-line of [[http://retrosynthads.blogspot.no/2012/07/aries-music-inc-modular-synthesizer-ad.html|this
  advertisment]] from 1977 (\"It's syn-ful!\") ... and also in the company name seen
  on the cover of [[http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ngYaWa_2l0I/UNXvhFcNQcI/AAAAAAAGJlg/FozrXQEBk8M/s1600/%2524%2528KGrHqV%252C%2521rUFCN-VW9CFBQ1eF%25295qyw%257E%257E60_57.JPG|their
  1977 catalogue]].\r\n\r\nA digital version of this face called \"Upperville\" was
  published by Bay Fonts in the early 90's, but this was an absolute travesty of digitzation,
  mostly likely an autotrace and with many forms different to the few printed samples
  I've seen. I am looking for more original printed samples, preferably the full set
  of glyphs, and the only way I will be able to do this is to know the original typface
  name. Knowing the designer/foundry will also help me to track down the copyright
  holder and to understand if that is still current."

    better made than an autotrace.\r\nhttp://luc.devroye.org/corelequivalences.html\r\nAt

  body: "Note in \"ARIES MUSIC\" that S in MUSIC matches Uptight/Uptown while S in
    ARIES is different. This suggests to me that R, M and C may also be modifications.
    The font has the elements for the R. Merely mirror the 9 and do a little editing
    for the leg. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/UptightUptownRmodified_4613.jpg]\r\nM,
    C and S are even easier to modify.\r\nDon"

    the inner stroke into a taper to match the other letters, mirror and use both
    original and mirror and this is what you get:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/UptightUptownMmodified_3582.jpg]\r\nAs
    I mentioned in an earlier post, I suspect that these letters are not in the original

  body: "With the assistance of fvilanakis's list, and Don's identification of ITC
    Uptight I've managed to locate some possible print sources of the original.\r\n\r\nI
    also now see that this request has been posted here before: [[http://typophile.com/node/47014]]\r\n\r\nI
    doubt whether a synthesizer company would be creating their own custom letters
    for a few print ads, and indeed the previous identifier, Mark Simonson, states
    that ITC Uptight Regular (as opposed to Neon) did indeed have several alternate
    letterforms which have been used in the samples I have posted here. Most modern
    sources such as Rookledge's Classic International Typefinder list only ITC Uptight
    Neon, not Uptight Regular. But at least now I have what I need. Thanks all!"
