  this is klimax. it is part of my diploma project with two other display fonts ([[http://www.typophile.com/node/44981|Monoxil
  Outliner]] & Kakao).\r\nthe idea was to draw two opposite climaxes - the heaviest
  and the lightest, but both sharing the identical metrics and kerning.\r\ni would
  really appreciate some feedback and critique.\r\n\r\nthank you. ondrej\r\n"

    strokes on the Ultra weights are a bit too thin. Take \"National\", in the upper
    left corner, for example. The counter strokes practically dissolve away. \r\n\r\nI
    like the look and I think thickening the counter strokes a little wouldn't have
    too negative effect on the over all look.  "

  body: "After looking at the PDF, something about the capital C, G, Q and O seem
    off, like they're compressed. I also don't like the length of the counter strokes
    on the capital E, 4, 5, they're too long. Actually, some of your counter stroke
    lengths seem inconsistent, and long. Such as on the U, V and W.\r\n\r\nHope I'm
    not being too nit-picky."

  body: One more suggestion, and then I'm done, how bout adding a rounded end to the
    counter strokes instead of a straight one? It'll soften the forms slightly; as
    if a laser cut into them.

  body: I actually kind of enjoy the "ultra-black" looking like they have no counter,
    but I do agree that the counters are waaay to thin if you are to keep them there.
    I think that even tripling the counters in size wouldn't be too much. I enjoy
    the ultra-light weight, the R reminds me of gotham, and the eyeglass g is great.
    I agree with stephen about the bowl of the a

  body: While I like the black version alot, I agree about the counters. I think the
    concept and idea are great, but what about making another black, next to this
    one, with a bit more 'normal' counters? The light version is excellent, though.

  body: "hello.\r\n\r\nasvetic: i'll check the C, Q, G, O and U, V, W letters. i tried
    make the white strokes of E shorter, but it looked too much out of concept. the
    only exception is S where long strokes look super bad. the first version had rounded
    counter strokes and i can't recall why i decided to make them straight actually...
    maybe i wanted them only to show the inner construction, not to play part of real
    counters. that's why they are so thin too. \r\n\r\nstephen: yeah, i know the bowl
    of the a is smaller than usual, but i have this feeling that anything larger would
    be too ordinary in this case. people always complain about this in my fonts by
    the way... maybe i have do something with it :)\r\n\r\nthe others: the optical
    sizes seems to be a good idea. i will definitelly keep this version for big point
    sizes and design something more conform for smaller ones. the plus style with
    classic counters and the minus version with thicker strokes and maybe a bit of
    contrast too. however, this will have to wait because i still have two other fonts
    to draw... ah... this hard student's life...\r\n\r\nthank you all."

  body: I think the heavier weight is cut too deeply by the counter space as well.
    It doesn't seem quite right. My eyes want to see the thin line breaking the e,
    c, u, t to be MUCH shorter. Maybe that cut into the lc a should closely resemble
    what you've done to the S. I don't even think the p, h and r need them at all.

    the the lenght of the counters, but i think the rules i followed while designing
    them are clear. one explanation could be 'super heavy weight with super big contrast'
    which is best visible in the 'o'. this system, of course, is not possible to use
    with all letters, but the aesthetic effect which this system produces is quite
    interesting, i think.\r\nlater i will design the 'normal' version with counters
    as long and as regular as they should be :)"

    the counters in general (on the ultra-black). The beauty in such a fat weight
    all comes from the tension between how badly the strokes just want to crush the
    counters, and how hard the counters have to work to resist. \r\n\r\nI love the
    lowercase g, especially. The spine looks like a muffin top!"

  body: thanks. i am pretty proud of the lowercase k too... unfortunatelly, i had
    to break the rule of same width of minus and plus style. i had to add some kern
    pairs with k in the minus version, because the fat style is filled on the right
    side, while the minus style k is just regularly open... but i think it doesn't
    spoil the concept that much.

    It's not quite as extreme on the heavy side, but the lighter weight characters
    seemed to have a lot in common.
