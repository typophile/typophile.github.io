  for my BA degree in Graphic design currently. It will take the form of a book tackling
  the subject of minimalism, style and typography.\r\n\r\nCurrently I am contacting
  a number of designers for interviews to answer a short set of questions in regard
  to my topic. If anyone has any names for designers that might fit in well for my
  project that would be appreciated. Their geographic location is not really an issue,
  but London based or such might be a plus. Or if you are a designer who might fit
  my project and be up for an informal interview of some kind, please contact me,
  in thread or by email, hello at manhem dot net.\r\n\r\nI have been looking to contact
  Willi Kunz, (Author of Typography: Macro + Micro Aesthetics, and teacher of Typography
  at Ohio State University) but without any success of finding any contact details.
  If anyone knows how to get in contact with him, that would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nAny
  names or such would be much appreciated. :)\r\n\r\n-Gus"

    choice. Talk to him (or read <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Design-Kenya-Hara/dp/303778105X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1203180842&sr=8-1\">his

  body: "Ah that's great! More of this! \r\n\r\nKenya Hara seems to fit very good,
    thankyou James. Experimental jetset, the Dutch guys? They got contact details
    on their website, not very much recent work from what I could see but surely worth
    a try. \r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n-Gus"

  body: "Iv have collected a lot of material by now, Experimental Jetset has provided
    me with a good set of answers and plenty of material. Kenya Hara was \"too busy\"
    according to his assistant. \r\n\r\nOther people that have provided me with good
    answers and visual material for my book are people such as,\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\nAlan
    Kitching\r\nArnold Schwartzman\r\nFritz Gottschalk\r\nHelmut Schmidt\r\nMagret
    Calvert\r\nMervyn Kurlansky\r\nSandra Praun\r\nSteven Heller\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nStill
    waiting for replies from a number of people! And always looking for more! Anybody
    have any further suggestions? Or would you like to nominate yourself for a place
    in my book?"
