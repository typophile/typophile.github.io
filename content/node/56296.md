  body: "What exactly is this? Is it a landscaping service? I think the concept is
    promising either way.\r\n\r\nYou need to give the tree a little more detail. Add
    branches where the trunk ends and the leaves start and maybe don't have the tree
    all blacked out. That forces you to notice the outer shape that resembles broccoli.
    Have a few 'holes' in between the leaves here and there. Also, add length to the
    trunk...that will help too.\r\n\r\nHave you tried anything else besides a wrench?
    I think it works to a degree, but I get more of a 'handyman' feel from it.\r\n\r\nJonE."

    the mark.\r\nnature and tools = management?\r\n\r\nthe execution isn't very strong
    either.\r\nthe wrench isn't really working at the moment and yes ... the tree
    does look like a head of broccoli.\r\n\r\nI think you need to re-evaluate the
    core/primary  focus of the business ... land? trees? management? tools?\r\n<br

  body: Also you might want to try making the wrench head in the negative space on
    the treetop.

  body: "I agree with the others. You need a bit more detail with the tree part (let
    open spaces 'shine through' the branches). The wrench part could use a tad more
    detail too. \r\n\r\nThere's also the size issue. Technically, the root system
    of a tree roughly equates to the branch system. As such, I think the wrench part
    could be quite a bit larger to balance out the tree. "
