    No it's not. It's close to Gotham... It's something else that someone else will
    probably find before I return with the answer...\r\n\r\nEdit II: big shiny buttons:
    <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/avenir/\">Avenir</a>. The logo may
    or not be a customized <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/exljbris/museo-sans/\">Museo
    Sans</a> or a hybrid of all three. [?]"
