  know how the values in InDesign tracking and the FL's 'Adjust metrics' are related.\r\n\r\nAre
  InDesign values (5, 10, 25, 50...) percents? If I increase spacing in FL by percent
  will I get similar results?\r\n\r\nThanks in advace.\r\n\r\nR."

  body: "Yes, you will get the same results. Both applications work in 1/1000 of an
    em (not percent).\r\nRemember that in FL you need exactly half the value since
    you typically change both sidebearings."

  body: "Tim, that's not completely accurate: FontLan works in whatever the UPM of
    the individual font is, which is 1000 in most PostScript fonts, but may be any
    value in TTF or OpenType (including PS OpenType). 2048 is used in many TT fonts,
    because it is a power of 2 and thise provides very slightly faster processing
    times during scaling. Some companies settle on a standard UPM to use in all their
    fonts, many opting for 1000 since it gives them easy compatibility if they are
    making both Type 1 and TTF. But since I don't make Type 1 any more, and I tend
    to tailor the UPM to the particular typeface or the writing system I'm working
    with. Some styles of lettering and some scripts benefit from a higher UPM, which
    can express greater detail.\r\n\r\nInDesign's tracking units are, as you say 1/1000th
    of an em.\r\n\r\nFontLab's units are 1/UPM. So if the UPM of the font is not 1000,
    you need to adjust your FontLab units accordingly to match the InDesign tracking."
