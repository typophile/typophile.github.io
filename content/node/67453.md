  body: "<cite>...Clarendon.</cite>\r\n\r\nRobert Bringhurst recommends <em>Haas</em>
    Clarendon, rather.\r\n\r\nYou will find a match in Linotype Clarendon (designed
    by Hermann Eidenbenz in 1953), but better still is David Berlow's [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Belizio|Belizio]]."

    am looking for a nice face to match with Helvetica to. Finding it tough but i
    quite like this idea, could work well for body text. The price ain't to shabby
    either.\r\n\r\nHope this is useful."
