  Forum this summer where we will discuss what might comprise a post-graduate degree
  program in typography here in the U.S. \r\nPlease look over the list below and respond
  by identifying any areas which you have been educated in, have had training in,
  or have investigated on your own in order to further your typographic work.\r\n\r\nThis
  survey is meant for anyone who considers that typography is central to their main
  line of work. You do not have to be a type designer. Also, feel free to add any
  areas you think have been overlooked. My objective is to learn what kind of backgrounds
  those who are currently working in the field have. \r\n\r\nThank you for taking
  the time to respond. This information will have a direct effect on the panel discussion
  planned for TypeCon in Los Angeles, and the more responses, the more meaningful
  the data.\r\n\r\nJuliet Shen\r\n\r\nLatin font design\r\nNon-latin font design\r\n\r\nHistory

    studying in grad school at Ohio State and we had a very firm education at Carnegie
    Mellon University where we studied calligraphy and typesetting. We had great guest
    lecturers like Herman Zapf and Wolfgang Weingart; Semiotics from Gui Bonnsieppe
    and Martin Krampen; Typography from Jack Staufagher and Ken Hiebert.\r\n\r\nDigital
    Font Production, Latin Script Font Design, Hinting and Programming was all self
    taught. I did take a weekend class from Maxim Zukov on Cyrillic though (which
    was fabulous!). I am self-taught in Greek, however but I spoke Greek as a child
    so it is not so foreign to me."

    - This was covered for half of the semester of type design\L, I am horrific at

    printing (letterpress, printmaking) - I was taught letterpress over two weekends

    much as the students did from that program.\r\n\r\nGraphic Design - My school
    covered this in great detail, but more was learned from the first 4 years of actual
    work. School got me in the right mind and taught me how to think, but I didn't
    learn until I was on my own.\r\n\r\n\LInformation Design - I had a semester long

    Oh no, please, please, let's hear about your childhood.\r\n\r\nVery well, where
    do I begin? My father was a relentlessly self-improving boulangerie owner from
    Belgium with low grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery. My mother was a
    fifteen year old French prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet. My father would
    womanize, he would drink, he would make outrageous claims like he invented the
    question mark. Some times he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy, the sort of
    general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament. My childhood
    was typical, summers in Rangoon, luge lessons. In the spring we'd make meat helmets.
    When I was insolent I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds, pretty
    standard really. At the age of 12 I received my first scribe. At the age of fourteen,
    a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically shaved my testicles. There really is
    nothing like a shorn scrotum, it's breathtaking, I suggest you try it.\r\n\r\nTherapist:

    my academic background is as a historian.  In college I wasn't even aware that
    there was such a thing as a college course in typography.  So I went to college
    and then graduate school in medieval history and English/linguistics.  Along the
    way I took courses in typesetting (compugraphic) outside of college and interned
    at Applewood Press where I learned to set wood and metal type and do basic book
    design.  In graduate school I also took courses in Paleography and Codicology
    and my fist typeface designs came from work I did in my Paleography classes.  I've
    also worked as an editor and art director, which gave me more experience working
    with type.  Through the 80s I found myself doing a lot of hand lettering for book
    and magazine titles, and that naturally transitioned into designing type once
    the digital tools became available.  The rest is history...\r\n\r\nDave\r\n<a

    For example, I think there could be a linguistics course tailored to typographers

    linguists (which certainly would bring the whole question of pre-reqs into play).
    What I'm hearing is that almost everyone involved in typography today has taught

    and one which probably has nothing to do with linguistic courses that are actually
    taught. Linguistics programmes cover a broad range of topics, but it is rare enough
    to find courses that merely deal with writing systems at all. Mainstream linguistics
    is mostly about identifying language universals these days (generative grammar
    and such); old-school linguistics was heavy on philology.\r\n\r\nWhy would anyone
    need to become a linguist to design for languages they don't speak? Do you mean
    for users of different languages but the same alphabet, like English speakers
    designing for Czech or Finnish? Or do you mean designing different scripts than
    one's own, like Devanagari or Chinese characters? In either case, one could learn
    the different design rules, and one could actually learn the languages themselves,
    but that is different from becoming a linguist. People might say \"linguist\"
    when they mean \"polyglot\", but that is careless usage.\r\n\r\nI have a feeling
    you might simply be referring to language courses. One could imagine a course
    for just teaching the Arabic script, not the spoken language. Is that what you

    skills would make for a pretty powerful combination.</cite>\r\n\r\nWhen I worked
    as a magazine art director, I became a very good editor since there was always
    an instance where a paragraph needed to be edited to improve the rag or lose a
    widow. I learned very quickly that if you brought the problem to the editor and
    asked them to re-write it, they would either refuse or have you wait. So I would
    re-write the problem passage and then show it to the editor for an ok. I alway
    got the ok."

    age.\r\n\r\nDiscovered drums at age 10, forgot about sketching; maintained a passive
    interest in letters.\r\n\r\nIn high school, I realized I could do \"cool things
    with fonts\" in Microsoft Word.\r\n\r\nMajored in music in college, where I got
    to play Carnegie Hall, study music in India, and won a jazz award in Chicago and
    two DownBeat awards as a participant in the best recorded orchestral music category.
    Spent the majority of my non-academic time experimenting with Photoshop.\r\n\r\nBrief
    career in music, growing interest and knowledge about type. Taught myself InDesign
    and Illy.\r\n\r\nStarted spending so much time with Adobe products (and getting
    good at them) I decided to try to make money using them.\r\n\r\nDiscovered that
    \"typography\" as a craft exists as a focus in the field of graphic design. Slowly
    honed/honing skills in type and design.\r\n\r\nFull-time career in design (print
    and web), no longer playing music (actively).\r\n\r\nMy family doesn't understand
    me anymore.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the background survey, perhaps a <em>psychological</em>
    study of typographers and typophiles may be appropriate."

    who don't know what a serif is, and some who are capable of conducting graduate
    level research combining cognitive psychology and typography right down to data
    analysis. An <strong>extremely</strong> broad spectrum."

    non-profit. Every academic semester we get lots of applicants for undergraduate
    intern positions. I have the fortune of being able to select the best one or two
    applicants for each semester. Yet, with a couple shining-star exceptions, many
    of these design students don't know a <em>thing</em> about setting type (and almost
    <em>nothing at all</em> about printing; I have had to thoroughly explain and demonstrate
    the concept of \"bleed\" to every intern I've ever had here. Oh, right\u2014type!
    I think I let my undergraduate program frustrations get the better of me...)\r\n\r\nSo,
    yes, I echo your thoughts about undergrad pedagogy and hope that, if any such
    survey exists, professors take heed!"

    is neglected in undergraduate design programs. However, when I have succeeded
    in getting a student to really get into type, there was no masters level program
    for them to go into in the U.S., and not all students can afford to go abroad.
    Since this node is now buried in the site, if anyone wants to respond to the survey
    later, please contact me directly at juliet@shendesign.com\r\n\r\nThanks."
