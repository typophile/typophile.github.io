    Sans]] is very faithful to the inscription, but I don't know if you can really
    qualify it as \"sans\". [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/tipo-pepel/trajana-sans/|Trajana
    Sans]] may be what you're looking for. I must say the charm of the subtle modulation
    of the roman inscription gets lost in the latter.\r\n\r\nAlso see [[http://typophile.com/node/61034]]."

    but Throhand - Pen Sans,  that doesn't exist... and Throhand - Pen Dragon, but
