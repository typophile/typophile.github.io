  Modern Family logo. Really I just love the way the sans and serif fonts seem to
  go together so well, so if anyone has any other suggestions for unpretentious, readable,
  sleek pairings like this, I'd take those as well. I just like this effect very much!\r\n\r\nThank
  you all in advance, this forum has been a lifesaver for a type-illiterate person
  like myself.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/brand_6083.gif]"

  body: "I think Jan has probably answered the font question. As for other pairings,
    I think the goal would be to (probably) find similar weights, but dissimilar styles.
    So this means, for example, don't use a mix from a superfamily that has both serif
    and sans versions of the same font. \r\n\r\nMaybe experiment with varying the
    weights too, now that I think of it. Might be more interesting than keeping the
    same weights. Anyway, I think it's been done many times, but it can be fun mixing
    unexpected combinations.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Thank you so much, Jan! Right after I posted I realized the reason the first
    looked so familiary was that it was Helvetica, but I never would have recognized
    Didot.\r\n\r\nAnd thank you, Mike, for the advice. I am going to start experimenting
    right now!"

  body: Also, look for similar skeleton structures! Are the round shapes oval, or
    circular? How open are the counters? How high does the n curve start on the left
    stem? Is the x height vs cap height similar enough? Similarities in width proportions.
    All of these does not have to match, but they must harmonize somehow.

  body: "modernfamily feels much like an homage to Vignelli's Bodoni/Helvetica juxtapositions
    for IDCNY (down to the warm red).\r\nOf more recent vintage, the \"holdeverything\"
    logo attempted a Helvetica/Bodoni combo, but the x heights were not as well matched.\r\n\r\nHappy
    hunting!\r\n\r\n"
