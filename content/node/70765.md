  Jones logo, seen at the top of their home page:\r\nhttp://www.ernestjones.co.uk/\r\n\r\nLooking
  for that, or if not precisely that, a very similar slim, elegant sans serif. \r\n\r\nAlso,
  in the left hand side menu, there is 'Gift Finder', and 'Find the perfect gift'...
  what typeface are they in - is it just a bolder/more condensed version of the logo
  typeface, or is it something else entirely?\r\n\r\nAny help much appreciated!"
