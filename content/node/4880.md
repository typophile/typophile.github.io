body: Is there any good tutorial teaching how to adjust pixel fonts to optimize their
  appearence in Flash? I made a pixel font using Fontographer and made the final adjustments
  that Atomic Media`s tutorial teachs &#40;change weight by 5 em units&#41;. The font
  resulted a little blurred in Flash, like a &#34;semi-pixel&#34; font. Thank you!

    first is more general, the second is a tutorial using FOG. Both cover Flash issues
    and optimization.'
