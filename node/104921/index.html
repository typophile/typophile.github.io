  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">dear typophiles,
i write my ‘reading dissertation’ about hebrew secondary styles. now i am looking for hebrew type designs that create a set of styles (through structural change and within the same weight). i know about ismar david’s david (and linotype’s david hadash), henri friedlaender’s (unreleased) attempt of hadassah cursive and ben nathan’s days and nights. does one of you happen to know other examples / attempts that try to create a complementing style for highlighting within texts for continuous reading ?
many thanks in advance, nicole</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>hi mike, here are the examples i was talking about:</p>
<p>hadassah cursive (henri friedlaender): it wasn’t produced in the end because after the test that is shown in the picture below, henri friedlaender realized that there would need to be fundamental changes, such as a change of the whole rhythm. this would have been too much work and so, only the regular and the semibold were produced. (that’s roughly what he writes about it)

days and nights (ben nathan): <a href="http://www.hafontia.com/portfolio/">http://www.hafontia.com/portfolio/</a></p>
<p>william, thanks for mentioning masterfont, i will have another look at their catalogue ! (but it is right that the masterfont’s narkisim is masterfont’s interpretation and not zvi narkis’s narkisim?)
you were right that i am looking for more than oblique versions as i want to know how the inner structure of hebrew letters can change in a way that can be compared to the differences between a regular and a cursive style for the latin script (fluency, dynamic of strokes, change of terminals, etc.).</p>

This is a most interesting thread!
I was pleased to read (or rather to begin to read) your thesis which deserves study.
Thanks for the link to font Days and Nights which points out the value of ligatures
in Hebrew apart from the nearly useless alef/lamed. For instance, the bet vav ligature see
<a href="http://www.hafontia.com/portfolio/lig.gif">http://www.hafontia.com/portfolio/lig.gif</a>  from Days and Nights
in the Ben Natan portfolio.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>william,
yes, i know about the hebrew cursive (what i didn’t know was that it’s called ktav yad – thanks ;-). 
i actually designed a text typeface that consists of three styles – an upright (hebrew square script), a cursive (like david’s cursive) and a script (like the handwritten shapes) – for both latin and hebrew script.(<a href="http://www.typefacedesign.org/resources/A5specimen/2010/NicoleFally_MissInformed_specimen.pdf">http://www.typefacedesign.org/resources/A5specimen/2010/NicoleFally_MissInformed_specimen.pdf</a>)
so i am particularly looking for text types. i know only one example where the hebrew cursive was designed as a secondary style. it is from another reading student and was designed a couple of years ago. unfortunately, i don’t know her name yet and only have this low quality photograph.
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DSC03461_typophile_5680.jpg]</p>
<p>you write, the hebrew cursive has its own tradition. do you know where its shapes come from ? i could hardly find information about its origin. stephen lubell writes, ‘The cursive script has been in daily use for several centuries amongst various Jewish populations and continues to be used in modern Israel. In contemporary Israeli display typography and lettering for advertisements, the cursive script has come to be used as an element of graphic differentiation, due to its distinctive forms and calligraphic feel.’ (The Hebrew Typeface Designs of Zvi Narkis)
but that’s more or less all i could find about it.</p>
<p>michel,
thanks for the link and the example !
i think, the rashi script is a possible variation. as far as i know, it was and is closely connected to religious usage and evokes religious associations. that’s why i didn’t consider it to be an option for the design of a style that is included in a text typeface that should be ‘neutral’. i might be wrong with that assumption !?</p>
<p>mike,
thanks ! 
i like these ligatures too and hadn’t yet seen them.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Nicole, when I look at the various font shapes of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Culmus Project<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I see nothing indeed that resembles Rashi (that is not even available as a postscript font in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->CTAN makor fonts directory<!-- raw HTML omitted -->; all you can get there is the metafont sources).  Those shapes date from the 12th century. More recent shapes were first considered by Ben Nathan and discarded. They nevertheless belong to the history of Hebrew complementary typefaces.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nicole,
 The script form in your post from 29 Jul 2013 is a variant of Ashkenazi cursive. The other form of importance would be Sephardi cursive; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cursive_Hebrew">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cursive_Hebrew</a> has a decent chart (from the 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia). I don’t know how widely used actual Sephardi cursive is outside its (declining) use for Ladino, but “Rashi script” (A.K.A. Rabbinic cursive) is a variant in use.

		<div class="commentbody">After reading the first lines of the Makor Rashi metafont files that say that they were obtained from a True Type format using TTF2MF (those lines were written by TTF2MF), I searched the web and finally found a font with a copyright dated 1992 from Aaron D. Schmiedel that is identical to the regular. I guess the other .mf files come from the same source.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The italic fonts for Latin seem to be designed in such a way that a single word, phrase or sentence in a page of regular may be instantly seen and stands out distinctly on the page.  This is not the same as &lsquo;emphasis&rsquo; for which bold might do better.  Indeed the italic is often lighter on the page but is still very apparent.</p>
<p>The image above with ktav yad amidst regular Hebrew text doesn&rsquo;t acheive this.</p>
<p>I just looked at a few Hebrew novels and found on pages of (I suppose) Frank Ruel, some sentences in the same typeface but inclined.  To my inexperienced eye, this did not look satisfactory.
