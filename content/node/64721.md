  body: Looks like an "off" version of <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/kabel/?testdrive=dock%3Dfalse%26size%3D124%26w%3D720%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3DBINGO35%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dot.liga%26seed%3D19">Kabel
    Black</a>. Some of the less popular metal sans serif faces had alternate characters
    to allow them to "pass" as Kabel. This may be one of those.

    digital version of this, unfortunately.'

  body: Perhaps, but I feel that I've seen some of the un-Kabel-like characters ('G'
    & '2') before. Does anyone recognize the non-Kabel characters here?

  body: Sorry, cross-posted. Yes, I think you are right. An alternate 'G' as well?

  body: "No, it's definitely Tempo. (My \"redacted\" comment referred to something
    I posted and withdrew. Sorry for any confusion.)\r\n\r\nHere's what Tempo Heavy
    looks like:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tempoheavy_3524.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
    alternate \"N\" is in the bottom row."

  body: By the way, not all the specimen books I have show the same "G". Not sure
    why this is. They are all presented as samples of Ludlow Tempo, and no one else
    produced it (knock off or otherwise).
