    the shape of the C? It\u2019s the unusual n?\r\nSo that it will be possible to
    point to typefaces with similar features."

  body: "Reno, Please use a more descriptive title for your posts in the future, so
    we can find them again among all the threads. Also, the second sample you posted
    was much more helpful, as you saw from Toby's quick ID. More letters are always
    better.\r\n\r\nWelcome to Typophile!\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
