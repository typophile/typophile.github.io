body: I stumbled across the Jonathan Hoefler course Intro. to Type Design 110, on
  this website. <BR> <BR>During the course he mentions the proportions as relating
  to ONE BY TWO RECTANGLES. Is there a specific type of paper to design type on during
  the design process? <BR> <BR>Let me know and I will get practising!  <BR> <BR>I
  feel I am disturbed enough to attempt my own type. <BR> <BR>take care

  body: 'This has been covered in these forums before &#40;do a search&#41;. <BR>But
    to summarize, materials and methods are largely a matter of personal taste. The
    only requirement I would set on paper is that it be somewhat see through &#40;translucent&#41;.
    That way you can compare letterforms, quickly revise them etc. Some people like
    a grid, others not. <BR> <BR>My preference is Bienfang&#39;s Graphics 360. Great
    with pen &#40;no bleed through or spread&#41;, and pencil. The opacity is nice
    too. It isn&#39;t so thin like tissue that it rips and smudges when you erase
    and you can easily see your new line &#40;ie it&#39;s not overpowered by the one
    underneath&#41;. If I want a grid, I drop a sheet of grid behind it. <BR> <BR>Have
    fun!  '
