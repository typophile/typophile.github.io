body: "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nA while ago I mentioned a little book I designed for an MA
  project on the history of writing. Here is the finished thing (which unfortunately
  I could not complete in time for the final assessment). The idea, originally, was
  to design a map to guide type designers through the British Museum to every piece
  of writing in order for them to get inspiration for typefaces based on historical
  records. To get it into context:\r\n\r\nThe project was about the evolution of writing
  from the very beginnings up until the present days. I mapped the location and characteristics
  of all the pieces in the British Museum (the ones I could find) that had some for
  of writing on them. Once I had all the information, I produced a catalogue, which
  showed the location, characteristics (origin, description of the subject, classification
  of the object itself, etc) and chronological order. These lists were then divided
  accordingly in different scripts. The end result was a 20 chapter book listing all
  the pieces in the Museum, their location and characteristics and a brief introduction
  to show the reader how every script works/ed (how the characters evolved, where
  they came from, the culture they developed from, etc.)\r\n\r\nOk, enough rambling.\r\n\r\nAfter
  the MA, I went back to the British Museum to see what I had learned and went to
  visit my favourite pieces, copying one character from each. I had LOTS of favourites,
  but limited myself to five for reasons I won't go into.\r\n\r\nHope you like it:"

  body: "My pleasure guys, sadly it looks better once it's printed. I had it done
    in an off-white, slightly textured paper, hand bound, and I used a dark red thicker
    card for the cover, with gold stamps.\r\n\r\nObviously, if you go to (are in)
    London, take it to the British Museum and look for the pieces themselves, as nothing
    compares to the real things. Also, a trip to the Roman and Greek inscriptions
    is well worth it!"

  body: "I enjoyed reading your booklet; and I'm glad that someone else out there
    likes \"The Triumphant Arch\"!\r\n\r\nThe remainder of your project must have
    taken an impressive amount of effort. Pretty much every object in the museum has
    writing on it in one form or another and some of it is quite obscure (the deliberately
    antiquated cuneiform particularly comes to mind)!\r\n\r\n-Jacob "

  body: "I think the Arch is my favorite piece, just because of the beautiful letters!\r\n\r\nAnd
    yeah, Cuneiform and Hieroglyphs were especially extensive. Although there are
    LOTS of objects with writing on them in the Museum, there are some rooms without
    a single one (a nice surprise while I was cataloguing) and some rooms were closed
    for refurbishment during the project, so I had to skip those, luckily."

  body: "An interesting project. I have one picky comment/question about your typesetting.
    All of the f-ligatures in your text look like long s-ligatures were employed instead.
    \r\n\r\nOne particularly extreme example is the beginning of the 'o' entry:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sisteenth_6162.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis
    says \"sisteenth,\" not fifteenth.\r\n\r\nI'm quite curious; I just judged a book
    show and there was one entry that also had this strange behavior (also Adobe Caslon),
    and I was just wondering: How does something like this happen?!\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hmmm...interesting. I can only say it was human error\u2026 I guess I did
    not pay as much attention to it as I should have; for most ligatures I used the
    alternates, which worked fine for the \"ct\" and \"st\" ligatures, but the \"fi\"
    one should appear on its own; not sure about the \"ft\". Great eye for detail
    Kent! I'll fix right away.\r\n\r\nCheers!"
