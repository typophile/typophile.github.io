  I remember being on a foundry's site that had a face very similar to this: [[http://fuzzco.com/wp-content/themes/fuzzco/flashes/blogs.swf]]
  \r\n\r\nAlso on the foundry's site I remember recognizing a few typefaces that were
  on ffffound quite frequently 6 months or so ago. Perhaps popular with the whole
  3dphotshop type stuff. \r\n\r\nAny hints appreciated!"

  body: "I still think this is a sort of constructed grid lettering, using the dots
    like pegs to attach either vertical, horizontal, or diagonal transparent bars.
    There are two sizes of bars. That's it. Not a font, I think.\r\n\r\nMost similar
    font idea is LED-style fonts that use fixed elements to create crude letterforms.
    See [[http://www.dafont.com/led-real.font?nb_ppp=50&text=BLOG|LED Real]], as an
    example.\r\n\r\n[edit: I am not saying this is fabricated lettering, but I thinks
    it's a graphic image made to look like plastic pieces assembled to make letters]

  body: "well, thanks for the input fellas. I'm likewise pretty sure this isn't a
    font. I've really been trying hard to find a foundry's site that makes typefaces
    similar to the posted. \r\n\r\nI hate losing sites! Arrrrgh\r\n\r\nH "

  body: "David, you're right, there are three sizes. It could have been done with
    two, since the pegs seems evenly spaced, but they did use one long, instead of
    two short ones. Seems like it would make a neat child's toy to experiment with
    squared letterforms.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    U.S. the Erector Set kits were similar. I had one as a kid.\r\n\r\nI was thinking
    of just a simple board with pegs and two or three sizes of clear plastic connectors
    to make letters and shape outlines. Seems like someone must have made something
    like it.\r\n\r\n- Mike"
