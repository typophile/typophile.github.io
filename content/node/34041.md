body: Hi,  I'm looking to find this typeface or something similar.  I've illustrated
  a children's book and would like something like this for the title.  If you know
  of other fonts for the body text that would work with this font I would appreciate
  the help.  Thanks.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/type_5038.jpg]

    You can look up where any of them come from in the accompanying Script Font Reference

    goes well with the art now. I can't put the illustrations on the web until the
