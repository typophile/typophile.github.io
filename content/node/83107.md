  \ The font has been manipulated a little as it was pulled from another jpeg, so
  there is a little loss of edges.\r\n\r\nMostly looking for font for the \"Catalan\"
  text.\r\n\r\nAppreciate any help you might be able to offer!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nBob"

    farm\" text is not representative of the original, it was manipulated, but your
    guess would be spot on if it hadn't been.\r\n\r\n-Bob"
