  in illustrater. however now I have created a complete font in illustrater in a grid
  with gridlines every 8 mm and 16 subdivisions. the font is only designed/to be used
  in kapitals. \r\n\r\nMy question is: is it possible to paste this font into fontlab
  with the grid i have used or has the grid got to be dividable with 10? -which would
  mean that i would have to make the whole font over again..\r\n\r\nAnd how long time
  would it take if i found someone who could do it??\r\n\r\n(i hope i am making sense
  \xB4qause i dont really know what I am talking about with Fontlab)\r\n\r\nI HAVE
  ATTACHED THE FONT JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA! \r\n\r\n"

  body: Fontlab will let you import Illustrator files. There are very specific steps
    to take. You might do a search on google to find them. Alternatively, yes, you
    could get somebody to convert your font for you. Also, Fontlab will support multiple
    kinds of grids - but is it a bitmap font you want to make? Maybe you should post
    some images of what you have so you can get better advice.

    points rather than mm because 1 pt in Illustrator = 1 font unit in FontLab. Please
    read http://groups.msn.com/fontlab/tipsandtricks.msnw?action=get_message&mview=0&ID_Message=2675\r\n\r\nYou
    can set up any grid subdivisions in FontLab you want. \r\n\r\nRegards, \r\nAdam
