  curve over the \"a\" to show a \"short a\", or a line over an \"a\" to show a \"long
  a\".  I thought this would be so easy to find, but I'm now thinking I'm just not
  describing the right thing when looking in fonts.com for this.  \r\n\r\nCan someone
  recommend the name of a serif font with the glyphs that make the words look like
  they're showing pronunciation from a dictionary?\r\n\r\nThanks!!"

    of getting an answer. Just for a trial, I looked at Adobe's <a href=\"http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=ADT0000010#characters\">Arno</a>,
    a recent font by Robert Slimbach that I believe was designed to support almost
    any publishing need. Looking at the glyph map, I see the upside-down 'e' that
    is the schwa (?), the most common sound in English. At least that gives me encouragement
    that with all the other accented glyphs that font could support dictionary work.
    I suspect that most of the newer OpenType families, including Typotheque's Fedra,
    which I know has been used for dictionaries, according to Typotheque's catalog,
    would probably support dictionary phonetics with their extended character sets.\r\n\r\n-

  body: Thanks! I had no idea the answer was so involved.  I thought there would just
    be a set of fonts out there specifically for this.  My answer was very simple
    though, just go into MS Word, get symbol for the font, copy & paste into Photoshop.  Who
    woulda thought it was that easy.  Thanks for the tips on extended symbols for
    fonts!  Jennifer
