    part was when the avante garde, quasi radical looking punk rock band get put in
    the magazine layout and get titled with Poppl Residenz. '

  body: "From 4\u203245\u2033 on, G\xFCnter Gerhard Lange (1921\u20132008), then the
    artistic director at Berthold, is talking to Bernd M\xF6llenst\xE4dt (1943\u2013),
    who took over this position in 1990. At 6\u203225\u2033, one can have a look-around
    in the Taufkirchen typedesign studio, with the many nameless women, working in
    Ikarus at dimly lit Tektronix screens.\r\n\r\nThis is the place where Dieter Hofrichter
    (Hoftype) started his career. In the freshly published interview that Dan Reynolds
    conducted for MyFonts, Hofrichter talks about this early stage of \u2018computer-aided
    typedesign\u2019.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.myfonts.de/2012/04/dieter-hofrichter/\">German

    that\u2019s the Ikarus digitizing system.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>For what purpose
    is the man looking through the \"lens\" at 7:03?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s
    a reducing glass, it has the opposite effect of a magnifying glass. He\u2019s
    looking at the drawings through it so he can see them closer to their intended
    final size."
