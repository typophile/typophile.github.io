  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">i&rsquo;m doing an essay on the romulus type and so far i&rsquo;ve found some information on the internet, but not that much. i was hoping, if anyone here has something on it, like a text, information or a good link or pics if you could post them i&rsquo;d really appreciate it. feel free to write anything you think might be useful!</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>There are books that contain beautiful examples, such as John Dreyfus&rsquo;s book on Van Krimpen, as well as material by Van Krimpen himself. You will probably have to go to a research library to get examples of the original letter press version.</p>
<p>The promised revival by [[http://www.dutchtypelibrary.nl/|Dutch Type Library]] has been going on for a long time, and they have an impressive PDF of it on their site, including some optical sizes. However, they don&rsquo;t seem to have released it. I have no idea why.</p>
<p>In the original metal it was one of the most beautiful types ever. As has been commented on by an number of observers, the sloped roman was a failure in that it is rather bland and flat. The evaluation by Walter Tracy in &ldquo;Letters of Credit&rdquo; is fascinating, a must-read if you are interested in Van Krimpen&rsquo;s work. The associated formal script type, Canceresca Bastarda, was also really beautiful.</p>
<p>I think that it would be much more usable if DTL would create a proper companion italic, based on structurally similar designs of Van Krimpen (such as the Haarlemmer, which they have already done).</p>
<p>I would suggest e-mailing DTL. Let us know what you find out.</p>
<p>Once in a while Frank Blokland comes on Typophile, so maybe he&rsquo;ll comment.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>thanx for the dutch library. i was on that site before and was discouraged by the language, but i found that pdf and it will be of great help. i don&rsquo;t think i&rsquo;ll be mailing them because my focus will be on the original thirties romulus type and it&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p>i saw a couple of books by and on van krimpen, but sadly there are no libraries in my country that have books like that. i tried finding some chapters on the web (earlier i found some gerrit noordzij on the net) but no luck.</p>
<p>i found a neat van krimpen bio by years if someone&rsquo;s interested: [[http://www.amethystvisions.com/portfolio/jvk_booklet_final.pdf]]</p>
<p>if anyone knows a recognizable logotype in romulus, that would be very useful too.</p>
