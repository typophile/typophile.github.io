  body: "This was one I tried to answer yesterday when everything was going into the
    Twilight Zone. I think it's likely custom, but if you want to re-create it, my
    suggestion was to use Red Rooster's Radiant Heavy (with Alternates) and then slant
    it. The alternate letterforms have a better match for the U, also, with symmetrical
    wide strokes. Of course you need to tweak some ;)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    come off his hi-hat and stick this one for me.  Maybe it was just too rudimentary
    for him?\r\n\r\nChrisL"
