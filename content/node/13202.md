body: "Hello everyone,\r\n\r\nin a brazilian typography discussion group we've been
  talking about typographic terms and how we use so many english terms like kerning,
  tracking, leading, etc. When trying to translate, we often run into the problem
  of not fully understanding the english term. One word we have some trouble translating
  is <em>tracking</em>. Although we all understand what tracking \"does\", I was wondering
  if anyone knows the origin of this term and any synonyms it might have. I've tried
  a dictionary but no luck.\r\n\r\nThank you!"

  body: "My recollection is fuzzy, but may be of use anyway.\r\n\r\nSome old photosetting
    machine (I'm thinking Compugraphic MCS, but may well be mistaken) used a mechanism
    for controlling letterspacing that was, in some ways at least, more sophisticated
    than what we have now. Instead of one horizontal spacing value each for left side
    bearing, right side bearing, and kerning adjustment (per letter pair, in a big
    table), these values were stored in some number of <i>tracks</i>. I'm vaguely
    recalling 9, arranged something like: touching, very tight, tight, slightly tight,
    normal, slightly loose, loose, very loose, and h e l l a &nbsp; l o o s e. These
    values could be individually adjusted by the typeface designer. For example, \"no\"
    and \"on\" pairs in a serif face would be brought a lot closer together in the
    touching track than \"nn\" and \"oo\". In any case, I believe the word \"tracking\"
    was used to refer to selecting a track, probably in parallel with \"kerning\".\r\n\r\nWhen
    desktop publishing happened, fonts didn't actually have separate tracks for spacing
    information, but you could fake the overall effect (loose or tight letterspacing)
    just by adding or subtracting a constant amount of space between each letter pair,
    in addition to the side bearings and kern pairs. It was arguably sloppy language
    to call this setting \"tracking,\" but it seems to have stuck.\r\n\r\nIn the Star
    Trek future, we may get the sophistication of 1970's phototypesetting machines
    back, and once again have fonts with more intelligent spacing info, probably around
    the same time optical scaling once again becomes the standard as it was in the
    metal days. Then, I'm sure the marketing people will have to invent a new word
    to distinguish it from the constant spacing offset known as \"tracking\" in common
    usage.\r\n\r\nHope this helps, and I'd be curious to see what you end up with
    for the Brazilian translation."

    presumably.\r\n\r\nSo the origin of the word goes back to \"you ain't heard nothin'
    yet!\" -- ie the addition of a sound track to movies in the 1920s (and on to multi-track
    sound recordings in the 1940s). \r\n\r\nA track is a linear sequence of marks/traces;
    which describes movie film. And film, with its frames and sprockets, visually
    resembles a railroad track. \r\n\r\nTwo tracks running side by side is a good
    metaphor to describe how image and sound work together. Hence \"soundtrack\". "

    body: 'Compugraphic''s AutoKern was developed for the EditWriter in 1979. For
      kerning each character was assigned values to describe the outline at the baseline,
      x-height, and ascender. Tracking was based on an algorithm that defined three
      levels of compensation. BookSet, AdSet, and TightSet. All values were input
      on a chip and card. '

    similar algorithm to auto-kern. It wasn't exceptionally good (like it would over-kern
    sometimes), but at TV resolutions it was better than nothing.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
