    I'm not positive, their previewer doesn't work in my old browser for some reason."

  body: "Hey, could this be <strong>mdd</strong> by <a href=\"http://www.playtype.com/\"
    target=\"new\">Playtype</a>, the type foundry of Danish design bureau <a href=\"http://www.e-types.com/\"
    target=\"new\">e-Types</a>? Sure looks like it. It's a shame the website sucks
    big time -- very hard to see samples, or to even select them.\r\n\r\nTo view mdd
    -- slowly scroll your pointer sideways over the central image <em>without clicking</em>
    until you see the mdd type family names appear directly left to the central image
    (the position of your pointer is tracked by a vertical magenta band). Click and
    the central image will change to the sample of mdd.\r\n\r\nSomebody should talk
    to these people about usability and communication and stuff... :^/"
