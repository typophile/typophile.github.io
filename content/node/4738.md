  body: A belated happy birthday, James.  <BR> <BR>&#40;&#42;sigh&#42; A day late
    and a dollar short. A lower back injury has kept me out of commission and straggling
    behind.&#41;  <BR> <BR>Hope your day was a wonderful celebration. <BR> <BR>--

    all the birthday wishes. <BR> <BR>And there does appear to be a hint of movement
    by the Feds on Clearview adoption, but I have heard that before, so I am not holding
    my breath. &#40;though I have gotten quite good at it over these last ten years&#41;
