It's for my freelance company studio513.net better known as Studio513. My tag line is "Embracing the butterfly effect." The 513 was my late grandmother's birthday so I named it after her.

So the little icon representing me is what I'm talking about....

i really like the butterfly mark. Not 100% sure about the spacing between the right 'feeler' and the 3, it seems slightly too tight. Also, have you tried replacing the upwards stroke on the 5 and implementing a ball terminal here as well? Might look more balanced. I'd love to see some subtle refinements to really bring it home.

OK. We're just saying many people don't...especially when it is used for somethingthat could have been done without it.

"The counter is for other reasons, I’m trying to see how many people actually visit."

The counter won't tell you that. You need a web stats analysis tool...this is usually provided free by most competant web hosting companies. If not, there are 3rd party apps that can do it for you (like Google Analytics).

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Datura

Does the butterfly (and your tagline) describe what you do? If so, stick with the butterfly, but I think you could try to make it fly (it's a bit rigid for a butterfly).

Are you totally happy about '513'? Is it well-known among your customers? I mean, choosing a firm name because it is your grandmother's birthday is not the normal way of making an excellent firm name. I knew a person who set up a design firm called 'Magnolia' because she liked the movie. I would say that this is not the best approach.

		<div class="commentbody">Maybe I should explain a little more. I am no where near a "design firm." My full time job is for another company. This is more of a place for me to display my freelance work. I'm prob considered and amateur to the people on this site!

My tagline is "Embracing the butterfly effect." Which to me is a metaphor for the design process--how one thing effects another in the design itself. 

About the 513--my grandmother was more of my mother and I lost her when I was 18, it changed my whole life. I feel like she is still watching over me which is why I named the studio after her. My goal is for her to be proud of me and my art.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">My point is that you must not choose a firm name (no matter how small a firm) that becomes an obstacle. If your grandmother meant a lot to you, then fine. But if everyone that sees the mark misinterpret it, then you should not use it, but change to something else.


I was in fact only talking about principles. And choosing a name for personal reasons that are not obvious to the spectator _must_ be the wrong way of thinking.

That said, your mark probably works just fine. '513' has really no irrelavant connotations. I was more worried about the Magnolia case.

But one weakness about your mark is this: when people see, they go: "It reads 53" or "It reads 53 or 513" (the middle digit has a different style than the other two).

I like the way you have flipped the 5.
