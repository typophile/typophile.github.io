body: Hey! <BR> <BR>I just got an idea the other day about making some own type speciments
  for my favourite typefaces and then make SRA3-posters to frame and put up on my
  wall. I just finished the second one &#40;Minion Pro&#41; and I would like to get
  some critique on my work. <BR> <BR>I will create at least one more but I&#39;m still
  deciding on what more typefaces I want to pay homage to. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.joacim.net/forum/gillsans_speciment.gif">001.
  Gill Sans</a> <BR><a href="http://www.joacim.net/forum/minion_speciment.gif">002.
  Minion Pro</a> <BR> <BR>Best regards, <BR>Joacim W

  body: What a nice idea! You might even be able to sell these. Although that will
    affect what typefaces you choose... For which you might benefit by looking at
    top-seller lists and such. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: I would buy a Minion poster, as for Gill, well, I have probably made my opinion
    fairly well known around these parts. <BR> <BR>Hildebrant.

  body: Is the straight quote on the Gill Sans specimen purposeful? <BR>Just wondering.

  body: I&#39;d think designers would certainly appreciate an oversize specimen, particularly
    of the format you used on Minion, with uc&amp;lc as well as alternates and ornaments.
    <BR> <BR>Thumbs up on the single-spot choice, too.

  body: 'Some of the spacing on the Minion poster could use some work: there are nasty
    gaps in some of the text samples.'
