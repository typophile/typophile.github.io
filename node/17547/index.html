  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi Guys,
I need help with this one! I am working on a logo for a clothing brand based in London. They are aiming at the very highest level of the streat/casual market, and selling worldwide. So the logo must work internationally. I have gone for an image to represent the pagan greenman god. The brand wanted, a folk/pagan feel but with a mix of traditional/modern style. It needs to be instatly recognisable and distinctive, and memorable.</p>
<p>It will be used for prited catalogue, on garments, labels, stickers and web. It is still in development so colours can change.</p>
<p>whats your thoughts?</p>
<p>thanks</p>

<p>The type may want to be tracked out a bit; tightly-spaced caps carry less of an association with &ldquo;elegance&rdquo; and are sometimes hard to read.</p>
<p>I am very, very glad to see there are still people who when asked to create a folk/pagan feel do not go straight to uncial lettering!</p>

<p>Thanks for responding. MekOne I have just mocked up something with the text to tie it in as you said. Was this what you meant?
regarding the logo I do not want it to be seen as a Che Guevara rip, so will need to change it, would like it simplified also.  Wat are peoples thougths on a direction to go in?</p>

With some illustrated like that you need to keep the type simple and the illustration separate from it. Fashion needs no explanation. Especially if this is going towards the level of high end Covent Garden or Notting Hill or wherever else is on point now.</p>
<p>The two last versions you have posted &hellip; the idea of the antlers and the M is interesting, but the typefaces you&rsquo;ve chosen are too well known in other areas. I&rsquo;d really keep the logo separate from the logotype.</p>

<p>I had the same thought myself hat logo and type together are killing it. The one with out is the direction Im going in. But my minds blank now, and I need some ideas or comments, on what is working and what is not. Im going back to drawing board now to play with some ideas and will post soon. thanks.</p>
<p>PS: your assumption on brand was correct, is selling in Covent garden, Liberty, and somewhere in Notting Hill, along side labels such as Silas, PAM, Supreme, Bathing ape, Stussy etc. But the label is alot cleaner and less graphics based, so logo needs to reflect this.</p>

What I was saying about the Che look was not to imply a ripoff just a first impression on seeing it, but I do think that it is too nebulous to be read as a pagan image.

<p>The logo does not need to be known to have a pagan reference, thats just my brief. They want the logo to be able to stand on its own, with out being kitch to twee, with no real link to anything, apart from maybe a noble old folk feel, slightly.</p>
<p>Im worried about the bottom appearing like a shield, it not supposed to look like something mounted on the wall.</p>

<p>I know Bathing Ape, as a good friend of mine is the director of the London store. Logo wise, I can see that their is a similarity, but I do not think it looks forced or intentional, what do others think. I never had this is mind when doing this one. Please can I have some feed back from others on this matter? I think the Bape logo is far more like a silhouette, where as the Merlin logo is far more stylized in design. This is why I have tried to make is as symmetrically proportionate as possible. But maybe its not working?</p>
<p>But on the matter of the concept being similar, this I have no idea what you mean. Bathing Ape brands everything, whereas this brand is very much about simplicity, actually  its concept is so completely the opposite of Bathing Ape.  Please explain how you see the two concepts in a similar way?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><cite>But on the matter of the concept being similar, this I have no idea what you mean. Bathing Ape brands everything, whereas this brand is very much about simplicity, actually its concept is so completely the opposite of Bathing Ape. Please explain how you see the two concepts in a similar way?</cite></p>
<p>I meant that while the two icons are different in subject matter, the concept or rather execution are similar. Both icons have a similar high contrast/silhouette look. I&rsquo;m not accussing you of copying in any way, but I don&rsquo;t want you to unknowingly lead your client into potential legal trouble with BAPE.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I see your point now, for the similarities in the logo are noticeable. As both brands operate on same level, this will need to be considered. I am working on a new icon, please allow we the weekend to pull together a number of new designs which I shall post. Thank you for your very useful thoughts</div>
