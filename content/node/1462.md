  body: Hi, Miguel. Based on the wording of this clause alone, you should be able
    to distribute your fonts anywhere you choose. But double-check the rest of the
    verbiage to ensure there aren&#39;t limitations as to who else can distribute
    your fonts &#40;i.e., you are allowed to sell the fonts on your own site, but
    a third party can&#39;t.&#41;. <BR>
