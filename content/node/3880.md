body: 'I bought Adobe&#39;s new OTF Fournier set the other day, cobbled up a version
  of Voltaire&#39;s <I>Candide</I> at 10 points and printed proofs of a few pages.
  <BR> <BR>The color is lighter than I expected and not very impressive. As I have
  never seen any of Fournier&#39;s work I don&#39;t know what to make of it. <BR>
  <BR>Allen Hunt, in <I>Fournier the Compleat Typographer</I> notes that Monotype
  used Fournier&#39;s St. Augustin ordinaire &#40;14pt&#41; as a model when designing
  their version. I assume that if I bump up the point size I&#39;ll get better output,
  but I don&#39;t know how Fournier used his type. <BR> <BR>Can anyone offer any advice
  about period practice &#40;use&#41;, point size, tracking, etc.? <BR> <BR>p.s. Hunt
  also noted that Monotype developed two Fournier families: Fournier series 185, which
  is the version I think MT digitized, and Barbou series 178, which was thought to
  have better color and &#34;robustness&#34;. Barbou would seem to be a good candidate
  for someone looking for a face to revive.'
