  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello again,</p>
<p>MAQ is a company that is going to start giving out certificates for nurses and other people in the medical field. The certificate is for treatment/handling of prescription drugs, dosage and things like that for patients.</p>
<p>They take a test and if they pass they get a certificate that shows they are capable of handling prescription drugs.</p>
<p>Anyway, I sort of mentioned the first idea that popped into my head to the client. That perhaps some version of the round stamp/seal that you usually see on old certificates, could be a nice logo. She really liked it for some reason but I hadn&rsquo;t really thought through how that would look exactly.</p>
<p>So the first versions I drew is suppose to remind one of the stamp.</p>
<p>I would like to hear your opinions about the feather pen and the leaf. The pen would relate to the signing of the certificate making it official. The leaf would stand for growth and education. Is it to far of a reach or do you think this idea could work?</p>
<p>These sketches are pretty rough.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I&rsquo;m not familiar with the certificates that you&rsquo;re referring to (and referencing here) - so I can&rsquo;t say how much they would or wouldn&rsquo;t remind me of those.</p>
<p>Also, it&rsquo;s also not entirely clear to me why some of them (2,5) have the little green &ldquo;collar&rdquo; at the bottom of the ring.</p>
<p>The leaf/feather is great though. It just doesn&rsquo;t seem to suggest medicine.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The feather/leaf icon is kinda interesting, not really for medicine. In addition I think you have to make the leaf a tad bit smaller. The size relation is off.</p>
<p>As for the rest of the stamp idea. I don&rsquo;t think they read as certificate stamps. #4 looks like a cross/hill and sunrise. #2 could work, but I don&rsquo;t understand the little green collar. #3 seems busy and to abstract. #5 I just don&rsquo;t like. It looks heavy. #6 you said it&hellip;alien like. You gotta keep in mind how this will work in black/white. #2 works the best out of all them.</p>
<p>The visual I saw when you mentioned the stamp on an old certificate seemed more organic, not so polished. Just some thoughts.</p>

<p>A note on the name.</p>
<p>MAQ is not going to be the name of the company. MAQ is the name of the research project that will set the base for the company. The real company name is still secret.</p>
<p>In this version I&rsquo;ve replace the name with another word that has the right first and last letter of the real name.</p>
<p>So this is what I&rsquo;m thinking now. The squares and the ball in the middle is supposed to symbolize the five Scandinavian countries that this company will cooperate with. The ball being Finland and the rest Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Iceland.</p>
<p>Found a type that I think will work FF Sanuk.</p>
<p>I want it to be a little stiff and not too organic like my first drafts. Also calculating drugs involves a lot of math and the test is basically a medical math test.</p>
<p>Haven&rsquo;t picked any colors yet or done nay kerning.</p>
<p>This is by far my most difficult logo work so far.</p>

I think that if you are trying to represent all the Scandinavian countries being in cooperation, they should definitely be connected. It also reminds me a little of all the plastic breakaway attachments and covers on medical sterile medical equipnemt.</p>
<p>As for the type, I&rsquo;m having a problem with the &ldquo;R&rdquo;. All the other letters have straight lines in them, and the Rs are curved on the tail. I know you are keeping the company name secret, but if we saw what the word really looked like, I think we could judge better.</p>
<p>As for colors, I would recommend blue and white, definitely. Maybe with a tiny bit of red.</p>

<p>Also the real name is shorter and it looks better with the graphic then this does.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if they will like this idea at all. They are highly educated people so don&rsquo;t know how they will see this.</p>
<p>Right now I don&rsquo;t mind the R&rsquo;s because I think they give something extra to the type and the graphic as a hole.</p>

<p>If you are concerned about that, surely the Swedish flag is a yellow cross on a blue field? I do get a nationalist feel from the symbol – not necessarily in a good way. I far preferred Sanuk as the typeface however I am not to keen on the larger P if they were all the same height the word could centre on the mark.</p>

<p>Yes the Swedish flag has yellow and blue but not white. If I put red and blue together it will come in such an order that it will directly look like a reference to the Norwegian, Danish or Icelandic flag.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really get across with the medical theme in 2-4.</p>
<p>The real name is has two capitals in it. Like McDonald&rsquo;s. The two capitals being P and C.  That&rsquo;s how they want it written.</p>

Then theres the five lines which is a reference to the five Scandinavian countries. Then some leaves to symbolize growth.</p>
<p>I have a meeting tomorrow with the people I&rsquo;m making this for. Think I&rsquo;ll have to present this.</p>
<p>This is a pretty rough so far.</p>
<p>Feedback greatly appreciated.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I noticed that the navy blue and gold doesn&rsquo;t work for this graphic.</p>
<p>As for the cross I was the one pushing that idea to try and get the certificate seal idea out of the clients head. I shouldn&rsquo;t have mentioned that to her. Every time I mention a cross they don&rsquo;t sound very convinced. From the first meeting I got the feeling that they don&rsquo;t want the logo to relate to anything medical, which is a little strange.</p>
<p>I had the client on the phone the other day and I pitched this latest idea to her and I got nothing. I&rsquo;m having some trouble getting an accurate idea of what they want. The only thing that she felt excited about was a certificate seal/stamp with tufts on it, feel like she was visualizing clip art and not a logo.</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;ve had my rant.</p>
<p>Tried replacing the ball with the cross and that works if I redo the leaves and maybe make some other changes but I don&rsquo;t have time to do that before the meeting.</p>
<p>Anyway I&rsquo;m going in with this. It&rsquo;s pretty far from finished but it will have to do. At least I&rsquo;ll find out if I&rsquo;m close or not.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well it did not go great.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t hate it but they didn&rsquo;t like it either.</p>
<p>The Scandinavian countries idea is out the window. Their goal is to give certificates in the hole of Europe. Can&rsquo;t really incorporate this into the logo either since it&rsquo;s just a goal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m starting to think that they commissioned a logo too early. The name that is secret is not a future name like I was told in the beginning it&rsquo;s just a unapproved proposition if it becomes a company which also is uncertain. They might also become an organization and then there will be some another name. The name MAQ will only stick as long as it&rsquo;s a research project.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t seem to want the symbol to relate to anything pharmaceutical. Right now I have no idea of what they want exactly. They said that they will show the logo to some people and get some feedback then get back to me in two weeks. I&rsquo;ve made some written suggestion on where I would take the logo from now on.</p>
<p>thanks for the feedback

<p>So I&rsquo;ll revise and see where I end up.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>This is where I&rsquo;m at right now.</p>
<p>I think it starts to feel more prescription drug like. IMO the bowl really stands well for that part. What do you think?</p>
<p>Two versions. One with a simple leaf and one with a striped leaf. The stripes would stand for EU or the countries they are going to cooperate with. The simple leaf would stand for professional growth.</p>
<p>One of the persons that gave feedback thought the earlier version was to ancient. He had an image of something more modern so I&rsquo;m going that route at the moment.</p>
<p>Feedback appreciated.
