  body: Josh I haven&#39;t a clue what disc golf is? Please provide more information.
    Like how your logo will be used. Your current logo could be for anything. It conveys
    nothing.

  body: Disc golf = golf with frisbees...usually equated with stoners. &#40;Which
    I always felt was part of its appeal ;o&#41; <BR> <BR>As for the logo, Is this
    a governing body type of thing or more of a marketing/PR entity for the sport
    as a whole?

  body: I started playing in the early eighties but never played high. Watching the
    development of the discs was great. Soft squishy discs for putting, discs for
    drives and approach. Different styles, purchased based on the gram weight. <BR>
    <BR>I like the mark. You might work with the line quality and mirror the fats
    and skinnies of the type. Maybe a little more smooth. Some of the inside turns
    seem more abrupt than the type.

  body: Daniel-that was a very good reaction. I don&#39;t know if any mark or even
    wordy display of characters really fully explain disc golf regardless of how simple
    it is. It is literally frisbee golf, with a circular disc thrown into a basket
    of sorts. <BR> <BR>Your observation about what is the mark conveying is exactly
    what i&#39;m asking myself. Is it enough? Do the type and mark feel cohesive?
    The real problem is all the competitors rely on the swoosh factor. We all know
    some peoples thoughts about swoosh-esque mark. Something I may or may not have
    avoided. <BR> <BR>Darrel-you are also correct. That is the image or at least to
    some. This is for a non-profit org that is trying to progress the way leagues
    and tournaments are run and improving the overall image by leading by example.
    I have really had to do alot of kicking and fighting to make sure my friend understands
    how the overall image and goals must meet in the middle. Hopefully we can shed
    that image of the stoner dude sport. <BR> <BR>James-Thanks for the critique. It
    is by no means perfect or in the long run the final version. Hopefully something
    better will come about.

  body: In the logo line of work you must remember that the logo is but a signature,
    it is what surrounds it that makes the communication. A good logo &#40;and name&#41;
    only serve as a point of reference, something people will associate with you,
    once they know who you are. It need not even draw them to you, though it is nice
    when it does. Your surrounding materials &#40;from posters to sign up sheets&#41;
    tell them you&#39;re serious. Refining your current mark is all you really need
    to do to have that first step toward a respectable sport.  <BR> <BR>Why is it
    named &#34;core?&#34; Sometimes an association like this might have a little tagline
    that it can lock up for communications to people who have no idea what&#39;s going
    on.  <BR> <BR>Keep the mark abstract, like you have it. It&#39;s endearing and
    simple. Looks to me like a disc in the basket, or two different sized discs, or
    one in motion

  body: Josh explain the Core name, is it an acronym. If it is you might, at first,
    use the full name under Core. I wouldn&#39;t dismiss golf related motifs the PGA
    and its industry have invested millions of dollars into getting people to reconize
    &#34;Golf&#34; icons. I would research what they have done and what works. As
    for the mark over Core it looks like a double halo and is stagnate. Not like something
    moving or something in a basket. Good start keep going.

  body: 'No it is not an acronym. The name Core came about as we spoke about what
    the organization wanted to do. Core felt the need to act in ways that establish
    stronger professional standards and organizational structure in the sport of disc
    golf. Though the word &#39;core&#39; has different definitions, many fit very
    well to the mission. <BR> <BR>By defintion: <BR> <BR>Core - The basic or most
    important part,  a reactor core&#40;which is more about creation and action&#41;&#60;-
    which is our plan also. <BR> <BR>The name doesn&#39;t have the punch of a well...Punch&#40;A
    neopolitan pizza joint&#41;, yet it is a strong word that one can define, associate
    meaning and as an added bonus also allows circular motifs to be used if needed.
    It may be a bit dry, but give us a little time and we&#39;ll see what comes of
    it. <BR> <BR>I am on the boat that naming is very hard. One of our goals though
    was not to use &#39;disc&#39;&#40;ie: Discraft, Disc N Dat&#41;in the name and
    avoid swooshes&#40;flight paths, rainbows, whatever&#41;. <BR> <BR>I also agree
    with you both and try to practice and  preach that a mark should be great at the
    beginning and add value through sales or exposure. Unfortunately, being a side
    project it takes a back burner at times. <BR> <BR>In the meantime I will take
    all this great feedback and see if I can put it to use. <BR> <BR>Web presence:
