    Who are the competitors?\r\n- Why is their service better?\r\n\r\netc."

    and set it properly."

  body: Nick is totally right! :D Get half upfront. They have to show their trustworthy
    business first.

    I get half up front as a rule. But the other half only\r\nwhen the client is 100%
    satisfied. This builds trust both ways.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I want my bank to be credible and trustworthy. I want the guy who fixes my
    car to be credible and trustworthy too.\r\nIf my bank uses Trajan for their logo,
    the message I get is \"credible and trustworthy.\" If the guy who fixes my car
    uses Trajan for his logo, the message I get is \"expensive and slow.\" \r\nAs
    James and J\xF6rg said, context is everything."

  body: "Yes context plays a major part, but of course it's not <em>everything</em>
    \u2013 on a deeper level there are certainly parameters that up a font's general
    \"credibility meter\", like a certain solidity/stability for example in terms
    of width (not too narrow), weight (not too fragile), rigidity (not wobbly), serif
    structure/shape (solid, not lyrical \u2013 maybe even slabs). It should make the
    client feel good and secure; so no surprises, no unexpected strangeness or quirks,
    and probably nothing aggressive (like spikiness).\r\n\r\nBut that still leaves
    a wide range, and these criteria will also vary depending on context; so. What
    does that client even <em>do</em>?"

  body: "What she said.\r\nNothing is everything - everything is something.\r\nMaking
    context omnipotent is anathema to Design.\r\n\r\nBTW, to some extent Trajan says
    \"go away and let\r\nme strike this pose\" no matter the context. And in the\r\ncontext
    of a bank, it says \"you're too small - I like to\r\ntake my sweet time schmoozing
    with very rich people\".\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: I'm impressed by the number of logos I'm seeing in conservative old fashioned
    serif typefaces. The image they project is "nothing dicey here". Just what you
    want for somebody handling your money. Adobe Caslon was one.

    7 pts. \r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, I was going to suggest Franklin Gothic--which for whatever
    reason had always seemed trustworthy to me. Then I remembered Bank of America. "
