  thread about designing my father's gravestone]] that was originally in general discussion.
  The urgency of a font selection froze along with the earth, so I've been able to
  obsess far too long on this decision. I need fresh eyes.\r\n\r\nDue to family vetoes,
  these are the only two approved typefaces; Aichel or Neutra Text. Opinions? Kerning
  issues? Aghast for any reason? Feedback of any kind is welcome. It would be great
  to hear from an actual stonecarver, if there's one here. The stone itself is a mock-up,
  but it is nearly identical to the gravestone my mother chose. \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n

    the reason you think lining figures are more appropriate.

  body: 'Because the letters are going to be sand blasted rather than carved I think
    the Neutra is better. It matches the method/spirit of production better. I might
    look at a wider spacing to make it more monumental is spirit. That would also
    let you have a wider space between Francis & Mary which would look more relaxed
    and be slightly clearer. Also moving the cross over to the left a bit more would
    put the emphasis on the name which is to be fair the right emphasis. And a good
    clear hierarchy is also more relaxing/comfortable. '

  body: I like the serif-version better, i think it works better with the traditional
    form and material of the gravestone. Is the cross there a glyph of this font?
    This disturbes me somehow. And in Germany you would use a dash instead of a hyphen
    to connect your numbers.

    that belongs in the middle of a range (this year to that year) is an en-dash,
    with half spaces to a full space before and after. I'm not sure if you're in the
    States, but that's the convention here.\r\n\r\nI personally prefer the Neutra,
    with perhaps more tracking on the first names. \r\n\r\nIt looks like, when the
    time comes, 4 digits for a death year won't fit under Mary E and still align right
    \u2014 not sure if you want to adjust for that. "

    her she can't die in a fat-numbered year. I've tweaked that block of text a million
    times, testing dates, but the problem is that <em>it just looks awkward</em> with
    her short name and the empty death year space, no matter what I do.\r\n\r\nJames,
    you confuse me. You say shorten the cross ... but then you add <em>it might also
