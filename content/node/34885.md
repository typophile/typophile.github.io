    http://typophile.com/node/18913 \r\n\r\nActually, I\u2019m writing a paper too.
    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, \"Dimensional Typography by J Abbott Miller\"
    was published in 1996. \r\n\r\nOf course, this is still 'GO____OD'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever,
    I'm searching for something newer.\r\n\r\nRecently, either online or offline,
    has this kind of book been published? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you know, let me know
    please... \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Thank you for your favor about reading of my poor
    English~ "

    not to flog a dead horse, but the <em>Univers Revolved</em> book is from 2004.\r\n\r\nBut
    I can also recommend a newer book: <a href=\"http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300117752\"><strong><em>New
    Typographic Design</em></strong></a> (2007), edited by Roger Fawcett-Tang. There
    are several examples of dimensional typography scattered throughout it, especially
    in the Type In Motion section at the end."

  body: Well, I know a site, runned by a portuguese designer named Victor Quelhas
    who has given a conference on dynamic typography in 2006, at Atypi Lisbon. The
    site is http://www.dyntypo.com/, which is open to everyone who wants to share
    theirs experiments on the subject. It has a lot of links and the possibility to
    comment and interact with the objects and the creators. Hope it helps!
