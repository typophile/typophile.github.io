  introduce my first typeface: Octant, a display font inspired by Victorian brass-and-steel
  engineering as well as blackletter ornamentation. It comes with wide-ranging language
  support and decorative ligatures, and is now available on MyFonts at a 51% introductory
  rebate. :)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/catharsis-fonts/octant/\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/poster_promo_3852.png]\r\n\r\nBy
  the way, I'm new to selling fonts \u2014 what does one do to promote a new font,
  apart from what MyFonts does on their own? Any key fora, newsletters, platforms,
  etc that one should send a note to?"

    not already on twitter, sign up quickly. Announce the font release there, saying
    it's on offer. Something like \"Octant released @MyFonts 51% off for a limited
    time.\" And link to it. MyFonts might retweet you, and they have loads of followers.
    You could even ask them to announce you to Twitter. I'm sure they wouldn't mind."

    on the cover of a book or game at some point! But steampunk is an awfully narrow
    genre; I'm wondering whether I dug myself into a hole by marketing Octant as such...
    For instance, I could well see it on the cover of a crime/thriller/suspense novel,
    a bit like FF Disturbance was used for Sch\xE4tzing's [[https://www.fontfont.com/staticcontent/inuseimages/original/FF_Disturbance-Frank_Schaetzing_The_Swarm.png?1311883329|Der
    Schwarm]].\r\n\r\nThink there's a way one could increase the exposure of people
    in the print industry to the existence of Octant...?\r\n\r\nBy the way, my admin
    page says:\r\nStarlets Rank: 51\r\nHotNewFonts Rank: 68\r\nAm I correct in assuming
    that once the HotNewFonts Rank drops below 50, it'll appear on the Hot New Fonts
    webpage and periodically show up as a flag on the MyFonts homepage?"

  body: In Octant, only the f_* ligatures, Q_u, and T_h are encoded in LIGA (standard
    ligatures), whereas the rest are in DLIG (discretionary ligatures). Typographically
    unsavvy applications such as PowerPoint typically have LIGA enabled but DLIG disabled,
    and no option to change that. In Octant Ligatures, all ligatures are encoded in
    LIGA, so they will work in PowerPoint. You can switch them on and off by switching
    between the two font versions.

    logical phrase. But it is easily confused with \"encoded\" as in \"having a codepoint
    assigned to the glyph.\" So for clarity I think one might want to use a different
    verb there, or just leave out that word entirely.\r\n\r\nIn any case, thanks for
    clarifying, as I was wondering the exact same thing.  :)"
