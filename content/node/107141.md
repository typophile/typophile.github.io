  all my MAC applications, but the same family does not fully show on the PC.\r\nSome
  of the fonts are showing on the PC even though they've been uploaded, and it shows
  some of the other members of the family.\r\n\r\nIs there any setting that I should
  change on Fontlab so they are compatible across both platforms?"

    and post a screen dump of the \u2018name\u2019 table on this forum, like this
