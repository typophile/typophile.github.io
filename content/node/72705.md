  not be an easy one...\r\n\r\n\r\nI doing a lot of production work now and I'd like
  to create a Find/Change or a GREP search that will allow me to change multiple dates
  at once.\r\n\r\n\r\nthe format changes from file to file and usually follows these
  4 formats and its also possible that all 4 formats could be used in one document.\r\n
  \r\n\r\n<em>XX/XX/XX</em> (8 characters)\r\n\r\n<em>XX/XX/10</em> (8 characters)\r\n\r\n<em>XX/XX/2010</em>
  (10 characters)\r\n\r\n<em>9/26/10</em> - wrong date in-place. (6 \u2013 8 characters
  depending on the month)\r\n\r\n\r\nInstead of having 4 different searches, is it
  possible to do one search that look for any/all of these text formats and change
  them at once?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n"

    course GREP comes to the rescue. Enter this in your search field:\r\n \r\n<strong>
    \\b((XX|\\d{1,2})/){2}(XX|\\d{2,4})\\b </strong>\r\n\r\n\r\nand it'll find any
    of your examples. Wot Doth This All Mean?\r\n \r\n\\b     a Word break -- there
    must not be a word character +before+ this entire expression. This means it'll
    ignore \"XXX/XX/XX\".\r\n(     repeat group -- see below\r\n( XX | \\d{1,2} )
    \    Either \"XX\" (exactly) or \"a digit, 1 or 2\". This means it'll ignore \"XXX/XX/XX\"
    (three exes), pick up \"1/2/3\" (one digit), ignore \"123/123/123\" (three digits)\r\n/
    \    A slash. Nothing special, except ...\r\n)     .. since this is the end of
    the repeat group ...\r\n{2}     ... we want twice the sequence \"XX/\" (or \"digit/\"),
    to match \"XX/XX/\" and every possible combo with digits as well.\r\n(     oh
    yet another group. That's because ...\r\nXX     .. this literal text ...\r\n|
    \    ... OR ... (hold on, I'm gettin' there)\r\n\\d{2,4}     .. two to four digits
    should be matched ..\r\n)     .. in this entire group.\r\n\\b     Phew! A Word
    break to prevent it matching \"12/34/5678*9*\""

    at all, just post it into Adobe's own <a href=\"http://forums.adobe.com/community/indesign/indesign_general\">InDesign
    forum</a>, or in David Blatner's <a hrf=\"http://indesignsecrets.com/\">InDesignSecrets

    for seemingly impossible things to figger out :-)\r\n\r\n(Funny Commenting Explanation
    is an option, when I'm in the Mood.)"
