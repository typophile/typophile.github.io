  http://www.typotheque.com/site/news_details.php?id=164\r\nAnd the author states
  that 'The @font-face rule is supported by Firefox 3.5, Safari 3.1, Opera 10, Chrome
  2.0 and Internet Explorer 4.0 and later. Our system is thus compatible with more
  than 95% of all browsers in use.'\r\n\r\nI don't believe that Chrome or IE do support
  the @font-face rules. Does anyone have more information on this?"

    often mix up @font-face, EOT and \"raw fonts\".  @font-face is the general technology;
    EOT, TTF, OTF, SVG and so on are possible formats which can work with @font-face
    depending on the browser support. (Similar to GIF/JPG/PNG and the IMG tag)\r\n\r\n"

  body: yes, i know that @font-face is just a css rule. the confusing things is that
    each of the browsers only supports certain font formats with this rule. to me
    it almost makes no sense to speak of @font-face support in general then. If speaking
    about @font-face support it would make more sense to differentiate between @font-face
    embedding for 'raw' or 'naked' fonts and @font-face embedding for encrypted font
    formats, ie EOT.

    an EOT font without URL-binding and compression and obfuscate a \"raw\" font,
    so it's not really raw any more ...\r\nAnd it's getting more complicated now that
    new formats are being proposed.

    @font-face support in general then.</em>\r\n\r\nCertainly talk of @font-face support
    needs to carry this caveat, that different font formats are required to display
    @font-face linked fonts in different browsers. But in terms of recognising @font-face
    in CSS and doing <em>something</em> with that information, one can say that all
    these browsers support it.\r\n\r\nServices like Typotheque's, Typekit and Kernest
    serve different file formats to different browsers as appropriate, while trying
    to provide some measure of server-side or in-font obfuscation to naked font data
    to make it uninstallable on desktop systems. So they can claim to support \u201895%
    of all browsers in use\u2019 even though those browsers support @font-face in
    different ways.\r\n\r\nFrom a type foundry perspective, considering whether to
    sign up for any of these services, a key question is whether the methods of obfuscation
    of naked font data provided are sufficient. You probably also want to make sure
    that your web font license and your contract agreement with these service providers
    specifies that such methods are a requirement, i.e. that naked font data should
    not be served without such measures."

    has been on the other browsers to support EOT Lite, because it is the only format
    that offers a significant measure of backwards compatibility with well over 50%
    of browsers in current use.\r\n\r\nAnd I think the chances of MS supporting raw

  body: "Paul, I understand this is indeed confusing, especially since Internet Explorer
    has supported @font-face for a very long time, but very few people took advantage
    of this. But in a way, this is not so much different from another basic HTML code:
    \ &lt;img src=\"url\" /&gt;\r\n\r\nNot every browser supports all image formats
    (e.g. PNG, BMP), the designer has to choose the format that is best for the purposes.
    Hopefully, we'll soon have one font format that works in all browsers, so we don't
    have to specify two or more* font formats per single web page.\r\n\r\nPeter\r\nhttp://www.typotheque.com\r\n\r\n*
    It is a fact that right now, we deliver subsetted and obfuscated TTF for some
    browsers, and the same font wrapped in EOT for other browsers. But because we
    aim for multilingual support, we realise that even this may not be enough, as
    Apple requires AAT fonts for correct shaping of some non-Latin scripts. I am just
    playing with Devanagari fonts, and while on Windows this sample (http://www.typotheque.com/hindi.html)
    is rendered correctly in all browsers, on Mac the conjuncts are not correctly
    rendered. The sample is in fact Nepalese, not Hindi."

    complete with the proper CSS syntax. Pretty decent selection, too.
