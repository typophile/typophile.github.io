  body: "Oddly enough, I think Yearbook Solid comes very close (or use Outline and
    only use the fill portion for a lighter weight):\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/yearbook-outline/\r\n\r\nThe
    typeface doesn\u2019t include small caps, but you could use faux small caps in
    your layout program, or simply set the letters in two different sizes."

    and computer fonts are different things, so there's a big chance that the one
    in your sample simply doesn't exists in digital format."
