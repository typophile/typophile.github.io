  have become cross-eyed looking through about 10,000 fonts within myfonts.com, about
  7600 to go :-(\r\n\r\nWould any one of you clever people recognise this? The font
  is imbedded in an image and I'm unable to contact the person who set it up for us.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance,\r\nGrace\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/RefManagement_5645.jpg]"
