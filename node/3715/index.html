  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi there, this isn&#39;t a display font, although it might save some similar qualities. The reason that I posted this here is because I designed this font to be read in text blocks.  <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/2901.gif" ALT="http://my.vbe.com/~brknarr/fonts/whipple/images/whipple2.gif"> <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s a blow up sentace <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/2902.gif" ALT="http://my.vbe.com/~brknarr/preview.gif"> <BR> <BR>I sat down with Chank a couple of weeks ago and he critiqued this for me. I&#39;ve made some of the changes he suggested and now I want your opinion. Typophile is amazing and it&#39;s nice to have truly passionate typos here. <BR> <BR>t1mmy</div>

		<div class="commentbody"> Hi Tim, <BR> <BR>If you&#39;re going for something that can be set in small text and retain high readability, there are several things about this font that are inconsistant and would hinder that ability. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m usually not as critical with a new font designer and good job for getting the face this far. But, since you&#39;ve specified that you want to make this more of a text face, there are many issues with the font that I&#39;d like to enlighten you with so can learn why my critique comes off so picky. <BR> <BR>The major concern that is apparent to me is the inconsistant letter width&#39;s in this font. Type out d,o,g,b,e,p,and q and it&#39;ll be obivious what I&#39;m talking about. Ideally they should be crafted from the same round to appear seamless. <BR> <BR>Why doesn&#39;t the top of the body of the j come up to the x height? <BR> <BR>The P and R are the only letters that wrap underneath themselves at the bowl of the letter.  <BR> <BR>Slanted Caps seem like part of another font, should be redesigned to participate in this font. <BR> <BR>y,j,g,t,f each have their own unique hook as desender or ascender, they should all share same hook. <BR> <BR>Top of 1 hangs too low. Seven hugs the left side too much. Tail on 4 broke? W needs to be wider on bottom. Why do Z and z have a serif? No other letters have one. <BR> <BR>There is a process I call &#34;Normalizing&#34; letters in which you print every character you&#39;ve drawn on an 8 1/2&#34; x 11&#34; sheet and study the letterforms. Are they consistant? Are their any oddballs? From there you&#39;d go back in and tweak the letters until you don&#39;t notice any oddballs. <BR> <BR>Also, open a copy of Tekton and study it to the teeth. While it&#39;s different, it is close to your font and would offer some visual guidance for you to follow. Things like the shape of the letters, why they set successfully in text blocks, etc . . . <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not sure if Chank has since critiqued your revised work, but I&#39;d be happy to go over your font with you if you&#39;re interested in another opinion - I&#39;m in Minneapolis also. <BR> <BR>Stuart :D </div>

		<div class="commentbody">here&#39;s an update for whipple. i fixed the shapes of the letters so that they&#39;re more uniform now &#40;just the lc&#41;. <BR> <BR>My question is: should I perform the same process with the uc as well? the uc is looks fairly well proportioned, so that&#39;s why i&#39;m curious. thanks! <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/2911.gif" ALT="preview.gif"></div>
