  unrelated acts of design, manufacture, etc. Sort of like the opposite of that\r\nrecent
  study which claims that letters are designed based on other things around us. (I
  just hope this focus isn't too narrow!)\r\n\r\n* I would argue there really isn't
  any such thing anyway.\r\nUnless you count tripping over a drawer of Caslon laying\r\non
  the sidewalk.\r\n\r\nBesides posting images of such letters, please also discuss
  how you think such letters can come about. Do people incorporate them subconsciously,
  secretly, for show, or what? Below are my two contributions - the first is something
  I found in the street yesterday, the other a photo I once took in Amsterdam (I think
  you attach boats to it). BTW, if you can think of actual fonts that have forms very
  close to these or to unintended letters you've seen, that would be interesting too.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hook_s_3681.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/amster_h_5131.jpg]\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "\"I think you attach boats to it.\"\r\n\r\nIf you spend time around boats,
    especially sailboats, you will see all kinds of things that look like letters,
    starting with lifebuoys.  Off the top of my head, lots of O, D, U, I (the serif
    kind), J, V, H.\r\n\r\nFor example, sail rigging requires objects that are closed
    (O rings/grommets) and objects that can be closed (eg. D shackles), and that are
    curved so that they do not cause undue friction on lines (aka ropes) and halyards
    (steel ropes). "

  body: "I sure hope not.  A D-ring (as distinct from a D-shackle) is often used at
    the corners of a sail and they are under major loads. \r\n\r\nA passage from The
    Sailmaker's Apprentice:\r\n\r\n\"...there are designs for various corners and
    specific uses. \r\n\r\n\"The simplest D-ring is a straightforward D shape - fine
    for straps perhaps, but prone to capsize under the torque and oblique strain of
    sheeting and outhauling when used in the clew of a sail. Consequently, there is
    a range of D-rings with inner crossbar configurations that provide stability of
    installation and isolate a shackle or fitting from the material holding the D-ring
    to the sail.\"\r\n\r\nNote the word \"capsize\", which is not something that the
    average sailor is keen on.\r\n\r\nIf you are prepared to qualify your third photo
    as an \"I\", there is a whole bunch of other gear that will make your list. "

  body: "The people who design/engineer/build expensive yachts are not in the business
    of making fittings like D-rings look \"more like a D than it really needs to be\".\r\n\r\nThey
    are in the business of making boats that are strong and safe, and either fast
    or comfortable (or a compromise between the two), for the expected conditions.\r\n\r\nThere
    are some yachts, such as America's Cup racing yachts, that push the boundaries,
    but the designers of these yachts are on the leading edge when it comes to strength
    of materials and fittings.\r\n\r\nIf you check around on Google, you will find
    D-rings and D-shackles that look quite different from the one in your photo. "

  body: "Do a google search for +\"starling burgess\" +bluenose. \r\n\r\nI have a
    photograph that the UK marine photographer Frank Beken  shot on the deck of the
    Bluenose just off the Isle of Wight in about 1935. The print was made from the
    original glass plate, which I was able to see at the Beken shop at Cowes. It is
    considered to be one of Frank Beken's finest photographs. There is probably an
    image of it at www.beken.co.uk. It was quite a trick, at that time, to make a
    glass plate photo on the deck of a moving ship, and Beken used a specially designed
    camera, shown on the site. \r\n\r\nI've also been on the Bluenose II, a replica
    built in 1967 and currently undergoing restoration, and she is a truly beautiful
    ship.  Her home port of Lunenberg is a pretty beautiful place itself.  \r\n\r\nRe
    your other question:\r\n\r\nMy point in mentioning that yachts are expensive is
    that people don't spend lots of money to build sailing vessels in order to have
    \ D-shackles and D-rings that are in the shape of a \"proper D\" for aesthetic
    rather than functional reasons. \r\n\r\nSailing boats in open ocean, during the
    night and day, and in good weather and bad, is fairly serious business.  A few
    years ago, while I was at the Isle of Wight, a bunch of young men died while sailing
    between the island and the coast of England, in an area, less than half a mile
    from shore, that I have sailed myself.  Safety/efficiency is the major design
    and construction priority, which when compromised, as it often is, is compromised
    for deliberate  reasons.\r\n\r\nAesthetics is a major issue in boat design, especially
    hull design, just not  at the level of the bits and pieces used for things like
    rigging. If I am chartering a boat, or crewing on someone else's boat, I might
    admire the lines of the hull, but the first thing that I do when I get on board
    is look at the condition of the rigging."

    pine needle, bent and broken, that lay on the ground in a perfect 5 shape. \r\n\r\nI
    think it's relevant that some of her favorite Sesame Street videos featured letters
    and numbers out in fields, on swings, walking down the street, etc. To some extent,
    those videos helped teach her what to expect in the world. I would overlook that
    pine needle 999 times out of 1000; the other time, I would marvel at the remarkable
    coincidence. But my daughter simply noted it as one of the happy letters that
    one should simply expect to find in our surroundings. "
