    Fest.\r\n\r\nIMO, it could have been done *a lot* better. I was turned off immediately
    when the teacher started quoting Beatrice Warde (nothing against her or The Crystal
    Goblet)."

    a reference.\r\n\r\n[[http://gmunch.home.pipeline.com/typo-L/misc/ward.htm|Everyone
    should read The Crystal Goblet]]. In my opinion, one of the most eloquent pieces
    of writing on the subject of typography. I particularly like the phrase \"humility
    of mind.\""

  body: "Christopher, I agree that everyone (everyone involved with type design and
    typesetting, that is) should read \"The Crystal Goblet,\" but what often is not
    mentioned is that Ms. Warde was speaking about book typography. Display typography
    often wants and needs to be noticed.\r\n\r\nAs for the documentary, I suppose
    that if it had been shot by type design or graphic design students, the resulting
    film might have been different."
