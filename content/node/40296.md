body: "I am participating in a math conference in early January and need to prepare
  a poster on my research. The poster is to be a 3 fold, science fair style poster
  board. I was wondering if anybody had general design tips for fonts, font sizes,
  line spacing, spacing between different sections &c. It's a pretty serious conference,
  so there isn't much room for pictures or anything but I was thinking of adding some
  color with a border around the sections. Thank you!!!\r\n"

    With Type</em>, and read through it. You can get through it in an afternoon or
    two, and it will give you a ton of useful information for this project."

  body: Well, not exactly a direct suggestion on fonts, font sizes, line spacing,
    spacing between different sections, &c, but I suggest you look at [[http://theoval.sys.uea.ac.uk/~nlct/|Nicola
    Talbot]]'s [[http://theoval.sys.uea.ac.uk/~nlct/latex/packages/index.html#flowfram|flowfram]]
    package if you're comfortable with LaTeX. There's also a Java program called [[http://theoval.sys.uea.ac.uk/~nlct/jpgfdraw/index.html|JpgfDraw]]
    that can be helpful in designing complex layouts with flowfram.

    again for your help! This is my first try at it. I wasn't able to get flowfram
    to work but I made good use out of the a0poster document class. \"Thinking With
    Type\" is in the mail... There is still much work to be done, but I didn't want
    to post all my math! :)"

  body: "I'd suggest that you first think about how the poster will be viewed. Will
    you be standing next to it most of the time, or will it have to stand on its own?\r\n\r\nIf
    you'll be close by most of the time, then consider making the type big enough
    that a viewer could read your abstract and conclusions without invading your personal
    space. I've found that conference attendees like to be able to get a sense for
    what you've done before having to engage you in conversation. Then include diagrams
    and other visual aids that you'd like to be able to refer to while explaining
    your work to those that are interested. This approach will lead to including less
    detail in the poster.\r\n\r\nIf the poster is expected to stand on its own, then
    temptation is to write it like a mini-paper. I've had colleagues who have insisted
    that this is the correct approach to take in creating a poster, and they may be
    right. However, I'd still consider very carefully the level of detail you choose
    to use.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure which typeface you're using for the text, but it looks
    like the tex package uses computer modern for the math. I'd suggest <em>not</em>
    using Computer Modern in the poster. To my taste, it's too spindly.  Try to use
    a package that replaces both text and math font: for example mathpazo (based on
    Palatino) or fourier (based on Utopia) or the mathdesign fonts based on Bitstream
    Charter. Of those, only mathpazo gives true small caps (if you select that as
    an option). \r\n\r\nFinally, I'd also recommend the flowfram package for creating
    a poster.  But consider trying the beamer package as well (if not this time around,
    then in the future).  Beamer was designed for slides, but it gives very fine-grained
    control of many aspects of the layout once you've gotten used to it.  One of my
    student research teams won a poster prize for a poster created with Beamer.  You
    just need to tell it to create a very large slide.\r\n\r\nST"
