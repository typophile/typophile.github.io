  of Unicode 5.1 in 2008 the German alphabet got completed and has now a proper replacement
  for the character \xDF (called \u201CEszett\u201D or \u201Csharp s\u201D) when type
  is set in uppercase letters or small caps. Even in Germany not everyone has ever
  thought about this missing character, but it usually just takes a couple of minutes
  to explain, why it is needed. Still, in the typographic community many completely
  deny the whole idea of this character. In this article I will comment on the typical
  problems and arguments \u2026\r\n\r\nhttp://bit.ly/feKYJa"

    more /\u1E9E/s in the future.\r\n\r\nHowever, its general acceptance is highly
    dependent on its shape.\r\nThe \u1E9E with a straight stem and a top serif, like
    the one in Rooney and even more in Vesper, seems completely out of place \u2013
    to me, it always looks like a greek or cyrillic character in a Latin typeface.\r\n\r\nThe
    Spiekermann quote of the \u2018Ansamm\xADlung sch\xF6ner Buch\xADstaben\u2019
    comes to mind \u2026"

    but that is one sexy glyph!

    Gustafs\r\n\r\nInteresting, I have the opposite feeling bout the capital \xDF.
    If it is too round, it does not seem to be a proper capital letter..."
