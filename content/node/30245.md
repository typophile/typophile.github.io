  came up\u2014or at least I get that impression from my searches. Anyway, I'm starting
  down the path of learning to design type, and I'm trying to pick a program.\r\n\r\nHas
  anything happened since Fontlab bought and rereleased Fontographer that makes Fontographer
  worth learning? And since I'm doing this on my own (my school doesn't teacher lettering
  or type design) and won't do anything but display types for at least a few years,
  should I just start with Typetool?"

  body: "In my opinion FontLab is the only choice even though I kind of like the retro
    feeling in Fontographer. I started with Fontographer at first (some months ago)
    and would have probably stayed with it if the application only had a couple of
    updates:\r\n\r\n1. Better screen/preview resolution. I got tired not seeing the
    glyphs with a good resolution directly in the app. It felt very old style (but
    had a charm none the less). In FontLab you see the letters much more clearer.\r\n\r\n2.
    OpenType support (to be able to produce OT-fonts with it).\r\n\r\nIf these two
    things got updated while I had the app I would probably continued using it for
    a while.\r\n\r\nBUT... in that case I didn\u2019t have had the opportunity to
    see all the other great tools that FontLab offer. It\u2019s loaded with helpful
    tools that makes things so much more smooth when working with the fonts.\r\nIn
    other words, I recommend FontLab if that wasn\u2019t clear :) Not that you automatically
    make better fonts with it, but just because it\u2019s a very helpful tool no mather
    what kind of fonts you intend to produce.\r\nAnd not to forget, OpenType. Trust
    me, you will want to add OpenType features to your fonts. OpenType is a fantastic
    development in the font area \u2013 making almost everything possible."

  body: "Here is a longish answer. I'd been using Fontographer since version 1.-something.
    When FontLab 2.-something was released, I got a copy. I worked in Fontographer,
    but when done, ran the font through FontLab to clean up all the bugs in the file
    Fontographer had introduced. I finally moved to FontLab entirely with version
    4.something. It is a much better program, but I still find it harder to work on
    characters (as opposed to FILES).\r\n\r\nFontLab is a wonder for new-kids or programmer-savvy
    folk. As such, the support you can get sort of assumes these skills. But as my
    programmer partner says, \"That's the way the world has gone; learn or go under.\"
    Sadly, I agree. Get FontLab."

  body: "Metalfoot, \r\n\r\nTypeTool not only \"leads into FontLab\", it also includes
    FontLab's technology under the hood. The FontLab engine has been tested very extensively
    in professional font production by most of the top font foundries of the world.
    TypeTool includes the same engine, it just has a simpler user interface and some
    limited functionality. (The currently shipping TypeTool 2 is analogous to FontLab
    4.6, the upcoming TypeTool 3 will be based on FontLab Studio 5's engine). \r\n\r\nFontLab
    has been known for very good autohinting, and the same technology is included
    in TypeTool, while FontCreator apparently does not. TypeTool supports both Type
    1 and TrueType fonts, and allows drawing in both Bezier and B-splines mode, while
    FontCreator only supports TrueType and B-splines, as far as I know. On the other
    hand, FontCreator has integrated autotracing for which you need ScanFont when
    working with TypeTool. \r\n\r\nThe .vfb files saved out of TypeTool can be passed
    on to a production partner using FontLab Studio 5 who could then generate state-of-the-art
    OpenType fonts. Altneratively, you could generate a Type 1 font out of TypeTool
    and then use TransType Pro with Microsoft VOLT or the free AFDKO (Adobe FDK for
    OpenType) to turn that Type 1 into a fully-functional PostScript-flavored or TrueType-flavored
    OpenType font. This is something that is not so easily accomplished with FontCreator
    (since it does not generate fonts with PostScript outlines). \r\n\r\nI work for
    Fontlab Ltd. so my opinions may be biased. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam Twardoch\r\nFontlab

    Ah well. I need to finish my hand-drawn outlines before I even think of learning
    a computer program to transfer them.
