  body: I was in the first intake of full time students at London College of Printing
    MA Typo/graphic Studies (only six of us then). That was ten years ago, since then
    the intake has grown and the teaching staff have changed. It is still a great
    course. My advice is to visit the college, meet the students and ask them directly
    about their experience.
