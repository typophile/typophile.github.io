  from the 1920s.  The font used for the text is Silentina (well, that's the newly
  created font that is the same), but the drop caps I've seen in TONS of silents is
  different.  Am pasting an example of a few of the letters I've grabbed (doesn't
  spell anything), plus a sample intertitle from a BK film.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/silfilm-dropcaps_6272.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ourhospitality-dropcap_3475.jpg]\r\n\r\nAny
  suggestions??  "

    Nouveau & Victorian Alphabet books -- still no joy. \r\n\r\nWhat's the age of
    these samples? If it's 20th century, maybe it will be in McGrew's book. If it's
    19th century, the Solotype & Dover  books were my best shot. (I'm checking McGrew
    now).\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    body: Don't know if it's 19th or 20th century. Just know I've seen this same drop
      cap typeface in tons of silent films from the early 20s through early talkies
      of the 1930s.  Thanks for hunting around...got my fingers crossed...!
