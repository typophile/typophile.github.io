Sheeesh! :D <BR> <BR>Seriously, I've designed both text and display and I honestly consider text to BE display just with more rules and different goals. <BR> <BR>I'm sure somebody will jump don't my throat here and tell me they are totally different but it's still the same number of letters, attention to spacing and kerning and make no mistake COLOR is just as important to a display face as a text one. <BR> <BR>Beyond that, I have a grass is greener on the other side philosophy about designing text since display is my preference. I would love to design the next Helvetica or Times so I am compelled to experiment to figure out what works and why with text designs. <BR> <BR>It's like sitting down to design a display font and saying my goal is to create something that looks like a 1940s Chinese menu. I can easily judge the success of the face or not when I've gotten a few glyphs into it. I think the same goes for a text face if I define a goal for it before I start. <BR> <BR>I enjoy making fonts, all kinds of fonts and I highly suggest that a type design NEEDS to actually make both kinds at least once. It'll raise acute design issues they hadn't considered in there preferred font making style. <BR> <BR>My 2</div>

Or you want to make the type look like has been blown up big, really in your face, say with a high contrast image or an image with a coarse graphic screen. Or maybe you are going to give the type a faux effect, and you need the heft to withstand the distress. <BR> <BR>At the opposite end, you can use display faces quite small on coated paper, especially on a small sheet that people will hold close. And when you need a precious effect. <BR> <BR>So really, typefaces should be designed to look good both small and large.  <BR> <BR>Rather than &quot;Display&quot; and &quot;Text&quot;, consider &quot;Fine&quot; and &quot;Strong&quot; as the terminology.</div>

Optical correction is a fact of life, and it seems (to me at least) that the practice of optical correction and readability/legibility are a perfect marriage (albeit a shotgun wedding).  Can optical correction really have a point without readability?  I'm not defending Hrant, which reminds me&hellip; <BR> <BR>Hrant, <BR> <BR>I was thinking about the bouma thing today and it dawned on me&ndash;if words can have established shape recognition, why can't individual letters.  They obviously can.  Still seems like a chirographic convention to me&ndash;the broad-nib pen is the genesis of certain &quot;sub-stroke&quot; features (like the one in bicameral &quot;a&quot;, moving from the start of the bowl and into the lower portion&ndash;this can't be a perfect geometric curve or the eye will notice that something is a little off). <BR> <BR>Even a good sans with very little modulation demonstrates the sub-stroke. <BR> <BR>Right?&hellip;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">In fact letters are the foundational elements - and for most of us they're the only things we're <i>explicitly taught</i>, which is why reading via boumas seems counter-intuitive*. But once we're taught the atomic units we start fending for ourselves, and we learn things (boumas) without explicit instruction, simply because it helps reading performance. <BR> <BR>When you think about it (and when you take into account certain pieces of empirical data, not to mention tons of anecdotal evidence) you realize that it only makes sense. After all, why would the brain <i>refuse</i> to take in the &quot;ing&quot; string for example as a cognitive unit? And why would it be so hard to read the word &quot;readjust&quot;? <BR> <BR>* Another &quot;problem&quot; with the bouma model is that it's anti-Modernist. <BR> <BR>I think the most elegant way to look at this is to see a letter as a single-element bouma. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

Different cuts for different sizes are what make a typeface suitable for text and display - and at that point you might say it's no longer the same typeface - you would certainly say it's no longer the same font. <BR> <BR>If you look at the optical progression in ATF Garamond, you'll notice gradual curves below 12 and above 14, but an abrupt shift between 12 and 14. That's because the ATF boys saw that as the cutoff between text and display. Usually I myself would put it between 11 and 12, but considering that Garamond is small on the body, it makes sense. <BR> <BR>And if you put the 6 point ATF Garamond (enlarged) next to the 48 point ATF Garamond next to Times, and you ask laymen &quot;which two fonts are the same&quot;, you'll get them pairing up the 2nd and 3rd all the time. And if you ask them &quot;Which one is ugly&quot;, they'll point out the 1st one vitually all of the time. Ugly has virtue in text. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

AW, 2 KEWT! <BR> <BR>&gt;reading theory is bunk <BR> <BR>A. Scott's question was 'do you find the designing of text faces to be too &quot;academic&quot;?' <BR>No, but discussing it can get that way. <BR> <BR>As far as I'm concerned, reading theory has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with the CRAFT of making a typeface. The old guys who designed all the most readable faces managed perfectly well without if FOR CENTURIES. <BR> <BR>Sure, science and LOGIC can help explain how people and things work, but whenever they are used as the basis of creativity the results tend to be BANAL and inhuman. <BR> <BR>As Rilke said (sorry, this is from memory, of a translation) &quot;ONLY THROUGH LOVE can one understand a work of art&quot;. There's enough art in typography to make his statement applicable. <BR> <BR>&gt;I honestly consider text to BE display just with more rules and different goals. <BR> <BR>Right on, Stuart. And I'm sure that's the way Nic Jenson worked on the definitive roman type, which was what we would consider a large text size, around 14 pt in size. Like all subsequent type designers who have produced a smooth text face, he was obviously very UP CLOSE AND INTIMATE WITH HIS GLYPHS, and THE WAY THEY COMBINE with one another. <BR> <BR>For text, as opposed to display, the principles are simple: <BR>1. Sturdier details (eg thicker hairlines and serifs) <BR>2. Avoid small counters <BR>3. Wider sidebearings and serifs <BR>It's that simple &ndash; if you follow these principles, you can turn any display type into a text type. However, if your typeface has uneven color as a display face, it will have uneven color as a text face too, and such faults tend to be more obvious at text size.  <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">HBM <BR> <BR>As nearly as I can figure it the reason that some people dislike sans is because they were told in art school that they should (as a text face). <BR> <BR>I do agree that sans type for the most part don't make the most ideal type for large texts, but I think they were not designed for that. <BR> <BR> For a good many years I convinced myself that I disliked Bodoni . . .all Bodoni, because I read somewhere that I should dislike it. And then one day I took a really good look at it (since I had come into possession of a large number of matrices for casting it) and discovered that to my new eyes, it was lovely. <BR> <BR>I get a little tired of type police. For the past 20 years or more my attitude has been that there is no bad type, some are just better than others. If you apply yourself, you can make any type work, with the possible exception of Murray Hill. I do reserve the right to dislike something. <BR> <BR>I think that if any type has gone through the jury system of a respected, established manufacturer it can't really be inept. <BR> <BR>To answer your other question I like the following sans for both text and display. <BR> <BR>Futura <BR>Hess Sans Serif <BR>Philadelphia Lining Gothic <BR>Plate Gothics (Copperplate) <BR>Gill Sans <BR>Goudy Sans <BR>49J Gothic (Lanston Monotype <BR>Twentieth Century <BR>Univers <BR>Helvetica <BR>Optima <BR>Franklin Gothic (Looks great in 8 point, Yummy!) <BR>New sGothic 206 <BR>Grotesque (English Monotype) <BR>Kabel <BR> <BR>And all seriousness, I would add Cheltenham to my Roman list. <BR> <BR>Hrant: <BR> <BR>If the type I listed did not come out to be the same typeface as when they were metal types that is hardly the fault of the metal types. In any event the ones that I am aware of that are available on the computer still look pretty good to me. Probably because the maker has done extensive scaling and altering. Some of the current Garamonds look a little stiff-assed, and kind of missed the whole point that Garamond should be &quot;uneven&quot;. <BR> <BR>A parting comment re sans. Scour the internet and look for the new Ancient Greek (sans) that Dann Carr has cut for a book titled Fragments of Parmenides, printed and published by Peter Koch. The text was translated by Robert Bringhurst. It's a really lovely type, and another version has been done digitally, but at the moment I can't recall who did that one. <BR> <BR>Jim Rimmer <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Miguel <BR> <BR>I often wonder if the classification of type into text and display is not more than a little subjective. <BR> <BR>I have used 30 point Garamond italic for a broadsheet wherein the entire text was set in this display size. I have seen others do the same kind of thing and the effect is striking. So perhaps this is a little off the discussion, but it IS the use of a display type for text. If you scaled that same display fce down into 12 point and set the same text the effect might be less successful. <BR> <BR>There have been many comparison studies made by scaling different type-size fonts to a common size to compare weight and stroke. I don't think anyone ever came to common understanding over it. So a text face is often huskier and has differing perameters, and if you blow it up, it becomes a medium weight, and not always graceful. <BR> <BR>Sumner Stone designed a lovely face that he has named Arepo, and considers it a display face. I wonder if it wouldn't serve well as a text type. It has all the attributes of a type that would serve in text. It's very attractive, but doesn't holler and shout or draw attention to any one letter. <BR> <BR>Jim Rimmer <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; text reading have to be transparece to the reader, but <BR>&gt; pleasent forms are refreshing if they work technically good. <BR> <BR>No face can -or should- be totally transparent. But there is a qualitative difference between the transparency needed in text versus display design, and this is due to the nature of the intended reading experience: deliberative, where we have time to read a handful of words and we can consciously appreciate the formal details; versus immersive, where the subconsious reading mechanism takes over, because it becomes a performance issue. Readability really only matters when a reader is pushing the limits of perception/cognition - otherwise virtually everything is pretty legible. <BR> <BR>&gt; it IS the use of a display type for text. <BR> <BR>Only if you use a peculiar -maybe pointless- definition of &quot;text&quot;. <BR>Really <i>any</i> text is &quot;text&quot;, even if it's one word. But a <i>useful</i> definition of &quot;text&quot; versus &quot;display&quot; entails a consideration of how humans read. It's been shown for example that when a font is too large reading slows down a lot. So to me &quot;text&quot; means a setting that crosses into the subconscious, immersive mechanism. This is where boumas start to matter, and where an x-height can be too large for example, or spacing too loose. This to me is a useful boundary to think about in the text/display discussion. <BR> <BR>&gt; If you scaled that same display fce down into 12 point and <BR>&gt; set the same text the effect might be less successful. <BR> <BR>Exactly, and not just aesthetically, but functionally. <BR>And what does that tell you? <BR> <BR>&gt; not always graceful. <BR> <BR>Exactly. And that's why I say &quot;ugliness&quot; has merit in text face design, because it's really only ugly at the deliberative level. At the immersive level it's <i>required</i> to make a text font &quot;click&quot; for real. <BR> <BR>(I wish Walter Tracy were alive, and a Typophiler&hellip;) <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">It seems to me that generally a text type should be artistically strong enough to work for display, if it is optically scaled (big sizes 'go on a diet' for display). In other words, the letter forms will still be identifiable as the same face at both sizes. It may not be great at display, but it should look pretty darn good. The only exceptions would be designs for very small sizes like Bell Centenial or Biblion, where there are extreme distortions for the sake of legibility at a very small size.  <BR> <BR>But the other way around doesn't work. There are excellent display types that won't work at all as text. There is an assymetry here.  <BR> <BR>I think Hrant is right that the two different kinds of reading are different, and for extended text the typeface must be able to become transparent. If it is so mannered that it cannot become transparent it will fail as text type.  <BR> <BR>But he is wrong in ignoring that we also look at that same text type in what he calls the 'deliberative' way. We aren't always immersed. We look at the page, the subheads, the first few words more slowly. We go in and out of immersion. That's why the aesthetics and flavor of the text type are important. Ugly is a liability in a text type also, in my opinion, unless it is absolutely tiny, so the legibility trumps every other consideration.   <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">This is a translate to Juan Pablo comment: <BR> <BR>Display, text&hellip;.wherever <BR> <BR>The truth is that i believe that the definitions falls in the way when you try to use them. <BR> <BR>Exist types(most of them publish here) who instead to have proportions of a high legibility, there are details who make them not too much legible. <BR> <BR>One day i listen a discusion of a group of typographers about clasify those typefaces. A dumb discussion about if their faces was for text, transition or moderns. <BR> <BR>This kind of discussions dont go to anywere. Better would be think in the grade of legibility who those typefaces have. <BR> <BR>For example, Swift have 96% of legibility, Times 87% and Not Caslon a 10%.  <BR> <BR>How we can calculate the percents in every font?. The ones who had study the mechanic of reading, can understand that, the most large saccadic jumps, the better working typeface for undestandable reading. <BR> <BR>Not Caslon in this example got the saccadic jumps in one type at once, inatead of Renard, who have many at the same time at once. <BR> <BR>JP <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; We go in and out of immersion. <BR> <BR>Totally. And yes, this means there's no such thing as a &quot;pure&quot; text face, so ugliness isn't everything - in fact I'm not proposing that a text face designer should make his font intentionally ugly! What I'm saying is that the decisions you take in a text face (because it needs to be highly immersive, something a display face does not need to be at all) automatically introduce an ugliness, so that becomes a feature, not a bug. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think an example is in order: <BR>A common early comment about my Patria is that the dot of the &quot;i&quot; is slightly too big. My reply? Yeeeees. :-) It's intentionally &quot;too big&quot; <i>aesthetically</i> because the dot is very important in readability. So in that way there's a small &quot;ugliness&quot; there, but one that only really shows up when you're looking deliberatively at the &quot;i&quot; (and usually at an unrealistically large size). However, Patria is still not ugly enough - although I think (and most people agree) that it's highly readable, it's not a &quot;real&quot; text face, the way I myself use the term. Pushing the acceptable limits of &quot;ugliness&quot; is the darkest corner of our craft, one that I hope to penetrate one day. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>
