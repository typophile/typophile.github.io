  body: Looks like something <a href="http://www.bertholdtypes.com/bq_library/90029.html"
    target="_blank"> Friedrich Poppl</a> might have designed. <BR>The UC &#39;G&#39;
    is spot-on, and some lc are quite similar if not <BR>for the lack of serifs. Unfortunately
    the UC &#39;S&#39; is waaay off.

  body: I think you got it, Yves &#40;Poppl Exquisit&#41;. Although it&#39;s hard
    to tell just from Berthold online samples :-/ . The &#34;S&#34; was probably customised.
