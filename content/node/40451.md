  them to historical figures, foods, altered words, and strings of meaningless sounds,
  but sometimes I'm stumped as to what to call a new font.\r\nWhat do you do?"

  body: I'm working on a couple right now that were inspired by the  outlook or attitude
    of two different organizations. One has a modern take on classical principles,
    the other has a totally forward-looking view, so the names of the faces are inspired
    by those two organizations.
