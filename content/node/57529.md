  illustration by Bar\u0131\u015F Sarhan (in collaboration with Ahmet Eken) for a
  Turkish graphic design magazine. \r\nI think it's a well made and somewhat funny
  illustration. They seem to be very serious about it as a visualization of the \"skeleton
  model\", as \"they have plans to make a scale model of the image to send to graphic
  design departments at various schools in Turkey\" (quoted from source below).\r\n\r\nFound

  body: "Ha. I'd love to taste something nice and meaty, like Cooper Black maybe.
    \r\nIn any case I expect Helvetica to be rather bland. \r\nOverall, I'm not sure
    about that black stuff, though. Do you think the shellac can be peeled off? Maybe
    it needs to be cracked open, like with seafood?"

    be housed in a compression chamber so the ambient air (the white) could play an
