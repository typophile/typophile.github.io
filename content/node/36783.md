body: "Greetings! \r\nI trust most of know fellow member Kris Sowersby? I'm a student
  of his pilot Typeface Design class at Massey University. I am in my final year of
  a 4 year Bachelor of Design degree and am currently doing my major (honours) project
  on expressive typography. Kris suggested starting a thread here since you guys could
  point me in some directions for research/inspiration or just general feedback and
  ideas. \r\n\r\nI'll outline my project for you:\r\n\r\n<strong>\"Can typography
  be used in an expressive and symbolic way to visually interpret/extrapolate meanings
  contained within the words of the Bible?\"\r\nTo test this I will  visually interpret/express
  the book of Job of the Bible.</strong>\r\n\r\nI'm looking for any examples of expressive
  typography that you know of that may help or relate to my project. I am especially
  on the look out for work that visually interprets a text (poetry for example) and
  feelings/atmospheres. It can be crazy and 'fine-artsy' as well! \r\n\r\nAny help
  would be hugely appreciated. Thanks a lot, and I hope to hang around for a while--Kris'
  type design paper has re-energised my love of typography.\r\n\r\n<em>EDIT: As an
  example of the kind of thing I'm looking at, Tomato's Mmmm... Skyscraper I Love
  You. I'm looking for work that's much cleaner and/or minimalist than that too.</em>"

    looking for, but he uses everyday phrases in a lot of his work, and the compositions
    are much more symbolic than literal.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.nga.gov/feature/ruscha/ruscha01.htm\r\n\r\nNiki"

    insight - and believe it or not - the work of Jean Michel Basquiat.

    his artwork for Radiohead during the OK Computer period. I like it, and some works
    are heavily typographic. Thanks Hiroshige."

  body: "Hi Scruggdesign, sorry as far as I know there are no links to anything related
    to the paper. Typeface Design hasn't been offered at Massey for years due to low
    numbers and/or no tutor available. This is the first time in [I don't know how
    long] it's been able to run thanks to Kris. In fact, it must have been quite a
    while because nobody has any records of past student work or project briefs or
    anything. \r\n\r\nFirst project was to create an upper case typeface, using Fontlab.
    We finished that a few weeks ago. Second project is to create a lower case. If
    you're curious I can post a copy of my upper case typeface for you to look at?\r\n\r\n<em>EDIT:
    In fact, I'll post it in the Critique section as I'm curious about where to go
    for the lower case.</em>"

  body: "Instead of an unusual/experimental font, have you considered expressing the
    suffering of Job in another way? His story strikes me as one of complete bleakness,
    darkness, and deprivation. Why not go Modernist/Minimal? Helvetica blind embossed
    into black paper? At first it might be orderly and robust, then it might start
    to wander and disperse, until finally the words are crawling across the page as
    if on the desert. But they are still Helvetica. \r\n\r\nH. Todd Duren, \r\ndesigner.

  body: Hi Todd, great idea thanks a lot. I wasn't intending on using unusual/experimental
    <em>fonts</em>, more the compositions and how the type is treated. Your suggestion
    is exactly the kind of thing I'm looking for.

    and I regret that this post is a link to my own work. That said, I think I've
    a couple examples that somewhat match what you're looking for. At the end of freshman
    foundation year, I got into interpreting text with hand-drawn letters for 2D Design.
    \r\n\r\nThis uses a passage from Milton's Paradise Lost that describes Eden. \r\n\r\nhttp://flickr.com/photos/jabzug/824289913/\r\n\r\nAnd

  body: "If you have access to (really) older issues of Eye Magazine, you should try
    to get EYE 20/96. There's an article in there called 'Concrete poems just are',
    which is about poems that are typeset in a way that supports the meaning of the
    poem (that description doesn't really do justice to the article). I think it might
    be of interest to you, given your project outline.\r\n\r\nIf you can't get it,
    I can scan it for you, although I only have photocopies myself."
