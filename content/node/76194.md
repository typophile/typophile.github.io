  not happening for me this time. It looks like a lot of fonts all jammed into one.
  Avenir, Helvetica, Avant Garde etc. Any help would save my bacon.\r\n\r\n$20 to
  the victor?\r\n\r\n<strong>Key thing to pay attention to:</strong>\r\n\r\nAngle
  of where the ends of the C stop\r\nShape of the center of the R and where it's leg
  comes down\r\nIndented middled lines on the E and F\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/creative_5688.png]"

    Bold]], although the C looks extended. May just be the grungy treatment.

  body: While it's not Interstate that led me down the hunt some more. I ended up
    just using Avenir as the base and modified it accordingly. Thanks.
