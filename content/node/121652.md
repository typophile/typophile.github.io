  in the PBS 1971 identity, or is there a similar font that look like the PBS Push-Pin
  font? I would really want this font if there are any digital versions of the Push-Pin
  font. Any reply will be appreciated!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1132_4419.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/images_3550.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/13WNET_5840.jpeg]"

  body: It bears similarities with Pump and Blippo and other Bauhaus-inspired typefaces,
    but also with some heavy art deco types like PAG Smoke, Mostra Nuova and Eagle.
