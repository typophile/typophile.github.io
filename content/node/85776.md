  tension between the two</blockquote>\r\n\r\nApparantly this was \u201Ca technique
  epitomized in Electra, a 1935 bookface by twentieth-century master W.A. Dwiggins\u201D\r\n\r\nCan
  anyone please explain what this means exactly. I can't really picture this and don't
  notice it in trying to study Electra."

    and then curved]] thread from 2008 (the same quotation is referenced there). There's
    much there on Dwiggins. But if that's the reference, I can see it a bit, like
    here at the bottom of Prensa's italic /t/\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/8596e7039d3da971cc8f94382414b3_6087.gif]\r\nbut
    I wouldn't call it the most salient feature of Electra nor Prensa. "

    and reminiscent enough to warrant having around. \r\n\r\nI'm still waiting (no
    doubt others are, too) for a faithful Electra revival. If we ever get a well-done
    Fairfield as well, it'll be a watershed moment (for me, anyway.)"

  body: "<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ohbendy/5943111278/\">This</a> may
    shed some light.\r\n\r\nI gather Dwiggins arrived at this M-formula by paying
    special attention to the bits of the letters that get lost at small sizes or at
    a distance. I'm not sure what printing process he would have been proofing with
    however.\r\n\r\nI can kind of see the idea of wrapping the outside around the
    inside on the /g/ where the two closed counters seem to take their starting point
    from the middle counterspace, which is on the outside of the letter."

  body: "I think the aspect that Cyrus was responding to, which he characterized as
    \u201Cwrapping outside curves around the inside,\u201D is slightly different than
    what WAD was expressing with his M-formula memo. (Note: Dwiggins never used this
    \u201Cwrapping\u201D language, not that I recall ever encountering in his letters
    anyway.)\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s all generally related, of course, because Dwiggins was
    a multi-faceted thinker; but what Cyrus calls \u201Ctension\u201D I believe Dwiggins
    would have referred as \u201Csnap\u201D or \u201Caction.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe thinking
    that lead to the M-formula memo only crystallized several years after Electra
    (and never found successful expression in any of his completed typefaces). I would
    say the M-formula is a subset of Dwiggins\u2019s broader explorations of Action
    in type.\r\n\r\nI\u2019d have to go back to my files to find his letters discussing
    Action. I don\u2019t think I have any of them transcribed.\r\n\r\nBut I\u2019m
    preparing to travel tomorrow and in the middle of a big project, so I don\u2019t
    have time to pursue right now. Sorry."

    \r\nMaybe because in some cases the \"cut\" might imply a crossover from inside
