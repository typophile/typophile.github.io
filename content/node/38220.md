  body: "I'm partial to images 3 (by Oscar Bjarnason) and 5 (by Mark Sanders)... \r\n\r\nBut
    come on, was this \"branding\" even necessary? People already <em>know</em> they're
    cabs... Duh!\r\n\r\nI think that what they've done is overkill: a pictogram of
    a man hailing a taxi, on top of the already bold \"NYC\" and the T in a black
    circle? Harumph, harumph.\r\n\r\nPlus, they took Smart Design's proposal and kept
    changing it... No wonder the result is awful."
