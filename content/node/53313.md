body: "I am starting a photography business and I need my type solution critiqued.
  I am with the icon since I use it for my graphic design business. I would like to
  have a sans serif with more character, but I know it can't have too much because
  it has to match the strength of the icon.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LOGO_4286.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nTom"

    you have a budget for type?\r\n\r\nMikey :-)"

  body: I think you are right to go with something that suggests it was drawn with
    the same monoline as your icon... consider <a href="http://www.dstype.com/estilo.html">Estilo</a>
    for lots of options in how much character to inject.

  body: Good choice, Tom. I didn't get in the thread until you were done. The forms
    of the round characters feel more at home with your logo's aesthetic features.

  body: The icon looks like a 1950s [[http://a.abcnews.com/images/WNT/ht_viewmaster_061109_ssv.jpg|View-Master]]
    to me. Is that intentional? It was the first thing I noticed -- it really jumped
    out. I get the T and C, but still...

  body: I didn't get that impression Gus. I like almost anything retro and I am sure
    I am influenced by it. I like to blend retro and modern (when I can) to make them
    look cohesive.
