body: "I need suggestions for a modern font for a business magazine masthead. The
  magazine profiles successful local businesses and is distributed to business people.\r\n\r\nThe
  masthead consists of two words stacked together on top of the word BUSINESS. The
  letter S appears numerous times in all three words.\r\n\r\nWe are currently considering
  either Gotham Book or Eurostile. Any suggestions of alternatives and also a body
  copy font that matches would be greatly appreciated. I'll post a reply with the
  fonts we go with."

  body: "With a focus on local businesses, I think Gotham is too generic, and Eurostile
    is too... 80s Europe. :-)\r\n\r\nWhat about this: http://ernestinefont.com/\r\nIt's
    flavorful, strong and honest, and reads great (including onscreen).\r\n(Disclaimer:
    I had a hand in it.)\r\n\r\nI'll suggest some others soon.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    Gotham or Open Sans for body copy?\r\n"
