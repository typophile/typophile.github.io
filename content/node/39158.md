  as seen in this image from an old Letraset catalogue. I know Elsner+Flake have drawn
  an alternate version of Avant Garde, but they don't seem to have got round to LG
  yet.\r\nCan anyone help?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DSCF3336_6174.JPG]"

  body: Lubalin put the ligatures in as an aid to his own predilection for doing tightly
    spaced, fully justified headlines. The ligatures were a design solution to the
    problem of making two or more lines of type come out to the same length without
    changing spacing, size or proportions.
