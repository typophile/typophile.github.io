  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">{For recent arrivals: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/604.html?1010023399">http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/604.html?1010023399</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->} <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OK, so I've been thinking about this some more, and I realized that the original honorware idea suffered from one major problem: it was *too* pro-user, at the expense of turning off most designers. I firmly believe that there should be a way to get many more people to pay *something* (something less than the &quot;full price&quot;, depending on their personal circumstances/disposition), but nobody should get the font completely free (even though piracy is unavoidable to a large extent), and also we should &quot;reward&quot; people who are willing/able to pay full price. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So here's what I came up with - I'll explain through a quick example: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Let's say a font is $100 for somebody who just buys it, but it's $125 for people who want to pay in let's say 5 monthly installments: they'd need to pay the first installment to get the font ($25), but then the &quot;honor-factor&quot; would kick in, and they would pay the rest over time, or &quot;cancel&quot; at any time. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->One side benefit (which however never bothered me too much personally anyway) is that this is really no longer Shareware. It's something in between (and maybe &quot;honorware&quot; is no longer the ideal term - but &quot;hybridware&quot; stinks), and that's why I think it strikes a realistic balance. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->-Hrant</div>

But hey, it's been two months. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Anyway, I read through about half the posts in the thread Honorware and I haven't noticed anything negative.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It seems like a good idea. Although I don't see many foundry people backing it either. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What happens if I buy a font for a week. Design a logo within the week.

See below, right below. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Second question: What's preventing foundries from using technology to allow people to comp fonts? <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Let us pay a small amount to download the font and try it for maybe two weeks or a month. And have the font expire after that period. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The foundries don't lose out at all, right?  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I often wonder: Are foundries more worried that their fonts will become too common or that no one would use them at all? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Because this comping method gives designers far more choices. They can make interesting and appropriate type choices and that means no one font would be overused. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Does anyone see any flaws?

		<div class="commentbody">I mean that it <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is<!-- raw HTML omitted --> allowed. The reason that honoware would work is because it doesn't rely on [unenforceable] law, it relies on &quot;automatic&quot; ethics - which is in fact amplified by the absence of legal pressure. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Trust<!-- raw HTML omitted --> enters the equation, to the [psychological] advantage of the font seller. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; users are expected to pay more for a font when they actually use it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Not really. Users are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->expected<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to pay for having the font. Period.

So in your case if about 1/5 to 1/4 of the full price of the font is a &quot;small fee&quot;, then we're set. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; How do they do it now for demo versions of software? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But fonts aren't really software - they're data. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And demo software has functionality disabled through internal coding. What functionalities can a font have disabled while remaining usable/testable, and more importantly, how do you get the OS (or something like ATM) to implement it?

But it's not here, so here goes again: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->_________________ <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Since any changes to font pricing need to be driven by the foundries, the proposed system needs to be more pro-foundry. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So Stuart's idea is brilliant. Technology is the most obvious solution to this problem. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And since you could be right about the big companies not being corrupt and therefore uninterested in working on a solution, we need a third party software developer who will sell the service to the foundries. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Some foundries will embrace it because they see an additional revenue stream from subscriptions.

		<div class="commentbody">I'm not certain I understand your point of view . . . My assumption was that we were exploring a method which we can distribute typefaces with an honor system in mind that will be both friendly to both the end user and foundry and something easy for both as well since the idea of a font subscriptions came up. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Generally, this is being done currently as Shareware - eg. You use this freely available font and if you use it commercially, you pay for it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Upon further review of the first post , I see a more affordable payment method for the end user but it is predicated on smaller regular payments and only the first one is required and the remaining are on the honor system. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think what must be defined is the &quot;terms&quot; of this system. Certainly there is a point in which the end user isn't comping with the fonts any longer and should purchase the font to produce a final piece with. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It's at that point we'd want compensation for the face. So, how do we accept compensation? A recurring subscription amount? A one time flat fee? A one time tiered fee? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->At this point what we are looking at is a visit to a candy store where you actually get to lick each flavor as long as you wish but when you decide you're ready to &quot;own&quot; a peice of candy you may or may not do so at your whim. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Honorware is still pro user because there isn't an effective method to accommodate both parties. What method would you propose to the foundry? Not to be greedy, but sincerly there isn't any defined method of compensation for the foundry. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don't agree we're debating human nature, we're simply exploring yet another distribution method and I must remind you that distribution means: ordering, payment, fulfillment. Those parts must be addressed for any distribution system to be effective. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stuart :D</div>

Also, a font house could decide that there are benefits to full payment, like support, or free upgrades (like extended character sets and such). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The whole point of Honorware is to be <!-- raw HTML omitted -->flexible<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, without having to negotiate the price with each party - which is inefficient, and disconcerting to those who end up paying more.

		<div class="commentbody"><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;&gt; &hellip;. without paying for it. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; Sure. Now, what's the best way to reduce that?<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I was thinking of something like this: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(To recap, the font never actually resides on the user's machine. The site works with a font management software to manage the subscription as well.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1. We need to differentiate people who really want to demo the font from those who might be up to no good. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->At the risk of over simplifying, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* Really want to demo the font = having the font for a short period and subscribing to it for the first time. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* May be up to no good = subscribing to the same font again and again and having it for a longer period. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2. We need to track subscriptions to do that, so all subscribers need a user account. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3. We want to prevent people from setting up more than one account and screwing with the tracking. So give them some kind of goodies or loyalty points keep them honest. (Same concept as &quot;gifting&quot; in honorware, but here we rely on a mixture of greed and ethics for it to work.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->4. Pricing structure works like this (for now, but I am sure there is a proper actuary-based way to structure it.): <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If you subscribe to a font for the first time and need it only for a  very short period (24 / 48 hours), you pay a very small amount, maybe &lt;5% of the full price. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If you need it for a week or so, then the subscription fee goes up to maybe about 50% of the price. This makes it cheaper for you to buy the font if you need it for a period of two weeks or so. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But this is also where foundries can decide whether they want to use the subscription model as a demo-ing tool or as a true subscription tool.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If they use it as a subscription tool then they can have a flat monthly rate, higher than the preferential first month demo rate.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Right now, I'm trying to find loopholes in this (subscription) model, so you'll have to ignore that fact that none of this is technologically possible right now.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; The bottom line is that you cannot antagonize those wielding the power: users.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You simply have more to gain by asking nicely.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->From where I am, it looks like the foundries are the guys wielding the power and they won't let us try out the fonts before buying them. They're saying here's how abecedary look at 48pts, and here's The quick brown fox&hellip; at 24 points. Now buy it if you like it. And really, that sucks.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; What do we want?<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I just want to comp fonts the way I use them, not in an artifical, no-kerning, limited character environment. It's not the money I'm after, but I need to convince the foundries that there is more money in it for them when they allow people to try out their fonts, even for a short period. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->After reading your description of honorware point again, I am starting to see your point. But you face an insurmountable task of convincing foundries to adopt the honorware system.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That's why I came up with this convoluted, currently impossible system. If we are convinced that it'll work, then there's money to be made by the software developer as well, someone like Extensis Suitcase. All that's left to do it to convince someone to build it. But we first need to know whether or not a scheme like this could work.</div>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know of anybody doing it yet. Maybe because it seems too complicated, and a seller will either want all the money up front or none of it ever. But the complexity of the honorware model is: a reflection of the complexity of human nature; and implicit, not explicit, meaning that it&rsquo;s structurally pretty simple, and deep down only as complex as a given case needs it to be.</p>
<p>In that other thread* Ray claims that small font families don&rsquo;t seem to benefit much from the giving away of one style; in such cases the honorware model might be the best way to give sales a push.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">My idea: distribute a font with some intentional defects, but full metrics, for free, and provide a pay-per-converted-letter (maybe multiplied by letter size) conversion facility on the net that will substitute the free letters in ps or pdf files with the commercial letters. There might also be an option to subscribe for some period, and different prices for commercial/non-commercial use, discounts for longer texts etc. &ndash; cs</div>
