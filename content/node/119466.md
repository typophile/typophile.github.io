  body: 'To me it''s either done from scratch or a so heavily customized font that
    probably nobody would be able to identify it. That helpless comment said, if you
    still need to recreate it, I guess it''d be quicker to recreate it as it''s only
    made with 2 shapes: half of an arch (x4 for /m, x2 for /a) and a corner (x1 for
    /r and x3 for /g + a spur).'

    out for positive id. That said I guess I'll give recreating it a shot.\r\n\r\n"
