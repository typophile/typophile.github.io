  body: "<blockquote>Now just got find $175 :( Thats expensive!!</blockquote>\r\nThat's
    really depends on what you need exactly. If this is for commercial project and
    you definitely believe it is the perfect one, it's worth $175. But I understand
    if you only need one weight, it's a shame to have to pay for the all package (same
    problem with Hoefler and Frere Jones fonts). I don't know if it could work but
    you could try to ask gently to House Industries to sell you the weight(s) you
    need. You could also try to convince your client this is the One and to buy it
    for the project.\r\n<blockquote>Don't suppose anyone has an alternative. Mmmm</blockquote>\r\nChalet
    is very close to Helvetica so if you have time and skills, you could try to customize
    it to fit your needs. You could for instance start from [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/helvetica/helveticatextbook-roman|Helvetica
    Textbook]] or [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-schulbuch|FF Schulbuch]]
    to get a single storey /a. But still a lot of work on /t, /y... There's also [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/coolvetica|Coolvetica]]
    and some freebies like [[http://www.dafont.com/clemente-pd.font|Clemente]], [[http://www.dafont.com/lane.font|Lane]]
    or [[http://www.dafont.com/walkway.font|Walkway]]. But they could never be considered
    as substitutes. They're simply \"close to Helvetica\" as Chalet. "
