  crashes whenever I scroll down and that page becomes visible. I\u2019ve cleaned
  the app and system font caches, that\u2019s not fixing things. Does anyone have
  any suggestions for getting this file working again, or should I just start over
  from an older version?"

  body: Try opening up a second document with the same properties, then in your first
    doc, select all the pages in you pages palate, then drag them into the new document.
    This has fixed some problems for me in the past, not sure if i've ever dealt with
    a corrupt file such as that before...

  body: I'd suggest exporting the document to an InDesign Exchange [INX] file, then
    open that INX file and re-save it.

  body: Try copying from the problem document into a new document (of course, if there
    are a huge number of pages, it's probably best working from an older version).
