    know the name off hand. [BTW the sexist cover illustration is by Frank Frazetta.]\r\nF

    on r and s are close to the mystery lettering,  and it's a connected font.\r\nCombine
    Sansita and Salut and we are starting to generate a match.\r\nDon"

  body: You  guys are awesome. I could picture Salut in my mind, I knew I had seen
    it but I didn't know the name. I'll try it a try but please let me know if you
    think of something else.

  body: "Interestingly, Nick's naming of Unicorn was surely derived from Alan Meeks'
    reworking of Salut - which he called Einhorn. I wonder why, when Unicorn is clearly
    based on Salut rather than Einhorn.\r\n\r\nhttp://old.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/einhorn/"

    most everything you write on this forum with interest.
