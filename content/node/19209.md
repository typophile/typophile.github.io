  their apps to Universal I'm wondering how many of you are waiting that long and
  how many are ditching Adobe.\r\n\r\nFor my 2\xA2 I'm less and less dependent on
  Adobe with each job. So it's rather unlikely that I'll hold my breath. How about
  you?\r\n\r\ncan someone turn this into a poll somehow? I don't see that option here."

    its not like we are going to use imacs or powerbooks in a production environment.

  body: What would I ditch Adobe for? I need OT-deature support. I don't think that
    I'd be willing to try and typeset brochures with Mellel.

    to something other than Adobe's offerings. I'm the kind of guy that actually tries
    out apps like Inkscape, GIMP, Scribus, FontForge, etc. so I know where there at.
    I applaud their work, but to simply say they lack feature parity with Adobe products
    would be an understatement. \r\nAdobe knows their business, and aquiring Macromedia
    was probably one of the smartest things they could have done. They bought out
    their closest competition.\r\n\r\nFrank are you one of those people that does
    all their typsetting in TeX?"

  body: "The TeX, publisher and Mellel comments cracked me up :)\r\n\r\nI'm actually
    on again with the Quark beta for typesetting parts as they didn't sleep-in. For
    Photoshop I'm using Cinepaint since some months now as Photshop's wimpy 16-Bit
    support doesn't quite cut it with real color correction, especially when you need
    to do the work on 32-Bit float images or higher, like bringing down HDRI files.\r\n\r\nI
    basically only use photoshop to add type to the final images, or to do title plates
    to integrate with Cinepaint or Final Cut.\r\n\r\nI tried Inkscape and quickly
    got bored. Xara seems to have topped Illustrator a while ago, but spending a day
    installing it? naah!\r\n\r\n@ Miguel: I got in late with X on production machines
    since virtually nothing was there, but with the Intel machines I only have very
    few apps that I need that aren't ported yet. I'm actually looking forward to be
    running my X11 apps in virtualization mode.\r\n\r\nSo until Xara has something
    installable out I'll stick with Illustrator. Photoshop might be still around for
    backwards compatibility with my archives. Pages is becoming more powerful with
    each update, I'm doing all of my letters and invoices with it now. Might be a
    real layout app soon. \r\n\r\nAlso I'm wondering if Adobe has a huge interest
    in Mac native versions anymore since virtualization and bootcamp. They were having
    a hard time with OS-X right from the start so that'll be interesting to watch.\r\n\r\nProduction
    machines, Aether? Did you actually work on a new iMac yet? I was very surprised
    how well it handles HD content, didn't try film res yet on one of those."

    OSX Intel CoreDuo Powerbook, so its the best of both worlds.  The only drawback
    here is software licencing.\r\n\r\nThe Mac is still fresh, so i havent had a lot
    of time to test it through Rosetta.  From all reports its sluggish at best, but
    so long as its not the primary environment, then i cant imagine major dramas.\r\n\r\nStill
    fairly fresh to the industry, applications like Quark are something i've never
    had to meddle with. Snicker if you will at my naiveity, but i cant imagine ever
    needing anything beyond the CS suite for print/web design.  They really have got
    all bases covered, and integration is getting better and better.\r\n"

    be nails all over the house just begging to be banged back into the floor boards.\r\nRemember
    that every machine and application that you buy is already obsolete because the
    successor is under development. To date no software development schedule has ever
    \ led to having any of my jobs cancelled or delayed. So I just don't worry about
    what's coming when. It is not the platform or application that determines the
    result. It is the interface of task and user. One just does the job with what
    one has. When the tool is no longer capable of the task, then I look for new stuff.
    Oh yes, I also make it a principle to never buy a new car."
