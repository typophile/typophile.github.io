body: "Hey, everyone.\r\n\r\nI cannot for the life of me find a particular font. Judging
  from the way it looks, I figured it would be easy to locate, but it appears I was
  wrong. I'm currently trying to update one of my father's album covers (he's a musician),
  and the only instance of the cover with the preferred font is very small. My goal
  was to remove the font from the higher resolution version I have and replace it
  with the new font, if I can find it. I've attached an image of what it looks like.
  Apologies for the low quality, but unfortunately it's the only two instances of
  the font I can provide. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/bvxk2knv copy_3706.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks,
  guys. Hope someone knows where I can find this thing and what it is!"

    body: That is very close! Though the curves on the J and the C are somewhat different.
      As well as the font being a bit thinner than that. I am pretty sure the company
      which produced the cover didn't use a custom font, so this variation must be
      out there somewhere.

  body: "Obviously, the variation is out there: the real question is, is a digital
    version of this typeface out there? There are literally hundreds\u2014if not thousands\u2014of
    typefaces with this casual style which were once available as phototype which
    haven't been converted to digital."

  body: "Ernst, I think your hunch is correct. MegaMac: try to find the original,
    which is likely to be a commercial font (but probably not too expensive). That
    way you wouldn't be supporting somebody who's leeching off people. Not to mention
    that the original is probably higher quality so won't give you headaches.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    great. Truly a collection of typophiles. Thanks, guys!

  body: Arctic appears in the Solotype catalog. Digitizations include the unattributed
    one cited above as well as those by  Fantazia, Sam Wang and Reasonable Solutions,
    and, under other names,  Marlo (A&L/ComputerServices) and Garfield (Brendel).
    It was a Photolettering typeface named Rambler Brush Light.     Note that all
    of these "foundries" are known for questionable copies. But there doesn't seem
    to be any digitizations from more respectable sources.  - Herb
