  body: Was about to say "too close to be a coincidence so probably custom based on
    Eurostile Condensed Heavy" when I encountered with [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/juraj-chrastina/valibuk|Valibuk]].
    Could be it...

  body: "Thanks a lot Ryuk!\r\nI just had a look at Valibuk and it's definitely slightly
    different :\r\nOn the font I've submitted, the horizontal curve on the \"h\" is
    flatten and so are the vertical curves on the \"0\" and \"c\". Also, the hole
    shape on the \"a\" is different. \r\nBut it's very very close!"
