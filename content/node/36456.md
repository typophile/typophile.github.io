  phone numbers any other way than 514 123-4567.\r\n\r\nI had spiced things a bit
  with 514.123.4567 in a new design, but Noooooo I am not allowed to present phone
  numbers that way in the French version of the booklet because we follow the rules
  of the Office de la langue fran\xE7aise, and *they* say phone numbers must not be
  presented any other way. \r\n\r\nI'm so annoyed with this. It's stupid, it's silly,
  but where is the boundary between language and design? I understand language-specific
  punctuation and hyphenation etc...  it's necessary. But phone numbers? \r\n\r\nGgggrrrrrrrrr.
  \r\n\r\n/off to do some find and replace."

    cool though. Don\u2019t lose heart.\r\n\r\n;^)"

    consistent.  :-)

  body: "It reminds me of a job I had once...\r\n\r\nI had a really fabulous assignment
    to design one of those educational \"wall charts\" for a national laboratory --
    you know, those dense things that are hanging on the wall of your science class
    in high school? The design process unfortunately included regular meetings with
    a large group of government bureaucrats and scientists. One day, well into the
    project, the panel ganged up on me to insist I change the typeface used throughout
    (Myriad MM) to some kind of font with serifs, because \"fonts with serifs are
    more readable.\" Despite the fact that the overall design required a wide range
    of weights and widths, and consisted mostly of short text passages, I could not
    dissuade them from the idea that \"serifs are always better.\"\r\n\r\n(Somewhat
    fortunately, soon after, I was forced out of my job through a spectacular political
    showdown that gave me the rare opportunity to tell a particularly odious bureaucrat,
    to their face, \"Well then I will just have to quit!\" Ah, the memories. Someone
    else finished the wall chart.)"

  body: "I am not, actuslly, invested in the one presentation or the other. In other,
    less trendy, publications we've used (514) 123-4567. This would not be acceptable
    to them, either. \r\n\r\nMy beef is that I just don't see how this is a language
    issue. To me it's a style preference. You don't like it? I'm cool with that. Tell
    me you just plain don't like it or give me reasons. But don't tell me that the
    government says that there is only one correct way to present phone numbers in
    French.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    555 555-5555\r\n\r\nDesign is just as much about not reinventing the wheel as
    it is being creative and new. A phone number is a basic bit of data and sticking
    with the tried-and-true format isn't all bad.\r\n\r\n"

  body: As a protest find the official rules and do something that's within them but
    totally stupid - maybe use Hindi numerals, or pick a font that's impossible to
    read, or maybe set the dash subscript at a smaller type size - stay within their
    silly rule while subverting it.

  body: "I'm not sure if I agree with sticking to tried-and-true. Most of times, tried-and-true
    are just people staying in their comfort zone. But you can still communicate outside
    your comfort zone. When people complain to me about something like that, I say
    \"can you read it?\" or \"Did you understand it?\", or even \"Would you be able
    to make a call to that number?\"\r\n\r\nThat usually gets the true reason out
    on why they want things this or that way, and most of the time is about personal
    taste.\r\n\r\nI prefer the way you designed, with the dots. More elegant and super
    clear, not mentioning consistent."

  body: "My not-very-expert opinion is that in design very little boils down to \"rules\".
    Most of it is personal preference and consensus. \r\n\r\nTried and true reigns
    at this institution -- or I should say unquestioned tradition. And I can deal
    with it. Most of the time. I nod and smile and bite my tongue, but lately I've
    been wanting better answers for why we do things a certain way. \"Because we've
    always done it that way\" is just not very convincing.\r\n\r\nWe now have one
    style for phone numbers in English text and one style for phone numbers in French
    text. This confuses me (why??????) and makes more work for me. \r\n\r\nI changed
    all the French to what the translation department wanted. The English have already
    gone off to print, and so they won't get changed from the (514) 123-4567 format
    to the 514-123-4567 that our marketing communications department wants. Too bad,
    but I'm not sure I really care that much. \r\n\r\nNo, I don't have CS3. I have
    CS2. :(\r\n\r\nI was having a very frustrating day, and I don't know any better
    place to come for understanding and venting than here. You guys get me through
    the day sometimes! \r\n\r\nI have had a very frustrating couple of months. I've
    often wondered if I'm becoming a monkey who knows the software instead of a designer
    and editor who just might possibly know a little bit more about the job than administrative
    secretaries and assistants. The phone numbers are not important. They were just
    the proverbial cherry. \r\n\r\nSome days I want to clean houses for rich families
    in Westmount. The salary would be about the same. I'd be following orders. I'm
    detail-oriented--I can polish silverware. The main difference is I wouldn't feel
    that my skills and knowledge were being crushed, or worse, ignored. And I'd have
    dry hands and broken nails instead of bad eyes and back pain.\r\n\r\nWhaddyall
    think? Time for a career change? \r\n\r\n/off to drink my troubles away. ;)"
