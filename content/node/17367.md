    to their comments:\r\n\r\n\r\nTiffany:\r\n\r\nI have attached a PDF with some
    variations on the lowercase t. Which reads best to you?\r\n\r\nI like your suggestion
    about keeping the font for personal use. It has actually been used once already
    in the new logo I created for the design firm I work for. I'll post a link when
    we unveil the new logo.\r\n\r\n\r\nM\xE5rten:\r\n\r\nOriginally my intention was
    to create a font with only squares and wedges. The challenge came when I came
    to the 3, 8 and &. I applied the hybrid shape to the w and W. I think that helps
    lighten them up some. I've attached a PDF - let me know what you think.\r\n"

  body: "The lc_t in the file ty_psychology_02.pdf reads correct.\r\n\r\n- What if
    you remove the gap in your ampersand? Does it need that space?\r\n- What if the
    bottom facet on the question mark was moved to the right side instead?\r\n- What
    if the bottom facet on the exclamation mark was also curved like the question
    mark?\r\n- What if the bottom right facet on the lc_z was flopped?\r\n\r\nStill
    fun."

  body: "(Please refer to ty_psychology_03.pdf)\r\n\r\nTiffany:\r\n\r\nI removed the
    gap in the ampersand. In theory I would like for the shapes to be closer together,
    but I'm not sure that it reads better this way. Seeing both of them, do you think
    it needs a space?\r\n\r\nTake a look at the question mark. Is this what you meant?
    I think it falls apart at this point.\r\n\r\nI changed the bottom facet on the
    exclamation mark. I like it better. Strangely, it kind of looks like lipstick.\r\n\r\nWhat
    do you think about the z? It's kind of interesting like this. Not sure it is as
    clear of a z.\r\n\r\nThanks for all of your comments."

  body: It works fine with the hybrid shape. Interesting how characters based on such
    a small grid can look almost ornamented or 'flowery'.

    I've made since ty_psychology_01.pdf and the second is a list of concerns that
    I still have with ty_psychology_04.pdf   Please give your thoughts on my concerns.\r\n\r\nChanges
    Made: \r\n\r\n- flipped lowercase t across verticle axis\r\n- flipped lowercase
    t's bottom right wedge across verticle axis\r\n- added hybrid shape to W\r\n-
    added hybrid shape to w\r\n- narrowed the gap in &\r\n- made the bottom facet
    of exlamation mark rounded\r\n\r\nRemaining Concerns:\r\n\r\n- Is the G too bulky?\r\n-
    Does the K look top heavy?\r\n- Is the T too wide?\r\n- Is the W still too heavy?\r\n-
    Does the X look top heavy?\r\n- Should I add additional characters to the set?
    If so, which ones?\r\n"

  body: "Ty,\r\n\r\nAll changes and correction to now are improvements. I think. \r\n\r\n-
    z - crazy character either way. I prefer the latest version, but could see instances
    where the other might work better.\r\n\r\n- ! - Love it.\r\n\r\n- X - Is it upside
    down?\r\n\r\n- G - Not bulky.\r\n\r\n- K - Might be upside down too.\r\n\r\nLigatures?
    Crazy if it worked."

  body: "I've added a file entitled \"ty_psychology_05.pdf\"  I have added an extra
    row at the bottom of the file with ideas for changes:\r\n\r\n\u2022 lowercase
    l - It would look the same as the uppercase I (eye) and number 1, but I thought
    it helped the flow and perhaps will make future ligatures easier\r\n\r\n\u2022
    uppercase K - It becomes top heavy instead of bottom heavy. I think it's an improvement\r\n\r\n\u2022
    three capital Xs - I'm leaning to the last of the three, as unusual as it looks\r\n\r\n\u2022
    fi ligature - I decided to attempt a ligature. I'm not sure what others would
    work\r\n\r\n\u2022 star shape - Simply a decorative element that I thought looked
    interesting\r\n\r\n\r\nThoughts?"

    I'm sure once you start making words you'll notice others things. \r\n\r\n- X
    - 4th glyph from the left, bottom row is working. \r\n- fi - crazy! \r\n- star
    - nice touch\r\n\r\nThe fun of this will be, like I just said, when you do go
    to use it. You'll be able to keep it modular and move bits around to work better
    within word shapes. \r\n"

  body: "This is a funny design :) I like the idea, and it's very well done. I haven't
    looked at it before, so I can tell what doesn't work for me on first glimpse:\r\n\r\n-
    H  (can't tell why, but I didn't recognise it)\r\n- i: no dot? What about mirroring
    the upper part upwards (so there is a quarter circle with the round part on the
    lower left side)?\r\n- j: like i?\r\n- z: what if the upper left block was a square?\r\n\r\nI
    think things like & and fi-lig work if they stand alone (i like the idea to do
    such things), but I don't believe that they will within words. And i fear that
    they would disturb the recognizability of the other letters, as there are \"unknown\"
    elements between them, making the viewer insecure about the rest.\r\n\r\nI like
    the alternative W better, but I would stick with the old M.\r\n\r\nThe hybrid
    element is an excellent idea. And I specially like the \"flaming\" characters
    like E, F or N."

    know if it would). But it's you being the designer, and you know best about the
    system the design follows.

    more. HOWEVER, because the shape is so heavy it doesn't balance with the lowercase."
