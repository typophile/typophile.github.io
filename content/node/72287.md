body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm currently redesigning a magazine for a client who has a very
  low budget (almost non-existent). I'm at the stage of deciding which fonts to use
  for body copy. I don't think I'll get anywhere with free fonts, hence I chose Museo
  Sans for display and captioning. I'd like to look into alternatives for similar
  prices as the Exljbris 'free' fonts ($15-30 per weight).\r\n\r\nI like Calluna,
  but I'd prefer it if the magazine didn't end up looking like an Exljbris specimen.\r\n\r\nHas
  anyone ever worked with a good, usable, cheap serif font for body copy use in a
  long document like a magazine or book?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nJono"

    font. For precisely the reasons Jan mentioned. I expect italics and other weights
    as it's for setting an entire magazine with, so I fully expect to pay. The budget
    is limited tho, so something under $30 a weight would be good."

  body: All of the 5 "free fonts" mentioned here come in four weights at least, but
    you didn't even bother googling them to check yourself. Is the notion that "free
    font" == "bad font" that deep into design culture?

  body: "But what you said earlier contradicts this, all the free fonts (free and
    open source) mentioned here are quality fonts, much much better than any commercial
    font you can get for 33$, even on of them were done by a large well known foundry
    (Liberation by Monotype for Red Hat), still you are comparing them to other poor
    \"free\" fonts.\r\n\r\nAs a free/libre/open source font developer, I feel insulted
    by such attitude, hence my angry tone."

  body: "Khaled,\r\n\r\nThere's a difference between quality and suitable. I looked
    at the fonts and didn't think any of them were suitable for the look of the magazine
    I'm working on. Gentium comes closest, and is a good font, just not quite what
    I feel would suit my content. Lido on the other hand looks much better, and is
    only $19/weight. \r\n\r\nSo when you say the open source fonts are 'much much
    better than any commercial font you can get for 33$' you're wrong. It's all about
    context, which you and your angry tone seemed to be forgetting. \r\n\r\nDo us
    all a favour and keep your anger to yourself. It's incredibly rude to say to someone
    'you didn't even bother googling them to check yourself' when you have no idea
    about what I did or didn't do. Arrogance and anger will get you and your fonts
    nowhere."

    all. If he had asked the question I would have answered it with the explanation
    I just gave. I should have explained my full reasons for not using the free fonts,
    but at least I didn't get angry about things.

    statements struck me as much angrier and more terse than Khaled's. He just made
    an assumption, and his following remark wasn't even pointed at you specifically.
    I didn't find his comment condescending or arrogant in the least.\r\n\r\nOn the
    other hand, remarks like:\r\n\r\n-<em>I'm not sure I can be bothered with your
    tone and your weird rhetorical questions.</em>\r\n-<em>Do us all a favour and
    keep your anger to yourself. </em>\r\n-<em> I think it's time you relaxed,</em>\r\n\r\n...strike
    me as very pointedly condescending. As if you're so much better because you know
    how to \"keep your cool\" online. Add to that the sarcasm:\r\n\r\n-<em>Deep breaths,
    calm thoughts, my fonts are good, my fonts are good, my fonts are good...</em>\r\n\r\n...honestly,
    I think Khaled is being much more cordial than you.\r\n\r\nJust my two cents.
    Good luck with your magazine."

  body: "@ mrjono\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/person/Dino_dos_Santos/\r\n\r\nBut
    if you decide for a DSType font, I would ask here about the quality of the kerning.
    The quality of the kerning varies from font to font. In case of Capsa (which I
    like very much) it is good in my opinion, but Capsa is not a magazine font.\r\n\r\nI
    am amateur, but as far as I know, you are not allowed to transfer the fonts to
    the client. You can transfer the license (at least in Germany), after you have
    finished the work, but then you are not allowed to use the fonts anymore. As far
    as I know, it is common practice, that you include the costs or parts of the costs
    of your license into the bill. But then I would think about investing more money
    in a font, that you can use later in another project. And in this case I would
    not let the client pay the complete costs of your license, but maybe the half
    only. What I want to say is, that you are not allowed to work with fonts of the
    client. So it is primary you, who decides, if he is willing to invest in your
    license."
