  body: The ITC New Baskerville you have is a different digitisation without the Cyrillic
    characters, so it's normal that there are subtle differences in the character
    shapes. I'm quite confident this <em>is</em> ITC New Baskerville, so let's try
    to find out which foundry it's from.

  body: "Thanks for your effort.\r\nI don't think the differences are that subtle.
    The width of the lower case 's' is really different, the upper case 'R' as well.\r\nWould
    be nice if someone could point to the exact version of the font.\r\nIt's definately
