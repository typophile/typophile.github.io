body: Hi everyone, <BR>I am doing a cyrillic version of Engravers&#39; Gothic and
  as this is my first typeface ever, I&#39;ve naturally stuck with some problems of
  formats and technical details. <BR> <BR>1. One problem is that TT and T1 seem to
  interpret ascenders height differently &#40;or maybe x-height?&#41; and thus my
  font looks differently when saving it as TT and as a T1. <a href="http://xtati.com/_misc/engrv/tt_t1_prob1.jpg">Look
  here</a> - the black one is TT, the purple one is T1. Why is that? How come? <BR>
  <BR>2. Further on, even if I use T1 as a solution or better to say, as a method
  to avoid hinting problems with TT, I get <a href="http://xtati.com/_misc/engrv/engravers_test_735_probs.pdf">this
  &#40;pdf&#41;</a>, when exporting a document from InDesign CS. <a href="http://xtati.com/_misc/engrv/engravers_test_735.pdf">This
  document &#40;pdf&#41;</a> in its turn is the same document printed through Distiller.
  What is this phenomenon and what do I do? <BR> <BR>3. Of course, if anyone wants
  to say anything regarding the type itself &#40;its cyrillic part, of course&#41;,
  I am all ears. <BR> <BR>I am sorry for posting this thread into &#34;Design&#34;
  forum, but that&#39;s because I couldn&#39;t find &#34;start thread&#34; in &#34;Build&#34;
  forum. :/ If admins can move it there, that would be certainly much more appropriate.
  <BR> <BR>Thanks everyone in advance.
