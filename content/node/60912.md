  has an idea of what this is? or something close. I\u2019m drawn the slightly curved
  bits extending from the serif, it\u2019s a little playful, old, country or carnival
  - possible display? Thanks!\r\n\r\njulie"

    but it looks slightly widened. There is also a URW version that is a bit different,
    and comes in 2 weights.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
