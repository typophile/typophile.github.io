  Did the name Garamond 3 come from ATF or Linotype? I have seen multiple sources
  claim Garamond 3 to be a name originating at ATF. But ATF uses Garamond in my ATF
  specimen, and Garamond 3 is used in my Linotype specimen. Was Garamond 3 just the
  name Linotype used to market a design licensed from ATF?"

    by Mergenthaler Linotype. \r\n\r\nI would imagine the numerical designations were
    used to distinguish different versions of other foundries\u2019 Garamonds that
    Linotype might have been called upon to produce for various markets.\r\n\r\nI
    get the impression from McGrew\u2019s account that Mergenthaler attempted their
    own version first (which presumably would have been No. 1), which did not meet
    with any commercial success.\r\n\r\nAccording to McGrew, the \u201CNo. 2\u201D
    designation was used for some other fonts of a Garamond design produced by German
    Linotype. (Maybe this is the version Dan is referring to?)\r\n\r\nNo. 3, then,
    was assigned to the version they adapted from the popular Benton revival in conjunction
    with ATF, which has been the most enduring."

  body: I would have to look into it more, but I thought that this Linotype machine
    Garamond design was produced by Tetterode (Lettergiereij 'Amsterdam'). Jan Middendorp
    should know. Stempel in Germany had their own Garamond, for which Linotype matrices
    also would have been made, as far as I know.

  body: To clarify though, Garamond 3 is the Benton/ATF design, with the necessary
    adaptions, I guess, for the Linotype machine. It just had to be renamed for marketing
    purposes. All sources that I can find point toward Tetterode having released this
    in either the 20s or 30s. I hope that Jan sees this and chimes in.

    imparted by TFA / ATF confluence.\r\n\r\nThat is, Type Foundry Amsterdam or Amsterdam
    Type Foundry as it was sometimes referred in the States.\r\n\r\nAs far as I'm
    aware, Tetterode/Amsterdam didn't engage in matrix manufacture. Megenthaler in
    Brooklyn produced mats for the US market, and Linotype AG, (well before being
    absorbed by Stempel) produced matrices for the European market.\r\n\r\nAnd yes,
    Stempel has it's own cut of Garamond for foundry type, as well as historic other
    designs, such as their take on Baskerville which differed from the \"Fry's\" Baskerville
    ATF issued (but not called the Fry's cut), and further, the Baskerville Mergenthaler

  body: "Michael, my understanding of the German Linotype in the hot-metal era was
    was that it was a relatively small organization, at least in in terms of their
    own creation of new typefaces and the cutting of matrices. European foundries
    entered into agreements with them to adapt existing designs to the Linotype machine,
    and produce matrices in general (including Stempel and Haas). Stempel didn't absorb
    Linotype AG \u2026 rather, in 1985, it was more the other way around. That's certainly
    how the former Stempel employees have relate the situation to me.\r\n\r\nI think
    that Tetterode cut matrices for the Linotype and the Intertype machines, too,
    but it would be nice to get some confirmation for this. Jan Middendorp touches
    on Tetterode's relationship with Intertype in \"Letters from Amsterdam,\" <em>Linotype
    Matrix.</em> Volume 4, number 3 (winter 2008). Pages 40\u201353. The article,
    incidentally, is set in Garamond 3, although the design is not mentioned in the
    text or in his <em>Dutch Type</em> book.\r\n\r\nAlso, the ATF Garamond (and Garamond
    3, naturally) look more like they were based on Jean Jannon's seventeenth century
    types (just like Monotype Garamond) than earlier type from Garamond his contemporary
    sixteenth century French punchcutters (as is more the case with Stempel Garamond,
    Linotype's Granjon, Sabon, etc.)\r\n\r\n"

    ATF cut is definitely based on Jannon\u2019s work, although it would not be hard
    to adapt it into Garamond\u2019s stiffer design. The Jannon design Benton and
    Cleland sourced adheres closely to Garamond\u2019s roman with a little extra calligraphic
    liveliness. I started this thread because I was getting confused by the various
    Garamond/Jannon revival apocrypha that often refers to ATF Garamond as Garamond
    3. And of course some of it mentions Monotype because of Warde\u2019s connections
    there (and because of Monotype\u2019s own Garamonds), which can make for a big
    headache if one reads too much of it in the same week!"

    to provide the design history commentary at http://www.100types.com/100types.com.23garamond.html\r\n\r\nThe
    answer to your original question is that Garamond 3 as a designation originates
    with Mergenthaler Linotype and their agents. As Dan and others have pointed out,
    this was done to distinguish it from ATF Garamond (Benton and Cleland's original
    work), because the design was tweaked to make it fit the spec for Linotype machine
    matrices.\r\n\r\nBert is not mistaken; Tetterode/Amsterdam Type Foundry released
    their own cut named as Garamont, and I believe that Goudy/Monotype and D&P simply
    followed this trend for the name."

    presumption. I was not aware they were in the business, and if they were, they
    may have been manufacturing for Intertype rather than Linotype.\r\n\r\nI just
    checked my (late) 1960 Amsterdam specimen and they don't show anyone's version
    of Gara(x).\r\n\r\nTo reiterate, \"Garamond No. 3\" was the design licensed from
    American Type Founders. The two cuts are one and the same. I have foundry Garamond
    in cases, as well as the full series of Linotype mats for efficiently setting
    straight matter when needed.\r\n\r\nYes, due to the exigencies of duplexed matrix
    manufacturing in which the normally more narrow italic must be made to function
    on a roman width, the italic was refitted. That said, it was possible, if one
    were to make the investment in the several sets of refinements that would run
    as single characters and logotypes, to achieve italic settings that were more
    in keeping with the foundry fit.\r\n\r\nThese were the \"Italic Lower Case, Special
    No. 5\" which was the a-z and punctuation,and the \"Italic Logotypes, Special
    No. 5\" which were all the \u0192 combinations. Additionally, there were other
    sets. I have <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/interrobang918/322754441/in/set-72157594410115899/\"

    design... I'd take the scholarship with a grain of salt.\r\n\r\nThat is, they

    foundry, and further, there were two Monotypes. Lanston Monotype in the US, and
    Monotype and Machinery Limited in Britain.\r\n\r\nLanston worked with Goudy (as
    did ATF) and produced their take, the \"Garamont (Goudy) 248\". They also issued
    an \"American Garamond 648\" which, in comparing with a proof of ATF foundry Garamond
    laid in a case, appear to be the same cut. (Looking specifically at the g, b,
    and d. The bowl on the b in both is larger that the bowl on the d which is more
    diminutive, and the g is identical.)\r\n\r\nEnglish Monotype released a series
