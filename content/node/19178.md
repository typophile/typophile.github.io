  body: It could be <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/myriad/headline/">Myriad</a>;
    there are quite a number of round-dot Frutiger clones out there, and it's a little
    hard to tell them apart from your somewhat low-fi reproduction.

  body: "Check the slanted ascender on the 'h'. That should help identify it. The
    \xA3 and 'a' are also reasonably distinct. It's not Myriad.\r\n\r\nIt looks like
    it was printed on newsprint, so that may be what caused the softening around the
    edges that make it appear rounder."
