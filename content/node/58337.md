  typophile forums for a while, and I finally got the nerve to create my own font
  that wasn't made with Fontstruct. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rect2606_3804.png]\r\n\r\nMilka
  is a display font meant to be used large and for short phrases, not entire sentences.
  For now it's lower case and minimal punctuation only, I haven't started on the numbers.\r\n\r\nI
  would like some critique and suggestions, there are some characters I'm not too
  thrilled with (particularly r, v, x, z, and ?) and it would be good to have some
  input. I attached a specimen pdf."

  body: I think your first concern should be the s. It's not easily distinguishable
    from an r or n like that. Try sloping it forward.

  body: "'r' --- look more like a small-cap 'R'.\r\n\r\n'v' --- I think you should
    make it like a regular 'v', like down pointing arrow (excuse my english).\r\n\r\n'x'
    --- I think top left side would be better if rounded.\r\n\r\n'z' --- try a regular
    'z'.\r\n\r\n'?' --- imagine how it looks when put beside an uppercase letter,
    it needs to be wider.\r\n\r\n'c' --- I think top right side would be better if
    rounded.\r\n\r\n's' --- I'm agree with Cerulian.\r\n\r\nPS: It's your typeface,
    and this is just my humble opinion. :D"

  body: "Thank you for the suggestions. Some of the peculiarities are from the rules
    I gave myself at the start. All the shapes are made from circles or parts of circles,
    and vertical and horizontal lines. As a result, there are no diagonals anywhere...
    which means sloping the s would break the rules... but if keeping with the rules
    means I have an s that looks like an r, then I have no choice but to break them!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/s_4942.png]\r\n\r\nHow's
    this? I think it looks more s-like. I thought sloping it would ruin the linking
    between letters, but it works out. I updated the specimen to the new s.\r\n\r\nmk2:
    I made the current r the way it is because I had designed one and thought it looked
    too much like an n:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rr_3564.png]\r\n\r\nMaybe
    the old one (in red) is okay, and I've just been looking at all this too long?\r\n\r\nI
    agree with what you say about the c and the v. I think I'm going to do something
    like what I did with the s.\r\n\r\nI previously attempted to make a regular z,
    but I couldn't figure out how to squeeze in two horizontals and a diagonal into
    the space of the x-height, so I made a cursive z. The x was the last letter I
    made, it was really tricky, for the same reason, but I think I can use it to make
    a regular z. I'll have to work on that."

  body: There you go. The s updated in the pdf looks different than the s in the little
    red image; I much prefer the one in the image. I don't really see significant
    problems with the other characters mentioned, but if you're looking for r alternatives,
    one possibility would be to eliminate the left vertical stroke altogether. And
    your current z would be improved by retracting the middle left so it's not as
    long as the top.

    with it before, but shrinking the center part was exactly what it needed, and
    now I love it:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/milka_z_6414.png]\r\n\r\nI
    changed the specimen again. Now I'm off to start on the numbers."
