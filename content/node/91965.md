  promote tourism to certain parts of the world : London, Paris, and New York.\r\nTo
  this point I\xB4m happy with the typographical approach we achieved with Paris and
  London, but I\xB4m not happy with New York.\r\n\r\nCan anyone help suggesting typography
  that would relate to New York city life?\r\n\r\nThanks"
