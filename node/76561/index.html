To properly create Hebrew typeface software in MicroSoft Volt, the tool for creating 'advanced' OpenType fonts, the type designer should also have an "advanced" knowledge of Hebrew grammar and correct diacritical placement.

I intend to create a set of Hebrew typeface software 'advanced' OpenType fonts, both for Biblical Hebrew, and for "enhanced" or vocalized Hebrew.

The basis for doing this correctly is the establishment of Hebrew grammar rules, which I decided can best be achieved by understanding the writings of essential great Hebrew grammarians, such as R' Zalman Henna.</div>

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">R' Zalman Henna divides his book, "Foundation of the Nikkud", into 10 chapters. He labels his chapters as 'gates', שערים. 

Henna's first gate is: "Gate of Letters". It has 14 enumerated paragraphs, which Henna calls: 'fundementals' or 'foundations', יסודות.

In his first fundemental lesson, Henna reiterations how Hebrew letters are sounded, and their graphic form reflects that sound (without explaining how specific is the graphic form of each letter designed based upon the sound that letter makes).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">First, Henna quotes the early Hebrew language grammarians, המדקדקים. They called the vocal instruments which produced the sounds which we refer to as letters by the term, מוצאות, motzaot.

What are 'motzaot'?

'Motzaot' comes from the same common Hebrew word, 'מוציא', like the blessing of 'המוציא לכם מן הארץ', 'He brings forth the bread from the earth'. Similarly, these 'motzaot' bring forth the letter-sounds from the areas of the mouth.

Henna lists these areas as 5: a) the throat, b) the palate, c) the tongue, d) the teeth, and e) the lips.

	<div class="card-body">

1. א ה " ח ע
2. ג י " כ ק
3. ד ט ל " נ ת
4. ז ס ש " ר ץ
5. ב ו מ " ף

א ה " ח ע  are sounded from the 'הגרון', throat, known as gutturals.
ג י " כ ק  are from the 'החיך', palate, or roof of the mouth.
ד ט ל " נ ת  are from the 'הלשון', tongue.
ז ס ש " ר ץ  are from the 'השינים', teeth.

I am referring only to Hebrew fonts, with nikud dagesh meteg (and taam). Why would anyone use Volt just for the Hebrew consonants, and not to align these diacritics? To align diacritics, one needs not to know Hebrew grammar or even the Hebrew language. Yet this activity is very much enhanced by knowing Hebrew grammar, as time will show us.

To date, very few OpenType Hebrew fonts are made with Volt processing. A few are made in Israel of very poor quality. I know of only two sources in the US/Canada of very high quality.</div>

I can count them on one hand. 

Two folks on this continent. One is the lower hemisphere who... 
Some guy in Israel - I've seen his fonts - lousy stuff. 
Oh, I didn't count Eli - his suff looks very good. 
[Raphael said they hired someone.]

I'm not counting those who generate OpenType from FontLab Studio. Some create really great stuff.

Why do you need that stuff? your font is going to speak Hebrew? :)

Start with something simple. e.g. A Grammar for Biblical Hebrew -- Leong C. Seow; A Practical Grammar for Classical Hebrew -- Weingreen. 

If you like the classic & 'heavy' stuff: Gotthelf Bergsträsser -- Hebräische Grammatik (1+2); Muraoka + Jouon</div>

Israel, your talk is rubbish.
Can you point out examples to that statment????

Israel, I am going now to be streight forwards:
your knowledge of hebrew typgraphi is very poor, and you have absolutly no clue of what you are talking about.
i hav'nt seen yet any new breakthroughs in your design.
You bubble alot and talk to your self over the threads, trying to self convince your self that you have any knowledge of hebrew design.
from what i can see, you steal other designers ideas (like Koren) and claim them as your own.

even your volt knowledge is very limmitet, and you talk as id you are an expert.
you should try to be more humble, and kisten to what others with expirience have to say.

I am sorry for comming out rude, but form previous threads, you are driving people creazy with your unclear bobboling talk.

So please stop HACKING A CHAINIK, and land back on earth.

all of these new threads that you open and talk with your self is starting to be redicolus.

Start a thread down to earth, and develo it insteat of creating threads where the only one talking is your self with your self, with on going nonsense.

all thise business with KOREN and KROWN is a pile of bullshit

SO PLEASE STOP DOING THIS.

Mysticism, like many others, attracted me to Orthodox Judaism, Chassidic style. Hence, I am fascinated with the notion that the sounds of the Hebrew letters, the places in the mouth which produce them, and their very shapes and forms, are related.

If this wasn't significant, why would R' Zalman Henna address it?

Thank you for the references.

Which language is "Gotthelf Bergsträsser -- Hebräische Grammatik (1+2); Muraoka + Jouon" in?

At www.hebrewbooks.org, I downloaded for free many PDFs of books in Hebrew on Hebrew Grammar, including a half dozen by R' Zalman Henna, and one from the Radak. Did Eliyah Bachur write books? R' Zalman Henna cites him, but I couldn't locate it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'm very impressed with Prof. Donald Knuth's MetaFont system explained briefly in the previous link. The point size-specific features are sorely missed in outline font technology, that started in PostScript, TrueType, and now in OpenType.

I know that adding alternative glyphs to achieve this is doable, but not having point size-specific replacements (via Volt).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Sir Clive Sinclair introduced in his Sinclair QL a third scalable font technology which used a different mathematical technology than PostScript or Metafont, in which the y axis was relative the definition of the x axis. Although it was not as flexible and easy to use for advanced fonts as PostScript, or as able to address anything like MetaFont, as we see in Yiannis Haralambous' example in the above link.</div>
