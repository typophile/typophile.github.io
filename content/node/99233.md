body: "Seeking feedback on an article I wrote about a word illustration challenge:
  how to express the meaning of EDIT?  Some questions addressed in the article are:
  How to superimpose two letters while maintaining the legibility of both?\_ What
  parts of a letter can be concealed while retaining the letter's visual identity?\_
  There are 57+ illustrations of my steps toward a solution to the challenge.\r\n\r\nHere's
  the link: http://rudiseitz.com/2012/12/16/wrestling-words/\r\n\r\nI'm very interested
  in 1) comments on what you found interesting or provocative so I can concentrate
  on those points in future work,\r\n 2) suggestions for improving the article (things
  I've overlooked, things that aren't clear, mistakes, etc.),  3) any references to
  articles or papers that address similar topics.  (And, if anyone else is inspired
  to devise their own solution to the challenge, that would be great as well!) \r\n\r\n
  As a mostly self-educated typophile, I'm glad to join this forum and am looking
  forward to learning from the community.\r\n\r\n-Rudi"

    body: "Chris, thanks for the clarification.  Actually, since I had been experimenting
      with the irony mark (\u2E2E) earlier today, I thought I'd try out the symbol
      here to indicate that I was making a \"sarcastic\" reply to the spam.  (I did
      realize that it was spam.)  My earlier experiments with the mark are here:\r\nhttp://rudiseitz.com/2013/01/02/irony-mark/\r\nAnd
      I've posted a followup proposal about differentiating ironic questions from
      ironic statements:\r\nhttp://rudiseitz.com/2013/01/02/punctuating-ironic-questions/\r\nComments
      on those posts are welcome too."

    whats the keyboard command for that?\r\n\r\nCan I use it to end a passive-agressive,

  body: "Chris, you asked another question--how to enter the irony mark on a Mac.
    \ I see you found a way.  For anyone else interested, the easiest way I know is
    copying and pasting the character from somewhere else.  You can also do CMD+OPTION+T
    to get the Characters menu -- you'll find it under Punctuation, but (for me at
    least) it doesn't show up at the top with the other question-mark-like symbols--it's
    near the dotted \"therefore\" symbols.  You can also search for Unicode character
    2E2E.  \r\n\r\nSince I started experimenting with the irony mark, I've learned
    that it doesn't render properly in many current browser/platform configurations.
    \ I just posted an \"Irony Test\" so you can see if it's rendering in yours: http://rudiseitz.com/2013/01/04/irony-test/\r\n\r\nModerators
    -- should we move this to a different thread?  I've had no takers so far re: my
    original question, but I'm sure there are some folks around who'd like to discuss
    irony punctuation.\r\n\r\nThis is a related typophile thread from 2006-7: http://typophile.com/node/28817"
