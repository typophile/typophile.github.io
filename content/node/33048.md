  body: "From <em>Eats, Shoots & Leaves</em> by Lynne Truss:\r\n\r\nUntil the beginning
    of the 18th century, quotation marks were used in England only to call attention
    to sententious remarks. Then in 1714 someone had the idea of using them to denote
    direct speech, and by the time of the first edition of Henry Fielding's <em>Tom
    Jones</em> in 1749, inverted commas were used by printers both to contain the
    speech and to indicate in a general, left-hand marginal way that there was speech
    going on.\r\n\r\n(There follows an example of this that I'm sure would be mangled
    if I tried to transcribe it here. Speech was in single quotes, and every line
    break within a quotation required another open quote at the beginning of the next
    line.)"

  body: "Aha! Thanks Kevin! \r\n\r\nSo it's an 18th century thing. Nice. Tom Jones
    was the sort of book that would encourage that kind of innovation I think. I will
    have to ask my 18th century guy more about it. \r\n\r\nHrant: what is \"Pause
    & Effect\" a title of a book?\r\n\r\nAnybody else?"

    the ref.)\r\n\r\nBTW, you have an 18th century guy? Say, if you\r\nhave one for
    the 19th can I borrow him for a year?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    Maybe you can set a trap in the library at UCLA? \r\n\r\nI will go to my Library
    to try to find Pause & Effect. Thanks!"
