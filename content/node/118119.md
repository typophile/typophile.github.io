  body: "Just a sidelight: you said it looks a lot like Zapf's Palatino, and, whether
    or not I agree with that, the design of Nofret is by the woman who is Zapf's wife,
    Gudrun Zapf-von Hesse. Palatino was originally designed in 1950, and Nofret is
    from 1984. Nofret is one of my favorite serif types.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Thank you again. After Bob Evans first Id I went and checked it out and felt
    finally at rest. \r\n\r\nThanks for the historical insight Bowfin. It looked like
    Palatino to me because I had only seen the Caps and not the lowercase. My fault.
    Though I agree it looks beautiful!\r\n\r\nThough for me personally what atracts
    me more is the fact that, like Futura, its capitulars are perfectly proportioned.\r\n\r\nOnce
    again, gentlemen, thank you for your kind generosity."
