body: Hello, <BR> <BR>I am wondering, [John, Nathan, Thomas], how do you test if a
  Thai OpenType font works correctly -- the shaping of vowels and tonal marks in particular.
  I have a copy of InDesign CS on panther. <BR> <BR>My friend started implementing
  OpenType features, and gave me a copy to test. The basic unicode glyphes are fine.
  But InDesign would not shape the font using his OpenType features. Could I use Indy
  as a benchmark to check if Thai shaping features are working properly? <BR> <BR>Chanop

    2003 for Windows to test Thai shaping. This is the only software I know that has
    fully implemented support for Thai OpenType fonts.
