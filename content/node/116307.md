body: "Assuming a typeface which defaults to proportional figures, do you think it\u2019s
  sane and user-friendly to adjust more characters than just digits when fixed-width,
  tabular `tnum` numerals get activated? I\u2019m thinking about making currency and
  other symbols the same width as figures then, so they align properly.\r\n<pre><code
  class=\"fea\">feature tnum {\r\n  @digits = [zero one two three four five six seven
  eight nine];\r\n  @digits.pnum = @digits;\r\n  @digits.tnum = [zero.tnum one.tnum
  two.tnum three.tnum four.tnum five.tnum six.tnum seven.tnum eight.tnum nine.tnum];\r\n
  \ sub @digits.pnum by @digits.tnum;\r\n  lookup units {\r\n    @currencysymbols
  = [dollar cent sterling currency yen Euro]\r\n    @unitsymbols = [percent @currencysymbols]\r\n
  \   @currencysymbols.tnum = [dollar.tnum cent.tnum sterling.tnum currency.tnum yen.tnum
  Euro.tnum]\r\n    @unitsymbols.tnum = [percent.tnum @currencysymbols.tnum]\r\n    sub
  @digits @unitsymbols' by @unitsymbols.tnum;\r\n    sub @digits @spaces @unitsymbols'
  by @unitsymbols.tnum;\r\n    sub @unitsymbols' @digits by @unitsymbols.tnum;\r\n
  \   sub @unitsymbols' @spaces @digits by @unitsymbols.tnum;\r\n  } units;\r\n} tnum;</code></pre>\r\nI
  also have written code to deal with rather simple SI unit symbols including prefixes."

  body: "In general I always try to make currency characters the same width as tnum
    figures if the design allows it. There are some that can not be done that way
    without distortion of their traditional appearance. The ones you show in your
    code usually will work well with the exception of the percent character.\r\n\r\nPercent
    does not need such treatment because it doesn't usually need to align with any
    character other than another percent in tabular typesetting. I would not force
    it into a width it doesn't look good in."

  body: If you take the typeface's position and not the user's, you can only guess.
    If you ask one user and they say what they want, the font is one more informed.
    Timetables point to one set, including punctuation, while size charts point to
    another set including fractions, (the inevitable control character of which is
    the percent). Monetary symbols are an obvious target for some kinds of settings,
    but not without proper fractions, dashes, spaces and punctuation for others. If
    you gather that all together, it can be quite disruptive if not properly used.
    Linotype developed a system based on the em, 3/4s, 1/2, and 1/4 of it, and mixed
    glyphs for different uses, knowing their users had secure access to all the right
    dashes and spaces. Today, not so much.;)
