body: Does anybody know where I should look to find Central European dictionaries
  for Adobe InDesign (CS1). Can i find these somewhere on the software? do i need
  to purchase them from Adobe? I'm hoping someone here has an answer...

    Western European languages (English, French, Dutch, Swedish, Spanish, &c.) No
    CE languages, ie Czech, Polish, &c.\r\n\r\nP.S. on Win XP here"

    Files\\Adobe\\Linguistics\\Providers\\Proximity\\pol.hyph, which i'm guessing
    is a hyphenation dictionary for Polish. But now how do i access it?"

    some standalone hyphenation application Dashes Pro from CircleNoEtics."

  body: If memory serves in order to get more than the standard dictionaries you'll
    have to go into the "options" of the InDesign installer and enable the languages
    you need.

  body: "okay, i did it! here's what i did:\r\n\r\ni went to the folder i previously
    mentioned (C:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Adobe\\Linguistics\\Providers\\Proximity\\)
    and copied the following files: pol32.clx, pol103.lex, pol.hyp & polphon.env.
    I then opened the following folder: C:\\Program Files\\Adobe\\Adobe InDesign CS\\Plug-Ins\\Dictionaries\\Proximity
    and pasted in these files. Now I get Polish from my drop-down language menu. Thank
    you all for helping me to work my way through this."

  body: I wouldn't consider this a Build question, since it has to do with typesetting
    and text processing not with font making.

    if you are testing your type designs in foreign languages, it certainly would
    help. Besides, the real geeks hang out in this forum John and some of them are
    Central European :-)\r\n\r\nWay to go cowboy!\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: 'well in the strict sense, this isn''t a build question. however, my understanding
    is that all technical software questions are filed under the build section for
    lack of a better forum for these types of questions. for example: <a href="http://typophile.com/node/17115">Batch
    Printing Help</a>, <a href="http://typophile.com/node/17032">Pattern Fill in InDesign</a>
    & <a href="http://typophile.com/node/16850">Drive Failing --> Can''t copy files</a>
    aren''t <em>build</em> threads either, but they can all be found in this forum
    section. If you have a suggestion and rationale for where these types of threads
    would be better archived, i''d be glad to hear it.'
