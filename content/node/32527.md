  & then later used again for an apology card for the colleague of another friend
  (Card.gif). Since I liked the R so much, I decided to make it into an entire font.
  I'm curious what you guys think of it.\r\nBTW: sorry for the pdf, I kn\xF2w how
  annoying those are in these threads ;-)"

  body: "I did several versions of a font VERY similar to yours. In fact the R was
    exactly the same. Probably many others did so as well. Nevertheless, I like this
    style (otherwise I wouldn\u2019t have dealt with it)."
