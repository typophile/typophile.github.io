Well… yes, it is!
But it is really just the grown up version of Neue Haas Grotesk, which is a Swiss typeface. And the Swiss never forgot that the German Helvetica typeface has had these Swiss origins. I've always felt that the Germans have tended to overlook this by saying, "well even Neue Haas Grotesk was based on Akzidenz-Grotesk, or something else German."

The Germans can think that Helvetica is German, the Swiss can think it is Swiss, and the Americans can even think it is American ;-)

It is not a typeface's birthplace that necessarially gives it its "nationality," but more where and how it is used, I think. In other words, maybe Helvetica was born in Frankfurt, but does it still have a German passport? The beautiful Helvetica may have met some nice foreigner and emigrated to other shores a long time ago, for all we know.</div>

Unless the character of a German is Walbaum Fraktur, Helvetica, or even FF Meta! Surely these have been used as much in Germany as Futura. I think that, with 80 million Germans, there is probably a bit of a question as to what a German is, too ;-) But I can say with certainty that I am not a German, if that helps any. What typeface I'd be personally, I really can't say.</div>

"National typefaces" is a frequent Typophile topic. People are always trying to tag formal qualities as being specifically national, sexual, violent, whatever. It's a meaningless minefield, IMHO, but a good opportunity to voice one's opinions, as most people have strong feelings about nationality, sex, and violence. But if you are going to go there, why not compare national typefaces with international typefaces such as Verdana and Comic Sans, or the more recent ClearType faces -- commissioned by the trans-national corporation Microsoft.

Futura is a great American typeface of the 1930s, 40s and 50s.

But yes, the RdR is the ultimate "national" typeface. And yes, Futura
is not very German at all. Helvetica? That's just processed cheese.

BTW, we should really distinguish between "commissioned by a nation",
"intended for use as a national type" and "ending up as a national type".

		<div class="commentbody">I think this issue is dangerously worth discussing with a smile. If Canada has selected a style to represent the government's voice in a typographic way, good for them, good for all. If Canada.gov want to imply or market the notion that this face, this one typeface (and its Italic and bold presumably?), represent "Canadians" in typographic form, instead, perhaps think of that One Person's Face, (and that person's significant other presumably, and maybe their dog, home and children?), that should represent Canada. Is that possible? :-)

We started this discussion not to get the ultimate answer or to 
archive typefaces with national labels on them. 
 
We are aware of the how slippy this subject is (It graded us up to the hottest topic within one day ;)) as soon as you try to classify it strictly. 


But many countries have a kind of national look in typedesign, no?

Sort of. To the extent that that exists it is the result of fashion. These trends last a decade or even a century. But like a local fashion for a color or a fabric or music they go away and are replaced. And this goes on faster now than ever. And it's a more & more global world in design. So if you are looking for historical fashion trends in type ( or lettering) over time - then sure, that's good to know about. Important too. No student of type should be without that information. But looking for the 'Dutchness', or 'Englishness' or 'Germanness' in a type design is intellectually shallow and unsupportable. If you look closely you will find that it is individuals or small groups who choose a path & win support for their ideas for a while. Along with fashion; technology, economics, and company policies and wars influence the type we see too. National 'character' per se has 0% to do with it.</div>

Almost entirely, yes. Almost.
But try ignoring the fashion element in type and see what happens.

On the contrary, ignoring the national dimension in type is those things.
Furthermore, it is feel-good escapism.

Sure, most places have a visual personality, but it's a very different proposition to say that places are a complex amalgam of their constituent parts, as opposed to the premise that places can be visually represented by iconic stereotypes. 

You would also have to decide on how to measure the relative significance of typefaces. 

-Font sales
-Fonts installed
-Quantity of words read
-Online or print
-Environmental exposure (billboards, signage, product packaging, POP displays, junk mail, pizza menus, spam)
-Mentions on Typophile
-Appearance in award-winning ads
-TDC type design awards
-Mention in trade publications and history books

Otherwise it's pure conjecture as to which typefaces are representative of which culture.

Fact is, without any form of statistical analysis based on a coherent strategy, this kind of research just bats around second hand ideas, a meta-discussion.

It would perhaps be fruitful to take a publishing sector, such as newspapers, and compare countries. That would be manageable, and focus demographics. But even it would be clouded by the presence of international newspaper redesigners, and you would have to wonder, are the type choices a national preference, or the designer's?

I am not sure I see what you mean. 

Let's look at an example: I suspect that you could be interested in, for instance, Armenian-ness in type. Needless to say I think that's just silly. And I hope that's not the case. You should do & think as you like of course...

On the other hand, if you are instead interested in specific things like the history of Amerinan type, the things that are unique about the way the Armerian language's glyph/letterforms work and how they got to be that way, how to make them better, how they relate to Roman forms - or don't - in other words : specific things. Then, I think that's great! 

The one thing is utter mush & not even poetic. The other is mushy enough already, lacks no savouriness, and is at least worthwhile. This is the distinction I am making. 

I am ceratin I have some way to go still. What direction do you suggest?

<cite> Otherwise it’s pure conjecture</cite>

Conjecture per se is better than talking about National character in type because it has some hope of revealing something. The idea of 'national charcter' on the other hand is obviously fatuous tomfoolery. At best - useless. At worst - dangerous.

Nick, that's a nice example of how you might begin to look at the issue of local difference ( which is real, and worth thinking about ) in a deliberate methodical manner.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It's pretty simple: national characters exist, no matter how faint or secondary they can be in making design decisions. Good design (or good anything) takes as many things into consideration as possible (or at least as is feasible). Practically, typographically most countries don't have a character worth considering, but many have enough that it's escapist (and bad design) to ignore that. If you completely ignore national character in type, just a few short steps away would be to ignore type design outright.

Or all 3? Or something else? In each case I have named so far I think it's more accurate to think in terms of trends & fashion. To say 'national character' is to invoke something supposedly eternal.

What I'm simply saying is that certain fonts can make people think of certain nations (or anything else), if only rarely and to a limited extent. And yes, these associations change all the time, and vary between people. What else is new?

This works differently in display and text fonts, and it's not like one font can only have an association with one nation, but for example if you have a choice between Font-X and Font-Y and the former has a French connection and what you're setting has a French connection, all things being equal chances are good it's better design to use Font-X. Reading anything else into anything I've written involves "motivated" presumptions. And thinking that society is just a bunch of 100% independent ethereal individuals is pure lala-land.

This made some sense but I would have maybe said instead something like : "If you know that your audience is people of Algerian descent in their late 40's-60's who live in France and have for the last 30 years - then you would be foolish to discount the fact that they live in France & have seen & grown accustomed to that French set of media etc. Where as if you are talking about Heugenots ( ethnic french folk ) living in the US say in NY state for the last 150 years ( or whatever - sorry my history is not all it should be ) I would not worry too much about their ethnic 'Frenchness' imapcting a font choice. Because Frenchness is a cultural construct not something in the blood.

I suspect we are disagreeing any longer. Am I right?

		<div class="commentbody">So far the discussion has been about faces that have been commissioned by governments and then faces that are often thought [by some] to represent a national character.

There's a third category: types that have been created by a designer with the goal in mind of representing a culture or nation. The only one that immediately comes to mind at the end of a long work day is Gabriel Martinez Maeve's Mexica, which he has explained to me was an attempt to forge a face with a decidedly Mexican feel from the European roots of the Latin alphabet. It is a wonderful face.

His web site [http://www.kimera.com.mx] is undergoing re-construction, so you may have to go elsewhere to see it.

I gotta go to a party right now, so I haven't time to root out any oter URLs so you can see it. maybe later. Good night.

		<div class="commentbody">For a long time Gill Sans and Plantin were dead giveaways that a publication had originated in the UK. No more! Other forms have taken their place, those typefaces have migrated or expanded their "territory", and later generations have different associations with them. PowerPoint, for example. 

Patzcuaro, display face by F. Storm, is based very closely on lettering that represents an official style in the town of Patzcuaro, MX. The town only allows signage to be hand-painted in black and red on the walls of buildings by approved signpainters (as I understand it). Sort of a historical district thing. The result is a relatively consistent and distinctive appearance to the signage all over the town. Nice! Some of the signs would just make you sigh. But if you never saw the typeface or traveled through Patzcuaro, is it a local style (does a tree fall in the woods...)? 

Eben, I think Hrant is saying there's more to it than simple association or fleeting trends. Flag colors and design, road layout, architecture, food, geography, agriculture, dances, music and lots of other things about cultures are (or should be) very specific to places. Especially in these times, this is of great value and should be preserved, not dismissed as arbitrary. Just because most of the US is a giant endless mall doesn't mean the rest of the world should be. 

Will's comment reminds me that Menhart explicitly intended some of his typefaces to represent Czech character or culture. Not sure whether ultimately this came to pass, but there's an example of an intentional production.</div>

See my first post in this thread.

Besides Mexica there's the infamous cluster of "authentic" German types
made during the Nazi reign. I think "jackboot grotesk" is the label for these.
Also, L Mandel seems to have often strove to create "authentic" French fonts.
Certainly there's a style of lc "a" for example that occurs pretty much only
among French designs.

Well put & 100% right.

I think I am somehow being misinterpreted. I am not trying to deny locality and culture and history as a factors in type design. In fact quite the opposite. I am denying the role of nationality/race. All the specifics of culture and historical precedent is what I am suggesting exists instead. 

I am not saying for instance that there is no such thing as French type culture. I am saying that a type which distills it or part of it ( or tries to ) isn't more 'French' than another one as a result. Certainly if it does a good job it would have strong relation to the type culture of France. And really, you might have to be more specific still to really something meaningful. 

This doesn't preclude having personal or even poetic associations or feelings about that type. But even those don't make a typeface 'french' or 'frenchier' than another. 

Put another way I think it's reasonable and even useful to say 

- 'This typeface feels more French to me than this one'. 

You could also say:

- 'I think people will find this typeface feels more French that this one'. 

Also quite reasonable. Whereas saying: 

- 'This typeface is more French than this one' 

...is to my mind utter balerdash.

So: <cite> Will’s comment reminds me that Menhart explicitly intended some of his typefaces to represent Czech character or culture.</cite>

'Culture': yes, by all means. 'Character': if that means something inherent in Czech folk at birth then no. Absolutely not. If that means history & culture then again: Yes.  

I realize that I must seem seem overwrought here, or like I am splitting hairs. But I really do think one lind of thinking is lazy, unspecific, messy & prone to nationalist racism hate  etc where the other is interesting, rich & deeply useful.
 
<cite> Some of the signs would just make you sigh.  </cite>

How can this make any sense?

I think you're assuming something like "Czech" can even have a fully reliable meaning. That said, peoples are different, and generalization is a powerful and useful -if/thereby also dangerous- tool.

		<div class="commentbody">Sorry I missed that, Hrant. But I would split a hair and say I don’t think Mexica was “intended for use as a national type,” in the sense that its use be mandated. I think it is one type designer’s attempt at his own idea of an expression of “Mexican-ness.”

And given the vibrant visual culture of Mexico, I think Mexica has little chance of “ending up as a national type.”

As to Menhart and his attempts at a “Czech” face: Gabriel Martinez Maeve is not at all shy about acknowledging Menhart’s influence on him.

I did root around the www and found some links to his faces:

http://www.kimeratype.com/pdf/specimenMexica.pdf
http://www.kimeratype.com/

And thanks, Carl, for the reminder about Patzcuaro. I want to go out there one of these days on a trip south.

Is there a Czech-Mex nexus shaping up among these faces by Maeve, Menhart, and Storm? Both cultures do really well with accordions and beer.

Futura has been popular in the US since it was imported, so I also would say it doesn't hold a "German" association. 

These days, unless a federal government officially adopted a typeface and kept using it everywhere for 50 years, I don't think many typefaces will gain national or local associations. The more languages they support, the farther they can travel. Meta is another 'German' typeface that now has a comfortable home in the US. 

I think comparing the differences in the work of Storm, Menhart and Tyfa exemplifies why it is shaky to try to intentionally develop a national or local type style. It's just limiting. If a style emerges, like the "Dutch" style, that's organic. </div>

You mean like FHWA/Interstate?  :-)
It's very American, and in more than one way.

BTW, our Norbert Florendo once posted a riveting account of the development of ITC Barcelona on Typophile.* For one thing it wasn't designed for the Olympics there - that was much later. But in any case no self-respecting Catalan would call it Spanish.  ;-)

This is all useless rubbish. You might know what you mean ( maybe - maybe not too ) but nodoby else can tell. Not really. They are just left guessing. 

Nick you were bang on when you said:

<cite>“National typefaces” is a frequent Typophile topic. People are always trying to tag formal qualities as being specifically national, sexual, violent, whatever. It’s a meaningless minefield, IMHO, but a good opportunity to voice one’s opinions, as most people have strong feelings about nationality, sex, and violence.</cite>

I don't object to anyone expressing their feelings or opinions silly or otherwise. But my point is that's not the same thing as and certainly not as useful as saying for instance "look at this lower case a, it is mostly found in french roman text faces and pretty much nowhere else".  That's VERY cool.

Hrant : who do nominate as your archype of 'Candianness' anyway? Why? 

And is there really any point in answering that question? 

<cite>Is there a typeface that immediately makes you think of a particular country/nation?</cite> 

In my case - no. I do associate Mistral with Montreal though. Oddly more bcause of an article in Eye Magazine than the eveidence of my own senses while I was there. I associate Johnston's Underground Sans Type with London. But for me these associations are pretty loose & getting looser all the time. 

This doesn't mean however that I am not looking for a common thread that has made Type from Portugal seem to have some elusive fascinating flavor to me. I suspect that if I can find the source of that flavor, it will be a formally distinguishable factor or set of factors and not a essential vapour called 'Portugueseness'.

That is a claim that is vague but is at least semi-testable. You can ask some folks living threre. How does this type feel to you? Does it feel Foreign? or Malay? Or Is it a silly Question? You do that 100 or 100 times And bada boom you have a semireasonable sample of the public's attitude.

Did you try searching typophile for this subject before posting? It comes up pretty often, so there will be quite a few old threads relating to this. Lots of opinions – very few facts – as this thread seems to bear out already.

these are not 'national typefaces', but a diagram showing the countries of origin of a small sample of typefaces. 

Yes, there are typefaces that make me think of particular nationalities or cultures, and I have argued for this in the past, but it is SO subjective (see other posts above) that the statement I make at the bottom of that map page is as far as I would go with this, at the present time.

		<div class="commentbody">I always found it amusing that typefaces in the old designation of "Egyptian" style (heavy slab serifs on a monoline sans serif base) were so often used for subject matter involving Egyptology. Clearly, this type style did not come from Egypt--it was western. Yet the name caused western art directors to choose it for that subject. Again a case of a foreigners impression of what says something about a country tat may not be true for those who actually live there.
