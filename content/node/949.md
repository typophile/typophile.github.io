  body: So we&#39;re faster, but also less successful... <BR> <BR>Maybe the IDs are
    harder now? That doesn&#39;t seem probable. <BR> <BR>Or maybe we&#39;re just after
    the speed record... If 2 minutes have passed, there&#39;s no glory, and no point
    to it.  ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    while the success has gone down. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: I&#39;m excited to compile Feburary through present, so we can get annual
    stats. Then we&#39;ll be able to accurately see any trends and crown a few winners.
    I&#39;ll get those up as soon as I can. &#40;Anyone wanna help?&#41;

  body: <i>&#62; So we&#39;re faster, but also less successful...</i> <BR> <BR>There&#39;s
    more IDers and they all have e-mail notification,  <BR>hence the increased speed.
    On the other hand, when  <BR>&#40;x&#41;ing and tagging threads I noticed the
    success rate  <BR>fluctuates a lot. It all depends how many custom-drawn  <BR>stuff
    is included. If we&#39;d consider those as IDed, success  <BR>rate would be more
    realistic.

  body: '&#62; Right, Yves - In determining the statistics to include in the leader
    board, any non-ID posts and &#34;I need a font that fits these general qualities...&#34;
    posts are omitted, as they don&#39;t apply. Only your typical &#34;What font is
    this?&#34; posts that include a graphic sample followed by the solution are counted.
    And even then, it gets ambiguous when someone solves their own post, after they&#39;ve
    searched their hard drive. <BR> <BR>Many of the &#34;Unsolved Mysteries&#34; are
    a step away from being solved; Until they are definitively resolved, they don&#39;t
    count. <BR> <BR>In addition to &#34;Top ID of the Year&#34; and &#34;Top Avg of
    the Year&#34;, what other stats should we look at? &#40;Most frequent poster,
    Most frequent font posted, Longest tangent in a Type ID thread, Biggest noisemaker,
    Always 2nd Place, etc&#41;?'

    true. I hope the stats will back up my theory,  <BR>but I genuinely believe there&#39;s
    no downwards trend,  <BR>just heavy fluctuation.
