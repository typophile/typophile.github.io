body: "I have a simple fontlab question - While finishing my kern font I realize that
  the values I used are a bit tight for my taste, so I want to add (+) all my kerning
  values +30 for example so they still well kerned but more space in equal proportions.
  Is there any easy way to do this? :S Hopefully yes!\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    a way to do it but isn't good. \r\nSearch and Replace in my OpenType Kern window...
    It isn't good cos I have lots of different values :-("
