    thread &#40;sorry, I haven&#39;t been  <BR>following lately&#41;. the benefit
    of a one-button,  <BR>&#34;counter-intuitive&#34; mouse is that it allows you
    to use  <BR>your whole hand to depress the button, thus reducing  <BR>repetitive
    stress. I speak from experience, though I&#39;m  <BR>still using a multi-button
    here at work. and as for  <BR>&#34;downgrading&#34; to the single-button again,
    it was no  <BR>more difficult for me than going the other direction.

    continues to strive for 1&#41; sleek, different, elegant hardware 2&#41; friendly,
    simple print design. Their interface design is trying to reflect both of these
    and, unfortunately, sometimes forgets its place in the process. However, I think
    that ITC Garamond Tall &#39;n&#39; Fat and Myriad match&#40;ed&#41; Apple&#39;s
    desires. I&#39;m sure that they aren&#39;t the most typo-rigorous choices, but
    they have other concerns. At least they didn&#39;t use Gill Sans, which is _everywhere_

    <BR> <BR>Anyway, they&#39;re 2 different tools. They match and mismatch in many
    ways. What I want to know is why do people seem so eager to devote their mind
    and spirit to a corporation or corporations they know very little about? Believe
    me, if your opinion of a company is based on its website and its products, you
    have a <i>very</i> incomplete picture. <BR> <BR>To swerve back to the topic &#40;sort
    of&#41;: What&#39;s so wrong about a given company using a chrome look to their
    mark, particularly Apple, if it also works in B/W, etc.? Is there something <i>inherently</i>
    wrong about it? Again, I think that Apple has a pretty distinct look &#40;as a
    whole&#41; and some very strong brand management. They <i>are</i> a consumer-oriented,
    image-conscious electronics manufacturer/ software developer. Why would they keep
    their image &#40;which I consider to be a subset of their brand&#41; static? <BR>
    <BR>Look at Nike. Their logo gets used in all sorts of materials and colors, but
    the Swoosh is still the Swoosh. I think the same goes for the Apple. The surface
    changes, but the mark endures. I understand the disdain for shiny, swooshy crap,
    but most of those low-grade redesigns often accompany a total brand overhaul and
    a total re-shaping of their mark. Apple has remained very controlled compared
    to many corporations. I think that&#39;s probably why we freak out every time
    they tweak &#40;redress&#41; the logo or change the typeface &#40;What is it,
    <i>once</i> so far?. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s hard to be innovative and consistent at
    the same time. Most of the objections I&#39;ve read are high-minded design concerns
    that ignore the practicalities of business and focus on a conceptual level, or
    are a general reaction to sheep-like actions of large corporations &#40;which
    is hardly shocking&#41;. Consumers still know Apple, still recognize the mark,
    and Apple still looks contemporary. What other visual brand concerns should they,
    as a corporation, have?'

    swoosh. It&#39;s the  <BR>Apple mark at its worst. &#40;The only thing worse is
    the furry  <BR>X.&#41; All I&#39;m saying is we shouldn&#39;t be surprised.

  body: '&#62; XP is ugly and bloated.  <BR>You can simply change that by hacking
    a bit and changing some stuff. And, sadly, the blue-pill-Apple look isn&#39;t
    so sleek either. Here&#39;s hoping both companies give more power to the user
    in future. At least with XP you can completely and utterly alter the surface and
    look/feel of the OS with tools like WindowBlinds. That should be a given with
    XP itself, but at least there is a tool for it :-D.  <BR> <BR>&#62;Commodores
    &#40;64s - but also SuperPets&#41; <BR>Oh, that&#39;s cool. I noticed today at
    a meeting how many designers refer to their career by mentioning old hard- and
    software. Which version of Pagemaker, or which Mac/PC you started with, or even
    if you started pre-Computer, it obviously kinda sticks in your mind.  <BR> <BR>quiksilver
    looks oddly un-Carson in a way of looking too much like Carson, if that makes
    sense -- more like a student imitating David. It has the superficial look, but
    doesn&#39;t feel like his Ray Gun stuff, it&#39;s just visual, not really '

    but Software as well. I would gladly pay the extra for OS X. It creams everything
    out there in terms of stability and ease of use. <BR> <BR>

    and I think that except <BR>for some differences they are almost the same. <BR>Use
    my PC to design and the programs are such <BR>in both platforms. If somebody sees

    that <BR>servants RIP of the presses are all mac. Due <BR>to this and to filosofia
