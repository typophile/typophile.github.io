<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi all, I'm about to start teaching typography again and one of the things i've never been able to find a simple resource for is something that explains, or preferrably shows the process of photo typesetting. I try to explain it to my students, how we used to have fonts on strips of film (and later, small cards) like negatives, and how these were mounted on drums, and the drums spun around really fast as light shot through the negatives for each letterform, exposing it at the correct size onto photographic paper.
Well, naturally, it's bewildering, and I've long wished that there were a little movie, much like the numerous little movies there are out there showing metal type setting, lead casting, etc.
Does anyone know of something like this on the web, or ... ???

<div class=commentbody>FWIW, Marian, you might try contacting the Museum of Printing in North Andover, www.museumofprinting.org, to see if there are any period films from the original manufacturers (that could be converted). I'm guessing they might still exist. Frank Romano wrote a good capsule history of phototypesetting from the North American perspective in Printing History, the APHA journal, Number 46 (Volume 23, No. 2) 2003, as an eyewitness.
If you haven't come across it already, download this article by Andrew Boag, on Monotype's photosetting equipment, written for the Printing History Society, the graphics will help. www.letterpress.ch/APINET/IMMPDF/MONOPHOTO/PHS_journal.pdf </div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi all, Thanks so much for this. And I will indeed contact the museum of printing, thanks phil, as well as read your aticle (thanks mark), and the pics Norbert!
It's funny to me how every time i try to explain any typesetting technology to students how mindblowingly laborious it all seems. I worked with a Linotronic 3000(??), among other things, and it always amazed me.

For those who can remember...
<strong>JANUARY 23, 1884</strong>
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Apple1984ad.jpg]
Apple Computer, Inc. introduces the world’s first user-friendly, Macintosh personal computer. Its dramatic, Orwellian,1984-inspired Super Bowl TV ad introduces the product as a world smashing alternative to Big Brother’s grip on workers in dull grey drone attire... APPLE -- PLEASE SAVE US!
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Apple84hammer.jpg]
Maybe the attire has changed... but the drones live on.
FYI --
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lisa300.jpg]
Before there was the Macintosh, there was the Apple Lisa as the first desktop publishing front end. I worked on the Lisa for about a year at Compugraphic before the Cg's top management decided the hippies at Apple were crazy and that we would not support them in font development. The rest is history... and so is Cg.</div>

I have an old Apple rainbow label for a disk somewere and I think and Intellifont large disk somewhere. I just remember the VT100 and the 'private data' that never made it to replace Postscrpt.

<div class=commentbody>I remember seeing a Lisa in a Compugraphic showroom around 1984. They had some sample output from the combo system. It didn't look very promising. Lots of squashed/slanted type and fairly crude translation of QuickDraw graphics to hi-res output, seemingly using shapes built from individual characters tiled together or something.
I thought the Lisa was really something when I first read about it. At $10,000, it was too expensive to imagine actually owning one. It made the Mac, at $2500, seem very reasonably priced. I bought one exactly a month after they were introduced.
Around the same time I got my first Mac, I ordered a Compugraphic MCS digital typesetting system for us to use at MPR. It replaced an aging Compugraphic Editwriter II phototypesetter (one with a spinning drum like Marian describes above). Not long after that, I left with my Mac to start freelancing, using it for comps and stuff. The LaserWriter/Linotronic/PostScript thing hadn't happened yet.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yes I could tell Norbert from Howard Berman. Howard talked too fast and ran too much and you 2 were the original Mac heads but he with the bowed legs.
The Cg; Norbert and I worked at was at 'building 90' in Wilmington MA. Cg was dotted all around the area.
Howard was a bit upset when Agfa bought Cg and went on a bit about Bayer and there experiments during WWII.
He and I worked very close on the first TrueType fonts.
I think you left about this time and you probably don't remember the Agfa PostScript desktop printer that sold for $10,000 and use to clog up with paper every 50 sheets. </div>

<div class=commentbody><em>you 2 were the original Mac heads but he with the bowed legs.</em>
So that's why you would always look at my legs before saying, "Hi Norbert." ;-)
I started at Compugraphic in 1981 through the Agfa acquisition, through the time Bayer wanted to gain name recognition in the USA again, then back to just plain Agfa. I left in 1994 because I became increasingly interested in the new multimedia, interactive program development and the beginning stages of the graphical Internet (it was all text messaging prior to that).
The "high-end" type and imagesetting equipment were beginning to slow down in sales, and the Type Division (Font Technologies) was able to produce and sell fonts independently of Agfa front end devices. It was basically a rush to convert our outline library to PostScript, TrueType, etc. and at that time Linotype seemed to have had market lead. (A direct result of Apple partnering with Linotype for fonts after Agfa-Cg abandoned them because of the Lisa fiasco.)
But eventually "Font Technologies Division" prevailed and is now Monotype Imaging.

<div class=commentbody>Well, i think i've just been one-upped in the antiquated technologies department, several times over. I came into this in the last days of our Compugraphic machine, and a year later we got some PCs (yes, IBM XTs). For years I typeset in a v. little-known program called XyWrite: all manual coding, but which had certain features I miss to this day.

<div class=commentbody>Does anyone remember when Intertype and British Monotype both took the metal melting pots off their casting machines and substituted a camera. It was really cumbersome and silly, but they were trying to salvage the ir vested interest in the machine, and the did work pretty well.
I have a brochure here somewhere put out by the Monotype Corporation of England showing the caster conversion.

<div class=commentbody>>Marian< PCs (yes, IBM XTs). For years I typeset in a v. little-known program called XyWrite:
we use to use an IBM XT to write disks for Intellifont from Digital mainframes. Test them in DOS then run print tests on an HP laserjet II..I think I wrote my first CV in XyWrite.
Norbert I left Agfa in '93 to go to Microsoft. It's funny to find out that alot of people are still there. It weirds me out when I think of it.
The best thing I remember was there was a room bigger than a london flat that held positive and negative film versions of all typefaces in little grey trays. These positives were scanned on a drum scanner and used in the 8000 series of digital typesetters. The digital format was vector graphics and made the contours out of straight lines, even on curves. Then for the 9000 series they scanned them again and used two shifts of 40-50 people to convert these into Ikarus (line and arc) outlines. Then there was 'Type 3' unhinted PostScript. CgScript I think was Type 3 wasn't it?
I made a series of Intellifont fonts that were for the HP Deskwriter for the Mac.
Then there was Homogonized Outlines!!! HP Deskwriter fonts and PostScript.
The first TrueType fonts we tested were lighter than the PostScript fonts. Almost a different weight like a light to a regular. Early Postscript was very heavy. The marketing people were confused.

<div class=commentbody>Oh I'm excited that someone else knew XyWrite. I typeset the promo material for Robert Bringhurst's <i>Elements</i> in it ... One of those tumbles of letterforms down a page (or wait, maybe that was an Alcuin Society poster .. I forget), done non-wysiwyg.
Then we had a programmer who wrote some kind of script to get XyWrite to talk to the image setters. We also had programmed tables for adjusting kerning pairs. These would produce paper tapes, which were then loaded into the image setter for each font.
oh. the joy.

<div class=commentbody>"XyWrite" was the 1irst application to compose a postscript authored color magazine with custom fonts!
When people talk about computer phototypesetters, the thing that comes to my mind is always the Smell(s) and the little grinding noises that meant bad things were happening. Also, there are a lot of links 'n things here I just can't follow, but computer controlled phototypesetting was a rather short-lived, (by type stds.) transitional technology between metal, and computers, (seeing as some users skipped it completely for text). It was pretty ugly from preparation of fonts to alignment accuracy. Spinning drums, I'd think are not so exciting as some other things about phototypography. Manual setting of display type lasted a long time, (80 yrs?) allowed amazing quality, and anyone with 1/2-a-type-brain, some film, ink and a knife could make a font as good as anyone else...it was arguably the first really democratic font format since...(place argument here). So, I think the best educative source on photo type, or at least something that'd grab the imagination of young and hopefully susceptible typographically minds would be the massive twin volume photolettering specimen books, (though either volume would do), (see House, maybe).

Now you're onto something. Certainly a simulation of the font, and then perhaps galleys ... too bad i can't capture the smells, or the sound. Coupled with some pics, some details, some memories ... I'm done!
But really, I always did find those spinning drums fascinating ... and the flickering light.

well the smell was from the fixer. I use to work for a newspaper and spend about 4-5 hours in a photo darkroom then had lunch and another 4 hours in the darkroom. It didn't smell you just start hating the sun and it was a bit difficult to drive home. </div>

Yeah but how about...
- the sound of a filmstrip clip letting go and your font thrashing into shreds at 100+ revolutions per second!
- the sound of your photopaper galley (with 2 hours of typesetting) getting jammed into an accordian wad during processing!
- the tearing sounds of photopaper wound too tightly in the paper cassette holder!
- the 2000 decible lambasting you get from your boss when the newspaper ad insertion deadline for photo-pasteups past an hour ago!

Some things never change. Even in digital typesetting, a grinding noise is still a reliable indication that something bad is happening. Most likely that your hard drive is crashing.</div>

<div class=commentbody><em>- the sound of a filmstrip clip letting go and your font thrashing into shreds at 100+ revolutions per second!</em>
This never happened to me, although we did once set an entire book with the wrong font on the position for the old style numbers, so that all numerals (except page numbers, which were, i guess, in another font) came out as some garbled mess; no-one noticed, and the book got printed that way. That was fun.
<em>- the sound of your photopaper galley (with 2 hours of typesetting) getting jammed into an accordian wad during processing!</em>
which you'd then have to unjam by picking at it with the top end of a pica ruler.
or the dreaded realization that the the paper that went into the processor never came out the other side and was therefor wrapped around one of the rollers, drenched in chemicals.
