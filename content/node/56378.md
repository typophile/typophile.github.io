  me identify this typeface. It's from a 1908 short film about the streets of Barcelona.
  Filmed on the front of a streetcar. I am really interested in the F. So if anyone
  has any suggestions it would really help me out.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nRaf\r\n\r\nP.S.
  here is the link of the short if anyone wants to check it out.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJdwzY1o7k8&eurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Efacebook%2Ecom%2Fprofile%2Ephp%3Fid%3D48902954&feature=player_embedded"
