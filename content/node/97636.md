  society I have been tasked to take over marketing. Previous incumbent produced logo
  and flyers using attached graphic. I have tried WhattheFont and usual suspects to
  try and identify this font but so far no luck. I have been unable to match the 45
  degree cutoffs on the lowercase 'i' or match the roundness of the 'r'?\r\n\r\nAs
  it is done on a home PC (spec unknown) I had assumed it would have been a default
  or failing that a free download. It is a recent (last 5 years) piece of work.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in anticipation\r\nMark [img:sites/default/files/old-images/TAC logo 2012 cropped_4120.jpg]"
