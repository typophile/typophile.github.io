  body: "<blockquote>but I think I like Miller the best</blockquote>\r\n\r\nDefinitely
    agree. I just think Playfair was a bit inspired by Miller. Although, in the description,
    Playfair doesn't mention Miller when talking about their inspiration. "

  body: They're in related styles, both referencing historical models. Hence they
    have some things in common, but to my eye at least, much more not in common.

    I certainly agree with the both of you after further research. But instantly I
    thought it heavily resembled Miller which is why I wanted to ask for your opinions.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>but

    there. I can see the differences between the two but there are similarities for
    obvious reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\nHopefully I didn't come across as attacking Claus
    or his hard work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi there. I started design on what became Playfair, as my first stab at typeface
    design for Gerard Unger\u2019s class when he was teaching at the Rietveld. That
    was back in 2008. At that time I knew nothing of Carter\u2019s Miller, only Georgia
    I did know, and later found out how it was derived from the Miller design (or
    was it the other way around?). In any event, at that time there was no particular
    inspiration for my proto-design.\r\n\r\nWhere Miller is much closer to the historical
    \u2018scotch romans\u2019, my Playfair is much more of a conglomerate. You can
    read more about the sources of inspiration on my website, but I did not mention
    there that also Caslon was an inspiration (eg. the C). What I did do was to think
    that the large x-height and slightly condensed letter shapes of go\xFBt hollandais
    would probably also be a good idea for a typeface meant primarily for screens,
    and that I hadn\u2019t seen that done before (not really counting something like
    ITC Garamond et al.) done in a transitional design.\r\n\r\nSo was Playfair inspired
    by Miller? No is the short answer. If anything, it\u2019s present form was inspired
    by the original specimens of Caslon, Baskerville, Fry, Miller, and Wilson which
    I viewed at St. Brides."

    able to download the TTF files (which look great!), but it said somewhere other

    can also download specific source files directly from this Google Code Project

    work around - you can guess the folder name of the font family, and add it to
    the end of the browse URL, like this:\r\nhttp://code.google.com/p/googlefontdirectory/source/browse/nobile\r\nNote
    you can navigate to the 'src' directory on the left to find SFD, VFB and OTF source
    files. \r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n...my various attempts at guessing the folder
