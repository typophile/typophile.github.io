  of lettering but my arm is being twisted. What ever happened to posting  anonymously
  ? <BR> <BR>I am looking for a letter style that the copy appears to be cut out or
  incised out of a wood board, even better if it also has a western or cowboy feel,
  any suggestions? <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>gln'

  body: Gerald, if its only a couple of words I suggest you set the type in Photoshop
    and use layer styles to create the cutout feel. That way you can choose almost
    any font that works with the style

    &#62; Pillow Smooth &#62; 390% &#62; Size 2 &#62; Soften 4 <BR>Inner Glow &#62;
    100% Opacity &#62; Solid Color &#40;choose your own&#41; &#62; Technique: Percise
    &#62; Source: Center <BR>Inner Shadow &#62; Multiply Black &#62; 75% &#62; Distance
    7 &#62; Size 7 <BR> <BR>This will give you a good starting point. When you make
    the effect put the type above your wood image and change the blending effects
    to Multiply'
