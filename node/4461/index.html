		<div class="commentbody"> Jack, <BR> <BR>If this is your first attempt, I&#39;d say you have an excellent specimen. I especially enjoy the small nuances like the lowercase &#34;l&#34; and the &#34;a&#34;. The lowercase and smallcap &#34;z&#34;, however, seem out of place, probably due to the rounded angles. &#40;I recognize the constraints you face when you get that small.&#41; <BR> <BR>What can you share about your design process? Did you build it directly in a bitmap editor or did you draw it pixel-for-pixel in Photoshop? <BR> <BR>jb </div>

		<div class="commentbody"> Mmm, you know, you&#39;re probably right about the Z&#39;s... I thought they seemed a little &#34;off&#34; while I was making them but I didn&#39;t think of any other way they could look. <BR> <BR>First step in the design process was Photoshop at 1600% zoom with a one-pixel pencil/eraser, for quick experimentation and such. Then in Fontographer I used the rectangle tool in conjunction with snap-to-grid to recreate the shapes as outlines. <BR> <BR>Designing this font, I am constantly beset with fear that I&#39;m unwittingly plagiarizing other people&#39;s work, but I suppose when one is designing a five-pixel high &#34;E&#34; there are only so many possibilities available. The one character I&#39;m fairly sure is unique is the lowercase Y; but maybe I just haven&#39;t done enough reading... <BR> <BR>And yes, this is the first &#34;draft&#34; of the typeface. </div>

		<div class="commentbody"> You&#39;ve nailed the small caps in relation to the the U&amp;lc. Many fonts out there use a &#39;unicase&#39; approach for variety &#40;including one of my own&#41;, whereas you&#39;ve created something much richer. <BR> <BR>I wouldn&#39;t be concerned about the &#34;embarrassment of riches&#34; in terms the number of bitmap faces out there. The majority of them could only be called alphabets--with no attempt at serious punctuation, let alone international characters. Kudos for that. <BR> <BR>//joe </div>

		<div class="commentbody"> Really nice work! <BR>I&#39;d like to see how this would look as a normal face &#40;full size scaleable&#41;. It sure looks handsome.  <BR> <BR>There was mentioned the smallcaps and lowercase &#39;z&#39; falling out in relation to the rest of the typeface, I have the same feeling towards the smallcaps and lowercase &#39;x&#39;. When looking at the &#39;x&#39; it seems too wide. <BR> <BR>It is by far a richer 8-bit character set i&#39;ve seen and looks promising. <BR> <BR>&#40;By the way..im new here and will watch out this space as I&#39;m working on several character sets myself and would like some constructive and qualified critique when I feel the time is right for it.&#41; <BR> <BR>Good luck!!! <BR> <BR>Yours, <BR>Sbo </div>

		<div class="commentbody"> font looks great. i like the descending numerals. i would have to agree that the lc &#39;x&#39; looks too wide. it is also too bright compared to the other characters. a problem easily remedied by mixing some of the diagonal with a verticle pixel or two or three or four. </div>
