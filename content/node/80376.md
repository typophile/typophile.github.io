body: Has anyone experienced FontLab generating a font where the kern classes differ
  from the source VFB? I'm completely stumped as to why this is happening or how to
  get around it. I suppose I could use TTX or FontForge to replace the kern classes
  but I can't help wondering if this is a known bug, maybe FL needs a reinstall or
  perhaps I've overlooked something. Any insight would be appreciated.

  body: Do you have some more details? (You should not expect that generating a font
    and then importing it will produce you exactly the same VFB with which you started.
    Some things will change because of different data structures, especially when
    it comes to AFDKO-syntax features and FLS5-syntax classes.)

    font is generated from FontLab that is the result.

    that\u2019s what you care about).\r\nProbably, it is only happening during the
    re-import to FL."

  body: Thanks Frank and Karsten. Yes, the kern pair is missing in InDesign. I have
    V in the Y class and one of the changes in the generated font is that it no longer
    has a class for Y, which in turn effectively deletes the A/V pair as well. Weird.

    the Mac version of FontLab did not give that warning.\r\n\r\nSo it seems there
