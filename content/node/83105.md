body: "Hey everybody,\r\n\r\nI'm working on sans serif with different variants with
  different contrast. The same idea as optical grades, accept they're not to make
  it look the same at different sizes. There made to make it look different, yet the
  same, disregarding the size. This would make the term 'optical grade' misleading
  and unclear. Can you think of a good alternative?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nJasper

  body: "If it's not about size, and it's not about gain, then we do indeed need a
    new term. Rotis comes to mind: it uses \"semi\" to mean \"not really\"; in the
    serif pair it means semi-serif, while in the sans pair it means \"sans with contrast\"
    (since in oldschool terminology \"sans\" means no serifs <em>and</em> no contrast).
    But it sounds like you have a gradation going, so you need a scalable term - maybe
    \"contrast grade\", or \"CG\" for short; you might suffix \"CGn\" where \"n\"
    is an integer. Or maybe dump the \"G\" from the suffix.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "It's not an \"optical\" idea, not is it grading.\r\nOptical variants adjust
    for a variable such as size or letterspacing.\r\nGrading variants adjust for press
    gain.\r\n\r\nBut what you are doing doesn't adjust for anything, it is purely
    stylistic.\r\n\r\nAs such, you are working with a stylistic axis.\r\n\r\nOther
    stylistic axes are of course weight, horizontal scaling, and slant\u2014as in
    the famous Univers family chart.\r\n\r\nSince then, following the metafont/multiple
    master idea, other axes have been explored.\r\nFor instance, Chalet proposes a
    fashion axis.\r\nPenumbra has a serific axis.\r\nCarl Crossgrove invented an axis
    of agitation with Reliq.\r\nI explored the axis of oldstyle/modern, with Sense
    and Sensibility at the extremes.\r\n\r\nWhat you have is an axis of contrast.\r\n\r\nAnother
    term for an axis might be a scale, but scaling is used in typography to mean \"making
    bigger or smaller\".\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, any Multiple Mastering/tweening \u2014
    including optical sizing and grading \u2014  is done along a design axis.\r\nBut
    I think that if you identify your fonts as variants along the stylistic axis of
    contrast, that is quite clear about what they are, and distinguishes them from
    opticals or grades.\r\n\r\nOr just call them contrasts (as one would refer to
    weights), e.g. Jasper Low Contrast, Jasper Medium Contrast, and Jasper High Contrast.\r\n"

  body: "Thanks guys!\r\n\r\nDunwich, that's what I want to get rid off.\r\n\r\nFrode,
    Giving them a number will imply the idea of optical sizes. I want to make clear
    that the low contrast variants also work great at display sizes. I will however,
    make a list of the MINIMUM pnt sizes each variant can be used. I've just made
    a large pdf to work that out for myself :-)\r\n\r\nFlorian, I guess the term 'optical
    grade' was wrong to start with?\r\n\r\nFlooce, I never noticed that. It's good
    to know I'm not the only one with this idea :-) \r\n\r\nHrant, Yes. That's the
    direction I was heading in. Though I still fear that 'contrast grades' is too
    much like 'grades'. I say, dump the G from the suffix, and dump the Grade from
    the term :-)\r\n\r\nMr. Shinn, I would say a normal (non-typographic person would
    say these are grades, but in the complicated and confusing terminology of typography,
    it's not grading indeed. I think 'contrasts' is just what I was looking for!\r\n\r\nIs
    there any objective for using 'Contrast 1' instead of 'low contrast'? With a total
    of 9 grades it's gonna be hard to figure out the names of everything between 'high
    contrast' and 'low contrast'.\r\n\r\n<cite>\"variants along the stylistic axis
    of contrast\"</cite> Just wonderful!\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The categorical distinction between \"Contrasts\" and \"Opticals/Grades\"
    is apparent if you consider that it would be possible to make Optical or Graded
    variants of your Contrasts.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how this would be achieved in
    practice, but theoretically:\r\n\r\nBecause press gain adds an even amount to
    both x and y dimension, it shifts contrast and changes horizontal/vertical proportions.
    Therefore if you wanted to maintain the same contrast in different press situations,
    you would indeed have to make graded versions of your different contrasts.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    you would have to shrink the heavier grades in size.\r\n\r\nIt would be a better
    practice to say, \"when press gain is heavy, use Contrast 7, Grade 1\", rather
    than \"\u2026use Contrast 8 because it will look like Contrast 7\".\r\n\r\nThere
    doesn't appear to be a standard terminology for grading: H&FJ (e.g. Chronicle),
    FB (e.g. Benton) and Typotheque (e.g. Greta) have different approaches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
