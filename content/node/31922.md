  body: "It might help to know what parts of Poster you like and what you envision
    as making it more modern. I was thinking of 'more modern' perhaps not having serifs
    on the top and bottom, like a heavy weight of Storm's <a href=\"http://www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/families-56-areplos\">Areplos</a>,
    but that's not a Didone style type, if that's what you wanted.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I'm in the midst of redesigning a small newspaper, and the mark, in my opinion,
    is outdated. I don't really want to change it, but we've been discussing making
    the mark a little more modern looking. I have no problem with keeping the old
    one, since it is an established and recognizable brand. But at the same time,
    updating it wouldn't be so bad either.\r\n\r\nHere's the current mark that has
    been the identity of the paper for as long as anyone can remember:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gator_4010.jpg]"

    modern, but I'm wondering if it's too similar that it wouldn't make an impact.\r\n\r\nWhat
    do you think?"

  body: What about <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/lanston/ltc-bodoni-26/">
    LTC Bodoni</a>?  It's close enough in style to give some of the same feel, but
    the small caps make it a little more on the cutting edge.
