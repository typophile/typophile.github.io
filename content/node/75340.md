  easyJet to Facebook, road signs to clothing labels, we are surrounded by a world
  of type. But what messages do its different kinds convey? In this extract from his
  new book, Just My Type, Simon Garfield looks at the history of typefaces, the obsessive
  care taken over their design \u2013 and the role they play in shaping our lives.</a>"

  body: "David, you found a couple of inaccuracies in that article \u2014 fair enough.
    But claiming the book is \"full of factual errors\" is a little much if you haven't
    read it yet. <a href=\"http://stewf.tumblr.com/post/1219288879/just-my-type-by-simon-garfield\">I
    read most of the chapters</a> and enjoyed it very much."
