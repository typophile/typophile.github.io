  personal.  I want to create a hand mirror out of a script lower case \"b\" but I
  am having some trouble getting the word to be legible.  The word is \"behold\" and
  originally I was going to do a mirror for each loop in the \"b\", \"h\", and \"l\".
  \ But I am now at the point where I am would be happy with just the \"b\"!  Has
  anyone ever seen anything like this?  Or could give me some pointers.  I don't know
  if I am looking for inspiration or encouragement....or if this is even the right
  place for my question since I have only been working on this for a few days!  Sorry
  if I am not in the right place, but thanks to anyone who could help me!\r\n\r\nAmanda"
