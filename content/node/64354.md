body: "Greetings,\r\n\r\nI was wondering if anyone knew this specific blackletter
  typeface.\r\n\r\nThe sample comes from Lord Hobo, a beer hall located in Cambridge,
  MA (which is in Boston for anyone who does not know) near the campus of the Massachusetts
  Institute of Technology. I have looked through reams of blackletter on MyFonts but
  have yet to identify it precisely. I have also posted it on WhatTheFont.\r\n\r\nThe
  website I pulled this sample from is: <a href=\"http://lordhobo.com/\">http://lordhobo.com/</a>\r\n\r\nThanks
  all.\r\n\r\nAa[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_60_4215.jpg]"

    during my search. Guess I'll have to ask the manager next time I am in Boston.
    What a perfect excuse to go there!\r\n\r\nThank you for your response.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAaron"
