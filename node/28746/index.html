		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think there is a definite correlation.  Scripts are looked upon as an artform that is &ldquo;new&rdquo; to this young generation.  With script fonts, they get to avoid actual handwriting, yet have the look of the perceived artform.  Old fogies like me who had their wrists slapped for poor penmanship and never learned to type, have a different outlook:-)</p>
<p>Students now take notes on a laptop and &ldquo;pass notes in class&rdquo; using text messaging on cell phones. Handwriting today is mostly self-communication and rarely is intended for reading by others.  When this generation becomes teachers, handwriting will become something to be studied by archeologists and historians instead of school children.</p>

Teachers only have so much time to mark papers &ndash; they barely have enough time now to skim through them as it is to ensure the student has some sort of grasp of the topic.  Throw in having to decipher poor handwriting, and you&rsquo;d get even more of them quitting.</p>
<p>Like Chris, I&rsquo;m also in the &ldquo;old fogey&rdquo; category of having had cursive beaten into me at school: mine was pretty bad until I took a course in calligraphy as a teenager, and then it actually became legible.</p>
<p>For awhile, that is, until I started spending way too much time in front of a computer.  ;-)  I think the only reason it&rsquo;s still as functional as it is could be because I still edit hard copies, by hand, with a red pencil, most of the time.  And I&rsquo;ve got an old friend who still has the most incredible cursive hand &ndash; a quick note from him looks like a fine engraved invitation.  I&rsquo;m jealous!</p>
<p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s come down to &ldquo;those who can write beautiful cursives, do: those who can&rsquo;t, use (insert name of favourite cursive font here).&rdquo;</p>

<p>If only it had ever been as simple as &ldquo;those who can do, those who can&rsquo;t  are just people who will always have crummy handwriting so let&rsquo;s just accept it.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m a big believer that so many people hate cursive because they got sick of elementary school teachers complaining about every little loop not being perfect, so they just stopped using it as soon as they hit sixth grade. It&rsquo;s kind of like Matisse and his drawings–he just stopped showing them to people, so nobody saw most of them until after he died.</p>

<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s more of an indictment about how cursive is taught more than anything else.  So long as my teachers could read it, they weren&rsquo;t anal-retentive about exact forms.  ;-)</p>
<p>I was also lucky to have several teachers in high school who had unique (well, for the 60&rsquo;s in Canada!) scripts and actually encouraged students to inject some individuality into their own handwriting: bet that doesn&rsquo;t happen much anymore&hellip;.</p>

<p>Bickham Script Pro has proven that with enough OT programming you can fool most of the people most of the time, even if you can&rsquo;t fool professional designers all of the time.</p>
<p>I agree with Dan&rsquo;s other point. Calligraphers, type designers, font vendors and definitely OpenType engineers should see the death of cursive as a huge marketing opportunity. People and companies will always need &ldquo;handwriting&rdquo; and those that can provide it will be in high-demand.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Why is cursive only called &ldquo;handwriting&rdquo; and not printing, printing being viewed as some sort of drooling, in-bred cousin that no one wants to acknowledge? Both styles are written by hand, are they not?</p>
<p>I prefer to print, but even then I connect letters in a very cursive-like way. So you could say I curint or pursive. Or not.</p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s world, cursive and its close relative calligraphy, are pretty much relegated to vacation postcards, wedding and other invitations, and national constitutions. While cursive feels more personal, that personal feeling also hampers its legibility. After all, you can easily read your cursive writing because it&rsquo;s written by you. Hand it to someone else, and they might have some difficulty (exhibit 1: doctor&rsquo;s prescription notes).</p>
<p>I wonder if Egyptian teachers 1900 years ago complained that only 15% of their SAT students knew how to write in hieroglyphics?</p>

<p>Instead, I got slapped down at kindergarten because I already had a rudimentary cursive hand: one of the benefits of home-schooling, I guess.  My teachers made me print and go through all their silly drills anyway, but my handwriting didn&rsquo;t really change much until high school, where I picked up the habit of writing Euro numbers (with the bar through the 7).</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and then my first serious job after university, when I had to hand-sign 40 letters.  &ldquo;Ruined&rdquo; my signature ever since by making it hard to forge.  ;-)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Computers didn&rsquo;t kill cursive handwriting, superior pen technology did. It just took this long for the zombie to stop moving.</p>
<p>From our perspective, it&rsquo;s nice that it created more possible variants of letterforms. But from a practical perspective, what we&rsquo;re looking at is a system derived from the artifacts of very messy writing, adapted over the years for the limitations of quills and nibs, and codified into bizarrely rigid rules for equally rigid schoolteachers. They drum these rules into modern kids who, with their graphite pencils and ball-point pens, have no idea what is so great about not lifting the pen from the paper that justifies suddenly making writing so complicated.</p>
<p>I knew something was up in third grade, when the edict &ldquo;NO LOOPS!&rdquo; dominated our cursive exercises. Having been taught the previous year to write with looped ascenders by another teacher, I was already getting the idea that I was there to humor the whims of authority rather than to learn anything of real value.</p>
<p>Today I have handwriting that comes in serif, semi-serif, sans, and italic. I can write in legible semi-serif faster than I could write in genuine cursive. I&rsquo;m not even sure I remember off the top of my head exactly how all of those crazy-pretzel capitals are supposed to go.</p>

<p>Sports has never suffered in the midwest of the US. Granted, the arts have. Alas, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s quite in the same camp as to why Cursive is falling out of favor&hellip;it&rsquo;s just that people do not use it. My generation was taught it, but no one I know uses it. The computer hasn&rsquo;t helped it survive either. It&rsquo;s just time for it to go, it seems.</p>
<p>And you bring up a good point, Nick. Perhaps gap in the system where cursive once fit in is now replaced with knowing HTML and smilies and LOL/OMG/WTF texting &lsquo;language&rsquo;. ;o)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Fully cursive speedball writing is the hardest thing to read, I figure.
If you flip (mirror) all kinds of writing, it is the hardest to read, even for an accomplished reader. At least with a stressed (broad pen) nib, fully cursive, the stressing gives some cues as to which strokes are part of the letter and which are joins.</p>
<p>If software could be created to read cursive speedball script, that would be very useful in discovering much about the reading process. What is the state of the art on this? Is it true that OCR software only works for discrete letters?</p>
<p>I wonder if being able to write cursively has an effect on how fluently one is able to read it &ndash; I mean, greater than for printed type. Have any studies been done on this?</p>

<p>Hmmm. Can I borrow this idea?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not in Chris&rsquo;s or Linda&rsquo;s generation. Thank goodness. The last signifigant memory I have of Penmanship class, which was a tiny slot within Spelling, was of our Fourth grade teacher leacturing us on how we would all be getting whacked thouroughly for the forms of our script, if it had been an earlier time. She lamented that that avenue was lost. She then went on to point out that she would have been no less sparing on me, though &lsquo;that time&rsquo; would have had my functional hand tied behind my back.</p>

<p>Choz, you&rsquo;re right about having your left hand tied behind you back in the old fart days.  I was actually pretty good with both hands until I hit grade seven and had a doctrinairian who was strict, and that was the end of my days of writing well on both sides.  (I do think it has helped my typing though!).</p>
