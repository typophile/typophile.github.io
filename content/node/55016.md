body: "Okay, say I want to purchase a classic typeface like Perpetua (Eric Gill).
  I would want the Open-type version with the text figures, small caps, etc. (The
  regular version came/comes with MS.) Where would I buy it?\r\n\r\nIt's originally
  a Monotype face. On their [[http://www.fonts.com/FindFonts/Detail.htm?pid=427634&/cgi-bin/MsmGo.exe?grab_id=0&page_id=12762&query=PERPETUA&SCOPE=Fonts|website]],
  you can pay $99 for seven fonts, including 3 weights of titling. But do these fonts
  have the text figures and small caps? Their website is a bit confusing, and doesn't
  convince me... \r\n\r\nAt [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/perpetua/buy.html|Myfonts]],
  you can pay $99 for four fonts from Adobe. Of course one could go directly to [[http://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?nr=0&event=displayFontPackage&store=OLS-US&code=1380&newsample=Perpetua&view=View|Adobe]]
  for the same thing. Is this the same font software as from Monotype, with just a
  different name, and without the titling fonts? And why or why not purchase from
  one or the other? Support Myfonts? or cut out the \"middleman\"?\r\n\r\nThen, [[http://www.linotype.com/216419/perpetuacomplete-valuepack.html|Linotype]]
  is selling a 7-font package for $246. This looks like the same package that Monotype
  has, but for more than double the price. Is it? Or is <em>this</em> the version
  with the small caps etc? Then maybe the Monotype version is the plain jane version?\r\n\r\nI'm
  sure many other vendors are selling Perpetua, at different prices, maybe different
  versions--[[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/monotype/perpetua_pro_virtual/|Fontshop]],
  [[http://www.itcfonts.com/fonts/font/pid/427605/Perpetua\xAE+Pro+Complete+Family+Pack/detail&grab_id=0&page_id=67986&query=Perpetua&SCOPE=ITCFonts|ITC]],
  oh wait, ITC <em>is</em> Monotype, uh ... or no, \"powered by Monotype Imaging\",
  whatever that means.\r\n\r\nIt's a bit confusing out there in the online font marketplace.
  I'd appreciate the guidance from some experienced font-buyers here. (Or maybe there's
  a good thread on this already?)\r\n "

  body: "The $99 packet from Fonts.com does not seem to have all the OpenType features
    that you might want. If you search for Perpetua, scroll down until you see the
    Perpetua \"Pro\" complete package. This should cost about the same as the OpenType
    Pro package at Linotype. These are the newest, most fully-featured OpenType versions
    of Perpetua. Adobe's versions are older, and don't have as many features. The
    font data on the Fonts.com and Linotype website should be the same.\r\n\r\nNote
    that Monotype also sells Std versions of these same fonts. These are easier to
    find on the Linotype site, I think. They'll save you a bit of money. Primarily.,
    the difference between the Std and Pro Monotype OpenType fonts is in language
    support, not typographic features (but always look at the icons and read any descriptions
    anyway!). The Pro fonts will cover the Central and Eastern European languages
    that use the Latin script, while the Std fonts are primarily marketed at the languages
    in the Americas and Western Europe.\r\n\r\nIf you want a Monotype font, you'll
    be best served at one of Monotype's websites (Fonts.com, Linotype.com, itcfonts.com
    or faces.co.uk). Each of those sites have their own histories. I have a feeling
    that each site also has features that certain customer groups tend to like more
    then others. Who knows! But I hope that I've been able to answer your question
    about Perpetua."

  body: The pricing is generally going to be the same on all the retail sites. If
    you want to see what's included in each font, you can see the entire character
    set at MyFonts or FontShop who have the most advanced viewers.

  body: "Thanks for the help. I did not realize that Linotype and Monotype were merged,
    that there are four websites for Monotype. I do find the FontShop viewer to be
    very helpful in determining exactly what one gets in a font.\r\n\r\nIs [[http://www.fontmarketplace.com/font/perpetua-titling-regular.aspx|fontmarketplace.com]]
    legitimate? How can they offer the regular titling at $5?"

  body: "Alack and alas! I have examined the Perpetua from Monotype on our computer--the
    one that shipped with MS Office--more closely. This not even close to the [[http://books.google.com/books?id=eTJ8khmZie0C&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_summary_r&cad=0#PPA400,M1|Perpetua
    that I love]]. Does anyone know if that version (1.76, 1991\u20131995) has been
    redrawn for the current \"Perpetua Pro\" font? Because the spacing is sad, and,
    well, the letters are like skeletons.\r\n\r\nI am discovering the tragedy of classic
    typefaces digitized. The Perpetua I know is from a 1970 book printed in Japan;
    an offset reprint of a letterpress original..."

  body: Ascender is attempting to sell to the non-professional market, the kind of
    people who tend to resort to free fonts (bundled or freeware) because they think
    fonts are too expensive. The fonts are only offered in TTF format and, other than
    good multi-lingual support, don't have advanced typographic features. I don't
    think it's a bad idea if it gets people to pay for fonts who might not otherwise.
    Given what they are offering in terms of selection and format, it probably won't
    lure many people away from the professional font market.
