  i'm keen to get stuck into. so far i have just sketched a few ideas for fonts but
  as yet have not looked into software.\r\n\r\ni'm aware that fontlab studio is 'the
  one' but at the minute i just dont have the money to shell out on it.  The alternatives
  seem to be type tool at $99 and fontforge which is free.\r\n\r\ndoes anyone have
  any experience of the latter two and can advise me what to get? at the minute i'm
  not too concerned about the fancy stuff - ligatures and the like, i'd just like
  to create a basic font in maybe regular and bold. i have illustrator and a reasonable
  grasp of beziers, although i believe it is better to create the characters within
  the font software - do these programs have this facility?\r\n\r\nmany thanks for
  any replies.\r\n\r\nJonny"

    is slicker than FontForge and will ease you into FontLab, should you desire to
    go that route. FontLab does have a trial version, so download that and FontForge
    and see which you like better and which fits with your budget better. '

    in TypeTool, you'll be able to apply in FontLab Studio later. Also, the file format
    (.vfb) is fully compatible. \r\n\r\nAdam\r\n"

  body: "For a newbie (I should know, I'm one ;) ) Typetool is more than enough. I
    wouldn't know how to do class-based kerning even if I could :)\r\n\r\nBig recommendation
    for typetool, if you outgrow it I do believe you can upgrade tyeptool-->fontlab"
