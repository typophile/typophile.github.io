  my book isn't exactly a new discovery. I decided to post a book that I purchased
  based solely on the cover. I do that more than I probably should. It turned out
  to be a really interesting memoir. When I first spotted the book in B&N I was drawn
  to the overall vintage quality of the cover. I love the way the designer incorporated
  the the \"paperclip\" with the photo, and the hand drawn doodles on the cover. The
  inside flaps are made to look like notebook paper. I did not know it when I purchased
  the book, but I believe the title and author text is Mrs. Eaves. I used Mrs. Eaves
  with my final type project last semester and really love it."
