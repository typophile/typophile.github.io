body: "Hey Guys-\r\n\r\nWondering if anybody can lean me in the direction of any existing
  typefaces similar to these? I've added a few examples, obviously different but I
  really like the style, especially the solid serif one. They are some custom work
  by the fantastic crew at Non-Format. I'm wanting to find some abstract solid typefaces
  similar to do some experimenting for a poster design. Full credit to Non-Format
  love there work!!\r\n\r\nThanks for any help in advance!\r\n\r\nCheers"

  body: "these bits look like someone took their type in illustrator, converted to
    outlines, created an offset path, and then cleaned it up a bit. the fonts are
    VAG Rounded, some version of Carendon and Myriad Bold.\r\n\r\nBelow i have applied
    this process to Myriad Bold. You can see that I can easily derive the result from
    this with a bit of cleanup:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BlackDevilPDH051607_4487.gif]"
