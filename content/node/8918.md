  body: I&#39;m not sure what makes you think this is based upon another font.  Logo
    designs are not necessarily made by modifying fonts -- I am not a logo designer,
    but I feel pretty confident that this is a true statement. <BR> <BR>If you are
    trying to find a starting font to modify for a similar result, maybe <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-souvenir/bold-italic/testdrive.html?s=Sunkist&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Souvenir Italic</a> in a heavy weight would be a bit similar.
    At least the &#39;s&#39; would be similar. Overlay the &#39;u&#39; and &#39;n&#39;,
    remove the &#39;i&#39;-dot, and at quick glance you might be fooled, if you weren&#39;t
    comparing them side-by-side.

  body: I think they may have used <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-clearface/black-italic/testdrive.html?s=Sunkist&amp;p=72"
    target="_blank"> ITC Clearface Black Italic</a> as a basis. <BR>All the elements
    are there, especially the &#40;difficult to construct&#41; &#34;s&#34;.
