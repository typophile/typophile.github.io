body: "Hello, I am finishing a typeface that has 3 or 4 alternative glyphs for the
  same letter on FontLab. Not knowing much of programing I've been able to solve a
  lot problems searching on the web for I find that the FontLab Manual is not very
  friendly for me.\r\n\r\nI use this link (below) for the final touches for my font,
  this page has been very usefull, but it does not specfy what to do if you have more
  than one alternative letter for one character\r\n\r\nhttp://blog.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/post/238296379/how-to-add-opentype-alternates-in-fontlab\r\n\r\nI
  would write him but he has not replied to any of his question/comments of other
  users\r\n\r\nI named my glyphs as he suggests! For example\r\n\r\na.alt1\r\na.alt2\r\na.alt3\r\na.alt4\r\n\r\n...and
  such\r\n\r\nWhat's written right below is where I get stuck, copied from his web.
  My main question is, how do I program for a.alt3 and a.alt4?\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nAnd
  finally, the code block for SALT. \_Click the + again and cut and paste this:\r\n\r\nfeature
  salt { # Stylistic Alternates\r\n# Latin\r\nsub @salt1 by @salt2;\r\n} salt;\r\n\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nThis
  is all I need to complete post my font.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\nMario Arturo"

  body: "You're right, the code you reference only provides for one alternate per
    glyph. A substitution rule for a glyph with several alternates uses a different
    syntax:\r\n\r\n<code>sub <strong>glyph</strong> from <strong>class</strong>;</code>\r\n\r\nSo
    for an 'a' with four alternates, the rule would be:\r\n\r\n<code>sub a from [a.alt1
    a.alt2 a.alt3 a.alt4];</code>\r\n\r\nSingle substitution rules (\"by\") and alternate
    substitution rules (\"from\") can't be used in the same feature/lookup. So if
    you're using classes to minimize the code for single substitutions (as in the
    example from the website), you'll need to create separate lookups. For example:\r\n\r\n<code>feature
    salt { # Stylistic Alternates\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;lookup single {\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sub
    @salt1 by @salt2;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;} single;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;lookup alternate {\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sub
    a from [a.alt1 a.alt2 a.alt3 a.alt4];\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;} alternate;\r\n} salt;\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nNote
    that glyphs with multiple alternates should be removed from the classes used for
    single substitutions, so that there's a 1:1 relationship between the glyphs in
    @salt1&nbsp;and their alternates in @salt2.\r\n"

  body: "Turoturom: <em>Does your last paragraph mean I should eliminate everything
    I put in CLASSES cause I no longer need them or just leave all the ones I named
    .alt1?</em>\r\n\r\nAssuming most of your glyphs have only one alternate, and you're
    using predefined classes to code those alternates in a single rule (as in the
    example you referenced), then you'd want to strip those classes of any glyphs
    that have more than one alternate (including the first \".alt1\"), and leave just
    the glyphs that have only one alternate. Since glyphs that have multiple alternates
    must be coded separately, leaving them in the original classes would be redundant
    and could possibly lead to conflicts.\r\n\r\nIf you're following Adam's example
    (which may well be better practice, especially if you have many glyphs with multiple
    alternates), it would make more sense to scrap your original classes completely
    and create new classes containing the alternates for each glyph. So instead of
    classes like\r\n<code>@salt1 = [a b c d e ...];\r\n@salt2 = [a.alt1 b.alt1 c.alt1
    d.alt1 e.alt1 ...];</code>\r\nyou'd have classes like \r\n<code>@a_salts = [a.alt1
    a.alt2 a.alt3 a.alt4]; \r\n@b_salts = [b.alt1 b.alt2]; \r\n@c_salts = [c.alt1];</code>
    \r\nand the corresponding rules in the <code>salt</code> feature would be \r\n<code>sub
    a from @a_salts; \r\nsub b from @b_salts; \r\nsub c from @c_salts;</code>\r\n\r\nNote
    that using \"from\" rules requires that even lone alternates be referenced by
    a class, either predefined (as above), or inline (as in <code>sub c from [c.alt1];</code>).\r\n"

  body: "A short explanation for the classes: \r\n\r\n1. You can define named classes
    in the FontLab Classes panel. \r\n\r\n2. You can define named classes in the lower
    part of the OpenType panel. Then you use the syntax @a_salts = [a.alt1 a.alt2
    a.alt3 a.alt4]; -- in fact, when you define the classes in the Classes panel,
    when FontLab Studio is compiling feature definitions, it does (behind the scenes)
    write the classes using the @NAME=[...]; syntax, and then the features are compiled.
    Note that in the Classes panel, you don't use the \"@\" in front of the name,
    but in the OpenType panel, you do. \r\n\r\n3. You can define unnamed inline classes
    as in \"sub a from [...];\"\r\n\r\nThese are all interchangable. You can define
    your \"a_salts\" OpenType class in the Classes panel, or the \"@a_salts\" class
    in the lower part of the OpenType panel, or you can write an unnamed class right
    in the \"salt\" feature definition (\"sub a from [...];\"). That doesn't matter.
    \r\n\r\nIndeed, the \"sub ... from ...\" syntax ALWAYS uses a single glyph before
    the \"from\" and a class after the \"from\" keyword. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam\r\n"

    be correct. As for where to put it, the <code>calt</code> feature (Contextual
    Alternates), or possibly <code>cswh</code> (Contextual Swash), seem most appropriate.
    Add the feature to list in the OpenType panel as you did for your other features,
    then add the rules.\r\n\r\nLike the manual explains, you must define the @LETTERS
    class to contain every glyph that might appear as part of a word (which may include
    alternates). That can be done using the Classes panel, adding the class and dragging
    in the glyphs.\r\n\r\nTo better explain the contextual code:\r\n\r\n<code>ignore
    substitute @LETTER e';\r\nsubstitute e' by e.init;</code>\r\n\r\nLoosely translated:\r\nIgnore
    the following substitution rules if there's any letter preceding the glyph 'e';
    if there's not, substitute the glyph 'e' with the glyph 'e.init'.\r\n\r\nFor a
    broader understanding of the logic behind contextual substitution rules, it might

    should understand that as a line making an instruction about two different elements

    \"LETTER e'\") and says ignore the substitution of an e that follows anything
    in the LETTER class. Your LETTER class should, well, have all your letters in

    go any glyph that would be considered a letter or part of a word -- any glyph
    that, if it were to appear before an 'e' or 'l', would trigger the \"ignore\"
    rule and prevent the substitution. At the minimum, the LETTER class in your Classes
    panel should include:\r\n\r\nLETTER: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U
    V W X Y Z a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z\r\n\r\nAdd to that
    list any accented/international letters, ligatures, alternates, etc.\r\n\r\n\"GSUB\"
    is the technical name of the OpenType table that contains all of the font's substitution
    features, not the name of any standard feature you should be using for substitutions.
    The \"calt\" feature (Contextual Alternates) would be a logical choice.\r\n\r\n<code>feature
    calt {\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;ignore substitute @LETTER e';\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;substitute
    e' by e.init;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;ignore substitute @LETTER l';\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;substitute

    say \"alternative ligatures\" do you mean that you already have standard versions
    of those ligatures with the glyph names \"ss\" and \"os\"? If that's the case,
    your code should technically work, although it will only trigger a substitution
    if the <em>actual ligatures</em> are already present in the text. A better approach
    might be to have the substitution occur in the \"liga\" feature if one of the
    alternates has been substituted.\r\n\r\n<code>sub @s_salts @s_salts by ss.alt1;</code>\r\n\r\nTranslated:
    substitute any pair of alternate 's'es with the alternate 'ss' ligature.\r\n\r\nThat
    may not be the ideal substitution, depending on how the alternates relate to the
    ligature, but hopefully hints at a potential solution. Also, the naming convention
    for ligatures is to place an underscore between the letters, i.e. \"s_s\" \"o_s\"
    \"s_s.alt1\" \"o_s.alt1\", but that makes no difference technically."

    technically. If you use nonstandard names such as 'os' or 'ss', it will not always
    be possible for applications to reconstruct the original unicode values associated
    with the underlying text which may cause problems for searching, cutting and pasting
