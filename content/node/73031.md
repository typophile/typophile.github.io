  seen this one around in a few different places, but haven't yet been able to pinpoint
  it. It seems like it's similar to Helvetica, except a bit more narrow and some letters,
  like \"D\", \"C\", and \"O\" are less round. The \"R\" seems to be very distinctive
  as well, with the tail curving outward a decent bit more than Helvetica's \"R\".
  Any help identifying this would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"
