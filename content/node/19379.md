body: Almost everyday I have to sift through "SmallCap" emails. <strong>I</strong>
  think they are about fonts, but they are of course about small cap stocks. Darn
  those dastardly spammers! They can't trick me with their tricky font masquerades.

    Deleted them. :)\r\nI am getting 'quite a few' of them, as well.\r\n\r\n<em>(
    Plus, All those 'Get A New Logo' messages. :) Maybe those spammers should check
    what I DO, before sending me those 'offers'. )</em>"
