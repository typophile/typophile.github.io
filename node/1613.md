  body: The font was called &#34;Hairpin&#34; and was a Visual Graphics Corporation
    font that was included in the Image Club old Letterpress 6.0 CD &#40;and earlier&#41;.
    Corel/Bitstream renamed it to a very rough homonym by calling it &#34;Harpoon&#34;.
    &#40;It is no longer in the Image Club collection, as sold now by Agfa at fonts.com&#41;.

  body: I&#39;d like to add that I was the person responsible for digitizing Hairpin
    for the Image Club library back in 1989 from a set of original VGC photo-typositor
    film reels. I still have numerous older versions of the Letterpress product in
    the Image Club archives should anyone be interested in obtaining a copy of the
    older Image Club library. Contact me off-thread.

  body: Nice to &#39;meet&#39; you Grant. I have the Image Club  Letterpress 5.0 and
    6.0 Collections, bought before Image Club was acquired by Adobe, then sold to
    Getty Images/Eyewire, then acquired by Agfa-Monotype.  <BR> <BR>As for you being
    a &#39;newbie&#39; Adriano, this is a field were the old-timers have maybe only
    been here for 15 years, things change so fast. I got my first Image Club catalog
    back about then, and bought my first fonts in 1993 starting with one of the earlier
    Letterpress CD&#39;s &#40;3.0, I think&#41;. Just like so many other trendy things,
    &#39;everything old is new again&#39; with fonts too.  When House Industries gets
    to digitizing the Photo-Lettering typefaces they recently acquired, we&#39;ll
    all get to see how true that saying is.

  body: Hi Mike. Nice to meet another Image Club customer &#40;and fan?&#41; Here&#39;s
    a bit of historical information about the first Letterpress &#40;and ICG type
    library&#41; - when it was first released, it consisted of twice the number of
    fonts that currently existed in the Adobe Type Library at the time. Mind you,
    they were all type three PostScript format, but.... <BR> <BR>I know I&#39;ve only
    been hanging around the type business for 15 years or so, but I definitely feel
    like an old-timer.

  body: great, thanks a lot guys. this ones been stumping me for a while. <BR> <BR>its
    quite bizarre, i&#39;ve never really seen this typeface used anywhere, then the
    other day i saw it used in my local street press in some cheap ad and thought
    &#34;how did they mangage to get a copy of that font?&#34;. now i know. <BR> <BR>i
    also thought &#34;harpoon&#34; was an unusual name for a typeface like that, hairpin
    is much more fitting.

  body: The Image Club digitization of Hairpin was the only one that ever there was,
    as far as I can recall. The Corel <i>Harpoon</i> was actually the ICG version
    renamed for third-party bundling in a brief lapse of marketing judgement back
    in the early 1990&#39;s.

  body: iota,  <BR> <BR>I did say that Agfa no longer has &#39;Hairpin&#39; in the
    Image Club collection. Grant offered to help out with any needs from that old
    collection that included &#34;Hairpin&#34;, so perhaps you should contact him
    off-list. Your other course would be to use <a href="http://www.fontseek.com"
    target="_blank">Fontseek</a> to see if anyone has placed it out on another site.
    If it&#39;s been renamed again then it would be luck more than anything if you
    find any other versions.

    known aliases, no leads to where i could buy it from though. <BR> <BR>sorry mike
    Y, i read this as meaning i could get it from fonts.com. <BR> <BR>&#34;&#40;It

    It makes you wonder how many generations of conversion it took to produce that
