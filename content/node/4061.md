    it <BR>could do with looser letterspacing.

  body: This has potential. However, what this gains in  <BR>friendliness it lacks
    in--for lack of a better word-- <BR>naturalness. Some of that &#39;looseness&#39;
    just looks like  <BR>ordinary sloppiness. I&#39;m mainly talking about the forced  <BR>w
    and v, the squashed x, the chunky s. <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t let me discourage you.
    When you finness this to  <BR>look more natural &#40;less forced&#41; is when
    you&#39;ll have a  <BR>winner. <BR> <BR>Strudel is a great name, by the way.

  body: have i been pigeonholed as hater? sheesh. hrant- thanks for noticing my humble
    concessions on &#42;some&#42; points in the comic sans discussion. but i still
    hate it. <BR> <BR>as for this, it is better than comic sans. i&#39;m with joe
    pemberton on the v, w, and x. too swashy. the tails on i and l are too pronounced
    as well. the s seems smaller than the other characters. <BR> <BR>is this intended
    as a simulation of handwriting? i think this is what might result if comic sans
    and meta had kids. or maybe more accurately, if someone tried to draw meta by
    hand. <BR> <BR>my wife just walked in and said, &#34;that looks kind of like...
    <B>comic sans!</B>&#34;

    looking. <BR> <BR>that is a long f. i&#39;d like to know some of your thoughts
    about designing it with a super long descender. <BR> <BR>it seems a little clustered
    in the small body copy. <BR> <BR>gushy? oh, man. i guess i just wanted to point
    out the difference between a font actually designed for children and a font used
    &#40;ostensibly&#41; for children with no reasoning other than it looks childish.
    <BR> <BR>andrij- what were your original intentions for creating this font? i&#39;m
    interested in the history of it. '

    look at the visual gap in words like \"squeamish\". You may want to shorten it
    some.\r\n\r\nAnd wtf, people? This no more looks like Comic Sans than Garamond
    looks like Times."
