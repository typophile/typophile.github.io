  from some of you with better knowledge of appropriate use of type in a resume.\r\n\r\nI
  have been working with piegnot light for my name/logo. I realize their is some level
  of subjectivity, but would you consider it to be too flashy for a resume?\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any help. I have to make a decision soon and just don\u2019t want to design
  around it if it\u2019s a bad idea from the start!"

  body: Ok. Piegnot has a pretty strong flavor. More than "for a resume" tell us what
    sort of work you do.

  body: Um.. I'm going to have to say no on that one. I think Peignot is too decorative,
    and can deliver flavor and punch but I think its best used in advertising.. for
    a resume, I'd say go with a strong serif font for your headlines- goudy or baskerville-
    rather than Peignot, which is an art-deco font, and if used clumsily can easily
    look cheesy.
