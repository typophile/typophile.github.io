body: This book cover really caught my eye because it was so simplistic yet it conveyed
  the message perfectly. It is about society's obsession with being happy; sometimes
  its OK to feel blue. The cover illustrates that idea by using the type as an upside-down
  smiley face. Pefect![img:sites/default/files/old-images/happiness_5106.jpg]
