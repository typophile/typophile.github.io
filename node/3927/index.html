		<div class="commentbody">Aw. Disappointed by Fast Company's new cover. I found the last flag incredibly endearing. The compartmentalized cover with the red/black/mustard/cyan color combination makes my stomach queasy. <BR> <BR>Inside, now it's pretty much Standard-Issue Magazine Layouts with no Storm at all, which was what I liked best. Now seems corporate and robotic. <BR> <BR>they refer readers here: <BR><A HREF="http://www.fastcompany.com/keyword/redesign62" TARGET="_top"><a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/keyword/redesign62">http://www.fastcompany.com/keyword/redesign62</a></A> <BR> <BR>Business 2.0 also changed some things. Mimi Dutta, the new creative director, is a little more creative with her feature heds. And she likes DOTS a lot. &hellip;  <BR> <BR>Mac Addict did a redesign three or four issues ago. There's a face inside that I can't seem to figure out. I'll get a scan up during the week. <BR> <BR>As far as throwing magazines out&hellip;I have a pack-rat collection of magazines dating back about 10 years. Nobody understands why I keep them, including myself&hellip;.I just can't read a magazine and *throw it away!* <BR> <BR>bj</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Fernando Gutiérrez is a Pentagram Partner and the creative director of COLORS nowadays - he studied at LCP in the early 80's - apart from COLORS &amp; MATADOR - he just did a Phaidon photo book on Gandhi - he is in my book one of the finest graphic designers of the classic mould working today. <BR> <BR>Now with that said i am a big fan of his stark approach at COLORS which i think is the right response to the content and the line of photography they accomodate <BR> <BR>His work is much more lively at MATADOR where he reaches astonishing expression from so few means (one typeface, often subtle and consistent colors and blinding work in proportions)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">i'm glad to see this discussion because i publish a small (in circulation, not paper size) print electronic music magazine and since my volunteer art director left, i have to design the mag myself.  <BR> <BR>just to detail my experiences as a non-designer by trade, i can say i have the following problems: <BR> <BR>1) i have to work in black&amp;white (can't afford color) <BR> <BR>2) image quality of photos i receive are of a wide range of quality, from very good to horrible. <BR> <BR>3) i can't afford any design help. <BR> <BR>within these constraints, i'd love to get some suggestions on how to work. it seems to me that if you get great images to begin with, that helps make a good look for a magazine already.  <BR> <BR>i am currently planning on using a new font, Sys, for the text and a futuristic-looking font&ndash;House Spaceport 3009 for heads. one problem i am having is trying to create some kind of &quot;header&quot; for our different sections of reviews that meshes well with the rest of the page. perhaps i can put together a couple of PDFs when i get home for some input. is there a way to upload to this site? <BR> <BR>thanks, sean portnoy <BR>grooves magazine&ndash;experimental electronic music magazine <BR>groovesmag.com</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; Fine Print on Type <BR> <BR>I was thinking maybe you were right*, but then I found my copy: &quot;Galliard: a modern revival of the types of Robert Granjon&quot;, Matthew Carter, Visible Language XIX 1 Winter 1985. It's really a great article, providing some unique insight. And when you read it, you might join those of us who have no doubt whatsoever that Granjon was the best type designer we have yet seen (although Gill might have had more raw talent). <BR> <BR>* <BR>I *think* I've scoured all the issues of Fine Print, and I distinctly remember going through Fine Print on Type at UCLA-SpecialCollections, and when I do that I never leave without copies of the interesting parts (even if I have to cajole them into exceeding the photocopy limit), but I don't remember anything about Galliard. Dare I suggest it wasn't memorable? Pardon the candor, but what is it about Bigelow that he never manages to turn me on? Maybe it's me. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

He does make some interesting observations and quotes a little Carter. But the <I>Visible Language</I> article sounds infinitely more interesting &ndash; being from Carter himself and all that.

		<div class="commentbody">Yes it does!  :-) <BR>MasLucida (a set of structures, not a font) was based on Lucida because Lucida has very &quot;elemental&quot; letterforms, so they didn't need much change in order to look like *structures*, like I wanted. But I don't think I'm the only one who thinks that a *usable* font must not look so &quot;structural&quot;. By the way, on the way from Lucida to MasLucida I incorporated certain &quot;phase one&quot; changes to Lucida, in order to make it more bookish, and as a result facilitate a comparison to MasLucida' intentions. Besides increasing the extenders and tightening the spacing (I *think* - it's been a while), I added a bicameral &quot;g&quot;: it wasn't easy to get it to feel right, but except for a slightly large head that needs to be scaled smaller to the left, I think it provides for a better solution than the original mono &quot;g&quot;. <BR> <BR>Maybe one thing that bugs me is the scope of the Lucida megafamily: it really seems too strict, formally speaking. Some of the constituent fonts look like they've been inbred just a *bit* too closely to become healthy adults&hellip; <BR> <BR>hhp</div>
