  body: "There is a font called <strong>Roman38 Sample</strong>\r\nand the copyright
    field reads:\r\nCopyright (c) 1995 by Richard M.Coda and PC Type Desktop Publishing.\r\nFor
    information on purchasing the full character set of these fonts \r\nplease call
    908-370-9619 or Compuserve 73700,2307 or AOL: rcoda@aol.com\r\n\r\nThe glyph outlines
    are matching your sample, but the shading/slant is different on each glyph, so
    I suppose you have to purchase the specific font you want to use.\r\n\r\nFivos\r\n"
