  body: 'DESIGNING A CUSTOM DEVNAGARI TYPEFACE FOR AN INDIAN TELEVISON CHANNEL While
    designing a typeface for a televison channel in an indian script, technical factors
    such as lack of unicode support in software used makes use of standard formats
    difficult. In such cases one needs to work out a format which is both fuctional
    and would do justice to the visual aestheic of the script. Life OK Hindi is a
    custom typeface designed for the TV Channel LifeOK for the purpose of television
    broadcasting & big billboard communication. The typeface is playful & friendly
    yet legible on television screen. The family of 3 weights- Demi, Medium, Bold
    - includes basic vowels, comsonants, matras, half letters, akhanda conjuncts,
    punctuations, Devnagri and Latin Numerals. The Fonts were hinted for use on television. '
