  Main Navigation\r\n<img src=\"http://whatdesign.ca/main_nav.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n2. Sub
  Navigation \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://whatdesign.ca/sub_nav.png\" />\r\n\r\n3. Secondary
  Navigation\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://whatdesign.ca/secondary_nav.jpg\" />\r\n\r\nI
  thought it may be Arial or something like that. You expertise would be greatly appreciated.
