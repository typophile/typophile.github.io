  dozens of fonts and couldn't find it. I found similar but not exactly that one.
  Way how they link together, is it possible for normal fonts or maybe this was edited.
  What do you think? Big thanks"

  body: There is few similar fonts with that kind of "R" and more similar look to
    this than Helvetica. So I probably will take some of those and edit to that look.
    Thank you anyway. Maybe someone will find something more similar so I won't have
    to edit so much.
