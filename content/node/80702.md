  with metal foundry type. As such, my choices of typeface are limited. In fact, I
  often find myself designing pieces to suit the type I have rather than procuring
  type for a preconceived design.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m planning a large broadside \u2013
  in the 11-by-17-inch range \u2013 with a short poem on the subject of sleeping too
  late on Saturday. It\u2019s a contemporary poem, but the diction is a little nineteenth-century
  and the tone is romantic but restrained.\r\n\r\nI have some 36-point Bernhard Modern
  Roman Bold (ATF 670) with enough letters to set the poem \u2013 a major advantage.
  I think it will suit the text, but that might be the result of staring at it too
  long while thinking wishfully. My question for you is: Is this, in general, a well-regarded
  typeface? My printing skills are finally starting to mature but I\u2019ve only just
  begun to understand typography.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nBarbara\r\n"

    doesn't fit any of those niches, but it's an elegant, eminently readable face
    which is well-suited to poetry (short lines and lots of interline air)."

  body: Thanks, oldnick. The Bernhard Roman does look good, set as you say in short
    lines with ample leading. My only other choice is Bulfinch, which I don't think
    has been digitized. Here's an example. What do you think?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bulfinch

    Makes me think of... gardening ads? \r\n\r\nI hope I'm not doing the tacky thing
    and linking to a free ripoff of a commercial font, this is what I found via google.
    If the link's not kosher, my apologies.\r\n\r\n[ Link removed by Admin ]"

  body: "Good call, CreeDo. It may very well have been used in gardening ads. The
    description in McGrew's <em>American Metal Typefaces</em> says that it was \"designed
    in 1903 by William Martin Johnson on behalf of the Curtis Publishing Company,
    owner of <em>The Ladies' Home Journal</em>\" and that it was \"used extensively
    as heads in their magazine,...\"\r\n\r\nThis is exactly why, faced with a choice
    between this and the Bernhard Modern, I'm leaning heavily toward the latter. If
    I am convinced that neither will do, the next candidates are Caslon 471 or Goudy's
    Original Village, though I would have to scale down the broadside since I have
    them only in 18 and 16 point, respectively. These are the challenges of working
    with metal type, but often such limitations lead to happy creative discoveries.\r\n\r\nBarbara"
