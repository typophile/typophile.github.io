  body: Tease. This looks close - G may be questionable. (RA kerning seems on, but
    not DV or DA.) Seems to be one-off demo font (UC and numbers only). Unattributed;

    body: Thanx for your reply! It seems to be the font although the Old Road Signs
      Font is a bit coarsely put together. The G, B, O are a bit roughly made, but
      there must be a relation between this font and the RHCP album font, because
      of the similarities. Thanxx
