  body: There's an overpriced pizza place near me that uses Hobo exclusively for their
    identity, menu, etc. Surprisingly, it looks okay. I think the reason Hobo usually
    looks bad is because it's usually used by people who want to use all the fonts
    they have at the same time, and <em>nothing</em> goes <em>with</em> Hobo.

  body: "I think this would only be a big challenge if you do a lot of work for spas
    and Thai restaurants (Papyrus), an elementary school (Comic Sans), and for Hobo...
    I guess maybe Korean nail salons in strip malls? I don't know if Hobo is really
    overly used anymore, although I guess it was 10, 20 years ago. But I don't think
    I've ever been forced into using those typefaces, and I would imagine a good portion
    of designers have never used them either. Just because they're visible in the
    American (and probably global) landscape doesn't mean graphic designers are to
    blame -- I think it's usually churn and burn signmakers who are so cheap they
    only have the fonts pre-installed on Windows at their disposal.\r\n\r\nThat said,
    this pledge can't hurt anything. Although maybe a more interesting challenge (possibly
    a Typophile challenge?) would be to use these three typefaces in an appealing
    way."

    that says \"non-Western\" but which doesn't seem to invoke any bad ethnic stereotypes.\r\n\r\nSo
    it's heavily used because it is an obvious choice that fills a real pressing need
    in today's world.\r\n\r\nAnd, thus, of course it's used for purposes that have
    nothing to do with Ancient Egypt, but instead, say, India or the Far East - one
    place I see it every day is in advertisements for \"Trade Winds for Success\",
    a local program of pre-apprenticeship training offered to persons of Native American
