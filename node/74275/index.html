  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi guys,

I'm currently redesigning a website for a shoe company who sell moccasins and Native American looking boots. I've been asked to design a new logo as well and finding it difficult to create something that is suitably clean and simple, yet with the subtle flavour of a native American style.

I was also using Gotham for all body and heading text (for it's American vernacular assosications) but just discovered Hoefler and Frere-Jones don't allow their fonts to be used via @font-face on websites (which is what I'd like to do).

So a couple of questions for you:

1) Does anyone know any fonts I could use as a starting point for the logo? I'm not looking for something over the top, or with too much character. I'd quite like to keep it simple and fresh, for a fashion brand, but with a touch flair and Native American style.

2) Does anyone know any fonts similar to Gotham? I'm particularly fond of the full bodied roundness of it.

Any help or directions you could point me in would be massively appreciated.

Cheers guys!

If this is cultural appropriation, then an ethnic stereotype font would be quite appropriate.
Something Arts and Crafts? -- that was an early 20th century movement when anti-industrialism in Western culture found common ground with pre-industrial ethnic handicrafts, incorporating such things as Navajo rugs in the Mission style.

As there really is no satisfactory authentic typeface reflecting Native American culture, and Kabel didn't come to mind, and those Playbill-like faces that suggest cowboys and the old west were too stereotypical... they played it safe and used a typeface that suggested exotic cultures in a politically-correct way that was readily at hand.

		<div class="commentbody">Wow. This is the first time I've checked the thread since posting my questions and I'm completely blown away by the amount of responses. Thanks so much for all your input guys, it's incredible.

I would like to respond to everyone individually but that seems a bit daunting, some of you pointed out some interesting things though:

eliason - Proxima Nova is perfect for the body font, and it's also a font used on Type Kit. Brilliant! That's that problem solved.

Kristian Sics - Aztlan looks great, I love the way they use it in the pdf. Although I think it's a bit too bold and overwhelming for what I'm going for.

dezcom and frode frank - I agree with both of you that a hand drawn face might be better, but for this particular brief my client is more interested in aligning the brand within the contemporary fashion market, and I've been explicitly told not to 'over do it' and to keep it as clean as I can but still reference the American element of it. The thing is - their website is full of photographs of moccasins and fringed suede boots, so the whole hand made and natural side of it is more than apparent. It seems like stating the obvious if I were to do a hand rendered logo, which is why I'm leaning towards using a typeface as it would sit more unobtrusively on the website, allowing the products to speak for themselves. Although I do agree the typeface should be soft and naturalistic. Thinking of a brand like [[http://www.innocentdrinks.co.uk/|Innocent Smoothies]] - the simplicity of the logo type gives room for the playfulness of the logo mark and other brand imagery. Which I think is the same kind of effect I'm trying to go for. Having said that... I might try a fairly restrained / controlled hand rendered type.

frode frank - Those links to the hand lettering are beautiful, especially this [[http://www.google.no/imgres?imgurl=http://typophile.com/files/Numbers_5227.JPG&imgrefurl=http://typophile.com/node/47313&usg=__fwBE8Y64AflAKayGj8dlT3lYdhw=&h=583&w=751&sz=136&hl=en&start=5&sig2=evjsub9oj7I0F4cQ_HIwAg&zoom=1&um=1&itbs=1&tbnid=KOS3PsoiXT4JxM:&tbnh=109&tbnw=141&prev=/images%3Fq%3Dnative%2Bamerican%2Blettering%26um%3D1%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dsafari%26sa%3DX%26tbs%3Disch:1&ei=4pWSTJW4MYiLswbVhrGFCQ|cursive one.]] Thanks for pointing those out man.

aarhaus - Kabel is very good contender, cheers for pointing that one out.

paul d hunt - tiptoe is also a good one. Although there's something about it I'm not so sure about, can't put my finger on what though.

Nick Shinn - You're absolutely right, although as said before, client is looking to align the brand in a high fashion context and over stereotyping could just lead to it looking like a cliche. I think my original post wasn't clear and I wasn't sure quite what to ask for, but this thread has definitely helped me to think about what to do with the logo. I know I'm looking for something simple and contemporary, but to have some humanistic elements to it - a subtle nod towards the natural and native side of the products. 

aluminium - I agree with you, that was my first thought when I chose to use it. But the company I'm rebranding are a UK distributor for the original American brand. And for a UK audience, to have a body font like Gotham is enough (when put into context of the surrounding brand elements) to give a sense of where the products come from. Also the Moccasin, when originally brought to the consumer market in the early 20th century, was sold as a souvenir item. And it was your white middle class families on vacation that bought them - since then the moccasin has become a relaxed, casual, house ware shoe (in America especially or so I'm told), so the idea of referencing white America is now just as much apart of its history as its natural, native counterparts. For us Brits at least anyway.

I may come back when I've got some logo designs to show you guys.

Thanks so much for all your help, keep them coming if you think of more.

		<div class="commentbody">In reality there really isn't a specific 'Native American' (USA title, or preferred to be called First Nation/Aboriginal to the rest of the world) style font, if it is, typically its really cliche and straight cheezy. Anyways the main font used before, used to be Papryus till every designer in North America OVERUSED it on everything cultural/ethnic, and now its just not a good looking font anymore, it was nice if used in a small title like way, but its life span is now over.

So a similar version to Papryus I found was [[http://www.windowfonts.com/fonts/fine-hand-let-plain-1-0.html|Fine Hand LET Plain:01]] it kind of has a rustic look to it, with its fabric like edges, this would be good for a small title/headline, and nothing more than that.

But in most cases, I just prefer to use what I typically use for any other headline/title and body text, suitable for the main target audience (young, old, edgy, conservative, playful, grand, excitement etc.) and use the logo and design aesthetics to show the First Nation theme, as that is my design specialty, considering I am of First Nation's ancestry, from the Pacific Coast of British Columbia, Canada.

Good luck! & show us your finished logo after!</div>
