  | MyFonts.com]].\r\n\r\nGreat Bromwich takes the ideas in Greater Albion\u2019s
  Bromwich family that little bit further. It can be used on its own, or as a compliment
  to Bromwich. Great Bromwich uses specially re-designed large and small capitals,
  to enable that bold headline statement to be made with impressive Edwardian flair.
  In the spirit of railway travel posters and illustrated news journals, its a wonderful
  font for poster design, or for book covers and other work with a period theme.\r\n\r\nThere
  are some examples of \u2018Great Bromwich\u2019 in action on its own and alongside
  the Bromwich family on our [[http://gatf.wordpress.com | blog]].\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Frank- actually were averaging about one a fortnight.\r\n\r\nNick- If you
    look on another thread here you'll see what's next is 'Clementhorpe', inspired
    by some lettering found in an old enamel advertisment for chocolate.  The name
    'Clementhorpe' is actually a roundabout hint of what chocolate was being advertised."
