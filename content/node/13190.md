  in the midst of solidifying my pencil drawings, this is what I have so far. I've
  actually got all the caps done, and the standard number set. Tentatively titled
  Northern OS. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nEric"

    making these letters digital is when the form really gets going. Your ascenders
    and overshoots will probably change some once you start digitizing.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    Eric...I'm also originally from Cincinnati."

  body: "Eric:\r\n\r\nAlthough it's an early stage you should consider <strong>lowering
    the \"M\" inside vertex</strong> and <strong>shortening the \"F\" horizontal bar</strong>.
    It shure has nice balanced proportions though. Keep it up!\r\n\r\nCheers"
