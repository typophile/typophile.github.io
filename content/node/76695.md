body: "shakespeare globe london 2010\r\n\r\nThe font is a modern (probably custom)
  SANS serif (S and I?). I have looked on what the font? I guess what i am asking
  is does anyone have any font suggestions that look similar.\r\n\r\nif not just have
  a look, its alright.\r\n\r\nIts not the most beautiful project in the world but
  really cuts through the posters that are all over town. Funny how the oldest theatre
  has the most modern approach. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/adamhayes-globe-bedlam_5860.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/adamhayes-globe-boleyn_5461.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/adamhayes-globe-henryiv1_5033.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/adamhayes-globe-henryviii_6391.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/adamhayes-globe-macbeth_6716.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/adamhayes-globe-merry-wives_4657.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/hayes-heraldry1_5780.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt

  body: "I like the posters too, but I'm a bit worried to look into the source as
    I think it might actually be a dafont freebie and I'll lose a bit of respect for
    them.\r\n\r\n<cite>Funny how the oldest theatre has the most modern approach.<cite>\r\n\r\nI
    think it's based on an early 20th Century constructivist style but it matches
    the timber-frame construction of the theatre nicely, but I'm not sure if being
    a 1999 reconstruction makes it count as London's oldest."

  body: I am pretty sure this is a custom font. I work for a movie theatre company
    that is showing this series, and we were provided with the font, named Shakespeare
    Globe (or something like that). I since got a new computer and no longer have
    it.
