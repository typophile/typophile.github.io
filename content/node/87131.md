body: "I've created a multi-page brochure in InDesign, and the client wants an \"editable\"
  PDF which would allow them to change text, etc, within Acrobat, or perhaps another
  non-InDesign program. \r\n\r\nSeems impossible to me. But thought I'd ask around
  to see if there is any fancy new software that would let a client open up and edit
  a PDF. \r\n\r\n"

    will need to license any font in wich the edited text is set in).

  body: "Text editing in Acrobat is really just intended for small tweaks, like fixing
    a typo or changing a number. There is no automatic text reflow, so things get
    ugly real quick when you make changes. An alternative is to make an interactive
    PDF with multi-line text fields, but that's really intended for \"fill in the
    blank\" spots in forms, not a way to create an entire document.\r\n\r\nI believe
    there are some programs intended for the prepress departments at print shops that
    allow more sophisticated revisions to PDFs, but I think they're pretty expensive
    and are not intended for use by non-professionals.\r\n\r\nRegarding the font issues,
    some fonts can be embedded in a PDF but to avoid licensing issues you'd probably
    want to stick to a system font that you knew everyone already had (Arial, etc).\r\n\r\nIf
    the client insists on the ability to make major changes on their own, I'd probably
    just grit my teeth and do the project in Word.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    to edit their own materials, they should purchase InDesign and learn how to use
    it, or get a professional to make the changes. \r\n\r\nClients expect websites
    to be a snap to edit, thanks to easy-to-use CMS solutions. Maybe those expectations
    are crossing over to print; clients seem to want to edit all their creative now.

  body: Note that there's also [[http://www.adobe.com/products/incopy.html|InCopy]],
    which seems to be a trimmed down, cheaper version of InDesign that always for
    editing, but not so much layout change. Is that what you're looking for?
