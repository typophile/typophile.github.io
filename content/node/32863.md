  your feedback. Please be gentle.\r\n\r\nThe typeface is all caps. It's based on
  some letters cast into the front of an old industrial building in San Francisco.
  The angular S was one of the original letterforms; I've also drawn a less eccentric
  alternate. There are also two ampersands because I like them both.\r\n\r\nMany thanks.\r\n\r\nMichael

  body: "The eccentric S looks fine, you don't need the more ordinary alternate.  \r\n\r\nDid
    the original sample have an 'E' or 'F' in it?  I would try the E with the middle
    horizontal as low as the bar in the A.  And try the F with the horizontal very
    high.\r\n\r\nI feel like I've seen this building in SF, but I can't quite place
    it.  Where is it?\r\n\r\n-matt"

    body: "Thanks for your comments, Matt. The original sample did include an F, and
      I'm trying to be as true to the original letters as possible, but I might include
      the variations you suggest as alternates.\r\n\r\nThe building is on Harrison
      Street, between 8th and 7th, here in San Francisco.\r\n\r\nThanks again.\r\n\r\nMichael"

    to photograph the lettering. It's concrete, with the letters impressed or recessed,
    right? A large industrial building with the lettering at the top. "
