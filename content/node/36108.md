body: "I've been asked to redesign the logo for [[http://www.ewedding.com|ewedding.com]]
  to make it a bit more elegant, refined, and \"Martha Stewart-esque\". Every icon
  I came up with came across as a little bit trite or cheesy (rings, flowers, birds,
  etc), so instead, I've tried to come up with a solution that just type based. \r\n\r\nThe
  custom W is an attempt to portray togetherness, closeness, and maybe even a stylized
  knot. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure if Clarendon is the right typeface to be using, and was
  hoping for some suggestions on other fonts that already have a loop in the W. Or
  even other fonts that might work for this. \r\n\r\nSo... does it work? If so, any
  ideas on how to refine it even more?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nJesse"

  body: I like it a lot, though the loop is used so much today by dozens of 'ribbon
    awareness' programs that it might be a bit overused.

    \       [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dstype/leitura-display/swashes/|Leitura

    looks a bit much in this context.  "

  body: "I like it a lot too. I prefer Claredon over Rockwell. Claredon has a much
    softer feel then Rockwell. The loop reads better and is more distinguished in
    Claredon then Rockwell. The Rockwell version feels like the loop gets lost. The
    weight in Claredon works nicely. The symbolic meaning comes across pretty clear.
    Having the word 'wedding' in the logo really drive the message home. \r\n\r\nmg"

  body: "Thanks for the feedback. I've been wrestling with it all day, and hola's
    comments just brought me around full circle. I think in the context of a wedding
    site, and with the word \"wedding\" right there, it just might work. \r\n\r\nI've
    attached another version with a tagline and some colour.  \r\n\r\nI'd appreciate
    any additional thoughts.. "

  body: "okay. 2 things.\r\n\r\n1. The tinting of letters is not really working for
    me. They kinda look like a mistake. I do like the softer color you used. Did you
    not like it as solid color?\r\n2. Adding a second graphic to the logo type kinda
    cheapens the logo. You might not need the sale tag graphic.\r\n\r\nmg"

    peach. It's really good though. Be proud!

  body: I think the "W" could be more swashy -- it would add a lot of elegance to
    the whole logo.
