    of the places Nick mentions in his 2003 article, only Typophile continues with
    regular, active dialogue. \r\n\r\nTypophile also has a large number of people
    posting from non-English speaking countries. This makes me wonder whether the
    type sites in other languages are less lively. Is this so? "
