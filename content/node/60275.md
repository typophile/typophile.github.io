  body: "I believe the technical term is \"radial gradient\".\r\n\r\nThere's a few
    different ways to make it. (assuming photoshop)\r\n\r\n-With the gradient tool.
    \r\nSelect the gradient tool, then click the radial icon on the options bar.\r\n\r\n-With
    a layer style.\r\nGo to the \"gradient overlay\" tab and select the radial option.\r\n\r\n-With
    a fill layer.\r\nOn the menu bar: Layer > New Fill Layer > Gradient... > Click
    OK > select radial"

  body: "Though feathering may give you similar results, using a gradient layer effect
    will preserve editing, so that you can duplicate and/or change the direction,
    color, etc more easily when needed.\r\n\r\nTry playing around with the angle,
    spread and opacity."

  body: 'Start with a light gray layer. Make a new layer on top and make a large,
    circular feather edge brush (0 hardness). Set your foreground color to white,
    then just locate where you want the center of the light to be and click once.
    To get an even more gradual blend, you can use multiple layers, stepping down
    the size of the brush on each layer while going from light gray to white. '

    use the airbrush with a large, soft edge."
