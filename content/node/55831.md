  body: "There is a Photo-Lettering typeface called Pacella Decatur Biform 6 that
    looks exactly like this lettering. It comes in three heights and one italic, but
    I am not aware of a digital version (certainly not by that name). The catalog
    that shows this was printed in 1965, and PLINC was active through the 1980's at
    least, until digital type replaced it for most uses.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    date. Is that about right?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Sorry Danny, the showings in these catalogs are only partial showings. It's
    the big drawback they have. In some cases they may also have microscopic showings
    of the rest of the alphabets in the back of the book, but they are incredibly
    small. Even with a pretty strong magnifier, you can barely make out the features.\r\n\r\nThe
    other place where film types can be shown is in the Phil's Photo book and in some
    of the Dover books by Dan X. Solo. I don't think I have seen this in either of
    those places. The best I can offer is to scan the specimen they do have in this
    catalog.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Remember, these samples in the book are only partial settings. I don't think
    this will go very far in helping you to create a font, but it will show you that
    this may be the one used on that album. The second line down I think is about
    the same proportions.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PacellaDecatur_5823.gif]"
