body: "Hi!\r\n\r\nThe query is related to the Helvetica typeface. Normally, Helvetica
  comes as a default typeface on both PCs and MACs.  Though Helvetica comes as a default,
  it is not licensed ( for e.g, arial comes packaged with windows hence there are
  no restrictions on its usage). Therefore, what do I do if i have to recommend Helvetica
  as a typeface to the client. Do I ask them to buy it for use in their communications
  or can they use it freely?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    a default type for many application surfaces and printers.\r\nAs a corporate typeface
    you should use Helvetica Neue (wich gives you also a wider choice of weights)."

    do we recommended them to buy it? Or do we just give it to them to use it (would
    that be illegal)? '

  body: "Design guidelines usually have one set of rules for designers, another for
    inhouse use. The latter often specifying a typeface that is available cross platform.
    In your case the natural fallback would be Arial, as neither Helvetica nor Helvetica
    Neue is bundled with Windows or MS Office.\r\n\r\nGiving them the typeface is
    illegal, so designers should purchase a license."
