  body: "Thanks so much.\r\n\r\nI find I have something called Old Style 7 - which
    I do not remember ever using and seems to be from a Linotype/Adobe library I once
    had.\r\n\r\nIt is a Classic only font, but I guess I could install it on an old
    iBook, do the setting on that and bring it over to my iMac as a pdf and it will
    still work - it would be for the prelims to a facsimile of a book set in the Monotype
    [such bad setting by a provincial printer I'd actually have expected a it to be
    Lino job ...].\r\n\r\nAnyway, do you think the prelims in Old Style 7 would look
    OK with Mono Old Style? I might just go for something quite different - Gill for
    instance, especially as I have it with the 'Alt 1' which is so much better for
    tables.\r\n\r\nThanks again, Colin\r\n--\r\nNo furniture so charming as books.

  body: "Old Style 7 is similar to Monotype Old Style. They come from the same period
    and are different foundries' versions of the same idea. \r\n\r\nThe only fonts
    that are \"Classic only\" are bitmap-only fonts. Older Mac outline fonts (TrueType
    or PostScript) work fine with OS X. You should be able to move the font to your
    newer Mac and use it there."

  body: "Thank you Mark,\r\n\r\nSeveral oddities: the Lino PS version seems much heavier
    than the printed Mono version. This is odd as the original letterpress is not
    under-inked when examined under a glass. And, even so it is heavier than the Old
    Style 151 in the green Mono binder, so the Lino must be much heavier than the
    Mono when both printed from metal.\r\n\r\nThe printer I worked for in the 60s
    and 70s was all Mono and would not be seen dead with an old style - except Caslon,
    Mono and S&B of course.\r\n\r\nI now realise that I got the 'Classic only' warning
    when I clicked on the screen-font suitcase, and that the T1 fonts installed themselves
    when I clicked them and that I had too many windows open to notice.\r\n\r\nStill
    not sure if I should use te Lino for the new prelims - or go for Gill Light with
    the Alt 1.\r\n\r\nCheers, Colin\r\n\r\n--\r\nNo furniture so charming as books.
