    Trump Deutsch]] by Georg Trump (which is offered for free by Dieter Steffman,
    who digitalized a LOT of blackletter typefaces, some better than others, check
    his the listing from the link above) \r\n\r\nAnother favorite is [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/weiss-rundgotisch/|Weiss
    Rundgotisch]] by Emil Rudolf Weiss\r\n\r\nInteresting contemporary interpretations
    of Blackletter are [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/blackhaus/|Blackhaus]]
    from Canada Type and [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/finefonts/fine-gothic/|Fine
    Gothic]] by Michael Harvey and Andy Benedek. "

  body: "I second riccard0's recommendation if you want an artistic interpretation
    of blackletter rather than a historical example. Gabriel Mart\xEDnez Meave's Darka
    is gorgeous. I set my notes from a Hegelian philosophy class in Darka just cause
    it's so darn pretty. It's also dense and very readable once you get used to it,
    but set it with plenty of leading for those ascenders, descenders, and vast capitals
    to breathe in.\r\n\r\nIf you're more historically minded, you might find this
    online blackletter history interesting: The Gutenberg Press: Five Centuries of
    German Fraktur, by Walden Font (http://www.waldenfont.com/downloads/gbpmanual.pdf).
    You can also download samples of many of the historical fonts they discuss from
    their site.\r\n\r\nBringhurst's The Elements of Typographic Style also lists some
    worthy blackletters, if you're looking for a list to get started with."
