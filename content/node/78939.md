  by italian futuristic type (not to say fascist one!).\r\nit is really fresh, so
  no time to make proper kerning. hpowever, some ligatures are already here. i am
  aware there are similar typefaces around, but i think this still has some potential
  & autonom character.\r\nwhat do you think?"

    that it might be confusing. as i mentioned, you can allways choose which case
    you going to use, you can turn ligatures on and off any time."

    it.\r\ncant see what is wrong with that."

  body: Beautiful!  The original caps look very fin de siecle/deco, but the lowercase
    looks a bit too different - almost Gotham-y.  They could definitely be two separate,
    wonderful typefaces if you ask me.  I think your original idea was a great display
    face.

  body: "I second Trevor. Upper-case are unpredictably randomly wide, lower-case are
    all predictably wide as any proportional font face. There should be two fonts
    in this family. The unpredictable one and the usual readable face.\r\n\r\nOne
    more thing. I think you should finish lower case because it looks promising.\r\n\r\nP.S.
    I especially like your question mark. Nice details."

    it looks wider.\r\n2. Tail seems too narrow for the wider top making the whole
    glyph unstable. I'd widen it a bit.\r\n\r\nSince these two things are related
    maybe one of them will improve the shape of this glyph so don't think you have
    to change both aspects. Try narrowing counter first then focus on tail."
