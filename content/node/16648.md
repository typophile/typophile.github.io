  body: Every bezier node and control point in every letter must, by the laws of type,
    be on a whole unit of the 1000 x 1000 unit grid. The finer your letterforms, and
    the more detail in them, the harder it is to describe them within the grid. A
    devil, that.

  body: "This one is worth doing. Pretty nice, even.\r\n\r\nAbout the grid coarseness
    issue: if you really get pushed into a corner you could give the font a negative
    talus (like script fonts often do), probably by making the x-height (mostly) fill
    the Em and letting the extenders go over. Especially since this thing will probably
    only be used to set one like at a time, this isn't unsafe.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
