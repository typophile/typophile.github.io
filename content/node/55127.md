  in these matters surrounding type, this is the bio I posted to my profile yesterday.\r\n\r\nI
  am a conceptual artist living and working in The Hague, The Netherlands; I make
  installations and performances that focus on the construction of meaning, and the
  need to say something, while at the same time say it is nothing. I use the media
  text, speech, graphic design and photography in my work because they constitute
  the language of the everyday, the language of which the exploration interests me.
  I also teach Interactive Media Design to students of Graphic Design at the [[http://www.kabk.nl|Royal
  Academy of Arts]] (KABK).\r\n\r\nI joined Typophile because I have been starting
  to feel a strong engagement towards the relation between technology and culture.
  The issues I am concerned with are not limited to type, but they are especially
  visible in this field because type is probably the most evident place for technology
  and culture to meet.\r\n\r\nThat means the type design community is not hampered
  by the distrust many other cultural disciplines bestow upon technology. Digital
  technology plays a central role in any type designer\u2019s practice, because it\u2019s
  the only means by which to achieve the desired end.\r\n\r\nWhy is this a good thing?
  Because if you use technology to produce culture, you have to make sure the technology
  is up for it. And if it is not, you make sure it will be\u2014which means you will
  enrich <em>what technology is</em> in the progress. The tradition of type designers
  building their own tools, and especially the work of [[LettError]], is an inspiration
  for me.\r\n\r\nAs a visual and cultural professional, I feel my skills, concepts
  and values are underrepresented in the digital public space. This is why I started
  the [[http://authoritism.ericschrijver.nl/|Authoritism]] project: I declared myself
  art director of the internet for 2009 in an effort to propagate the value of a visual
  and cultural perspective to the digital public, and the necessity of a digital perspective
  to the visual and cultural public.\r\n\r\nThis is from the website:\r\n\r\n<cite>When
  we bemoan the crudeness of digital technology, we act as if it is handling on its
  own accord. It is not. People are constantly making decisions that fundamentally
  influence the way we will be dealing with technology in our future lives, whether
  as designers or as end users.</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>And that is why we should get
  involved. As designers and artists, we are either busy with communicating something,
  or with the process of communication in itself. At this moment the screen is replacing
  paper as the medium we frame other media in. We should not see this as a big deal.
  The process of communication will remain. But E think we can't afford to let the
  primary medium of our time be one that we can not express ourselves in, or one we
  do not feel like applying our skills to.</cite>\r\n\r\nThese are pretty abstract
  reasons, but there is also a more concrete one.\r\n\r\nPart of the aim of the [[http://authoritism.ericschrijver.nl/|Authoritism
  project]] is to learn from the success of the Open Source movements. Making strategic
  decisions in what to distribute freely to whom seems to amount for at least a part
  of their success. I feel the cultural market lends itself well to much the same
  strategies, including the market of typefaces.\r\n\r\nSeeing that Typophile has
  seen members of different communities debating the merits and woes of \u2018giving
  things away for free\u2019, this seemed like a proper place to join the discussion.\r\n\r\n\r\n<dl>\r\n<dt>[[http://www.ericschrijver.nl|ericschrijver.nl/]]</dt>\r\n<dd>Personal
