  Johnson / Kingston? This is the largest image I could find, but any ideas on the
  sans and serif being used would be super great.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance![img:sites/default/files/old-images/159_johnsonkingston-innenansichten01_5805.jpg]"

  body: "I don't know if this is a font or artwork. It's a mash-up of features from
    Helvetica -- the closed counter _S_, and Franklin Gothic -- the angled spur on
    G and the straight leg on R.  The heavy weight letters are forced into the Procrustean
    bed of a perfect square and displayed in a monospace grid.  Whether font or artwork
    the effect is to suggest that the Protestant milieu in Basel was regimented and
    oppressive. At least for this subset of letters, the design is effective for condemning
    authority. But when you place a heavy W or M into this format it disappears into
    a box of black.  \r\nDon"

    / Kingston]], a Swiss design agency which is using a custom typeface for their
    own website... That could give credit to the a bespoke type as well... Reminds

  body: "Hi Buddy, I think you found the most likely base\r\n---start quote---\r\nThe
    closest I could find was Bureau Grot which are close to some letters, \"C\", \"S\"
    ,\"G\".\r\n---end quote---\r\nUsing Bureau Grot Bold, straighten the leg on the
    R, do minor adjustments to most letters and fit them into the square format and
    you should have it. W and M are going to be very closed and almost solid black
    boxes, but if you edit to ensure at least narrow open wedges in the right places,
    they would still be recognizable. \r\nDon"
