body: "The Y is the most recognizable glyph, with its curved arms. The entire face
  is strongly influenced with formal hand-lettering. I\u2019ve especially seen it
  used with religious materials.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s commonly used
  and readily available, but after quite a bit of searching nothing\u2019s turned
  up. I suspect it might be an Adobe product."
