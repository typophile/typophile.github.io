  body: Generally, the space between words should not be greater than the space between
    lines. B violates this rule.

  body: Thanks you two. Unfortunately the client saw B. and has decided it looks more
    "professional" which pains me.

  body: It's not too late to save this. You can achieve the same feel (looseness,
    lightness) without using Rotis (yuck) and without compromising your spacing. Tell
    the client they've selected the direction and that you need one more pass to clean
    it up. Then swap out Rotis for just about anything that is equally light. (Rotis
    is dreadful, esp. Those Cs.) Then fix your line spacing and your word spacing.
    Bam client I'd happy and your integrity intact.

  body: "That's funny. Those C's were killing me too. Unfortunately I wasn't involved
    with the first part of the project, so I couldn't control what went out the door.
    I agree with not sending out the junk.\r\n\r\nI've been able to make minor improvements
    to the spacing issues as well as decreasing the nasty horizontal scaling. The
    client never noticed the changes, so I feel a little better about that.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately
    we're stuck with Rotis though. I was trying to sell Triplex for a few rounds,
    but that was for nothing.\r\n\r\nThanks guys."

    already ugly font had horizontal scaling of 128%.\r\n\r\nIs there anyone who thinks
    this is acceptable?\r\n\r\nMaybe I shouldn't be so irritated."

    or 104% are the acceptable limits to me... 128% is really stretching it! (Sorry
    about the pun, I couldn't help myself.)\r\n\r\nAs for the irritation you feel,
    you have a situation where some decisions were beyond your control (i.e., a previous
    designer who did things differently than you would have). That's certainly annoying,
    but you've done what you could to remedy the situation."

  body: Thanks Ricardo. I decided that whether you scale Rotis 128% or not, it's still
    a rather nasty looking font. So does it really matter? I'm unplugging at this
    point. My last proof went out to the AE with a note... I'll do what ever they'll
    approve.
