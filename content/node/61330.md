  now supports proper mark-to-base and mark-to-mark features -- not limited to TrueType
  'attachment points', it works perfectly with CFF (Type 1s) as well. So I spend the
  weekend updating my accents font, removing all rligs that glued a myriad of specifically
  spaced accents to a few characters and replacing them with a single accent glyph.
  I even could use the free DTL OTMaster Light to proof them! (And I am utterly convinced
  the full version is worth its full price, because with that I could have done the
  positioning straight away!)\r\n\r\nHere's the catch.\r\n\r\nTraditionally, I positioned
  my accent glyphs <em>after</em> its base glyph, then manually kerned it into place.
  The positioned accents I created had, therefore, to be of zero width and <em>on
  the left side</em> of the zero line. After some initial problems, I worked out I
  still could position its anchor points on the base point per accent:\r\n\r\n<code>
  \ markClass [ @ALLTOPMARKS ] &lt;anchor -250 500&gt; @TOP_MARKS;</code>\r\n\r\n--
  the entire accent glyph is centered horizontally inside a 500 unit wide rectangle.
  So all I had to do was for umpteen characters figure out where <em>their</em> (optical)
  center was, and set the position for their anchor:\r\n\r\n<code>  position base
  [ g ] &lt;anchor 240 500&gt; mark @TOP_MARKS\r\n\t\t  &lt;anchor 240 -250&gt; mark
  @BOTTOM_MARKS;</code>\r\n\r\nWorks like a charm in OTMaster. I could even work out
  vertical stacking of the accents (mark-to-mark). Now the strange thing is, when
  testing with InDesign CS4, vertical stacking works as advertised, but the <strong>horizontal
  position</strong> is off by an entire character width. If I type in\r\n\r\nm &lt;acute&gt;\r\n\r\nthe
  acute appears the exact width of the 'm' to the right. I have confirmed this by
  typing in another 'm' right after the acute, and <em>then</em> the accent was placed
  perfectly -- on the next 'm'.\r\n\r\nWhat are the conventions for combining accents?
  Should they have a non-zero width after all? (I think their widths would be discarded
  because they're positioned with the mark-to-base feature.) Should they be zero-width
  and on the <em>right hand side</em> of the null line? (That would imply that, lacking
  mark-to-base, one would type first the accent and then the base glyph -- which is,
  I admit, <em>also</em> a historical convention -- typewriter style.)\r\n\r\nOr is
  OTMaster behaving correctly, and IDCS4 not?"

  body: "Combining mark glyphs should be zero-width. [The exception is in monospaced
    fonts, in which the combining marks must have the same advance width as all the
    other glyphs. In this case, the width is collapsed in the GPOS lookups as part
    of the mark positioning.]\r\n\r\nIt doesn't matter where on the zero-width the
    actual outline is positioned. Typically, the default position is set to offset
    the mark over the preceding letter in cases where GPOS mark attachments are not
    supported. So for left-to-right scripts the outline is offset to the left of the
    zero-width, and for right-to-left scripts it is offset to the right. [The exception
    is Hebrew, in which the marks are typically centered optically on the zero-width,
    which allows them to be used by legacy Hebrew engines that employed algorithmic
    horizontal positioning.]"

    the actual outline is positioned.</cite>\r\n\r\nThat's what I assumed. It seems
    I'm making some mistake elsewhere -- just for laughs I moved the accents to the
    <em>right</em> side of the zero line, and the results are exactly the same in
    OTMaster (correct) and CS4 (wrong).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/more-accents_5051.PNG]\r\n\r\nThe
    acute is right after the 'm' and should be on top -- adding an extra 'm' after
    that shows the position is correct, apart from the minor issue it's too far to
    the right.\r\n\r\nThe mk2base is now in 'rlig', I'll put them somewhere else and
    see what changes."

    you can see, the top (mkmk) accents go wildly out of whack. It doesn't matter
    whether I add a bottom accent or not -- the result is the same.\r\n\r\nI don't
    trust my OTF font making abilities enough, so I did the same using Legendum, with
    this result (CS4):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ie_no_fun_3801.PNG]\r\n\r\nand
    SIL Doulos -- top WordPad, bottom CS4:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hummbug_5249.PNG]\r\n\r\n--
    so it seems <code>mkmk</code> doesn't <em>really</em> work in CS4, while I'm pretty
    sure it was mentioned as a new feature (perhaps even here on Typophile).\r\nI'd
    be gladly proven wrong. Anyone?\r\n\r\n--\r\n[Note] For some reason my custom
    glyph names-per-unicode do not survive the export to PFB/makeOTF trajectory, they
    never make it into the PFB. Custom names are preferred, because it makes writing
    the feature file just that bit easier (using \"macroncomb\" and \"opene\" rather
    than \"uni030F\" and \"uni2011\"). A rather unfortunate side effect is that these
    glyphs don't appear in Wordpad."

  body: "Guys -- thanks for delving a bit deeper into this.\r\n\r\nI don't think there
    is an <em>implementation</em> defined limit to the number of stacked accents;
    I can't remember reading anything about that. Besides, there seems to be no way
    of knowing which 'number' one particular accent has in its stacking order. <code>mkmk</code>
    accents only have positions relative to the preceding one, and the very first
    relative to its parent glyph.\r\n\r\nThat said, I'm also not sure why there would
    be a hard-coded limitation in an OTF drawing routine, it could be written as a
    simple repeating piece of code (at least, that's how I would've done it ;-).\r\n\r\nI
    suspect it's more a bug (or 'feature') in the way type gets blitted; it may be
    to a buffer restricted to the current font height plus ascenders, something like
    that. Do Word, Notepad, and Wordpad all use the same drawing APIs? (And -- again,
    just suspecting -- the answer is likely to be 'yes'.)"
