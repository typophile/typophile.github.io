  body: very nice work, Christos! although it does seem familiar  <BR>in some way,
    I think it will find a place of its own. <BR> <BR>I really like the &#39;O&#39;
    in line D, but I think the splintered  <BR>curves introduce a characteristic not
    present  <BR>elsewhere. I&#39;d go with line A. <BR> <BR>you might also want to
    try incorporating a curve similar  <BR>to the &#39;B&#39;, &#39;R&#39;, and &#39;K&#39;
    into one side or both of the &#39;M&#39;. I&#39;m  <BR>not quite sure how that
    would work, but it&#39;s a thought.

  body: i agree with plain clothes, sport dressing and stuff <BR>i am pro-A, although
    B looks nice too &#40;however it looks smaller than the other caps, so you should
    increase the size by 4%&#40;it&#39;s that theory about circles looking smaller
    to a rectangle, while they both have the same height&#41;&#41; <BR>C is dull and
    D is very nice, but as p&#42;c suggested, it&#39;s another font <BR> <BR>carry
