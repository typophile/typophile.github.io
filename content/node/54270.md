  I need help to do that reliably, so here I am. Below is the list, with what I know
  or think (the latter marked with a question mark) shown. (Note that some of these
  countries have a completely non-Cyrillic primary alphabet, but still use some flavor
  of Cyrillic as a secondary system).\r\n\r\nArmenia: P\r\n\r\nAzerbaijan: E?\r\n\r\nBelorussia:

    collection of links is not bad either. I don\u2019t know how reliable or up-to-date
    all that data is, though. Also, note that that information is on Cyrillic-using
    <em>languages</em>, not countries."

  body: "This depends on what is meant by \"plain Cyrillic\", which is a nebulous
    concept considering the history of the script and various reforms that took place
    for different languages. (Trying to define \"plain Latin\" runs into similar problems,
    believe it or not.)\r\n\r\nFor simplicity's sake I'll consider the letters encoded
    in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8859-5\">ISO 8859-5</a>, which never
    caught on but whose Cyrillic letters form the basic Cyrillic block of Unicode,
    to be \"plain Cyrillic\". Then Bulgarian, Belarusian, and Russian are covered
    by plain Cyrillic.\r\n\r\nHere are the rest, and the letters not supported by
    ISO 8859-5.\r\n\r\nAzerbaijani: \u0493, \u04D9, \u049D, \u04E9, \u04AF, \u04BB,
    \u04B9\r\nKazakh: \u04D9, \u049B, \u0493, \u04B3, \u04E9, \u04B1, \u04BB\r\nKyrgyz:
    \u04A3, \u04E9, \u04AF\r\nMoldovan: \u04C2\r\nTajik: \u0493, \u04E3, \u049B, \u04EF,
    \u04B3, \u04B7\r\nTurkmen: \u04D9, \u0497, \u04A3, \u04E9, \u04AF\r\nUkrainian:
    \u0491\r\nUzbek: \u049B, \u0493, \u04B3\r\n\r\nI haven't been able to find much
    data on Cyrillic as used for Armenian and Georgian.\r\n\r\nCaveats: I've listed
    the above in terms of languages, but of course in reality Russian dominates Belarus
    and some parts of Ukraine, Russia also hosts a lot of minority languages that
    use their own extended versions of Cyrillic, etc. Also, pre-reform Russian or
    Bulgarian had letters that wouldn't be considered \"plain Cyrillic\".\r\n\r\nETA:
    It's interesting how Unicode organizes Cyrillic characters. There is a block called
    \"Basic Russian alphabet\" and another called \"Cyrillic extensions\"; these together
    make up what I've called \"plain Cyrillic\" above. If we restrict ourselves to
    the \"Basic Russian alphabet\", then even Russian has a letter that is not supported,
    \u0451, which, to be fair, can be replaced with \u0435 in most circumstances.
    Belarusian \u045E is also not supported. Bulgarian \u045D, while not considered
    part of the alphabet, is used in the orthography, and also is not supported in
    the \"Basic Russian alphabet\".\r\n"

    take it, that is the character set covered by the \u2018standard\u2019 Cyrillic
    (Windows 1251 / Mac Cyrillic 10007) codepage. It supports the typesetting of many
    Slavic languages: Belarusian, Bulgarian, Macedonian, Russian, Rusyn, Serbian,
    and Ukrainian. Maybe more.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: I usually make a distinction between Slavic Cyrillic ('plain') and non-Slavic
    Cyrillic ('extended'). This seems to work quite nicely because, so far as I recall,
    all the non-Slavic orthographies require at least one letter that is not found
    in any Slavic orthographies. This, in turn, allows you to quickly identify the
    two sets based on linguistic group.

    even if you hide the middle step from the client."
