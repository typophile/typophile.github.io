body: "So I've been commissioned to do an ad for a local restaurant promoting their
  good-old Northern-Irish Sunday Lunch menu - the proprietor wants a quirky message
  which will entice the customer to dine in their place instead of opting to do it
  at home, hence the tagline.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to convey the idea that Sunday is
  indeed a day of rest, and they should let the business do the cooking for them,
  but I'm unsure whether it could be conveyed as blasphemous as it's bastardising
  the Bible.. kinda.\r\n\r\nAnyway I'd like your oppinions - note - this is NOT anywhere
  near the final design, rather just an initial concept.\r\n\r\nhttp://img210.imageshack.us/img210/1773/picture2dh4.png\r\n\r\nRegards,

    the second line down into the space next to it (lower left), perhaps break it
    to 2 lines or make it smaller.\r\n\r\nIf you're worried about Biblical connotations,
    try something like \"You work hard all week -- let us work do the work on Sunday\"\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n\"On
    the seventh day, they rest-auranted\" (ooooh, that hurt as I typed it).\r\n\r\n"

    be offended. If you believe more positive comments will arise in that neighbourhood,
    then take the risk. Personally, I like the message. \r\n\r\nAs for the design,
    there's a bit of spacing and size issues, but I like the color and type choice."

  body: "It's purely conceptual - just something to show how useful the space could
    be to the client if it were utilised well enough. As I'm from Northern Ireland,
    both Protestants & Catholics hold their religion quite dearly, but it's not exactly
    poking fun at scripture, is it? \r\n\r\nI'm honestly at a loss to think of a better
    strapline concerning Sunday lunch - it fits the tone perfectly, and if I can convince
    my bosses (I'm currently on work experience) and both partners of the client business,
    I'll be pleased!\r\n\r\nI appreciate the input, Typophiles, always a pleasure!"

    fontplay material.\r\n\r\nBtw, if there was a reason to be offended, more Christians
    would be better off using the opportunity to dialogue in a brotherly way, than
    getting into a finger-pointing, judgemental mode.\r\n\r\nPersonally about the
    only time I do go out to eat (except for taking customers to lunch) is after church
    on Sunday. My current favorite is Panera. The bread is so good I can't seem to
    wolf my sandwich down fast enough. Actually, it is too good. For at least another
    day I am thinking about how good it was, and am calculating how I can go back
    again.\r\n; )"

    'critique' in the title might help this).\r\n\r\nThe signage design hasn't started,
    nevermind finished - it's purely an idea which I'm considering as I'm unable to
    think of a better strapline.\r\n\r\nThanks for the comments though as always,
    it's definately something I'll be discussing in my <a href=\"http://www.paulwilsdon.com/blog.html\">University
