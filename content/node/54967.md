    those are some wonderfully conceptual forms and you should explore them in your

    go away downtrodden : )\r\nMichael\r\n\r\n"

    Other than the fact that I spell colors ''colours'' it looks cool, if not a tad
    hip. '

  body: "Trendy? Sure. But it's lovely. Trendy isn't always bad...especially for design
    firms, who tend to be trendy and change their logo routinely anyways. \r\n\r\nYea,
    it's hard to read, but seems appropriate given the name. \r\n\r\nonly nit-pick
    is the overlap. Fudge the height of the L so it perfectly meshes with he form
    above it and odesn't leave that hairline or red.\r\n\r\nOr, possibly try it without
    the lower red node of the d. Instead have the l form the lower part of the d.
    Just an idea."

  body: Legibility does become an issue. If the general public is supposed to sort
    this out you will need to hand out decoder rings with the business cards. It's
    an interesting start, keep working at it.

  body: "I like this quite a bit\u2026a tad hard to read but fun. The way the \"l\"
    knocks out the lower-left of the \"d\" works better for me than the first, transparent
    overlay, version\u2026but I miss the colors of the first sample\u2026the grey
    feels cold next to the blue. \r\n\r\nEverything reads good for me except the \"e\".
    It's nice visually, but without the other letters creating the word, I wouldn't
    be able to fill it in\u2026adds to the \"coded\" angle though!"

    it was easy to read (the second version).

    I was able to read it quite easily, but agree that others may not. The only \"trouble\"
    I have with it, is with the 's'. The top-right and bottom-left part seem to break
    your grid."
