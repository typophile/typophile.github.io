body: "We are working on a project in the area of \"Avenue de Champagne\". Currently
  we are scouting for more information about the area and people who have influenced
  the local typography there and in France at the beginning of 20th century. \r\n\r\nHere
  are some examples of the type style we are interested to know more about:\r\nhttp://thingstodo.viator.com/champagne/files/2013/05/Avenue-de-Champagne.jpg\r\nhttp://decantertours.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/champagne-man-in-berret-300x198.jpg\r\nOr
  is this common signage type in some areas of France?\r\n\r\nInsight, books, designers
  and why not even fonts appreciated.\r\n(Reading has provided us with some history
  already but now we are looking for this specific style)\r\n\r\nThank you."
