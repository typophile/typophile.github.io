		<div class="commentbody">The student-teacher relationship is more like the customer-supplier relationship these days.
One's students are one's clients, so they expect value for money.
After all, they're investing in getting a good job, the education is incidental.
Actually, I'm not totally cynical, I think student power is a necessary corrective to unfettered authoritarianism.
It's good to accommodate it within the system, which is more civil than externally through no-holds-barred "rate your prof" web sites.

Having done some teaching at Ontario colleges, I have been asked to distribute student-feedback questionnaires to students (taking up valuable teaching time while they fill them out!) so that they can let the powers that be know whether I'm up to scratch. Of course, with transparency, these are eventually forwarded to me (without student names, although it's pretty easy to figure out who says what). It's somewhat galling at first, but the good thing is when the head of faculty says sure, many of them think typography is the dullest, least creative, most useless part of graphic design, but we know better. And it can give a teacher a good indication of some areas where improvement may be necessary.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I see the loonies are running the asylum over on the other side of the pond these days. LOL I mean...if you are interviewing for a job with 8 year olds. Personally, I'd find that a waste of time more than anything else. Children do not know the appropriate questions to ask of a teacher. What are they going to ask...questions that make sense to them, of coruse. I can see the list:

1) How much homework would you give?
2) How much fun learning will there be, i.e. field trips, etc?

I, honestly, would not have known what questions to ask myself, if I were that age. They are being put in a bad position. Infact, I would say that if they want valuable feedback, don't ask the kids, ask the parents.

I do agree with Nick. I have to fill those questionaires out after every class. Of course, I do mine online. But, I feel, relatively, sure that the teacher can tell who is saying what. I mean, my typography teacher knew me, I'm sure. After all, I had the attitude Nick speaks of, "Dullest, least creative, subject around" going in. However, that all changed first week. Why? Well, my teacher challenged me to do better with every project, think outside the box with every response. </div>
