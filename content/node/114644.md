  body: It looks like <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=Dafont-1&ffam=Edition%20-%20Regular&fid=1f6274d74ff7d80c6719a694b9b7fc28&fsize=60&text=MISSING&fit=1|Edition]]</strong>,
    a strange (free?) font with no licensing info, so better be careful if you want
    to use it in a commercial project.
