  body: "Let\u2019s say it\u2019s thin Helvetica.\r\nThe connectors are probably added
    in Illustrator. \r\nThe w is a upside down m. \r\nThe a is a modified d. \r\nAnd
    g is combined from u and g. \r\nAlso c, e and t are modified.\r\n\r\nWell, maybe
    not Helvetica but close."

  body: "Of course, Avant Garde would be close to this, except for the lowercase \"y\".\r\n\r\nTo
    me it looks that the text was artificially condensed, too."

    be needed. That's my vote too.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"

  body: "If you want the exact same look, you\u2019d have to modify Avant Garde more
    than Helvetica. In my opinion. Avant Garde is too wide, Condensed is too narrow.
    Plus it doesn\u2019t have an equal weight. Helvetica Thin is quite close."
