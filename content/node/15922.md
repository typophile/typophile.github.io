  extract from a textbook I'm currently working on. I'm pretty unsure about the type
  design, in particular the justification of all the copy. The client is adamant that
  he wants justified type because it looks 'neater', but I'm unsure as it's quite
  a type-heavy book. To me the justified type looks a little rigid and uninviting,
  particularly when the book is aimed at the lay-person.\r\n\r\nThe copy is set in
  Syntax 9.5pt/14pt and headings & captions are set in Conduit. Page size is 23.0
  x 28.5 cm. Blank boxes indicated image and diagram placement.\r\n\r\nAny comments
  would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nGeorge"

  body: "TIME TO DECIDE: \r\n\r\nJustifed\u2014tell the client that it looks neater,
    but looks un-human & reads much worse. Your word-spacing is too fluid for this
    sort of thing. At least hyphenate, even liberally. (I don't subscribe to anti-hyphenation,
    I prefer my word spaces to be as even as possible.)\r\n\r\nRagged Right\u2014tell
    the client that this is the preferred option of the discerning professional, like
    yourself, and you wouldn't presume to tell him/her the \"the distance between
    the proposed house and sewer junction\" for his/her house! Or something similar.\r\n\r\nTypeface\u2014sans
    or serif: syntax would be somewhat agreeable for short to medium lengths. Is this
    the sort of thing to be read in one go, or for reference?"

  body: "Thanks for the comments guys. Overall I agree, ragged right is definitely
    the way too go.\r\n\r\nKris, I think it would be used more as a reference. As
    it's for novices I can't image too many people would read this all the way through
    & be able to retain much of the information. Also, with the division of chapters
    the sections of text are generally short to medium length.\r\n\r\nDezcom, any
    thoughts as too how much more I should open up the leading? \r\n\r\n- George"

  body: "The horns of your dilemma \u2013 \r\nJustified \u2013 reference/technical
    manuals often contain long/unusual* terms and hyphenating them will slow reading/comprehension.\r\nRagged
    Right \u2013 for the above reason the ragged right margin might be too ragged
    and will certainly require turnovers and/or takebacks to achieve a good looking
    page.\r\nI think that your measure will accommodate both and as the text is in
    shortish paragraphs I see no reason that you shouldn't use either, that said,
    the bullet points probably should be set ragged right and maybe indented.\r\nI'm
    not sure about using Conduit for the captions and headings in the text, it has
    a soft outline and, in my view, its nature conflicts with Syntax it works fine
    as a headline choice though.\r\n*terms that the reader may not necessarily have
    come across or in this context.\r\nTim"

  body: "I wonder if the bulleted parts can be differentiated from the main body parts
    a touch more. The headlines and display I feel could be more interesting and still
    be taken seriously. Can't wait to see it with imagery. What happens when the contrast
    comes away from the page numbers? Leading variety and lighter typography every
    now and then could be nice.\r\n\r\nLooking good. :)\r\n\r\nShould the first paragraph
    have an indent as well?\r\n"

  body: I might add that the caption could be at a smaller size. Like the line length.
    An easy to read page.
