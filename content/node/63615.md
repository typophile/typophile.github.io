  about.\r\n\r\nIn selecting complimentary sans and serifs (successfully) what, in
  general, are you looking for?\r\n\r\nsame page tone? x-height? and so on?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "A few things to look for are fonts that look similar, fonts that were designed
    by the same designer, or fonts that were designed in the same time period. The
    book *The Elements of Typographic Style* by Robert Bringhurst is a great book
    that has a chapter on choosing and combining type.\r\n\r\nA few good serif and
    sanserif combination's are; Haas Claredon and Helvetica, Memphis and Futura, Berthold
    Bodoni and Futura, Meridien and Frutiger, as well as Syntax and Minion, ."

  body: "Thanks Eric.\r\n\r\nAside from TEoTS, any other required reading on perfecting
    the art?\r\nI've got a copy of it and find it endlessly useful, it'd just be nice
    to have an additional book of knowledge to leech from.\r\n\r\nCheers.\r\n\r\nI've
    recently decided that I have for too long (generally) only focussed on typography
    for logos, which is a totally different matter. Bring on the naivety!\r\n\r\nThanks
    again.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n----------\r\n<strong>Paul Ducco</strong>\r\n<a
