What a waste of creative opportunity. Do they plan to just keep zooming in until it's just a mermaid's nose? I bet there are some very frustrated designers in the wake of this wimpy "change". </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Sometimes you bank on your existing market image and recognizability to create an identity which marks the next leap forward in what will become your function in the coming years. With this, you pull your old image into your new image and gather the waves that you make with you.  I am assuming that Starbucks will soon reorganize into various venture groups--perhaps including, coffee shops, coffee paraphernalia, online music, kitchen utensils, etc..
I think they did a good job and that some form of type will come back after they reinvent themselves.

		<div class="commentbody">Of course, they might even decide that "Starbucks" is a confusing name, which doesn't connect to their trademark, and makes people think of <em>Battlestar Galactica</em>. Plus, people think their trademark is a mermaid, when that isn't <em>quite</em> right.

		<div class="commentbody">I agree with Trevor; the logo loses some charm once it’s stripped down like this. For Starbucks that seems like a pretty big deal because the interior design of almost every Starbucks location has been crafted to emphasize warmth and charm. I suspect that Chris is correct and that this new logo is being implemented as the brand expands to much more than a huge chain of coffee shops, and that dropping the charm is essential outside the context of Starbucks stores.</div>

It's cold and plastic; not inviting and warm at all, which has always been the most appealing part of their brand. Starbucks' signature cozy warmth somewhat blots out the "huge corporation" aspect that so many people shun. This new logo sheds all that appeal.</div>

Do the words "Starbucks Coffee" and a double frame really have that much power? The logo is as “warm and inviting” as it's ever been and we'll all forget this in a few weeks.</div>

<blockquote>
SEATTLE — The Starbucks of the future arrived today.

If Starbucks (SBUX) executives have it figured out right, this could be the prototype for the next generation of stores for one of the world's most influential brands.

A very different kind of Starbucks is on tap. It will serve regional wine and beer. It offers an expansive plate of locally made cheeses — served on china. The barista bar is rebuilt to seat customers up close to the coffee.

Most conspicuously, the place looks less like a Starbucks and more like a cafe that's been part of the neighborhood for years — yet that's "green" in design and decor. This is the calling card of independent java joints that have been eating and sipping away at Starbucks' evening business for decades. U.S. Starbucks stores get 70% of business before 2 p.m.

But the newer one has exactly the same pictorial image as the one before; the only thing removed is the circle with the text. But the pictorial image is now larger, and now the green color that was in the circle is moved to the image.

Even so, it is in a way more "modern", more functional. But I don't think it has those characteristics in a bad way. Yes, any change will always involve some loss, but in branding, change has to happen to keep an identity from becoming dated.</div>

Perhaps in Europe, you are right. In most parts of the USA, there has been a good residual effect.  Starbucks has shown others that they can make a go of it.  Until Starbucks came east, we had almost no decent coffee houses at all.  Now there are several small independent cafes that have opened and been delightful.  One block closer to me than Starbucks is an incredible place called "Natalia's"  They are thriving! Making great pastries and soups!  The lady who runs it is a great baker and business women and she hires very friendly help.

In the context of Starbucks the extra bits do make a difference. They add old-fashioned clutter that’s very at home in the Starbucks stores, which are cluttered with odd furniture, too many hanging lights, an excess of typographically inconsistent signage, seasonal campaign materials, and whatever oddball products and merchandise the chain is trying to sell. But if Starbucks is moving away from that context then the new design could be entirely appropriate.</div>

Yes, you are right.  I would love to do that (and used to in the 60-70s).

In this case, part of their charm is that they are clearly a small family operation with the atmosphere of the welcoming kitchen of some European peasant family.  Everything they make is homemade, handmade, organic, no preservatives, plenty of calories, honest neighborhood stuff.  But the lady is an artist in the kitchen. I wouldn't change a thing in their cafe.  Sure I could make it visually better and give it aires of visual sophistication but I wouldn't want a soul to think this was a chic little trendy place.  This is "Natalia's" own kitchen and everything you get there is damn good without my meddling (besides, the place is full all the time!). :-)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Brands like Starbucks have to understand and nourish their own heritage very carefully or they go wrong. They have a global logo classic, why mess with it? You can hear the marketing people telling them they have to change it if they want to to diversify and 'grow the brand' but in truth they risk cutting themselves off from their own heritage and thus their authenticity, which is the MOST important thing if they don't want to lose their way. It's a misunderstanding of how people percieve branding. No one reads the words every time they look at the logo, they see it as a whole, it simply does not matter if it says 'coffee' but now sells more than that. it's part of their history. It's reassuring.  Real stories about real companies are quirky and not neat. Thus they are human. They should not be ironed flat. They want to avoid corporate blandness but have no idea how to do that or how to cherish their own genuine individuality. The Starbucks cup is the definitive unit of their identity and it doesn't look so good anymore. A bit like a less desirable ripoff. it's a cock-eyed marketing decision, not a design one. They are mad.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">SE, I think you're really right and would add only that, although they may not teach it in business school, a lot of these types of undertakings are the product of executive shoving matches over who's in charge and who's going to have the most visible legacy. Ambition and craft can make for some uncomfortable partnerships, and it's a lucky day when craft prevails. When you see relatively powerful entities tinkering with a successful brand it could be a lot of things — the need to stay fresh, the desire to expand, and so on — but it's also important to remember that for high-ranking people the very act of taking action and of making decisions is the single most important thing. You don't get recognized for doing nothing, and the tinkering is itself a theatrical device, an expression of power, a shaping of reality.

And the existing Starbucks logo has already been through more changes than it really needed, perhaps.

But the current logo is well-loved and well-recognized.

Even so, it is a "busy" logo. It was very unique... precisely because, unlike other brand logos, it looked a bit like something a high school football team would use. "Going Minimal"... is opting for the kind of cool, professional look that most other businesses have also adopted.

Even though the trademark Starbucks image is still unique - and doing without words in a trademark isn't common either.

Instead of being disappointed in this change, my gut reaction is that it's long overdue.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, I stared blankly too when looking up the history of the Starbucks logo. Why would they copy the green circle from an Italian newspaper, or, rather, why would an Italian newspaper in particular be taken as its source? (Later, I found an explanation for that logo with the Mercury head - it being of an espresso coffee chain founded by a former Starbucks manager that was absorbed into Starbucks when it finally relented and decided espresso was a good idea.)

I have one Don Camillo novel I picked up in the (equivalent to a) remainder counter of a used book store. The author complained of the present generation, pursuing "La Dolce Vita", for whom the book was (most emphatically!) not written in a preface.

These are a series of comic novels about a small-town priest and his rivalry with the local Communist agitator. Thus, at one point, Don Camillo finds a statue of an obscure, possibly legendary saint, on the grounds of his church annoying and ugly, so he dumps it in the river one fine night; the Communist catches him at it, and so the next day, he rescues this statue of a saint from the river where, obviously, some terrible vandals had put it, and so he is hailed as a hero for being so generous to his natural opponents, the traditional Catholic Church... and the reader is given to understand, I suppose, that God used him to correct a spiritual problem Don Camillo was suffering from, thus leading this quiet priest further along the truly saintly life.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It’s fascinating to watch the discussion develop, with a lot of comments which, to me, seem very little connected with the logo itself, and very much with the personal attachment to Starbucks as a (series of) physical place(s) or the opinion on a corporation.
I’ve been to Starbucks maybe once in my life (in Kyoto, I think), and my emotional involvement with it is the same I could have with McDonalds. To me, the past and present logo of Starbucks was always bordering the ugly, with some uninspiring typography to say the least. It never said “coffee” (except in the literal sense).
It resembles a zodiacal sign and, at most, all these wavy lines could say “beverage”.
The problem they face, in my opinion, isn’t to reposition themselves beyond coffee, but phase a bad logo away without falling in the Gap trap.
I think Kristin (http://typophile.com/node/77776#comment-446420) nailed it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It isn't a bad logo. Or, perhaps more accurately, it <em>wasn't</em> a bad logo.

Originally, when Starbucks was one cafe in Seattle, a logo that looks like the sign outside, say, an English pub, was entirely appropriate - both to the business, and to the available budget for concerns such as branding.

Over the years, I think they did an excellent job of modifying the logo so as to combine the two conflicting goals of having a brand symbol that has the elegance and stylishness befitting a major corporation - and a symbol with the quaintness and charm associated with a friendly neighborhood business devoted to quality.

While the evolution has been away from (b) and towards (a), they've done an excellent job of keeping as much of (b) as possible while progressing towards (a).

That mermaid with stripes is, in its own way, a great work of art, holding emotions and symbolism in perfect balance. Compared to the Mona Lisa, she's been minimalistic since 1987 and especially 1992, when the secondary circle motif was established.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I read all the arguments in favour of the change, and yet I am still puzzled by what exactly this update is meant to achieve. It changes the aesthetic feel of the logo (and through that of the brand and the company) dramatically. 

Current logo is enclosed, well-rounded and has an unmistakable personality (in part due to an unusual color scheme). It looks like something that you can get in a palm of your hand and it'd be a neat thing to toy with. Like an interesting coin, or a pebble. The rework has none of this. The black is gone, replaced by an over-abundance of rather unpleasant looking green. Gone is the feeling of being well rounded, replaced by a serrated edge. The melusine now <em>is</em> the logo, her weirdness is in your face, not counter-balanced or contained by other parts of the logo.

How hard was it to have both greens and blacks in the new logo? Or better yet - to add a simple stroke around it?

I think that this option was likely considered, but rejected as a half-measure. Furthermore, the new trademark, as is, very strongly suggests a circular shape visually in any event.

Of course, this particular change may not work very well with the crown floating on water version of the trademark used in Sa'udi Arabia: there, they probably should avoid changing the trademark.</div>
