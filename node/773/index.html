<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I am designing a book of which I am also the author, to be published by a commercial house. I am pretty happy with the design, but I am worried about whether the red and black type will balance well. <center><table border=1><tr><td><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_pdf.gif align=left alt=application/pdf>Here <br><a href=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/Sayings_of_the_Sages_Sample-13500.pdf target=_blank><b>Sayings of the Sages Sample.pdf</b></a> (86.9 k)</td></tr></table></center> is a PDF of the design, with the title page and two facing pages - they need to be viewed facing to get the idea of how the design works. <br> <br>I have picked up the dark red of the quote in the side heads. These are a size smaller, bold subhead weight - picking up on an idea of Bringhurst. I think it looks OK on screen; will it balance in print? <br> <br>Suggestions on layout of the title page are also welcome. <br> <br>Thanks to you pros for indulging an amateur on this one.</div>
<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I think it's good. You don't want to overdo it on the red, so what little you have is nice. <br> <br>One thing I would think about however, is are you going to have red all throughout the book? If you can keep it black you can cut down on printing costs. <br> <br>Little thing I noticed, kinda annoying, that "g" in "sayings". I'd replace it with the "g" in "sages". It just looks kinda ugly to me. <br> <br>Otherwise, I like it. I love how you're using fleurons in there as well. You don't see them anymore, and it's nice to every so often.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I think the reds work very well. <br>And your little touches are nice. <br> <br>P1:: <br>I really like the seemingly leaning alignments! <br> <br>"Sayings of the Sages": I think the two "g"s should be the same; the "of the" is too light. <br> <br>I don't like the slanting of "PIRKEI AVOT". <br> <br>Add a bit of spacing betweem "BEHRMAN" and "HOUSE". <br> <br>Some of the cap spacing is off. <br> <br>P2:: <br>The alignments are strange. Which doesn't mean it can't work. But I'd put some space between the English/Hebrew quote and the remaining text body. <br> <br>P3:: <br>I'd indent the quoted material (with the fleuron) visibly more than the paragraph indent of the block text. Does this reverb back to the top quote on P2? <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>How is it I don't see those things? :sigh: <br> <br>I did notice the "pirkei avot" but figured it would look different when it was printed so I didn't say anything. <br> <br>I still like the general look, however. <br> <br>One thing I just thought about for the hebrew quote, could you centre that like you centred the English above it?

<div class=commentbody>You've been very generous with your spacing. How big did you set the type? I think you should narrow down the spacing. And you should have a look at your wordspacing. You have to much big holes. <br> <br>By getting this right, you'll have less pages, less costs and you might even save enough to print in two colours. <br> <br>What software are you using? <br> <br>---Jacques</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Thanks for your ideas. <br> <br>On the two g's in the title: I thought it somehow balanced better, but I guess it is distracting. I was also thinking about shortening the tail on the y for a better fit. <br> <br>Spacing on title page: Thanks Hrant, I will take all of your suggestions. I was worried about the balance of the deliberate assymetry of the title vs the symmetrical page layout. Glad you like it. <br> <br>Spacing of quote P2: I didn't proof it enough. There is an extra word space between 'is' and 'admirable' that I didn't catch. The Poetica is set 17/18. I will try to turn on the 'Optical Spacing' in InDesign (which this is set in), and see if this helps. <br> <br>Spacing of Hebrew. On this page I didn't center it vertically properly - it is too close to the block text. I will fix this. But now I am thinking I should also reduce the leading on the Hebrew. I had it 14pt, like the text. I did the Hebrew very small, to be like a caption to the large English quote, so it wouldn't compete visually. <br> <br>Jacques, the text is set 11/14. Because Minion has a large x-height and is condensed, the current leading looked better to me than tighter. Any other views? <br> <br>The block quote with the fleuron is set in 10/13. I did the indent the same at the paragraph indent for uniformity - I will try indenting it more, but I'm afraid it will be too much variation on a set of pages with a lot going on visually. <br> <br>David, the plan of the book is that, except for introduction and appendices, it is all sets of facing pages like the current p 2-3. The idea is that people sitting around a table can discuss the saying without flipping pages back and forth - everything is there. <br> <br>The text blocks are aligned with the baseline grid, though the discussion guide blocks only have a half space (7 points) between them - which puts alternate blocks back on the grid. I thought the openness of the discussion guide bit bottom right somehow balanced the openness of the English & Hebrew quotes top left. <br> <br>On the red. David, you are the only one so far against the saying being in red. Why do you think it won't work? I am concerned that so much text in red might make it less readable, but on screen it seemes to me to work. I was inspired by some gorgeous books by & about Jan van Krimpen. These were very classical in lay out, with plenty of use of a strong red, and they looked great. Because I am dealing with a classical text, I thought this suited the matter. <br> <br>I'll post more in a few minutes. More comments welcome! <br> <br> </div>

<div class=commentbody>I am concerned about the cost of the red, as it is not a forgone conclusion that the publisher will spring for the extra money. I do think it makes the look distinctive and adds a lot, providing it turns out readable and balanced in print. Also it helps in picking up the quote in the side heads. The text itself is very concisely written, and has a lot of information, so the less intimidating I can make the page the better. <br> <br>From previous experience, I know that many presses can print two colors in one pass, so that black and a spot color is much less expensive than four color process printing. <br> <br>Is the red ink itself expensive? Or is this just a matter of how many signatures it appears in? <br>The whole book will be less than 200 pages. <br> <br>On the single quotes, I'm American but did graduate school in England. The reason I went for the British convention on single quotes first is to save space and get a cleaner page. There are, because of the nature of the project, a lot of references, and I didn't want the page littered with double quotes. <br> <br> <br>On the layout of the quotes in Poetica. For three or at most four lines, I centered everything. For more lines I used different approaches, with almost every quote having a custom layout. I will post another example, if there is continuing discussion. <br> <br>'Fun with fleurons'. Dwiggins I believe went wild with these, especially on title pages, and I've always liked them. I tried to not overdo it. </div>

<div class=commentbody>William --- This wouldn't load on my PC at home last night. But now that I'm on a real machine...*wink*...I can now see it just fine. <br> <br>The red is very beautiful. I personal think you could go a bit more red (less black). On the title page, while I appreciate having the word 'heart' in red, I think it seems a little distracting. Maybe the title is all black and the subtitle is red (would you say the subtitle is almost more important?), and then the sub-subtitle is red also. so the pacing would be black-red-black-red-black? I would stick with one 'g' as well. The line spacing (or lack there of) in title, the way you have it grouped, could you achieve this with the subtitle as well? <br> <br>Cost. Plan your sigs, and then you can have a touch of color in some places. If they have to run your book on a bigger press, color shouldn't double the price, but it will add to it. <br> <br>It might not be appropriate, and I don't know about it, but what if the Hebrew were in red and not the english. Speaking of your second page shown? and if you do have more color maybe your contintue with the mini-sections in the chapter and your dingbats? <br> <br>Just thoughts. <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Tiffany, thanks, I will try your suggestions and variations on them. Because most readers of the book will have little Hebrew, I don't want to emphasize it, with red or size. As it is, it is a reference for those who can understand some of it. <br> <br>Because 80% of the book will be like these facing pages, there is no way I can confine the red to just one or two signatures. I will just have to hope the publisher will spring for it, or do all black. <br> <br>One concern I have is that offset might not have the density of ink as letter press, and might make the red look weak. The great examples of van Krimpen that I saw I think were done on a letter press. Is this a concern, or does offset make no difference on this? <br> <br>Hrant, blackletter I think has Christian or German connotations to American Jews, neither of which is appropriate to this project.It is interesting the Goudy, the most American of type designers, thought blackletter is the most beautiful form. <br> <br>Also I really like Poetica. Of all Bringhurst's stuff, I feel confident that this will definitely last. <br> </div>

<div class=commentbody>Isn't he, for all intents and purposes the graphic director? <br> <br>It is, after all, his own book. He just happens to be going farther than normal authors by doing the layout himself. <br> <br>Since it is his book, he really only has to design it for himself, so doing something for the sake of doing it isn't a problem. Which, if you ask me, it shouldn't be a problem at any time as long as it enhances the design. Audiences don't think deeply about things.</div>

<div class=commentbody>David, as I know a lot more about philosophy than design, I would rather have your design analysis - such as why you think the red is not good - than your philosophy. <br> <br>Philosophically, your segregation of art and design is simplistic, and doesn't hold up to examination. By beautifying an object - a religious object or sacred quotation - you convey the message that it is a treasure. This is a traditional concept in Judaism - called hidur ha-mitzvot - as well as in other religions. Illuminated manuscripts are part of that tradition. In the case of this design, beautification of the sacred texts suits the design purpose. Both Poetica and the red help the design if they succeed in beautifying, even at the cost of making you read the quotation more slowly and repeatedly. Beauty gives the message, 'Turn it and turn it, because all is in it' - the last saying in Pirkei Avot. </div>

<div class=commentbody>>many presses can print two colors in one pass, so that black and a spot color is much less expensive than four color process printing. <br>Is the red ink itself expensive? <br> <br>From my limited experience on presses, this is also a function of the size of the run. Because (depending on the press/printer) you'll have to pay for a "change-over" to ink your spot red on the magenta head. For smaller runs this can sometimes add to the cost and hassle. <br> <br>Typically, red ink is more expensive than black. (A quick search for Van Son Oil Base shows Pantone mixing reds to be about twice as much as black.) There's that, and there's also the mixing fee - some presses charge quite a bit just to mix the spot color you want. <br> <br>But I really do like the red (it's not my money after all ;-) And I agree with Hrant about that block quote (p.3) with the fleuron needing to be indented more. And with M. Le Bailly about the word spacing being too large in spots. Right off hand, the first paragraph under "Discussion Guide" (p.3) seems alternately too loose, then too cramped. <br> <br>Overall I think it's pretty attractive though. And I think this is a nice point: <br> <br>>By beautifying an object - a religious object or sacred quotation - you convey the message that it is a treasure. <br> <br>Cheers, <br> <br>Nathan</div>

<div class=commentbody>>you need to think about your audience, your client. <br> <br>David, I have thought a lot about my audience and I as a designer certainly know the wishes of one of my clients, namely the writer, who is also me. Your new series of excellent questions also presumes that I have not thought about them. I do find your presumption of my thoughtlessness annoying. Generalized questions are of not much help to me; the specific suggestions of other posters have been very helpful, and I appreciate them and will try them out. <br> <br>There will be a second phase of this design, when I again discuss with the publisher - whom I have consulted and who has already specified the general size - the final specifications. The more I know going in, the better case I can make for what I want - the red, sewn signatures, good quality uncoated paper, quality soft binding. <br> <br>I am looking here for ideas to improve the design, and to acquire more knowledge to make my case. The key here to justifying a classic and 'quality' look is that Pirkei Avot is a classic with numerous editions and commentaries.Design is important in re-issuing a classic, even if it has a lot of new material. I'd like to think that my commentary and guide will make it stand out, but I also want the design to make it stand out, so that the quality message of the design will visibly promise the same for the contents. Then the (I hope small) additional production costs will pay off in more sales for the publisher. <br> <br>>the first paragraph under "Discussion Guide" (p.3) seems alternately too loose, then too cramped. <br> <br>Thanks to Jacques and Nathan for pointing this out. I must admit I didn't catch it. I specified the h & j parameters in InDesign following an example in Felici's book 'The Complete Manual of Typography'. His example was also in Minion, but in a narrower column. I will try different settings and see what happens. Will I have to also get in there and adjust paragraphs by hand? <br> <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I've found that InDesign cuts down on a <i>lot</i> of hand tweaking - though not necessarily all of it. Are you using Glyph Scaling in H&Js? In theory I hate it - but if you set it at 98/100/102, it works wonders. You might also tweak the "hyphenation vs. spacing" slider. Generally, setting it on the second or third hash makes for pretty decent spacing results - although at the expense of more hyphens obviously. Hope this helps. <br> <br>Cheers.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks, Nathan! I hadn't used the slider, which is defaulted in the center. When I moved it left to the third mark, as you suggested, it magically cured the uneven spacing in the whole paragraph. I will set the styles for this, or the second mark, after I test it. </div>

<div class=commentbody>David, <br> <br>As I explained to you, I already considered the initial directives of the publisher, and worked for a long time on the design with the audience in mind. When I submit the current design there will be a final round of decisions on binding, paper, etc. I may well have to change some features of the design. And I will shortly be sending the printer a sample for comments. Because I am the author as well as designer, the normal relationship of publisher and designer doesn't apply here. <br> <br>The design I posted was as good an answer as I have to what I know of the publisher's wishes, and I know there will be another round in which I will learn more, but I don't have those answers yet. <br> <br>That is why specifics will help me, and not general questions about what the publisher wants. <br> <br>I did get personal and say your comments were put in an annoying way. That is because I thought they were way out of bounds in their high-handed tone. <br> <br>You can conclude that I am hypersensitive, but if you show your comments to others, I think you will find that my reaction is typical. Chris's comments I think confirm this. <br> <br>As to the tips from the printer on red and black, I have been asking for more information on this from the beginning, and would be happy to hear them. <br> <br> <br> <br> </div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks again to all who have made suggestions. Here <center><table border=1><tr><td><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_pdf.gif align=left alt=application/pdf><br><a href=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/Sayings_of_the_Sages_Sample_rev2-13669.pdf target=_blank><b>Sayings of the Sages Sample rev2.pdf</b></a> (107.4 k)</td></tr></table></center> is a revised version encorporating some of the ideas. <br> <br>TITLE PAGE: <br>To follow Hrant's suggestion to make 'of the' bolder in the title, I used Minion semi-bold with the larger Poetica. The letter forms are very similar, though Poetica is narrower with a smaller x-height. I think it is an improvement, but I'm still not sure if there is a better solution. (The best solution would be to get Bringhurst to do the title in his calligraphy!) <br> <br>In response to Tiffany's suggestions on the use of red, I took away the reddened 'heart' which I concluded is annoying. Reddening the subtitle made it compete with the title too much. I tried Tiffany's idea of adding more red for balance by reddening the fleuron. Do you think it works? <br> <br>I tried to kern the small caps at the bottom, but I'm not sure if I did a very good job. I started with everything tracked at 50 wider, and adjusted from there. Is there a better way to approach kerning caps? <br> <br>FACING PAGES: <br>1. This time I tried the InDesign 'optical' option on automatically kerning the quotation in Poetica, rather than using the 'metric' option, as in the earlier post. I think it is better; any views/experience from others? <br> <br>2. As I wrote above, using the hyphenation slider as Nathan suggested was a great help in fixing the bad spacing pointed out by Jacques. (I also found and eliminated some double spaces left behind from revisions.) On my new pages 4 and 5 you can compare the effects of the slider at 2 (page 4) and at 3 (page 5, as well as 2 & 3). I think maybe 2 is better in spite of the extra hyphens. <br> <br>3. The formatting of the block quotes needed fixing. I have tried several options. Somehow, in trying hundreds of variations on the basic design of the facing pages, I neglected working on the block quotes. I am grateful to Hrant for catching it. <br> <br>I concluded first of all that after the block quote I should probably start the new paragraph flush left. I think this was one of the problems. The option of a further indent is on p. 5. The option of cutting the fleuron is on p. 4. <br> <br>My reasoning behind my currently prefered solution, p. 3 this. The option of the further indent, suggested by Hrant and on p. 5 is best for contrast with the adjacent paragraphs. But in the overall scheme of the facing pages it cuts up the page too much. Already the quotes top left and discussion guide lower right break the grid. So to minimize the break with the grid, on p. 3 I have formatted the block quote 10/14 with no space before and after, and no right indent. There are many other options, but at the moment this is the best I could come up with. What do you think? <br> <br>4. Use of Red. An important feature of the design problem which is not on this set of facing pages is that there are 76 other sets of facing pages, with varying lengths of quotations and discussion guides. On this page, there is no red on the right, which would be good for balance. In some others the side heads do appear on the right. I also did try red fleurons, but it gave the pages measles. In the end I decided that on the facing pages I would only use the red for the main quotation, and the pick up lines of the same quotation in the side heads. Even though it is a bit unbalanced on one set of facing pages, the whole book repeats the pattern, and it provides a strong marker as guide for the reader. <br> <br>To David, sorry for overreacting to what seemed to me high handed remarks. Frankly, I think maybe both of us were suffering from what, following Hrant, we might call 'ASCII-itis'. <br> <br>Here are answers to some of your earlier questions. As far as the binding, most of the publisher's books do, as is typical, have bindings that eat 1/4" from the inner margin of both pages. My layout reflects this. If the publisher's final decision is different, I will change it. <br> <br>My page block is a pica narrower and longer than 6" x 9". (=35 x 55 picas). The text block is little taller than Golden proportions. I am following Bringhurst in the idea that generally the narrower rather than wider proportions give a more classical look, which I what I am trying for here. The deeper text block I think still balances up because of the open space at the top left and bottom right of the facing pages. <br> <br>As to the question of whether this is a text book or monograph or what, I thought a long time about that and decided that it was a guide book -a kind of sui generus as a classic text with commentary and discussion guide. The design has the red as resonance with illuminated text, and the textbook element of discussion guide <br>also. <br> <br>There are many editions in Engligh of Avot with commentaries. The designs vary from ok to awful. You can compare them to this to have a very good idea of the design challenge. <br> <br>As to why van Krimpen used red. The book I saw was a showcase for his Romulus. As it has a classical beauty, he was also showing classical design -very much his taste - in the book, and making the most of the traditionally available and classical look black, red and ivory paper. Dreyfus's book on van Krimpen does the same. <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I'm in class, but a real quick post: have you tried InDesign's Optical Margin Alignment? I mention it because page 4 (where you've set the hyphenation slider on 2) could use it, as could page 5 (at the bottom, the 2 hyphens in a row). Select all your type, in your Type menu choose Story, check the Optical Alignment box, and select your type size. It should overhang your hyphens/quotes/etc so the edge of your copy doesn't have divots in it.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hrant, the Minion Pro (OT) weight for 'of the' I used is semi-bold display. This is the lightest and narrowest of the four semi-bold weights. I tried reducing the size by a point to lighten it after your comment, which I think helped, but aside from that I'd have to get in and start messing with the outlines. <br> <br>On the spacing of the small caps, I started kerning, but I got tired and didn't finish. I found it fun with the title, but with more extended text I get dizzy, and don't feel sure-footed about what to do. I will try the optical spacing, as Chris suggests, then track wider, then kern. Or is there some better way to proceed? <br> <br>Thanks Nathan for the 'how to'; I wanted to try that feature of hanging the dashes out in the margin. I notice both Bringhurst and Felici mention it, but don't do their text that way. What is your experience with it. It sounds like a good idea to me in theory. I guess the issue is dimples vs. whiskers. <br> <br>Though I don't think Felici chose the best typeface/paper combination, the typesetting in his book rests beautifully on the page. I would like to go that direction, but what with the challenge of finishing and then revising the text, whatever I can get the smart programs to do for me I am very happy about. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Berkson, the seocnd version looks very nice (and better in my opinion then the first). <br>Im not so sure the hebrew type (is this Shokan? i hardly see it used) suits the english, its pretty anemic and unlike the english style-wise. Is that intentional? you said that becuase many readers dont know hebrew, you dont want to over-emphasize the hebrew qoutes. Even so, maybe a diffrent font will look better. Perheps one with less contrast, because this font makes the text look funny. I'd suggest Narkisim, it would look fantastic with Minion Italic. Another option is Rolit, which is very calligraphic, and will look nice & gentle on the modern Minion. Im thinking of a font by Yaredna, but i cant remember its name, that would look good too. I can check it out if youre interested. <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Itay, yes the suggestions of the designers here have been extremely helpful. <br> <br>As to the Hebrew typeface, I have never been satisfied with it, and was settling for just being discrete. <br> <br>My problem is that I am using the English/Hebrew program Davkawriter, which has its own coding system and limited typeface options. The face you see is Guttman Hadar. Earlier I used Davka's David, which looks more modern, but was a bit bold relative to the Minion. <br> <br>I would be delighted to get something better, if I can get it into InDesign. In an earlier conversation on using Hebrew fonts, John Hudson recommended using InDesign ME, which I guess will use all the fonts you use in Israel. He said that regular InDesign will not do right-to-left text and nekudot. Davkawriter does have a functionality of pasting Hebrew into English programs, switching the direction and placing nekudot correctly. That is what I am using currently. <br> <br>I don't know whether Dagesh, the other English/Hebrew program used widely here can use the regular Hebrew fonts. If there is another Hebrew font that will work a lot better, I will also check on the cost of upgrade to InDesign ME, now that I have InDesign anyway. <br> <br>In any case, if you can give me URLs to look at the fonts you mention, I would appreciate it. I'd love to consider them. <br> <br>Also if you have info on the problems of compatibility of Hebrew fonts and U.S. programs, that would be great. Nobody has given me an overview of this. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Correction. <br>In talking about the mediocrity of the design of earlier versions of Avot I neglected to mention the 1960 Heritage and Limited Editions Bookclub editions of 'The Living Talmud' by Judah Goldin. <br> <br>In spite of the title, this is an edition of only Pirkei Avot. The editor was a first rate scholar who selected and translated the classical commentaries. It is a wonderful book; all editions, including paperbacks, are out of print. <br> <br>I haven't had the Limited Edition version in my hands. It has illustrations, leather and vellum binding and is signed by the illustrator. I believe it has the Hebrew in red. (The paperback is missing the Hebrew.) I don't know whether the Heritage edition is just different in binding, or size and printing as well from the Limited Edition. I am curious to look at these, but the Limited Edition costs between $100-200 now on the internet, and I have been too cheap to spring for it. </div>

My feeling is that, whenever I'm in a situation where I have a lot of hyphens (to optimize my spacing) and punctuation (it seems that the nature of this text is to have quotation marks), I use optical alignment. I find the dimples less disturbing than the divots. You can also optimize for a smaller type size to overhang less. <br> <br>I lent my Bringhurst (stupid! stupid!), but looking at Felici I think the sidebars may have had some influence on not using optical alignment. IIRC, Bringhurst utilizes the sidebar quite a bit as well. Perhaps overhanging would've made the gutter too raggedy. <br> <br>Two other things: (1) I think that I like the block quote on page 3 also; (2) How much space do you use around your en dashes? My eyes are saying it's too much - maybe try InDesign's thin space?</div>

<div class=commentbody>>I've found that it tends to space way too tight. But I think your second version does actually look better - more even. <br> <br>It looks better to me also. A guess about what may be going on here is that Poetica is not really meant to be used at small sizes, and at the bigger sizes the tighter 'optical' spacing works, but not at smaller sizes. <br> <br>Optical margin alignment. Yes, your explanation that Bringhurst has a lot of material in the margins, so the hypens would interfere, make sense. I will definitely try this, and expect to prefer it. <br> <br>>maybe try InDesign's thin space? <br>I ignorantly assumed that the thin space and word space were the same thing. When I tried the thin space - way better! <br> <br>Your tutorial on InDesign has really improved the text setting enormously. Thanks so much for taking the time to help me out! </div>

<div class=commentbody>Im sorry (for mainly myself) for not knowing enough about the compatibility of hebrew fonts and programs. I'll tell you the little i know - <br>Usauly middle eastern (ME) versions of the popular programs work fine with right-to-left languages. I suppose that once you'll have InDesign ME you'll no longer need the DavkaWriter. Maybe you'll need some kind of hebrew support in the operating system, i'm not sure about that because, well, i sort of take it for granted that hebrew works on my computer, and im not sure why it's like that. I think i remember how the DavkaWriter fonts work - it has fonts with the hebrew set in the english part of the font. Its a very weird program. <br> <br>I read that you get only 10 fonts by Guttman with DavkaWriter. Guttman digitalized some very nice designs, but you'll might wanna check some commercial fonts.. <br>you can get most of the good & famous designs on MasterFont, who pulled the plug on their old website and the new wedsite has been in construction for years. I'm guessing you can't read hebrew, so this is their contact information: <br>Tel: 03-6956311 <br>Fax: 03-6956322 <br>Email: <a href=mailto:sales@masterfont.co.il>sales@masterfont.co.il</a> <br>Address: Igal Alon 159, Tel Aviv 67443, Israel <br> <br>another place to look is FontBit, which have a hebrew-only website(how stupid of them!!!).. <a href=http://www.fontbit.co.il/ target=_blank>http://www.fontbit.co.il/</a> <br>I hope you would find your way to the fonts section in the annoying flash maze. <br> <br>> The face you see is Guttman Hadar. Earlier I used Davka's <br>> David, which looks more modern, but was a bit bold relative <br>> to the Minion. <br>Looks so much like the old Frencheska design 'Shokan'! David [Regular] is good, it didn't look good with it? <br> <br>p.s. why is everybody saying 'nekudot' (=dots)? i think 'nikud' is the right term..? <br> <br>Good Luck. I'll be inquiring about the hebrew support.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks for looking into it Itay. <br> <br>The upgrade to InDesign ME is very expensive (over $600.00 US), so I may just stick with using Davkawriter. I do prefer the look of the David typeface, but I had problems with the weight. Now before I was also dissatisfied with Minion until I switched to the open type version, which I like. So maybe now that I've switched the Minions I'll try David again and see if it works. <br> <br>As I understand from an earlier thread with John Hudson, beginning with Windows 2000 you just need to install the Hebrew keyboard in Windows, and then you can use regular Hebrew fonts in Word - but not so in regular InDesign. For that you need InDesign ME. (Before Windows 2000 I believe you needed the special Hebrew Windows, which you all had in Israel, but not us here in the US - the reason for the creation of Davkawriter.) <br> <br>The Davkawriter pasting from Hebrew to English does work in InDesign. <br> <br>Sorry for mixing up 'nekudot', dots, and 'nikud', voweling or dotting. I think my Hebrew teacher referred to the vowels sometimes this way, or I just mixed it up. My Hebrew exists, but is weak. A fine Israeli scholar, Menachem Fisch, has helped me with the new translation of Avot used in the book.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Chris, I know the most recent versions of Word support Hebrew. And I think John Hudson also mentioned Wordpad as supporting it, as you note. <br> <br>The vowels (used only exceptionally, but I need them for my text) are I believe the reason that old Windows couldn't handle Hebrew natively. The new Windows I believe allows more 'bits' per character. <br> <br>The Word and Wordpad capabilities I don't believe help with InDesign, though. My understanding now is that to get Hebrew into it the only option is the pasting from the special programs, or InDesign-ME.</div>

<div class=commentbody>>Not wordpad, Notepad...the plain text editor if you can believe that! <br> <br>AFAIK, the fact that Notepad supports RTL text and Hebrew (and other non-Latin scripts) has to do with the Uniscribe DLL. Despite the fact that Uniscribe is in 2000 and XP, not every app can use it. I'm sure John Hudson, Hrant, et al are more informed than I... <br> <br>>And did you know, that Arial, Times New Roman, Comic Sans, and several other Windows fonts have Hebrew in them? <br> <br>I don't know about TNR and CS, but MS Arial Unicode is around 25MB - it has glyphs for most codepoints in the Unicode spec. I believe Tahoma is also like this. In a way it's not all that surprising since Microsoft's OpenType strategy seems to be oriented more towards complex script support than Latin typographic niceties. <br> <br>Although I have a feeling (I haven't looked at all & I know nothing about Hebrew) that the Hebrew support in Arial, TNR, etc. doesn't support the typographically complex things like nikuds(?). </div>

<div class=commentbody>Here is a third revision encorporating further suggestions: <br><center><table border=1><tr><td><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/attachment_icon.gif align=left alt=application/octet-stream><br><a href=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/Sayings_of_the_Sages_Sample_rev4-13922.unk target=_blank><b>Sayings of the Sages Sample rev4.indd</b></a> (380.9 k)</td></tr></table></center> <br> <br>Here are the changes: <br> <br>Title page: I used the semibold italic subhead weight of Minion for 'of the' in the title. This seems to balance the best of the options. <br> <br>I reduced the size of the title and took away the bold on the author info; these looked too bold when I printed them out. <br> <br>I tried using the optical spacing and then tracking 50 the small caps at the bottom. Then I just changed the tracking on a couple of them. Do they look even now? <br> <br>p 2. <br>As a test I changed the Hebrew font to David. I like it better as a font and it is, as Itay says, more readable as Hebrew. But it is a little bold to my eye in relation to the Minion. I might try to see if I can get a bargain on InDesign ME, and try other fonts. Short of that, I am inclined to stick with the old font (Hadar) for balance. What do you all think as far a balance? <br> <br>I saw somewhere in looking at Hebrew fonts on an Israeli site one called Poeta. Ok, a little too obvious as a match to Poetica, but it did actually seem to harmonize with Poetica. Do you know what I am refering to Itay? <br> <br>I put the thin space around the dashes on p. 2. Is this better than word spaces? Bringhurst recommends word spaces - I guess to avoid confusion with a hyphen - but I like Nathan's suggestion to use thin spaces instead. What do you all think? <br> <br>p. 3. The 10/14 block quote in the last post looked a little bare to me, so I tightened it to 10/13 (vs the 11/14 of the main text), and added an extra 2 points top and bottom. This puts the next paragraph on the baseline grid. Both Bringhurst and Felici recommend at least a half space above and below block quotes, but to me this flows better, as I have so much other stuff that breaks the grid. <br> <br>Thanks again to all for the help. <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I neglected to mention two other features of the PDF last posted. <br> <br>I put the hypenation slider at 3, rather than two, as I thought the spacing is still ok, and there are significantly fewer broken words. <br> <br>Following Nathan's suggestion, I also did the 'optical' margins, which hang the punctuation out in the margin. This makes less of a difference to my eyes than I thought it would. What do you all think? <br> <br>>I really like that new hebrew font. It's more contrasty than the others. Sets it apart from the Poetica and Minion more I think. <br> <br>I think David is a better font in itself, but the being more set apart from Poetica and Minion is what I don't like. <br> <br>Here is my reasoning, which may be wrong. According to the chief designer at a web firm my son worked at, you shouldn't have more than three basic elements on a screen (= set of facing pages here). Otherwise the reader gets confused. My three elements are: <br>1. the quote in large size Poetica, <br>2. the commentary in Minion, and <br>3. the discussion guide in Minion & Minion italic, with 1/2 line leading between items. <br> <br>To make the Hebrew not a competing item, but clearly subordinate, I set it small as a kind of caption to the large quote in red, and tried to have it harmonize with the text below. <br> <br>About setting the Hebrew centered: I didn't do this because many of the quotes have many lines, both English and Hebrew, and these are not centered in the English, but treated differently. <br> <br>Now that I think of it, I could center the last Hebrew line of the short quotes, which have the English centered. I will work on this and post a sample of the two different models. <br> <br>As Itay understands the Hebrew (as do I), I would be interested in his design views on the font and alignment. Note that I also start the next line with small caps, partly to balance the white space at the left of the last Hebrew line. <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Web design and print design are very different things. In web design, if you want more than the basic fonts that everyone has on their computers, you have to make them into bitmaps; so a lot of people don't do it, which leaves you with like one serif font and a handful of sans serif fonts to play with. <br> <br>In print, however, it's generally not a good idea to mix two serif or two sans serif fonts together unless they really contrast with each other. Since you're using the Poetica and the hebrew in conjunction with each other, you'll want to keep them visually separate, which I think this new font, David?, does quite well. It's less calligraphic than the other you used, and makes a nice companion for the Poetica. <br> <br>If you're worried about it interfering with the Minion, try bringing the margins for the quotes in more than the margins for the body text, also give the body text more space after the quotes, maybe add a line or something to separate them from each other as well. <br> <br>David and Poetica really work well together. And I think that maybe it would be worth even finding a new font for the body text to keep the combination. <br> <br>--- <br> <br>As far as centring the hebrew quotes goes, could you post a page with a larger quote in hebrew? <br> <br>Maybe it's just because it's a short quote that's throwing me off.</div>

<div class=commentbody>>As far as centring the hebrew quotes goes, could you post a page with a larger quote in hebrew? <br> <br>Thanks for sticking with this, Chris. Here it is with the next set of facing pages - a lengthy quote from the same sage: <br> <br><center><table border=1><tr><td><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_pdf.gif align=left alt=application/pdf><br><a href=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/Sayings_of_the_Sages_Sample_rev5-14004.pdf target=_blank><b>Sayings of the Sages Sample rev5.pdf</b></a> (116.0 k)</td></tr></table></center> <br> <br>I agree with you that the screen is a radically diffrent medium for typography. I just thought that the 'rule of three' seemed to apply to print also, as it is more about the psychology of information design than typography. <br> <br>That is why I am keen to keep the Hebrew clearly as a subordinate 'reference' rather than a headline. The lighter Hadar typeface and the normal (right) alignment of the last line seems to do that. <br> <br>If Itay (or David H.) check in, I'd be curious about their views, as they read Hebrew. Hrant, does the title page, revised trying to follow your suggestions, work for you now? <br> <br>Nathan, does the optical margins work for you? Actually, it has really grown on me. The punction hanging in the margin is not so noticable, and it seems to help even out the text. <br> <br>Thanks again to all. I think the design has a polish now that it didn't before! </div>

<div class=commentbody>Hmm...I like with the larger quote how you have it flush left, that really counters with the flush right Hebrew. <br> <br>The smaller quote just still doesn't work for me though. How does the english in the smaller quote look when it's flush left? <br> <br>Also, visually, I'm still liking David as a better compliment for the Poetica. You have three "serifed" fonts working together and it sort of becomes very blended. <br> <br>Also, what I said earlier about adding more space between the quotes and the body text...I think, especially if you're going to have long quotes like the new one that you definitely need to do that. The new quote has some nice space separating it from the body text, but I think it needs a little more. <br> <br>One thing that I'm thinking too, now that I see the new large quote...I'm wondering what it would look like if you made the text smaller, like the size of the body text maybe even smaller, and then putting it in a text box that's only a couple inches wide. Long quotes like that are kind of awkward, especially if you have ones that are even longer. If they're always at the top of the page, they can be a kind of embellishment at the smaller size that isn't as over powering as they would be at the larger size.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I've just got done searching for hebrew fonts, and is it just me or is there a complete dearth of Hebrew faces out there? Maybe I wasn't searching for the right thing or something... <br> <br>However, I have found 3 possible compliments to Poetica. David mentioned two of them, actually, Galed and Meiri, and I also found a face that might be a little too flashy</div>

<div class=commentbody>Wow, David, your 'Barcelona' is lovely - it has both strength and grace, which is what I think letters should have. The long extender on the lamed is actually the same feel as the Poetica - a bit extravagent yet formal. <br> <br>Following your suggestion, I enlarged the Hadar by a point, and do I think it helps - it is more readable without overpowering the Minion. Thanks! I will post it shortly. <br> <br>I don't think STAM will work for me - Davka does have a version of it - as the little crowns are too distracting with everything else going on. <br> <br>Overall, my main concern is just that the 'color' of the Hebrew balance with the Minion, and be clearly subordinate to the Poetica. <br> <br>I find it awfully hard to balance Hebrew and Roman faces; the vertical stress of the Roman always seems to clash with the horizontal stress of the Hebrew. <br> </div>

<div class=commentbody>Here I am posting several alternative alignments of the English and Hebrew quotes. <br><center><table border=1><tr><td><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_pdf.gif align=left alt=application/pdf><br><a href=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/Sayings_of_the_Sages_Sample_rev6-14031.pdf target=_blank><b>Sayings of the Sages Sample rev6.pdf</b></a> (90.6 k)</td></tr></table></center> <br> <br>All have the Hebrew in Hadar a point size larger than before, and have more space around the Hebrew, as recommended by David and Chris respectively. <br> <br>Because my English quote has to start at the top of the page consistently, and the English text stay on the grid, the vertical space around the Hebrew quote was my 'fudge factor'. But I realize from Chris' critique that I can't really push it too tight and look OK. I hope it looks better now. <br> <br>Page 2 has centered English, Right aligned Hebrew. <br>Page 3 has centered English, centered Hebrew. <br>Page 4 has left aligned English, centered on the longest line (recommended by Bringhurst for poetry), and right aligned Hebrew. <br> <br>I am starting to think that page 4, which follows the layout I already have for the long quotes, would be best. It would unite the style of the whole book more also. I do shift the middle line slightly to the right, so the swash capitals visually align. I have to do this kind of adjustment basically in all the quotes. <br> <br>What do you think, should I go with p. 4 as the model? <br> <br>As to the Hebrew, the basic problem is that I am stuck for the moment with the Davka faces (which are not bad, but limited). <br> <br>Chris, to respond to an earlier question of yours, I can't really change the Minion, because no other italic really goes with Poetica. I end up with two italics on the same set of pages, which looked bad when I tried it. On the Hebrew, as I explained I don't really have a lot of flexibility to go with Israeli fonts at the moment because of the cost of InDesign ME. <br> <br>(Incidentally, although I like the award-winning Falafil at Avantype, I really don't like the 'Casablanca.' My eye may be misleading me on this, but it looks to me like it is trying to imitate some other script than Hebrew, like 'chop suey' fonts in English.) <br> </div>

<div class=commentbody>I say go with page 4. It looks the best. I'm liking the extra space after the quotes now, and I might add even a little more, but I think it's really improved now. Much better visually. <br> <br> <br>As far as fonts go, here's an idea...drop both the Minion and the Poetica and go with Brioso Pro. It has a nice italic with swashes and ligatures that can take the place of Poetica and a nice roman for the text. <br> <br><a href=http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/landing/brioso.html target=_blank>http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/landing/brioso.html</a> <br> <br>I know cost is an issue for you and I know the whole family is a little pricey, but if you buy just the ones you need you can save a bit. I think that might really solve some of your font problems.</div>

<div class=commentbody>>does the optical margins work <br> <br>I think the optical alignment is a huge improvement. I think I misspoke myself in a previous post - if you think InDesign is overhanging too much, you can optimize the overhang for a larger typesize. Not a smaller size like I said. Overhanging 10 point type optimized for 30 points looks better to some eyes. <br> <br>>should I go with p. 4 as the model? <br> <br>I think page four is definitely your best bet. The right/left aligned English/Hebrew works really well. And I think Chris is right about the need for some space between those quotes and your body. <br> <br>I don't know the first thing about Hebrew - so I don't have anything worthwhile to say about which Hebrew font to go with - but I don't see a huge typeface conflict on your page. I think Brioso is an attractive face, but I wonder if it's not overly mannered for what you're communicating.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I agree that the left alignment of the short quotes in English is much better, not only in itself, but because it will make the look from page to page more consistent. Now I am asking myself 'What was I thinking?' when I did the centered quote... <br> <br>In order to give more space above and below the Hebrew I have to browbeat the author (me) to cut his precious text. He'll only put up with so much abuse <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0>, but I will make sure it doesn't get as tight as the first example. <br> <br>On the option of Brioso, when it was announced by Veer (here or at Typographica?) I did consider using it. I asked the Veer folks to do a sample of some of my text for me, and they were kind enough to do a PDF. Here it is: <br><center><table border=1><tr><td><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_pdf.gif align=left alt=application/pdf><br><a href=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/Sayings-14044.pdf target=_blank><b>Sayings.pdf</b></a> (41.1 k)</td></tr></table></center> <br>To me it is too calligraphic, or as Nathan put it 'mannered', in text size. At the small size I find Minion a lot more readable. At a larger size and the right project it would be wonderful. <br> <br>On the size of the Poetica, when it is significantly smaller it doesn't have the lusciousness of the large size in red, which I like the look of. The longer quotes don't look so good, but I think making the long quotes smaller size and leaving the short ones big will look odd. And making the short ones small too will detract from the beauty of the book. So the all large size seems to me the best compromise. <br> <br>I don't really have a problem with the Poetica/Minion combination, which I think is very strong. On fonts, my only problem is with the Hebrew, which I haven't found a solution for that I am really happy with. <br> <br>Aside from the Hebrew font question, I feel like all the other issues are now resolved: Title page, alignment of the shorter quotes, size and vertical alignment of the Hebrew, format of block quotes, and optimal setting of the text using InDesign. Thanks again to all! You've helped an amateur typophile bring this design up to a professional level. </div>

<div class=commentbody>> 1. "David" is an "old" typeface. classic ( more <br>> "old" typefaces - Frank, Vilna, Rashi, Meiri, Hadas, <br>> Galed.....). <br>I thought David was designed somewhen after the foundation of Israel. was it just digitalized by Guttman then? <br>By the way, did you know Guttman faked SS documents at the holocast? then when he came to israel he started putting his good handwriting skills into typography. <br> <br>I think Casablanca would be a bad choice. Its does look like a cut&paste font (many hebrew fonts are like that *sigh*). Frankly, I can't figure out why Falafil won, it's not even close to what i'd call a progress in hebrew typography. <br>So far the best hebrew type options in my opinion are David and Narkisim. All the other fonts look acient near Minion. I sketched once a nice slanted version of David, but i didn't finish the font. I guess that would've been extra handy for you now <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0> <br> <br>> As to the Hebrew, the basic problem is that I am stuck <br>> for the moment with the Davka faces (which are not bad, <br>> but limited). <br>Did you check the foundries i wrote about? some fonts are very cheap. <br> <br>here is a sample of Narkisim i composed (in photoshop, thus it is lo-fi)- <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/14048.gif alt="embedded Narkism"> <br> <br>I also havn't decided yet what i think of your hebrew/english alignment dillema. The most common way to solve this is on page 4, in which each language aligns in its right way. Because its the most popular solution it also seems like the most natural thing for me. The diffrence between the remaining options seems like a diffrence of intentions - where both the hebrew and english are centered the feeling is that the are both on the same level of importance. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Itay, I do like Narkisim, and it does look like the best match for my project. <br> <br>'David' I have liked as a font because it looks more contemporary and graceful than what I was used to seeing in prayer books - stuff with a big thick-thin contrast, the counterpart of Bodoni in English, which I also don't like as as text type. I have used 'David' for the first chapter of Avot on my web site: <a href=http://www.mentsh.com target=_blank>www.mentsh.com</a> . <br> <br>Narkism has a little more contrast than David, and seems to be a little softer (though I can't tell because it comes from Photoshop.) The greater contrast I think makes it work better with Minion than David. <br> <br>All that said, my problem with getting it is not the cost of the font, but the cost of upgrading to InDesign ME. This it looks like I would have to do, as we discussed earlier, if I am going outside the Davkawriter fonts I already have. <br> <br>But thanks for the suggestion, I will try somehow to make it happen with narkisim. Is this a font of masterfonts.co.il? Are there several versions of it? </div>

From a "color" standpoint that is - I'm not sure what the other ramifications might be. It seems to hold its place better beneath the larger sized Poetica.

<div class=commentbody>"All that said, my problem with getting it is not the cost of the font, but the cost of upgrading to InDesign ME. This it looks like I would have to do, as we discussed earlier, if I am going outside the Davkawriter fonts I already have. " <br> <br>The Hebrew fonts you already have are Unicode aren't they? So if any other fonts you want to use are also unicode, they should behave the same way in Davkawriter regardless of whether or not they came with it. <br> <br>If you can get by with normal InDesign and Davkawriter, try just buying the font first and see if it works, then think about getting InDesign ME if it doesn't. Then you save a tonne of money.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yes, Nathan and Chris, I agree that Itay made a great pick with Narkisim. (By the way, Itay didn't put in nikud - these are ugly, but I need them for my purposes.) <br> <br>No, I don't think the Davkawriter fonts for the native English programs are unicode. I think they built clever workarounds to make everything work properly in the days when regular windows didn't support Hebrew. <br> <br>Both John Hudson and the reference above say regular InDesign doesn't support right to left, and I believe them. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Regular InDesign doesn't, but Davkawriter compensates for that...I thought that's how you were making your pages? <br> <br>If it works, unless you're going to be doing a lot of Hebrew in the future, save yourself some money and buy InDesign ME later. <br> <br>And you're right that the fonts that come with Davkawriter aren't unicode. I take it for granted so much now that I forgot how you had to do things before. I went to their site, they just map the Hebrew characters to the normal latin ascii positions, so the fonts will work in any programme. (When I was looking for fonts earlier, the ones that said anything at all said they were unicode, so I was confused.)</div>

<div class=commentbody>Davkawriter compensates, but only by a system that is incompatible with regular Hebrew fonts, if I understand it rightly. So I can't buy a regular Hebrew font and stick it into Davka writer, and have it paste correctly into a native English program. </div>

<div class=commentbody>David, thanks for your idea on the title page. Tiffany early on in this thread also suggested a black-red-black pattern with the title black and the subitle red. I thought this gave too much emphasis to the subtitle. <br> <br>Your suggestion would get around the need to redden the subtitle, and in theory should be good. But when I tried it, I couldn't get it to work. As the others on this thread also seem to think the current layout is good, I will probably stick with it. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Nathan - you presume correctly, the sample I posted is <b>awful</b>. I just wanted to give you guys a look at how great that font is. I composed it from a snapshot I took of the text in msWord (thats why i didn't add the nikud- it takes hours to add nikud). then i resized it to fit into the right space. Narkisim looks way better in print then it does in the sample. It's slightly lighter and with nicer curves.. <br> <br>Its true, Chris - thats exactly how they're built. I once saw the insides of one. <br>William -- maybe you could buy Narkisim (or any other font you'll find suitable) and then, in a font editing program, put it into the format of DavkaWriter's fonts? There's gotta be a way for you to save on either the font or the program. This is ridiculous. <br>I wish everything would have built-in right to left support allready. This issue is a constant pain in the behind. <br> <br>Is the heavy nikud nessacery, William? you said that most readers won't read the hebrew in the book, and you think the nikud makes the text heavy and annoying to read. I hardly encounter hebrew with nikud and when I do iI usauly ignore the nikud. Thats more or less the norm in israel, is it like this there too? <br>Maybe you need 'selective nikud'? <br>just thinking. <br>By the way, i don't don't like nikud, i think its causes problems, but i can't not love it.. as part of hebrew <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0> <br> <br>I'm glad you liked Narkisim, I do too. It comes in two wieghts, I think (normal & bold). You can buy it from MasterFont. Ask them to send you a PDF catalogue in email. It would be very useful to you.</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>On the nikud, Hrant has it right. The vowelling is basically for learners. Hebrew is normally written without vowels. In Israel the nikud are basically only used for dictionaries and beginning readers. Also having nikud are the prayer book and editions of Torah for study (not the actual Torah scroll, which is calligraphy without nikud). This is so Jews who don't know Hebrew well can phonetically read the prayers and Torah - even without understanding. <br> <br>There will be a great variation in the Hebrew of my readers. If there is an English speaking Jewish discussion group, the group leader may understand the text fully or partially, and others less to varying degrees. Most are likely to be helped by the nikud, so nikud is (are?) really essential. Christian readers will not generally be able to read the Hebrew at all, though a few clergy do have some Hebrew and probably will be helped by nikud. I do hope, perhaps unrealistically, there will be many Christian readers, as the immediate basis of Jesus' ethics was the ethics of Hillel in Pirkei Avot, and not the "Old Testament." <br> <br>As for doing nikud 'lightly', just to remove ambiguities, this only works for those who really know Hebrew well - Israelis like Itay and David. For those of us who are bumbling and stumbling in Hebrew, we need all the help we can get. <br> <br>Incidentally, text of Pirkei Avot was traditionally printed in full in the Prayer Book, with nikud. Thus, lucky for me, you can get the text vowelled on CD ROMs. Putting in nikud is a nightmare. <br> <br>>I wish everything would have built-in right to left support allready. This issue is a constant pain in the behind. <br> <br>Amen!</div>

<div class=commentbody>Definately get Narkisim, even if you have to do what Itay said and remap it to match the fonts from Davkawriter. <br> <br>Is Narkisim still a commercial font? I know Itay says it's being sold by masterfont (went to their page and it's not working), but I did some searching and found all references to it being made by a company in like 93, and all "corporate" web links I found are dead. It's available for download at several places on the web.</div>

<div class=commentbody>> According to what I understand from John Hudson, this will not work, as regular InDesign stores everything in logical, not visual order, and only goes left to right. I discovered that I already had Narkisim installed on my system - I think it was one of the free downloads you can get to view Israeli sites. When I tried to use it in Word, it didn't register, though. I don't know what is happening. I will install the Hebrew keyboard and see what is up, but right now I probably can't get back to this for another two weeks. As Narkisim really seems to be the right typeface for my project, I will try to find a way to get it in. <br> <br>By the way, Itay, what does 'Narkisim' mean? When I looked it up it seems to be the plural of Narcissis, the flower. Is this correct? </div>

<div class=commentbody>Narkisim is probably tangled in a mess of copyrights. It comes with Office ME, but its also sold through Masterfont. Maybe the use of the copy of Narkisim which comes with Office is not for use outside the Office programs? or maybe the font comes with the OS? i dont know. It's another matter I'll have to ask an expert about. It's a good question Chris. <br> <br>William - Tzvi Narkiss, the designer of Narkiss Tam, Narkisim, Narkis Classic and many other popular hebrew fonts is somewhat of a narcissist. He named all his fonts after himself, even though then differ in style alot. Narkisim is the plural of Narkis, which means the flower Narcissus. <br>But it's just a slightly poetic variation of his last name. He probably ran out of ideas - Narkisim could have been named Narkis Classic, if he didn't already have a font that went by that name. <br>William, check out Narkis Classic, maybe you'll find it more suitable for your book. Now that im begining to think about it, it might be so.. <br> <br>Another fun fact (i can't belive the last one about Guttman didn't excite anyone but me)-- Narkis Block changes boumas from on wieght to another. It's the only font i've seen that like that. Are there other fonts with a diffrent skeletons to every wieght? <br> <br>By the way, the delay of my response is due to my lack of [free] free time. I am now in vication in the big apple. I &lt;heart> NY.</div>
