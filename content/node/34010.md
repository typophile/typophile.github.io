body: "I'm working on a redesign of a website for a College of Fine Arts.  I've got
  a fair amount of flexibility creatively, but I'm trying to remain true to the established
  ID system, as well as give a bit of a nod back to the design I'm replacing.\r\n\r\nNow,
  one of the things I'm keeping from the previous design is <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ascender/trebuchet/regular/\">Trebuchet</a>,
  which I'm using for the copy (it's currently also used for headlines, and just about
  everything save for the Logo type - that's done in <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/friz-quadrata/friz-quadrata/index.html\">Friz
  Quadrata</a>).  I would like to find a good headline font, and my options are pretty
  open - I intend to use font replacement to combat the more restrictive choices I
  face if I rely solely on browser-friendly fonts (currently, I'm looking at <a href=\"http://www.mikeindustries.com/sifr/\">sIFR</a>).
  \ Of course, if I don't have to, I would rather use something more universal.  The
  big rub of all this, of course, is that these headlines need to be dynamic, so creating
  a static image for each headline is not a solution.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to maintain
  a more modern feel, and to keep the design clean.  I've been placing <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/news-gothic/bold/\">News
  Gothic (bold)</a> as my headlines, and I like the way it feels, but my fear is that
  the difference between the two fonts - Trebuchet and News Gothic - is not different
  enough, and/or that either of them don't sit nicely with Friz Quadrata.  Any suggestions?\r\n\r\nSample
  from one of the sites (includes all in their respective uses):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/panpainter_trebuchet_4360.jpg]"

  body: I think you're going backwards with the design process here. Rather than try
    to match the site's identity to the web font, I'd finish the design and then set
    the text in a web font that fits. In this case, I think Georgia, Gill Sans, Verdana,
    or Tahoma would be better suited to  News Gothic. Not to mention they are more
    readable typefaces than Trebuchet.

    relates to the logo, specify Candara, Lucida Grande, Gill Sans and Verdana in
    that order. Use that same font everywhere. '

    sure to do my homework there.\r\n\r\nAnd thanks also for the quick responses -
    I'll definitely look to ditch Trebuchet, and start experimenting with your suggestions."

  body: I disagree; I'm actually quite surprised by how well Trebuchet and Friz Quadrata
    seem to go together. But don't add a third font because it won't fit no matter
    what it is.

  body: "(Just as follow up, and to close this out... )\r\n\r\nThanks everyone for
    being kind to a new-poster.  What I ended up doing was leaving Trebuchet out of
    the equation entirely, and instead I'm using a Helvetica/Verdana pairing; Verdana's
    too wide for the headlines, but it works better for the body copy.  Trebuchet
    just didn't reduce as well as I'd like, and I moved away from News Gothic in favor
    of something more standardized.  \r\n\r\nMost of the faces suggested just didn't
    feel... right, although I've got some ideas for future projects now.  Again, thanks
    for the assistance."

  body: "\"as many foundries do not allow embedding on the web.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps this
    is a goofy and innaccurate term the foundries have coined, but there is no such
    thing as 'web embedding' these days. I've seen this term pop-up in here a few
    times.\r\n\r\nAt one point in time, you could embed the font in your HTML page
    and it'd get downloaded by the browser. NN4 and an early version of IE supported
    this). But browsers no longer support this.\r\n\r\nNowadays, you can embed fonts
    in a PDF or in a SWF file. These aren't inheritently 'web' based, though they
    certainly can be.\r\n\r\nYou can just convert your type to outlines as well, though
    that defeats the purpose of it being text and accessible online.\r\n\r\nIn the
    end, if you REALLY want a custom font, just make it an image. That gets around
    any silly licensing and if implemented correctly, can still be very accessible
    (within reason).\r\n\r\n"

  body: "\"for better or worse\"\r\n\r\nSo, is it a term the foundries have coined?
    It seems very odd. As it seems completely arbitrary as to whether or not the application
    I'm embedding it into is on the web or not. If I sent it via email, is that OK?
    Or on a CD?"

  body: "Adobe defines embedding this way: \r\n<cite>Font embedding is a process by
    which fonts used in the creation of a given document, are incorporated within,
    and travel with, the document. When a document with an embedded font is viewed,
    the viewer sees the document exactly as the creator intended the document to be
    seen. The formatting and stylized design of the document are retained. (<a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/antipiracy/ff_faq.html#section-2\">Adobe
    Anti-Piracy Initiative: Font FAQ</a>)</cite>\r\n\r\nAs far as usage ... -\r\n<cite>14.7.5
    You may embed copies of the font software into your electronic documents for the
    purpose of printing and viewing the document. If the font software you are embedding
    is identified as \"licensed for editable embedding\" on Adobe\u2019s website at
    http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/legal/embeddingeula.html, you may also embed
    copies of that font software for the additional purpose of editing your electronic
    documents. No other embedding rights are implied or permitted under this license.
    (<a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/legal/pdfs/EULA5seat_USEnglish02.03.04.html\">Software
    License Agreement</a>)</cite>\r\n\r\nGranted, that doesn't mean that it's a universally
    agreed upon definition, and really doesn't apply to the web - though  the method
    I was talking (sIFR) about <em>does</em> fall under this definition, but I did
    leave out a crucial tid-bit of information - sIFR is set up in such a manner that
    the font usage is restricted to a domain, thus preventing said piracy.  Also,
    most of what I'm reading pertains more to print than it does to the web.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    it does seem a tad vague and subject to situational judgment.  "

  body: "Perhaps they fear having to identify every form of embedding. This could
    also be the reason some foundries keep it simple and don't allow embedding at
    all or they only list PDF embedding. \r\n\r\nIn the end I've found that many foundries
    have a basic license which either allows for most reasonable things and don't
    want to be bothered with random questions ... OR ... their basic license only
    allows for a few things and they do want you to call them and open up dialogue
    with them. This is over-simplifying, of course, because their are also those foundries
    who offer extended licenses online.\r\n\r\n"

    now .. maybe in a few years that'll be a good option - Rather than placing News
    Gothic headline images, maybe you just need to use generously-spaced all-caps
