  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I know there's a few people on here that hail from Ontario; I, myself am currently in Sudbury (please keep laughter to a minimum ). Moved here from NB for my wife's schooling but are now considering the possibility of relocating to a different city, one that offers better employment opportunities in the industry. 

I do mainly focus on print design, but some web layout architecture as well. Currently working as the sole designer/artistic director for a small company up here and am wondering what the prospects are like in places like Ottawa (the first choice), Toronto, or several of the other southern cities.

Any links, recommendations, etc… you might know of would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks

According to the DIAC Design industry study, two thirds of all designers in Ontario reside in Toronto. I think that says something. Toronto is also the largest design centre in Canada and the third largest in North America (after NY and Boston).

Being born and raised in Ottawa, I can't imagine there being much in the way of exciting design happening there - unless you fancy working for the government.

As Luke mentioned, there isn't much outside of Toronto: we've been looking at moving east to be closer to my in-laws, who are in London.

(That being said, there ain't much here in Calgary, where "design" and "art" aren't considered "legitimate" occupations....)

		<div class="commentbody">If you're job searching, there's nothing quite as usefull as networking. Typophile is a great networking tool in that you get to know folks in the type industry. In fact, that's how I found my job at P22, but as far as i know we're not currently hiring.
The fact that this topic came up today is kind of interesting because today i just got an email from someone i met at [[TypeCon]] to join their linkedin network (www.linkedin.com). I was surprised at how many type people i know or know of are on that site. You may do well to use that site as a networking tool and start making connections and sending out feelers there as it is more dedicated to networking with people of all different occupations. In any case, i think it may be worth your effort. I hope this helps.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I am a graphic designer and type teacher living in Ottawa and have lived here for about 15 years now. It's a small town and most of our graphic design graduates do find work in and around Ottawa. With several schools churning out grads each year and an established graphic design community, there isn't too much new work. Still, everyone I know is working and I still get the occasional freelance contract so I think that if you are resourceful, you'll always find work. Ottawa certainly is a nice place to live, especially if you're outdoorsy.</div>

Though I have to say, Canada seems to 'get' the value of graphic design in government moreso than down here in the US. From their postal service to their .gov web sites they seem to appreciate some thought put into graphic design.</div>

In general, I'd have to agree with you: I've worked in Ottawa and Washington and done a lot of government work on both sides of the border.

That being said, why is the official Government of Canada logo in Times Roman?  aaaarrrrgggghhhhh (getting an early start on Talk like a Pirate Day!)

		<div class="commentbody">I work in printing in Ottawa. I see plenty of top quality design stuff going by from the local design firms. Banfield-Seguin does work for Nokia. Hewson Bridge Smith is another biggie doing international stuff. There are quite a few others, because there is so much high tech and government work in the city.

I was born and grew up in Toronto, and I would never want to live there again. Too polluted, a giant rat race, getting increasingly more violent all the time. It's like a big US city now.

Ottawa has most of the same entertainments and things to do as Toronto, and within a few minutes you are out in the country if that's what you like.

Thanks Tim for the added info on Ottawa. In the coming weeks I'm sure I'll be looking into a more comprehensive list of companies and whatnot. </div>
