  identity jobs, and one of them was the creation of this logo. Apparently the font
  is Evangelic, but I can not find it online for purchase and the company who designed
  the logo conveniently \"can't ID the font\" as it has been \"lost\". \r\n\r\nThe
  \"a\" has been filled in, but i'm not sure if any of the serifs are true to the
  original font or if they have also been customised.\r\n\r\nMany thanks!\r\nNatalie."

    pieces of information made me a little suspect!
