  (It is now known as Linotext also.) Benton also made a later Blackletter typeface
  said to be an improvement on his Wedding text called \"Engravers Old English\".
  There is disagreement on when Engravers Old English was made, Wikipedia says 1906,
  other web sites claim 1907. I found a photograph of a church bulletin though that
  is dated 1903 on the back of the bulletin, that has Engravers Old English type on
  the cover. Attached here is the modern computer version of Engravers Old English
  with a part of the actual photograph right below that of the 1903 church bulletin.
  One can see they are exactly the same. So we have pretty much proof that the typeface
  goes back to at least 1903.\r\n(The 1903 church bulletin picture is from this eBay
  item....\r\nhttp://www.ebay.com/itm/1903-1905-First-Congregational-Church-Bulletins-Bellevue-Ohio-/380427266794?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item58933b6aea#ht_1086wt_936\r\n\r\nPS...Just
  found a web page that says Benton's \"Engravers Old English\" dates back to 1902....Web
  site is at....\r\nhttp://www.searchfreefonts.com/font/fmp-engravers-old-english-font.htm"

  body: Release dates as we know them do not apply to cast metal type. When ATF and
    oter folks put out a new specimen book, anything created since the previous one
    would have the same release date, i.e., the copyright date of the specimen book
    itself.

  body: "The notion of publishing\u2014i.e. making a typeface available to the public\u2014is
    helpful.\r\n\r\nThat should be quali\uFB01ed as \u201Cavailable to see\u201D rather
    than \u201Cavailable to purchase and use\u201D, to account for proprietary usage.\r\n\r\nIn
    that sense, a proprietary typeface would be published by the foundry\u2019s client,
    whereas a font for sale would be published by the foundry.\r\n\r\nOne can distinguish
    between a typeface design and a font in this manner; for instance the Wim Crouwel
    type designs that were published in the 1960s were not released as fonts until
    the digital era."

    "y".
