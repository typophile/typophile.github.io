  and eating typographic foods. So far, we plan on making alphabet soup with alphabet
  crackers, followed by alphabet cookies.\r\n\r\nThere is [[http://typolade.de/| chocolate
  type]], but I don't think we have the time or funds for that unless we cast it ourselves.\r\n\r\nTypographic
  fluids will be one issue. The only solution I can find is [[http://www.google.com/products?q=letter+ice+tray&oe=utf-8&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a&um=1&ie=UTF-8&ei=68rQSceBGurplQeXg4zyCQ&sa=X&oi=product_result_group&resnum=1&ct=title
  |ice]].\r\n\r\nI'd love to see what other typographic foods are available."
