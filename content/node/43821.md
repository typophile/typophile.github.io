  body: "After looking through veer, house, 16 pages of myfonts, nothing came closer
    than Stephen's FF Tartine. The opentype accounts for the variance in the r. But
    like any good logo, it has probably been altered by hand, or maybe borrowing the
    lc l and i (see the tittle) from monotype script std:\r\nhttp://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=ADT0004497\r\n"
