    theme of celebrity soul-searching turns me right off.

    this advice for people torn between ATypI and AIGA: <BR> <BR>If you are interested
    specifically in type and want to learn stuff, go to ATypI. <BR> <BR>If you are
    interested in general graphic design and want to look at stuff &#40;designer show
    and tell, was the phrase Matt used&#41;, go to the AIGA. <BR> <BR>If you&#39;re
    not torn, come to both <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    not to end up in the same city as the AIGA.'

  body: I&#39;m following Nick&#39;s lead and going to ATypI rather than AIGA. &#40;This
    will be my first ATypI since 1994 in San Francisco - I still recall being momentarily
    stunned after absent-mindedly wandering through a billowing plume of Neville Brody&#39;s
    cigarette smoke...&#41; <BR> <BR>However, I do believe that <a href="http://www.veer.com/">Veer</a>
    will be sending at least of couple of our designer-types to the annual AIGA square-dance.

  body: <i>I don&#39;t get it - are you back on the Board?</i> <BR> <BR>No, this was
    decided months ago, when we realised that AIGA would be comming to Vancouver one
    month after ATypI. In future, this kind of situation will be avoided if at all
    possible.
