  t-shirt design over at bustedtees.com and quite like the font used for the \"make
  it rain\" - now if i could only find it somewhere.. or something similar, at least.
  But i don't even know where to start looking.\r\nAny help would be appreciated.
  :)"

  body: "\"Sans\" is a shorter way of saying Sans Serif, which describes typefaces
    that are usually drawn in lines without any 'flags' or 'feet' (serifs) on them.
    Arial is a sans serif font; Times New Roman is a serif font.\r\n\r\n'informal'
    was just a way to say that the letters looked like they were drawn without much
    precision, as if they were done in a hurry.\r\n\r\nWelcome to Typophile, by the
    way.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
