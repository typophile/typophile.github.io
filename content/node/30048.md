  of the book). The authors'' own press (Libanus Press) is the imprint. It appears
  to be a phenomenally complete manual on book typography. 448 pages, 1000 illustrations
  of concepts and principles, thorough coverage of all topics related to book design
  including image/text layout, type selection, variables in type specification, and
  much more. I admit I am very intrigued by this brochure. Has anyone seen the book
  firsthand? '

  body: "I picked up a copy directly from the publisher about 9 months ago and must
    admit it's a bit of an indulgence; there was something about the girth of the
    thing and the high production values that appealed to my vanity. The book really
    is nicely put together, and what it does it does very well; that is, it is ultimately
    pragmatic in its approach.\r\n\r\nThe \"problem\" is that if one has studied one's
    Bringhurst, with additional readings from, say, Dowdings' <em>Finer Points...</em>
    and Tschichold's <em>The Art of the Book,</em> with, say, a few dashes of Felici's
    <em>Complete Manual of Typography,</em> (and every self-respecting book typographer
    should be reading these texts) then, really, <em>Book Typography</em> won't be
    as full of useful info as it might be to someone coming in blank.\r\n\r\nThat
    said, the book has dedicated chapters on topics not touched by any of the above-mentioned
    books: basic halftone & 4-colour pre-press, technical details on setting up &
    designing soft-bound covers & dust jackets, etc. (see below for the TOC). The
    book also focuses more on the fine details of HOW to accomplish certain typographic
    principles. Thus, where Bringhurst is perhaps heavier on the theory side, this
    text is very focused on the practical application; not exactly an application-specific
    manual, but a fairly clear book typographer's handbook.\r\n\r\nOne small bug for
    North American readers is that the (format) dimensions tend to be in metric, rather
    than imperial (and this coming from a Canadian!); typographic dimensions are,
    for the most part, in points and picas, but dimensions relating to book/page/sheet
    size are all metric and/or European (that is, A2, A3, A4 rather than tabloid,
    legal, letter, etc.).\r\n\r\nAs I started, the book really is an indulgence, as
    much (I'm guessing) for the authors in producing the book as it is to own. It's
    lush, beautiful and well built, and it looks good on the shelf. However, when
    I'm looking to confirm a principle, it's still Bringhurst that I reach for."

    to say about drop caps in the forthcoming Oak Knoll title Book Typography: A Designer\u2019s
    Manual? My head of department just forwarded me the info on it. Judging by the
    contents listing, Mitchell and Wightman give the topic about four pages.</em>\r\n\r\nbut
    I still haven't seen the book itself... you could say that their prospectus is
    doing exactly what it it's intended to do; whip up a storm of pre-sales anticipation!\r\n\r\nThe
    book itself is at \r\n\r\nhttp://www.oakknoll.com/detail.php?d_booknr=92771\r\n\r\nalthough
    I no longer see the downloadable .pdf prospectus there.\r\n\r\nJason's comment
    about it being more useful to a complete beginner is probably right on the money.
    Me, I have no problem with metric page dimensions, so it's good to know that much
    in advance. I guess I would want to see how it compares against Jost Hochuli &
    Robin Kinross's <a href=\"http://www.hyphenpress.co.uk/titles/designing_books/index.html\">Designing
    books: practice and theory</a>, or even Ari Rafaeli's <a href=\"http://www.oakknoll.com/detail.php?d_booknr=79445\">Book
    Typography</a>, also at Oak Knoll."

    titles, the Mitchell and Wightman becomes even more unnecessary. Which isn't to
    say that it isn't a worthy acquisition.\r\n\r\nHere are scans of the TOC:\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BT_TOC1_4683.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BT_TOC2_5885.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BT_TOC3_4927.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BT_TOC4_6659.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BT_TOC5_5483.gif]"

    this, I'd say it's pretty reasonably priced.

    is an integration into the discussion of book design of the nuts and bolts of
    bookmaking, like getting files and images ready for press, different kinds of
    bindings and covers, the economics of printing and how that affects book design,
    etc. (parts 11, 12, 14, 15, and 16).\r\n\r\nI don't remember seeing those things
    discussed in Felici, Bringhurst, Hochuli, or Tschichold, and a look at Hendel
    and Dowding's TOCs tells me they don't address those things in any systematic
    way, either. Am I missing something? Speaking as an autodidact in the world of
    book design, this seems like a superb book to have on the shelf."

  body: "OK Linda, yours for a pint or three whenever! \r\n\r\nMaurice makes a good
    point about the relevance and orderliness of what's integral to the book; although
    I'm delighted to see the (often overlooked) content of Part 16, it occurs to me
    that one could easily spend more than five pages talking about paper & press in
    this context in the preceeding Part 15.\r\n\r\nJason, (not a qualitative question
    I grant you) how many words are they putting on the average page here?\r\n\r\nSeriously
    folks, shipping is shipping; to blame the publisher for how expensive it is to
    get the goods to your door is to confuse the issue. What's to stop any of you
    ordering from Oak Knoll? Or did you want it discounted from amazon.com to begin
    with? If I placed an order tomorrow, I would do so knowing the air freight from
    the UK to NZ would be prohibitive. I hope this wouldn't interfere with my ability
    to evaluate the worth of the book itself."

  body: "As I think I've stressed above, the book is very well produced: the content
    is comprehensive, the writing clear and practical, the pages well illustrated
    & nicely composed, the book finely designed & beautifully printed. Perhaps it's
    notable that I ordered my copy only after seeing a copy first-hand, perhaps not.
    I certainly don't think this is simply a matter of being lazy or cheap. It's just
    that as folks invested & in love with typography & book design I assume that many
    of us have read extensively on the topic, have gathered a handsome collection
    of books on the topic along side a stack of others hoarded from the library. The
    result of this, at least on my part, is a certain disappointment when I shell
    out a good sum of money for the latest publication only to find that there isn't
    much in it I wasn't already familiar with. This isn't a complaint about the book,
    or any book, but about the fact that inevitably books on any given topic become
    repetitive and, at least to some extent, redundant.\r\n\r\nThere is also the position
    which places a certain emphasis on \"buying locally.\" This is a somewhat pointless
    argument in the age of Amazon, and in fact the opposite argument is likely more
    appropriate: that buying directly from Libanus (as I did) is the only way to get
    the money to the individual publisher. However, if the information found in a
    book produced in England can also be found in a book produced in Vancouver...\r\n\r\n"

    those of us with groaning bookshelves, it's hard to justify buying yet another
    book, particularly sight-unseen, that covers already tilled ground.  \r\n\r\nBut
    if I was just starting out, it certainly covers a lot of ground in one book.\r\n\r\n(Ben,
