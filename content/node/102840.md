  body: whatever image or pattern they used to texturize, it's the same in the R of
    Couture as in the N for Punk. flip it over and the details are the same. find
    a textured photo and place it in your outlines.

  body: btw, there are fonts like Crackvetica that provide a similar feel, but they
    lack the unique/custom look.
