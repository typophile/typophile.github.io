body: 'I&#39;m working on spacing my Century Catalogue &#40;inspired in part by the
  recent digraph discussion&#41;, and have again come up against a fundamental question
  that&#39;s been bothering me for a while. <BR> <BR>Tracy&#39;s theory of spacing
  in <i>Letters of Credit</i> makes a great deal of sense to me, especially for the
  metal type days when it was not practical to have kerning pairs for all possible
  digraphs. Essentially, Tracy recommends carefully determining the side bearings
  for &#39;n&#39; and &#39;o&#39; such that &#34;nnonn&#34;, &#34;nnonon&#34;, and
  &#34;nnoonn&#34; all look consistently spaced, then setting the side bearings for
  all other letters so that nxn and oxo look consistent. <BR> <BR>However, to my eyes,
  no matter what side bearings I choose, &#34;oooo&#34; looks more tightly set than
  &#34;nonon&#34; and &#34;nnnn&#34;. If I widen the &#34;o&#34; side bearings, then
  &#34;ooo&#34; looks good &#40;just like &#34;nnn&#34;&#41;, but &#34;nonon&#34;
  is too loose relative to &#34;nnnn&#34;. <BR> <BR>I know there&#39;s a widespread
  sentiment that relying too heavily on kerning is just a symptom of bad side bearings,
  but it seems to me that kerning these standards might actually be the right way
  to solve the problem. <BR> <BR>There are a few ways I could go with this: <BR> <BR>1.
  Nice big side bearings on the &#34;o&#34; so that &#34;oooo&#34; looks great &#40;just
  like &#34;nnnn&#34;&#41;, then kern no and on &#40;and, of course, all other pairs
  from similar classes&#41;. <BR> <BR>2. Nice narrow side bearings on the &#34;o&#34;,
  then plus kern on &#34;oo&#34;. This seems to be closest to the side bearings I
  see in the ATF catalogues, most likely because it&#39;s easier to add a thin space
  than subtract. <BR> <BR>3. Halfway between, a bitty minus kern on &#34;on&#34; and
  &#34;no&#34;, and a bitty plus kern on &#34;oo&#34;. This seems to be the closest
  to the spirit of what Tracy is recommending, not least because it gives reasonably
  good results when kerning is turned off. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s also possible that my
  sense of &#34;oo&#34; being too tight is just plain wrong; that the side bearings
  are the right way to do this and kerning is not needed. <BR> <BR>Any insight would
  be much appreciated.'

  body: 'You don&#39;t need any kerning between o&#39;s and n&#39;s. Once you start,
    you have opened pandora&#39;s box. <BR> <BR>Certainly not for a metal-era face
    like Century, the forms of which were designed to work without kerning.  <BR>
    <BR>I have added kerning &#40;positive&#41; between lowercase round letters, in
    a sans serif. But it was for display use, very tight setting.  <BR> <BR>I put
    wider than usual sidebearings on round letters in Richler: it&#39;s good for reading
    text if you don&#39;t stop and think &#34;that&#39;s not like Garamond&#34;. It
    worked for Richler as the rounds are quite square and the sides of the round letters
    were tending towards a vertical stem.  <BR> <BR>One thing to consider is that
    the relevant &#34;sidebearing&#34; for the n is not the distance to its serif
    extrema, but to the edge of its main vertical stem. &#40;It could even be argued
    that the distance to consider is center-to-center between adjacent stems.&#41;
    You may be able to remedy your problem by adjusting the width of the serifs on
    the n.'

  body: 'Thanks for your thoughtful and illuminating response, Nick. I particularly
    liked the idea of establishing a &#34;rhythm&#34;, as opposed to the more commonly
    expressed goal of consistency &#40;which, in the limit, becomes monotony&#41;.
    I wonder if you would have responded so nicely if you knew I was planning to release
    my Century Catalogue as a free font ;<a href="http://april.fools"></a>&#41; <BR>
    <BR>In any case, I feel a little foolish. The spacing I had in my font was based
    on the 18-pt metal, which I identified as the best source for the shapes. However,
    the 18-pt spacing is too tight for text use &#40;although certainly not out of
    the range of what you see today&#41;. Trying to do tight spacing with non-kernable
    metal doesn&#39;t work that well, as you can clearly see in words like &#34;sober&#34;
    &#40;line 6 of the 18-point in <a href="http://levien.com/type/atf_1923/p0537_sm.jpg">this
    scan</a>&#41;. I think that, for this size at least, my point above stands: nn,
    no, and on all look good &#40;the word &#34;higher&#34; is a good example of all
    these classes, with a bonus g thrown in&#41;, but oo is too tight. <BR> <BR>By
    contrast, the text sizes, such as the <a href="http://levien.com/type/atf_1923/p0536_sm.jpg">10-pt</a>
    in particular, are <i>beautifully</i> spaced. You hardly miss the kern pairs;
    in fact, after loosening up my metrics a bit, many of the &#34;v&#34; and &#34;y&#34;
    pairs seemed over-kerned. <BR> <BR>I propose the following tentative conclusions:
    <BR> <BR>1. Spacing was a <i>big</i> part of the optical scaling done in the metal
    days, certainly for ATF fonts. <BR> <BR>2. For the relatively loose spacing needed
    for text, good side bearings do almost all of what you need; kern pairs are only
    needed for true problem pairs such as oy. <BR> <BR>3. Even so, if absolute consistency
    is your goal, you need slight plus kerning on oo pairs. But of course this wouldn&#39;t
    be at all authentic for a metal revival, aesthetic concerns aside. <BR> <BR>4.
    For tighter spacing, such as display work, side bearings are <i>not</i> enough.
    ATF chose the compromise of relatively small side bearings for &#39;o&#39; class,
    which at the very least left open the possibility of thin spacing &#39;oo&#39;
    class pairs &#40;although I haven&#39;t seen any evidence for this in the ATF
    specimen book&#41;.'

  body: Raph <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not sure I quite follow the conclusions but...  <BR>
    <BR>in terms of metal type, the body, not the face, is where all the action is.
    <BR> <BR>Practically all the well established metal type foundries practiced careful
    placement of the letterform on the body on a per size basis, long before the idea
    of optical scaling comes in to play. Any good old foundry type, especially from
    continental foundries, sets near perfectly, in harmony with whatever partner comes
    along. <BR> <BR>Optical scaling itself was the result of the forced size range
    jumping made possible with the pantograph matrix engraver &#40;and, ignoring the
    machine comp folks, not fully practiced by foundries until the 20th century&#41;.
    Optical sizing would be the more common term we now associate with the natural
    practice of the punch cutter. <BR> <BR>Kerning was quite possible with metal type,
    far beyond the provision of alternate body widths. Moxon discusses the tools for
    it back in the late 17th century. In the twentieth century, the printer&#39;s
    saw was often used for kerning, and there was a machine, I had a couple, type
    mortisers, that were made specifically for the task.  <BR> <BR>And there were,
    of course, thin spaces, beginning with steel quarter point, copper half point,
    brass full point... <BR> <BR>I would think the best way to authenticate the spacing
    of a metal foundry face would not be through specimen books but rather to proof
    it with type high thins between the bodies to provide information about placement.
    I believe Hrant did that with his investigation of Massive&#40;?&#41;.
