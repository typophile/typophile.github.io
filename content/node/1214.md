  not restrictive, nod to the past. It would be fun to find a use for your Uncial
  Slab. <BR> <BR>What are your plans for further development? Have you considered
  providing alternate characters or even a Roman uppercase or that would make the
  face more utilitarian? <BR> <BR>//joe '

    <BR>The typeface is pretty good, I just think that the &#34;x&#34; is too dark.
    <BR>Nice work.
