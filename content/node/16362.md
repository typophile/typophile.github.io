  body: it looks like nicks fonts has done <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/hasta-la-pasta-nf/">a
    super-cleaned-up version</a>, but I think that gramophone and nick's version are
    based on your sample which may be the actual metal version?

  body: "It's an old predigital typeface called Spiral. The only font I'm aware of
    that was made from Spiral is called <a href=\"http://members.fortunecity.com/jramstine/\"
    target=\"_blank\">Spinstee</a> (sorry about the uglines and pop-ups, but this
    is a direct link to Ramstine's site and, so, the download includes the documentation).\r\n\r\nGramophone
    seems highly influenced by Spiral, doesn't it?\r\n\r\nEdit: Paul - I wasn't aware
    of the Hasta La Pasta/Spiral connection. Thanks. Personally, though, I prefer
    the \"ragged contours\" left intact."

    from MVBFonts is close. The alternate version has swashier caps. But, it isn't
    exact.

  body: After spending 200 hours linking these sorts of curly display fonts for the
    upcoming FontBook, I can say with some confidence that the closest commercial
    font you're going to find is indeed <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=ITC.105072.0.0&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=Noa+Pail+Gauguin&sampleSize=42">ITC
    Gramophone</a>.
