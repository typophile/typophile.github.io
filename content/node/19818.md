  many families and many styles of fonts on this layout, but it works!\r\n\r\nWhat
  is up... are the rules more flexible than I thought.\r\n\r\nI was taught no more
  than 2 families per layout.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease weigh in on this...and thanks!\r\n\r\nwnf"

    type families excluding the logotype, Underware's Dolly and a sans.\r\n\r\nI think
    it's best to accept the 2 families limit as a guide, not as an absolute rule.
    There are situations where you feel the need to break this \u2018rule\u2019. But
    really, I think that we need to know the \u2018rules\u2019 (or the basics) before
    we break them otherwise we\u2019re not designing with conscious thought.\r\n"

    Folkert Gorter (Superfamous) special. Just Dolly and Avenir. The logo doesn't
    count.

    body: I think Bringhurst said it well when he explained that the rules are just
      guidelines to be studied, and don't necessarily need to be stringently followed.
      I'll dig up the quote later. Obviously, if you're using several typefaces you
      need to take extra care to make it work... but it can be done.

    the example still support constraint and I was counting the logo because it is
    such a beautiful draw."
