body: "I bought some letterpress type a while ago, and, being pieces of lead, I don't
  know of a good way to ID it. I was told that it is Garamond or Cheltenham, but I
  do not believe either of those.\r\nHere's an image of a proof I made with it. It's
  a bit messy, because I just inked up the form and used a baren to press it. It's
  clearer at the top than the bottom. If you'd like a better version, I could put
  it in the press so it's more readable.\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!
  Thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n-Sean\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FontSample_4553.png]"

  body: "It's definitely not Garamond or Cheltenham. The diagonal center stroke on
    the <strong>e</strong> looks a little like Deepdene, but the <strong>e</strong>
    in your sample is more slanted than digital versions of Deepdene, and your sample
    seems to have longer descenders. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/deepdene_6016.gif]\r\nCan
    you proof and scan some more capitals? <strong>G</strong>, <strong>M</strong>,
    <strong>Q</strong>, <strong>R</strong>, and <strong>W</strong> are often helpful
    in identifying a font."

  body: "I think this looks like Lutetia by Jan Van Krimpen. I don't know of a digital
    version. The attached sample is from the Jaspert \"Encyclopaedia of Type Faces\",
    but the 'e' should appear more angled (like your sample), according to another
    image I have from the Rookledge Type Finder.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lutetia_full_3640.gif]"

  body: Tracy's Letters of Credit has the original version of Lutetia, with the slanted
    crossbar on the e, and tells the story of how it was revised. And I'm pretty sure
    that Mike is right, that's what it is. Also Tracy tells the story of how it inspired
    Goudy to create Deepdene, though Deepdene is very different. But similar enough
    for Victor to reference it 80 years later!
