I only suggest using these if you have to, if they are really fitting to the character of the magazine, or the brand is firmly established.

Where and how many times have I heard that before?

Why won't you show or prove to us how "high-end" and "sophisticated" your magazine really is before people here go out of their way to convince you? Come on, show us some layouts, some design maquettes, some content examples..

@angurshamal...I apologize for not posting any layouts or "sweating" enough for you lol. Truth is, I would if I had anything to show. Choosing a typeface is always a huge decision for me and usually the first thing I do once I know the overal aesthetic of the project I'm going to be working on.

The magazine can't be too high-end...it's a school publication and the budget is almost nothing. I'm trying to do a lot with very little. </div>

Even if you were able to succeed on no budget, very few of your readers would get it, even if it's a private school with very wealthy pupils.

On the other hand, this is marginally better than the usual way designers approach youth, with fun, trendy, sloppy banality, distress and bright colours for the kids.

Surely there has to be a better way to "target this demographic"?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">@Nick Shinn...my school, The Art Institute of California - Orange County, puts out a small magazine every quarter for the student body. This magazine is the assignment for one of my classes this quarter and I'm the Art Director for the project. Usually, this magazine is nothing to brag about, but I'd like to change that with my issue. It just so happens that this is the 10th Anniversary of my school and they want to make this issue special. My goal is to produce something that the students won't just throw away; to make it something they want to keep around. I'm doing this by slightly altering the usual dimensions of the magazine, kicking up the visual quality to levels not seen in previous issues, making reading it a very tactile experience with lots of spot UV throughout, etc.

You ask why, if virtually no one will see it, would I want to make "a school magazine feel high-end, sophisticated and cutting edge?". The answer is simple: I take pride in my work. And in addition to it being a 10th Anniversary edition, if it comes out like I want it to, it's something I'll put in my portfolio. I'm no spring chicken...just a few months shy of my 30th birthday. 

I hope that gives you a little more insight into my reasoning for wanting a mere school magazine to look like more than it really is.</div>

I meant they won't "get it" (grok?), if "high-end, sophisticated" isn't their normal cultural milieu, which is a reasonable assumption for school students. But perhaps I underestimated the sophistication of your readers, and no doubt it's true many people admire upscale glamour, even if they can't afford it. Although I would imagine that the students at your particular school are pretty well off.

I wasn't implying that it was a "mere" school magazine -- there is no value-judgement in identifying different economic tranches for marketing purposes. In fact, IMO "high-end" is often tacky, relying on expensive materials (e.g. white space) and profuse workmanship to impress. Bling.

The idea is to target (match) the work to the audience, not merely to create something exceptional for one's peers and portfolio.

<em>My goal is to produce something that the students won't just throw away; to make it something they want to keep around. </em>

That's good.
