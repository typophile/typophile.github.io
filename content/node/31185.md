  have Helvetica Condensed Light and Baskerville, but Helvetica is old. I'd like a
  easy to read font on both sides that look good together. Any ideas?\r\n"

    not use <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/john-sans/">John Sans</a>

  body: "It depends on where you are sending your resume. Many larger companies use
    an electronic file system that relies on OCR scans of received documents. Keep
    optical character recognition in mind and you should do fine.\r\n\r\nIf you know
    for sure that your resume will actually be seen and read by humans, make it as
    pretty as you can."
