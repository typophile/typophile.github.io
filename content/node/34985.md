  body: Where's the bell? You've got all the parts of a horn except the most recognizable
    part.

  body: I know;-) The name itself was the most important and the bell became too dominant
    and would look cheesy. It should give the impression of a horm instrument not
    necessarily all the elements. If you try to blow in this logo I think you would
    blow your lounges - no exit;-)

  body: those tiny details feel out of scale to the rest of the forms, to the point
    that they actually look like mistakes. i had to look at it a long time before
    getting it, and i'm very familiar with brass instruments.

  body: The problem is that spit valves are always gross.

  body: "Keep the mouthpiece and the little loop in the 'D', add a couple more valves,
    and cut the other little details out. You may need to find a way to add a bell
    too.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: I like it a lot. What do you think about trimming out the extra elements -
    maybe leaving just the mouth piece and the pressy thing on the D? The other ones
    are visually thin and confusing to a brass novice like myself. I dig the concept
    and execution, though.
