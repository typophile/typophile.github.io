  an American company, in an overseas office (Israel).\r\n\r\nThis is important because:\r\n*
  I'm really only fluent enough for professional work in English (I'm American).\r\n*
  Salaries here tend to be extremely low, unless you work remotely for a foreign company
  (which I am already doing).\r\n\r\nThe company I work for is a commercial furniture
  seller, and I do the most basic work for their website graphics. I was working on
  some more fun design projects for their website redesign but then they got annoyed
  that I wouldn't move to NJ, where they're based, and told me I could only do the
  boring stuff.\r\n\r\nHow can I find a really enjoyable and challenging job that
  will let me telecommute, and which will pay a reasonable rate ($25 per hour or more)?\r\n\r\nI'm
  quite a decent designer although I haven't worked for any really large companies.
  I have a BA in graphic design and would love to continue my education (when I can
  afford it!). I have been working in graphic design on and off for about ten years,
  and working for my current company for a little over 1 year. I would like to be
  doing illustration, original logo design, advertising work, or anything that's a
  LITTLE more interesting than cropping pictures of office chairs (augh). I'm proficient
  in Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign, Quark and several other programs.\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas, folks? I haven't been able to find anything in the papers or on websites
  for this area, but maybe I haven't been looking in the right places.\r\n\r\nThanks!!!
  :)\r\n"

    and it even lets you search for those exclusively, but do be careful of potential
    scams, frauds, etc.\r\n\r\nSurely there is an American expatriate community in
    the city where you live... That might be a good place to look for work opportunities.
    (And don't just stick to Americans... Any English-speaking expats will do!)"

    lot of the companies that post seem quite fine with telecommuting:\r\n\r\nhttp://jobs.37signals.com/jobs/\r\nhttp://gigs.37signals.com/"
