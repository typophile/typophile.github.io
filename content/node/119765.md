  body: "Bespoke lettering? Note in particular the reverse emphasis in _A_ which makes
    it harmonize better with the _V_ next to it.\r\nSimilar idea to Sweet Titling
    No. 22 http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sweet/titling-no-22/ which has fewer lines.
    Also note a sans version with a similar number of lines in Atlas http://www.identifont.com/show?OCE\r\nDon"
