body: "I have encountered an anomaly in a PDF generated through the ExamView (8.1)
  application software: the font, Times New Roman MT Pro has \"00\" appended to the
  beginning of the Postscript name (id '6') as in the picture.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/samplePDF_3822.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  fonts were subset by default in the application software.\r\n\r\nThere does not
  appear to be any negative impact on the files but I would like to know if this is
  likely to have a knock-on effect in our production workflow using these files. Any
  insight would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
