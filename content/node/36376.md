  body: "There's a pretty good possibility that the original font used was unembellished,
    including the mid-stroke burrs. The font also looks rather compressed, which was
    probably done manually to. \r\n\r\nI wish Josh was on Typophile more often, but
    he's a busy man these days. \r\n\r\nI'm sure a well meaning email could illicit
    some better responses.\r\n\r\nyou can find it at his website: hydro74.com"
