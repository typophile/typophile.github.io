    make its character impervious to degradation. <BR> <BR>And I guess any &#34;soft&#34;
    font, like ITC Slimbach. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Thanks for all the suggestions, I liked very much Le Mond courier, but I think
    that maybe Caecilia or Officina and Mendoza or Raleigh are the ones which will
    fit the project. <BR> <BR>I have not very good idea about how each printing method
    affects the type, I think someone else could be interested in what you guys know.
