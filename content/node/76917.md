    competitions are indeed generally frowned on by professional design organizations
    and by many  designers. Nobody would think of asking a group of doctors or accountants
    (or most any other professional) to work for free in the hope that 1 person will
    get paid at the end, and professional designers shouldn't be asked to work that
    way either.\r\n\r\nBut with that said, I'd agree with you that not all designers
    agree with that, especially those just starting their business and those hit hard
    by the bad economy. I've done it once or twice myself. But it's not good for the
    profession.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "@Hrant:<em> that's an unfair -if convenient- blanket statement.</em>\r\n\r\nIt's
    accurate. Professional organizations such as the AIGA and GDC don't just frown,
    they prohibit members from spec work.\r\n\r\nI consider all type competitions
    (including type annuals that request submissions) to be spec work, because they
    require type designers to create a specimen. And they don't even reimburse winners
    for the cost of doing that.\r\n\r\nI was on Creative Review's mailing list for
    its new type annual, to which I replied,\r\n\r\n\"Thank you for your interest
    in my work.\r\nHowever, I am not disposed to compete for the privilege of providing\r\nyour
    publication with free content.\"\r\n\r\n...and was subsequently \"followed up
    on\" several times with comments such as,\r\n\r\n\"I am aware that previously
    there was an issue with the fee for an entry,\r\ntherefore if you are interested
    in submitting a typeface or typefaces we\r\nwould be willing to offer you a further
    discount.\"\r\n\r\nThe ethics of not doing spec work can seem out of place in
    the digital era.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nTo return to the topic, even if a client commits
    to a custom solution, the first step is often narrowing the focus of the brief
    by seeing which off-the-shelf designs come close to the desired tone and style.
    \r\n\r\nI'm having difficulty visualizing a vaulted-cellar bar as being either
    upscale or contemporary, but suggest you set up \"R55\" in the text field and
    search at MyFonts under the keyword \"luxury\", \"upscale\", or \"contemporary\".\r\n\r\n-

    even if AIGA could prohibit it, designers would be under no legal obligation to
    follow the AIGA's advice. It's not a union or licensing authority.  Their authority
    just comes from members' respect for their advice. "

    Open Type faces, please also submit a representative sample of extra characters.
    For Arabic or other non-Latin faces where character sets may vary, please exercise
    discretion and submit what you consider to be a sufficient character set for the
    judges to be able to make their choice. These should be supplied at 48 point,
    as should, as a bare minimum, the sample sentence The quick brown fox jumps over
    the lazy dog. Non-Latin entries may substitute a similar or equivalent phrase.
    We would also encourage entrants to submit additional samples to show their typeface
    in use. You may include headlines, short or long passages of text, or sample layouts
    showing the typeface in use in eg advertising or publications. With Display or
    Bespoke entries where entire upper and lower case alphabets or numeral sets do
    not exist, please supply all the characters available. If the typeface is to be
    used to set text, please also submit 200 words of dummy text of your choosing
    set in the following: 8/10 pt, 10/12pt, 12/14 pt. This applies to all Text entries
    and may also apply to Bespoke or Non-Latin typefaces. Each entry should be set
    in 100% black on A3 and be provided as a separate 300 dpi PDF, with a maximum
    file size of 5mb, with the name of the typeface clearly marked on each page.</em>\r\n\r\nWhy
    don't they level the playing field and provide a template?\r\nBecause that would
    be too boring, their book would look like a type catalog.\r\nSo this way they
    can have a bit of a format, but enough variety of creative input to make it slightly
    more interesting.\r\n\r\nThese publishers are cheap, they knew enough about me
    to solicit my entry, but couldn't be bothered to have a look-see if any of my
    faces, all of which have copious PDF specimens, were suitable for their publication.
    That would have been too much like work, and they would have had to pay whoever
    was doing it, e.g. give the selection committee a curation fee, rather then just
    paying them off with the publicity and kudos of being important enough to pass
    judgment on their peers.\r\n\r\nI can understand that the publishers might think
    this is the same model as for other creative awards, but for ads and brochures
    etc., those don't have to be specially made up. \r\n\r\nTypographica has a good
    plan for its \"fonts of the year\"; ask each curator to pick one typeface and
    write a few words about it -- not too onerous a task -- and then ask the chosen
    foundry to prepare a specimen, with the guarantee of publication.\r\n\r\n@Hrant:
    <em>If you do the math it becomes clear that your chances of being selected have
