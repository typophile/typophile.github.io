body: I'm programming [[swsh|contextual swashes]] for the beginning and endings of
  my script face I'm working on and I'm using the info in the fontlab manual. I tried
  the ending swashes script and it worked fine. The beginning script that I copied
  directly from the manual doesn't work. Is there a way to make this happen? As you
  can see from the screen capture the beginnings are being replaced for every letter
  even though I have an ignore substitute scripted in.

    sub [@letter @start_swash] @start';\r\n\r\nto make it work."

    silly, but you never know...\r\n\r\nOne other thing, have you tried generating
    a font and test it in InDesign, for example? Does it work?"

  body: I tried renaming the classes and that didn't do anything. I also tested the
    font in Illustrator CS2 and it did exactly what it does in the fontlab ot preview
    panel.

  body: as you have things set up now, you need to include all your x.start letters
    in your @letter class. sorry i didn't make this note earlier (i missed the jpg
    image somehow)

  body: 'Thanks Paul! The beggining are working. The only problem is that now the
    endings aren''t working. It''s like if one works it cancels out the other one
    or maybe I should change the code. Here''s a capture of what''s happening now:

  body: "Maybe the first ignore also prevents the end-swash substitution. By defining
    separate lookups, you also define the boundaries for each \"ignore\" (only valid
    within the lookup in which it was defined).\r\n\r\nfeature calt (\r\n\r\nlookup
    caltstart (\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ignore sub @letter_start @start';\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sub
    @start' by @start_swash;\r\n) caltstart;\r\n\r\nlookup caltend (\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ignore
    sub @end' @letter_end;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sub @end' by @end_swash;\r\n) caltend;\r\n\r\n)
    calt;\r\n\r\nMr Hunt's suggestion to include X.start glyphs in the @letter class
    may also applies for X.end glyph substitution. \r\nEither you include X.end glyphs
    in @letter too. Or you create separate context-classes for caltstart lookup (including
    a-z and a.start-z.start) and for caltend lookup (including a-z and a.end-z.end);
    I indicated this by adding \"_start\" and \"_end\" to \"@letter\" in the sample
    above. Both may result different substitution behavior with one/two-letter-words,
    so you should try both ways and see which looks better."

  body: i believe karsten is correct. you need a separate lookup for your starts and
    for your finishes.

    changing. Instead of ( ) it needed to be changed to { } on your code.
