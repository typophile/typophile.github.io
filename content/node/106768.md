  is the font that came off of a custom IMVU Profile job for myself. It was described
  as \"dark wood\". Where it would be easy to contact Ash, She is almost never on
  anymore. The font is unlike those I've seen before. The tops or sometimes the bottom
  of the letters will split off in what kind of reminds me like broom bristles. I
  don't know how to really describe it other than that. Thank You for any help You
  can give me."

    different letterforms than your sample, see AZ Tiki: http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/artistofdesign/az-tiki/\r\nDon\r\n"
