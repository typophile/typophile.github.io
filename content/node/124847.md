  to find a full font that corresponds to the numbers used on a race car (see photo).
  The car builder says this font was often used in the 1960s for race car numbers.
  He thinks the source is British. I'm afraid that's all I know. Thanks in advance
  for any assistance you can provide!"

    Block] looks very close:\r\nhttps://www.myfonts.com/fonts/northernblock/baufra/\r\nAlthough
    it's a new font (2012) it's based on an older design of the early 20th century.\r\n"

    body: "Thank you, fvilanakis. I appreciate your help. \r\n\r\nThe overall feel
      is very similar. However, there are subtle differences in the shape of the loops
      on the 2 and the 5 (more nearly round on the sample). And Baufra Bold has sharp
      joints and corners, whereas the sample has a slight radius in those places.
      I really need to find the exact font if it is to be of any use, since the numbers
      on the race car will be about 16-inches tall.\r\n\r\nThanks again!\r\n"
