body: "In the past several weeks, I have received two separate distribution agreements
  from entities with whom I have done business, and which I find rather alarming.\r\n\r\nBoth
  agreements contain non-disclosure provisions\u2014but, since I haven\u2019t signed
  the agreements yet, I don\u2019t feel bound by them; nonetheless, the parties shall
  remain nameless, and you can fill in the blanks.\r\n\r\nIn one instance, an established
  entity has offered to market my fonts for a 60% take; in the other, for negotiating
  OEM licenses, another entity wants 80% of the take. However, in both cases, these
  entities want zero percent of the liability, in the event that anyone files suit
  for copyright or patent infringement, or whatever.\r\n\r\nThat's right: the distributors
  want 60% or 80% of the upside, and 0% of the downside. Is it just me, or does this
  seem to be a gross abuse of what is effectively market monopolization? "

    like pitchforks and torches to me, and if we \"man the walls\" they'll be no one
    on the phones.\r\n\r\nAnother idea is perhaps to negotiate? (that's when they
    say 80, then you say 40, then they say 79, then you say 39, and so on). \r\n\r\nYet
    another idea is:  if there is in fact 0(%) downside in the protection, marketing,
    sales and support of your fonts, you should be able to do it yourself for free!
    and keep all 100%! (something I wish I could do but it seems to cost something
    to protect, market, sell and support fonts, build tools, blog, and hire guards
    for the walls)."

  body: "Those percentages are excessive for essentially acting as a distributor.
    Although as distributors it\u2019s not surprising that they\u2019re unwilling
    to take on risk; it\u2019s your product after all, not theirs. They\u2019re just
    helping you sell it. \r\n\r\nSetting up your own store is a partial solution,
    although the setup and upkeep is not trivial. The sales I make through my store
    are only about half as many compared to the sales I make through online middlemen.
    So, if I dumped my third-party distributors, maybe it would be a wash. The extra
    money I would make on direct sales would compensate for the sales lost not dealing
    with a distributor. Except right now I\u2019m making money on both, so I would
    actually lose money if I went totally independent, as well as the extra exposure
    being on a big site provides.\r\n\r\nSo, yeah, set up your own store \u2013 or
    maybe ask around about joining some other small foundry\u2019s store that\u2019s
    a good fit; that kind of mutual cooperation and assistance seems like a worthwhile
    path to explore. \r\n\r\nAnd still look for bigger distributors who don\u2019t
    insist on a huge cut. For us small foundries I suspect there\u2019s no room for
    negotiation with them. Unless you\u2019ve got something really hot that the distributor
    wants, it\u2019s no big deal to them if they don\u2019t sign you up.\r\n\r\nDavid\r\n"

    would probably work to everyone\u2019s advantage until the enterprise became successful
    enough to be bought out by the Elephant in the Room\u2014which shall remain nameless\u2014or
    sued into nonexistence for some alleged patent infringement\u2014which appears
    to be Apple\u2019s preferred method of protecting its market share.\r\n\r\nThere
    is undeniable value in having one\u2019s fonts listed on the big sites. Sheer
    gravity attracts many potential buyers, and sophisticated search/sort/tag routines
    can drive a lot of traffic to one\u2019s wares which might not have otherwise
    shown up. The large aggregators advertise aggressively and cover the infrastructure
    costs. In other words, yes: they provide a valuable service, which would be expensive
    to replicate.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, independent foundries provide the products
    which the behemoths flog so effectively: in other words, it\u2019s a symbiotic
    relationship. The problem is, the mutual nature of this interdependency isn\u2019t
    reflected in the revenue and risk-sharing terms offered. Half a loaf may be better
    than none; 20% to 40% of a loaf is another matter entirely."
