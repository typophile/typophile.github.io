  jobs this afternoon so I thought I would be giving a try at [[http://fontstruct.fontshop.com/|FontStruct]].
  This is what I came with and I'm quite happy, but I would love to hear your comments
  about it. I'm making it freely available at [[http://fontstruct.fontshop.com/fontstructions/show/daxion|
  Daxion font at FontStruct]] and you can use it for commercial projects if you find
  its 178 characters suitable.\r\nI hope you like it, cheers!"

  body: Dang, that's pretty complete for a fontstruct typeface.  Nice job! I have
    like three incomplete typefaces sitting around there, I should finish them up...

  body: I appreciate the aesthetic very much. Can't believe you have ligatures in
    there. 0.o great job. the grey value is fragmented, but that's what makes it unique,
    we can't all think like Mr.Frutiger does.
