  feature found in some fonts that come in different optical sizes (e.g. Adobe's \u203Aopticals\u2039,
  or the Latin Modern fonts). I can't seem to be able to implement that feature to
  a font I'm designing, though. FontLab, for example, will let me add and save it
  as part of the .vfb file, but loses it when generating the actual OT file. It won't
  properly read the size feature, either, when loading a font that has it.\r\n\r\nWhat
  other ways are there to add it to (a) a font in the making, and (b) to an existing
  font? Thanks in advance!"

  body: "<em>> Which ones?</em>\r\n\r\nLuaTeX; XeTeX; FontForge (as I just found out);
    probably Adobe's products (haven't used them in a while). Lua and Xe, to be precise,
    aren't doing anything entirely new in the TeX world (as TeX has been selecting
    the correct optical size automatically for about 30 years now), but they now do
    the same with OpenType fonts out of the box -- provided the \u203Asize\u2039 feature
    is present. Otherwise fonts have to be assigned to sizes manually. So for, say,
    Minion Pro Opticals, something like this...\r\n<code>\r\n\\documentclass{scrartcl}\r\n\\usepackage{fontspec}\r\n\\setmainfont{Minion
    Pro}\r\n\\begin{document}\r\n\\tiny hat einer und gemacht \r\n\\normalsize zu
    werden um \r\n\\huge von Buch wollen\r\n\\end{document} \r\n</code>\r\n\r\n...would
    result in Minion's different size variants to be selected automatically for different
    sizes.\r\n\r\nAs for FontForge, I just learned it has a dedicated \u203Asize\u2039
    tab asking for the relevant information, and apparently stores it correctly, too
    -- which solved my problem for now.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/l7dSs.png\"
    />\r\n\r\n<em>> How do you check that?</em>\r\n\r\nusing <em>otfinfo,</em> which
    reported \xBBno valid 'size' feature data in the 'size' feature\xAB. After the
    FontForge treatment, things seem to be okay, though."

    up to the typographer to decide which cut of a typeface is right for a particular
    setting, rather than have that decision made by the font.\r\n\r\nFor instance,
    if a typeface is being printed on coarse paper, reversed, or with low contrast
    between foreground and background colours, then a smaller \u201Coptical\u201D
    size would be called for. But how is a font to know what stock it is being printed
    on, and in what colour?"

    at both Microsoft and Adobe, I believe -- that as a mechanism the OTL 'size' feature
    is a bad idea: it's really a hack of the GPOS data structure to affect font selection.
    A number of better ideas are kicking around, and I'm hopeful that one of them
    will be selected for the standards process."

    I'm not in favor of standards outside of FB's until/unless we ever have to \"round
    up\", in which case FB'd move formats again to higher ground. I'm not at all hopeful
    of dramatic change in either the standards or compliance to them. Don't forget,
    a lot of work was needed to get to the lowest common denominator of font functionality
    we have today, and thems serious efforts you just can't undo. \r\n\r\nAs for benchmarks,
    the type designer making such fundamental decisions about the appearance of typography
    is tricky. When I class size for the Font Bureau library going to the web, I decide
    based on the unhinted appearance of the fonts on windows. Determining what we
    call 7 pt, or \"bold\", or the default figures, that was all fine while the world
    was stuck with books and print, but now that the world is struck with screens
    and CSS...\r\n\r\n"
