    it Terminal, as there is a foundry with that name.\r\n\r\nBTW, the Lslash/Sterling
    symbol is problematic, and the slash on oslash a bit long (Scandinavians, please
    confirm)."

  body: "Just a quick update to let you know that more weights have been added.\r\nTerminal
    Dosis is now a 7 weights Family (Extralight, Light, Book, Medium, SemiBold, Bold
    y ExtraBold)\r\n\r\nThe lighter weights are minimalist. The bolder weights have
    more personality. \r\nAlso featuring lots of alternates. The overall result is
    a family that's clean and modern, and can express a wide range of voices & feelings.\r\n\r\nDownload
    the new version at http://www.impallari.com/terminaldosis/"

  body: "Pablo,\r\n\r\njust a question. I tried it out and was wondering.\r\nThe punctuation
    glyphs seems to be one weight lighter than thay should be (at least to my eyes).
    I ended up using the extrabold punctuation when setting in bold.\r\nIs that a
    glitch or intention?\r\nThen there\u2019s a glitch with the cap A in the bold
    ttf-version, (not in the otf-version)."

    alphabet?\r\n\r\nOlexa Volochay has contributed the Cyrillics for the 'Extra Light'
    weight, but we never released it.\r\n\r\nWe still need the Cyrillics for the 'Heavy'
    weight.\r\nThem I can interpolate, and add the Cyrillic to the full family.\r\n\r\nIf
    you want to do it, I can add a new project in http://www.impallari.com/projects
    with the source files\r\n\r\n"
