  design miscellany. We would greatly appreciate any anecdotes you may know of. The
  publication will be targeted at designers of all ages as an kind of amusing factual
  compilation of tales and facts.\r\n\r\nExamples include:-  John Baskerville insisting
  on being buried standing upright. In 1820, his body was dug up and used as a sort
  of local peepshow. The curious could view it for the sum of 6 pence.\r\n\r\nWe would
  be extremely grateful for any contributions, the more entertaining the better!"

    C. (2013, March 11). Re: Intriguing design anecdotes [Online forum comment]. Retrieved
    from http://typophile.com/node/101281\r\n\r\nYou will need to do this for <strong>every</strong>
    comment you reference. Better yet, it would be best to use these comments to help
    direct you to a primary source (book, journal, something published &c) so you
    can research it more thoroughly and double check the authenticity of the comment(s).
    It is highly likely that comments are simply inaccurate. If you track down a primary
    source, you don\u2019t <em>have</em> to cite Typophile. However, on principle,
    I would make a statement to the effect of \u201Cspecial thanks to the members
    of Typophile for assisting in our research.\u201D\r\n\r\nPeople can point you
    in the right direction and save you some Google/library time, but they can\u2019t
    always be relied upon to provide you with accurate, verifiable information. This
    is especially relevant to an important final project such as yours. Knowing how
    to conduct a literature review is a significant portion of being capable to conduct
    quality research. It is also a significant amount of work. If I had to review
    a paper, and the bulk of the references were forum comments, I probably wouldn\u2019t
    \ mark it as it would be extremely to difficult and time consuming to double check
    them all. I\u2019d simply pass it back and ask them to provide me with proper
    references. It\u2019s kind of like passing the buck to other researchers and your
    professor.\r\n\r\nIs this undergraduate or graduate research?"
