body: "I realize that my request is general and subjective. I\u2019m in the brainstorming
  stage of designing a CD album with liner notes and CD imprint for a live band performance
  of 1970s songs. I don\u2019t even know what the songs are at this point. For right
  now, the background is an extreme blowup of someone wearing a tie-dyed tee shirt
  wearing buttons of the members of the band and a trippy but post-psychedlic peace
  button. For right now, I\u2019m using Arnold Boecklin, the typeface from That \u201970s
  Show for the name of the band and the performance. I like it, but I my wind up rethinking
  it at a later date. I\u2019ve spray-painted the world \u201CLiVE!\u2019 in Photoshop
  and imported it on top of the shirt. So here\u2019s my request: Off the top of your
  brilliant minds, name some other fonts I might possibly use for headlines and even
  body copy for a 1970\u2019s tie-dyed integration."

    a typeface with <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=psychedelic\">this
    keyword</a>. And Arnold B\xF6cklin is more than <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/show?EX\">100
    years old</a>."

  body: "Thank you for the comment. Yes, I knew Arnold Boecklin was even older than
    I. I was branded the headline to the show on TV, That \u201970s Show, which used
    Arnold Boecklin. Which goes to show ya, type is about context."

  body: Tie-Dye and the psychodelic bit  was really more of a 60's kind of thing.  Many
    of the heavier Art Nouveau faces like Arnold Boeklin, Roberta, Hobo, etc. were
    the look of the day

  body: "Don't get too fancy with psycedelic faces. less is more. use it sparingly.
    the rest can be Futura, Akzidenz Grotesk, Franklin Gothic, Compacta....\r\n\r\nIf
    you use something like Mojo, keep in mind that you need to distort it a lot in
    order to look like 60's poster art: http://www.wes-wilson.com/wp-content/gallery/brignall-article/brignallimg1.gif\r\n\r\nDon't
    get too fancy with colors and effects. It's easy to make it look cheesy or retro
    like this: http://ec3.images-amazon.com/images/P/B0007IO6WS.01._SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg
    \ Doesn't look anything like the psychedelic era to me.\r\n\r\nYou might wanna
    go to a used record store to get some inspiration.\r\n"
