body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a typeface suitable for printing on a professional
  and high-quality offset printer at 1 - 2 pts. The printed text should look good
  when looked at under a magnifying glass, and should be legible without as well.\r\n\r\nAfter
  doing some research, I came across an earlier, similar post: http://typophile.com/node/36897\r\n\r\nWhich
  lists these several typefaces that work for small text:\r\n\r\n- Freight Micro\r\n-
  Franklin Gothic\r\n- Bell Centennial\r\n- La formica\r\n- Miniscule\r\n\r\nThere
  is also the small text list here: https://www.fontshop.com/people/cole-marshall/fontlists/small-text\r\n\r\nHowever,
  I would love to hear the community's recommendations and experiences working with
  small typefaces at 1 - 2 pts so I can better select a typeface for my project.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    could read type that small without magnification; especially folks over 30 as
    eyesight gets worse as we age."

  body: I've successfully used Sackers Gothic Light for a copyright line that was
    1.45 pt printed on a 1200dpi laser printer. It would do just as well on offset
    and could probably go smaller too.

  body: "At that size with offset printing, a lot depends on the paper. Ink soaks
    into the paper and spreads a bit (dot gain). With coated paper it spreads less.
    With absorbent paper it spreads more.\r\n\r\nIn other words, on more absorbent
    paper, you might be wise to use a typeface with thinner strokes since you can
    anticipate them beefing up some. On the other hand, depending on the layout application
    you're using (InDesign, for example) and the profile settings you've plugged into
    it, dot gain on tiny objects, like halftone dots, might already be taken into
    consideration.\r\n\r\nYou also need to consider the output resolution of the printer's
    image or platesetter, which is typically somewhere between 1200 and 4800 dpi.
    If you want sharp letters and intact serifs, you'll want the highest output resolution
    possible.\r\n\r\nBest bet: find a good offset printing company and ask the prepress
    people."

  body: "Thanks for all the suggestions so far.\r\n\r\nI'm creating my file in Illustrator
    and will be handing off the print file as a PDF, which means the text will all
    be vector. There are no raster images in my print file so, and correct me if I'm
    wrong here, the DPI of my file doesn't actually matter.\r\n\r\nThe paper stock
    will be taken care of by the professional printer. I trust in them to pick a paper
    stock that'll be best suitable for my application.\r\n\r\nAs for choosing a typeface,
    can you recommend me any specific typefaces to use? Also, what should I be looking
    for when it comes to the typeface? I see that some typefaces that are designed
    for small text, such as the Minuscule Typeface, have little notches instead of
    sharp 90 degree edges. I'm guessing that's to prevent any ink from pooling in
    the area since that's a real concern at very small sizes.\r\n\r\nSo, a couple
    more questions:\r\n\r\n1. What are some specific typefaces you recommend for printed
    text in 1 - 2 pts?\r\n2. What kind of traits should I be looking for in a typeface
    for printing text in 1 - 2 pts?\r\n3. My print file contains purely text, and
    so purely vector. Do I still have to worry about the output DPI?\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "I'll decline recommending specific typefaces since there are many that would
    work. As I said, much also depends on the paper, the resolution of the output,
    the inks that are used and the quality of the printing.\r\n\r\nIf it were me and
    playing it safe, I'd select a typeface without lots of detail. A nice, clean,
    even, generic sans-serif face without much difference between thicks and thins
    ought to work just fine. Large counters would help too. If you can find one with
    built-in ink traps (the little notches), that's a plus. As you mentioned, those
    notches help prevent the ink from bleeding to where it's not supposed to be (the
    dot gain that I mentioned) and, subsequently, rounding off the acute angles and
    filling in the counters of the glyphs.\r\n\r\nAs for DPI not mattering with vector
    files, well, it's true that vector files are resolution independent, but not in
    the way you're thinking. Yes, they can be scaled up or down with no loss of quality.\r\n\r\nThe
    part you're missing is that vector files still must be rasterized at output. Whether
    a simple desktop laser printer or a high-end platesetter, the Raster Image Processer
    (RIP) in the output device converts the file to a raster equivalent at whatever
    resolution it's capable of producing. An inexpensive laser printer might RIP the
    vector file at 600 dpi. An expensive platesetter might RIP that same vector file
    at 4800 dpi. There are micro-printing techniques with even higher resolutions,
    but it's very much a specialty thing.\r\n\r\nObviously, when you're printing type
    that small, you want the vector files ripped at the highest-possible resolution
    that the output device can handle and that the plates and the press are capable
    of printing.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that might seem obvious \u2014 but I'll mention
    it anyway \u2014 is that you'll need to print this in a solid color. The type
    will be too small to handle halftone dots or ink registration issues.\r\n"

  body: "> My print file ... purely vector. Do I still have to \r\n> worry about the
    output DPI?\r\n\r\nYes, you want a printer who has very good equipment and is
    used to challenging projects. \r\n\r\nAsk to see printed samples of tiny type
    they've printed. Your best bet might be a large, expensive print shop that can
    show you work they've done for picky corporate clients. Some small shops do good
    work too, but again ask to see printed samples.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that most shops
    won't guarantee that type that small will be readable with the naked eye."

    printing to create any color or shade of gray.

    it.\r\n\r\nAs for the output file, since my content is 100% vector-based am I
    fine to simply choose a low DPI setting for 'Raster Effects' in my Adobe program?
    I understand the final output file that goes into the printer will have to be
    rasterized, but I plan on handing over the print file to the printer as a PDF
    (and they can RIP it themselves).\r\n\r\nThanks for describing important attributes
    for fine-size printing. I think I have a couple good candidates based on your
    description."

  body: Another question, are inkwells important for laser printing? I would guess
    no because will laser there will be no bleeding, but I may be wrong!

  body: "Sorry I don't know technical details about laser printing. I just use it
    for proofing pieces that will later be professionally printed. \r\n\r\nRegarding
    the RIP, I'd ask the printer if they'd prefer a PDF or the native Adobe file.
    I tend to be wary of printers who want PDFs because it suggests to me that they
    don't have skilled staff in the pre-press department. Original files give them
    more flexibility when doing the pre-press work."

  body: "Typonaut, you shouldn't be using any raster effects on your 2-point type,
    but if your question is broader than that...\r\n\r\nEven though Illustrator is
    a vector-based drawing application, it still includes some effects that are resolution-dependent
    and which will rasterize at the resolution specified in the Document Raster Effects
    Settings.\r\n\r\nEffects like transparent drop shadows, glowing edges, blurs,
    feathers, certain 3D effects, etc., will rasterize at the resolution you've specified
    rather than at the maximum resolution of the output device.\r\n\r\nFor example,
    you'd want the edges of solid objects output at the highest possible resolution
    to avoid visible jagged edges along curved or diagonal edges. Black text is a
    perfect example of where this is important.\r\n\r\nOther effects, like those I
    mentioned, don't need that kind of high-resolution treatment. In offset printing,
    for example, those effects would be printed using halftone dots where the screen
    frequency is unlikely to exceed 150lpi. That being the case, those effects would
    only need to be rasterized at about twice the screen frequency, or 300ppi.\r\n\r\nIn
    other words, for most print output purposes, you'll probably want the Document
    Raster Effects Setting set to 300ppi if you're using any Illustrator effects.
    For that matter, if you're building an Illustrator file for print, it's always
    a good idea to make sure that you've checked this setting, just in case it's needed
    by some effect in the document that you've overlooked or not realized needed it.\r\n\r\nI'm
    unsure why Adobe hasn't programmed Illustrator to calculate these things automatically
    based on the RIP, but I imagine there's a good (and very technical) reason for
    it.\r\n\r\nAs for your question about laser printers, no there's not really the
    equivalent of dot gain since toner doesn't soak into the paper. Even so, with
    your 2-point text, ink well/traps might help offset some of the inherent fuzziness
    that occurs along the edges and that can round out the inside corners slightly,
    but my guess is that the benefits would be marginal. If you're planning on printing
    whatever you're working on with a laser printer, keep in mind that even high-resolution
    laser printers barely match the output resolution of the lower resolution RIPs
    used for offset work."
