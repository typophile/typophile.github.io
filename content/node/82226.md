body: Hello, my friend designer works on a corporate identity for a large client.
  They decided to use Georgia as the alternative typeface family for office use. Could
  you please recommend me a compatible Arabic typeface available as a system font
  on a Windows platform? Thanks.

  body: personally I prefer Karim Lt, because it has a relatively High contrast compared
    to Georgia, though they have very different atmosphere, Georgia is modern, but
    Karim is generally based on traditional calligraphy. But they could work together.

  body: What about Mitra? The typeface is less calligraphic than Karim, but still
    holds the traditional shape.
