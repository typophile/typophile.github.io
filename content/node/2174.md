  body: The molded plastic &#40;26.003&#41; rocks. <BR> <BR>The compositor general&#39;s
    message &#40;26.004&#41; is very  <BR>funny, but it doesn&#39;t need the front.

  body: ' &#62; no.1 is good too but without the back <BR> <BR>promo maybe, but strong
    concept none the less. the designer has used a heart metaphor in two distinct
    visual ways while managing to tie them together conceptually which gives it more
    depth. that&#39;s why i like it. <BR> <BR>m '
