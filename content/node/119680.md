  the author says that text figures should always be used outside of full-caps environments.\r\n\r\nTo
  me, this makes complete sense for typeface styles in the eighteenth century and
  before, as well as for many modern revival typefaces. I was wondering if there is
  any disagreement with this piece of advice for particular styles of typefaces. I\u2019m
  thinking of Modern faces (like Didot), some Transitional faces (Baskerville) and
  especially certain sans faces. It seems wrong to foist the typographic convention
  of non-lining figures, long-standing as it is, onto modern styles of type for which
  geometric rationality is paramount.\r\n\r\n(In a similar vein, type designers\u2019
  penchant for adding quaint ligatures to sans type seems, well, a bit odd.)\r\n\r\nHas
  anyone else thought about or discussed this issue?"

    OpenType menus, I have been including both lining and oldstyle \uFB01gures in
    all my (text) typefaces, irrespective of genre. I don\u2019t want it to look like
    there is anything missing. e.g. Scotch Modern:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/figs_6304.png]\r\n\r\nThen
    it is up to the typographer to choose which style is most appropriate.\r\nHowever,
    I do tend to make the default \uFB01gure style correspond with the traditional
    style for the genre."

  body: "I know that classic typewriter typefaces used semi-old style numbers (like
    Georgia, the numeral 1 was like lining numbers rather than like a small capital
    I) except that the degree to which the numbers went above or below the line was
    so small, they were treated like ranging numbers.\r\n\r\nA typeface like Futura,
    for example, probably would not look bad with oldstyle numerals, since Futura's
    width proportions, among other things, are similar to those of old style faces
    rather than modern faces.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I'm not a fan of oldstyle numerals,
    but it's not a question of authenticity for me; they cause the same problems in
    Garamond, where they are the normal form associated with the typeface, as they
    would for Times Roman. So if someone prefers oldstyle numerals, I would concede
    that one the same freedom I want for myself."

    with any historical tradition. \r\n\r\n\"Old Style?\" \"Quaint?\" Perhaps. But
    non-aligning numerals and yes, some ligatures, actually help maintain the visual
    flow and unity of a line of type, aiding readability. When they are badly or indifferently
    applied to sans serif typefaces, they can be downright distracting\u2014even awful.
    But they don't have to be if well and thoughtfully done.\r\n\r\nAs for \"geometric
    rationality\" being paramount in modern type design\u2014hogwash. That may have
    been the impetus for people like Paul Renner, Edward Johnston and others creating
    early geometric sans faces, but we entered the post-modern era of type design
    long, long ago. \r\n\r\nThe Bauhaus is dead, long live the Bauhaus\u2014or any
    other bygone era these days. \r\n\r\nGiven that the first sans serif typeface
    dates from the first half of the 19th century, not the 20th, what is \"historically\"
    appropriate as it pertains to them? If a typeface fulfills both form and function,
    I'm a fan."

    anyone's pronouncements about what should and shouldn't be done when it comes
    to issues that are largely matters of aesthetics. Text figures have their place,
    as do lining figures. There might be a few rules of thumb, but hard and fast rules
    are made to be broken. For me, it's mostly a matter of what seems appropriate
    when considering the specifics of the situation at hand."

  body: "Jchthys, my point was that if a designer only adds non-aligning figures and
    ligatures to a contemporary sans serif typeface because he or she thinks they
    have to be there\u2014and executes them poorly\u2014the results can be jarring.\r\n\r\nIf
    a designer doesn't want to add them, then he or she shouldn't. \r\n\r\nBut unless
    the lining numerals are exquisitely designed and sized to flow with the rest of
    the alphabet I'd hesitate to use that particular typeface to set long stretches
    of body copy. Setting up and applying character styles to all the instances of
    numbers (to reduce their size slightly so they don't stick out like sore thumbs)
    in a long text is much more laborious than selecting non-aligning figures. And
    the results are less visually pleasing, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nAnd if the letter
    forms are designed in such a way that the curve of the f never abuts with the
    dot of the i or another f or an l (just to name one ligature pairing), then they
    aren't necessary. But if those and other character pairings do crowd one another,
    then ligatures should be offered\u2014regardless of whether the typeface is a
    classical revival or Modern with a capital M."

    they just can't help over-designing things. If they like those sorts of ligatures,

    thanks for the link. Bringhurst's The Elements of Typographic Style is approaching
    the 25-year mark in a few years, and maybe it's time to revisit its \"rules\"\u2014especially
    since they date from the early years of digital type design, and are heavily rooted
    in the conventions of the moveable type and phototypesetting eras.\r\n\r\nI still
    encounter clients who refuse to let me use non-aligning figures in running text
    (\"What are those weird numbers?\"), who balk at combining sans serif and serif
    faces in a design (\"Isn't there a rule against that?\"), and who think ligatures
    are a misprint.\r\n\r\nAt least Bringurst gives me some backup on the major issues."
