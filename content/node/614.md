  body: ' Hrant, I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s a good idea to generalize like that.  <BR>
    <BR>The right to transfer font software is governed by the foundry&#39;s End User
    License Agreement -- that&#39;s the legal thing you &#34;sign&#34;/agree to when
    you license &#40;i.e. &#34;buy&#34;&#41; a font. Some foundries allow it, others
    do not. <BR> <BR>The paragraph addressing this is usually not hard to find. It
    often has a heading like &#34;Transfer,&#34; &#34;Transfer of Rights,&#34; &#34;Assignment
    of Rights,&#34; something like that. <BR> <BR>Of just the few EULAs I checked
    quickly: Adobe, Monotype, Carter &amp; Cone allow for a transfer of rights; Font
    Bureau, Emigre, and Hoefler Type Foundry do not. <BR> <BR>When transfer is allowed,
    the specific terms of transfer are spelled out in the EULA and are usually along
    the lines Hrant mentioned. When in doubt, check your EULA. <BR> <BR>-- Kent. '

    FB and HTF I haven&#39;t looked at, but I remember checking the Emigre EULA and
    failing to notice anything at all about &#34;transfer&#34;. If there&#39;s no
    mention of it, what happens? Also: is it possible that disallowing a transfer
    is illegal in some states? <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: Well, Emigre is the one example which doesn&#39;t address transfer in a separate
    paragraph. But paragraph 4 of their <A HREF="http://www.emigre.com/EUL.html">on-line
    EULA</A> says, <BR> <BR>&#34;The Emigre Font Software or documentation may not
    be sublicensed, sold, leased, rented, lent, or given away to another person or
    entity.&#34; <BR> <BR>This seems pretty explicit in not allowing transfer. <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;m not a contract lawyer, but I&#39;m pretty sure there is no way for
    the states to prohibit an agreement from being nontransferable. It&#39;s a pretty
    common element of contractual agreements, which a EULA is, in effect. <BR> <BR>--

  body: ' It doesn&#39;t include &#34;re-sold&#34;. Is that maybe a legal loophole
    deal? Probably you&#39;re right though, the EULA does forbid transfer. But I wonder
    if it would hold up in court. Not that people would actually pay for the Emigre
    fonts that I own... But selling off the back issues is appealing. According to
    some recent eBay activity their street price seems to be less than half of what
    they charge if you buy directly, but still. <BR> <BR>BTW, what if you die? Can
    the font be given as an inheritance? <BR> <BR>hhp '

    <BR> <BR>very important question, Hrant! you would really have to be careful who
    you put in your will -- you might put yourself in danger if, say, you willed your
    copy of the Compatil family to a ruthless fellow designer!! '

    talking about the Emigre magazines, right? They&#39;re not governed by a EULA,
    because you don&#39;t license a magazine, you buy it outright. Then, I suppose,
    if you want and if you can, you sell it on eBay, or wherever. <BR> <BR>&#62;BTW,
    what if you die? Can the font be given as an inheritance? <BR> <BR>This is a good
    question. I don&#39;t know; you planning on testing this out any time soon? ;-&#41;  <BR>
    <BR>Contracts and other kinds of license agreements often address whether the
    rights assigned extend to the estate and any heirs, but that doesn&#39;t seem
    to be a part of font licenses in particular. I wonder if it&#39;s covered in general
    software licenses. &#40;I&#39;m too lazy/busy to go dig one up.&#41; <BR> <BR>Interestingly,
    the FB EULA does explicitly state that in the event of the licensee&#39;s bankruptcy,
    the agreement is automatically terminated. So, I guess FB fonts cannot be tallied
    in a business&#39;s assets. <BR> <BR>-- K. '
