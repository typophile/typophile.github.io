body: "I would like some suggestions and advice of what to keep in mind when choosing
  a new font for company that goes with an old logo. \r\n\r\nMy company is changing
  its website, and wants to keep its existing logo, but change the font that goes
  with it. The logo is square, has three parts and is brown and blue.\r\n\r\nMy existing
  font on website is Eurostyle Extended, on existing letterhead I don't know what
  it is, but is different on all marketing tools like visiting card, letterhead etc.
  \r\n\r\nHence to freeze on one font, how should I go about picking one? Our band
  roughly stands for innovation, young and dynamic staff, agriculture and biotechnology
  related business.\r\n\r\nI personally like Calibri, but not sure if it goes.\r\n\r\nPLEASE
  HELP\r\n\r\n"
