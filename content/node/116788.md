    you might try Cooper Black Swash Italic, designed by Oswald Bruce Cooper. A digital
    version is available as Umbriago NF http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/umbriago-nf/
    You might need to compress it to fit the bottom line.\r\nBTW there used to be
    a digital version of Cooper Black Swash Italic by Ian Lynam published by Wordshape
    at Myfonts, but it is no longer available there. You can get it at http://www.youworkforthem.com/font/T3177/cooper-black-swash-italic

    which lacks the rounded \"friendly\" letters of your shirt or Cooper, but as you
    can see has a huge variety of swash letters.\r\nDon"
