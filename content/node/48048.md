    If I understand things correctly Deseret was ditched by its creators long before

  body: "Wow, I finally decide to make a typophile account, and someone is asking
    about the deseret alphabet.\r\n\r\nI suppose you\u2019ve looked here: http://www.deseretalphabet.com/
    ? I didn\u2019t read through it, but there are some images of the books printed
    in the alphabet that are pretty interesting.\r\n\r\nWhat exactly are you interested
    in learning about it? At my university, one of the projects for the sophomore
    typography class is to redesign a number of characters in the deseret alphabet,
    since theoretically one of the main reasons it failed was simply very poor design.
    It lacked a lower case, ascenders, descenders, and any sort of consistency between
    characters. There are probably a few BYU grads here on typophile who have this
    project archived away somewhere :)\r\n\r\nFrom what I remember from class, there
    were a few theoretical premises for the development of a new alphabet or language
    among a body of people that included 1) an isolated location (Utah, then known
    as Deseret) and 2) a strong leader (Brigham Young). There were more reasons than
    that, but those were the two that I remember. They also felt the need for a phonetic
    alphabet because a large amount of people were immigrants who did not speak English,
    and they needed an easier way to teach it.\r\n\r\nMy teacher showed us some copies
    of grammar books set in the alphabet and I believe someone in the class was even
    able to bring in a Book of Mormon from his grandfather who wrote a thesis paper
    on it. I remember hearing the Univeristy of Utah owns most of the remaining deseret
    alphabet books. They hold on to them to make people think they\u2019re rare :)\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll

  body: "Without descending into calling early Mormonism a cult, it does seem that
    part of the intent on the Mormon leaders' part, or at least the intent as seen
    through the eyes of non-Mormons at the time, was for \"the language now introduced...
    to make the faithful still more peculiar than anything that distinguishes them
    from other mortals,\" as The New York Herald wrote in 1859.\r\n\r\nThis got me
    thinking about religious languages and scripts, not only as a way to isolate and
    control knowledge, but also as an individual's spiritual expression. The Catholic
    church, of course, kept the Bible in Latin for hundreds of years, probably the
    most used example of the downsides to controlling a sacred language. But then
    there's also speaking in tongues, most commonly associated with Pentecostal Christianity,
    which typically has no discernable structure, but is usually thought of by its
    practitioners as being the language of angels, or sounding like the languages
    of the Hebrew and Aramaic Bible. This seems to be the exact opposite of a controlled
    language, being entirely personal, but it goes even farther than Latin, in that
    rather than an elite few who can understand it, nobody except the speaker could
    understand it. I came across this [[http://realmagick.tripod.com/enochian1.jpg|Enochian
    alphabet]], which apparently is believed by those who have studied it to be derived
    from speaking in tongues. Does anyone know of any other scripts that have come
    about as a way to transcribe the experience of speaking in tongues?\r\n\r\n"

    as the Spirit gave them utterance.\r\n5  And there were dwelling at Jerusalem

    and for use only with the English language.\r\n\r\nThere are hobbyists who read

  body: "It is true that one of the stated purposes of the alphabet was to separate
    the Mormons from the rest of the world. That being said it also served a pragmatic
    purpose. The person primarily responsible for the alphabet was George D. Watt,
    said to be the first British convert to the church who studied shorthand under
    Pitman himself. When he emigrated to the States and joined the main body of the
    church he was immediately put to work as a scribe for the prophet. In a time where
    there were no voice recorders having someone that could transcribe the spoken
    word in real time was extremely useful, especially if you believe that the prophet
    is a living oracle. One of the primary reasons that so many of Brigham Young's
    speeches survive in full text is because of George D. Watt's shorthand ability.
    Compare this to the speeches of Joseph Smith that only exist in fragmented notes
    (though Joseph Smith's writings do persist; from what I understand Brigham Young
    wasn't much of a writer).\r\n\r\nIt's then easy to understand why Brigham Young
    may have been excited about the new science (at the time) around phonetics and
    orthographic reform. It sounds odd now to invent a new alphabet, but there were
    a lot of prominent people trying just that during this time period. It just so
    happened that one of the only people with the political clout to make it happen
    was Brigham Young. As it turns out, starting a new alphabet is challenging for
    many reasons. The alphabet was never very widely adopted and ultimately died after
    the saints' isolation ended with the completion of the transcontinental railroad.
    (I'm writing this from memory, so I may be wrong about some of the timings)\r\n\r\nThe
    metal type version of the alphabet is pretty ugly. However, the handwritten version
    can be really beautiful, particularly the cursive. It was designed to be written
    very quickly. Many of the vowels are contained in the upstrokes of a running script.
    If I remember correctly the foundry commissioned in New York to cast the type
    version was called Russell and Company (this was the second batch of type commissioned,
    which is what we mostly see today; the first casting of the alphabet was for the
    Deseret News, and was much rougher). They based the forms on scotch romans that
    were popular at the time. In my mind their typographic interpretation of the handwritten
    forms could have been better, though they were likely instructed by their clients
    on specifically how the typographic forms were to look. Most of the problems come
    from the dissonance between shapes created by a running hand created with a pointy
    nib pen and the shapes of a scotch roman which are (however distantly) based on
    a broad nibbed pen. Particularly problematic are the vowels, which had thin stems
    (because they were written with upstrokes in coursive). It's true that the characters
    don't have ascenders and descenders, but I see this as less of a problem than
    the rhythm issues caused by the odd thin stems and curly terminals.\r\n\r\nI'm
    remembering this from a paper I wrote about this is college. I spent a fair amount
    of time in the special collections section of the BYU Library. At the time I attempted
    a reinterpretation of the type that was more respectful of the cursive origins
    of the characters."
