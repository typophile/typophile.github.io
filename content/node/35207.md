  body: "I used Fontseek (www.fontseek.com) and saw that a Japanese 'freebie' site
    had that font. It is the same font as your sample, but the site is gone. I checked
    a bunch of other freebie sites I know, but this font was not shown.\r\n\r\nFrankly,
    this seems to be a rather common style (hand-printed lettering), and there are
    literally thousands of fonts like this, available for free all over the internet.
    I'd suggest finding a site that categorizes their fonts and searching through
    the handwritten fonts. I'm sure you can find something to let you look informal
    without using (uggh) Comic Sans.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
