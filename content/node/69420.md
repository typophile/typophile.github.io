    and me ashamed. Can this post be consigned to the dustbin now.

  body: "The proverb speaks of the special relationship between the two European nations
    and is unique in not having similarities to any other relationship, so now as
    before, to the two nations. The original text was the following: \"Hungarian,
    Pole are Brothers and (to do) the horse and the glass. Both swashbucklers, both
    spruce, may God bless them.\"  \r\n\r\nThe formula was probably built after the
    fall of the Confederation of Bar, among the leaders of the anti-Russian uprising,
    who found political asylum in Austria in the Spis region or Pre\u0161ov. During
    the Confederation Pre\u0161ov became the seat of Generality - chief of the Confederate
    government. Here the 13 October 1770 passed the Act of the dethronement of King
    Stanislaus Augustus Poniatowski.\r\npardon my translation [pl.wikipedia.org]"
