  body: "Hmmm\u2026 this is sort of tricky. The Vikings did not have \"typefaces.\"
    By the time that printing was invented, the Norsemen has long-since settled down,
    converted to Christianity, built European kingdoms, etc.\r\n\r\nDo you want something
    that mimics runic lettering? Do you want runes, or normal letters that look runic?
    (that would be anachronistic, I think\u2026)\r\n\r\nI would stay away from Uncial
    typefaces. Lots of people use these for Viking-themed thing because they look
    old, mystical, medieval, etc. But these are usually based on Irish handwriting.
    There are several fonts that mimic Irish book hands from the time of the Viking
    invasions. But that would be inauthentic\u2026 sort of funny though, to use typefaces
    based on the style of handwritting of their victims.\r\n\r\nIf you want something
    Scandinavian, but old, you should look at fonts based on Germanic typefaces from
    1450\u20131700 or maybe even 1800. The Scandinavians were printing with blackletter
    typefaces until then, just like the Germans, Austians, Dutch (sort of), Bohemians,
    etc. Heck, until as late as the 1860s, large parts of what is now northern Germany
    (and Poland?) belonged to Denmark and Sweden. Norway wasn't an independent country
    until the beginning of the 20th Century."

  body: Is that 7th century or 12th, or somewhere in between? I didn't know there
    was so much in it, but this chap seems to have done the leg work. I suppose runic
    to celtic is the breadth of styles. http://www.celtic-art.com/reference/viking_art.php3
