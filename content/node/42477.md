  need things to just snap into place without much trial and fiddling? Personally,
  I find Caslon to have a strange, almost magical ability to set and harmonize the
  page with very little effort on my part. I find that it works for both titling and
  body, sports a large character set, handsome smallcaps, and lovely italics.\r\nIf
  the rush job calls for a serif, I usually go with either Univers or Myriad, but
  these never set without some fiddling and polish.\r\n"

  body: "My pick for the serif font that works perfectly everywhere is Linotype Sabon
    with oldstyle figures. You'll find it on wall displays in museums and well as
    in their catalogs, in slick magazines, in annual reports--it's as close to perfection
    as any. And Linotype's Sabon Next, tho overpriced, gives additional weights missing
    from the original.\r\n\r\nFor book design, it's either Sabon or Janson--both work
    in books every single time.\r\n\r\nThough it has few fans here, Stone Serif is
    my personal workhorse, including my own stationery. Warnock and ITC New Baskerville
    are good too. Galliard would be great here too except the italics are just too
    fussy, tho not everybody minds that."

  body: "It would seem to me that the answer to this question is a font you're familiar
    with and know how to use. In short, the answer lies in the designer & his/her
    experience, not some magical property of particular typefaces.\r\n\r\nFor example,
    I used Linotron 202 Sabon for years., Could always get it to work. Never could
    get PostScript Type 1 Sabon to work. And Sabon Next doesn't look at all like \"Sabon\"
    to me, which just shows a difference between me & mondoB."

  body: "I don't do anything that could remotely be considered professional design,
    but whenever I have a project for which I don't have any sort of inspiration of
    what typefaces to use, I generally fall back on Myriad and Minion.\r\n\r\nThough
    I feel like I would be a big Meta and Meta Serif proponent if I weren't a poor
    college student and could afford them (or if my school's computers had them)."
