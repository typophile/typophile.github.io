  is.\r\nHe is a couple of screens:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://i56.tinypic.com/24vig6x.jpg\"

  mean the not-Eurostyle-one and that I have a Dutch modification installed.\r\n\r\nWho
  can give me the final answer?\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nMartijn"

  body: "Thanks for your reply.\r\nIndeed looks a bit like Handel Gothic, but it should
    be a separate font. Especially the numbers are different.\r\nThey actually use
    \"EuroTechnic\" instead of Eurostile, so maybe we need to search in foreign libraries.\r\n\r\nMore
    on EuroTechnic:\r\nhttp://fontpark.net/en/font/euro-technic-extended-bold/\r\n\"Copyright

    name of the other font?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nMartijn"

  body: "I asked Ray on Twitter:\r\n\"Sorry, I don't recognize that font. Trivia:
    I worked as a game tester on the PSX version of that game.\"\r\n\r\nYour suggestions
    look very close, indeed, but still no match. Very curious for what font it really
    is. Probably a freebie or something from a unknown library.\r\n\r\nI was planning
    to search for and ask the original frontend designer, but it appears he committed
    suicide in 2007. Very tragic. :("

  body: "Each glyph is saved in the game as a separate image, so there's probably
    no kerning possible at all. The game is from 1999, so it should be older than
    that.\r\nThanks in advance for searching. I'll try some font cds tomorrow, too."

  body: "Thanks for the feedback and so sad to hear such news from the designer.\r\nI
    thought also about some obscur freebie because of this so poorly (un)kerned font.
    Feels really amateurish to me but I could be wrong. I'd try to dig a little more
    bit the techy freebie sections at DaFont tomorrow."
