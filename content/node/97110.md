  think I have found the fonts for the 'M' and the 'G' (although I would love some
  validation based on what you think), but I am really interested in the 'U' font,
  which I have been unable to find.  Thanks for your help and here's the link. \r\nhttp://www.tumblr.com/tagged/the-mug-mug\r\nIf
  you click the picture and then the 'High-res' link, there is a bigger picture.\r\nI
  have also attached a slightly cleaned-up version of just the U, but it is pretty
  small."
