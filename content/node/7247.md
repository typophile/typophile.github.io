  body: It&#39;s definitely not Times. I sense the hand of Hermann Zapf, but I can&#39;t
    quite place it. It reminds me a bit of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/zapf-renaissance/b-ef-light-italic/testdrive.html?s=Ocimum+Biosolutions&amp;p=48">Zapf
    Renaissance</a>. Adobe <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/utopia/italic/testdrive.html?s=Ocimum+Biosolutions&amp;p=48">Utopia
    Italic</a> is not <i>way</i> off, but obviously lacks the strong calligraphic
    stress. &#40;Utopia is also available as a free font, by the way&#41;

    by the way&#34;?

    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> but I believe that Adobe donated Utopia to the X11 consortium,
    and that a version of may be freely distributed &#40;under <a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/utopia/readme.utopia">these
    terms</a>&#41;. It can be found in various places, such as on CTAN <a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/utopia/?filename=fonts/utopia/&amp;action=/tools/filesearch&amp;catstring=fonts/utopia/">here</a>.
