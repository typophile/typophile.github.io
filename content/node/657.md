  body: the short answer &#40;if an answer after 11 hours can be considered a &#34;short&#34;
    answer&#41; from Victoria is &#34;almost&#34;... it has some of the qualities
    of Nick Shinn&#39;s Beaufort Bold but, if I may say, without all of Beaufort&#39;s
    elegance. For example, the &#34;S&#34; is more stable in Beaufort, while the sample
    &#34;S&#34; seems to lean to the right a bit. The serifs differ significantly,
    as well.  <BR> <BR>... will keep looking.
