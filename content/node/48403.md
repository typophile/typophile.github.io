body: "I'm drawing a complete blank here. I need a typeface which is suitable for
  bible use, with a historical spanish flavour. Preferably an OpenType font, with
  historical glyphs like long s etc. Swashes would be nice to have. It should work
  well in 8 - 9.5 pt sizes in a 51mm column, but it doesn't have to be ultra-compact.
  I'm trying out Arno Pro, it looks very pretty, but feels a bit, well, italian .

  body: "Well, there's only one typeface that immediately comes to mind: <a href=http://www.felicianotypefoundry.com/main/?page_id=115>Rongel</a>.
    But there are no long s's or swashes, and it's not OpenType. There are swashes
    and OpenType stylings in the similar <a href=http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/itc/itc_galliard_pro_complete_vp/>Galliard</a>,
    but no long s and maybe the problem of a Gallic feel.\r\n\r\nSome other Spanish
    type suggestions in <a href=http://typophile.com/node/47173>this thread</a>."

  body: "I think Stephen is right, but here goes:\r\n\r\nHow about Columbus?\r\n\r\nAccording
    to Monotype:\r\n\"The Columbus font family was designed to celebrate the quincentenary
    of the voyage from Spanish shores by Christopher Columbus. The roman is based
    on types used in Spain by Jorge Coci circa 1513, probably originating from Italy
    and traveling via France. Columbus Italic is derived from a font cut by Robert
    Granjon circa 1543 and used by Bartolom de Najra in 1548 to print a famous manual
    by the writing master Juan de Yciar.\"\r\n\r\nIt's available in a Pro version
    now, see <a href=\"http://www.fonthaus.com/products/fonts/view.cfm/sku/MI-OPP711492.cfm\">here.</a>,
    and you can get a <a href=\"http://www.fontmarketplace.com/font/columbus-family.aspx\">single
    user, non-pro, no extras version</a> from Ascender for 17.99\u2014perfect to give
    it a try.\r\n\r\nIt's fairly strudy, so I think it would work. I don't know about
    the long s, though, and I don't think there are swashes.\r\n\r\nAnd then there's
    Dwiggin's <em>idea</em> of Spanish, Eldorado: the Font Bureau version has a \"micro\"
    and display cuts, but again, I doubt there are any long s's. And, unless Font
    Bureau isn't saying, no OpenType version, pro or otherwise.\r\n\r\nIf swashes,
    the long s, and OpenType pro are more important than Spanish, Garamond Premier
    is awfully nice."
