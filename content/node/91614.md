  body: I can say that such logo design for a Law firm is superb. The theme fits on
    the services that the firm offers. I just want to suggest to add something to
    make it more convincing and more enticing to clients. Let's say you put some services
    for example <a rel="dofollow" href="http://www.integritylegalcorp.com/esi" title="e
    discovery services" style="text-decoration:none; color:#000000;">e discovery services</a>
    on a specific part of the logo. I guess it would be more nicer to look with my
    suggestions.

  body: "The O/T symbol is very small. I know you're trying to be subtle, but if you're
    going to have an iconic symbol that represents the company, make it big enough
    to be clearly seen and remembered, otherwise why have it at all?\r\n\r\nRegarding
    the \"PC\",  offhand I can't remember seeing other logos with it. Seems like something
    more suited to a tag line or footnote, unless there is a legal requirement to
    use it in that manner."

    body: 'Thanks for the comment. About the "PC", there is a legal requirement to
      say the form of the business entity, either abbreviated as I have done, or spelled
      out. Initially, I had the words "Professional Law Corporation" where "Attorneys
      & Counselors at Law" is currently placed. I changed it because I felt the latter
      better demonstrated the roles we hope to take. '

    body: Our practice is limited to employment, immigration, and personal injury.
      One of my earlier drafts listed those practice areas below the name of the firm,
      in place of the "Attorneys & Counselors at Law". The O and T are our initials,
      but can also represent "over time", as in employment wage & hour law (but that
      wasn't my primary intent). The cross is a "plus" symbol, used in place of an
      ampersand, but also represents a simplified chess board. Strategy plays a significant
      portion in the practice of law, especially in employment litigation, so I was
      hoping to allude to that subtly. I experimented with including white or dark
      boxes around the O and T, or around the free squares, but that looked weird
      so I left it.

  body: "Not bad for a non-designer! Normally I -and others here- advise\r\nthat people
    in your position hire a designer* but in this case (noting\r\nthat law firm logos
    arguably benefit from being conservative, which\r\nmeans it's easier to do an
    acceptable job) you might get away with it.\r\nExcept maybe in the final polish
    -for things like proper spacing of the\r\nletterforms (and shapes in general)-
    where you might still require a\r\nprofessional to wrap it up. Also note that
    a logo does not an identity\r\nmake: unless you don't mind being somewhat generic
    with things\r\nlike your letterhead and physical signage, you'll need a professional\r\nto
    render those elements properly.\r\n\r\n* http://typophile.com/node/91610\r\n\r\nOne
    specific change I might recommend trying is to make the letter-\r\nforms in the
    \"O\"-Plus-\"T\" a geometric sans-serif, instead of Warnock.\r\nThat would reinforce
    the nice \"strategy game\" angle, as well as make\r\nthe logo more reproducible
    (those small serifs in the \"T\" can easily get\r\nlost in adverse reproduction
    condition). In fact you're already using a\r\nsans (\"PC\") and could nicely tie
    it all together that way.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    body: "Thank you for the compliments and the advice. I agree that I will need
      to hire a professional designer eventually, but I figured since I have an art
      background, I could make something for the time being. \r\n\r\nI made some changes
      based on the suggestions that you and other made. I have a question about changing
      the \"O\"-Plus-\"T\" to a sans-serif. I am currently using Raleway for the \"PC\".
      However, Raleway is too thin for the \"O\"-Plus-\"T\". Do you recommend changing
      the typeface for the \"PC\" to match the sans-serif use for \"O\"-Plus-\"T\"?
      I ask because I really like the shape of the \"PC\" in Raleway.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OTLogo_6013.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OTLogo3_4298.png]"

  body: "> a logo does not an identity make... things like your letterhead and physical
    signage\r\n\r\nNot only your letterhead, business cards, envelopes and signage,
    but also your business forms, website, print & web advertising (perhaps even direct
    mail), etc.  I agree with hrant that it's not a bad start for a non-designer,
    but you should consider the advantages of having a design professional to assist
    you.\r\n\r\n> About the \"PC\", there is a legal requirement to say the form of
    the business entity\r\n\r\nOK. My main concern is that it might be confusing to
    potential clients who don't understand it or think it is referring to PC computers
    or whatever. You might consider showing it to some folks in the same demographics
    as your customer base and see if the abbreviation causes any confusion.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "So you have three separate entities going on here, is that correct? The O/T,
    the two line block of text, and the PC?\r\n\r\nWell, the problem here is that
    you have three separate entities going on here. And remarkably it studders, lol.
    \r\n\r\nVisually speaking, there is no flow to your 'construction'. Instead it
    seems you are telling the same story - twice! Once via the O/T & PC and again
    via the two line text block. And, if that's not confusing - or entertaining enough
    - you have used two different forms of letter shapes - serif & sans serif!!  And
    of those two the PC visually - in a very awkward fashion - relates to the + sign
    of the O/T and the vertical separation line between the law firm's principal (or
    is it principle?)  names!! And and, you have repeated to use two separate colours!!
    Which relate fully worded text to two off balance letters. And resd those two
    elements - text line 1st and then off balance letters 2nd.\r\n\r\nYou've said
    the same thing twice (in several different forms), and then forced it all together.
    \r\n\r\nAnd if all that is not confusing enough - visual hierarchy - reads the
    two line block of text 1st,  the (my) eye travels right to left and sees the O/T
    2nd, then the eye goes back over the two line block of text 3rd, onto the extreme
    right to visually pick up the PC 4th. \r\n\r\nIs that how others here visually
    see this this 'constructoin'? \r\n\r\nAt least you didn't use any clip art.\r\n\r\nOne
    thing I forgot to mention is the - again to me - the visual connection of the
    orange(?) fully worded text line beginning with the letter A and the off balance
    letter T. In my crazy graphic designer's brain it reads to TATTERONEYS - which
    could be a very profitable side business of law considering the recent articles
    written of  tattoo copyright (who really owns your tattoo design) and the Nokia
    vibrating phone signal tattoo patten pending.\r\n\r\nOr, just TATTERONEY'S, urban
    dictionary attorneys with tattoos? \r\n\r\n:)\r\n\r\n"
