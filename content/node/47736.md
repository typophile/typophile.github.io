body: Just wondering if the bottom margin is meant to be bigger than top generally
  and the right one more than the left on a single pg. They are going to be double
  pg spreads and the right margin will be the one nearer the centre of the pg of a
  double pg spread. Approximately how many mm is the average to work with when it
  comes to margins for an annual?

    when you are working with page spreads, making the outer margins wider then the
    inner margins is practical, as it lets the reader hold the pages at the sides
    while making the content of the facing pages appear as a cohesive unit.\r\n\r\n<a

  body: Haha it's not 42. I'm just asking generally what the average for a corporate
    document like an annual report would be. So I guess that the ones on either side
    are larger but what about top and bottom? The bottom one is larger then I suppose.
    Thanks for the link Lars.

    above for heads, blocks of color, pullquotes and general whitespace and breathing

  body: On a wider point - set up a rock solid grid with columns and a baseline grid
    for type. Play around with this and you can have endless combinations but it will
    give you the structure to work with.
