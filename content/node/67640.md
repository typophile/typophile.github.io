  body: "That time period probably means a film type was used. It's a slab/Egyptian
    style, similar to [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/glypha/|Glypha]], but
    a bit condensed. It's rather hard to find these with middle serifs on the E, and
    that's why I picked Glypha as a similar font.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
