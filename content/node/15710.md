body: "OK here is again the same question you have seen here innumerable times...
  \r\n\r\nDo you have any suggestions for body type?\r\n\r\nMagazine is going to be
  a casual magazine for PC-oriented twenty-something game players with some technology
  and lifestyle articles thrown in. Not too hippy, thick or glamorous. Coated stock,
  48 pages, published fortnightly.\r\n\r\nThere is high probability it is going to
  be a sans serif face.\r\n\r\nMost sans serifs have though problems with legibility
  when used in long articles. They are too geometric: eye does not have enough \"grabbing
  points\". Also they are usually too thin, the color of text is too light.\r\n\r\nI
  have used Formata a lot. It is very readable. I rather used something else in this
  project. Formata is... homely. Almost ugly. But it works well in small sizes.\r\n\r\nI
  like Meta a lot, but it feels too artful for this.\r\n\r\nThings to consider are
  also width of the font, font should be economical, fit a lot of text in small space.\r\nBasically
  there is no need for other styles than regular (or book or medium, depending), italic,
  bold and bold italic. It would be nice if font's family system would not mess up
  InDesign's ability to keep italics and bolds in styles (as happens both Formata
  and Meta).\r\n\r\nOther fonts will be selected to fit body font... but at the moment
  I have Helvetica Compressed in mind for headlines... it may well change.\r\n"

  body: "I just bought Josh Darden's entire Freight family this year. Love it. The
    sans is nice, but you also get the Micro version for small sizes. Don't know if
    the price is 'economical,' but I think the value on this family is extremely high

  body: "I do not think DIN suitable for body text, at least in longer texts. Freight
    looks nice though price is high. It is though quite geometric and thus not very
    legible. Micro version is of course different.\r\n\r\nAt the moment I am trying
    Myriad Pro SemiCond, also Linotype's Finnegan looks right. Quest goes on..."
