  body: I think that you might be wrong about Actium, Dr. Type. Actium seems more
    interesting than most new sans serifs I can think of that came out in 2010. 2009
    had some interesting new sanses, but 2010? We've had a couple of gems already,
    but not as many as in previous years, and definitely not too many! I think that
    Actium is ready to steamroll to success on the MyFonts charts.

    five brilliant inspirations and mashed them up into a single, all wonderful thing
    in its own.\r\n\r\nI think I'd just like to see a respective italic which could
    be a tiny little bit more serious. It looks great, I just don't see it as a great
    pair to the roman. It looks to me a bit \u201Ccartoony\u201D in the bolder weights
    (looks close to perfect up until \u201CMedium\u201D).\r\nOh, and the \u201Cfi\u201D

    the space between those two letters. But I agree with you, 1996type: at text sizes
    these things will not only not be noticeable, but can, in fact, become helpful.\r\n\r\nAnd
    I do understand that the fact that the bolder italics could be seen as a mismatch
    is precisely why you would like them, Nick. I like them too, but I think they
    wouldn't work easily and seamlessly combined with the roman in running text. But
    these weights probably won't be used for long stretches of text, either, so this
    won't really happen that much, I guess.\r\n\r\nBut like I said, I really like
    the whole thing a lot, and I'm putting it up there with all the inspirations I
    saw in it, all of which I love dearly. This immediately became one of my favourites.
    And that's precisely why I felt I needed to jump in and say something.\r\nI thoroughly
    appreciate all the idiosyncrasies; many times they're precisely what turns nice

  body: "Thanks again for all the kind of words. That. Means. A. Lot.\r\n\r\nAbout
    the italics... I can say that much effort is put in getting the italic its colour
    equal with the roman (which actually isn't the usual case for italics supporting
    a roman). Wasn't easy, as the italic has a higher and more flexible contrast than
    its roman counterpart, but they do match and combine perfectly. I can add to this
    that also its width is somewhat a bit non-conservative. As italics usually are
    significantly more condensed than their roman counterparts \u2014 so it's not
    with Actium. Because of a personal preference and, again, for the purpose to let
    them fit better when used together, they're very close in sharing these proportions.
    So the italic doesn't jump out of text due to its narrowness or colour, but just
    by its very own form!\r\n\r\nAlso, the italic was (obviously) designed to automatically
    avoid letters clashing into their neighbours by replacing these combinations with
    alternates or ligatures. For instance, there's an extra 'j' which has a much straighter
    descender; this alternate version of the 'j' will be used if it follows another
    character that has descending elements that cause problematic situations. The
    additional advantage of this approach (using alternates above ligatures) is that
    it would have less affect on text setting than ligatures if end users tighten
    the white space by tracking text. The ligatures in the end, like 'fi', of course
    have been double checked to see how they perform; shape-wise as well as fitting.
    \r\n\r\nI hope this takes away the worries some have with Actium's italic.\r\n\r\nMore

    all the time, Nick\u2026 I know I'd surely use them too, all the time, on lots
    of words, but that just becomes a bit disrespectful\u2026 yes, these are judgement
    calls, but they exist and we need to live with them, even when we're aware of
    their subjectivity.\r\n\r\nI just meant that I thought the roman bolder weights
    didn't pair up with the respective italics as well as what I was seeing in the
    lighter weights, which is, I believe, at least to some extent, true. I thought
    the roman has a certain air to it and the italic has another altogether different
    air, which could clash with the previous in some applications. But as I said,
    we probably wouldn't use them together all that much, anyhow. And in display applications,
    as ultrasparky mentioned, this will \u2013 of course \u2013 not only work, but
    be a welcomed addition to a typographic swiss-army knife. Yes, a designer can
    make or break the typeface he's using, but there's no denying that typefaces have
    a life of their own.\r\n\r\nMaybe I need to be more specific.\r\nI don't know,
    I was getting a kind of \u201Ccontemporary, cool-and-collected, clean and still
    humanistic and lively\u201D vibe from the roman, and this is true also in the
    lighter italics; and then I was getting something like \u201Ccomic book chic\u201D
    from the bolder italics. [I'm not getting samples from Actium at MyFonts, right
    now\u2026 don't know why. This is from memory.]\r\n\r\nThat's fine, I have no
    problem with that! But I was thinking the bolder italics had so much in them that
    they stood almost as a different typeface, and that would warrant them their own
    name; and in the same way, maybe this family deserved a (let's say) \u201Cmuter\u201D
    bolder italic. It's funny you should mention Gill Kayo!\r\n\r\nBut, you know\u2026
    splitting hairs. It's what we do. No harm intended.\r\nAgain, I must stress that
    I really like Actium a lot. I didn't mean to offend, quite on the contrary.\r\n\r\nAnd
    Gerben: I do appreciate the difficulties of making a typeface \u2013 well, somehow,
    at least \u2013 (I've tried and failed!), and I share with you this idea that
    maybe a matching italic should have similar proportions to the roman. I, too,
    feel kind of sorry when I see a wonderful roman paired up in running text with
    a too-compressed \u2013 even if wonderful on its own \u2013 italic. I completely
    commend your efforts in this regard. But I still thought that, at times, this
    didn't translate in the finest possible way with regards to the spacing of the
    italics (i.e., what I mentioned with the fi ligatures being too spaced out in
    the bolder weights and the \u201Crv\u201D spacing/kerning or lack thereof); and
    this type family merits perfection, I believe.\r\n\r\nBut of course \u2013 and
    I really don't need to tell you this, but I will, nonetheless \u2013, I am in
    no way an expert. I might be completely wrong and my opinion is worth only whatever
    you think it should."
