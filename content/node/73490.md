  wanted to ask if anyone knows if something of interest - typography-wise - is currently
  going on there? \r\n\r\nExhibitions, showrooms, or something nice like that? I am
  not a designer so professional events would be out of my league, but someting else
  than the MoMa would be nice for a change.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!\r\n/g"

    could always call for an appointment at Oaklander books and take a look at their
    typographic collection. Maybe even buy something.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.manta.com/c/mmzl6ks/oaklander-books"
