body: "This is the logotype used for Bauwelt magazine in the 60s. It is very similar
  to FF Bau, or Schelter & Giesecke's Grotesk in it's pre digitized life. It is more
  extended than any version of those two typefaces that I know of and has some small
  differences, mainly in the 'a'. Perhaps this was custom drawn for the magazine.
  Does anybody know anything about it, or anything about Bauwelt magazine from that
  period?\r\n\r\nThank you"

  body: Thank you. Do you know any more information about SB venus? On the myfonts
    website it says the design owner is Bauer Types and the designer is Robert Wiebking.
    But I can't find any other references to Robert Wiebking designing a typeface
    called Venus. Perhaps this is a digitization of a typeface originally design Wiebking
    but called something else? The difference in the lowercase a leads me to believe
    so. In my original image the bowl of the a sticks out of the stem, whereas with
    Venus it curves out a la Helvetica.

  body: AFIK, the typeface's original name was Venus Extended, or Venus Bold Extended;
    beyond that, I got squat...

  body: Venus is in the Phil's Photo catalogue of photo-lettering type and in Letraset
    catalogues of rub-down type, so it isn't just the name for Scangraphic's digitization.
    They might be able to give you some more information.

  body: Hi thanks. Yes I'm coming across more information myself. There is another
    digitisation here <a href="http://www.hypefortype.com/?page=22&ID=176">Hype for
    Type</a> and Venus also appears in this book <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=eTJ8khmZie0C&pg=PR23&lpg=PR23&dq=Venus+Extended+typeface&source=bl&ots=g5Jn_UOwBW&sig=UXaFxK4hgcNTg4PaoaX-n58zu2Q&hl=en&ei=NGbITLLmEYKTswbz4sCRDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CBwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q&f=false">'The
    Type Specimen Book'</a>. It was also used in the title sequence for Pyscho.
