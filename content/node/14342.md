body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI need a font converted from .pfb to .ttf so that I can use it
  on a website with php, the server doesn't support .pfb fonts but it does support
  .ttf fonts.  I know that this can be done with TypeTool2, but I can't justify spending
  $100 on it just to convert this font.  I tried the demo and it's simply open the
  .pfb and save as .ttf, but the demo only does 20 glyphs and half of them have the
  fontlab logo in them, so it's needs to be done with the full version.\r\n\r\nIs
  there anybody willing to help me out?  I'll paypal $10 for it if that's any incentive.\r\n\r\nThanks,"

  body: if it's just one font, just license the [[TrueType]] version of the font.
    most single fonts are between $19-$39 -- a good deal less than paying for [[typetool]].

    bugs me to buy it again, but if that's the only way then I will.  I was hoping
    to just pay $10 and have someone create the .ttf for me, but if nobody's willing
    then I'll have no choice but to buy the ttf version.\r\n\r\nThanks."

    robust than a quick hack-job.\r\n2) Some EULAs forbid such conversions.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: FearX, you could also try speaking directly with the foundry from whom you
    licensed the typeface. They might be willing to work with you, perhaps even giving
    you the format. Although, on the other hand, their EULA might dis-allow embedding
    in which case you might be biting your foot. Hmm. Better read the EULA. If embedding
    isn't mentioned then I would really suggest calling them.

  body: Thanks guys, actually I just decided to use a different font, I had one similar
    in TTF and the client approved it, so no worries.
