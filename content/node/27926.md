    body: Vendome is truly Paris in the Fifties, if that's the look. All the postwar
      French book classics used Vendome for their title heads, mainly because it was
      one of the few available. But if it's earlier and more classic in feel, try
      one of the Didots (such as Hoefler's) for larger heads, and maybe FF Acanthus
      with old style figures for the body copy. I just went to New York's Dahesh Museum
      for a show of large French art books created as a result of Napoleon's abortive
      campaign in Egypt, and published around 1808, and their large heads used a beautiful
      Didot, and for the body copy, the nearest equivalent now would be either Acanthus
      or ITC Bodoni Twelve. Just depends on the period feel being targeted.

    body: No photo-taking was allowed, Miss Tiffany, but maybe the Dahesh Museum would
      send you a JPEG or two of the book inside pages. One text font, roughly equivalent
      to Acanthus today, was fascinating, esp the tiny crossbar in the middle of the
      lower case l character (as in love), which was printed clear as a bell...at
      the Morgan Library recently, I saw another big French art book around that period,
      an edition of Racine, with a big rendering of that same text font, impeccably
      printed...
