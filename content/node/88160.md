body: I have a copy of the Archer font in book, bold, italic, and bold italic, with
  which I'm trying to create a linked font set. (So that, for example, I can get the
  bold variant when I bold the type, as opposed to having to select a different font
  from a drop-down menu). But no matter how I alter the internal font family names
  (and I've tried every combination I can think of), I can't get the family to link
  correctly (for instance, everything will appear as bold, or I'll lose italic). I'm
  more or less out of ideas, and I'm hoping someone might be able to offer a hand,
  or perhaps some suggestions. Thanks in advance for any help.
