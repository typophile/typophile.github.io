body: "Hello, could anyone please tell me what the three typefaces (or one of them)
  on the attached book cover are? Is a Yves Klein catalogue from the 1950s. Many thanks
  in advance.\r\n\r\nI have added a new image which has more of the Sans Serif, there
  seems to be two different cuts of A and E being used."

  body: YVES is Cheltenham, although a quick search didn't yield a digital version

  body: PEINTURES is similar to Walbaum, but I don't see a digital version with the
    severe "underbite" of the E or the curly foot of the leg of the R.

    main differences being the strange /E of PREFACE and the /S"

  body: Interesting, I wasn't aware of Sorbonne, which is a better match. It's clearly
    derived from Cheltenham, though.
