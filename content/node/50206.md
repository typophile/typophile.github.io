  to intern with one of India's best  graphic designer, Mahindra Bhai Patel in Bombay.
  He had conducted a workshop where he had taught her (and the rest of the group)
  something called the LCM grid. From what i can gather, its one that requires quite
  a bit of mathematical calculation but works on the LCM of the page size rather than
  the Golden ratio. \r\n\r\nThats all i could \"extract\" from my friend and its going
  to be a while till i meet mr Patel once again...\r\n\r\nSoooo, does anyone know
  what this LCM grid is all about?\r\n"

    have never seen that theory applied to a grid, tho, interesting, please post your
    findings."

  body: "Hy Arjun, first of all its really good to hear Patel Sir's name here, he
    is really a great mentor, fortunately i got a chance to work on some projects
    with him. \r\n\r\nWell LCM grid is a technique to find out no. of columns and
    their optimum width suitable for a particular page size, so you get the consistent
    divisons and there wont be any extra space left after drawing columns.\r\n\r\n
    The most commonly used LCM is 12, because its a divisible for both even and odd,
    so you get a flexibility of working with 2,3 and 4 column chunks. \r\n\r\nPreviously
    designers had to use a formula for manually calculating the column widths accordingly
    to desired LCM, but now with InDesign you can directly define it easily.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/12-LCM-Grid_5114.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\nSee
    the image, above its a 12 column LCM grid, might make clear."

  body: I see what you mean with "LCM grid," thank you, Nitin, that makes sense, it
    is also intuitive.
