  body: 'You''re right Kevin that''s probably why I assumed from the beginning it
    could have been started from a Sans (and not a Serif). ''Virgin Daisies'' and
    ''Wide & Narrow'' are from Thailand, maybe the customization was based on the
    latin counter-part of some font for the Thai language... '
