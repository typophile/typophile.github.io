  called <em>Cadence & Slang</em>. It's about interaction design, and will be out
  in late 2010.\r\n\r\nI'm funding it with Kickstarter, <a href=\"http://nickd.org/x/cadence\">and
  I need your support</a>. If you're any more curious, check out <a href=\"http://cadence.cc\">the
  book's site</a> or <a href=\"mailto:nickd@nickd.org\">drop me a line</a>.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
