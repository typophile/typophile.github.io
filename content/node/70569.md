body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Volodja1_5242.png]\r\n\r\nVolodja is my
  first take on a serif face. Initially it started as a learning project, but now
  i intend to turn it into something, somebody can use.^^ \r\n\r\nSo far i've drawn
  the latin alphabet, basic punctuation, some composites and numerals.  \r\nKerning
  is rather incomplete (spacing may be too).\r\n\r\nThe attached .pdf features three
  weights (two masters and one fontlab-generated instance) \u2013 but no italics yet.
  \r\n\r\nPlease tell me what you think. \r\nAny critique appreciated.\r\nTIA for
  your time."

  body: "Some suggestions:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>/E/'s middle stroke could be a bit shorter.</li>\r\n<li>The
    little notch under /d/'s serif is ... special. I like it as a \"feature\", but
    people could interpret it as a \"bug\", especially because it doesn't seem to
    be present anywhere else (correct me if I'm wrong). It probably doesn't show up
    in print anyway.</li>\r\n<li>If there's any stress at all in, for example, /p/,
    it looks like it's in the wrong direction. I may see this incorrectly though.</li>\r\n<li>/R/
    looks like it has eaten too much. If you make the bowl a little smaller than that
    of /P/, and give it a little sturdier and angled leg, it will feel much more comfortable.</li>\r\n<li>The
    tip of /t/ has character, yes, but maybe it's a tad too much.</li>\r\n<li>Some
    inconsistencies in width, especially in the uppercase letters: /S/ seems slightly
    obese, /R/ is very lean.</li>\r\n<li>The angles of your /M/'s strokes seems a
    bit imbalanced to me. Optically and/or mathematically, I don't know. My fonts
    are always guilty of that, too ...</li>\r\n<li>I absolutely <em>love</em> your
    /a/! Especially next to the /j/ in \"Volodja\". Unfortunately, it looks a little
    introverted when next to /c/, /l/ or /n/. Pull the top down a tiny bit.</li>\r\n<li>Both
    /K/ and /k/ could use some polishing. The way the leg holds up the arm is nice,
    but you've gone to the point where it's a crutch.</li>\r\n<li>The terminals of
    /s/ (and probably /r/, and /c/), don't have to be pointing that far inwards. The
    bottom one of /s/ could also be slightly shorter.</li>\r\n<li>Experiment some
    more with your /g/. There are some great threads in these forums about different
    shapes of /g/. Look them up.</li>\r\n<li>Look at the descender of /y/ also. The
    serif is a little bit odd (I can't really make out what it is)</li>\r\n<li>You
    can usually make the counters of /m/ a little smaller than those of /n/, to make
    the two distinguishable and to even out the fact that /m/ has more white anyway.</li>\r\n<li>Spacing
    and kerning, but you know that already.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nI'm not even halfway
    done drafting my one first font, so take my advice with a grain of salt. One main
    issue (esp. as you want it to be a serif) is definitely the lack of clear contrast.
    There is some, in some places, but it's not really obvious to me what concept
    you had in mind when it came to stroke width.\r\n\r\nStill, I think this could
    be totally usable once you iron out all the little wrinkles. Keep going! :)\r\n\r\nSeb\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    stress and put weight on either the horizontals or the strokes that meet them.\r\n\r\nTo
    my eye, D, P, R could stand to be wider.\r\n\r\nSomething very subtle is putting
    me off the regular-weight e. Other weights of the same glyph are okay. Go over
    its curves, I guess."
