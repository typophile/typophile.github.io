  brief description/confirmation of the what kind it is (i.e., bold, condensed) or
  any helpful corollaries between these and other fonts I might recognize (i.e. this
  is the TNR equivalent), and any helpful usage info/tips.\r\n\r\nSo far, what (I
  think) I've figured out is in brackets, plus I'm guessing R=Regular and L=Light.
  Just for reference I've attached text samples with each text.\r\n\r\n[Background]
  I'm designing an ad for a free Chinese magazine here in LA called \"World Weekly\"
  for my company. The problem is, I can't read Chinese at all, although I can figure
  out some things through my knowledge of Japanese. Probably, no one (that pays me)
  will care if I use the right fonts. But I've seen shoddy cross-cultural marketing,
  and one of the things that blares \"WE DON'T SPEAK YOUR LANGUAGE\" is the odd choice/misuse
  of fonts. So, I would like to avoid that, and any help would be appreciated! Unfortunately,
  I don't have the scads of time to do the research - just hopefully get some quick
  advice or any resources that might help. Thanks!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Chinese-fonts_4426.jpg]"

  body: "Also... I'm using Illustrator and it doesn't seem to understand that I want
    to use Chinese fonts, not Japanese ones. Even though I select the text and change
    it, it won't remain whichever Chinese font I've selected - it either switches
    back to Kozuka Gothic (a Japanese font) or is blank (in which case I go into the
    text, and it's usually Kozuka Gothic).\r\n\r\nWhich is problematic, not the least
    of the problems being the X'ed rectangles that appear (the placeholder boxes when
    there is no matching character in the set)."

  body: "In Chinese type, \u7D30 means \"Light\", not condensed.\r\n\r\nWhile many
    Japanese <em>kanji</em> are in fact Chinese characters (\u6F22\u5B57), quite a
    few are simplified forms unique to Japanese.  Select one of these and AI's glyph
    palette can give you the \"alternate\" Chinese form -- click the little black
    triangle in the lower right corner.  Once you've re-encoded the character in the
    Chinese form, a Chinese font should work.  This feature is a good reason for using
    Adobe's Opentype fonts.\r\n\r\nBut beginning in the late 1950s the People's Republic
    provided simplified versions of traditional characters, only some of which look
    like the Japanese simplifications.  Some can be found in Adobe Ming, but for simplified
    characters you're better off with Adobe Song.  Some audiences care a great deal
    about traditional Chinese vs. simplified.\r\n\r\nMing/Song styles are generally
    a safe bet.  Fangsong \u4EFF\u5B8B (less common for Japanese) and Kai \u6977 are
    more calligraphic; \"gothic\" \u9ED1\u9AD4 styles are also useful.  Which you
    choose is, well, a matter of style.\r\n\r\nGood luck,\r\nDavid"

  body: "In my opinion, the most important decision that faces you is whether you
    need a Simplified Chinese or Traditional Chinese font. This has nothing to do
    with the number of glyphs in the font, but rather is a region-specific shape issue.
    For a large number of characters, the same glyphs can be used, but for a significant
    number of characters, distinct glyphs are necessary. Some of these differences
    are reflected as separate Unicode code poins, but some have been unified, meaning
    the same Unicode code point can accommodate both forms, but most fonts include
    only one of them. (A so-called Pan-Chinese font would include glyphs suitable
    for both Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese, and the only such fonts of
    which I am aware are two weights of STHeiti on Mac OS X 10.6 that are implemented
    as TTCs.)\r\n\r\nAnyway, if you let us know the target audience, which would indicate
    whether Simplified Chinese or Traditional Chinese would be appropriate, I can
    make some suggestions.\r\n\r\nDr. Ken Lunde\r\nSenior Computer Scientist, CJKV

  body: "Ken, David, thanks for your advice. I ended up using Adobe \u5B8B\u4F53 Std
    L for body, and Adobe \u9ED1\u4F53 Std R for headlines. I was told to use the
    Taiwanese Chinese language setting, and there was an editor that checked the final
    outcome of the text - so it seems that everything went well. (At least, I haven't
    heard any complaints). \r\n\r\n<cite>In Chinese type, \u7D30 means \u201CLight\u201D,
    not condensed.</cite>\r\nThat makes sense! I was confused, since it didn't seem
    condensed at all."

  body: "AdobeSongStd-Light (Adobe \u5B8B\u4F53 Std L) and AdobeHeitiStd-Regular (Adobe
    \u9ED1\u4F53 Std R) are Simplified Chinese fonts that are intended to be used
    for China, not Taiwan. While a significant number of glyphs are entirely appropriate
    for use in Taiwan, some are different, and sometimes in subtle ways. A not-so-subtle
    example is the ideograph \u9AA8 and any ideograph that uses this as a component.
    Try rendering it using different Chinese fonts, Simplified and Traditional, and
    you'll see mirroring of the top portion.\r\n\r\nWhat I am trying to say is that
    you need to be prepared for some complaints, and chances are they will be about
    this very issue.\r\n\r\nIn terms of using those fonts for body text and headlines,
    they are otherwise good choices, ignoring the Simplified versus Traditional issue.
