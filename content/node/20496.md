  font myself. I've already got my selection narrowed down to the glyphs A, H, K &
  7 and was wondering if anyone could send me an Illustrator-file with these glyphs
  in outline.\r\n\r\naspronaut@hotmail.com\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: Great idea (even crossed my mind aswell), but as an Illustrator hobbyist with
    an ordinary dtp-job, I don't really have a whole lot of money to spend on commercial
    fonts. So if I can get the few glyphs I need I'd be a happy camper (with a nice
    tattoo ;-) ).

  body: Doubt he'll do it for free, so if I could save some money on the font I can
    get a bigger tattoo ;-)
