    this one. Where did you get this image?

  body: "Not exactly a logo, it's a seal/coat of arms. It seems to consist of at least
    four themes, which could represent families or cities.\r\nI'm no expert on heraldry,
    so can't really help you there. \r\nWhere is it from? Country of origin might
    help those who know more.\r\n\r\n[edit] Ah, Miss T. got there before me!"

  body: This is probably a specific families coat of arms. If you knew where the photo
    was taken that would be a good clue. It might also be good to know if it is your
    client's family's coat of arms. If it is a families coat of arms chances are that
    you are going to have to draw it. You'd save time by just re-drawing it yourself.

  body: "The picture is an ornamental keystone. It marks the apax at the crown of
    a vault or arch (I don't dare to say which). A keystone locks the other pieces
    of a vault or arch into position.\r\n\r\nThis is one coat of arms (one family).
    The shield is made out of two 'important' families (the red and white) because
    of a marriage between the two (red and white) creating one family thus one shield
    (one coat of arms).\r\n\r\nIf the vector art is going to be in black and white
    there are rules how to represent the colors (the color silver is a doted pattern
    etc.). You can look it up in a book or ask your local genealogy society (you can
    ask your local city/village museum if there are any or at city hall).\r\n\r\nThe
    helm and mantling are also significant, but I can't recall why.\r\n\r\nBest of
    luck."

  body: I think It's an italian coat of arms. It's also related to Venice. That lion
    at the bottom is the protector of the city.

    tells me that's not the only association.\r\n\r\nThat lion needs some work. I
    just watched the South Park episode with Mr. Garrison and the mouse and the genetic
    experiment escape. I'm having flashbacks."
