body: 'After many years in school and in the professional world, I have "collected"
  a ton of fonts. So I''ve decided to do some house cleaning. I''ve deleted about
  75 fonts already. Part of me would really like to rebuild my type library from scratch,
  keeping only the obvious ones: Garamond, Univers, Bodoni, Clarendon, etc... you
  know, the "standards." A font starter kit if you will. I came to this realization
  after spending way too much time clicking through suitcase looking for that perfect
  typeface: Arial (no), Beachhouse (never), Catfish Script Pro (what the hell does
  "pro" mean anyway? Is there a Catfish Amateur out there with dreams if making it
  to the big leagues?), and on and on and on. So...Hi, my name is Andy, and I''ve
  become out of touch with fonts. I need help rebuilding my type library with the
  classics and some soon to be classics. Does anyone else know what I mean or am I
  just getting old?'

    ones like Arial is that people send me stuff in Arial all the time and I wouldn't
    be able to see it correctly if I deleted it. Granted, I prefer it to comic sans,
    but wouldn't it be nice if it could just disappear for a while (forever)."

  body: "I think your goal is admirable, but I would caution you not to actually delete
    the fonts you don't want to use, in case you find someday you actually do need
    them. I'd recommend a font manager, such as Linotype's free <a href=http://www.linotype.com/fontexplorerX>Font
    Explorer</a> or <a href=http://www.extensis.com/en/products/font_management/index.jsp;jsessionid=RCMXCP3OUNLCVLAQAAUARSQ>Extensis
    Suitcase</a>, so that you can just activate and make use of the fonts you want.\r\n\r\nAnd
    I wouldn't get rid of what I assume is actually <em>Caflisch</em> Script Pro;
    I happen to like it. The Pro means that it is one of Adobe's OpenType fonts with
    extra features, which in this case I believe means contextual alternates to make
    it flow better."

  body: "Oh no, I'm not deleting Arial, nor Helvetica or Times. I'm just getting rid
    of fonts that I've had lingering on my mac for years and years, fonts that I know
    I will never use (to be truthful, I'm moving those fonts to an external hard drive
    \"just in case\"). My thinking is more of a simplistic one: do I really need nine
    different versions of Futura? My goal is to have a few typefaces from the different
    periods in type history; then once I understand the language of that history,
    to build from there. \r\n\r\nAt the same time, I've been looking at a lot of new
    fonts and printing off spec sheets.\r\n\r\nI do have the fonts you mentioned.
    They are not part of my FRP (Font Relocation Program)."
