body: "G'day guys,\r\n\r\nCouple of questions:\r\n\r\n1. Does anyone have experience
  in licensing fonts for embedding in academic journals available in PDFs? Do you
  think the copyright revenue that publishers get counts the publication towards being
  a commercial product?\r\n\r\nAlso\r\n\r\n2. One of the fonts is (the ever glamorous)
  Palatino. This is the font info:\r\n\r\nCopyright \xA9 1991-99, 2006 Apple Computer,
  Inc. Copyright \xA9 1991-92 Type Solutions, Inc. All rights reserved. Trademark
  Palatino is a registered trademark of Linotype AG.\r\n\r\nWho do I contact for licensing?
  Apple, TSI (Bitstream) or Monotype/Linotype?\r\n\r\nAs with a lot of my fonts, I
  have no documentation letting me know where or when they came from in the first
  place, I just have to guess. In the future I'm aiming to only use foundries that
  have no restrictions on embedding,\r\nthanks guys, you've been helpful in the past
  I hope you can help now.\r\n\r\n--N"
