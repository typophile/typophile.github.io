Also, the "E" on smaller sizes looks inverted.

		<div class="commentbody">x-height of OSF looks better. Maybe the extenders of three, five, six, eight, and nine should be brought in too. I love the height of your lining figures.

The joining of O and E in /OE/ looks wooden (compare /d/).

I think many of your diagonal vertices look like they're pulling apart; the counter gets too close to the outer contour at the acute angles. I see this in /A/V/W/AE/v/w/.

Very diagonal shears on two and three might be a bit out of character.

/K/'s arm looks a little thin to me.

The subtle pulling back of the stem near the joins (as in the top right of one-story /g/ or top left of /n/ is quite nice.

Could /D/ stand to be a little wider?

Ampersand looks very "loose" for this font, is that purposeful?</div>

Seems logical, but I think the reason you shouldn't is they look too long! :-)
Here's a shot of Myriad Pro's OSFs.
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture_3975.gif]
I'm not saying you have to copy those forms, but that may give you "permission" to establish different ascender/descender lines for the figures.
Set them among some lowercase text and let your eye be your guide.

<em>Diagonal vertices</em>

Your V looks like a \/, W like a \/\/ :-)

<em>Loose?</em>

It looks like a spaghetti noodle that has been cooked very long, while the rest of the font is "[[http://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_dente|al dente]]" :-)</div>

Look at the smaller ones on your first pdf, on the left side, the black word Equity it's more noticeable. As for the ampersand, it's too curvy compared to other letters which are more straight, it flows too much even compared to other curved letters. Also, why the option for a different a? I believe it changes considerably the face of the entire set.
Hope it helps out some.</div>

  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/SnapShot_4762.png]

Here, I would begin the outside tapering of the stem earlier, and make the inside less curved. 

OS numerals are great, but I think they have too tall ascenders and deep descenders. 

I'd say the "r" is still a little timid.

Colour looks very good.

B is lovely.
C might be a bit wide. And F.
J has a bumpy curve.
Tail of Q could be a bit longer?
Leg of R meets the waist a bit too far out — I think you could bring it in a notch.
X could do with the uphill stroke offset a bit. 
N, Z, 6 and 9 look wide to me.

Lowercase:
f could benefit from a wider hood.
Two storey g is great.
Single storey g could need the tail to be longer; the bowl looks wide in comparison.
k looks a bit wide.
l has some problem with hinting on my screen:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/l-problem_5339.gif]
m and n are really good.
q looks wider than p, perhaps.

I agree the oldstyle figs look a bit too tall. I'd make the tail of comma heavier.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">That ampersand is much better I think. Perhaps it closes up a bit much given how open the apertures of letters like C and S are in this font. Likewise perhaps the question marks close up too much.
I like your comma!
The small caps are very appealing, too (though the /W/ may be too wide).
Something looks a little funky with the asymmetrical trapping on /x/.

I redrew all the diagonal shapes. Think I might be on the right track with those. New chunkier quotation marks and a slightly less funky ampersand.

so much white space, only a fraction though as I can
see that this gives the character charm.

There are much later bloomers than you, you know. Unlike mathematics and pop music, type design it not for the young and naïve.

		<div class="commentbody">I am cutting the terminal of a lowercase 'a' in the same fashion.

My logic for designing this way was cutting after the extreme of the curve as opposed to before, and depending on the character and orientation of the curve I didn't feel I needed to cut each terminal at the same point or also, importantly, in the same direction. I know that sounds really inconsistent but it generates four possible endings as opposed to one. Two possible terminals (before and after the extreme of a curve) makes complete sense to me.

I'm not really ready to show my drawing, but I hope you understand what I mean. If not I will try to illustrate what I mean. To apply my description to Frode's type sample the terminal in 2 is cut after the curve has reached it's extreme but 6 is cut before. The terminal of the 2 is also cut at an angle, the 6 is not. Two variables, each employed at once. To make it more logical as Tomi puts it might be to vary only one of these options.

Sorry that was such a mouthful, I'm not very well, and a bit nervous about contributing.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Not a full crit but a few notes:
I quite like the simple /Q/ in the regular and bold, but maybe something a little more cursive might fit better in the italic.
There's a bit of weight balancing to do in the bold face; just as a couple of examples /a/ looks quite a bit too dark to my eye, and /y/ too.
In the bold weight both /3/s look like they stick their middle bit out too far to the left.
