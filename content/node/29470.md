  (compared to Office 2007 and Adobe Reader 7). I had to generate the PDF at a small
  paper size (here 4 x 6) because the 11pt type was too small at A4. Device does not

  original in Word. \r\n\r\nOne other quirk, spotted by Sergey, (maybe specific to
  Word generated PDFs?) is that PDF pages that use fake bolds take a long time to
  render on the device. That will teach people for using fake bold! An electric shock
  would be good too.\r\n"

    speculating about the type. To me I can understand subtle spacing issues (I've
    seen worse) but the lack of true italics (and maybe true bold) is just bizarre
    - seeing as Bitstream has them. I can't believe no-one else identified this as
    a problem that needed to be fixed in the past six months.    "

      the tradition of doing script-based italics is just, well, unnecessary in many
      cases. \r\n\r\nOf course, for the sake of the designers who have to stare at

    laziness of action, then there's laziness of spirit. Speedily making something
    that's both ideologically and practically sound doesn't have to be the former,
    and spending time making yet another overly-cursive italic can often be the latter.\r\n\r\nThat
    said, I agree that \"nobody will notice\" isn't a good enough argument, especially
    since reading is essentially subconscious. But when you couple it with \"we shouldn't
    be doing it anyway\" then it gets pretty convincing!\r\n\r\nEssentially, my own
    argument here involves a rejection of the conventional \"italics must be more
    cursive\" dogma, something that even leads to people making so-called \"upright
    italics\" and thinking they can get away with <cite>that</cite>.\r\n\r\n> But

    It would be interesting here to check for any negative reader reactions around
    the turn of the 20th century, when ATF was churning out mechanically-slanted Romans

  body: "I played around with the Sony reader over the last weekend. It's interesting,
    but definitely not ready for anyone who doesn't buy $250+ gadgets for the hell
    of it.\r\n\r\nThe screen redraw is extremely irritating. It's not the second it
    takes that's the real problem, it's the jarring experience of the screen flashing
    black and two pages of type overlaying each other and then settling on the new
    one. Also irritating is the interface; there are too many buttons and the layout
    makes little, if any, sense. It needs a manual page attached to the inside of
    the screen cover, like the little character drawing guides included with Palm
    OS devices. \r\n\r\nRegarding type rendering the reader is a winner. Characters
    are rendered crisply and pages are very easy on the eyes. Layouts, however, are
    gross. Poorly-placed page breaks, widows, and orphans abound. It's not just bad
    in the sense a designer will understand, this thing churns out lines that look
    like early drafts of high-school term papers. The only book on the model I tested
    was <em>The Da Vinci Code</em>, and the reader managed to make Dan Brown's deplorable
    prose even worse. This could be dealt with by just setting standards for books
    sold via the official store, or even a firmware update that sets some simple rules
    for displaying text on-screen, but Sony isn't the sort of company that will make
    it happen.\r\n\r\nThe problems with the Sony reader make me expect it to flop
    just like the old LCD ebook readers did. It could have a future if it sold for
    less, and if books were sold at a massive discount to make up for having to read
    them in this dreadful state. But that not being the case, I cannot see why any
    serious reader would buy the Sony reader. "

    for reading normal sized (A4-like) pdf's on relative small (Sony Reader PRS500/PRS505,
    iRex Illiad etc.) devices.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that pdf is not reformatable
    by nature. Yes, there is reflow mode in Acrobat Reader, but at first Acrobat Reader
    is not available for most e-book readers (especially for e-ink devices),\r\nand
    second even with reflow function reading of complex content (technical books,
    magazines etc.) is not comfortable. Bad formatted pdf's and wide white spaces
    make the situation even worse.\r\n\r\nThe only way how this problem can be solved
    (at least based on my experience) to cut original pages into smaller pages with
    removing white spaces.\r\nThis is exactly what program do. But comparing with
    similar software PDFCropper is much more flexible, that allows to prepare books
    with much better quality in a very short time.\r\n\r\nCurrently PDFCropper can
    produce text and image pdf's. Later additional output formats (lrf, lrs, wolf
