<div class=commentbody>My question is: shouldn't we be a bit more curious about other typefaces?
I'm quite a bit tired - personally - to see so much stuff (and now a film) made on the most generic typeface of all times. I understand of course it's importance in the context of the modernist movement and that it's a well crafted piece of design.
Shouldn't we be over this font, especially when we can all agree of it's very limited use in contemporary typography? (no italics, small caps, old style figures, ... and not very good for signage and very poor for reading enjoyment, ...)?
Do we, subconsciously, long for the “generic/inexpressive“ in design?</div>

<div class=commentbody><strong>I don't think it's <em>subconscious</em>. A designer must choose, and sometimes he/she probably feels an expressive/alluding type face steals the focus. I'm no fan of Helvetica, but I see a point in using it <em>because</em> it has been so overexposed it's as if it's considered entirely featureless, which it's not.</strong>

<div class=commentbody>We should indeed be curious about other typefaces. The problem is, are they all film material? Do they have the recognition and broad exposure to make film the medium of choice or is a book or magazine or Journal article the best place to portray type?
We type lovers would all rush out to see any film about type (since there have been SO many) but the cost and time to make a film means you have to find a broader audience. You can argue the case for a few other typefaces as well but Helvetica is certainly on the list for either the love or hate kinds of interest which would entice film viewing.

<div class=commentbody>The notoriety of Helvetica within the design community is as much a reason for the documentary as the type's ubiquity. That provides a modicum of drama: talking head vs. talking head. Because from what I've seen of the doc so far, it's unlikely to be as unequivocal as, say, An Inconvenient Truth.
As Erik mentioned on another thread, Miedinger was more art director than designer--right up there with Morison, "excogitator" (his own term) of Times Roman.</div>

<div class=commentbody>>Miedinger was more art director than designer
Well, Edouard Hoffmann was more like Neue Haas Grotesk's art director. This doesn't negate that Miedinger was more art director than designer, too. But designers keep tending to want to give Miedinger the design credit for Neue Haas Grotesk/Helvetica, and this isn't exactly accurate.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Right.
The most weights of Helvetica were designed after 1961.
Max Miedinger designed the regular and the bold version starting in 1937, but finishing it and been produced by Haas in 1957.
So I for myself list it in my "Schriftensammlung" in this way. I think its correcter.

<div class=commentbody>Georg, you keep quoting that 1937 number, which is totaly false! Someone made a typing errror on the internet; Max Medinger was not working on any typeface design that woule become Helvetica, or anything else, in 1937. I've mentioned this before on other forums. Why do you believe it anyway?
William, Hoffmann was Miedinger's boss, and he commissioned the work. Miedinger drew the key characters of one or two weights for Hoffmann's approval. These typefaces were then produced by Haas. I don't know who in their design offices worked on completing the sketches. After a few years, Stempel and Linotype in Frankfurt took over the typeface, developing it into the super family that we now know as Helvetica.</div>

<div class=commentbody>…and Stempel's! They made most of the family's weights. Helvetica has more than just regular, bold, etc. Think about all of the heavies and the headline things.
The really light and thin designs came in the 1980s, when Stempel/Linotype released Neue Helvetica.</div>

[Old] Helvetica does indeed have a light version, whose letters look like Nick's sample.
Neue Helvetica, in addition to a light weight, has two thinner weights: "35 Thin" and "25 Ultra Light." These are the really, really thin weights (hairlines) that we are used to seeing today.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Dan,
what I wrote is that Max Miedinger started the design of this font in 1937. And its written in a biography I read some years ago. But it was produced from Haas 1957.
http://www.fontblog.de/wie-helvetica-zu-ihrem-namen-kam
I think there is nothing wrong for a designer to realize an idea a long time before this idea becomes a product.
I promis to look for the biography and to send title and author when I start to organize the move of PBM next month.

<div class=commentbody>I don't doubt that Miedinger was already working by 1937; but to imply (without any record, sample drawings, etc) that he spent 20 years working a the design of Neue Haas Grotesk makes the story more complicated than it probably was. It also implies that Miedinger was already working on the design before Hoffmann commissioned it, which I doubt is the case. If this were true, then Hoffmann and the Haas production team might deserve less credit, where in my opinion they actually deserve more credit than they have gotten!</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hoffmann and Miedinger did not begin work on Neue Haas Grotesk until around 1954 I believe, at least that's when the original drawings and proofs I've seen are dated. Miedinger defintely did not do any work on the design of Neue Haas Grotesk prior to the '50s.

<div class=commentbody>Hello - I sent an email to andi - but it seems that the email address isn't available anymore!Here's the original message i sent:
HELLO ANDI!
It seems that I've got the same problem - I'm in the middle of finishing
my final-examination-work - and I have to write something about the
designers of the fonts I used - and I don't find an adequate picture of
Max Miedinger...
Would you mind to forward yours to me?
Thank you so much in advance for your reply!
Katharina from the Black-Forest-Region/Germany
