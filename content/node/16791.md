  the proper name for the 'dent' in a letterform. \r\nFor example the letter 'k'.
  I have looked on the web and can't seem to locate it.\r\n\r\nIf anyone can help,
  I'd really appreciate it.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nT.\r\n\r\n"

    the angle inside the letter v (where the two legs meet) is called the crotch."

    with your design (ok, that is oversimplifying things a bit\u2026), like in <a
    href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/bell-centennial/bold-listing/\">Bell
    Centennial Bold Listing</a>. it isn't the term for the general joins within a
    letter, which I believe is what Tanya is asking for."

  body: "\"is when you over compensate for printing errors\"\r\nit is only \"overcompensation\"
    when you over do it.\r\n\r\nTo me, trapping is also a way to open visual space
    at small sizes--even if ther was no ink plugging going on. Angle joins of M, W,
    and N are examples of glyphs that might need it. The bolder the weight, the more
    likely the need will arise.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: Do you mean the negative space between the arm and the leg of the 'k'? Maybe
    a sort of counter? or maybe it doesn't have a name

    be confused with the same term in reproduction for print, I think inktrap or cutaway

  body: "But since Chris is right that traps fight optical effects\r\nat small sizes
    and not just ink gain, \"inktrap\" is more\r\nmisleading than any momentary and
    rare confusion with\r\nthe print production term. Many terms are overloaded,\r\nbut
    sometimes that's not the worst thing that could\r\nhappen to them.\r\n\r\nTanya,
    I really have no idea what she means.\r\nThe \"k\" is not a typically/prominently
    trapped\r\nletter, but neither does it seem to have any\r\npart that looks like
    a \"dent\"...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nThank you (s) for your replies. I think 'crotch' best describes
      it. The sentence goes something like this:\r\n'The x-height in slogan/tagline
      should never be taller than the 'crotch' in the letter 'k' within the logo.'
      This will then be supported by an illustration. \r\nSounds better than saying
      'indent' or angle if you know what I mean?\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\nT."
