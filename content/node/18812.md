  a font or hand drawn. WTF and Identifont couldn't seem to match it. Does anyone
  recognize this?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cactus.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks
  so much for your help :)\r\nCerilene :)\r\n"

  body: The _a_ _t_ and _s_ seem to be identical so I would lean towards a font. Oh
    and you can just refer to it as a display font, rather than trying to give it
    all sorts of catagories.

  body: "In my opintion, they are not identical. Look to the top-right of the \"s\",
    and look at the top of the \"t\". The \"a\" seems a little more identical however,
    but it's hard to say due to the bad quality of the image if the \"a\" are the
    same.\r\n\r\nI think it's not a font. But I guess there are a lot of people here
    who could help you producing a font out of it ;-)"

    font it is

    this is hand drawn lettering.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    came across a larger sample on a totally random site today, and they had actually
    credited the font. When I read the name, I realized... I already own it. *rolled
