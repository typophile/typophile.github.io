body: "Anyone know of a font editor which can edit TrueType collections (.ttc files)
  directly?\r\n\r\nA lot of software can break a ttc up into a set of ttfs, but if
  you've got a ttc with a single glyf table and a single kern table but n cmap tables,
  and want to change a glyph shape or a kern value, it would be good to do this just
  once to the ttc, not n times to the ttfs.\r\n\r\nMore generally, why did TrueType
  collections not catch on?  Are they more widely used in the Far East than in the
  West?  Maybe there are tools to edit them in Japan or China?\r\n\r\nMany thanks.\r\n\r\n"
