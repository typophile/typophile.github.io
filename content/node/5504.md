    the logo on their plane &#40;AP: &#34;Turns out the first person to know that
    John Kerry had decided on John Edward to be his running mate on the Democratic
    ticket wasn&#39;t even in politics. To guarantee that the name of his vice presidential
    candidate would be on the side of his campaign plane in time, Kerry first told
    an employee of the company that would add a decal with Edwards&#39; name.&#34;&#41;

    wouldn&#39;t tarnish the 60s &#40;my college years plus&#41; with this thing as

  body: Stephen, I&#39;m well aware that Georgia was designed for the screen. But
    it&#39;s perfectly alright for text work in print, lacking only kerning, which
    InD can supply &#34;optically&#34;, for those who care. <BR> <BR>Miller and Fenway
    would be no good, as I said -- Georgia is a good choice for a campaign, because
    it is easily available to grassroots workers. <BR> <BR>Being a scotch roman Miller,
    even if it were available widely, is too &#34;businessy&#34; -- those fancy serifed
    news faces are Republican, but even something more tabloid would not be as broad-based
    in its familiarity and appeal as Georgia. Fenway -- no idea what that looks like,
    who sells it? <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not so sure that &#34;display&#34; weights are
    best for banners. They are often glimpsed from afar, or seen reproduced on TV
    or web images &#40;as held by a person in the crowd at the top of this thread&#41;,
    so a strong image is probably better. <BR> <BR>Also, the &#34;logo&#34; will suffer
    considerable abuse &#40;as on the Kerry website, where the type is horizontally
    scaled&#41;, so you want a typeface that works in the lowest common denominator,
    and a web font is a good choice. <BR> <BR>Any alternative &#40;say, with alternate
    versions of the logo for different media&#41; that required style guide management
    and logo cops would be unworkable for a political campaign! <BR> <BR>As for the
    flag, it&#39;s not too bad, and I suspect that &#34;some style&#34; would be too
    much style for a presidential election campaign. <BR>

    the reason for the bad design was that the same design was created &#40;and printed&#41;
