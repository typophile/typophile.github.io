body: "So, I spent weeks on end tidying up the normal weight to a font. Now I want
  to do bold. As a starting point, are there any general guidelines to stick by? I
  believe there's a technique of shifting the right-sides of the strokes. What should
  I watch for if I do this? Does this mean I should maintain the left sidebearings
  from my regular weight? \r\n\r\nOf course I expect to be redrawing and taming the
  letters drastically in the refinement process. I'm asking about any prepatory, preliminary
  production work that would help me get started."

  body: Where you end up depends on where you start. If your design has an overall
    even weight/balance to the strokes, then emboldening is a fairly straightforward
    matter. However, if your design is medium to high contrast, the process gets trickier.
    In either case, remember that the Undo command is your friend.

  body: For medium to high contrast fonts, is it alright or generally frowned upon
    to start with the Bold action in Fontlab?

    can start a design process anyway you want. Bold action in Fontlab, or individually
    swabbing your letters in magic bold sauce. Where you wind up is all that matters."

  body: To second what James said, try both and see which you prefer. Personally,
    I don't like the automation and do it manually so as to make sure I haven't overlooked
    anything.

    I would have said the exact opposite. Though it's a bigger problem in really heavy
    weights, like a black or an ultra.\r\n\r\nWhat you do with the sidebearings depends
    on what you do with the distribution of the added weight on the x-axis. Generally
    speaking, the smaller the internal space, the smaller the sidebearings."

  body: My method is to use FontLab's auto bold to get an idea of overall colour,
    width and contrast. I plop the result into the mask layer as a guide, but the
    curves are messy so I scale and stretch (and tweak) the curves from the regular
    to fit the proportions of the bold. That way the curves don't lose so much tension.
    Also you need to check the alignment zones (in my experience FontLab shortens
    caps and extenders when you select 'keep glyph dimensions'. And your x-height
    will need to be bumped up a bit, more so in a sans serif design.
