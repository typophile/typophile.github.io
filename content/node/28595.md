  this way:\r\n\r\n1.\r\nWrite the company's name in Argo\r\n\r\n2.\r\nScale the result
  200% horizontally\r\n\r\n3.\r\nThrow away the dot over i, or crop the ascenders,
  or both\r\n\r\n4.\r\nVoila!\r\n\r\nA logo like this may seem trendy at first (to
  some people), but 10 years after, it is hopelessly outdated.\r\n\r\nCould you please
  tell me (I am gathering ammo for the designer/client meeting): when did we first
  see these examples of bad typography? Must have been in early 90s or what?\r\n\r\n--\r\nsorenolsen\r\ndenmark\r\n\r\nof

  body: "It is sad that good designers have to spend so much time convincing a client
    not to use crap.  Try to explain to the client that their image is very valuable
    and worthy of careful design consideration.  A cheap \"just like all the rest
    of them\" logo will not distinguish your client from his competition or help position
    them favoorably in their customer's eys.  Good things only come from good hard
    work. I wish you the best in your meeting! We have all been there.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "<em>when did we first see these examples of bad typography</em>\r\n\r\nProgress
    is often the result of incorporating \"mistakes\", which are made possible by
    new technology, into the canon.\r\nThat is where the paragraph indent came from,
    to go way back in time.\r\nNegative leading and fitting of text in the 1970s were
    made possible by photosetting.\r\nScaling distorion is a desktop-publishing phenomenon,
    because it's easy for computer-using designers entrusted with typography to \"squeeze
    to fit\". And hey, it looks new, different, and interesting -- or at least it
    did 15 years ago, if you didn't find it horrifying.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps your client
    is into a retro-vernacular-1991 kind of thing?\r\n\r\n\"Ransom Note\" typography
    was popularized by Jamie Reid in his designs for the Sex Pistols in 1977, and
    used by Neville Brody in The Face magazine (before he designed his own typefaces).\r\n\r\n"

    body: "I want to stress that I am not necessaryly against horizontal scaling of
      type ... but if you design a logo you have to analyze your client's present
      situation, the desired goal and how to get there - and _then_ you design a logo.
      If you skip the analysis, and just scale a word 200 percent and crop the ascenders
      and call that logo design, that is wrong.\r\n\r\n--\r\nsoren olsen"

  body: My problem with scaling type is it distorts the weight balance of the characters.
    Stretching thins the verticals and condencing thins the horizontals.

    are doing, and the client probably doesn''t. If you want a long skinny typeface,
    find one, don''t butcher something else. Like Dan said, so few people care about
    type, they don''t realize it''s an art. And that''s why I was so happy to find
    this forum! '
