  training in typography (or in any form of art), but I've read a few books on typography,
  so the posters have generally turned out clean but pretty boring.\r\n\r\nIs there
  some book on how to make these posters more interesting?"

    Power of the Poster</a> by Margaret Timmers is very good. I was actually lucky
    enough to see the exhibit for which this book was created too. Very inspiring
    for the young graphic designer.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.internationalposter.com/reference-books.aspx\">International
    Poster Gallery</a> also has a great range of reference books as well as a grundle
    of online images to view."

    short\u2014section on poster design. It\u2019s not really worth buying if you
    aren\u2019t a type history fetishist, but if you can find it in a library you
    should definitely check it out."

    I'll also order some of those reference books.\r\n\r\nI'm still open to new suggestions.
    I really want something more like a guide than just examples."

    boring?

    posters.

  body: "I, too, think that looking at examples of good posters is a valid way to
    learn. Here are four recommendations:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/New-Masters-Poster-Design-Century/dp/1592532225/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1200974242&sr=1-2\"><em>New
    Masters of Poster Design</em></a> is a good contemporary collection.\r\n\r\nJohn
    Barnicoats' <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Posters-Concise-History-World-Art/dp/0500201188/ref=sr_1_65?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1200974661&sr=1-65\"><em>Posters:
    A Concise History</em></a> is exactly that, and a classic text on the subject
    (not a how-to, however).\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Up-Against-Wall-International-Poster/dp/B000MV8HKM/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1200974901&sr=1-8\"><em>Up
    Against The Wall</em></a> is an international poster collection.\r\n\r\nOne more
    compilation: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Century-Posters-Martijn-F-Coultre/dp/0853318638/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1200975539&sr=1-3\"><em>A
    Century of Posters</em></a>.\r\n\r\nI also think that there probably isn't a \"how-to\"
    guide devoted exclusively to posters. But there are books about good design principles...
    which can be applied to posters, book covers, page layout, etc. A good one to
    start out with is the recent <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Design-Elements-Graphic-Style-Manual/dp/1592532616/ref=sr_1_31?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1200975128&sr=1-31\"><em>Design
    Elements: A Graphic Style Manual</em></a>, by Timothy Samara.\r\n"
