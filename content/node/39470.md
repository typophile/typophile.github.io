  can have, but maybe we will automatically :)\r\n\r\nBut we need to investigate the
  market.\r\n\r\nAs per today we have 135 ligatures in a standard Latin 1 font.\r\n\r\nAnyone

    in OpenType. \r\n\r\neg: \r\n<code>sub t @u_accents by t.001 @u.002_accents</code>\r\n\r\nBeing
    able to do that would make all those accented ligatures redundant with the bonus
    of smaller font files and faster development.\r\n\r\n- David"

  body: "For comparison, a Devanagari font for classical Sanskrit could - in theory
    - comprise 40,358,340 ligatures, i.e. more than fourty million ligatures. However,
    for any language, there are tremendous phonetic restrictions, and therefore for
    Sanskrit, during my 2-year research, I could only find 800+ ligatures in attestable,
    quotable ancient Sanskrit texts.\r\n\r\nA Dutch mathematician made for me combinatorics
    calculations based on phonetic restrictions I supplied to him concerning Sanskrit,
    and he arrived at 1,896,777 phonetically possible Sanskrit ligatures, i.e. nearly
    two million ligatures. His mathematical calculations (in German language) are
    found here\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sanskritweb.net/sansdocs/mathe.pdf\r\n\r\nSo, before
    answering your question \"How many ligatures a font can have?\" you will have
    to find an answer to the question: \"How many phonetical combinations are possible
    for a given language or for the languages to be covered by the font?\"\r\n"

    plug-in to Indesign ME sets Arabic by stroke, rather than by letter, building
    up a word stroke by stroke. I don''t read Arabic, but in the demonstration it
    looked quite amazing, and takes the whole ligature issue to a new level. '

    agree, that's what prompted me to start <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/39473\">a
    discussion discussing </em>'liga' vs. 'calt'</em></a> instead of hijacking this
    one.\r\n\r\nlots of thinking about ligatures for me today. in the morning it was
    filled with [[James Mosely]] speaking about early humanist types and showing Aldus'
    italic type for Virgil, which incorporates many ligatures. James argued that too
    many ligatures may actually harm reading, if they break up the word picture. in
    the afternoon, it was Indian scripts with [[Fiona Ross]] and the inevitability
    of conjunct characters. both quite thought provoking from my point of view."
