  body: "It was a good idea to bump this back up in the list, but I think the problem
    (especially for me) is two-fold: \r\n1) the lettering is small; \r\n2) it's some
    darn Techno font\r\n\r\nNumber 2 is a problem for me because so many of the things
    look like each other and so many of the fonts being used are amateur designs.
    If none of us recognized this as a commercial font, then your best bet would be
    to type this phrase into the sample window at [[http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=303|Dafont's
    SciFi category]] and see if a match shows up. I'm amazed at how often this works
    on this style of font.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
