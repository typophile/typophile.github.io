  taken home to finish. I started on Illustrator CC on a Windows PC and am now working
  on a OS X PC (if that helps). Both PCs are using the same version of Illustrator.
  The reason I chose this font is because the 'A' kind of looks like a house - with
  the reflected one making a reflection in the water.\r\n\r\nThanks."

      properly (this is a PDF) because I do not have the font.
