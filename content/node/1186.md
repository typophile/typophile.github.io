body: Funny thing I just ran across, a logo I did a while back, admitting I didnt
  spend a whole of time with this, I still think the choice over mine was much more
  political than anything. <BR> <BR>So the FMUGAZ &#40;Flash &amp; Multimedia Users
  Group of Arizona&#41; is who this is for. The guy that runs it is a bit of a dink.
  Some dumb kid that wouldn&#39;t know if good design punched him in the face. Whats
  funny is this kid applied to work for my firm some time back, and after I turned
  down his application, he actually asked if he could intern for free. Even then I
  told him I didn&#39;t think it would be a great fit. So long story short, I make
  a presentation at this users group &#40;which is not run by Macromedia for the record&#41;
  The topic, Flash search engine optimization &#40;for those in the know, we call
  this throwing darts in the dark <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
  ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>&#41;, durning such event I made reference to the fact that
  Macromedia was notorious for &#34;poor support&#34;, more like &#34;non-existant
  &#149;&#149;&#149;&#149; support&#34;, but that aside the point. So this guy at
  some point before this presentation asked me to please help in designing a logo
  for the group, this is what I came up with <a href="http://www.kylehildebrant.com/downloads/fmug_logo_comps.pdf"
  target="_blank">http://www.kylehildebrant.com/downloads/fmug_logo_comps.pdf</a>
  <BR>and here is what they chose &#40;not long after my presentation&#41;<a href="http://www.azflash.org"
  target="_blank">http://www.azflash.org</a>  <BR> <BR>Later I was asked not to participate
  in the group, due to my &#34;Negative Talk&#34; twards Macromedia. <BR> <BR>Haha,
  it all cracks me up. I just have a hard time thinking that the chosen logo was bettern
  than mine &#40;and yes this sounds egotistical, but ohhwell&#41;. <BR> <BR>hildebrant.
  <BR> <BR>PS. In 3/4 drunk, so I will probably regret this in the morning.

    slant the right amount to fit in with the radiating bars. <BR> <BR>But you forgot

  body: Jesus... what a stinking logo. While I&#39;m not sure on your g, myself, it
    is all in all a rather nice and sleek design, while  their version is so just
    much crapola.

  body: Their logo suffers a lot because the strokes coming out are all distorted
    by the stretching. You can tell it was mechanically obliqued and stretched because
    of how some of the strokes are thicker than others. Pretty amateur mistake, that.

    can tell you to go to hell and make you look forward to the trip. The design that
    won wasn&#39;t based on its merits, it was based on your diplomancy.

    a diplomat. Now, if thid were a paying client, that is a completly different story.

  body: Life is diplomacy, I can walk into a store where I&#39;ve been kind plesent
    and they will have my order before I can order it. I bicycle race and I can control
    the field because I can negotiate with the other riders, if I just tried to out
    mustle them I wouldn&#39;t have a chance. I got a win for a friend earlier in
    the year by doing that. I asked other friends to not chase him on a critical lap
    in a points race.

    and that the decision was blantanty political and most likely related to your
    turning down the &#39;dink&#39;s&#39; application. <BR> <BR>A lesson learned form

    so the record is straight: <BR> <BR>1&#41; The winning logo was chosen by a group
    vote. It had nothing to do with diplomacy. <BR>2&#41; The &#34;dink&#34; Kyle
    refers to happens to be a respected Flash developer. Aside from running the user
    group, he wrote a book on Flash basics for O&#39;Reilly &#40;which will be on
    shelves soon&#41;, tech edited several others, writes articles on Flash for InformIT.com,
    and works at KnowledgeNet, a very reputable eLearning company. <BR>3&#41; The
    manager of the group never touched the graphics for the group&#39;s web site.
    Everything on the site was done by group members who volunteered their time and
    energy. <BR>4&#41; As I recall, Kyle&#39;s removal from the group was the result
    of several malicious posts that both insulted group members and had no purpose
    other than to slam Macromedia. The posts were neither constructive nor useful
    for anyone but Kyle. The group manager received several complaints about Kyle&#39;s
    posts from group members. The manager then replied to Kyle on the list with the
    utmost diplomacy. Kyle&#39;s attitude was childish at best. The group manager
    acted on behalf of the group, and we applaud his efforts. <BR> <BR>Kyle, the group
    has done a lot of good for a lot of people. You got yourself kicked off the list.
    And that&#39;s no reason to publically insult anyone but yourself.'

  body: 'I like the logo they chose, although it is rough around the corners.  I like
    the one they chose because it fits a &#39;user group&#39; attitude, and the other
    looks like it&#39;s more for an event or award show.   There&#39;s another factor
    I think is probably going on: these guys aren&#39;t designers, and they don&#39;t
    want to have a logo they can&#39;t use loosely.  Do you really think these guys
    could follow through with your identity across an entire site?  Its better to
    leave superior design for larger projects where you can manage more details across
    all the collateral.   Have a look at their Web site.. their logo fits better with
    what they are comfortable, thus I think it&#39;s better.  That&#39;s a hard lesson
    I think a lot of logo designers need to learn. '
