body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI am working on a poetry book titled My Master. I am looking for
  a sensual font that conveys ideas of submission and devotion.  I'm looking for a
  font that doesn't stand out too much, that works well with large bodies of text,
  somehow reminiscent of a Bible. I'm looking at some Caslons and New Caledonias (I
  like their weight), but would like to have other recommendations, comments. \r\n\r\nI'm
  pasting an excerpt from a William Blake poem I'm interested in. \r\n\r\nThank you
  in advance\r\n\r\n"

    something that does all that.\r\n\r\n* It's called Domination Available, a name

  body: "Script fonts can be very expressive. Normally you wouldn't set a book in
    script, but if it's a series of poems, perhaps it might work if you pick an easy-to-read
    script and set it large enough. \r\n\r\nOr maybe just start each poem with a large
    initial cap in script, and the rest in a more conventional font.\r\n\r\nYou can
    also use illustrations and decorative elements to set the mood."

    a nice combination of blackletter (which may be reminiscent of the Bible) and
    roman styles (which doesn\u2019t stand too much)."
