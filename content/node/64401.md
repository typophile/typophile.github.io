  be the most informed on all typeface matters.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to find a font to
  write in that will be a match for the ff fortissimo symbol\r\n[[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Music-fortissimo.png]]
  \r\n\r\nI found this discussion elsewhere in the forum [[http://typophile.com/node/58526]]\r\nbut
  those suggestions weren't quite right as a match for the fortissimo lettering\r\n\r\nThe
  closest looked to be the Berthold Bodoni Old Style BQ Italic but it's not quite
  right and i can't afford to buy fonts and not have them be the correct one.\r\n\r\nAny
  help or suggestions would be gratefully received. Thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    in the type tester when you take a look."

  body: That does look pretty close to the example, but I'm not sure there really
    is a "correct" typeface for musical notation.

    would contain that symbol?

  body: I would definitely say that Bodoni bold italic is closer than Century bold
    italic; there are several different versions of Bodoni, so one can look for a
    closer match using sites like myfonts.com .
