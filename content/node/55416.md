body: "Sorry if this isn't the best place to post this, but I don't see a wanted/talent
  forum.\r\n\r\nI'm a photographer in nyc and working on a small creative/experimental
  project and looking for someone who has experience constructing typefaces. It's
  a no-pay collaborative project to design a small set of simple glyphs with some
  socio-economic relevance. Some research may be necessary and of course, a bunch
  of free time. \r\n\r\nNote: I won't need a complete latin character set, just a
  few specific glyphs. Adobe Illustrator is sufficient. No need for special font authoring
  software. \"Hand-made\" is even ok, and possibly preferable.\r\n\r\nThe idea has
  to do with recent popular design trends, specifically in the last 20 years, responding
  to it, and taking it in a different direction based on earlier historical precedents.
  It's sort of important that the typographer be familiar with glyph construction
  prior to the last 20 years.\r\n\r\nOutside of typography, there are specific fine
  art, photography, and music references that I can provide which should help explain
  it better. I hate to use the word \"functional\", so instead I will say that I need
  something that is lean and pragmatic. But with a subtle twist.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nRed\r\n\r\n"
