  is not Helvetica, it is not Univers, it is not Aktiv Grotesk (althought I thought
  it was, the \"a\"'s are very similar, but Aktiv's \"i\" has a squared dot while
  this is rounded.)\r\n\r\nSo, anyone knows which typeface this is?\r\n\r\nLove that
  lowercase \"a\"!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.studio-output.com/about"
