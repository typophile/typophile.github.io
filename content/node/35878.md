body: "Hi all.\r\n\r\nCreating a publication, a 're-do' of an old version that we
  did a year ago. The whole layout is set using the Univers family, but I'd like to
  freshen things up a bit in this new design with the use of a serif for captions,
  folios, running heads etc? Any ideas of a nice compliment to Univers...?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance.\r\nRez"

  body: Our corporate design is built on a Univers-Minion Pro relationship. This,
    admittedly, is not ideal, because they have different x-heights. But if you're
    using your serif largely separately, or if you don't mind the occasional tweaking,
    I'd recommend it. For an example, take a peek at <a href="http://www.lampstandpress.com/egypt/pdf/watopics.pdf">this
    product page</a>, or at our <a href="http://www.lampstandpress.com/xindex.php">homepage</a>
    (with, obviously, lots of Arial scattered around).

    together:\r\n\r\nITC Cheltenham\r\nCooper Light BT\r\nGeorgia (surprisingly)\r\nOptima
    (not really a serif)\r\nPalatino\r\n\r\n - Lex"
