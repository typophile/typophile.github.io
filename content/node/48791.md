  The classes are configured for the letter O as follows\r\n\r\n_O: O' Ograve Oacute
  Ocircumflex Otilde Odieresis Oslash\r\n_Oleft: O' C Q Ccedilla OE G\r\n\r\n_O controls
  both sides of the glyph, _Oleft controls only the left side. _O works just fine,
  but _Oleft gets weird and only some of the kerns appear. The letters in the _O class
  are turning blue, and kern for VC and VG but not for AC and AG. Making things weirder,
  when I try clicking the little blue/white buttons to see what\u2019s going on with
  classes nothing shows up for any pair of letters. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ve made sure to
  clear out the existing kerns for the pairs of O, A, C, and G and added them back
  in to no avail. Am I doing something wrong, or is this just some Fontlab bug that
  won\u2019t affect the final fonts?"

  body: "All mechanisms for generating a kern feature that I know (FLS5, the AFDKO
    script, my own stuff) require that there is exactly one keyglyph/class per side.
    This means, using _O class for 1st/2nd of pair and _Oleft as additional 1st of
    pair just does not work. The mechanism will use either of these classes and ignore
    the other.\r\nSo this is about the only working option:\r\n\r\n_O_1ST: O\u2019
    Ograve Oacute Ocircumflex Otilde Odieresis Oslash C Q Ccedilla OE G\r\n_O_2ND:
    O\u2019 Ograve Oacute Ocircumflex Otilde Odieresis Oslash\r\n\r\nAlso, better
    use more unique identifiers like \"_LEFT\"/\"_RIGHT\". They make it easier for
    scripts to identify classes correctly. Or, preferably, \"_1ST\"/\"_2ND\" since
    both FLS5's and OpenType's logic for kerning is: first-glyph-of-pair and second-glyph-of-pair,
    not left and right. This is important when it comes to right-to-left kerning.\r\n\r\nKarsten"

    I\u2019m still going to handle the classes the way you recommend), it turns out
    that I had kerning values of zero in the AC and AG pairs that I had to reset.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m
    still wondering why those buttons don\u2019t actually refer back to the classes,
    tho."

  body: "James,\r\nFontLab's \"Kerning Assistance\" feature has a tiny hard to see
    icon of a ying-yang symbol. When you click on it, it tells you if you have any
    overlapping kerning classes. Karsten has explained the one-time use of a key glyph
    issue. I have found that there are rarely cases where a class will be both left
    and right. I almost always end up with left side and right side only key glyphs.
    It is more efficient and causes fewer of the cryptic opentype error messages that
    FontLab throws at you.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    trick then is to remember to only kern O with other characters, and not D with
    other characters."

    of zero in the AC and AG pairs that I had to reset</cite>\r\n\r\nAs far as I know,
    zero-values don't go into the kern features. (For this reason, if you want to
    define \"exception kerning\" as zero-values, better choose 1 or -1. This is even
    more important if you work with MM fonts: There, zero can as well mean: no kerning.
    Which is not the same as an exception value of zero.)"
