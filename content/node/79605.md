    sharp points on the serifs. Castle's version of <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/castletype/latin-ct/\">Latin

    font!)\r\n\r\nI'm thinking something along those lines as well. The designer probably

  body: "You're welcome.\r\n\r\nThe 'shadow'  effect in letters like these are usually
    just offset layers of the same lettering in white and some other color. The blunter
    points may have been done by moving the points a bit with the letters in outline
    form.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega\r\n"
