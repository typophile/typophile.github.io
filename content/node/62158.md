body: "I am trying identify a type which a client gave to me on printed peice. I have
  tried many websites and my own refence materials, but have no success. I was wondering
  any of you might know this type face? The T and A are weird. This might be one of
  those free downloadable fonts. It could be off the books. Or, it's an old 80's magazine
  typeface. Either way, I have no idea what this typeface is. \r\n\r\nThe closest
  thing that I've found is that it's possibly an altered Helvetica Light and not really
  an original typeface.\r\n\r\nAny ideas? Thanks in advance for any help.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/photo_3415.jpg]"
