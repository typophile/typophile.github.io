body: "More and more foundries include larger character sets with extended language
  support in their fonts. This is good.\r\n(Not all design the \"foreign\" glyphs
  well, but that is another discussion ;)\r\n\r\nBut when promoting their language
  support I have noticed that many foundries list \"Norwegian (bokm\xE5l)\" and \"Norwegian
  (nynorsk)\" -- and some even also just \"Norwegian\" -- as separate entries in their
  list of supported languages. This looks just ignorant to a native Norwegian, as
  both official languages of Norway use the same character set -- they are to be considered
  more like dialects.\r\n\r\nIf you want to bloat your list of supported languages
  then go ahead and include both, but why not also include \"English, American, Australian,
  British, Cockney, Ebonics\" etc.? Makes just as much sense...\r\n\r\nIf you include
  the \xC6, \xE6, \xD8, \xF8, \xC5 and \xE5 glyphs (and some other standard european
  diacritics) in your fonts they support \"Norwegian\". Plain and simple. OK?\r\n\r\nSo
  there you have it -- I hope to see some edited \"supported languages\" lists now...\r\n;)\r\n\r\nRoger"

    In the cases were the font doesn\u2019t include a 'fj'-lig and alternate 'f's

    is somewhat misleading. The ring in '\xC5' and '\xE5' also tend to be very poorly

  body: "@sii:\r\nI have nothing against language lists on foundry pages. It is good
    information for customers.\r\n\r\nBut I doubt such a client you describe will
    have specified \"Norwegian Bokm\xE5l\" and/or \"Norwegian Nynorsk\" in their shopping
    list. And if they did, they would probably be satisfied to find just \"Norwegian\",
    right?\r\n\r\n@ font foundries:\r\nIf you want to attract Norwegian customers:
    just list support for \"Norwegian\" -- if you separate it into Nynorsk and Bokm\xE5l
    you just present yourself as a faux-knowledgable ignorant. Not trustworthy. (\"If
    they know that little about our language they probably do not know how to design
    our glyphs properly\")\r\nIf you want to inform international customers needing
    to set documents in Norwegian: list it as \"Norwegian (bokm\xE5l & nynorsk)\"
    if you must, but keep it as ONE entry! But then you might as well also list \"English
    (UK, USA, Canadian, Australian)\" -- this makes just as much sense...\r\n\r\nIt
    is mostly about spelling.\r\n\r\nThe separation of bokm\xE5l and nynorsk is getting
    out of hand -- no need to spread the confusion outside of Norway ;)\r\n\r\nNorwegian
    is just Norwegian!"

    Australian)\u201D \u2014 this makes just as much sense...</em>\r\n\r\nYou may
    be up to something there ... :)\r\n\r\nI think the term \"language support\" is
    somewhat misleading, because what really matters are orthographies, not languages.\r\n\r\nFor
    example: In Switzerland people speak German (among other languages), but their
    orthography is different from the ones used in Germany. The Swiss use no \xDF.
    So a font which contains \xE4\xF6\xFC but no \xDF may be perfectly fine for \"German
    (Swiss)\" but not \"German (Germany)\". Or if you want to set an old German text
    which contains the long s, you would have to look out for a font supporting \"German
    (pre-1901 reform)\" or something like that.\r\n\r\nOr take Latin: Regular Latin
    can be written with the bare ASCII set, but I remember my schoolbooks used to
    indicate long and short vowels, so there would be a need for \"Latin\" as well
    as \"Latin (Grammatical)\" support.\r\n\r\nThen there are languages which aren't
    written at all ... and Languages that are written in multiple scripts, e.g. Serbian
    which uses Latin as well as Cyrillic, making it necessary to differentiate and
    not just list \"Serbian\" as supported.\r\n\r\nYour point about Norwegian is perfectly
    valid, I just wanted to add some more general considerations.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJens"

    language support of my reworked fonts - but they are all language related. There
    is already great enough \"confusion\" about the two official languages of Norway
    - but this should have nothing to do with typography. It is a linguistic choice
    and not really a character set choice. Let's keep the distinction for the linguistics.\r\n\r\nA
    writer/translator may list knowledge (and a choice) of both languages - that makes
    sense. But a type designer/foundry listing support of both languages just appears
    really unknowledgeable about Norwegian (basically not a good way to promote the
    design quality of the fonts)...\r\n\r\nI am feverishly advocating that we keep
    this (quite political) distinction away from the type design area. Whichever norwegian
    language a user choose to write has nothing to do with the character set - both
    can be written with a font that supports Norwegian.\r\nJust as you can write \"color\"
    and \"colour\" with the same font without specifically listing that it supports
    \"English (American)\" and \"English (British)\" ;)"
