body: "I tried to find out how to generate unicodes with the help of the fontlab manual.
  \r\nIn the \"generate unicode\" pop up menu, i activated \"try to keep existing
  unicode indexes\" and the \"standard table\".\r\n\r\nwhen i click \"ok\", nothing
  changes. I guess it is because there ar no default unicodes in the application support/mapping
  folder for the glyphs i created, which are, exept of the default ones, named a.alt1,...
  a.alt2,... and so on.\r\n\r\nIn the manual, I read the recommodation not to change
  the text of the name unicode database.\r\n\r\nEven if I wouldn\xB4t have read this
  recommodation, I wouldn\xB4t know how to name the unicodes for those alt. glyphs.\r\n\r\nDid
  I just not read the manual careful enough or do I find the explantion about this
  elsewhere?\r\n \r\nIs it necessary  to generate unicodes for those glyphs at all?
  \r\n\r\nAs you can easily remark, I am a beginner. Feel free to just tell me where
  I can read more about this. I don\xB4t expect a personal explication if I can just
  read it somewhere.\r\n\r\nthanks in any case\r\n\r\njulia\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Alternate glyphs does not receive Unicode designation. This also applies
    to small caps*, petite caps, swashes and so on \u2013 which are also alternates,
    although within a well established typographic standard.\r\n\r\nThis is not a
    limit defined by the FL table in use, but come from Unicode itself \u2013 which
    maps just uppercase and lowercase glyps for Latin script. So, it will not change
    even if you adopt other tables for generate codes.\r\n\r\nThus if the glyphs you
    do not got coded by FontLab are all *.alt*, the result you got is actually the
    excepted one.\r\n\r\n* <em>Sidenote:</em> Unicode has some small caps mapped,
    but for special uses (like phonetics or maths), and not as alternates to A/z set."

  body: "Unicode does not map codepoints (Unicode values or indexes) to glyphs. Unicode
    maps codepoints to characters (bits of information). The glyphs \"A\", \"A.smallcap\",
    \"A.swash\" or \"A.titling\" are all representations of the same character. Unicode
    does not deal with representations of characters.\r\nA fontmaker can provide different
    representations for the same character (via layout features) and can use the same
    representation for different characters (e.g. capital Omega and Ohm sign) with
    the cmap table.\r\n\r\nSee: [[http://developer.apple.com/fonts/whitepapers/iuc15cg.pdf|Character-Glyph
    Model]]"
