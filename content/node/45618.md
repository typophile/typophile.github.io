  white and worry about the color later!\r\n\r\nNow I can see things more clearly
  and not distracted by the colors.\r\n\r\nThanks ~ Will post again when I am closer
  to completion.  \r\n\r\n"

    bold seems bigger then the light. You can see that between the \"t\" and \"r\".
    I would make the \"v\" slightly bigger. Maybe instead of green, I would use magenta.
    \"target your social calendar\" I would start it aligning with the vertical of
    the \"n\" and bigger, cause if you reduce this to a certain size, the line of
    text will be too small. Yep.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: "There is too many things happening in this logo. First off, go back to designing
    in black and white, color is one of the last things you deal with in a logo.\r\n\r\nFirst
    off, you might want to consider picking a different font, especially if you're
    \"geared towards women\". Second, the weight change for \"ress\" isn't necessary
    and adds little to the meaning, same with the illustrator brush stroke 'v'.\r\n\r\nThe
    tagline also needs reworked, it's much too small, and looks smashed up under the
    end of the logo like a wad of clay. \r\n\r\nThe icon, I assume is a calendar,
    doesn't look like a calendar. Pull it out and rework it to resemble a calendar
    more. This could become the logomark and work side by side with your logotype.
    \r\n\r\nBack to the sketch pad with this one. "

    business. I think the event in itself stands out and is obvious. Also the v...
    I don't quite get it. Is it supposed to be something? The slash coming out of
    it? \r\n\r\nToo much going on. "

    typeface on an implied grid of some kind and the v could help make the x. \r\n\r\nIt
    could be somewhere to start sketching. "
