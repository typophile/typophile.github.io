body: "Hello All - \r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your advice! I am working on a business
  card for a massage therapist friend of mine. She is an older lady, and wants to
  incorporate the idea of homeopathic healing into her card. She's studying ancient
  chinese fortune-telling called BaZi, and her tagline is \"bodywork for the soul.\"
  So let's get new-agey. :) She also wants to incorporate a dove.\r\n\r\nFor some
  reason, I am stumped on type. All of the samples I've seen of massage therapist
  cards have terrible type (and design). I'm considering something like Uralita, Amulet,
  or even Cassandre. But those might be too...celtic. Any suggestions?\r\n\r\nALSO:
  We are in Dallas. So while some people are open-minded, many are conservative. Though
  she has a clear vision here, I don't want her card to limit her clientele if I can
  help it."

    to say you can ignore the conservative types, because they aren\u2019t going to
    give a hoot nor a holler for any New-Age Chinese mumbo-jumbo anyway. Your client\u2019s
    likely customers will either be ignorant or sophisticated: aim your design at
    the latter group\u2014which means elegant and understated.\r\n\r\nOr\u2014if you
    must tip to your hat to a Texas frame of mind\u2014go whole-hog medicine show
    and do a faux snake oil advertisement in woodtype..."

    is not a bad idea, I'm going to try that in there.\r\n\r\nI agree, oldnick, sophisticated
    and understated. Aaand new-agey? That's where I'm having a hard time mixing. "

    a bull, of Occupy Wall Street fame. So maybe a yoga pose on a longhorn's head.\r\n\r\nNick,
    one qualifier to your insight is that I believe there's an untapped pool of fed-up
    wives of conservative chauvinists who might be pining for exactly this sort of
    thing, but they do need to feel comfortable via what they know first.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    I agree with you both, I think \"understated\" is the way to go. You don't want
    it looking like a cheap takeout box, http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=201\r\n\r\n"
