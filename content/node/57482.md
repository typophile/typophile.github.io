  me some iconic typographers from the 1960's. would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nCheers"

    from the 60s start to show up here in the late 70s, eg George Lois, Herb Lubalin.\r\n\r\nHere's
    something by Lubalin that would be good to get your hands on:\r\nhttp://cgi.ebay.ca/EROS-MAGAZINE-SUMMER-1962-VOL-1-2-EROTICA_W0QQitemZ360149516741QQcmdZViewItemQQptZMagazines?hash=item360149516741&_trksid=p3286.c0.m14&_trkparms=72%3A1215%7C66%3A2%7C65%3A12%7C39%3A1%7C240%3A1318\r\n"

  body: "In the 1960s you would have often heard the names Hermann Zapf and Adrian
    Frutiger, though the types that made them famous were designed a decade earlier.
    Jan Tschichold designed Sabon in the mid-60s, late in his career. Matthew Carter
    designed Cascade Script and Snell Roundhand in the 60s, though he didn't become
    well-known until the 70s. Herb Lubalin designed Avant Garde for the magazine of
    the same name in the 60s, and the prolific Ed Benguiat was designing in the 60s,
    though his designs didn't gain widespread popularity until the 70s. \r\nGraphic
    designers of that period, admired for their use of type designed by others, included
    Paul Rand and Milton Glaser. "

  body: "Good luck with the auction. That's a 10\" x 13\", 85-page hardcover magazine
    with spot colors and special papers, entirely designed by Lubalin, with no advertisements.
    Consider how much the monograph on him sells for, which doesn't contain a single
    original. \r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Herb-Lubalin-Director-Designer-Typographer/dp/0931144280\r\nThere
    is also trade in old Avant Garde magazines."
