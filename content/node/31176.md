body: "Right now I'm still hashing stuff together in Illustrator, trying to master
  bezier curves and such. I want to start maybe putting stuff together into an actual
  font file. I have FontForge, but talk about a learning curve! Youch! Add that to
  the fact that I have to run it on X11 on my mac, and it doesn't seem the best learning
  environment.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering if TypeTool is the best next step to follow? I'm
  a broke student, so buying a full-fledged Fontlab or Fontographer isn't really an
  option right now. What do you guys think? Should I just wait and save the dough?
  Or should I spend the money and try to learn what I can right now?"

    You learn a lot from using great tools <em>or</em> creating your own to suits
    your needs.

    design software does, namely that the time it takes to figure it out could pay
    for commercial software that has a better interface and great help files. And
    trying to make X not look like crap on OS X isn't worth the bother.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for your post Adam. I was about to buy Typetool."

    a 60-day money-back satisfaction guarantee. This means that if you buy a product
    today and Fontlab Ltd. releases a new version within two months, you can buy the
    new version and have a refund for the old version credited against your purchase
    -- this is functionally equivalent to \"buy version 2 today and get version 3
    free in 2 months\" (if the new price is the same as the old one, otherwise you'll
    need to pay the difference). If more than 2 months go by, you would need to pay
    the upgrade price. \r\n\r\nHowever, as we're very close to releasing all-new TypeTool
    3, you may as well hold off for a few weeks unless you have a prompting need to
    get something done right now. \r\n\r\nCurrently, TypeTool 2 is $99. We have not
    yet announced the pricing for TypeTool 3 but my guess is that it will be in the
    same price range. \r\n\r\nAdam\r\n"
