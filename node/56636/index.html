  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi there.</p>
<p>Currently, I&rsquo;m in the midst of choosing which school to go to for graphic design.  So far, I got into CCA in SF, Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, and School of Visual Arts in NYC.  I didn&rsquo;t think I would get into any, so this is a great surprise.</p>
<p>Part of me is leaning towards Art Center, but they haven&rsquo;t sent me any financial aid/scholarship information and want me to wait a month to 6 weeks.  And, that would be past my deadline for the other schools which is May 1st.  I have asked my design teachers for their advice, and when they found out I got into Art Center and CCA, they suggested Art Center.  But now, I have two more schools to consider, Pratt and SVA which was not part of the discussion since I found out this week.  My dream was to go to SVA and the fact that I got in made me happy.  I still have to wait for financial aid info from Pratt.  So, I have a lot to decide.  My mentor told me that whatever school I choose, I&rsquo;ve chosen great programs  and that I would prosper in the program.   Currently, I&rsquo;m experiencing an emotional rollercoaster b/c I&rsquo;ve waited for so long for this to happen and dedicated so much time as I am getting my second degree.   And, its happening!</p>
<p>Suggestions?  Advice?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I think it depends on what sort of design you are interested on. I was reading the last edition of print and it had a great article on the directions that different schools followed. I go to The School of the Art Institute of Chicago (saic.edu) and I love it. I think you should look at your work and see what is it that motivates you, that would allow you to decide what school is the best for you</div>

		<div class="commentbody">If you love typography New York is a magical place, and the SVA faculty are legends for a reason. It will also allow you to intern in New York, and while the pay sucks, that really builds up a resume. OTOH, California weather is great—I imagine all that Pasadena sunshine makes dealing with stressful winter days much easier.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thank you for your comments.  I have been following Print Magazine&rsquo;s articles on the schools which provide great information, but makes it that much harder.  I still need to visit NY by the end of this week to make a final decision.  I&rsquo;m leaning towards SVA and Art Center b/c they have great faculty.  And, I would love to intern in NY to build my resume.  But as a Bay Area native, I&rsquo;m not sure if I could handle the weather in NY or Pasadena b/c I don&rsquo;t like hot or cold weather.  That&rsquo;s just a small thing.</p>
<p>Also, I&rsquo;m thinking if I should just stay in the Bay Area and attend CCA to cut cost on living.</p>
<p>Decisions, decisions!!  I have to calm myself down b/c I get excited, but nervous.  I want to make the best decision for myself and my career.</p>

<p>That’s a very good idea. There’s really no good reason to assume that this recession will be over by the time you graduate—you’re better off to assume it will be a long depression and borrow as little money as possible.</p>
