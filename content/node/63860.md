  to understand the classification of sans-serif typefaces, but more specifically
  that of the Grotesque.\r\n\r\nThe early British design shown in the example has
  clearly different qualities to say a typeface like Univers.\r\n\r\nIs anybody aware
  of any better classification systems? because to my eye, Helvetica, Univers should
  not be in this category.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nFenton"

    your \"modern\" way of classification of fonts sometimes seem to me like a game,
    who finds the most dusty and cloudy adjectives to describe a font. I like facts.
    So the DIN 16 518 is a solution with some disadvantages, but it worked well for
    40 years of letterpress. So why not today, too?\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorg\r\n_______________________________________________\r\n\u201EIch

  body: "Hello all,\r\n\r\nThanks for the input!\r\n\r\nI managed to track down an
    earlier definition taken from Wikipedia in 2007 which clearly puts Helvetica and
    Univers in the Neo-grotesque category,  this seems to be a little more logical
    now. \r\n\r\n(We corrected Wiki also)\r\n\r\nFor those of you raising the Grotesque
    v Grotesk issue; it seems the German term Grotesk originally stems from the British
    word Grotesque (definite origins slightly cloudy). But today is used more as an
    umbrella term for what the British might call (or Wiki) the Sans-serif category.\r\n\r\nTo
    nick, thanks for your comments, although i feel slightly more comfortable with
    this definition?\r\nAlthough i do wonder why the British Grotesques developed
    those certain characteristics, such as the slightly concave endings and contrasting
    thicks and thins?\r\n\r\nAnybody got a theory on this. I did hear it might be
    remnants of traces left-over from calligraphic types? or maybe an attempt to simulate
    a certain primitive quality?\r\n\r\nI wonder what you guys thought?\r\n\r\nThanks
    again."

    conceivably be a phyllogenetic term, but it would have to relate to the Modernist

    to De Stijl and Purism. \r\n\r\nAre we not in the post-modern era? So why not
    have typefaces that belong to multiple categories?\r\nIsn't that the way that
    metadata now works, in keywording at various websites?\r\n"
