body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm new to posting on this forum, but I've been a lurker for quite
  some time. I'm currently designing a personal logo for myself which reads \"Leems\".
  There's a long story behind how Leems came about, but simply stated, it's short
  for my nickname \"Lemur\". I've been browsing through various type catalogs from
  various design houses, but I want to know if any of you might know of a font with
  which \"Leems\" would look interesting.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nDavid"

  body: That seems like an intensley personal project, it should reflect YOU in what
    type you choose/choose to modify.

  body: "Since lemurs have huge eyes, whatever font I chose I might replace\r\nthe
    semi-circle top counters in the \"e\"s with (slghtly low) circles.\r\nMaybe even
    replace the whole tops of the \"e\"s with an oval shape\r\nwith a circle in it.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    that I like, but I'd still like to get some suggestions.
