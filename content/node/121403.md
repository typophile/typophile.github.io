    body: "Okay, I found it! It's a Photo-Lettering typeface called Millstein Guild.
      Never digitized, as far as I can tell. (Not to be confused with Millstein Flourish,
      which HAS been digitized.) Here it is, in PL's One Line, 1971.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/type_4239.png]"

  body: "Good find. So now we know this was a Photo-Lettering font designed by lettering
    artist W.M. Millstein.\r\n\r\nHouse Industries now owns the Photo-Lettering archives
    and is    s l o w l y    releasing fonts from this source. Less than a hundred
    so far or out of perhaps out of over six thousand possible fonts.  More info  http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-51626.html\r\n\r\nIt
    might be quite a wait, unless you ask them to make you a custom font, which would
    probably be quite expensive https://www.photolettering.com/contact/\r\n\r\nPhoto-Lettering
    published only a \"font in use phrase\" at a scale that clearly showed font details.
    Apparently some of the later catalogs, which I have not seen, included an 8 point
    character set to supplement the larger scale phrase. With some careful interpolation
    based on the larger scale phrase an outside font maker could make a digitization
    that was a fairly close match. \r\n\r\nUnder intellectual property law, at least
    in the US, fontmakers are not blocked from making digital versions of old printed
    typefaces, unless they are the subject of a design patent, which currently has
    a term of 14 years, if I recall correctly. Millstein Guild was produced many years
    ago, so there is definitely no design patent in force. Digital outlines are protected
    as software and copying these into a new font is illegal font piracy. Font names
    are protected by copyright and or trademark, so fonts based on old typefaces must
    have different names.\r\n\r\nIf we are in luck a Typophile who has access to a
    Photo-Lettering catalog that includes the 8 point character set for Millstein
    Guild might post an image here. \r\n\r\nDon\r\n"
