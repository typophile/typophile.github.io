  body: "I don't think your inexperience is the problem. I don't think this is a common
    font. I checked my Sans Serif Font ID Guide with no luck, and several other searches
    had no luck at finding a sans with these features. The 't' and 'f' have unusual
    crossbars, and the 'e' counter shape is also a bit odd. I think a combination
    of these characteristics makes me think this may be an amateur design.\r\n\r\nHave
    you checked sans fonts at a free site such as Dafont?  \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    with almost humorous results. Why do they ask you for specific letter characteristics
    if they ignore your answers?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "This time I tried \"legible sans\" at MyFonts using 'stage flaky' as the
    sample text. It gave me 752 sans families to look at (<em>Note to Stewf: Once
    again I plead with you to have FontShop keep the sample text the same as each
    page of search results is displayed. PLEASE!</em>).\r\n\r\nI didn't find a match
    (I am convinced this must be from a small, obscure font source), but these were
    the most similar in terms of the specific key letter attributes and/or general
    appearance: \r\n\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/brassfonts/solo-sans/|Solo
    Sans]];\r\n\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/generica-condensed/|Generica
    Condensed]];\r\n\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/antagometrica/|Antagometrica]];\r\n\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/wiescherdesign/yang/|Yang]];\r\n\r\nand
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paragraph/galette/|Galette]]\r\n\r\nI would probably
    say that Yang, or Antagometrica, would give the most similar look, but really
    none of these choices is especially close. This style is a bit hard to categorize,
    because it almost has a hand-drawn lettering feel.\r\n\r\nI'm really curious if
    anyone else has any ideas. I think I have done as much as I can think to find
    it. I even looked for Israeli designers, but most of their fonts were Hebrew.\r\n\r\n\r\n

  body: "Mike,\r\n\r\nThank you for your tireless efforts. Wow. Much appreciated.
    And, you're right. I contacted an editor friend of mine who deals with the client
    in question and she said that the font is from a small Israeli foundry, although
    she couldn't remember its name.\r\n\r\nIf I manage to find out I'll be sure and
    post it here.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nMark\r\n\r\n"
