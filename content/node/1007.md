  Drysdale and Hathaway. Now, anyone familiar with 60s TV kitsch will recognize from
  <a href="http://www.timvp.com/beverlyh.html" target="_blank"> whence</a> they came.
  <BR> <BR>If I were to market these together in a package, does anyone foresee a
  phone call from the CBS legal department in my future? <BR> <BR>If so, I&#39;d rather
  avoid such a headache and simply re-name the fonts. <BR> <BR>On a side note: Has
  anyone here ever named and released a font only to discover that name in use by
  another font? <BR> <BR>'

    that carry the same name. <BR>none of them were licensed by a big foundry though,
    so i didn&#39;t get into any legal bull ... yet. <BR> <BR>simon'

    might be. <BR>Lucas is NOTORIOUS for pursuing copyright offenders. <BR> <BR>I
    remember in highschool I had a friend who registered <a href="http://www.ilovestarwars.com"
    target="_blank">www.ilovestarwars.com</a>, not long after getting the site up
    and running -- which in that time era a website was pratically foriegn to most
    -- they slapped him with a cease and desist. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif"

  body: I&#39;d disagree. You <i>can</i> use the names for fonts  <BR>&#40;Drysdale,
    etc.&#41; provided no existing trademark  <BR>exists in a similar trade channel.
    However, you can&#39;t <BR>use &#34;Beverly Hillbillies&#34; Font Pak or something
    because  <BR>BH is a registered trademark in various classes <BR>and they&#39;d
    get you for diluting the mark. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>bj

  body: I second what BJ said. &#34;Beverly Hillbillies&#34; is a trademark, so using
    that might be a problem. But the names of characters on the show are not trademarked;
    additionally, they are generic, common surnames. <BR> <BR>Besides, look how many
    unrelated movies and TV shows have the same titles. <BR> <BR>Paul

  body: 'BJ, Paul: I tend to agree. They will not be marketed as the &#34;Beverly
    Hillbillies Font Pak&#34;. In fact, I doubt they will be packaged together at
    all. <BR> <BR>I will post the fonts soon &#40;hopefully&#41; in the Critique section.
    Clampett, Bodine and Hathaway are relatively complete. Drysdale is giving me fits.
    Here is a sample: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/14629.gif"

  body: Drysdale is very cool. <BR> <BR>Looks very 50s, like something you&#39;d see
    on Boutique or Hair Salon adverts. <BR> <BR>The D is very Disneyish though, I&#39;d
    say to make an alternate version of it at the least because Disney does not like
    anything even remotely connected with anything they own.
