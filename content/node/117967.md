  body: "Based on experience with checking out other romance novel covers, my suspicion
    is that this is a custom effort by the publisher. Perhaps just these letters were
    produced, perhaps a full uppercase alphabet. \r\nCharles Borges de Oliveira's
    Desire http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/charlesborges/desire/ can give you similar
    effects.\r\nDon"
