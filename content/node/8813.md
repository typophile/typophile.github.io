  body: 'The letters in &#34;ARCHITETTURE&#34; are so far apart that spacing tweaks
    are nearly irrelevant. But I think there&#39;s a bigger problem: the word is not
    sitting comfortably under &#34;pbastudio&#34;. I might align the bottom with the
    bottom of the &#34;p&#34;, but a bigger issue is the lateral placement, like how
    the terminal &#34;E&#34; doesn&#39;t know where it&#39;s supposed to be compared
    to the &#34;o&#34;. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: 'I&#39;m not sure which is better. You should ask a logo designer.  :-&#41;
    <BR> <BR>And I didn&#39;t realize the spacing of &#34;pbastudio&#34; was also
    up for tweaking: <BR>I would either tighten the &#34;stu&#34; or loosen the &#34;udio&#34;
    - probably the former. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: Hrandt is right about loosening the &#34;udio&#34;. I also think the &#34;b-a&#34;
    can be tightened just a hair. I prefer the positioning of &#34;ARCHITETTURE&#34;
    aligned with the bottom of the &#34;p&#34;, but the &#34;E&#34; is hanging out
    just a little too far. I&#39;d bring it in so that the &#34;E&#34; lines up to
    the outside of the &#34;O&#34; optically, rather than mathmatically. <BR> <BR>Aloha!

    to align the bottom of ARCHITTECTURE with the bottom of the descender of the P
    and move just a little bit this word to the left. The E seems  not optically align
    with the O. <BR> <BR>This will help the entire logo. <BR> <BR>Andr
