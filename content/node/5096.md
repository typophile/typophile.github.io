body: What&#39;s wrong with my computer?  I&#39;ve been getting error messages a lot
  lately related to GDI.EXE  &#40;last night--after an especially long FontLab session
  I might add--my screensaver wouldn&#39;t even come on, the problem was attributed
  to GDI.EXE&#41;.  Can anyone enlighten me?

  body: GDI is the Graphic Device Interface, which is the core Windows graphics engine
    responsible for representing graphical objects and transmitting them to output
    devices, such as monitors and printers. I don&#39;t know what kind of problem
    you might be having with GDI but you could try <BR> <BR>a&#41; backing up your
    computer, <BR>b&#41; using your Windows insatller CDs to repair your system.

  body: Yeah!, it doesn&#39;t give me a very good feeling in the pit of my stomach...
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll try all of those options shortly.  It&#39;s not a debilitating
    problem &#40;not yet anyway&#41;; I first noticed it when I created a TrueType
    file that included a codepoint not found in the standard Latin codepage.  I selected
    the font in Word and it gave me no error message; I then selected the file in
    WordPerfect and it could not open it, saying &#34;Error--Cannot use GDI object.  The
    most probable reason is insufficient memory.&#34; <BR> <BR>And like I said, now
    it&#39;s moved on to other functions &#40;but it&#39;s okay again once I reboot
    the computer&#41;.  Anyway, I&#39;ll try the suggestions.  Thanks guys.

  body: 'Windows ME. <BR> <BR>I should add that, in addition to the GDI.EXE error,
    I frequently get other errors:  DIBENG.DLL, USER.EXE, TypeTool2.EXE, etc. <BR>
    <BR>I only noticed the problems once I started performing heavy vectorization
    functions, and not just in FontLab programs--CorelDraw8, CorelPhotopaint8, AI10.  Again,
    any heavy graphics applications. <BR> <BR>To tell you the truth, I think my system
    might be a tad too weak for the operations I&#39;m performing.  I&#39;ll open
    three or four of the programs I listed above, copy and paste between all of them,
    minimize, save, cut &#40;not to mention 7 or 8 ellipse-contours in FontLab all
    at once trying to become an &#34;s&#34;&#41;.   <BR> <BR>Maybe I&#39;m trying
    to do too much, too fast--that&#39;s when the problems occur.'

  body: Perhaps later I&#39;ll install Ram-page and see if that helps me out &#40;based
    on the message mentioning both &#34;GDI&#34; and &#34;insufficient memory&#34;
    in the same sentence&#41;. <BR> <BR>BTW, John, I&#39;ve always been interested
    in Sequoya&#39;s syllabary--is it something that YOU are working on?  I look forward
    to hearing more on the subject.

  body: I&#39;m not working on the Cherokee syllabery. Native North American languages,
    to date, are Ross&#39; department. His Plantagenet Cherokee now ships with OS
    X, and I believe it will also ship with the next version of Windows.
