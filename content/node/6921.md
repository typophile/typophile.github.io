  What is the next step to release it through a reputable foundry? <BR> <BR>Q2&#41;
  Would it be appropriate to show samples from incomplete fonts? It think I would
  be more motivated to finish a font if I thought I could sell it. '

    that one myself. The people at MyFonts.com have been very helpful in sending me
    information for selling through their service. <BR> <BR>As far as Q2&#41;, I say
    go for it! The disclaimer at the top of the Critique Forum points out that there
    is neither any font too complete nor too incomplete to post to the forum. And
    for the rest of us, I know we all check several times a day to see if any knew
    font has been posted. ;&#41; &#40;Well, okay -- I know I do, anyway. And people
    say I don&#39;t have a life.... :D Hah! What do they know? ;&#41; &#41; <BR> <BR>David '

    that: <BR>1. You know how to do the different things <BR>   necessary in type
    design, like kerning <BR>   weight compensation, odd sorts, etc. <BR>   But you
    don&#39;t to carry &#42;all&#42; of that <BR>   out to get their attention.  <BR>2.
    You need to show an understanding of what <BR>   you need to do to make your font
    salable, <BR>   including the committment to finish it. <BR>And note that some
    font houses &#40;like Bitstream&#41; <BR>will finish the font for you. <BR> <BR>BTW,
    I&#39;ve personally become partial to MyFonts. <BR> <BR>Joe: <BR>What fun is that?
