  the recognition pages didn't get it either.\r\n\r\nThe sample says \"E l B a o\".
  I've seen this fon in one or two places already so, I think it's a famous one.\r\n\r\nIt's
  a bold/curly/fantasy font. I suspect it's a free one.\r\n\r\nCan anybody help?\r\n\r\n\r\nGonSch"

    Who gains what out of that? Why help Gonzalo (a member for less than one day)
    at the expense of Rubin (who went to the trouble of making Fajita) and legitimate
    font sellers? Is the pleasure of IDing fonts more important than supporting the
    design of fonts? On Typophile? And does something have to be a secret to avoid
    promoting it? Bank robbery isn't a secret either.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    <strong>Dangerously</strong> close to a plagiarized version of Fajita (it is on
    the page you pointed to in your 18 May 2013 \u2014 1:40pm comment in this post).\r\n\r\nFor
    now, I\u2019m going to let this stand as an example (I may edit at my discretion).
    I would also recommend you exercise better judgement in the future. See below:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FandJ_4678.jpg]\r\n<em>Figure

    have some fonts that are or appear to be rip-offs. Some references to sites that
    notoriously make available pirated fonts are routinely edited by moderators.\r\n\r\nThe
    question at hand is when does a site (or do pages on a site) become blacklisted?
    As of right now, there are 3,380 references to dafont on Typophile.\r\n\r\nShould
    we ban references to Google searches also?"
