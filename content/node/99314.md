  for different languages, characters for testing purposes? I'd like to copy/paste
  those strings in the preview panel of FL to test characters with diacritics, special
  characters, numerals, punctuation marks, and so on, but I can't seem to find all
  the needed characters for the languages I need.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
