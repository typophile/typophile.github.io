body: So I was selecting some nodes while holding down shift and I accidentally clicked
  around the baseline while still holding down shift and dragged out what appears
  to be a second baseline. What could this be used for? When right-clicked, you can
  access a properties panel that shows "Baseline position." I couldn't find anything
  in the Manual about it.

  body: "Seems like that question came up here a few years ago, but I don't remember
    what the explanation was. I don't see it when I use FontLab. \r\n\r\nThe Baseline
    Properties panel appears because you right-clicked on the baseline. It may not
    have anything to do with that little symbol."

    origin, something I've never wanted to move in my life, this second baseline happens
    to me all the time. (if you don't want an extra baseline, you have to put it back
    at y = zero or else).\r\n\r\nTo prevent accidental selection of these guides,
    go to the expanded view of the layers palette and 'lock' \"glyph metrics\". \r\n\r\nNow
    you have to unlock that any time you want to change the set width of the character,
    but the guides on the guides layer won't get in the way of your editing on the
    character layer. \r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n"

  body: Oh, I see now. Guess I've never had that accident. What would be the purpose
    of a secondary baseline?

  body: Holding down the shift key and dragging the baseline will yield what is shown
    in the graphic. It can be done twice. These are vertical advance widths for asian
    scripts that set vertically. Top and bottom side bearings if you will. It is there
    in the FL manual.
