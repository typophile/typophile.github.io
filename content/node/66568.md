body: "What I am about to describe is a bit out of there in terms of sitting firmly
  in the domain of nitpicking and obsessing over stuff that does not matter. Still,
  any input or thoughts are greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nI need some help with rounding
  up alternatives to <a href=http://www.daltonmaag.com/browse/fonts/dama/effra/>Effra</a>.
  I was planning to use it as a primary typeface for one of my online projects, but
  the foundry is really dragging their feet with regards to any sort of online usage
  licensing.\r\n\r\nI have searched extensively for the alternatives and arrived at
  <a href=http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/exljbris/museo-sans/>Museo Sans</a>, <a href=http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/avenir/>Avenir</a>
  and <a href=http://www.dardenstudio.com/typefaces/omnes>Omnes</a>. Museo and Omnes
  permit the use of the type with <href=http://wiki.github.com/sorccu/cufon/about>Cufon</a>,
  and Avenir <em>appears</em> to permit it too judging by a number of high-profile
  websites that use it that way.\r\n\r\nHere's Museo rendered in Firefox 3.0:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sample-museo-sans_4133.png]\r\n\r\nAnd
  here's Effra:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sample-effra_4448.png]\r\n\r\nCompared
  to Museo Effra feels.. erm.. \"smoother\" and friendlier. It looks almost as if
  it is rounded even though it's not. \r\n\r\nCompared to Omnes it looks less rounded
  and through this less playful and \"web 2.0\"-ish. \r\n\r\nCompared to Avenir it
  actually looks almost the same, except that it is considerably more compact. And
  the x-height is larger.\r\n\r\nIn any case, if any of this makes any sense, any
  thoughts on what other typefaces are worth looking at ?\r\n"

  body: "I doubt Linotype really allows Cufon in their license.\r\n\r\nIf you're open
    to other methods, <a href=\"http://typekit.com/fonts/329\">Apertura</a> or <a
    href=\"http://typekit.com/fonts/106\">Proxima Nova</a> might be good alternatives."

  body: "I suspect you are right about Linotype license. I emailed them over the weekend,
    hopefully they will respond.\r\n\r\nAperture looks excellent, thanks a lot for
    the pointer, Stephen. Proxima Nova is no less excellent and I did look at it,
    but I need something with a bit smaller x-height.\r\n\r\nRegarding the Typekit
    - this is not a practical option for another 2-3 years, that is until the share
    of older browser drops below fairly small threshold. I myself see the pages you
    linked to rendered in Georgia. sIFR is not really an option too given the proliferation
    of Flash blockers. So it is either no custom fonts or the Cufon.\r\n"

  body: Wait, you're using something older than <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/typekit/topics/typekit_browser_support">Firefox
    3.5, Safari 3.1, or IE 6</a>?

  body: I am on FF 3.0, but it doesn't really matter. It's the rest of the Internet
    population with older browsers that renders Typekit infeasible at the moment.
    See for example <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Msieshare1>the split
    between IE versions</a> that is still a dominating browser.

  body: Typekit is supported in IE 6 and above. That would be 99.95% according to
    that table.

  body: "Just to be clear, the Typekit web app that you use to select your fonts and
    apply them to your website doesn't currently support Internet Explorer. We focused
    on making a great experience for web designers and developers, and the majority
    of them use Firefox, Chrome, or Safari in their day-to-day work. We'll get IE
    support there soon.\r\n\r\nBut that's separate from what browsers support @font-face.
    We serve EOT fonts all the way back to IE5, and support every other browser that
    implements the technology (with the exception of Opera 10, because of pretty significant
    bugs in their handling of fonts.) \r\n\r\nFor the full story, see this post in
    our support forums:\r\n\r\nhttp://getsatisfaction.com/typekit/topics/typekit_browser_support"

  body: Oh, so the "Typekit web app" is basically the Typekit website itself... I
    honestly would've never guessed that by reading the linked page. Thanks for the
    clarification.

  body: "I've gotta say that it is <em>really</em> impressive. \r\n\r\nYou guys should
    really put a dead simple list of supported browsers in the top center of the homepage.
    Because right now those visiting the website with the IE or older FF, see that
    it's not working, and are given the message \"your browser is not supported\".
    I am betting that 99% of people who see it would interpret the message as \"TypeKit
    does not work with your browser\". End of story, you lost them. Those who do click
    on the link in the message see two cryptic paragraphs dealing with mysterious
    \"web app\". I'd say the chance of loosing them there as well is nearly 100%.
    FWIW you lost me and I am a technical person.\r\n\r\nGreat stuff nonetheless,
    kudos."
