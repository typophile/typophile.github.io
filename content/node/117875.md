  body: "Agree. Hard to say at this size. From what I could see (or imagine):\r\n-
    extended sans: Trade Gothic Extended, Akzidenz Grotesk Extended, Helvetica Neue
    Extended, Univers Extended\r\n- /C with parallel terminals: works for all previous
    suggestions except Akzidenz Grotesk Extended\r\n- /M with central vertex on baseline:
    all suggestions good\r\n- /E: top and bottom bar at same width, central bar vertically
    centered and shorter; all good again\r\n- /R straight leg: all good except Helvetica
    Neue and Univers\r\nWith these earmarks, that let us [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/trade-gothic/bold-extended-63882|Trade
    Gothic Extended Bold]] but still not enough bold (or manually emboldened with
    an outline stroke?)... Last option would be to start with [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/neue-haas-grotesk/std-display-75-bold|Neue
    Haas Grotesk Display Bold]] using the [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/neue-haas-grotesk/std-display-75-bold/glyphs.html#glyphs/613191/315|alternate
    straight leg /R]] and manually stretching it a bit."
