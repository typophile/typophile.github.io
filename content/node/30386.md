  a portfolio for my applications to grad school for graphic design, but my background
  is in architecture. i need some guidance on which font to use for my name. my goal
  is to convey a focused sense of simplicity and intelligence that is personalized
  enough to be memorable. so far i've narrowed it down to minion pro and perpetua
  for the name, and myriad pro light for portfolio 2007.\r\n\r\nif anyone has any
  other font/kerning suggestions, i'd appreciate the help. thanks a lot.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/portfolio_UTcover1_3479.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/portfolio_UTcover2_5707.jpg]"

  body: Between these two, I'd go with Perpetua. Might want to kern the "Der" closer.
    Other than that, it looks pretty crisp and clean. Also, I might right align the
    "Portfolio 2007".

  body: "For the Perpetua version I would kern De, Po, ol and 07 a touch tighter.
    You could tie the two elements a bit more, if it remains ranged left, think about
    aligning the P with the stem of the D rather than mathematically flush to the
    serif, and either reducing the size to the width of Derek or using \u201907 rather
    than 2007 and enlarging it.\r\nTim "

    the end of the 7 line up with the serif or stem of the n. also, what about the
    width of 'portfolio 2007' in relation to my name?\r\n\r\nis the spacing better

  body: "Stem, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nThe width of 'Portfolio' is no problem and the
    spacing is perfect, but the space between 'Derek' and 'Chien' needs to be closer."

    better is to visually align it. The point of the 7 will actually point out a slight
    amount beyond the point you aling on."
