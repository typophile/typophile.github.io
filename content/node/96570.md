  body: "> Why TT (TrueType) vs. PS (Postscript)?\r\n\r\nThe only reason for adding
    the suffix TT was to make the two font names different. Fonts with identical font
    names cannot be used on the same system.\r\n\r\nHinting differences between TT
    and PS fonts are irrelevant here, because the offset plate-making raster image
    processor discards all TT and PS hints, which are not required for the high resolution
    of 1000 dots per cm (which is equal to 2540 dots per inch)."

    of reading books typeset in small point sizes with a microscope, you will not
    see any difference, if the imagesetter dropped the hints, provided that the offset
    lithography printing plate was produced with a computer-to-plate imagesetter with
    a resolution of 2540 dots per inch (= 1000 dots per centimeter)."

    it's not very descriptive.\r\n\r\nBTW a related idea that I find useful is when
    a font can be made uniwidth with another when a specific tracking value is applied.
    For example a Bold that becomes uniwidth with the Roman when a tracking of -10
    is applied (something I've done in my Patria, and we almost pulled off in Ernestine).
    I've been calling that \"fixed offset\".\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    on the same set of matrices. The most common pairing was certainly a Roman with
    corresponding Italic. But you also had Roman duplexed with Bold. \r\n\r\nAnd you
    had special setups like a body text duplexed with gothic for certain kinds of
    work \u2014 like Corona with Erbar Bold, for example, or Excelsior with Memphis
    Bold.\r\n\r\nSo, duplexing is uniwidth for two."
