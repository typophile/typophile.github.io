  sans-serif (like <a href=\"http://typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100008\">Gotham</a>
  or <a href=\"http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/proximanova.html\">Proxima Nova</a>)
  that had an alternate character set with colorful swashes, like Caslon or Garamond
  do. \r\n\r\nI frequently find myself wanting to set headlines in a strong, simple
  face and then dress up one or two letters; if I had such a font in my back pocket,
  I think it could happen. I'd appreciate any leads!"

  body: "The rather static nature of sans typefaces makes it tricky \u2026 but it\u2019s
    an interesting idea. Do you think of alternate capitals or lowercase? Just alternate
    glyph shapes or elaborate swashy tails on it \u2013?"

  body: "Thank you, Andreas, J, and nina! I guess what I'm really looking for is something
    akin to a digitized <a href=\"http://userhappiness.com/blog/all-the-fun-of-helvetica-flair/\">Helvetica
    Flair</a>. \r\n\r\nI don't love working in Helvetica except for certain kinds
    of projects (and as far as I know, Helvetica Flair is both undigitized and somewhat
    unholy), so I just wondered if anyone had seen fit to make a good solid constructed
    sans-serif with confident, over-the-top swashes like those."
