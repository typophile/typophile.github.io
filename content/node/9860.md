  body: '&#34;This fanciful typeface was designed by resident Letraset designer Michael
    Gills and is based on the famous French Ronde script. Created entirely on screen,
    Fling has a precise, clinical appearance. The capitals are for initialling purposes
    only and support a lowercase that is rich in alternative and ligatured letterforms.
    Also included is a host of attractive embellishment devices. An ideal choice for
    work requiring the use of a highly legible script.&#34; <BR> <BR>...Fling has
    a precise, clinical appearance. <BR> <BR>mmmmm....what is clinical appearance?
