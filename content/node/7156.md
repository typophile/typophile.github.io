  body: Lucia,  <BR> <BR>I agree -- this is simply a horrible and stupid limitation
    of OpenType. I really would like to know the person&#39;s name who developed the
    part of the OpenType specification that limited the size of a GPOS subtable to
    64KB. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"
    BORDER=0>  <BR> <BR>I believe Thomas Phinney should have a solution on that problem.
    I hope he sees that and replies.  <BR> <BR>Regards,  <BR>Adam

  body: I think that yes, you need one or more subtable breaks. I know how to do them
    in the FDK, but I&#39;m not sure how to do them in FontLab. Unfortunately, for
    the next week or more, I&#39;m going to be busy finishing up some presentations
    and then travelling, so I don&#39;t have time to dig into this properly. <BR>

    but fortunately there is an easy workaround. <BR> <BR>So your kern feature might
    look like this: <BR> <BR>pos T a -50; <BR>pos T c -55; <BR>subtable; <BR>pos T

  body: Aha! <BR>I&#39;ve wondered about this myself. Very helpful. <BR> <BR>On a
    related note, has anyone ever noticed that while previewing <BR>class based kerning
    in the OT preview window, FontLab will <BR>apply a small amount of kerning to
    a glyph within a class even <BR>if kerning has not been defined for the glyph?
    For instance, <BR>the &#34;ta&#34; pair within the OT preview window will appear
    to have <BR>kerning even though I haven&#39;t applied kerning to &#34;ta&#34;.
    I have <BR>however defined a kerning class for &#34;a&#34; and related accents.
    <BR>If i generate the font and check it in InDesign the kerning <BR>for the phantom
    pair of &#34;ta&#34; doesn&#39;t appear. This appears <BR>to happen with any of
    my kerning classes within the OT <BR>preview window. Hope this makes sense.

    It comes up when I&#39;m using opentype classes. If this is my &#39;kern&#39;
    feature... <BR> <BR>feature kern { <BR>  pos [B] @_kernO2 16; <BR>  pos [A] @_kernO2
    -12; <BR>  pos @_kernO1 @_kernI2 -12; <BR>} kern; <BR> <BR>and this are my classes...
    <BR> <BR>@_kernI2 = [B D E F H I K L P R]; <BR>@_kernO1 = [D O Q]; <BR>@_kernO2
    = [C G O Q]; <BR> <BR>I&#39;d expect the space between A and C to get smaller
    but instead it gets larger when I activate the &#39;kern&#39; feature in the opentype
    preview. The kern occurs correctly in illustrator though, which is terribly frustrating
    because taking a round-trip to illustrator to check my class based kerning is
    not acceptable, but this seems to be the only way to check if I&#39;ve coded my
    kern feature correctly.

    you will be back again, I would be gratefull if you could explain more. How Adobe
    fonts manage to have this feature? By the way I have opened the Minion Pro &#40;with
    both greek and cyrillic&#41; and if I compile the OT features I get the same error
    message. Does this font behave correctly with the apllications? <BR> <BR>Best

    to indicate that a class is intended to be first or second of a kerning pair,
    I'd precede it by underscore or better by period. This makes it easier to spot
    suffices and maybe to search/replace them. Just in case.\r\n_z.1 then will be
    marked as leftside pair, _z.2 as rightside pair either in FLS5's Classes panel
    or Kerning Assistance panel.\r\n\r\nThis however addresses only overlapping of

    Kerning. If I save it as a font I get a billion kerning gpos errors.  Well actually
    only one cause one is all you need to break the font.\r\n\r\nI'm not even finished

    out of curiosity. It's about 60,000 kern pairs stored that way. It takes ten minuets

    the Russian language probably and kerned them. Big mistake probably cause later
    I accidentally added several of those to kerning classes. There is no tools to
    find the errors so it's welcome to hell..\r\n\r\nOk I exported the kerning data
    and deleted everything that looked odd. Single pair kerns keeping the classed
    based intact. Next I imported it and flattened the table then re-compressed it.
    Eureka ! I managed to save 576,536 pairs. Not bad, I lost about 20,000 or so.
    Better than losing it all by far.. I managed to save 4280 classed based pairs.\r\n\r\nI
    tried a million different ideas and this was the only thing that worked..  The

  body: "Ok figured it out eventually. I'll put the solution here.\r\n\r\nThe deal
    and how I got there. Too many sub tables cause I did the kerning not in the correct
    order. Do the classes then the sub classes then the singles. Don't mix and match.
    \r\n\r\nThat was problem Number 2. Reading Adobe's site it alludes to the fact
    that more than 6 subtables is a point of diminished returns. It does not say it
    will not compile. More than 6 you will get GPOS errors. Doing things not in the
    correct order maybe needlessly be generating subtables when they may in fact not
    be necessary. Why I got there was when I was using the font and noticed a kerning
    error I just fixed it so it would not go unrepaired. I thought I may never find
    it again or forget it ever existed. Avoid that habit at all costs.  Write it down
    and just kern the classes. Check later and see if it is still there and fix it
    then only.\r\n\r\nProblem Number 1.. Too many class kerns. I experimented to find
    out what is the max possible and still get it to compile. 15,000 is the magic
    number. Could be slightly higher but it will not compile 16,000. I had over 32,000..\r\n\r\nWhat
    to do, what to do.... Gave up, started again. I readjusted the matrics to eliminate
    as many pairs as possible then re-kerned the font. I ended up with many more kern
    classes but fewer overall kerned pairs when I was done, less than 15,000 now.
    \ It compiles, not a single error. This is a hand kerned font. There is no auto
    kern with this one. That was a lot of work to toss away.\r\n\r\nIt's actually
    not a Fontlab problem, but there is a lack of understanding of it  so there is
    a lack of documentation on it. Fontlab uses Adobe's system to compile the font.
    The error is being generated by the Adobe part. \r\n\r\nI asked Fontlab and there
    answer was we don't also get why that error comes up.\r\n\r\nThere is one more
    thing I didn't get. I figure who cares so you got more than 32,000 class kerns
    just set it to only export so many pairs.. Nope, if you have that many pairs in
    the source it will not compile don't matter if you set it to export only two single
    pairs. You have to have 15,000 or less before that other part of the program even
    kicks in.\r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure if you kern the font in the correct order you
    will only have two subtables. Single pair kerning then a subtable for sub class
    kerning then a subtable for class kerning in that order.   \r\n\r\nAnd now you
    know.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n"
