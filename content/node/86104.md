body: "Help needed: Opentype multiple characters substitution workaround ?!\r\nHi
  everybody,\r\n\r\nI\u2019m currently developing a revival of a cursive fat face,
  created by famous Bulgarian type designer Milka Peykova in the mid-70s. Her design
  was based on Fran\xE7ois Boltana\u2019s Stilla, but feels a bit different (not to
  speak that it has complete Cyrillic character set, but no Latin, so it had to be
  \u201Dinterpolated/reimagined\u201D). So as you all know the *F* *f* of Boltana\u2019s
  script may cause some inconveniences, even in loose spacing, but Peykova\u2019s
  design is much more tightly spaced. This creates a big disturbance in the font\u2019s
  rhythm (ball terminal to next letter leaving a big hole...). So I had two choices,
  either to completely redesign the F,f (which didn\u2019t wanted) or to rely heavily
  on f-ligatures (ff fi fl \u2013 being common and the uncommon fr ft fo fa fe fu
  fy \u2026. etc.). \r\n\r\nSo to the problem\u2026 \r\n\r\nAfter completing all the
  f-ligatures (plus all the Opentype coding) it all worked flawlessly until I faced
  another problem \u2013 (thus speaking a non-Latin language) I somehow \u201Cforgot\u201D
  that combinations like ffo ffe ffu \u2026 etc. are possible. \r\nSo I created a
  f_component - being the first f in the ligature ff(sometnig), trying to achieve
  all the possible combinations trough coding \u2013 f_comp + (some already-made f-lifgature).
  \r\n\r\nI know that the liga function allows substitution of the following:\r\n\r\nsub
  A B C by D \r\nor\r\nsub A by B C D\r\n\r\nbut can somebody show me a workaround
  for the following\r\n\r\nsub A B C by D E\r\n...menaning\u2026\r\nsub f f f by f_component
  f_e\r\n\r\nor do I have to make all the possible combinations again, thus creating
  many more new gliphs ?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance!\r\n"

    substitutions to achieve similar effect, something like:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nlookup
    f_1st {\r\n  sub f by f_component;\r\n} f_1st\r\n\r\nlookup f_2nd {\r\n  sub f
    by f_e;\r\n} f_2nd;\r\n\r\nfeature calt { # or clig, support varies between engines\r\n
    \ sub f' lookup f_1st\r\n      f' lookup f_2nd\r\n      f;\r\n} calt;\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nWhich
    substitutes \"fff\" by \"f_component f_e f\"."

  body: "@Hosny Thank you! I'll try that out!\r\n\r\nI have a second question, currently
    I'm reading the following post [[http://typophile.com/node/6638]]about a similar
    problem.\r\n\r\nCould a ligature of ffe be achived in this way:\r\nif I have already
    build up a ligature of fe (f+e), culd it be that..\r\n\r\nfeature clig { \r\nsub
    f'fe by f_component; \r\n} clig; \r\n\r\nthus changing only the first f int the
    ffe to f_component?\r\n\r\n"
