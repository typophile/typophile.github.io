  based on this one, but it's from 2006 so not the original.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/conan3_5363.jpg]"

  body: There is also a <a href=http://www.conanthegame.com/>Conan the Barbarian</a>
    RPG game. Overall Conan is a gritty experience that really beckons to God of War
    with a litlte more gore.
