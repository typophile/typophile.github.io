  received an email from my sales director with <a href=\"http://www.rhards.co.uk/pics/Tuffnells.jpg\"
  target=\"new\">this</a> attachment, accompanied by the usual \"Is this <strong>artwork</strong>
  OK, or should we <strong>try</strong> to find something better?\"\r\n\r\nIt took
  me most of the rest of the day to get over that.< rant>\r\n\r\nRichard\r\nEDIT:
  I think I should make it clear that the attachment was the jpg of the screenshot,
  it isn't a screenshot I've made for the benefit of this post.\r\n\r\nAnyway I work
  on a PC\u2026 runs and hides."

  body: "i see that kind of stuff all day. some days more than others. it usually
    results in me throwing pencils, paper, books and swearing at my computer screen.
    i cant blame the people who pass it on to me to 'work' with it and 'tweak' it,
    but the idea of artwork or art these days has gotten so confused (in my opinion)...at
    least the terms artwork and art. i sometimes wonder if a person with not much
    art background/exposure sees no real difference in something that might have taken
    someone 6 months to complete vs. tuffnells parcels express logo thing. i guess
    it's all in what your trained to perceive...\r\n\r\nw|m"

  body: "This is why my hair has gone prematurely grey... You'd think the basics of
    typography would be taught in art and vocative schools, BUT they just are not.
    (I know, because my eldest son is in such a school -- they sit down the kids behind
    a computer and they can start 'designing'.)\r\nBefore turning all grumpy, here's
    what keeps me floating and sane: I care about the work I make. I do my best to
    keep to my own high standards and work hard to do that. And I try to just not
    care about all the crap that's done. Hard as that is (my denstist warns me not
    to gnash my teeth so much).\r\n\r\nAnyway, a lot can be improved by changing the
    awfull defaults of all that American (!) software we have to work with. So change
    those defaults to smaller wordspacing, disallow letterspacing and glyph distorting
    beyond a fraction of a percent, disable auto linespacing (20% auto leading --
    who ever made that up?), and so on.  AND take out and throw away the \"second
    and inch\" key on all keyboards. "

    intention was to head up the irony of a screenshot of an eps file being presented
    as \"artwork\".\r\n\r\nMy job is film production in a screen print company, so
    edge quality is paramount, and a 72dpi rgb jpg really doesn't cut the mustard.\r\n\r\nI
    find it easier not to worry too much about the aesthetic values  of the brands
    that I have work with(although Eurostile Bold Extended condensed to 40% does tend
    to wind me up a bit), rather I try to achieve professional satistaction from reproducing
    good product from dodgy materials.\r\n\r\nAnd spotting odd instances of Modena(Beta);-)\r\n\r\nRichard\r\n"
