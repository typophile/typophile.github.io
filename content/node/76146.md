body: "Today we advised a client to digitise his own handwriting so he can use it
  as part of his corporate identity. He likes the idea very much. I know of software
  and sites like yourfonts.com where you can upload your handwritten glyphs so they
  make a font out of it. It's under $10, not even a large amount when the result is
  awful. Have any of you had any experience with this site?\r\nMy main worry is that
  yourfonts.com creates a font solely made out of single characters, not out of sentences
  which will flow much more. \r\nI would like to do it myself, but perhaps using the
  yourfonts.com-font is a good starting point?\r\nSuppose I do it myself, what should
  I charge? Any ideas on how much time this will take?"

    small print.

    called iFont Maker.\r\nhttp://2ttf.com/\r\n\r\nI really love it and it works very
    well.\r\n\r\nand you can convert easily into a ttf file.\r\n"

    made.\r\n\r\nPerhaps your client could make the font on the iPad ap, and then
    you or someone else could fix up the metrics, tweak the glyphs a bit, if required
    and add a few alternates and charge for that part of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "@Simon: YourFonts.com says on their site that once the font is digitised
    you'll be able to sell it, so commercial use is not an issue.\r\n\r\n@Guiseppe:
    I know iFontMaker, but nor he nor I have an iPad (yet!)\r\n\r\n@Russell: I think
    your right (except for the iPad part which just isn't possible at the moment).
    I think I need to instruct my client to write some texts (Quick Brown Fox et cetera)
    as well as seperate characters, then scan it and rework it in FL."

  body: "A lot depends on how cursive the writing is.\r\nThese days, a good cursive
    handwriting font is a huge undertaking, due to the amount of OpenType contextualization
    that is now employed. However, if the writing is more like printing, with discrete
    letters, then it's a lot easier to make.\r\nPerhaps you could suggest your client
    writes in more of that style?"

  body: The problem with writing on a tablet is getting used to looking at the screen
    rather than ink line coming from the pen nib. It takes a while to get used to.
    I've used one for years and I still can't do anything that resembles my actual
    handwriting with it.

    can see if it's all discrete letters or cursive or a combination of the two.\r\nTo
