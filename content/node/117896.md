    of \"the contemporary Swiss style\"?\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Is the purpose to see
    if there's a correlation between geographic origin and style?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nNo.
    It's just a survey about the designers corpus.\r\nI'm expecting a book about it
    from the school [[http://www.ecal.ch/en/100/homepage|ECAL]]."

    Ludovic Balland. \r\n\r\nOff that style there\u2019s also <a href=\"http://abclitera.ch\">abclitera.ch</a>.
    \r\n(And yes, my stuff is also rather different :)\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s an overview
    of Swiss type design here: http://www.swisstypedesign.ch/\r\nNot entirely sure
    how up to date that is now. It does not list foundries but there\u2019s a designer
    listing: http://www.swisstypedesign.ch/designer/\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s also just
    been an issue of Slanted (#23) on Switzerland. \r\nhttp://www.slanted.de/magazine/current"
