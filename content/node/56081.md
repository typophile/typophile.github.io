  and I want to \"fill\" its glyph \"space\", as another character. The problem is:
  When I test an .otf on Adobe software, it looks ok, but when I break the text into
  curves, the glyph \"space\" simply disappears. The curious thing is that on Corel
  the glyph appears only when I break the text into curves. And in Office, it looks
  ok...\r\n\r\nI thought that was happening because of a bad/poor draw of the glyph,
  but it happens with anything I put there...\r\n\r\nAnyone have any idea on what
  happens with this glyph?! :-/\r\n\r\nI'm on a PC (Windows XP) using FontLab with
  the \"FreeFont\" encoding...\r\n\r\nBy the way, I'm attaching a preview image to
  show what I want from the glyph \"space\", just to illustrate my sad story... ;-)\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAnderson"

  body: "Interesting. I suspect that applications are making assumptions about /space/
    being an empty, invisible glyph. They're not making the same assumptions, but
    they are making assumptions, and you are seeing the symptoms of these assumptions.\r\n\r\nSince
    these assumptions are almost certainly character-level, not glyph-level, there
    is probably nothing you can do about this on the font end.\r\n\r\nYou might try
    encoding your shaded space glyph as something other than the space character (e.g.
    U+2592, medium shade), and inform users that if they want this shaded space, then
    they should search-and-replace for the space character."

    from Adobe/Corel would like to say something about our assumptions? :-)\r\n\r\nBy

    be considered a bug in the applications (though perhaps not a huge one, from the

    to another. You said \"Adobe software\": which specific application(s) and versions

    wrote. Do you think that because it retains the width between words/characters
    but drops it at the end of line, it's not a bug? Definitively it is a different
    behavior, but I think that, if the software is \"educated\" to \"see\" the space
    always as a blank space between characters, it's obvious that at the end of line
    it'll be \"dropped\", because it do not has any character at its left... :-)\r\n\r\nThe
    question -- I think -- is: these softwares take care of the content of the glyph
    space or they just get its width to do the thing? But maybe I'm completely wrong
    and it's all my fault with a dumb misconfiguration... Anyway, I'm \"attaching\"
    a new file (<a href=\"http://www.fictilia.org/stuff/SpaceIssue.otf\">SpaceIssue.otf</a>)
    to this post, in case someone want to do a quick test and share the experience...
    I suggest to write some words with spaces -- it will show as circles between the
    squares -- and then break it into curves to see if the circles (space) remains..."

    extra characters with the fill at the normal space width, en and em width, and

  body: Oops. I missed the 'break into curves' bit. I assumed it was 'text on a path'.
    If it's 'converting to outlines', then it's a bug, as you say, Thomas. On the
    other hand, why should we expect applications to convert outlines of spaces? Where,
    pray, is the outline for the already mentioned 'em' and 'en' spaces? Or perhaps
    an outline for a non-breaking space, which must be different from that of a normal
    one? Or a tab, line-feed, a hard return for that matter? Sorry, I am just kidding,
    it was  a long day.

    must be lots of characters on the keyboard that you could use for the (perhaps
    even different shades/textures) spaces? The lower case qwerty is six already:
    say 20% stipple, 40% stipple, 60% stipple, horizontal lines, vertical, diagonal?

    for four spaces in a row. When I hit the fifth, it don't works, and when I hit
    the sixth, it still shows just two 'fulls', and there it goes, showing just two
    'fulls'...\r\n\r\nSo I decided to stop the fight, leave the space empty and use
