body: "Hello, I am trying to identify a typeface for some design work to help me land
  a job. Specifically, the type that Range Rover uses in their advertising. It is
  very similar to Eurostile by Aldo Novarese, yet there are subtle differences. For
  instance, neither Eurostile nor Microgramma have a spur on the capital G. The typeface
  I'm looking for does. There is also a large difference in the ampersands between
  Eurostile and this unknown face. It also appears to be taller and less wide than
  Eurostile also.\r\n\r\nBelow is a screen-shot of the type. Thanks for any help in
  advance! :0)\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v105/VanDamage/?action=view&amp;current=Screenshot2012-01-23at41936PM.png\"
