body: "Dears,\r\n\r\nI used all the online tools available to detect this font. The
  closest match i have found is font named COMB.\r\nFor Uppercase letters it looks
  like as comb. But for lowercase letters COMB uses sans (dashes in letters: i, l
  etc)\r\nSo, basically i am having troubles with lowercase letters.\r\n\r\nThe image
  is from betting receipt in Turkey. A government owned lottery for football. I believe
  this is some kind of special font. Any help would be highly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance,\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hello urfan.alimov,\r\n\r\nThe logotype \"iddaa\" looks to be [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/helvetica/|Helvetica
    Bold]] or a variant of it such [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/neue-helvetica/|Helvetica
    Neue Bold]]. It's not perfectly printed, but that's the most probable typeface
    chosen.\r\n\r\nThe body text is a tough one. I ran it through [[http://www.identifont.com/similar?2LA|Identifont]]
    and that is the best result from my findings on there. It's a proportional, san-serif
    typeface typical of a receipt that's all I can see from it something similar to
    this imitation called [[http://www.fontspace.com/cumberland-fontworks/merchant-copy|Merchant
    Copy]]. I have also done some good, old Googling and encounter this [[http://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/20027/identify-these-fonts-used-on-receipts|thread]]
    on the graphics forum of the Stack Exchange. Have a read, it appears to suggest
    a font called [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/green-type/hypermarket/|Hypermarket]],
    which looks close to your receipt.\r\n\r\n-Inferno986return-"
