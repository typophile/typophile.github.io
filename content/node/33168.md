  a future world where all displays have this much detail. Would the digital and print
  seam of typography be wiped out? Will we have interactive 'print'? Or will something
  else weird happen? Like fonts embedded with enhancer animations that play whenever
  the font is loaded/seen. Or embedded complimentary voice overs for readers. We won't
  be designing typefaces anymore, people. Today is the dawn of the typebody.\r\n"

    running on OS 8 or 9, judging by the window appearance.

    about how the type would change if resolution were increased tenfold.

    me of this Sherlock Holmes cartoon I just saw on the web. Holmes deduces where
    a murder has just occurred by carefully following a bullet's trajectory to a house
    across the street. Watson tells him he already had figured that out because of
    all the police standing outside the house."

    screen density increases.\r\n\r\nAssuming most screens are around 100ppi at the
    moment, a 4 fold increase to 1600ppi would be pretty damn close to high end printing
    on paper."

    to mean binary orders of magnitude, but I don't think that's what koleslaw meant.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    even though the eye seems to bottom out at 1000dpi when it comes to consciously
    detecting specific micro features, when it comes to things like equal counters
    in an \"m\" (think: hinting) or the texture/color of a block of small text the
    eye can quite easily detect the difference between 1200 and 2400dpi printing,
    so...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
