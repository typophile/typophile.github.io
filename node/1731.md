body: Are there any FontLab users out there that know how to round corners for all
  the glyphs in a font without changing the weight of the glyph? There is no simple
  transform that does this function.

    <BR>In very early FontLab &#41;2.5&#41; we had &#34;effect&#34; that was able
    to do what you want but it worked only with corners of two straight lines completely
    ignoring corners of curves. '

  body: Thanks Yuri. &#40;I was afraid you might say that!&#41; ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>I
    wonder if anyone has written such a script? It seems like it would be a very useful
    function.
