  him and I knew this was the best place to come. \r\n\r\n<strong> Questions 1:</strong>
  What software is out there for Macs to built fonts in? \r\n\r\n<strong>Questions
  2:</strong> Is there software out there that can be used to convert fonts across
  platforms? Most of the office is Mac based but a couple of people are PC and we
  need to have our fonts working on both.\r\n\r\nHe also wants a way of managing the
  fonts but I told him you can group fonts in font book and that gives you the ability
  to turn fonts on and off etc. I think he said he used to use Suitcase. \r\n\r\nThank
  you for the help in advance, \r\nE"

    (the latter freeware). \r\n2: I know Fontlab can convert fonts to other formats,
    but remember to read the EULA carefully as this \u2014 in most cases \u2014 isn\u2019t
    allowed. I\u2019m guessing the other two can as well. This is rarely an issue
    as both TT and OT is cross platform, at least with newer Macs."

    Forge.\r\n\r\nFontLab also sells an app called TransType specifically for converting
    between different formats."
