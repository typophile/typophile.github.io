  is a new upmarket dog grooming busines. \r\n- After playing around with lots of
  fonts i've used Goudy Old Style as I like the P, G and R. \r\n- I've tried to give
  the logo an 'old world opulent feel'\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Number 2 is a bit fussy I think, number 1 has the qualities you describe.
    The only concerns I might have are that it puts quite an emphasis on Dog, it might
    be worth looking at putting Dog Grooming on one line to move the emphasis to Sparkle.
    And on the swashes, this is difficult to describe, the S shape where it interacts
    with the centre piece could slightly curve more to tie it in better, and the heavier
    stroke on the centre could have a little more contrast, I would also be concerned
    about the small chevron reproducing well at smaller sizes.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "I agree with Tim on all points, especially that chevron, and those fiddly
    dots and the star.\r\n\r\nGoudy Old Style is a great font for this though: those
    \"O\"s look fabulous!"

  body: "Number 2 fits the idea better. \r\n\r\nIt looks gorgeous, but I worry that
    it won't work at extreme sizes. If it needs to be small \u201Ddog\u201D will remain
    readable and the rest will get too small to read, and at large sizes, \u201Cdog\u201D
    might become so large that it looks silly. "

  body: "Goudy Old Style is my all time favorite typeface. So well designed, so classical
    - and yet, still works in a modern world.\r\n\r\nYes, I like your type treatment.
    Easy to read, I get the point - will do well on a vertical business card.\r\n\r\nOne
    suggestion - I feel #1 is a bit plain and #2 is a bit overdressed. Have you considered
    using the true Goudy period (a lovely diamond) and placing that where you put
    only the top star (and remove the ... and other star) -- it's only a suggestion.\r\n\r\nI
    hope the client is thrilled with your final product. Good luck."

      idea, I'll give it a try."
