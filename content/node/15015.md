body: "This question goes out to the governing bodies of Typophile.\r\n\r\nEben Sorkin,
  Bruce Herbert and moi have been discussing the possibility of creating a Flash \"game\"
  (exercise is a better term) that would roughly simulate the ancient task of composing
  hand-set type, hence the name \"<a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/14525\">Upside
  Down & Backwards</a>.\"\r\nThis is one of a few educational or entertaining projects
  under discussion that might be of interest to design educators and graphic design
  students alike.\r\n\r\nWhen the project is finally completed, we would like to make
  it openly available for download from the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/forum/16\">Typographic
  Edumacators</a> section (a sadly under utilized topic area). The participants in
  the project look only for a credit line or such and want to know if Typophile is
  interested in holding the copyrights or intellectual property. I've noticed that
  the page footer declares \"\xA9 2000-2005 Typophile, All Rights Reserved. Typophile
  is a Punchcut gig.\"\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n-- Is the Typophile organization interested
  in hosting such projects?\r\n-- Is the Typophile organization a legal entity that
  can hold a copyright?\r\n-- Can we start some dialog on these issues before we procede
  any further?\r\n\r\nWe can follow up via email instead of through this topic if
  preferred.\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n"

    to transfer rights to Typophile? Also, you dont have to be a legal entity to retain
    copy rights.\r\n\r\nIf for some strange reason you wanted to transfer IP and rights
    to Typophile (which most likeley would either be Punchcut, or one or more of its
    owners), Typophile would comission 'work for hire', and the designers/developers
    would transfer all rights to them through this work for hire contract.\r\n\r\nI
    have a good amount of knowledge in the legality of copy rights and trademark law.
    Let me know if I can clarify anything."

    on the project, and no individual in the group should have a greater share of
    intellectual property rights.\r\n\r\nAlso, creating content and projects which
    can be hosted, distributed or downloaded from Typophile may eventually raise awareness
    of the organization as an educational resource beyond Forum topics and content.\r\n\r\nThis
    is just a thought which is open for debate. In previous threads there seemed to
    be interest in expanding the Typography Edumacators area into such a resource.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\r\nGee,

    not worrying that Typophile automatically confiscates content posted or contributed

    many large companies that have employees sign over any and all rights to intellectual

    so I don't think that IP is an issue as far as our words are concerned. We are
    not engaged in any emplyment either, our brains are not being paid for, so any
    ideas that we may com up with are our own. If it came to hosting a project, then
    that may be a different matter, because there would be money changing hands. If
    we were paid up members (which I am yet...waiting tho) then we would be sharing
    the cost of the hosting, which would change things too.\r\nThe original proposal
    was to actually investigate letting the FORUM have the rights, which is kind of
    different to where the thread was heading. I guess then what would need to happen
    is to ensure that it was indeed accessible to all, and that people involved got
    due credit for their work. I for one am happy to go into it knowing full well
    that I am relinquishing my rights to IP on the previso that it remains open to
    everyone, and that my name is on it saying what I did. But I am not actually sure
    if I need to sign anything over, we just say, here it is everyone, oh, and by
    the way if you use it, just remember to credit us. And any cash if fine too.\r\nIf
    it turns out that someone decides to turn it into a commercial product, with or
    without our knowledge, then that's something else again. It's a risk I don't mind
    taking. After all, it's what opensource is built on.\r\nOK, end of rant."

    and of content retains the rights but that posting here grants Typophile permission
    to reproduce content for materials that would directly promote Typophile (and
    not any other entity). That content lived on the About page, which got (inappropriately)
    nixed in the redesign. Look for a notice about this soon.\r\n\r\nDespite the notion
    of granting permission by default, to date we have only used people's content
    generated here (words and images) with their verbal or written (usually email)
    permission.\r\n\r\nI think any forum or blog would have a very difficult time
    in a court trying to say that it held exclusive rights to intellectual property
    posted in forum discussions or as comments to articles. Likewise though, I have
    heard of cases of forums being sued for comments that users make there -- as if
    the forum controls and is responsible for user input. That notion is being heavily
    challenged in court though."

    the answer is probably something like 'maybe' because Joe will & Jared want the
    thing to not suck first. \r\n\r\nStill, I was wondering what initial thoughts
    you guys might have about this kind of community project & Typophile 'affiliation'
    with it. \r\n\r\nThe rest of this is all inferable or explicet from the other
    thread but here is my recap anyway:\r\n\r\nNortbert thinks ( Norbert, please correct
    this if it is false ) that the reverse type project would be good education for
    typophiles in general because it would help them to see shapes better. And because
    this form of thinking about type has historical interest.\r\n \r\nIf Typophile
    is seen to agree through affiliation with the project, the project is more likely
    to be used and by more people. Also I think Norbert would like to see the project
    made available to both Typophiles and Conference Attendees. Affiliation might
    be helpful there too."
