body: I was curious to hear what others think on using a display face for body text
  (web font)? If it renders remarkably well, is it wrong? The typeface in question
  is Kulturista. Click <a href="http://i45.tinypic.com/1e2x36.png" target="_blank">here</a>
  to see it in use.

    Btw, make sure you check the Apple rendering as well! "

    Adelle Light might be a closer fit. '

  body: The suggestion is due to quality. The RE series is pretty solid. If Kulturista
    works, use it!

  body: My apologies. I think what I was getting at is if using a display face for
    text type is "frowned upon". I guess you're right, if it works, use it.

  body: "Like death, screen rendering can be the great equalizer...\r\n\r\nKulturista
    might be hard to use to print a book, but it clearly renders onscreen in a very
    texty manner. And what people call something certainly doesn't affect how it works.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: In my defense, I wasn't relying on just the font-size or the rendering alone.
    It was a combination of looking for a typeface that complimented my logotype and
    also the typeface of my headers. I believe these are all important factors to
    make that decision. What I said above might have come across as ignorant.

    of this face for display and not also for text, which works well in most browsers."
