  body: "I think it is custom drawn, but a few fonts might be similar. One is [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/cabarga-cursiva/|Cabarga
    Cursiva]], and another with a more script-like feel is [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/gneisenauette/|Gneisenauette]]
    from Linotype.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
