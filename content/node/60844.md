body: I'm currently writing a short essay on Foundry Sans for university, and wondered
  if anyone could provide some examples of Foundry Sans being used in prominent corporate
  identities. I've found it is part of house-style suites for a lot of companies,
  but could really use some other nice examples, especially of it being used with/as
  part of a logo. Thanks!

    remember the name right now) using Foundry Sans. The colour of the identity and
    type is mainly blue, bit darker than Cyan."

    on WhattheFont, and google searching has thrown up a couple of government departments/projects
