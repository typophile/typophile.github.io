  body: As a foil to Modern's high contrast and sensuous curves, why not look as faces
    with even type color and clean lines?

    Raymond Lee, my mentor, so I felt that I was party to an authentic tradition."

  body: "Not being a typographer, my first guess would have been to use Bodoni Book
    with Modern No. 20.\r\n\r\nBut that would not look good - they aren't the same
    typeface, and so if one uses two different typefaces, one wants contrast.\r\n\r\nSo,
    I would then consider the suggestion that a real typographer made above, News
    Gothic. But when I look at it, I think that it's not quite right.\r\n\r\nTimes
    Roman? No. Almost as bad as Bodoni Book.\r\n\r\nA slab serif, like Memphis or
    Cairo or Stymie? That seems to me to be what would work, supplying what News Gothic
    lacks (serifs, so important for the readability of body copy) and yet contrasting
    strongly with Modern No. 20 in about the same way that News Gothic would. (Being
    short and squat instead of tall and thin, the contrast is doubled. This may be
    a bad thing, though, and if so it explains the choice of News Gothic.)\r\n\r\nAs
    an alternate suggestion, one could try Optima, but I think that would be pretty
    iffy as well."

  body: "Ray never used Modern 20, though.\r\nHe preferred Bodoni with News Gothic.\r\nThe
    trick was to match the weight of the serifs to the weight of the sans.\r\nAnd
    throw in a few similar line rules as well."

  body: I'd be tempted to look at Helvetica Neue, Avant Guarde for a nice round contrast
    or Dinn for something a little different.
