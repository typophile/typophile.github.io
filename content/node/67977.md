  body: "You're right about artificially extending fonts. A good rule of thumb is
    to include a picture of a face (preferably yours) and scale it along with the
    font. As long as the face doesn't look distorted, you're probably OK. Usually
    you can scale between 95 - 105% without it being too noticeable.\r\n\r\nI can't
    really think of too many extended serifs. You might want to try Engravers Roman,
    Americana, Newtext, or even Copperplate Gothic, although none of them look like
    your sample. If you want to go for a slab serif, Hellenic Wide could do the trick.
    Also, Black/Extra Bold weights of serif fonts tend to be wider than their regular
    counterparts.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    route to explore. I'll probably have do at least 50 comps to see what works. \r\n\r\nHey
    Renko, Thanks for posting those suggestions, I always appreciate as much feedback
    possible in these forums.\r\n\r\nI definitely have a lot to work with. \r\n\r\nStill,
    if y'all come across any Extended Old Style or Extended Traditional Serif typefaces,
    I'd much appreciate it! "

    typefaces that don't come to a sharp point. \r\n\r\nIt's even harder to find an
    elegant slab-serif extended that belongs on a wine label. Thus, I'm sticking to
    traditional and old-style serifs. "

  body: "I'll just note that artificially extending a typeface is generally less horrific
    than artificially condensing. The reason being the thick-to-thin balance. Optically,
    higher contrast between verticals (thicks) and horizontals (thins) is usually
    okay, but reversing that contrast is a Bad Thing.\r\n\r\nWhile I don't like to
    squish or stretch type at all, my rule of thumb would be more like 95%-120% is
    the reasonably safe range.\r\n\r\nThe other special problem is the letter \"S,\"
    which just does not survive such manipulations very well. Depends a bit on the
    typeface, but....\r\n\r\nT"
