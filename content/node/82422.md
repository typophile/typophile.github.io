  Std looks more like a blank space: \"( f)\" instead of \"(f)\".\r\n\r\nI think this
  might be some bad kerning in the font itself, and the only solution I've found is
  through [[http://www.tug.org/pipermail/xetex/2010-February/015956.html|XeLaTeX]]
  (which is the typesetting software I use, anyway):\r\n\r\n\r\nThe issue, however,
  seems a little bit annoying coming from such a large family which looks pretty nice
  both on paper and on screen, and for such a widely used letter pairing -- I use
  (figure X) all the time."

    does seem like an oversight.\r\n\r\nAdobe's EULA does allow modifications, so
    if you have access to a font editor, you could just fix it.\r\n\r\n"

    the font.\r\nAnd then, IIRC, the kerning settings for a given font in one document
    may be imported into another document.\r\n\r\nI wonder what happens to such kerning
    modifications when a Quark document is opened in InDesign."

    looks to me not like lack of kerning, but more like somehow the (necessary) positive
    kerning of the descending italic form got attached to the roman."
