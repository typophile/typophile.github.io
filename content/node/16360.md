    one matches. \r\n\r\nMaybe not the same, but something very similar, besides Poster
    Gothic?"

  body: "Lex: I have the sample. In fact, I made it 4 or 5 five years ago, but I need
    to make it again but bigger and don't remember wich font I used that time. I only
    made a small sample and it doesn't work for what I need now.\r\n\r\nChris: It
    is custom in the way I applied shadows, but the font used was a standard font,
    but don't remember its name, where I got it or nothing more about it. So I need
    to get it again.\r\n\r\nThanks for your responses."
