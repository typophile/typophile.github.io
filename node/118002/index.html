		<div class="commentbody">Times Roman is a typeface, designed in 1931 for the Times of London.
Times, Times New Roman, Times LT (Linotype) Std, and Times MT (Monotype) Std are four different type foundries' digital adaptations (fonts) of that typeface. (Actually, I think Times and Times New Roman probably each correspond to Linotype and Monotype— maybe someone can confirm?)
There are subtle differences in the letterforms and typesetting functionality (letterspacing, hinting) of each. Which one you use is entirely up to you. And Charles, if someone ever insists that you <em>have</em> to use Times MT Std try using LT and dare them to tell the difference.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><a>From [[http://www.linotype.com/1537/Times-family.html|Linotype&rsquo;s web site]]:</a></p>
<blockquote>In 1931, The Times of London commissioned a new text type design from Stanley Morison and the Monotype Corporation, after Morison had written an article criticizing The Times for being badly printed and typographically behind the times. The new design was supervised by Stanley Morison and drawn by Victor Lardent, an artist from the advertising department of The Times. Morison used an older typeface, Plantin, as the basis for his design, but made revisions for legibility and economy of space (always important concerns for newspapers). As the old type used by the newspaper had been called Times Old Roman," Morison's revision became "Times New Roman." The Times of London debuted the new typeface in October 1932, and after one year the design was released for commercial sale. The Linotype version, called simply "Times," was optimized for line-casting technology, though the differences in the basic design are subtle. The typeface was very successful for the Times of London, which used a higher grade of newsprint than most newspapers. The better, whiter paper enhanced the new typeface's high degree of contrast and sharp serifs, and created a sparkling, modern look. In 1972, Walter Tracy designed Times Europa for The Times of London. This was a sturdier version, and it was needed to hold up to the newest demands of newspaper printing: faster presses and cheaper paper. In the United States, the Times font family has enjoyed popularity as a magazine and book type since the 1940s. Times continues to be very popular around the world because of its versatility and readability. And because it is a standard font on most computers and digital printers, it has become universally familiar as the office workhorse. Times™, Times™ Europa, and Times New Roman™ are sure bets for proposals, annual reports, office correspondence, magazines, and newspapers.
<p>Linotype offers many versions of this font:
<strong>Times™</strong> is the universal version of Times, used formerly as the matrices for the Linotype hot metal line-casting machines. The basic four weights of roman, italic, bold and bold italic are standard fonts on most printers. There are also small caps, Old style Figures, phonetic characters, and Central European characters.
<strong>Times™ Ten</strong> is the version specially designed for smaller text (12 point and below); its characters are wider and the hairlines are a little stronger. Times Ten has many weights for Latin typography, as well as several weights for Central European, Cyrillic, and Greek typesetting.
<strong>Times™ Eighteen</strong> is the headline version, ideal for point sizes of 18 and larger. The characters are subtly condensed and the hairlines are finer.
<strong>Times™ Europa</strong> is the Walter Tracy re-design of 1972, its sturdier characters and open counterspaces maintain readability in rougher printing conditions.
<strong>Times New Roman™</strong> is the historic font version first drawn by Victor Lardent and Stanley Morison for the Monotype hot metal caster.</blockquote></p>
<p>You have not specified the origin for the versions you have, which would be key to identifying whether they are commercial retail versions or OEM operating system versions.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>One difference - I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s significant - that lets people quickly identify whether a font is based on Linotype Times Roman or Monotype Times (New) Roman - is the shape of the lowercase z in italics. The Monotype version has a simple sloped z; the Linotype version has a swash on the bottom stroke.</p>
<p>Any other differences (Linotype vs. Monotype, as opposed to Times versus Times Ten) are generally too subtle for the layperson and not particularly significant. Times Ten, on the other hand, is based on the 10 point size of Times, and so genuinely addresses a common flaw in digital adaptations of metal type - they&rsquo;re used to set text, but they&rsquo;re based on large sizes of the metal face, not text sizes, because they&rsquo;re easier to trace from.</p>
<p>The history is that Monotype invented Times Roman; Linotype licensed it, and copied it just about as closely as they could, and then Monotype had to use a slightly different name in the U.S. to avoid a trademark conflict.</p>
<p>Oh, yes, I almost forgot - and Linotype machines had a very serious limitation, in that the regular and italic forms (and usually the bold as well) of a face had to have the same widths for every letter. This meant, for <em>many</em> Linotype typefaces, that the italic was wider than it should be.</p>

<p>(Rubylith is a 2-layer film with a transparent red layer and a clear base layer. The red layer can be cut away with an x-acto knife, the clear base layer remains and holds everything together. It works well for tracing with a knife.)</p>

<p><strong>Times LT Std</strong> is from Linotype (LT) and a standard version (Std), which means it supports only American and Western European letters.
<strong>Times</strong> is probably also from Linotype and the lack of &ldquo;Std&rdquo; <em>could</em> mean that it supports more than the standard character set, but you&rsquo;ll have to check.</p>
<p><strong>Times New Roman MT Std</strong> is from Monotype (MT) and also just a basic version.
<strong>Times New Roman</strong> is probably also from Monotype and the same thing I wrote for <strong>Times</strong> applies.</p>
<p>Basically, you want to keep both Monotype and Linotype version, but you&rsquo;ll have to compare all of their properties to see which of the four families are the best versions for each foundry.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">By the way, can someone tell me where the different fonts within Times New Roman come from? I haven&rsquo;t checked all versions of TNR, but the standard one on my computer features different fonts for Regular and Bold. The dimensions are the same but the details are different. I&rsquo;ve heard this was a mistake when packaging TNR for use on Windows but I don&rsquo;t know anything about the specifics. Does anyone know what happened there?</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well, although this may not answer your question, what Thomas Phinney was referring to was the fact that back around 1931, while Stanley Morison came up with the basic idea of a modernized Plantin for the Times, and had Victor Lardent draw it, the bold face was an afterthought, and someone <em>else</em> drew that - and thus, even then, at the time of the original hot metal introduction of Times Roman by Monotype (the one called Times New Roman in the U.S. for trademark reasons) the mismatch between the bold and the normal typeface was highly criticized.</p>
<p>Times Titling was drawn by Eric Gill and to me it looks like it could have been a titling font for Perpetua (although there is a Perpetua Titling and it is different).</p>

<p>No, they are both digitized from the phototype masters, which were based on the 12 pt metal masters. Leastways, that&rsquo;s my recollection.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@hrant:
Luc Devroye&rsquo;s web site claims that the notion that William Starling Burgess was the real designer of Times Roman was a joke.</p>
<p>If so, I don&rsquo;t think that Monotype is laughing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that is the case. I think that Burgess did design a face, and it did look a lot like Times Roman, and so Mike Parker acted in good faith.</p>
<p>However, I think he was still <em>wrong</em>.</p>
<p>Basically, I think the original face by Burgess derived from De Vinne, while Times Roman derived from Plantin, and the similarity between them was coincidental (to the extent that it exceeded the similarity to be expected from having Caslon and Dutch types among their models and influences).</p>
<p>@riccard0:
Actually, this doesn&rsquo;t have anything much to do with the difference between &ldquo;typeface&rdquo; and &ldquo;font&rdquo; in the usual sense, but rather with the difference between &ldquo;typeface&rdquo; and something else, which is sometimes taken as another meaning of the word &ldquo;font&rdquo;.</p>
<p>That is, the thing we want people to use the word &ldquo;font&rdquo; for is one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>a package of lead type slugs for printing in a given typeface, perhaps containing 20 a&rsquo;s and proportional numbers of the rest of the letters in the alphabet;</li>
<li>a file with the extension .ttf or .otf used to allow a computer to print in a given typeface;</li>
<li>an element for a Selectric composer, the brass matrices to fill a Monotype matrix-case, or the round or square negative to put in a photocomposition machine.</li>
</ul>
<p>The alternate meaning of font, for which we really need a <em>third</em> word, is a specific weight, size, and drawing of a given typeface. It&rsquo;s the &ldquo;sometimes subtle difference between <em>typeface</em> and&rdquo; <em>that</em> which Times Roman in this discussion would help to explain.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t help that this third thing is much closer to being like a typeface (as it is an abstract way of shaping letters too, just a more specific one) than it is to be a font. So as long as you call the third thing a font, you end up increasing confusion rather than decreasing it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Surely it would be semantically correct finding a new term defining the “abstract way of shaping letters”, but I think that, apart from historical contexts, that’s exactly what I think “font” is good for.
After all, the meaning of the word has already broadened (abstracted) its meaning along with the evolution of type. Otherwise, we’ll need a new term also for files used to produce vector-based letters, because they’re not size-specific, like a lead font is.
So, given there will always be philosophical and semantical nuances, I think the best way to discriminate is to referring to the “thing”, the <i>œuvre</i>, the platonic idea, as <em>typeface</em>, and as <em>font</em> to the technical mean needed to deliver it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I have a moderately strong belief that the whole Burgess thing was a mammoth practical joke. If not, Parker invented some completely bogus/imaginary supporting evidence.</p>
<p>Mike Parker claimed there was a written document that bound Lanston Monotype and its successors to secrecy, and it was suggested that Gerald Giampa had it and had seen it and felt bound by it.</p>
<p>But when Giampa sold his business, assets and the Lanston name to P22, they found no trace of it, nor any other evidence.</p>
