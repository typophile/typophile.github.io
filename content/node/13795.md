  and I) were discussing what each one of us used as a CMYK value for when printing
  a solid panel of black (just the colour, no text). A 100% K black lacks depth without
  percentages of C, M or Y, and as such we each had differing values for the C, M
  and Y added. Is there an accepted standard?\r\n\r\nWith regards to typography, what
  would be used as the CMYK value for black, when printing white text on black? If
  CMY values are added, this could cause a fringing effect if misaligned when printing
  (yes?), so on smaller point sizes would a standard 100% K be recommeded?\r\n\r\nCheers
  for any thoughts!\r\n"

  body: "In the print shops I have worked in, we often employ a color called \"Rich
    Black,\" which is 100%K+40%C. It punches up the black considerably without laying
    too much ink on the paper.\r\n\r\nYou can, of course, add equal amounts of C,
    M and Y to \"balance\" the spectrum, but in no event should the combine percentages
    exceed 280% (out of a possible 400%), again because excess ink delays drying time
    and creates offsetting problems (transfer of ink between printed sheets).\r\n\r\nWhen
    reversing out type--especially smaller point sizes--try to keep the complicating
    factors to a minimum--that is, use Rich Black or another K+one other color combo,
    and include some spread in the trap so that hairline registration is not necessary.\r\n"

    and printing methods on both the readability and reproduction fidelity of typefaces.\r\n\r\nI'm
    not sure if it was published anywhere else, but an article written for Step-by-Step
    magazine offered valuable suggestions:\r\n\r\n<em>Producing Consistently Readable
    and Beautifully Printed Type.</em>\r\nJoan Wilking and Russ Bannon.  \r\nI<em>nDesigner\u2019s
    Guide to Typography</em>, edited by N. Aldrich-Ruenzel and John Fennell. New York:
    Watson-Guptill Publications, 1991\r\n\r\nI used their techniques as the guidline
    for printing type specimen books and posters for Agfa and Compugraphic. We took
    densitometer readings of the black ink (standard CYMK) only after the presses
    ran for awhile after makeready, and would not sign off until the readings were
    consistently between 160 -- 180.\r\n\r\nWhen you mean \"black colour\" I assume
    you are interested in producing a certain richness and depth of \"black.\" That
    could mean several things in the eye of the beholder.\r\n\r\nOccasionally we would
    hit the black with matte varnish for that \"black hole\" look. Conversely we would
    hit the black with a gloss varnish for the sleek, shinny look.\r\n\r\nBut we would
    NEVER run another color ink on top of the black type for the very reason you mentioned,
    registration.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------\r\nYes, I'm old,

    the results you want from it so let the presses RIP. I would be afraid to put
    white text or logos on top of that. Any misregistration and you're dead. My baseline
    mix for backgrounds is 30 20 20 100. For text 0 0 0 100. In Photoshop if you look
    to the left of K in the CMYK sliders, you can see the undercoating color.\r\n\r\npeace"

    a packaging design where the box was to be black and all text (News Gothic) reversed

    \ That would make sense but not for black type on white paper.  With reversed
    type (if not too small) you can trap with the black solid leaving a dot and a
    half trap before you use other CMY colors. I prefer just 30% red and 30% blue
    to bulk up the black. As everyone else says, there are many formulae prefered
    by different printers.  You can also double-hit the black but you still need a

    It's interesting that there seems to be a 50/50 split on whether or not to include
    CMY in a black in certain situations (rich black). Again, I guess it depends on
    the job and final output. Has anyone ever double hit a black with reversed type?
    I can't see when I would do that.\r\n\r\nNews Gothic is set at 10pt (at its smallest)
    on the box, although the main bulk is 12pt. Legibility isn't a problem. Any suggestions
    for an alternative typeface that can handle the smothering effect of black at
    sub 9pt settings?"
