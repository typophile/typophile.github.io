		<div class="commentbody">I'm confused as to what I'm supposed to disagree with&hellip;  :-) <BR> <BR>I think that statement -like so many other things Morison has said- contains a kernel of truth, but is not robustly true enough to be thrown out like that without qualification. For one thing, it can only apply to text fonts. And even in the realm of text fonts, I would distinguish between a reader going &quot;Oh, what a cool font!&quot; (which you certainly don't want) versus a reader feeling a subconscious tingle of excitement at encountering something new, something that <i>amplifies</i> the content in the subtlest way. <BR> <BR>No font is ever totally transparent, basically because that's not possible of something that's made by a human for other humans. The difference between text and display, between craft versus art, however is the intent of the maker: creating something useful that contains a part of him &quot;naturally&quot; almost of <i>in spite</i> of himself; or formally celebrating his personal expression. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">What tools can type designers use (aside from analysing historical sales trends or copying what others are doing) to gauge how well their fonts would satisfy the needs/wants of the graphic design community? <BR> <BR>Well, I can't think of anything that makes alot of business sense, except for looking for and accepting commissions. When a typeface is designed to fill a certain need/want (say, a new typeface for the Munich Underground, or a printing firm's annual report, or a newspaper who wants to print their stock listings in smaller type) then we can be sure that there really is an audience, or use, for a design. But most typefaces are not designed with something this specific in mind.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I guess that was a loaded response. But the original statement has that slippery little word 'successful.' Coupled with the vague 'fount,' we have a tricky proposition that raised two questions: &quot;what is a fount?&quot; and &quot;what is successful?&quot;  <BR> <BR>So I answered based on the liquid nature of the original statement. It does sound great and romantic, you are absolutely right. I can't answer for others, but I can answer for me. A thing well made makes me very happy indeed, even happier when I have made it myself. A thing well made fulfils both form &amp; function, and thus those who use it wil be happy too. (How very karmic!). <BR> <BR>As Dan said, unless one is lucky enough to have the appropriate tools for gauging &quot;how well their fonts would satisfy the needs/wants of the graphic design community&quot; then it is back to the bubble! They can be as happy as Larry with a typeface I have made, but if I am not happy with it then there is something amiss.  <BR> <BR>I am in no way denying the fact that typefaces are tools to be used by our brothers and sisters in design. Sometimes they don't use our tools very well at all, sometimes very badly indeed. When this happens then there is only one thing that makes the whole thing worthwhile: &quot;am I happy with my new fount?&quot; <BR> <BR>kris.</div>

The inherit paradox of the client, do 'we' exist without 'them'?

We can also use the fonts in our publication designs and see how clients feel about them.  This is not scientific but it will have to do.  The problem is, to test a font, you have to make a font.  Having done that, you might as well put it on the market.  If it sells, you recoup some of the expense you put into design.  If not, then you have learned something and saved yourself the cost of market research.   <BR>We could help each other out by sharing the feedback we get on our own work here on typophile.  There may be something generalizable out of it for everyone. <BR>Personally, I would design fonts anyway because I want to and find it a rewarding enough learning experience in itself.  Would I like to sell them and make money too? Sure! Will I die broken-hearted if I don't? No. After 6 decades on this earth, I know fame and fortune are not as important as family and true friendship. <BR> <BR>ChrisL</div>

		<div class="commentbody">By defining a good type designer in relation to a certain kind of print genre (traditional, book, text), Morison put the cart before the horse. He had an agenda, of course, which was to promote an upper-crust notion of typography, with himself as the uber-guru. The Type Czar. <BR> <BR>However, then (1927) as now, there was also a market for novel commercial founts. <BR> <BR>For instance, at that time, Morris Benton took a style of &quot;Moderne&quot; display lettering used in signage, and turned it into a typeface&ndash;Broadway&ndash;which was quite patently a typeface of great novelty, to all and sundry. Benton is undisputedly a good type designer, and Broadway, if for no other reason than having stood the test of time, is a good typeface. Ergo Morison was wrong.</div>

Immanuel Kant, for instance. Luther's works were all published during his lifetime in blackletter, exclusively, I think. In fact it was this decision that made Fraktur the quasi-official style of the German language for 400 years. Luther's Bible (i.e., the official Bible of the German Lutheran Church) was printed solely with Fraktur until the 1960s.</div>

Don't ask me to be articulate today, it just is not going to happen. The Italians were among the first to be daring. Schweynheim and Pannartz got out of Germany, and yes I'm guessing, because they knew what they were doing was not going to be acceptable in Germany. Ack I have none of my notes. <BR> <BR>Wasn't Kant contemporary with that time though? I was talking about the manuscripts that they, the humanists in Italy, had found. Gah! I don't remember.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">To concur with Tiffany, <BR>Yes, first humanists tried to found appropriate letter style to fit new thinking around, those from greek philosophers. As they found manuscripts in Libraries, wrote in sort of carolingian/oncials, they imagined, by mistake that the greeks used that kind of writing style. So, they followed and in fact, it gave to us, hopefully, what we call humanistic handwriting. Then, later, first printers, followed that and draw first &quot;Romans&quot; and italics. <BR> <BR>Couple of years after, when the center of printing was moved to France, it happen roughly same thing. Just to recall you that at the time, Fraktur type was more common in France. But because of new thinking around, again, mostly critical essays about bible and religion, who bring soon after Luther (and many printers on fire), the printers and punchcutters wanted to use letterforms who reflect their openness on new ideas around, so, people like Augereau and Garamond cut new type, to fit better to the text.</div>

Blackletter remained en force in Germany for many reasons, including religious devotion, interest, and tradition. &quot;Fear&quot; is totally implausible. I'm not saying that blackletters are better than Romans; but they weren't some sort of oppresive scare tactic. I can wait for your explanation, though. Even though I fear that you are missing something ;) <BR> <BR>Kant wasn't a contemporary of the incunabula printers or the humanists, but rather Goethe and Schiller (late 1700s, post-Enlightenment). Almost all books, except foreign texts, were printed in fraktur in Germany at that time. Also in Scandinavia. And alot of books in Holland, too.</div>

Its why, very quickly, when these two guys moved soon after to Italy, they naturally used the more up today style, roman type. <BR> <BR>About the use of Roman type in Germany, you should note that Garamond lookalike was widely used in Europe in middle of the next century, and one of the first type specimen showing some Garamond and Granjon type was printed in&hellip; Frankfurt (1592) and set by a guy called Sabon?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">No, don't agree&hellip; <BR> <BR>Its simply because it take some years to design new type and even more years that the new typefaces became used widely. You can't ask to a user what he will use in 5 or 10 years. But its what a type designer ask to himself all the time.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Chris, <BR> <BR>I have moved to the UK for a year, and had difficulty getting set up, but I'm online again now. <BR> <BR>*** <BR> <BR>As this thread seems to be going off all over the place, I will continue in the same vein. <BR> <BR>Speaking of Sweynham &amp; Pannartz, what a film script, the ultimate buddy movie. Fleeing from the burning ruins of Mainz with their printing press on a donkey cart, they cross the Alps (snow, precipice), and arrive in Italy where everyone thinks their type is weird geeky gothic shite. So they change their style (like Bruce Lee in the Big Boss) and the rest is history. With Angelina Jolie as the gypsy princess who helps them fix their broken axle.  <BR> <BR>Akira Kobayashi and myself have both done versions of the first S&amp;P face, but not literal, more like &quot;inspired by, but not so's you'd notice.&quot; In fact, few did notice them at all, novelty or otherwise. So I guess that would make us good type designers, according to Mr Morison.</div>

But I can going deeper: You can't design the same (and perfect&hellip; indeed!?) font for all newspapers on this earth&hellip; <BR> <BR>A particular use, very focused, make a great font.</div>
