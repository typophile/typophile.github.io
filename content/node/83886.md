  just a fan):\r\n\r\nPlaytype\u2122\r\nConcept Store\r\n\r\nThe Playtype concept
  store was launched in conjunction with the revamp and redesign of Playtype.com.
  Located in Copenhagen\u2019s Vesterbro, the store is the physical manifestation
  of the online shop \u2013 and then some. Created as a place to further our typographic
  practice, the store provides a street level entry to typography - it is a place
  to share our passion with the general public and a place where our designers can
  experiment with their craft outside of the studio. Aside from type, the store continuously
  features new editions and products created by e-Types alongside friends and colleagues
  in the design and art world.\r\n\r\nPlaytype is located at V\xE6rnedamsvej 6, \r\nCopenhagen
  and will be open for exactly \r\none year \u2014 from December 1st 2010 to \r\nDecember
  1st 2011 \r\n\r\n\r\n"
