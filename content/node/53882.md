  picture are of signage and use of typography, all within about 3 miles of each other
  in Mid-City New Orleans.  If not through anything else, one can tell the antiquity
  of styles and stubborn culture of New Orleans through its signage and typography.
  \ Each use of a non-contemporary style tells a tale of a city with a serious problem
  letting go of the past.  Some may think this is why we are behind the design curve.
  \ Maybe this is an impediment to designers in the city.  The persistence of antiquated
  New Orleans signage, however, preserves the city's indigenousness; it perpetuates
  it's own style not dictated by fads or popularity.  And I'm proud of that.  With
  each hand-lettered, grammatically-incorrect sign, I see a bit of the city's personality
  pushed through on paint and wood. Same with every neon-laced sign.  Culture comes
  through in words here-- not through what they say, but how they look."
