      for something ca. 1977. Knockout is from the mid 1990s no?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    the 80 pounds of lead sorts to mount in your Linotype machine or possibly something
    that fits your Filmotype system? I guarantee that you will never find a 1970''s
    TrueType or Type1 font. This one or any other!'
