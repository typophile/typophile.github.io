  and I haven't a clue where to get the bulbs. Currently using Cool White Florescent
  bulbs, but I'd like to use bulbs meant for color correction. Does anyone have experience
  with these? Brands? Suppliers? Amazon?"

    standard is around 5000 K, depending on who's talking. \r\n\r\nHere's the problem
    with the standard: It is a color temperature almost never found where any normal
    person will be looking at the picture. What we use for evaluation at our shop
    is around 3,200 K, and we also control the lumens, which matters as well. And
    for b&w as well as color.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I like to use three sources: a warm
    light about 2,700K (similar to an incandescent  desk or floor lamp), an intermediate
    source, around 3,300K and a little brighter, and the 5,200K \"standard.\" The
    image needs to look OK under all three, but if I'm going to shade it, I'll ignore
    the 5200K, on the grounds that almost no one reads books outside, under a reflected
    north-source light.\r\n\r\nWhat's \"right\" is all about how something is viewed.
    If you know an image will hang in a  museum with 5200K lighting, that's one thing
    -- but let me tell you, an awful lot of museums don't have, effectively, 5200K
    lighting.\r\n\r\nUse three sources, with a light intensity that would be considered
    \"normal\" for a person viewing the image -- you'll be amazed at how your work
    improves. "
