  named \u201CSuperCooper\u201D from the 1960\u2019s/1970\u2019s. It\u2019s a bottom-weighted,
  heavy version of Cooper Black, in the classic early Seventies ITC/U&lc style. May
  also be known as Super Cooper, SooperCooper, Sooper Cooper, etc. My old typographer
  had it in their Linotype catalog, but they\u2019re long gone.\r\nWould love to know
  if there\u2019s an online source for downloading SuperCooper this week. Cheap, shareware
  or freeware would be cool, too. Thanks for helping out.\r\nRandy"
