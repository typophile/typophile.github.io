  for women. The hair is smooth flowing and beautiful, natural looking, crisp.\r\n\r\nI
  want to exude class and simplicity in the logo. Alot of the hair companies out there

    start over with fresh ideas. Stop trying to depict hair, it's painfully cliche.
    \ A hair salon logo with hair is so literal that it's instantly forgettable. Plus,
    \"hair\" is right there in the name of the business, so why illustrate it? \r\n\r\nThe
    font is too fragile -- very wispy and spindly. The hairy smudge looks like it's
    about to slide down and wipe the letters right off the page. "

  body: "I like the hair swooshy thing that I drew, it's not a smudge lol! I'll stick
    with the cliche for now. I may remove the \"hair\" word but I actually for once
    like the swirl I made and the color scheme.\r\n\r\nI'm a woman and women like
    whimsical when they open packages they like the swoops on the packaging and hang
    tags. I've done research on this asked my current customers what they like etc.
    I think the swoop here is subtle because i've seen worse with flourishes all over
    the place. It may look cheesy but that's the world of hair. \r\n\r\nThanks for
    your opinion.\r\n\r\nYou criticize the font do you have any recommendations? I
    have looked at so many fonts and they just start to all look the same after a
    while."

  body: ">  i'm pretty rusty in design haven't done this since school\r\n\r\nluvtati,
    I don't mean any offense, but these layouts look amateurish and have numerous
    problems. It's not just a matter of making a few tweaks; you really need to start
    fresh as Alaskan said. \r\n\r\nI suggest that you hire a professional graphic
    designer, not only to design the logo itself but to also help with your printed
    materials, signage, packaging, etc. Perhaps one of your friends or business associates
    could recommend someone."

  body: "Well my competitors logos are in the same range as mine so I guess we are
    all amateurish but making alot of money. My business is actually very successful,
    my product speaks for itself. I just need a logo for my upcoming site I don't
    want the upper corner to have deadspace. My buyers aren't concentrated on my logos
    and if the tracking is off or the font is a free font, they want quality hair
    and that's what I have. \r\n\r\nRight now i'm selling making good money without
    a logo, website and whatever bells and whistles graphic designers think I need.
    \r\n\r\nMy competitors logos:\r\n\r\nwww.extensions-plus.com\r\nhttp://www.jujuhair.com/\r\nhttp://www.halleyscurls.com/8201.html\r\nhttps://www.indiquehair.com/indique/home.do\r\nhttp://www.wagmanhair.com/\r\nhttp://www.lanikshair.com/index.php?main_page=index&cPath=0\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks

    is akin to people cutting their own hair. Sure, people own scissors and can actually
    cut their hair....but the results are most likely hideous. You privately make
    fun of these fools, don't you? You know how much information/training/skill/education/experience
    that they just don't have. Their self-haircut will look cheap and sad and....wow,
    they'll deeply regret cutting their own hair. \r\n\r\nYou may scare away the opposite
    sex/employers for a while, but hair grows back. Meanwhile - yay hats! \r\n\r\nYour
    cheap and sad logo will scare away potential new customers forever. If you care
    about the future of your business, hire a graphic designer."

    better and more professional than yours.\r\n\r\nAnd, just for the record, I'd
    never order anything off those last two websites (or halleycurls.com) because
    they look \"DIY\" amateurish and therefore, probably not secure websites. Those
    websites look unstable, unreliable, inexperienced and possibly totally unprofessional
    scammers, actually. The only ones that look like trustworthy businesses are indiquehair.com
    and extensions-plus.com....and maybe jujuhair.com?\r\n\r\nYou came here asking
    for advice from professionals....and we gave it to you. Then, you said you didn't
    need advice because you knew better. So, can I conclude that you never really
    wanted advice -- you wanted us to compliment you? If that's true, stick to asking
    your mother for \"advice.\" "

    were on the attack from the start. I will not be virtually attacked or have someone
    say something to me that hits a sensitive spot in my personal life. But an illogical

    analogy.\r\n\r\nI have alot of customers already my friend, this site won't and
    can't hurt my following and business try again. I have built my business from
    the ground, with word of mouth, great service and a quality product. My buyers
    don't care about my packaging, logo or anything else, they want my product. I
    am actually quite happy to have built such a brand without the bells and whistles

  body: "Hello. If I may give some feedback in regards to your logo.  I would say
    the \"best\" of the bunch you have provided is the 2nd version draft. The black
    with the subtle beige gradation appears more professional.  The issue I am seeing
    with the others is that it looks like the word H A R.  The colors also do not
    look very professional. \r\n\r\nIf you are going to go with something more cliche
    in portraying hair for a hair company, maybe look at the logo of Tresemme. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/images_3940.jpeg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/images-1_6290.jpeg]\r\n\r\nYour
    depiction of hair looks more like dripping paint or something along the lines
    of the \"Avril Lavigne\" brand.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/avril-lavigne-girlfriend-lyrics_4226.jpg]\r\n\r\n
    You said :\r\n\r\n\"My company: I provide top of the line hair extensions for
    women. The hair is smooth flowing and beautiful, natural looking, crisp.\"\r\n\r\nI
    would do some research beyond your competitors and I would look at more high end
    hair companies and even non hair companies.  A lot of their logos are black or
    dark and seem elegant, classy and timeless. The examples provided seem like something
    you could get at \"Claires\" or any other type of store of that sort.\r\n"

  body: "Alaskan, as a moderator I have to step in.\r\n\r\nHow you take someone bringing
    up your mother is entirely different than how someone else might take it. Telling
    someone it isn't supposed to be offensive does not make it so. You took this from
    a critique to something very personal for Luvtati. That is not the intent of this
    forum. \r\n\r\nIt is far too easy to say things off the cuff when we're online.
    I've done it myself. Please consider your words more carefully. It is one thing
    for us to suggest that Tatiana needs to hire a professional and have her decide
    to not take our advice. That is just business. But we aren't here to belittle
    or berate or, as it has happened, touch on a tender topic for someone. \r\n"

    You might want to give that font a try. At myfonts.com you can set specific words
    in a font to see how they look.
