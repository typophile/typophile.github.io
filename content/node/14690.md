body: "Hi,\r\nI see that there have been a couple of internship questions posted recently,
  so I hope one more won't hurt anyone...\r\nI'm a graphic design student graduating
  this coming May (2006) so I am working on a printed portfolio book to send out to
  people in hopes of getting an internship. I'm trying to make a list of people to
  send my portfolio to, but some insider suggestions would definetly help. I live
  in Montreal, but I'm really looking outside for something. The States would be great
  since it's so close, and Europe would be insane too.\r\nTo anyone here... I'm english,
  I'm french, I have 4 years design experience in packaging...\r\nAny help would be
  greatly appreciated! I'm looking to send out my stuff early September.\r\n\r\nPlease
  help me!\r\n\r\nPs. Jean Francois Porchez- La premi\xE8re copie sera envoy\xE9e
  \xE0 vous. Elle a \xE9t\xE9 promis en janvier, je m'excuse d'avance pour le retard
  \ : )\r\n\r\nPps. Merci pour la correction Hrant. After all , I am english before
  french, but I try  : )"

    body: "Thanks Dan, I'll try to look through the site to see if I can find any.
      It's hard to figure out which places are good and which aren't. \r\n\r\nFor
      this internship, I'm not focusing too much on the packaging, more on working
      in an amazing place where I can learn alot. I've done intensive courses with
      JFP and Ruedi Baur in which I learnt technical things, but also ways of thinking
      and working, which were amazing experiences, but only lasted 7 days. I'm trying
      to find something similar to these, but over a longer period of time. (I'm not
      afraid of working like a dog, or for free, as long as I am getting better at
      what I do. So I'm hoping to stay away from small companies just looking for
      free labor.)\r\n\r\nFor this September, I'd like to send my stuff to about 20
      places. So I'm trying to figure out who these 20 people are, places that are
      really \"high up\" there. I've figured out about 10 of them, but the last 10...
      \r\n\r\nAny advice? anyone? please..."

  body: Allison, I suppose you were just generalizing, but don't think that big companies
    aren't looking for free (or almost free) labor too. Most nice indie typefoundries,
    for example, are small companies, but you could still learn a lot there. Anyway,
    good luck on your search!

    body: "I completely agree with you Gabriel. I'm very open to go anywhere, in any
      field of design. I just want to make sure I'm applying to the right places.
      \r\n\r\nFor example, from what I've read, Dumbar in the Netherlands is a great
      place to intern. You really get pushed to do the best you can (better than you
      thought possible.) And they're open to taking interns from anywhere in the world,
      as long as you're good enough. \r\n\r\nLars M\xFCller Publishing is another
      one. Just spending time with that group would change the way I work and think.\r\n\r\nI
      know that these two are probably near impossible for me to get into, but at
      this point, with a little time to spare, I want to try. If all I get is some
      good criticism, I'll be happy.\r\n\r\nWould anyone have any suggestions? Maybe
      you guys know some great people I could look into. Small, medium, large, which
      ever."

  body: Allison, large firms won't allow you to do much more than make the coffee
    I agree with gabrielhi. There is a small packaging firm in Manhattan that redesigned
    a lot of the Frito-Lays products and redesigned the Pepsi can (verticle) and that
    show has about 10 people in it.

    who worked there but that was a long time ago.

  body: I'm sure I'll be able to find it. To date, I've only found info crediting
    the new design to Landor... I think they might fall into the "giant corporation/one
    cream, two sugars" category.
