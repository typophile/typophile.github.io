  I submitted an entry for Barnhart Brothers & Spindler a while back and could still
  get to it doing a search, but none of the links to it worked. Evidently the ampersand
  is the problem and causes the name to truncate oddly. The fix is as follows:\r\n\r\nbarnhart_brothers_and_spindler|Barnhart
  Brothers & Spindler\r\n\r\n[[barnhart_brothers_and_spindler|Barnhart Brothers &
  Spindler]]"
