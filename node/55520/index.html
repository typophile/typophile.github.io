		<div class="commentbody">Left column looks like an educational logo, kids-oriented. Middle column looks like a shampoo product line, specifically - [[http://www.stuff4beauty.com/pics/ultra-shampoo.jpg|Biolage]]. 

Between the options in the last column, the second from the top in the left sub-column looks nice and reasonably appropriate. The bottom three options don't really work for me. I would rather keep 'E' as a mark and render Elmsmere Associates a standalone text (similar to the top set of options in the last column).

And also tell us what executive research has to do with environment (that trees/leaves imply)...

it doesn't have so much to do with the environment, my client said they like the idea of the elm tree standing for being solid and growing, evolving.

<li>First pack with trees has unbalanced details. they have too much detail in the tree and some of them are dubious when you think of pure black/white logo. They look like clipart combined with type. Not a logo in this version.</li>
<li>Second pack that imitates green leaf under E. leaf looks somehow distorted but otherwise still no distincion that would make it a logo.</li>
<li>Squared E's... Seen them often times before, but in more refined version. Of all ideas presented here, this one is the strongest but still one would ask himself whether to go this route since so many have gone down this one before with mixed results. Some logos look really great, others blunt...</li>
<li>The last/new pack with magnifying glass is a missed one like the first pack. "Rough" looking magnifying glass clipart attached to type. It's also rather unreadable...</li>
</ol>

Some steps you should take:
<ul>
<li>Get away from the monitor. Take paper and pencil and draw and write ideas associated with your client needs and their business as well as logo goals.</li>
<li>Start with a complete simple B/W logo without colours. This will help you keep detail down to minimum.</li>
<li>When you feel you have some nice and strong idea on the paper, sit behind the computer and try to do it and see if it could work.</li>
</ul>

Sorry.

		<div class="commentbody">Can't really add much after what Robert said, but for pure curiousity, what is it that Elmsmere Associates <em>do</em>?
I suppose you chose the whole tree/leaf imagery because of the Elm in Elmsmere. If so and you want to stick with it, you might try combining the squared E with one or two leaves as an initial, renaissance style. Or maybe work the tree and its branches in.

		<div class="commentbody">The tree version would look great if you simplify it to flat colors with no linework and set Elmsmere in a sans. And track out your caps! Also, convince the client to just use “Elmsmere”. There’s a reason that the Target logo says “Target” and not “Target Corporation”.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'd argue to some degree with James about not using "associates". Target is a word with a meaning. Elmsmere is not. It all depends on the business they are doing. If it's some environmental company I'd remove associates, if it's some special services (lawyers/real estate etc) I'd keep associates...

		<div class="commentbody">Agree with Robert on everything, but just a note to add: if you've got to separate the word in two (like with the magnifying glass) use "Elms" not "Elm". Otherwise you're left with a "smere".
