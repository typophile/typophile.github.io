  body: "This uses the same font as the Mobil logo, and since both names contain 'o'
    and \"il\", I immediately thought of Mobil.\r\n\r\nYour second logo seems forced
    - that is, the breaks in the letterforms don't flow well with the logo.\r\n\r\n

  body: "I like the second version a lot - except the \"1\", which I'd prefer either
    not splitted at all, or only in two pieces, because cutting the stem in two seems
    totally causeless and disturbing.\r\n\r\nAnd no, the logo doesn't remind me of
    mobile at all -- not even after reading about this possible resemblance. Maybe
    it's partially because I've never seen the Mobile logo in black-and-white."

  body: "I also do not think of mobile when I see this.\r\n\r\nI think the cuts in
    the \"1\" and \"e\" get a little too busy.\r\n\r\nI like the e with those cuts
    on it's own, but I am not sure it's working well with it's environment. Try taking
    out a cut or two.  See what happens."
