body: "Hello all,\r\n\r\nI am something of both a designer and Mac software developer
  who is need of a font for a project that I'm working on. To be specific, I am creating
  a Cocoa framework that mimics the UI look and feel found in Blizzard games for use
  by both others and myself. Part of that feel, obviously, is the font that Blizzard
  uses, which is mostly Friz Quadrata.\r\n\r\nWhile I would not mind buying a license
  for my own personal use, it is simply not feasible for myself as a college student
  to purchase a license that would allow me to distribute the font with the framework,
  as doing so would be prohibitively expensive, and expecting the users of the framework
  to purchase a font license in order to use it isn't exactly reasonable.\r\n\r\nThat
  why I now come seeking the knowledge of the typography experts here at Typophile
  in my search for a free alternative. Do you have any suggestions for free fonts
  with an extremely similar look and feel to Friz Quadrata?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for
  taking the time to read!\r\n"

  body: "Well, after working with the \"knockoff\" a little I've found that the baseline
    and kerning is kinda messed up compared to real Friz Quadrata. I could make it
    work, but it's not ideal.\r\n\r\nAnd if the terms really don't cover redistribution,
    that's a real problem.\r\n\r\nWhy exactly must font licenses be so painfully inflexible?
    I understand the effort that goes into creating a typestyle and agree that the
    creators should be compensated for their work, but at the same time things need
    to be made as simple and cost-effective as possible for the customer, regardless
    if said customer is a monolithic company or a lone college student developer.
    If a license to distribute the font with the framework that also covered the works
    of developers using it was available and reasonably priced, I wouldn't hesitate
    to fork over the cash, but no such thing seems to exist. Perhaps I'm mistaken,
    but it feels kind of like the industry is still stuck in the early 90's.\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    I'd also like to add that the framework is intended for use with applications
    made by and for the fan communities of Blizzard games; for instance, one might
    use this UI framework for a World of Warcraft name generator or a Starcraft save
    game organizer.\r\n"

    - anything more than $150-$250 is more than I can swing, and even the top end
    on that won't be possible until a few months down the road.\r\n\r\nThe budget
    would be higher if I charged for the framework, but its target user group is tiny
    at best and charging would reduce that further, so it's something I'd like to
    avoid.\r\n\r\nAt this rate, I'll probably have to tell users to buy their own
    copy of Friz Quadrata if they want an accurate reproduction and just have the
    UI elements render in some vaguely-similar open source or standard system font
    by default.\r\n\r\n"

    of font licence.\r\nNow, evolving with the variety of digital devices and business
    structures, font licensing has become much more sophisticated.\r\nLicensing is
    precise, to cover a variety of different situations, rather than inflexible.\r\n\r\nOf
    course, this can be perplexing to the licensee, and some licences are more user-friendly
    than others, but IMO font licensing is at the cutting edge of digital culture,
    addressing the implications of technological change to intellectual property."
