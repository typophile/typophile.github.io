  way too many different characters in each language. \r\n\r\nWhy are there so many
  glyphs in a font?\r\n\r\nWouldn't it be nice if ALL languages narrowed it down to
  just two glyphs? \r\n\r\nI was thinking maybe a simple zero and a one. \r\n\r\nThat
  should be enough to communicate just about anything, don't ya think?"

    I just forgot to include it in the diagram; it should go with the red letters
    at the bottom.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't want to abandon unicase \"m\", because Thompson
    really is very effective, without it Alphabet 26 veers too much towards upper
    case.\r\n\r\n<em>...you could replace Y with \u0423, and w with \u03C9...</em>\r\n\r\nTrue,
    but I find the lower case shape of \u0423 looks too \"small\" for the Latin unicase,
    and \u03C9 doesn't fit this style.\r\nPerhaps in another typeface it would be
    possible to reduce the number of glyphs still further.\r\n\r\nHere are the Latin
    and Greek unicase alphabets, compared with small caps.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/uni3_6139.png]\r\n\r\nI
    didn't actually use that \"alpha\" form of \"a\" in the Latin, but I could have."

    utilization of colour, too.\r\n\r\nOne could place the uncial shape for e/epsilon,
    which should be acceptable for Cyrillic as well, in the centre. Omega as w is
    hurting. And the v-glyph for Nu \u2026? \r\nU serving as \u2018Upsilon\u2019 doesn\u2019t
    satisfy me. It seems illogical to me not to unify y and upsilon.\r\nHowever, I
    would definitely unify the Greek-Cyrillic lambda and delta (triangular shapes)
    and also tri-unify the M.\r\nAnd if it\u2019s to serve not only major languages,
    two Serbian letters would have to be added on the Cyrillic side; the same for
    Eth and Thorn and Eng in Latin.\r\n\r\nHow many Eurocase fonts are on the market

    a single glybh. n, u, uqsilon, ii and pe/pi can be merged, as can be s and ge

    although I haven't actually produced any fonts with <strong>only</strong> the
    unicase LCG glyphs. I suppose to be really hardcore, the common glyphs should
    have multiple Unicodes. I'm not sure how well that would be supported by layout
    applications.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nI suspect there may be a few typefaces with Greek
    Unicase. Any Cyrillic unicase fonts?\r\n\r\nFor Greek especially, it seems that
    a lot is dependent on the typeface. The balance of upper and lower case letter
    forms that one seeks in a unicase typeface varies considerably from sans to serif:
    the typical Greek sans serif lower case glyphs are much more similar to the upper
    case than their serifed counterparts."

    there is, I think, a serious core in this witty debate. It\u2019s about \u201Chow
    to make things easier and more simple\u201C. Which is a legitimate approach in
    general. \r\nI remember a saying (from who?): \u201C things should be as simple
    as possible but not simpler than that.\u201D \u2013 and there it gets interesting.
    Killing c and q and v is a nice exercise of the mind but of virtual no relevance
    to practice. But: \u201Chow can I make a L-G-C font more efficiently?\u201D IS
    of practical relevance.\r\n\r\nLatin and Cyrillic sprang off the Greek alphabet
    Hundreds of years ago, yet remained close relative all the time. Now we face the
    novelty of the three re-united in one single lettercase. That raises the question
    of practical rationalization and aesthetic harmonization (or however you wish
    to call it), this is only consequential in my eyes."
