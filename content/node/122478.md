  body: Thanks Ryuk. Yes, it is very Helvetica (similar tittles) but at the same time
    it's fully geometric (look at the uppercase G). It's a hard one!

    for the text (it does have a geometric G):\r\nhttp://www.houseind.com/fonts/chalet\r\n\r\nIf
    you can provide the name of the book, I may be able to confirm...."

  body: "You're both right, I didn't realise Chalet had different versions, some with
    a double storey 'a'. I had a look at all their specimens and found the specific
    version I was after: Chalet London 1960.\r\n\r\nThank you both for your help!"
