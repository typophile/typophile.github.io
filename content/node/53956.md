  body: This really should be in the Type ID forum. I think you're right. It looks

  body: "The 'O's are only 7 pixels wide. They are not perfectly round, but neither
    is Helvetica's. Grid-fitting (with a bias for exact width) does the rest.\r\n\r\nI
    get a (pixel) perfect match for each string with Helvetica <em>iff</em> I switch
    off all kerning."
