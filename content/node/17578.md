body: "My friend just purchased a franchise that uses <a href=\"http://www.cscos.com/pblogos.jpg\">this
  unknown font</a> for their marketing. Thomas Phinney over at the Adobe Typography
  forums didn't recognize it, but said that this forum would definitely know! I also
  tried What the Font, but it was stumped. The closest it could determine was News
  Gothic, which isn't even close.\r\n\r\nI'm a looooooong-time lurker here, but finally
  got an account! Thanks to everyone who posts such great material here for all of
  us to learn from. Now I may be emboldened to actually post material!\r\n\r\nI also
  attached a PDF version.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nCourtney"

  body: "Upper case has some resemblances to <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/quest-rr/\">Quest
    </a>from Red Rooster, but the C is more open and the A and K are different, among
    other things. (Might be similar enough for your purposes?) Seems like it should
    be in the Bauhaus-style Font ID Guide, but it isn't. \r\n\r\nTreacyfaces Raincheck
    has some similarities too, but lots of differences. (see www.treacyfaces.com)\r\n\r\nA
    search of 'Deco' fonts at MyFonts didn't turn it up either, so I suspect a freeware
    font. Mike F, any ideas?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Courtney - I can tell you that it's called 'Sublime' (not the Coniglio font
    by that name). Unfortunately, it has no copyright in the font itself and an online
    search had too many false leads for me to follow.

  body: "Thanks for all the help! You're right, Mike, it is a pain to locate it. But
    I finally managed to find it by googling [name edited by moderator] which provided
    immediate results. It was available for download at [link edited by moderator].\r\n\r\nI
    never would have found it without the name though!\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\nCourtney"
