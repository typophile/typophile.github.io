  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Ok, I just had to share this - and I know a few of you out there will thoroughly enjoy it.</p>
<p>I was asked by a business acquaintance to help out a new, startup accounting firm in our area. She showed me their &ldquo;brochure&rdquo; (if you or I dare to call it that) and said, &ldquo;See, he needs a lot of help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I sat down, and selected a typeface - one that was a true condensation that would allow for his whole company name to go one line (very long name) and still be &ldquo;readable.&rdquo; After I edited his piece, put it together, I showed where I was up to &ndash; to my acquaintance. She looked at it and said, &ldquo;boring,&rdquo; not realizing it was just the draft of getting the editorial together in clean type (he used Arial for his heads - condensed nauseously, and Bodoni Condensed, all caps for his body copy&hellip;. yucky.</p>
<p>This morning, hubby was kind enough to make a lovely beige background and we embossed his initials into it, as well as embossing the pertinent bits on his &ldquo;front cover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, he received it via email (gee, not like the old days&hellip;) and promptly called. He loved the cleanliness of it (but wanted to see a this and a that) and wanted to know how I selected the typeface.</p>
<p>Of course, the only answer I could think of, was, I didn&rsquo;t go to school to become an accountant, and I worked with some of the best art directors New York has ever seen. A great &ldquo;apprenticeship&rdquo; program, better than working in a bull pen somewhere. Also, I told him stories of Mort Solomon (anyone remember him aka Solomon&rsquo;s Souvenir, used by Fisher-Price for years?) and how Mort would come into class and say things like, &ldquo;Ok, you are going to make wedding invitations for some hippy couple - quick, what typeface do you use?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hope you are enjoying your chuckle too&hellip; gee, how did we all learn to do what we do so well&hellip;. LOL</p>
