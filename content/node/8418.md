body: i have two sony xplod 250w 2/1 channel amps. i bridged them together and ran
  1 amp to a pioneer 12&#34; sub and the other amp to the other sub. the subs take
  450 a piece.is that enough? or too much? i hooked them up through the left and right
  speaker on my radio because my radio only has one set of rca&#39;s coming out. should
  i cut those ends off and sodder the two rca&#39;s together and run them to the amps
  or just do like i have and use the high level input connection
