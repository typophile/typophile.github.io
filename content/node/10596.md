body: does anybody know how to take a scanned image of handwritten alphabet and turn
  it into a font? i&#39;ve tried an online service, fontifier, which doesn&#39;t produce
  very high-res fonts &#40;the font needs to be very crisp and must be able to be
  blown up to a large size&#41;. i&#39;ve tried fontlab, which doesn&#39;t seem to
  be the best way to go for this. any other suggestions?

    target="_blank">HandFont</a> service is based on a template method, <BR>similar
    to Fontifier, but will produce a much higher quality font.

    in FontLab.

  body: ScanFont is quite good for this...there&#39;s still a certain amount of tweaking
    involved, but it&#39;s worth it if you&#39;re interested in the DIY method...
