body: "Hi all\r\n\r\nI want the same image to appear on every page of a document.
  My question is if I put it on a master page instead of on every single page individually,
  does that reduce the file size when building a pdf?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\nRegards"

    are other reasons for having repeating elements on a master page \u2013 it\u2019s
    just so much tidier. \r\nF"

    neater, and a lot easier to change with consistency.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeace,\r\nJT"

  body: "I found that rather than Exporting to pdf, printing the same file to PS and
    distilling reduces the image overhead to nearly nothing -- apparently storing
    it only once.\r\n\r\nIn one case I sent a client vastly downsampled proofs --
    up to the point he started complaining -- because of a single huge image that
    occurred every other few pages. Even after downsampling, the PDF exceeded 10 MB.
    After his final approval, I made a PS file for the printer, converted it to PDF
    to double check -- and it was about 5 MB, with the highest image rez possible.
    Embarrassed looks all around.\r\n\r\nYour mileage might vary."
