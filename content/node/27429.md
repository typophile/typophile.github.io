  Peignot to me but seems to be weighted somewhere slightly heavier than the Medium/Demi
  that I've found. Particularly, the loop on the \"R\" is closed, and the verticals/horizontals
  seem thick, but the \"A\" isn't right to be the bold...\r\n\r\nAm I on the right
  track? (I'm new to this whole world of type...)[img:sites/default/files/old-images/arlenes_3854.gif]"
