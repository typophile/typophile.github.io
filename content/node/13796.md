    the opening or closing titles.\r\n\r\nBut take a look at this dedicated \"<a href=\"http://www.friendscafe.org\"
    target=\"new\">Friends</a>\" site and let us know if you can find a sample of
    the type you are looking for.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------\r\nYes,
    I'm old, but I'm back in style!"

    sure if the friends site that was mentioned uses the actual friends font or if
    the above link is correct either, but maybe this will work?"
