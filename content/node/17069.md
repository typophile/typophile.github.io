    explain what you mean. Do you mean culturally... as in Humanist, Modernist, Bauhaus,
    Art Deco????"

  body: "Another way to categorize type trends would be by technology.\r\nNew technologies
    and new design genres have always gone hand in hand.\r\n\r\nFor example, Baskerville's
    letterforms, his smooth paper, extra black ink, and austere layouts.\r\nIt was
    similar in a way to neoclassical architecture, such as Nash's terraces, where
    the structural material (brick or stone) was covered with white stucco, to create
    the perfect surface -- just as Baskerville had obliterated the wove. No trace
    of process or hint of human scale, a machine finish -- the opposite of arts and
    crafts. So the physical style that is termed Neoclassical may just as well be
    called Mechanist or Scientism (another meaning for these words).\r\n\r\nRight
    now, there's the OpenType movement.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Scientism (in the established
    sense), that's another contemporary movement, headquartered at Microsoft.\r\n"

  body: "I think Didone is more \"Scientist\". Baskerville has a notable humanist
    streak - not \"mechanical\" at all. The exhibition of quality (probably JB's prime
    motivation) isn't necessarily reductionist at all.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
