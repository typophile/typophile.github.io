  attempted to straighten it up from this photo (so you can see it in context).\r\nhttp://www.yugodrivingschool.com.au/b-double.jpg\r\n\r\nI've
  tried Identifont & WhatTheFont, but no luck.\r\n\r\nIt resembles a Letraset font
  I saw when I was a kid, but no luck on the Letraset fonts either.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance.\r\nWarwick"

    might be a font in the Filmotype G series that looks like this, but I'm not sure
    they got this wide or bold. Mark Simonson might know the answer to that one.\r\n\r\n
