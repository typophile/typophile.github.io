  \ alveolar dental nasal  /n/  --  the same character as the Amharic palatal nasal
  /\xF1/  but  flipped 180. \r\n"

  body: "Which Agaw dialect and which orthography?\r\n\r\nThe Unicode Ethiopic block
    is pretty exhaustive and covers the orthographies of more than 80 languages and
    dialects, including, as of Unicode 6.0 some characters found only in single publications.
    If something is missing it is because it hasn't been documented and proposed yet."
