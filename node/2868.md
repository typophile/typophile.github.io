body: Hi, Just to be clear, the title of this book refers to mail not to typography.  <BR>
  <BR>I mentioned this typophile forum to a designer friend, and he asked me to post
  the following. He&#39;s always wanted to know the name of this beautiful serif font.
  Any info is appreciated. Thank you. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/25060.gif"

  body: Looks like Hoefler&#39;s <a href="http://www.typography.com/catalog/requiem/index.html">Requiem</a>.
    You can see it more clearly on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0385315902/ref=sib_dp_pt/102-2383946-5488922#reader-link">Amazon</a>.
    &#40;That includes the italic &#34;of the&#34; as well.&#41;

  body: 'Thank you both for your input.  <BR> <BR>Mark, Requiem it is. I had a &#40;very&#41;
    slight moment of doubt when I saw the &#34;Y&#34; at your link, but the character
    set also shows the &#34;Y&#34; used on the book. I&#39;m sort of partial to that
    particular letter.  <BR> <BR>Just curious: Is there a special name for the vertical
    serifs at the ends of the &#34;T&#34; crossbar? <BR> <BR>My friend will be pleased,
    and I like it too. Thank you.'

  body: Requiem has several alternate characters which can make it a little tricky
    to identify sometimes. The roughness of your sample image threw me at first, too.
    <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think there is a special name for those vertical serifs.
    As far as I know they are just called vertical serifs.
