  body: "Maybe it's better to post your original image without any corrections (not
    even re-size).\r\nIt looks like more than one fonts (unless the image quality
    is so poor, that some serifs have vanished)  and I have the feeling that the upper
    part of initial |B| is a bit deformed.\r\nI can't be sure for any matches but
    you may try:\r\n\r\nfor \"B\": <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=Linotype&ffam=Adobe%20Jenson%20Pro%20-%20Subhead&fid=fca6f5128a91f7f1754ff1bacfafafc2&fstyle=i&fsize=72&text=B&fit=1|Adobe

    BQ (Medium Italic)]]</strong>\r\n\r\n\"J\" & \"A\" look a bit like <strong>[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/claremont-rr/|Claremont
    Extra Bold Italic]]</strong>\r\n\r\n...but I still can't believe that somebody
    mixed so many fonts in a single logo...\r\nThere must be a simpler explanation
    to this\r\n"
