It harbors a corrupt and incorrigible regime/system that's killing and stealing at a greater rate than any other in history.

The orthodox Catholic teaching has always been that ethics derive from natural law, which is the objective character of created reality knowable by the human intellect. This objective reality is the creation of God, but direct appeal to God as moral authority is not necessary to know what is right or wrong: morality is built into the universe and into our own nature.&quot; <BR> <BR>Natural laws are normally refered to as describers of the behaviour of matter and energy. How would you extract a moral from something like the law of gravity? Please explain your point in less mystical language.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The term 'natural law' is not mystical, it has been part of the vocabulary of western philosophy for hundreds of years. The use of the term in the manner you describe is a later development, and in my opinion a misleading one. What you are referring to are so called 'laws' of nature, i.e. properties and relationships of the physical universe. Natural law refers to the idea that morality is not culturally specific or an invention of human intelligence, but refers to objective truths. For a fuller explanation, see the <a href="http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/n/natlaw.htm">Natural Law</a> entry in the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, or the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09076a.htm">Catholic Encyclopedia</a> (the latter acnowledges that in English 'this term is frequently employed as equivalent to the laws of nature').</div>

To claim otherwise is to embrace irrationality, to deny that there is any cognitive relationship between the human intellect and the physical universe we inhabit.</i>  <BR> <BR>Clever rhetoric, John, but we don't share a single intellect. Our relationship with our environment is subjective and relative to our culture. Ask 10 witnesses what they saw during the supermarket robbery. Ask them to define 'reality' or 'justice' or 'evil'. <BR> <BR><i>Not only is this obviously false, it is also very dangerous and plays directly into the hands of tyranny, as Orwell warned.</i> <BR> <BR>Obviously false to <i>you</i>, John. That is far from meaning that it's false. Both of us can produce all sorts of arguments to back ourselves up. What does that mean? Only two interpretations, neither true nor false, from the infinite number of interpretations possible. <BR> <BR>Plays into the hands of tyranny, John? I'm sorry but Tyranny is already upon us and it has nothing to do with relativism. It's doing extremely well as it is, working inside moral codes. We are well beyond Orwell's expectations at this stage. <BR> <BR>M.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Matha: <i>There's nothing modern or leftist about it.</i> <BR> <BR>It does have ancient origins, yes, but it also provides the foundation for modern leftist thinking. I'm talking about the whole Lacan, Foucault, Derrida et al. pantheon, all gods of the identity politics movement that essentially owns the social sciences and humanities today in mainstream US institutions. cf. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1566633354/qid=1052828538/sr=1-3/ref=sr_1_3/103-2526967-1522243?v=glance&amp;s=books">Roger Kimball</a>. <BR> <BR>John H: <i>I don't think leftists have any kind of monopoly on moral relativism or antinomianism. I see plenty of it all around me among those enjoying the material fruits of capitalism.</i> <BR> <BR>I never said they have a monopoly on it. I just said it's the foundation &amp;c. It certainly affects other ideologies as well, particularly the all-rights-and-no-responsibilities libertarian camp. It has less to do with right versus left and more to do with God versus no-God; as you pointed out earlier, &quot;ethics divorced from religion have a tendency to become very shaky and may slip into the kind of relativism you [Matha] describe.&quot; This relativism is everywhere now. Plenty of &quot;conservatives&quot; have certainly succumbed. <BR> <BR>Also, you can vote liberal and still enjoy the material fruits of capitalism. There are plenty of Al Gore supporters driving Cadillac Escalades and sending their kids to private school. Because in the US at least, it's not how you behave that counts, it's how you <i>feel</i>. <BR> <BR>Paul: <i>[Since this thread is hopelessly off-topic&hellip;]</i> <BR> <BR>The PDF thread is still separate.

It's easier to find a benign monarch than a benign cabal of capitalists.
