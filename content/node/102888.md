  here.\r\n\r\nAn obvious countermeasure to the spam problem we're having would be
  to require new users' posts to be passed by a moderator before showing up. But this
  may create an excessive workload, and cause other problems.\r\n\r\nUpon reflection,
  I think that this wouldn't be too onerous either to prospective posters or to the
  moderators if we made one exception to the rule: new users' posts would be queued
  for moderation before appearing, <em>except if they were directed to one of the
  Type ID forums</em>.\r\n\r\nBecause a Type ID request is the one general type of
  posting for which the poster might be in a hurry for an answer.\r\n\r\nAnd this
  would have the side benefit of addressing the issue of Type ID requests turning
  up in the wrong place!"

  body: I think I might be one of the spammers. If you look at my recent activity
    on my profile there are a lot of threads I didn't start. What can I do about this?
    I already changed my password a couple of times recently.

    running community for typographers but such a forum deserves better care. The
    software should be upgraded to a stronger community software in my opinion and
    there should be active moderators all the time organizing and overseeing the forums.
    Everytime I come on here there''s always spam and/or a font ID request in the
    wrong forum. '
