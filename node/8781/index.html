  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">A friend asked for help with this, and I'm having a devil of a time identifying this serif font. As you can see, it was used on an urn label. The original label no longer exists, so we can't get a better image. The mortuary that made it has switched fonts and can't tell us what they used to use. <BR> <BR>Distinctive things I've noted: <BR>- Venetian &quot;e&quot; with slanted crossbar (though the angle it hard to determine) <BR>- &quot;f&quot; has substantial overhang but short crossbar <BR>- Good look at the &quot;b&quot; in the word &quot;Number&quot; where the top serif shape is clear, and you can make out a fairly calligraphic/chiseled shape to the bowl <BR>- &quot;C&quot; has top serif but no bottom serif <BR>- &quot;a&quot; and &quot;c&quot; top terminals have blobby or lachrymal shape. Same for bottom of the &quot;s&quot; <BR>- Short descenders <BR> <BR>We also need to ID the sans face that the label is filled out with (though it might be a typewriter face rather than a font for all I know - it is monospaced). I haven't paid much attention to this one yet, but it's not ringing any bells. Looks a little on the Eurostile side of Helvetica, but monospaced&hellip;. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/63477.jpg" alt="Urn label"></div>

But I did a quick comparo in Photoshop and it certainly seems like is indeed plain old Times.  <BR>I think the typewriter font is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/typewriter-gothic-mt/typewriter-gothic-mt/testdrive.html?s=LEONE+LEWIS&amp;p=48" target="_blank">Typewriter Gothic</a> from Monotype.

		<div class="commentbody">Good grief, maybe it is Times&hellip; I wonder if they did the label with Letraset and rotated the &quot;e&quot; resulting in some of them being slanted? That would explain a lot. <BR> <BR>As for the sans serif, Monotype's Typewriter Gothic is certainly much closer than anything else I've seen, but still not quite right. The serifs on the &quot;I&quot; are too short, and the center join of the &quot;W&quot; is sharp instead of blunt. <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The sans really rings a bell with me. It looks like a word processor or electronic typewriter face that came on daisy printwheels. Such a device might have been used if the mortuary typed or word-processed the information onto a typeset form. <BR> <BR>The face is so familiar I'm sure I have some old printed samples lying around that I could scan in, but I wasn't able to find any. I was able to find some daisy printwheel catalogs on the internet, however. The best seems to be one available <a href="http://www.officemachinewarehouse.com/media/Printwheel_Catalog.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. <BR> <BR>There aren't very many sans faces available for those kinds of printers. The particular face in use here has a distinctive squareness to it, which is why it's reminiscent of Eurostile. The closest face in the catalog is one called Tile. That name seems very familiar (though my memory is quite fuzzy after so many years). Here's a sample from that catalog: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/your_image.gif" alt="Tile1012.jpg"> <BR> <BR>The general shape of the letters seems to match, but the samples differ in minor details. (Of course, we're comparing one scan to another, so it's hard to tell.) The different printwheel manufacturers copied faces from each other right and left, and they probably didn't make exact copies (possibly on purpose). Sometimes they renamed faces. Other sources on the net seem to indicate that a synonym for Tile was Narrator. <BR> <BR>My guess is that it's Tile or some variation. <BR> <BR>s'marks</div>
