body: "My attempts of setting and printing a page (really just a snippet of a page)
  of Latin Vulgate the old-fashioned way. The captions are in Russian , but there's
  nothing new in them for seasoned typophiles :)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ndfi73kNbI\r\n\r\nA
  few notes:\r\n\r\nSadly, my fount does not contain a set of ligatures, long s's,
  half r's and other fraktur niceties.\r\n\r\nI am printing with just a single roller,
  as the other one swelled up and needs replacing (actually, both of them do, but
  triple-inking with just the one works for now).\r\n\r\nOur eagle-eyed masters will
  undoubtedly notice that the sorts are added to the composing stick from the wrong
  end. This is because the matter is already set at this point, and I am just correcting
  the mistakes.\r\n\r\nMissing from the video, are steps for creating hand-made paper,
  painting of the floral borders and illumination of the hand-drawn initials.\r\n\r\nHope
  you enjoy it!"
