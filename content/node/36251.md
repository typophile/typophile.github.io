    want to get my hands on anything Unger. Will you review it for Typographica? I'll
    get you a copy.

    able to digest the text. I heard that the English edition was coming out soon,
    and was excited. I've just placed my order now; thanks for the heads up!

  body: "I bought the book at TypeCon and immediately read it through. A good book
    with a lot of interesting information. \r\n\r\nBits that were particularly new
    to me personally:\r\n\r\n1. The idea that the 'edge effect' intensifies both the
    white and black near a stroke. I think I read this also in G. Noordzij, but here
    it is applied in a practical way. I realize it is closely related to what we here
    on Typophile have debated about 'notan'.\r\n\r\n2. Unger's characteristic handling
    of the mn branches is partly due to a theory that bigger counters will intensify
    contrast, making the blacks more forceful.\r\n\r\n3. The observation that Newspaper
    type has become progressively bigger and narrower over the past 15 years. \r\n\r\nI
    wonder, how much was the book updated from previous Dutch editions? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Chris, one thing I noticed about the Amazon page for this book is that it
    says the book was published in January 2006, when the book I saw at the bookstore
    clearly says 2007 on the copyrights page... I guess Amazon needs to update their
    info more frequently.

    at the end of August. It's weird that they changed the date and now make it seem
    like it's already out. I just hope I get mine soon.

    give them business. I also had 'While You're Reading' on back order with them.
    When I saw it at TypeCon I just bought it and canceled my order with Amazon. \r\n\r\nI'm
    sure that the publisher will get a bigger cut if you order directly from them,
    but not necessarily the author. The basic author percentage is I believe usually
    based on retail price. But if Amazon negotiates a reduced price from the publisher,
    then it may reduce the cut to the author, depending on how the contract is written... "

    let that stop you from doing a review. I've had Unger's book for over a month
    and have been remiss in completing my reviews.\r\n\r\nBesides, my reviews (plural,
    one for design/typographic readers and one for general readership) are more focused
    on Unger's research, views and speculation on readability and user experience.

    their own cut, but handle all the small sales.\r\n\r\nSome publishers won't even
