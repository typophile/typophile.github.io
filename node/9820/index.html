		<div class="commentbody">I'll just note that the design of the Cyrillic and Greek letters in Helvetica Linotype differs very considerably from the earlier Helvetica Cyrillic and Greek designs (the latter from the 1970s, not sure about the Cyrillic). When Linotype approach me about making a version of Helvetica for use as core fonts in software systems, I recommended redesigning the Cyrillic and Greek, and was very happy when Linotype okay'd the budget for this. It should also be noted that Helvetica Linotype was completely respaced (Latin too), because the older Helvetica fonts (and the Helvetica Pro fonts that are based on them) had inherited 18-unit spacing from earlier font formats, so had inconsistent sidebearings. This is important to note, because you won't get the same line-layout between the  Helvetica Pro fonts and the new Helvetica Linotype. So if you have existing documents set in the old Helvetica fonts and don't want them to reflow, you should avoid using the new font for that text. So, for instance, you might find that you end up using the Helvetica Pro fonts for Latin text and Helvetica Linotype only for the Cyrillic and Greek.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yves, I'm not sure if any of the other Helvetica versions can solve your problems in four single fonts. <BR> <BR><i>(The following is not an official statement)</i> For instance, from what I can tell from the Linotype webshop, <a href="http://www.linotype.com/12753/neuehelvetica55roman-font.html" target="_blank">Neue Helvetica Pro</a> fonts have Western Latin and CE character sets in them, but not Greek or Cyrillic.  <BR> <BR>The OpenType fonts in the <a href="http://www.linotype.com/13446/helveticaroman-font.html" target="_blank">Helvetica</a> family on the other hand are different. <b>Std</b> seems to have Cyrillic characters in the character set, but no CE. The surperbly hinted <b>Com</b> version has Latin Extended characters, which include CE glyphs but not Cyrillic ones. <BR> <BR>If text flow issues would be a problem, and you don't think that Helvetica Linotype would be the best solution, I would recommend sending an e-mail to Linotype customer service, at <a href="mailto:info@linotype.com"><a href="mailto:info@linotype.com">info@linotype.com</a></a>. If you tell them exactly what your requirements are, they should be able to give you all of the definitive answers you would need. Additionally, you can call them up if e-mail isn't your thing. Info on that <a href="http://www.linotype.com/10-53-10/contactdetails.html" target="_blank">here</a>. <BR> <BR>I should add that, whenever anyone has questions about Linotype fonts, e-mailing the company support address (<a href="mailto:info@linotype.com"><a href="mailto:info@linotype.com">info@linotype.com</a></a>) is always the best way to get information.

		<div class="commentbody">Yves, your question wasn't misplacesd at all. I just have to point out that for 100%-accurate info about any foundry's fonts, that foundry would be the best source. This isn't marketing spin; I am not a customer service rep, and I can make mistakes, too. <BR> <BR><i>The only reason I asked here was because I deemed the information as found on MyFonts and the Linotype website confusing.</i> <BR> <BR>This is why companies have customer service <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> . Plus, I don't think that Helvetica Linotype is for sale on MyFonts at the moment. <BR> <BR>I think that Typophile is the best source on the internet for opinion and information exchange about typography. This is a great place to ask &quot;what is the best font for this job&quot; or &quot;what are the roots of xxx typeface's design&quot; or even &quot;what is the future of OpenType application support?&quot; <BR> <BR>But the best place to find out whether or not a speciific character range is in a given commercial font is from the distributors themselves. This information is constantly changing. On a forum, you could get inaccurate advice, and then waste or lose time and money. And that would be sad. It would be great if every foundry would have their customer service reps surf typophile and other web forums around the clock to always dispense accurate information. Unfortuantely, this isn't the case at the moment, and a lot of info comes from individuals whose hearts are in the right place, but who may not be aware of certain little details in every case.</div>

Even then, if the person who actually worked on the project leaves the company, typically some knowledge departs with him.</div>
