    really doubt of its legitimacy and quality.\r\nSome commercial alternatives, main

  body: "The book was published by Roma Publications in 2012. Only the book designer/publisher
    knows the source of the lettering. Because the match -- Bernase Roman -- was designed
    by Tom Carnase and Ronne Bonder, photo lettering and/or dry transfer strips would
    probably have been produced. The anonymous author of Berns may have used these
    sources. There is no indication of a previous digital match. The book cover designer
    might have used Berns or some of the old material. The only way to know is to
    ask Roma Publications.\r\nAs for Bernase Roman this is a revision of the old font
    \"DeVinne\" named for Theodore Low De Vinne, and produced in various weights and
    widths. See http://typophile.com/node/99936\r\nHawthorn and Denver are other revisions
    of Devinne. Note that they retain the curved and pointed leg on the R, and straight
    cross stroke,  found in the original DeVinne. \r\nDon"

  body: "Thanks Ryuk for the leads. The speculation in my previous post is not accurate.
    I believe the correct match is Bernase Roman Copyright (c) 1992 Image Club Graphics,
    Inc. I rescaled this font and the \"freeware\" font Berns to a common size and
    determined that, allowing for the slippage of converting formats, Berns is a point
    for point rip of Bernase Roman, which was I believe produced by ICG from non-digital
    sources.\r\nUnfortunately the digital version of Bernase Roman floating \"in the
    wild\" is a font orphan. For the legal status of Image Club fonts see:\r\nhttp://imageclub.org/\r\nIt
    could, however, be reissued by the new owners of the Image Club products.\r\nDon"
