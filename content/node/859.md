body: Not a typography question, but...  <BR>I have a very simple and understated
  design for a business card and have now started sourcing paper which is really going
  to complete this clean card. Do you think that 130lb double thick cover would be
  overkill? And, which finish should I lean towards... Wove or Linen? <BR> <BR>Thanks,
  <BR>BB

  body: Erm, I&#39;m a big fan of wove - linen finishes on machine-made paper are
    a bit corny. IMHO. As far as 130#C goes, I don&#39;t think you necessarily <i>need</i>
    that weight. But I don&#39;t think it&#39;d hurt either. I see so many cards these
    days on 80#C that 110# is enough of a breath of fresh air for me ;-&#41;

  body: Linen is corny because Staples uses it! Especially with thermography. Hmmm...
    nice and cheesy.

  body: The linen paper from Gmund, Valentinoise, is beautiful. The problem with most
    &#40;all?&#41; linen papers is they are machine made. And those machine made papers
    have sadly become associated with the corporate world of the 80s along with the
    colors PMS288 and PMS194. <BR> <BR>So, I&#39;m not disagreeing with you Keith,
    I&#39;m just adding my 2 bits. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    read this.  <BR> <BR>Incidentally Brad, you might look at <a href="http://www.mrfrench.com"
    target="_blank"> French Paper</a> &#40;if you haven&#39;t already&#41;. They make
    very nice uncoated stock. They&#39;ll actually make custom weights and/or finishes
    if you want. I believe the thickest weight they regularly carry is a 21 point
    cover. The other nice thing is that you can buy direct from their website, rather
    than going through a huge distributor for a relatively small order.'

    great. I absolutely agree. But to fake a linen/laid/etc. finish on a machine is
    just ridiculous. Almost sinful...'

  body: Mmm... Gmund. I don&#39;t think that they really can do wrong. excepting them,
    I would have to agree that linen isn&#39;t the way to go. I have to say that I&#39;m
    partial to the double thick mohawk superfine, a paper that has become a habit
    that I just can&#39;t kick.

  body: I would agree with french smart white for cards and proofs, it&#39;s a nice,
    solid white. The only problem with using a laser printer for cards is that you
    are limited to the weight you can run through it-and toner has a habit of rubbing
    off after a while.  <BR> <BR>Try also Mohawk Najavo and Superfine, I&#39;ve run
    both through a laser printer with great sucess.  <BR> <BR>Fox River Starwhite
    looks good, as do Gilbert Neutech and Realm

  body: '&#62;The only problem with using a laser printer for cards  <BR> <BR>I think
    I wasn&#39;t so clear - the laser printing compatability comment was for Colin
    &#40;resumes&#41; and BJ &#40;specimens&#41;. I agree wholeheartedly with Ben
    - laser printing business cards is a bad idea. Smart White &#40;and Speckletone&#41;
    function very well in offset conditions. From my experience anyway. And letterpress
    for that matter. <BR> <BR>I also must condone, without reservation, Ben&#39;s
    Mohawk Superfine habit. Be careful: it can lead to harder things. It&#39;s good
    to hear that it&#39;ll run through a laserjet. <BR> <BR>&#62;as do Gilbert Neutech...
    <BR> <BR>Am I right in remembering that Neutech was introduced as a substrate
    for direct-to-plate printing? Or is my brain farting on me?'

  body: I&#39;m not sure if it was or not, but it&#39;s marketed as their &#34;digital&#34;
    paper. I have a vague memory of running it through a laser printer with good success
    before, and it has a nice opacity. <BR> <BR>I kind of have a thing for seeing
    what will go through laser printers, my favorite of which is the HP 5000, which
    will take almost any kind of paper, as long as it&#39;s not too rough, including
    90 pound watercolor paper. And don&#39;t forget printing black on black paper
    with a glossy color laser printer-subtle and delightful.

    that one. <BR> <BR>I had a prof in grad school who used to run through two printers
    a year. She&#39;d run 300# watercolor paper sewn together with yarn and collaged
    on through a HP inkjet on a daily basis. Unfortunately I&#39;ve never had balls
    like that.'

  body: If you are going with lithography, I rather like Potlatch McCoy Matte 100#
    for business cards. If you want something to set you apart, try Glama natural
    or one of Appleton&#39;s Curious line &#40;translucent&#41;. A more subtle break
    from convention would be Strathmore Elements. For letterhead and envelopes, if
    you can afford it, nothing says it like 100% cotton.  <BR> <BR>If you&#39;re concerned
    about in house printing on a particular device, call and ask for some samples
    from the manufacturer, then run some test sheets through the printer in question.

    superfine and French smart white.  <BR> <BR>BB
