  body: "Hi Renier, \r\nwelcome to Typophile!\r\n\r\nThis is an Anglo-Saxon \u2018Print'
    style, ultra-geometric, ultra-ugly and anti-ergonomic.\r\nAs Fred says, this might
    be hand-rendered. For fonts, the closest I know of is <a href=\"http://www.schoolhousefonts.com/Schoolhouse/samples.htm\">DMOA
    Print Arrow Line/Set A</a> by Schoolhouse Fonts.\r\nCheers,\r\nF"
