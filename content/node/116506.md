      i etterkant og at det faktisk er custom, hadde h\xE5pet at det var en font \u2013
      jeg fortsetter \xE5 lete litt. "

  body: I don't read Norwegian but still thinking the same as Frode. Not a font, should
    be a custom signage. Having a look to [[http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Jeff_Levine|Jeff
    Levine]] collection may worth a shot.

  body: '[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/suitcase/vafle|Vafle]] looks not so far actually.
    With some little tweaking you could get pretty close mainly lowering /A crossbar
    and reworking /R leg starting from /P or borrowing it from [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/suitcase/idealista|Idealista]],
    another Suitcase.'

    body: "Thanks mate, yeah I had was hoping that this wasn't a custom job and that
      the typeface was out there somewhere, but Frode is probably right. I'm guessing
      that the company producing these carriages would have made more than this one
      off signage, I will keep researching. Thanks for your suggestions, there are
      a few pretty close ones in Jeff Levines collection.. I was even toying with
      Linotypes Case Study nr 1, http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/case-study-no-one-lt/pro-medium/
      but it still needs to be adjusted slightly... Cool, thanks again! \r\n\r\nThis
      is the actual carriage I am researching: http://digitaltmuseum.no/things/restaurantvogn/NJB/JM003542/gallery?name=Personvogner&search_context=1&count=2429&pos=1 "

  body: "They probably did make more than one-off signs, but instead of a typeface
    (which at this time was not readily reproducible at this scale), they would have
    used technical drawings specifying the individual letters. [[https://www.flickr.com/photos/ralf_herrmann/2648878637/|This
    sort of thing.]] Traffic signs, street signs, etc. would then be lettered according
    to these exacting specifications. (By \"draughtsmen\", vet inte vad det kan t\xE4nkas
    heta p\xE5 Norska.) So what I would do is to look at the archive of the Norwegian
    railroads for a source.\r\n\r\n<em>Edit: Put in a better version of a technical
    specification</em>"

    body: Ah yes, good point. Of the things I have managed to get my hands on from
      the 'Norsk Jernbanemusem' archives all have different typographic treatment,
      see image. I might have to settle with something that looks similar, preferably
      from the same era for this job, time is of the essence :) Cheers Birdseeding!

  body: "Maybe our <a href=\"https://monokrom.no/fonts/telefon\">Telefon</a> is a
    suitable alternative? It\u2019s not a revival of any particular style, but an
    amalgamation of the interbellum types, shop lettering, signage, posters &c found
    scattered around Scandinavia.\r\n\r\nBtw: The last three lines are Futura, I think.
    And the one above might be one of the many predecessors of Akzidenz Grotesk and
    Helvetica."
