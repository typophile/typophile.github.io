body: "I'm mainly working on the et since I think it receives a little more work,
  but what style is the commonly used in Irish?  Most of the examples I see all have
  a top that correspondes to a the top bar of a z, but from there there seems to be
  a range of finishing strokes:<!--break-->\r\n<ul><li>diagonal descender, the \"lowered
  7\"</li>\r\n<li>diagonal finish at baseline, a \"stubby 7\"</li>\r\n<li>a long descender
  finishing curved leftward, like a j</li>\r\n<li>a normal stroke with or without
  serif, like an i</li>\r\n<li>a normal stroke with a rightward curl, like a t</li>\r\n<li>a
  diagonal finish at baseline plus rightward curl.</li></ul>\r\nWhich of these would
  be most common?  The road sign examples I find on wikipedia are all sans serif,
  so while I like the appearance of the last one, I'm not sure how \"readable\" it
  would be, or weird-looking.  A lot of the other examples I can find online are all
  from the middle ages, and so not too much help for my font.\r\n\r\nI've inluded
  a document with article one of the UDHR in Irish, replacing agus with \u204A, and
  repeating it for each of the above described variants.  Any suggestions or other
  variants that y'all know of?"

  body: "It is normal for a diagonal or a perpendicular stroke to descend below the
    baseline. On the rare occasions when the vertical stroke doesn't descend below
    the baseline the entire character is reduced in size so that the horizontal element
    is proportionately smaller.\r\n\r\nConcerning the examples on the pdf:\r\n1 is
    fine.\r\n2 and 6 would be acceptable, but I'd shorten their horizontal strokes
    to maintain the overall proportions of the characters.\r\n3 and 4 are unnatural.
    A short line is sometimes found at the bottom of the vertical stroke, but it doesn't
    take the form of a hook - rather it resembles a half serif.\r\n5 is unrecognizable
    - if I had to guess I'd say it was a \"j\". Hooks are out, and left-facing hooks
    are completely out.\r\n\r\n"
