  seem to have experience with the Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator tool.\r\n\r\nI'm
  trying to create a keyboard layout which includes some of the more useful unicode
  characters.  Mostly I am doing this for myself but if anyone wants it, I'll be happy
  to send them the layout.  It's based originally on a US keyboard layout.\r\n\r\nI
  would like to use the caps-lock key as another shift key.  I see there is a way
  to use it as SGCAPS mode in the keyboard creator.  But the key still functions as
  a locking toggle.  As in, you press the caps-lock key and you're in caps-lock mode,
  then you press it again and you are out of the mode.  Is there any way to create
  a keyboard layout where this key is not a toggle?\r\n\r\nMichael Grant"

  body: "Michael,\r\nI have completed a fairly large project on pi fonts, which involved
    creating many of keyboard layouts for these fonts.\r\nTo facilitate my work, I
    have written a Python script that will convert a Mac-XML keyboard layout to Windows
    KLC format \u2013 thus I am fairly familiar with its peculiarities.\r\n\r\nAt
    ATypI 2011, I had the chance to <a href = \"http://www.atypi.org/past-conferences/2011-reykjavik/programme/activity?a=59\">talk</a>
    about the project, and also promised that this conversion script will one day
    be part of the Adobe FDK. While this is still true, I have no idea how quickly
    this will happen.\r\n\r\nI am still planning to do a write-up about all that work
    on Typblography and plan on including my presentation PDF.\r\nPlease get in touch
    with me if you would like to have the PDF earlier, the script, or both.\r\n\r\nFrank\r\n"

  body: "I've already used the alt-gr keys as a sort of compose key in my keyboard
    layout.  Here's what I've been working on:\r\n\r\nhttp://grant.org/mgrant/uscmpse/windows-compose-key.html\r\n\r\nThe
    goal of my layout was to extend the US keyboard.  All the original keys sequences
    are unchanged (including ctrl-keys).  Everything that was added was with the addition
    of the alt-gr key.\r\n\r\nIt's not yet complete in my opinion but it's quite usable
    (though one could question *what* exactly you would need all these characters
    for!)  However, I must admit in my day to day life, I do find myself using several
    of these characters (like \u20AC and \xA3 and \u2260), especially as they are
    easily accessible from my keyboard in more or less logical places.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    there are a few other characters I'd like to add to this mapping and I'm starting
    to lack a logical place to put them.  \r\n\r\nIt would be useful if I had another
    shift state.  Is there a way to get it to work like holding down a shift/ctrl/alt-gr
    key?  Or is it always a toggle?\r\n\r\nIt would also be useful if I could create
    \"dead-dead\" keys so I could, for example, create a key sequence like alt-gr
    . . . to produce an ellipsis '\u2026'.\r\n\r\nIf I can't do these things with
    the Microsoft Layout Creator, is there some way I could create the required DLL
    from c# myself?\r\n\r\nI also have seen the Japanese keyboard which does a pretty
    cool thing of allowing the user to choose a character by composing it from the
    phonetics.  Perhaps I could use this method, but is there a tool to create those
    sort of mappings like the Layout Creator?\r\n\r\nMichael Grant"

  body: "MSKLC is/has been a spare-time project by Michael Kaplan et al. at Microsoft
    (AFAIK); therefore it does not get a lot of maintenance. I think it is not possible
    to create a \u2018smart\u2019 keyboard like the Japanese one with the tool\u2019s
    capabilities.\r\nThere is another editor called \u2018KBDedit\u2019, which definitely
    can do some more things; but I am not sure if you can go as far even with that
    one.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the idea a keyboard with a lot of alternative characters
    idea is quite widespread; multiple shift states come with every Mac keyboard layout
    (for accessing lower-use characters like \u2020 \u2026 \xA3 \xA2 etc.).\r\nThose
    keyboards usually use four shift states:\r\n\r\n\u2013 unshifted\r\n\u2013 shift\r\n\u2013
    alt\r\n\u2013 alt+shift\r\n\r\nThe state you are still missing in your project
    (and that would give you room to accommodate a whole buch of characters) is alt-shift.\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for the tip!  I bought a full copy of KBDedit to play with it.  It's
    fairly complete, it has some nice features in that it looks like one can modify
    the keymap in real time.  It's also easy to add in several other modifier shift
    keys.  Like I could turn the useless Menu key into a Kana key and have a few more
    shift states (kana, kana-ctrl, kana-shift, kana-shift-ctrl).  \r\n\r\nI did not
    see how to use KBDedit to add dead-dead keys, but it almost looks like it should
    be possible.\r\n\r\nYes, you're right, I could just add more shifted states.  I
    may have to do that.  However, I'm trying hard to keep things where I'll remember
    them.  It's logical to remember to do something like alt-~, =, / to produce \u2247.
    \ alt-~, = produces this on my kb: \u2245.  Yah, I guess I could do alt-~, kana-=,
    but it's not terribly memorable.\r\n\r\nAre there tools that let one build japanese
    style keyboards like KBDedit and MSKLC?\r\n\r\n"

    body: "Hi Frank!\r\n\r\nI have designed and developed a keyboard for Mac OS X
      for Assamese language which is my mothertongue.  I have designed it after researching
      on a sample of 34lacs characters. Here, I have used option key as a one of the
      shift states. It is working fine and many people are using it.\r\n\r\nNow, many
      people are asking a version of it for Windows. I have designed one using MSKLC.
      It works fine while typing in internet browsers but problem arises while typing
      in MS word/ Writer etc because I used the ctrl key as one shift state. As MSKLC
      does not allow to use the alt key. But using the alt key is very essential for
      the layout that I have designed.\r\n\r\nWhile searching in the net, I found
      the conversion script that you have written and tried it. But unfortunately
      it is showing certain errors. I do not know php. One my friends helped me by
      rectifying few indentation errors. But the problem is still there and am unable
      to generate the .klc file. This script would be a great help to me as I am planning
      to develop keyboards for all the major Indian languages. For me developing the
      keyboard with the help of Ukelele is easy and if I could export them into .klc
      through your script it would be of  great help to us. Its worthy to mention
      that I am doing it for free for the people. \r\n\r\nI would be grateful to you
      if you could help me in this matter. I can send the mac keyboard layout file
      to you for testing. Or the keyboard layout can be found here --> \r\n\r\n[[http://xahitya.org/Downloads/Tools/Lachit_1_0_3.zip]]\r\n\r\nThanks

    they have everything I wanted to have when I started this project 2 years ago.
    \u2014 But, of course, during these 2 years my goals have changed, and now, again,
    just a small fraction of what I want is implemented.  (But most of the infrastructure
    is there, so additions should be much easier now\u200A\u2014\u200AI hope!)\r\n\r\nThe
    code to count the number of available characters is broken by the updates of the
    recent months; I think that about 3\u2396500 characters are accessible without
    <code>Compose</code>, and maybe a thousand more with.  The current state is summarized
    in [[http://math.berkeley.edu/~ilya/keyboard/iz/windows/izKeys-visual-maps.html#compose-key|the
    progress report section of the docs]].\r\n\r\nNow the major goals is to bring
    the docs up to an appropriate level, and fix all Windows applications with broken
    keyboard input handling (yes, <strong>ALL</strong> the applications I checked
    do it wrong; and, yes, I think I know the right way\u200A\u2014\u200Awhich, of
    course, is not documented anywhere\u200A\u2014\u200Aor at least further than my
