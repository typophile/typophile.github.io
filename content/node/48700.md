  for a new site called, \"BrandMinute.\"\r\n\r\nThe site's text is Georgia, however,
  I'd like to use a wordmark that integrates well with search engine-friendly Georgia,
  while better presenting the mission of the web site (a blog that covers major brands
  in about a minute).\r\n\r\nTo check it out, visit [[http://www.BrandMinute.typepad.com]].\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance,\r\nBob\r\n\r\n"

    With all those brands... \u2013 don't ask why \u2013 but I would look at the Emigre
    library."

  body: "How distinctive / unique do you want the mark to be?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe range
    of options runs from the basic \u2014 using Georgia or Arial \u2014 to the most
    unique or distinctive option: creating a new mark from scratch, not using fonts.
    There are plenty of in betweens, using available fonts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nonce you
    determine that, it'd be easier to point you in a direction.\r\n\r\nBurger King's
    mark was done by Ian Brignell, btw."

  body: "Thanks Brieck and beejay for your comments. I misused the word \"wordmark.\"
    I simply am looking for a typeface that would complement Georgia, while establishing
    a meaningful expression for the name, BrandMinute.\r\n\r\nBrieck mentioned a sans
    from the Emigre library. Vista Sans? \r\n\r\nBeyond that, how about something
    like Frutiger? Or Gotham?\r\n\r\nThanks..."

  body: "\r\nas Beejay sais, it\xB4s about finding the right balance between neutrality
    against the content/the brands, and a personal expression for the brand itself,
    BrandMinute.\r\n\r\nWhen you are talking about fonts like Vista sans, frutiger
    or Gotham etc. I assume that it does not need to be a browser safe font. I would
    either go with a classic sans, with a familiar, quite neutral expression, but
    with a bit of personal expression. Something from the Franklin gothic family is
    one suggestion. The other way I think is to find a Display serif font that has
    the characteristics of Georgia, but with a more detailed outline for text in bigger
    sizes in headlines etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPatrik Castenbladh"

  body: I'm seeing it in Interstate Bold. It's a very commercial font that can express
    fast pacing (like a minute) and won't distract from the other brands on display.

  body: "This is a good dialogue. Franklin Gothic and Interstate are also interesting
    with Georgia, espeically when trying to differentiate the BrandMinute brand around
    so many competing brands on [[http://www.brandminute.typepad.com]]\r\n\r\nI have
    also been recommended Stag Sans [[http://vllg.com/Schwartzco/StagSans/mudTyper+Weights/]].\r\n\r\nComments?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I don't have much to add to the suggestions so far. What's missing for me
    in this conversation is some more context. I'd like to hear more about the primary
    criteria for the wordmark -- <cite>\"better presenting the mission of the web
    site\"</cite>.\r\n\r\nWhat then is the mission of the web site? Or perhaps more
    to the point when considering typefaces for a simple wordmark: what are you trying
    to convey about your own BrandMinute brand? -- Give us some adjectives, some characteristics
    that you're trying to convey. \r\n\r\nWhat is it about the faces you've mentioned
    that appeals to you, speaks to you, or represents some aspect of what you're trying
    to communicate? That way, we have some guidelines for suggesting alternatives.\r\n\r\n<cite>\"Integrates
    well with search engine-friendly Georgia\"</cite> is a pretty broad target and,
    really, only a secondary criteria.\r\n\r\nPatrik wrote: <cite>The other way I
