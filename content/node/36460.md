  body: Nearly every sans serif text typeface in the [[FontFont]] library has lining
    and text figures included, with text figs as the default style. Many of these
    FontFonts are listed in the thread Paul linked, but <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=FontFont+sans+-ot+-purchase&site=d&start=0&num=100&sample_text=0123456789&sample_size=48">here's
    a handy search of FontShop.com with the figures from all the sans FFs displayed</a>.

  body: "To the best of my knowledge, the first sans with lower case numbers was Futura.
    \r\n\r\nThe first digitization was by Sacks and Quay, The Foundry Architype Renner.
    \r\n\r\nThe first modern sans serif superfamily was the seminal Today Sans Serif,
    Volker K\xFCster for Scangraphic, 1987, with OSF, small caps, all f-ligs, all
    weights, two optical sizes, etc., and available from a number of distributors.\r\n\r\nMany
    poorly known but excellently implemented (by among others A-J Pool) URW sans serif
    families come with OSF and SC -- including News Gothic if memory serves. These
    are, again if memory serves, in the URW 'Design Collection', a relatively inexpensive
    collection of competent goodies. \r\n\r\nI imagine Font Bureau is a good source
    for sans serifs with osf. "
