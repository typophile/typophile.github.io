  body: Thanks - I thought it might be Bureau Grotesque but the angled &#34;t&#34;
    threw me. Since I don&#39;t have that font I&#39;m gonna fake it with Folio Bold.

  body: Vonnes, actual Macromedia &#34;typeface,&#34; is based on a typeface family
    that you should found on the Jasper and Johnston Encyclopedy of typefaces. To
    far from my own library to give the page number.

  body: Yes. Well, the question was about Boston magazine, but you are right that
    it was originally used/created for Macromedia.
