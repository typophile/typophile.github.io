  printed specimen</a> online (preview attached) with a great rounded sans titled
  Breite runde Grotesk.\r\n\r\nIt is sourced as from \"Schriftproben, C.G. Naumann,
  1901\". This is a printer's book and I'm looking for both more info (foundry/designer/context)
  and for a better specimen (full alpha at least). \r\n\r\nThanks everyone,\r\nAaron."

  body: The typeface is patterned on Round Gothic, which appeared in the ATF syndicate's
    type specimen books around 1884. The ATF version was bolder and more condensed,
    but the letterforms are unmistakably the same. I will be coming out with a font
    based on the original next month.

    for id. The origin is from a German printer specimen so I don't belive you will
    find it in american type foundry specimens. I've flipped though mines without

    similar to the one Nick\u2019s working on.\r\nSee http://www.typophile.com/node/29138
    and http://typophile.com/files/runde_6377.jpg\r\n\r\nAs noted in the linked thread
    there is a digital version by lineto:\r\nhttp://www.lineto.com/The+Fonts/Font+Categories/Text+Fonts/Number+Two/\r\n(The
    lineto versions seems different from the one from A.-G. f\xFCr Schriftgie\xDFerei
    und Messinglinien Offenbach and it\u2019s said that it was based on a \u2018Berthold
    Schmale Runde Grotesk\u2019.)\r\n\r\nI think it\u2019s hard to tell which one
    was created earlier unless someone could point out the exact dates of release.\r\n\r\nFor
    some interesting infos on rounded Grotesks see also:\r\nhttp://issuu.com/fontfont/docs/ff_din_round"

    is great reading. \r\n\r\nI'm going to continue the hunt for more info and images
    of Breite Runde Grotesque. I think it's interesting that it is a full-width type
    and has some curious proportions. I particularly love the numerals. \r\n\r\nAny
    experts in turn-of-the-last-century German type have some good specimen books?"

    then. I didn\u2019t see the thin joints in your FontLab screenshot, Nick.\r\nI
    doubt it\u2019s safe to say which one is patterned on the other one though. This
    is aggravated by the fact that a lot of 19th century type specimen had no date
    on them.\r\n\r\nBTW, great scans and specimen photos on flickr, nike! Aaron, have
    you checked nike\u2019s flickr albums? There are some real treasures to be found
    there."

    (and cannot get your hands on the originals) I recommend these two books:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Type-Visual-History-Typefaces-Graphic/dp/3836511010/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1288164374&sr=8-2\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Visual-History-Typefaces-Graphic-1901-1938/dp/3836515148/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_b\r\n\r\nAlthough
    I remember being slightly disappointed by the accompanying texts these are well-crafted
    books, lovingly presenting great turn-of-the-last-century typefaces, with a considerable
    proportion of German ones.\r\nAnd inside of each book there\u2019s a code which
    allows you to download hi-res and -quality scans of the original type specimen
    books."

  body: '@aarhaus I actually discovered this sample looking over nike''s flickr collection.
    It jumped out as quite unusual. It''s the only place I''ve found it at all. Thanks
    for the tips! I have the first volume of the Taschen book, might have to finally
    and get the second. The DIN Round PDF sort of dances right around this sample,
    I suppose it''s too round to have mentioned. '

  body: "The company C.G. Naumann wasn't actually a typefoundry but a Leipzig printer
    and publisher at the turn of the century. So in this book they probably show typefaces
    they had on offer for printing and bought from other manufacturers.\r\nEither
    the Deutsche Bibliothek in Leipzig or Klingspor Museum in Offenbach might have
    more material, the latter at least owns the best collection of specimen books
    I know of. \r\nMaybe you want to contact somebody there or the best expert in
    German type history, especially Grotesk cases I know: Eckehart Schumacher-Gebler.
    If you want I can email or DM you contact information.\r\n\r\nWhat astonishes
    me is that I couldn't find the typeface in Seemann\u2019s \xBBHandbuch der Schriftarten\xAB\u2014the
    most important specimen of almost all typefaces and all foundries available at
    that time. But I only had a super brief look."

  body: "I love investigations like this ...\r\n\r\nJust now I see that aarhaus posted
    a link to a scan from the \xBBSeemann\xAB already. \r\nIndeed, there's only the
    Schmale runde Grotesk included. But since we now find this typeface stated as
    being cast by Bauer & Co, Aktiengesellschaft f\xFCr Schriftgie\xDFerei und Maschinenbau
    Offenbach (both taken over by Berthold later) and J. John S\xF6hne Hamburg, I
    guess that the matrices were purchased from the same manufacturer, likely Wagner
    & Schmidt, Leipzig, and then cast almost identically by the different foundries.\r\nSame
    can be the case with Breite runde, only that I don't find it in any specimen I
    have.\r\n\r\nThe picture from the Naumann book shows Breite magere Grotesk by
    Schelter & Giesecke, Leipzig on the opposite left side and also the strange Columbus
    some pages before was cast by them. So maybe Breite runde came from S&G as well,
    or at least from another Leipzig foundry? \r\nWell, I think I'll just contact
    Eckehart and cc you. Don't know how good he is at English correspondence.\r\n\r\n((Frode:
    thanks, still have to get accustomed to suddenly appear so colourful here. It's
    taken from my twitter but I'll likely get back to the standard placeholder T sooner
