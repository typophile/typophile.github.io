    \ ;-)\r\n\r\nReal quick:\r\n- The narrowness makes it suitable only for display
    and very short text. In that context, the vertical proportions are decent. However
    the grid-conscious chunkiness is more attuned to smaller sizes. Basically: narrowness
    and grid-conscious outlines are rarely rational partners.\r\n- In some sizes the
    descenders are touching the ascenders of the subsequent line.\r\n- The spacing
    needs work; look at \"oxi\" and \"brew\". If anybody has a budget for respacing
    it you know who to call.  :-)\r\n- The widths of the capitals are too divergent,
    especially for this style of type.\r\n- The \"g\" and \"s\" are out of character.\r\n\r\nBTW

    (about) that, because the degree of difference is negligible, or imperceptible
    without a close examination. I haven\u2019t memorized every detail of what Alternate
    Gothic looks like (despite having licensed it c.1990 and used it for several years),
    so I am taking your word for it that your revival is quite close to the original,
    which substantiates my general impression.\r\n\r\nWithout checking against the
    original, and after giving your design a closer look, I suspect you have softened
    it up a bit, making the rounded vertical stems curved, not straight with two tangential
    extrema, which is how I remember the bold condensed sans faces were made from
    1840 on, so it does seem slightly revisionist. But you\u2019re in good company\u2014that\u2019s
    how recent updates to Univers Condensed have been done. And the three weights,
    not quite sure how they would fall in relation to the original. Also, I\u2019m
    guessing your /e\u2019s crossbar is lighter than in the original, and the tail
    of your /y doesn\u2019t look authentic, I suspect the original would have been
    perpendicular across the bottom, not an angled kink. And so on.\r\n"

      is not much like Alt Gothic at all. Same way that Steve Madden is not like Givenchy.\r\nThe
      first weight started from public domain scans of alt gothic, ATF 1912. Basic
      scans, nothing fancy. From there it was a matter of making a functional webfont
      of that general 'alt gothic' style. There's been a few around before, but never
      fully 'free licensed' i believe. I never really tried to stay close or purposely
      deviate from the original specimens, hence a certain indifference crept in (which
      i like). Also looked at quite a few specimens of other historic, condensed gothics,
      (the sort of faces that Alt Gothic itself was derived from, no doubt) just to
      inform a few details. The first version was put out pretty quick, proved popular
      & got feedback & got some fixes and tweaks. Further weights and version were
      drawn directly from the original Oswald weight."

  body: "i moved the quote from hrant from [[http://typophile.com/node/95079 | here]]
    to below, because it's a good one.\r\n<blockquote>It's neither the popularity
    nor the free/open-source nature of Oswald* that causes \"long-term\" type designers
    to see flaws in it. We see flaws in it because there are flaws in it. More to
    the point: if you were to invest more time into it there would be fewer flaws.
    Except you don't live in a barrel.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI totally see and accept
    the flaws, but the remit for a font like Oswald was not to create a flawless font.
    The remit was very clear; this -\r\nmake a highly popular and easy to use webfont,
    i.e. one which would be used by a lot of web designers to typeset a <strong>lot</strong>
    of text on the web, text that previously would have been text-as-a-bitmap-image-file,
    a.k.a. turn a lot of jpegs and gifs on the web into editable, searchable, copyable
    , shareable, active text. \r\n\r\nLooking at the stats, the adoption of Oswald
    amongst web designers has been strong, and the stats for it's api pulls show that's
    it's being read a lot, only Open Sans is being read more as a webfont right now.
    I think we can also assume from the stats that Oswald's steady rise in adoption
    by designers meant that there have not been any real world issues with legibility,
    or other similar issues that would 'turn off' readers.\r\n\r\nWith the design
    of Oswald, it's easy to say 'meh' and stuff like \"it's Alt Gothic renamed\" etc
    but going down that route leads you away from some very interesting type related
    stuff, in my opinion. Oswald contains an 'approximation' of a type style, it was
    built like that purposely because the design process would be quick and i sensed
    it would result in a popular webfont (i was right on both). I think that 'approximation-ness'
    may be a too often overlooked aspect of designing fonts. For example, fashion
    designers use it a lot, and in the right hands it's an art in itself. H&F-Jones
    do it a <strong>lot</strong> with type, and to great success, but have smartly
    branded it more high-end, under 'revival'. But Oswald was not designed for that
    league; it was created as a straightforward approximation of a clear popular style,
    plus there should be no licensing issues with it's use, plus it should be easy
    to get at and use, and also the design does have amounts of it's own personality.
    It's a no brainer really?\r\n\r\nThe money thing; The design of Oswald was funded
    by Google as they were the only people at that time who were interested in funding
    the ideas behind a type experiment like Oswald. The connection is obvious looking
    at the question \"what sort of fonts would get a lot of web designers using active
    text in place of bitmapped text?\" :) I doubt that any other type-related companies
    would have funded an experiment like that, seen it's interest, or could have provided
    the tools to make it happen.\r\n\r\n-v\r\n\r\nps if anyone else is funding how
    to make highly popular webfonts, you know who to call ;)\r\n"

    derivative or generic designs to be interesting (unless they\u2019re mine).\r\nRendering
    issues don\u2019t excite me either, although I do admit that they can occasionally
    inform type designs in an interesting manner.\r\nOf course, usability is extremely
    important in the marketplace, but more often than not it is the uninteresting
    fonts that are most usable and hence popular, because their neutrality and familiarity
    are easy to work with.\r\n\r\nAnd that is why I don\u2019t consider Oswald to
    be an experiment.\r\nNone of the most popular Google webfonts are experimental,
    but this is:\r\nhttp://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Snowburst+One\r\n\r\nWell
    done Vernon, you have exploited the Google webfont opportunity and created a \u201Cbest-seller\u201D,
    owning the niche of bold condensed gothic web font, in the way that Gotham/Proxima
    owns its niche. Now you can build on that, perhaps by extending its range to include
    italics or a single-bowl /a and /g variant. More importantly from a \uFB01nancial
    perspective, you could monetize this product (if you can resolve the name issue)
    and produce desktop variants under your own foundry imprint, that may be licensed
    via commercial font distributors."

    conceptualising and digging into what you do and why you do it. A lot of artists

    into specifically putting together some 'conference' presentations i would like
    to give sometime & blog posts. Also the more i get into this area the more i think
    there's a 'story to tell', especially as people in different areas of design &
    tech are telling similar stories, but from their separate fields.\r\nOk, so first
    off, i didn't really want 'feedback' on the typeface (e.g. \"is my 'a' too fat?\"),
    but it's interesting to what i am writing about to understand a little of how
    designers on a forum such as Typophile view Oswald, and what would they think
    and say about it, because it reveals something about why other people design type,
    and what they think type does when it functions out there in the world.\r\nSo
    in terms of subject matter, i am writing about type in a world where there are
    technological, commercial and social shifts occurring pretty radically, which
    are effecting artistic and design production, and are effecting the way that digital
    matter is authored and consumed.  Some of the things that are in the thick of
    all this are; textual information and it's distribution, viral spread of style
    or behaviour via the internet, intellectual property rights & it's relation to
    innovation and creation. Type is just one field effected by these shifts, so it's
    interesting to see how these changes are occurring in say, publishing or fashion
    design, as well as in type.\r\n"

    be free if Google were a not-for-pro\uFB01t staffed by volunteers.\r\nAs it is,
    Google webfonts are, among other things, a promotion for the Google brand, and
    a means for it to monitor website usage, which is valuable information for its
    core business. These are encumbrances.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve been here before, prior

    these past 25 years is in some way complicit with the exploding income gap; but
    not being an economist or academic, it\u2019s just a feeling.\r\n\r\nAs an artist,
    I\u2019m very aware how hard it is to make a living producing creative content
    as a writer, artist, fashion designer, or musician, now that the means of production
    and distribution are open to everyone everywhere; and how the humanities are being
    derogated in academia. Culture has certainly been democratized, but not wealth.
    \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t think fonts are typical of this situation, because they are
    professional tools rather than consumable products like music, clothes, pictures,
    \uFB01lms, games or writing. That makes big-picture generalizations about software

    I refer you to the Mercruiser 350 and a W\xE4rtsil\xE4-Sulzer RTA96 analogy above.
    \r\n\r\nIt could be purely coincidental, but i bet that commercial webfont use
    has risen as a result of the huge usage the google webfont services have had.
    Certainly the ease-of-use, nothing to lose, aspect of trying a webfont from the
    google service is a significant non-hurdle to adoption. Once designers have tried
    the technology, they are more inclined to think to use that technology, to sign
    up with a commercial service, and be able to convince their clients that extra
    cost is a good investment.\r\n\r\nNick Shinn - Richard Stallman, the 'godfather'
    of the free software movement, has suggested that the use of webfonts endangers
    users' freedom, as does any practice of running programs that come across the
    network. If the program comes straight from a server, then in practice you don't
    have control of it, and it's effectively not-free. That's the only serious argument
    i have heard for saying that free webfonts are in fact not 'free'. It's a good

    used in the production of products for sale, they are used only once\u2014consumed\u2014and
    even if they are repurposed for anthologies, or reused (e.g. stock photography),
    it\u2019s not quite the same as fonts, where such reuse is the rule rather than
    the exception."

  body: "<blockquote>\"Surely a 'professional tool' is just a type of item in the
    'consumable product' basket.\"\r\nIt is, with the addition of skill, not only
    in its use, but in its choice.</blockquote>\r\n\r\ndberlow & Nick Shinn - Yes,
    exactly. So there is a clear distinction that we can make here that completely
    separates a 'professional tool' like a font, from  those other sorts of objects
    that are not 'professional tools'. So a font is made by one set of skills, personified
    by the typeface designer, for specific use within another set of skills, personified
    by the graphic designer, printer, art director. We can see a clear 'market' within
    that too. Font X takes Y amount of skill & labour, so designer B will invest Z
    amount of $$s into acquiring use of Font X in order to make his product B worth
    more $$s. That works very well.\r\n\r\nHowever, i think that is also a snapshot
    of an historic era; the world no longer fits as neatly into that hole as it did
    say over 10 years ago. There are other things today. Graphic designers and printers
    are no longer the sole consumers of fonts (just like by the 1970's printers were
    no longer the sole consumers of fonts).  Nowadays, where the boundaries between
    producer and user has eroded (what Axel Bruns calls [[http://produsage.org/node/2|\u2018produsage\u2019]]),
    the font is now equally a \u2018non-professional\u2019 tool. In the form of the
    webfont, the font is now an integral part of large amounts of online matter that
    is created much more for a 'social market' than for what we could call a 'traditional'
    commercial market. And significantly it's not your 'professionals' creating all
    that content, it is increasingly content being produced by users of these markets,
    or by 'produsers' in these social markets and satellite markets . These social
    or non-traditional markets use webfonts on a huge scale. Compared to just 2-3
    years ago, it's huge. So this is where font design and font licensing enters the
    scene; how does the traditional font & it's licensing operate within these social
    or non-traditional markets, where content is being created often by non-professionals,
    and is being created and consumed in large parts for free? It is also content
    that is largely transient, copy-able, share-able, and re-useable. The font is
    more and more not a professional tool at all, it is more a social object and a
    free roaming web object. Let's not even get into the question of whether the creators
    of  'fonts as professional tools' have a sense to what fonts these new social
    markets actually want and will use. If they don't know (or think they know better)
    then they should perhaps take note, because it is likely that the commercial markets
    will more and more mirror the visual trends and memes of these social markets.\r\n\r\n-v"

  body: "<em>So there is a clear distinction that we can make here that completely
    separates a 'professional tool' like a font, from those other sorts of objects
    that are not 'professional tools'.</em>\r\n\r\nThat would appear to be what I
    said, but I wasn\u2019t trying to make the point that fonts are exclusively for
    professionals (which goes against my own experience, as my customers cover the
    spectrum from amateurs to professionals, especially at MyFonts), only that the
    professional market for fonts makes fonts different from other digital products
    to which they are often compared.\r\n\r\nPamela P\uFB01ffner stated in her 2002
    history of Adobe, <em>Inside the Publishing Revolution</em>, that the number of
    practising graphic artists was increased 25 fold by the digital revolution. I
    suspect that those \uFB01gures were based on assuming that every user of Adobe
    Photoshop or Illustrator was a 100% professional graphic artist. But the marketplace
    isn\u2019t like that, there are  prosumers, part-timers (through desire or force
    of circumstance), and those who have a non-graphic job which requires a modicum
    of design work. Many of those working as graphic artists have no formal training
    as such, and those graduating from a 1-, 2-, or 3-year course may have limited
    typographic skills. I\u2019ve taught type design to 3rd-year students, and have
    observed that many have by that time forgotten a lot of what they learned in their
    \uFB01rst-year \u201Ctype 101\u201D course\u2014there being so many things a designer
    is required to know these days, animation and programming, for instance.\r\n\r\nSome
    of the best typographers I\u2019ve come across in the publishing business have
    a background in writing and editing\u2014they are very keen on making the text
    as readable and as accessible as possible, whereas some graphic designers are
    not really into words and conceive of text as grey bars in a layout.\r\n\r\nI
    don\u2019t see much fundamental difference between Google webfonts and MyFonts
    in terms of the professionalism of the markets they cater too, and foundries publishing
    through MyFonts have been offering free fonts for some time\u2014the success of
    Jos Buivenga\u2019s (Exljbris) Museo family was in large part driven by his \e\u201Cfree\u201D
    strategy and duly noted by other foundries. \r\n\r\nFonts are more like cameras
    than photographs, they are used to add value to a product, rather than as a consumable.
    But I wouldn\u2019t draw too close an analogy, as there is no indie-camera industry.\r\n\r\n<em>The
    font is more and more not a professional tool at all, it is more a social object
    and a free roaming web object.</em>\r\n\r\nThe introduction of @fontface hasn\u2019t
    made web typography any less professional. It just means that web designers, from
    amateur to pro, now have a greater variety of web fonts to choose from than MS
    \u201Ccore TrueType\u201D fonts (Verdana, Georgia et al).\r\n\r\nIf anything,
    @fontface has professionalized web design, by opening up a new market for font
    licensing, offering a level of sophistication not available through the limited
    selection of MS fonts.\r\n\r\nThe argument has been made that Google webfonts
    are giving the public the unsophisticated fonts they want\u2014but they will learn,
    just as the MyFonts market did as it matured; compare MyFonts best sellers now
    with 10 years ago, when the list was dominated by script faces, distressed faces,
    and mid-20th century classics. Those were by turn naive and safe choices. Now
    the list is full of extremely well crafted original designs from living designers
    who own their own foundries. \r\n\r\n<em> \u2026 non-traditional markets, where
    content is being created often by non-professionals, and is being created and
    consumed in large parts for free \u2026</em>\r\n\r\nGoogle webfonts are traditional,
    not only because their design is by and large non-innovative, but because free
    generic and conservative fonts have been with us from day one of digital \u2014
    bundled with the LaserWriter, bundled with Internet Explorer, bundled with Adobe
    applications, and bundled with the Mac and Windows OS\u2019s. The whole history
    of the digitization of graphics, its tradition from the late 1980s, has been one
    of democratizing what were once exclusive trades.\r\n\r\n<em> \u2026 it is likely
    that the commercial markets will more and more mirror the visual trends and memes
    of these social markets. </em>\r\n\r\nI would say it will be the other way round,
    with commercial fonts driving the scene.\r\nThat would seem to be the case with
    Vernon\u2019s Nunito, a latecomer to the rounded sans trend that began in 1997
    with the release of VAG Rounded by Adobe, and was picked up by independent foundries
    with faces like Bryant, Chevin, Gotham Rounded, etc. GE\u2019s corporate face
    was also a part of that early-noughts trend.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
