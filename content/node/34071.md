body: "Hello all,\r\n\r\nI am looking for a corporate typeface for a company about
  to enter the mobile phone service market and was wondering if anyone had any ideas.\r\n\r\nHere
  are some further details:\r\n\r\n<strong>Audience</strong>\r\nworking professionals,
  core being around 25-50\r\n\r\n<strong>Message</strong>\r\nAll aspects of the financial
  sector (traditional, secure, etc.) BUT ALSO sophisticated/clever, inventive, stylish\r\n\r\n<strong>Media</strong>\r\nMainly
  web-based (then only as display font), although there will be print advertising
  plus annual reports, etc. (then, of course, both as display and text font)\r\n\r\n<strong>Special
  requirements</strong>\r\nThe font should have an extensive special character set
  to work with most Latin character languages; if possible, the font should retain
  its characteristics/legibility in extremely small sizes (mobile phone screen), but
  also extremely large sizes (billboard advertising)\r\n\r\n<strong>First ideas</strong>\r\nI
  am generally looking more in the sans serif direction; the font should be clean
  and legible, while keeping some small quirky elements/attention to detail.\r\nI
  have already looked at <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=malm%C3%B6&site=d&btnG=Go\">Malm\xF6
  Sans</a> (love the Headline version), <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=reykjavik&x=0&y=0\">Reykjavik</a>
  (added bonus of male/female versions).\r\n\r\nIt would be brilliant if anyone has
  any ideas in that direction!\r\n\r\nMany thanks, Max"
