  it is?"

    (I have an autographed poster of it on my wall), and it was intended as a free
    download, as were most of his font designs.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    feeling is an echo from it--hence the reference is I hope helpful. '

    of unauthorized distribution of proprietaryfonts via newsgroups, and had nothing
    to do with his own font designs, which I still believe are original works. \r\n\r\n-

  body: "Yes I remember that story. Let's not open that up again.\r\n\r\nI am aware
    that Apostrophic has created fonts of his own design. However, I have obviously
    been colored by my past knowledge of him.\r\n\r\nIf Scriptina is his own design
    and he wants it to be free that is up to him. I was simply doing a little research.
    \r\n\r\nThanks!"
