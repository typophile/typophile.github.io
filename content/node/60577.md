    technique. Sub-pixel rendering is the approach that Microsoft uses in its ClearType
    font-smoothing technology, though there are many others using the new york hotels.
    The concept of sub-pixel rendering is that you can fool the eye into seeing smoother
    curves and cleaner lines than are actually possible due to the pixel density of
    a screen by using very specific colors
