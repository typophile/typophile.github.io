  managing designers. I have just began to be 'lead designer' in charge of critiquing
  other designers work in our studio. It has made me realize that although I have
  'an eye for typography' being able identify and verbalize what needs 'fixing' is
  a whole new ball game.\r\nI find myself holding back and not wanting to offend or
  seem like a nag by seeking perfection. I am at the point where I feel a simple list
  of 'rules' would be good to pin on the wall - to allow designers to do a little
  self assessment.\r\nMost of the 'fixing up' that needs doing usually revolves around
  layout, proximity, white space (lack of), and type sizing. \r\nAny suggestions?\r\n"

  body: "From my extensive experience criticizing people in public I would offer the
    following advice:\r\n\r\nThere is an Art-Design axis, and every individual falls
    somewhere on the axis, and probably never changes (at least not much, and certainly
    almost not at all after a certain age). The closer an individual is to the Art
    end of the axis, the more sensitive he will be to criticism, and the more likely
    to hold a grudge against you as a result of a single, even mild, case of criticism.
    I'm not saying you should play along too much with such a destructive attitude,
    but if you can figure out about where each individual on your team falls on the
    axis, it will help you manage the team.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: I am not a lead designer nor have I experience with public criticism, so take
    my words with a few grains of salt. I think that one needs to be able to be honest,
    even brutally honest. It's best to remember that the worst thing that can happen
    is that the designer will be offended. I don't think that's something to be worried
    about. Sometimes a little offending is just what is needed. No one should be afraid
    to say what isn't working, or fear praising what is working.

  body: "If you're the leader, you need to be able to critique people's work honestly.
    No one likes to be criticized, but there are ways to do it which will minimize
    hard feelings. \r\n\r\n\u2022 Maintain a positive attitude (remember that the
    leader usually sets the mood of the group). Show courtesy and respect to your
    staff (things like saying \"please\" and \"thank you\", for example).\r\n\r\n\u2022
    Let everyone know up front what your expectations are. \r\n\r\n\u2022 When critiquing
    work, frame your comments as ways to make things better instead of being personal
    attacks (for example, instead of saying \"this layout is terrible\" say \"this
    layout might be better if you...\"). \r\n\r\n\u2022 Remember that it can be embarassing
    to be criticized in front of others, so be tactful in group meetings, and if you're
    really unhappy with someone, discuss it with them in private."

    was ideal training for being an Art Director and/or Lead Designer. You can make
    your job easier by remembering a couple of important strategies.\r\n\r\nFirst,
    look for each of your charge's individual strengths and be sure to praise them
    at every available opportunity. Nobody excels at everything\u2014not even you\u2014which
    makes an occasional critique more like constructive criticism than blanket \"dissing\".\r\n\r\nSecond,
    as a middle manager, you run interference between your charges and top management.
    Practically speaking, you have to keep all parties happy. So, sometimes\u2014if
    you're dealing with a particularly sensitive soul\u2014you may have to make your
    boss the bad guy. Middle Management 101, but it works."

  body: Having an 'eye' is great. But if you can't articulate what is wrong with a
    design, that is an issue. While design is subjective, there are rules about composition,
    balance, etc. that you should know how to defend and explain. If you offer criticism
    make sure it's to the point and based on solid advice, not opinion. Also, be sure
    to offer positive feedback along with the negative. A good creative director always
    makes the project better because of their input.

    body: "Thanks for all your advice - I think this is my problem. I've been a designer
      for twenty years (it's the only job I have ever done) but I finished my formal
      'training' about a year before the institution I trained at got computers. Typography
      was a very small part of my training (as were computers).\r\nI guess most of
      what I know is self-taught, so it's kind of like you 'know' it in an insular
      kind of way, you know what needs adjusting - but explaining to some one why
      takes a bit more thought.\r\nDo most art directors critique on the fly? I feel
      like I would do better marking-up a hard copy (or PDF) than having to consider
      their work on-screen while they await my response."

  body: "> While design is subjective, there are rules \r\n\r\nThat's an excellent
    point. While there is always a subjective element to design, you're on more solid
    ground if you can explain your reasoning on the basis of design principles. \r\n\r\nAnd
    an unrelated thought \u2014 as the lead designer, you are responsible for the
    work that comes out of your department and should be willing to stand behind your
    staff's work. I remember a manager I had once who would tell staff designers that
    he liked and approved their work, but then if management questioned a design he
    would tell management \"you're right, I don't like it either\". The staff lost
    respect for him pretty quickly. "

    critiques and good art directors can give good critiques. Criticism, though, is
    a much more difficult thing to deal with. \r\n\r\nIn either case, always strive
    to be more objective than subjective. "

  body: "Your role as a lead designer is to help your colleagues envision creative
    and effective solutions while capitalizing on their strenghts. It is always important
    to help the designer understand the design problem, to start with very clear expectations
    and specifications and to suggest possible paths for solution.\r\n\r\nFirst encourage
    exploration with little regard for quality, then focus on the improvement of a
    selected path.\r\n\r\nCritique is very important but you must not direct it to
    the person but to the work in an objective way. Say things like \"The bullets
    distract attention from the titles\" instead fo things like \"YOUR bullets...\"
    or \"YOU placed very colorful bullets\".\r\n\r\nStart by talking about the virtues
    of what you are being shown and then talk about what goals is the design failing
    to meet or the problems you find. It is equally important to offer feedback on
    the opportunities of the design which may not be evident to the designer.\r\n\r\nTake
    some time to critique, you need to really think what you are going to say in order
    for it to be constructive and help the designer to get in the right path. Good
    cirtique is not so much about poiting out what is wrong but about helping to get
    it right.\r\n\r\nAlso, as pointed out, there are some things that are simply wrong:
    widows, missalignments, defective masking, bad color balance in photos, etc...
    You don't need to make a big deal abou them, just point them out briefly and focus
    on the overall conceptual quality and graphic achievement.\r\n\r\nCompliment a
    lot."
