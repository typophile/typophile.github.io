  body: I could swear we've had this before, or something very similar. Could you
    maybe post a bigger crop of the image (more context)?

    Script</a> with its various followers looks close, but not identical. Maybe you
    can work with that \u2026 \r\n\r\nEDIT: Late, with a similar solution \u2026"

  body: The e is the critical part in Athletic Script et al. in my opinion. (If they
    all have the same e, which I don't know)

  body: "It's true that the 'e' seems to have a different shape than Spoleto, but
    the 'th' seems identical, even to the way the 't' leans to the right. Perhaps
    one of the other forms of Athletic Script has the 'e' like this, but perhaps this
    is only important to us type fanatics. ;-)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
