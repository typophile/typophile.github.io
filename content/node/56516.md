  | Myfonts.Com]]. Bonning is a Roman face full of the spirit of the 1920s.\r\n\r\nIt
  was inspired by a (real)estate agent\u2019s For Sale board seen in an old sepia
  photograph from that era and combines visual flair and period with good clear legibility.
  \r\n\r\nA range of Opentype features including alternate forms, old style numbers
  and fractions, as well as discretionary and standard ligatures are included. Three
  weights are offered, including a shadowed black form are offered, all in a choice
  of three widths. It\u2019s the ideal face for signage with a period feel, as well
  as posters, headings and feature paragraphs.\r\n\r\nA full (and fully licensed)
  version of Bonning Wide Bold can be downloaded completely free of charge from [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/gatf/bonning/
  | Myfonts.Com]]\r\n.  The restof the family can be purchased there.\r\n\r\nIn the
  meantime Greater Albion's [[http://gatf.wordpress.com | blog]] has some examples
  of the Bonning family in use.\r\n\r\n4/4/09 = We're now running a 40% introductory
