  FontFont Description</strong>\r\nThe most striking characteristic of Evert Bloemsma's
  new typeface FF Avance\u2122 is the use of asymmetrical serifs in the Roman weights,
  something we're only used to seeing in an italic. Upper as well as lower case letters
  have serifs in the upper left and lower right corners, remnants as it were of the
  connection between hand-written letters. In Bloemsma's earlier family FF Cocon\u2122
  these relics of handwriting were left away entirely. With Avance he rediscovers*
  the expressive qualities of such details which emphasize the movement and direction
  of reading.\r\n\r\nBloemsma's interest in contemporary design made it difficult
  for him initially to consider drawing a face with serifs. He has this to say about
  them: \"The serif has many purposes and possible origins, and it took some time
  before I felt ready to handle this item. The serif may carry a burden of outdated
  conventions, so applying serifs is risky when trying to avoid the swamp of traditions.
  Some aspects related to the use of serifs:\r\n\r\nOrnament/Decoration\r\nSymmetry
  is found in all kinds of shapes. Often it seems to express balance, security, and
  certainty. This static monumentality does not really belong in our present world.\r\n\r\nCalligraphy\r\nA
  serif could be seen as a remainder of the movement of the hand in writing. But is
  writing - and especially broad-nib calligraphy - still a valid inspiration? Think
  about how much we really write in daily life. Much text is produced using the computer's
  keyboard. Soon, when speech recognition is actually feasible, the amount of hand-written
  text will be even less. The self-evidence with which many type designers use writing
  as their main inspiration is not that self-evident anymore. On the other hand it
  will be difficult to invent another convincing foundation. No other design discipline
  relies so heavily on habit and therefore on convention as type design. In the case
  of FF Avance\u2122 a solution can be found in the design itself.\r\n\r\nA finishing
  touch.\r\nWe sometimes seem to be afraid of an open end, just like that, plain.
  There is some psychological desire for a clearly delineated border between something
  and nothing. In the case of letterforms this would be the end of a curve or a stem.\r\n\r\nOn
  the other hand some interesting properties of serifs which could improve the typographic
  appearance:\r\n<ul><li>A more regular word image</li>\r\n<li>The eye guided along
  the line</li>\r\n<li>The overall image of text could be more pleasant because serifs
  can bring more differentiation of forms, a wider spectrum of forms.</li>\r\n<li>An
  expression of dynamic movement, a stream of thoughts. Reading is moving.</li></ul>\r\n\r\nSerious
  contemporary typography should strive for transparent expression and prevent itself
  from building facades that disguise. Revivals of ancient masterpieces have a limited
  value. Their superb qualities should find new means of expression, no matter how
  hard it will be to capture a similar refinement.\"\r\n\r\n<cite>* More respectful
  to Bloemsma's intentions and philosophy would be to use a term such as \"repurposes\".</cite>\r\n\r\n<strong>External
