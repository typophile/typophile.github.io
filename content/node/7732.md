body: I&#39;m looking for examples of good uppercase &#34;Y&#34;s that have one arm
  straight but the other arm swashy. Or that have both arms somewhat swashy. Italics
  expected, Roman accepted. Thanks for any help! <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: Thanks, but that&#39;s way too swashy. <BR> <BR>For reference, I&#39;d say
    that the &#34;Y&#34; in Palatino Italic&#42; is borderline, although if one arm
    were straight the other could be more swashy and it would be OK. If that helps.
