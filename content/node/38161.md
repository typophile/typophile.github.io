  having trouble locating this font. At first I thought it was something made just
  for her but on her fanclub this font was used alot, so since then i've been looking
  for it.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/example_5207.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: Affraid not, Faiyaz. This appears to be custom drawn for Shakira. Looking
    at the quality of the design, she probably even did it herself. ;^)
