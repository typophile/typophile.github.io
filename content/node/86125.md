body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI am looking for website to design but i am confused that should
  i go for Flash based or Html based website ? As some of my friends suggest me to
  go for HTML based website. As flash based website takes much time to load the webpage
  in the web browser ? "

    sites are the just pollution strewed alongside the information superhighway. Learn
    to code standards-compliant web sites with XHTML and CSS. '

  body: Contrary to what the name says, Flash does not load as quickly as traditional
    coding.  When you first open the Typophile site cold,you will see the html segments
    load quickly and then wait for the Flash segments to load and be cached.  Sometimes,
    this seems like forever,sometimes only a few seconds.

    is an aftermarket option.

    better. Build your website on this foundation.

  body: Personally, I class Flash with four-colour glossies, glitzy ads and multimedia
    pretensions. Mind, the Flash videos "Internet Killed The Video Star" and "All
    Your Base..." were and are favourites of mine.

  body: "I am one of the few here who is a fan of Flash. However, I consider Flash
    to be a tool that should only be used when you need to do something that cannot
    be done as well with HTML/CSS. Lately that range of things is growing smaller
    and smaller.\r\n\r\nBut in any case, you should never build an entire site in
    Flash. "

  body: "Flash is good for very highly animated/interactive applications. Videogames
    mostly, but it can also be good for \"closed\" web applications where content
    portability and accessibility is not an issue (eg. the Adobe Kuler application
    (http://kuler.adobe.com) that helps creating color scheme that you can export
    as photoshop color files).\r\n\r\nGenerally is best to avoid it unless you need
    to do something the native web technologies (html, css, javascript) really can't
    do. \r\n\r\nA non-flash website is usable on apple iOS devices that don't support
    flash at all. Other mobile OS (like Android) support Flash, but not in a very
    good way, they often have issue of performance and various bugs, so also when
    the mobile system support flash, it is often better to avoid it. Also, on macs,
    flash is supported but its performances are not stellar, it sucks lot of resources
    and is buggy as well."
