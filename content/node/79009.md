  having some trouble with choice of typeface.\r\n\r\nI was hoping someone here may
  know the typeface/s that were used by the Hogarth Press; Virginia and Leonard Woolf.
  My instincts would be Founder's Caslon or Baskerville, more likely Caslon though.?\r\n\r\nImage
  attached of a page from T. S. Eliots \"The Waste Land\", from here; http://cloud.lib.wfu.edu/blog/sca/2010/08/03/the-waste-land-by-ts-eliot-published-at-the-hogarth-press/\r\n\r\nI'm
  going to be heading down to St.Brides Library during the week to view their archives
  and see if they have any literature relating to the Hogarth Press. I think this
  looks like what I need: Handprinted Books of Leonard and Virginia Woolf at the Hogarth
  Press (Studies in Modern Literature, No 52) by Rhein.\r\n\r\nAnyway thanks in advance.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nFred."

    then from what I can see, my guess is it was set in ATF\u2019s Caslon Oldstyle
    No. 471, 12-point."

  body: "Thanks Kentlew \u2013 yes indeed \u2013 the Eliot sample is definitely not
    Baskerville! I should have posted up other examples from the Hogarth Press that
    look as though they used baskerville aswell as Caslon.\r\n\r\nATF's Caslon 471
    looks identical \u2013 and yes indeed it was hand-set. Thanks again for your insight
    \u2013 I'll see what the St.Brides holds in-store and update the post \u2013 hopefully
    during the week.\r\n\r\nFB\r\n"

  body: "Hi Kent \u2014 and anybody else who's interested, after heading down to St.
    Brides Library today, and going through a couple of books, I'm pretty sure that
    the Woolf's used Caslon in their earlier hand-printed editions produced at the
    Hogarth press. Some text from one of the books (The handprinted books of Leonard
    and Virginia Woolf at the Hogarth Press, 1917-1932 / by Donna E. Rhein. ISBN:
    0835716945);\r\n\r\n[Just off Fleet Street they happened upon] \"The Excelsior
    Printing Supply co., where they bought a small handpress, complete with instruction
    booklet and some *Old Face* type for \xA319. 5s. 5d.\"\r\n\r\nI assume *Old Face*
    type is meant in the broader sense of the word (classification) and having looked
    at the printed pieces (most of which are somewhat poor reproductions of the Title
    pages \u2013 not full text blocks) it seems to tally that it was Caslon or something
    very similar, I was focusing on the swash characters used (A, P and R), the inward
    curling second leg of the italic lowercase h and the numerals to identify the
    type.\r\n\r\nThanks again Kent! Apologies for the poor image quality!\r\n\r\nFB\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hogarth_002_4807.jpg]"

    fonts. Their \u201COld Face\u201D would more likely have come from Stephenson,
    Blake & Co., successor to the original Caslon foundry. That\u2019s my guess."

  body: "Indeed, and here I present a proof I pulled yesterday of the S&B Founders
    Old Face Caslon; Identical! \u2013 more or less. Lowercase b and d are in the
    wrong order and the lowercase q is missing \u2013 it was the end of the day when
    I decided to compose this, so a bit tired and not concentrating 100% \u2013 it
    was more to just get an idea of how the type looked printed. Enjoy!\r\n\r\nFB\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Caslon_S&BFounders_v2_5739.jpg]\r\nFor
