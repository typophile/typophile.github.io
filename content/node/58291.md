  Currently, the font combination used is Times New Roman italic for participant titles
  and institutions (smaller type), while the name is in a larger Verdana bold. (Name
  legibility is the most important feature. Does anyone have any other classic font
  combinations that would be compatible with standard PC fonts? (It has to be standard
  PC fonts because the computers used are basic rentals every year, in a different
  city, and the template has to be accessible by all conference employees. It's very
  limiting, but any suggestions would be helpful!\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "\"PC\" -- you are talking about <em>Windows</em> fonts.\r\n\r\nPersonally,
    I wouldn't combine a serif italic font with a sans bold font. You could try a
    small Regular and larger Bold combo. Try Georgia, for example.\r\nFor a sans,
    if you can be relatively sure Vista is on the machines, Calibri would look nice
    I guess."

  body: Perhaps if you post an image of your current badge design, and provide current
    font sizes, you'll get some suggestions for appropriate replacements and perhaps
    refinements. It is difficult to recommend typefaces without having a sense of
    the typical layout, amount of information, etc.

  body: "Here are a couple versions of what I'm talking about:\r\n\r\n--the original
    badge is the all-centered version with Times New Roman italics and the bold, larger
    name in Verdana.\r\n\r\n--the left-justified version has been converted to a standard
    windows vista (i think) sans serif (in this case, Franklin Gothic--which does
    not match the interstate font used in logo, but just looks nicer than, say, arial).
    the logo has been reduced a bit, as it's not necessary to have such a large logo
    on the badge. i think the left-justified version in all sans is easier to read.\r\n\r\nby
    the way, the original file generator is a microsoft word badge insert template
    (3\" x 4\" badges). all the info is pulled from a general master list created
    in excel, through word's data merge manager. this is the only efficient way to
    prepare the badges as participant lists are not finalized until perhaps the day
    before, and new badges have to be created on the spot by anyone on staff (thus,
    microsoft word, windows platform...) \r\n\r\nthe smaller type is 16 pt; the bold
    names are 22 pt.\r\n\r\nwhat do you think? i'm now looking for a standard windows
    sans serif font that will match the logo font, which is interstate light. ideas?
    thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Name-badge-sample-2009-pg-1_3421.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Name-badge-sample-2009-left-just-pg-1_6642.gif]"

  body: "I don't think you'll find a super close match for Interstate Light among
    the MS fonts, but I would generally avoid using exactly the same typeface as in
    the logo text. Logo text should be distinct from information text.\r\n\r\nIf you
    are using Windows Vista or have Office 2007 installed, consider Corbel for the
    smaller information text. It is a relatively light sans, so will look okay with
    the Interstate Light and also provide good contrast with the bolder name text.\r\n\r\nFor
    the names, give Candara Bold a try. It might be too informal for your purpose.
    On the other hand, it is more personable than most sans, so may be appropriate
    for names."
