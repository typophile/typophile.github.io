body: "My autohinting endeavour did not produce that great results. What I did was:\r\n-
  FL autohinted everything\r\n- Defined the bluescale according to the largest verical
  alignment zone (47). So Bluescale is 0.021276, Blueshift 10 (max. overshoot value
  for round shapes), Bluefuzz = 2 just in case.\r\n-Did the auto zones with green
  diamond: -30,0   504, 519   697, 744   -220, -193. I checked that they are quite
  accurate.\r\n-Auto stems. V: 78, 100. H: 72, 54, 100. These are true. \r\n-Then
  I removed all previous hints and ran the Adobe FDK Autohinter.\r\n\r\nNow, in very
  small sizes, everything is aligning quite nicely. Problems occur in a bit larger
  sizes, all overshoots seem to align one pixel off from the baseline and x-height.
  See the screenshot attached. Same thing happens with FL autohinter and also when
  I remove all hints leaving the stem and zone settings. Any idea what I'm doing wrong?
  I'm guessing something is wrong with the blue-settings, because frankly I'm not
  sure how to set them up correcly.\r\n\r\nThe screenshot is from Indesign CS4, Mac
  OSX 10.6."

  body: You have points at extrema? When I see this kind of jumpiness, my usual suspicion
    is that the hints are not catching the outlines because points are in the wrong
    place.

  body: Yes, points are in right places. I was going to add another screenshot to
    prove it to you, but I can't see the Attachment -feature here anymore.

  body: I haven't been able to find a citation, but I've always heard that 25 units
    is the maximum value for an alignment zone.

  body: Well I guess that 25 unit limit must be true. After limiting zones to 25 and
    updating the Bluescale accordingly, everything is aligning as it should. Breaking
    up those zones into smaller ones is a good idea too. Thanks for the help everybody!
