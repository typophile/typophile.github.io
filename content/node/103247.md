  Here]]\r\n\r\nI'm after an ID for this typeface please.  Specifically the word ORION,
  I suspect the smaller words are set in Neutraface.\r\n\r\nI did suspect Stratum2
  for the ORION, but it looks a little off, in particular the R.\r\n\r\nAny help appreciated.\r\n\r\nCheers!"

    ROOM" is possibly [[http://www.houseind.com/fonts/neutraface2/viewfonts|Neutraface
    2 Bold]] using the alternate /M with sloping verticals.

  body: "Hey Ryuk,, cheers for the post but I'm not sure if that's it.  \r\n\r\nThe
    leg of the R protrudes out further in the photo than in the Onramp sample?\r\nPlus
    Onramp seems to have more rounded corners.\r\n"

  body: Of course, I can't be 100% positive but still convinced it's ONRAMP. Have
    a look [[http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/4f0e30226bb3f72b0b000026-900/a-lot-of-meetings-everywhere.jpg|here]]
    and [[http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/4f0e302969beddb364000044-900/and-everyone-was-busy-at-work-so-we-are-heading-out.jpg|here]]
    and you'll see others letters such as /A, /W and /M that, to me, can't lie.

  body: "My apologies Ryuk, having tried ON RAMP installed on my machine, it looks
    exactly the same, perfect match.\r\n\r\nIt's odd - the characters in the sample
    image on lost-type, don't seem to exactly match those in the font itself.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again!"
