  body: "Thanks ill sans,\r\n\r\njust tried brody again, it def does not fit, the
    top stroke of the T is quit short even before stretching Brody, the loop on the
    \"L\" is not close to Brody either.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I've seen a knock-off version of Brody called Louisville, but I can't seem
    to find it on the internet (don't mistake it with De Louisville). Maybe that one
    would fit?
