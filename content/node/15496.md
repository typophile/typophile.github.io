  open type format. I think of the yummy alternates in Avant Guard, Lubalin Graph
  and others.

  body: "What a poor attempt at an italic. It looks like something offered at a free
    type site. I hope they put more effort into the next releases if they intend to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: 'Yeah, I''m pretty peeved about this. I feel like calling Tony Di Spigna and
    digitize real versions of these (Avant Garde, Lubalin Graph) with his input. In
    fact, I''m going to e-mail him and see what he has to say about this release.
    You shouldn''t futz with the classics unless you intend to pay them the respect
    they deserve. '

    sites link to it... That would set a superb precedent for not doing this type
    of thing again.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I downloaded the PDF of Avant Guard and I'm concerned about some of the capital
    ligatures. I was never in love with the negative kerning back then and I'm afraid
    it will resurface. Alternates are one thing, but\u2026"
