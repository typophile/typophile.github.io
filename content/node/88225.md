    InDesign will view the subhead as part of the paragraph below it, and the leading
    you apply to the text might end up accidentally getting applied to the head also.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/breaks_6092.jpg]\r\n\r\nAlso,
    if you're adjusting the text's leading via a style sheet, make sure the subhead
    doesn't accidentally have the same style sheet applied to it as the text, or that
    the subhead's style isn't based on the text's style. One way to check that is
    to open the style sheet for the text and change the text's color. If the color
    of the subhead changes too, then you know it's a style sheet problem.\r\n"

    errors such as extra spaces, soft breaks where hard breaks were intended, and
    so forth.  And when I import Word files given to me by clients, I often find that
    they've used a lot of weird formatting techniques (forcing a line break by inserting

    these things easy to spot."

    indeed you have a very good point regarding metrics. I know that it will be very
    hard to make a perfect copy of how it appears in Word which is why I have been
    trying to create a new style set so that I can copy-paste plain text and format
    using styles. My problem is that some of the documents are 200+ pages. In terms
    of resetting though, take a look at this image: \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Example3_5463.png]\r\n\r\nThis
    is the effect I am trying to achieve, but using ID's \"better controls\" it should
    be possible to create this layout without having to use two styles for each paragraph.
    In the example above the first line is \"no leading\" as described in previous
    post, and 2nd, 3rd and 4th lines are \"with leading\". Notice at the end of the
    1st line there is a \xB6?\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts? As said, I am still a

    Styles. Never ever apply local changes. Always encode them as either paragraph
    or character styles. (The only potential exception is when you need to change
    the gap between a drop-down character and the next character on the line. No point
    styling that, since it depends on the actual character combination.)

    simple design change would eliminate your formatting problems. Have you considered
    just putting more space below the item heading? Just give it the same leading
    as the paragraph below it.\r\n\r\nThis would make the formatting much simpler.
    You wouldn't have to mess with baseline shifts or other workarounds, and frankly
    I think it would look better, too.\r\n\r\n(If you're worried that this spacing
    change would make the item and subject heads too much alike, perhaps one could
    be made italic.)\r\n\r\n It would look something like this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/example_4865.jpg]\r\n"

  body: "Ok, I'm checking how Word works. Normally you control spacing between lines
    in Word by the format paragraph menu, not the format character menu. When you
    tell it to do 1 1/2 line spacing, it applies that to lines *below* the formatted
    lines, not above, so the behavior is opposite of InDesign, which I think is what
    has been confusing you. \r\n\r\nWord automatically sets I think 20% leading as
    \"single\" spacing, so you have to work from that to translate between InDesign
    and Word. And 1 1/2 lines of 12 pt is not 18 pt but 21.6 pt (I think). You have
    to use the \"exactly\" line measurement in points if you want to set the distance
    between baselines to an exact point measurement.  In any case, it will not affect
    the line above the paragraph, but below. Let me put this another way: if you want
    to control layout precisely, Word is a nightmare. \r\n\r\nSo just design in InDesign
    and be happy. Or less unhappy, depending on your temperament.\r\n\r\nYou answered
    Kent that the problem was not the heading. But you are thinking in Word, not InDesign,
    where the vertical gap affects lines above, not below, as in Word. So his work-around
    for full paragraphs, which is necessary to put in a paragraph style sheet, has
    to involve the heading in InDesign. So his work clever work around\u2014thanks
    Kent\u2014will work as promised. Try it, you'll like it :) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

    My suggestion (as I mentioned earlier) is to modify the design slightly by adding

    style on a Paragraph style.* Just make sure that the only value defined in your
    first-line character style is the leading field (presumably the only value you
    want to override for the first line). All other fields should be left blank in
    order to have any future edits to the paragraph style maintain precedence.\r\n\r\n*This
