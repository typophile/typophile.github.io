    of the latin (general ductus metaphor). They have however the same unicode indices

    they will have to be redesigned, or a separate greek font will have to be developed."

  body: "To be more informative:\r\n\r\nThe Greek letter mu does not have an agreed-upon
    way to represent it as a letter with the characteristics of a letter from the
    Roman lower-case alphabet - that is, with serifs.\r\n\r\nWhile there is a conventional
    Greek upper-case which is built from the same basic shapes as Roman capital letters,
    the traditional Greek lower-case is cursive.\r\n\r\nThis has led to what is known
    as \"Porson Greek\". This is the type of Greek typeface with which people outside
    of Greece are most familiar. It looks like using a normal Roman face for capital
    letters, and an italic face for small letters.\r\n\r\nThis is appropriate when
    one is using Greek letters in mathematical formulae. It has been used for text,
    simply because, outside of Greece, printers have had little else available. But
    most Greeks think it looks just as stupid as most non-Greeks would, encountering
    a page printed that way for the first time.\r\n\r\nEven Greeks had to use Porson
    Greek for a while, though, because Greece spent many years under the control of
    the Ottoman Empire, which suppressed the use of Greek in printing. At present,
    there are many Greek typefaces, which generally belong to the following three
    groups:\r\n\r\n1) Take Porson Greek, but italicize the capitals.\r\n2) Take Porson
    Greek, but optically remove the slope from the small letters.\r\n3) Go sans-serif,
    possibly including aspects of ancient Greek letterforms.\r\n\r\nGreek typography
    is still, in my opinion, in a parlous state, therefore. The upper-case and lower-case
    letterforms have been bolted together from unrelated originals, and they haven't
    really yet been harmonized into a generally agreed-upon way to represent the Greek
    alphabet in printing with a matching upper- and lower- case. Unless one goes sans-serif,
    and avoids much of the issue.\r\n\r\nBut for your purposes, having a look at [[http://www.greekfontsociety.gr/pages/en_typefaces1.html|existing
    Greek typefaces]] should suffice."

    but if the excessive simetry could be perceived in one single glyph, it also may
    be identified in others under similar condition. Thus your opinion (and also those
    from other Greek-speaking experts) would be valuable anyway.\r\n\r\nIf the font
    just includes Greek characters as Math symbols or to support less knwon alphabets*,
    delta, mu and others will dialog mostly with Latin-script. So the dance would
    be with strangers, with a risky mixture between tango and syrt\xF3s. ;-)\r\n\r\nMost
    of deltas I verified (about 60) are very simetrical and the bottom half is usually
    based on o. So I <em>guess</em> the majority of these fonts did not follow traditional
    Greek style in lowercases. Happily, here in Typophile we can verify these issues
    to improve Greek characters.\r\n\r\nAs long as I could conclude, my delta would
    benefit from a completely different top segment and a right curve with less mirror
    effect with the left one.\r\n\r\n<strong>Nick:</strong>\r\n\r\nIf I understood
    correctly, there is a vivid discussion about the style to be adopted in Greek
    lowercase, with designers favouring cursive, traditional, less regular shapes,
    while others reputes this as a surpassed approach. And even about the cursive
    ductus there is a reasonable variation about what would be genuine and proper.\r\n\r\nAs
    a sample, compare what Chris told about simetry and the very simetrical delta
    from Centro Serif (it's the first glyph of the second line).\r\n\r\nParachute
    surely knows what they are doing. But I'm not Greek nor can speak Greek language
    \u2013and hence I don't have the measure about how much I can let behind in terms
    of traditional style. In doubt, it seems safer to use shapes more usually recognized
    as typically Greek while your knowledge does not permit higher flights. My suggestion

  body: "Igor,\r\nFixing the flag at the top would solve most of your problem and
    move the reading away from Serbian.  What I meant about dancing was more about
    the feeling of rhythmic movement than rigid bilateral symmetry. Sans serif can
    certainly feel much more geometric. The \"countryman\" perhaps was a bit misleading.
    It is not just about Greek glyphs, it is about all the glyphs and how you intend
    it to be used.  If you are only making the Greek that is also math symbols, then
    your purpose is far different than a complete script meant for reading Greek text.
    Personally, I wish that the math glyphs were not coded to language text slots
    so that you could adjust each for their separate uses.  Spacing and kerning Greek
    text is a different beast than just using a few occasional Greek glyphs with Latin
    and figures. Even x-height, slant and weight could be directed to math formulae
    instead of text.  The way a delta or sigma holds a line in a math expression,
    where there are mixtures of operators, figures, and cap or lowercase Latin glyphs,
    would perhaps be a reason not to saddle the math Greek to the text Greek. This
    is not just about Greek, it is also about the whole nature of the typeface. My
    personal opinion, which should certainly not be taken as THE Greek way by any
    means (Greeks rarely agree about much) so think more about your intended purpose
    with the face than with how \"native\" it looks. My opinion is that Greek text
    should dance more than say Times Roman Latin.  Many Latin faces have glyphs which
    appear as a single gestalt on the page and group together as words with a single
    gestalt. I feel Greek text swings together as a flowing, undulating tango rather
    than marching lockstep in very even time.  Think of it more as 6/8 time rather
    than 4/4 time. Like a tango, where both dancers must work quite together to avoid
    stepping on each-others feet, not like a march where one soldiers misstep will
    only betray his failure to match the rest.\r\nNick's mention of Futura is a perfect
    example of not throwing the baby out with the bath water. When someone chooses
    Futura for setting text, they are not choosing it to give the look of any traditional
    text.  Futura was not meant to evoke Katzanzakis text let alone Homer. The typographer
    has obviously a different purpose and that purpose needs to be respected.  My
    comment was just about that one glyph you first had shown and it did not look
    like it was in the modern vein of Futura or AG, or Univers. If someone were to
    do a Greek translation of a book on Paul Renner or Tschchold's \"New Typography\",
    or even some high tech subject matter, you might consider Futura to be a good
    fit. \r\nThat being said, that is not to say that fine Latin faces such as Greta
    or the more than lovely Maiola are not dancing perfectly in their Greek text.
    \ They were not designed by Greeks but they certainly can Tsamiko or Kritiko if
    asked.\r\nThe reason I hesitate from picking a delta from your image is that I
    don't want you to think there is only one way to dance.  Fred Astaire and Ginger
    Rogers vs Nureyev and Dame Margo Fontaine have their own way of dancing but each
    is correct in its own right.\r\nWhat I am saying is, put on the music that you
    ask them to dance to and then pick the best partners--don't just ask to see one
    of their feet."

    the dancing metaphor is a very nice one and I think the whole idea is clear now.
    Many thanks for your detailed and highly instructive message.\r\n\r\n<cite>I wish
    that the math glyphs were not coded to language text slots so that you could adjust
    each for their separate uses.</cite>\r\n\r\nMany Latin-script fonts add pi, mu
    and omega twice, both as Greek letters and as math symbols, probably due to backward
    compatibility. It seems it will took some time until authors, editors and typographers
    fully adopt the correct Unicode characters.\r\n\r\nIn my case, initial idea was
    to use just the mathematical symbols. But later I discovered some languages using
    Greek characters mixed in Latin alphabets, as Wakhi and a few native North American.
    Some even mix Latin, Cyrillic and Greek glyphs (!), demanding additional glyphs
    to a complete language support.\r\n\r\nWhen these glyphs are used in a Latin context
    and in small number, I believe a Latinish design does not cause great troubles.
    But this may be tricky in a font with Greek support. A Greek lowercase with the
    dancing dinamism you described would not fit well mixed <em>inside</em> a word
    with the more static Latin approach. Of course, linguists who built these mixed
    alphabets hadn't typographical knowledge.\r\n\r\n<cite>I feel Greek text swings
    together as a flowing...</cite>\r\n\r\nI love Greek letters, but I find they very
    difficult to draw. My hand is still a bit rigid to achieve their swings. Hope
    in the future I learn some Zorba-tango. :-)\r\n\r\n<cite>The reason I hesitate
