  is Mike, I am a graphic design student. I am from the new england area and enjoy
  playing the banjo, long walks on the beach and murde...i mean, scrabble. :)\r\n\r\nI've
  always been more creatively inclined but after a misguided youth I found myself
  at 30 years old going back to school to begin to acquire some skills needed to enter
  the graphic design/advertising business.\r\n\r\nAnyway... \r\n\r\nI'm trying to
  help a friend out and make him a logo for his construction company. \r\nI've decided
  (along with his input) that the best option would be to forgo using clipart tools
  to make letters form his name ;) and stick with just his name with maybe a small
  graphic.\r\n\r\nIm having trouble finding a perfect typeface. I'm looking for something
  strong and clean. Something to suggest durability and precision. Something bold
  and unique. I thought that using something other than the stock fonts on my computer
  I would look into maybe licensing something or at least getting something that isnt
  as common as some of the more popular options.\r\n\r\nHoping for suggestions...\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance,\r\nMike"

    they need to relate). And think about something the type should communicate other
    than meaningless market phrases (except for durability and precision).\r\n\r\nLogos
    that rely on letterforms alone are usually modified or custom drawn letters: for
    uniqueness, better handling of white space, collisions ... the list goes on. Just
    picking a font is rarely enough to create something \"durable\" and \"unique\"."

  body: "Thank you!\r\n\r\nI thought that some custom drawn would be best. My drawing
    style is probably the furthest thing from clean and precise though. I suppose
    I could start with graph paper, a ruler, circle templates and some french curves.
    Then scan my drawing and convert the letters to vector shapes.\r\n\r\nI am somwhat
    against using a symbol at all although my friend (client) seems to think it is
    important. I'm going to be including \"construction\" or \"home improvment\" in
    the logo so an outline of a roof, or a hammer or saw blade is not necessary imo.
    I told him that clever logos & graphics are cool if they work but you dont want
    people remembering \"that cool logo with the circular saw blade for the \"O\",
    you want them remembering the name of your company. \r\n\r\nI've got a few vector
    drawings of symbols i might use but I feel like im forcing them into the design.
    I was hoping that the right font would either be sufficient or suggest the proper
    companion graphic. \r\n\r\nI really like that Gotham-Bold. In most fonts i tried,
    I had problems with the G which it the first letter of his name \"Gannon\" so
    I wanted it to be strong. Most of them were too \"narrow and curvy\" (pardon my
    lack of correct terminology, im working on it)\r\nThanks\r\nmike\r\n "

  body: "Mike, have you ever visited myfonts.com ? You can use their search box to
    search fonts by descriptive keywords (\"strong\" or \"construction\" or whatever),
    and when viewing a font you can use the \"sample text\" box to see how a word
    or phrase looks in that font. And if you find something you like you can buy and
    download it there. You might find it useful.\r\n\r\n> I am somwhat against using
    a symbol at all \r\n\r\nMike, speaking as a designer myself, you're way too early
    in the project to draw that conclusion. You need to go through the design process
    of gathering info on the client, analyzing their marketing goals,  researching
    what similar companies (especially the competition) use for logos, and coming
    up with a whole bunch of creative concepts, both for symbol logos and also for
    type logos. Then narrow it down to a few concepts you like best, fine-tune them,
    and show them to your client for his feedback.\r\n\r\nMaybe the final solution
    will be all type. Maybe it won't. You're not going to know until later in the
    process after you've seriously explored a wide range of ideas.\r\n\r\nCome up
    with some concepts and post them here for feedback. They don't need to be perfect
    drawings; just good enough to communicate your ideas."

    any preconceived notions about how it should be aside. I have a habit of thinking
    of a logo idea first and then trying to fit it in but resizing, adjusting, changing
    color. I think its good advice to start with a blank sheet of paper and a pencil
    and just brainstorm, writing or sketching anything at all that comes to mind.
    Then narrowing it down from there. \r\n \r\nive come up with a few ideas. i might
    post them in the crit forum.\r\n\r\nthanks again.\r\n\r\n"

    later, after working through the design process, I often find that the best solution
    is something different."
