  body: I'm wondering about where your magical number 65535 comes from. Current version
    of Unicode supports more characters than this, and the Basic Multilingual Plane
    actually contains less than 65535.

  body: "@Tom - I've wondered about that. What is the history or technology behind
    that limitation? Doesn't unicode extend to 8-byte codes, which, at least numerically,
    would allow for something over four billion codes?\r\n\r\n - Herb"

  body: Nope, that's four-byte (32-bit) codes. Ya gotta square yer four billions to
    get the bignum for eight-byte (64-bit) codes.

  body: "Glyphs are restricted to a double-byte space. Storage of glyphs in a font
    is by glyph ID, which is independent of encoding. Unicode or other encodings are
    handled by the cmap table, which maps from Unicode (or other encodings) to glyph
    ID.\r\n\r\nUnicode has just under a million possible codepoints. Of those about
    110,000 are assigned as of Unicode 6.1. A large chunk are reserved for private
    use, so will never be assigned."
