  Duplex Roman]] typeface exist? These typefaces can be seen on printed circuit boards
  and I'm wondering if this font is available as a TrueType font of some sort. These
  fonts are freely available online but they're old and only available as outlines.
  I've tried converting them to different formats but because they're just strokes,
  they don't convert correctly. I'm looking for a usable version of this font for
  a website design or something very similar to it.\r\n\r\nThe Hershey font family
  can be seen [[http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/idl_html_help/Hershey_Vector_Font_Samples.html|here]].\r\n\r\nEDIT:
  I managed to find a typeface called RomanS.ttf and RomanD.ttf on font101"
