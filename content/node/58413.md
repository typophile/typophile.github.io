  body: "I looked at this one when you first posted it and thought of [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/compacta-lt/black/|Compacta
    Black]] that had been slanted, but the R  and G are wrong. I figured someone else
    would come up with a better mmatch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"

  body: "Maybe if you manipulated [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/placard-mt/condensed-bold/|Placard]]
    (squoosh flatter and slant), you could get a bit closer (at least the G is right,
    but the R is still wrong).\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "This particular logo type face was a custom crafted font originally used
    for Marlboro Team Penske. It was crafted back in 1991 by Charlie Hughes and commissioned
    to Leo Burnett/Philip Morris.\r\n\r\nIt does not exist as a standard font. If
    you are looking to use it for Penske promotional purposes you can contact Penske
    Racing headquarters in North Carolina and request a media kit.\r\n\r\nSteve"
