    bar of the E making it bigger (and same for the negative space of the T) '

  body: If you are keen to have an arrow, how about squishing S vertically a bit and
    putting a downward arrow on top of it ? Making it look like S is being pressed
    down as if it's a reset button being pressed.

    I think it's an interesting way of rendering E's and S's, but it surely must've

    a bit of trouble turning out new ideas. This may also be due to a family emergency
    i  have been dealing with this week.\r\n\r\nhere is a question.. when u guys are
    stuck on a concept.. what brain storming techniques do u use to get things going...
    I know of taking breaks, getting fresh air etc.. but when your ready to attack
    your problem what are some things u do?\r\n\r\n"

    nuts - scribble with crayon, use Papyrus and Comic Sans, whatever. Then, either
    a) you'll accidentally stumble upon something that works or b) you can fix the
    mistakes in your fake logo and in the process maybe come up with something that
    works. Or you could just end up with a really bad crayon rendering of Papyrus
    :-)\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    I get creative block, I try to surround myself with inspiring design. I find that
    a lot of times, creative block comes from getting stuck in a pattern of thought,
    and to break the pattern I need to find something new and inspiring. Caffeine
    and good music help too.\r\n\r\n"

    cant put my finger on it but I also have an issue with the Reflected R as a T
    its just not doing it.\r\n\r\nThe R becoming a T seems to close the logo in on
    itself.\r\n\r\nI do like your original effort - just need to look at the way the
    cross bar meets the main body of the E.\r\n\r\nNice though generally \r\n\r\nWill
    be interested to see the final logo. Keep going "

    C''s face the same direction, but then the last C gets flipped in animation. Not
    sure how the last flipped C relates to the name of the car or gives it additional
    meaning, but I think in "RESET" It''s great idea. '

    and wish they'd use it on the cars (to date, the on-the-car version is still a
    very bold, pointy thing). I love that sorta-anagram Zlatko put up. Both remind
    me of one of my all time favorite logos: <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/Nine_Inch_Nails_logo.svg\">Nine
    Inch Nails' famous NIN</a>.\r\n\r\nThe middle of E, S, and E aren't align with
    each other in the current RESET version. And what about taking off the wings of
    that arrow (the fins?) and simply leaving it as a clean spear point? Would match
    the straight edges of the rest of the type in my eyes."
