  body: "Trade is media for professionals, such as business-to-business marketing
    and magazines such as <em>Print</em> or <em>Eye</em>.\r\nCommercial is general
    media.\r\n\r\nThe distinction is between fonts that are being viewed and considered
    as cultural artefacts and potential tools (trade), and fonts that are read by
    consumers with no typographical awareness.\r\n\r\n"
