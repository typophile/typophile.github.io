  is suggesting that Obama's VP will be Bayh based on a bumper sticker. But the sticker
  does not to me seem to be using Gotham and Requiem--and Obama's known for his incredibly
  consistent brand (just look at his personal jet, styled in Gotham). I can't quite
  ID them--it doesn't seem like Requiem or Perpetua for the serif, though it may be
  Trajan, and the sans didn't appear to be Gotham, Gill Sans, or Antique Olive.\r\n\r\nAnyone
  have any ideas/think this bumper sticker is bogus?"

  body: Thanks, and yes, of course you're correct, Eileen. I was hoping to do a typographic
    scoop on the VP race in the vein of Thomas Phinney's work showing the Bush memos
    to be fake. Aw, shucks.
