<div class=commentbody>I was so hoping that he'd have won at least one of the two MTV MusicAwards he was nominated for. The video was one of the most touching I've seen in a very long time, the song is a killer and it would simply have been nice to see someone like Cash win something... anything... on a channel like MTV. Instead we get Justin Timberlake. Yeah... right. I hope now that Cash is dead, someone at MTV is kicking him- or herself in the bee-hind ;-). </div>

<div class=commentbody>:-) <br>I really wuld have liked that though, it would have been so against the grain of what MTV usually stands for. I was utterly surprised to even see Cash nominated and thought it would have been neat if the old man snatched away the moon man from singers that grew out of drawing-board-designed boy bands. I'm not that big a fan of Cash, but it would have been a great moment anyway. </div>

<div class=commentbody>In Justin Terblake's defense: <br> <br>It was nice to see that he said "He didn't deserve the award, and that he was just 'accepting it' for Cash." <br> <br>That in my mind was very cool.</div>

<div class=commentbody><i>I've seen no sign of (typophile) acknowledgement of <br>the passing of this great man.</i> <br>Well, we can't be <i>too</i> inclusive, can we? This still <br><i>is</i> a type related board. I don't think this thread <br>really belongs here. And BTW recently Joe Strummer <br>died too, and what about Katharine Hepburn, and so <br>on and so on... Where does it stop? <br> <br><i>He received a few Grammys. Forget MTV, after all MTV <br>is to music like KFC is to chicken.</i> <br>Grammys don't mean $h!t neither, pardon my French. <br> <br>Don't get me wrong: as a musician in a rock band, <br>I held the man in great esteem and am saddened by <br>his passing, BUT it wouldn't have bothered me if <br>this hadn't been mentionned on Typophile.</div>

<div class=commentbody>"General Discussions <br>Anything goes." <br> <br>If what your saying is true -- maybe this should not be the title of the area in the forum. Maybe it should be <br> <br>"General Discussions <br>Anything TYPE related goes." <br> <br>To me, and maybe I'm crazy for thinking this, anything goes, means anything goes. To me this means anything from the perspective of a member of the type community. <br> <br>no? <br> <br>hildebrant.</div>

<div class=commentbody>> There was a nice piece on NPR yesterday about June Carter Cash. <br> <br>Yeah I cought that, it was a re-play from the show they did right after she died. She was quite a spectacular women too. It was inspiring to see how much in love they were after soo many years. Something Johhny never failed to do was praise his wife and keep there relationship as fresh as the day they met. <br> <br>Hildebrant. <br></div>
