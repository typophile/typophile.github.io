    the stuff :-(

    Gothic.</cite>\r\n\r\nAre these both based on the same source material? I know
    Sackers Gothic has different weights but apart from that I haven't spotted the
    difference yet. I don't own either yet. \r\n\r\n<cite>Talking about root beer.

    is a fantastic Australian brand called Bundaberg, with very handsome labels, available
    in the UK. It seems that in Australia they call it by the old-fashioned name sarsaparilla,
    although it is labelled root beer here. However it looks as if the UK is the only
    European country they export too. Where are you?\r\n\r\n[[http://www.bundaberg-brew.com.au]]\r\n\r\nYou
    can buy it here!!!!\r\n[[http://www.sanza.co.uk/apps/shop/products/Bundaberg_Root_Beer___(375ml_bottle).asp?pId=7888]]"
