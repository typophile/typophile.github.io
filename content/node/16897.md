  body: I really don't think this is a "font" - this is most probably custom lettering.

  body: That might well be - the design is about a century old. For this project I
    don't need an exact match, just the language of form. Do you know of something
    similar?

    Juliana, is prof. L.O. Wenckebach; originally a sculptor, if I am right. Couldn''t
    find anything specific about the fonts used.'

  body: Thanks/Bedankt... I've found some similarities in Bitsream's <em>Arrus</em>,
    and in <em>Erasmus</em> (a red rooster font). About Perpetua; I see what you mean,
    it's architecture is roughly the same. Maybe I have to customize it - since of
    all three I have only Perpetua.

    body: I came across Trump Mediaeval today. Perhaps this font can be an alternative
      for the Dutch Dime typography.

    may be something to look at even though it's not at all an exact match.
