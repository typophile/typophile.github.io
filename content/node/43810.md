  body: "I can't find the book at the moment, so I can't tell for sure, but as far
    as I remember there were no examples. But concerning the historical facts which
    went into it (of course there is some fiction as well as not everything could
    be said with absolute certainty): here the author talked about a lot e.g. with
    Max Caflisch, a renowned writer of typographic history essays. Caflisch writes
    about Augereau and de Colines in his book \"Schriftanalysen 1\" and here there
    should be examples, too.\r\n\r\nAdditional small pieces of information can be
    found in Harry Carter's book \"A view of early typography\"."

    like I could send you a copy of my bibliography. It might (or might not) prove

    an outstanding cursive typeface based on Arrighi's designs: and an italic derived
    from Aldus Manutius's italic. De Colines designed and cut these new typefaces
    within the first ten years of producing his first book and launching his very
    successful printing career. In addition to documenting the printer's typographical
    triumphs, this catalogue also features discussion of his use of borders and ornaments.\r\n</dd>\r\n</dl>\r\n\r\nMichel\r\n\r\n"

    married the widow of Robert's brother, Henri Ier Estienne, also a printer. Peignot
    does not mention that de Colines was Henri's associate. This leaves me with more

  body: "<em>more questions than answers</em>\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s inevitable. The more
    closely you look at any busy scene, the more complicated it becomes, and the more
    myths accumulate. The name of Garamond (or Garamont if you prefer) is thick with
    them. But what is extraordinary is how much more is now known with some certainty
    about about the types being made in France during the period 1520 to 1550, when
    Paris and Lyon were among the greatest European centres of printing, compared
    with what was generally available when Updike first published in 1922, and how
    many of the original documents on which existing histories are based at second
    or third hand still survive and have now been published. \r\n\r\nThat date of
    1510 for Garamond\u2019s apprenticeship to Augereau, which has been around since
    the 18th century, is based on the reminiscences of a member of the Le B\xE9 family,
    punchcutters and typefounders. If it is to be believed at all, it makes more sense
    to take it, as Vervliet suggests (in his piece in <em>Typography Papers, 2007</em>),
    as the date of his birth. Then other events fall into a more believable pattern.
    Learning punchcutting in his twenties from Augereau, who is burned in 1534 for
    heresy. Then working for another punchcutter, Pierre Haultin, and for printers
    in Paris during the later 1530s. And finally a certain date, the contract for
    the royal Greek types for Robert Estienne, in 1540. To get that job, he must have
    by then have shown he could do good work.\r\n\r\nMore than one punchcutter was
    making types based directly on the <em>De Aetna</em> of Aldus in Paris around
    1530, and these types are the models for the classic \u2018Garamond\u2019 style.
    Augereau is one of them. Among the other candidates are Francis Gryphius. And
    Constantin (whose first name we don\u2019t know). Who? Read Vervliet. Colines
    never quite took to this new model.\r\n\r\nAnd as for what we think we do now
    know about Garamond, look at John Lane\u2019s scrupulously researched and well-illustrated
    essay in the handsome specimen printed in 2005 to launch Adobe\u2019s Garamond
    Premier Pro. If copies are still around, perhaps you can get it if you buy the
    font. But by now maybe Adobe could consider putting a version on line? It would
    be appreciated.\r\n"

    Thanks. Vevliet's paper covers the period 1530&ndash;1540. Is there any reference
