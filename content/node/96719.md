    Consortium to make a new release of Unicode just to include one new currency symbol
    is in some way unbefitting.\r\n\r\nMyself, though, I don't entirely share the
    opinion: rather, I think there should be some streamlined procedure so that people
    can add support to new characters in their correct code positions immediately,
    while being Unicode compliant, but without the appearance of favoritism that this
    may have given.\r\n\r\nHowever, since that does involve modifying the Unicode
    standard, it's hard not to call it a new release. Maybe call it 6.1.0.1 instead
    of 6.2?\r\n\r\nThe primary user of the Unicode Standard, after all, is not font
    designers, but the data processing community. They print checks, after all."

    If and when the euro crumbles I wonder if different European currencies will return

    proceeding like now, I fear for the standard getting a kind of prisoner of circumstances.
    The independence from actual political influence is challenged. The encoding principles
    once heralded fall behind. \r\nIt was pure actionism. There was no need at all
    to ennoble this *design project of national pride* by hastily encoding it as \u201Ca
    character\u201D. We could well have wait for some time to see this project mature.
    No one expects this char. being available in fonts for the next few months.\r\nIf
    I would want to implement the new Turkish Lira sign into a non-sans font, how
    on earth am I going to know how the rendering of the sign is meant to be? I\u2019m
    just guessing: the proud Turks themselves have not the faintest idea. But this
    question is about nothing less than the very nature of the sign, if there is any
    nature at all, whatsoever. \r\nWe have encoded a silly piece of design simulation.
    If you take the matter of typographic signage serious, the whole action is a defiance
    of our trade. \r\n\r\nThe introduction of the Euro char. was a different story,
    however.\r\n"

    I think the only difference is that the euro was a new currency (although some
    tried to argue the ECU symbol slot could be repurposed), but apart from that it
    seems exactly the same, including the geometric specification of the design and
    the community not really knowing how to draw a serif version. Go back and check
    the archives if you don't believe me. "
