body: Hi everyone. <BR> <BR>I need some help. I&#39;m opening a strip bar in London
  and I&#39;m becoming stuck when it comes to choosing a font for the name. <BR>I
  can&#39;t reveal the name at the moment but I&#39;ve been trying out fonts unsuccessfully.
  I&#39;m after a really beautiful and striking font but my searches on google have
  brought up mostly rubbish. It&#39;s driving me absolutely mad. Do I even have the
  correct forum to ask this question? Any help would be much appreciated. Sorry, I
  know very little about fonts. <BR> <BR>Cheers. <BR> <BR>

  body: When I think &#34;beautiful and striking,&#34; <a href="http://www.psyops.com/html/specimens.html">PsyOps</a>
    comes to mind. &#40;Of course, one can&#39;t leave out Fountain&#39;s beautiful
    and striking <a href="http://www.fountain.nu/catalogue/pussy.asp">Pussy</a> as
    a possibility, nor Mark Simonson&#39;s equally beautiful but more demure <a href="http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/coquette.html">Coquette</a>
    for something, uh, coquettish.&#41; <BR> <BR>But more generally, you can go to
    <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/">MyFonts</a> and do keyword searches such as
    &#34;elegant,&#34; or you can go to <a href="http://www.fontscape.com/">FontScape</a>,
    which groups typefaces in various categories. Hope that helps.

  body: Thanks dude. I think I might have a logo professionally designed now, but
    I found a lovely font via your links - the blue Island font.

    is only three hours away from you in Lincoln. You should invite him down to your
    club when you open!

  body: Yeah it&#39;s a superb font. I might use it in my logo, if I may. I&#39;m
    not sure yet.
