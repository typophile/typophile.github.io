  body: "Ah, yes, I didn't notice that both Helvetica Medium and Helvetica Bold were
    called Helvetica Bold on that page as well.\r\n\r\nBut what annoys me are the
    lengths I had to go to in order to identify ITC Bookman. What the Font didn't
    pick it up, despite ITC Bookman being one of the typefaces for which they sell
    fonts."
