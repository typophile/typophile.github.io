  body: I can appreciate the idea of the craft of photography, but the technology
    has changed. What was once tinkering in the darkroom has now become tinkering
    on the computer. I will always respect those who have and do still use film and
    chemicals to make prints. But the fact of the matter is even with digital backs
    for cameras you still need to understand exposure and lighting. I doubt the photography
    world will ever not be split 50/50 and this is what will drive those who wish
    to attain perfection in what they do.

  body: I don&#39;t think digital can duplicate film in all aspects nor do I think
    that the opposite is true. They are two different mediums that are closely related,
    but separate. I personally would rather look at film grain than jpeg artifacts,
    but once you get up to a certain amount of megapixels &#40;10&#43;&#41; and are
    shooting RAW, digital becomes viable for almost anything. Viable but not necessarily
    the right tool. I think both are worth pursuing as a photographer keeping in mind
    what you want to achieve and which tool will get you there. Much like choosing
    the right lens or filter

  body: I find that even good quality digital cameras do not do a good job on highlights
    where the shape of the pixel shines through. And because the size that the photograph
    can be used at is limited, I am far happier to get a transparency and getting
    it scanned to the size I need. As for integrity, I presume this was a reference
    to &#34;capturing the moment&#34; and printing the whole frame, subjects I recall
    from tutors at college as well, they are disciplines that are good for a photographer
    to develop &#40;no pun intended&#41; but they were only intended as a baseline,
    the first steps to gaining experience. <BR>Tim

  body: I agree with Tim. Film is more pleasing. You cannot Photoshop film grain,
    the filters are too perfect. <BR>This is very similar to the CD vs LP argument.
    Does anyone miss LPs now? Very few miss them enough to have a record player and
    a collection. <BR>Does a older city center feel better than a neo-recreation of
    one? Life as simulation

  body: In my Intermedia Design MFA program &#40;comprised of graphic designers, photographers
    &amp; book artists&#41;, we spend lots of time battling out the &#34;analogue
    vs. digital&#34; debate. Some professors believe that undergrad students who know
    traditional color printing techniques make better images than those who only know
    how to tweak color settings in Photoshop.  <BR>At this state institution, our
    traditional color printing lab was last year turned into a digital lab. Mounds
    of letterpress equipment and metal type collect dust while waiting to be removed
    so another computer lab can be built. Time will tell, I suppose, how all of this
    affects student work.  <BR>I&#39;m not waxing nostalgic, but I think, in an ideal
    world, analogue technology should at least be available as a learning tool, if
    not a practical one.

    should be no argument of analog v. digital. The variety of technologies only strengthens
    a students abilities. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think it is fair, however, to say one
    is more superior to the other in terms of the professional world. It isn&#39;t
    the tool, but the result, isn&#39;t it? <BR> <BR>However, as for film grain etc
    ... Well, with camera backs/cameras offering upwards of 22 megapixels &#40;such
    as Hasselblad&#39;s 528C and the SinarBack54&#41; it is possible to take photos
    undetectable to the eye ... Unless, of course, you open the file in photoshop
    and zoom in beyond 100% ... <BR> <BR>Why this talk of grain? I thought grain was
    the enemy. ;^&#41;

  body: Ok it&#39;s now a fence time now on photo... I have a News/Sports Nikon D2H
    camera.. and a can take Actors and head shots.. it&#39;s more for news and quick
    and great. My printing to a new Epson 800 prints well and better than most a A4
    or 8x10&#39;&#39; 35mm film ..  <BR> <BR>my latest head shots are at  <BR><a href="http://www.sueridermanagement.co.uk/presenters/MilesCrawford/miles.htm"
    target="_blank">http://www.sueridermanagement.co.uk/presenters/MilesCrawford/miles.htm</a>
    <BR> <BR>They were shot with the Nikon D2H with a large soft box and an umbrella
    fill and a back light. <BR> <BR>I printed on the Epson 800 onto Calumet gloss
    paper at 600dpi and they look better than 35mm on to old Ilford Cibacrome <BR>
    <BR>I shoot with studio lights 2-4 flash and 2 x box or umbrellas and no problems.  <BR>
    <BR>I converted them, added them to the site and printed them for the client all
    in one day he got them on Monday from a Sunday shoot. Fastest turn around he would
    have expected.  <BR> <BR>Magazines still want film as 6cm x 6cm or 6cm x 4.5.  <BR>
    <BR>But the next Nikon 2DX is about 12meg pix and the Canon new one is higher
    and there are others now making higher pixel cameras that will kill the media
    cameras.  <BR> <BR>If your customer wants film then you have to take it, but if
    you want good shots and prints you can do it in digital or any thing now.  <BR>
    <BR>But I don&#39;t need a polaroid back and I can shoot 900 shots on to a digi
    card,. No polarods or 10 shot 120 magazines.. only. I can do a few shots download
    them to the computer show the client and off we go.  <BR> <BR>I recently scanned
    some negatives into digital and I am finding that the quality is not as good as
    my Nikon D2H shots at 200 ASA. and I can simulate low res 3200 ASA on the digi
    camera and convert them to B&amp;W as well as with old Kodak recoding film or
    the Ilford 3200 film Simulated grain and all. So I love the pro Digital world.
    But the medium format cameras digital backs are too much for now since they will
    be useless in a year or two.

  body: Of course cost is the biggest digital photo advantage, we made an underwear
    shooting session &#40;hard work&#41; with a photographer two days ago and we got
    260 high quality digital shots for almost the same price we could have got for
    80 film unscanned shots.

  body: I was also comparing my old 35mm B&amp;W prints in 200ASA, 400ASA and high
    speed recording film prints on fiber based paper usually selenium toned and the
    paper is nice but the picture quality is not as good as I get out of the D2H shot
    at 200 ASA or HI at about 3200ASA and converted to B&amp;W.  <BR> <BR>There is
    a nice quality to the 6cm x 6cm negatives and prints and Ilford&#39;s old Cibachrome
    had very nice color paper for 8x10 but it was expensive. The reds were virtually
    metalic.  <BR> <BR>Leaf digital backs for a Hasselblad or Mamiya are about $19,000.

  body: Certainly the digital cameras make economic and deadline sense and as Vincent
    notes every time you turn around the pixels per pound &#40;dollar, euro &amp;c.&#41;
    has improved, but the product can still limit what you can do with it and can
    compromise a design. At least with a decent transparency the limits are reduced
    to almost nil. <BR>Paul, I have still got my LPs and player so I don&#39;t miss

  body: oh and at the last London Third Tuesday Typocircle event, I used my Nikon
    FM-2 with a motordrive and it was nice and solid and about the same size as the
    D2H and I shot Ilford 3200 B&amp;W pushed to 6400 but I haven&#39;t developed
    them yet. But when I do I&#39;m going to scan the negatives and not bother printing
    them traditionally. I&#39;ll print them digitally. Should be fun and hopefully
    grainy. <BR> <BR>Clive Bruton laughed when I told him it was my old Nikon &#40;with
    the manual 50mm lens&#41; said the photos would look like a retro Andy Warhol
    party.  <BR> <BR>the manual lens was great and the high speed was good since there
    was no flash and I could estimate the distance people were at then sneak a shot
    in without having to refocus. Only problem is the motordrive is a bit retro sounding
    and louder than I remember. Film and the gear is better in memory sometimes but
    nice for nostalgia.

  body: I think it must be added that when you say something like &#34;limitations
    become nil&#34; you are also counting on the tranny being developed spot-on perfectly.
    I&#39;m still not convinced. I think we all need to meet and see this perfection.
    ;^&#41; With digital you know right away if you need to shoot again or more of
    the same. With analog you are counting on the shot being perfect and the development
    being perfect and the print to be perfect if the other two are perfect before
    you even know if you have a perfect shot. With digital, it seems to me, that you
    can see the exposure is perfect right away and you are biting your nails waiting
    for perfect developing.

  body: Alright - a discussion! I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any doubt in most peoples
    minds that digital has gotten to the point that it is viable in almost all circumstances
    - I did a 80&#39; x 220&#39; building wrap with a photo that started digital.
    <BR>Great. It&#39;s cleaner, no grain, etc. This is basically the same thing that
    people started complaining about in the digital music world 10 years ago resulting
    in a myriad of filters that would give you that &#34;analog&#34; sound. Why not
    buy a tape recorder on Ebay for nothing because that&#39;s what they&#39;re worth
    these days. <BR>I get no feeling from digital other than the skill of the photographer.
    That may be a plus, but the other side of the coin is that when you hear a pianist,
    you&#39;re not just listening to him, you&#39;re listening to his piano. There
    is no varation in digital pianos of the same brand whereas every Steinway sounds
    different.  <BR>There is a randomness to analog processes &#40;like mixing photographic
    chemicals and doing exposures&#41; that we are going to lose and I guarantee you
    at that point we will try to recreate it digitally. It can&#39;t be done. Life

  body: Ok maybe I over-stated my belief in the perfection of digital. Back in the
    day I was known to use a super-fast speed AND over-develop to get A LOT of grain.
    I like grain too Paul. In fact I really love seeing what people can do with infrared
    film, and it doesn&#39;t get much grainier than that. <BR> <BR>Problem is, I like
    both. I really enjoy seeing how the photographer uses his equipment to get his
    vision across. I can&#39;t see either as best, because they are both only tools.
    I think a photographer who is starting out, that is if this is his chosen profession,
    should understand both. Or at least, if he chooses to go only analog or only digital,
    understand that he won&#39;t always get the job because he doesn&#39;t offer what
    the client wants. Or, on the other hand, if he is good enough at the one tool
    he has chosen to use, he will get clients based on what he has to offer.

    parallel to type design, similar to what you, Paul, just pointed out could be
    the process of drawing the letters first by hand before going to the computer
