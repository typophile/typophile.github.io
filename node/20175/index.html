		<div class="commentbody">I'm not going to favour one or the other, but as Adobe has plenty of boosters, here are a couple of points pro Quark 7, which I think does a good job of supporting OpenType.

1. With Adobe, there is no way of knowing, when you hit the "small caps" button, whether you will get true or faux; with Quark, there is a "small cap" button on both the faux menu and the OpenType menu.

2. Also, Quark implements the OpenType figures features correctly, whereas Adobe does not. (Adobe's method only works for oldstyle fonts that have the four main figure classes.)

3. Quark's glyph palette lets you scroll through your font library, very useful to see which fonts have which OpenType features.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><em>Not</em> disregarding the Quark vs. InDesign question: I would think that, on the Mac side, having a Universal (i.e., Intel Mac-native) version of QuarkXPress out almost a year before InDesign could be a factor in Quark's favor. Note, as <a href="http://www.creativepro.com/story/news/24299.html?cprose=7-21">CreativePro</a> points out, that Adobe pre-announced some features of InDesign CS3 the same day Quark 7 was released.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think Adobe's dominance is pretty much assured, and Quark is going to die a very slow death if it doesnt find a way to differentiate from InDesign, besides the relatively lower price and odd feature or two.

The problem is, it appears to be targeting exactly the same market as InDesign, with nary an attempt to appeal to a more specialist crowd, apart from pictures of happy young designers.  Not enough methinks.

On a separate note, I thought Quark had an excellent logo before, I cannot stand this concentric circle device their brand consultants came up with.  Shame that the Scots thought of the old logo first though eheheh.

There's a nice InDesign PlugIn by DTPTools that allows you to set transparancy for the pallettes: X-Ray. It's 19 bucks…

These can always be hidden and activated with key commands, just like Quark's. But are not modal so can float for easy access if desired.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">My partner still uses it in her job, mainly because she knows it inside out and can work very quickly with it. She doesn't see much advantage to switching to InDesign because it would bring her productivity level way down while she gets use to a new program. Lots of newsletters, magazines and brochures, with not enough time to do anything, much less learn a new program. Not to mention having to redo templates for everything. I think a lot of people are in the same boat.

I only use Quark for testing fonts and when I'm working with someone who insists on using it. I use InDesign for multi-page documents, but I'm most comfortable working in Illustrator and use it for almost anything else.</div>

On the down side, they did not actually ship the universal binary everybody's talking about. Word is that it's supposed to be in August. That's probably why the Suitcase plug-in is PPC-only.

The first review of QuarkXPress 7 in a major publication is out, from Galen Gruman in MacWorld: http://www.macworld.com/2006/05/reviews/qxp7/index.php (note: I was surprised by the overall feel of this - I think of Gruman of leaning towards the Quark side of the fence.)

I'll shut up now about QXP7, lest somebody accuse me of being partisan.

		<div class="commentbody">my problem with Quark is that it has gone through a number of evolutions, and has yet to see a facelift. The GUI looks like something from the stone age. That might be to critical of a point to make, but, I am an interface junky, and do prefer the look and feel of my friend InD. Also, Nick Shinn made reference to the fact that you can never tell with InD wether or not you get faux or true small caps, and that is not true. If you use the key command, shift+apple+h, or if you use the quick button, you may get faux, however, if you go under the type palette options menu, under OpenType and choose "All small caps" I am certain that you only get true small caps. Typically, if I am setting with SC's, then I will take the time to make sure that they are correct, and also check to see if there are any other alternates available that I might wish to utilize as well.

It seems to me that I have a knack for killing threads; not sure why, just keeps happening. I hope this one keeps going, otherwise I think I might be cursed or something.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Adobe has that problem, I will agree. However, I do prefer their interface as opposed to Quark's, and I do think that an evolution of icons, or interface, or both, every three or four versions, is something that we should all be willing to accept. It just reminds me so much of an old mac, analog style, and sometimes I hate it, other times I love it. Guess it depends on my mood really, if I'm feeling avant-guard(ish) then InD, and if I'm feeling renaissance then QXP.

You might just bring the curse back down on you, many posters here prefer InD, personally I feel you can set something just as well in Quark and be more confident the software isn't "helping" you, but I have not used InD as much as Quark.

Like Mark's partner, I was leary of changing to a new program when I started InD.  It didn't take that long to get used to, and InD will open your Quark templates complete with style sheets so that is not that big of a issue.

Matthew, with InDesign (CS), the "small caps" button in the first sub-menu activates true small caps if available in an OpenType font, but faux if not (that is the problem). It only changes lower-case letters, not caps; it should really be named "caps with small caps". The "all small caps" button in the OpenType menu turns both caps and lower case into true small caps, and is greyed out if there are no small caps in an OT font.</div>

Not necessarily. For instance AGaramond Pro Italic and ACaslonPro Italic don't have small caps, but AJensonPro italic and MinionPro Italic do. Sure, ideally the user should know what the features of the fonts are, but it's not apparent from the InD "small caps" button. </div>

That's funny, Ken. I thought that it was Adobe that was targeting the same market as Quark, when they decided to make a "Quark killer" (their term for InDesign, when it was being developed).

But also, what do you mean by "a more specialist crowd"? It's a page layout program! Who should they be trying to sell it to, if not designers (be they graphic, publication, or book designers)?</div>

No argument on that.

<cite>...when they decided to make a “Quark killer” (their term for InDesign, when it was being developed).</cite>

This is a popular myth, but my colleagues on the InDesign team have always said that this name was pushed by the press. Certainly in my own many meetings and discussions with them, I never heard the phrase used (except in discussions of the media and popular perception), it was just "Shuksan" and then later "K2."

		<div class="commentbody">Thomas, now that we're in the process of demystification, can you shed a light on the urban myth that Abobe originally approached Quark to colaborate in some sort of way, but after Quark kindly told them to f*** right off Adobe decided to pay Quark back in full by developing its own page lay-out software InDesign?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yves,
I think it was their own customers who "Quark kindly told to f*** right off" thus opening the door for Adobe to fill the void of customer respect. Quark would still be the absolute front-runner if they knew how to treat their customers.

		<div class="commentbody">I remember about a year or two ago, MacDesign mag made a point of dropping its Quark coverage in favor of InDesign-- their covers literarlly dropped Quark from the list of programs and InDesign is now in that slot (last I saw). It's just one magazine, but it's a boon for beginners, and I see their move as one indication of an editorial change made in light of real shifts in who's using what--

In fact, at my university, we in the "Professional Writing and Editing" program don't even bother with Quark, although I've felt a little guilty for years because I've assumed that our journalism students will encounter Quark plenty in the newspaper design realm. 

Any observations on real significant shifts away from Quark in the newspaper/mag design arena?</div>

Apparently they've learned their lesson, Chris. I hear their customer support is much friendlier now (and that they fired their Mac-hating CEO -- but that's old news by now).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I am somewhat partial to InDesign CS2 over Quark 7 so far as far as useability, but there are several factors included in why I am partial, and not all of them have to do with the GUI or features in either program.

Quark *did* make an effort to work more closely with customers in the beginning. However, they continue to make it nearly impossible for corporate customers (such as myself) to receive volume discounts, as they require software called "Quark License Administrator" to be running on a server, with access to Quark's servers. Not only is this impossible to implement in a huge corporate (such as mine), but in a highly-regulated industry (such as mine), it is a definite no-no. They refuse to offer a site license for any company, no matter how many licenses a particular site has. They are distrustful and greedy, in my opinion. It takes me endless hours to successfully work with Quark toward ANY end; even just upgrading software.

Adobe, on the other hand, freely offers site licenses using only one serial number per software package, per site or group. They still require activation, but do not limit their corporate customers in the way of requiring a group to run a server with some license administrator running on it. With Adobe, I can upgrade, purchase new licenses, and download my serial numbers in a matter of minutes. To me, there is no contest.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Let's not for get to mention Quark 7's use of color-based transparency so I can select letters within boxes and ascripe unique transparency attributes...something that takes multiple boxes in InDesign. Also we're already finding that having people team up on layouts really helps at crunch time and I find it really useful to dupe layouts within the same project for variations (a 6.5 feature). Also...going forward, Quark 7 will be able to open Quark 9 files because of the way they've "thought ahead" with DOM...the way the industry is moving to Open Standards (including Microsoft)...except for Adobe that makes its shareholder's money on proprietary formats....food for thought...</div>
