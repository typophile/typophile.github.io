  body: "Sorry to reopen an old thread, but I have the same question as McKonkie...\r\n\r\nWhile
    the typeface used is Knockout, it seems to be a rounded version. Anyone know if
    this available somewhere?\r\n\r\nIf not, any suggestions for an another strong
    (rounded) condensed headline typeface?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/farrow_3596.png]"
