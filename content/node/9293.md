  the word: Nichole Deborah OR nichole deborah <BR> <BR>I&#39;m thinking something
  either thin geometric or humanist, or possibly a script. <BR> <BR>I have found a
  lot of great things, but nothing that looks appropriate with her actual name set
  in it. <BR> <BR>This will be the masthead for an upcoming album release. <BR> <BR>It
  needs to be graceful, stylish, mature, and slightly feminine. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m attaching
  a promoshot of the artist for reference. <BR> <BR>Any thoughts you have would be
  ver helpful. <BR> <BR>We have around a $150 budget for the font. <BR> <BR>Kyle.<img

    through SO MANY scripts, its just such and odd character composition... hard to
    find something that looks right. <BR> <BR>So, on to script/hand writing suggestions

  body: Kyle, <BR>Get her to write it, or write it yourself &#40;if you can make yourself
    &#34;graceful, stylish, mature, and slightly feminine&#34;&#41;. So much more
    effective than making a font look like handwriting. Of course, the problems come
    when you have to produce a lot of literature. <BR>Tim

    it was only for the mark, then that would be the best. But her request is that
    we do titling and such in it too.

  body: i believe you should be able to purchase the faces indivudually. in fact,
    you can purchase just the one font from the link i posted above &#40;the second
    one&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Or for something a bit more customized... you could have someone
    digitize some of the artist&#39;s own handwriting... just an idea.
