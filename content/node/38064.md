  body: "I think that what Yves was after, Jonny B, was more like ... the reason that
    those - and most high quality fonts aren't free is because they require many,
    many hours of work to do correctly.\r\n\r\nThat said, your situation seems to
    present a very legitimate need of free fonts <em>as close as possible</em> to
    the originals. You aren't going to find anything precisely like the Morgan and
    Stella series for free - or nearly as well made - but you might check DaFont's
    <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=501&page=1&nb_ppp_old=10&text=Type+your+text+here&nb_ppp=50&psize=m&classt=pop\"
    target=\"_blank\">Sans Serif section</a> for something as close as possible."

  body: I should have elaborated indeed. It is very unlikely you will find fonts similar
    to these for free because a whole lot of talent, skill and effort went into creating
    these specific fonts. I don't see anyone else doing the same quality job and then
    give away his/her work for free. It's just doesn't make sense.

    they were absolutely not -- they were designed by Mario Feliciano not \"specifically
    to a project\" but for retail, to sell for profit. So anybody who wants to can
    purchase a license. That's the mechanics of economy. Somebody produces something,
    and then sells the fruit of his labour to be able to buy something somebody else
    produced (like food, lodging, goods, \u2026)"

    good freeware font, and indeed bears a certain resemblance to Morgan Avec.

  body: This brings up an interesting topic but I'm not sure if it is enough so for
    a new thread. Why would a teacher tell their students to use something as close
    as possible (or the same)? Maybe I'm assuming a lot here, but doesn't that force
    the students (obviously) to go online and perhaps end up on sites that only promote
    piracy?

    an article I had found in a magazine. The aim of the exercise was to get us to
    observe someone else's work very closely and to familiarize ourselves with the
    type control aspects of Quark (those were the days, not). It was not a creative
    project, but more about the tools. In that case I had to find matching (or as
    close as possible) typefaces from the school's type library. \r\n\r\nJonnyB2's
    description sounds similar, no?"

    to \"free fonts,\" it's forcing them to choose fonts from a much more limited
    set to try to get the closest matches to some specific fonts. The exercise could
    help them learn a lot about letterforms, I'd think, and perhaps a bit about differences
    in quality.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Hmm. Maybe I've been reading too many EULAs and I've forgotten what it is
    like to be a teacher and a student (having been both). \r\n\r\nI think one can
    study another's work and have a great discussion about it without having to actually
    create something similar. Articulating why it is good or what makes it work would
    make a great essay. I guess, in a way, I can see how it would be helpful though.
    I just think it puts the student in a dangerous position of having to make a choice
    (find the exact and pirate it or find something close that is genuine freeware,
    hmmm?) that they otherwise might not. Yes, yes, students have millions of other
    reasons to find themselves making that decision, but from an educator's perspective
    I don't think it is wise."
