body: "Hi everybody,\r\n\r\nis there a way to automatically set L/R/LR kern class
  flags according to the name using Python?\r\nI'm importing a .ufo back into FontLab,
  but since .ufo doesn't support the flags the kern classes are unflagged, and I have
  to manually re-import the kern class files.\r\n\r\nOr, in other words: How do I
  manipulate kern classes of FL font objects anyway?\r\nOnly thing I could find is
  f.classes, which gives a list of classes and members, which is probably editable.
  But what about the flags?\r\n\r\nThank,\r\nYanone"
