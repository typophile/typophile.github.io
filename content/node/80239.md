  body: "The red square cross on a white field is a trademark of the International
    Red Cross/Red Crescent Society and affiliated national organizations. Functions
    not directly related to those organizations should use a distinctly different
    emblem.\r\n\r\nHowever, a a white square cross on various colored fields (usually
    green but red and other colors are frequently used) has become a generic emblem
    for first-aid medicine and other emergency services. The design in your image
    is a white square cross centered on a Japanese national flag, which can be regarded
    as distinct both from the Red Cross logo and the Swiss national flag, and associated
    directly with the current emergency in Japan. It may run afoul of trademark regulations,
    but its meaning is reasonably obvious, provided it isn't being used deceptively
    for something other than non-profit emergency services."
