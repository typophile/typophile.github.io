    look angry or irritated or even zobie like. Prob not a good way to align your
    identity with a good consumer experience.

    not even supposed to be AIWA anymore.

    another level removed in that it has moved into abstraction and is allowed to
    generate its own logic. Would we be justified in saying the logo becomes louder
    or more intense? The effect reminds me of Picasso&#39;s late drawings where you

    interesting than most people here are prepared to admit. If this forum is meant

    fair enough. Let me know and I won&#39;t bother anyone with further posts.'

  body: We have here a range from unintelligible to boring. The ultimate goal is immediate
    recognition and good taste. Obfuscation is shooting yourself in the foot, clumsy
    type treatments -- bed, bath, and beyond &#40;the WC?&#41; -- causes a viewer
    to move on without pausing to register a positive thought. That&#39;s pi$$ing
    into the wind.

  body: it does fit the newer &#34;sony logos&#34; but I still prefer the old one.
