  body: "I got it to work after I populated the Names and Copyright section under
    Font Info.\r\n\r\nNow I need to figure out how to keep the kerning. I've done
    some manual kerning, and it works in the metrics window, but not in the font itself.
    I'm using Illustrator CS2 to test it."

  body: Try to uncheck the option "Export old-style non-OpenType kern table". Kerning
    in OpenType CFF fonts (.otf) should be done via the kern <strong>feature</strong>,
    not via the kern <strong>table</strong>.

  body: 'Thanks again Miguel for your post. I unchecked the box, but I''m having the
    same problem. I was planning to read up on class kerning soon, but hoped to get
    by in the mean time by experimenting with manual kerning. It works great in the
    metrics window. I guess OpenType requires more. '

    any way?"

    avoid this error. I had the same issue, just filled out the font info, and oila!
    No more mysterious error. My kerning and ligatures started working in Illustrator
    as well. Apparently this error has nothing to do with the open type features as
    the error suggests. \r\n\r\nJay"
