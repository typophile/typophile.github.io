  disscussion board in this website and would very much like to use it in my paper
  i am working on for schoool, but i can't seem to find the author. if this looks
  like your writing, would you mind if i quoted you in my paper. it works perfectly
  for \"what not to do\" (ethically) in design, it is a great example. i would like
  to give credit in my paper to the person who wrote it.\r\n \r\n\"Designers can play
  a huge role in society; most don't. Those designing for products that have a massive
  impact on the lives of people around the world, or those who get into the world
  of politics\u2014which they often don't now, as the 24-hour news cycle has wiped
  out the time needed to work good design into politics\u2014have to be careful about
  the ethical lines they might be crossing; I believe that most designers are doing
  quite well when it comes to ethical decision making. I think that this is in large
  part due to the glaring examples of what happens when designers go bad that we have
  left over from the twentieth century: all the great designers who worked tirelessly
  designing propaganda for the Nazi and Communist parties which then committed unconscionable
  acts against humanity that overshadow all other great evils of history.\"\r\n \r\nThanks
  tons,\r\n SaveGirl101\r\n"

  body: "i tried that, i have to guess that the post is really old it's from nov.
    26 2006. this person was writing to a \"MissG\" post on \"what else should a designer
    keep in mind\". they were irritated by a comment someone made about Paul Renner
    being a communist and this person set the record straight in a latter post.\r\n\r\nHopefully,
    this information is useful in jogging the memory of this post.\r\n"
