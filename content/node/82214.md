  Foundries. It is the only free font by the company (it is free because the original
  customer rejected it last minute). It is called Lido STF, and is designed as a replacement
  for Times. \r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/lido-stf/\r\n\r\nI have found
  that on-screen it looks a bit quirky but prints incredibly well. It takes up about
  as much space as Times New Roman horizontally, but is vertically taller, so works
  well at small sizes. \r\n\r\nWhat is your opinion of this font?"

    for others. In this case, I think Storm did an outstanding job of achieving what
    he set out to achieve. What are you thinking of using the typeface for, exactly?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: 'I am thinking of possibly using this for the text of a Latin-language Bible
    (the condensed version, I think, makes a good title font as it is taller). It
    is simple enough not to be distracting from the text itself and legible enough
    to be used at a small size to decrease material cost. It is not, however, so simple
    as to be boring. I stumbled upon this font almost on accident, to be honest. '

    be a good choice.

    yet decided on the paper. \r\n\r\nConversely, I have found a different font which
    I have fallen in love with (it's a Caslon remake), but am unable to afford at
    this point. "

  body: hrant - for now, yes. If I am going to buy a font, I'd like to purchase the
    Caslon remake (I believe it is called Williams Caslon) I mentioned above (being
    at college, money is rather tight).

    I know you'll find a lot on Typophile. Look for a serif font with wide forms,
