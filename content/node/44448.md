  suspect it might be a custom work, but would like to know if there is anything similar
  to it which could be used as a base.\r\n\r\nThanks alot"

  body: Thanks Lex for the reply, for some reason the roundness of the font caught
    my eye, I can clearly see the difference between those two now, do you have any
    ideas what might 'MEED' be by any chance ?!
