  find comp specs or typography standards\r\nfor early learning reading? Surely they

  body: "Charles, this doesn't quite answer the specs and standards question directly,
    but the person who I think did the best work in this area is Dr. Rosemary Sassoon
    \u2013 after whom the Sassoon typeface on the ITC article page is named. Find
    out more about the work she has done with Adrian Williams and Club Type <a href=\"http://www.clubtype.co.uk/sassjoiner.html\">here.</a>"
