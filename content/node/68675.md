  body: "Unfortunately, browsers are stupid enough to expect non-ASCII characters
    to be percent-encoded in URLs. Hence it would be typical to see browsers, including
    the one you\u2019re using to compose the link, borking at a structure like <code>&lt;A
    HREF=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrz\u0105szcz\"&gt;</code>. It would have
    to be encoded as <code>Chrz%C4%85szcz</code>, I think."
