I'm charged with designing my father's tombstone, and I have very little time to select a typeface. Any suggestions would be helpful.
His name is (was) Francis G Burke, and I find both the B and the K to be a challenge when the whole name is capitalized as required by the graveyard regulations. I just don't want Times New Roman, and that's what the engraver uses most of the time.
Thanks,
Eileen

<div class=commentbody>If you could, please tell us something about your father, e.g.: his career, hobbies, interests. Not all of that can be expressed through a typeface, but it would give us something to go on in offering selections.
There are considerations in lettering design for monuments to forestall erosion and such, but with modern techniques that usually involve sandblasting through a computer-cut template into very hard stone such as granite, those considerations don't really apply.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Here are a few lovely examples. None are typefaces, per se, but they show you what is possible if you were to use something such as Thomas' suggestion of Waters Titling. All were taken in various graveyards in Ditchling.

<div class=commentbody>First off, quite sorry for your loss.
You should keep in mind, that some of the most beautiful stones are done by hand-lettering... even though the above examples are quite nice in their own right, they are some examples of less refined hand carved lettering... or rather, very stylized versions.
A good stone letter carver letterforms can be as nicely refined as formal typefaces... with those small idiosyncracies that make them amazing. Granted, it is pricier... although I do not think that it is prohibitively so.
If you choose a font / typeface, it will most likely be sandblasted on the stone... giving perfection and a flat back... whereas with hand done lettering, you get those really nice V cuts within the letterforms.
I am sure, whatever you do, it will be the right + nice solution for you, however, I would keep solid hand carved letters in mind if it is a priority to get the most beautiful results possible.

<div class=commentbody>Thank you all so much for your condolences and great suggestions. So far, I rather like Aichel.
To answer the questions thus far ...
My dad lived his entire life in the Boston area, but I'd love suggestions for stone carvers anywhere in the northeast. I've only visited one monument shop, and it wasn't memorable.
I'd love hand carved lettering, but I'm not opposed to a well crafted sandblasted stone. The photos posted above are gorgeous, but are too flourished for my dad -- and the stone will have my mother's name added when she dies, and she prefers a more simple, somewhat stoic look.
About my dad? Well, his parents came over on the boat, literally, from Ireland just before he was born. I'd love the stone to have an old world feel with just a touch of Ireland implied. He was a very simple, understated man, often quiet, and exceedingly kind. I don't think he had a single mean thought in his entire life. <a href="http://www.asimas.com/ASIMAS/everett/obituaryDescription.jsp?domain_id=224&deceased_id=141638">His obituary. </a></div>

Note that these pair nicely as serif and sans companions, so you could vary styles depending how much text will be on the stone.
Mentor Sans might suggest 'stoic'.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Aichel would be truest to German traditions—the caps are somewhat less colorful than the U/lc. [[http://www.greatbuildings.com/architects/Jan_Blazej_Santini-Aichel.html]]
Possibly more international and workable (but still Czech) would be [[ http://http://www.type-together.com/ampl_font.php?idpuente=8|Maiola ]]
and [[http://www.vllg.com/Feliciano/Garda/mudTyper+Weights/|Garda No. 2]] or even No. 1 could be a less Roman alternate to Trajan.

<div class=commentbody>I've been unable to see a sample of Adobe Penumbra Flare since the Adobe website keeps stalling out on me. Munc is a lovely uncial, but my mother (an elementary teacher) says it looks "too much like a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters."
I'd love to know if anyone has ever seen <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/aichel/aichel/>Aichel</a> (or similar) carved in stone, and if so, did it work well or look awkward? I've never designed for stone carving before.
I'm also still searching for a Boston area stone carver. My mom really wants to pick the actual stone personally, but doesn't want to travel too far out of Boston.
Thanks to all the comments here, I've learned a lot about what to look for. It's important to me that I'm proud of it when it's finally installed, and you've all been a great help.</div>
