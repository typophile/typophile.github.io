    you'll find an exact digital match, but you might like <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=FF.6185.2.9&attributes.sampleSize=74&sampleText=CERNISEVSKI&sampleSize=96\">FF

  body: "If this wasn't before digital, I would said it was stretched by some amateur
    typographer. Indeed the proportions in the three samples are different.\r\n\r\nCould
    it be something from Nebiolo ? I found on the page of <a href=http://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/nebiolo/>Luc
    Devroye</a> the following description : \r\n\"<strong>Inglesi allungati</strong>
    (an extremely condesed serif type with high contrast. Looks like something Georg
    Trump might have done, something like Amati. Never digitized.)\"\r\n\r\nI wonder
    if someone who has typespecimens from Nebiolo could take a look ...\r\n"

  body: "Since you say this was a <cite>series</cite>, I have a hunch that some of
    it (most probably the VOLTAIRE, and possibly the CERNISEVSKI) was type, but then
    they couldn't find the same type (and Typophile's ID section was down in that
    decade ;-) so they either used a bad clone or rendered it by hand. Look at the
    quality difference between the tops of the legs of the \"R\"s for one.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Hrant, that was my initial thinking. Now I'm looking at all books from that
    series, and I see every title is a bit different from the other. Almost sure it's
    lettering, but I guess the first ones were inspired from a real typeface.\r\n\r\n[Edit]
    Interesting to know, the first sample (VOLTAIRE) it's the oldest I have (1957),
    it's possible to be the typeface or closer to the original."

    because it is black? The yellow looks pokier.
