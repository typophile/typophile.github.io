body: "I have a client looking to have us replicate this type for a business card,
  and I have a feeling I am not going to be able to find it.  Since it is effected
  and warped so much, I can't use any typical font identity applications.  After browsing
  through similar font types for over an hour, I can't find anything that is similar
  enough to use or manipulate.  Any help with this would be awesome, but I may just
  be stuck with using their pixelated art, or attempting to redraw in illustrator...\r\n\r\nThank
  you"
