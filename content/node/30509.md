  downloaded Adobe Garamond Premier Pro (Style: Medium) and I'm testing it on my body
  style.\r\n\r\nIt's looks great with one problem. There is a strange arch that connects
  the right side of the 's' to the left side of the 'p' or 't' at the x-height in
  all my 'st' and 'sp' character combinations.\r\n\r\nI do not think it's a printing
  issue. The strange arch shows up in all my electronic file types as well.\r\n\r\nI'm
  saving from InDesign CS2 .indd file to a .ps file. Then I'm converting the .ps to
  a .pdf and printing on an HP C3180.\r\n\r\nI've done some googling and some searching
  about on the net. It seems that no one has had this problem.\r\n\r\nCan anyone offer
  advice or direction?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMike\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

      arches are called ligatures.\r\n\r\nI've unchecked \"Disretionary Ligatures\"
      and \"Ligatures\" in the character palette menu. \r\n\r\nBut the ligatures remain.\r\n\r\nMike"

  body: 'Hmm. The st and sp ligatures should only show up if "Discretionary Ligatures"
    is checked. Sometimes these things can be persistent, for instance if you have
    somehow enabled them as part of your default text style. Also: Unchecking it when
    nothing is selected will not change existing text that has it enabled. Have you
    tried selecting all of your text and then looking at the setting?'

    body: "Yes. It's strange.\r\n\r\nWhen I opened the character palette, all that
      was checked was \"Ligatures\". I selected the text, un-checked \"Ligatures,\"
      and nothing happened. I also typed the 'st' and \r\n'sp' combinations into a
      new .indd file: same attempts at fixing the problem gave the same results. \"Discretionay
      Liagtures\" wasn't checked in the OpenType sub-menu. I checked that, than un-checked
      it (with the text selected)  just to see what would happen. No changes both
      ways.\r\n\r\nIf I open the glyph palette, InDesign registers the ligature as
      a glyph. Is there a command like 'disable glyphs' or 'replace glyph with characters'.
      I can't seem to find a way to do this automatically. And it's a 180 page document,
      so I really do not want to do it one by one.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help.\r\n\r\nMike\r\n"

  body: I'm not sure, but I think that maybe you are not selecting the affected text
    before unchecking "Discretionary Ligatures". It works just like bold or italic
    or changing a font. You have to select the text you want to change first. If no
    text is selected, changing the setting will have no visible effect.

    body: "Wish it was my mistake and it was that simple, but it seems it's not.\r\n\r\nIn
      all my checking and un-checking of both \"Ligatures\" and \"Discretionary LIgatures,\"
      I've had text selected. Still, the \"st\" ligature and the \"sp\" ligature remain.
      This same selected text has changed appropriately when, for example, I have
      checked and un-checked the \"Superscript\" and \"Underline\" options. But when
      I un-check \"Ligature\" and/or \"Discretionary Ligature,\" the ligatures remain
      in the selected text.\r\n\r\n"

    didn't find anything wrong with the font as well.

      gone a number of routes, through the character palette, through the paragraph
      styles palette. I can't get rid of them. I've checked and unchecked \"Ligatures,\"
      \"Discretionary Ligatures,\" even \"Contextual Alternatives.\"\r\n\r\nTwo questions.\r\n\r\n1.
      Is there any way to disable glyphs? Or perhaps a function where I can automatically
      replace a glyph with two characters?\r\n\r\n2. For those who have had no problems
      with Garamond Premier Pro on Intel-based Macs: What style have you been using
      (as in \"Light,\" \"Medium,\" \"Semibold\")? ? I only have \"Medium,\" which
      I bought as test run to see how it would look for my book's body text. \r\n\r\nThanks
      for your insights."

    Just today, InDesign crashed about every other time I tried to place an image

    other utilities (Onyx, if I'm not mistaken) and also with Linotype Font Explorer.
