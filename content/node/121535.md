  mainly Document weddings. It's called T o m o r r o w's Memoirs. \r\n\r\nWanted
  to capture the message that a story is being told through my work when I shoot weddings
  or other celebrations and I also want to incorporate film. Hence the Quill pen made
  of film strip. I'm not the best Drawer. I have someone inking my sketches now so
  I can see what it looks like. "

  body: "You need to be careful that people don't see the quill pen and think you're
    an illustrator or calligrapher. The film strip look (sprocket holes and visible
    frames) is clever but video doesn't have those. \r\n\r\nMaybe I'll change my mind
    when I see the finished art, but currently I don't think it's working. But keep
    working on it.\r\n\r\nVideo is a difficult concept for icons. People used to use
    VCR cassettes as icons, but those are rapidly disappearing. I know that film strips
    are still used sometimes as icons, but they really don't fit video. Maybe a video
    camera shape or a clapboard?\r\n\r\n> T o m o r r o w's Memoirs.\r\n\r\nNormally
    you don't space out characters when writing a company's name in plain text, even
    if it's widely spaced in the logo. It looks odd and if it's at the end of the
    line it could be broken into 2 lines with no hyphen.\r\n"

  body: "Logos often need to be reproduced in a small size (business card, small web
    ad, etc), but in a small size the ink bottle becomes way too light and the sprocket
    holes disappear:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo3_6408.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
    would increase the line weight and make the sprocket holes fewer and larger. Remember
    this is an icon, not a literal representation.\r\n\r\nAlso the type spacing needs
    some tweaking. At the very least I'd move the T closer to the O and center the
    apostrophe between W and S. Also the type might be too light in small sizes, print
    it in small sizes as a test. \r\n\r\nAnd you might consider putting the name in
    2 lines \u2014 at least when it's printed in small sizes \u2014\_as in narrow-width
    situations the drawing will become small to accommodate the type's width.\r\n\r\n"
