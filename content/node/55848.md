body: "I managed to delete my first post offering a \"free\" font. I was trying to
  fix a spelling error. Okay, The font is not free. It is a $0.00 priced license (I
  hope we have that clarified). It is not a watered down version of the font. Freemium?
  Nope. Actually, I doubt anyone here will have much use for it. It is a turn of the
  century (1900's) sign painters letter style. But, please accept it in the spirit
  in which it is offered. \r\n\r\nOkay, boys and girls, guys and gals, the Fontry
  has a freebie offer \u201Cfor a limited time only.\u201D Mr. Adkins in his infinite
  wisdom and generosity is giving away FHA Eccentric French. This font is from the
  suffering genius of Mr. Adkins and Mr. Smith (I kid you not) based on the font published
  by Mr. Atkinson himself. Please, use it and enjoy. If you come up with any really
  cool designs with Eccentric, drop me an email. I'd love to see what you come up
  with.\r\n\r\nLeave comments as you see fit.\r\n\r\nThe Terms...\r\nThis font (FHA
  Eccentric French) is free for personal or commercial use. It is not free for distribution
  without permission. Do not modify or reverse engineer or whatever. That is the extent
  of my EULA. \r\n\r\n[[http://www.thefontry.com/fhaeccentricfrench]]\r\n\r\nThanks
  and have a wonderful day."

    site in years and it was good to get reconnected to it and remember it's still
    there. \r\n\r\nI love the work of Atkinson. It's also been many years since I
    had a subscription to Sign of the Times. One of my favorite sections was the Atkinson
    plates.\r\n\r\nBeautiful work.\r\n"

    help but check out everything. I adore retro fonts and have been having a crazy
    jones for Lonestar/58Rodeo lately even though I've got nothing to use it for.
    Unfortunately I'm not getting any projects that call for a nostalgic look. Almost
    everything I'm getting, which is very little these days, is web based with everyone
    wanting a very modern look.\r\n\r\nThe last time I got to buy a good retro font
    was for goldleaf numerals on the transom window of an old building. The Fontry
    site is bookmarked, now I've just got to sniff out a project that could use one
    of those fonts. It's great to know you guys are out there doing this work and
    glad you posted here."
