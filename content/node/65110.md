  a combination of letters only if it's in the beginning or at the end of a word?
  Or if it's a whole word?\r\nThanks alot\r\n\r\nKonstantinos Siskakis\r\nAnagrafi\r\nGreece\r\n"

  body: "Yes. Use the feature clig (contextual ligatures). For a beginning or end
    of word it helps to use a lookup along with classes for letters.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n\r\n@Letters
    = all letters except space\r\n\r\n   feature clig {\r\n   lookup clig_dsend {\r\n
    \  ignore sub d' s' @Letters;\r\n   sub d' s' space by d_s.end;\r\n   } clig_dsend;\r\n\r\n

  body: "Hello all, my first post here. \r\nHaving created a 'salt' feature for Stylistic
    Alternates in my OT-PS fonts with FontLab, \r\nI find that MS-Word cannot see
    them. \r\nIn Word, RIGHT-CLICK on text, select FONT > ADVANCED > STYLISTIC SETS:
    'Default' appears. \r\nClicking on this drop-down reveals Set 1, Set 2 Set 3 etc.\r\nSo
    how does 'Set 1' relate to a feature in the OT font table?\r\nShould the 'salt'
    feature be linked in some way to ''Set 1'?\r\nFontLab forum offers now clue, nor
    does anything I can find on the net.\r\n\r\nI note that some designers are using
    Stylistic sets to address different page layout apps like Illustrator, XPress,
    InDesign. Set 1 for Ill/InDes, Set 2 for XPress etc.\r\n\r\nThanks for any insight,\r\nAdrian\r\n"

  body: "Hi Adrian - what version of MS Word are you using?\r\n\r\nThe preview edition
    of MS Word in Office 2010 (for Windows) introduces support for a few OpenType
    typographic features, including stylistic alternates.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately you
    won't find this support in older versions of Office for Windows, or in the Mac
    Office 2008 version.\r\n\r\nAll the best,\r\n\r\nBill Davis"

  body: "Some would consider what follows a hack, but if Word only supports stylistic
    sets . . .\r\n\r\nPut the same substitutions you have in your salt feature in
    a Stylistic Set feature, say SS01. You can have both salt and SS features with
    the same substitutions.\r\n\r\n(I believe FontLab has an example of the exact
    syntax for Stylistic sets ... it is not hard to write.)\r\n\r\nRecompile, write
    off, (purge older version of the font) and and turn on SS01 in Word."
