  to identify a typeface used on an old theater sign in Kansas City. The top sign
  was the original from when the theater opened in the late 60s, the middle and bottom
  are from the \"new\" theater that was opened down the street when the original was
  torn down in 2000 (middle being a picture of interior signage and bottom being the
  new sign). There are slight differences, but they appear to be derived from the
  same source."

    A flavor of German and Olde English blackletter, seasoned with tendril and ball
    decorations etc.\r\nFor the blackletter lowercase the best general fit might be
    Morris Gothic, Digitized by HiH [img:sites/default/files/old-images/MorrisGothicAsGlenwood_3768.gif]

    P22 http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/p22/morris/\r\nFor the _o_  consider Will Bradley's
    1894 lettering as made into a font for American Type Founders in 1895. Digital

    ball decorations consider Euclid by Central Type Foundry in the 1880s. Digital
