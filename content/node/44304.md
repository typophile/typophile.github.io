body: "Hello, again.\r\n\r\nI've got two seemingly simple ones here. The first, seen
  here as the white episode description text - should be really simple. I was told
  it was Futura, but I checked and it doesn't seem to be as the \"s\" and capital
  \"G\" are different at least. Please can someone set me straight with this easy
  one?\r\n\r\nAlso, the blue episode titles: I've seen that font before. For the life
  of me however, I cannot find any fonts on my computer with that type of capital
  \"E\". I'm sure someone knows what it is though.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your
  help, gurus. :)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/simple_huh_4689.jpg]"

    that from season 2?"

  body: "Actually, it's from the back cover of Season 1: Disc 4. I'm working on a
    thinpak conversion cover for \"Razor\". A friend wants a cover that will match
    up with the retail covers for all the season releases.\r\n\r\nThanks for identifying
    these for me so quickly! I'll be able to get this done now. :D\r\n\r\nInteresting
    shirt there. Truly geeky to mix sci-fi, typeface names and put the result on a
    shirt. :)"

    the way, this thread can be marked as identified. Those fonts were correct."
