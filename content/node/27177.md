  library &amp;/or web under &#34;Superman&#34;, &#34;comic books&#34; or &#34;DC
  Comics&#34;; check DC Comics&#39; website &#40;<A HREF="http://dccomics.com/" TARGET="_top">http://dccomics.com/</A>&#41;;
  or contact DC Comics directly in New York City. A trip to your local comic book
  store might be fun and productive, too. <BR> <BR>I know that his &#34;S&#34; symbol
  has evolved considerably since its debut. <BR> <BR>Good luck! Sounds like a fun
  project. <BR> <BR>It might be fun to start a thread discussing the impact of comic
  books &#40;and other vernacular, primitive and bourgois forms of illustration --
  and I use those terms respectfully in the artistic sense <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  and the like could all be on-topic.... <BR> <BR>David'
