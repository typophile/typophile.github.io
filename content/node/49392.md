  development conference and I\u2019m not sure how many hours I should expect to spend
  doing a conference agenda. Does anyone have any suggestions on how many hours to
  plan for? Also, I know that these things tend to be nightmarish jobs with lots of
  revisions and last minute additions and changes, so should I assume the worst case
  scenario when doing the pricing?"
