<p>It is not a cost of living issue&hellip; The price of FF Scala (single weight) is 40 euros also for Italy and other Euro-Zone countries. FontFont have a pricing policy based on the equation 1 Euro = 1 Dollar. In fact the euro is much stronger against the dollar (check <a href="http://www.xe.com">www.xe.com</a>) so European FontFont customer pay more for the same stuff ):
In my opinion their pricing policy is not fair.</p>
<p>What if a European customer buy online directly from FontFont US?</p>

<p>There is nothing unfair about selling a product for a different amount in different markets.
It is a marketing strategy &ndash; take it or leave it.</p>
<p>The fact is, fonts are underpriced in the US market, which is why FontFont has to cut its prices to participate there. This is not news, but has been happening since before e-commerce.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Of course it is. Otherwise known as standard of living. Companies set product prices for particular countries based on what the local conditions are. They charge what they think the market will bear.</p>
<p>For instance, Quark XPress wil cost you £700 in the UK, $1000 in the US.</p>
<p>Obviously, graphic designers make a lot more money in the UK than they do in the US!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Unfortunately FF fonts cannot be bought at MyFonts.com: &ldquo;MyFonts is not yet authorized to sell this font directly.&rdquo; I am also very disappointed by the FontShop pricing policy. I wanted to spent some money buying some FF fonts last year but I decided not to do so.</p>
<p>They answered my angry email: &ldquo;you are right that the price difference is quite a lot at the moment due to the US exchange rate to Euro. But I hope you understand that we cannot change our prices every time the exchange rates differ. So since the official currency in Europe is Euro, european customers are charged in Euro.&rdquo; But official currency in my country is not Euro&hellip;</p>
<p>I decided to ask my friend in the US to buy the fonts for me. FontShop allows this: &ldquo;&hellip;he is able to enter a &lsquo;licensee&rsquo; name which can differ from his own, resp. from the adress of the person/company who pays for the fonts. Then you are the official licensee of the fonts.&rdquo;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Software vendors (let&rsquo;s say Adobe) usually sell the same product (let&rsquo;s say Photoshop) at different prices in different countries but the software they sell in Italy, France, etc. is localized (translated in Italian, French). Instead fonts are a universal product; there is no need for traslation or other adaptments (we are not speaking of CE, turkish or baltic version). FontFont should sell their fonts from a unique web site at a unique price automatically translated in Euros, Dollars, etc.</p>
<p>I can confirm that cost of living is not a valid explication of FontFont pricing policy. Fonts cost the same (40 euros) in all European countries (UK, France, Italy, Greece, Albany, Bulgary, Poland, Ungary, Spain, etc.) Of course most European countries have a cost of living lower than US, where fonts sell for 40 dollars.</p>
<p>FontFont is a private firm: they can sell their fonts at whatever price they like. However, considering current exchange rates, they are not playing fair with European customers.</p>

<p>Ah, but what if you restrict it to people who actually
buy fonts? Maybe FontFont is leveraging the fact that
a font customer in Europe has more money than one

<p>Cost of living is an index related to the cost of goods and services in a certain country or city. It is not related to a particular category of people.</p>
<p>However I don&rsquo;t think FontFont pricing choices are so complex. They want keep it simple: 1 dollar = 1 euro &ndash;&gt; 40 dollars = 40 euros. Unfortunately international currency markets have a different opinion&hellip; and European customers are paying the price.</p>
<p>Of course if the dollar will get stronger against the euros in the next future American customers will be penalized.</p>
<p>My solution is more simple and fair: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> a unique price in dollar wordwide <!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Let the credit card companies convert the price in euros, pounds, yens, etc. according to exchange rates at the time of purchase.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Come on, a lot of the things being discussed here are not comparable. Pricing always reflects the market it&rsquo;s intended for.</p>
<p>In countries where a dollar equals a day&rsquo;s wages, commodities will have lower prices than in the US or Europe. Luxury items in these countries, though, are a different story. There is a small market for them, cost of support, marketing etc. is high, hence luxury goods will be more expensive!</p>
<p>As for the European market: it can not be compared to the USA (and Canada). It is not one market, in the sense that marketing has to be done in a lot of different languages, localisation (not only language but also ways of distribution) adds to cost, and so on. For one FontShop in Northern America there are SEVERAL in Europe!</p>
<p>The point can be made that fonts are more of a commodity in the States (&ldquo;5000 fonts for $50 !&quot;) and more of a luxury item in the rest of the world. And that&rsquo;s reflected in the pricing.</p>
