body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Foundries]] : Umbrella</strong>\r\n\r\nUmbrella is
  a compilation of exclusive and non-exclusive typefaces hand-picked from small foundries
  and independent designers around the world by [[Veer]]. The collection features
  designs by talented yet relatively unknown typographers, as well as typefaces by
  graphic designers better known for their other creative work. One of the strengths
  of Umbrella is Veer's ability to bring these deserving faces to a very wide audience,
  both through promotion in Veer catalogs and availability from the Veer web site.\r\n\r\n<a
