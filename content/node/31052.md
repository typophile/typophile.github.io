  body: "At the risk of being considered whiny (by someone other than hhp), be it
    noted that Saul Bass didn't do the lettering for his movie titles/posters -- he
    was the designer. Without seeing the roughs he gave to his lettering artists,
    it's hard to know how much credit to give him. Was it a scribble on a napkin,
    or a slick comp? At any rate, it could be misleading to call a derived font \"Hitchcock\"
    -- as recently emerged when a senior executive at Adobe thought that John Warnock
    had designed the font named after him.\r\n\r\nMovie: This is Goggle\r\nClient:

    just didn't have anything to do with anything in the book. Very useless You see.
    The book could be a masterpiece in every other aspect. Haven't finished it yet.
    \ \r\n\r\nAnd don't forget Spartacus. Art Goodman did excellent work there. That
    is what I have learnt from the book so far.\r\n\r\n\u0192"

  body: I worked with Saul Bass for 2 1/2 and also with Art Goodman and his assistant
    Dave Nagata. Dave Nagata was a master lettering artist and most of the comps were
    done by him while Art Goodman cracked the whip. When the comps were presented
    to Saul Bass and the actual font that matched the layout was chosen for the credits.
    I did the type on Mad, Mad, Mad, World. Main title were usually hand lettered.
    In the movie Man With the Golden Arm, Art Goodman's crippled arm was the model.
    Well, that's enough history for now.

    who was there. Can you tell us more about what influence Saul Bass had on the
    actual style of the lettering? Did he ask for a general feeling and leave the
    actual forms to Goodman and Nagata, or were his directions more specific and detailed?\r\n\r\nThe
