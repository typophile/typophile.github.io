  the other day, to find Arial on the gearknob.  I found the same usage on the E500.
  \ Both of these cars are top of the line luxury cars.\r\n\r\nI'm not a fan of Arial,
  but I'm even less tolerant when it is used instead of a typeface that formed part
  of an original design.  I feel so strongly that I sent letters explaining my concern
  to various Mercedes-Benz/Daimler-Chrysler offices and I haven't had a response yet.
  \ Do you think they care?\r\n\r\nLook at the comparison, correct Merc typeface left,
  right is A (as seen in these models.)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/merc5_5361.gif]"

      it is Arial on the gearknob.

  body: "You can't help but wonder how this kind of thing could happen...\r\nWorking
    as a desktop publisher, I've seen my share of wrong type usage & in 6 years I've
    only had one (!) housestyle instruction list sent along with the logo (this was
    for a big bank in Belgium that even has 2 different logo's; one to use if it ends
    up getting smaller than 2cm wide (if I remember correctly) & another to use otherwise).
    The instruction list for correct usage of the logo was over 3 pages, but even
    having used this logo practically daily, I've only seen it once. Another horrible
    example is -also from a (big) bank- who sent along an advertisement we had to
    remake with the wrong type. I was very tempted to correct this, but after adressing
    my boss, I still had to use the wrong logo. It was a pretty obvious wrong logo
    as well... In case of a bank that is often run on \"independent\" terms, I can
    somewhat understand how this kind of thing could happen, but as for your Mercedes
    example, I just don't see h\xF2w it could've happened. It's an unforgivable mistake!
    Get a BMW just in spite ;-)"

  body: Sadly, I don't think the corporation would care enough to take the letter
    seriously. Besides voicing your disgust, what else did you put in the letter?
    It probably doesn't matter anyway. Who would care besides fellow typophiles? Face
    it, we are a hopeless minority.

      I imagine they subcontract the gearbox manufacturing. The keyword in the last

        and didn''t notice that the subcontractor messed up.  Those terms shouldn''t
        apply for type on the vehicle itself.  In fact, I think those terms should
        not apply for anything.  Guess that''s the way it is: The end of the world
