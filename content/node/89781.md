    wordmark).\r\nOr maybe \u201CJapanese\u201D (in the sense of a more liberal take
    on the conventions of stroke widths in Latin letters)."

  body: It seems to work with its few neighbors, the variation in stem width goes
    along the slanted glyphs.

  body: Would it look more natural if you mirror the 'm'? There was a thread a while
    ago about accidentally mirrored/rotated characters ...

  body: "I've found that trying to read the mind of the person or\r\npeople who did
    this is surprisingly instructive; there are\r\na lot of twists to it (even though
    they might have in fact\r\nfollowed the main river, not exploring all the tributaries).\r\n\r\nWhy
    did they avoid the UC form in the first place?\r\nIt's not like they were avoiding
    diagonals, since\r\nthere are two diagonal \"A\"s there.\r\n\r\nOnce they decided
    to use a lc form, I guess making\r\nall the stems thick and implementing stoke
    contrast\r\nnormally (via thinner horizontals) made the \"m\"\r\ntoo wide/strong.\r\n\r\nOne
    way making [only] the rightmost stem thick is\r\nbetter distribution of color
    (since the right side\r\nof the \"O\" is heavy while the left side of the \"A\"\r\nis
    very light). I believe this is the logic behind it.\r\n\r\nBut if they had h-flipped
    the \"A\"s they would have:\r\n- better filled the \"TA\" gap.\r\n- had the option
    of making [only] the middle stem\r\nof the \"m\" thick, which is less jarring.\r\n\r\nThe
    \"A\" <em>must</em> have a thin left\r\ndiagonal and a thick right one? Bah.\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/48413419@N00/4091231975/in/set-72157627102851774\r\n\r\nMoral
    of the story: if you're going to break\r\nsome rules, break all the ones that
    don't work.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Hmm I find this rather clumsy looking. In my opinion the lc /m/ just looks
    odd with a heavier right even though it does create a more even distribution of
    color.\r\n\r\nI think they replaced one problem with another though."
