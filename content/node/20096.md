body: "Hi all,\r\nI'm looking for a font family like Eurostile.\r\n\r\nI know this
  has been covered before, but I'm wondering if anyone could suggest a font with this
  criteria:\r\n-multiple weights (including a light weight)\r\n-reasonably priced
  (not more than US$20-30 per weight; it's for an educational institution)\r\n\r\nMonoline
  and Azbuka come to mind, but they are quite expensive.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help.\r\n\r\n-Will"
