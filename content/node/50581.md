body: "Erich Alb has asked me to pass along his request for help in updating the English
  version of Adrian Frutiger's Wikipedia entry to match the German one. The former
  is missing a bibliography, and it seems important to complete the English version,
  especially since apparently a landmark book about Frutiger is a month away from
  publication.\r\n\r\nSo basically the \"Literatur (Auswahl)\" section from the German
  version* should be transferred to the English one** (presumably under \"Select bibliography\").
  Note: for the upcoming book (the last entry) the title and ISBN need to be changed
  to the English version's. Please consult the publisher's website for that information:\r\nhttp://www.springer.com/birkhauser?searchKey=easySearchKey&searchType=easy&visited=true&propagate=false&resultStart=1&resultCount=10&SGWID=1-40290-14-0-0&queryText=Frutiger&easySearchOption=all&go.x=18&go.y=10\r\n\r\n*

  feel free to email Erich with any questions,\r\ncomments or information: erich.alb
