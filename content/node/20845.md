  reading what you guys constructively said about Jerome Iveson and his creation.
  My logo already passed some tests and is established for some time now. But here
  i want to know what folks from the scene are thinking of it.\r\n\r\nSome more about

    since there is real possibility in pushing the ambiguity of letter combos like

  body: "Thanks Norbert for the link to the thread. I know that i wasn\xB4t the first
    to design a double meaning in a word. anyway, i think it is hard to force it to
    be like this. so in my case it was a natural evolution. after that i discovered
    this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambigram and was amazed on what has been done
    in this field so far."

  body: "Nice ambigram, those pesky tm symbols though, can you hide it in the opening
    of the g? I might take a look at the crotch of the KN, where it is a bit black
    and be a bit more extravagant with the S top stroke (and g bottom stroke), the
    UN don't seem to be the same width (but that could be my eyes). I get the impression
    that this would look best at an angle, especially when combined with the Rio type.
    Good work.\r\nTim\r\nps I found their website very unuser-friendly\r\n\r\n{edit}
    You might find this thread interesting as well\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/1516?from=50&comments_per_page=50"

  body: Perhaps you could clarify for us who your target audience is? What are the
    core values of the Sunking brand? I found the "official site" to be completely
    uninformative and very user-unfriendly.
