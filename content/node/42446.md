  body: "I don't remember Anselm being discussed much here or elsewhere. Has anyone
    used it? It is certainly an impressive type system in its coverage of sans and
    serif, multitude of weights, and Cyrillic and Greek scripts. It certainly seems
    to have aspirations of being a versatile workhorse.\r\n\r\nWhat do people think
    of its Baroque spirit and distinctive flavour, though? As much as I admire it,
    I do worry it might be a bit too flashy for \"serious\" work. I guess you can
    never accuse Franti\u0161ek \u0160torm of being boring..."

    small writeup that hasn't been published yet, which hits all the same points about
    the family that you just made. Overall I feel it's a very solid type system, but
    definitely should be saved for occasions when appropriate and probably not suitable
    for everyday work (although i don't think I would mind seeing it all the time). "

    use anywhere, and I'm itching to see examples. I know, it was only released last
    year, but hey, I'm impatient.\r\n\r\nIn my search for Anselm in use, I ran into
    <a href=\"http://www.hpmuseum.org/cgi-sys/cgiwrap/hpmuseum/archv017.cgi?read=128086\">this
    surreal thread</a> about the font choice for labels in an open calculator project.
    As far as I can tell, a group of aficionados are collaborating to build a calculator,
    code name Phoenix. One of them has suggested Anselm (sans, I believe) for the
    labels, and has even contacted Franta \u0160torm about extending the character
    set as needed for a scientific calculator, and got a positive response from him.\r\n\r\nWow,
    that's one use I had not thought of."

    only used in a very small size, thus details (and flaws) are hardly discernable,
    do we judge it worthwhile to pay 45 EUR instead of using characters from free
    fonts? There are even font editors out there, making it possible to create our
    own special characters that can't be found elsewhere.</cite>"

    Hudson</cite>\r\n<cite>...</cite>\r\n\r\nHow does that work? I'm hoping he recused
    himself when it came to the category that he was entered in and subsequently won.
    I've heard grumblings about conflict of interest in the past. Not that I'm saying
    that's the situation here, but I'm just curious how this gets played out."

  body: "Dan, yes, I did excuse myself from the non-Latin advisory panel this year,
    as did Fiona Ross. We wrote to Maxim Zhukov, organiser of the advisory panel,
    and to Matthew Carter, the chairman, prior to the competition to let them know
    that neither of us were able to participate because we were submitting a design.
    We recommended some possible replacements. Maxim later contacted me to see if
    I could recommend someone qualified to take a look at entries in two scripts for
    which he did not have advisors (neither script Devanagari), and I gave him some
    names. He was unable to find anyone to review one of the entries, and asked me
    some questions about the design, to which I gave what I believe were impartial
    answers regarding its fitness to the stated purpose of the design (low res devices).
    I believe, although I have not seen confirmation yet, that the design was the
    'OTS Ethiopic' from Monotype Imaging, for which the TDC are apparently awaiting
    artwork for the website.\r\n\r\nIt's unfortunate that the number of people with
    experience designing for certain scripts is small, but such scripts shouldn't
    be penalised during the judging due to lack of qualified advice."

    for Fondo de Cultura Econ\xF3mica. It had pros and cons: as a pre-paid job I had
    all the tranquility to focus my efforts on this project for a year or so (and
    I suppose that influenced the forms), but on the other hand it was, from the beginning,
    only for them.\r\n\r\nAnyway, your comments makes me keep going, since it\u2019s
    my first really finished work, because the other one, Espinosa \u2014a revival

    for the comment, James. That felt good. I just wanna say that actually it\u2019s
    not the first time that two Mexican are selected in the same year. It happened
    in 2006 \u2014Gabriel Mart\xEDnez Meave (yes, Presidencia\u2019s author) and Alejandro
    Lo Celso, although Lo Celso is certainly more Argentinian than Mexican\u2014,
    and in 2005 Leonardo V\xE1zquez won with Bunker, a display face. And Mart\xEDnez
    Meave again in 2001. Maybe the difference is that this year we had significant
