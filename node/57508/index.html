  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">How can I define a basic character set? Do you know where I can look for character sets made at foundries and stuff? I know that you don't need to have all characters to use a font, but it look kinda unprofessional when I put any character with the keyboard and the notdef glyph appears. So, I suppose I should base a basic character set in the Windows 1252 and Mac Roman. But there's also a couple of characters that are added by the Type 1 default character set (L with stroke, minus sign) and I have seen it in some fonts with basic character set that aren't Type 1 nor from Adobe. Is there a reason to still add them?
The MacRoman set seems to have changed at some point the code for the Omega (first the Ohm sign one, then the actual letter). I'm not sure if is need to add both. Many fonts adds the fi and fl ligatures in the private use area (I forgot the reason).
A more extended character set generally includes Windows 1252 with Mac Roman plus the whole <em>Latin Extended A</em> Unicode block, and sometimes a few from the <em>Latin Extended B</em>.
Looking the Windows and Mac encodings for other Latin languages, apart of Vietnamese, they include most of the <em>Latin Extended A</em> except for a few, so I wonder if these are necessary. Five are for compatibility with the ISO/IEC 6937 encoding (and the usage of them is somewhat debatable), some are deprecated characters used in Greenlandic like the Kra, some are for Maltese, some for Sami Languages, some for Esperanto and some for the Latin language. 
I suppose that adding the characters for Maltese is useful, since current keyboards have it.
The ones for Sami languages too, but there's also some characters from the extended B set used in Skolt Sami that also appears in the Sami keyboards, but I haven't seen much support for them. 
Esperanto is an artificial language and Latin is somewhat extinct, I don't know if they require a basic usage. Same with the deprecated Greenlandic Kra, which by now is on the same league of adding the letters with acute from Extended B for danish.
Without counting the usage of Vietnamese, which requires much more characters to work, the <em>I with tilde</em> seems a bit pointless. I think it was used in an old Greenlandic orthography but has not other current use.
There's also some languages that are almost supported with most of the extended sets, like Azeri (it need the Schwa, and seems that the keyboards have the seven roman number too) and Welsh (needs some W and Y with diacritics from the Latin Extended Aditional). Some language keyboards uses characters that aren't in the sets, like the Cruzeiro sign (no longer used) in Brazilian Portuguese (I don't remember other, but still).
I also want to know what else characters are useful. I know that most stuff depends of what languages or uses I should orient the font first, but I'm a bit doubtful of where to start.</div>

Sadly, OSes and applications still do not provide the Unicode and OpenType support that is long overdue.* (Which is particularly odd since those who have spec'ed the format and maneuvred foundries into re-manufacturing their entire font libraries as OpenType fonts did not simultaneously provide the infrastructure that would allow such fonts to work properly, i.e. as spec'ed.)
For applications that offer proper support, you would not need to make up your mind whether to add an <em>I with tilde</em> or an <em>a with circumflex above and dot below</em> or any other precomposed diacritic letter. Such applications would, on character level, decompose such letters into their 'bases' and 'marks'. And as long as your fonts contains the required encoded glyphs plus <em>mark</em> and <em>mkmk</em> features, the fonts would on the fly, on glyph level, compose the glyphs which represent the requested characters. What's more, these fonts would easily --&nbsp;with a pretty small glyph set&nbsp;-- immediately support exotic languages like Vietnamese, or Yoruba (many of whose diacritic letters are not considered in the Unicode charts),** or Cyrillic <em>[vowel] with acute</em> and <em>[vowel] with grave</em> combinations (which Unicode does not know of either).**
Then, it were pointless to even waste time thinking about whether to add <em>I with tilde</em> or any other precomposed diacritic letter. Add base and mark glyphs,*** and the rest is a game of combinations. No need to know about the particular requirements of this or that language.

As another observation, OSX allows creating <a href="http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2002/tn2056.html#SECTION4-_KEY__ELEMENT" target="_blank">custom keyboard layouts</a> in which a single key serves to input an entire string rather than a single character. So one could create layouts such that hitting the <em>u with dieresis</em> key would not input <em>U+00FC</em> but the string <em>U+0075 U+0308</em> -- thus allow one to deal with canonically decomposed text right from the start. But this, as said, would require that OSes and applications support Unicode and OpenType more fully than they do today.

* Which is related to my rant <a href="http://typophile.com/node/56918#comment-342051" target="_blank">over here</a>.
** And does not need to know because Unicode provides (de)composition rules.
*** Properly encoded so they are identified as characters.

Now I hope someone else will bring the discussion back on track.&nbsp;&nbsp;:)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Make sure you don't confuse characters with glyphs. Technically even a dumb font only  contains glyphs or outlines describing shapes, no more no less. Characters are functions of shapes that can coincide with single glyphs, multiple glyphs (in composition) or partial glyphs (in ligatures). When you ask for character sets, you are looking for functions, not outlines. Since you are referring to keystrokes - which as you probably realize do not generate glyphs. 

Of all the options you mentioned (like Windows 1252 and Mac Roman) none is really valid or relevant, with the exception of Unicode. In modern data technology, the latter is the only valid resource. 

The strong point of Unicode is that - in principle - it contains all characters in use as well as any character ever used. If you can prove a character is missing, there's a procedure to get it added.

The weak point of Unicode is, that it does not provide languguage-dependent orthographic subsets as part of an implementation guide for guys like you and me, who want to use Unicode selectively and not in bulk, but only for specific languages. 

The only way out is old-fashioned language research. Get at least one grammar for each language you want to support - or consult wikipedia for what it's worth - and figure out which letters each target language uses. Then look up the Unicode character for each letter, eliminate the doublets and finally decide how to represent the resulting characters: with a single glyph, broken up in multiple glyphs or merged with other glyphs. 

Then use smart font technology to get the relation between keystroke and graphic output correct.

There is no need to bother end users (typographers) at all. What I am saying is that software companies should finally start doing their job right so that type designers and foundries could make fonts according to the spec and be confident that they work as expected. Currently we are supposed to provide application bugfixes on font level. (Like sticking to the character=glyph equation -- despite the fact that one of the OpenType selling points was the character/glyph distinction.) And if we don't, we are told that our fonts are broken.

Enough off-topic talk. Thomas Milo's comment was much more of an answer to your question ...</div>

		<div class="commentbody">One thing to note, maybe echoing Karsten  -- most fonts lack the combining diacritics, the spacing modifiers, and the IPA phonetic characters (plus supplements). None of what Karsten is talking about will work without at least the combining diacritics. When you combine the need for them with the phonetic characters and spacing modifiers, there are few end-user (typesetting) work-arounds without glyphs for these characters.

Fore example, I'm currently involved with a book that samples a number of what are now called Native American languages. Most Native American languages are among the languages where the written form was derived by scholars, trying to capture the sound of the language. The one's I'm familiar with used the Latin alphabet, plus phonetic characters, plus diacriticals. It isn't that uncommon to see a phonetic character with a diacritic or two.

As for "character sets," It would be very nice to have the pieces to work with.

As poorly as the foundries have supported the Unicode ideal, Fontlab Studio too doesn't support <cite>mark</cite> and <cite>mkmk</cite> I believe. It has occurred to me more than once that it would be easier for me as an end user to make the needed glyphs for Charis -- "typographer's" small caps, old-style numbers, proper ligatures, and kerning -- than to make everything needed for such work in, say, Minion. Alas, I can't work with Charis very well in FontLab.

I think there will always be a need for the end user to be able to do some font work -- no designer can anticipate all needs and uses. The purist in me supports Karsten's reasonable rant, though in truth, as a typesetting company, we get a significant portion of our income because we can supplement & improve foundry offerings.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The task of defining a character set can be simple or orders of magnitude more complicated. It begins with defining who your customers are or who you perceive them to be. If you have designed a Latin/Roman typeface, you can begin with the major markets of Europe and the Americas and other European language countries. There are a series of template codepages and encodings available [[http://tiro.com/resources.html|here]], which you can use if you like. Of course these are start points, and you may decide you need a subset of what these provide or a superset. You may decide the naming scheme isn't to your liking etc. etc. But there are mechanisms in place to deal with that once you've figured them out.

Complications such as Charles is referring to illustrates that "making a character set" does not necessarily stop at a list of characters, their glyph shapes and their encoding(s). It can also involve secondary or tertiary mechanisms to get the text to display as desired. This could, as is the case with many North American languages, involve a large number of accented characters which do not exist within Unicode as pre-composed characters and need to be built up—either with mark positioning and/or with composition/decomposition lookups [ccmp]. For myself, I have prioritized development of the latter (specifically for Native languages) as I think it has slightly better application support then does [mark] (ccmp has support in the last few versions of InDesign, as well as Word, Firefox and others). While mark positioning does allow for arbitrary accent positioning and stacking, it is more complicated to implement in a comprehensive manner. [ccmp] and pre-composed glyphs allows for shape and positioning refinement as well as presenting the user with their characters in a glyph palette, which I suppose has some advantage. Neither can be discounted as a solution.

		<div class="commentbody">Hello Charles, when I speak of bases and marks, these are combining marks.
Though InDesign claims to support ccmp/mark/mkmk, this rather addresses an expert usage as you sketched here and in earlier posts: entering character plus combining mark character(s) and have the font do the composition. In contrast, I have 'normal' end users in mind who do know really know what 'combining marks' are and just type, on their local or maybe an adjusted keyboard, a 'complete' diacritic letter -- and the OS/application would internally and invisibly do the actual composition. Effectively, for users it would not make a different whether diacritic letters are precomposed or composed on the fly. But as said, there is more to it for an OS/application than just supporting ccmp/mark/mkmk, like canonical (de)composition, canonical mark ordering, etc.
The goal for a foundry of course is providing fonts that just work, rather than handing over a bunch of letter elements from which typographers would create the font they need. And I can tell that it is highly frustrating to <em>know</em> that setting up mark/mkmk mechanisms can be done in very comfortable way e.g. with FLS and the new AFDKO -- yet it is a couple of years too early for a font to expect this to work in the 'real world'.

Ross Mills: <cite>Neither can be discounted as a solution.</cite>

This is it. It is both/and rather than either/or (of ccmp and mark). And it should be design considerations (which shapes need optical corrections, which don't?) that dictate whether mark or ccmp would jump in, rather than compatibility considerations (which applications support this or that piece of the OT spec) as you indicate when you say,

<cite>For myself, I have prioritized development of the latter ... as I think it has slightly better application support then does [mark] ...</cite>

Personally, I would prefer to challenge application developers rather than comfort them. I would like to see results and am bored of being told no and how difficult implementing all this is etc. Unicode is established as a standard. OpenType is de facto a standard. There is nothing left to argue about.

Character/glyph set and layout behavior considerations are part and parcel. It does not make sense any more to think of character/glyph set as the basics, and layout behavior as a bonus.</div>
