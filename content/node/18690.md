  Are there names you''d expect young designers to be exposed to early on or do you
  think it''s more important to cultivate a style from individual influences? Who

    we like to call the [[triumvirate]]."

    early on</em>\r\n\r\nYes, not only type designers, but graphic designers, artists,
    musicians, writers, filmmakers, in short, anyone that can influence creativity
    and exploration.\r\n\r\n> <em>or do you think it\u2019s more important to cultivate
    a style from individual influences?</em>\r\n\r\nYoung designers should be warned
    <em><strong>NOT</strong></em> to cultivate a \"style\". If one's personal work
    or exploration evolves into themes or uniquely identifiable elements for purposes
    of development, that's learning. If one's sole intention is to create a \"style\",
    then it impedes exploration and learning since the goal is narcissistic.\r\n\r\n>
    <em>Who or what would appear on your personal canon?</em>\r\nI wish when I was
    in school I had been introduced the lesser known individuals (<a href=\"http://rmouron.club.fr/index7VA.html\"
    target=\"new\">Adolphe Jean-Marie Mouron</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ifa.de/a/a1/design/ea1bernh.htm\"
    target=\"new\">Lucian Bernhard</a>, <a href=\"http://www.carleton.edu/campus/library/admin/exhibits/Fine%20Printing/FP4.html\"
    target=\"new\">Bruce Rogers</a>), since the giants, saints and heroes are encountered
    inevitably.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NORDEXPRESS-1927.jpg]"

  body: "<em>Who or what would appear on your personal canon?</em>\r\n\r\nI think
    the whole point of a canon, in the sense that we talk about an artistic or literary
    canon, is that it is not personal. It includes the works or authors who are highly
    regarded by a community. This does mean of course that the canon changes over
    time as tastes change, with some works having greater esteem in some generations
    that others, and there are always edge-cases, works that slip in and out of the
    canon. There are also, of course, different communities, even within a broader
    culture, and hence different or even competing canons, but the idea of community
    remains central to the recognition of a canon. A canon is not a 'desert island'
    list: when you are alone on a desert island with your favourite typefaces, there
    is no canon, only the things you thought you liked when the ship went down. :)"

  body: "John's right, of course, though schools of art production and criticism tend
    quite rightly to reconstruct the canon for their own uses. One could thus create
    any number of type-design canons according to one's preferences: tradition vs
    novelty, high- vs low-register, all the usual things. But if one starts by saying
    that types are to be judged only according to (1) their readability in some large
    or small range of printing and reading conditions, and (2) by their ability to
    delight a large group of attentive readers over many years (per reader) as patterns
    on a page or screen, while preserving the detachment of a measure of impersonality,
    then the canon of roman and italic type designers for me goes: \r\nGriffo, Granjon,
    Guyot, Jannon, van den Keere, Christoffel van Dijck, Fleischman, Fournier le jeune,
    Besley, Monotype drawing office, Gill, van Krimpen, Dwiggins, Bloemsma, Majoor.
    Dishonourable but admiring mention goes to Peter Schoeffer the Younger, who was
    not very good as a type designer but who can be said to have invented the typographic
    display letter."

    than actual type and design. From my background most designers don't really know
    a lot about the people behind their favourite fonts and unless you take a type
    and typography course as part of your education the likelihood of being educated
    in that area is slim. \r\n\r\nWhile I learnt about serif versus sans serif; there
    was never mention on the history. I think young designers should at least be exposed
    to the names that give them the most common faces, such as Arial, Times, and the
    beloved Comic Sans, so as to not hate it. :) \r\n\r\nMaybe that wasn't the answer
    you're looking for; forgive me if I misinterpreted."
