  I have gone through the required process of various search engines and type foundries,
  without any luck. <BR> <BR>Photoshop insists that the font is called &#34;stem&#34;,
  but so far I have not been able to find a single font with this name, perhaps it
  has mistaken the name? <BR> <BR>Anyway here is a sample image: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/40774.gif"
  alt="echtzeit means realtime in german">'

  body: Hey are those serifs on the &#34;T&#34; and the top-right one on the &#34;I&#34;
    rounded or am I seeing things? Oh yeah and the top-left corner of the &#34;H&#34;
    seems rounded to me too.  <BR>I hope other people can see this as well... or else
    this is a definite proof that I need sleep.  <BR> <BR>Sorry no font ID yet.  <BR>

  body: Hej Magnus, <BR> <BR>I think this is due to the fact that the image was from
    an old version of Photoshop &#40;which had terrible font-previews in small resolutions&#41;.
    <BR>I am sorry that the resolution is so low, but there&#39;s not really anything
    I can do about it <BR> <BR>The corners are actually angular &#40;45
