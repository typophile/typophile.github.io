  would be some ultra compressed version of Trade Gothic? \r\n\r\nI am wondering because:\r\n\r\n1.
  It looks a lot like Trade Gothic (and probably is)\r\n2. Jason Santa Maria, who
  is noted as the designer of the books has expressed his love for Trade Gothic on
  several occasions online.\r\nOne is in Fontshop newsletter http://www.fontshop.com/blog/newsletters/june10a/indexEMAIL.html
  and a small part of one cover is shown, but that super condensed/compressed version
  shown is not available at Fontshop, as far as I can see.\r\n\r\nSo, if anyone knows:
  Where can I buy this font?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nSigurdur Armannsson at 64\xB0N"
