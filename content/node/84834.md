  seem to ID the word \"Center\". The closest that I found was Edwardian Script ITC,
  but the letter \"C\" isn't quite right. Any help would be greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nSteve\r\n\r\n

    ago with a clip art bundle, which means it might have another name and be a fine
    font. The Pen Tweaks version is wretched. To be have the joins look that smooth,
    you have to do a lot of work. '
