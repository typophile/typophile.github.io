  someone was developing. It was a \"chiseled\" Roman typeface similar to the featured
  Tisa and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ludwiguebele/mokka/|Mokka]]. If I remember
  correctly, the serifs were a little bit chunkier than the Mokka serifs (more like
  the Tisa serifs), and the counters had some angular elements, rather than the graceful
  curves of Tisa and Mokka.\r\n\r\nAnybody remember that? I'd like to revisit that
  post.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n"

    very much in line with what I'm after.
