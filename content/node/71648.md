  and I can't figure it out. So I though I'd come to the experts.\r\n\r\nKnowing me
  it is something that's in the Microsoft default font package and I'm and idiot for
  missing it, but I can't find it maybe you can.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

    are different. The 'o' is a very strange shape, and probably not how one would
    leave it if this were a font.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
