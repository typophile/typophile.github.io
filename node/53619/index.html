  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">The wonderful city of New Orleans is known for many things, like Mardi Gras and The French Quarter, but what about those typefaces? You know, all of those wonderful and often hand drawn works of art that provide our city with that rustic, vintage feel that we all know and love.

As I walked down Magazine St. I noticed that there truly is beauty all around us, and for the most part, it's right above our heads. The Typefaces that characterize this city are truly one of a kind. They vary from the bright and ornate all the way down to the dull and distressed. Who would have known the impact of type on a city like New Orleans would be so essential. Just picture all of the Signage in New Orleans being in Helvetica or Baskerville, how boring would that be?

Looking into the New Orleans Signage inspired me to look into the typefaces of other places, just to compare and contrast. Looking at surrounding cities like the Baton Rouge and Laplace, you really begin to notice the dramatic differences. The signage in these other places, as I have noticed, is all very manufactured. There doesn't appear to be nearly as much hand drawn type or the freshness of creativity, at all. 

Maybe there is something to be said about cities with intense culture. Perhaps the signage in places like Chicago, New York or Los Angeles are as powerful and essential as that in New Orleans. Until I find out for myself, I am going to believe that New Orleans is an incredibly magical place, unlike no other, signage and all!

Below are some of the interesting things that I found, these are my personal favorites from my adventure into the city. 


Enjoy!
