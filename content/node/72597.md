body: I'm helping a friend edit a paper which will be printed in Joanna MT. I don't
  have access to that font on my PC. It also seems like you have to pay money to get
  it. Is there a free font that is similar enough that I could use instead?

    have a cheaper version? Is it the same as Adobe's version? \r\n\r\nI kinda assumed
    there would be a free font out there that maybe looks different but has the same
    dimensions as Joanna. The publisher will be re-doing the layout in Joanna anyway.
    I just want to do some tables and see if we need to adjust any of the text in
    the tables. \r\n\r\nThanks for the help!"

    is one with <em>similar</em> dimensions, but how would you know without having
    access to Joanna? And how similar would be similar enough?\r\n\r\n<cite>Is it
    the same as Adobe's version?</cite>\r\n\r\nKind of, but: no. Ascender states that
    the digitized data\u2019s coypright is <cite>\xA9 1998 The Monotype Corporation,
    Inc.</cite> Adobe says about its <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/joanna/?refby=mfde\">Joanna
    MT</a> that the design owner is Monotype Imaging. A quick look into the characterset
    reveals that Adobe\u2019s version has several additional glyphs, like fi and fl
    ligatures, which are not present in Ascender\u2019s bargain version."

  body: "Florian, the part of the reason that Ascender's version is priced at $4.99
    is that they are licensing you a single license for the font. Most other font
    stores, like the Adobe website or Fonts.com, typically sell you a 5-seat license
    for the standard price you see on their websites. If you change the number of
    users on the Ascender website from 1 to 5, the price is multiplied by 5.\r\n\r\nStill,
    if you really only want to ever install a font on one computer at a time, it is
    a bargain!"

title: I need to help someone with layout but don't have access to "Joanna MT". What
  could I use to approximate?
