body: Hello, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m a little embarrassed that I can&#39;t identify this
  font; I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve seen it before. I&#39;m sorry I don&#39;t have a more
  extensive sample. Do you think the designer altered the font some, or does this
  font come with alternate cap E&#39;s &#40;one has inward angled terminals on the
  top and bottom bars&#41;? <BR> <BR>Thank you very much, <BR> <BR>Isaac<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/13901.jpg"
