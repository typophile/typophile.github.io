  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Dear Typophiles,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reading the book &lsquo;What is Typography?&rsquo; from David Jury, Rotovision.
It says on page 52: &lsquo;The sans-serif face was slightly more legible for the adult readers, but no measurable differences between the faces were observed with the children.&rsquo;
And then comes the author&rsquo;s comment: &lsquo;[The sans serif used was Gill Sans, the serifed face was Jenson. The slight preference recorded by adults for the serifed face could be explained simply by the fact that most of their reading will have been of serifed faces.]&rsquo;</p>
<p>Since I&rsquo;m not a native English speaker, I&rsquo;m a bit confused, for me there seems to be a contradiction between the two sentences. The first says the sans-serif is more legible, but the second sentence says the serif face was it preferred by adults. Or does the author means that &lsquo;if the serif face would have been preferred, that could be explained by the fact&hellip;, although the serif face was not preferred&rsquo;?</p>
<p>Is it a contradiction or am I missing something due to my English? If it&rsquo;s a contradiction, which statement is right in your opinion? As far as I know serif faces are a tiny bit more legible.</p>
<p>Thank you,
tebalazs</p>

<p>Otherwise the quoted first sentence stating that the sans-serif was a bit more legible for the adults was one of the (less important) conclusions of an 1969 research on typography for vision impaired people. I&rsquo;m sorry for not saying this earlier.</p>
<p>The author is also pointing out earlier that we have to be cautious and dubious accepting the results of testings on reading, e.g. due to uncommon circumstances and situation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a typographer and I don&rsquo;t know as much about type as you do, but I believe testings are taking us closer to understand the reading process. I hope there is agreement in the basic questions already, if not in all detail.</p>

<p>I certainly think so. It&rsquo;s just frustrating because so many of the studies are so poor and overall progress is very slow. Some of us are trying to help things along on the empirical testing front, but especially frustrating is that we face an &ldquo;internal&rdquo; battle as well - against designers (using the term loosely&hellip;) who consistently (and often covertly - which makes it much harder, and they know it) try to tear down any and all empiricism because it doesn&rsquo;t suit their personal philosophies.</p>

<p>Actually some typophiles are much more interested in the mechanism of reading in general, others more interested in learning about preference, or specifics about type design that influence readability. If you go outside our bubble, you find others whose interest starts from their work with the vision-impaired, or even from government-mandated standards that resulted from some of this dubious research. So I wouldn&rsquo;t call it agreement, so much, but it has certainly been stated repeatedly that research methods and materials need much more careful and informed design, before meaningful data on any of these areas can be had.</p>
<p>Since this dialog is heating up, and previously disconnected points of view are interacting, there&rsquo;s an improving outlook for meaningful testing, so we are making slow progress.</p>

<p>And it never will be. There is no controlled condition in this instance, that can produce accurate results across the board because all individual people are different. And with those differences come preferences, and with those preferences come perceptions, and with those perceptions come individual truths. If I prefer sans serif over serif, I will almost always &ldquo;perceive&rdquo; one to be more legible than the other regardless of whether or not its true. Find me an unbiased participant, in anything, anywhere&hellip;</p>

This pot of chili has been waiting to be made for years&hellip;the people are getting hungry.</p>
<p>In terms of determining reading legibilty tests, I DO think it is impossible. There are just too many factors to test, and too many rules to be defined. Until I see one solid agreed upon list of factors, controls and variables I&rsquo;m never going to believe it can be done.</p>
<p><em>Admitted - I prefer people who try to help others more

<p>You&rsquo;re a smart guy Hrant, but this speaks to your vast ignorance of what graphic design actually is.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Terry, the goal isn&rsquo;t one final answer we can toss at students to shut them up. It&rsquo;s puzzle pieces, like with archeology. Right now we have tiny fragments, badly collected and interpreted. If well-rounded groups start forming and developing better tests, observing and reporting meaningful results, we&rsquo;ll have much bigger pieces, in much better shape, that will help us immensely with the overall picture. There is a lot of potential for understanding reading and the functionality of type. Obviously there are a few people interested in it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>There is an old joke about a guy who lost his car keys one night. He had been searching and searching for them under this street lamp several yards away from his car for hours. A passerby noticed and asked the guy if he was sure his keys were under the streetlamp. The key searcher answered, &ldquo;No, I am not sure at all but the light is better here than over there by my car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have been researching readability for years following the paths set by those before us. Perhaps we are just searching in the most lighted location rather than in the darkness where perhaps the answer more likely lurks?</p>

Agreed. I am one of those people. When I first started reading about legibilty I thought it was possible. But as I read the debates and the numerous threads and bar-fights on Typophile about it&hellip;I find it to be a much less tangible goal.</p>
<p>But again, what <em>exactly</em> are we talking about studying? Because there are a lot of factors here to discuss in regards to reading and type. I always see the words &ldquo;readability&rdquo; or &ldquo;legibility&rdquo; that are endlessly debated without a clear definition of either term.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Terry, please don&rsquo;t think I believe graphic design is or should be devoid of expression. I&rsquo;ve said this sort of thing before: nothing made by a human can be devoid of expression, and nothing made for a human should be. The difference between Art and Design however is the all-important Intent, which causes expression to be the objective in the former, while merely a subliminal force in the latter; in the former, Expression Is; in the latter, Expression Happens.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>trying to ensure that there is true empiricism</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe not the case with you, but there are people who&rsquo;d like to ensure the opposite, because they&rsquo;re afraid of what people will end up thinking. It&rsquo;s not far-fetched to claim that many people don&rsquo;t want to change, not their habits, and certainly not their philosophy. Age has a lot to do with this; some of them have weathered their storms, and don&rsquo;t want any more storms. Others are not only not tired of storms, they can&rsquo;t wait for the next one to come and clean the writing on the walls (to rephrase Dire Straights). Heck, some even enjoy <cite>causing</cite> storms!  :-&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>why should we continue to abstract absolutes from it and thereby close

<p>Who said anything about absolutes? You arrive at conclusions, and hopefully you apply them, if never with total certainty. What else is new in life?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>what exactly are we talking about studying?</p>

<p>To me, at the highest level, how the instances of notan are turned into thought. More modestly, how the instances of notan are turned into language. Even more modestly, how the instances of notan are turned into words.</p>

<p>What frustrates me about reading research is that it seems, theoretically, stuck in the behavioralist past. Sure, it&rsquo;s hard to measure, but I&rsquo;d like to see more theories that reference more recent ideas like the quantum mechanics of consciousness, or perhaps this:</p>

<p>Any theorizing is better than nothing, but ideally theories come from
some hint of evidence, somewhere, not just out of the blue coolness.</p>
<p>BTW, Raph deserves gobs of credit for bunches of things, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure he got that particular idea from the Fourier transform guy - I forget his name, and Typophile&rsquo;s search doesn&rsquo;t work&hellip; Peter knows.</p>
