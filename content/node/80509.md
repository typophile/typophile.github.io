  i'm currently working on. :(\r\nThe brief was to find out about the history of a
  certain font.\r\n\r\nI was assigned to fred lambert's compacta.\r\n\r\nSearched
  high and low on google and the library for him on the related font, but efforts
  were in vain.\r\n\r\nI came across this book by the name of \"American type design
  and designers\" as reference according to some helpful source.\r\nOnly after reading
  more, i came to realize there's very little info about him.\r\n\r\nIt's only about
  letraset corporation set-up and compacta being the company's 1st letraset font to
  be created.\r\n\r\nI can't figure these questions as the answers have to be long,
  not some one or two lines.\r\n\r\n(1)Reason behind the font\r\n(2)Reason behind
  the font\u2019s name\r\n(3)History of the font\r\n\r\nCan fellow type fans please
  do me a favor by helping me out? Really appreciate it! :)"

    bet that if you take the info you found from different sources, glue them together,
    and expand the parts that are only referenced or hinted, you will end up with
    quite some text.\r\nIf all you\u2019re willing to do is copy&paste, you\u2019re
    out of luck.\r\n\r\n<cite>(2)Reason behind the font\u2019s name</cite>\r\nWell,
    I think this one you can figure out yourself! ;-)"

    looks like he's one of those many type designers there isn't a lot of information
    on.\r\n\r\nFor me, and for many British men of a certain age, Compacta will always
    be the Airfix typeface.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/airfix_4757.jpg]"
