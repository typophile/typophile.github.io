body: I'm looking for (and loving!) a font called "Boomer." Does anyone know if it
  is available to purchase or was it created as a custom font for several publications?
  If it's not available to purchase, can anyone suggest another font that is very
  close to Boomer? thanks!

  body: Ahh <a href="http://www.typophile.com/node/17002">I see now</a> that it is
    a custom typeface by the Font Bureau and not available for licensing right now.
    There are several alternatives in that thread. You might also like <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/itc/itc_officina_pro_complete_vp/">ITC

  body: Thanks for your suggestions. Boomer is  rounder, especially on the "Os"...
    and I am interested in Boomer without the serif. Where do you see that it is not
    available for licensing in the earlier blog? are you still interested in seeing
    a sample?

  body: "Quoting Christian Schwartz:\r\n\r\nThis is indeed a custom face from FB,
    drawn by Cyrus Highsmith. It\u2019s a slab version of their sans, which was called
    <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/font_bureau/antenna_normal/\">Antenna</a>
    last time I checked (which is a great name - i hope it sticks). The sans is also
    used by Poz, Popular Mechanics, and another publication or two, and has the extensive
    range of weights and widths one would expect from Font Bureau, but as far as I
    know the slab is exclusive to AARP, at least for the time being."

  body: "I appreciate your feedback. Antenna has a lot of differences (Antenna lowercase
    \"l\" is curved at the bottom, not in Boomer for instance. Also the Os (Q,C, G.
    etc.) in Antenna are not round, they are a square-round (hard to describe, but
    they are weird and i really don't like them!). Antenna feels extended, although
    it may just be that O shape. \r\n\r\nAny other suggestions?"

    and <a href=http://ms-studio.com/FontSales/proximanova.html>Proxima Nova</a> came
    to mind. Or perhaps <a href=http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=unit&x=33&y=4>FF
