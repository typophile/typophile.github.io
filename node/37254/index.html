  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m frantically trying to design something for our University LGB (Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual) Society. It will be aimed at potential members and used on a banner, in business cards, leaflets, posters and on our website. It needs to give a young, relaxed, friendly, modern and not stereotypical impression and yet still try and get across who we are.</p>
<p>Attached is the logo we currently have and I&rsquo;m a bit unsure about it - mainly because the font I have tried there really doesn&rsquo;t fit. I&rsquo;m not too sure about the logo as a whole but would really appreciate any suggestions at all and any suggestions for a more suitable font.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!
Rich</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>well, the rainbow says &ldquo;gay&rdquo;. The logo as a whole has a undefined german eco-feel to it – &ldquo;Bundesökoverein Natürlich Gaia&rdquo; or something like that. How about black instead of dark purple? Also, is it possible ti change the sizes of the two parts of the name? Now it doesn&rsquo;t look like a name to me, more like an abbreviation. If you get my point.</p>
<p>What did you want to achieve with this typeface? Bauhaus is quite dated.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The logo was produced by someone last year so I&rsquo;m just trying to update it/improve on it in any way I can really. The rest of the committee seem to want to keep it so I&rsquo;m a little constrained to just modifying this logo. Not sure if that is a good or bad thing really..</p>
<p>I would like to to say gay but hopefully break away from the rainbow and stereotype attached - making it more &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a student who happens to be gay&rdquo;. I will have a try with black, the purple was chosen as its the university colour so probably relates it to the uni a bit. Yep I can change the font size - I&rsquo;m not sure what you&rsquo;re suggesting exactly though :(</p>
<p>The font that is there was purely the one that I had there at the time - as you say its a bit dated and I don&rsquo;t think it fits really. So something that firstly fits in with the style of the logo would be a start. I wanted to go for something young, relaxed, &ldquo;fun&rdquo;/student. I really liked the channel4 branding here <a href="http://www.fontsmith.com/custom.php?id=488">http://www.fontsmith.com/custom.php?id=488</a></p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Overall I think it feels rather dated and also a bit childish, with the bright rainbow colors and the bold lines. First I would try to find a sharper and contemporary font, probably sans serif but not too bold and not too rounded. It&rsquo;s probably good too use the rainbow, but I would make it less frivolous, and the lines more straight. It would indeed also be better to use black instead of the purple that is now dominant. Maybe it seems ironic but I would go for a slightly less &lsquo;gay&rsquo; look overall&hellip; you don&rsquo;t want to overstereotype, and I guess people could be put off if it&rsquo;s too over the top.</p>
