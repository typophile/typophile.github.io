    you in the canon, so to speak, which can be far more beneficial to you than a
    licensing fee.\r\n\r\nAs for fonts... no.  Your poster is a finished work that
    you'll probably be sending to him with the fonts outlined or otherwise rasterized,
    so licensing isn't a concern."

    still a little fuzzy on the licensing requirements. \r\n\r\nGuifa: Yes, the fonts
    are outlined in the file I'll submit; but all the work I sell (publish or print)
    myself consists of outlined fonts when I submit the final file. Obviously I pay
    to license the fonts. Is that all a designer needs to do to avoid paying a license
    - rasterize or outline? That seems unethical and wrong to me. \r\n\r\nI always
    make clients license the fonts I use, even if it's for a newspaper ad and they'll
    never use the font again. So why wouldn't this author be required to license the
    fonts? Can somebody clarify?"

    don't have a greedy bone in my body, and my bank account proves it.\r\n\r\nI require
    clients pay for a font (once!) because THEY are the one printing the work, not
    me. I'm simply designing for them, and they're not paying ME for the font, they're
    paying the type designer directly. If I were an in-house designer, the company
    would buy the font, right?\r\n\r\nAs far as the book is concerned, I had no idea
    how to handle it. I simply didn't want to be taken advantage of. I've had my work
    stolen so often that it's extremely rare to have somebody ask permission beforehand.
    The book is on a very hot, historic topic and I expect it will sell very well.
    Seriously well, especially with an October release. \r\n\r\nIt doesn't seem right
    that a publisher doesn't pay anything to the artists whose art <strong>is</strong>
    the book. The author says it's a 200 page book with 186 posters, very minimal
    writing. 186 artists, and the author and the publisher are the only people that
    profit?"

    (jumped to the conclusion:) that this would be an academic endeavour with your
    poster as an example, to illustrate a point. That would be fair use and an acknowledgement
    of your authorship would be enough. If the bulk of the book are these images that's
    a different ball game, IMO. Do you know what the other posters are?"

    that's why Wall Street brokers have surreptitiously gotten into publishing art
    books. (Did I mention that I can get you a good deal on ocean-front property in
    Arizona?)\r\n\r\nThere is an old saying about publishing -- it is a good way to
    make a small fortune, as long as you start with a large one. And you can achieve
    this much faster with art books.\r\n\r\nAs far as the popularity of poster work
    goes, Tom Eckersley got an OBE for his poster work during World War II. Fame,
    but no fortune.\r\n\r\nAsk yourself this: would the author have a viable book
    without your poster? With only 187 images -- or with 188, using one other than
    yours?\r\n\r\nI do wish you good luck, but check out the realities of book publishing
    before making a demand for a fee for including your work in a book."

  body: "\x7FIf it's a 186 poster book with 200 pages, there could easily be a solid
    30-60 pages of writing, which could indeed be a pretty serious bit of writing.\r\n\r\nWhile
    when I write an academic work on literature I can easily reference multiple works
    citing only the most relevant part since presumably any major library at a research
    university will have them or can quickly retrieve them with ILL, pieces on visual
    works (especially posters which can be have very short public lives and may not
    otherwise be published in any other place),  illustrations are a necessity and
    may not be available in published form anywhere.\r\n\r\nI'd discuss the work some
    with the author, to see precisely how he wants to go about the work.  If it's
    a mere collection, then you'll likely want to ask for compensation, but (I think
    I lean more to this) if it's a substantial work that requires illustrations to
    be meaningful, I don't think it's necessary.  Actually, just ask him to see a
    draft copy of the chapter he's using your book and maybe the introduction too.
    \ Contractual obligations with the publisher aside, he'll probably let you take
    a look, and from what you read you can decide how to proceed.  Liberal arts publishing,
    at least from my experience in the literature world, isn't quite as secretive
    as, say, science publishing.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea tan fina

  body: "Alaskan, maybe I can cite a couple of examples from the type community...
    First example: Tamye Riggs recently posted a request here (and <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=35678162623\">elsewhere</a>)
    for work using certain typefaces considered to be classic, and <a href=\"http://www.rotovision.com/description.asp?isbn=978-2-88893-043-3\">the
    book is due to be published in June</a>. The other example: When Leslie Cabarga
    was writing his <a href=\"http://www.lesliecabarga.com/products/logo-font-and-lettering-bible\"><em>Logo,
    Font and Lettering Bible</em></a>, he sent out requests to designers he knew,
    and he got many illustrations for his book this way. Everyone received credit,
    and got some exposure in exchange. A win-win situation for all involved, I suppose.\r\n\r\nI
    think that this author has gone about things the right way -- he's written you
    in advance to request your permission to use your work. Of course, you don't know
    this professor the way you might know Tamye or Leslie, but you could find out
    if he's published other books -- that might give you some reassurance as to his
    intentions. Or, as Matthew suggests, ask him if you can see a draft, a chapter,
    etc."

    The book is strictly a collection; several posters will fold out into full-sized
    posters, and several gate folds. It's an \"oversized deluxe\" edition, and the
    only writing is an intro page and an index of artists with mini-bios at the end.
    \r\n\r\nThis is not an educational book about poster design techniques at all
    -- it's definitely a coffee table book. If it were \"The History of Posters\"
    I'd have jumped at the chance without a second thought. This book is a gift item,
    not a collegiate text. I guess I should have made that clear from the start of
    the thread, huh? \r\n\r\nSo, does that change how I should proceed? I still haven't
    given him an answer, I've just been asking questions. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

    a deal breaker. \r\n\r\nI've read up on his bio, and I have no reason to think
    he's inclined to pull the wool over my eyes. I found stuff online that he's written
    about professional ethics and artist survival. So, I decided to simply trust he's
    not likely to profiteer off the work of graphic artists. If there is no cash forthcoming

    work, then it will be priced in the $50 to $100 range. If there are 186 contributions,

    186 x 100 = $18,600, a lot more than most publishers will pay for permissions.\r\n\r\nAnd
    if you have the free copy, then it becomes a great part of your portfolio (although
