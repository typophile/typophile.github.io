    to work with... and then followed up ferociously. I never dropped off portfolios,
    demanding face to face time. I never dealt with HR people. Generally I was nuisance,
    but I did get a position this way.\r\n\r\nThen I got out of this manic period,
    drank less coffee, and got a headhunter. \r\n\r\nOh, and please: stationery, not
    stationary."

  body: This might seem obvious, but the easiest way for me has been to find things
    through friends, or friends of friends. Word of mouth and personal contacts are
    way less difficult than cold-calling and pushing yourself on people, especially
    when you are starting out in your career. It might not land you your dream-job
    immediately, but it will open you up to things and get your foot in the door here
    in NYC. The great thing about being in New York is that someone will always need
    your help, you just have to be able to find those people, and do a good job for
    them. Worked for me...

    to know people.\r\n\r\nIt was a long time ago, but I got my first job in NYC by
    taking a night course at SVA and getting some freelance work from one of the other
    fellows in the class.\r\n\r\n"
