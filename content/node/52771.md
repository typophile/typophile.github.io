  underscores in the name of font families? Are there any charcaters that shouldn't
  be used in the name of fonts?\r\n\r\nEg.\r\n\r\nMy_Font "

  body: "http://www.typophile.com/node/51100\r\n\r\nAlso, underscores in font names
    look ugly and to some users, confusing. Some users may not notice them and assume
    that they are spaces or something of that kind. \r\n\r\nJust use spaces and plain
    English letters, nothing else. \r\n\r\nA."
