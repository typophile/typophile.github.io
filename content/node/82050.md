body: I have a long text document where I'd like to change few characters to a string
  of text. For example change "a" to "/a.alt" and "t" to "/t.alt". To do this properly,
  I need to execute the find&replace commands at once. How to do it in a text editor?
  Can it be done with greps? If so, could you help me with the commands? Is there
  any MAC text editors that can do multiple f&r commands automatically? I know there
  are workarounds for this in Fontlab and such, but I really need to do this in a
  text editor.

    t.alt yields a few <strong>a.alt.alt</strong> artifacts. I'm not sure that, even
    if there is such a thing, a simultaneous search and replace function would prevent
    this outcome. However, if you replace all your as and ts with different characters--say,
    dagger and daggerdbl--a subsequent search of \u2020 and replace with a.alt would
    avert the problem..."

  body: "You need to state what text editor you are using. There is no such thing
    as \"GREP\" :-) There is a sort of basic functionality, but details in semantics
    and supported functionality differs wildly among GREP-aware editors.\r\n\r\nUsing
    InDesign's GREP syntax, something like this ought to work: search for\r\n\r\n<code>\\b([at])\\b</code>\r\n\r\nand
    replace with\r\n\r\n<code>$1.alt</code>\r\n\r\n-- note this will only change the
    two examples you provided, and \"at the same time\" as well. Somehow I don't think
    there is any text editor that allows you to specify a host of strings to change
    <em>at the same time</em> ..."

    of strings</em> can be specified by a regular expression, it seems to me that
    [[http://www.anybrowser.org/bbedit/grep.shtml|BBEdit GREP]] can do it (I had almost
    forgotten BBEdit ever existed, this question just reminded me).\r\n\r\n"

  body: "On the Mac, I use the line command <code>sed</code>. For instance, if the
    file <code>test</code> contains \r\n<code>\r\nccommaaccent\r\ngcommaaccent\r\nkcommaaccent\r\nscommaaccent\r\ntcommaaccent\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nthen
    here is how one can match all those \"one letter\" followed by a commaaccent and
    generate a sub (this is a trace of execution, i.e. a copy-paste of what I get
    on in my shell window):\r\n<code>\r\n586 % sed 's/\\(.commaaccent\\)/sub \\1 by
    \\1.alt ;/' test\r\nsub ccommaaccent by ccommaaccent.alt ;\r\nsub gcommaaccent
    by gcommaaccent.alt ;\r\nsub kcommaaccent by kcommaaccent.alt ;\r\nsub scommaaccent
    by scommaaccent.alt ;\r\nsub tcommaaccent by tcommaaccent.alt ;\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nAlso,
    sed allows scripting. Very handy when many substitutions are to be done."

  body: "Given an input file <code>in.txt</code> containing \"a t a t\", following
    Theunis' idea (with the <code>sed</code> syntax).\r\n\r\n<code> sed 's/\\([at]\\)/\\1.alt/g'
    in.txt</code>\r\n\r\ngives the output <code>a.alt t.alt a.alt t.alt</code>; here
    there is just one rule. If there is more than one substitution rule, it gets more
    tricky; substitutions apply sequentially. Again with the <code>sed</code> syntax,
    if the letters are alone on their line (in this example blanks are not allowed)
    then \r\n\r\n<code> sed 's/^a$/a.alt/; s/^t$/t.alt/' in2.txt</code> \r\n\r\nwill
    do the job: for the substitution to apply, the rules for a and t specify that
    a and t must be at the beginning (^) and end ($) of line so that, if the input
    file <code>in2.txt</code> is\r\n\r\n<code>a\r\nt</code>\r\n\r\nthe output will
    be\r\n\r\n<code>a.alt\r\nt.alt</code>\r\n\r\n"

    few bucks if there is one that does the job. I found out that in Windows there
    is a program called wReplace that does this exact thing. \r\n\r\nMichel: Well
    this is excellent! \r\n\r\nsed 's/\\([at]\\)/\\1.alt/g' in.txt\r\n\r\nThis command
    seems promising. There are no separate characters I need to replace, they are
    in long text with complete words, no linebreaks or anything like that. Only thing
    is that I can't get the slash to work! The output must be: /a.alt\r\n\r\n"
