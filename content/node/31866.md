  body: "Thanks, Linda. I had stumbled upon his website a while back; what I didn't
    know was that this was the same author of <a href=\"http://www.will-harris.com/store-h/typestyle.html\"
    target=\"_blank\">TypeStyle: How to Choose & Use Type on a Personal Computer</a>.\r\n\r\nI
    hate to get nitpicky, but his website doesn't seem to be a companion to that book,
    whereas the ones listed above are meant as an online complement, if you will,
    to each book."

    spent much time looking at the site (I do have the book), and what struck me about
    both of them now is that they're kind of, um, dated: I know I look at type differently
    now that I did 15-20 years ago (the book came out in 1990), but the site still
    seems stuck in that era.  \r\n\r\nJust one woman's opinion....  ;-)"
