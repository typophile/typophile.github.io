  body: "Let's rattle off all the humanist sans that are somewhat close to Scala Sans:\r\n\r\nGill
    Sans \r\nSyntax\r\nToday\r\nBliss\r\nMundo\r\nAgenda\r\nCharlotte\r\nLegato\r\nFreight
    Sans\r\nKievit\r\n\r\netc..... I've excluded any that really aren't close, like
    Cronos, Frutiger, Formata, and Chianti. \r\n\r\nYour problem isn't that you need
    an alternative, it's that you need a budget. If they don't want to pay, you could:\r\n\r\n
    - Buy yourself the best Humanist Sans family for your general needs, and use that,
    since it will have to be close enough\r\n\r\n - Buy Scala Sans for yourself and
    use it for this job, and every other job you can get away with it since it's so
    trendy and desirable\r\n\r\n - institute a policy that you will always keep a
    healthy budget for type in future jobs as part of your expenses"
