  today and he thinks I've got a realistic chance of getting on the MA at RCA \"MA
  Communication Art and Design\" course.\r\n\r\nWhat I want to know is, what is the
  real 'benefit' of continuing my education at an institute such as this? I realize
  that many many talented designers come from places such as this, I\u2019m just not
  so sure if I need an extra, 2 years of education to refine myself as a designer.\r\n\r\nI'm
  not from a 'wealthy' background and I realise the implications of taking on such
  a course. It will cost a lot of money. Again, is it worth it?\r\n\r\nI'm just weighing
  up the pro's and con's. I have to submit a proposal pretty soon on why I would like
  to continue my education at the RCA. I reckon I\u2019ll have a go, and see what
  happens. It\u2019s pretty competitive I think so I\u2019d be lucky to get in, if
  I don't then its not the end of the world.\r\n\r\nAny advice is really welcome.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nRob."

  body: I recently elected to get a real design job instead of going to grad school.
    I made decision because I felt there was more for me to learn in the real world
    than in more school. I would really like to get a masters in the future but, at
    the time, I felt like I needed to balance all of the theory and idealism of school
    with some experience and reality. It's been a great decision so far, I managed
    to get a really good job where I feel constantly challenged and have been learned
    a ton. Anyway, thats my story. I hope you come to a decision that is best for
    you. If you can't make up your mind, apply anyway and decide later. Good luck.

  body: "Yes, I think the apply now and decide later is a good choice.\r\n\r\nI need
    to think things over. They don't have open days till Jan which is after the submission
    deadline strangely. So i'll visit, and keep collecting information until then
    I think.\r\n\r\nThanks for that jackson, very helpful indeed.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nRob."

  body: If you don't really want it, maybe you shouldn't apply. You can always work
    for a few years, and then go back to school later. Many graduate schools even
    encourage this.
