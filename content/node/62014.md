    you aren\u2019t brave enough to change your default\u201D far more than Myriad
    does (or ever will).\r\n\r\nMyriad is a lovely typeface. The fact that there are
    so many weights gives it a huge advantage over many other families, and the condensed
    versions are very readable, which makes it a good choice for things like manuals
    when the condensed versions of Helvetica, Univers, and New Gothic aren't doing
    it for you. But yeah, due to its popularity in the mid 90s, it can look a little
    dull and dated. But if it works, it works."

  body: "I wouldn't say there's anything wrong with you. I think people fall back
    to Myriad when they want readers to completely ignore their type choice. Myriad
    whispers \"ignore me\" at least at text sizes. Makes it great for disclaimers
    and mobile phone contract agreements. See... http://store.creativepro.com/article/dot-font-neutral-sans-

  body: "It seems to me that Myriad is far more visible today than it was in the '90s.
    Maybe I'm just noticing it more, but I see it <em>everywhere</em> these days.\r\n\r\nI
    miss multiple masters. Myriad is an excellent design of course, but the fact that
    one could originally \"dial up\" whatever weight and width they needed was a tremendous
    bonus."

  body: "wow, thanks for all the responses!\r\n\r\ni guess myriad isn't too bad after
    all, hahah.\r\n\r\njonathan - that is one thing I have noticed with the different
    weights.. they all seem to work well, and condensing doesn't prohibit legibility.\r\n\r\nsii
    - that was a really good article. thanks for sharing!\r\n\r\nchristopher - i agree.
    after seeing sii's article, I practically smacked myself in the forehead.\r\n\r\n\r\non
    a side note:\r\nthere is a type that I would say is very close to myriad that
    I am continually seeing in the younger demographic aimed ads and print. i would
    say its a mixture of helvetica, myriad, futura and arial. what really gives it
    away is the capital R. the closest thing I've found to it is called SF Old Republic
    from dafont.com ( http://www.dafont.com/sf-old-republic.font ), but it's not exactly
    it. is there a more \"commercial\" version of this out there?\r\n\r\nany ideas
    would be a tremendous help. i havent had much success with the font finders. :(\r\n\r\n"
