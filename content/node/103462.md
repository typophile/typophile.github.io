  disturbing to find out something like this, but then I'm now feeling a little empathy
  for this guy, for the reason he is young (judging by his photo and by his profile
  description). But this is not the way to build your design career or to go in public
  without having any responsibility for your acts.\r\n\r\nTo not duplicate what we
  wrote, feel free to check it directly on our website:\r\n\r\n[[http://www.tourdefonts.com/rip-off-of-oblik-bold/]]\r\n\r\nLet
  this be an lesson, in educational purpose, to all designers who might have doubts
  to do such things to any existing, available, on the market or off the market, with
  ownership design of any kind!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nDusan"

    So is the font no longer available for download?\r\n\r\n2) Is your plan simply
    to \"out\" the violation but take no direct action?\r\n\r\nFYI: http://typesnitch.com/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "1) Behance page for that project is no more available. I will do more research,
    but might be that his font is uploaded on i.e. Mediafire, Rapidshare... kind of
    services. But it's not available from Behance any more. I found those images on
    Pinterest and few other blogs.\r\n\r\n2) I couldn't find his direct contact informations,
    so I had to create account on Behance and to write him message using their contact
    form. I don't believe he'll answer on that and I have small hopes that I will
    find his contact (phone, email, address...). I'm still under impression of everything,
    probably not thinking reasonable at the moment. What could I do at this situation?
    (I write in first person even designer of \"Oblik\" is my father, but I try to
    keep all communications).\r\n\r\n3) I know about http://typesnitch.com/, we will
    have to consider it seriously now, cause honestly this is something I would never
    expect to happened to us. We are very small and not so specially popular nor on
    market nor in typographic community, but I guess it can happened to anyone.\r\n\r\nI
    just can't get it, what does it takes for somebody to do such thing?\r\n\r\nBTW,
    who is behind TypeSnitch service?"
