  body: I&#39;ve done quite a lot on EBay. I think over 100 purchases. <BR> <BR>The
    only time I&#39;ve had serious problems were with incredibly cheap audio CD collections,
    which turned out to be pirated. That was a case where the folks were selling a
    whole ton of copies, not just one. <BR> <BR>The more money they stand to make
    &#40;either from one sale or an identical batch&#41;, the more you should check
    the seller&#39;s credentials. You can tell how long they&#39;ve been doing this,
    and their percentage of happy customers, by clicking on their ratings in the top
    right. <BR> <BR>In your case, the seller has been doing this a really long time,
    has thousands of satisfied customers, and a 480:1:1 ratio of positive feedback
    to neutrals and negatives. So they&#39;ve got a great track record. No reason
    to not trust them, I&#39;d say. <BR> <BR>T

  body: I buy a lot on eBay, mainly from the antiquarian book section. I&#39;ve found
    some good deals, but I&#39;ve also bid a bit too much on occasion, but that&#39;s
    my own fault. It is easy to get carried away. I&#39;ve never had any problem with
    sellers, and second Tom&#39;s advice re. feedback credentials. <BR> <BR>Beware
    of people who come in at the last second and outbid you. This happens more and
    more often and is incredibly annoying.

    and the system auto-bids for you as needed?</i> <BR> <BR>Sort of. Your maximum
    bid remains the hidden highest bid until someone outbids you. But this means that
    someone can come in the last few seconds with a significantly higher bid -- high
    enough to pretty much guarantee that they&#39;ll get it -- and get the item for
    only a little more than your maximum bid.

    <BR>If an auction has a time limit on it, like eBay, I don&#39;t see any point
    in a fixed budget: you&#39;ll lose almost every time. And if you put in a very
    high bid all the time, you&#39;ll usually end up paying too much all the time.
    So the trick is to make a series of incremental bids responsive to what other
    people are doing, not just make one bid and hope for the best. The frustration
    comes when your last bid is for $500 and someone comes along five seconds before
    the auction ends and gets the item for $500.50.'

    every time <BR>I think a fixed budget is a necessity, or you&#39;ll end up paying
    too much a lot of the time. There must be an amount over which an item becomes
    a poor deal. Paying over the odds for an item isn&#39;t &#39;winning&#39;, its
    just another form of losing. <BR>'

  body: But if your fixed budget for an item is $100, the nature of the eBay mechanism
    -- time limit and incremental increases -- makes it likely that you will see the
    item go to someone else for only a little more than that. A bidder coming in in
    the last few seconds knows there is very little chance of having to pay his maximum
    bid, so can gamble that the current maximum bid is not much more more than what
    is showing. It is necessary to tailor one&#39;s bidding strategy to the nature
    of the auction. At a live auction, when there is no time limit and I can see the
    other bidders, I have a totally different approach. <BR> <BR>Of course I have
    an actual budget in mind, which correlates to what I think the item is worth &#40;when
    I&#39;ve overpaid for an item, it is because I&#39;ve overestimated its value&#41;,
    but this budget is certainly variable enough to take into account an extra 50
    cents or whatever the incremental increase set by the seller is. I don&#39;t mind
    losing an item that goes well beyond what I am willing to pay, but it is frustrating
    to see items getting away for small change.

  body: I&#39;ve recently entered the seller&#39;s game on eBay and have done some
    buying here and there. This is what I think I know about it.  <BR> <BR>Like chess
    there are a number of different game strategies for bidding on eBay. Beginning,
    middle, ending. <BR> <BR>A friend of mine has some kind of software that can be
    keyed for the end game. It will activate a bid within seconds of the auction ending.
    He doesn&#39;t even have to be there, the software does the bidding for him. A
    very high bid here will secure the item at only a little more than the previous
    bid. I think a lot of folks are using stuff like this. Only real safeguard against
    this is to place a middle to late bid for what the item is actually worth on the
    open market, lowest value will often do. You will rarely lose this way and will
    still get it cheaper. Just not as cheap as in your dreams. <BR> <BR>Sometimes
    you might have to bid early to detect if there is a reserve or bid early to middle
    to detect if the hidden high bid is beyond what you realistically want to pay,
    and you don&#39;t really want to spend an awful lot of time dealing with the particular
    auction. Or if you can&#39;t be there when the auction ends. Real problem with
    bidding earlier at a higher price is when some newbie runs the sucker up with
    idiotic repeated incremental bids to find out what the bottom is.  <BR> <BR>Items
    that sell for a consistent price can easily be won by simply bidding that price
    early on and then ignoring the rest of the auction. I&#39;ve been buying camera
    accessories that way recently and still get new items at 60 to 75 percent of what
    I would have to pay for them at discount stores. <BR> <BR>When you see someone
    bidding against their own previous bid, you know they want it pretty bad, at any
    cost, and you could end up paying a lot by intervening with a bid. But sometimes
    this is just a ploy on the part of the bidder.

  body: 'Lots of good advice in this thread, bj. A few suggestions from my experience
    on Ebay: <BR> <BR>- Do your homework. Do some research and compare prices, descriptions,
    and sellers. Like everything else in life, if it&#39;s too good to be true, it&#39;s
    probably not true. <BR> <BR>- If there&#39;s something you really want, avoid
    the automatic bidding and be present at closing time. <BR> <BR>- Make sure you
    read carefully all the fine print. Shipping costs, payment methods, etc. <BR>
    <BR>- Trust high sellers with positive ratings, it&#39;s on their interest to
    keep customers satisfied. Also, read the comments people post in the feedback
    section, they are a very good indication on what to expect. <BR> <BR>- Since you
    can always contact the seller privately, do not trust people not willing to provide
    enough info or the ones that don&#39;t show images of expensive items; if you
    were selling something valuable, you would provide as many pics as you could in
    order to entice customers, wouldn&#39;t you? <BR> <BR>- When confronted with multiple
    options, follow your instinct. <BR> <BR>It might sound as if I have encountered
    a lot of crooks on Ebay but that&#39;s not true. Most of my bad experiences &#40;not
    that many&#41; have been my fault for getting carried away or for not being careful
    enough. In all, I have gotten quite a few gems, like a very nice copy of the 1923
    ATF specimen book. <BR> <BR>Good luck!'

  body: // Sniper&#39;s Confession // <BR> <BR>I sniped a 1923 ATF once in early 2003,
    and the &#40;snipee&#41; emailed me afterward with a sob story about how she was
    trying to recover the book from having lost her previous due to theft or something,
    and would I consider selling to her anyways. <BR> <BR>I felt so guilty for having
    sniped that when the book arrived I drove over to her place &#40;which was 5-10
    minutes away, interestingly&#41; and sold the book to her. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m unrepentant,
    but still have a conscience that I can&#39;t ignore, sometimes to my own demise.
    I&#39;ve been sniped enough myself to recognize it&#39;s just a part of the eBay
    game, and something you&#39;ll have to be prepared to do if you frequent it. But
    when people use bots to do their bidding, that&#39;s just plain dirty. <BR> <BR>jb

    a whole ethical debate. Nobody can really debate real sniping.&#41;  <BR> <BR>I
    always figure that if I can&#39;t be on eBay in the last minutes of the auction
    that I&#39;ll have to live with the 80% odds of losing. &#40;Again, unless it&#39;s
    a more obscure item with less people watching the auction.&#41;

    <BR> <BR>John <BR> <BR>The incremental increase isn&#39;t set by the seller. eBay
    sets this, the seller has no control over it. <BR> <BR>By rummaging around in
    Google I&#39;ve recently discover that the various sniper software &#40;or whatever
    it is called&#41; is seemingly ever in various states of revision as eBay is constantly
    changing its own software. Not to screw up these folks, eBay has no policy on
    that, but the various sniper software vendors are always complaining about having
    to issue new versions. Pity. Its not just the sniper-less buyers who don&#39;t
    like this kind of bidding, the sellers don&#39;t either. I suspect eBay really
    has no policy on it because they figure if folks are dumb enough to buy sniping
    software its just more activity for them. They make their money from percentages
    of sales and various listing fees that the seller has to pay for.'
