body: "I have written a nonfiction book aimed at psychotherapy professionals. What
  is the best font to use for the text body? The book size is 5.5x8.5. I currently
  have leading set at 15. The book is currently in Garamond Premier Pro but I am not
  sure I love it.\r\n\r\nAlso, I need a font that has semibold, bold, italic, semibold
  italic, normal.\r\n\r\nI'm especially interested in fonts included in the Adobe
  Open Type Collection since that's what I have (in addition to all of the basic fonts
  included in Word). No budget to buy new fonts.\r\n\r\nI'd appreciate your suggestions
  - Thank you!"

  body: "<cite>Yes- there are many Kepler subsets.</cite>\r\n\r\nShould be more than
    enough to cover your bases. Not knowing your margins, and being purely speculative
    I would be sure to look at the semi-condensed.\r\n\r\n<cite>Do you like it? What
    size would you recommend?\r\nDo you think a leader of 15 is good?</cite>\r\n\r\nFifteen
    point could be a little airy. I just picked up Kepler and have not had a chance
    to work with it much. I would guess that having a more modern x-height you could
    look at a 9-10.5 pt range type size over 13 or so, again depending on your margins
    and grid.\r\n\r\nKepler is a more contemporary take on a modern type that picks
    up some more humanistic details. It may be too colorful for what you are doing,
    but could also be a good choice.\r\n\r\nI would work with Adobe Garamond as well.\r\n\r\nSee
    what works well with you measure."

  body: That trim size makes me think of POD. Anyway, Kepler Semicondensed at 10/13
    with a little positive tracking sort of works. At that funny size the measure
    is a little shorter than I would like (with minimal margins), but take it for
    what it is worth.

  body: "If you set it on Vista and install ATM 4.1, you can use Kepler MM, and would
    have access to infinite variations. It is a fabulous font -- nothing so far released
    is as flexible. But aesthetically it is rather a mess. The humanist affects aren't
    convincing and the Baskerville g is in very bad taste. \r\n\r\nA fabulous choice,
    very close in design, is Matthew Carter's Miller, from Font Bureau. This type
    virtually sets itself, and is appealing at 9 on 12 -- that's one of its sweet
    spots. Carter doesn't do bad taste. \r\n\r\nAnother related font, which has seen
    extensive use in Time, is Carter's Time Caledonia. Perhaps now that Time has switched,
    Carter will release this font?\r\n\r\nGaramond doesn't seem the right choice for
    a psychotherapy manual. "

  body: "@willow1\u2014I\u2019m not going to rip Mr. Slimbach, but you do often find
    a face with a single quirky character. Bill makes some excellent suggestions.\r\n\r\nYou
    might also look at Warnock Pro from the Adobe Collection. For me Adobe Garamond
    is neutral enough and omnipresent, which helps mitigate its specific historical
    roots.\r\n\r\nBelizio or Canada Type\u2019s Clarendon might also work nicely with
    a Grot. if you could put that together, but I think they might be to wide."

  body: "What I find particularly interesting about this discussion is that a writer
    on psychotherapy is getting deeply involved in the typographical aspects of the
    the book he or she is about to design and publish. Well, there are other examples
    of authors making decisions about typefaces to be used for their texts (G. B.
    Shaw for one), but I suspect that this case reveals a more general and more contemporary
    tendency that springs from the array of fonts available to authors on their computers.
    \r\n\r\nHow can you make decisions about what typeface to use without knowing
    more about the book itself? The author has informed us that the size of the book
    is 5.5x8.5 (inches). What kind of margins does he or she want? What sort of paper?
    The author thought that 15 point leading might be a good idea. But leading means
    nothing without a typesize and thus this psychotherapist reveals an entirely understandable
    ignorance of basic typography. Moreover, designing a book in Word might be comparable
    to hunting elephants with a pea-shooter.\r\n\r\nThe spot-on and pertinent question
    by Sil concerning childhood incidents with Garamond virtually closes the discussion
    and really means that if you are a psychotherapist and you are writing and publishing
    a book you should get a typographer to design it (as David Hamuel implied). How
    many typographers go in for writing books on psychotherapy? \r\n\r\nA chacun son
    m\xE9tier.\r\n"

  body: "Well said. I think in the end I don\u2019t mind giving rope even if the requester
    may be constructing a self hanging. I suspect very few have passed as a result
    of rough page design. I hope I\u2019ve learned a thing or two by asking a question
    that revealed a lapse on my part.\r\n\r\nYou point out a few obvious clues that
    suggest the attempt at typography is not fully informed. Still, we can look at
    the origins of modern psychotherapy and create a very general historical frame\u2014any
    font directly associated with a time that predates psychotherapy could be crossed
    off the list. What margins? Well, let\u2019s assume enough for a thumb at the
    outside and enough inside that the text doesn\u2019t get consumed by the binding.
    Given that, and the limited set of typefaces willow1 has to choose from, it would
    seem that there are very few fonts capable of setting a reasonable number of characters
    in widest possible measure.\r\n\r\nMaybe if we provide as reasonable an answer
    as possible the asker might take away a better understanding of the task at hand,
    or even decide to hire a professional?"
