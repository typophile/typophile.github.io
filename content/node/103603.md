    as an ideal font but never released as a font -- nada on google other than the
    art show. Go figure. Found a few more letters, which for some unexplained reason
    are <a href=\"http://www.michaeljwilson.com/2005ArtforumAlbenda.htm\">psycho!</a>.\r\nAnything
    more?\r\nDon"

    As an artist it's worth much more to him as a source for paintings at his exhibitions,
    which are at top galleries including the Guggenheim.\r\nDon"
