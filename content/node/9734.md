  body: Mike, <BR>Thanks for the tip.. The Terra Cotta Alternate looks as close as
    I have found. I had seen this before but could not remember the Foundry.  <BR>
    <BR>David, thank you for the link as well some interesting &#39;alien&#39; fonts
    and the paving pattern may prove useful in the future. <BR> <BR>Perhaps I reaaly
    should unearth my old copy of Fontographer.. Although I never could get  ligatures
    to work for me... probably just need to read the manual.  <BR> <BR>Thanks again..
    and in advance.. in case soemone finds another alternate. <BR> <BR>Page

  body: 'I still think Terracotta may be the closest I have found, but just for comparison,
    other Architect lettering would include: <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/arroyostyle/g-and-g/"
    target="_blank">G&amp;G</a> from Woodside Graphics; <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/outsidetheline/architectural-lettering/"

    target="_blank">Strongs Draughtsman</a> from Nick&#39;s Fonts &#40;this is extremely
    close to the feeling of your sample, but a bit &#39;cuter&#39; in certain touches,
    IMHO&#41;; there are also the more familiar Engineering styles like Blueprint,
    Stylus, Tekton and Graphite, which I have not linked. There is also the drafting
    face included with the House Neutraface set, but you have to buy the whole set
    to get it, and it is not as expressive, or antique-looking as yours. <BR> <BR>I
    would say the choice is between Strongs Draughtsman or Terracotta, from the fonts
    I was able to find.'

    of secondrate handwriting fonts - so sorry to hear it&#39;s gone downhill from
    there. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"

  body: kemie, wow thats as close as I have found. thank you. your site is quite the
    gem.  I only wish I had found that a day earlier. I have already begun making
    the font  from this drawing . I particularly like the curvy nature of the descenders
    in the drawing. I am also having some narrow kerning to resemble the actual nature
    of the ink on linen drawing. When viewing the actual drawings you can see the
    very subtle fine weave in the surface of the ink.  I will share as I have something
    workable.
