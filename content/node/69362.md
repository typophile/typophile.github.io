body: "Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection Publications is EXTENDING our
  call for bids to create new scholarly inscription font. We are inviting professional
  type designers to submit bids for the creation of Athena Ruby, a font for the publication
  of inscribed coins, seals, and other objects from the Byzantine world. We are extending
  the bidding process through May 21, 2010.\r\n\r\nWe would really love to see more
  bids from designers interested in this unique opportunity. This typeface will be
  used by Byzantine scholars world wide in the study of ancient material culture.
  You can be a part of the proud history of this contribution to the scholarly community!\r\n\r\nFor
  complete specifications for the Athena Ruby typeface and the bidding process, please
  go to http://www.doaks.org/publications/athena_ruby_bids.html.\r\n\r\nif you have
  any questions or concerns about the bid specifications, please contact us at AthenaRuby@doaks.org"

  body: Yes, they don't actually ask for ability to walk on water, but it seems to
    be implied. In terms of background knowledge I'm pretty much a perfect fit for
    this (I've even published an article about a pseudo-Byzantine coin), but I'm no
    graphic designer and this is too big a project to take on in the hopes that I
    might quickly turn into one.

  body: "Not - easy peasy. \r\n\r\nBut in the realm of the do-able for some. \r\n\r\nThe
    tone of the request is what strikes me as unfortunate. Maybe I am reading too
    much into it but it feels like the folk you would be dealing with are somehow...
    quite uneasy. \r\n\r\nAlso this is the realm of programmers: \"We may also ask
    for an easy-to-use keyboard utility, either separately or in conjunction with
    a commonly available utility, for scholars to find needed characters easily.\"
    I know a few people who could build this but it doesn't seem like something to
    casually \"toss in\". \r\n\r\nSeeing how it will be used though, I can see why
    they would hope for such a tool. The best thing to do is probably to use the InDesign
    glyph pallet.\r\n\r\nIt might be cool to be able to get access to variant forms
    by making an opentype script that allows you to typing the primary glyph and a
    number and have it substituted by the relevant purple variant."

  body: "Eben, you're both presuming a lot about the kind of workflows and publishing
    environments that might be used and overlooking the need for transcriptions to
    be searchable, which isn't possible if you're using keyboard input sequences to
    access glyph variants. Keyboards input characters; glyph variants are, well, <em>glyph</em>
    variants.\r\n\r\nI don't think I share James' view that this is project is \u2018easy
    peasy\u2019. Or, rather, the drawing glyphs and sticking them in a font is the
    easy part, but that alone isn't going to resolve Dunbarton Oaks' publishing needs."

  body: "I was thinking that the extra purple glyphs would not be used for searchable
    text, actually that would probably become tedious for users in a hurry.  But perhaps
    they could be used to make the link between the text and the image more apparent
    - eg The text says \"Alpha\" and then in parenthesis the kind of Alpha which is
    depicted could be shown as well. It might be besides the point to do such a thing
    because the real users of such documents are are savvy enough already.\r\n\r\nWhen
    you talk about workflows in this case you mean that this font is likely to be
    used in MS Word - not In Design. Correct? \r\n\r\nWhat do you think the main issues
    in meeting their needs are likely to be?"

  body: "If I understand the RFP correctly, what they want is a simple way of dealing
    with a situation where glyph variants are semantically significant to their user
    community. From experience of working with very similar material, I'm sure they
    get text submitted to them using all sorts of random kludges - for instance, I
    worked for a while on a book that had a lot of Greek coins, where the author had
    typed Cyrillic che to represent the Hellenstic-Roman shape of Greek koppa, and
    the element symbol from set theory for lunate epsilon. It's time-consuming to
    fix a book-length manuscript full of this kind of thing, and it requires knowing
    more about epigraphy than most editors/typesetters do. So I think they want to
    create an integrated system that channels people into doing things the \"right\"
    (i.e., standards-compatible) way.\r\n\r\nOne large problem, as John says, is that
    even if all the pieces of what they want are individually doable, making the whole
    thing work well may not be. If the workflow involves an author typing her/his
    text in a word-processing program, and then a publisher moving this into a page
    layout program and/or into a website management system - all the while maintaining
    control over minor variations in glyph forms that are of stylistic or chronological
    relevance - well, how do you manage all the variables? Is the author using Mellel
    on Mac or OpenOffice on Linux? Or do you create a workflow that only allows Word
    2010 on Windows? And my limited knowledge of TEI does not suggest to me any easy
    way to make the whole thing compatible with TEI XML while retaining all glyph-variant
    information: perhaps if I actually read the spec I'd find something, but it seems
    at first glance like it would require a fair bit of scripting to get glyph-level
    information out of one system and into another.\r\n\r\nWhat they need is a team,
    not a type designer, and I really wonder if they budgeted in accordance with what
    they're asking for."

  body: "Eben, the point of having a transcription font like Athena Ruby is to transcribe
    text in a way that represents the physical appearance of that text. But at the
    same time, you want that text to be searchable based on the underlying character.
    Eleven different shapes of the letter Alpha are still all the letter Alpha. Ideally,
    you want users to be able to do two things: to search for text and to search for
    uses of particular variant letters, since both of these are of interest to students
    of numismatics and sigillography: what a text says and what a text looks like.
    A scholar wants to be able to say \u2018Show me all the coins/seals that include
    the following word\u2019 and also to say \u2018Show me all the coins/seals that
    use this particular form of Alpha\u2019.\r\n\r\nAnd as I hope this makes clear,
    no, I am not talking about using MS Word. :)\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nDavid: <em>...as
    John says, is that even if all the pieces of what they want are individually doable,
    making the whole thing work well may not be.</em>\r\n\r\nI don't think I said
    that. I said that the actual type design bit was easy, but I don't think the rest
    of it is not doable. I do think that it will take some time to pulls all the pieces
    together, and fully expect the process to involve things like proposing new characters
    to the UTC, extending the TEI XML to include glyph variant information, mapping
    this information to OTL features via style sheets. All doable, but yes, more than
    just designing a typeface."

    think I conflated your comment about the font itself not resolving their needs
    with my own doubts about their having thought through the practical issues.\r\n\r\nFor
    an in-house system, it's just a technical problem, and I think that is all soluble.
    But when they say they want it to be designed for scholars to work with easily,
    I assume they mean to distribute it, not just use it in-house. And that is a larger
    problem."
