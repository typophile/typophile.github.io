body: "In the early 1990's, Manfred Albracht sold his program \"Type Designer\" through
  his one-man outfit \"DTP Software\" in Monschau near Aachen in Germany. This outfit
  seems to have been liquidated years ago. But since quite some time, a new outfit,
  which seems to be a mailbox company (dummy company, front company, shell company)
  and which is called \"dtp Kontor Ltd.\", seems to be selling FontLab programs:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dtpsoft.de\r\n\r\nThis
  \"mailbox company without a mailbox\" whose owner is or was claimed to be the Aixmedia
  outfit seems to have not existed as a real company. Therefore at the website of
  the Aachen Chamber of Commerce\r\n \r\nhttp://www.aachen.ihk.de/scripts/mla/mla_archiv.php?l=31&m=2749\r\n\r\nwe
  read that this dummy company (or at least its German dummy \"subsidiary\") was erased
  in the public records as of June 2007:\r\n\r\n\"L\xF6schungen: dtp Kontor Ltd.,
  Zweigniederlassung Deutschland, Monschau. Von Amts wegen eingetragen gem\xE4\xDF
  \xA7 142 FGG: Die Zweigniederlassung ist aufgehoben 25. Juni 2007\"\r\n\r\nThe English
  website of this mailbox company is found here\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dtp-kontor.com/english/font_software/info/imprint/index.htm\r\n\r\nwith
  the following \"postal address\":\r\n\r\ndtp Kontor Ltd., 196 High Road, London,
  N22 8HH, United Kingdom\r\n\r\nNow make this funny little experiment. Enter these
  words\r\n\r\n\"196 High Road\" London\r\n\r\nin Google, and you will be surprised
  to get more than ten thousand hits. This is because \"196 High Road\" is the \"postal
  address\" of thousands of \"mailbox companies without a mailbox\", i.e. of thousands
  of front companies or shell companies or mailbox companies, which do not exist in
  reality in this mystery house in \"196 High Road\".\r\n\r\nNow what happens from
  the legal point of view, if you buy a FontLab program (e.g. TypeTool, ScanFont,
  etc.) at this \"dtp Kontor Ltd.\" website:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dtp-kontor.com/english/font_software/software/browse/index.htm\r\n\r\nIf
  \"dtp Kontor Ltd.\" does not supply the paid program, or if a defective program
  is supplied, which \"company\" can you sue at which court, considering that in the
  mystery house in \"196 High Road\" in London \"exist\" thousands of mystery companies?\r\n"
