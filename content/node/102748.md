  body: It looks as if it might be from an embroidery monogram specimen catalog. See
    if you can find it there.

  body: No luck so far with the embroidery fonts. Does anyone know of any software
    program that I could get that I can manipulate a font that is close into the one
    I want to use and still be able to use it as a font?

    it here.\" in the by-line :)"
