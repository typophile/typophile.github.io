  body: Reminds me ([[http://typophile.com/node/119034|again]]) the latin counterpart
    of some fonts for non-latin languages like Lao, Oriya, Myanmar, some sort of chopped-off
    job based on Times.

    as the primary logo wordmark and for the secondary properties' logos. I guess
    I'll just have to ask the designer to supply the full customised set."

  body: "You might consider purchasing a font from Murasu Systems http://murasu.com/
    and using the Latin letters. See the specimen I posted at http://typophile.com/node/119151
    You would need to squoosh the height and do some editing, but it's a lot less
    work than doing your own chop job on Times.\r\nDon"
