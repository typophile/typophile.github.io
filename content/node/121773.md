  body: "Can't be 100% positive but looks very close to the latin counterpart of some
    foreign language fonts that come bundled with Microsoft OS like [[http://www.fonts.com/font/microsoft-corporation/latha|Latha]],
    [[http://www.fonts.com/font/microsoft-corporation/tunga|Tunga]] or [[http://www.fonts.com/font/microsoft-corporation/kartika|Kartika]].
    \r\n\r\nEDIT: got a better answer. Should be [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ascender/microsoft-sans-serif|Microsoft
    Sans-Serif]] which is also used for the latin counterpart of aforementioned fonts."
