  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">«Try that font!», «Try this one, look, it's really nice», «This is great for you job, use it!» &amp; so on. I guess, everybody has heard those motivating exclamations many times. So, you go to the site of a typefoudnry, click the font, look at it, maybe it's good, maybe not so — you would test it anyway. The only way to do this nowadays is to «Test drive» it on the screen with the resolution of poor 72dpi, sometimes with some &quot;nice&quot; background interfering the specimen completely. And this is not really a test-drive. It's a tease drive. So if I like it, but am not sure, I will have to pay some 30$ to get a copy of it and put it back on the shelf after I've seen that it looks a bit different when printed with that laser printer in the corner. It is of no interest anymore. Cool. -30$. The loop starts again. <BR> <BR>The good thing is — type foundries get there fonts sold, type designers get royalties, websites get even more banners placed and earn some peanuts too. <BR> <BR>The bad thing is — some frustrated designers get eDonkey installed, search for any font, download it and never buy it again. Nobody gets any royalties, hot discussions about piracy and type being seen as an easy concept to abuse spring out there and there. <BR> <BR>In Easter Europe (my motherland belongs to that corner), you just go around the corner, pay 3$ for a CD and get 50 000 fonts packed and sorted nicely. From 20 different foundries. Full character sets. True Type or PostScript. Whatever. Who will pay 30$ for ONE font now? And let me assure you, out of those 50000 you were looking maybe for those three&hellip; <BR> <BR>I am probably opening some smelly box now and give yet another push to the old topic, but I just want to ask, if anybody has any ideas about ways of testing the fonts live. There are practices in this highly commercialized world to try things for free and not to upset anybody — be it a customer or a business. It's like a test drive at your local car dealer. You do have the chance to drive your beloved BMW, maybe even for a whole weekend. For free, of course. You just tank it. Ha, nice. Let me see, what SAAB got there. Hm. And Rover? Oh.. <BR> <BR>I've read somewhere, that a [small] type foundry was selling its font(s) for a 10$ with a time-limited license or something. Am not sure. My idea is to sell for peanuts ($1) or let out for free a font containing limited characters, couple of figures, maybe even OS and Caps in the same file. So you can type in some words, see some chars, print them out(!) and get the feeling. So you go and buy it then. I would. Even though I have 3 CD full of fonts from my motherland. Good for me, I can test-drive fonts with full character sets. But I don't use any of them unlicensed — I always buy fonts for my later work. Bad for the industry — several thousands of other designers do the same and will never think of licensing a single font. There is no other way to try a font and the temptation to «leave it like that» is just way too big. <BR> <BR>P.S. The first paragraph has nothing to do with the other thread I have started couple of hours ago (where I do ask about a specific font). I didn't mean to pick on anybody here.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This is an excellent idea. It is also a very tricky idea, because, as we know from music and dvd's, any encription can be broken. <BR> <BR>So, if a foundry were to release a 30-day trial version of a font, soon enough someone would find a way to break the time lock, and people would be using the font for free, easier. <BR> <BR>Of course, everyone already uses all of the fonts for free, the bootleg CD Alexy has just mentioned. <BR> <BR>Foundries are often reluctant to increase the possibility that even more people will be using their fonts without buying. This is really a life and death issue for our industry. <BR> <BR>FontShop just tried out an idea that I like: they released the Semi-Bold weight of Legato for free. If you like that, you can buy more weights, or the whole family. When you have a family with two dozen or more weights, one single weight is usually not of much use (esp. Semi Bold), but together</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I come from the world of free software, which struggles mightily with similar issues. <BR> <BR>I'm not sure that font foundries, as an <i>industry</i>, have much of a future. I know this may not be a popular position here, but I'm not entirely sure this is a bad thing. <BR> <BR>My ideal world would reward font designers for their work, and also allow people to use the resulting fonts freely. The successes of free software prove that these two goals are not always incompatible. In addition, while there's a lot of crappy free software out there, there's also some really high quality work being done. <BR> <BR>In fact, my paying job strikes a pretty good balance between all these goals. I'm the chief ghost of Ghostscript, which is released both as free software, and is also licensed to about a hundred OEM customers, bringing in enough revenue to support a staff of about ten engineers. <BR> <BR>So the basic formula is that <i>people</i> can use our software for free (and millions do), but companies that want to sell something including our software have to pay. We do get ripped off from time to time, but on balance it works pretty well. <BR> <BR>I don't really know how to adapt this formula to fonts, but I am suggesting that there might be better models than trying to enforce intellectual property protection. <BR> <BR>I see three big problems with the free font scene: low quality (in general; absolutely no offense meant to the nice freely released fonts I see posted here), lack of scholarship and attribution, and ripoff artists grabbing more attention than the people who actually do the work. The attribution thing is pretty central to the philosophy of free software, which after all has its roots in academic computer science. It's also not just a problem with freeware fonts - &quot;Book Antiqua&quot;, anyone? <BR> <BR>Again, I don't have solutions for these problems. I'm much more likely to design fonts as a hobby than as a profession, but it's always nice to get recognition for your work, and there are few forms of recognition more satisfying than payment. <BR> <BR>[And sorry for the rambling - I'm up way past my bedtime. If I've started a big flamewar, hopefully I'll be coherent in the morning]</div>

		<div class="commentbody">There's a lot of people whe pay for typefaces, Often they work in 'professional' agencies who have a software licensing policy. <BR>Here in the UK, organisations like FAST investigate companies, and although the fines for illegal software aren't crippling, (neither are they for companies that pollute the environment), there ARE fines. <BR>So, people do buy type software, and I think there are enough of them for the industry to continue to exist.</div>
