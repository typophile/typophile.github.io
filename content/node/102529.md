body: "Hello typophile fontlab users,\r\n\r\nSo I have this 5 layered font based on
  a painted font in fontlab.\r\n\r\nI've figured out how to get the kerning exact
  so it aligns perfectly every time. My issue is the vertical settings.\r\n\r\nIn
  Illustrator or Photoshop, when using a text box, as opposed to clicking on canvas
  with type tool, Illustrator will adjust the baseline for each of the 5 layered styles.\r\n\r\nHere
  is a picture of 2 of the font layers using the text box versus type path tool.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Type_Align_5763.jpg]\r\n\r\nIs
  this something to do with vertical metrics? Am I missing a checkbox that says \"keep
  original character positioning\"?\r\n\r\nAppreciate any advice."

  body: Just shooting from the hip here, but the text box (as with most text boxes
    in page layout programs) appears to presume that you want the type aligned with
    the top of the box, and so it automatically shifts the type upward. The Text Tool
    makes no such presumption.

  body: "Looks like Nick is right. I just tried it with a layered font I'm working
    on - top is text box, bottom text tool:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hello_5427.JPG]"

  body: "I like your thinking oldnick.\r\n\r\nBut after testing two different multi
    layered fonts, Detroit and Frontage using the text box in illustrator, I've found
    that they both behave differently.\r\n\r\nDetroit automatically shifts the layers
    around like in daverowland's example. \r\n\r\nHowever, Frontage somehow always
    sticks to the baseline, with the shadows dropping into the descender line. This
    creates the perfect vertical alignment, so you can type anything in the box and
    duplicate the box to change the type into say the shadow style.\r\n\r\nI'll keep
    trying some possible solutions, I thought it might be a simple checkbox on export
    to retain the glyph ruler/metric settings."

  body: It might help to standardize the BBox vertical metrics. Some cheating may
    be necessary.

    think of and couldn't get round the problem. Don't suppose that is any help!!
