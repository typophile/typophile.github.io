  serif, stencil, and inline (or outlined) styles? Again, I'm looking for a single
  typeface that has all of these styles included\u2014I know, quite a tall order,
  but I'm curious if one exists. [[http://www.typonine.com/fonts/font-library/audree/|Audree]]
  is the only one I know that comes close. It has a so-called normal style, but not
  a pure sans serif.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    and it is strictly sans-serif; no actual stencil but a dashed version. Someone
    may have written something like that in Metafont but I have no real idea.

    is currently a large family named Look, in similar spirit: Sans, serif and script
    with weathered and outline-shadow variants. No stencil, though, as far as I can
    see.\r\n\r\nOh, well\u2026 a near miss, anyway."
