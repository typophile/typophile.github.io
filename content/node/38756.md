  body: The comma remains roman. The comma is part of the punctuation of the paragraph,
    which is roman, and isn't related to the italicized word, which could have appeared
    anywhere in the sentence.

  body: If the text immediately preceding the punctuation is styled <em>(e.g.,</em>
    italic, bold), the punctuation should be likewise styled, regardless of the text
    that follows.

    the punctuation in roman. With italic text, italic punctuation normally gives
    letterfit and thus looks less obtrusive.\"\r\n\r\n"

    that just needs to look pretty and read well, use the italic comma. If you have
    to deal with an uptight editorial department that won\u2019t budge on technicalities,
    save yourself a headache and go roman."

  body: 'this is getting interesting. i am in an editorial environment. edit staff
    says roman. part of the design staff shares that opinion. the other part of the
    design team agrees that it should be italic. It looks to be more of a stylistic
    move. So maybe the question should be, should typographers unite vs the edit staff
    and push for a style over grammatical? '

  body: "I work in book publishing and it's a matter of house style. Some publishers
    italicize punctuation directly following itals, some don't. There's no across-the-board
    consensus. It's very frustrating actually to try to keep track.\r\n\r\nIn general,
    I'd follow the style of the manuscript and query the editor if you're not sure.\r\n\r\nPersonally,
    I'm with Brendan, I prefer to italicize it. I don't like the look of italic text
    bumping into roman without a space. It's even worse with parens or quote marks."

  body: "Brendan: <em>So maybe the question should be, should typographers unite vs
    the edit staff and push for a style over grammatical?</em>\r\n\r\nIt's not a question
    of grammar. Grammar only determines that there should be punctuation present,
    not how the punctuation should be styled. As Patty says, this is a matter of 'house
    style'.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I italicise punctuation that immediately follows italic
    except when the punctuation is the closure of enclosing punctuation that opened
    with roman punctuation. In that case, I use roman punctuation for such marks (e.g.
    parentheses*, quote marks). This, of course, gives rise to situations like this,
    in which careful kerning between the italic comma and the roman closing quotes
    may be necessary:\r\n\r\n\u201CA quote opens in roman, <em>but ends in italics,</em>\u201D
    she said.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Actually, I almost never use italicised parentheses or
    other brackets; well-spaced roman brackets look much better."
