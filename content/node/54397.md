  body: '"Classic Gothic", a Letter Gothic clone. It was the default typeface for
    several models of Olympia daisywheel typewriters. I believe the daisywheels were
    produced for Olympia by Rarotype in Berlin. You can see a small sample <a href="http://buero-center-rudolf.de/shop/Olympia-Typenrad-308.html">here</a>.'
