body: "A recent brief of mine asks for me to present the entire text from the book
  'Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde', all 25,000 words of it. Of course, to present this in
  the context of a book would be a process of tedium and torment. we are encouraged
  to break the boundries of 'the form of a book', so setting and binding a book is
  out of the question.\r\n\r\nI decided to display the book through a selection of
  decorative picture frames that I have either built, salvaged or bought from various
  charity shops. I need to consider size and printing costs.\r\n\r\nI intended on
  using Caslon for the entire body text. I realise that the content and era of the
  book are intrinsic to the piece. The book was released in 1886 in Victorian London,
  obviusly the type needs some kind of horror vibe. I realise caslon was created over
  100 years previous to this date, but I understand it was widely used throughout
  the victorian era. I wanted to ask the following questions:\r\n\r\n<p>I have both
  adobe caslon and caslon Old face, for the body text, which would be most    appropriate?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Could
  you reccomend any ornaments/fleurons that would work well with the body text</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What
  would work well with Caslon as a headline text? Here is the crux of the problem.
  I need two fonts, both of them complimenting the body text, one for the respectable
  'Dr. Jekyll' and another for the tyrannical 'Mr. Hyde'. The fonts will need to be
  displayed together as the main headline, but would also be used for chapter headings.
  The faces really need to opitimise the eponymous character(s) in the book.</p>\r\n\r\nAny
  feedback will be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThankyou"

    want to use Caslon?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "caslon seemed right for the brief, I mean, the course tutors want to see
    historical background. The face has to relate to the timeframe of the text itself.
    Stevenson leaves an ambiguity about the actual date that the proceedings occured,
    when the date is mentioned he marks the year as \"18--\", so it could exist anywhere
    whithin C19th.\r\n\r\nI read that Caslon was a widely used face during the 18th
    century, and from my samples it seems to work well for the subject matter. Baskerville
    seems to be a litte contrived, a fantastic face that fits the restrictions of
    the text, but I would like to be a little...different.\r\n\r\nWhat would you suggest
    hrant? Thankyou for the feedback. It is really appreciated.\r\n\r\nTomShep"

    Founder's Caslon</a> to illustrate the sinister duality of the story?

  body: "now that IS a good idea. Of course, this will command a complete re-edit
    of the text.\r\n\r\nYou see, TomShep is a student who takes his macintosh everywhere.
    At the moment I am residing in a bar in deep south london. It is 11:40. \r\n\r\nAside
    from my alcohol intake, the face seems to relate far more to the old stlyle caslon.
    Do you think it would be wise to use the 'adobe caslon' for the rational Dr Jekyll,
    and revert to the founders caslon for the manical Mr. Hyde?\r\n\r\nThe font will
    be purchased tomorrow mornig after this frivolous night is over.\r\n\r\nI can
    onky thank you for the input.\r\n\r\nThnakyou x\r\n"

  body: "I guess Caslon makes sense. I just don't like it - it's so diluted.\r\nDefinitely
    not Baskerville though. Hey what about Bell, or a Scotch?\r\n\r\nBTW, if Jekyll/Hyde
    was French I would've suggested Meridien and Vendome!\r\n\r\nThe idea of using
    a \"rough\" Caslon for the nasty fellow seems intuitive,\r\nand it can probably
    work, but I think there's room for more subtlety.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I also generally stay away from Caslon (with the exception of Mr. Carter's
    Big Caslon). I agree with Hrant that Bell MT would be gorgeous. But what about
    the two contrasting display faces? \r\n\r\nOne option would be to stick with one
    face throughout and treat it differently for each character, such as using white
    titles on black for the bad guy."
