body: "Warren Chappell used to conceive the font <em>Lydian</em> in 1938 for ATF but
  the digital version doesn't recapture the exact design, especially the capital <strong>A</strong>
  that features a cross bar and the original italic used old-style figures for numerals.
  Do you know the reason why Monotype doesn't offer the alternate capitals and numerals?
  Thank you.\r\n"
