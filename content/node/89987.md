  you can choose a complimentary italic that doesn't necessarily have to be from the
  same family. I'm using ITC Fenice for the text face, can anyone suggest an italic
  to use instead of Fenice Italic? As much as I like it, I'd like something a bit
  more fancy and attractive. \r\n\r\n"

    noting that the website says it's \"pronounced fe-nee-chay\")\r\n\r\nHellbox,
    I agree with Bringhurst that alternate complementary italics can be used. But
    ITC Fenice as a text font is outside of my experience and I am at a loss to suggest
    an alternative italic."
