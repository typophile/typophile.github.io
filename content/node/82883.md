  Gothic? I like Soho the best so far. It needs to be human and friendly, easy to
  read with a little edge. Thanks for your help!

    and what message you want to send.

  body: "Neither Century Gothic nor Lubalin Graph seem human and friendly to me. I\u2019d
    suggest a less constructed typeface. If you\u2019re looking for a slab, try Serifa
    or Salvo (grotesque-model) or Caecilia and the like for more humanist forms and
    proportions.\r\nOr browse here: http://myfonts.us/td-vL12P2"
