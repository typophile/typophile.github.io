  body: "IMHO, I think that <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/resident/old-jerzy-gothic/condensed/\">this</a>
    would be a good substitute for the \"Wonder Worker\".  It is imperfect, like a
    lot of lettering would have been.\r\n\r\nAs for the Dr. AC Daniels, I'd suggest
    <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/ultramodern-classic-sg/\">Ultramodern
    Classic SG</a>, <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/durak/\">Durak</a>
    or <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/riot-squad-nf/\">Riot Squad</a>.
    \ But that's just me.\r\n\r\n"
