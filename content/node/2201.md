  ALT=":&#41;"> I made &#34;Ascii&#34; back in the late &#39;80s for a school assignment,
  intrigued by the effect of overlapping shapes in Fontographer. If there&#39;s interest,
  I&#39;ll release it. <BR>Comments pro or con are welcome. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/213.gif"

  body: ' I think this concept would really &#40;and maybe only&#41; come to life
    as an &#42;animation&#42;: if you made the polygons of each letter move around
    &#40;maybe only sporadically forming something legible&#41; that could be really
    cool. You could even make an interactive game out of it or something. <BR> <BR>Extrapolate
    into the dimension of time, and you might just end up with something wildly interesting.
    And it would be &#42;really&#42; experimental!  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>hhp '

    will be as an animation. In Flash, most likely. '

    the only thing is that some of the letters are kind of hard to reas&#40;ie. S
    and s &#41;. with a little more work and this could be a hit with designer trying
    to capture an 80&#39;s feel. <BR> <BR>check out apostrophiclabs.com '
