  body: "This is sort of related to the the bug I was experiencing before. As long
    as the URL does not get prefixed with the www subdomain, I appear to be logged
    in. If I go away from Typophile for a while (say, I actually have to get some
    work done...) and return using a link or bookmark which includes the www subdomain,
    It appears that I am no longer logged in. Once I click another link within the
    Typophile site, the www is not used and I am magically logged in again.\r\n\r\nThis
    must have something to do with the domain specificity of your cookies. Perhaps
    redirecting or doing a mod_rewrite on all www.* requests to a subdomainless address
    would resolve the issue.\r\n\r\nYou guys are running this site on Apache, right?"

  body: "Thanks for Typophile 2 guys!  I've been awaiting this eagerly for a long
    time!  I really appreciate all your hard work!\r\n\r\nOkay, here's the bug report.\r\n\r\n*
    It seems that both on IE and FF (on PC) that the first post in every thread wraps
    around the avatar image (if it's long enough) and in subsequent posts it doesn't
    wrap around the image at all.\r\n\r\n* When using FF on the Forums home page when
    you drag your mouse pointer over the links in the Prolific Posters and Active
    forum topics sections the headlines (or second versions of them) flicker above
    them (around 100 pixels).\r\n\r\n* At the bottom of the page where you're able
    to send instant messages the Go! button is located underneath the grey box instead
    of inside it.\r\n\r\nI love the news section, and everything else about the site...
    I haven't had a chance to explore too much yet.  Plus the headlines are really
    great-looking (where you use that font-substition tech).\r\n\r\nWill we be able
    to use our real names (next to the messages) when we post?  I really liked that
    about Typophile, that people weren't hiding behind aliases and you know who's
    who.\r\n\r\nThanks again for all the great work... this is all I can think of
    at the moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n>> Lauri Johnsen"

    Username and Password input boxes look different (IE and FF on PC).  Username
    box is not as tall as the Password box, it has a light grey border while the Password
    box has a dark grey border.  And on FF the Password box's border turns blue when
    your typing something inside it (focus); this doesn't happen with the Username
    box.\r\n\r\n* Instead of quotes and apostrophies I see &#xy; codes in the list
    of forum topics and in the title bar of the browser.\r\n\r\n* Also when your reading
    a forum thread the great-looking headers with the thread topic doesn't show up

    and then using my old username to log in and that didn't work, so I had to use
    my full name (case insensitive) to gain access to Typophile.\r\n\r\nAlso, it would
    be nice to have some space between your username + time stamp and your message.
    \ Because the way it is now, the username with the timestamp looks like it's part
    of the message.  This could be solved with some space, having your username in
    bold, a different color, put it in a box, or have a horizontal rule underneath
    the username.  (Typophile 2.0 is still beta so I'm not too worried about all this)."

    apart, or lines are way too long and hard to read.  But there's always liquid
    designs that don't get bigger but only smaller... For example you could have a
    maximum width of 1030 pixels, and the liquid design would adapt to browser windows
    smaller than that, but then you would run into problems with columns being too

    sorry to say this, but the long lines are a fundmental typographical mistake,
    and very offputting, though in a way that people generally would not be able to
    put their fingers on.  \r\n\r\nBringhurst says that \"45 to 75 characters is widely
    regarded as a satisfactory length of a line for a single column page set in a
    seriffed typeface in a text size.\" And a line of 66 characters he thinks ideal.
    He goes on to say \"Even with generous leading, a line that averages more than
    75 or 80 characters is likely to be too long for continuous reading.\"\r\n\r\nI
    couldn't figure out why I felt so uncomfortable with the new design until I read
    the comments from others on the width. Then I counted characters, and I think
    I got up to 110. This is totally unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nI found in my own experimentation
    on Bringhurst's recommendation that, to my eye, line length, in terms of characters,
    together with leading are the most important factors in comfort in reading - generally
    more important than typeface. \r\n\r\nPlease please please change the line length

  body: "<strong>The Width Issue&trade;:</strong> I hear Joe about the need to allow
    space for large images, but these are so uncommon on Typophile that it seems a
    waste of space to force the column (now 685px wide) to leave room for them <em>all</em>
    the time. Check out how the beautifully functional <a href=\"http://www.yayhooray.com/thread/997/Must-Find-Robex\">YayHooray</a>
    manages the issue. The content column width is static, sized for text and smaller
    images (though maybe a tad too wide at 600px). On the <a href=\"http://www.yayhooray.com/thread/42226/The-New-Typophile-Is-Live\">rare
    occasion</a> that an image extends beyond the column, that image floats, and the
    line width for text remains. I feel strongly this is both the most aesthetic and
    practical solution. Just shave a few pixels off the width.\r\n\r\nOn another note,
    though I preferred names and posting times in the left column, the new style is
    perfect. Thank you!"

  body: "This is more of a feature request. I'd like to be able to get an RSS feed
    for a single thread. For example, I like to know immediately when someone posts
    to a certain few critique threads which I'm following closely. This is more interesting
    to me than knowing when a new critique is started, especially since new critiques
    begin infrequently but can last for months. If this is implemented, I'd like it
    if it was hooked up with a <link> tag so I can subscribe by clicking the RSS address
    bar button in Safari.\r\n\r\nThis might count as a bug. The Uppercase Blog RSS
    feed items don't say which blog the item comes from. There's an author field for
    RSS items. That might be a nice place to stick the name of the author from who's
    blog the item was aggregated. Admittedly it is kinda fun to guess who the author
    might be from the content and style, but still, I'd rather have it fixed.\r\n\r\nBlue
    sky thinking here. I liked how the old typophile could email you about any thread
    you've participated in. So posting to a thread was the way you indicated that
    you wanted to be kept up to date on the thread. It's a bit of a technical challenge
    I think to get that working efficiently with RSS but I'd to have something similar."

    click and select \"Play\" to get the title of the page to show up.\r\n\r\nI think
    Stewf Coles has the right idea there for handling images. Comfortable column sizes
    shouldn't restrict image sizes. Large images shouldn't make text hard to read.\r\n\r\nAbout
    the left hand column. I like it empty like it is now. Now that I've been reading
    threads for a bit and now that everyone is choosing an icon, the blank space works
    to delimit the posts and makes it easier for me to scan to the right spot faster.
    Maybe the user names could be bold. I agree that the name used for the author
    of the post should be the \"Full Name\" and not the login.\r\n\r\nAbout the empty
    right hand gutter, I'm with Frank Jonen on this. Lots of room that could be used
    for more controls. Maybe stick some thread pagination controls there. It'd beat
    having to scroll to the bottom of a thread to find the link that shows the most
    recent page."

  body: Speaking of the <a href="http://typophile.com/tracker/">tracker</a>, it has
    an inconsistent notion of post ownership. Comments I make on forum threads show
    up in the tracker with the author of the original post that started the thread,
    but when I went in to the wiki to correct a trivial typo in the entry [[John Butler]]
    wrote for himself, the tracker started showing me as the author! That's counterintuitive.
    It seems to me that forum threads should show the name of the most recent commenter,
    and wiki entries should stick to the original authors more often than not. Or
    modify the tracker to have a column for author and another column for commenter
    / editor.

    continue to curse all versions of Photoshop since 5, FontLab, InDesign, and OS
    X. What they have in common: too cute, too cluttered. in short, overdesigned.
    \r\n\r\nI'm not against new functionalities, and can sympathize with all the hard
    work that's gone into the Typophile revision. But I'm disappointed that the basic
    design of the threads is so poor:\r\n\r\n1) Avatars too close to main column\r\n2)
    Avatar format (square) unsuitable for portraits.\r\n3) Main measure too wide\r\n4)
    Main column flow interrupted by poster names, date, and reply.\r\n5) First post
    type size way too big in comparison to basic text size.\r\n\r\nPlease:\r\n\r\n1)
    Put some space between the avatar and the main column. An asymmetric, modernist
    (flush left) layout needs \"white\" space between elements.\r\n\r\n2) Make the
    avatar shape portrait-proportion, which is natural for the shape of the human
    head.\r\n\r\n3) Reduce the column character-count: typographic wisdom puts a good
    character-count in the 40s, but I'm getting over 100 here, which is severely dysfunctional
    according to most legibility and readability theories, and rarely appears in general
    usage, because it simply does not work.\r\n\r\n4) Move the poster's info under
    his/her avatar icon. That's where it belongs.\r\n\r\n5) Don't put the intial post
    in display-size type. The intial post is not a headline, it is usually a number
    of sentences. That much copy does not belong in display size. It would not even
    be OK for the brief title of the thread to be huge, because with no \"stepping
    stone\" to the main text, the disparity is too great. When headline-size type
    appears in magazines and newspapers, there is usually an intermediary deck."

    If you take a look at the [[Designers]] page, you'll notice that the entries stop
    after [[Boul Yvan]], where if you actually edit the page contents, the entries
    include several designers after that under the 'Z' heading.\r\n\r\nAnother thing
    I noticed is after editing the page and previewing, the changes appear on the

  body: "OK, about the \"access denied\" thing, this is what I have figured out so
    far. It appears that the Wiki is making up incorrect addresses for some of the
    links, and the addresses are case sensitive. For example, when you click on the
    \"Indicies\" link, it uses this address - http://typophile.com/wiki/indices. But
    it should be this - http://typophile.com/wiki/Indices. The difference is the cap
    \"I\" on \"Indices\" in the address.\r\n\r\nAnother example: This link to Blackletter
    - http://typophile.com/wiki/Blackletter, should have a lower case \"b\". So there
    doesen't seem to be any rhyme or reason to the link names case.\r\n\r\nI have
    also found this kind of link - http://typophile.com/wiki/sans%20serif, which dosen't
    work. the \"%20\" part of that address represents a \"space\", so that is OK.
    But if I change the first \"s\" to a \"S\" then it works. Hmmm.\r\n\r\nI have
    also found this oddity. In a Wiki link to a string like \" Barnhart Brothers &
    Spindler\", it will truncate it to \"Barnhart Brothers\", ignoring everthing after
    the \"&\"... sometimes... not all the time.\r\n\r\nI think I understand the -Title
    Link|Title Displayed- syntax, but I don't think everyone gets this. Not everyone
    is going to type -American Type Founders|ATM-. And since there is not a real search
    yet, it is sometimes hard to tell if a Wiki link does not have an entry or if
    it is not linking properlly to an existing entry. I guess we just have to police
    this as best we can to try to avoid multiple entrys."

    gives you two links like this:\r\n\u2022 Designers\r\n\u2022 Designers\r\n\r\nWhen
    I click on the first one, it takes me here: http://typophile.com/node/12016 (Which
    is an \"Access denied\"). You will notice that this is a node that has a number
    instead of an alphanumeric name, so I can\u2018t just manually change the case
    to make it redirect me properly, because I have no idea what the number represents.\r\n\r\nAnd
    when I click on the second link, it takes me here: http://typophile.com/wiki/Designers
    (Which is an \"Access denied\" because the case is wrong)\r\n\r\nIf I fix the
    case, it takes me back to the beginning:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/wiki/designers\r\n\u2022
    Designers\r\n\u2022 Designers\r\n\r\nSo, I am now effectively locked out. I have
    found this in several places so I am not sure if it is a Wiki bug, or if somone
    is making these. But this page: http://typophile.com/wiki/designers doesn't give
    you the option to edit.\r\n\r\n(To whom it may concern, to put my comments in

    section to show up as to posting info:\r\n\r\n1. Put a subhead 'critique' without
    any link.\r\n2. below that have 5 categories: serif, san serif, script and other,

    one section. \r\n\r\nThis way you would probably still have the key infor on the

    the front page. The combining is based on the numbers of postings on these sections.

    Start a new category called Superlists, or Resources, or something to indicate
    that collective lists of favorite Book faces, lists of Humanist Sans, Geometric
    Sans, lists of Fleischmann revivals, Informal scripts, etc. can be found easily
    without archaeology. It could be like FAQ, or part of FAQ, since so many inquiries
    come in along these lines. Typophile is becoming a real hub of typographic wisdom
    thanks to the wiki and the collective knowledge base, so maybe we start archiving
    the non-wiki info somewhere else. \r\n\r\nI like the ideas listed above about
    getting critique to show up at the top level. That is an important area and it's
    getting hidden. Fewer categories though. "

  body: "Oh a few things. (After using the new typophile a while I start to get ideas.)\r\n\r\nMany
    have mentioned that it would be good to have the selection of the thread default
    to the latest posting--or lacking that have the 'page menu' at the top of the
    thread as well as the bottom. \r\n\r\nIn addition to that, it would be good to
    have the category menu visible, so that you could navigate to other categories
    without going back to 'forums'.\r\n\r\nThanks for narrowing the measure of the
    text. It would be still better if reduced by another 20%, according to Bringhurst
    (and me), but it's a lot better now. \r\n\r\nFinally on the issue of contrast,
    which a few people commented on initially. Over-45 year old eyes don't have as
    clear a liquid in them, I believe, which is why brighter light is better for reading
    printed matter then. But I think it also affects perception of contrast. Maybe
    that's why the old geezers like me complain about black against the grey--or is
    it two shades of grey--instead of black on white. Maybe someone who is knowledgeable
    about these things can chime in and correct or confirm my suspicions on this. "

    the standpoint of a new visitor, how are any of the existing indices more descriptive?
    Refer to the sample inquiry, which is a real one from an unrelated thread: \"What
    are some good typefaces for me to set books in for extended reading?\" If I was
    new to Typophile, or had been thwarted in trying to use the wiki, what would be
    an intuitive place to look? Type For Books isn't really a class or style, yet,
    so.... \r\n\r\nIt may be that this is appropriate for regular threads. But when
    questions become FAQs, I think about making the content re-accessible. Even if
    it doesn't end up in the wiki, some way to archive, or refer to, threads that
    address such issues would be nice. Maybe I should switch to firefox so I can use

    unusable. When I click on something it usually gives me an 'access denied' message.
    When I change the case of the letter after the rightmost slash I usually get in
    and see the page. \r\n\r\nThis is truly a 'bug', and it makes the wiki not really
    usable, which is a pity, as it is potentially a very good resource. \r\n\r\nAlso,
    as mentioned before not everything is linked through the indices. When something
    goes out of the 'newly posted' column and is not indexed, where does it go--to
    typowiki heaven? \r\n\r\nIs there an alphabetical listing accessible? It would
    be good if there were. Then people--with instruction--could also create links
    to the indices. The typowiki will really only be useful if it has a good index,
    with everything connected to it.   "

    <em>should</em> work, but i'm not sure if this type of thing works for all users.
    \r\ni think this is very unfortunate that this is happening so much (in some cases
    some users get \"access denied\" when trying to access the wiki start page!) as
    i think it is impeding the wiki to be able to really get off the ground. hopefully
    this can be solved soon... in the meantime, i hate to ask you to be patient, but

    flash-parts) is pretty easy to work around. it isnt microsofts fault and it probably
    wont change, so this may be your best bet.\r\n\r\ni know some big sites who use
    it, so there really shouldnt be a problem with this.\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\nMicrosoft
    have just started to roll out an update that changes the way IE handles ActiveX
    controls:\r\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/ieupdate/\r\n\r\nMS offer a few work arounds,
    but all of them involve altering the way the object tag is written to the page,
    but here is a much easier solution that I came up with:\r\n\r\nCreate a new javascript
    file called, say. ieupdate.js containing the 4 lines of code at the end of this
    post.\r\n\r\nThen, at the bottom of any page containing Flash (or Shockwave, Quicktime
    etc) add a reference to this file:\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"ieupdate.js\"></script>\r\n\r\nAnd
    that is it!\r\n\r\nIt works simply by replacing the contents of the object tag
    with itself. This external rewritting of the tag is enough for IE accept that
    your code doesn't require user activation. The outerHTML feature only works in
    IE, but as IE is the only affected browser that is OK.\r\n\r\nYou could test for
    IE using your favourite method (document.all, etc), and instead of adding it to
    the bottom of the page you could add the code to a window.onload function, depending
    whatever is best for your site.\r\n\r\nIf users have JavaScript turned off then
    your site will work as before.\r\n\r\nHope some people find this useful.\r\n\r\nUseful
    links:\r\nAdobe: Active Content Developer Center\r\nMS: Activating ActiveX Controls\r\n\r\nMark
    Bennett\r\n\r\n==========================\r\nAttach Code\r\n\r\ntheObjects = document.getElementsByTagName(\"object\");\r\nfor
    (var i = 0; i < theObjects.length; i++) {\r\ntheObjects[i].outerHTML = theObjects[i].outerHTML;\r\n}"

    on the top, making it scroll down annoyingly. Just a cosmetic thing, but nevertheless...\r\n\r\nAnd
    it seems that the large version of the T-logo on the frontpage, has a strange
    indent on the left side?\r\n\r\nFF 2.0.0.4 on WinXP.\r\n\r\nAnd after you post
    a message, the forum returns to the first page of a multi-page thread. I believe
    this was also the case with the previous forum, and it is annoying as hell. It
    should return to the message you just posted, or at least the last page.\r\n\r\n"

    it. That one has an indent on the left, the line is not straight."

  body: "Firebug's Net profiler shows the pages are weighing around 150KB. Considering
    the images and Flash elements, it's a good measure. I think some simple adjustments
    can improve this website's performance and especially its loading time <em>perception</em>.\r\n\r\nFor
    instance, instead of having 10 separate small CSS files, merge them into a single
    file. Too many requests bog down the server.\r\n\r\nThe Flash masthead and title
    are taking too long to show up on page. JQuery's $(document).ready is being used,
    but I think it's worth trying a regular <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag at the
    bottom of the page (before <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code>) instead. I've come to the
    conclusion that this is the best way to ensure the fastest initialization of JS-generated
    elements on page.\r\n\r\n-- <a href=\"http://www.omine.net/\">omine.net</a>"
