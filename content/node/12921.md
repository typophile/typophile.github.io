  this incredible foreign film, called A Tale of Two Sisters, based on a Korean folk
  tale. This movie was infinitely better that any of the recent crop of Asian Cinema
  remakes. I almost had, and I mean HAD, to hit the power button on my dvd player
  a couple of times. Also better than Ju-On, and it's remake The Grudge. Genuinely
  classy, creepy and scary, all in the right places.\r\n\r\nCiao"

    movies (mostly Korean) on weekend nights and I was pleasantly surprised by their
    quality. The stories may be familiar but the way they are visualized is just awesome.\r\nToo
    bad that the regular channels don't carry many Korean movies. "

    up for a scary flick. Interesting side note: the <a href="http://www.netflix.com/MovieDisplay?movieid=70020305">poster
    (cover?) looks a bit different on Netflix</a>. I guess it makes sense: bloody
    vs. not bloody = Korean vs. American (we like the killing, but don''t want anyone
    to see it...?).'

    guys seen \"301/302\"? That story was definitely <strong>not</strong> \"familiar\"!

  body: hooray for foreign films! if only hollywood were so good. i watched "Shall
    We Dance?" again this weekend with the folks -- the Japanese version. I'm almost
    afraid to watch the hollywood version to see what they've done to it. i myself
    am a bollywood fanatic. for a good B horror movie with great music and dance sequences
    you gotta watch "Gumnaam," part of which is featured in the opening of "Ghost
    World."

    de Deus</i>). It's incredible.\r\n\r\nHrant, I try to watch Korean TV at home,
    but then my wife throws things at me. Same goes for the Spanish-language station."

  body: "crugen,\r\n\r\nThe standard WS edition was toned down, the 'super special
    extended immaculately conceived ultra high-res super-duper extra-bloody' edition
    has blood on it, like its Korean counterpart.\r\n\r\nI got confused for a minute,
    I thought the bloody one was for the US release. It's usually the other was around
    tho, isn't it ? Don't we usually get smacked with the dumbed down version of things,
    other than vice versa.  The cover was one of the reasons I picked it up. Non-bloody
    version. Just seemed to have a little more of a 'what is happening in this picture'
    feel about it.\r\n\r\nSeems stronger message wise to not have the blood. Hmm?\r\n\r\nLet
    me know how you like it ...\r\n\r\nOh, and BTW, that new film 'Dark Water' w/Jennifer
    Connolly, is also a remake."

  body: "Interesting. I guess I assumed that because I've gotten screwed by U.S. rental
    and retail video chains renting/selling the not-very-clearly-indicated edited/censored
    versions of foreign films and not even offering the full versions.\r\n\r\nThough,
    now that I think about it, it's really the sexual content that gets snipped out.
    Which is true over all U.S. media. I should've guessed.\r\n\r\n(I'm also resentful
    of the coverage of the Iraq war, so that's the big reason for my little gripe.)"

    cinemas, including</strong> A tale of two sisters.\r\n<strong> One I would highly
    recommend is </strong>Old Boy<strong> by </strong>Chan-wook Park<strong>. It's
    one of the weirdest, strongest, most beautiful and disgusting films I've seen
    in years (and come to think of it, </strong>Santa Sangre<strong> was mainly just
    disgusting with a dash of weird, in comparison). \r\nIt's supposed to be the second
    movie in a vengeance trilogy, and friends tell me the first part, </strong> Sympathy
    for Mr vengeance <strong> is even better, but I somehow find that hard to believe.

  body: "They say that there are two kinds of censorship for films in Korea; one for
    home consumption, the other for foreign. A theory has it that the censorship actually
    contributed to enforcing the people to visualize or to extend those parts that
    had been cut off, which explains well some of the success of Korean films that
    they enjoy these days. For Koreans had been trained en masse in audio-visual communications
    in that way for some decades.\r\n\r\nJust kidding."
