body: "Hi Philes!\r\n\r\nI've been working on a brand refresh for a company focused
  on fashion entertainment.\r\nThe original logo was perfect for at startup at that
  time, but their strategy has changed alot since then... and therefore a logo-update
  has become a hot topic :-)\r\n\r\nThe logo is loosly based on some spikes seen in
  Tryon Park in New York, where the founders got the idea for the company.\r\n\r\nThe
  problem with the current logo is alignment-issues, not very legible in small sizes
  and lack of character - especially in B/W... and so on.\r\nI've included some excerpts
  from the presentation.\r\n\r\nAnywhooo... I've recently presented a new redesign
  which they love and we are starting to plan the roll out of the identity.\r\nThe
  new design is more simple and with respect to the original idea.\r\n \r\nBut I'd
  really like your input on how to properly set some guidelines for this logo - I
  mean, how to set some rules for the individual sizes of symbol and logotype? Until
  now I've only done this by eye and simple guides - and the client is requesting
  a mini brand manual now and my experience is rather vague.\r\n\r\nSo please guide
  me you cool type-people :-)\r\n\r\nThanks!!\r\n\r\n/S\r\n"

  body: I think that logo design is important and its update is also necessary.Good
    logos appeal client a lot.A little home work is also important.Correct logo size
    and make a new one if required.

  body: "> the client is requesting a mini brand manual \r\n\r\nIf you Google \"Brand
    Manual\" (or similar phrases) you should be able to find some examples in PDF
    format, although they may be more detailed than you need.\r\n\r\nIt may help if
    you consider what the manual will be used for. If your client will be using people
    with design training to put together their pieces, you might be able to rely on
    their training and good judgement and focus on factual issues such as the fonts,
    colors, general look of the pieces, etc.  \r\n\r\nBut if it's to help people with
    NO design training to put pieces together (for example if a secretary is asked
    to create a booklet) then you need to give more detailed instructions to avoid
    them making beginner's mistakes (don't make the logo too small, keep some blank
    space around it, don't put it on a patterned background, use a white logo if on
    a dark background, etc.).\r\n\r\n> how to set some rules for the individual \r\n>
    sizes of symbol and logotype? \r\n\r\nThis is largely determined by the designer's
    judgement. All  you can do is create some general guidelines and show examples
    for common situations. If you find some PDFs of other manuals that might help.\r\n\r\n>
    B/W version not dynamic\r\n\r\nWell you could make it grayscale to get the overlap
    effect, but I wouldn't worry too much about the black-and-white version unless
    your client is still printing a lot of booklets that way. In the past a b&w version
    was extremely important, but it's less so today since so much communication is
    via the internet, PDFs, emails, and other situations where color is free."

  body: "I know B&W is still important for social media sites, as an example, because
    a lot of other websites link to them, and often use a custom webfont with social
    media logos to do so. Since the twitter bird is just one color, it easily looks
    good as white on black, black on white, or in the traditional blue.\r\n\r\nI like
    the all-red logo, especially because of the bigger negative space / outline in
    the middle of it. Hate how the other one was pencil thin. And I like that it's
    all red too, looks nice in B&W, and it sort of looks like a dinosaur footprint
    which makes me extremely happy. (I'm going to go ahead and assume the company
    makes dinosaur skeletons for museums) :)"

  body: Banjo, I don't understand the need for b&w for social media. Do any social
    media sites require b&w images? And a custom web font wouldn't contain the original
    poster's logo anyway. Maybe I'm misunderstanding your post.
