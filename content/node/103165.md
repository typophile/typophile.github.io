body: "In the course of time I have posted some info on my PhD research titled <em>Harmonics,
  Patterns, and Dynamics in Formal Typographic Representations of the Latin Script
  | The regularization, standardization, systematization, and unitization of roman
  and italic type since their Renaissance origin until the Romain du Roi</em> on this
  forum. Based on my more recent \uFB01ndings I now think it\u2019s possible that
  movable type was developed as a \u2018font format\u2019, in which different horizontal
  and vertical dynamics and dimensions for (different point sizes of) Gothic and roman
  type were captured in (geometric) models and in which intelligence was put in (the
  proportions and related spacing of) punches and matrices to make the cutting, striking,
  justi\uFB01cation and casting as simple as possible. This also would have made the
  distribution of roman and italic type all over Europe easier.\r\n\r\nThere is ample
  proof that the font technology developed in the 1970s and 1980s at for instance
  URW and Adobe is the result of a cooperation/interaction between type designers
  and software developers. That probably also has been the case at other companies
  involved in font-technology development. Perhaps movable type was the result of
  a comparable interaction between artists, i.e. calligraphers, and craftsmen, i.e.
  engravers and gold smiths too.\r\n\r\nI think it\u2019s quite plausible that different
  type design and production methods, basically the one that \u2018relies on the eye\u2019
  and the forenamed \u2018systematized\u2019 one, were used besides each other in
  Renaissance Italy, but that Jenson\u2019s (production) model became dominant because
  it was adapted by Griffo and subsequently copied by Garamont. Nowadays we mostly
  think of this trio as excellent \u2018type designers\u2019, but in their times their
  types must have been especially very practical to (re)produce by the endusers.\r\n\r\nAt
  the <a href=\"http://www.tagderschrift.org\">Tag der Schrift</a> at the Berufsschule
  f\xFCr Gestaltung Z\xFCrich on 25 May I will elaborate on this \u2018font format\u2019
  hypothesis. For those who are interested, I have made the <a href=\"http://www.lettermodel.org/downloads/Mythical_Eye_Zurich.pdf\">slides</a>
  already available for downloading.\r\n\r\nFEB\r\n"

    great natural sense. And that document is wonderful - thank you for posting it.
    Maybe a voice recording could accompany it one day?  :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    his attempt to mistify the quality...\"; \"mistify\" probably should be spelled
    \"mystify\".\r\n\r\nPage 68: \"...its own tail. To able to use one's...\" should
    read \"...its own tail. To <strong>be</strong> able to use one's...\".\r\n\r\nI
    think Hrant's suggestion for audio is great. I would love to hear the presentation
    accompanying this document. Thanks for posting it."
