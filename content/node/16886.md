    Compacta.\r\n\r\nThat T is bugging me - it needs a serif on the crossbar."

  body: 'Listen think about this: Professional Teams make a ton of money on marketing
    their logos on merchandise. A good example is The New York Giants brought back
    a retro jersey that was red (last worn in 1952), why to sell retro jerseys for
    the Holiday Season. The New York Giants are known as big blue. So if you are going
    to have a propriority look it pays to make everything custom. This also allows
    your team of lawyers to sue anyone who uses the logo or mark without paying big
    fees. Its all about money.'
