  was quite old and I presumed that it would go unnoticed. Anyway for Hrant, Brainskywalker,
  Roger Waters and others, I would really appreciate it if more feedback is given
  on the newly added lowercase to my typeface. \r\n\r\nI am attaching the new pdf
  with the designed characters along with some sample text.\r\n\r\nYour feedback is
  extremely valuable and will help me progress further as it did previously.\r\n\r\nTo

    but then also probably the cap height).\r\n\r\nThe \"Q\" is too brutish.\r\n\r\nThe
    \"S\" and \"s\" need more weight in the spine than the rest.\r\n\r\nThe \"g\"
    is too heavy at the bottom.\r\n\r\nI like the \"?\", but the \"&\" is malformed.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Thanks Hrant. I agree with you mostly and will make the required changes and
    keep you updated, but concerning the 'Q' it would be better if you could point
    out as to which specific option do you think needs work and should be worked on.

  body: "Cum grano salis:\r\n\r\nSpecially your \xAB&\xBB needs more overshoot, but
    in general the entire lowercase lacks of it.\r\n\xABv\xBB,\xABw\xBB, \xABy\xBB,
    etc. need <em>optical</em> correction, and that is, making the right stem a bit
    thinner than the opposing left stem to make them <em>look</em> equally thick.\r\nThe
    crossbars in \xABt\xBB and \xABf\xBB could be a tad thinner.\r\n\xABc\xBB is too
    wide.\r\nI'd take Option D for that \xABQ\xBB, but the tail could be shorter.\r\nOption
    A for the sake of \xABk\xBB!\r\n\r\nKeep on polishing that letters! :-)"

  body: Even thought the ampersand have some style I think he needs attention. He
    looks a bit squeeze like somebody in a too small coat or it seems a bit intimidated.
    The top is too big and the bottom too small. It also could be a bit larger.

  body: "The update you've done looks better, but I think the problem comes from the
    axe of your ampersand. It seems to fall on the right side. Also, the oblique is
    too short, or the bottom should be lower than the baseline. Sorry I can't insert
    an image :-/ \r\n\r\n"

    much better. Thank you again!"

  body: It is hard to see any changes with this kind of image. On my side I still
    see an oblique axe on both ampersand. I suggest to you to work on other letters
    you will probably understand what I mean on the next time you will see it. I think
    you have to work a bit on the counter of the D, looks how you've drawn the RBP
    counter and do something similar to the D. Those one have a short straight line
    on the left side of the stem at the top and bottom of the counter, however the
    one in the D starts to bend quickly. Keep going.

    in my font and also added numbers and other punctuation marks. It would be really
    kind of all of you if you could spare some time and go through the newly attached
    pdf and suggest further changes or anything that you might feel is not working
    or is not right.\r\n\r\nP.S. I am still unsure about the 'Q' so I have filled
    in the previous one for the time being.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nManushi \r\n"
