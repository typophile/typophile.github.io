  for. This project has gone through a long and sometimes tedious process and at this
  point I'm having some trouble looking at it with the proper perspective. \r\n\r\nThere's
  no room for major changes at this point, but I think I could use some fresh eyes
  to help me with the kerning of the letters. \r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_6147.jpg]"

    be a little bit smaller. But not needed per s\xE9."

    comes down to preference at this stage in a project.\r\n\r\nSafe. :)\r\n"

  body: "I agree with the others - a tiny bit of overall tracking.\r\nIndividual kerning
    is hard for me to determine on the computer screen ... and I don't have a printer
    at the moment ... but it seems that you have done a fairly good job with the kerning."
