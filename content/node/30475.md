    lettered.

    with illustration. It does remind me of an ITC font though which perhaps was based
    on this period lettering.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "The single-storey 'a' is the feature all of these suggestions fail to include.
    I skimmed McGrew's book of Metal Typefaces, and found an old BB&S/ATF face called
    'Pastel' that has the right 'a', and has some versions with a similar 'g'. The
    long tail on the 'y' is not typical of many of the other types from this period,
    and it is longer than Pastel's, but generally shaped the same. I suggest that
    a metal face like Pastel was probably the model for this hand-drawn lettering.\r\n\r\nAs
    for an available digital face, Nick Curtis's fonts, both free and commercial,
    would be good places to look.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    by Ray Larabie.\r\n\r\nThat might work as a substitute for this lettering.\r\n\r\n-

  body: For a similar "feel", see what you think of David Nalle's <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/scriptorium/buccaneer/"
    target="_blank">Buccaneer</a>. It's based on the hand lettering of <a href="http://www.eldrbarry.net/rabb/pyle/pyle.htm"

    item.
