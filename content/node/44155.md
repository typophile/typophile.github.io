  body: Hmm, hard one. When I first saw it I had a feeling it could be the beautiful
    [[http://www.psyops.com/html/spec_eideticneopro.html|Eidetic Neo]] from [[PSY/OPS]]
    by Rodrigo Cavazos but that was also wrong even though it has some similarities.

  body: Yes, it is hard. It is "almost" like several fonts that I have found, but
    just not there. It is a pretty font, though. I would love to own it...but I need
    to know what it is first!

  body: Hi,before buying it you might have a close look at the "z". At least on my
    screen it looks like it is tumbling down.

  body: "I think that the \"z\" is only a screen rendering issue. It seems as if it
    was scanned a little bit rotated.\r\n\r\nStrange that nobody knows this font."

  body: "This reminds me of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/tema-cantante/|Tema
    Cantate]] from T-26. If someone tried to make this font more conventional, it
    would have been more like the sample. \r\n\r\nIt also reminds me of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/atbritannia-bold/|Britannia]]
    in some ways. \r\n\r\nI am finding that the ability to search for 'semiserif'
    or 'semisans' is rather poor at the usual font sites.\r\n\r\nThe fact we have
    not found this yet means either that Angel is away from his computer, and/or this
    is from a pretty obscure source, possibly a freebie font.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
