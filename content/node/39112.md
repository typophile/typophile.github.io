body: "I don't know if anyone else noticed but today saw a phenomenal release of type
  news and marketing. In one day, I received an email from FontShop promoting the
  gorgeous new [[http://www.fontshop.com/features/newsletters/nov2007_a/ | FF Meta
  Serif]] (congratulations to Erik Spiekermann, Christian Schwartz, and Kris Sowersby),
  an email from House Industries noting that its new [[http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=619
  | Neutraface Complete]] is on sale until December 1, an email from Veer for Alejandro
  Paul's new [[http://www.veer.com/ideas/feelscript/| Feel Script]], an email from
  ITC for its (questionably useful) [[http://www.itcfonts.com/Fonts/NewFonts/2007/1107_Intro.htm?osadcampaign=IMP
  | ITC Intro]], as well as an email about the release of [[http://www.fontlab.com/font-converter/scanfont/
  | ScanFont 5.0]] for Windows.\r\n\r\nIt either means that Wednesdays are good days
  to release type news or that font serendipity is a real thing. Or, perhaps, I've
  subscribed to too many type email newsletters and haven't noticed the confluence
  before.\r\n\r\nMostly, I wonder, what do folks think of FF Meta Serif? To me, it
  is lovingly crafted and will be a strong addition to my serif collection."
