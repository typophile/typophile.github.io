  I'm working on (a magazine focused mainly on stories and opinion but also with short
  news, let's say in a 70/30% proportion). A sidenote: I'm not the graphic designer,
  guess I'm the \"creator\". \r\nSince I spend most of my days reading, print and
  on screen, I really like looking at good typograpghy and even if I'm waaaaay far
  from being an expert, I'd like to choose a bunch of typefaces myself and then discuss
  with the graphic designer. \r\nAnyway, I'd like to use a sans for titles/headlines
  and a serif for long text. The layout is clean, with colors and composition vaguely
  inspired to the 60-70s italian and european magazines, but It looks like a website,
  so It's not \"old\" or \"vintage\".\r\n\r\nThe ideal combo for me would be Founders
  Grotesk (Klim) or Akkurat (Lineto) for headlines and Tiempos (Klim) or Publico (Commercial
  Type) for text. But sadly Founders, Tiempos and Akkurat are not available for web
  use, and Commercial Type has not live preview. \r\nWich fonts are valid alternatives
  for web use? That's the question. \r\n\r\nI narrowed to FF Bau (and as last choice
  FF Dagny, wich is good but too \"impersonal\") for headlines + FF Milo, FF Spinoza,
  FF Tundra or FF Qadraat for text ( I do not work for FF: it's only they have a pricing
  policy I can afford and let you test webfonts live).\r\nHere comes the question
  for you wonderful people: \r\nHow would you combine them? \r\nWould you suggest
  other grotesk (or halfway between grotesk and more cold typefaces, like Akkurat)
  and other serif wich have a good (and I mean it: it has to be legible even with
  XP) web version, don't look too informal but still have personality?\r\nThanks,
  a lot. (And sorry for language mistakes)"

    long text will not be very pleasant to read. Georgia is still a good free option,
    so is Droid Serif (I might be the only typographer who likes it though). \r\n\r\nFrom
    the paid pool of web serifs for body copy, I like [[http://www.fontbureau.com/ReadingEdge/|Benton
    Modern RE and Ibis RE]] best. They cost $40 per style per year but you can go
    a long way with just one or two of them. And they can also be tested for free
    or try an existing site with their [[http://www.webtype.com/tools/swapper/|swapper
    tool]]. Both combine well with FF Bau or Dagny, which I both like very much too."

  body: "@Indra: Thanks for your comment. The rendering of the fonts, especially with
    XP, was actually my concern: about the font size, I will not go under 16px, everything
    under is very hard to read for average user (me). And yes, Georgia is still a
    good option. Just wondering if there's something wich can really compete, and
    I found that it's possible: fonts like Fedra, Tisa, Adelle, Chaparral, Ernestine
    looks surprisingly good even with Xp (at 14-16px). And so perform the FF serif
    I mentioned, wich I found better suit for my needs (questionable, but still my
    needs).\r\nI understood the Reading Edge webfonts are amongst the best you can
    find in this moment, they look stunning, I tested them and the quality is surprising.
    But they are too expensive for me right now (let's say $40 x 4 styles, normal
    and bold, it's 160/year: for that price I could buy once and forever 4 licenses
    for web from other services). \r\nBy the way, I discovered Bau reading your post
    on Fonts in Use about True Type of the Bauhaus, and since then it was my first
    choice. So, again, thank you. \r\n\r\n@oldnick: Hi, never questioned hrant and
    Indra know what they're saying: it's to have opinion from people like them I posted

    ironic, i was meaning I'm not the one who actually \"do things\", but since I
    pay someone, I'm trying to avoid being served with the old package Arial/Georgia
    like it's the best deal ever.\r\nAnd yes, about fonts I'm a primadonna: i simply
    can't stand bad typography since I become almost blind in years squeezing my eyes
    infront of a monitor ;-)\r\n\r\n"

    XP? After all, the default setting for XP is greyscale/binary and Reading Edge
    looks horrible under those circumstances. The same goes for most of the others.

    use the default setting one way or another (new OS, IE updates etc) is decreasing
    and shortly will no longer be a concern. The quality of webfonts will, even when
    XP will disappear. \r\n\r\nI still live in an XP world, 12 hours a day at office.
    In the years I've worked with a lot of people who never switched on ClearType
    until someone had told them Clear Type existed; who genuinely don't care what
    they're reading as far as they understand what's written; who don't realize that
    the font they have been reading for months suddenly changes. But nowdays, in the
    era of the \"webfont revolution\", when they came across website sporting poor
    quality web typography, you can hear them scream. ClearType or not. You simply
    can't understand what's written. \r\n\r\nSo I was wondering if there are real
    alternatives to Georgia (still looks amazing on screen) and Arial (don't, but
    it's familiar to users) wich don't cut out XPers from reading until XP disappear.
    I found a number of very well done webfonts which do look good even under XP,
    like hran said. Asked if there are others and how you would combine them. I see
    there's so much more under the surface... \r\n\r\nAnyway, here's some screenshots
    of serifs in small size under XP (first image is the original, second Georgia.
    Then the webfonts). \r\n\r\nThey all look very good to me.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/xp-original_3570.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/xp-georgia_4334.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/xp-webfont-benton_6075.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/xp-webfont-milo_5036.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/xp-webfont-quadraat_4126.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/xp-webfont-spinoza_4449.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/xp-webfont-tundra_3665.jpg]"
