    <BR>As the concept &#34;flash&#34; is owned by macromedia there you will never
    find a program that can create .swf files and is as powerful as flash is today.
    <BR> <BR>You can also check out SVG... <BR> <BR>/f <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>

  body: Adobe once had a program, but that is discontinued. I have a notion, though,
    that it won&#39;t be the last time Adobe will try to underminde Macromedia here..
    it must irk them to no end that in THIS design area, another company holds a semi-monopol.  <BR>
    <BR>Corel, as far as I know, has a tool, but that is rather miserable, from what
    I hear.  <BR> <BR>Freehand can do very simple swfs, but these are only okay for
    simple animations &#40;which is what some illustrators use it for, as the layer-technique
    s very similar to Photoshop and traditional animatoion, so they&#39;re used to
    it... also the editing tools are better than in Flash&#41;.  <BR> <BR>And finally,
    there is Swish, which started as a simple text-animationtool but has pretty much
    evolved and nowadays can do some stuff. It&#39;s nowhere near as powerful as Flash
    is, especially when it comes to scripting &#40;which is the key to making solid
    Flash-websites, without Action Script you don&#39;t get anywhere&#41;. However,
    I really like SwishMax as a simple presentation tool or for online banners and
    all that, as the interface is simpler and the everyday stuff, like fades and so
    on&#41;, is quicker done. It&#39;s not a professional tool, at only 99 $ it doesn&#39;t
    have to be, but simpler stuff is quickly done here and the new version actually
    offers pretty solid typography, alas nowhere near the real typo capabilities of
    flash &#40;which still are lightyears behind Photoshop or InDesign or even Freehand&#41;.

  body: You can also make simple animated GIFs with Fireworks, which may be more your
    style, because it is &#34;frame by frame&#34; rather than &#34;timelines&#34;
    &#40;I&#39;m talking about v.3, which is what I use, so I hope it hasn&#39;t changed
    hugely&#41;. Also the final files are really small, and don&#39;t need plug-ins
    to play back, so ideal for banners.

  body: Thanks for the suggestions. I did look into Adobe&#39;s LiveMotion, but since
    they discontinued it, I&#39;d rather not trot down that path. <BR> <BR>There are
    several reasons I&#39;ve grown to dislike Flash &#40;in my limited time using
    it&#41;. One &#34;for instance&#34; is it&#39;s inability to properly display
    imported &#40;bitmap&#41; images. I cannot find a way to make it NOT compress
    them. If I have a 1px white line on a black background, imported into Flash, I
    want that 1px white line to look like a 1px white line. Flash always seems to
    want to compress it and make it look antialiased. <BR> <BR>That is, perhaps, a
    clumsy example, since I could just make a line in Flash itself... but what if
    I don&#39;t want to? <BR> <BR>Another reason I&#39;d like to find an alternative,
    is because I&#39;ve grown used to Adobe AfterEffect&#39;s interpolations techniques
    &#40;since I have a background in video&#41;. The way Flash &#34;tweens&#34; between
    keyframes is really clunky. Maybe I just don&#39;t know enough, but I&#39;ve spent
    hours in this program trying to learn it... you&#39;d think I&#39;da figured it
    out by now. <BR> <BR>Anyway... I appreciate the suggestions. I&#39;ll have a look.
    &#40;I have a feeling I&#39;ll be waiting for another program to be introduced.&#41;

  body: Yes, flash has some issues with bitmaps. <BR>Some tips though. <BR> <BR>Make
    sure your images top-left corner is on a even pixel. Use the propertiesarea to
    manually set the bitmap position to a non decimal number. Also make sure that
    the numbers starts from top-left and not the center. You control that with the
    square with nine subsquares inside.  <BR> <BR>Well anyway flash has a really really
    steep learningcurve. I have worked with it since version 2 and there are still
    things that I learn &#40;if you except the scripting wich I never will learn good
    enough&#41;. <BR> <BR>/fredde

  body: Flash can be off-putting. But you just have to understand how it works with
    Vectors and Bitmaps. Each image CAN have its own compression &#40;in library &#62;
    symbol properties&#41;. Because flash is a scalable format, like Fredrik said,
    your pixel line was not snapped to a pixel. <BR> <BR>Overall it&#39;s quite a
    sensible application. These aren&#39;t bugs in the program, just misunderstandings,
    don&#39;t treat it like a graphics app. <BR> <BR>&#62;<i>The way Flash &#34;tweens&#34;
    between keyframes is really clunky.</i> <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t tween in Flash. <BR>

    </i> <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t make me laugh. I&#39;ve spent 5 years in this program
    and still don&#39;t understand a lot of it. Just stick with it, and in a few weeks
    you&#39;ll be flying. I think it would be a waste of time trying other applications,
    cos you&#39;ll reach a stage where you can&#39;t go any further, then you&#39;ll
    be forced to start learning Flash from the beginning. There are plenty of websites
    and tutorials for learning.

    navigation available while also provides a breadcrumb trail. Good thinking. <BR>
    <BR>But after briefly looking at your personal site I have to say who needs flash?
    ;&#41; You&#39;ve got your external content loading without a page refresh and
    alpha fades between images. That&#39;s nice, but of course for the really fancy
    stuff flash is still handy. Anyway, that looks like some nice work you have on
    your site, I&#39;ll probably take a little time to look through it more.

    <BR>Well, it would take me a long time to talk about how it was built. As soon
