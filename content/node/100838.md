body: "Hi everybody\r\n\r\nthis is my first spot and I am new to the forum. I am designing
  a typeface in Fontlab. I export the font and it looks great both in Fontlab and
  in Suitcase Fusion. But when I try and use it in Illustrator, when I zoom out the
  counters and bowls look weird, as if they are a bit offset upwards or downwards.
  \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Zoom33_4892.png]\r\nthis image shows the
  screen in illustrator at 33% zoom. The top one is the written and the bottom one
  outlined.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Zoom100_4344.png]\r\nthis image
  shows the screen at 100%. Both look right.\r\n\r\nCan anyone help me on this?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!\r\n\r\n"

    body: "Oldnick, great advice!\r\n\r\nEliason, I think you are right. It must be
      a problem caused by autohinting. I haven't got time at the moment to fix it,
      but I did alter something and reexported the font and it did look different.
      I will try tomorrow and fix it.\r\n\r\nNathaniel, are you sure there is such
      a dropdown selection in illustrators' character palette? There is one in photoshop.\r\n\r\nThank
      you all for your support."

        an issue with autohinting, but most \"pro\" typefaces I've used in Illustrator
        all exhibit the same wonky features when zoomed out; even Helvetica Neue looks
        like a jokey clown font at 33%. Setting it to crisp, however, makes it a lot
        more pleasant on the eyes."

  body: "I find Illustrator doesn't handle the hinting all too well, but even if text
    gets a little wonky when zoomed out, it should still print fine.\r\n\r\nIn your
    character panel, if you open up the advanced settings, there's a drop down with
    some options to set the anti-aliasing methods. Setting things to \"crisp\" tends
    to emulate print output in my eyes, and usually corrects those odd counter issues
    when zoomed out."

  body: "Hi Nathaniel! You got me there! It's really there! Haha... and I keep telling
    myself that I know my whereabouts in illustrator pretty well! Indeed, there is
    a big difference when I set it to crisp - it all becomes normal. However, I think
    I will take the hard way and try and work on the hinting of the font, since I
    want other people to use it as well. \r\n\r\nI will keep you posted."
