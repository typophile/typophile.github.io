  I am obsessed with handwriting, especially knowing that we've preserved the actual
  handwriting of some of the greats of history.\r\n\r\nI have started making jewelry
  from these historical icon's handwriting, and have found many of the people requesting
  their own are fellow typophiles and history buffs. I'd love to know what you guys
  think - what font/word would you wear?\r\n\r\nHere's a pic of a Jane Austen pendant
  I made: http://imgur.com/a/mSRHR#0\r\n\r\nHappy to post my website here, too, upon
  request, but I don't want to be spammy. \r\n\r\nThanks, guys!"

    cheap, so I'd use helvetica thin;)\r\n\r\nBTW, are you making the molds from digital
    files, by hand or some combination? "

    handwriting. Maybe autographs made into jewelry would be more commercially viable.\r\n\r\n>
    what font/word would you wear?\r\n\r\nI think it's mostly guys here, and the market
    for this is probably women."

  body: "@James - Tolkien and Austen have been huge, actually. People really connect
    with those two authors. Tons of guys (not enough!) recognize their wife's/girlfriend's
    favorite author, buy as a gift for birthdays or anniversaries. \r\n\r\n@Icharo
    - Ha, Helvetica thin is a great pick. I'd create a 3d-printable file on my computer
    of whatever you'd pick, print it, and then assemble it. It's fun! Does that answer
    your question?"

    serif or even Egyptian for 'em. (Just don't use the free font called \"Nashville.\"
    Anything but that.)\r\n\r\nAlso, Walden fonts has a lot of historic signature
    fonts if you're looking for that. http://www.waldenfont.com/product.asp?productid=1"
