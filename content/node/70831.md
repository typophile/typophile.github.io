body: What font is this? http://twitpic.com/1rpn6y - I love the perfect 'O'. Closest
  I could find was Faricy(?). Not Gotham or Futura. my best guess now is a classic
  grotesk, but the G is throwing me.

  body: The variance in widths doesn't say "classic grotesk." It's somewhat close
    to Gill Sans Light, though the R-leg, for one detail, is different.

    similar to this came up a few months ago, and we couldn't find an exact match.\r\n\r\nAlternative:
    Nobel from Font Bureau"

  body: Thank you. I know the land for the park was acquired in 1941 as a federal
    work relief program. The park board built a multi-purpose recreation center where
    this sign is hanging in 1969.

  body: Whoever fashioned these metal letters was probably inspired by Sol Hess. Most
    of the letters follow the basic pattern of <strong>Twentieth Century</strong>,
    and the anomalous G takes its cues from <strong>Twentieth Century Poster</strong>.
    I can't find a ready reference for the release dates of these typefaces. but Hess
    died in 1953 at age 67.
