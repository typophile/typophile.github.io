  Contextual Alternates in flash? Is there a possibility to implement OpenType in
  Flash or do I have to do it with Actionscript? And can I somehow use these Contextual
  Alternates in Flash?\r\nI am trying to do something like this in flash:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.underware.nl/site2/index.php?id1=liza&id2=test\r\n\r\nThanks

    OpenType functionality currently supported can be leveraged using the classes
    in the [[http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/3/langref/flash/text/engine/package-detail.html|flash.text.engine]]
    package.\r\n\r\nIf you haven't done so yet, try the [[http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/textlayout/demos/|Text
    Layout Demo App]]. The TLF team has recently made available its [[http://blogs.adobe.com/tlf/2009/12/new-and-updated-tlf-samples.html|source
