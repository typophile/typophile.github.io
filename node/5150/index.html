It's got a bit of a modern feel to it, yet it fits in with the typical McMansion development logo style (as to not scare away the jones's).  <BR> <BR>The bottom 3 are nice, but just not doing it for me.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree with Kirsten, however If you are going to engrave this typeface you would would most likely want a clean version of it. Or If you like the distressed look, distress it yourself. It just seems funny when the R's are distressed in the exact same way. IMPO distressed types should only be distressed when the paper or other printing medium unintentionally distresses them. There is nothing wrong with a beautiful, confident, classical, and perfectly set serif typeface.(Maybe a BEMBO) <BR> <BR>Also certain faces would look better in wood and certain faces would look better in stone. <BR> <BR>An important question would be: <BR> <BR>Have they developed a style guideline for the development or are homeowners going to be able to build whatever they like (modern or classic)? <BR>  <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Scott, <BR> <BR>Oh man, can I relate to this! Its a tall order creating something appealing based on a mirage that has nothing to do with anything. I've done more than my fair share of these new housing development brochures. Two months ago I did one called Vintage Ranch. Predictably, it wound up having a nostalgic barn thing happening. The logo was modeled after antiquated fruit packing lables. All in all it worked out fine, but everyone knows they are being sold a bill of goods when they are selecting Floorplan 4 with the &quot;spanish&quot; detailing package.  <BR> <BR>All that aside, I agree that what you've got going in #2 has the most potential. It works well with the weather vane too (solid version). If you do decide to go with this, note the distortion/color issue from stretching the W (R looks ok). <BR> <BR>Do the flooplans have names?  <BR>If so would you share them with us, just for laughs. :-) <BR>They might also give you imagery ideas. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR>Randy</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Scott, gotta hand it to you&hellip;you did find some beautiful imagery of tractors. But I agree with Steve in that it says farm products rather than luxury homes. And I'm not sure the bucolic charm from the photos would translate into the stone or wood applications. The weather vane is working. Have you considered having the name as part of the weather vane itself? (W for West W for Winsor)Especially on the next to last design where the letters are right reading. It might be tricky at the crossover point, but it could be worth the exploration. Also what kind of architectural style will the buildings be following? Is there any inspiration that could be pulled from that?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I like them both, and I like the colors.  <BR> <BR>What I think helps tie the image and the type together on the first design is that the letters in the weather vane and the Windsor name are the same font. Did you try using the condensed slab characters for the NSEW letters on the second design? <BR> <BR>What I believe adds to the &quot;Marlboro&quot; look of the second design is the large W and R. What if the letters were one size? but then FARMS might need to be re-thought since it would no longer tuck in. Hmm, perhaps if FARMS were set as wide as WINSOR it might make the type block appear to be the coupola the weather vane is attached to. Then agin it might look too heavy.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Scott, I think the bottom of the two makes more of a statement. The type is more architectural and strong. The only thing I wonder is if you could alter the cap W to be a little more open, the bottom legs are kinda heavy, they don't balance out with the cap R which feels lighter. Not 100% positive, but it seems that most housing developments I've noticed seem to be trying to be posh or elegant &hellip; we're just too close to mountains. Exclusive can't be stated in more ways than just white space and thin serifs.  <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>I should add that it doesn't mean that there are posh or elegant people here, it just means that it really doesn't fit the landscape.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">LOL - I am currently going through a similar situation with a bunch of patio homes called Carrington Greene. We actually have input into street names too. I have a small but vocal rally for Alexis Way, Blake Court and Crystal Boulevard&hellip; just too dang funny! I think I will post where I am so far with that. Its really funny because the agent who sells them likes one logo, the owner likes another and the owner's wife likes the third one! Where do I keep finding these people?!?! <BR> <BR>all kidding aside, scott - I think its a very nice identity and I especially think you have presented it well in your standards manual I hope you can post a photo of the entryway when its all done to see how it works as 3-d elements. I am currently also working with a shopping mall and we are having &quot;negotiations&quot; about how the logo will be on signage.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Work is overall very nice. I however do not like the tall typeface. I am immediatly reminded of cigarette packaging. I can't recall what brand uses a similar face but regardless it is in my opinion the least attractive choice of font, based on the choices presented in the earlier posts. The illustration is in my opinion superb. Colors are good, but again, the typeface should be changed.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ole: I find your distaste for the typeface to be interesting. To be honest, it wasn't my first choice either, but the unanimous posts in favor of it (besides you and Hrant) persuaded me to go with it. <BR> <BR>This association with cigarette packaging is interesting, as I am about as anti-cigarette as one gets. I did associate the Marlboro logo with this, but that didn't bother me too much because the words were distinctively different. After giving it more thought, however, I remembered the Winston logo, which is too close for comfort. Unfortunately, the logo is already in application. <BR> <BR>Hopefully, the fact that Utah is one of the most smoke free states in the US (location of development) is an indication that most of the target market isn't as familiar with Smoking brands as the rest of us</div>
