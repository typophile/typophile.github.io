  website? they sell a variety of different goods ranging from gaming to cologne to
  an international market.

  body: "well it may need a bit more exploration to be honest.\r\n\r\nthe colors and
    font choice immediately make me think of amazon. \r\n\r\ni assume you used stars
    because of the phrase \"lucky stars\" or the image of \"shooting stars\", however
    the arc created by the stars seems to be indicating a downward movement. this
    makes me feel a) that it's falling flat, and b) it almost looks like a frown (especially
    when compared to amazon's smile). also, you mentioned international markets. do
    you happen to know what shooting stars mean in other cultures? it may mean nothing
    so some might not get the reference, and it's even possible that it may have other
    (negative) meanings you didn't intend. don't know specifically, but just saying.
    \r\n\r\njust my 2 cents. \r\n\r\ngood luck"

  body: thanks for the feedback, I wanted an emphasis on lucky, the star is one of
    the few symbols that is internationally looked upon as being lucky. I didn't have
    much say over the choice of the typeface, the client didn't want to use a bespoke
    typeface or pay for one and was adamant that I used myriad. I agree it might need
    more exploration though.

    you using Myriad Regular and Bold? I would want to see more contrast between the
    weights. Light and Black weights maybe. Also, how about the stars on the left
    side going up?\r\n\r\n\r\nRob"

  body: If you are set on using two different weights, then I would consider eliminating
    the space between the words, or at the very least reducing it. Because right now
    it breaks the logo visually into the parts that appear disjoint.

  body: "About the stars: I think the transition from almost a pentagon to a fully
    star shape gives a nice \"movement\" to the logo.\r\nBut the bigger star is a
    little static if taken as the last of the series.\r\nSo my suggestion is either
    to eliminate the swoosh made by the little stars* and keep just the last one,
    or to tilt the last one by some degree.\r\n\r\n* it could be kept as some sort
    of promotional animation."

  body: "<em>I would consider eliminating the space between the words, or at the very
    least reducing it.</em>\r\n\r\nI think Myriad is a little over-kerned. Plus with
    this mark, where you have tightened the characters still further, the space is
    now too wide (add to that the fact that Myriad is not kerned between y and space
    and probably needs to be) and you have got a gaping hole that need attention.\r\n\r\nI
    like the colours and the 'chubby' stars. Smile rather than frown? I'm not bothered.
    Wonder if the final star needs to not point straight down (upside down stars are
    a problem). Maybe have it at a jaunty angle (with the uppermost point in between
    twelve and one o'clock)? Or is the point that the point points in the direction
    of the flow of the woosh?\r\n\r\nClient will no doubt have a preference for whether
    they want a space or not. If they want a space, you can still afford to close
    it up a lot before the space finally disappears.\r\n\r\nJust because the client
    wants Myriad, there is a lot to be said for doing something to it to make sure
    it's not Myriad by the time you've finished with it. What is it that make this
    particular ten characters Lucky Store's and no-one else's? Do you chop all the
    ascenders (L,k,t) at the same angle or something else?\r\n\r\n"

    lucky I'm reaching stars!"

    Myriad.\r\n\r\nHowever, I still think it's been played out since Apple began using
    it. \r\n\r\nI would feel lucky to see a nicer font for the word lucky. Perhaps
    something with serifs, but in italics to provide a mirror/foil for the motion
    that the stars employ on the opposite side--for symmetry and balance."

    And maybe it's just me, but I still get way too much of an instant <em>amazon</em>
    feel. \r\nI think it could still really benefit from more exploration in the type;
    the serif+sans idea for instance seems interesting. I don't know your client,
    but I might go the extra mile and just take the chance to present some alternatives
    with other fonts (\xABjust as a suggestion, to open up the field a bit\xBB). Sometimes
    clients are very sure they want something a certain way, but it's also our job
    to show them if it could work better some other way. They can still decide against
    it, but then at least you've tried :-)."
