  type used by Peter Saville is really nice.\r\n\r\nI guess its custom drawn from
  a stencil typeface (from which typeface?), or custom-drawn alltogether.\r\n\r\nAny
  hints?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NO_5760.gif]"

    by Gerard Unger for FUSE - if it's what's used for his name on the site. I'll
    look it up when I get into the office.

  body: "Dear Phillipe,\r\n\r\nThis is no typeface! It is lettering! Lettering by\_the\_incomparable
    Paul Barnes. Or maybe it is one of Barnes as yet unreleased typefaces. I can't
    recall what he told me about this piece. In any case, I am looking forward to
    his presentation at ATypI. I spoke with him last week and he is very eager to
    discuss his work on The Guardian. I wanted to hear more but he had to dash off
    to an Aston-Villa match.\r\n\r\nUnger? No way. Though Good Gerard certainly would
    have an entertaining story or two to tell.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nRandolph T. Burke"

  body: I've checked and Decoder is not the cuprit. Thanks for the nod to Paul Barnes,
    Randolph. Not saying it's a match, but don't you think the "GERARD UNGER" on gerardunger.com
    is very close? Perhaps lettering style from a similar source?

  body: "Dear Stephen,\r\n\r\nI am certain that this is the work of Barnes. He is
    the lettering source for Saville. I just spoke with Barnes about this matter and
    he confirmed his hand in this matter. I tried to cajole him into posting in this
    forum, but he is too excited about his ATypI presentation. He said that he had
    done it for an art magazine and was not aware of Unger\u2019s work until afterwards.
    He said he made a serif version then cut the serifs off.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nRandolph

  body: Wahhh. I was supposed to be at that lecture, but got stuck in the States due
    to a passport issue. Christian says their Guardian talk will be either "very good
    or very bad". In his humble tongue, that means "brilliant".
