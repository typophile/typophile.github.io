    to resort to a tail.

  body: Some of the spacing is not quite right. Look at the t's in Tight. But in general
    it's quite strong. There is something about the cuts in the Z that catch my eye
    too strongly. Maybe they could use a different angle. Or find a way to use the
    horizontal by making the cut less deep. That what I see so far.

    horizontal of the \"e\".\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "I have an idea about the dot. I bet you could go either way ( with the curved
    side orientation) if the space between the dot the rest of the letter was tighter
    as the letters get fatter. I should say that the narrower faces' dot looks fine
    to me. But I think the dots on the heavier weights are maybe breaking away from
    their letters - sort of breaking the grammer of the design. I am attaching an
    example but keep in mind I am working in whole pixel increments which are unsubtle.
    There is a big difference between the top & bottom & it's a sub pixel difference.
    \ I think I like the top one better at this weight. Let me know what you think.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dot_4096.jpg]"

  body: "Your right. The direction does matter.\r\n\r\nThe more I look the more I
    get ideas. I will mention them but obviously take them with a grain of salt.\r\n\r\n-
    I noticed ( or think I did) that you have the bottom part of the join of the bottom
    of the bowl in the q for Big squeeze cutting upward slightly. That looks good.
    I think the other q's would look better with it too. And other letters too. Like
    the d. The lc a in main has alternative form that is like the top of the q. It
    sticks out a little. I might like that even better. The top of the bowl in lc
    b could maybe use it too. Or be cut in & down at the top join. And I am running
    on here... but, what about the z? What if it had a rise like you have in the lc
    a at the far upper left & far bottom right corners? Also I wonder if the crossbar
    on the t needs to get slightly thicker as the face gets heavier. \r\n\r\nMany
    of these suggestions are a bit chirographic in nature. But the type is somewhat
    constructed looking. What kind of balance or impression are you going for? I don't
    have a very clear picture of your intentions with this face and my suggestions
    are comming from too many guesses about that I bet. There are probably other more
    abstract ways of making a balance you could be choosing too. Would you tell us
    about your intention a bit? What faces would it compete with do you think? Does
    that matter?"
