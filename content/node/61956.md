  trawling the forums,  but this one has me totally stumped.  It's like Compacta or
  something of that ilk but the numerals / numbers have proved impossible for me to
  track down.  The '3' has me particularly intrigued.  Hopefully the image is satisfactory
  to identify the typeface.  It's used in the British photography magazine '8'.\r\nThanks
  in advance for any and all help.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/image1_5700.jpg]"

  body: "For any who are interested, I found Garage Gothic Bold which is similar,
    the 3 is as good as the same and the 5 is similar.  The 7 has a curved vertical
    stroke and the one has a slab serif bit on the bottom which differs from the sample.
    \ In the capitals, the W and M middle strokes do not extend to the base line /
    cap height as shown in the sample - and is overall a little wider. I have also
    looked at other Frere-Jones faces, Champion Gothic Bantamweight &  Knockout No.
    66 Full Flyweight, however these don't appear to have the angled 3 or irregular
    5 (however the 1 is similar).\r\n\r\nAny clues are most appreciated. Thanks again.\r\n\r\n<a

  body: "Ah... good look on the \"3\" in Garage Gothic Bold. Too bad the 5, 6, and
    9 don't match. ;-\\\r\n\r\nChampion Gothic is pretty nice too.\r\n\r\nOne thing
    I noticed about your example is the width of the spine of the N and M characters.
    It looks nice when it's thick and even! I've noticed that a lot of these spines
    can be rather spindly. Maybe there is some stroking going on here. ;-)\r\n\r\nI
    really dig this -- still a mystery -- font."
