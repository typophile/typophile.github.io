body: Is it possible for a screen font and printer font files to have different tracking
  amounts? In this one particular typeface what&#39;s on screen looks much looser
  than how it prints. Other faces are printing and displaying just fine.

  body: In the TrueType world I think it&#39;s common for hinted fonts to have &#39;hinted
    advance widths&#39; to achieve consistent spacing at small sizes on screen. These
    widths would be different in print.
