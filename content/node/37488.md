  one to me.\r\n\r\nAlso maybe something like Gotham Rounded but with a bit more flow
  less edge. More rounded.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nDom"

  body: Dom, what do you mean by more flow, less edge? Do you consider Gotham Rounded
    edgy? Also, what will this typeface be used for? A bit more background information
    will help direct the type gurus in the right direction. You will get a lot of
    good recommendations if you can be more specific.

    related company.\r\n\r\nWhat I was looking for is Frankfurter and V.A.G Std OT.
    Sari is nice too. \r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n"

    on Neotech \r\n\r\nI guess flow is not the correct choice of words. VAG rounded
    I meant. Thanks again."
