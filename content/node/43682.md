  shack like FontFont ...or whomever, to produce fonts just for them? \r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: In 1929, W.A. Dwiggins made an agreement with Mergenthaler Linotype whereby
    he would design typefaces only for them. But you're probably looking for something
    current.

  body: "So it has been done before, that's great. I was thinking that with today's
    dramatic increase in font design participation that a few talented designers would
    have landed the same sort of contract.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the internet now gives font
    designers more creative and financial security. Or, perhaps font shacks just aren't
    interested in signing design talent to a multi year deal.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I could imagine it might be in a foundry's interest to establish such a deal
    -- something like you might find in book publishing, where a publisher negotiates
    first right of refusal for a popular author's next several titles.\r\n\r\nBut
    in today's market, I think most freelance type designers would not be interested
    in any such restrictions.\r\n\r\nNote that back in Dwiggins's day, there were
    no such thing as royalties on sales of type. WAD's agreement amounted to something
    like a yearly retainer. So this would have been a more attractive arrangement.\r\n\r\nThings
    work differently now.\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I think perhaps Jason Walcott works exclusively for Veer - they have purchased
    the rights to his whole library, and he still develops new fonts.\r\nOr something
    to that effect.\r\n\r\nVeer also have quite a few exclusive fonts by Alejando
    Paul, but many other of his fonts are available from other sources like FontShop
    and MyFonts, so he is not completely exclusive for Veer.\r\n\r\nOnly examples
    I can think of offhand..."
