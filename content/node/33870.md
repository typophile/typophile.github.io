  names \r\nand a few have made signs with a font that will be the one used. \r\nSome
  of them have been made by some shop etching the font into plastic,\r\ngiving a \"3d
  sign\". \r\n\r\nI have been trying to find the font used and the closest I have
  come with \r\nthe online search have been Chevin. ( http://www.identifont.com/show?BQY
  )\r\nBut the G and some other caracters are not 100% the same. \r\n\r\nI have included
  a fuzzy picture taken with my mobile phone camera. Sorry for\r\nthe limited quality,
  but I hope one can recognize the traits of the font. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font_6430.png]"

  body: "A lot of sign makers (at least in Germany, Switzerland \u2026) have this
    typeface. It\u2019s sort of a DIN rounded. DIN17 SB by Scangraphic is too wide,
    though. Cornel Windlin made a font, explicitly based on these name plates. It\u2019s
    called <a href=\"http://lineto.com/The+Fonts/Font+Categories/Text+Fonts/Gravur+Condensed/\">Gravur
    Condensed</a> and comes very close, imho.\r\nIf you don\u2019t need a digital
    font, just ask your local sign makers, probably that\u2019ll do."
