body: "I am trying to find a book about type design focusing on the process of designing
  a font. That is, since the catalyst or the idea, to the first primitive sketches,
  through the processes of adjusting and choosing the best forms for specific letters,
  designing alternates, etc. I am more interested in understanding how type designers
  \"think\" than the results they achieve.\r\n\r\nCan any one point me in some direction?\r\nAfter
  a quick search, I couldn't find any reference to such a book in Typophile.\r\n\r\nThank
  you!\r\n\r\n(Thanks for the replies on the original thread, opened in the wrong
  forum, specially about [[http://www.springer.com/birkhauser/architecture+%26+design/book/978-3-7643-8581-1|
  this]] beauty. Hoping to get some more suggestions, still!)\r\n\r\n"

    here and there, but producing a book that really digs into the whole process would
    yield thousands of pages that have to be read like a Choose Your Own Adventure
    story. And even that would still be incomplete. If you read Smeijer\u2019s <em>Counterpunch</em>
    you\u2019ll get some more insight into why this is."
