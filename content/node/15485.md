    Italic) and they group normally on WinXP in Word (styles are accessed through
    the B & I buttons), and in Adobe apps (fonts group together and styles are accessed
    through drop down menu), and in Adobe apps on Mac, but in Word on Mac three fonts
    show up separately in the font list: Regular, Italic, & Bold. The Bold Italic
    can be accessed by selecting the Bold font and selecting the Italic (I) button.
    I don''t get it...'

      that the Windows version of word finds the style you want by name instead?\r\nI'm
      used to all my styles showing up in the font menu. It's never really been a
      problem for me, except when they're not linked and I have to chose them from
      the menu."

    I hit the auto-check button in FLab and it said the naming's fine, but those could

  body: "If it's an OpenType font, it would be the \"Mac Name\" on the OT Specific
    Names panel. I discovered this while working on Proxima Nova. Fonts with names
    longer than 29 characters in that field don't show up in the font menu in Word
    (Quark, too, I seem to recall). \r\n\r\n(So, Proxima Nova Extra Condensed Extrabold
    Italic was a definite no go. I shortened it to Proxima Nova ExCn Extrabld It.
    I developed a consistent abbreviation scheme for all 42 fonts.)"

  body: "Paul, if you use MakeOTF (from the [[AFDKO]]) you only have to specify 5
    names for each font, and 3 of those are simply straightforward. MakeOTF will take
    care of the rest.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the each entry in the <code>FontMenuNameDB</code>
    file is:\r\n<code>[PostScriptName]\r\nf=FamilyName\r\ns=StyleName (a.k.a. Subfamily
    name)\r\nc=WindowsCompatibleMenuName\r\nc=1,MacintoshCompatibleMenuName</code>\r\n\r\nHere
    are some of the entries for Minion Pro, for example:\r\n<code>[MinionPro-Regular]\r\n\tf=Minion
    Pro\r\n\ts=Regular\r\n\tc=Minion Pro\r\n\tc=1,Minion Pro\r\n\r\n[MinionPro-It]\r\n\tf=Minion
    Pro\r\n\ts=Italic\r\n\tc=Minion Pro\r\n\tc=1,Minion Pro Ital\r\n\r\n[MinionPro-Bold]\r\n\tf=Minion
    Pro\r\n\ts=Bold\r\n\tc=Minion Pro\r\n\tc=1,Minion Pro Bold\r\n\r\n[MinionPro-BoldIt]\r\n\tf=Minion
    Pro\r\n\ts=Bold Italic\r\n\tc=Minion Pro\r\n\tc=1,Minion Pro Bold Ital\r\n\r\n[MinionPro-Medium]\r\n\tf=Minion
    Pro\r\n\ts=Medium\r\n\tc=Minion Pro Med\r\n\tc=1,Minion Pro Med\r\n\r\n[MinionPro-MediumIt]\r\n\tf=Minion
    Pro\r\n\ts=Medium Italic\r\n\tc=Minion Pro Med\r\n\tc=1,Minion Pro Med Ital</code>\r\n\r\nAs
    you see, the PostScriptName takes the general form of FamilyName-StyleName (it
    can't be longer than 31 characters, so the StyleName portion sometimes needs to
    be abbreviated. Another important thing is the hyphen; some applications rely
    on its presence to sort the fonts in the menu).\r\nThe FamilyName and StyleName
    are straightforward. Each of these has to be limited to 31 characters.\r\nThe
    WindowsCompatibleMenuName is used for style linking and family subgrouping on
    Windows. There can only be a maximum of 4 fonts with the same WindowsCompatibleMenuName
    within the same typeface family.\r\nThe MacintoshCompatibleMenuName is usually
    based on the WindowsCompatibleMenuName, and it needs to be different for each
    font in the family. These Windows and Mac names are limited to 31 characters as
    well.\r\n\r\nThat's as easy as it can get, I think. All Adobe fonts are built
    this way and they seem to work just fine across applications and operating systems."
