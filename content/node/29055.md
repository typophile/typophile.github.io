  font. It's almost identical to Rian Hughes' <a href=\"http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=DET0000269#specimen\">Wormwood
  Gothic</a>, being sold by Veer. However, I'm looking to identify the original face,
  without the degradation and roughing up that Wormwood has.\r\n\r\nI've seen it used
  in a few recent commercial applications, but I recall seeing it most often used
  in boxing posters from the 1950s and forward.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts or suggestions
  would be appreciated. Thanks."

    all, but is based on old woodtype, as Miss Tiffany suggested.\r\n\r\nI'm still
    holding out for a digital version though!"
