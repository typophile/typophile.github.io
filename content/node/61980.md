    [[http://www.designmuseum.org/design/jock-kinneir-margaret-calvert|british variety]]
    \u2013 which has been digitized by URW under a name which eludes me now."

  body: "It could very well be URW Transport. I searched for it in Typedia and found
    this: \"Rail Alphabet is a typeface designed by Jock Kinneir and Margaret Calvert
    for British Railways. First used by them in signing tests at London\u2019s Liverpool
    Street Station, it was then adopted by the Design Research Unit (DRU) as part
    of their comprehensive 1965 rebranding of the company.\r\n\r\nRail Alphabet is
    similar, but not identical, to a bold weight of Helvetica (and, not quite as similar,
    Akzidenz Grotesk or Arial). Akzidenz Grotesk had earlier also provided the same
    designers the broad inspiration for the Transport typeface used for all road signs
    in the United Kingdom.\"\r\n\r\nSame designers as URW Transport, but different
    name and released two years later. Probably the same:)"
