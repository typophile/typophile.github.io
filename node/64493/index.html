<p>There is, but by the time the magazines can get it into print we’ve already seen it online a hundred times.</p>
<p><cite>…or is it just that the mags are out of touch?</cite></p>
<p>Oh god yes. Most of them are trying to provide information and services that has been online for months or even years. History articles are often retreads about ornaments, Swiss modernists, and totalitarian propaganda. I wouldn’t mind if they were in the $5–$10 range, but why would I spend $30 on a redundant magazine when for $35 I can get a good book about something new?</p>
<p><em>Eye</em> no. 68, Beyond the Canon, was the last interesting design magazine I saw. Someone needs to just make that concept a quarterly. I don’t ever want to read another magazine article about Helvetica, Wim Crouwel, Paul Rand, Stefan Sagmeister, or see another poster of a dictator.</p>

<p>Better content. Almost anything recent that ends up in a design magazine was probably seen online about 10,000,000 times in the last year. So if it goes to print, make it worthwhile. The writings of Alice Twemlow, Paul Shaw, and Rick Poynor are all examples of how to write the last work about a topic that’s already been covered elsewhere. And Eye No. 67 is a paragon for people who want to get off the beaten path. Give us more articles about postwar design history that doesn’t involve modernism. Minneapolis had designers before Prince needed album covers. Show me!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to practice book arts, go make books and not magazines. Stop using high-end paper that makes the magazines too expensive and too small. I don’t care if you have to print on coated TP, just accomplish my next point…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make design magazines ENORMOUS and get rid of all that white space. I am not buying another design magazine that discusses a designer’s use of type and shows her work at such tiny sizes that the type is barely legible without a magnifying glass. This problem is not new, people have been complaining about it a lot longer than I’ve been in design. The layouts in <em>Communication Arts</em> are one of the worst offenders. <em>Comm Arts</em> needs to be killed, dismembered, and brought back as a crazed Frankenstein’s monster based <em>Coilhouse</em>, <em>Idea</em> and <em>V</em>. To accomplish this we must also…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stop putting so much stuff into features and annuals! Everybody has already seen it and images will probably be archived online until we’re all dust. Putting less stuff in design magazines and making it bigger means that there’s actually some value to the images that do get run.</p>

<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s the other way around. The reason is
pretty sad: some people with a subscription can&rsquo;t
wait, and buy the copy off the shelf. That way they
end up buying two copies!  :-/</p>

<p>This is an interesting point of view.</p>
<p>Yes, I am trying to figure out where I spend my advertising budget. I have advertised in Eye and Creative Review in the past, and although it is hard to quantify print advertising results, I do have a lot of customers from Europe. Is it because I advertised in these UK magazines? I really can&rsquo;t say.</p>
<p>I have advertised in those &ldquo;Type Specials&rdquo;. I think one may have to do that, but is it more of an impact than regular issues?</p>

<p>I have not subscribed to any of the American mags for years until last year. I started Print again after a long hiatus.  Well, so far it has been worthless to me. I restarted just to see if type ads might work there. Print seems to have just given up trying to be anything but a dying relic of its former self.  I have yet to start receiving HOW so I don&rsquo;t know much about it. It seems the premise would appeal more to young freelancers looking for quick and dirty advice on how to do their job.</p>

<p>I have similar feelings about Print and How. But how does one explain the success of the How Conference?</p>
<p>Does it point to How&rsquo;s influence, or to the fact that there are relatively few design conferences of any merit?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think the HOW conference success has anything to do with the magazine. Freelancers live in a vacuum and really want to talk to kindred spirits once in a while. Perhaps giving away direct mail pieces at the Conference will yield more than an ad in the mag?</p>

It&rsquo;s much harder to gauge readership (speculative) than it is to identify content.
If your work reflects the content of a particular magazine then you perhaps trust the magazine to cater.</p>

<p>James, I think that it might be worthwhile to find out what non-design magazines designers are reading that would be good places to advertise. I’m pretty sure that Coilhouse is popular with the creatives, and they offer some really low-cost ad options for small businesses. You could always ask the librarians at the local design schools what’s popular with the students.</p>

<p>I buy Baseline, Eye, CA, and the odd Computer Arts. And SEED. Though it&rsquo;s more science/culture than design, I feel it often is highlighting areas where science, culture, and design meet and are making wonderful babies.</p>
<p>Non design: National Geographic (good lord, they need an overhaul), Canadian Geographic, WIRED, The Walrus, and COLORS once in a while. The occasional issue of The National and Foreign Policy Review, too.</p>
<p>I borrow the odd copy of Print, CMYK, HOW, I.D., and STEP, but haven&rsquo;t bought one for almost 2 years.</p>
<p>I have a nice legalese letter waiting for G.D. USA telling them that if I receive one more mailing from them I will file harassment charges. GD USA is hands-down the absolute worst design magazine I have ever laid eyes on.</p>
<p>Overall, I do read somewhat more online than in print, though I&rsquo;m still reading a lot of books AND magazines. And I have the sagging bookshelves to prove it. I am a non-traditional student, according to the Admissions folks, which probably throws off the curve. I&rsquo;m 6-8 years older than most of my fellow senior-level students.</p>
