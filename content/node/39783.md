  Nova Bold, Mark's wonderful Geo/humanist Sans. But after trying to roughly match
  it with the Myfonts tester, I realized that it is closer to Avenir (my new favorite)
  in every letter except the the \"S\" and the \"R.\" Does anyone know what is being
  used?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DesObs_5842.gif]\r\n\r\nTiA,\r\nMike"
