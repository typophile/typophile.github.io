  shows six of nine options\r\n\r\nUndo, Cut, Copy, Paste, Delete, Select All\r\n\r\nand

  Select All, Open IME, Conversion\r\n\r\nYou found that Character Map is fucking
  shit, but it can't hide the glyphs for 200C-200F, 202A-202E, 206A-206F!"

  body: What do you mean 'trying to relaunch Uniscribe'? Uniscribe is a system DLL,
    it isn't something that you need to launch or relaunch.
