  body: "For something sort of similar, how about our own Mark Simonson's [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/lakeside/regular/characters.html|Lakeside]],
    with the large titling caps (Script Guide sample below) ? Or else his [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/kinescope/|Kinescope]].
    Both are based on film lettering from approximately the Sinatra era's early years.\r\n\r\n-
