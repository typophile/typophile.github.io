  pleased with it and anxious for some critique.

    of the 'o' should probably be on the top?"

  body: I've thought about putting the connector on top, but I think I'll try to make
    it a little more distinguishable by maybe making the o a little rounder (I kind
    of like how it resembles that "handwriting on a ruler" thing). I haven't worked
    on it for a while now, but I'll keep your comments in mind when I get back to
    it. Thanks!

  body: 'i think the lower case "o" is fine, the lower case "j" is my personal problem.
    i feel that it should take the first part of the lower case "z" so that it''s
    not so clustered and tight at that one point, if that makes sense?  otherwise
    i really like it - very vintage thunderbird badass but cute.  '

  body: "I'm afraid that will start looking funny when it follows an i (which is a
    very common combination in Dutch, my mother tongue), but it's worth a shot. I
    did shorten the x shortly after I posted the font here, but until now nobody mentioned
    it might be too wide in this example, but maybe that's because it's at the end
    of the word?\r\nI have already made a few numbers & symbols, but I can't seem
    to make a nice ampersand that fits the style properly. I might work on it some
    more this weekend & post the results."

  body: "Actually, this one's been put on the shelf for a while... I've been working
    on a lot of other stuff lately, but I'm unable to post anything since Typophile
    upgraded (that's what you get for still working with OS 9.1 in this century ;-p
    ). I'm collecting everything on a USB-stick & as soon as I get the chance I'll
    post my new things here on Typophile. Maybe by then, I'll have picked up on this
    one as well. If so, I'll make sure to keep your comments in mind.\r\nI still need
    to post some new progress of my work in 2 different threads & I've been busy with
    quite a big project lately which I'm very pleased with & to which I have gotten
    great responses from friends & family, so I'm very anxious to hear what you guys
    think about it. I still need to get some \"paperwork\" done concearning a copyright
    issue as well, but that's a whole different thread again. I'm really starting
    to slack on some projects, but there are just not enough hours in a day for me
    ;-) And I propably lose interest in things to quickly when they're replaced with
    new ideas. I have an enormous amount of \"half starts\" & \"sketched ideas\" &
    a lot of them will probably never get executed. Does this sound familiar to anyone?"

  body: Another thing that's very common in my work is that I have about 30 variations
    (usually tiny details & colour variations) of every single drawing & usually paste
    the final one in a new document still saving the "sketches" in case I should change
    my mind or want to alter a few things without having to do the whole thing over
    again.

  body: If you pull the connection through the o ( see cursive copperplate scripts)
    I bet that will help.
