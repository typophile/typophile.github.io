  mesmerized. So who'd cut the best Century?\r\n\r\nI am so far liking Century BQ,
  ITC Century, Century Expanded EF and maybe some others.\r\n\r\nI am looking to incorporate
  italics and I am not so sure I will need bolds, but I might! Also, what faces would
  you pair with Century?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nEvan"

    some magic and find it.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Thanks, Florian. Wow, I'd forgotten about all those vitriolic tangents. We
    never seemed to get around to assessing digital versions, so probably of little
    use to Evan.

  body: Nick sent me a sample of his Worldwide, and I gotta say, someday I'm going
    to buy the set. It has an economic fit, and a little bit of flair for what is
    probably one of the most workman fonts in existence. Looking at the pdf specimen,
    I really like the character of the black and ultra weights. Could be used where
    I would typically use a heavy Bodoni.

  body: "Hey,\r\n\r\nMan! I really dig Worldwide. Fabulous and I will go ahead and
    say that I must have it.\r\n\r\nOne question I have is about companion fonts to
    go with Century or Worldwide. Univers? Century Gothic (hmmm..) or something from
    Renner? Others? Please help as combining type is one thing I struggle with.\r\n\r\nSpeaking
    of -- is there a good thread that discusses font combinations and the theory behind
    making such an important decision?\r\n\r\nDanka.\r\n\r\nevan\r\n<a href=\"http://evanmade.com\">www.evanmade.com</a>"

    similarly nuanced finish.\r\n\r\nThe classic sans mate for Century is Franklin
    Gothic, or Benton."
