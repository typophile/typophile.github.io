  I'm looking for a match to further engrave the same headstone. Being of the late
  sixties and that some of the same letterforms vary slightly the original was probably
  hand drawn onto the stone, chiseled and then hammered with lead to form the letters.
  But is it a known typeface or is it perhaps a stone mason's special? Thanks."

    there is a common angular pattern to the letters.\r\nYou might consider taking
    an existing font such as Diamante Demi Bold [img:sites/default/files/old-images/DiamenteEFDemiBoldUC_6726.jpg]
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/diamante/ and using it as a source for your missing
    letters.\r\nIf you want to edit to approximate the flavor of your unique letters
    you can use some of the wedge shapes in Albertus for guidance [img:sites/default/files/old-images/AlbertusUC_6590.jpg]

    And I have found Franklin Gothic Medium to be a very good guide for proportion
    within the space available for the intended inscription.\r\nCheers, Ian."
