    original one, as all of the companies bellow are well known for their font forgeries:\r\n\r\n<strong>Lysandria</strong>
    (FontBank Inc, 1995)\r\n<strong>WindsorSword</strong> (Brendel Informatik, 1994)\r\n<strong>Lorrenne</strong>
    (NovelFonts, 1994)\r\n<strong>Stockwell DB</strong> (SoftMaker, 1995)\r\n\r\nDoes
    anybody know the original?"
