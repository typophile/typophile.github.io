  body: According to Martin Kotulla, SoftMaker is finally creating an exclusive all-uppercase
    only rounded sans-serif font as its exact mixture of both "Letraset Frankfurter"
    and "VAG Rounded/Rundschrift"; this exclusive typeface design exactly looks like
    Letraset Frankfurter, but becomes different and appears in VAG Rounded/Rundschrift's
    regular weight.     This font is finally appearing on both premium-quality typeface
    collections from SoftMaker - "infiniType 4" for designers and "MegaFont XXL 3.0"
    for home users - both being released in May 27, 2014.
