  that Corel Draw comes bundled with a collection of quality fonts. It is written
  as well that \"Newer versions are in Open Type TTF\", but I could not find any information
  neither on the net nor in this forum which version this starts with. \r\n\r\nSo
  my question would simply be: Which is the oldest version of Corel Draw that I could
  buy for the good fonts alone? And just for clarification: How big is the quality
  difference between the older TTFs and the newer OpenType TTFs? And when and how
  would I notice it?"

    Corel Draw 12, it still includes only \"1,000 TrueType and Type 1 fonts\" (http://web.archive.org/web/20050502104839/http://www.corel.com/content/pdf/cdgs12/CDGS12_vs_Adobe_Illustrator_matrix.pdf),
    whereas in X3 it says \"1,000 OpenType fonts\" (http://hexus.net/tech/items/software/4423-corel-introduces-coreldraw-graphics-suite-x3/).\r\n\r\nIt's
    still possible that 12 already comes with OpenType fonts, but it's unlikely that
    Corel would not have included that in their marketing material."

  body: 'Don''t get too exited by the name Open Type in this case: The fonts are basically
    the same as the windows truetype fonts that came earlier versions, they have no
    special open type features like number styles, smallcaps, swashes (a few font
    families have such features, but all in seperate fonts).'
