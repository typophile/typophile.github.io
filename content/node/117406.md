body: This is an Unidentified Subtitles Font from the Video Game of Borderlands 2.
  I'm stumped because no matter where I look on the internet or on my computer, this
  is certainly a very unique and a tough font for me to find the exact match because
  I've always wanted to use this font since it has such a unique digital design to
  it.
