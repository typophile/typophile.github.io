  it possible to create color vector fonts? <BR> <BR>it&#39;s all new to me so feel
  free to laugh :P

  body: You can create Type 3 fonts with colour, though I don&#39;t know how to use
    them. <BR> <BR>Type 3 fonts are basically a collection of EPS images mapped to
    character locations.

  body: Paul, <BR> <BR>Also I am not sure what you are aiming at. We have colour fonts
    but the designer has some work to do. Picking the colours is one of them and recommended  I
    would think. <BR> <BR>You may look at this and tell me if that is what you are
    after. I expect it will be a alphabet rather than the example shown here. <BR>

  body: Using Type 3 fonts is problematic. ATM can&#39;t render them so you will only
    be able see on-screen whatever bitmap fonts were created for the font. As far
    as I know, these bitmap fonts can only be black and white. You will also only
    be able to print them on PostScript devices. And no hinting, either.

  body: What John said. <BR>You need Pyrus BitFonter. <BR>And avoid the T3 format.
    <BR> <BR>Or &#40;if you have only a few colors in your design&#41;, you can layer
    regular outline fonts that are -very careful- made of parts, giving each &#34;part-font&#34;
    a different color. FontShop has one or two fonts like that. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    on a PC.

  body: Actually the fonts will not be alphabets.  I don&#39;t need to print them
    either.  Gerald... how were those created... what software package? <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
    close to abandoning the whole thing.  I can&#39;t seem to find what I&#39;m looking
    for...  Full color fonts, bitmap or vector, and the software to create them. <BR>
    <BR>Anyone know where I can find the .ttf and other file format specs?

  body: Paul, <BR> <BR>Think of it this way. Design the font in one colour. Determine
    how many colours are to be in the font. Make copies of your &#34;finished&#34;
    outline fonts. Then work by subtraction. <BR> <BR>&#34;Keep notes.&#34; <BR> <BR><a

    can export multicolored, multi-layered PDF vector files. It&#39;s only suitable
    for headlines right now, but they do license the technology to select interested

  body: Paul, <BR> <BR>One of the other things I did not mention, but you would figure
    out quickly, is the path direction after subtraction.  <BR> <BR>There are hinting
    considerations. I would have to think through them again. Unless you sell the
    fonts I would not worry much about that. <BR> <BR>The other method for colouring
    fonts is the kerning method.  <BR> <BR>You make the font in the same method but
    you assemble them differently. Colour the elements with the kerning off, turn
    the kerning on and the character assembles. For simple arrangements this is rather
    nice. Especially if you wish to make a subtle change in colour. The other method
    you must wade through layers. Both have advantages. <BR> <BR>This example is shown
    by the central birds and tree. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.lanstontype.com/FleuronsBird.html"
