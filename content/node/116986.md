body: "Hello everybody. \r\nI'm at the very end of designing font which contains ss01,
  ss02, ss03 and some alternates of single glyphs like J, M, Adieresis and so on.
  What I'm trying to figure out is the best way ho to get all the glyphs usable in
  apps like Indesign and Illustrator.\r\n\r\nso far I have\r\n- ss01 glyphs\r\n- ss02
  glyphs\r\n- ss03 glyphs\r\n- salt with glyphs as ss01\r\n- titling alternates J,
  M\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere to put Adieresis and few other alternates? Don't want to have
  them with ss01, because there is different approach. \r\n\r\nSalt mabye? Or some
  different feature? \r\n\r\nAnd is any way how to get ss02 ss03 to illustrator or
  photoshop?\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\nJan Charvat\r\n\r\n"

  body: You need aalt to call all the other features. This allows InDesign users to
    pick any alternate glyph from the glyph palette even if the appropriate feature
    isn't supported.

  body: Titling is generally expected to apply to all caps, or even more, not just
    two letters. If you have only alternate versions of J and M, consider some other
    approach.
