  i worked in a few years back, the ticket printer had a function where it printed
  out a test page of all its available characters... i was just wondering if anyone
  knew where i could find some information on this type?  history, origin etc, i'd
  place the age of the printer at around a 2000/2001 purchase date, although i thikn
  it's quite an old design, as i think most ticket printers have moved to a hot-carbon
  type...  it's a nice example of primitive printing, and also of low-resolution bitmap
  type, i'd just like to find some context for it...\r\n\r\n"
