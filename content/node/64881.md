  are TrueType, so shouldn't they open in Suitcase? \r\n\r\nIt comes up with a font
  \"corrupt error\" when I try.. Any ideas why this is happening?"

    the FontStruct fonts we could adjust them accordingly.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nGustavo

    so it's important for us to know which version of Suitcase Fusion they are using.
    \r\n\r\nThe most current release, Suitcase Fusion 2 (v13.2.1), adds FontStruct
    fonts without issue. We are constantly improving our font corruption checking
    technology, so it is possible that a previous version was identifying FontStruct
    fonts as corrupt due to . \r\n\r\nSparkie7, what version of Suitcase Fusion are
    you using?\r\n\r\nGustavo, any more specific feedback that you have would be welcome.\r\n\r\nJim
