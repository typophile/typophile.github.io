    and <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/20952\">here</a>.\r\n\r\nBTW That is one
    of the main reasons why we like descriptive titles for the Type ID threads --
    I found this one while searching for <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=site:typophile.com%20fashion%20stressed%20sans\"><em>fashion
    stressed sans</em></a>. <em>Quod erat demonstrandum,</em> as the Romans said."

  body: "Thanks guys, you're the best.\r\nMake sense to have descriptive titles. Im
    quite new here, but I'll remember that in the future.\r\n\r\nA follow up question:
    Do you know where I buy this font?\r\n\r\nEDIT: I saw that this was custom made.
    Maybe not available for purchase then?"
