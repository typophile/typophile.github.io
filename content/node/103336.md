  note the font I used. It looks very much like Futura but I don't think it is, as
  the width of the bars isn't consistent.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/400x150_5986.png]\r\n\r\nYour
  help identifying this would be much appreciated"

    body: Thanks donshottype. Unfortunately I didn't edit the t's, and don't have
      this font installed, so I don't think it's the one.

  body: "I ran the eight  letters in your sample through Identifont and it suggested
    Futura, which you thought was not the one!\r\nIdentifont suggests <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/similar?284\">several
    similar fonts</a>.\r\nUnfortunately none of the letters in the sample have a distinctive
    \ earmark. So I might suggest that you cross reference your installed list with
    the Identifont suggestions and see if one of them fits.\r\nDon"

  body: Thanks all for your suggestions. Don's identifont suggestion was particularly
    helpful. It looks like "Futura No 2" is the one!
