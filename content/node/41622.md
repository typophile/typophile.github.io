  We don't want to get into a legal issue with Nokia.\r\n\r\nDon't get me started

    \r\n\r\nAn art director used this in one of our communications pieces and we're
    left with sorting this mess out.\r\n\r\nAny info would be great. Otherwise I'm
    recommending they have to use another typeface."

    official font.\r\nI agree with Aluminium and Lex, best to change it."
