    better, though. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

    but that's the question. I was just guessing about the likely use...

    form of a sans serif like Helvetica or Univers. The E, L, and the Z are hard to
    rationalize though. I was trying for blackness and a minimum of holes to promote
    knockout of photos and a heavy weight.\r\n\r\nChrisL\r\n\r\nPS: Your Ad, Michael:\r\n\r\nWanted,

    sticker campaign. Then we can all login to Typophile and lament how popular it's
    become, the thoughtless choice of lazy art directors, and we'll have to start
    a type battle called \"Fix Squeeze\" that nobody will be able to improve upon,
    meanwhile you'll fly to type conferences in the DezJet, sponsor the rocking font-herd
    all-night parties, and relax by swimming in your vault of royalties. But perhaps
    I'm getting ahead of myself?\r\n\r\nWhich is to say what I should have said before:
