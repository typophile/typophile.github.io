  body: "Several very similar fonts would fit with varying degrees of closeness. Don't
    know when the Herme\u0300s Logo was designed, but it seems a good prospect that
    the designer based it on <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/memphis/\">Memphis</a>,
    designed by Rudopf Wolf for Stempel in 1929.\r\nDon"

  body: "More info:\r\n---start quote---\r\n\r\nHerm\xE8s font here refers to the
    font used in the logo of Herm\xE8s, which is a French high fashion house specialized
    in manufacturing leather products, perfumes and apparel.\r\n\r\nThe logo of Herm\xE8s
    that has been used since 1950s features a Duc carriage with horse, which represents
    Herm\xE8s\u2019 beginning as a harness workshop. Beneath the carriage with horse
    is the logotype of Herm\xE8s as well as the lettering of \u201CParis\u201D, where
    Herm\xE8s was established and has been headquartered. The font used for the lettering
    of Herm\xE8 is very similar to a font called Memphis Medium.\r\n\r\n---end quote---\r\nsource:
