  the reasonability to design a font without knowing where it is going to be applyed,
  and for what purpose. Why design it if it as no finality yet?"

  body: "Many of the best and most successful type designers, including Matthew Carter,
    have indicated the importance to them of the design 'brief': the purpose and use
    of the planned font. Carter has said in a recent New Yorker article that if you
    asked him to design a font, without any further specification, the paper or screen
    would still be blank in another two weeks. \r\n\r\nHowever, the brief need not
    be purely utilitarian. The goals can be aesthetic as well. "

  body: Once when I posted a font for the critique section here the most valuable
    question or comment was, "what is the type to be used for," i.e., book text, display
    for books, book covers, poster display, whatever, and I didn't have an answer.
    As William Berkson points out, in the case of Matthew Carter, or most likely many
    others as well, the design "brief" is obviously important. I didn't have an answer,
    although I knew where the design came from, what motivated me to design the font
    in the first place. I think a very good source for information on the purposes
    of font design, that is, design with an end in mind, based as it were on a design
    brief, is Frederic Goudy's "Goudy's Type Designs." He was very clear on what he
    was doing and why and he explains his ideas well.

  body: "Mariana,\r\nI will be the heretic and encourage you to venture forth with
    a design in search of a reason. Sometimes you just start to see relationships
    of form and play with it. Sometimes a typeface might come out of it.  I think
    a path towards exploration of form is just as valid as a job for hire where you
    are given a task to complete. Goudy and Carter have their way but it is not the
    only way. If after you kick around a design for a while and a utilitarian mode
    makes itself known from it, go for it (and tell everyone later that you planned
    it that way all along :-)\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "There are different approaches and different reasons. I'd agree that a design
    brief is the best way to get to a design, when you (or your client) have a specific
    need. But the other method of creating just to create is no less valid.\r\n\r\nLook
    at fonts from Emigre (Licko, Barnbrook, etc.), T-26, Underware, Veer, etc. and
    you'll see plenty of fonts that didn't have a formal design brief or a specific
    client in mind. Even Jonathan Hoefler has created fonts for purely exploratory
    reasons (e.g. HTF Fetish or HTF Gestalt).\r\n\r\nIf you have an itch, scratch
    it!\r\n"

  body: "True, Joe, but aren't those examples you named (Emigre and Jonathan Hoefler)
    instances where the designer set their own clear brief? \r\n\r\nFor instance,
    a lot of Licko's early typefaces were attempts to design according to the limited
    digital technology of the day. She made fonts that were quite small in their data
    size (especially Matrix\u2026 hence the latin serifs\u2026 similar to the goal
    that Matthew Carter set for himself with Charter). That's a brief. Even a brief
    that comes from yourself is still a brief. Maybe her briefs got less specific
    over time; as a font's data size became less of an issue, she started revising
    her older designs for newer tech. (i.e., Modula). Later, she made revivals (Mrs.
    Eaves, Filosofia). To me, a revival is a brief\u2014as long as you do it right!\r\n\r\nI
    know less about Jonathan's work, but I suspect that some of his experiments might
    have been born out of \"what if\u2026\" questions. Again, if I ask myself, \"what
    if I design a textura that can be used in 9-point text?,\" that sounds a lot like
    a brief. A customer brief may be a bit more specific, but a brief is a brief,
    isn't it? (\"Make me a 9-point textura that is based on Wynkyn de Worde's letters,
    and not Peter Schoeffler's. Oh, and make sure that it has CE accents and a little
    dog-symbol in it, too.\")\r\n\r\nEven an \"itch\" is a brief. But when someone
    says, \"hmm. I want to design a typeface.\" and has no other ideas, other than
    a general desire, they might not come very far."

  body: "The issue I think that is emerging here is to what extent type design is
    art or craft. In his book 'What is Art?' R.G. Collingwood argued that one of the
    chief differences between art and craft is that the craftsman has a very clear
    and precise idea of the end product, whereas for the artist the process of exploration
    and trial and error  defines the end product, and not a predetermined goal. Another
    feature of art is that its main goal is self expression or communication--depending
    on which school you belong to--whereas craft has some useful purpose. \r\n\r\nI
    think the reality is that type design is a mixture of art and craft, and how much
    of each varies with the typeface. Even the division between art and craft is problematic,
    as design can demand just as creative a process as art, even though the goal of
    design always has a utilitarian aspect, which art need not. \r\n\r\nAlso there
    is an emotional dimension to type design, just as with art. But both art and design
    are processes of imaginative problem-solving, and problem-solving is likely to
    be poor without a well conceived idea of the problem. \r\n\r\nThe following is
    an interesting account of the development of the excellent recent typeface Farnham,
    by Christian Schwartz. You will note a mixture of a series of well-defined design
    problems, but an overall aesthic and emotional goal that led him to change the
    brief. Here is his account, taken from www.orangeitalic.com:\r\n\r\n\"I've never
    been able to find a decent digital version of [Vend\xF4me], so I decided to digitize
    my own, give it a \"proper\" italic rather than the sloped roman of the original,
    add small caps and oldstyle figures, and draw the whole thing in at least two
    optical sizes. A colleague of mine suggested that Vend\xF4me seems to be a parody
    of Deberny & Peignot's version of Garamond, so that was going to be the basis
    for a lot of the work. Partway through, like with so many projects, I lost interest,
    and later realized that what I really wanted to draw was not an agressively spiky
    Garamond but an agressively spiky Flieschman: Farnham.\"\r\n\r\nSo I conclude
    from this story that a well thought out 'brief' is important to good design, but
    that the designer may change the 'brief' as he or she goes along, and partly for
    artistic reasons.  "

  body: "It may seem like there's not much philosophical difference between setting
    one's own brief or working to a client's, but in assessing the merit of various
    options/directions during the design process, the difference between relying on
    one's own judgement and someone else's is huge. \r\n\r\nThis is not the same issue
    as designing for a specific usage.\r\n\r\nWith a specific usage as criterion,
    the performance of a typeface can be readily assessed, but a for an original \"what
    if\" design, the designer has to rely on the creative and interpretive abilities
    of art directors, graphic designers, and typographers to realize the full potential
    of the new typeface. \r\n\r\nWhat's important is not so much \"where\" a new face
    will be applied, but \"how\", and that will not be apparent to the type designer,
    and won't be apparent to the typographer either, until he or she starts to work
    with the new face and see what it can do.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, I don't think
    that typographers generally approach new faces in such an experimental manner.
    The norm is to expect new faces to perform similarly to old ones, in conventional
    layouts, but with some slight difference of nuance. \r\n"
