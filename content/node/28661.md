body: "I've been following this great board for two years now, and I've learned quite
  a bit (it amazes me how people can spot some pretty tricky things). I have tried
  to stay resourceful and figure out most ID problems by myself rather than posting
  here, but I have recently taken on a project where I'm having trouble ID'ing a couple
  fonts... I'm truely stumped on this and that's why I'm here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis
  typewriter/grunge serif was for \"The Kings: Unstoppable\" album/CD. I'm trying
  to determine if a font was used for this. I have searched hundreds of grunge fonts,
  tried Identifont, What The Font?, and looked through quite a few font sites- not
  much luck.\r\n\r\nThe CD was released in 1993. The member of the band I spoke with
  wasn't sure if fonts were used or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for reading!\r\n-Mike[img:sites/default/files/old-images/the_kings_4216.jpg]"
