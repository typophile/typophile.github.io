  body: "Rebecca Gimenez just wrote me back. Her kind response included some helpful
    info:\r\n\r\n\"The typeface is called Gross and was designed by Mike Gallagher
    of We Have Photoshop (same person who designed Joseph, the typeface we used in
    all our ads).\" \r\n\r\nHere's a link:\r\nhttp://mikegallagher.org/\r\n\r\nShe
    said the font is not commercially available, but anyone interested in licensing
    it should send an inquiry to Mike Gallagher through his site.\r\n\r\nSo Reid,
    you were right.  ;)"
