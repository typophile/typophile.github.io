  topics for anything about [[times new roman]], im kinda new as a typographer too
  so i got some questions, specifically about times new roman, the font that the magazine
  i work for use. (along with universe and rotis:!)\r\n\r\ni noticed so many times
  new roman fonts out there, the europe version, SF, PS, CE, times(mac), and times
  ten!\r\nso im confused which is the best for the magazine to stick to, i see the
  differences in shape, but what does all the initials stand for, and whats the easiest
  for people to read in the mag? (its a business mag, with a 3C. grid)\r\n\r\nand
  which one should i stick to, im using mac, and it has times and the times new roman,
  and im getting them to buy old style figures and small caps in.\r\n\r\nany advice
  or recommendation?\r\n\r\nthanks alot!! "

  body: "Times Ten and Times are different fonts from Times New Roman. For a business
    magazine I would want to use one that has at least the CE character set so that
    names of international businesses and people can be set correctly.\r\n\r\nBut
    have you considered leaving the Times area completely? Times is initially, (and
    to me, primarily) a newspaper face, and a magazine can develop a much more polished
    and professional look by choosing a less common face (I would stay in the serif
    faces).\r\n\r\nAsk about new faces here and you will get dozens of great suggestions. "

  body: "You live and learn. At any rate, you live.\r\nDouglas Adams\r\n\r\nI agree
    with Don McCahill. Personally, I HATE Times New Roman (any variation, thereof).
    It is boring, overused, and should be trashed immediately. I never ever ever use
    it, nor would consider using it. There are so many new beautiful fonts out there
    to suit whatever style you want, so why use something as bland as Times New Roman?\r\n\r\nJust
    my opinion, of course, but Optima or Palatino are elegant beautiful, yet sophisticated
    fonts that could be suitable for a business-focused magazinen. Otherwise, Baskerville
    or Verdana or even Helvetica would be preferable. You didn't mention whether the
    magazine was an online zine or hard copy print, but even still, anything beats
    Times. Of course, you're limited to web-safe fonts if the magazine is only online.
    \r\n\r\nAlso, is your magazine a business magazine in the subject of science/medicine?
    Or is it classical business magazine? Or is it geared to IT and Technology? Or
    to marketing for children? These are some things to consider.\r\n\r\nI'd check
    out linotype's homepage and see what they have to offer.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "hey guys, forgive my late reply, now im settled...\r\n\r\nthanks for the
    links im checking them out, and yes i so dont like times roman either! im sure
    i can change into somthing close but much better, i will look into the suggestions,
    \r\n\r\ngood point mtn, the thing is the magazine will undergo some identity specification
    (, as it is now, it is just; business. in Jordan, Amman. wehre alot of 'development'
    is happening, but still the identity is on the way. \r\n\r\nim the art director,
    the graphic designer, and typographer, like i have to enhance the grid and typo,
    think of the design ideas for articles, execute them, in addition to knowing what
    the magazine's identity specifically, since no marketing department is available,
    then i will be doing alot of analyzing and asking to get to the best structure,
    i will do a lot of talking to the editor too... \r\n\r\n*wouf* \r\n\r\nwill do
    some more research..\r\n\r\nflorian, thanks for the link, what an idea! ouch.
    i had the chance to see stagmeister in beirut when he visited the american uni
    there! and my old time favourite typographer/designer jonathan brooks. but thats
    it until now :p\r\n\r\nso i still have alot of questions, but i will take it bit
    by bit...\r\n\r\nbut a question for now, about ligatures, in fonts that we buy,
    the collecition usually have only fi and ft? and we have to buy the rest of the
    collection?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "<cite>but a question for now, about ligatures</cite>\r\n\r\nThey usually
    have \u2018fi\u2019 and \u2018f<strong>l</strong>\u2019, not \u2018ft\u2019. These
    two were included in extended ASCII codepages, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_Roman\">at
    least on the Mac</a>.\r\nAnd they are the most essential ones. If you stick with
    Times, you won\u2019t need a lot of fancy ligatures. Take a look at its letterforms:
    \u2018ft\u2019 is not a problem, and \u2018ff\u2019 doesn\u2019t clash either.\r\n\r\nThe
    Times alternative <a href=\"http://www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/families-73-lido-stf-commercial-licence\">Lido
    by Franti\u0161ek \u0160torm</a> hasn\u2019t more than \u2018fi\u2019 and \u2018fl\u2019
    either.\r\n\r\nMinion Pro has some more: fi, fl, ft, ff, ffi, fb, ffb, ffh, ffk,
    fft, fh, fj, ffj, fk, to mention only those with \u2018f\u2019.\r\nBut that\u2019s
    due to the fact that its f drop reaches out quite far to the right. You don\u2019t
    have that problem with Times. Only use ligatures (i.e., in body text) when they
    solve problems \u2013 a lot of people really dislike scrolled \u2018st\u2019 and
    \u2018ct\u2019 ligatures!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I often use Aldine 721 (Bitstream's version of Plantin) instead of Times
    New Roman, especially when printing stuff in the office environment or on laser
    printers. The vast majority of people do not notice that it is a different typeface,
    but Aldine 721 has a slightly darker, more pleasant color. \r\n\r\nAlso note that
    Windows Vista ships with a greatly expanded version of Times New Roman. The design
    of some diacritic character has been improved, many new characters have been added.
    The font has 3300 glyphs and covers all of European and Vietnamese Latin letters,
    European and Asian Cyrillic letters, monotonic and polytonic Greek, Hebrew, Arabic,
    an abundance of phonetic symbols as well as combining diacritics. For multilingual
    typesetting, this offers a reasonable candidate. I've heard that Microsoft Office
    2008 for Mac will also include those fonts so they will be available on the Mac
    sooner or later. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam"

    in the modern desktop computer world. The sheer quantity of documents I see that
    use Helvetica Bold headers/titling and Times Roman body copy is truly mind-numbing.\r\n\r\nHaving
    said that, you can make Times a LITTLE more interesting...the Roman Small Caps
    face is nicely done, I use it often in lieu of italic Times, a cut which I despise.
    I mean, I REALLY dislike Times Italic.\r\n\r\nAlso, I see few people use it, but
    Times Extra Bold is actually a nice display face. "

    with you, the Bitstream versions are usually fine, and in a few cases, I too prefer
    them to the \"originals\" such as they are. I'm not sure I'd vote for Aldine 721
    over Plantin, but I WOULD vote for Aldine 401 instead of Bembo, for the same reasons
    you mention--the color is darker and more even, making it more useable in a standard
    office environment.\r\n\r\nI am told by someone that has the face though, that
    the new OT revision of Bembo--Bembo Book--takes care of these issues and is far
    superior to the Bembo/Aldine we've grown accustomed to the past 20 years.\r\n"

    enable ligatures by ticking the corresponding check box in your paragraph style
    options (\u2018basic character formats\u2019). Should work (for the standard ligatures
    like \u2018fi\u2019 and \u2018fl\u2019) with non-OT fonts aswell.\r\n\r\nTake
    care: in some languages, ligatures are not always allowed. In German for example,
    there can be a \u2018fl\u2019 ligature in \u2018fliegen\u2019 (to fly) but not
    in \u2018aufliegen\u2019 (to [over]lie).\r\n\r\nFor other cases, you could use
    the find and replace function."
