It gets me pondering on how &ldquo;new&rdquo; glyphs may follow the usual supply-and-demand market &ndash; i.e., rather the reverse of &ldquo;if you build it they will come&rdquo; (that is, adding lots of weird glyphs to a font in the hope someone has a use for them).</p>
<p>From memory: the Rupee sign (a new up-coming consumer market), and naturally the Euro sign. Pre-World Wide Web, was the &ldquo;@&rdquo; generally already included as standard? The &ldquo;#&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Pre-computing era &hellip; wait, let me be more precise: before <em>MS DOS</em> (ca. 1980), was there a Need for the backslash?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The backslash, indeed, was basically invented by Bob Bemer for the Model 33 Teletype, for which ASCII was invented. His idea was that /\ and / could be used to represent the math symbols for &lsquo;and&rsquo; and &lsquo;or&rsquo; by only adding one character instead of two.</p>
<p>AFAIK, no one ever used the backslash for that purpose.</p>
<p>As for @ and #?</p>
<p>Well, they were standard on manual typewriters. But they weren&rsquo;t standard in fonts - a font typically had, as you can see in old specimen books,</p>
<p>ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
.,:;!?()-&amp;$</p>
<p>&hellip;and the dash as well as the hyphen, and that was it. You could get accented characters for some typefaces as well. But @ and # were <em>sorts</em>, and so you would basically have one serif version and one sans-serif version, and that was it. If you were lucky, there would be a bit more stylistic variation - but basically, if a book needed an @, and it was set in Times Roman, you still used the @ you had, which was likely to look more at home with Bodoni (it could well have been designed for Scotch Roman of some sort&hellip; or even more likely, Century Expanded).</p>
<p>And you would use the same @ with Baskerville, with Caledonia, and so on.</p>

Of course: in choosing how to write e-mail addresses, they used what were available. And |#| was (and still is) used as number indicator well before anyone could even imagine what an “hashtag” could be.
Anyway, John (quadibloc) is right in pointing to typewriters and ASCII (and other encoding standards) to have an idea of what was generally included in early computer fonts.</div>

<p>should not become a glyph, I think. It might be trendy to chop up words these days, but that does not make them better. Inter-character space is an essential part of a word. Of course we are intelligent enough to do without them, but this is always at the cost of reading speed and, more important, correct interpretation.  Laymen produce enough crap. Why should professionals join them?</p>

<p>When word are being chopped up in more than one part and/or when they are not chopped up into syllables but randomly, I expect that many people will not even take the pain of trying to decipher them. A waste of designer’s time and client’s money. It is like the ads of which many people confirm they have seen them or even like them but practically no one can remember the event, product or brand which was to be promoted by it. Drawing attention is a must in communication arts, but not being able to communicate the message is a waste.</p>
