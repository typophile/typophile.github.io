body: Seems pretty straightforward, but I had no luck with WhatTheFont, even with
  a quality sample.

  body: "Oh, wow.. that looks to be a spot-on analysis. Seems like they scrunched
    the x-height as well on Circula.\r\n\r\nThank you, astute observation!"

  body: "That might be Circula... Really doubting actually... Even squooshed, it doesn't
    look too match, to much distorted to me. The more I look at it the more I think
    it was all drawn starting from R.'s suggestion of Century Gothic, simply clipping/copy-pasting
    internal elements: \r\n- P untouched\r\n- E untouched\r\n- A: flipped /U + crossbar\r\n-
    R: /P + custom leg (= /P top right arc + vertical stroke)\r\n- L untouched\r\n-
    J: /U - left vertical stem\r\n- A: see above\r\n- M: 2 overlapped flipped /U"

  body: I think instead of squashed, it's chopped up. It looks like they took some
    of the length out of the straight vertical elements, because the line weight stays
    consistent through the entire glyph. Probably a custom job based on Circula.
