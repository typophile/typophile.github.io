body: Working on a film set in mid 50s, much of the typography on signage and logos
  was hand drawn, and in some cases we'll be doing that. But many times I find font
  designers are using those handwritten signs as inspiration for recent fonts that
  I could revise for a hand drawn look. Some I've found on myfonts, but what I am
  having trouble finding is the very thick curvy script fonts; so hard to create,
  I know, but there must be some out there. Any suggestions? Thanks. I'll attach an
  example.
