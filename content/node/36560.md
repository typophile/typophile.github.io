  text, not for screen.\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/35021\r\n\r\nand Im having
  problems with the maths signs, so\r\ni have a cupple of questions:\r\n\r\n- Wich
  is the best way to test math signs (and numbers), and to know if they work or not?\r\n\r\n-
  If im doing a text type, should i use low case numbers?\r\n\r\n- Can math signs
  be innovative? or at least not boring? I am experimentig this, but i dont want to
  compromise legibility. I see this signs in romans and they are sans-serif's like.\r\n\r\nThanxs
  a lot,\r\nand hope this will help some other people...\r\n\r\nFerch"

    that I'm missing too much interesting conversation since I can only read English!
    Well, I guess that's my fault...\r\n\r\nIf you haven't already done so, you may
    wish to look at http://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/math.html for some links and advice
    on math typography. Knuth, in particular, is interesting.\r\n\r\nPersonal opinion:
    Yes, math signs can be innovative and not boring. They just need to be clear in
    their intent. I personally find many of the older math fonts to be distracting
    when they don't have any resemblance to the text typeface. I felt this way before
    I studied any typography, so I don't think it's just because I'm tuned in on typographic
    specifics now. The Greek letters are a different matter, as I'm not attuned to
    the needs of the Greek language (once again, my failure to learn other languages).\r\n\r\nIn
    my defense, I live in the middle of a continent where most people speak English,
    so one major problem has been \"which language should I learn?\".\r\n\r\nI look
    forward to watching your work progress."

  body: "This is an interesting issue to me, as I cut my teeth as a proofreader of
    math and, in fact--as a typesetter--have made math and equations my specialty.
    So, do you build a math space around the letterform of a math symbol? Or do you
    leave that to the math software?\r\n\r\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but I'm thinking
    that you'd build the space into the letterform, as there wil be times when the
    math sign is simply a part of text, rather than in an equation (the latter typeset
    more easily from within special math/equation software). Yes?\r\n\r\nThank you. "

  body: "I completely agree with you; build the space into the letterform. The issue
    of math being part of the text is precisely what I meant about being annoyed when
    the math typeface is completely different from the text. I should have articulated
    that. \r\n\r\nHalf the time the baselines are different between the text and the
    math, which really bugs me as the math collides into the text. Outside of the
    text an equation is treated more as an illustration, and the differences between
    text and symbols becomes much less of an issue for me."
