  for applications like these: http://johannesgees.com/?p=123\r\nI have started in
  Fontlab Studio, which I am new to. If I draw only lines, I understand that I need
  to close the countours, but can somebody explain to me what exactly this does when
  I have only strokes? It looks a bit like Fontlab is making the lines double when
  I click \"close contours\", is that true? "

  body: "You may be aware of this, but keep in mind that even lines and points are
    filled shapes; otherwise, they would have no width. A horizontal line, for instance,
    is a horizontal rectangle with a large width and a very small height. I am not
    a type designer, so forgive me if I misunderstand your question, but I think that
    even if you're making a simple \"stroke\" font, you would have to draw both sides
    of the stroke and join them at the ends to give it its width.\r\n\r\nHope this
    helps.\r\n\r\nJosh"
