  As I am tyring to become more serious about my design work and are interested in
  becoming a better designer, owning a few of these (which I didnt even know existed)
  hopefully would benefit me.\r\n\r\nI see the Fontbook is availabe, does any know
  what year this was last updated?  \r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/products/fontbook/\r\n\r\nI
  also see the Font Bureau Third Edition Specimen Book but that was published in 2001.\r\nhttp://www.fontbureau.com/books/\r\n\r\nCan
  anyone recommend any other printed referenes or free online PDF's etc.\r\n\r\nAny
  help would be great"

  body: The "Made with FontFont" book is also nice. A few foundries still mail out
    printed catalogs periodically, House Industries, Hoefler, maybe others. And nearly
    all of the foundries have downloadable PDF specimens that you can print yourself.
