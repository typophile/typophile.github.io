  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I have a question for this esteemed panel:</p>
<p>If you were asked to teach someone AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE about typography in a single one-hour lecture, what would be the most important issues you would cover? Type terms? History? Families? Or something completely different?</p>
<p>(While I&rsquo;m aware this question sounds somewhat akin to &ldquo;what would you grab to save from a burning house,&rdquo;  I&rsquo;m seriously interested in your responses.)</p>

		<div class="commentbody">What is the purpose of teaching them? Is this informative or practical? History is interesting but not nearly as essential as, say, the fundamentals of using and setting type, kerning, what fonts are appropriate for what type of usage, type terms, etc. I never studied typography but learned it on the job. I am blown away by the knowledge of some of the members of this forum. But I do feel like I could give a quickie lecture on type based on my experience using it.</div>

I&rsquo;d talk about the choices that were made in a given example, and other choices that could be made if it was designed differently. And I&rsquo;d try to emphasize the spatial organization of the page, perhaps even over details of typeface design.  Hopefully the time would be enough to convey the essence of typographical design.</p>

pattyfab- it&rsquo;s instructional, particularly practical.
John- I think you&rsquo;re approach would be really terrific as a SECOND lecture. I might be wrong, but my feeling is that the &ldquo;let&rsquo;s examine this, understand why it does or doesn&rsquo;t work and see how we might improve it&rdquo; could be daunting for someone before they felt like they had their sea legs.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It&rsquo;s an educational lecture for beginning designers and people wanting to expand skill sets. I was planning to start with some basic terms and then a very brief history, primarily how the families developed and how attitudes about type are closely linked to other cultural trends.
After that, I wanted to discuss type &ldquo;voice&rdquo; and close with a lot of visual examples of typographic excellence.</p>
<p>I wanted to hit briefly on the subjects off terms and history, not because I think I could do it justice in half and hour or forty five minutes, but because it&rsquo;s difficult for me to really look at how type works, appropriate applications, its character and vibe without talking about x-heights, historical connotations, etc.</p>

Considering the lack of time, it will be hard to get into anything in much detail, so if you just focus on the basics of how to use it practically then they will come away with some helpful information that they will be able to apply, then they may get more interested in the <em>why</em> aspect of type&hellip;</div>

It is now in its sixth edition. The best part of it is the &lsquo;before&rsquo; and &lsquo;after&rsquo; section.</p>
<p>I think the &lsquo;before&rsquo; and &lsquo;after&rsquo; pictures of poor &lsquo;before&rsquo; and improved &lsquo;after&rsquo; versions is the best way to illustrate the impact of good design, and to show some of the typical amateur mistakes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s about all you can do in an hour, but you can really open people&rsquo;s eyes, if they are at all sensitive to the issues.  I see there is a version of the book with a CD rom, which may contain the &lsquo;before&rsquo; and &lsquo;after&rsquo; illustrations.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think I would start with a few - loosen things up - explaining where phrases like &ldquo;lower case&rdquo; came from.</p>
<p>Move on to x-height, descenders and ascenders&hellip;</p>
<p>Talk about how each letter is a piece of art unto itself - but it is used to convey a message, and how each letter needs to fit together for easier readability. Meanwhile, a side discussion on the merits of a good marriage between type and graphic elements.</p>
<p>If there is time - discuss how body copy upside down, when set properly, is gray matter &ndash; and bring the tops of serif letters to show how easy we can recognize and read them.</p>
<p>Also, bring a piece of lead type to be passed around. Explaining that 10 point type is not the type - but the piece of lead it is on. If you have spacers - bring those relics too&hellip;</p>
<p>Wait - I did this once before in 15 minutes to a group of women&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Chuck, by now you probably have more suggestions than you can use, so what I&rsquo;ll do is try and highlight those that I believe to be the most useful ones.</p>
<p>First and foremost, as Patty pointed out, you need to be very clear about the purpose of your talk; this, in turn, should ideally be based on an assessment of the needs of your audience. My understanding is that you&rsquo;ll be lecturing a group of aspiring graphic designers with little or no awareness of the complexities of type and typography. From this I draw a few conclusions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>First things first –</strong> It's tempting to show off what we know about type when talking to novices, but I don't see much point in <em>starting</em> with nomenclature and an anatomy of letterforms. As Hrant has suggested, I believe it's important to "start with the purpose": what the principal goal of typography is; the things that one should never lose sight of when designing a page and making decisions about typeface, line length, text block, etc.  </li>
<li>
<strong>Developing awareness –</strong> The first step towards becoming good at painting, sculpting, cooking or taking photographs is developing an awareness of the art/craft. The very first thing aspiring chefs need to learn is not how to chop vegetables lighting fast like they do on TV, or how to combine ingredients, but how to identify nuances in smells and tastes, judge their intensity, and appreciate the harmony and subtleties of a really good dish or meal. For this, John Labovitz's idea makes a lot of sense: take a seemingly ordinary page and help the audience start appreciating it; help them see the craft (and the science?) behind something that looks so simple but is actually the product of a lot of hard work.</li>
<li>
<strong>Whetting appetittes –</strong> Héctor's and David's suggestions have one thing in common: they talk about getting the audience curious and interested in things that they'll later need to find out more about on their own. Frankly, I don't think there's any other way to introduce typography in one hour! Going back to John's suggestion, if you take the time to study a well-composed page, you'll have the opportunity to drop a few terms in passing and also to call the audience's attention to a few traditions (history) here, a little math there, some design principles, etc. This way you won't be "lecturing" -- which can be boring -- and will be giving the audience a digestible amount of information, perhaps even leaving them slightly hungry and wanting to learn to cook for themselves...</li>
