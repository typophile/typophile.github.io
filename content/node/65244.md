body: "Hey everyone this is my first attempt at making a font (been doing it as a
  learning experience) so any critique would be greatly appreciated. I've been a huge
  fan of eurostile and microgramma for a while so I attempted to take a more futura/gotham
  inspired take on the font. I'm half-way done with the lowercase and numerical characters.
  I also made the weights much heavier and kind of centered around the concept of
  a type to be used in airport signage.\r\n\r\nAny tips on how to make the font better/change
  characters to suit the concept more would be appreciated."

    of K are super heavy, and the middle of Z is light. I like your Q concept. V and
    W would fit into a standard microgrammoid but I feel they need to join more solidly
    at the bottom to fit into your "futura/gotham inspired take" (I''m pretty sure
    I understand how you mean that). Judging the curves will probably require getting
    a closer look.'

    understood what you actually mean but, as far as I know, airport signage isn't
    so heavy:\r\nhttp://www.designworkplan.com/design/airport-signage-photo-inspiration.htm\r\n\r\nThat
    said, I like the typeface. Maybe you can try to make the middle stroke of the
    S more horizontal, in order to slightly enlarge the counters."

  body: Hey thanks for the critiques! Definitely will help with developing the font.
    Yeah I know its a bit bold for an airport style type but I have personal fondness
    for fonts like gotham ultra. Will post updates later. Does anyone know of a font
    that's kind of inbetween Bank Gothic and Eurostile?

  body: Ah any tips on the new rounds? Thought I'd move away a bit from the squareness
    of eurostile to something a little bit more miedinger-styled.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/terminalsanssample2_4912.png]
