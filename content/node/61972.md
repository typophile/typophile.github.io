  body: "Similar to <a href=\"http://www.lineto.com/\">Courier Sans</a> by Lineto.
    In general these \xFCber-hip (rounded) mono-ish designes are typical of Lineto
    and <a href=\"http://www.gestalten.com/fonts/\">DGV</a>. <a href=\"http://www.a2swhk.co.uk/\">A2SWHK</a>
    also do a lot of custom stuff that is somewhat in the same genre."

    really hard to find good looking fonts such as this one. I need to find a good
    blog site dedicated to typefaces so I can stop pestering people here for the answers
    :D\r\n\r\nThanks again, \r\n\r\nAll the best, \r\nScott"

  body: This is by far the best place to find answers as most of us really really
    love type and didn't just jump the trend. Start browsing the Typowiki, follow
    links to related threads and do your own searches based on what you are wondering
    about!
