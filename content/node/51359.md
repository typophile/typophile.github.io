  ffffound this image, been looking for a while and didn't find where it comes from.\r\nMy
  closest result was TS Toledo.\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef-typeshop/toledo/demi-bold/\r\n\r\nbut
  it's not competly the same, especially the axis of the \"o\".\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?\r\n\r\nCheers.\r\n\r\n"

  body: This looks to me like a pre-digital typeface. Possibly a Phil Martin creation?
    But, definitely from that era. Where did you find this sample? It may not be available
    in digital format, but 70's type seems to be making a comeback *ugh* in the avante
    garde circles, so who knows.

  body: "cheers folks.\r\n\r\nYes it actually looks like the Trooper and the Toledo.\r\nI
    guess the fonts do not contain alternates with O,o,Q straight axis.\r\n\r\nAs
    i said, i've ffffound it :) (meaning it's somewhere in this mess : http://www.ffffound.com
