  Has lots of eye appeal\r\n- Would look good on music websites\r\n- Looks fresh and
  new, stylish\r\n- Looks good as small text and as a large heading\r\n\r\nI'm in
  love with gotham but I think it looks a little too ordinary\r\nHere are some fonts
  that I liked (but wont necessarily go with)\r\n\r\nhttp://i36.tinypic.com/aeps85.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\nCould
