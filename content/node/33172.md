  client has approved this font for their logo i.e Emigre's 'Ottomat' font (http://redesign.emigre.com/EFfeature.php?di=113)\r\nfor
  their logo....however for some other sub brands we find that the font is not working.\r\n\r\nWould
  any of you out there know of fonts similar or close to this font? regardless of
  whether it is free or a proffesional foundry.\r\n\r\nMain thing is the font is a
  a pretty plain san serif...but with the whimsical expception of the rounded and
  odd edges point is some of the alphabets ascenders and ends. It is slightly playful
  but just right to be considered 'edgy'\r\n\r\nThe other crux: The standalone 'P'
  of the font..which looks nice is enclosed within a shape for a logotype for the
  same company..so it is important that the font have a unique and characteristic
  p...with something a bit playful like this one.\r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly
  appreciated.\r\n\r\nRobby\r\nINDIA"

  body: Yeah. Or Triplex. BTW I find the spacing of your Peppermint logotype too tight.
