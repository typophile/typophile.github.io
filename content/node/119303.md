body: "Did you know you can monetize your free fonts with more than just banner ads.
  through AdSense?\r\n\r\nInstallMonetizer helps publishers of free downloadable content
  monetize their content. If you are currently using Google AdSense or any other service
  to monetize your site you can continue to do so and add InstallMonetizer's content
  wrapper.\r\n\r\nEssentially the content wrapper inserts an advertising offer when
  an end user downloads one of your free fonts. Every time the end user accepts the
  advertising offer you earn money. The advertising offer is seamlessly integrated
  into your download. You can turn on or off the advertising offer anytime.\r\n\r\nEmail
  - swati@installmonetizer.com for more info. A simple 1 month trial will show you
  how easy it is to make additional revenues.\r\n\r\nOur research shows that if a
  website currently earns $33 per day through Google AdSense- installing the content
  wrapper would make the revenue jump to $120!\r\n\r\nhttp://blog.installmonetizer.com/make-money-with-your-website-content/"

  body: "Hi hhp -if your website currently earns zero dollars - using our font wrapper
    product could earn about 40 cents per download. You can turn on and off the wrapper
    whenever you want. The coolest thing is there are no costs to you to use the font
    wrapper and you can use the wrapper in addition to any other monetizing service
    you are currently using like AdSense.\r\n\r\nThanks for your interest and message
    me to set up a 1 month test.\r\n\r\nInstallM\r\n"
