  body: The repeating letters have different parts "grunged" so I think the text was
    rasterized and processed with something like  <a href="http://www.misterretro.com/image_filters.html"

    body: can't you create something of the same effect with a brush tool or some
      effect in adobe photoshop? also u said agency but on that link there is about
      25 different styles it looks kind of condensed to me from what i can tell almost
      like the type you see on military vehicles

    Retro's way is nice for me because there are so many variations that work fine
    without me having to have artistic talent. I only have the first set, but as soon
    as I can figure out how to write this stuff off, I'm getting the others."

  body: "My favourite way of grunging stuff up is the following:\r\n\r\n1. Find a
    picture of rust, dirt, concrete, etc.\r\n2. Greyscale this picture and turn up
    the contrast so it's mostly white with black grunge on it.\r\n3. Copy this onto
    a layer above your text and set the blending mode to \"Multiply\".\r\n4. Tweak
    the contrast of the top layer as necessary.\r\n\r\nThis lets you change the text
    underneath if necessary while keeping the grunge on top.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "<cite>My favourite way of grunging stuff up is the following:</cite>\r\n\r\nI
    think that is similar to what The filters do, but they make it a PS \"action\".
    But I am saving your comment. On the texture photo pages on my website are a lot
    of things that might make interesting things to try with this using my own photos.
    Thanks."

    If you want to grunge something on a white background, you'll have to invert the
    dirt layer and set it to \"Screen\".\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "I do something similar to what Lex does however I do it in such a way as
    to work on all backgrounds (sorry Lex ;-P). Anyway the way I do it is to get a
    grunge texture (rust, flaking paint etc.) and then bring the photo into the file
    that also contains your text. From here I click on the photo layer, press 'Control/Command
    A' to select all then 'Control/Command C' to copy the photo. From here I go into
    my Channels palette, create a new channel and then press 'Control/Command P' to
    paste the grunge texture into the Channel. It will automatically become black
    and white, from here you can alter your levels/contrast etc. until the texture
    is too your liking. Then I click the channel selection button at the bottom of
    the palette, you should have some marching ants around the whiter areas of your
    texture. Then go into your layers palette click on your text layer then click
    the create new layer mask button. Voila, one nice sexy set of grunged up text.\r\n\r\nI
    have not done much grunge work recently however, I sense it's going out of style.
    Still I found the method to be the most effective.\r\n"

  body: "Aha - layer mask. I knew there had to be something like that in Photoshop.
    I came up with this grunge effect when I was working on some video design in After
    Effects. We had to have animated grungy text where the video behind the text had
    to be visible through the grunge holes. In AE you can use one layer as a tracking
    matte for the one below it, which would be the equivalent to layer mask in PS.\r\n\r\n

    I'm not convinced by Agency (K & S). However, I can't id it either.\r\nTim"

  body: I'll concede that Agency isn't a perfect match. But, G-Unit clothing has been
    online too long for it to be United Sans, as well, the corners are rounded and
    not faceted.
