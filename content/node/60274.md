  I'm designing. \r\nLooking for an Italian typeface from around 1400-1500.\r\nSo
  far I only really have Bembo in my palette, so I thought I'd see if you good people
  could offer any further suggestions whilst I continue my research.\r\n\r\nThank
  you,\r\nSam"

    Nick Shinn's Goodchild is another. The field is wide... do you want \"authentic
    look\" or \"inspired by\"?\r\n\r\nSee:\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/subclasses/serif_venetian/"

  body: "Thanks John. Good lead with the Venetian serifs, I'll take a look.\r\n\r\nAn
    authentic look isn't particularly required, I was just wanting to look at the
    authentic ones to better understand the characteristics. I've come across a lot
    of interesting revivals of Italian faces of the time which I may consider using
    too.\r\n\r\nThanks again"

  body: Centaur is a great one--a redesign of Nicolas Jenson's work, and is considered
    a Venetian Renaissance font. Designed (if I remember correctly) in the 1920s by
    Bruce Rogers. Does great in display (as the header for the Metropolitan Museum
    of Modern Art) as well as in print (for a long time Rogers used it exclusively
    himself on small, fine art books).

    we can add the newly-released [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/exljbris/calluna/|Calluna]]
