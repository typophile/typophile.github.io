  body: "The H looks like a manually condensed and heavied up Cygnet Round, the C
    like <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/brush-script/\">Brush script</a>
    Oops, yes, it\u2019s not Brush Script, right."

  body: Cygnet works very well however Brush Script is not the other.. the hook at
    the top is much different..

  body: "hahaha, Jan, no. I'm just a volunteer there like everyone else. The real
    staff doesn't show very often at the Forum. But I am using the RSS-application
    NetNewsWire Lite, so I am able to follow some different discussions from different
    sites at the same time. Quite handy those things. Although the typophile RSS-thingy
    isn't as comfortbale as the Whatthefont one, because it shows only the start of
    a thread and not the comments (whch the Whatthefont-RSS does. Great thing)\r\n\r\nSch\xF6nen
    Tag noch, Jan!"
