  a client's business card:\r\n\r\n<em>special gifts \r\nadorned with \r\npuppy and
  teddy \r\nbear illustrations</em>\r\n\r\nThe measure is short to showcase a portion
  of the client's illustration.\r\n\r\nIn visual context, the line breaks are exactly
  where they need to be, but the interruption of \"teddy bear\" is unnerving to me.
  \r\n\r\nOnly, not as unnerving as the alternative...\r\n\r\n<em>special gifts \r\nadorned
  with \r\npuppy and teddy bear\r\nillustrations</em>\r\n\r\nThoughts?"

  body: "Excellent! Thanks, gentlemen.\r\n\r\nHrant, I've got the curse of the Grammar
    Nazi, and I can't conscionably use an ampersand if it's not in a title or the
    like.\r\n\r\nThese are fantastic solutions to the specific problem I used as an
    example. But what about the theory behind it? What if I did have to keep it to
    four lines? When it comes to design, is it better to break the line for readability
    and have an inappropriately ragged edge, or is it best to keep them looking balanced
    and break up words that should probably be kept together?"

  body: "> is it better to break the line for readability\r\n\r\nThe idea of readability
    tends to apply to long, immersive text only. For such short text looks surely
    trumps readability every time. Frankly any problem people will have reading that
    smoothly will be momentary and immediately forgotten.\r\n\r\nBTW, if you center
    the text you can (and in fact often should) have great variance in line length.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    you're right.\r\n\r\n> <em>...center the text...</em>\r\nAgreed! Unfortunately,
    it does not apply in this particular case, as it is only on a business card, left
    edge, to make room for the illustrator's graphic on the the right."
