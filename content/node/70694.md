  Hische]]  lettering works!\r\nAre they all custom made/handmade vector type?\r\nIs
  there any specific technique or Illustrator tool that help us to make something
  like this?\r\nAny tips for the \"swirly\" and \"curly\" decorations?\r\n\r\nThank
  you so much in advance!\r\n\r\nBye :)"

  body: She draws a lot by hand and scans. There's no "helpful tool" other than time,
    practice, and talent. Try the almighty pen tool.

  body: "Drawing a path and applying a stroke is the way to make flourishes in a drawing
    program, whether Illustrator or FontLab; apply contrast by dragging extrema points.\r\n\r\nTo
    figure out the shape of the swirls, it may help to study old calligraphy specimens
    and practice drawing the shapes with an ink pen; this is because soon after you've
    started a flourish, you have to start leaving gaps for later passes of its one
    long stroke, which requires enough \"muscle memory\" familiarity with the flourishes
    to think ahead."

  body: Working with circle/ellipse segments and keeping your Bezier handles orthagonal
    makes curve editing a lot easier...

    to get rid of stray centre points once you've made segments from the original
    circles? I get this in Illustrator, and they aren't selectable with the direct
    select tool.\r\n"

  body: I don't think that's a point, it's just a marker showing you the center of
    the object.
