  drinks reception in Barcelona. One of the best AtypI's ever. It's a beautiful get
  away from the traffic of the city square and tourists outside. For those who couldn't
  make Typecon and remember AtypI 95.\r\n\r\nhttp://photos22.flickr.com/26776839_bdf804faae_b.jpg"

  body: "Thanks, Vince. I remember it well. After the reception, we followed giant
    wood and papier mach\xE9 dragons through the streets to the sound of drumming,
    while children ran through showers of roman candles. This has nothing to do with
    ATypI: we just happened to be in town during the culmination of the festical of
    Our Lady of Mercy."
