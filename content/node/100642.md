  Roman codepage, I have other glyphs as well for Central European languages, mostly
  compound ones, but that is irrelevant to the nature of my post. \r\n\r\nI'm a little
  lost of what to do next and I need some advice. I have read somewhere that once
  you are finished with a basic codepage set of characters in a particular weight
  you should move to developing another weight (for example black) disregarding kerning
  at his moment. I have also read that you should begin developing alternate characters
  like small caps, inferiors, superiors and so on. I have also read you should begin
  kerning and make the font ready to use asap.\r\n\r\nSo, i don't really know what
  of those three options I should follow. Of course I'd like to kern and make my type
  usable fast, but if that means that I'm gonna waste time at a later stage, better
  do something else.\r\n\r\nIf you guys don't mind telling, what is the usual developing
  process you usually follow? A little insight into the design methodologies/stages
  that other typographers use could help me a lot. A little words explaining why you
  prefer to kern instead of designing the black version, for example, would be useful
  too.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "When building a family, I usually prefer to finish (almost) the mother font
    first, before turning to build the other weights. That includes kerning tables,
    definitely. If you have to kern V-a T-o and so on in Regular, you\u2019ll have
    to do it as well most likely in Bold or Light. Of course you may choose to ex-/import
    kerning tables from one file to another; I prefer to settle this in one file first
    and then just to change glyphs to create another weight. \u2013 This may be a
    matter of personal preference.\r\nBut when completing a mother file this always
    includes the exact definition of the actual character set. Once this has been
    worked out, my 1st file serves as a template for all the others to come. If you
    finalize your encoding at a later stage you \u2019d have to check several files
    against each other, this may be laborious and error-prone."

    \r\n...unless you're using a font editor that easily allows you to build all the
    weights in one file, like Glyphs (or two files, one for all the roman weights
    and one for all the italic weights). "
