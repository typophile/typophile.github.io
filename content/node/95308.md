body: HRANT wanted to know why i prefer TITUS Cyberbit over the older Bitstream Cyberbit....Here
  they are both at 24 point, the older Bitstream Cyberbit on top and the newer TITUS
  Cyberbit at bottom....both are 24 point. I like the way the type fils space horizontally
  and especially vertically much better with TITUS. Sorry, but the insert image feature
  does not work for me.

  body: Odd. They must have fixed that "problem" in the copy of TITUS Cyberbit Basic
    that <em>I</em> just recently downloaded, because it now wastes space just as
    the Bitstream one does in your image.

  body: I also just downloaded TITUS and had a version of Bitstream that FontBook
    tells me not to install. I thus tested with xeLaTeX (without installing, i.e.
    using <code>ExternalLocation</code>) and I got the same line lengths as the jpg
    above (but,  thanks to TeX, no discrepancy in the line spacing).
