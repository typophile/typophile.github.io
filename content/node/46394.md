  body: "I\u2019m sure you can find a reasonable substitute <a href=\"http://www.somethingawful.com/fakesa/fontsite/\">over
    here</a>.\r\n\r\nBtw, the <a href=\"http://www.fontasticcalligraphy.com/?q=node/47\">Afternoon
    Delight font</a> you are showing on your website is actually a cheap rip-off of
    [[Hermann Zapf]]\u2019s [[Zapfino]]. I suspect the same goes for some of the <a
    href=\"http://www.fontasticcalligraphy.com/?q=image/tid/2\">other fonts you are
    using</a>. E.g.,<a href=\"http://www.fontasticcalligraphy.com/?q=node/40\">Carlotta</a>
    is <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dsgnhaus/carpenter/familytree.html\">Carpenter</a>.\r\n\r\nMade
    a perfect first impression."

    name, or did you hear of her before?

  body: "Hi Susan I think your profile homepage web link has one too many 'c' remove
    one and your web address is fine. Have not posted your weblink as I see you are
    advertising usage of typefaces there and now you have sort of alerted a few profile
    designers and they maybe interested.\r\n\r\nIt's nice to obtain good fonts, though
    it is much more rewarding to own a licence to use them and through the correct
    channels.\r\n\r\nHeck I would love to have a t-shirt from Sudtipos on the from
    \"Iegalcopy\" maybe in 'whomp' or another great (unfortunately not Veer as they
    do NO ship outside the US... doh) :) ...:):):) ..... (Mr Alejandro Paul, we can
    talk... I have ideas)\r\n\r\nJoin the club and don't let clients put you in a
    situation of asking for fonts for free. Hammer-time."

    as the other rip-offs, she has one of mine; ITC Dartangnon renamed as 'Dart'.\r\n\r\nWhere
    did you acquire 'Dart' from Susan?\r\n\r\nNick Cooke\r\n\r\nPs. I'll keep checking
    your site to see if 'Olicana' appears as 'Oilcan'."
