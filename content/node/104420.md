  and \u201CLessing\u201D exist as digital fonts under different names \u2026 I have
  some similar fonts (Super Grotesk, Bau, Venus etc.) but couldn't find anything that
  would match exactly. Unfortunately the type samples are also pretty small. \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/berthold-lessing_5113.jpg]"

  body: "I think these are Berthold's imitation of popular typefaces of the time,
    eg Kabel (or Futura) \u2014 a common practice, even then. These being (re)interpretations,
    you are better off sticking to the inspirations/originals."

  body: "Thanks Bert, but I think if you actually compare these samples to what you
    prefer to call \u201Cthe originals\u201D you would notice they're quite different."

  body: Berthold mager is just the German name of Berthold Grotesque Light; the typeface
    is, as the Encyclopedia of Typefaces comments, very close to Nobel Grotesque.

  body: Lessing is apparently the same as Edel Grotesque Extended; however, I have
    not been able to find a digital version of it.
