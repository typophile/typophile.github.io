  body: "It's interesting to compare the two approaches to deterring counterfeits:
    the Americans throwing in as much fine detail as possible so that something would
    almost certainly be copied badly, and the British using very little so that anything
    that is wrong would stand out more clearly.\r\n\r\nNone of it is exactly typography,
    though, as Craig says, since the lettering was hand-engraved on the dies used
    for creating the printing plates."

    body: DTY, why would it not be typography, the lettering and numbers at the 4
      corners? Typography used to be only hand writing, then it moved to wood block
      and metal type....now we have added digital....Either way Typography is the
      art and science of placing lettering and the design of that actual lettering
      itself....This currency has lettering and numbers placed on it, and there is
      for sure lots of "design" amongst the actual lettering itself....(The Capital
      V at the top left corner is simply stunning...). So using all practical definitions
      of the word, it is indeed "Typography".

  body: Zeno, typography is, as the word suggests, writing with type. If it weren't
    a distinct technology from pen writing or block printing or engraving or laser
    etching, etc. it wouldn't have a distinct name. In the digital realm, fonts are
    used to output to many different kinds of technologies, so it is more common for
    typography to play a role in the creation of letters in various media than used
    to be the case, but when we're talking about historical artefacts we should take
    care to accurately describe the means of their making. If you want a general term
    to refer to the kinds of lettering treatment on that US bill independent of technology,
    it would be ... lettering.

  body: "To me the important difference between typography and the lettering arts
    (whether with pen, brush, burin, or something else) is that typography involves
    the arrangement of already-formed letters, while lettering involves an interaction
    between the arrangement and the forming of the letters. The square-letter engraver
    for that silver certificate did a number of things that were very un-typographic
    at the time, such as adapting the \"A\" in \"DOLLARS\" to the shape of the preceding
    \"L\". \r\n\r\nNow that OpenType programming makes type more flexible, the difference
    isn't as sharp as it was previously. There's always been quite a lot that type
    designers can learn from lettering, and more now than before, but typographers
    are still mostly constrained by what the type designer offers them."

    a practical matter, they're unlikely to get upset about actual-size web images
    because the resolution is so low.  Prints at high resolution (like in a book,
    magazine, or brochure) are a bigger concern as someone might cut it out and try
    to pass it off as real currency. \r\n\r\nI used to have a large bank as a client
    and we often used money images in the brochures and needed to be careful to comply
    with the rules. Most commercial printers are very familiar with these rules and
    will refuse to print a piece that violates them.\r\n"
