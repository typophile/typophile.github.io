    <em>U&lc</em> and he's fed up and thinking about retiring to teach.

  body: "Mark,\r\n\r\nWhat I do know is that he made a big impression here, several
    of the old timers whose oral history we have taken, refer to Herb Lubalin's visit
    here.\r\n\r\nMore usually the talent brought in for lectures here or for judging
    design competitions were commercial artists or folk such as Arthur Paul, Vice
    President and Art Director of Playboy magazine (1968.)\r\n\r\nWhat is really interesting
    is that Lubalin was about type, and many people don't think of \"typography\"
    and \"New Orleans\" (or the South) in the same breath.\r\n\r\nSee ya 'all here
    in New Orleans at TypeCon 2011!"

  body: "This is wonderful, Nancy, thank you for this. What other typographic treasures
    have you unearthed?\r\n\r\nI remember delivering U&lc layouts to Herb at his home
    in the Village when he was ill, but unfortunately never got to work with him directly
    as U&lc was done completely at his studio until his passing, when it was moved
    to the ITC office."

  body: "Hi Ilene,\r\n\r\nPost WWII the boys coming home from was in the European
    theatre brought with them an eye for the International style\u2014we know this
    from what little graphic design history has yet been published here in the US.
    This holds true for little markets, such as South Louisiana.\r\n\r\nThe typographic
    tradition local to New Orleans goes back centuries, there have been type foundries
    here for quite some time. Come to TypeCon 2011 in New Orleans and experience first
    hand this great legacy."
