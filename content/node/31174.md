body: "Hello typofriends.\r\n\r\nSince the first days of 2007 i decide to come back
  to the field of type.\r\nI like to share the first font from my re-starting new
  effort to become a typedesigner.\r\nPicara is a sanserif organic font, with local
  vernacular references, a little condensed proportions, dark color, roman humanist
  model(Jenson)and open counterforms.\r\n\r\nI want to keep armonic rithm of vernacular
  letters, without distracting too much the attention of the reader. The propose for
  this font is to work from 7 to 12 pts, in magazines and books, with a family of
  the 4 classic weights: Roman, SmallCaps, Italic and Bold.\r\n\r\nThe end strokes
  follow a strong left-right \"italic rithm\" in the lowercases; Do you see the same
  in the uppercases?\r\n\r\nThere are some characteristics that i want to follow,
  for example, the monetary lowercase signs aligned to the x weight old style figure
  numbers.\xBFis this weird for commercial standard requirements?\r\n\r\nMore details
  to look at in this first complete version of the roman, in the character set attached
  in the pdf.\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\n\r\nmh.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Miguel - I've said it elsewhere already, but this is looking wonderful. This
    warm, organic finish will be a hit, especially in these days of soft'n'cozy, but
    Picara doesn't feel trendy. \r\n\r\nThe bowl of the 'a' might be just a tad too
    small for text sizes. It's the only counter in danger of clogging.\r\n\r\n> There
    are some characteristics that i want to follow, for example, the monetary lowercase
    signs aligned to the x weight old style figure numbers.\r\n\r\nNo reason not to
    do both. Make a Lining Figures version of the font with punctuation and monetary
    symbols that match the uppercase."

    body: "\"P\xEDcara\" is a word that describes an attitude and a whole language
      present is the popular folckore warm humor, very rich on slangs, with a touch
      of erotism.\r\n\r\nTranslation words: rascal/naughty/cunning\r\n\r\nMy favorite
      newspaper use this language (lacuarta.cl), and off course, Picara is a metaphoric
      type interpretation of vernacular lettering and this chilean popular language.\r\n\r\nmh"

  body: "I like this. The 'softness' of it is nice.\r\nOnly thing that comes to mind
    right now is, as Stephen Coles already mentioned, the bowl of the 'a'. That looks
    a bit too small maybe."

  body: I really like this design. Here is what I wonder about; Could the UC C be
    more exciting like the other glyphs? It lacks some of the tension they have. The
    S & s both seem to be rolling foreward to me a little. I see how the font holds
    together with the top being where is is so maybe rather than pulling the top back
    the rest of the form could change. Does the lc eth bend over to far? The lc o
    feels a little heavy to me compaed to the e & a. I like the dimunation of the
    dollar sign. The upper case Thorn is super nice!

  body: "I really love the flow of this typeface and I think it will work great for
    body text. The only thing I'm worried about are, as people already mentioned,
    the bowl of the a. It may be a bit too narrow. I'm also wondering why the end
    of the descender of the 4 are toward left?\r\n\r\nGreat work!"

  body: 'This is excellent. One thing that looks out place is the florin: it''s rather
    wide and square-looking, and should probably descend instead of ascend. Not that
    anyone uses the florin, but it''s there.'

    to add that I love the figures. Nice lowercase figures.

  body: "The a in the ae ligature looks a bit slapped on, the forms dont really flow
    together. \r\nThe \xDF is a bit too wide, I think. And its lower bowl too small
    (don't use the s for that).\r\nRe the florin: maybe you should line up the horizontal
    strike thru with the one in the sterling etc. And do elongate it and maybe give
    it a bit of a cursive slant (that's common usage in the Low Countries).\r\nThe
    ampersand is a bit unbalanced. Maybe the lower bowl a bit larger and the upper
    smaller?\r\nThe cedille needs to beef up.\r\n\r\nSounds like a lot \u2014 but
    I do like this design. Makes me wish I could do something like it ; )"

  body: "It has quite nice proportions, Miguel.\r\nI don't know why, but the first
    impression I had is that is somewhat \"falling backwards\" (the terminal modulations
    probably give this overall impression, which is reinforced by the fact some glyphs
    (like the S, s, numerals 3, 5, 7, 9) does not have this. Maybe it could benefit
    to slat it very very little to the right.\r\n\r\nMay I ask you: do you know when
    Alejandro Lo Celso's Australis will be made finally available to license?"
