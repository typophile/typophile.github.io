body: I've been working on a new font that for the time being is called New Cuisine.
  When I go to test things in Illustrator the menu ignores the New and places it where
  Cuisine would fall. Is the word New a trigger in Adobe apps making it use Cuisine
  as the family name even though its a single font for now?

  body: "It works fine; it just shows up under the C's instead of the N's in the font
    menu. I suppose if I took the space out in the name that would force it to be
    under the N's, but then it would list as NewCuisine. If it's something to do with
    the word New preceding it then by logic the same thing would happen with fonts
    starting with Old like Old English. I don't have Old English so I grabbed a font
    called Old Press (a freebie) just to see if that came up under P instead. It didn't.\r\n\r\nI
    remember other fonts doing this when I worked at American Greetings. I thought
    it had something to do with the font manager, but I'm not certain now. I'm using
    the old free version of Font Explorer on my Mac. I recently updated the system
    software to Snow Leopard, but I don't think that's a problem."

    which clearly it ain't.\r\n\r\nIf you're set on the name AND a space between the
    two words, it looks like you're going to have to spell New another way, like Neu,
    Nieu, Noo or Nevv. Or not."

  body: "Fascinating. I get this exact same result on Windows, InDesign CS4, with
    a freshly created font.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/newcuisine_6367.png]\r\nNothing
    unusual in the name tables either -- this is my default naming scheme:\r\n<pre>
    \   Macintosh Roman (English)          Font family : (1) \"New Cuisine\"\r\n    Macintosh
    Roman (English)            Subfamily : (2) \"Regular\"\r\n    Macintosh Roman
    (English)            Full name : (4) \"New Cuisine\"\r\n    Macintosh Roman (English)
    \     PostScript name : (6) \"NewCuisine-Regular\"\r\n</pre>\r\nI also tried it
    as a Preferred Family name, but that didn't work either!\r\n\r\nI'll have to take
    a closer look at this. InDesign has a habit of ignoring 'font name prefixes' (and
    a nasty habit it is, as I feel it's actually inconvenient for browsing through
    your font list), but so far that only seemed to include foundry names such as
    Adobe, ITC, and Linotype. There isn't a foundry called \"New\", is there?"

    \u201CNew Aster\u201D, \u201CNew Baskerville\u201D, etc. in mind; However, it
    seems strange that this would be implemented as a general behaviour (rather than
    one for specific fonts in the Adobe library) since clearly there are many cases
    where it is entirely undersirable (New Century Schoolbook appearing alongside
    Century makes sense; New York appearing alongside York doesn\u2019t).\r\n\r\nUnlike
    Theunis, I actually prefer foundry abbreviations to be ignored for sorting purposes,
    and have on occasion wished that the OT spec included a separate name field for
    \u201CSorting Family Name\u201D. Applications could even include a preference
    for sorting fonts by either the family name or the sorting name.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

    font info dialogue,  there's the 'Additional OpenType Names' which allow you to
    fiddle the detailed settings, and I seem to recall these may be useful in font
    menu ordering?"

    This usually matches the Full Name. If you want the name of the font to appear
    differently than the Full Name, you can insert the Compatible Full Name in ID
    18.</blockquote>\r\nThere is nothing in there related to this name mangling.\r\n\r\nI
    didn't test what happens when you use a <em>different</em> Menu Name ('cause I'm
    on Windows right now), but it's a reasonable assumption that even <em>if</em>
    you insert a 'different' name here \u2013 and InDesign actually uses this \u2013,
    the result still goes through the \"smart sorting\" routine."

    my desire for a 'sorting name' field since, unless different vendors adopted very
