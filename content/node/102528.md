  learning more about type design and it is my ultimate goal to design a few of my
  own. I already have some ideas floating around my sketchbook. Can anybody offer
  me some advice on how/where to begin. Also, what are some good resources (books,
  websites, etc.)? I am studying GD in school at the moment but none of my professors
  have ever designed their own typeface. Thanks!

    Not all cases lead to fruitful feedback, but sometimes one's cup runneth over!\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/83333\r\n\r\nGreat
    compilation, Sevag! I would add these three books: \"Letters of Credit\" by Tracy,
    \"Designing Type\" by Cheng, and \"Letter Fountain\" by Pohlen.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>most
    of the brilliant design educators who had the greatest impact on me were not the
    greatest designers</blockquote>\r\n\r\nIndeed. Because actually designing things
    versus being able to communicate about designing things are two different talents/skills.
    Sort of like chefs versus food critics. The important thing is for each side to
    appreciate the indispensability of the other.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Hi Matthew and welcome to Typophile. Don't be surprised, most of the brilliant
    design educators who had the greatest impact on me were not the greatest designers
    as I imagined them to be. \r\n\r\nRegarding online resources; [[http://ilovetypography.com/|I
    Love Typography]] is a great starting point. Few other websites which I have in
    my mind at the moment are: [[http://typefoundry.blogspot.com/|typefoundry.blogspot.com]],
    [[http://66.147.242.192/~operinan/index.html|briem.net]], [[http://www.100types.com/|100types.com]],
    [[http://kupferschrift.de/cms/|kupferschrift.de]], [[http://www.paulshawletterdesign.com/|paulshawletterdesign.com]],
    [[http://www.microsoft.com/typography/default.mspx|Microsoft.com/typography]],
    [[https://www.typotheque.com/articles|typotheque.com/articles]], [[http://fontfeed.com/|fontfeed.com]],
    [[http://typedia.com/|typedia.com]] and [[http://typographica.org/|typographica.org]].\r\n\r\n[[http://typographica.org/typography-books/the-elements-of-typographic-style-4th-edition/|The
    Elements of Typographic Style]] by Robert Bringhurst appears to be a popular read
    amongst designers and typographers, some other books which I enjoyed reading were:
    [[http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/463387.Counterpunch|Counterpunch: Making
    Type in the 16th Century, Designing Typefaces Now]] by Fred Smeijers, [[http://www.amazon.com/Anatomy-Typeface-Alexander-S-Lawson/dp/0879233338/ref=pd_sim_b_1|Anatomy
    of a Typeface]]  by Alexander S. Lawson, [[http://www.amazon.com/Alphabet-History-Evolution-Design-Letters/dp/0823001709/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1366871880&sr=1-4&keywords=allan+haley|Alphabet:
    \u201CThe History, Evolution, and Design of the Letters We Use Today\u201D]] by
    Allan Haley. All of the books by [[http://www.doyaldyoung.com/|Doyald Young]]
    are a must in my opinion, if you can afford them. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, see also
    journals and magazines like: [[http://codexmag.com/|Codex,]] [[http://www.eyemagazine.com/|Eye]],
    [[http://www.baselinemagazine.com/|Baseline]] and [[www.creativereview.co.uk|Creative
