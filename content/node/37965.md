body: "Ok, this will be wildly similar to a post of mine from a week or two ago, but
  now with sans serif fonts. \r\n\r\nI suppose some could call this the lazy way to
  find a suitable type, but you guys save me a lot of time and I know that most of
  your recommendations are solid types. \r\n\r\nWe have a creative brief for a rebrand
  of a corporate mark \u2013\_the current mark being set in Univers. The client really
  likes more unique / memorable type... probably as a backlash against years under
  the regime of Univers.\r\n\r\nSo, I am looking for some nice modern / conetmporary
  sans typefaces that maintain a sense of the corporate world while offering unique
  forms as well. I would love your input to aid in my search, you guys usually do
  right by me.\r\n\r\nlet me know, thanks.\r\n\r\nbtw, I fell in love with Lexicon
  which I had not seen up until the week of my similar post geared towards serif'd
  types."

    produces serifed fonts?

  body: "Thanks Stefan.\r\n\r\nI am looking a lot at the Italic Univers, which is
    kind of their thing, big bold + forward moving *original I know. I feel like the
    Stalemate will fall too closely there. \r\n\r\nI do like Sophisto quite a bit,
    but it may be too far away from corporate for them, I am checking out the site
    though, looks like some good stuff is around.\r\n\r\nI am hoping to find something
    with the impact, of, well, IMPACT. But a bit more unique and contemporary... if
    that helps? "

  body: Flex is beautiful, on second thought though, I think it is too straightforward
    for these guys. They are tough, because they like bold and corporate, with uniqueness,
    but too much funk gets them, I am afraid Flex is not enough. FF Bau on closer
    inspection seems promising.
