  navigate, the current Adobe web site makes finding the Type group look playing Where
  is Waldo  blindfolded! Man, I wish they would fix that thing.\r\n\r\nHaving eventually
  found the Type group, I bookmarked the page. The easiest way to find it is by typing
  the URL directly and forgoing traversing The Matrix altogether. Here is the URL,
  at least it is simple:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.adobe.com/type/\r\n\r\nChrisL\r\n\r\nPS:
  I hope the offices Thomas, Miguel, and Christopher work in are easier to find than
  the web site or else they may never make it to work :-)\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "A couple of days ago, I followed an old link to one of the Adobe fonts, but
    the link was dead. I took the briefest of moments to see if I could follow other
    links on the Adobe website to find the information on the font. When I couldn't
    find the slightest hint of anything type-related immediately, I just went back
    to a search engine and found information on the font from elsewhere (not the Adobe
    site).\r\n\r\nThanks Chris for doing the work for those of us who have the collective
    attention span of a gnat. They really should fix the navigation if they actually
    want people to find the Type group page."

    be - I have found this frustrating in the past.

  body: "With regard to CJKV, it is indeed as Dan wrote. Look at the cover of my book,
    specifically along its top edge, for confirmation: [[http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596514471/]]\r\n\r\nAnd
    James, my comment was merely about the long-term preservation and stability of
    the URL for type-related things at Adobe, and was not an attempt at evaluating
    our corporate-wide typographic skills. At one point, several years ago, our URL
    was changed, and we fought to have it reinstated. It has been stable ever since.\r\n\r\nInterestingly,
    one or two years ago I calculated the average number of years that current Type
    Development members have been employed at Adobe Systems, and it was twelve (years).
    The company-wide average was less than two, at least at that time. Now, I am sure
    that our department average has increased, and it must be thirteen years by now.
    I have been in Type Development at Adobe Systems for over seventeen years.\r\n\r\nDr.
