  need of a complimentary typeface to go along with it for the basis of the signature.
  I've been playing around with a lot of basic serif fonts (garamond, times, didot,
  etc). The idea is to get something professional looking to start out with and kind
  of use that as a template to make a unique logotype.\r\n\r\nthe business is called
  \"Dey's Write to Work\" it is a business that helps people write resum\xE9s, cover
  letters and such in order to help them gain employment.\r\n\r\nany suggestions for
  a launching off point?\r\n"

  body: "That font is very nice, and I will probably be purchasing it in the near
    future, probably not for this application though. While I do like it and it actually
    is very much what I have been looking for quite often lately, I feel like it's
    a little too quirky for what my client would prefer...\r\n"
