  into html using CSS?\r\nCurrently it is possible, however anyone with a little coding
  experience can find the root directory and rip off your typefaces.\r\n\r\nWho will
  save the day and make this possible?\r\n\r\nComments welcome."

    technological.\r\n\r\nIMHO, people can already rip off your fonts easy enough.
    CSS @font-face won't be adding anything new."
