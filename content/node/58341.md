  from medieval times and so they\u2019ve asked me to use an appropiate font. But,
  the fonts I\u2019ve found are nice for maybe the name of the product or just an
  important sentence but not for explaining the one page long legend that is related
  to it. Any suggestions on a couple of fonts that can have nice capital letters but
  are readable without getting tired of them?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!!!"

  body: "It's an interesting project. My first thought was a font that is probably
    not technically Medieval, but [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/sherwood/p22-aragon/|P22
    Aragon]] has a nice old style with legible lower case.\r\n\r\nI'm sure you will
    get other suggestions, but this was something I've used and liked.\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: "If Medieval means blackletter, you\u2019re in a trouble, but if that is the
    case I\u2019d choose some rotunda in the spirit of [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/san-marco/|San
    Marco]] (not really Medieval, it\u2019s early Renaissance).\r\n\r\nIf your Medieval
    concept accepts Carolingian times, I\u2019d say something like [[http://www.paratype.com/fstore/fonts/Alcuin.htm|Alcuin]].\r\n\r\nFor
    nice capitals: maybe overused, but [[http://www.paratype.com/fstore/default.asp?fcode=609&letter=C|Charlemagne]]
    could be an option."
