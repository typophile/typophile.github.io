  about this font.  I've gone to Identifont, What the Font?, and FontNavigator and
  have had absolutely no luck.  Some of the bits look like Univers, Myriad and Humanist.
  \ But the 'a' and the 'r' look custom.  Or it could be some freebie font, although
  I've been told that's not the case.\r\n\r\nThanks guys."
