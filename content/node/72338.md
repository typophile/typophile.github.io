  body: It's <a href=http://typophile.com/node/43743>W Macro</a>, a customized version
    of <a href=http://www.dardenstudio.com/typefaces/freight_micro>Freight Micro</a>.
    I can see why you like it!

  body: 'yes looks like W Macro, but appears to not be available. Freight micro is
    considerably different - i wouldn''t go in that direction. I did check myfonts,
    and there are a few options but nothing as sophisticated. The slab and sans together
    is quite something. Thx! '

  body: Other alternatives would be <a href=https://ourtype.com/#/try/loading/parry/>Parry
    and Parry Grotesque</a> and the new <a href=http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/families/ff_suhmo/>FF
    Suhmo</a> (lacking a sans complement).

  body: Nice suggestions ... Parry and Groteseque and FF Suhmo. For a typewriter Suhmo
    is very cool. They don't get the level of black, I might be inclined to go with
    Stag as the closest reliable. Thx.
