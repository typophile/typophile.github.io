  for text.\r\nI am quite satisfied with the spaces for now even though I know there
  is much much room for improving.\r\nYet what strucks me most is how bad it works
  on screen (and also in small sizes printed I assume).\r\nIn certain size letters
  begin to jump up and down the lines. A disaster.\r\nI know this is a thing to be
  solved with the hinting tool.\r\nYet, I have to admit I never learned how to use
  it correctly.\r\nI tried to do something in all charactes similar to the u I show
  here. Obviously I tried to keep values equal.\r\nI suppose I have to add other hinting
  lines that prevent the characters from changing sizes in a vertical direction.\r\nIs
  this true and if so how is it to be made?\r\nAnyone there eager to help me with
  this prob?\r\n\r\nSalute\r\nStefan\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bild-1_6046.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bild-2_3597.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bild-3_5911.gif]"

    makes a difference to FontLab.

    Interesting.\r\nCan you tell me what it is and how it works roughly?\r\nIt is
    on Mac/FontLab.\r\n\r\nThanks for your interest Malcolm\r\n\r\nStefan"

  body: "Alignment Zones: Font Info -> Hinting Settings -> Primary Zones (right panel).\r\n\r\nFor
    example, if you want/need Alignment Zones of 15 units, you add two Primary Zones,
    one from -15 to 0, one from 1000 to 1015.\r\nI don't know the technical usefulness
    of it, but I believe they are mainly as space for overshooting round and/or pointed
    shapes below and above the x-hight. And I guess that helps hinting."

    baseline. ;)

    me work even harder!\r\n\r\nAnd thanks to the helpers when it comes to alignment
    and hinting.\r\nThis changes everything. I made a few lines here and there experimenting\r\nand
    it has rapidly bettered! \r\n\r\nThanks again Paul :-)\r\n\r\nStefan\r\nWow :-)\r\n"
