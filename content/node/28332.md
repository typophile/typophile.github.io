body: "At the ATypI TypeTech Forum in Helsinki last year I talked about the future
  enhancement of the batch functionality for (OpenType) font generation in DTL DataMaster.
  I am pleased to announce that the programming has been finished and that the font
  generation of for instance a complete type library can be controlled by relatively
  simple command files now. Information concerning the fonts, font formats, character
  layout files, code pages, input and output directories can be stored in a command
  file. These command files can be activated by command files, so a hierarchic system
  can be built to control the output of for instance separate type families or specific
  font formats or everything at once. To make the creation of a command file easy,
  DataMaster can write such a file during font generation, which subsequently can
  be altered with a text editor. At the FM Track in Lisbon (http://www.fontmaster.nl/pdf/temp/FM_Track_Lisbon.pdf)
  I will demonstrate the new functionality.\r\n"
