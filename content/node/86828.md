  body: "It's quite hard to see because you've blown up the sample so much. A reasonable
    \u2013 if inexact \u2013 match would be something like [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/lucasfonts/thesans_condensed_of_bold/?&fg=000000&bg=ffffff&sample_size=36&sample_text=ASSEMBLIES%20OF%20GOD&ft=liga&acs_pt=32|TheSans
    Condensed Bold]], though the details (especially the M) are off. I'm sure there
    will be a more exact match if you're a bit patient."
