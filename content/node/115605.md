body: "Hey guys, I searched for this topic meticulously but I can`t seem to find good
  answers on the internet (maybe I looked in the wrong places, i can`t tell), so maybe
  some of you can help me out. \r\n\r\nWhat is the correct procedure of carrying the
  look and feel of your mobile app typeface to the different markets, especially if
  the typeface doesn`t support certain glyphs like the asian ones. Are you actually
  looking for alternatives in the that language (if so where?), or are you simply
  using the iOS/Android unicode feature in which the device replaces the type with
  a standard OS typeface.\r\n\r\nThanks for any help in advance. "

    instead of apostrophes; make sure you don\u2019t do that in your app."

  body: "I would say \"correct\" depends a lot on your budget! :-/  I say this because
    ideally you'd like to have a custom font (or a custom extension to a font you're
    using) that handles everything you need, but that can be very expensive... On
    the other extreme you could do a passable job by carefully choosing free fonts;
    you won't get a high level of visual harmony, but people will certainly be able
    to read it. Somewhere in the middle: choose a libre (free to modify) font that
    has as much of what you need as possible, and pay somebody to extend it. It all
    depends on how visually picky you are.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
