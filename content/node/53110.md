body: "I would like advise on a type face for a tattoo. \r\n\r\nIt is going to be
  of the word 'brother'. I don't have a preference of upper or lower case, san/serif.
  \r\n\r\nThese are the characteristics of the type face followed by the characteristics
  of my brother:\r\n\r\nIt should be very strong - he is a Royal Marine Commando and
  has always been very strong mentally and physically.\r\n\r\nIt shouldn't have any
  unnecessary flair - he never shows off.\r\n\r\nIt should be unique never the less
  and show a bit of something that you wouldn't expect to be there - he has characteristics
  that are unseen to many as he does not show them off; they only come out when necessary.

    like the broadness of the type face. And the slightly bigger 'B' (a capital in

    would go with a sans-serif as well but with rounded corners, since someone that
    writes BROTHER surely has a kind heart, a shoulder to lean on, so, rounded corners.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_unit_rounded_bold_tf_lf_alt/|FF

  body: "Christopher&#8212;a more refined alternative to Aviano Sans bold is Engraver's
    Gothic, made by numerous font making outfits. The radiused corners is a good idea
    too, and it can be applied to any font you like, such as Aviano sans or Engraver's
    Gothic.\r\n\r\nI think ILC is suggesting radiused corners because that's a massive
    trend in type design at the moment.\r\n\r\nI recommend you go with something much
    more butch with a bit of contrast and discrete slab serifs, like Aachen bold (actually
    it's black but they call it bold). If Aachen isn't your cup of tea you could look
    at some of the slab serifs recommended on the \"If Johnny Cash were a font\" thread.\r\n\r\nWhy
    a slab serif? These sansies are okay but none of them have got any balls, not
    manly enuff for a royal marine commando, and they're rather dull. Surely your
    brother is more interesting than a plain old sans serif.\r\n\r\nsans serif = prissy

  body: "@ilovecolors Having rounded corners gives it a more human feel.\r\n\r\n@James
    Arboghast \r\n\r\nLol. Great reply.\r\n\r\nMy first inclination was to use Rockwell
    but thought it a too mechanical, so using a slab serif sounds good. \r\n\r\nGoing
    back to rounded, Aachen has some but doesn't lose it's manliness. I really like
    the strong bases and it hit the nail on the head with having something unique
    without having anything unnecessary.    \r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/brotherSlab_6121.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n'The

    Photoshop/Illustrator?"

  body: "Aachen looks great for this. Just please make sure you get it large enough,
    space it a bit looser, and most importantly, go to a tattooist who knows what
    he's doing*. \r\n\r\nThe details, like the size of the serifs, will not be quite
    trivial to get right, and especially so in smaller sizes. Also, remember that
    tattoos tend to bleed a little over time (not as in blood, but as in ink spread),
    so those tiny spaces would likely fill up soon & get mushy.\r\n\r\n* The <a href=\"http://411.bmezine.com/\">shop
    directory at BME</a> may be a good place to start looking if you don't have one
    yet. Also, while I haven't checked back there in a couple years or so, the folks
    on <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.bodyart/topics\">rec.arts.bodyart</a>
    should be highly knowledgeable (though not always most peaceful)."

  body: "Chris, if you're producing digital artwork for a tatoo artist to copy, the
    most flexible way of doing it is to convert some type into outlines in Photoshop
    or Illustrator, then modify the vector forms until the whole thing looks right.\r\n\r\nGetting
    the size right is important, yes, and a little more space. To be certain the tattooist
    is up to the job I would ask to see samples of their lettering work and get premission
    to take photos so you can look over them in your own time and space. Drawing type
    forms properly is a detail job, and from what has been said about tattoos some
    things need to be compensated for or require special attention to make the tattoo
    viable long term.\r\n\r\nGo one step at a time with this one.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"
