  body: "I gave it a shot by looking through all 24 pages of the Script Font ID Guide,
    Part 11 (Everyday Hand-printing), but this wasn't among the 500 or so fonts there.\r\n\r\nThis
    is one of those times when our <a href=\"http://typophile.com/forums/typeid/faq\">FAQ</a>
    words about casual handlettered fonts should be read. (near the end of the page).\r\n\r\nSince
    there is really nothing very dramatically different about this font, which may
    be custom, the best alternative is to find a site with a lot of handwritten fonts
    and pick one with a similar feel.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
