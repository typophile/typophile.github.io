  i'm going to start a new font, i think i prefer to do 2 at the same time.\r\n\r\nMy
  idea is to do a Sans Serif with a lot of variations, from a light to extra bold,
  pixel/bitmap font to slab serif. \r\nSo and here is my question... where do you
  think i should start?"

  body: The best place to start is sketching. Get your concept down on paper (or screen)
    build a basic word such as hamburgefonts and see if you like how it looks and
    then continue.

    signage, graffiti, signpainting, gravestones, calligraphy? If not, I am unsure
    why you are pursuing type design....\r\n\r\nStart by looking. Look at all the
    above kinds of letters. Consider their differences, their construction, turn them
    on their side, look at them in the mirror.....\r\n\r\nNext do a lot of sketches.
    Sketch every kind of letter that interests you. What kinds of letters seem easiest,
    more familiar to you? Sans or serif or script, it doesn't matter. If you keep
    sketching the same kinds of things, then make that your typeface. It is too ambitious
    what you describe to do for a first typeface. Make one single design, and work
    on it until it is functional, harmonious, balanced. "

  body: "A good way to learn about the letterforms themselves is to pick up a book
    about calligraphy. Many of them show the basics of letter construction, and show
    how most things are made of discreet parts that are similar throughout the alphabet.\r\n\r\nIt
    will also help you understand the relationship of thicks to thins in a letterform,
    how and why serifs exist, etc. \r\n\r\nVery informative, and I'd dare say there
    are more books on calligraphy than there are on type design itself."
