  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I just received a postcard for a series of seminar (that is, three iterations of the same seminar on different days) by Edward Tufte here in the Washington, DC area. I find myself seriously tempted to attend. All of the registration methods requested including the reference code on the mailing label, which was PYR, which leads me to wonder: is FontLab peddling its user list to third parties, or is the PYR/Pyrus resonance merely coincidental?</div>

   <div class="comment card m-3">
	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody"><p>No idea about the lists. I attended an information design seminar with Tufte in Chicago a few years ago, and didn&rsquo;t notice any pick-up in &lsquo;third-party&rsquo; junkmail in the months after. (I don&rsquo;t recall the event having anything to do with Fontlab, however).</p>
<p>Good seminar, and highly recommended (once), not least because copies of his four books come with it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited about why Tufte&rsquo;s in Washington these days, too. (Tapped by the president to bring some clarity and transparency and top-notch information design to town):</p>

<p>I enjoyed Tufte&rsquo;s presentation at the Boston ATypI in 1999, but information design isn&rsquo;t my field, and I recall that some friends who actually do information design referred to him as a ‘snake oil salesman’.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>They were probably jealous of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->TheVisual Display of Quantitative Information<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which he published himself because he was concerned that its quality would suffer if left to others. So yes, he is self-assured, and the book is beautiful, but that doesn&rsquo;t detract from the serious nature of the topic. Infographics don&rsquo;t get a lot of creative respect, so anything which raises its status should be lauded, not sneered at.</p>
<p>I bought Tufte&rsquo;s poster reproduction of Minard&rsquo;s chart of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Napoleon&rsquo;s march on Moscow<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Printed with spot colour on a nice stock, it rightly respects the original.</p>
<p>As someone who&rsquo;s actually done a few charts, graphs and maps, I found Tufte&rsquo;s forthright debunking of misleading infographics, coupled with his high production values, to be quite salutary. And with an interest in the history of graphic design, I was fascinated to discover things like Playfair&rsquo;s work and the Dr Snow typhoid map in Tufte&rsquo;s book. IIRC, that stuff isn&rsquo;t in Meggs.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I saw him at ATypI in Boston as well, and I went to one of his presentations in NYC a few years earlier.</p>
<p>During the NYC talk he announced to the audience that the only typeface you need for charts, graphs and maps, was Bell Centennial, and that one shouldn&rsquo;t waste any money either licensing or commissioning any other fonts for that sort of work.</p>
<p>During the break people were having their copies of his books signed, and he would joke with each one, and asked them what they did for a living and then personalize the inscription. When my time came he asked me what I did, and as he was looking down preparing the sign I told him I was a type designer. He quickly looked up and I said, &ldquo;Thanks a lot!&rdquo; sarcastically. He quickly looked down signed the book and said &ldquo;Next&rdquo;.</p>

It included three books (&ldquo;Beautiful Information&rdquo; wasn&rsquo;t out yet), the powerpoint booklet, and the Minard Poster. Lunch was not included. I doubt I&rsquo;d pay on my own, but if your employer can pay for it, it&rsquo;s definitely worth it, especially if you don&rsquo;t already have the books.</div>
