body: "I'm developing an OpenType font by byte-crafting it rather than using design
  tools, and now have a custom OpenType (CFF flavour) font that implements a really
  small subset of the Basic Latin unicode block (specifically it only implements .notdef
  and what under Basic Latin interpretation would be the tilde).\r\n\r\nThe CFF block
  passes \"tx -3\" validation, the font as a whole passes a round-trip de/recompile
  through TTX, and Microsoft's Font Validator does not report any errors in the font.
  Even loading it as a custom webfont (as plain otf in browsers that support otf,
  and wrapped as WOFF in browsers that don't) makes them style the implemented ~ glyph
  correctly.\r\n\r\nHowever, even with all that apparent correctness, the windows
  font previewer reports that it is not a valid font file, and window will not let
  me install it (at least in windows 7. I do not have access to 8). I've looked high
  and low for information on what windows requires for a font to be installable, but
  haven't been able to find any decent docs; the internet seems to be filled with
  how to install a font as a user, rather than what requirements need to be met as
  developer =)\r\n\r\nThe font file, as both CFF block, .otf file, WOFF file, and
  TTX output, can be found over at https://github.com/Pomax/CFF-glyphlet-fonts/tree/gh-pages/binaries
  (in the base dir, not the \"with GSUB\" dir)\r\n\r\nIf there are any additional
  tools that I can use to determine whether or not this font is \"done\" enough to
  be installable, or if anyone knows where to find the documentation that explains
  which criteria a font needs to meet before it can be installed, that information
  is extremely welcome. And of course, if someone happens to notice something actually
  wrong with the font itself based on the TTX readout, I'm also keenly interested
  in your findings =)\r\n\r\n- Pomax"

    the space character seemed to be necessary as well.

  body: It looks like your "name" table is invalid. Changed with the one generated
    by FontForge and font works.

  body: Do you happen to have a TTX fragment for that corrected name table? If I round-trip
    the font through TTX, windows still rejects it, despite supposedly being in the
    right format, with the necessary data (MS Font Validator suggests the only requirements
    are font name, subfamily, and version strings)

  body: "Ran the font through font forge, and you're right. Apparently NameID #3 and
    #6 are required to make a font installable. So I suppose that solves half the
    problem; the other being \"where might one find documentation on these requirements
    rather than discovering them through experimenting\" =)\r\n\r\nThanks for pinpointing
    the name table!"

  body: "A decade ago Windows didn't complain about those missing naming fields.\r\n\r\nSo
    I'm afraid there is no easy answer as there are requirements, recommendations,
    and assumptions. The specs evolved. Same goes for Windows.\r\n\r\nTo make it worse;
    there might even be font validation or rasterizer bugs involved. But that is also
    an assumption ;-)\r\n\r\nAlso be aware Microsoft Font Validator doesn't check
    for all possible issues, and sometimes incorrectly detects an error."

  body: Yeah, it seems to not be maintained anymore either, so a format 4 OS/2 table
    gets flagged as error. I was just hoping there was *any* documentation that I
    could tap into for some more modern versions of windows (7 and 8 would be enough
    really). Thanks for all your help!
