  lot like so other sans-serif faces and although this seems commonly used I can't
  quite pinpoint what this is.\r\n\r\nHelp, please? Thank you."

  body: It's Gotham of Obama's Change fame, based on my research. It is licensed though.
    Any unlicensed version that looks the closest? Or anything that gives the same
    vibe? And no, not Futura. :)

    Sans</a> is what you\u2019re looking for. It\u2019s not 100% free, but the regular
    weight is free. The rest is more than worth it\u2019s price. \r\n\r\nFree fonts
    are usually crap, but Jos\u2019 stuff is the exception.\r\n\r\nFutura isn\u2019t
    free by the way, but it comes bundled with OSX."

    either (Thankfully, I don't have that anymore.) \r\n\r\nYes, it is Gotham and
    I have you to thank for that. I just Google-d it right after I read your answer,
    and found out why it looks really familiar to me. So there. :)\r\n\r\nSorry about
    the confusion. And huge thanks for all your help. :)\r\n\r\n"
