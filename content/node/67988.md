  but had no luck, even searched google using the site: command, topics came up, but
  when clicked on, did not go where it should, so I am posting here. I am a web designer
  and with some down time, I have been focusing more on type. Do you have any favorite
  css typography sites that you visit and can recommend? \r\n\r\nI found a these and
  enjoy them. \r\nhttp://webtypography.net/\r\nhttp://www.webdesignerwall.com/tutorials/typographic-contrast-flow/\r\nhttp://www.alistapart.com/topics/design/typography/\r\n\r\nThanks"

    off, glad you like Typogridphy, and it is currently having a complete rewrite:
    http://csswizardry.com/typogridphy/preview/\r\n\r\nSecondly, I just released http://csswizardry.com/type-tips/
    which focusses on web type, which may be of some use to the OP.\r\n\r\nNow, where's
    the introductions thread?\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the best,\r\nHarry"
