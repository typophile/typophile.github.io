body: " Hi all,\r\n\r\nIs there a reason why I carn't rename some of the glyphs using
  the green diamond in the Rename Glyph window. The glyphs in question are the ibreve
  and Imacron.\r\n\r\nIn the Properties window the name of the Imacron is uni012A,
  and the ibreve is uni012D, if I click the green diamond the name or  unicode don't
  change.\r\n\r\nI can change the names manually, but if I click the diamond it changes
  back to uni012A. This is different from other glyphs where the diamond will produce
  the correct name. \r\n\r\nHelp.\r\n\r\ns. "

  body: you can fix this bug yourself by adding the appropriate unicode values to
    the file miguel referenced above.

    can I update this file, the extension is 'nam'. I can open it with TextEdit but
    it won't let me save it it with the that extension. What do I need to alter the
    file and save it correctly?"

    is how the file was altered. Back in Fontlab the name or unicode will still not
    generate, have I done something wrong?\r\n\r\nIf this is a bug, would it not be

  body: "While we have done many fixes in FontLab Studio 5.0.2's standard.nam (as
    compared to 5.0.0 and 5.0.1), Imacron and ibreve indeed are one of the very few
    that slipped through. We have fixed it since in our codebase. An updated standard.nam
    will be distributed in the next version of FontLab Studio, though I don't have
    a release time for it yet. \r\n\r\nAdam Twardoch\r\nFontlab Ltd.\r\n"

  body: did you try quitting FontLab and restarting after you changed the file and
    before trying to regenerate the unicode for these characters? also, there may
    be another standard.nam file in your User/Library/....? folder that FontLab is
    preferring over the one you altered, so you may have to change that one as well.
