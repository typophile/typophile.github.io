  body: When it is presented in black on the screen, how do the flourishes compare
    (weight wise) to the rest of the character?

    out is the 'wr' join being a bit bumpy, and the u could be slightly bigger."

  body: Personally, I don't like the low exit stroke on o, either.

  body: "Thanks Nick: \r\nTotally agree.  I will try to fix 'wr'. I will test a bigger
    u also.\r\n\r\nThanks Riccardo:\r\nThe low exit of the 'o' was made to make it
    connect to letters like 'r' and 's' without the need of a ligature.  Mostly because
    most web browser barely support ligatures (Only Firefox AFAIK). \r\n\r\nI'm struggling
    to make it flow as good as possible without using ligatures, but as you might
    know, r s x and z are problematic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: In that case, maybe opening up that little loop of /o/ will help better distinguish
    it from a stem of an /a/.

    you attached to the idea of all the letters connecting? It might be an option
    to keep w without an exit link?"

    unusual is bound to be a hack of some sort.

  body: I'm not terribly bothered by the loop style of the o as long as it does connect
    smoothly. I prefer that to the type of loop on the b which seems more out of character.
    I did notice some slant differences that show up in combinations like the o_n.
    The letter sizes vary slightly throughout, but this gives it a bit more of DIY
    touch which fits with a lot of design work these days.

  body: "@Eliason, Bendy, frode, frank, Stephen:\r\nThanks!\r\nThe b, n and o where
    fixed, connections smoothed, and a few ligatures added.\r\nThe original swash
    M was left as an alternate only, since it was too \"formal\" for this \"casual\"
    script.\r\n\r\nIt's called \"Dancing Script\", and version 1.01 was just released
    under the Open Font License.\r\nhttp://www.impallari.com/dancing/\r\n\r\nThe source
    FL files are available in the download .zip\r\nAnyone wanting to contribute improvements
    for the next release is welcome.\r\n"
