    can't see anything wrong yet because I'm not good at IDing type; once people start
    IDing that stuff we'll see how the cookie crumbles.\r\n\r\nFor anybody who mistakes
    my intent to help (by which I mean much more than merely the person asking for
    IDs) for a threat, their problem might very well be in the mirror.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "No (although that's a possibility too I guess), I'm talking about the other
    \"p\" word: I'm seeing enough \"signs\" in this case to think that the chances
    of plagiarism are high enough to bother raising a red flag. I'm providing my experience,
    potentially preventing a regrettable action; I'm raising awareness in a place
    founded on the effort of creating fonts.\r\n\r\nSo I'm not sure if it's clean
    or not (if I were I would say it), I just like to err on the side of caution.
    I think my post above is highly tentative, and I feel more such mindfulness is
    warranted all around.\r\n\r\nOne problem is that you can only prove that something
    exists, never that something doesn't!  :-/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    of my hobbies to pursue font Vigilantes. With a very short attention span it's
    hard to track design changes over months, much less decades. Also, font conspiracies
    are extremely low on my paranoia scale.  \r\n\r\nThe TXT file in the Dafont download
    gives a nice story about WolfBainX, Vigilante Type Company and CybaPee. They were
    all there. If someone can validate the writer's identity the circle would be closed
    like this thread.\r\n"
