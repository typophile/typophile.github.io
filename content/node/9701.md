body: Buenos Dias, fellow type enthusiast. I was wondering if anyone can help me in
  my search for a small printing press &#40;like the one&#39;s used in letterpress
  printing&#41;. Doesn&#39;t if it&#39;s new or used or how old. I don&#39;y need
  any movable type &#40;I can make my own&#41;. Any help would be appreciated. <BR>Gracias

  body: One good cheap way is to search for &#34;table top letterpress&#34; / &#34;tabletop
    letterpress&#34; on eBay. In the past 2 months or so I&#39;ve noted at least three
    offered and sold, for between $250 and $800 US dollars. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: My business partner, Ross, bought his platen press and some type from <a href="http://www.donblack.ca/default.asp">Don
    Black</a> in Toronto. They typically have a couple of dozen or more presses of
    various sizes in stock, and lots of type.

  body: I have a small Adana press, a type case, and 6 fonts &#40;mostly ATF&#41;.
    I&#39;m not sure that shipping out to you makes sense; I was kinda hoping to find
    a buyer in the Bay Area. I&#39;m moving in 3 months, so I gotta get rid of it.
