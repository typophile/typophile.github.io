  signage is?\r\n\r\nI guess it was hand-painted or stencilled maybe. But is there
  a copycat font out there now?\r\n\r\nThanks! [img:sites/default/files/old-images/subway_6591.jpg]"

  body: "EDITED:\r\nLooks like a metal enamel sign from pre-1950. Production technique
    would probably have been stencil, painting and fusing.\r\nI doubt any of these
    are still in use, so competing an alphabet to make a font would be a daunting
    task. As the sign says this is for the 8th Avenue Independent System. So in the
    same year that it was produced, other New York subway systems would have produced
    completely different lettering styles. All that can be hoped for is that there
    are photos showing old signage that can be combed through to find any that are
    consistent with this one. A long shot is that the stencils, or drawings for them,
    have survived. \r\nSome context: \r\n_New Yorker_ article from  April 29, 2014,

    \"New York Subway signage\" \r\nBTW the sign has a real mix of styles. The narrow
    _W_ seems like an almost monospace companion to the other letters, but _M_ is
    wider than one would expect if monospace was the rule.  Some letters like _B_
    and the top half of _R_ follow a \"stovepipe/gas pipe\" design. Others, like _S_
    do not.\r\nDon\r\n"

    a lot. It just so happens to feature a few eccentricities that remind me of that
    sign. They're totally unalike in style, though.\r\n\r\nIn this sample, I mixed
    Bourgeois Condensed and Condensed Alt on the first line. On the second and third
    line I mixed  Bourgeois and Bourgeois Alt.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bourgeois_6499.jpg]"
