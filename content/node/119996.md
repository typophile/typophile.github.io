  body: Love it. Thank you for sharing. I'm a "stone cutter" in SW Wisconsin, adding
    death dates to granite markers in the cemeteries, but it's all sand blasting...pretty
    crude...honestly, it doesn't feel like there's much craft involved. I would love
    to take it to a higher level, but there's not much demand in my immediate region
    of the United States. Or at least I don't think there is.
