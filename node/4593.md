  body: I think the first ones are custom / handmade, for sure.. <BR>The &#39;Enjoy
    Graphics&#39; one has been created by <a href="http://kitchen.free.fr" target="_blank">KITCHEN</a>..
    <BR> <BR>&#40; If you want to create such self-made-hand-made-looking type, the
    best thing would probably be to create it by hand, to achieve a rather similar
    style.. &#41; <BR> <BR>Sorry, for not being able to really help you.. <BR>I dont
    really remember seeing any typefaces like these..
