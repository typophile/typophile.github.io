body: "Bonsoir!\r\n\r\nI've found this typeface in an old french magazine from the
  50's (R\xE9alit\xE9s, the French equivalent to Life), and I'd like to know if it
  has been digitized (don't know if it's the right word for that in English, sorry!).\r\n\r\nI
  like the strange g, the s and the \xE9.\r\n\r\nIt could be great to work on a typeface
  referring to those shapes... But I have to know if someone made it before! (I mean,
  with bezier's curves...)\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FONT_inconnue_small_6730.jpg]"
