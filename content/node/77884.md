  is that it's not really a font, just some badly-drawn letters. Nevertheless, I told
  the person who sent me this I'd ask here, in case it really is a font. Anybody recognize
  it?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ICDC-logo-big_6040.gif]"

  body: Seems like the author of this blended a Sans with a Serif but got bored after
    cutting off the Serifs of the A before blending ;)

  body: "Hey, Graham, welcome to the thread. \r\n\r\nI'm curious, what was the idea
    behind this font? My impression, as I look at it now, is that it was kind of deconstructivist,
    grunge kind of thing. \r\n\r\nAnd the Indiana Coop Center maybe didn't really
    get it, thinking more like \"ooh! free font!\", with the intentions of the font
    sailing clear over their heads, especially considering that bizarre \"A\" which
    has more of a stale '80s vibe to it..."

  body: "It was about 10+ years ago. I had a rather bad idea to make something resembling
    water pipes, and I had this rather bad font in my work folder. It was one I was
    training myself to actually make from scratch at that time, so stupidly I just
    slapped those serifs on the end. \r\n\r\nDefinitely not a good idea. Plus at the
    time I was doing a lot of rubbishy free stuff, and some other unsavoury behaviour.
    As a fumbling amateur I didnt really consider ethics, or aesthetics of what I
    was doing.\r\n\r\nI havent improved much since. "
