  Fonts 3</em>, a companion to the award winning [[Indie Fonts]] series, brings together
  an additional 20 independent font foundries from around the world. This book is
  an invaluable resource of over 1,900 fonts for designers, art directors and typographers.\r\n\r\nThis
  book is divided up by foundry so that the user can get a feel for the work produced
  by each group. This also makes it convenient to order fonts directly from their
  source. There is a visual font index provided in the front for quick scanning and
  a fully cross referenced index in the back containing font names, designers, and
  original designers. Also included are the essays: <em>Eight Is Not Enough</em> by
  noted typophile [[Yves Peters]] and <em>How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love
  the EULA</em> by typographic designer and educator [[Tiffany Wardle]].\r\n\r\nContributing
  foundries include [[Baseline Fonts]], [[Blue Vinyl Fonts]], [[Device Fonts]], [[E-phemera
  Fonts]], [[Font Brothers]], [[Handselecta]], [[Jeremy Tankard Typography]], [[Kenn
  Munk]], [[Letterhead Fonts]], [[Pizzadude]], [[Positype]], [[Process Type Foundry]],
  [[Rimmer Type Foundry]], [[Shinntype]], [[SparkyType]], [[Suitcase Type Foundry]],
  [[Suomi Type Foundry]], [[Village]], [[Virus Fonts]], and [[Wilton Foundry]].\r\n\r\nAccompanying
  this book is a Bonus Fonts CD-ROM that contains 53 indie fonts. The fonts are licensed
  from each contributing foundry for use solely by the owner of this book.\r\n\r\nWebsites:
