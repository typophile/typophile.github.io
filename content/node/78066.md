  of a page from an old magazine on a [[http://blog.modernmechanix.com/|site]] devoted
  to the amusing contents of the popular science and mechanics magazines like Popular
  Science, Popular Mechanics, Science and Mechanics, and Mechanix Illustrated of long
  ago... impressed me as an example of just what I felt was truly invisible type.\r\n\r\nLooking
  through Linotype's One-Line Specimen book, I was able to determine that the little
  area on the lower right where we are told 'How to subscribe for \"Everyday Science
  and Mechanics.\"'... was set by means of two-line matrices which mixed Linotype's
  modern face \"No. 10\" with Gothic No. 4.\r\n\r\nThe body of the editorial, which
  is what I am concerned with, is in Linotype's version of Century Expanded - which
  seems every so slightly wider than Century Expanded as it came from ATF. Which explains
  why I was reluctant to think of Century Expanded as the perfect invisible typeface,
  and assumed that some admixture of Caslon, or the Scotch Roman from the Farmer foundry
  pictured in the DeVinne specimen, or Linotype's Number 22 would be necessary. (Century
  Schoolbook, of course, is wider than Century Expanded, but it's too bold and too
  much like a Clarendon to not be distracting.)"

  body: "There is no such thing as an \u2018invisible\u2019 typeface, nor is invisibility
    something that typographers have sought after. Most famously, Beatrice Warde likened
    the ideal of typography to a crystal goblet, something that is transparent to
    be sure, but hardly invisible."
