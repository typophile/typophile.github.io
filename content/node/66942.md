  body: "Florian, Mike: thanks for your help.\r\n\r\n<strong>Scenario</strong> is
    very similar but its serifs are soft-rounded while the font I'm looking for has
    straight serifs \u2013 although my attachment doesn't show it clearly. It seems
    to me unlikely that they customized even the serifs. I'm starting to think it
    may be a knock-off.\r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks again."

    some historic sample?"
