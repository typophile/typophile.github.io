I deliberately tried to trim down the number of fonts being bundled with the CS apps a bit in CS4 (and maybe a little before that in CS3, too long ago to remember now).

<p>@ Mr. Berlow, perhaps I was not clear enough. I have yet to own a personal license of InDesign. My previous experiences were with trail versions and full versions owned by employers. So there is nothing to install, since I never owned the app.</p>
<p>But this is becoming an interesting conversation. Are you saying that I could have &ldquo;extracted&rdquo;* all the bundled fonts from a trial app and kept them after it expired? IIRC, I had a trial of CS1 (or 2?) and CS3 (on 2 different computers).</p>
<p>*At least on Windows the bundled fonts are not installed in the fonts folder, but remain somewhere in the app folders (and you can use them only with the app).</p>

<p>Well, there&rsquo;s one thing we can agree on. Generally, <em>somebody</em> makes a decision.</p>
<p>Although actually there are also cases where there&rsquo;s never or rarely a conscious decision, just a cumulative effect of lots of little decisions (either independently, or building on top of each other).</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see bundling of fonts by OS or app vendors as any of those things Nick mentioned. However, I do largely agree with the argument that such bundling tends to drive down the perceived value of fonts in the minds of end users, which is the concern underlying Nick&rsquo;s harsh verbiage.</p>
<p>If the company either has a retail font business (like Adobe, even if it is tiny compared to their app business), or has a strategic interest in there being a healthy marketplace for fonts (Adobe, Apple and arguably Microsoft), then they need to think hard about how many and which fonts they bundle.</p>
<p>One part of font bundling that makes particular sense for Adobe is fonts as registration incentives. Those fonts get far more publicity/mileage and attention then the other bundled fonts, and they encourage product registration which is of special value to the company. They are actually perceived and marketed as added value in a way that the &ldquo;everyday&rdquo; bundled fonts are not so much.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

I wondered if the decision to cut back on the huge amount of bundling was motivated by a sense of fair play. You say more &ldquo;a strategic interest in there being a healthy marketplace for fonts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As for reputation, one can never know if the success of a bundled typeface is a result of merit or a lack of cost.
It must be reassuring to know that Arno worked well as a registration incentive. 
There are bundled typefaces that have been vilified for their popularity, Comic Sans and Papyrus of course.
Impact is another face which IMO doesn&rsquo;t get the respect it deserves.</p>

<p>For me, it&rsquo;s always a pleasure to get fonts bundled and I&rsquo;ve enjoyed using Arno, Myriad and Minion especially. IMO it doesn&rsquo;t detract from Slimbach&rsquo;s reputation to have his fonts bundled, even if it means they become much more widespread.</p>

there are a couple of issues now;  but if you or your company licence a product with fonts bundled 
you are not constrained to use them only with that application and whatever installation required for use such fonts is up to you, the licensed user.</p>
<p>It would be difficult to say it&rsquo;d be different with a beta or trial copy.</p>

I guess I came to the contrary conclusion because the fonts bundled with Adobe apps are not installed in the fonts folder (on machines running Win, at least).</div>

<p>@dberlow: certainly there are rarely any physical constraints, but the license can say whatever it likes regarding such restrictions. For example, at one time the license for Adobe Reader restricted the use of the bundled fonts (which were installed in a private folder) to use with Reader.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m just saying that one can make a good business case (for at least some companies) to be cautious in the extent of their bundling. That does not preclude there being other considerations as well. I do not agree that bundling fonts is &ldquo;unfair,&rdquo; but I do think it reduces the demand for retail font licensing. It also gives something of value to end users, whether or not they realize it.</p>

<p>Yes, that was my experience as well. App team: &ldquo;you want us to check our 2000 bundled templates to see which fonts we use, so that you can take something away from our customers?&rdquo; And of course the number of fonts not being used by somebody is pretty small&hellip;.</p>

<p>If Adobe wants customers to manage the Adobe fonts they possess according to incoming EULAs as they ship with the latest versions of the applications they licensed, just say so.

<p>If it wasn&rsquo;t obvious, I was avoiding references to anything specific, because I don&rsquo;t have time to go back through all our various font bundles and speak to whatever EULA they shipped with.</p>
<p>That said, it&rsquo;s safe to say that, yes, Adobe would like customers to honor whatever license agreement came with any fonts they might have. My point was that EULAs can vary, and a bundled font does not <!-- raw HTML omitted -->necessarily<!-- raw HTML omitted --> have the same EULA terms as a &ldquo;retail&rdquo; font.</p>
