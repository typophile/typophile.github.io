body: "Due to typophile.com I found out how I can program an opentype feature for
  random contextual alternates. (If anybody is interested and didn\xB4t find it yet:
  http://typophile.com/node/19625)\r\n\r\nthis is the code I found:\r\n\r\nfeature
  salt {\r\nlookup rotate {\r\nsub @set_1 @set_1' by @set_2;\r\nsub @set_2 @set_1'
  by @set_3;\r\nsub @set_3 @set_1' by @set_4;\r\nsub @set_4 @set_1' by @set_5;\r\nsub
  @set_5 @set_1' by @set_1;\r\n} rotate;\r\nlookup rotate;\r\n} salt;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYet,
  I wonder in which order I should put the charakter sets to make it work.\r\nDo I
  have to do it like this: A, A.alt1, A.alt2, A.alt3, B, B.alt1, B.alt2, B.alt3\r\nor
  rather A-Z, then A.alt1-Z.alt1 and so on?\r\nActually, the last example shows the
  way I did it, but it didn\xB4t work exept that (logical enough) the liga feature
  I added before, doesn\xB4t work anymore.\r\n\r\nOr is there a completely other way
  to arrange the glyphs?\r\n\r\nI ask this instead of just trying it because takes
  such a long time to re-arrange the glyphs. So, if anybody doesn\xB4 t know the answer
  to my first question, but knows how to change the arrangement of glyphs fast,  I
  appreciate it, too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks a lot!"
