  body: Would you happen to have any of those at even higher resolution? I'd love
    to use one or two for wallpapers.

  body: "All the new ones in those top ten rows, plus about 40 more I'll be posting
    in the next couple days. 20 more are now ready to publish tomorrow morning.\r\n\r\nThose
    are the only ones that would be easy to access right now. Let me know if you want
    any of those, and what resolution you'd like. Right now they are 3504x2336 (some
    have been cropped) and up to 4+ Mbs.\r\n\r\nPlease tell me the row and column."

  body: David, did you get them? I used your website address. In three posts, together
    they were almost 12 Mb after encoding. Please let me know so I can stop wondering
    if they got through ok.

  body: I got them all, I don't check that email much anymore. My portfolio is going
    under major reconstruction and so I've kind of ignored the current setup. Thanks!
