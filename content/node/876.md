body: This typeface just grew out of some doodles I made on my scorepad while playing
  a card game called &#34;kaiser&#34;. In my notebook, I&#39;ve designed the whole
  thing, uppercase and lowercase, plus much of the cyrillic alphabet, which has been
  an interesting experience. Below is all I&#39;ve had time to digitize so far.  <BR>
  <BR>So what is it? It&#39;s a bit of Bodoni, a bit of Dalliance, a bit of uncial,
  a bit of cursive, and some more geometric curves mixed in. I&#39;ve tried to give
  the uppercase letters a strong capline and strong vertical strokes, while playing
  loose with the bottom and descenders. <BR> <BR>The S has been giving me some grief;
  I&#39;m not quite sure what to do with it. Anyway, I welcome comments, and will
  hopefully have more coming soon. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/13982.gif"

    of &#34;M&#34; and &#34;W&#34;. &#34;Q&#34; is an interesting approach, too. I&#39;m

    <BR>I really like this though, can&#39;t wait to see more.

  body: I don&#39;t think the beaks work on the S. Mess around with a ball terminal
    on top and a beak on the bottom. &#40;That sounds dirty, doesn&#39;t it?&#41;
    Maybe try a curvier spine, as well, sort of taking after the A and N. <BR> <BR>I
    really dig the flavor of this thing.

  body: Nice face! &#40;Kinda sounds like saying &#39;nice head&#39; no?&#41; <BR>
    <BR>Anyway, I agree with Colin - try a ball terminal on the top of the &#39;s&#39;.
    <BR> <BR>I am looking forward to watching it develop. <BR> <BR>Mike

    like it. it has a very twisted feel to it. I agree about the &#39;S&#39;. It is
    too straight to fit in.  <BR> <BR> <BR>

  body: I have to agree with the previous posters on the &#34;S&#34;...as for the
    &#34;Q&#34;, I have mixed feelings about it...it&#39;s definitely got an original
    feel to it, but it almost feels like it&#39;s too much compared to the rest of
    the font...not sure what I&#39;d do with it, though.  I&#39;ll be watching the
    evolution of this one with interest.  :-&#41;
