  <BR> <BR>As is the case with many others on this site, this is the first typeface
  I have attempted to immortalize in binary code. I feel it is quite different from
  anything I have seen. Taking a page from architecture, the wine glass, and Tuscans
  &#40;type, not people&#41; has led me to here. As you can see there is a distinct
  lack of lower case; that is soon to come. <BR> <BR>Right now, I would consider this
  a Titling face, but I do have intentions of developing a full featured family including,
  of course, text. Specifically, I would entertain suggestions as to how this could
  be accopmlished; some of the details seem too fine and eccentric to carry across
  to a face intended for small sizes and I am unsure how to rectify this. <BR> <BR>Of
  the letters shown here, M and N are giving me trouble. <BR> <BR>Your feedback would
  be much appreciated. Thanks.

  body: I think you&#39;ve stumbled upon something quite original. I really like the
    feeling of this face and will look forward to seeing the lowercase and eventual
    text weights of it. <BR> <BR>Looking at it now, the M, H, and T seem too wide
    to me but like the shape of them. Also, on the C, it seems to be the only glyph
    you&#39;ve used the round end on the bottom and could be inconsistant with the
    rest of the face. Either try integrating it more into the face or ditch it entirely
    but it may be too inconsistant on its own. <BR> <BR>Regarding the N, it seems
    that without some sort of wider ending serifs it looks like its from another weight
    of this family. I&#39;d try to keep the feel you&#39;ve got going and integrate
    wider tapers and serifs in it. <BR> <BR>Overall for your first digitization of
    an original  typeface, it looks very nice. I&#39;ll be looking forward to seeing
    more of the family. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not certain what direction the lowercase
    could go in from here? Feel free to chime in if you have suggestions gang . .
    . <BR> <BR>Keep it up, looking nice! <BR> <BR>Stuart :D

    Preview"> <BR> <BR>I finally found some time to do the rest of the uppercase and
    make some changes. This is turning out to be slower going than I thought it would
    be. <BR> <BR>Also, I&#39;m considering changing the name to Corvine. Although,
    that may reserved for a family name, and have complimentary faces within the family
    named Rook, Raven and Crow. Just something I&#39;m tossing around for now. <BR>
    <BR>S gave me a massive headache and I could use some suggestions on how to make
    bezier curves behave; it seems like everything I try makes it really lumpy. I&#39;m
    also aware there are minor weight issues throughout and I think X, Y, M and N
    might be too narrow, but feel free to let me know what you think.

  body: 'Hi Michael, <BR> <BR>Some thoughts: <BR>- I think the N and M are ok for
    width. <BR>- The X and Y are indeed narrow. <BR>- Weighting issues: I think your
    main weighting problem is with your thin strokes. They are inconsistant, even
    within characters. For example. The top, bottom and crossbar of the E, all three
    different. The | and / on the M etc. Unless you are really going for a three weight
    font, I&#39;d suggest optically adjusting everything to two weights. <BR>- Check
    your U. It should be consistant with your diagonal stress. <BR>- Also your J.
    The bottom is heavy/awkward. <BR>- The S: The s is a thing of symmetry. The first
    thing I do is drop in guides to help me. All the bezier curves that make up the
    spine should run parallel to these guides. The diagram in the lower right is a
    sabon bold outline. Start with these points. Notice how symmetrical the handles
    look. Yours may look a little different, but should still be symmentrical. After
    you have the spine working the way you want it. Add in the blue points &#40;keep
    a version without them for making changes&#41;. Oops, I just noticed my topmost
    and bottom most points... they should be slightly staggered like the sabon example
    because of the diagonal stress.  <BR> <BR>Things I notice about your S: <BR>-
    It&#39;s rocking backwards. Extend the bottom to the left. The final letter should
    fit inside a trapazoid &#40;you&#39;ve got a parallagram&#41;. <BR>- Your stress
    is different on top and bottom. This gets really obvious when you put the guides
    in!  <BR> <BR>I spent the time because I think you&#39;ve got something nice happening
    here. Hope it was helpful. Good work. <BR> <BR>Randy <BR> <BR> <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/11532.gif"

  body: Michael - agreeing with the comments above. Nice work <BR>so far. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d
    look at the X and the Z, too. <BR> <BR>The Z seems a little bit too angled/laid
    back. <BR> <BR>The X - maybe the stilts or teacup-serif-thingies <BR>could be
    splayed instead of upright.  <BR> <BR>I see this working well for book titles.
    <BR> <BR>good luck <BR> <BR>brian
