  writing my own brief for a college project and I&#39;ve decided to design my own
  typeface in a minimalist style. As I&#39;m a complete novice I only have limited
  knowledge of type but I love typograpghy and so I&#39;ve set myself this task. I&#39;m
  not asking for my work to be done but any nippets of advice would be greatly appreciated,
  like things to avoid or whats a good programme to develop my font in. Any help would
  be fantastic.  <BR> <BR>Bec

  body: I&#39;d recommend fontlab, or it&#39;s paired down little brother, typetool
    available at <a href="http://www.fontlab.com" target="_blank">http://www.fontlab.com</a>.
    There really isn&#39;t another good option. I would also recommend Leslie Cabarga&#39;s
    book Learn Fontlab Fast. Available at the fontlab website. <BR> <BR>Randy

    is a great intro about how to begin to draw and design letters and typefaces,
    and is less technically specific that <i>Learn FontLab Fast,</i> yet still offers
    some good tips. It is a fantastic book! <BR> <BR>In terms of advice, the only
    pieces that I can think of without hearing more about what you would like to do
    are these: <BR>1. Design &#40;draw&#41; entire words first, not single letters.
    Letters in a typeface don&#39;t exist in a vacuum, but rather in context with
    one another. <BR> <BR>2. Remember the negative spaces! The spaces inside the letters,
    and the spacing in between the letters is just as important as the letterforms
    themselves. Erik Spiekermann wrote that type designers don&#39;t design marks
    on a page, but rather the spaces around those marks &#40;or something like that'

  body: thanks for the advice. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m looking at stripping down the individual
    letters  to their most minimal form, I want to play around with how far I can
    take them before they become unrecognisable. I&#39;m still in the proposal part
    of my idea so I&#39;m still working out what I&#39;d like to do.  <BR> <BR>Bec

  body: 'Rebecca, it probably won&#39;t surprise you that experimetal minimalism in
    type has been attempted by a number of people in the past. But that doesn&#39;t
    mean you shouldn&#39;t try your own hand it. In fact I would recommend that you
    specifically <i>avoid</i> looking at other past attempts at this! This is such
    an extreme thing that it&#39;s necessarily personal, and outside influences can
    stunt the critical early stage of the process. <BR> <BR>We could give more advice
    about specific &#34;tricks of the trade&#34; shall we say but it seems to me that&#39;s
    tangential right now. You&#39;re not planning on producing a mainstream text face,
    and trying to absorb too much of the craft too early might actually distract you
    from the whole point of your effort. I guess the one general thing I myself would
    recommend though is this: observe the alphabet, in all its incarnations, to try
    to get at its essence, and thereby the essence of its elements - remembering that
    the letters are only really themselves in the context of the whole system. <BR>
    <BR>So maybe do your own thing, in private, but then do please show us what you
    got! <BR> <BR>hhp'

    Hrant.  I think Typophiles vision of meritocracy may be flawed. <BR> <BR>On a
    related note - you now have 5 stars &#40;twice&#41;. <BR> <BR>Jay

  body: 'I dont mean to hi-jack this thread: <BR> <BR>I have yet to start designing
    my own face as I am also new to type design, but I am starting to analyze letterforms
    as much as I can to get a good idea and figuring out how the strokes and such
    are designed and what style of letters I like most &#40;like double bowl g and
    two story a&#39;&#41; but soon enough I will eventually start my own. However
    one thing I know I need to work on and I know good type design execution relies
    on it, being able to master beziars curves. <BR> <BR>I have heard of some people
    taking existing typefaces and re drawing them, for instance I think I read on
    here somewhere that someone started out as a way to get practice was re drawing
    Gill Sans. Is something liek this a good way to get started in terms of execution?'

  body: My idea moved away from designing my own type face to looking at how to communicate
    in a minimal way using typography. Though the initial idea is there, I bought
    the book that recommended by Dan and its fantastic!  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not sure
    how you master bezier curves, though I have redrawn several fonts for previous
    projects, that is a good place to start.
