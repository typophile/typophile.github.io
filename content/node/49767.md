  body: "Jordan, et al\r\n\r\nVery interesting and fun programs. I came away with
    two thoughts.\r\n\r\n1)By the time that the demos finished several letters most
    calligraphers would have been finished with \"the piece.\" 2) As an origination
    program it definitely has its pluses, but would fall short when it came to the
    subtle nuances that can be achieved with pen manipulation. In the \"n\" example
    below (FB Pouty) the black dots represent attitudinal (angle) shifts and in most
    cases an addition of pressure on the pen to create waisting. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/italic_3431.png]\r\n\r\nI
    guess what I am trying to say is that they are wonderfully basic tools (or just
    a starting point), so why not do it with ink and pen and get the whole enchilada
    at one time. Don't get me wrong... I embrace technology, I just prefer the human
    touch.\r\nMichael"

  body: "well, Michael, nothing against human touch and nothing against technology
    I would say:-)))\r\nFor the last 10 years I have really had enough work with paper,
    ink, and nibs - especially with copperplate ones - I got tired and decided to
    begin digital way of life following tradition - it's really a lot diffrent, but
    when one has enough experience in traditional calligraphy then trying digital
    - believe me, one gets wings!!!:-)))\r\n. . . and I am happy with this so I am
    stuck to this SOFTWARE SEARCH AFFAIR:-)\r\n__________________________\r\nwww.behance.net/epixs\r\nepixs@yahoo.com\r\n+359887323000"

  body: "I've been looking for such a software too.\r\n\r\nI have tested Inkscape
    and CorelDraw and there are some things that differentiate them.\r\nWhile in Inkscape,
    using the Wacom Intuos tablet, is getting closer to the traditional way of writing
    calligraphic texts, in CorelDraw things can be more precisely controlled but less
    of a gesture.\r\n\r\nIn CorelDraw there is an \"export to TTF\" option.\r\nIn
    Inkscape (the latest build, not yet 0.47) there is the possibility of saving brush
    settings. And spiro.\r\n\r\nHere are some of the tests I did in Inkscape.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/800
    inkscape_6450.jpg]\r\n\r\nOne advantage of digital calligraphy is that kerning
    can be adjusted. One disadvantage is the lack of texture like in epixs works from
    behance gallery.\r\n\r\nI haven't tested Illustrator yet.\r\n\r\nI think working
    with traditional tools and then scanning, tracing and adjusting is much easier
    and better for now."
