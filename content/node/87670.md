body: "I was wondering if any of you haave worked with a vendor that laser cuts paper.
  If so, would you be willing to share your vendor's name and contact info? Additionally,
  are there any tidbits of advice you can pass along in terms of keeping costs down,
  what types of paper work best, etc?\r\n\r\nAfter doing a preliminary search on Google,
  it appears there are several sources to choose from. However, I always like to patronize
  vendors that a fellow designer finds helpful, reliable and do an all-around great
  job.\r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance."

    shows here in The Netherlands & spoke to them to have me quote covers for brochures
    on a project I had then. Project was skipped so I never actually had the change
    working with them but hope to in the near future. I'm sure they know how to ship
    stuff to you safely ;-)\r\n\r\nHere's another sample of what they do: http://youtu.be/Bc4Xy9npmUY\r\n\r\nI'd
    wish for regular projects like this...!\r\n\r\nCheers, JB"
