  body: Can't be positive but to me, it looks like a mix of a Bookman Italic Swash
    /F and Garamond Italic /inest. You could for instance borrow /F from [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/bookmania/italic/glyphs.html#glyphs/519890/717|Bookmania
    stylistic alternates]] (Mark Simonson's revival of Bookman Oldstyle) and /inest
    to [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/adobe-garamond|Garamond AT]].
