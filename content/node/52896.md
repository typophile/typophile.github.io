body: "I am involved with a small group of Freethinkers in Fort Wayne, Indiana that
  want to eventually incorporate, and an trying to help spiffy up their design. Although
  I like to think I'm pretty good with typography, logo developing isn't really my
  thing, so I figured this is a great place to gather some ideas.\r\n\r\nIn case you
  don't know, the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freethought|Freethought movement]]
  is to promote critical thinking, science, and logic, and reject dogma, superstition.
  Things like pro-science, evolution, positive atheism, and secular humanism go hand-in-hand
  with our group, which as you can imagine is often a touchy subject, considering
  we're in conservative Indiana.\r\n\r\nAttached is our current logo designed by an
  enthusiastic founding member, which is more of just a stylized wordmark. It's nice,
  but it doesn't really have anything to do with freethinking, or any of the above
  points I was talking about. I've included a few other concepts.\r\n\r\nI've been
  thinking about trying to use a graphic of a brain, or a head in there somewhere.
  Something that implies thinking. Basically, I need something punchy, simple, and
  looks good in B&W and color as well (with only a couple colors, maybe blue and black?)
  If we could incorporate our tagline, \"Be Reasonable.\", it would be better all
  the more.\r\n\r\nHere are some ideas, heavily inspired by a couple awesome iStockphoto
  graphics.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_concepts_5518.jpg]\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas, concerns, brainstorms? Thank you for your time, and I love this forum. It's
  always a wellspring of good, constructive criticism!\r\n\r\n-Andy"

    you want to target.\r\n\r\nTo attract fellow freethinkers, I think a logo more
    in the style of your avatar would make more sense...maybe something with a bit
    of humour. A head with the top sliced off and a funnel.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other
    hand, the target is the community at-large, then I think you probably need a more
    conservative/straight-forward type treatment with perhaps a more abstract symbol. "

    not sure how practical the tangle of wires would be though.\r\n\r\nIt's been said
    plenty of time in these forums: Don't go right to the computer - sketch first."

  body: "I think #1 is a strong concept and a great use of space. 2 is really good,
    but I worry that people might think someone botched a gradient, using two fewer
    steps in the blend might work better. 3 is cool but won\u2019t scale well without
    multiple versions or manual intervention, so save it for a t-shirt. 4 feels like
    a throw-away. \r\n\r\nAcross the board:\r\n\u2022The caps are tracked much too
    tight, and will look better in a lighter weight.\r\n\u2022Capitalize \u201CFort
    Wayne\u201D. Proper nouns in sans-serif lowercase feels very dated.\r\n\u2022Do
    <em>not</em> incorporate your tagline into your logo. A tagline is a tagline,
    a logo is a logo. If you want to use them together that\u2019s fine, but you\u2019ll
    get better results by leaving the tagline out of the logo and treating it as a
    separate entity."

  body: The black profile head reminds me of Victorian-era silhouettes - very dated
    to me. I agree with Scott - I rather like the string of lights concept and think
    more sketches along those lines might lead to something.

  body: "Boy, you really get around, Andy!  This is the second time I've stumbled
    upon you.\r\n\r\nThanks for calling my logo nice.  I hadn't figured out what image
    to put with it.  It was intended for simple recognition by anyone, and to be easily
    reducible.  I was hoping to add something along the lines of what you were thinking
    or just making a completely new one.\r\n\r\nI talked with the other Andy and he
    said we are welcome over there any time to work on developing a new logo.  We
    just need to get together to brainstorm and pound out a few more ideas.\r\n\r\nI
    like your way of thinking though.  Forums like this one are full of great ideas
    and good suggestions:\r\n\r\nJames Puckett had a good suggestion concerning keeping
    our logo separate from our tag-line.\r\n\r\naluminum's idea of a sliced head with
    a funnel sounds interesting.  We might have to play around with that one a little
    bit.\r\n\r\nThanks for the help everyone!\r\n\r\nJake D.\r\n "

    themselves somewhat on breaking the bounds of traditional thinking.  It would
    be nice to communicate this by introducing some irregularity into the design.
    \ Something irregular, but considered.  Not punk, freethought.\r\n\r\nI'll post
    some specifics if I get time to sit down and play with this."

  body: "I agree with James, about the type treatment. The whole lightbulb in the
    head thing is rather overused, and doesn't necessarily promote free thought, but
    an realization. Why is Free Thought one word? If it's a movement then shouldn't
    there be some sort of community aspect brought into the logo? I think number 4
    is probably the closest out of the samples to express that, but I agree, it's
    more an electrical based theme.\r\n\r\nFor some reason, a 50's style mind control
    type of image came to mind."
