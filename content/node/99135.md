  have 3 logos I have come down to choosing. The name of the company is NE Elements,
  which is a play on the word any, so its really \"Any Elements.\" The point being
  we use the elements of man to design things. Please look at the 3 logos posted in
  black and white and pick the one you like. I haven't designed any with color yet,
  and will move on with that once I choose a logo. Thanks all for your help. Feedback
  is very welcome. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/3logos_6515.jpg]"

    widths are off. If you really do want them different, make the \"E\" even wider*;
    otherwise make the \"N\" wider (which would allow you to make the diagonal symmetrically
    placed) and the \"E\" narrower.\r\n\r\n* Although that would exacerbate the density
    imbalance between the two.\r\n\r\nAs for the smaller text, I would avoid all three
    of those fonts (although the middle one could be cleaned up to be usable).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "My first impression is that all three logos look a bit old-fashioned, like
    something that might have been designed in the 1960s. They suggest engineering
    or construction more than design. The three presentations of <em>NE</em> remind
    me of interchangeable building blocks or modules. Possibly for this reason, I'm
    not getting the hint that it's a play on \"any.\"  \r\nMaybe you could do a visual
    play on \"elements,\" using the layout of an element on the periodic table. (If
    your target market isn't related to science, technology, or education, this solution
    might be a little too geeky.)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Neon_3871.jpg]\r\nWhat
    do you mean by \"use the elements of man to design things\"? Does your business
    have something to do with ergonomics? If so, you might do better to use some organic
    forms rather than geometric ones.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/modulor_800_4568.jpg]\r\n(Le
    Corbusier's Modulor, the classic visual symbol for using the elements of man to
    design things.) "

    that phrase.\r\n\r\nI agree that the first rendition is the most workable. \r\n\r\nMojo's
    version is illegible. With luck, I might read it as a jumbled \"Elements\" \u2014
    no way I'd think of \"any\"."
