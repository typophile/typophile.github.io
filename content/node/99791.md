  a metrically equivalent replacement for it, so I made one. My concept is \"what
  if Vincent Connare had a ruler?\" I'm trying to maintain the character that people
  love about Comic Sans, while removing the oddities and irregularities. Using the
  same metrics means there is still plenty of WTF in here, but hopefully it is an
  improvement. This is my first font, so it's probably pretty rough.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/spans

  also need a name. I was thinking \"Liberation Comic\", but it wouldn't officially
  be a part of the Liberation fonts. Maybe \"Comic Spans\" because it spans the same
  space as Comic Sans."

  body: "I could never understand why people hate Comic Sans. I for one think that
    it serves it's purpose well and those who dislike it are just misdirecting their
    dissatisfaction of seeing lay people use it in their designs towards Comic Sans.
    Comic Spans sounds reasonable but I have a feeling that if Mr. Connare used a
    ruler then the outcome would have been different than what you have done, like
    the sample below. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/VagR_5948.png]"

  body: "I don't hate Comic Sans, but it certainly does have some less desirable aspects.
    Mostly, it is super inconsistent. I tried to line up the vertical strokes, and
    make everything the same height, and avoid the handwriting squiggles. I know there
    are tons of other comic fonts out there, and the world doesn't need another one.
    I just wanted to give people an alternative that fits in the same space, and doesn't
    suck quite as much.\r\n\r\nI figured out the name, too. Comic Relief.\r\n\r\nWhat
    is that font, by the way? "

  body: Why metrically equivalent? I can't imagine there are a ton of crucial documents
    in Comic Sans for which you are worried about reflowing the text. Was that just
    a shortcut for your design process?

  body: "Shortcut? It's <em>more</em> work... It's not like Comic Sans has like cosmically
    good spacing worth copying.  :-)\r\n\r\nAnd I think if the plan is to come very
    close to the black forms of some existing font, you might as well make the spacing
    identical, just in case...\r\n\r\nOne thing though, Jeff: I'm not sure this would
    be OK to release - and even less OK to sell. Apple might have gotten away with
    Chalkboard, but that's why some people don't respect Apple's role in typography
    any more.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
