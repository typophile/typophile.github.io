  to find a place called the <a href=\"http://www.bedplatepress.org.nz/\">Bedplate
  Press Printing Museum</a>. The chaps there are total enthusiasts, all skilled in
  various areas of letterpress, Intertype / Linotype machines, rotary & platen presses.
  The have a fairly solid collection of wood type, hand-set metal type (Univers! Yes!)
  and those Linotype/Intertype matrices (I think that is what they are called). It
  is most definately a working museum. \r\n\r\nAnyway, my head was reeling last night,
  all I dreamed about was what I could do with this stuff. However, I am aware that
  it may be of limited interest to other people, especially in New Zealand. So I was
  wondering what we could do to garner interest in the museum. What have others done
  to revive interest in this beautiful technology? Who would be the ideal people to
  target? What sort of businesses would benefit from letterpress printing? \r\n\r\nAny
  ideas would be gratefully received. \r\n\r\n\u2014K"

  body: "Hi Kris,\r\n\r\nWe have a similar place here called the <a href=\"http://home.vicnet.net.au/~typo/welcome.htm\">Melbourne
    Museum of Printing</a>. It's called a museum, but it's basically a huge warehouse
    o' stuff in piles that survives because of the passion of a dedicated few. I've
    been a couple of times to see the machines they have working in action, and the
    main guy, Michael, gets so excited. It's brilliant. \r\n\r\nOne way that they've
    tried to get themselves out into the public eye (well, the design public eye anyway)
    is through the AGIdeas design conference that runs annually here in Melbourne.
    Design Nights are held on the first night of the conference where groups of students
    get to go and spend an evening at a design studio somewhere around Melbourne.
    MMP has been involved over the last two years, and from what I've heard the nights
    have been very successful, with students heading back later to get a print or
    a bit of type made for an assignment, or whatever. "

  body: "Hi Kris,\r\nA few years ago I think they wanted to move their equipment into
    the city, potentially in partnership with Massey's School of Design. Obviously,
    nothing came of it. Which is a pity, as both Victoria and Otago universities both
    have their own antique press facilities. Used for both comercial and academic
    purposes.\r\nLink:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.otago.ac.nz/nzpg/print/research.html\">Otago</a>\r\n<a
    href=\"http://www.vuw.ac.nz/wtapress/\">Victoria</a>\r\nIt would seem to be the
    kind of thing that the Designer's Institute would have some interest in too. Maybe.\r\n\r\nDavid"

    with Massey, but it fell through. It was going to be too expensive etc. I am sure
    that there must be a government fund somewhere to help out. \r\n\r\nThanks for
    all the replies so far! Very helpful. Any more?\r\n\r\nK"

    such a collection. You could e-mail them and ask them what they are doing to promote
    themselves. One thing is that they have regular visits from students at design
    schools in the area. \r\n\r\nI visited it this spring and it is wonderful. \r\n\r\nAnother
    thing they are doing is co-sponsoring TypeCon this year. There will be a trip
    to the museum also as a final activity. \r\n\r\nThe Museum of Printing also holds
    the Merganthaller Linotype library of over 250 thousand measured drawings of type,
    including Dwiggins' types--pretty amazing stuff. "
