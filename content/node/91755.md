  movie theater. Out front he wants to put up a wedding announcement poster in the
  style of an old horror film. Think 1931 Dracula for instance. Here are some examples:\r\n\r\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/df/Dracula1931poster.jpg\r\nhttp://www.movie-list.com/posters/big/zoom/dracula31.jpg\r\nhttp://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Rpy6Kg3cdyM/TbrjDVfhe9I/AAAAAAAAAB8/ozA1B8JHvnA/s1600/dracula_1931_movie_poster_76.jpg\r\n\r\nNow,
  all these were hand lettered. Often they were hand lettered but in the style of
  period typefaces. Can anybody suggest typefaces that might work for this purpose,
  that look hand lettered like that?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nT"

    look and altogether ooky...\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/boo-meringue-nf/regular/glyphs.html\r\n\r\nAs
    an added bonus, there are ghosts and haunted houses lurking within the character
    set."

    later in the 1930s, more art deco, but could be useful. Is Tovarich available?\r\n\r\nThanks,
    all."
