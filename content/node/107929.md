  time I restart my mac, most of my font sets are missing their actual font files.
  The sets are still there, but a \"0\" indicates there is no font. All my directories
  have remained the same, and I can re-add these fonts to the sets, but they keep
  disappearing in the list of sets. Anyone else having this issue?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screenshot

    that's not much of an answer. Have you contacted them for support?"
