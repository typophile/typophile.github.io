body: 'I''m working on a font I started a few years ago that is based on handwriting
  from the 1800s. My experience with various alternate figure style is pretty limited,
  but I don''t see a style or feature to fit what I want to do. Hopefully I can figure
  out how to get an image to show. Basically I want to create figures that when triggered
  by the dollar sign / numbers / period come in like superiors. I write checks like
  this and have seen samples of it handwritten, but don''t know if this is done typographically.
  I haven''t started building any feature code yet, so I''m very open to suggestions. '

  body: Would you show us the contrasting form? You could of course create two fonts
    for this - one with your 'monetary figures' and one with lining or tabular or
    what ever you like. Or you could build a single font with stylistic alternates
    built in. The question is - who do you want to be able to access the feature.
    People who have CS3 or people who just have whatever ships with MS or Apple or
    Linux? If it's the later than a separate font makes some sense since the 'feature'
    will be more accessible. Another angle is that you could force it's use in an
    OT font when a $ sign ( or other currency sign) is present.

  body: 'I was thinking of doing this as a strictly OT version. So my thoughts were
    to code it in where a dollar sign followed by a string of number followed by a
    period would be followed by superior figures. That way it wouldn''t come up in
    unwanted places. I''d have to experiment to get the feature code to work, but
    there is probably a way. I''m not sure if this would go under a calt feature or
    perhaps even a case feature. Stylistically I think it works for a handwriting
    style font. I just have the original CS of creative suite, but I think if I get
    it to work for that CS3 would also. '

    have to check every possible number of digits seperately. \r\n\xBB$ a.bb\xAB,
    \xBB$ aa.bb\xAB, ... , \xBB$ aaaaaaaaa.bb\xAB and so on. \r\nAnd of course this
    would all fail, if the user would use a different currency symbol or would add
    commas or spaces.\r\n\r\nOr are you be the only person using this font?\r\n\r\nI
    think I would be more convenient to use a stylistic set and apply it locally with
    character styles. "

  body: "So would I have to create 100 superior figure ligatures ( .00 .01 .02 ...
    ) to follow the period? I suppose that could work, if there isn't a simpler way.
    Maybe then \xBBClig\xAB would be the way to go. I probably wouldn't carry the
    dollar side beyond a thousand as the cents would become a bit trivial. It is after
    all a display font as opposed to a corporate or math font."

  body: "Since the only real ligature I would use for the cent side would be for an
    even dollar amount (00), could I create a special set of Monetary Superiors? Then
    I would do a series of dollar / figures / period to get the first @msup, and follow
    that by another @msup substitution?\r\n\r\n\r\nsub dollar @figure period @figure'
    by @msup;\r\nsub dollar @figure @figure period @figure' by @msup;\r\nsub dollar

    five.msup six.msup seven.msup eight.msup nine.msup ];\r\n\r\nThis seems like it
    would work along the same lines as fractions are composed.\r\nOf course, I have
    no experience with creating fractions either, so excuse me if this makes no sense.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Good point that you would only need a single \"00\" ligature, if that's really
    what you want. You don't want small numbers for everything? And if you have numerators
    or superiors that suit the purpose, I think you could just use those, e.g.\r\n\r\n<code>sub
    period @figures' by @figures_superior;\r\nsub period @figures_superior @figures'
    by @figures_superior;</code>\r\n\r\n(I'm leaving out extra context, like preceding
    currency and numbers, like Georg wrote, but you can put as much of that in as
    necessary.)\r\n\r\nOne thing to keep in mind is that different countries write
    such figures differently -- such as using a comma where we in the U.S.A. use a
    period. Your font could very well end up annoying people in Europe! In theory,
    you could make different contextual substitution rules depending on the particular
    currency symbol that's used, but in my experience, these tricky kinds of things
    usually end up getting too complicated -- and one ends up making the substitution
    discretionary (i.e 'dlig') instead of on by default (i.e. 'liga').\r\n\r\nIt seems
    like there might be a more clever way to do all this, but rarely does such cleverness
    come to me immediately.  :-)"

    get overly complicated, so I will try to figure out the wider scope of things
    so I don't go \"annoying people in Europe\". I just started working with OT less
    than a year ago and its a big learning curve for me, but I'm getting there. If
    all goes well this will be my 3rd OT font.\r\n\r\nI'm very grateful to be able
    to use the Typophile forum. Its a wonderful resource with a fabulous group of
