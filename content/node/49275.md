body: "Hello everyone,\r\n\r\nI am trying to avoid using a double hard return between
  my paragraphs. The problem I am running into is when using 2+ columns that baselines
  are not lining up. Is there a trick to keeping them aligned (using cs3) or due to
  the difference of number of breaks there is no way.\r\n\r\nHere is an example:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Example_4065.jpg]\r\n\r\nSecond
  question: If there is no way then what do you feel is more important, keeping the
  sentences aligned across the columns or keeping to the no double hard returns.\r\n\r\nthanks!"

    full blank line between paragraphs, only extra space. In these cases, for lines
    to line up across columns, the space after paragraph has to equal the leading
    or a whole number times the leading. / Make sure your Align to Baseline Grid button
    (in the Paragraph panel or Control panel) is pressed. / By the way, in your example,
    I would go with no extra spacing and an indented first line (indentation equal
    to body size). This makes it clear to the reader that he\u2019s looking at a coherent
    text, not a collection of excerpts, and it makes sure that the reader is never
    in doubt whether or not there is paragraph break hidden in a given column or page
    break coinciding with a period."

    make the gap between the paragraph breaks 60-80% smaller then you would get from
    a double hard return, hence the smaller gaps. Is this wrong? I am using 10pt type
    with 12 pt leading, so I was decreasing the paragraph break to about 9.5 pt. Should
    I keep them at 12 pt?\r\n\r\np@rick"

  body: "No, you\u2019re right, when you use spaces between paragraphs, they should
    be small enough that they  can\u2019t be confused with blank lines. I would say
    8 points in your case. Trouble is, with good looking paragraph spaces like these,
    you have to sacrifice aligning across columns. To me, this is just another good
    reason to abandon the whole space between paragraphs idea altogether and stick
    to the good old indent. Elegant, robust, working."

  body: "Another option, if you prefer the look of space between paragraphs, is to
    use a blank line of half the leading. (Personally, I'd probably set it up as Space
    Before, rather than a hard return). You can also then set your Baseline Grid to
    half the leading to facilitate layout.\r\n\r\nBy using exactly half the leading,
    you'll get a fairly pleasing syncopation between your columns: lines will either
    be exactly aligned or a half beat off, coming in and out of alignment in a regular
    rhythm with each paragraph.\r\n\r\nThis can be an acceptable scheme in some layouts.
    You won't be able to count on aligning the bottoms of all columns, so it works
    best with a looser, less formal page design."

    only one column of text to deal with, but it fails to work when one wants to keep
    multiple columns aligned. It really comes down to what degree of order you want
    in your layouts."

    hyphens seem surprisingly high, almost on the x-height, I normally try to avoid
    hyphenation in a document, however, if you can\u2019t avoid using them, have a
    look at the hyphenation options, my feeling is that you should avoid hyphenating
    any proper nouns, some words have broken awkwardly \u2013 Appren-tice for example.\r\n\r\nTim"
