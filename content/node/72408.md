  body: "The sans could also be Avant Garde or Neutraface.\r\nIf buying Avant Garde,
    make sure you get a version with the ligatures. Most commercial versions don't
    have them, but it was pretty much the point of the font as it was first designed.

  body: "Do you happen to have a larger sample? The geometric sans-serif looks a bit
    quirkier than Futura or Avant Garde Gothic: the \u2018N\u2019 is extremely narrow,
    the \u20181\u2019 has a diagonal hook, the zero appears to be a perfect circle
    (granted, the latter could also be the letter \u2018O\u2019)."
