  body: "It is very similar to Arial Bold \u2013 but the corners... they look so round
    and soft compared Arial's, don't you think?"

  body: I see... it does give Arial Bold a nice look and readability for the screen,
    doesn't it? Would you perhaps know any of the 'means of reproduction as subtitles'
    I could recreate to achieve the same result? Thanks.

    font, one that\u2019s already \u201Csoft on the corners\u201D, such as Calibri."

  body: Calibri looks very good for achieving the "soft corner" results, thank you
