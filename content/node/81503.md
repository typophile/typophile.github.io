body: "I'm looking for some display type for a book. The book will contain lots of
  images of objects (kites, actually) that have type on them, and I'd like to use
  a display type that's similar. I've attached an image.\r\n\r\nI feel like I've seen
  block lettering like this 1000 times, but just can't come up with anything quite
  right. Most very square fonts are too industrial/techy, or too literally constructivist.
  The subject matter is Central American, so Russian stuff is all wrong. There's also
  a pretty strong link to Mayan culture, so something like Copal could work, though
  Copal itself is far too whimsical. A handmade look is ok, but nothing too informal.\r\n\r\nThe
  closest I've gotten is Paz by Sudtipos. It's too wide and too industrial though.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for the help..."
