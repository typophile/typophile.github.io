  body: "I looked in some old Photo-Lettering catalogs and didn't see a match, or
    even anything particularly close. It seems to combine features of Bodoni with
    Caslon. In fact I think it's more like Caslon than anything else I can find (except
    for the T). The A is somewhat like an exaggerated Caslon A, with a much longer
    than usual overhang of the right stroke.\r\n\r\nIf I were trying to re-create
    this I would use a Caslon with the most similar R, and then plug in a Bodoni T.
    You would probably need to re-draw the A. I've seen A's like that somewhere, but
    I can't think of a font offhand.\r\n\r\nMy guess, especially because you can't
    find any other letters, is that this is custom lettering.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
