  <BR> <BR>...it&#39;s bad, I know. <BR> <BR>I moderate their official forum, and
  we get kids all the time asking what it is.  <BR> <BR>I was referred here and told
  that you guys were the experts.

  body: I would think so, but I swear I used to have this font on my old computer.
    I remember going through deleting the ugly ones, and I&#39;m pretty sure this
    was one of them. <BR> <BR>I could, of course, be wrong. &#40;!&#41;

  body: Do you really think it&#39;s ugly? Tho it&#39;s something  <BR>I probably
    wouldn&#39;t use, I think it&#39;s a very well  <BR>executed concept and it looks
    way kewl. <BR> <BR>Let&#39;s hear if anybody else has seen it before... <BR> <BR>NEVER
    delete ugly fonts, you&#39;ll never know when  <BR>they might come in handy. <BR><i>Typographer&#39;s

  body: Funny stuff. I never delete ugly fonts I have &#39;em all categorised as &#34;circus
    fonts&#34; in neat little folders ready to never be used. But you never know...  <BR>
    <BR>I am pretty sure though that this particular font is not in any of my circus-mania
    folders. Sorry

    too many. One of those things where I used to download every single one I could
    find and just got sick of sifting through them. It was on my old PC anyway, so
    I wouldn&#39;t have it regardless.

    target="_blank">before</a>. Nevertheless, I <a href="http://www.thecomatorium.com/media/fonts/marshosbn.zip"
    target="_blank">found</a> a Mars Volta Font &#40;right click .. save as&#41;,
    but I think it came after the original logo. Hope it helps.
