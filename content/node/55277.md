body: Thank you in advance. I am looking for font similar to the attached (only the
  all caps examples). I have lots of bitmap/pixelated fonts, but nothing this thin
  in weight. Any suggestions?  (not anti-aliasing the type when i export to photoshop
  is an option, but the letter spacing gets all wonky).  Thanks.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/version01_3645.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/version02_5635.jpg]
