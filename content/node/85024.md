  It looks like some variant of Caslon, not sure though.\r\n\r\nLow res, sorry (update:
  [[http://www.unav.es/gep/Ginsburg.jpg|here's another one]]). There is also [[http://books.google.com/books?id=uf-bvPKMR3cC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false|a
  reprint]] of the collection of early issues on Google Books with preview (actually
  reprinted from the old scanned version).\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "The V in the italic \"Vita\" does seem to be a dead giveaway for Caslon.\r\n\r\nIt
    definitely is not Caslon 540, as it has long descenders.\r\n\r\nImprint seems
    like a possibility to me; it's too bold, and too contemporary, to be Caslon Old
    Face, and Imprint does retain the strongly sloped V of the Caslon italic.\r\n\r\nA
    larger view of some of the reprint on Google Books can be found on Amazon, at\r\n\r\n[[http://www.amazon.com/Scripta-Mathematica-Jekuthiel-Ginsburg/dp/0766138356]]\r\n\r\njust
    \"click to look inside\".\r\n\r\nAlso, of course, since this was published in
    the United States, and it contained mathematical notation, it is likely that the
    Lanston Monotype was used. Historical accounts of the press at Yeshiva University
    may be available."

  body: "Thank you <strong>quadibloc</strong>! Imprint looks like a good option for
    substitution. Though it shares the same lack of a single-story lowercase italic
    \u2018g\u2019 which seems to be a distinctive feature of the original italic here.\r\n\r\nI
    also tried to go over the old Monotype specimens but still no luck, particular
    for this \u2018g\u2019.\r\n\r\nBTW, I've attached another specimen."

  body: There were a lot of these modernized Caslons, and I can't claim any expertise
    on distinguishing them. However, Linotype [[http://books.google.com/books?id=BmPPAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA194|Old
    Style no. 1]] might be pretty close (it seems to have been made with both styles
    of lowercase italic "g"). Unfortunately, I don't think it has been digitized except
    for a distressed adaptation called [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/ephemera/coldstyle/|Coldstyle]].

  body: "Thanks a lot <strong>archaica</strong>! Linotype Specimens book proved helpful.
    Linotype Old Style No. 1 is close, but I find Caslon with Italic and Small Caps
    (from this book) to be even closer (please see comparison chart with some distinctive
    characters below).\r\n\r\nI'm aware about another one\u2014Linotype Caslon No.
    2 (and Monotype [[http://www.circuitousroot.com/artifice/letters/press/comptype/monotype/typography/index.html|Caslon
    No. 37]] of which [[http://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/history.html|Linotype's No.
    2 is a copy]]), but couldn't find full specimen. Both were furnished with alternate
    descenders.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://typophile.com/files/Diffs.png\" alt=\"Caslons
    comparison chart\">\r\n\r\nAnyway, as they have not been digitized (as far as
    I know) I'll probably have to stick with some of the proposed or Lanston's Caslon
    337."
