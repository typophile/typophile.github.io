  next semester&#41;, I&#39;m sure there&#39;s room for improvement. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s
  a &#34;flyer&#34; I made for posting around the Art Center campus to promote my
  class. The &#34;g&#34; is from Patria Bold, the text is in Rockwell Extra Bold,
  and it&#39;s been mounted on a foam core base. I&#39;ve made seven so far &#40;it
  takes about an hour to make each one... not counting the time it took to make that
  &#34;g&#34;&#41; and I might make two more, but that&#39;s it. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/68754.gif"

  body: Hey Hrant, <BR> <BR>Is this an example of getting carried away by glyph-love?
    ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>Those are pretty cool. They look neat especially hanging from
    one another. Yeah I&#39;d say they&#39;re worth an hour each. <BR> <BR>To my eye
    the &#34;Art Center at Night &#149; Summer 2005&#34; spreads away from the counter
    too much at its endpoints. The &#34;Lea...&#34; portion of &#34;Learn...&#34;
    looks maybe a little too tightly curled and the &#34;...own fonts&#34; not tightly
    enough. <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t really tell what&#39;s going on with the &#34;m&#34;
    in &#34;pm&#34;. In the drawing it looks sadly scrunched but on the wood background
    photo it looks fine while in the hangings I&#39;m not too sure. Maybe a redraw
    of the m? Maybe just move the &#34;Wednesday&#34; to the left more so the &#34;m&#34;
    doesn&#39;t have to turn down? <BR> <BR><i>...and I might make two more, but that&#39;s
    it.</i> suggests maybe no more time is warranted. <BR> <BR>Whatever. They&#39;re
    neat. <BR> <BR>Jon

    now...  :-/  I just finished the eighth one, and I might just stop now. But the
    crits will be useful if/when I do another batch... and next time I&#39;ll cough
    up the dough for something more suitable for the job than my trusty ol&#39; Swiss
    army knife... <BR> <BR>The type-on-path stuff is a bit jumpy, I admit. It was
    done with Illustrator 7, and by an amateur no less... But I did actually adjust
    the &#34;pm&#34; manually since making that first &#34;flat&#34; image - so it&#39;s
    better on the actual prints. <BR> <BR>One thing I&#39;m wondering about is: <BR>What
    font would work [even] better than Rockwell Extra Bold? <BR> <BR>&#62; I&#39;ve
    been meaning to ask, When do your classes start? <BR> <BR>And I&#39;ve been meaning
    to spam you about it :-&#41; since you&#39;re in LA... Registration starts April
    11 &#40;enrollment is limited to 12 students&#41;, and the first class is on May
    18. What&#39;s nice is they&#39;re giving us two rooms: a spacious one equipped
    for drafting, and a computer lab too. &#40;BTW, I&#39;ll be updating my News entry
    soon.&#41; <BR> <BR>hhp'

    you might want to add a thick stroke to your g for bleed and make a separate layer
    with a cutter guide in white &#40;or some visible colour&#41; as a hairline stroke
    and then use a marker to colour in the sides of the polyboard. <BR>I think you
    have condensed or expanded the Rockwell unevenly, but I don&#39;t think you have
    to replace Rockwell. <BR>Tim

    <BR>Yes, especially on the second line; when I scaled the paths to fit the glyph

    all that curving and knocked-out type, I&#39;d recommend a more open face. One
    of the neo-grotesque, post-modern sans types. But I&#39;m not a big Rockwell fan,
    so maybe that&#39;s why I think that. Also, with a knockout like that I&#39;d
    go to a lighter weight, probably the bold. <BR> <BR>Did you try a version with
    all horizontal type? I think the size trade-off would be compensated for by the
    increased ease-of-reading.'

    doesn&#39;t suck&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#62; I&#39;d recommend a more open face. <BR>
    <BR>I agree, but it still needs something quite dark, so people see that there&#39;s
    type, from a distance. One problem is that I don&#39;t have that many fonts...
    Hmmm, maybe I should use Legato? But I don&#39;t have the dark weight. <BR> <BR>&#62;

  body: I actually didn&#39;t try out too many fonts. I recently had a system meltdown
    &#40;thanks to a virus; but no data was lost, luckily&#41; and I haven&#39;t reinstalled
    too many fonts yet. I&#39;m trying to maintain a lean system &#40;although I know
    that&#39;s always a losing battle&#41;. But don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m no Vignelli
    all of a sudden - the gods forbid. <BR> <BR>That said, I&#39;m certainly open
    to specific suggestions. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: '&#34;<i>Where is there room for that? </i>&#34; <BR> <BR>Kinda like this
    &#40;I used Absara, in spite of my earlier recommendations, to preserve the serif
    on serif thing&#41;. This is just a quick sketch. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/68868.gif"
    alt="G-sign horizontal"> <BR> <BR>But now that I look at it, it&#39;s more than
    just a info-hierarchy/legibility trade-off. Yours places the emphasis on the shape
    of the glyph, which is probably more appropriate and visually interesting, considering
    the purpose. This is why I used curved type lines on the top and bottom &#40;and
    the E/402 is just plain better in your version&#41;. <BR> <BR>Anyway, that&#39;s
    what had in my head when I wrote that.'

    like that idea, but in your rough attempt there&#39;s no more room left for the

    wanted on there, like the instructor&#39;s name. :-&#41; BTW, one idea I had was
    to use <i>both</i> sides of the &#34;g&#34;, but then the display requirements
    would have been huge: I&#39;d need to hang these things, and add &#34;see other
    side&#34; type stuff too... or hang them in a gentle breeze! Hmmm, the campus
    <i>is</i> located on the site of a former windtunnel...  ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>Now
    I&#39;m getting this vision of a &#34;g&#34; the size of a large SUV&#42; hanging
    from the ceiling, with a large fan going... And I could like sit on the tail part

    text.  <BR> <BR>This is might be touchy but - what if you extend the tail &#40;
    the part at the top..&#41; of the g into a circle shaped terminal &#40; or some
    other shape&#41; &amp; put the details in that? The bottom of the g might have
    to be extended too to make it hang straight...

  body: Hrant, I think your first idea was a very good one.  With some adjustments
    with the date &#40;reduce the size to avoid to break the smooth line at the end&#41;
    and the register line &#40;be more in the same curv as the bottom tail of the
    g&#41;. I  will keep the good suggestion from Eben how he used the text in the
    top tail. I&#39;d also suggest to use a sans typeface instead of a serif one for
    the text inside the g. <BR> <BR>Good work.
