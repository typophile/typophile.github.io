body: Amateur here. I am seeking to download a font with Wood Ornament characters
  that I can use in MS Word documents that I create on my Mac. Word doesn't seem to
  recognize the characters that I derive from fonts I have downloaded from the web
  for free.

  body: They should show up as pictures rather than names in the scroll down type
    menu - if not showing up try restarting word.

  body: Are you familiar with the various ways in which characters can be selected
    in MS Word? Including "Insert Symbol", typing in a unicode value, copying from
    an external glyph chart (in Windows it's "Character Map" - I assume there's something
    similar in MacOS).
