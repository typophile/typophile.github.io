body: Does anyone know of a way to import only sidebearings from a metrics file into
  FontLab? Has anyone written a Python script to do this sort of thing? Or am I just
  missing this in the core FontLab application? <BR> <BR>Any help appreciated. Thanks!

    can <BR>always use the paste special command. I use it all the  <BR>time to swap
    sidebearings between files.

  body: Can you post an example of your Quark kerning table data, so I can analyse
    it? Generally, it is pretty easy to manipulate simple data like kerning pairs
    in a text editor to make an AFM that is importable to FontLab.

  body: I would handle the character to glyph name conversion with a simple macro,
    then replace spaces with tabs and paste the data into a spreadsheet, and convert
    the kerning values column with a multiplication function. Then paste the results
    back to the text editor and into an AFM file. <BR> <BR>In FontLab, it should be
    possible to use a Python script to batch generate AFM files for all fonts.
