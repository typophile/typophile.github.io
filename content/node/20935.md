  but I can't think where. Could be classed with Bauhaus or Techno, but I can't seem
  to find it.\r\n\r\nAnyone recognize it?  Thanks\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I found a freebie called <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/teacher.font?nb_ppp=50&text=g%3Afish+surfboards\">Teacher</a>
    that is similar, but not a match. Judging from the other font in the set, this
    one's from Japan.\r\n\r\nStill no ideas?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "It looks like a customized version of a free font that came with my Dell
    Inspiron 6000 notebook: A font\u2022a\u2022licious font called \"Alba.\"\r\n\r\nThe
    stock version of Alba is not an exact match, judging by the lowercase \"g\" glyph
    (the one in the stock font has a more elaborate descender). However, it is very
    easy to alter the glyphs in such a typeface using mainstream drawing tools like
    Illustrator or CorelDRAW. The \"f\" is an exact match.\r\n\r\nI will go so far
    as to say \"Alba\" or whatever face Alba may copy is indeed the source for that
    type."

  body: "Yes, I saw <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/alba.font\">Alba</a> when I was
    searching DaFont.com I went past it because I saw the differences first, but you
    are right that there are some similarities too. The 's' is the biggest disconnect,
    and the 'a', but these are the closest fonts I have seen so far. I could swear
    I thought I saw the font on MyFonts once, but I cannot figure what keyword they
    linked it to.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Both Adobe Illustrator and Macromedia Freehand are excellent at creating perfectly
    rounded ends on open paths with "expanded" rounded end cap strokes. I can't help
    but think Alba was the starting point on the letter sample and that the designer
    simply took a few extra steps in tweaking together the final result.
