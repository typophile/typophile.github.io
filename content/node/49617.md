  body: "On his blog He mentions that he chose Chalet Comprime for the obama poster.\r\n\r\n\"Finally
    I moved on to the type treatment. For the sake of continuity with the campaign\u2019s
    own materials and Shepard\u2019s earlier posters, I chose a typeface that somewhat
    resembled what they had been using. I ended up going with House Industry\u2019s
    Chalet Comprime which is a compressed variant of their Chalet font. I converted
    the type to a shape layer to work out the kerning and sizing and created a mask
    based on the shape.\""

  body: "With some squooshing, an added stroke, and I really think they manipulated
    the flair on the foot of the R ... I think the splines on the S had to be manipulated
    too. Oh and the notch under the beard of the G. But this was started with Chalet
    Comprime Cologne Sixty.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/squo2-comp_5093.png]"

  body: You know. They might claim Chalet, but the R and S, and the E even, are much
    closer in Knockout.

  body: It may be purely anecdotal, but Tobias Frere-Jone and Shep Fairy were both
    at RISD at the same time. Or maybe you all knew that, and I am stating the obvious.
    Not that this is necessarily cause for a real connection professionally.
