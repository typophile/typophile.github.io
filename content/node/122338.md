  and I\u2019d like to copy glyph outlines and sidebearings from one font to another.
  There is too much work to copy them one by one. Is there a simple way to do this
  automatically, maybe with a Python script?"

  body: If the characters lots in your new font are empty, you can also Merge (under
    Tools) the two fonts.

  body: Thanks. There are over 8000 glyphs to copy, so that's why I try to avoid the
    manual way. Both fonts have outlines.

  body: "Yes, the names in both fonts are identical.\r\n\r\nI'm now trying the Paste
    Special -command, pasting the outlines, SBs and adv. width. The \"map glyphs by
    name\" option is on. This way I lose the kerning pairs, but I guess I could copy
    the old kerning back into the font. Not sure how reliable this process is though.
    Hopefully I'm not losing anything else on the way."
