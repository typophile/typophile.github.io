  body: "The screenshot came from iPhone\u2019s \u201CTop Stories\u201D Times page.
    Interestingly, going to Times.com or the Times mobile site does not have this
    face. \r\n\r\nHmmmm. \r\n\r\nThe font identification thickens."

    are different. \r\nThis typeface is also used in the print version of the magazine."
