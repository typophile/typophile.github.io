body: "I\u2019m working on a book that is made up of articles written by different
  authors. Some use British English, and some use American English. I\u2019m following
  Chicago Manual of Style (with some exceptions: en dashes, and disregarding the period/comma-quotation
  convention). I wonder if it would be advisable to keep the British English spelling,
  but format it according to CMS, or to format the BE articles differently.\r\n\r\nI
  also have the option to translate BE articles. I think that may be the best solution,
  but I\u2019m running into issue with some names. For example, one of the subjects
  discussed is something called the Green Education Programme. Would it be ok to change
  \u201CProgramme\u201D to \u201CProgram\u201D in this case? And what about quotes
  using the word \u201Cprogramme\u201D?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The BE texts also use Oxford spelling, so words like \u201Corganise\u201D
    are spelled with a \u201Cz\u201D. All in all, there\u2019s only a few words left
    that deviate, which leads me to consider the translation path."

  body: "To come a decision, the answers to some questions might help:\r\n\r\n1) What
    is the reason for changing the BE texts rather than the AE texts? Is the majority
    of the texts written in AE, is it a North American publisher, is the book aimed
    at the North American market?\r\n\r\n2) Is this only about spelling? As you probably
    know, BE and AE differ on a number of aspects other than spelling. A text that
    uses AE spelling, but is riddled with BE expressions (or the other way around)
    is likely to confuse readers. How British or American do your texts \u2018sound\u2019,
    spelling aside? If their tone distinctly places them on one side of the Atlantic,
    only changing the spelling might be less advisable and really translating them
    feels overly intrusive to me.\r\n\r\n3) Could you get in touch with the authors
    of the texts? I would be displeased if anybody made any changes to a text of mine
    without notifying me prior to publication. Spelling is not a big deal and I would
    probably agree to minor changes, but I would want to be consulted. If you cannot
    reach the authors, I would base my decision on how important the linguistic form
    is for the texts in question. Before smoothing out the differences, you should
    be fairly certain that the authors did not feel strongly about using one particular
    variety of English.\r\n\r\n4) How important is consistent language use anyway?
    If you read a text for content, you\u2019re likely not to even notice (or at least
    not be distracted by) minor spelling differences. Also, juxtaposing texts in slightly
    different varieties of one language is common in publications of all kinds. Consistent
    typographic formatting does feel important to me, consistent spelling: less so.
    Even authors writing in the same variety usually sound different and readers can
    easily deal with that.\r\n\r\nWhat would I do? Ask the authors. If that\u2019s
    impossible, I would leave the spelling unchanged, but format all texts according
    to CMOS."

  body: R. makes a good point in that British authors would be expected to write in
    BE and American authors in AE. Why fix something that is not broken, that said
    what  the client (the publisher) wants can always trump what the designer/typographer
    thinks.

  body: "1) The majority of the texts are AE. It is a Norwegian publication, aimed
    at the international market.\r\n\r\n2) One of the articles is written by a Pakistani
    man (using some typical BE expressions). The rest are written by Norwegian academics.\r\n\r\n3)
    Yes, I can get in touch with them.\r\n\r\n4) I\u2019m not sure. That is my reason
    for asking. Most of the texts come across as fairly international, with only a
    few words (repeated a large number of times) in BE."

  body: "I think much would depend on the nature of the publication.\r\n\r\nFor example,
    in a literary publication where the writers words are sacrosanct or where a sense
    of place is important to maintain, the spelling, idioms and regional idiosyncrasies
    would be important to keep.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if the publication is, say,
    a collection of technical articles where clarity, brevity and uniformity are important,
    more editing for stylistic consistency would be warranted.\r\n\r\nAnother thing
    to consider would be whether or not it's a one-off publication or a periodical.
    In the case of the latter, matching the style of other editions of the periodical
    might be important, whereas  that wouldn't be a concern in a stand-alone publication.\r\n\r\nThe
    target audience also needs to be considered. Will they be primarily British, American
    or an international crowd more inclined to prefer one over the other?\r\n\r\nIn
    any of these cases, I'd be consistent with punctuation. Swapping the position
    of the quote marks and periods depending on whether or not the writer is British,
    American, Norwegian, Kwakiutl, or whatever would simply look like a mistake, whereas
    maintaining the spelling of, say, color vs. colour would add to the regional flavor
    of the article."

  body: Hmm - very reasonable points were made in the comments so far, but in the
    absence of any new input from the publishers/authors I would agree with bojev,
    and just keep the text as it was in BE and AE. Particularly if you are acting
    purely as a designor rather than an editor.  Perhaps a note at the beginning of
    the book can explain the inconsistencies of spelling etc. in case any reader raises
    any questions? Good luck.

  body: "You've noted several alternatives.\r\n\r\nThe articles written in British
    English might be:\r\n\r\n1) Not modified at all;\r\n2) Changed only in formatting
    to correspond to the Chicago Manual of Style;\r\n3) Changed in spelling to be
    in American English spelling.\r\n4) Translated completely into American English.\r\n\r\nAlternative
    (3) is not a good alternative, simply because if you don't do (4), a reader, seeing
    American English spelling, will expect American English idioms, and thus possibly
    fail to recognize British idioms found in the text.\r\n\r\nAlternative (2) may
    be acceptable; if it's a question of things like not including a space between
    a word and a colon following it (done in some British books) then avoiding such
    variations in formatting avoids a distraction, and won't confuse readers. (In
    fact, keeping variations in formatting risks confusing your <em>typesetter</em>.
    Of course, since these days your typesetter is likely to be, at worst, a secretary
    in your office, and not a Linotype operator at some remote location, this is less
    of a concern than it once was.)\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm not absolutely sure what you
    mean by \"formatting\".\r\n\r\nAlternative (4) probably should be out of the question.
    However, with one paper being in British English by a non-native English speaker,
    that the paper may require editing to be in correct English is a possibility I
    can't dismiss out-of-hand. And if you don't have a native speaker of fluent British
    English handy in Norway, translation to American English might be an incidental
    result of that process.\r\n\r\nAs you can guess, I'm somewhat inclined to alternative
    (1). If the alterations involved in alternative (2) are all trivial, it is the
    best option, <em>not</em> alternative (1), but I can't be certain of that."

  body: "I was wondering if the CMOS didn\u2019t have anything to say about this issue,
    so I looked it up in the most recent version. Here\u2019s what it says (7.3):\r\n\r\n<blockquote><strong>Non-US
    spelling.</strong> In English-language works by non-US authors that are edited
    and produced in the United States, editors at Chicago generally change spelling
    used in other English-speaking countries to American spelling (e.g., <cite>colour</cite>
    to <cite>color,</cite> <cite>analyse</cite> to <cite>analyze</cite>). Since consistency
    is more easily maintained by this practice, few authors object. In quoted material,
    however, spelling is left unchanged (see 13.7 [about permissible changes to quotations;
    R.]).</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI think that spelling consistency is nice to have, but
    too unimportant to impose it (or it should be made clear from the outset that
    AE is expected and everything else will be changed to AE). In your case, I would
    ask the authors of the BE texts for their permission to change the spelling to
    AE. If there\u2019s only one text that sounds British, I would try to live with
    the mismatch of idiom and spelling. Asking the author to \u2018internationalise\u2019
    his English seems a bit too much to ask for. If you can\u2019t obtain permission
    from all authors, I think you should <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOILZ_D3aRg\">call
    the whole thing off</a>, typeset everything according to CMOS and know that you\u2019ve
    done your best."

    issue. We consulted professionals and considered your advice. In the end, we decided
    to keep all proper nouns and quotes as they were written in the original sources,
    but changed BE to AE spelling for all other instances (again, with the help of
    a professional), with everything formatted according to CMoS.\r\n\r\nWe would
    probably consider a different approach, if not for the fact that a few terms occured
    <strong>a lot</strong> of times in the text. \u201CProgramme\u201D, for example,
