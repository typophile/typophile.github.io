  They could be old or new, serif or sans serif, it doesn't matter. As long as they
  are digitally available, preferably no display typeface (but rather for text setting)
  and online somewhere so I can make a tryout.\r\nI've found some Belgian type designers,
  but I would like to get your advice on fonts in particular!\r\n\r\nThanks a lot
  in advance.\r\n\r\nAll the best!"

  body: "It sounds simplistic (and it is, but not terminally so) but Belgium is between
    France and the Netherlands (two typographic powerhouses) and culture travels geographically
    (at least until very recently) so something that blends those big traditions might
    click. So:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/petervanlancker/5241230677\r\nMake
    sure to read the comments!\r\n\r\nAnother angle is to take the French style and
    make the x-height much bigger.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "hrant, it's true and a nice angle that you are opting. i guess i've been
    spoiled coming from the netherlands myself, and expected belgium to have a similar
    offer in type designers and fonts, easy to browse through and  do research for.\r\nthanks
    for that flickr link too!\r\ni find it interesting how typography in belgium behaves,
    being positioned between those 'two powerhouses' as you mentioned. \r\n\r\ni can't
    really be specific about what i'm looking for, as i just wanted to do some research
    and stumble on things, rather than finding what i was looking for.\r\n\r\nso any
    more reactions about belgian fonts/typography, both specific and more general
    country/culture related, are very welcome!\r\n\r\nyvd"

  body: "Just to be clear, Belgium has its own typographic tradition too, and it's
    certainly not exactly in between the French and Dutch ones! But one aspect of
    typography is *perceptions*, and the big movements tend to direct those.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    manifests itself/what it looks like? what are characteristics for example?\r\nit
    would be great if you could help me out... i don't know much about it and any
    help is very welcome!"

    'impression' about 'belgian typography' than I do, and once again, any clue is
    welcome.\r\n\r\nAny Belgian typographers in the house????!!! (ouse - ouse - ouse......)\r\nSounds
    a bit empty no?"
