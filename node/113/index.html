		<div class="commentbody"> thank you all for the insight. i was simply curious about this, as it was hard for me to imagine people coming in contact with typography without being a design student at one time.  i, myself, used to practice my handwriting skills  to the point of abusurdity as a child ... i think that i was always obsessed with the perfection of letterforms. <BR> <BR>i have not yet taken on the task of creating my own typeface, but it is my dream to do so. i appreciate the positive environment that this board/site provides for seasoned and novice typophiles, and look forward to presenting my work here for you as well. </div>
