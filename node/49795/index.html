They aren’t predictable, i.e. foreseeable, but once they’re happening you absolutely can look back at other communities and see that the same thing happened to them.</p>

<p>Just kidding of course!</p>
<p>No, but seriously, I am glad it&rsquo;s here; and I do expect to make use of it this year despite being at Reading etc. In fact I have some new questions fermenting that I hope will properly tap the collective typophilic brain.</p>
<p>James, for someone like yourself, I imagine Typophile is probably going to be useful only just so often - but it is an &ldquo;opportunity&rdquo; to teach. And you have taught me. And I am still grateful. Having been taught I do have the urge to help new folk in the same way.</p>

<p>I must have run across the thread in one of my more earnest moments&hellip;</p>
<p>The presentation was pretty well liked from what I could tell. Everybody ( me too ) was pretty exhausted by the end.</p>
<p>It was great seeing you too. In many ways my private showing &amp; conversations were at least as enlightening or to me as the ones I had in St in St. Petersburg.</p>
<p>Seeing really successful cyrillic designs was eye opening too. That may have been the best part.</p>

<p>@Patty: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I hope Typophile gets its groove back.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I hope so too. I didn&rsquo;t post my &ldquo;Top 10 reasons why you should like Typophile&rdquo; thread for nothing, and I don&rsquo;t think I was wasting my breath there either. I mentioned the neccessity of having to roll with the punches and stick with it for the long haul.</p>
<p>As the community&rsquo;s semantic auditor and civility consultant, I do what I can to keep the place civil and pleasant to be a part of. When I can make it count, I do. But you knew that. At the same time I try to stimulate debate and discussion without rocking the boat or going against the flow too much.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Miles above your circumstance
There&rsquo;s water on your mind

<p>Interpret &ldquo;all of this will fade&rdquo; in a good way, in the sense that the lull and not-so-hot times won&rsquo;t last forever.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the deal&hellip;I live out in the middle of nowhere, and among a pretty solid Amish community. What does that have to do with anything? I work on a computer all day, and I use the internet and I check out what&rsquo;s going on on Typophile a few times every day. To me, it seems like a lot of the problems we face as a culture have a lot to do with people thinking way too much of their importance on this earth, and sometimes that includes me, and it certainly extends into all of our modern day obsessions about this and that, include type design. I stand by what I said. We don&rsquo;t need Typophile. I think accepting that will help Typophile evolve in a positive way, and that&rsquo;s why I said it. It&rsquo;s a public forum and I was trying to helpful. I didn&rsquo;t say it to give you grief.</p>

<p>Just sayin', okay? Your response is not helpful and does nothing to move the discussion forward. And you assumed bad faith on my part. If somebody says something you don&rsquo;t dig, leave it. Just walk away.</p>
<p>Koppa—it&rsquo;s totally not a problem. Whatever your response happens to be, there&rsquo;s no harm done. I take it all in good faith unless presented with overwhelming evidence to the contrary.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->To me, it seems like a lot of the problems we face as a culture have a lot to do with people thinking way too much of their importance on this earth, and sometimes that includes me, and it certainly extends into all of our modern day obsessions about this and that, include type design.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Most of typophile&rsquo;s problems are due to the assumption of bad faith, the predominance of black &amp; white thinking and  conception of type design and application, the inability of most of users to recognize and distinguish ad hominem personal attacks when they occurr, and the suppression of freedom of speech by its proprietors and moderators.</p>
<p>No really guys, I&rsquo;m not kidding about that one. Uli was right recently when he pointed out Zara Evens' supression of the name of the crooked font maker who ripped off Ralf Herman&rsquo;s logo-making font.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I stand by what I said. We don’t need Typophile.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe your view on this is representative of the majority here. And your semantic reasoning does not add up. Answer this: If, as you said earlier, we like and want typophile, how can we not need it?</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think accepting that will help Typophile evolve in a positive way, and that’s why I said it. It’s a public forum and I was trying to helpful. I didn’t say it to give you grief.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I never assumed you did. You assumed I had assumed bad faith on your part, when I didn&rsquo;t. Mistake #1. Now, please explain how accepting the notion that we don&rsquo;t need typophile will help it evolve in a positive way. How is that supposed to facilitate typophile moving forward?</p>

<p>Do you get it yet? You&rsquo;d be much better off making as few assumptions as possible and just giving straight answers. At worst I assumed you didn&rsquo;t get the joke aspect of the threads Ray and I posted. You then turned that into a grief reaction from me by way of assumption.</p>
<p>God this conversation is boring. I stress being bored, not being angry.</p>
<p>Maybe if you <em>you</em> don&rsquo;t need typophile, you could just go away and stop boring the pants off everybody. That&rsquo;s an ad hominem attack but not one based on assumption of bad faith. It&rsquo;s practical advice. If you sincerely believe <em>we</em> don&rsquo;t need typophile, then maybe it&rsquo;s you who feels he doesn&rsquo;t need it and should walk away.</p>
<p>Do you get it yet? Learn to follow your own flawed irrational arguments instead of asking intelligent people to swallow them, because they don&rsquo;t make sense to us.</p>

<p>James, taking this issue out of context and using it in your argument is a little unfair and I want to make something clear. There are circumstances around the choices we make as moderators (and Typophile as an organization) that the community as a whole is not always made aware of, and it is our right to withhold that information because it may concern the privacy of our users. We are trying to be as fair as possible to all parties, all members of our community, regardless of what a small handful of people with loud voices may be saying about their business practice, religious beliefs or favorite cheeses.</p>
<p>I try not to let my personal opinions about these matters interfere with decisions that need to be made on behalf of Typophile the community, and Typophile the organization. If we started moderating based on our own biases and on how we feel about people in these forums, I&rsquo;d have deleted your account and a few others*, long ago. But that isn&rsquo;t how we do things around here, oh wise civility consultant.</p>
<p>*My comments do not represent the general views of Typophile</p>
