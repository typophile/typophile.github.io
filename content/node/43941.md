  section.\r\n\r\nVia Design Observer, I just came across Al Gore's <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2008/04/06/weekinreview/06heller.html\">new
  logo</a>.\r\n\r\nThis design really bothers me. To me, the \"flip the m in me around
  to change it into a w\" gimmick is not funny. What it seems he wants is for us to
  about all of us instead of ourselves as individuals. This is very noble and would
  might make a change. But when I look at the logo, I see that word in the center
  looking like a \"me\" instead of \"we\" and I suddenly think that the whole purpose
  of this movement might be more about <em>Al-Gore-the-person-and-what-he's-doing-to-save-the-environment-and-how-it-is-all-great</em>
  rather than a call for all of us to work together to save the environment, which
  is what should really happen. Right?"

  body: I don't know. I like it. It feels like turn that frown upside down. Maybe
    it's too juvenile or maybe we need a kindergarten type reminder that we are all
    in this together and it's time to share. Just a thought.

    as individuals. \r\n\r\nThe article explains that the concept is that we each
    have to take individual initiative--\"me\"--but for the common good--\"we\". Sounds
    good to me. And the logo achieves simplicity and balance, which is the main and
    most difficult thing. Kudos to Chester. "

  body: I second what Desi and William are saying... and Mr. Gore's name does not
    even appear in the logo, so it's hard for me to think that it is trying to draw
    attention to him.

  body: "Oh, I just thinking of that yesterday or the day before. Just flip the \"m\"
    - so simple. Is weird, as the \"m\" is inverted and the 'foot' of it is upside
    down it make it looks like sinking in relation to the \"e\".\r\n\r\nIt means ME
    and WE."

    the YouTube video featured with the article \"Al Gore's Logo Looks Very Familiar\"
    in Advertising Age Online.\r\n\r\nBut, I still like the graphic and visual language
    around the branding and development of the logo.\r\n\r\nYouTube Video featured

    (Concept wise). That seems like a simple job for a type designer. '
