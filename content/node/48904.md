  with the Harry Potter 6 release date</a>\r\n\r\nHarry Potter 6; the Half-blood prince
  is much anticipated by all the Harry Potter fans around the world. Everybody were
  expecting it to be on their movie screen by November 21st, but suddenly Warner Brothers
  had announced that they will push the date to July 17th of 2009 and not on November
  21st of 2008! This angered lots of the Harry Potter fans who just can\u2019t get
  enough of Harry Potter.\r\n\r\nBecause of these fans\u2019 outrage, one person started
  an <a href=\"http://www.petitionspot.com/online-petition/\">online petition</a>
  asking fellow Harry Potter fans to sign it if they are disappointed with the decision
  to move the release date of the movie. In just a week after the petition had been
  created, it gathered over 40,000 signatures already! Just imagine, that\u2019s over
  5,000 signatures in a day! The Harry Potter fever is just getting hotter and hotter.
  Now, fans are not excited but they are outraged by the decision of Warner Brothers.
  With this much signatures under one petition, just imagine how many online <a href=\"http://www.petitionspot.com/\">petitions</a>
  about this had been created after the news broke out about the postponement of the
  movie\u2019s release. With all these petitions getting the same bombardment of signatories,
  for sure Warner Brothers would be worried. Why not? They keep on making Harry Potter
  movies because of its fans that just can\u2019t stop watching it. What would happen
  to them if their fans would decide to boycott? They\u2019d lose lots of money and
  that\u2019s not good for business. What are their reasons for postponing the movie?\r\n\r\nAfter
  watching Harry Potter 5, many Harry Potter fans already started their long wait
  for the next Harry Potter sequel. For them it may have already seemed forever and
  with just 3 more months left and they could already watch their anticipated movie,
  suddenly they realize they don\u2019t need to wait 3 more months but another 11
  months! Now, wouldn\u2019t that make your blood boil? So just imagine the outrage.
  Thankfully, online petitions are there to make these fanatics have a chance to share
  their opinions in the hopes that those people in Warner Brothers may change their
  minds. It\u2019s a disaster! For these Harry Potter fans, this news seems like they\u2019ve
  been hit by a killer tornado.\r\n\r\nWarner Brothers said they moved the date to
  ensure they\u2019d get the most audience as possible but they never thought that
  with their move, they made their Harry Potter fans angry. Is this the best way to
  market their movie? They should have kept their movie fans happy and excited about
  the movie and not angry and want to boycott. They may just end up realizing that
  they made the wrong move. Let\u2019s face it. It doesn\u2019t matter what time of
  the year they would release the Harry Potter movie, it would still get the same
  number of audience. Harry Potter fans would continue to watch the movie with so
  much excitement even when it\u2019s released on the coldest day of the year!\r\n\r\nSo,
  if you are a Harry Potter\u2019s fan and you are also outraged with the decision
  by Warner Brothers, you may want to check out the online petition about it and sign
  there too! Perhaps <a href=\"http://www.petitionspot.com/start-a-petition/\">start
  a petition</a> of your own?"

    book to movie translations. And no one that is outraged enough to create a petition
    for the release date is going to boycott this movie. They're just mad and have
    no power over what's happening, so they express their anger the only way they
    can. Warner Bros has no need to worry about losing any sort of fan base.\r\n\r\npenn"
