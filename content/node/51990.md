  Daphne]]\r\n\r\nI'd love to get any response/comments, images of it in use, etc.\r\n\r\nI'm
  working on an italic right now (doing the roman only far exceeded the requirements
  of the project and my time limits)\r\nEventually, I'm hoping to release a couple
  more weights: bold and light. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/daphne_6076.jpg]"

  body: Nice work, Arlo. The care and hours that went into this are evident. Glad
    you included the alt characters -- they'll certainly make the font more usable.
    I'm particularly fond of the alt k. Keep us posted on the progress of the italic
    and other weights.

    solutions, although some lowercase may be distracting in a full-lenghth text.\r\n\r\nBe
    careful: the UC-LC and UC-UC ligatures remain at capital-height when you activate
    \"Caps to Small Caps\", because you placed the [dlig] feature before the [c2sc].
    You should either revise the features' order or design small caps ligatures. The
    problems seems solvable by just swapping these two features' order.\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    [smcp] needs also to be above [dlig] to avoid this problem."

    it has distracting elements. The irregularity need to have consistence, that''s
    what I mean.'

    realize Daphne is bursting with personality. Any further details on where you're
    getting caught up with the lowercase? I've been staring at it far too long."

  body: Hi Arlo. I think the most distracting element comes from the ascenders of
    letters like [b] [h] and [k] leaning forward. The rest may just be my own taste,
    taste gets too much in the way and prevents appropriate judging.
