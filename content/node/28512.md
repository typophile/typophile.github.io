  body: Hey Paul. I think there was something on this at counterspace, but the page
    has either moved or disappeared. The link to it from www.typebase.com no longer
    seems to work, but there are other gems within their education section. There
    is also a topic page for kerning at Ellen Lupton's www.thinkingwithtype.com. Not
    interactive, but informative. The essential thing is that negative space between
    characters should appear optically even, rather than mathematically equal.
