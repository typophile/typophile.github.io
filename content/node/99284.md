body: "At the introduction of a book are a few select quotes relevant to its themes.
  These were originally set in italic with quotation marks. The effect of the double
  indicators (italic and quotation marks) to set the section apart from the rest of
  the text is perhaps a bit redundant; italics or quotations alone would have been
  adequate, not both. The effect of the italics here, however, seems intended to render
  the section with something of a handwritten script feel. Some of the quotes which
  are paraphrased, contain ellipsis in the original English edition.  In the German
  edition we're now working with, German orthography requires brackets for ellipses
  used for paraphrasing. (I believe English does as well, and our source text was
  simply not following the conventional rule).  The issue becomes, that the hard,
  angular brackets of Baskerville (MT) are an abrupt contrast to the intended use
  of italics in this case to evoke kind of a handwritten feel. \r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps
  it's a minor \"type crime\" to try to use italics in this sense, but I would like
  to stay with them as they were in the original, and simply address the hard brackets
  in other way. I'm not clear whether it might be acceptable to drop them in this
  case (the original English did not include them, though it's quite clearly a paraphrasing
  use of ellipsis)  which might be a greater grammatical/orthographic error in German,
  or to perhaps substitute rounded parenthesis (again not orthographically correct)
  or to find another Baskerville or other typeface with less harsh brackets to blend
  in with the rounded flowing italics. The Baskerville MT italic brackets are extremely
  thin, and contain perfect hard edges. They look appropriate for mathematical notation,
  but much less so for a quote from Goethe's work.\r\n\r\nThoughts or suggestions?
  Many thanks in advance - Luca[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typofile brackets

    this is not conventional in English. Also, if you're using the brackets, it would
    be more traditionally correct to use roman brackets even in italic text, though
    that might only exacerbate the problem in your eyes. I wouldn't worry about it
    too much. A much larger problem for me is the footnote number after the attribution
    \u2014 that looks a bit ugly, and there's probably a way around placing a number
    there."

    Those would be braces not brackets.\r\n\r\nIf this is work for a publisher then
    the presence of brackets or not is an editorial decision, not a design decision,
    and you should discuss with with your editor. You may be able to influence a decision
    with sound reasoning, but you\u2019ll have to meet the editor on his/her turf.
    There is meaning to be conveyed, and ultimately this is the editor\u2019s bailiwick.\r\n"

  body: "<em>traditionally correct to use roman brackets</em>\r\n\r\nI would phrase
    this differently, and say simply that traditionally there is no such thing as
    italic parentheses, brackets or braces. These punctuation signs were always upright,
    and I doubt if one encounters slanted versions of them prior to the typewriter.\r\n\r\nWhen
    I was making the new types for the academic publisher Brill, I asked them specifically
    what their editorial style for these signs is in italic text. As a result, the
    Brill italic fonts contain upright ( ) [ ] { } appropriately spaced and kerned
    to the italic letters.\r\n\r\nThere are instances -- particularly in the context
    of display typography -- in which I can see a graphical use for slanted parentheses
    etc., just as in such situations slanted arithmetic symbols can be useful. But
    the norms of these signs should be upright, regardless of the style of the alphabetics."

    result in design decisions that we should no longer take. At Monotype for example
    there was the duplexing of Italic widths.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    parentheses or brackets, then it makes sense to put them in the same style as
    the text, i.e. slanted, and avoid pulling the reader out of the text. However,
    in the citation of Borges above, the  brackets are indication that something is
    missing from the text. Doesn't the reader need to be pulled out it to realize
    that?"

    \r\nI think you mean Linotype?\r\n\r\nIn the age of multiple typefaces from foundries/printers,
    parentheses etc. were generic sorts, right? So in that era upright parentheses
    etc. matched (or didn't match!) every italic in the same way, whereas leaning
    parentheses etc. would only coincidentally match the slope of a given italic since
    it would presumably vary from other italic typefaces. The almost-but-not-quite
    slope differentials might have been judged more distracting than pairing upright
    ones with the leaning letters."

  body: "<blockquote>Doesn't the reader need to be pulled out it to realize that?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThat's
    a good question/point. I guess we'd have to nail down what \"pull out\" means.
    To me it's a pretty dramatic thing - it means the reader stopping the reading
    process, even if only momentarily. This can happen when a shape (or more generally
    a pattern) jumps out because it's unexpected, and I think an upright glyph in
    a stream of slanted glyphs is such a case. What you describe (\"indication that
    something is missing from the text\") I think can be \"read\" without such a disruption
    in the reading process.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I think you mean Linotype?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nSorry,
    I've historically mixed up the limitations of each system... Please correct me
    if I'm wrong: Linotype was limited in terms of kerning (meaning overshooting sorts)
    and duplexing, while Monotype was limited in terms of width unitization?\r\n\r\n<blockquote>leaning
    parentheses etc. would only coincidentally match the slope of a given italic</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThat's
    a good point, and I think you're right.\r\n\r\nHowever, parentheses being entirely
    curvy, might escape the sort of rejection you posit. Square brackets on the other
    hand would indeed pretty jarring if the slopes didn't match. But: more jarring
    than totally upright forms? Dunno. Consider the resultant looseness for one thing*.
    And I still suspect things like parentheses mostly only came in upright anyway.\r\n\r\n*
    John, you mentioned \"spacing problems\"?...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
