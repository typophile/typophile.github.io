  body: It seems the logo and particularly the ampersand are a redraw of the original
    logo, designed in 1931. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.beoworld.co.uk/logo.htm"

    typophile site gonna launch? My hair is going grey waiting for my posts to load!

  body: 'The drawback in linking to FontFonts at MyFonts is that it requires <BR>the
    user to use more clicks to buy because it eventually sends  <BR>them offsite to
    FontFont.com which is pretty antiquated and not  <BR>as usable as FontShop.com.
    So if possible, I&#39;d link to FontShop  <BR>for all FFs. <BR> <BR>Patricia -
    About <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&amp;font_categories_search=font_name_search&amp;searchstr=FF%20Nexus"
    target="_blank">FF Nexus</a> and <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&amp;font_categories=1&amp;font_categories_search=font_name_search&amp;searchstr=ff+seria"
    target="_blank">FF Seria</a>: they are indeed <BR>very similar. Both from the
    same designer, Martin Majoor. <BR><a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&amp;font_categories=1&amp;font_categories_search=font_name_search&amp;searchstr=ff+scala"
    target="_blank">FF Scala</a> is also similar, but with a larger x-height. <BR>The
    key differences lie in the fact that FF Nexus is newer,  <BR>designed from the
    ground up in <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=virtual.content&amp;area=sf_fonts&amp;content=fonts/ff35/index.html"
    target="_blank">three styles</a> &#40;slab, serif, sans&#41;  <BR>and available
    in  OpenType Pro with lots of features.'

    not that fortunate. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>Frankly I don&#39;t know when version 2.0 is
    due. All I&#39;m doing right  <BR>now is trying to break it because once it&#39;s
    launched I&#39;m not allowed  <BR>to do that anymore. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Stephen - I was looking for Nexus but couldn&#39;t remember the name, only
    that it was the same designer as Seria. I actually did go to Fontshop first but
    you don&#39;t list the designer &#40;or I couldn&#39;t find it easily&#41; so
    I ended up at Myfonts. Also, as Yves mentioned in an earlier post, I&#39;d use
    your site a lot more often if you had a good keyword search. <BR> <BR>Yves, think
    of all the money you save on shampoo.
