  are put in this format "NAME: message." Is it some font on every compuer that I
  don''t know about? I have never seen such a fine font on my computer. If it is free,
  where can one download it from?'

  body: Ahh, I never saw it. (I have 800 x 600 screen resolution, and I don't usually
    scroll to the end.) But I see it now. Thanks.

  body: I wonder why it does not come with both lining/tabular numerals and OSF. I
    hope Yves addresses this.
