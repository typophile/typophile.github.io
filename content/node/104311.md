  have to buy.\r\n\r\nWhenever possible, I try to use whatever distributor gives the
  most money to the designer. So, I don't know if I can get closer to filling David
  B\u0159ezina pockets by buying from Rosetta rather than MyFonts, but I'd think so.
  Any way to get more to him?\r\n\r\nTIA\r\n\r\nCharles"

    the company.

    lately, so feel free to get in touch via email david@rosettatype.com, Twitter:
    @rosettatype or facebook.com/rosettatype .\r\n\r\nEven though I like MyFonts people,
    it is always best for the designers if you buy directly from Rosetta. Thanks for
    your consideration. I wish more people gave it a thought.\r\n\r\n@John: Principal,
    I like that! In Czech it refers specificaly to a circus principal which fits nicely."

    far as this thread goes, I'm now in contact with David via email, and we'll be
    buying direct. As the vice principal would say \"mission accomplished.\")\r\n\r\n "
