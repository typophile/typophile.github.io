  on the forum asking the proper way to  measure printed type with a type gauge, but
  the thread seems damaged and is unreadable. (In fact the last couple of posters
  point that out as well.)\r\n\r\nSo I\u2019m sorry to re-ask something that you may
  have answered in the past, but surprisingly I cannot find this information anywhere.
  Please help!\r\n\r\n-Courtney"

    cannot use a type gauge marked with Helvetica in different sizes to measure Times.\r\n\r\nI
    always find it quicker and more reliable to copy one or more words in that font,
    and then measuring its length, rather than the height. Then all you need is a
    regular ruler."

    Gauge, with three slots cut out to show scales for agate through 12 point type
    on one side and 13 and 15 pt on the back. I also have have a \"C-Thru\" leading
    gauge with various other scales printed on it.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how to do the
    ruler method you are mentioning.\r\n\r\nAll I'm trying to do is find what point
    size and leading for Garamond is used in some books I like and don't like, to
    get a better idea of what will work for my design, but I'm not sure if I'm aligning
    the type correctly with the gauge to get the right answers. "

  body: "The first thing to do would be to measure the distance between successive
    baselines on lines of text.\r\n\r\nThat gives the type size plus any leading -
    the upper bound for the type size.\r\n\r\nThen, for an individual line of text,
    measure the distance from the highest ascenders (or the cap height, if that is
    higher - it is more often lower) to the lowest descenders. This is the lower bound
    for the type size.\r\n\r\n(Note that the upper bound can be more easily measured
    by measuring many lines of text at once; once one has that value, one can then
    measure the lower bound by using an enlarged image of the text, with the linespacing
    value allowing one to scale the enlarged image.)\r\n\r\nThe upper bound should
    be an integral number of points, while the lower bound may not be: round it upwards
    to the next nearest point.\r\n\r\nThat may not really be the right answer, but
    without access to the metal bodies of the type used to print the book, it's about
    the best one can obtain. (Of course, one can try hunting up the type specimen
    books of whoever produced the type used - in many cases, the question <em>can</em>
    be settled with accuracy.)"

    of Garamond? (That's important. If not, there is no point in measuring, because
    the internal measurements vary wildly between fonts; and then you might as well
    gauge it by eye.)\r\n\r\nIf so, do the following:\r\n1\xBA Find a very long word
    -- something like \"somnambulance\". That works better than a phrase with spaces,
    because justification might throw off your measurements.\r\n2\xBA Measure how
    <em>long</em> this is. It might be around 21 mm.\r\n3\xBA Using your DTP software,
    draw a horizontal line of 21 mm long.\r\n4\xBA Type the word underneath it and
    adjust the size until it's about the same length.\r\n\r\nThe length will be \"about\"
    the same because there are lots of factors in 'measuring type'. For instance,
    the printed material may have been tracked (positive or negative), or scaled horizontally,
    or the font used may be a different version, or you forgot to allow for some side
    bearing at the start and end of the word. Nevertheless, it's <em>fairly</em> unusual
    to see type in print with a size of, say, 9.3676 pt, and it's reasonable to round
    up or down to the nearest whole or half point."

    to get a general sense of what sizes work.
