  body: Eh ... yeah. They just had the sublicensed Adobe version at myfonts. What
    is it with Linotype? They seem to have withdrawn a lot of their fonts from myfonts.

  body: Yes. Linotype and Monotype fonts are no longer available directly from MyFonts.
    Only those that have been licensed to other publishers such as Adobe.

  body: have you noticed Linotype are adding more fonts and promoting their own site
    more, surprised adverts don't pop up on Linotype FontExplorer X. (sorry in advance
    if I just gave them the idea)
