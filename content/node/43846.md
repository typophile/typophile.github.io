  projects is a large-scale fantasy role playing game. I like Sava Pro for the more
  concise user interface elements (menu entries, item names, etc), but i need some
  suggestions for a similar/complementary typeface that has a lower case alphabet
  for our subtitles and larger bodies of text. Because the title will eventually go
  through localization/translation, typefaces that include eastern euro characters
  would be ideal, but any suggestions would be great.\r\n\r\nSava Pro\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sava_pro_5996.jpg]\r\n\r\nThink
  \"something like Fritz Quadrata\" ..but it can't be FQ since that's used by another,
  extra-popular title;)\r\n\r\nthank you for any help!\r\n"
