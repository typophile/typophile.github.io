    now i've seen it used enough \r\n\r\nit feels like rounded fonts being abused
    and considered \"2.0\"\r\n\r\nthanks for the immediate help!"

    Garde is a 'Geometric sans' (but what do I know \u2014 type classification is
    a fiercely disputed field of science)."

  body: Hehehe, I just had this discussion with Stephen a couple of days ago -- whether
    to call typefaces with rounded stroke endings "rounded" or "soft". :^)

  body: Soft is certainly less ambiguous, so I'll try to use it more often. But Rounded
    isn't so bad, as many soft styles of fonts have "Rounded" in their name. Rounded
    for geometrics, though, really doesn't work. If anything, "round" would be more
    accurate, but still not very good.

  body: Yeah, but isn't "Rounded" almost as vague? Maybe "Sausage" is the answer.
