  with the \"Sw\" spacing, but if you see any other pair out of whack let me know.
  I have 2 versions, the top one has \"Sw\" a bit looser and the bottom has the pair
  tighter. I had almost settled on the top one, but at this point I don't think I
  can make a objective decision on it.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/kerning-check_4445.gif]"

  body: Maybe you can try something in-between the two. Also e_r seems very loose
    (especially because r_v is pretty tight thanks to the custom r)

  body: It seems to me like AdS is spaced tighter than Swerve, which makes it hard
    to judge. Hop this helps. Cheers!

  body: "Thanks guys, I think you're both right. Basically what I did is loosen the
    \"AdS\" and then as opposed to tightening \"er\", I slightly loosened \"rv\".

    than w-e and r-v, and followed by loose v-e, followed by loose S-w.\r\n\r\nHere's
    my take on tightening it all up -\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ad-swerve-2_3553.png]"

  body: You might want to start out adjusting sidebearings next to properly spaced
    n's and o's.

  body: "It\u2019s too loose in general and that\u2019s why you can\u2019t get it
    right.\r\n\r\nFor starters you should use the inner space of the /d/ to define
    the letterspacing. (Why? Because that is the largest defined inner space.). All
    other kerns should confirm to that. You will experience that the combinations
    with /v/ will be problematic. There is some latitude there because the ear of
    the /r/ is compatible with the /v/ shape. I would start with a hairspace there
    and then work backwards.\r\n\r\nTighter works in this case. And when that has
    been resolved, loosening up is a cinch, because it will be just adding the same
    amount of space to every combination (as long as you don not exceed the base amount
    of space, which is equivalent to the inner space of /d/ doubled. Sounds like mumbo
    jumbo, but it works..."

    the long explanation. Not mumbo jumbo at all, in fact one of the better kerning
    explanations I've seen. Very good point on starting tight and loosening evenly
    after it is properly kerned."

  body: "So, i scrapped what I had done and started over using Bert's advise and tight
    spacing to begin. All of the \"w\" and \"v\" pairings are spaced just wider than
    a hairspace. I still feel like the last \"e\" is hanging off a bit. Tighten that
    a touch or leave it alone?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kern3_5367.gif]"
