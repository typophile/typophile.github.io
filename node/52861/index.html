<p>Why do we call them foundries?
Apart from the fact that no molten metal is involved, we&rsquo;re talking here about publishers who don&rsquo;t actually make fonts.
&ldquo;Foundry&rdquo; gives the impression of fabrication, which is misleading.
These &ldquo;foundries&rdquo; too are resellers, licensed to resell fonts by contracts not much different than those between publisher and distributor.
As James notes, many font publishers do production work on the fonts they resell, but this may be compared to the editing of manuscripts done by book publishing companies.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hey, foundry is still a good word. I use it every day, especially in German. It is a good descriptor for companies that are in the type design or font making business. When I talk about someone (or some group) in the graphic design business, I don&rsquo;t call them a company, but a studio (or something else…).</p>
<p>When I speak with the Germans I work with, we use the English word &ldquo;Foundry&rdquo; <em>all the time</em>. Some examples include <em>größe Foundries, kleine Foundries</em> (big foundries, small foundries). Or sentences like, <em>Sie sind keine Foundry mehr</em> (literally, &ldquo;they are not a foundry anymore&rdquo;… but we mean &ldquo;they&rsquo;ve stopped making fonts&rdquo;).</p>
<p>German has its own word for a <em>real</em> type foundry: <em>Schriftgießerei</em>. But I can only think of colleagues using this work in the historical sense.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">In addition to Dan’s thoughts:
One possible explanation why we Germans often cling to the English word ‘foundry’ might be the fact that native terms like ‘Schrift(en)verlag’ [font(s) publisher] or ‘Schrift(en)vertrieb’ [font(s) distributor] are ambiguous. We use ‘Schrift’ for <strong>everything</strong> that has to do with the written word – it can be font, type, typeface, lettering, writing, script, but also scripture or writ.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>There&rsquo;s nothing wrong, in principle, with using a word or phrase which has changed its meaning over time. A huge number of words have origins in outdated technology. A &ldquo;Font,&rdquo; for example, is literally set of metal pieces of type poured from one basin (font or fount) full of molten lead. But I don&rsquo;t hear anyone crying foul over using &lsquo;font&rsquo; for digital type files.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Font Foundry&rdquo; seems to be used these days to label a company that publishes digital fonts and is in some way involved in their production. So pure resellers of fonts like MyFonts are not called &ldquo;Foundries&rdquo;, but sell fonts from foundries. And FontShop is a reseller of fonts, but FontFont is a foundry, etc.</p>
<p>If you have better terminology to distinguish foundries and resellers, James, let us know. Otherwise it seems that &ldquo;foundry&rdquo; still is a useful word.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s because &ldquo;font&rdquo; is derrived from &ldquo;fount&rdquo;, the original meaning &ldquo;source&rdquo;, as in a source or fount of water bubbling up out of the ground. Since digital &ldquo;fonts&rdquo; are much the same thing as metal fonts were in being a source or supply of letter sorts in a given type style, we&rsquo;ve hung onto &ldquo;font&rdquo; for good reason. It makes sense. It fits.</p>
<p>Hanging onto foundry makes a good deal less sense.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t think of a lot of good reasons (none at all, really) for hanging onto &ldquo;foundry&rdquo; at a time when practically none of us are pouring metal into molds to make metal letter sorts. That&rsquo;s common sense. The objection to &ldquo;foundry&rdquo; mainly has to do with the activities of a font maker or type designer (a combined occupation now) having changed fundamentally since metal typefounders adopted and adapted &ldquo;foundry&rdquo; and &ldquo;fount&rdquo; for their purposes.</p>
<p><em>If you have better terminology to distinguish foundries and resellers, James, let us know. Otherwise it seems that “foundry” still is a useful word.</em></p>
<p>Not sure if you&rsquo;re referring to me or James M. I&rsquo;ll have a go at it anyway. Call &ldquo;foundries&rdquo; font makers or type makers. Call &ldquo;resellers&rdquo; vendors. Vendor can be applied to a firm selling fonts it makes itself, or fonts made by other font makers&mdash;as long as they&rsquo;re selling something they can comfortably be called vendors.</p>
<p>Romance has a lot to do with this. Foundry has the same kind of traditional credibility attached to it as calling a seriffed text type a &ldquo;roman&rdquo;, or a blackletter a &ldquo;gothic&rdquo; letter. If we start calling foundries font makers it may not sound sufficiently romantic for the baggage handlers in the business.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@Paragraph: Good! Somebody who wants to move forward. Leading and case terms are outdated , and more significantly <em>outmoded</em> terms, that could have been reformed long ago.</p>
<p>@William: <em>There’s nothing wrong, in principle, with using a word or phrase which has changed its meaning over time.</em></p>
<p>If you say so. If you put it that way, I suppose it makes sense provided the person reading it doesn&rsquo;t question authority and elitist obfuscational technique. Give me a reason <em>why</em> there is nothing wrong in principal with anarchronistic terminology. Your statement reads like an opinion instead of a rational argument.</p>
<p><em>A huge number of words have origins in outdated technology. A “Font,” for example, is literally set of metal pieces of type poured from one basin (font or fount) full of molten lead. But I don’t hear anyone crying foul over using ’font’ for digital type files.</em></p>
<p>This is false logic and an example of the dictatorship of reason in the West. Because not a lot of type folks are crying foul over using &ldquo;font&rdquo;, we must be consistent and not cry foul over using &ldquo;foundry&rdquo;, mustn&rsquo;t we?</p>
<p>We live in a time when double standards thrive as they have done for millenia, yet when it suits us as individuals we insist on consistency and all things being equal, when clearly they are not.</p>
<p>There are abstract nouns and concrete nouns. Verbs tend to be more abstract (in application, not origin) than even the most abstract of nouns. Ship and dial being used to describe noun-objects are examples of abstract verbs. Font is a somewhat abstract noun, as I explained above, being used as a handy, flexible, resiliant synonym for source. Abstract nouns are survivors who travel thru time even as the noun-objects they represent change in substance and techne. So we tend to hang onto them.</p>
<p>Foundry, I submit, is not such an abstract noun as font. It&rsquo;s more concrete and specific to its origins. Font making techne has changed fundamentally, rendering &ldquo;foundry&rdquo; an outmoded concrete noun. Outmoded in the sense that the mode of operation has changed beyond all recognition.</p>
<p>Reform has to start at some point. If we banish &ldquo;foundry&rdquo; and replace it with &ldquo;font maker&rdquo;, would that make &ldquo;font&rdquo; semantically retroactive and anachronistic? Depends who you ask and when. If &ldquo;leading&rdquo; and &ldquo;case (upper and lower)&rdquo; were reformed as well as &ldquo;sans serif&rdquo; (linear, for crying out loud) and &ldquo;foundry&rdquo;, then &ldquo;font&rdquo; may seem the odd one out.</p>
<p><em>. . .metal pieces of type poured from one basin (font or fount) full of molten lead.</em></p>
<p>Basin no, sorry, these vessels weren&rsquo;t called basins, neither were they called a &ldquo;font or fount&rdquo;. Crucible, melting pot, pot or cauldron, but not &ldquo;font&rdquo;</p>

And in some cases they buy fonts developed by others, but also have a development or editorial role. This multiple function today is caught by the word &ldquo;foundry&rdquo;. Using any one of the terms you suggest is more precise, but doesn&rsquo;t exactly capture the multiple functions of these businesses. &ldquo;Foundry&rdquo; is less descriptive but it seems a more useful label at this point.</p>
<p>The problem with &ldquo;publisher,&rdquo; which is the best rival term, is that it doesn&rsquo;t capture what an outfit like yours does. You design the fonts, like a book author, and develop and market them like a book publisher, and retail them like a book store. So I say: more power to you and other foundries :)</p>

<p>David, we were, especially Thomas, who even managed to lump in MyFonts, a distributor.
So I offered an alternative to that dualistic, corporate-centric view.</p>
<p>However many of the functions a particular business engages in, and whether or not it has workers on payroll or contract, there are three main business functions in the type industry: Authoring, Publishing, and Distribution. Isn&rsquo;t that the same for most forms of intellectual property?</p>

<p>I think your problem with the term is historically short sighted: &lsquo;foundry&rsquo; is a recent anachronism and &lsquo;font&rsquo; is an older one. Linotype and Monotype sold matrices, not fonts, but they called them fonts anyway, and you do now as well, even though that&rsquo;s not the original, literal meaning.</p>
<p>The way language works is that words and phrases mean whatever people generally use them to mean, no matter their origins, no matter what you or I think.</p>
<p>Currently the term &lsquo;foundry&rsquo; is in general usage for businesses like yours. And you haven&rsquo;t come up with a clearly better one.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to be stuck with people categorizing your business as a foundry, then you could start by getting MyFonts [[http://new.myfonts.com/search/terminal+design/foundries/?view=list|who lists your business under foundries,]] to change.</p>
<p>Then you can work on FontShop and Fonts.com, who use the term the same way, as well as many &ndash;er&ndash; foundries who use the term the same way.</p>
<p>Then you could be driven into the depths of despair over your inability to change the course of the English language. Or you could get over it :)</p>

(We use a lot of archaic words in the digital realm, e.g. &ldquo;scrolling&rdquo;.)
At least &ldquo;foundry&rdquo; suggests the font production aspect of type design, i.e. manufacture, as opposed to packaging, publicity, or retailing.</p>
<p>But when a company that is primarily a publisher or a distributor is referred to as a foundry, that doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>In fact, that&rsquo;s what is confusing in Frode&rsquo;s original post, where the term &ldquo;foundry&rdquo; is used to describe both the designer&rsquo;s business, and the publisher&rsquo;s.</p>

I&rsquo;d prefer to be listed as a font company rather than a foundry but the font biz tends to favor old fashioned terminology so I&rsquo;m often listed as a foundry.

<p>..thing is, independent type designers, the branch of the industry I think you&rsquo;re alternating to, do not really publish other people&rsquo;s fonts. So when someone asks this kind of question, why do solo indies jump up and start gesticulating at Founders like we&rsquo;re an evil cram of hyenas?</p>
<p>Terminator: &ldquo;Publisher, Maker, Distributor, Designer, Manufacturer, Developer all seem to me to be better than Foundry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But a bit long in total, you know? &ldquo;We are Font Designer Maker Developer Manufacturer Publisher Distributors&rdquo;, trips so ponderously from the tongue. Foundry says it in a word to the wise, and to those who are not it says whyzen up a word or two.</p>

<p>also in regard to language changing over time, i highly recommend the documentry series &lsquo;The Adventure of English&rsquo;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.madman.com.au/actions/catalogue.do?method=view&amp;releaseId=8142">http://www.madman.com.au/actions/catalogue.do?method=view&amp;releaseId=8142</a></p>
<p>i have it and it&rsquo;s really interesting to see how things have changed, or not changed&hellip;</p>
<p>it often seems to happen that words we say all the time now mean something quite different from how they were originally.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I wouldn&rsquo;t normally call MyFonts a foundry, but in the context of ff&rsquo;s question, his usage of the word seemed to include any distributor.</p>
<p>If the dividing line is creation/design/production vs other functions, any person or company that creates some noticeable chunk of the fonts they sell, or are involved in the production, seems worthy of being called a foundry. Certainly I consider my former employer, Adobe, a foundry.</p>
<p>I certainly don&rsquo;t object to folks using other terms if they like. We&rsquo;ll see if eventually some other name becomes dominant.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
