body: "This is my first serious attempt at designing a sans serif. It's a neo-grotesque
  with a low x-height. Here's a preview, though the anti-aliasing is a bit wonky:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mirabeau-preview_6098.gif]\r\n\r\nI
  would like this to be the seed of a versatile family, so I want the letter forms
  themselves to be quite neutral. The longer-than-usual extenders will give the letters
  plenty of character anyway. No kerning has been done.\r\n\r\nI need to do more about
  regularizing the stroke widths; so far, my optical corrections have been minimal.
  I deployed ink traps only on a number of Latin capitals.\r\n\r\nThere's a lot of
  room for improvement all across the board, so I'd love to hear your critiques."

  body: "I loved it. Very clean design.\r\n\r\nAlthough I am not that experienced
    but personally I feel, your lowercase *w, *x, *y & *z need some work. *w need
    proper weight distribution, whereas *x and *z seems top heavy optically. Second
    joint is the letter *m seems a little weak.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks, Satya. What would you suggest for the w? Since I don't have a well-developed
    eye for these things, it's not obvious to me how I should correct it. Right now,
    it has left-right mirror symmetry, the outer strokes thin somewhat, and the inner
    strokes are parallel and thinner than the outer strokes.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/w-closeup_5218.gif]\r\n\r\nIn
    letters with similar top and bottom halves like s, x, and z, I tried to apply
    just enough optical correction so that the two halves look roughly equal in size
    whereas most typefaces make the top half visibly smaller. If some of the letters
    look top-heavy, then I'll have to adjust them. I'll have to try to get this balance
    uniform throughout the design, anyway. The capital S looks more top-heavy than
    the lowercase s, for instance.\r\n\r\nYou're right about the m. It has been modified,
    and it will be reflected in the next PDF update.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/m-comparison_5423.gif]"

  body: "I am telling based on what I have been taught. This could be totally wrong.\r\nIn
    the *w, the first stroke(\\) should be thicker; second(/) thinner; third(\\),
    thicker than second; and fourth(/), should be thinner than the first. also it
    should match with the other letters in style and the grey value. It's exactly
    how you hold and draw this letter with a calligraphic pen. Same thing applies
    to all the other letters with diagonal strokes, such as *A, *V, *X, *Y, *K, *M,
    and so on. The rule remains same, just that the sans will have lesser contrast
    than that of Serif faces.\r\n\r\nSame thing goes to the circular letters as well.
    When you draw an *O with calligraphy pen, you get the maximum contrast at top
    right and bottom left (\xD8). Even if your typeface has less contrast, you must
    apply this rule to make it look optically correct. Although all the sans-serif
    faces looks as if they have same stroke thickness all over, but it depends on
    the letter to letter. Eg, the vertical stem of the letter B should be thinner
    compared to the vertical stem of the letter *D since *B is more dense in nature
    than the *D.\r\n\r\nI don't know how many people follow all this, but I think
    a good typeface should take care of all this.\r\n\r\nBest\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks, Satya. I see what you are saying about the w. The thing is that I'm
    doing a neo-grotesque with strictly vertical stress. Modulation where the / diagonal
    is thinnest and the \\ diagonal the thickest applies to humanist sans serifs and
    even some grotesques, but not to this particular genre of constructed grotesques.
    Take a look at Univers or Helvetica for similar examples of vertical stress.\r\n\r\nI
    have not made the full optical corrections for the denser letters yet (B vs D,
    for example), because I'm not sure how much correction will be necessary. Such
    adjustments are very necessary in Korean typefaces because the density tends to
    vary more, but with a Greek/Latin/Cyrillic typeface you have to be more subtle.
    I have shaved off the stem weights in the densest letters, but I'm not convinced
    that B's density is such that it needs this type of adjustment. I am trying to
    keep the stroke widths as mathematically close as possible for the moment."

  body: "You are probably right. It also depends of typeface to typeface.\r\nBut btw,
    here is a scree grab of the letter *w from Univers LT Std 55 Roman, see it yourself.
    \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/w_Univers_4746.jpg]\r\n\r\nI hope you
    get some good feedback from experienced people, I am too amateurish to say anything.
    \r\n\r\nGood Luck!"

  body: btw; v, w, and x are the most complicated letters for me. I never get them
    right at first draft.

  body: "Thanks, Satya. That's a great picture!\r\n\r\nI did find that my mathematically
    symmetrical w appeared just the tiny bit asymmetric (the second diagonal looking
    a touch thicker than the third), but wondered if that's because I'm so used to
    the humanist stress axis. I'll try to learn from other fonts how they solved this.\r\n\r\nI
    also find v, w, and x very difficult, and they are often the last Latin lowercase
    letters I draw."
