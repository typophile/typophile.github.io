  engraving? What is it? Where does it come from? Why does it look that way? What's
  a monogram? How does engraving factor into the history and function of type?\L\LThe
  only way to truly appreciate engraving is to try it yourself\u2014come experience
  the \"cut\" by which engraved letterforms are made\u2014everyone in this workshop
  will be encouraged to try their hand with a \"graver\" (or \"burin\"), the real
  tools of this elegant, virtually forgotten trade.\L\LSpecimens of vintage monograms,
  lettering styles and engraving will be displayed. Using simple tools such as graphite
  pencil and various sorts of erasers, attendees will trace, combine, retrace existing
  forms and learn to make new symbols, letters and forms with these historic pieces
  of inspiration.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typecon.com/calendar.php?category=Workshops"
