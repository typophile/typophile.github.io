  branding.  It's got a great look to it and a pretty distinct \"R\" so I thought
  you'd be able to help pretty quickly.  Also, if you're able... what is the serif
  below it?\r\n\r\nThanks guys!\r\n\r\nMichael[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Another
  Company font_4426.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLVED:\r\nI believe I found it.  [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/chank/adrianna/extended-regular/|Adriana

    look at AT Sackers Gothic \r\nSOMETHING and COMPANY is a Garamond variant, but
    I'm not sure which one."
