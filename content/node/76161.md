  requires precise font rendering and I'm having trouble doing the calculations correctly.\r\n\r\nHere's
  an example:\r\n\r\nA user selects 36 point Helvetica as their font. How far down,
  in pixels, is the baseline?\r\n\r\nHere's my calculation:\r\n\r\n12pt is 16px, therefore
  1px = 4/3pt. \r\n\r\n36pt * 4/3 = 48 pixels\r\n\r\nThe baseline, per a book I have,
  \"sits one-third the point size up from the bottom\", so the baseline in this example
  would be at 32px. \r\n\r\n32px, however, is smaller than the height in pixels of
  a capital A in 36 point font, which means the top of the A gets chopped off when
  rendered, so something is off.\r\n\r\nWhat am I doing wrong?"

  body: 'What you read is just plain wrong. The relationship of a baseline to the
    bottom of the em as well as to the top is fairly arbitrary as different fonts
    have different stuff under the baseline. What you need to do is research how the
    vertical metrics of fonts work. Start with: http://kltf.de/downloads/FontMetrics-kltf.pdf'

  body: "The Bad News:\r\nFonts comes in 1000 point, and also in 2000 point, or 2048
    points, or whatever the designer of each fonts has chosen.\r\nThink of it as if
    JPG images comes in 72 dpi, 300 dpi or whatever \"resolution\".\r\n\r\nThe Descenders,
    baseline, x-height, caps height, and ascender height can be chosen at will by
    the font designer within the font \"resolution\".\r\nSo, there is no standard
    on that.\r\n\r\nThe Good News:\r\nYou can read those values out of the font meta-data
    and adjust at your will.\r\nModern browser do something similar via the CSS property
    called \"font-size-adjust\"\r\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/css3-fonts/#font-size-adjust\r\nhttp://emdpi.com/cssfontsizeadjust.html\r\n\r\nHope
    it helps!\r\nGood Luck\r\n"

    32px.\r\n\r\nThe book is false.* 1/3rd's a good starting point for average fonts,
    but the top of the em and baseline are determined first, (unless you are writing
    lines up the page?), and the descent can be as little as 1/6th in some cases.\r\n\r\nAnd,
    1/3 of 48 is 32 from the top. \r\n\r\n>32px, however, is smaller than the height
    in pixels of a capital A in 36 point font, which means the top of the A gets chopped
    off when rendered, so something is off.\r\n\r\n*The font you have selected is
    probably proving that. \r\n"
