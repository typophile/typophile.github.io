  body: Can you lighten the /N/s a little? The spacing looks good but the /N/s look
    dark to my eye.

  body: NN looks a hair tighter than the rest with an exception of OR that looks looser
    than the rest.

  body: "Thanks for that. The diagonals on the NN fill out that space and seem to
    drag the Ns together. Subtle change.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logotest2_6185.gif]"

  body: You can always explore the option of opening up the intersecting strokes,
    especially for print purposes. I am assuming this will go on a business card or
    something? Creating some "clog reduction" would most likely reduce the "type color"
    for the NN, especially if it is displayed at a larger size or for print, and it
    does not compromise the rest of the letterform. You can see this extreme example
    here from Matthew Carter's font [[http://nicksherman.com/articles/bellCentennial/inkTraps.gif|Bell
    Centennial]].

  body: Thanks Wesley, I'll have a look at that option. It will eventually be used
    in print and on screen.

  body: "In light of Wesley's remarks I would also shorten the crossbars of the G's
    a bit\u2026\r\nAnd on an altogether other matter: the wordspace def. looks American
    (in other words: too wide. The same width as an N works better, I think."

  body: I'd also consider removing G's crossbar altogether. Worth a try.
