body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm working on an OT font for both the Mac and PC. I'm using Fontlab
  Studio to develop on a Mac. The font uses a number of composite characters, assisted
  by the CCMP feature. The font seems to work well on Mac OSX 10.4 with Mellel, TextEdit,
  NeoOffice, etc. \r\n\r\nWhen I use the font on a PC, most characters seem to display
  well with the execption of any composites that include the wsuperior (U+02b7). With
  these characters the wsuperior appears to default to display of the individual glyph
  as opposed to being part of the composite. I've included a portion of a CCMP feature...\r\n\r\n

    body: "Hi Adam,\r\n\r\nOn the Mac (OSX 10.4 FLS5.0.2)...\r\nMellel\r\nTextEdit\r\nNeoOffice\r\nOmniOutliner\r\n\r\nOn
      the PC (WinXP)...\r\nWordPad\r\nNotePad\r\nMS Office 2003\r\n\r\nI have a number
      of composites in the font (such as a 'C' with a 'caroncmb' and 'commaabove'
      that appear to properly reference the composite on the PC. The 'symptom' that
      I see that tells me something is not working properly is that the top postion
      for the wsuperior glyph (not in a composite) is almost at the the ascender.
      In the composites the wsuperior glyph is positioned much lower. When viewed
      on a Mac 10.4 the wsuperior glyph appears to be properly positioned. However,
      on a PC (WinXP and Office 2003), the wsuperior is positioned at the ascender
      height.\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\n"
