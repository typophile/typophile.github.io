body: "Hi All,\r\nI need a typeface that I can use for the bottom of this letter head
  I'v attached.\r\nI want the words to be joined up and to create a horizontal line
  as much as possible along the base line. \r\nI guess it is similar to neon sign
  typefaces.\r\nI found this typeface attached that could work but I don't know what
  it is. If you can identify what Iv attached or have any better suggestions Id be
  majorly grateful :)\r\nYael"

  body: "Thanks so much. These are really great.\r\nSomething like Air Conditioner
    OT is good.. but a little too square. I need something more rounded and flowy.\r\nStarlet/Star
    sort of achieves this but it is too bulky and doesnt create enough of a line along
    the baseline.\r\nAny other suggestions anyone?\r\nYael "
