body: "Hi there gang,\r\nGot a new project on at my work where I've been asked to
  come up with assessment media (books or pamphlets)which can been used in the outdoors.
  \r\n\r\nSo for example - a trainer would take this assessment book or sheet out
  into the field on his/her mountain bike or kayak to assess a trainee on practical
  stuff.\r\n\r\nWe currently have notebooks with waterproof paper that can be written
  on with Biro pen, but other then that, I don't know where to start looking for this
  type of printed media! Any one heard of this kind of stuff?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    and the Fisher Space Pen ought to work anywhere except the ninth ring of Hell...

    stocks that would work, and they could obtain full-size sample sheets for you.
    I'd suggest testing a sample to make sure that your pen can write on it.\r\n\r\nHeavier-weight
    papers are less likely to flap around in the breeze. Also be sure the papers are
    secured in some way (3-ring binder or whatever) so you don't end up chasing after
    them.\r\n\r\nLamination is another option if the pages don't need to be written
    upon.\r\n"
