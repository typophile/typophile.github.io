  body: 'There is an interesting interview with Carol Twomby somewhere on the internet.
    She designed the regular and Slimbach the condensed of Myriad, then they each
    edited the other&#39;s design to make it more uniform. But maybe the different
    hands show. I like the condensed better. <BR> <BR>Frutiger has more character
    - but Myriad was trying to avoid any ideosyncracies.  '
