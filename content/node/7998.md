  body: I agree. A very good collection of typoimages. <BR> <BR>The gallery mechanism
    that Ben used is the amazingly sweet &#40;and astonishingly free&#41; Flash

  body: Nice stuff! <BR> <BR>But Hrant, isn&#39;t this where you normally explain
    that what we&#39;re &#40;mostly&#41; seeing isn&#39;t found type, but found lettering?

  body: Marc, I&#39;ve learned to restrain myself - so I only bring that up when there&#39;s
    a terminological angle to the discussion. And of course now there is.  :-&#41;
    <BR> <BR>Not even &#34;found lettering&#34;, but &#34;found letters&#34;; maybe
    even &#34;found symbols&#34;. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: I didn&#39;t pound any back button; I just opened the lot in my favourite
    image viewer. It&#39;s often possible to use software that <i>doesn&#39;t</i>
    fight you every step of the way.
