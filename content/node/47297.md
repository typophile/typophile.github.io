  body: I'm not sure you've seen the "Masterpiece" "font" many times. It looks handwritten
    to me and not a font at all (note that all the 'e's are different). Maybe what
    you <em>have</em> seen is stuff in a similar style, such as <a href="http://www.veer.com/partner/link.aspx?i=1048&c=4&p=products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000181">Affair</a>,
    <a href="http://www.veer.com/partner/link.aspx?i=1048&c=4&p=products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000149">Ministry</a>,
    and <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/blambot/skin-deep-bb/?refby=typographica">Skin
    Deep</a>.
