    a bit of a trade off here, if you live under the smog generated by LA you can

    of the smog\r\nhovering over torrance probably\r\nwas generated in long beach...\r\n\r\nor
    wilmington, to be precise.\r\n\r\nsomehow, though, i think that\r\n\"the wilmington
    printers fair\"\r\nwon't have the same ring to it.\r\n\r\nsorry i wasn't able
    to make it,\r\nhowever.  i bet it was smashing.\r\n\r\n-bowerbird\r\n"
