  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">The layout I chose to redo in the computer out of my sketchbook is the "Loyola Type" assignment.  The concept I had behind this assignment when I did the sketch was to visually represent the enormous cultural and physical differences that exist between students at Loyola that make Loyola so unique.  In other words, with typography, I tried to represent the types of students you might find anywhere on campus.  

When I brought the sketch into the computer initially, I knew that it wasn't anywhere near as good as it could be, but I wasn't sure how I was going to take it to the next level.  I decided to first try making a stylized image of the front of Loyola, since that is where this unique culture is found.  I didn't want the image to overpower the type (because of course, this is a typography assignment), so I made it slightly transparent.  

I still had the problem, however, of making the actual type look interesting.  I did a little research (or at least, reference work) and decided to use Dada for my inspiration.  I think that Dada is so extremely different from all other movements in history, much like Loyola is very different from many other colleges in the world.  I used this idea to vary the style, font, direction, and sizes of letters to resemble the chaotic yet structured feel of Dada.  I think that my layout turned out a little more structured than most Dada layouts, but after all, I think the culture of Loyola is more structured than that in the time of Dada.

Overall, I'm definitely happier with the computer version of my layout.  I think that the structure and the varying fonts makes it look more purposeful and professional then the sketchbook layout.  Although my concept behind both layouts was the same, I think that the computer layout is more effective in visually representing this concept.

		<div class="commentbody">But wouldn't Beatrice Warde <a href="http://gmunch.home.pipeline.com/typo-L/misc/ward.htm">say</a> that the most important function of typography is to communicate? This piece falls short in that regard - it doesn't say where to drop the money, or what will happen to the victim if I don't.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree that it isn't perfectly designed and may not seem like it has a purpose, but we (my class and I) are still learning how to use the computer programs and what can actually be done when it comes to designing on the computer.  What can I say?  I'm sorry if you don't like it, but please understand that it is quite a learning process.  I definitely plan to redesign this piece again once I have a more clear idea of what I should do with it.  Thanks for your comments though!</div>
