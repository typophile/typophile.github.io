body: Hi all! I thought this would be an easy font to find as it&#39;s so basic, however
  I am having no luck finding something quite like it. At first I thought it was Machine,
  but that&#39;s got no serifs and is even more basic. &#34;What the font&#34; on
  myfonts.com can&#39;t come up with a match either. Anyone have any ideas? <BR> <BR><img
