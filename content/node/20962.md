  for a project at the moment, and whilst it stands good for smaller point sizes,
  when used a lot larger the character space (as in space bar) seems to be a little
  wide, is there a way in indesign that I can adjust this, or is it a case of going
  into the suitcase in Fontographer and adjusting the space kerning there. \r\n\r\n"

    orientation. I would minimize the spacing of larger sizes manually for better
    results.'

  body: "BUt can I control just the word spacing?, the character kerning is fine.
    To kern the word spacing manually (i agree is the best way), but when I am looking
    at a few hundres words it could be a little time consuming. Dont get me wrong,
    I am all for the tiniest of details but at the moment we dont have the benefit
    of time. \r\n\r\n"

  body: Do you mean the space between every word? In that case it can be done in the
    preferences. You can here descide most these kind of advanced preferences.  Sorry,
    but I dont know what the right word for the preference pane is in english - but
    in swedish it's here STYCKE > JUSTERING...[img:sites/default/files/old-images/adjusting_indesign_5109.png]

  body: "If you're working on a document with which you do not want to affect <strong>all</strong>
    word spaces, and you are using Character Styles, I have a solution:\r\n\r\nDo
    a find/replace command to replace word spaces with thin spaces and apply this
    to a specific Character or Paragraph Style so that other word spaces aren't affected.

  body: Or just make different "typography-templates" for the different texts. It
    can be set differnetly for different areas in the document.

    all my jobs:\r\n\r\nJustified Tight\r\nJustified\r\nJustified Loose\r\n(in addition
    to the Rag and Rag no hyphen H&Js)\r\n\r\nYou can attach a specific H&J to a Paragraph
    Style Sheet. Not to a character style sheet tho, the H&J will affect the entire
    paragraph.\r\n\r\nIt also helps a lot with widows & orphans and is much better
    than tracking them up."
