  the apartment blocks use this font or a similar one. The example is taken from the
  gorgeous <a href=\"http://wikimapia.org/2134/Edif%C3%ADcio-Copan-Oscar-Niemeyer-s-Copan-Building\">Edificio
  Copan</a>\r\n\r\nLooks like ITC Blair but is there something more authentic from
  the time (mid fifties) that this is based on? Only got a few characters in the image
  - sorry.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help."

    generally useful for ID purposes. For future opportunities, try to get letters
    like A, E, G, J, K, M, R, S, and W, which tend to be more varying between typefaces.\r\n\r\nI
    could not find a writeup about the origin of the design for Blair, but it is possibly
    based on existing lettering that Jim Spiece saw elsewhere, as most of his work
    has been revivals of older designs. \r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    have a feeling it's very common as I saw it everywhere on the condos of Sao Paulo.
    \r\n\r\nReminds me of the <a href=\"http://www.dorothyperkins.com\">Dorothy Perkins</a>
    font 9which must be pretty obvious to you lot... ?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "To follow up on the idea of older designs that might have been similar to
    the lettering you showed, I looked in the oldest of the Photo-Lettering Catalogs
    I had (from 1960), and there are a number of typeface families such as Hamilton
    Gothic, Darius Wide, Paramount Gothic, Amsterdam Card Grotesque and others that
    include variants that have wide geometric sans letters that look very much like
    ITC Blair. Almost any of them could have been models for it. \r\n\r\nMost of these
    were probably never digitized. Today you could pick from ITC Blair,  ITC Flatiron,
    Akzidenz-Grotesk Extended, Trade Gothic Extended, Engravers Gothic and House Neutraface
    (1 and 2), and probably find something to replicate the lettering you saw.\r\n\r\n-

    - not what I was looking forward but maybe useable for other things.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again"
