  the PowerPC architecture is no longer supported.) when ever I try to autohint-h

  get it running FDK. '

    on-line bargain? (g) See  <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/macbookair/specs.html\">Apple's
    Macbook Air specs</a>!\r\n\r\nBut check your system (in the Apple menu); if this
    says you <em>do</em> have an Intel-chip, there might be some error in the FDK.
    Altough the latest version runs flawless on my desktop Mac."

    body: 'haha no it''s not a powerpc, it''s a legit MacBook Air from apple.  FDK
      is just telling me that it is. I''ve tried reinstall, reformatting, partitioning
      and installing on a separate partition. Nothing. Just wondering if anyone has
      run into the same problem with this using the new Air. '

    Not that it would matter, <code>autohint -h</code> gives this output on my desktop

    at least it runs.\r\n\r\nAre you sure you have the Very Latest version of the
    FDK? If so, it might also be a failure of your installed Python (the FDK uses
    this extensively). Mine is Python 2.7.1 and as I have virtually <em>no</em> knowledge
    of Python and don't recall installing or upgrading it manually, it must have come
    with Lion, this FDK, or possibly some other software."

    is virtually no software that you can use create anything useful with (I mean,
    AAT, come on!). At least, that's my experience with it. Better try and get ADFKO

  body: "This is bizarre. The FDK is still built with support for PowerPC chips  as
    well as Intel chips. This message is from the operating system, not the FDK program,
    and it is saying that it doesn't see the Intel code, only the PPC code.  This
    has nothing to do with Python version or the options you are using with the programs.
    \r\n\r\nIt is possible that the Lion OS on the latest Airbook does not support
    the somewhat old FDK Intel code, but I have not heard about that kind of problem.
    I will look and see if there are other cases. I think it more likely that your
    download is damaged. Can you try down-loading the FDK again and re-installing?\r\n\r\nThe
    error message seen by Theunis de Jong  is another issue altogether. \"BlueValues\"
    are the PostScript name for alignment zones. Hinting a font is a lot more useful
    if there are some alignment zones, and  fonts without any are illegal and not
    guaranteed to work in all rasterizers. so autohint is built to object strongly
    if the alignment zones are missing."

    it proves the latest FDK runs correctly on my system.\r\n\r\nYou don't seem to
    think it could be the OP's Python? I can't tell which part of the FDK would show
    the original error message \"Can't launch ..\"\r\n\r\n(Late Night Edit) Oh wait,
    indeed you said so already."

  body: "Looking at this again, I suspect that you provided the real error message,
    \ not just a paraphrased version. If the error message does really complain about
    running the program \"FDK\", then you are using a much older version of the FDK
    that is pre-Intel. The FDK version 2.5  does not have the \"FDK\" program. Did
    you download from:\r\nhttp://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko.html?\r\n\r\nIf
    so,  you  nevertheless have an older version of the FDK on your system, and the
    current \"PATH variable is pointing to it. Please follow the instructions for
    installing the new FDK as described in FDK/Read_Me_First.html.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n
