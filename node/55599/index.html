<p>I decided to chose two separate pages in my sketchbook and combine them into one to make the page more interesting. I chose two entries that had elements that I liked but were too simple on their own. I wanted to do something with my &lsquo;hand-drawn type&rsquo; page {skeletal} and my &lsquo;favorite&rsquo; page {tape}.</p>
<p>My concept was a page that celebrated imperfections and truly encompassed the &lsquo;hand-drawn&rsquo;. I added color and took apart and re-pieced together sections to create the final outcome. It is still simple because I don&rsquo;t like a busy page, but yet it is more interesting than the original.</p>
<p>I was inspired by the work of Stefan Sagmeister and his hand-drawn type and the postmodern era. Last semester, I created a type specimen book for the font Blockhead, and this page reminds me of it. I am always apprehensive in using my hand and this was something that was a stretch for me.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hey Katie, this blog is one of my favorites. I&rsquo;ve had a look at your sketchbook and I have to say, I think it&rsquo;s pretty amazing. Because you used an old book, it gives the whole thing this cohesiveness which is really nice. Not to mention a lot of your entries have a very clean and neat quality about them. By looking at it, you seem to really enjoy your sketchbook, when a lot of us look at it just another thing we need to get done. You&rsquo;ve inspired me to embrace my sketchbook a little more..so thanks! =)</p>
<p>(A little side note about this blog entry itself&hellip;I really like how you kept the sketchiness behind the word skeletal. It let&rsquo;s it keep some hand drawn qualities which I&rsquo;m always a fan of.)</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Katie, I also wanted to comment on this particular piece. I really love how you pulled the two pages together. Separated they seem a little bare, but you were able to form a solid composition pulling a couple of shapes from one page. I love the subtle use of color as well; it is a nice accent to the over all concept. Like Cali, I love hand drawn type. Another thing that sticks out to me is the repetition of geometric shapes in the page. The folded down corners seem to draw the viewers eye to the rest of the page, even if it was just an accident. Anyways, I think this piece goes to show that composition can still be great using simple shapes and materials.</div>
