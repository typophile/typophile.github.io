body: "I work for a small human factors consulting firm and we're currently working
  with a client on a new labeling system for their products. Legibility is critical
  for this client's domain, and their current designs use different color combinations
  in certain places to differentiate product variants.\r\n\r\nSome of the color combinations
  they chose worried us, and so we set out to find an objective measure for legibility
  on which we could then base our recommendations. The best we have found thus far
  have been the [[http://www.paciellogroup.com/resources/contrast-analyser.html|color
  difference and contrast ratio measures]] put forth by the [[http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-WCAG20-20060427/appendixA.html#luminosity-contrastdef|W3C]]
  and [[http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/abouthp/accessibility/webaccessibility/color_tool.html|Hewlett-Packard]].
  However, it worries us that these measures were created to evaluate colors on screen,
  not on print. After a bunch of snooping around online and looking through some of
  the usability books we have around the office, we've been unable to find any equivalent
  rules for printed text.\r\n\r\nIf anyone knows any rules or resources that would
  help us with this problem, please chime in. Thanks so much."

  body: "We did perform user tests, but they were small formative tests and weren't
    strenuous enough to allay our concerns. We based our recommendations for small
    color changes on the W3C and HP formulas I referenced above, but for some reason
    the client is being very hesitant to follow our advice, which is foolish. It makes
    much more sense for them to make these extremely minor changes now than to wait
    for us to potentially uncover an issue when we run our larger summative tests.
    By that time, making alteration could be much more time consuming and expensive.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    thanks for the links. I'm familiar with the Nilsson papers and the Peachpit article.
    None of them really provide the objective measure we're looking for. The Tinker
    summary is interesting. I'm familiar with some of his studies on type legibility,
    but wasn't aware that he had published a book. That might be cool to track down
    at some point.\r\n\r\nIf I find anything interesting, I'll be sure to update you
    guys."

  body: "<em>...an objective measure for legibility...</em>\r\n\r\nThere is no such
    thing.\r\nIn print, graphic designers and typographers often work with Pantone
    colour samples.\r\nI sometimes use the Pantone Color & Black Selector, which shows
    what type looks like printed in a selection of colors on white, or knocked out.\r\nBut
    of course a sample book which showed every possible colour combination on different
    stocks would have millions of pages.\r\nSo the best strategy is to rely on a graphic
    artist with aptitude and plenty of experience in working with colors in print. "

  body: Nick, from a design standpoint I agree with you. But from a human factors
    standpoint, I'm saying there are ways to quantitatively measure the difference
    between a foreground and background color, and what I'm looking for is a set of
    rules or guidelines that establish a threshold for legibility. Basically something
    like the rules in the WCAG but for print.

  body: "I don't believe typography is susceptible to human factors management.\r\nAt
    the general level, any guidelines are platitudes no better than common sense.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    I do believe that it is possible to measure and predict performance within narrow
    ranges of variables, but this is really \"product development\", and can't be
    extrapolated into valid general principles.\r\n\r\nThere is always one active
    thread or another at Typophile going on about \"readability\" tests, and I have
    read most of these. So far, I have not come across any reference to experiments
    with colour and legibility. I get the impression that most test situations are
    typographically naive to the point of banality (e.g. http://www.typophile.com/node/46304
    ), so of little practical use.\r\n\r\n "

  body: "Tinker & Patterson conducted a reading speed study on print that looked at
    a variety of ink and paper colors. Black text on white paper performed the fastest
    and all other combinations are reported as percent slower than black on white:\r\n
    \r\nBlack text on white paper 0\r\nGreen on white -3.0\r\nBlue on white -3.4\r\nBlack
    on yellow -3.8\r\nRed on yellow -4.8\r\nRed on white -8.9\r\nGreen on red -10.6\r\nOrange

    I don\u2019t think contrast ratio actually has anything to do with hue color,
    but with lightness. It\u2019s possible to make legible text with very dark blue
    letters on a very light blue background. Contrast differences should be measured
    differences between foreground and background luminance. This Legge paper plots
    reading rate by contrast differences as measured in luminance differences.\r\nhttp://gandalf.psych.umn.edu/users/legge/read5.pdf\r\n\r\nCheers,

  body: "I think this is your important variable: Contrast. It's sort of basic, but
    any color combo you list by name (as above) could be rendered with lots of contrast
    or with none. I can use a light green, dark purple, deep red or light blue, so
    color names may not tell you very much. \r\n\r\nI'm skeptical that the contrast
    analyzer algorithm takes color blindness into account. I also agree that print
    applications are probably different enough from the onscreen targets that you'll
    need more data. Is there some material about which colors are more distinct to
    more people, accounting for the ambiguity of color blindness? I know someone with
    color blindness, and there are certain colors that are more obvious and safe,
    and some that simply never resolve as true, and it doesn't have to do with saturation,
    lightness or what they're next to. "

    so much harder to read than green on red?\r\nWell, the green paper was probably
    a light tonal value, so should have been tested against a similar tone of red,
    i.e. pink.\r\n\r\nIf black on white was best, why was red on yellow better than
    red on white?\r\nThat suggests it's not something which can be just reduced to
    tonal contrast.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nIt would be logical for black on white to perform
    best, as that is what most type designs are optimized for!\r\nHowever, there is
    another genre, news text, where typefaces are optimized for grey-on-grey.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nResults

    blindness. It's very cool. We sort of used the feature informally while evaluating
    our client's color combinations, but didn't find any problems critical enough
    to warrant action.\r\n\r\nKevlar, in the case of the W3C formula we've been using,
    the hue does play a role in the color's luminance, and therefore in the contrast
    ratio. Check out the links in my first post for more info. The equations are pretty
    simple and are based on RGB values. Thanks for the article though. I'll check
    it out.\r\n\r\nNick, once again I agree with you. Unfortunately, we're not the
