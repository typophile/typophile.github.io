body: I don't know if this is a font or if it was hand-done but judging by both the
  lowercase I's being the same it's possible it's a font. Does anyone have a clue
  what typeface this may be?

  body: Can't find it either. Closest I have is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/blaze|Blaze
    ITC]], actually pretty close for 'iji' part but completely off for /F... The more
    I look at it the more I think it could be a mash-up, /F from one part and /iji
    from another... Or custom drawn...
