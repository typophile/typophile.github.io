		<div class="commentbody">Your question is not entirely clear with regard to the difference between publishing and printing. Does the author plan to self-publish this book, by having you design it and send it to a printer? Or does the author plan to submit it to a publisher, in which case the author does not usually get to choose who will design the book?</div>

<p>Three completely different things.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to &ldquo;register&rdquo; for copyright. The book is copyrighted by law as soon as it is written.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ISBN: Yes, you can apply for this through the Library of Congress. If the book will be sold in stores, you&rsquo;ll want a barcode to go with it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Library of Congress #. The LOC does not grant CIP data to self-published books.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, what Joshua said, but with a minor correction on ISBNs. The Library of Congress doesn&rsquo;t sell them; in the United States they are sold by Bowker (isbn.org). For self-publishing, it is also possible to buy them from a reseller; this can be much cheaper since the reseller can buy a large block of numbers at a low per-unit price and sell the numbers in it more cheaply than buying a single ISBN from Bowker. The disadvantage is that in that case your ISBN won&rsquo;t have a meaningful publisher prefix, and some distributors don&rsquo;t accept such ISBNs. So I&rsquo;d say, if the author wants to do the sales and distribution, a reseller ISBN is fine; if stores or Amazon will be involved, get one directly from Bowker.</div>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had to. It depends how the author does the self-publishing. With places like CreateSpace you can get a package that includes the ISBN, and no further effort is required. But if the author wants a more independent process, then if there is to be an ISBN, either the author or the designer (assuming there is one) has to get it. And if the author has never published before, as is not uncommon, the designer is more likely to have some idea of the process.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It has been several days, but I forgot to add that one reason my wife got into production &ndash; and packaging &ndash; is the pay is often better. Like so many designer, my wife found she (they, now) make as much or more off composition as design, and the number of people who can <em>package</em> a book &ndash; take a manuscript that still needs editorial work and take it through print/bind &ndash; is relatively small.</p>
<p>This has led her studio to do a fair number of architectural books, often by smaller, historic cities in the North Carolina, usually published by the city or county. There is a lot of hand-holding, but it is paid for.</p>
<p>I suppose just to balance that impression, I should mention they also do a number of art books for Yale University Press. It is easier to have a business if you have a mix of services.</p>
<p>Something to consider. &amp; here&rsquo;s another one I know of</p>
