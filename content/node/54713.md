  We are going for a clean modern look.\r\n\r\nI think we have decided on Cronos Light

  time picking a typeface for headlines, do you guys have any suggestions?\r\n\r\nThank

    SNIDE COMMENT</code>\r\n\r\nI actually really like Cronos Light. But for body
    copy? If you go with anything bold, your page's weight is going to be very top
    heavy. \r\n\r\nI bet a nice serif would work well. Sticking with Slimbach, I would
    second the Minion, but not the black. Perhaps Minion Pro or Pro Condensed set
    in all caps?\r\n"
