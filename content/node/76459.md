  children. The logo is supposed to appeal to children and educators (parents and
  teachers). It should have a \"smart child\" look about it.\r\n\r\nCould people please
  give me their opinion of the design that I have made including font?"

    it

  body: Thanks Penn. I took out the words and lines from the logo (see attachment
    2 above) but it looks a bit weak. Don't you think that the lines give it more
    structure and child-like feeling (see attachment 3)?

    the left in a certain way?

  body: "Thanks Apankrat. I don't think you can make a K with squares. It would require
    changing the idea completely, I think.\r\n\r\nThe jigsaw is not a new idea but
    it symbolises things coming together in order. Plus the company is doing educational
    games. Does that idea come through?"

  body: "If you just detach the lower right jigsaw piece mirroring the top right one
    (but maybe with a slightly different angle, if the \u201Cin order\u201D part is
    needed), you could retain (or even strengthen) the concept while visually reminding
    the K."

  body: Thanks Riccard0, I had a go at your idea but couldn't get it to work. Jigsaws
    are actually very complicated with all the male and female parts etc. It's hard
    to get them to do anything in between chaos and all fitting together.
