  body: "Hmm. I just noticed the R's are different in the first 3 lines. \r\n\r\nLooks
    like it may have been a variety of cuts with different weights (perhaps woodcuts
    with a shortage of letters). The A on the first line and the O on the 2nd line
    look too heavy, along with some other weird shifts in weight. Maybe from something
    like this http://www.uppercasegallery.ca/uppercase-journal/2008/12/5/a-new-old-product.html\r\n\r\nBut
    REQUIRES is HTF Knockout 49 Lightweight.\r\n"

  body: Line 1, ("LET'S START A"), and line 3 ("THAT ACTUALLY") look like <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/search/alternate+gothic/fonts/">Alternate
    Gothic</a>, but each line might be a <a href="http://www.linotype.com/43162/alternategothic-family.html#">different
    weight</a> (in the case of Alternate Gothic, each weight varies in its condensation).

  body: "What really stood out to me was the inconsistency of weight, especially in
    the A's of the first line.\r\n\r\n@Paul: Definitely on the money with that ID.
    Very distinctive <strong>R</strong> and characteristic <strong>Q</strong>.\r\n\r\n@marcox:
    It sure appears that way. Also, looks to have been intentionally weathered to
    mimic letterpress printing.\r\n\r\n@Ricardo: Could very well be. Still a mystery
    to me why someone would set letters like this.\r\n\r\n@all: Thanks!\r\n"

  body: George, is this a contemporary design? Is the photograph cropped? Any other
    info that might give a clue as to why they tried to mimic weathered letterpress
    printing (if that is indeed what was done here)?
