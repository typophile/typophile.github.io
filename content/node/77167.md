    line is drawn is somewhat dependent on a person's ability to metabolize alcohol.\r\n\r\nLuckily,
    I inherited my dad's liver. He's 75, drinks a lot of wine and stronger spirits
    (gin is his favorite, followed by bourbon), and is quite healthy, but I have yet
    to see him drunk in the \"alcoholic\" sense. However, I am not a type designer.\r\n\r\nA
    type designer once wrote to me the following, which I like to quote from time

    this wasn't a problem of Goudy's, but given the saltier true version of the \"stealing

    Then we have Eric Gill, who, it is now learned, had rather worse weaknesses. I
    suppose if we really want to reach, we could even be suspicious of Beatrice Warde's
    choice of metaphors.\r\n\r\nBut really, typographic history appears to be, for

    military building in Quebec City, an officer's club. All the chairs are distorted,
    some with legs of different lengths, others with a short arm on one side and a
    large on the other, and so on. It's like you're tipsy before you even start drinking.
    \r\n\r\nHowever, as with much substance-inspired art and design (although music
    is somewhat different), it's only the inspiration that occurs when high, the execution
    is done straight. There are some forms of art that can be done with shaky hands,

    in question is not an alcoholic. \r\n\r\nMatthew Carter tells the story of a time
    he was flying from the UK to the US and stopped in the duty free shop at Heathrow.
    He spied a bottle of Scotch whose label was printed using one of his types, so
    he bought it. As he exited the shop, a woman holding a clipboard asked him to
    take a market-research survey. When she asked him why he chose that particular
    brand of Scotch, he answered, \"Because I designed the type on the label,\" and
    watched as the researcher puzzled over her questionnaire for a check box that
    corresponded to that answer. "
