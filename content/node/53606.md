body: "CheapProFonts offers a wide selection of mainly display-fonts with a large
  character set supporting 65 languages requiring more that the basic A-Z.\r\n(Check
  out the long list of supported languages here: http://www.cheapprofonts.com/Languages
  )\r\n\r\nWhat I have done is to team up with several well-known freefont designers
  (like Ray Larabie, Nick Curtis, Brian Kent and Derek Vogelpohl), and use their fonts
  as a starting point to make updated professional quality multilingual Unicode fonts
  - and then offer them at a very low price and with very generous licensing terms.\r\n(Check
  out the license here: http://www.cheapprofonts.com/License )\r\n\r\nI started building
  the library one year ago, and have managed to rework and release one new font almost
  every week through 2008! The library is continually expanded with new releases,
  and new designers. All the reworking is done under agreement with the original designers,
  and they receive royalties from the sales.\r\n(Check out a complete overview of
  the fonts here: http://www.cheapprofonts.com/ALL_Fonts )\r\n\r\nI hope many \"foreign
  language\" users find CheapProFonts a valuable resource for cheap and cheerful display
  fonts supporting their specific language needs.\r\nWelcome! :)\r\n\r\nKind regards\r\n\r\nRoger
  S. Nelsson\r\n-- \r\nhttp://www.CheapProFonts.com\r\nHigh quality multilingual fonts
  at a low price - for professional (non-english) designers with a small budget!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CheapProFonts-1-year_3650.jpg]"

    wondering why some characters are greyed out.\r\n\r\n(Edit: should've read the
    small letters. Those are for \"foreign loanwords\".)"
