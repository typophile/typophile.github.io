  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello everyone – long time no see! Glad to be back on Typophile. I miss all of you! Long story short, I got married last June, moved to Hong Kong and now teaching at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (more updates later, I guess).</p>
<p>Now – I’m writing a proposal to seek funding to license a set of fonts for the school, mainly for the Visual Communication and Advertising disciplines. Right now we have an abysmal set of (mostly) default system fonts on our computers in the studios and labs, mostly PCs. I’m tired of seeing the same fonts over and over again in students’ projects. And we have next to nothing in terms of fonts with advanced features (multiple weights, &lsquo;pro&rsquo; fonts, or fonts with ‘expert sets’, etc. we do have a few Adobe Pro fonts) for fine typographic work.</p>
<p>Does anyone here have experience in equipping a design school with fonts? Could you share your experience? I have a few font families that I have in mind. Ideally, I would like to have a set of 20-30 high quality, professional fonts. Some of which will be classic typefaces – several from each typeface category; some will be ‘contemporary’ typefaces (really difficult to choose here). We also need some good Chinese text and display faces too. So, we’ll have to license fonts from several different foundries.</p>
<p>I’ve talked to two Chinese foundries and Adobe Hong Kong about this. None of them seem to offer volume discounts or education site licences. Both Chinese foundries charge a premium on PDF embedability, which is unrealistic for a school, since the students mostly just create PDFs for assignment submission.</p>
<p>We have around 300 computers in the school in total. We could implement this in phases to minimize cost upfront. I’ve already written a ‘justification’ for our need for fonts. But I’m having a hard time working out the budget for this.</p>
<p>Any advice on this? Or recommendations for what I should include in the set of fonts?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I attend and work at a medium-sized privately-funded liberal arts college. Our Art and Design department has 38 macs in classrooms and a handful of laptops for faculty use. A little while ago, the department decided to update our aging typeface collection by purchasing 45 licenses for the Adobe Opentype folio, in addition to 45 licenses for a few extra typefaces that were deemed hip by the faculty (Meta2 OT, Mrs Eaves OT, Matrix, HFJ&rsquo;s Requiem).</p>
<p>In my estimation, this was a gross miscalculation. I spend about an hour a week clearing sometimes problematic fonts from dafont.com and elsewhere (Eduardo Recife of Misprinted Type fame is apparently a local hero) out of the folders where we keep the Adobe collection (We use Linotype Font Explorer X). A cursory glance at the student work reveals that there is very little use of the display faces included with the Adobe folio, and sparing use of everything else. I think this can be blamed mostly on instructor leniency, which runs rampant here, but I still can&rsquo;t help but wonder if it would have been more economical to purchase a handful of licenses for the Adobe Type for Learning folio and install them on only a few computers.</p>
<p>Personally, as a student, I think the majority of so-called grunge fonts are very dated. They are appearing on stuff in Walmart and besides, if you want a grungy look it&rsquo;s way more fun to produce it yourself, digitally or otherwise. Also, I would have liked to see something like the Umbrella Selects collection from Veer thrown into the mix. There are some inclusions in the adobe collection that are downright questionable… Hobo Std? Come on.</p>
<p>Anyway, to get back to your question&hellip; I think it is really important to come to a consensus with the instructors. If you&rsquo;re going to invest funds into purchasing professionally developed typefaces, then there should be some encouragement from the faculty to use the fonts.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m starting to ramble on here, but I just thought I&rsquo;d share my experiences.</p>

<p>Rather than license a set of fonts for the school, what is the price point for your students to purchase their own font licenses? How many students are there? Making the purchases of a particular set of fonts a requirement would go a long towards getting the discounts you are looking for.</p>
<p>If I had a couple of hundred students who were required to license a collection of fonts from me every semester, you bet I&rsquo;d work out a nice price. But a one-time license to a design college, where I know they will be pirated and copied for the next ten years, no thanks.</p>

<p>And yet instructors keep passing students who rely on grunge to get by. The design department at my school would be a lot smaller if students who rely on free grunge fonts (at an angle, to make it extra edgy!) and distorted stock photos to cover up for their lack to talent actually got called on it now and then.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>James, to some extent, yes. That&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s a huge market for used books, students share books, etc. The advantage that books still have over fonts though is simply expectation: due to precedent, ease of copying, whatever, people expect to have to pay for books more than fonts. I&rsquo;m not talking about celebrating that or even being defeatist about it, I&rsquo;m talking about not handicapping students too much by being stubborn about it. If you treat kids like you don&rsquo;t trust them, when they grow up they&rsquo;ll chew you up.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think I&rsquo;ve put forward an interesting licensing model here. Students are required to purchase all sorts of things when the attend school. A package of useful fonts that they will use throughout their school years and beyond should be one of those things. Different than books in that the fonts function as ongoing tools in their design practice. I don&rsquo;t see how a design student is going to think this is something they do not need. (They may think that this is something they don&rsquo;t have to pay for, but teaching that is not true is part of the university&rsquo;s mandate)</p>
<p>The point from a font makers perspective is creating a market. If every incoming freshman purchases a font pack, the incentive is there to offer those font packs at an attractive price.</p>
<p>What the chew on when they grow up is up them.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>James, your model actually makes a lot of sense, but I think it would work the best when we have some sort of a ‘laptop program’ in place, where students are required to purchase a laptop with a set of manadatory software before entering the program.</p>
<p>Yes, font priacy is rampant in many schools, and I know tutors who actually hand out unlicensed fonts to students. I think this is more due to the lack of education in this. Some students dont’t actually realize that fonts are like software applications and need to be licensed. I’ve been teaching for almost four years now and I really tried hard to educate my students about font licensing. Some (not all) have licensed fonts for their own use, even when they are still students. But most just cannot afford to pay for expensive licenses when they work on school assignments. They often research for a suitable font and pick one that they really really want to use, only to find that it is not something that they could afford, and end up using some freeware knockoff, system font, or the several fonts that come with Creative Suite. Or resort to priated copies that they circulate around.</p>
<p>But we have to face the reality that the current font licenesing model is not the best. Students need lots of fonts to closely study them and learn to work with them. Just relying on system fonts does not do the trick. In fact, I believe that all designers should have access to all available fonts before they make a committment to purchasing a license. A license to <em>use</em> rather than to <em>own</em>, perhaps. Would that be possible? It&rsquo;d be difficult to find a way for this to work.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think the laptop model would be good. It could work with James&rsquo;s idea too. It would simply be a matter of the school licensing the fonts to go with the laptops. When the student purchases the laptop they then register the fonts with the foundry so the foundry can know who holds license #25467.</p>
<p>The initial cost would go to the school and you&rsquo;d have to find a foundry willing to transfer license ownership. But I&rsquo;d think this really should work.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Keith</p>
<p>Thomas once corrected me on something related to this back in late 2005.</p>
<p><a href="http://typophile.com/node/15480">http://typophile.com/node/15480</a></p>
<p>In the end the design school where I work (AUT, Auckland NZ) did a deal with Linotype in 2006 for a (big) site license on the <a href="http://www.linotype.com/1783/linotypegoldedition171.html">Linotype Gold Edition 1.7.</a> I&rsquo;m not entirely sure, but I think the deal was finally sealed on the price Linotype were able to offer – the decision had been argued over by a number of competing interests within the school, including the need for &lsquo;classic&rsquo; and &lsquo;contemporary&rsquo; fonts, but sadly there was no Chinese dimension to this.</p>
<p>Personally if I had to do the process all over again, I would take up your suggestion here for an individual/laptop licensing model. Students simply don&rsquo;t value what they haven&rsquo;t had to pay for themselves – and they don&rsquo;t evaluate critically the font choices that they see on a server stuffed with what they erroneously presume to be thousands of free fonts.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>In my Typography 2 class, each student was required to purchase one typeface. It could be an entire family or just a single, but they had to use it for one of their projects (rather than just buying the cheapest font they could find and then not actually using it). They were told this at the very beginning of the semester so they could budget for it, if need be.</p>
<p>By this point in their schooling, they were on the track to becoming graphic designers, so this experience was relevant to their future careers. The school had purchased the entire Adobe library, so they did have another ready and rich pool of legal typefaces to choose from. In other words, buying their typeface was a supplement and a learning experience rather than a desperate need.</p>
<p>We discussed in class both licensing issues and issues to consider when making a purchase. They really learned quite a bit by going through the process of choosing, buying and using a typeface. For example, they would find out that their typeface didn&rsquo;t have the right character set they needed or they had chosen the wrong typeface, but already paid for it (this hit home the typeface-as-investment angle!). Many learned what a pleasure it is to work with a quality typeface of their choosing and what a difference it makes on a project. And so on.</p>
<p>It the right circumstances, students purchasing typefaces is a great learning experience and one they will engage in often as professionals. We ask them to buy all sorts of things&hellip; books, print outs, paint supplies, drawing pens, and so forth, why not fonts.</p>
<p>A little off topic now, but…</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Yes, Chester, I have a few things from Village that I&rsquo;d like to license for the school. I&rsquo;ll email you later.</p>
<p>Nicole, I think requiring each student to license a typeface is a very good idea. It would be a very educational experience for them. My worry is some students might not have credit cards which would make it very difficult to buy online, and it does seem like the only option in Hong Kong as we don&rsquo;t have any local foundries here.</p>
<p>Thomas, I called the main distributer of Adobe in Hong Kong and they don&rsquo;t seem to have a clue about fonts. I did mention Type Classics for Learning to the person I talked to and I don&rsquo;t think he has ever heard of it. Font Folio would be great, but would it be prohibitedly expensive? We would like to license fonts from other foundries as well.</p>
<p>Chinese fonts are a big problem! Even the most basic set from Monotype cost 300K+ (HK$) for 300 computers. This set only contains 15 fonts, and it&rsquo;s the equilvalent of the most basic seriffed, sanserif and calligraphic text faces.</p>
