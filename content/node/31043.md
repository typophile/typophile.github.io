    are the real true quotes in the font - zoom in to the Flash file to see the difference
    between the opening and closing quotes. You'll have to complain to the designer
    if you don't like them. :-)\r\n\r\nI'm surprised no one has mentioned the inktraps. "

    note, it looks like Segoe, the Frutiger copycat, has evolved since I first saw
    the pdf comparisons with the two. The counters have a more oblate look to them
    (flat round)\r\n\r\nMikey"

  body: "yup I see the ink traps too... \r\n\r\nI think both segoe and frutiger are
    not very pretty... myriad is the better 'informational' choice :->\r\n\r\nJust
    curious though... is the vista operating system fully opentype compliant- can
    use a typeface like Zapfino Pro contextual in word pad?\r\n\r\nMike"

    more noticable in the darker weights? People look at PDFs and see what they want
    to see. "

    judging from <a href=http://www.typotheque.com/fonts/opentype_feature_support/>this</a>,
    yes, and even more than, say InDesign CS2 can now. This is assuming the Notepad
    application in Vista uses the new Avalon API, otherwise, it should be a week before
    a developer makes something that does."
