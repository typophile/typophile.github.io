  on this subject as there are questions that I have which I don\u2019t believe can
  be answered easily or even agreeably for that matter.\r\nI am struggling to make
  decisions and form opinions on this, and as a very inexperienced student I would
  appreciate your opinions and knowledge on the subject. I am aware of this subject
  being covered before but it hasn\u2019t seemed to touch on the questions or answers
  I have been looking for.\r\nI am will be writing on this subject for my dissertation
  so please just fire away with anything you may feel is relevant.\r\nBelow are a
  few questions that would be most helpful so I can get an idea of just what typographers
  in the real world feel, thanks Lou\r\n\r\nDo you feel there is a need for and updated
  or new system?\r\n\r\nDo you feel a typeface classification is help or is too restrictive?\r\n\r\nWhat
  system do you use?\r\n\r\nDo you prefer to come up with your own system? \r\n"

    restrictive! \r\n\r\nThere have been several great classification discussions
    here on Typophile. Somewhere is super post from John Hudson, where he references
    an old Chinese classification system for animals.\r\n\r\nCa. 1993, Emigre published
    an article with Jonathan Hoefler about typeface classification. He pointed out
    that one of the results of classification was that designers sought out all of
    the holes or border areas of the system, and designed virtually unclassifiable
    faces for those slots. \r\n\r\nThis will only continue. I think that classification
    always runs after type design. Its like trying to put the whole ocean into a hole
    in the sand on the beach\u2026"

  body: "A typeface classification in terms of keywords is often a tricky thing since
    it is heavily subdued to subjectivity (except for the obvious standard serif/sans,
    different kind of serifs,... classifications). E.g. unless you're talking about
    a digitilized version of an original 60's font, you could dispute whether a typeface
    is really retro or not.\r\nI divided a bunch of my fonts in personal subcategories
    (mostly based on the graphic work it would suit well), but even being the single
    judge, I find that it still has its flaws.\r\nThe overall problem nowadays is
    probably the same as in music; too many subcategories are mixed in the creative
    process which might result in more original fonts, but also makes it a whole lot
    harder to catogorize them (a great example of this is Linotype's Konflikt - <a
    href=\"http://www.linotype.com/10110/linotypekonfliktregular-font.html\">http://www.linotype.com/10110/linotypekonfliktregular-font.html</a>\r\nI
    do find the tags on www.myfonts.com quite good, but you can hardly add up to 30
    tags to every font for every keyword that pops into your head. And just labeling
    everything a little different as a display font is not a solution either.\r\nMore
    choice often presents you with more doubt & problems.\r\nLess is more, but might
    not really do the trick in subcatogorizeing things anymore."

    area where classification seems to have much relevance is that of identifying
    or describing a typeface, eventually attempts to classify will end up with so
    many classes that one might as well use the font name.\r\nTim"

    body: "its not that im trying to classify typefaces , \r\nwhat the issue is that
      im trying to understand is , is there an actual need for any system at all,
      \r\nI do feel personally that as soon as any style of system is put into place
      then some see it as good and as a guide , some just see a new set of boundries
      to break , which to me the starting the actual system brings along a means to
      the end , if you understand me , but with that along the way it pushes type
      has evolve so then to me there is validation in a system , it feels like a vicious
      circle \r\n\r\nI did feel that even thought there has been calls for a new system
      there isnt a huge amount of interest about it thats what leads me to believe
      that people just would prefare to follow their own ideas about it \r\nBut i
      wont find out if this is the truth by guessing and the next best thing is to
      ask the people like yourself who are passionate about type because to anyone
      else its just irrelevent"

    a niche in a market and that niche is revealed by a classification system, I am
    not sure if it is true but then again I don't know what inspires type designers

  body: "skellysgirl\r\n\r\nThe first thing to do, I would think, is to investigate
    the history of type classification systems. They begin about mid-twentieth century.
    That's sort of a clue.\r\n\r\nI was asked by Adobe Systems, pre-Bringhurst, to
    do a classification system of their offerings for their magazine (can't recall
    the name), but I ignored it. Mainly, I think the theory of classification systems,
    per se, is nonsense as it is based on a flawed premise.\r\n\r\nBringhurst, for
    instance, bases his system on cultural historical developments. The problem with
    this is that it was only in the mid-19th century that type revivals began and
    they began in earnest in the late-19th century only because of the availabilty
    of film for photography. Without the ability to reproduce historical specimens
    there are no historical specimens. Bringhurst ignores such technological developments
    as influence.\r\n\r\nThe explosions in type design: the development of wood type,
    the wholesale ransacking of the recent past (19th-century) as the result of photoengraving,
    the early twentieth century revivals (one a pseudo revival, another a serious
    revival), the switch over to photo-offset composition in the late 1950s, the switch-over
    to digital in the 1980s; all of these are far more significant events than what
    is proffered by a systematic rethinking of historical continuum.\r\n\r\nAn then,
    of course, every classification system I've ever seen has this garbage can at
    the bottom where everything that doesn't fit anywhere else, is just thrown in.
    \r\n\r\nAre classifications systems useful? well, yes, but only if you have an
    understanding of THEIR development and purpose. I guess I should ask. How useful
    is a knowledge of Garamond's development in terms of a typographic designer's
    concern when it was previously not known (shown) prior to the twentieth-century?\r\n\r\nGerald

    body: "Hi gerald , thanx for your very informative and helpful view \r\n\r\nI
      have started by looking into the origins and at the moment I am following the
      lines of the enlightenment and the line perused by Robin Kinross that much of
      the origins stemmed from Moxons guide of how he wrote in his book that he found
      it easier to separate into size, from there the French alphabet which led to
      the point size, that is as far as I have gotten so far.\r\n\r\nI have found
      much information on  Brighurst and Catherine Dixon, but very little on the actual
      systems themselves and the only one which I have found a substantial amount
      of info on is vox\u2019s so for now much of my work is based around this.\r\nI
      am not sure exactly which avenue to travel down at the moment as I really need
      to speak to my tutor to make sure I am going in the right direction, my initial
      plan is to start with my interest in it followed by a brief history run down,
      then a detailed look at vox\u2019s system and how it has withstood the changes
      such as you mentioned in the post and see at which point it was that it started
      to fail if it ever truly worked form the start.\r\nFrom there I hope to look
      at the calls for a change and current efforts such as Dixon\u2019s and thoughts
      and suggestions made and to look at whether there is enough support for it and
      if it is feasible to expect a new system to be workable and welcomed.\r\n\r\nSorry
      to warble on and please excuse my write as I talk style, I am not quite as academically
      minded as many of my colleagues (I am an older student and have come to uni
      after a 15 yr gap), I can grasp the ideas its just then writing it and structuring
      it that I struggle with but that will be worked on, \r\nIf anyone can think
      of any texts or book that might be of any use or even just any thoughts I would
      love to hear them, thanks for your time and your replys, \r\nLou\r\n\r\n"

    Vox was the first or, at least, it was the first significant attempt. I've done

    him everynight. Sometimes he was boring beyond belief, other times humorous, and,
