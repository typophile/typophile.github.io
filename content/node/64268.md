  in Typography Grate the Purists\"</a>\r\nby Alice Rawsthorn\r\n\r\nLet's face it,
  most \"typography\" types are bourgeois anal retentives, drawn to typography because
  they want to impose uniformity on an otherwise chaotic and careless world.\r\n\r\n(hey,
  somebody's gotta do it! ;-)"

    on NYC is simply sinful!

    suited to the use: yes. \r\n\r\nBy the way Paul Sher says on the Helvetica movie
    that she hates Helvetica as representing uniformity and fascism. She says that
    with a smile.\r\n\r\nContra Alice Hawthorn, I cringe when I see all those Helvetica
    subway signs in NYC.   "

  body: "Hrant, I agree. Spiekermann really nailed the deficiencies of Helvetica.
    And Michael Bierut did a wonderful job of explaining its strength and why it was
    a great success when it came out. \r\n\r\nPaula Sher's wild exaggeration made
    clear why some designers have come to have a revulsion for Helvetica, and I found
    that delightful. \r\n\r\nHer point was not to communicate the technical truth,
    as Spiekermann did, but the negative emotional connotations that have grown up
    because of the way Helvetica has been used, and its ubiquity, as well as its original
    design.     "
