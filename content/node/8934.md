    set in a different program&#41;. That&#39;s worth something, isn&#39;t it?

  body: The main copy is still set in Minion &#40;that is, the newly expanded version
    of Minion Pro&#41;, but the display face has changed. I&#39;m not sure what it
    is. <BR> <BR>As for content, there is a significant amount of new stuff. In addition
    to some new fonts discussed in Chapter 11 &#40;&#34;Prowling the Specimen Books&#34;&#41;,
    Appendix A &#40;The Working Alphabet&#41; is massively expanded with detailed
    listings of a wide range of basic and inflected character sets, including analphabetics
    &#40;Latin, Greek, Russian/Cyrillic, etc.&#41;. This latter addition is likely
    the result of Bringhurst

  body: I got tired of waiting for this to move over to the Type I.D. area. The new
    title font is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/alcuin/urw-alcuin-t-light/testdrive.html?s=The+Elements+of+Typographic+Style&amp;p=36"
    target="_blank">URW Alcuin</a>, designed in 1991 by Gudrun Zapf-von Hess. It&#39;s
    described on page 205 of Version 2.4. <BR> <BR>As in earlier versions, &#34;of&#34;
    and &#34;Robert Bringhurst&#34; are set in <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/poetica/chancery-i/testdrive.html?s=of+Robert+Bringhurst&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Poetica Chancery I</a>. <BR> <BR>As for the bundle of e&#39;s
    in the corner, they&#39;re probably all mentioned in the book somewhere.

  body: On a serious note everyone -- it&#39;s not like I&#39;m complaining or anything,
    <BR>but moderating this Board is <i>a lot of work</i>, and I have to do it <i>all
    by  <BR>myself</i>. Traffic has increased dramatically over the last year, year
    and  <BR>a half, and if I don&#39;t keep up with it on a daily basis I need a
    couple of  <BR>hours of solid work to catch up. If you don&#39;t believe me, check
    the list  <BR>and count the number of new threads we have <i>per day</i>. <BR>
    <BR>In fact this extracurricular activity has become a money loser for  <BR>my
    freelance work. I&#39;m doing this on a voluntary basis, just like the  <BR>moderators
    on the other boards &#40;thank you Tiff for moving this  <BR>baby over here&#41;.
    I have to police the board -- which is quite a bit  <BR>of work as a lot of non-regulars
    and newbies come here --, help with  <BR>identifications, and most of all keep
    the place clean. As my fellow  <BR>moderators can attest, the Administration side
    of things is glacially  <BR>slow, and I have to open, check, tag and &#40;x&#41;
    every - single - thread. <BR>Why do you think you&#39;ll almost never &#34;see&#34;
    me in <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/30.html?1107034142"

    target="_blank"> Critiques</a> sections? No time left to contribute, plain and
    simple. <BR>My lovely wife once asked me to time my activities on this Board  <BR>but
    I simply don&#39;t <i>dare</i> to do it, silly as it may sound. <BR> <BR>So kidding
    aside, please be gentle and cut me some slack. Without  <BR>false modesty, I think
    I&#39;m not doing such a bad job. <BR> <BR>Now move along -- there&#39;s nothing
    to be seen here. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    &#40;Mark, Tiffany, <BR>Idunno, for example ... ?&#41; who might serve as moderators
    so that <BR>you&#39;d be able to relieve each other in quarterly intervals? Three
    <BR>months as moderator, then nine months off! Even one six-month <BR>alternate
    would provide a sanity reprieve. <BR> <BR>Anyway ... thank you for your labors
    and time. <BR><br>
