body: "Using a nice sketchy font called Karabine, but it has no capital letters and
  very limited symbols (such as no \xA3 etc.). I need to identify which font it has
  been based on so I can create the missing symbols from the right lettershapes. Or
  an alternate font which has a more complete set of symbols would be a big help also.
  \ Any help would be really appreciated."
