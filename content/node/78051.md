  body: Very Bauhaus... You could start with [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/bauhaus/light/|Bauhaus
    Light]] (cut /r's ascender, close the /a and /e and turn the /e). Another option
    would be to use the freebie [[http://www.ffonts.net/MonaKo.font|Monako]] (ripoff?)
    and to reproduce quite the same work...
