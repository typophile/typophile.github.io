body: "Hey all,\r\n\r\nI'm in the baby stages of establishing myself as a freelancer
  (for design and words). I was perusing your Logo/ID critique forum and suddenly
  felt like I might do well to get up what I have so far. I've started with the business
  card and plan to apply my concept to a web site and stationary/notecards.\r\n\r\nUltimately
  (over the next several years) I hope to grow from providing simple design and editing
  services to helping very small businesses establish their presence in print and
  online (along with my partner in crime and life, Patrick Beeson).\r\n\r\nMy biggest
  concern: I don't think that what I have incorporates a logo, more represents a calling
  card. Is that a problem?\r\n\r\nSecond biggest concern: Is it any good anyway? Really,
  I'm quite fond of it, but I'm open to tweaking. Even major re-thinking if it gets
  resounding \"boos.\"\r\n\r\nI'm looking at a long road ahead on this project and
  I want to get a good start.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your comments.\r\nLindsay"

    I see a condensed face letterspaced out as in \"beengo\".  I usually says, \"I
    like this face so much, I'm gonna wreck it.\" in addition, it shows nothing of
    your letterspacing skills, which should be excellent as you travel that long logo
    highway. I like everything else about it. \r\n\r\nCheers!"

    happy with the Myriad in my contact info, but not for the beengo. I want to hunt
    down another font (a blocky serif is what I'm thinking)."

  body: Oh, I like that. I'd been thinking chunky blocky, but there's something inexplicable
    about the Rotis. Thanks for the lead.
