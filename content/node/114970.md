  body: "I suspect that VIDALIA ONION FACTORY is lettering rather than a single font.
    Fonts with elements found in the lettering include Blippo http://www.myfonts.com/search/blippo/fonts/
    and Pump http://www.myfonts.com/search/pump/fonts/\r\nSimilarly for VIDALIA, GEORGIA
    you might tinker with Thats All Folks Bold http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/comicraft/thats-all-folks/\r\nDon"
