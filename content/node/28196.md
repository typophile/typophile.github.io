  it.\r\n\r\nIt's a font used on a letterhead, which is designed in the late 80's,
  \r\nthough i think it's done with a Drytransfer it could also be a custom job.\r\n\r\nThe
  second image seems to be the same font only distorted.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have an
  idea?\r\n\r\n"

    Funny how it seems to be seeing a resurgence of late. Such a curious old fart.

  body: I recently moved to Bosnia-Herzegovina where this <em>curious old fart</em>
    (i agree), along with ITC Benguiat, Hobo and Revue, is surprisingly popular for
    undesigned stuff, expecially shopfront signs.

  body: "Right, that does it. I must photograph two shopfronts 5 minutes walk from
    my house.\r\n\r\nThe Rising Sun sushi bar (Benguiat) directly opposite Hair &
    Nails Beauty Salon (Benguiat Gothic)\r\n\r\nI mentioned it to my wife on Sunday
    morning (again!) when we walked up the road. She told me not to tell anyone as
    it was rather sad.\r\n\r\nThis from someone who works maintaining ATMs, and can't
    watch an actor on TV withdraw cash without excited cries of \"Ooh, that's a Diebold!\"

  body: "As another data point, I noticed bold weights of Belwe on signs and posters
    all around Southern Italy and Sicily a couple of years ago. Benguiat, Hobo and
    Revue were also common. Sounds like there is a widely used font package that has
    these in it.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
