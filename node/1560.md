  took over the design of the BAUHAUS journal in 1929, he altered the design of the
  title, removing the last serifs on the &#34;a&#34;s and reversing it out. Bayer
  made the original! <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/18177.jpg"
  alt=""> <BR> <BR>Adobe&#39;s ITC Bauhaus is different... <BR>however i found a font
  called Bayer Press or Universal from Victory Type at <BR><a href="http://www.type.nu/bayer/showb.html"
  target="_blank">http://www.type.nu/bayer/showb.html</a> <BR>and seems like it used
  to be a free font. <BR> <BR>so if Noah Rothschild is here at Typohile i would like
  to ask him if he still has it...   <BR>axually i only need a couple of letters  a,c,d,e,i,l,m,o,t,&amp;  so
  i could draw them myself..  but a font would be better, needless to say. <BR> <BR>noah...  where
  are you?!'

    Universal</a> is also quite like your sample and is not an extreme price at under
    $20.

  body: Interesting to see the Joost sample from the previous post. It&#39;s from
    my <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/BauhausFaces7.html" target="_blank">Bauhaus-style
    Font ID Guide</a>. It&#39;s a place to look for geometric-style fonts, although
    I cannot always give a modern &#40;digital&#41; source for these, since many were
    scans from books with older type designs. You can see a few other styles with
    similar influences, like &#39;Eternity&#39;, but your VT Bayer Press does seem
    to be your best match.
