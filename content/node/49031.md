  quality printers for short run books in the new york city area.  It's photographers
  book with a run of about 100-250 books and is more image based. Attention to detail
  would be pretty important.\r\n\r\nthanks a lot in advance if you have any info!\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Is Rhode Island close enough? Extremely fine book printer of photographic
    images is Meridian Printing, in East Greenwich, Rhode Island. http://www.meridianprinting.com/\r\nMy
    wife also suggests that you simply make \"portfolio\" editions by printing the
    text conventionally; make 100 to 200 photographic prints of the images; and then
    hand-affix the images onto the book pages. Something like the old method of spot-gluing
    plates in letterpress days.\r\nThe resulting albums could be very valuable."

  body: "When you say \"short-run,\" are you thinking about offset or digital printing?\r\n\r\nIf
    you are printing only 250 books, an offset shop such as Meridian is going to be
    very spendy. But charles_e is right: they are very good.\r\n\r\nSince you are
    not getting any responses about short-run printers in NYC, check out BookMobile.\r\nhttp://www.bookmobile.com/\r\nMostly
    they do paperback books on uncoated stock. But they also do very good photo work
    on coated stock, and they can bind your book in boards. Their high-end color &
    b/w work is getting very close to \"offset-quality\" when they are given good
    files to work with.\r\n\r\n& they will send you a set of proofs before they run
    the whole edition.\r\n\r\npowers"

  body: "Hi Will,\r\n\r\nNot to disagree terribly, but \"approaching offset\" is a
    loaded term. I've seen some pretty poor offset printing (including images).\r\n\r\nThe
    only way to get it right, regardless of the paper, is to prepare a profile for
    a printer -- taking into account the *characteristics* of both the paper used
    & the press (includes ink). Then ignore all that dribble the printer sends out
    about chopping off the last 10 percent of the black & white. The profile handles
    dot gain; done right, you only loose about 1/2 of one percent with the black.
    White loss depends on the boundary colors (tones) of the image & whether or not
    you want to allow them to fade into the paper.\r\n\r\nI suppose I'm biased, but
    it became apparent to me long ago that the old dicta \"price, quality, speed --
    pick two\" is wrong. It is really \"pick one.\""

  body: "You are right, Charles, on the points you make in all 3 paras. I'm simply
    trying to get Otto in touch with a good printer, if digital is the way he wants
    to go. It is up to Otto to work out all these things with the printer he chooses.
    That's one reason I noted that BookMobile provides proofs. Often enough, short-run
    printers say \"give us the files; we'll send you your done job.\" Not good enough.\r\n\r\nOtto:
    wherever you print this, keep in mind Charles's points.\r\n\r\npowers"
