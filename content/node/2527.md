  all. <BR> <BR>I was browsing the web looking for info about dyslexia. Suddenly I
  found smth very interesting. <BR>Natascha Frensch, a Dutch designer made a typeface
  for dyslectic people, called &#39;Read&#39;. <BR> <BR>You can find more info here:
  <BR><a href="http://www.readregular.com" target="_blank">http://www.readregular.com</a>
  <BR> <BR>A lot of care is given to &#39;b&#39; and &#39;d&#39; kind of problems.
  People with dyslexia have problems with characters that look alike.  <BR>So a &#39;d&#39;
  is not just a mirrored &#39;b&#39; but it needs more characteristics to distinguish
  it from the &#39;b&#39;. Same goes for &#39;p&#39; and &#39;q&#39; etc. <BR> <BR>I
  love this initiative. Maybe some of you have interesting things to say about this.
  I myself do not design type, I just use it as a graphic designer.'

    <BR> <BR>The biggest problem I have with Frensch&#39;s project is that it is so
    poorly documented that it is impossible to tell whether the design decisions actually
    address anything more than a particular sub-problem of a particular kind of dyslexia.
    Even if you look at the rather sparse information on dyselxia provided at <a href="http://www.readregular.com/english/dyslexia.html"
    target="_blank">http://www.readregular.com/english/dyslexia.html</a> it isn&#39;t
    at all clear how differentiating letterforms in the way Frensch has done addresses
    any of the reading disorder symptoms illustrated there.

  body: Frensch&#39;s project seems to target only one of several different dyslexias,
    too, which dilutes its worth.  On the other hand, many other dyslexias can&#39;t
    really be tackled at all with typography - I wonder if it&#39;s the same with
    character-recognition dyslexia.
