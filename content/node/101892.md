  that I *thought* had worked before. Here's what I do:\r\n\r\nI go to Window->New
  Metrics Window. I change to Text Mode, and type:\r\n\r\n<brown>.\r\n\r\nI change
  the Metrics Window to Kerning mode, and nudge the 'o' far enough to the right it's
  obviously wrong. I go to Tools->Quick Test As . . . <whatever. I've tried OpenType
  and TrueType.) I change that Quick Test window to \"Content\" mode and type again:\r\n\r\n<brown>\r\n\r\nAnd
  . . . I see no change.\r\n\r\nMaybe someone could tell me what steps I'm missing?
  I have Class Kerning with exceptions, and I've also tried rebuilding the Kern feature.\r\n\r\nAlso,
  I have gotten this process to work by importing a commercial .otf file and saving
  it to .vfb, and after I make a kerning change and try the test, it will (if I remember)
  prompt me to rebuild the kern feature, and ask whether to save binary or compiled
  tables, and this only seems to work--rarely--when I select \"compiled.\""

  body: "Lo, long after I solved it . . .\r\n\r\nThe answer is maddeningly simple:
    I was doing everything right, but FontLab and Windows' font preview funtions/tools
    simply do not reflect the actual kerning. You must test the font with any tool
    specifically designed for it. I use FontXPert's \"Activate [font] Temporarily\"
    functionality.\r\n\r\nFontLab's kerning/text etc. preview windows do seem to reflect
    the reality."
