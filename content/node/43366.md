  and doctor\u2019s orders to not ski. Unfortunately I\u2019ll probably be on muscle
  relaxers for the entire trip and not be able to just drink away the day in front
  of a fire, so are there any cool typographic things going on out there?"

  body: I was just out in Colorado, and there was some really cool hand-painted lettering
    in the Vietnamese/Mexican area of Denver -- I wish I would have taken some pictures.
    If you make it down south towards Pueblo at anytime, there's Mr. Jim Bishop and
    his castle (known as Bishop's Castle) hidden in the hills of Beulah, and he has
    some wonderful hand-lettered signs warning of coming doom.

    tried the sugar-cane variety and no luck. Unfortunately I\u2019ve had to go easy
    on exercise because of the ankle, and my back is not happy about the periods of
    inactivity."
