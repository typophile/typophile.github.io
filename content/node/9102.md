body: There must be a simple way to tell InDesign that although I generally want to
  indent my paragraphs, I really  do not want to indent the first line of a paragraph
  &#40;because the previous line is empty&#41;. Could someone help?

    <BR> <BR>If I understand, you want &#39;hanging indents&#39; on your paragraphs.
    Just set the &#39;First Line Indent&#39; to the negative of what the paragraph
    indent is. <BR> <BR>For example:  <BR>Left Indent = 2p0 <BR>First Line Indent
    = -2p0 <BR> <BR>Your screens may look different. I&#39;m using InDesign CS in
    OS X.'

  body: Thanks but this does not work - I tried. If I set left indent above zero,
    the entire paragraph moves to the right, which I don&#39;t want. If I select the
    entire text &#40;a long text imported from Word&#41;, leave the left indent to
    zero and just increase the first line left indent, my paragraphs get indents all
    right, except such paragraphs should not be indented that are immediately after
    an empty line.  <BR>I&#39;m using InDesign 2.0.  <BR>Any more suggestions? I am
    really desperate and willing to try anything except folk dances.

  body: You&#39;re going to need 2 different setting to accomplish this, Aku. Select
    the paragraph that follows the empty line and set all of the indents to 0. Then
    select the rest of the text, and give it the first line indent you prefer. There&#39;s
    no simple way to automatically tell InD to not to apply the indents after an empty
    paragraph. <BR> <BR>I incorporate these settings into style sheets, e.g., Body
    Text No Indent, and Body Text. The first is based on the second, so that any changes
    made to the Body Text style make their way to the No Indent style as well. <BR>
    <BR>Once you get the styles set up, you could use Find/Change to find the paragraphs
    that follow a blank line and apply the appropriate style sheet.

  body: This is quite peculiar, as having the first para of a body of text flush is
    rather standard. Why can&#39;t Indy make it easier? Plugins anyone?

  body: As I mentioned in my post, Kris, this effect is already easily achieved with
    the intelligent use of style sheets.  <BR> <BR>But you&#39;re right, a little
    more power wouldn&#39;t hurt. I&#39;d like to be able to set up a parent-child
    relationship between style sheets, so that all text that follows a paragraph styled
    &#34;subhead&#34; has no indent, for example.

    nested styles from the upcoming version of InDesign. This seems similar to what
    you are suggesting, Marc.

  body: 'I use nested styles in InDesign all the time and they work wonderfully. I&#39;m
    using InDesign CS.  <BR> <BR>For the book I&#39;m designing at present, for example,
    I have: <BR>One parent paragraph style, with no indent, which consists of nested
    styles of: Drop cap, then 1st 3 words in small caps, followed by regular body
    text in rest of paragraph.  <BR> <BR>You can then define the &#34;Next Style&#34;
    to follow when you press the carriage return; which in my case is the regular
    body text face with a 1st-line paragraph indent . If you define this paragraph
    style to be &#34;based on&#34; the parent style, then any changes to the parent
    will flow on to the child styles &#40;eg: shared attributes such as the body text
    face, the color, etc&#41;. <BR> <BR>The book &#34;Real World InDesign CS&#34;
    has great explanations of styles and nested styles. Failing that, I think there
    may be something here: <a href="http://www.carijansen.com/tips/016/index.html"
    target="_blank">www.carijansen.com/tips/016/index.html</a> <BR>From memory, he
    also has material on previous versions of InDesign - there might be some material
    relating to the original question there.'

    only works if you&#39;re writing your manuscript in InDesign -- it doesn&#39;t
    apply to imported text, so it wouldn&#39;t help Aku.

  body: I found out that mostly you can save lots of time by getting rid of any pre-formatting
    before pasting your text into your InDesign document. Easiest way to do this is
    by pasting the text into an editor like simple text or word pad and save it again
    as txt or text only. That means a fresh start in InDesign without any strange
    preformatted bits and pieces and strange styles emerging in the paragraph styles
    list which may interfere with fresh formatting. If you need to draw a comparison
    with the originating word-document, a pdf works more convenient than the word-document
    itself.

  body: InDesign CS now ignores all formatting of pasted text by default. <BR> <BR>In
    the Scripting folder of InDesign CS, there&#39;s a sample script that&#39;s called
    &#34;TextCleanup&#34;. It runs find/change sequences on your text, like fixing
    double spaces and double returns, etc. that you can modify yourself to suit. There&#39;s
    instructions in there too. I&#39;m about to start experimenting with it.
