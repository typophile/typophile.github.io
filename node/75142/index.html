<p>Hello there,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a stalker of these forums a long time, and I&rsquo;m hoping you can all help me with this request.</p>
<p>A little while ago, I remember reading a journal or a blog someone had written that basically had a long list of &ldquo;free&rdquo; downloadable typefaces you could get, but then pointed out that they were exact copies of original typefaces (some of which are default on most computer systems) and this relates closely to my 8,000 word dissertation and FMP that I am researching for my Third Year of University.</p>
<p>The problem is, I&rsquo;ve lost the article between now and then, and only have a handful of examples to work with.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m asking, is what free fonts do you know of that are confirmed to be rip offs of original typefaces (is original the right word? I hope so). If you know of the article, even, that would great also!</p>
<p>Thank you for any help you can give me here!</p>

<p>Monotype was taken to court in Europe and Israel for Arial and the court ruled in every case that each letter was not the same as Helvetica therefore not a &lsquo;knock-off&rsquo;</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Actually Nick, I think there is some confusion. Bouwsma has, over the years, appropriated &ldquo;Arthur&rsquo;s style &quot; and possibly a bit of his work. That statement is probably not blunt enough, but it will suffice for the moment.  Most, if not all of his &ldquo;creations&rdquo; (Bouwsma) are the result of Arthur&rsquo;s generous mentoring and the use of a tool, the Coit pen, that Arthur was instrumental in designing. I find it odd, and offensive that Bouwsma never mentions Arthur or the books that were the source for some of the fonts he claims are his &ldquo;creations.&rdquo;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I can&rsquo;t agree with that statement. Just because people use the same tools and work in the same field does not make them rip-offers. A lot of designers are (at least at first) inspired by their teacher, sometimes to the degree that the works look a lot alike. This is not new, as this was the case already centuries ago, when artists were organised in guilds and transferred their knowledge in a master-student relationship. Inspiration is not the same as ripping of, especially when a lot of people are fishing in the same pond (like in typedesign). And then there is the phenomenon of the revival, working in a specific style (like geometric sansserif). Are all designers that create a new geometric sans-serif be called rip-offers of Futura? It seems silly.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I am a little unsure, but here I tend to agree with Uli (which is rare indeed). Although I am glad to have Huckleberry, because it means I have a pretty good font ready to hand to visualize this great typeface (I wouldn&rsquo;t even know where to get Mark Twain), I do think that Canada Type should ask those designers still alive whether or not they would agree to having their intellectual property revived.</p>
<p>I was always glad to have Canada Type, because they basically revive old typefaces which would otherwise, for the most part, not be available on my Mac, and then I couldn&rsquo;t work with them. On the other hand, it does not feel good to know I am using a font which was NOT made with the consent of the designer. There should be some more respect here. I think Rebecca and Patrick are doing good work, saving many of those typefaces I am particularly fond of - but they should really really give more credit to the original designers. It must be quite strange for Gustav Jaeger to read his name on the Myfonts website, although he never consented to have something like Huckleberry made.</p>
<p>Hmmmmm&hellip;.. my moral compass does not like it. Although I would of course not put it as rude as Uli did, because I do understand that Rebecca&rsquo;s and Patrick&rsquo;s reasons are by no means purely monetary, I daresay it is close to criminal, nevertheless. Maybe not in a legal way, but certainly in a terms of moral. <em>sigh</em></p>

<p>I agree that one should not produce &ldquo;inspired&rdquo; work based on typeface-designs (not the font files of course), which are not in public domain yet, even if it is not illegal. Anyhow this is a question where the problem of &ldquo;similarity&rdquo; is a very gray area, and an ideological black&amp;white view does not do justice to this problem.</p>
<p>One could claim Sterling is a rip-off of TNR, but since it has its unique selling point, and was genuinely crafted, not cloned, most people would see it as a legitimate product, right?</p>

<p>Perhaps you are right, I&rsquo;m not an expert. All I know is that I bought Bouwsma Text some time ago and that it is well crafted, and to my eye original. Perhaps more credit should have gone to Arthur Baker for making this possible, but I don&rsquo;t exactly know their relation. In my view Bouwsma does not rip off his types to benefit commercially from it. Maybe imitation and appropriation is another form of appreciation??</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Ah, maybe I phrased my question wrong (or maybe I simply have to explain my project).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not necessarily looking at &ldquo;stolen&rdquo; typefaces to say that they are stolen, I&rsquo;m taking closely similar typefaces and creating a project that educates the differences (or lack thereof in some cases).</p>
<p>Such as Helvetica and Arial. I&rsquo;m currently at the beginning stage in my project where my tutor literally wants to see loads and loads of made images, to do that, I need to find typefaces that look similar other than Helvetica/Arial and Palatino/Book Antiqua. It&rsquo;s not about taking the typefaces and saying: This is wrong, this is right, it&rsquo;s about educating and giving a choice. I mean, even Helvetica and Arial have their differences, and the point of the exercise at the moment, is to create as many images as I can to show that, and hopefully be able to move my project on.</p>
<p>My dissertation is being looked at by my tutor, and I&rsquo;ll be receiving it back soon to edit and rework, so he may bring up various other points anyway.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that helps at all in terms of saying what I&rsquo;m trying to do, but I hope it does.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@Kevin: Titillium is not a &ldquo;rip-off&rdquo; of anything, it’s a shared Open Source attempt patroned by the Accademia di Belle Arti di Urbino, started by my friend Luciano Perondi. Some forms may be similar to those of Klavika, but they have a lot more in common with a lineage of forms which has formed as Luciano’s own sensibility.</p>
<p>A &ldquo;rip-off&rdquo; may be called as such merely when there is a deliberate intent to copy and damage. So I would be very critic when judging these things.</p>

<p>I am always ready to evoke the silence brigade :-)</p>
<p>However, when someone has a point in a thread, I would never take into consideration other threads. That is not netiquette :-) And I do think this is at least doubtful - if a designer still lives, he should be contacted before you make a copy of his work. I seriously believe in that.</p>
