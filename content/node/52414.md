body: "The only way I can think to do this seems a bit complex so maybe there's ane
  asier way.\r\n\r\nIn Spanish (including modern day) often times the word \"de\"
  when set in all capitals is ligatured.  However, a standard ligature isn't enough
  because de appears in many words.  So I was going to do a contextual substitution
  to make sure I only nab DE as a single word.\r\n\r\nBUT, this is of course unacceptable
  in most other languages.  So here's my solution, and just wondering if I'm approaching
  it properly or if there is a more efficient way.  (I'm using FontForge so I'll use
  psuedo code)\r\n\r\n1: If language is \"es\", switch \"D\" with \"D.es\"\r\n2: If
  language is \"es\", switch \"E\" with \"E.es\"\r\n3: If sequence \"[any letter]\_D.es
  E.es\" found, match and do nothing\r\n4: If sequence \"D.es E.es [any letter]\"
  found, match do nothing\r\n5: If sequence \"D.es E.es\" found, replace with D_E\r\n\r\nThis
  requires making an extra glyph that is identical to a normal D and that in a Spanish
  document would be constantly being replaced.  I'm not sure if that in and of itself
  might cause concern as well."

    both marker glyphs, not just one. The only other way I figured required an illegal
    one to many substitution. You could try to define when you do want the sub, not
    when you don't, but it's trickier."

  body: "Hi Miguel,\r\n\r\nThank you! I didn't know about \"ignore sub\" .. that will
    be handy!\r\n\r\nSide questions:\r\n\r\n1. Is languagesystem toggled by the Language
    dropdown in the character palette of InD CS2?\r\n2. Is that the prefered way to
    do things like polish diacritics in apps without locl support, or stylistic sets?\r\n3.
    Can it be done in Fontlab's opentype editor or just FDK?\r\n4. In your liga feature
    how do you signal the end of ESP specific subs, say if you wanted to add french
    specific subs or the aforementioned polish diacritics?"

  body: "Hey Randy,\r\n\r\n1. Yes, it is toggled by the Language dropdown in the character
    palette, but it will only work in InDesign CS3 and up. Photoshop CS4 and Illustrator
    CS4 support it as well.\r\n\r\n2. If the app does not have support for language-specific
    lookups, things won't work. For example, Adobe has been putting language-specific
    code in its fonts (e.g. Turkish) for quite some time, but only with InDesign CS3
    we've started seeing the results of that code.\r\n\r\n3. You'll be able to compile
    the features and see the results in Fontlab, but you should also include the line
    <code>languagesystem DFLT dflt;</code> in the features. However, the current Fontlab
    5 will throw an error message because of that. You'll have no problems if you
    use the FDK.\r\n\r\n4. The end of ESP would be signaled by the end of the feature,
    the start of another language, or the start of another script. Matthew's case
    had to do with a language-specific ligature, so the best way to do it is through
    'liga'. In the case of Polish diacritics I'd say 'locl' is more appropriate. In
    the case of French, it depends on what you're trying to do. Below is some code
    for language-specific ligatures and diacritics.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nlanguagesystem
    DFLT dflt;\r\nlanguagesystem latn dflt;\r\nlanguagesystem latn ESP;\r\nlanguagesystem
    latn FRA;\r\nlanguagesystem latn PLK;\r\n\r\nfeature locl {\r\nscript latn;\r\nlanguage
    FRA;\r\nsub eacute by eacute.FRA;\r\n\r\nlanguage PLK;\r\nsub cacute by cacute.PLK;\r\n}
    locl;\r\n\r\n@ALL_LETTERS = [A-Z a-z];\r\n\r\nfeature liga {\r\nscript DFLT;\r\nlanguage
    dflt;\r\nlookup LIGA {\r\nsub f i by f_i;\r\n} LIGA;\r\n\r\nscript latn;\r\nlanguage
    dflt;\r\nlookup LIGA;\r\n\r\nlanguage PLK include_dflt;\r\n\r\nlanguage ESP include_dflt;\r\nignore
    sub @ALL_LETTERS D' E';\r\nignore sub D' E' @ALL_LETTERS;\r\nsub D' E' by D_E;\r\n\r\nlanguage
    FRA include_dflt;\r\nsub e t by e_t;\r\n} liga;\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nThe code in
    'locl' is straightforward; glyphs are replaced by other glyphs depending on the
    language. The code in 'liga' is a little more tricky because there are ligatures
    that you'll want to have for all the languages and/or scripts in addition to the
    language-specific ones. In this case, all Latin languages (including ESP, FRA
    and PLK) will have the 'f_i' ligature. In addition, the 'D_E' ligature will be
    available to Spanish, and the 'e_t' ligature will be available to French.\r\n\r\nI
    could have been more concise with the 'liga' code but when it comes to coding
    language-specific behavior I like to be as explicit as I can to avoid unexpected
    behaviors. For example, the keyword 'include_dflt' could be omitted (because the
    lookups under 'language dflt;' are inherited by default by other languages within
    the same script). However, 'language PLK;' needs to be included in 'liga' otherwise
    'f_i' will NOT be available for Polish."
