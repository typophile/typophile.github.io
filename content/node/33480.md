  body: "I thought Gill Snas too, but it's either a) a really crappy version, or b)
    not entirely Gill. Almost looks like the designer wanted a \"ransom note\" effect,
    but more subtle... i have no idea why (and the text is too hard to see - what
    is this an ad for?)\r\n\r\nIf this _is_ a ransom note situation, there could be
    a dozen fonts in there."

  body: The M A S V look like Gill Kayo Compressed. The T might be Gill Kayo. The
    R isn't. I'm so confused.
