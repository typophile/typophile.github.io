  thread in the Design forum, but I posted it here because it's more of an attitude
  question than a design one.\r\n\r\nHow accurate do you make your vectors?\r\n\r\nJust
  because it is possible to place node accurately to a 10 thousandth of an inch, do
  you? If you need precision and can have it, why not take the the time to get it?
  \ Right? Well, maybe, or does too much close scrutiny get in the way of  the overall
  visual effect you're after.\r\n\r\nI tend to go by the dictum that it's right when
  it looks right, but at times, I find my self fussing of over details that you wouldn't
  find with an electron microscope. On a computer it's possible to work to a much
  higher level of accuracy than output devices are capable of delivering, so what's
  the point?\r\n \r\nso where do you... Uh, draw the line. "

    can\u2019t expect to ever start doing it for money if I\u2019m not obsessing over
    the details. But when it comes to less important stuff, and I\u2019m in a hurry,
    I tend to work several times larger than final size and scale down to hide imperfections."

  body: 'Rounding node coordinates down to whole numbers has one very basic implication:
    they save computer resources. Long decimal fractions take more memory both in
    disk storage and RAM, and are also more difficult to calculate. Granted, that
    impact seems insignificant considering the massive leaps in computing power of
    modern systems, but it still adds up.'

  body: "It depends upon what you're working on. Because of the facility to work so
    much larger than actual size (and divorced from any real physical scale), it is
    hard sometimes to keep the end result in perspective. \r\n\r\nFor example, take
    the case of a type design destined for text at 12 point, to be output at 2540
    dpi. Twelve points is approximately 0.1667 inches. Multiply that times your output
    resolution and you get about 423 imaging units (toner dots, whatever) for 12 points.
    \r\n\r\nIf you're working with a 1000-unit em, then that's 2.36 em units per dot.
    If you're working with a 2048-unit em, then that's 4.84 em units per dot. \r\n\r\nSo,
    for a text face the practical truth is that tweaking a node one or two units either
    way probably won't even register as an actual difference in output.\r\n\r\nIt
    can be hard to keep that in mind when you've got that glyph zoomed in to 1600%
    and you're neurotically finessing that seductive curve at full size on the screen.\r\n\r\n--

  body: "But....\r\n\r\nSince digital type is scalable, and the type designer has
    no control on how big the glyphs will be rendered, all that anal attention to
    detail is probably worth something, since it will reveal itself somewhere along
    the line.\r\n\r\n\r\nJames"

  body: This is especially true for display fonts. If a font gets used large, you
    will definitely start noticing things, especially in tight curves and small shapes
    where the location of nodes and control points can be severely limited.

  body: "When shopping for display scripts (the kind that are supposed to connect)
    I zoom in 3200% to see if the joints perfectly fit. Not even the lovely Bickham
    Script connects perfectly... but I still love it. Splendid is not perfect either.
    Most don't. Besides scripts, any font I'm considering purchasing, I zoom in super
    big and examine every glyph. If I notice stuff that's not supposed to be there
    I won't buy it. This guy don't play. So don't even think about cutting corners!!!\r\n\r\nMikey
