  A summary of the current state of web font embedding. Until ~2 years ago I had a
  good grasp of it, making some PFRs and even \"delivering\" Mana via MS embedding
  (thanks to the help of M\xE5rten Thavenius) but I can't say I really know what's
  on the ground these days - like how effective Fairy (now called something else)
  is in practice, what else might be out there now, etc. Of course I can find articles
  online, but I'm interested in the aggregate de facto reality, not a collection of
  various de jure \"official party line\"-type statements.\r\n\r\n2) The \"\xF1\"
  glyph from Interstate. An EPS of it would be ideal, but if a person who has the
  font feels uneasy about that, a really large (like 800 pixel tall) black-on-white
  rendering of it should do. Weight/width: no need to have a perfect match, but the
  closer I can get to what's on the following sign the better: [img:sites/default/files/old-images/canada_s_6095.jpg]\r\n\r\nMy

  body: SIFR is generally considered the state of the art for font embedding right
    now (even though it's really a flash trick), google it and you'll find plenty
    of information. In general designers seem to be staying away from embedded type,
    due to poor support for the the older proprietary formats and SIFR being too complicated
    for a lot of implementations. It might be worthwhile to survey designers who threw
    in the towel on HTML and went to Flash, just to see how many of them did it to
    get away from the font limits of HTML/CSS.

  body: "James, thanks for the input. I also got some offline info about the embedding
    discussion at the recent TypeCon, and you're right, it seems pretty bleak. Flash:
    I agree that it's filling a gap on something the Grand Concensus Boys fell on
    their faces.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "\"A summary of the current state of web font embedding.\"\r\n\r\nI believe
    IE still supports the MS method (though not sure about IE7), but Firefox, AFAIK,
    and most of the newer non-IE browsers don't bother supporting any embedding at
    all.\r\n\r\n(And, IMHO, this isn't really a bad thing).\r\n\r\nUsing flash or
    an image is the only way to truly get the typeface you want, but introduces a
    variety of accesibility and usability issues that should be carefully weighed. "

  body: "In the \"Ca\xF1ada\" photo above, is that supposed to be a tilde above the
    n? It looks like a macron, and isn't how the \xF1 glyph of Interstate looks nor
    the official FHWA alphabet either. Truth be told, the official alphabet doesn't
    even have an \"n\" with a tilde (see their guide to the fonts <a href=\"http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/SHSe/Alphabets.pdf\">here</a>).
    But, I have seen it around, specifically on road signs near Ca\xF1on City, Colo.
    (like in <a href=\"http://www.rockymountainroads.com/colorado025/i-025_sb_exit_140_03.jpg\">this
    photo</a>, small as it is, cropped below).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/i-025_sb_exit_140_03_4992.jpg]\r\n\r\nTo
    clarify, are you looking for a straight macron-like tilde, or the real deal?"

  body: "Well, until about 2-3 weeks ago that \"n\" didn't have any diacritic on it
    at all! I guess somebody complained (damn mexican-speakers ;-) and it resulted
    in a macron... Actually, it's not even a decent macron from a font - look at how
    it spans the entire width of the \"n\", which makes it seem to extend more rightward.
    The thing is, the small homey white street signs along secondary intersections
    feature a real tilde... but that's because they're hand-made. And that will be
    one of the points in my talk: technology can demote culture. The more convenient
    something is, the more you have to care.\r\n\r\n> are you looking for a straight
    macron-like tilde, or the real deal?\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a real \"\xF1\" with
    a tilde (which only exists in\r\nInterstate, or actually other FHWA clone fonts
    too I guess).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
