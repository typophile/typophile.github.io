  in both English and Japanese that work with each other seamlessly. What Im curious
  to find out is;\r\n\r\n- Your thoughts on the idea\r\n- Any suggestions or recomendations\r\n-
  Any really good or even really bad examples of these two languages at play.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your help."

  body: "Virtually all Japanese typefaces include a Latin component, meaning that
    it is a problem that is tackled by every Japanese type foundry, Adobe included.\r\n\r\nGiven
    that the Latin glyphs are an add-on to the Japanese glyphs, meaning that the Japanese
    glyphs are primary, if you need to compromise the design of the glyphs for one
    of the scripts, it should be for the Latin glyphs, because they are not primary.
    But, there shouldn't be a need to compromise the glyphs of either script.\r\n\r\nThere
    are a few things to consider. One is to match the style, followed by the weight.
    Next, consider that the Japanese glyphs (kana, kanji, symbols, and punctuation)
    are optically centered within a square, but that the Latin glyphs rest on a baseline
    that is offset to some degree from the bottom of the square, anywhere from 10
    to 20 percent, with 12 percent being the most common."

  body: "This sounds like a difficult project.\r\n\r\nI'm definitely not an expert
    in this area, but I've got a little experience in mixing the two.\r\nalmost always
    Latin character sets included in Japanese fonts, but they tend to be either:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>fixed-width
    characters designed to be used for single words, acronyms, etc. within longer
    passages of Japanese text, or</li>\r\n<li>just copies of some existing, nondescript
    Latin typeface.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nI think there are also often both. You'd think
    that if you're setting a little Japanese in the middle of a bunch of Latin, you'd
    want that second character set. Sometimes this looks just fine, but since the
    Japanese characters are usually cap height, it can also look really awkward. I
    don't know if anyone else feels the same way, but in many cases, my eye expects
    to see the Japanese text at something closer to the height of small caps.\r\n\r\nI
    think that in order for a single typeface to include Latin and Japanese characters
    and look good all the time, it would need full caps, small caps, fixed-width versions
    of everything, and two heights of Japanese characters. Ugh."
