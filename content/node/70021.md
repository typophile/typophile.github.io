  question..\r\n\r\nI've been organizing my font collection and creating many new
  Categories via the Tags view.\r\nMy problem is I cannot find a way to delete/remove
  some of the categories that I don't use. This is an issue because the 'assigned
  categories' list is getting very filled and it's time consuming to scroll through
  them all.\r\nIs there anyway to delete these categories? Or even rename them?\r\n\r\nThanks
  very much,\r\nCoop"
