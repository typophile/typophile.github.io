body: "Hi all, I'm designing my cards and have been caught up trying to decide a way
  to best present my name, the problem is I'm writing it out in full in all caps,
  my name is MATT and kerning the double T's is killing me! I've drawn them together
  linking the crossbars but it attracted too much attention and looked odd, I tried
  to make custom T's with narrower crossbars but they too stood out strangely, the
  gap and between large gap between the ascenders and the tiny space between the end
  of the crossbars makes me cringe! Any thoughts? Advice?\r\n\r\nMuch appreciated,
  thanks in advance...\r\n\r\nMatt"

  body: can we see the layout?  Perhaps letterspacing everything would help? It is
    a rare set of caps that will look decent set tight on a word like MATT - see Tungsten
    in the samples. The density is just different.

    (upper and lowercase) to solve your problem?\r\nI think you'll still get the emphasis
    you want from the bold.\r\n\r\nOff topic, how about setting your details aligned
    to the 'n' of Syndrome to avoid the 'y' crashing into your name?\r\n\r\n"

  body: Thanks for the thoughts g, I'm sticking with the all caps, it follows a style
    I have set in other applications and I do like how it holds the hierarchy... These
    examples aren't very good quality, I didn't see it as "crashing" ever but do you
    really think it is an issue? I def like the alignment kept simple all at the left,
    has been working well across all other stationary...

  body: "To kern MATT correctly, I would do this:\r\n1. type NATN or HATH (whichever
    has both sides vertical and is largest), \r\n2. kern AT so that the visual distance
    between MA and AT is the same (other way of seeing it: so that you get the same
    white in-between)\r\n3. use the AT kerning value in MATT, chances are you need
    not change TT BUT if you do\r\n4. type HHTTHH or NNTTNN so you get an evenly spaced
    block.\r\n\r\nIMVVHO your name does not look good with the shortened TT bars;
    it might look better with \r\neither a ligature TT (joining on top)\r\nor a TT
    where only the inside of the 'cross' bar is shortened.\r\n\r\nStill, I would keep
    it as in the font (or change font).\r\n\r\nPS. My name is DAVID and in 99.99%
    of the fonts, it looks horrible when spelt in all-caps, I need to respace everything
    manually, sadly (working first on HHDAHH, then HHAVHH, HVIH and chekcing HIDH,
    though this is rarely a problem - then it all assembles magically). "

    exercise and see how it goes... \r\n\r\nMy first and second attempts at a fix
    were to create a ligature (looked like a big Pi symbol) and then to shorten the
    inner crossbars, both looked odd and stood out as such.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\nMatt"

  body: "All-cap (and small cap) settings are traditionally letterspaced, and to this
    day, many foundries add extra \"cpsp\" as an OpenType feature, as a matter of
    course.\r\n\r\nI concur with Ilene.\r\nWhen I first started making fonts, I put
    a lot of kerning in them, but now I consider that less is better. If a font has
    kerning between A and T, and A and C, as this one appears to, it only worsens
    gappy combinations where kerning is not possible.\r\n\r\nThe exception is the
    \"tight but not touching\" style, where the spacing is all about proximal distances,
    not the balance of light and dark.\r\n\r\nIMO, the proximal style makes sense
    for Syndrome, as it is a feature of the wordmark, where the stencilling leverages
    the proximal effect. So I don't have a problem with MATT MACDONALD; however, I
    find the letterspacing in Syndrome to be too great, in relation to the stencil
    gap, and the tightness of MATT MACDONALD, which is also much tighter than the
    U&lc text. So, the card exhibits three different spacing strategies--loose, tight,
    and default-- which seems wrong."
