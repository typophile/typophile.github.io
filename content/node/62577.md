  that you please follow the links below, where we are offering four short surveys
  on our  various brands. \r\n\r\nWe\u2019ll use the resulting information to improve
  and enhance the brands and the sites that represent them. All the surveys are anonymous,
  and we would especially appreciate feedback from the font-conscious folks at Typophile.\r\n\r\nIf
  you have other comments not addressed in the surveys, please  contact me offline,
  rather than post them here in this thread. \r\n\r\n[[https://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=fCCZUpPq2kJ47hXx6eCccg_3d_3d|fonts.com
