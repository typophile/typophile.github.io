  does mixing and mastering, but mostly mastering. People give us songs that were
  mixed. Sometimes we just really make them sound great. Other times, we actually
  have to fix a number of things with them that are actually mixing problems (if we
  didn't mix it).\r\n\r\nI'm not really sure about the name yet either, which I suppose
  might direct the font that is used. This has just been a side business up until
  this point, but now our network is getting bigger, so actually putting some effort
  into a brand/logo will help us out a little ;)\r\n\r\nAny ideas or types of fonts
  I should be looking into?"

    though can't be done just with a font*, you'd need to work on the individual glyphs**:
    you'd have a name that's 4-7 letters, and they would gradually change from left
    to right, becoming more refined, or stronger, or something. Maybe have the letters
    made of up circles, and the circles get slightly larger towards the right.\r\n\r\n*
    Unless it's a very special MM font.\r\n\r\n** Which is however the real way to
    make a logo.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    fonts that I have too. I have some that look similar. I'll post a logo draft soon
    for you guys to critique soon!
