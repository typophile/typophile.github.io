  body: "I found the Annual Report of their parent company (<a href=\"http://www.cgc-jp.com/ir/materials/pdf/ar2008.pdf\">PDF</a>)\u2026
    should be the same font in this logo, no?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cglass_3465.png]\r\n\r\nIf
    that is Futura, there was a lot of [[squoosh]]ing and erm, \"customizing\" at
    work. :-\\"

  body: "The logo in the PDF is converted to outlines. If you need the font to recreate
    the logo just open the last page of the PDF in Illustrator and grab it. Exact
    match. \r\n\r\nIf I had to guess it's a cheap knockout or someone hand traced
    a precious version. The angles and character widths are all over the place and
    the tracking \u2013 spacing between words is scary bad."

  body: "Angela,\r\n\r\nI feel your pain but now is a perfect time for a little client
    education. With a detail view of one of the letters pulled from the PDF (I'd us
    the R) explain to them after extensive research their logotype appears to be handdrawn,
    thus making it impossible to create variations for their additional companies.\r\n\r\nIn
    addition, I'd put their current logo on a sheet and recreate it with 'Futura Bold
    Oblique'. Obviously, you'd fix the tracking and spacing issues and present the
    two side by side. Explain the benefits of using a professional designed typeface
    and the benefits of having it available for corporate branding and the other company
    logos.\r\n\r\nAs a polite gesture tell them you'd be happy to use their current
    typeface if they can provide the name. ;)\r\n\r\nHere's a closeup of how bad the
    \"R\" really is.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Central_Glass_R_5203.png]"
