  this rendering of a font (the chop job on the left isn't my doing) and I'd like
  people to: take guesses as to who made it and/or when it was made; and give opinions
  about it (even though there isn't much there, I admit). If you already know for
  a fact who made it, don't spill the beans please, but feel free to opine on it (assuming
  you can remain objective even though you know who made it*). Just a midsummer night's
  puzzle, really.\r\n\r\n* That's not [necessarily] a hint. But it might very well
  keep you guessing, and there's nothing like speculation to get the mental juices
  flowing!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    In any case, Walter Tracy, in [[Letters of Credit]], claims that the original
    upon which this sample is based is \"obese and, to my mind, vulgar.\" And this
    version is \"superior; not so dark, but dark enough, and with cleaner profiles
    -- the work of a designer familiar with, and respectful of, the letter forms of
    traditional printing types.\" I take this as evidence that Tracy sometimes doesn't
    know what he's talking about. To my mind, this ripoff is not as friendly as the
    original, and well deserves its lack of popularity.\r\n\r\nAlso keep in mind that
    the metal had a number of alternates and swashes, including a 'g' of much more
    traditional form. These would probably be worth bringing back, at least.\r\n"

  body: raph, unless I'm totally off in identifying the face the LTC version has an
    Extras font that includes the tradition <em>g</em> and a bunch of other alternates
    and swashes.

    The original is overused IMHO and this one is a nice alternative if you want something
    fat and friendly. The LTC version includes all the original characters and some
    extras designed by yours truly. Check it out on this <a href=\"http://www.p22.com/products/images/LTC_Tshirt_FB.gif\">t-shirt</a>."

    But I do agree with Loxley that it was \"ahead of its time\". It's almost Underware.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    just to stir things up further, how do you think these fonts compare with Kompakt,
    another one we don't see much of these days? If we're going to have a font designer
    deathmatch, how can we not pull in HZ?\r\n"
