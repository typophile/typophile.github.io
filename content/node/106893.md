body: "This might be an easy one for you, but it's stumping me. This font is used
  on the [[http://kings.nhl.com/|LA Kings website (lakings.com)]] and social media
  ([[https://www.facebook.com/LAKings/photos_stream|facebook]], [[http://instagram.com/lakingshockey|instagram]],
  [[https://twitter.com/LAKings/media|twitter photos]]).\r\n\r\nThese are some fonts
  that I found to be similar in some respects, but not the right one: FF DIN, ITC
  Conduit, Battersea, Stratum 1, Stratum 2, Lintel, Route 66, Geogrotesque, Bourgeois,
  Rama Gothic, H&J Forza, Purista Web, Moire, Tstar, Helsinki, Nudista, Boxed.\r\n\r\nHere
  are some images from across their social media. I tried to include symbols, numbers,
  some lowercase, different weights, and certain letters (K, Q, M) that seemed to
  trip me up with the fonts above:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LAKINGS_mediafont_6021.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  would appreciate the help. Thanks."

    seem to do that or figure out where it says on the site.
