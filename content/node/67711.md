  struggling with this one, tried various concepts without any result but now I think
  I have something that will work.\r\n\r\nA smile and \"vibrating/shaking\" text.
  I'm designing the website as well and we're going for a \"street\" feeling so I'd
  like to convey the same message for the logo, bold and rough. This is the first
  version with my new concept. It might have a bit of a \"wild west\" feel to it.\r\n\r\nAny
  feedback appreciated\r\npeter\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/anders_logo_v2_6340.jpg]"

  body: To capture a sense of vibration, maybe you need to make it less predictable.
    It seems like it is just expanding at the ends. I'd be making it less regular
    and creating some more movement.

    like the mic should be a fairly large part of the symbol. I don't really know
    how to evolve the first version into something that works. Gonna do some retro
    wings now though.

  body: "We are thinking of making a sticker without the 'Anders Helenius' text so
    then the AH would be nice to have there. I was more worried that it looked like
    HH instead of AH.\r\n\r\nGonna try and add some colour to it and maybe have the
    AH as a part of the inside instead of it cutting the wings. Feels like the shape
    of the mic needs to be cut out like that otherwise the wings become too dominant.\r\n\r\nI
    think I'd like it more advanced though. First thought was a grafitti/stencil kinda
    thing but I don't think we'll do that any more. The website has that in the menu
    and the logo kinda disappears when it's all the same.\r\n\r\nWill work on the
    AH though if I decide to keep. Gonna play around with it some more.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nPeter"

    though, I think Ratbaggy is right on with his ideas on pushing it a bit further.
    I can almost see this on something like the side of a suitcase as part of the
    mark.

  body: "Mentioned Ratbaggys idea to the client but he didn't really go for it. Made
    a quick sketch with the microphone and AH as wings but I didn't really catch my
    fancy. I think I would have to draw it in more of a 3D view for it to work and
    that's not really where we want to go.\r\n\r\nIf it looks like it's for a lation
    rapper, that's not such a bad thing. Kinda that style we're going for but more
    rock 'n roll. Showed it to some friends as did the client and they didn't connect
    the logo with a TV preacher, not even after I mentioned it, I guess that's because
    that phenomena doesn't really exist in Finland or any of the Scandinavian countries.
    Here religion is still pretty old fashion. It's a concern but I don't think many
    Finns will make that connection.\r\n\r\nThe \"sticker on a suitcase\" is more
    of the direction I want. That's the plan as well to make stickers that he can
    put up where ever he has a gig.\r\n\r\nI've made some changes to it though.\r\n\r\nHe
    also wanted the logo to portray how his performance evolves or changes, going
    from nice to angry/critical. So I've split the logo in to parts and added a distressed
    feeling to one side.\r\n\r\nFigured the orange colour might be too \"nice\" so
    I've tried using red instead.\r\n\r\nAny feedback appreciated, thanks.\r\nPeter\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/anders_logo_v3_3611.5.jpg]"

    given the logo here for a sticker or a large poster format. How would you do it
    in solid black? Does distressing work as well in one colour?

  body: "Distressing works fine in one colour. And for a solid colour I'll probably
    just split it in the middle so that the two sides are obvious. I will increase
    the distressed part so that it is more obvious in smaller sizes.\r\n\r\nMight
    not even make it one colour at all. This will have a fairly limited usage area
    and to provide a one colour version might not even be necessary. Or make it so
    that that only the solid colour version has a line through the middle of the microphone.\r\n\r\nHave
    to check with the client what he wants but everything that he controls the layout
    of can just use the colour version. This one is also going to have some limitations
    on what backgrounds it can be used against since there can't be a inverted colour
    version.\r\n\r\nYou can have a grayscale version and maybe a semi transparent
    version instead of a full solid colour. That might work in colour as well, put
    the right side at 50% for example and then in red or something, then it will appear
    as it is two colours even if it's not, depending on the background. That might
    actually be kinda cool. Gonna try it and see how it looks.\r\n\r\nthanks, peter."

    that has worked fine for all the applications we've used it, even TV.\r\n\r\nThe
    client likes this version, might do some changes to the colour. Gonna think about
    the soft focus effect, it could be left out. Will try and print it too but as
    I said I've tried this before and the rock band logo prints fine so there's no
    reason for this not to."

  body: Don't get me wrong. I'm not talking about the symbol and the logo aspect of
    this "logo". I was talking about this colour distressed graphic manipulation that
    has much less to do with the logo than with presentation of it. A logo is a logo...
    Marketing material is marketing material.
