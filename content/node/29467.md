  body: "Thierry,\r\n\r\nI like it :) I appreciate the effect created by the \"y\",
    with a \"however\". \"Y\" commonly occurs on the ends of words, however for your
    typeface, you may have to tweak the kerning a little for those occasions where
    it appears in mid-word (see \"typeface\" and \"days\" in your example).\r\n\r\nLHerrou"
