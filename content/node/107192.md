  as part of my senior thesis, launched today. The website asks viewers a series of
  questions, and based on the answers, displays a list of typefaces that match the
  requirements/feel/use. \r\n\r\nI thought I'd reach out to other people interested
  interested in typography through this forum to promote the project (hopefully it
  is helpful to people looking for some new typefaces) and get some feedback and suggestions
  from anyone willing to share their thoughts!\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\nGabe Ferreira/Elijah

    to eventually monetize this service by charging a fee for inclusion in your database
    of annotated fonts?\r\n\r\nIf so, what is your legal arrangement with your college?\r\n\r\nI
    think that if you are going to publish this educational project online, you should
    include the full slate of web site links to \u201Cinfo\u201D the site, e.g. your
    quali\uFB01cations and typeface-analysis criteria, so that users have some idea
    of the credibility of your claimed-as-reputable suggestions, which to me is the
    real issue here, other than building a functioning site that performs the task
    of designing a UX that matches clicks with a database."

    body: "Hey Nick.\r\nWe don't intend to monetize the service. The idea is to make
      it available as a resource for anyone who needs a database of reliable typefaces
      to choose from for whatever project they are working on. There are several online
      articles describing what makes fonts good and set a criteria for \"reputable\",
      (a recent and rather lengthy one is this article from Jessica Hische's blog,
      for example: http://jessicahische.is/talkingtype) but we couldn't find a website
      that puts those guidelines to use by basically doing the \"filtering\" for whoever
      needs to browse some typefaces. People could use the built-in filtering technology
      from Adobe, Linotype, MyFonts, etc., but that can be very misleading as they
      offer several thousand fonts as opposed to the 140 on our website.\r\n\r\nI
      do like your idea of adding a section that describes our analysis criteria in
      case someone is wondering why a specific typeface made it to the list (thanks
      for the suggestion). Did you have any comments regarding the current selection
      of fonts?\r\n"

  body: "I like the sprightly question format!  \r\n\r\nYou can only ask so many questions
    if you want to keep it brisk.  But, would you consider an additional question
    that checks for special needs?  For example, is there a need for high legibility
    due to an audience of older readers (who might not have glasses handy), or very
    young readers?  Is there a language need?  The resulting recommended fonts seem
    to be mainstream with comprehensive glyph sets to satisfy many languages, but
    it could be a consideration.  \r\n\r\nGood luck with your project.  "

    body: "@twalsh1490\r\nThat's a good idea, thanks for sharing. I think a checklist
      at the last page (when all the chosen typefaces are displayed) would work well
      for that. People could further filter the selection by clicking on specific
      needs (multi-language support, readability, etc...). We'll look into implementing
      that!"
