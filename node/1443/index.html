<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>A Chairde, <br> <br>Weird and wonderful things have been going on in here: <br> <br><a href=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/16916.html?1064708452 target=_blank>http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/16916.html?1064708452</a> <br> <br>We've been discussing and debating and arguing about Steven Heller's fear of Fraktur. There's a bit of a whisper, now, of an open letter/ pamphlet to express our love for what he sees as "ominous" and "frightening" letterforms evoking "iron-fisted authority". <br> <br>Anyone interested in a collective <i>cri de coeur</i> set in Fraktur? <br> <br>Matha</div>

<div class=commentbody>Matha <br> <br>Heller has always seemed a pretty much a populist to me. Publishing crap on the latest trend. Why would he be concerned about fraktur!?! And why would we want him to populize it? Let's keep some of the good stuff to ourselves. Yes, Steven, should be very afraid. Nasty stuff that fraktur. Stay away, far far away. <br> <br>Gerald</div>

<div class=commentbody>> why would we want him to populize it? <br> <br>It's not that Heller is Obi-Wan/our_only_hope or something and we want him to endorse blackletter. We just want him to stop defaming it. It's hard enough to revalidate blackletter without a generally respected pundit stating it's beyond salvation. <br> <br>My own reason to want a revival of blackletter is a desire to enrich the typographic palette; I want to [eventually] see books set in blackletter. The roman is stagnating. <br> <br>I'm ready to write something up, but will only actually do it if we get like 10 or so others to commit, including some big names, like maybe Bain. Then we can put something powerful together and get all the magazines to run a story. The point shouldn't be to lambast Heller (it's not like it's all his fault), but we can use his stance as a prominent example of what people should reject. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Apologies to everyone for my late reply to this thread. This response uses styled text, so it's best when read on the typophile site and not in email. <br> <br>I own a copy of Heller and Fili's <i>Typology</i> and consider it a nice piece of work. It helped me to navigate all the subcurrents in modernism and what led up to them. It's got some great examples especially from the early part of the 20th century, including a few blackletter works. So you can imagine how frazzled I was when I read Heller's article. It's now two years old, so our responses are a little behind schedule, but it does need to be addressed. <br> <br>Heller's full article can be found <a href="http://designforum.aiga.org/content.cfm?contentalias=%5Fgetfullarticle%5F&aid=%22%2C%230%20%0A">here</a>. In it he writes: <br> <br><b>German Fraktur type (as opposed to other medieval gothics, such as Old English) still evokes iron-fisted authority. The words </div>

<div class=commentbody>Great post, John! <br> <br>> Fraktur was considered Romantic and feminine. <br> <br>Maybe this is a digression, but: <br>If you mean that historically most people thought fraktur was romantic (not sure about your capitalization) and feminine, I don't know enough to counter that. But to me "Antiqua" (or Roman, or whiteletter) is much more feminine; even though blackletter is narrower, its great angularity (especially in styles like textura) gives it an essentially masculine being. "Romantic" though I'd agree with. <br> <br>> chirogaphic blackletter design. <br> <br>Blackletter doesn't have to be chirographic. In fact I've noticed a tendency among blackletter revivalists to rely too much on chirography. That's basically swimming against the current, and it just makes it harder to dump the historical baggage. We need to distill blackletter into its structural, typographic essence. <br> <br>I have no doubt that blackletter needs reform to be revived as a text style (like by taming the caps), and the chirogaphic ghosts can be exorcised along with its archaic features in one fell swoop. And as much as spinning efforts (like getting Heller to back off) seem distasteful and/or tangential, they're really the fuel of such reform. <br> <br>(BTW, thanks for the warning about the styled text stuff - good netiquette.) <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody><i>There is a popular and strange impulse to expand blame for the Holocaust beyond the individuals who executed it and extend it to everything they saw, read, touched, drank, smoked, ate, discussed, thought about, no matter how incidental.</i> <br> <br>This is not a new impulse. During the Nurenberg trials, one of the American prosecutors drew attention to such impulses and warned against them, especially when they involved shifting responsibility for the holocaust onto those 'who had not done enough to prevent it' rather than those who actually did it.</div>

<div class=commentbody>During the "Old Europe" opposition to Gulf War II, I was at a park in Montrose (an Angloer-than-average area) and I overheard two moms talking politics. One of them ended up saying: "The Germans should talk! I mean, with what they <i>let happen</i>." Talk about a coping mechanism. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody><i>I bet he'd oblige if you agreed to be professional.</i> <br> <br>What profession are we talking about? Although Heller poses as a serious design historian and commentator, everything I've read by him suggests that he is simply a journalist. The Fraktur article is a case in point: extremist, poorly researched, emotional ('What typeface says "nigger"?'). Of course, most graphic design writing is journalistic, but type has often been blessed with a much higher level of scholarship. We have serious historians and commentators like Robin Kinross, Peter Bain, and Paul Shaw who have written knowledgeably about the modern history of blackletter, and whose books and articles are read by a small number of type afficionados, and then we get a journalist like Heller who writes an hysterical account of an entirely personal reaction to fraktur, which gets read by a thousands of AIGA members.</div>

<div class=commentbody><i>Mine is to create an atmosphere where people can use blackletter for projects without fear of being called anti-Jewish.</i> <br> <br>I suspect that the best way to do this is to start using blackletter types, but to do so in a strategic manner. Heller -- and presumably other non-experts -- is able to distinguish between German fraktur and 'other medieval gothics, such as Old English', even if his terminology is shaky. One of the great things about Peter Bain and Paul Shaw's publications is that they have begin to educate people about the incredible variety of blackletter types and writing styles, and the development of the style in countries other than Germany. This, coupled with some understanding of the history of the late Middle Ages, reverses the 'national identity' trend of the 20th century, and properly situates blackletter as an aspect of 'international gothic' culture, which flourished in western Europe immediately before the renaissance. Gerrit Noordzij's essays on the Burgundian style are another contribution to this fuller understanding of blackletter. <br> <br>This suggests to me that a parallel to this educational approach would be to start using blackletter types of French, Spanish, Italian, etc. origins and influence: types that undermine the identification of blackletter with Germany and hence, however erroneously, with National Socialism.</div>

<div class=commentbody>> why would anyone in their right mind do anything letterpress? <br> <br>Hey, you make a living at it! <br> <br>Anyway, I was reacting to John Butler's post right before mine. In fact I think a Fraktur revival might stand a better chance using offset. <br> <br>> whatever would be a "mainstream fraktur"? <br> <br>It's tricky ground, certainly. To me it means a face that combines curves and angles (the way the fraktur subclass of blackletter does so wonderfully), and uses the extender space much more richly than Roman (see the blackletter lc "h" for example), but with individual letters that have conventional structures - like none of that funky lc "y" stuff, and certainly caps that can be deciphered easily. <br> <br>BTW, I can be mainstream when it's for a greater good.

<div class=commentbody>Gerald, you have a point, but... <br> <br>John, I was talking specifically about the descender - blackletter "h"s of any category have it almost all the time. Look for example at pages 6-7 of Bain's book. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>More insight into Heller's Head: <br> <br>Recently he wrote a review of the book "Beirut's Memory" for Print magazine. It was fine, except for an innocent-seeming mini history of Lebanon that reeked of political propaganda (at least to somebody with a nose sensitive to that), buttressing the distortions of the powers that be. I wrote a reply, and it made it into the current issue: <br> <br>" <br>I was delighted to see coverage of the book "Beirut's Memory" in the <br>July/August issue ["Double Exposure," p. 98]. Sadly, this delight was <br>matched by disquiet in reading Heller's encapsulation of Lebanon's 17- <br>year civil war. Living that war as a non-Arab Christian in largely Muslim <br>West Beirut, I learned to glean the true motivations and mechanics of <br>political propaganda. Even if I suppress my tendency to assume the <br>worst, I have to note that virtually every single clause in Heller's history <br>seems strongly skewed to validate the American perspective, if not <br>U.S. foreign policy per se. This does not help. <br> <br> I'm sorry that my first letter ever to PRINT isn't strongly related to <br>design, except perhaps in this way: Graphic designers seem to have <br>developed a burning desire to be politically relevant, but the degree <br>to which they can avoid being manipulated depends most of all on <br>their political sophistication. <br>" <br> <br>They did however make two [telling] edits: <br>1) "Heller's history" originally had both in capitals. <br>2) I used "zeitgeist" (a carefully loaded term), not "perspective". <br> <br>To the credit of Print though, they didn't allow the use of my letter as as excuse for more spin. That's what almost stopped me from sending it in: the fear that it would be capped by a "carification" from Heller... <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>There he goes again!! <br>Now that the System is after Iran for real*, Heller is ramping up the rhetoric towards his [self-]assigned demographic: soft-headed designers. In the current issue of Eye magazine** there's an interview with a young Iranian woman (living in Europe since age 14) who has put out an interesting comic book about her childhood during the Islamic Revolution. Any ambivalence in the interviewee is quickly redirected (carefully read the <i>questions</i>, more than the answers) towards a tacit condemnation of The Enemy... Who needs subtlety when your audience has the political sensitivity of an earth newt? <br> <br>* <a href=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3341233.stm target=_blank>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3341233.stm</a> <br> <br>** An otherwise stellar issue - a typographic gold mine, this one. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I think there is a consideration to be made. I investigated the fascination I myself had with the Blackletter, in subsequent times, and I felt it was difficult to completely separate it from Nazism. Even a pretty childish old idea for some type designs of mine was related to it. <br> <br>I feel like there is a general perception of it associating it with Nazism, which keeps going on, independently from what bad journalism (which here in Italy is the majority) may be pushed to sensationalize. <br> <br>So Heller may be annoying to accultured designers, but my own doubt is he may reflect a feeling to which a large portion of people keep clung to: something along the lines of "Adolf Hitler was not a human being" or so. <br> <br>In this way my fear is it would effectively be very hard to "undemonize" Blackletter, as much as it is hard to "undemonize" the figure of Adolf Hitler or treat Nazism with more historical fairness. <br> <br>The fact is that Blackletter seems to be in many ways a "dead type style", in the sense Ancient Greek or Latin are "dead languages". So, as you try to make it live in modern context, you are prevented by many obstacles. <br>How many times I'd have wished to use it for food packaging. But they would never allow me to do so. <br> <br>What do you think?</div>
