    \ Look: deep down inside, you KNOW why Monotype Grotesque Expanded sings to you.
    Something about it makes you FEEL good.\r\n\r\nCheck out a lot of serif fonts;
    if one makes you FEEL the same way, then that's your OTHER baby. You really DON\u2019T
    need other people to rationalize your behavior. OTOH, if a suggestion works and
    you FEEL that it's the right thing to do, do it.\r\n\r\nThis concludes today\u2019s
    Daily Sermonette on Doing the Right Thing. Dammit."
