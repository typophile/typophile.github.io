  body: "Erin, I was just in your fair city last week -- got out the day of the ice
    storms. The power's back on, apparently... ;)\r\n\r\nI'm also a magazine art director,
    and I've been looking for an excuse to use a few of these faces:\r\n\r\n  Whitman
    (although the lack of a bold italic is a serious deterrent):\r\n  http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/whitman/\r\n\r\n
    \ Prensa\r\n  http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/prensa\r\n\r\n  Farnham\r\n  http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Farnham\r\n\r\n\r\nWe're
    about to launch a new magazine that uses Mercury as its body copy:\r\n\r\n  http://www.typography.com/catalog/mercurytext/index.html\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother
    recent launch used Mark Simonson's Kandal:\r\n\r\n  http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/kandal.html\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd
    I'm always checking on offerings from ShinnType, OurType, and Fontshop, among
    others:\r\n\r\n  Goodchild (ShinnType)\r\n  http://www.shinntype.com/\r\n\r\n
    \ Arnhem (OurType -- looks delicious!)\r\n  http://www.ourtype.be/\r\n\r\n  FF
    Eureka (FontFont -- would be sly choice)\r\n  http://www.fontshop.com"

    why not head on over to StormType and see what they have to offer. Lots of good
    stuff there."
