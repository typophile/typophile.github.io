  for quite a while for letters like this and wasn't able to find anything.\r\n\r\nTo
  what genre does this belong? Does anyone knows fonts that look like this?\r\n\r\nI
  have never been an active member of this site until now, but I've been visiting
  Typophile for more than a year and I can say this community is truly amazing!\r\n\r\nThanks

    Tuscan, the C is similar to an old late-1800s ATF face named Concave, and the
    serifs on the S don''t match those of either of the other letters (besides which,
    the two serifs don''t even match each other)...'
