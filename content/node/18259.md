body: I'm looking for examples of Highlander in use. I quite like the typeface, and
  would like som ideas and examples. I think it can easily look a bit to childish
  and "hobbit"-ish. Can anyone help me?

  body: It is a nice typeface, and one that I haven't seen used all that much. Maybe
    you can track the designer, and see if he/she has a personal website that may
    have some examples?
