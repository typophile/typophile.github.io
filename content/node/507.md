    I mean the font, not most uses of it. <BR> <BR>Unfortunately, it&#39;s become
    so commonplace and so accessible that it&#39;s very often ruthlessly abused by
    unskilled hands. <BR> <BR>Computers have aided and abetted this trend, but it
    was true even before the days of desktop publishing. Helvetica began suffering
    its vicious cycle of abuse in the &#39;60s and &#39;70s, as &#34;generic&#34;
    became a trendy design thing. <BR> <BR>In my opinion, Helvetica &#40;whether the
    original or the &#34;Neue&#34; series&#41; is at its most beautiful when used
    as a display font &#40;perhaps the way some woodcut faces would be used&#41;,
    taking advantage of its range of weights and widths as well as its graceful and
    more subtle shapes. It should be incorporated into the design, rather than simply
    plastered mercilessly across a page like so much eggshell latex semi-gloss paint.
    The IRS and Adobe Acrobat will spend decades in Purgatory for their crimes against
    Helvetica. <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t malign the font just because 99% of its users are
    abusing it. Hasn&#39;t it been through enough pain? After all, this plain &#34;generic&#34;
    font became as popular as it is &#40;before computers&#41; for a reason. <BR>
    <BR>Arial can&#39;t claim this. It was hacked out, mass-marketed and force-fed
    to hapless computer consumers. <BR> <BR>A few moments spent flipping through any
    preferred design annual or an issue of &#34;Graphis&#34; proves how stunningly
    Helvetica can be used, in the right hands. <BR> <BR>David <BR>&#40;Helvetica sympathizer&#41; '

    years back. I thought it was <I>Critique</I> -- but I couldn&#39;t find the article
    in my collection, so perhaps it was another.  <BR> <BR>If I remember correctly,
    the magazine asked several designers to revamp a logo or a design. Zuzana was
    asked to update Helvetica. In her response, I think she said that she didn&#39;t
    feel that Helvetica should be redesigned, but that it could benefit from a true
    italic and so that&#39;s what she contributed. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think the
    project was ever meant as anything more than an exercise. <BR> <BR>-- Kent.

    of it. it even goes further then the fact that it is just a great all around face.
    it&#39;s popularity stems from the fact that postmodernism has eaten itself alive
    and returned to it&#39;s roots in modernism. the modernist aesthetic is alive
    and kicking again because of postmodernism. how ironic it is but then again it
    can be expected from a movement as ironic as postmodernism. because helvetica
    rose to the forefront of the modernist movement it has become a shoe in as far
    as the retro mimicry of postmodernism is concerned. but it&#39;s the fact that
    it is such a great face that people have fallen in love with it again.

    i don&#39;t really put helvetica into that same category as avant garde. i think
    avant garde is more of a display than anything else. you could never set copy
    in it. univers on the other hand is just not a very handsome face. i&#39;ve seen
    many of my contemporaries at art center come over to the darkside on the univers/helvetica
    issue. univers is just too organic in it&#39;s letterforms. i&#39;d rather use
    akzidenz or even frutiger over univers. helvetica is more ridged than universe
    that&#39;s obvious but why use a half breed face like universe that doesn&#39;t
    do a good job of being either geometric or humanist.

    moderate amounts of copy here e.g. annual reports. as far as helvetica as a display
    it&#39;s one of the better faces out there. it is much closer to being geometric,
    which make it a shoe in for display. that&#39;s why you see so much of it in use
    as display. this argument is getting very boring for me by now. i&#39;d rather

  body: the other thing that needs to be understood here keith is that i started my
    career being as naive as the next guy that posts here. i was only concerned with
    hip/cool. i then moved into the educated and conservative idealism of a type snob
    &#40;much like hrant&#41;. but as a true postmodernist, i am now in a phase of
    rebirth and am moving back over to the other side. it&#39;s just not that fun
    being a typographic stick in the mud all the time. you have to have some fun.

  body: 'No matter what we do we&#39;re living in a post-modern world. The beauty
    of it is we agree on disagreeing. No matter how &#39;Modernist&#39; a piece of
    work might be, we won&#39;t be seeing it under the same light as our predecessors,
    because our world is not the same any more. So, a so-called &#39;Modernist&#39;
    piece of design is simply a &#39;style&#39; we pick from the &#39;big closet&#39;
    in order to sell something to a particular group of &#39;target audience&#39;,
    who happen to be hip and cool and trendy yuppies. The same goes for &#39;traditionalist&#39;
    designs. <BR> <BR>I think we not only live in a post-modern world, we also live
    in a multicultural world &#40;at least in this part of the world&#41;. That even
    renders so-called &#39;movements&#39; like Post-modernism and/or Modernism at
    best redundant, or at worst, meaningless. It&#39;s time to lose the &#39;isms&#39;
    and focus more on what we are supposed to do: to communicate visually. As long
    as we keep our goal in mind, and to continue to be passionate about what it is
    that we&#39;re doing, then we&#39;ll be alright. <BR> <BR>I have two opposing
    views about typography: one of which is that typography is first and foremost
    about communicating the textual content as efficiently as possible; the other
    is utilizing the semantics of type to give design work particular &#39;atmospheres&#39;
    or emotional responses. The first one is based on linguistic requirements and
    it&#39;s what &#39;traditional&#39; &#40;book&#41; typography was &#40;is&#41;
    all about. The latter is based on visual requirements, which is what graphic design
    is about, mostly. Of course, these two views are not mutually exclusive and it
    is up to us to strike a balance between the two.'

    no design education should cost that much. design is cheap an education in it

    But it wouldn&#39;t have offered me the education I would have wanted. Great education
    is only the sum of its parts, ergo great students and great teachers. I sincerely
    believe this. Students have to be absorbing, Teachers have to be imparting good/correct

    &#43; Good Teachers = Good Education.  <BR> <BR>How much trouble will this get

    is out of whack. Way out of whack. <BR> <BR>And another thing, Jay, it isn&#39;t

    at state school &#40;for some  <BR>tiny fraction of the cost&#41;, many of my
    instructors were  <BR>teaching simultaneously at well-renowned design  <BR>schools,
    including Art Center. of those who were not,  <BR>quite a few were picked up by
    these schools as  <BR>full-time faculty at a later date. <BR> <BR>a major problem,

    good for the individual. you must understand i&#39;m not arguing this. you might
    be into some strange cult that worships a donkey so then it would make sense that
    a program that offered graphic design and donkey worship might be best for you.
    it wouldn&#39;t matter that the program might be bottom of the barrel and backwards
    but it&#39;s what the individual thinks is best for themselves. what i&#39;m saying
    is that&#39;s not the case. there is truth to generalities. the type of generalities
    that say for instance that art center is one of the best schools in the world.
    without this there is no way you can even come into a forum like this and discus
    anything subjective let alone type. i just don&#39;t jive with that sort of thinking.
    there is a point to human classification and rankings. that is why they exist.
    that is why we are here talking about such topics as typography. <BR> <BR>i agree
    with you on the art vs. design thing. i don&#39;t really want to open that one
    up. my point is though that we are talking about something that is highly subjective
    and in the area of craft boarders on art. i think we all know it will never be.
    but it is most certainly not science. <BR> <BR>i&#39;m glad i gave you the form
    to spout off about these things though. i think they are important because as
    soon as you start saying institutions like art center have no merit you discredit
    any of these topics that we are talking about. they all survive on the same ideals.

    for that very reason. Mr. Anonymous, Jay is simply voicing his opinion. He just
    keeps forgetting to state it that way. Right, Jay? ;^&#41; <BR> <BR>If we are
    generalizing, ok, Art Center is one of the best .... but, my point is that we
    shouldn&#39;t generalize. Nor should we make blanket statements that only hold
    up when intensely starched. That would be like saying all designers that appreicate
    pretty colors and strict typographic rules should work for Martha Stewart and
    anyone that has a penchant for carving letters into there skin should work for
    Sagmeister. I see what you are saying, do you see what I am saying? If your donkey

    -- that is good -- subjectivity is everywhere and we can&#39;t help that, but

    subjectivity that is getting in the way.

  body: 'Jay, I hope you realize how patient and polite I&#39;ve been with you, for
    all your pointless arguments and name-calling. <BR> <BR>Typography is not totally
    subjective. There is some science in it. Some conclusions were drawn from empirical
    research, not just subjectivity, especially when it comes to legibility. Though
    they are not always so dependable. <BR> <BR>Regarding schools, I think Tiffany
    pretty much said what I wanted to say. The school I went to, Emily Carr Institute
    in Vancouver, is arguably the top art school in Canada. They have a reputation
    of being &#39;arty-farty&#39; and really have an attitude. It is probably the
    coolest school to be in Canada right now. That to me is a problem. People want
    to go there because it is cool, not because they want to learn. I was doing a
    project for a client last month and he told me &#39;to go crazy with it&#39;...
    &#39;you&#39;re from Emily Carr, man!&#39;. How do you think I felt then? I don&#39;t
    want to be streotyped, and I think I have my own agenda of being a designer. To
    me, bad teachers are the ones who spoon-feed their students and hope that they&#39;ll
    turn their students into exact copies of themselves. On the other hand, good teachers
    give students access to differing opinions and let them think for themselves,
    and ultimately making them good designers in their own rights. It is a teacher&#39;s
    job to let them think for themselves: what is good design? What is design even?
    Whatever that might be. The job of the teacher is to provide guidance in order
    to help them to fulfill their own personal goals. The least a teacher could do
    is to embrace the difference of his/her students.'

  body: tiffany you are always a pleasant voice of reason. believe it or not though
    i don&#39;t quite agree with you on the whole generalization issue. like i said
    before i think we under value generalizations in today&#39;s culture because they
    aren&#39;t p.c.. current postmodern thought dictates that we shouldn&#39;t be
    hasty and that we should step back and analyze every possibility until we are
    impotent to make a decision. i think this is a horrible way to approach things.
    though it may be too much for some of you to hear, i think generalizations are
    very valuable. general consensus becomes cultural fact. it doesn&#39;t matter
    if it is scientifically true or not it is true to the culture and that is what
    matters at the moment. this can be illustrated by the culture of of the 1950&#39;s
    when maybe 90%, or so, of america believed that god actually was real. it did
    not matter that science would make major movements to over throw this idea &#40;or
    at the very least drastically alter it&#41; latter on changing the reality of
    culture. if you were alive in the 1950&#39;s it was indisputable fact that god
    was real. i&#39;m not naive enough to say that generalizations are always true
    though a lot of the time they are. i&#39;m just a realist who says they are the
    truth at the moment as far as you and i are concerned and that&#39;s all that
    really matters. i think we are all tired of hearing that one exception to a generalization
    as though it changes the truth of that generalization e.g. all black labs are
    black &#40;generalization&#41; but my cousin has a black lab that is albino &#40;exception&#41;
    so not all black labs are black. this just gets stupid because the fact still
    remains that 99.9% of black labs are black. there is always an exception to any
    generalization but that does not make the generalization false. that is the beauty
    of the generalization, they are flexible. granted you are right too but i think
    you are to quick to dismiss a generalization because of a weak exception. <BR>
    <BR>as far as the donkey thing goes you&#39;re reading too much into it. i&#39;m
    only using it as a surface level example. and i&#39;m not sure i understand your
    last comment, so please expound. <BR> <BR>anonymous, just because your a huge
    wimp doesn&#39;t mean i forgot about you. what kind of wuss makes a post as anonymous
    and asks me my credentials. you won&#39;t even list your name. i&#39;m surprised
    you even know what art center is but the fact that you do says it all. let&#39;s
    see what you have to say about any issues here and then we&#39;ll talk credentials.
    <BR> <BR>and hrant. i don&#39;t really think you can be that lost its all pretty
    simple. just take off your rose colored glasses of idealism and look at the reality

  body: keith, i&#39;m offended that you would call our arguments pointless and i&#39;m
    not sure where you got the idea that i was calling you names. i think you might
    have misread my honesty as an insult. it&#39;s not. as a matter of fact i quite
    respect your opinions, i may think they are timid and unrealistic but i still
    respect them. i even respect hrants opinions because though he has no idea i do
    in fact know exactly where he is coming from. he is the one you should really
    be afraid of. back to the topic at hand, the funny thing is that i&#39;m an idealist
    about type like you are but i am much more of a realist than an idealist. i think
    most of you are caught up, way too much, in a type of egotistical idealism. you
    may think i am an egotistical maniac but i am in fact less of one then you would
    ever know. i just enjoy bringing people back down to earth. you should look at
    my comments as a humorous breath of fresh air &#60;joke&#62;. <BR> <BR>it&#39;s
    funny how much you guys get all up in arms about the art center thing. it makes
    me laugh. it just shows how impressive of a school it is. you would have no idea
    but i actually like talking to people who have no idea what it is because they
    have no need to try and prove anything. you guys are a sorry lot.

    Art Center for grad school. It looked like a great place to be in. It&#39;s just
    way too out of budget for me: it was $9,000 per semester when I looked a few years
    ago. Times it by six &#40;was it six semesters in total?&#41; and it&#39;s $54,000

    you... <BR> <BR>The most important thing in any educational situation is not the
    quality of the school, or of the teachers, or of the resources, and it certainly
    isn&#39;t the price. <BR>The single most important influence on the value of an
    educational experience is the student. This is why jw seems to have learnt so
    little at such an expensive school. His immaturity, combined with his awe for
    expensive things has resulted in very poor value from his &#40;or someone&#39;s&#41;
    educational spending. <BR> <BR>I have no idea if art center offer any scholarships,
    or if a proportion of students there are funded through any means other than private
    wealth, but if all or most of the students are paying their own fees, then it
    seems to me that art center would suffer from limiting its constituency to the
    wealthy, which is always a recipe for declining standards.  <BR> <BR>jw, I think
    you upset people because almost as soon as you arrive hereyou namedrop the art
    center into the conversation, then demonstrate that you have very little understanding,
    but you put your views forcefully and with personal insults attached. <BR> <BR>It
    may appear to many of the designers here &#40;who may have had to really struggle

    you have said here but let me paraphrase. great institutions like art center attract
    great teachers but great teachers don&#39;t always make great students. it makes
    me laugh to see individuals like you violently react to posts that are just out
    rightly honest about these or any other issues. you don&#39;t seem to take things
    well yourself. if you&#39;d just sit back drop some of your own internal ego struggles
    you might be able to see what i&#39;m saying in most of these posts. no where
    have i said i&#39;m better than anyone else here. you are just reading these things
    into it because my guess is that you are having internal struggles with you own
    ego and out right honesty is hard to swallow. as far as name dropping goes...
    whatever, if someone went to art center they went to art center, get over it.
    i don&#39;t hold this up as a way of saying i&#39;m better i&#39;ve just said
    i can attest to the fact that it&#39;s a great school with great instructors.

    <BR> <BR>&#34;as soon as you start saying institutions like art center  <BR>have
    no merit you discredit any of these topics that we  <BR>are talking about. they
    all survive on the same ideals.&#34; <BR> <BR>quite a claim! would you mind elaborating?
    as it stands,  <BR>I would say your &#42;realism&#42; has turned to shear folly.
    <BR> <BR>&#34;general consensus becomes cultural fact. it doesn&#39;t  <BR>matter
    if it is scientifically true or not it is true to the  <BR>culture and that is
    what matters at the moment.&#34;  <BR> <BR>general consensus never _becomes_ fact
    -- it either is  <BR>or is not. for instance &#40;in an effort to stay on track&#41;,
    if a  <BR>more readable alphabet falls into disuse and the  <BR>average reader
    no longer recognizes it, it is no less  <BR>intrinsically readable, it has simply
    been [possibly] lost. <BR> <BR>&#34;this can be illustrated by the culture of
    of the 1950&#39;s  <BR>when maybe 90%, or so, of america believed that god  <BR>actually
    was real. it did not matter that science would  <BR>make major movements to over
    throw this idea &#40;or at  <BR>the very least drastically alter it&#41; latter
    on changing the  <BR>reality of culture.&#34; <BR> <BR>actually science gave their
    utmost efforts to  <BR>overthrowing the idea only to come to the conclusion  <BR>that
    there must be some supreme being. <BR> <BR>&#34;i&#39;m just a realist who says
    they are the truth at the  <BR>moment as far as you and i are concerned and that&#39;s
    all  <BR>that really matters.&#34; <BR> <BR>actually, I would say you&#39;re more
    of a cultural relativist.  <BR>for one, a realist wouldn&#39;t go on for this

  body: gerald, this has been discussed in the past as well. as far as pay for teachers
    is concerned i think that has little to do with why instructors choose to work
    for an institution like art center. pay scale is not very relevant to the merit
    of the institution. you yourself are teaching their and probably enjoy a certain
    amount respect that comes with being an instructor at art center. like i said
    before, art center draws great instructors because of this. i know there are exceptions
    and i don&#39;t think we need to hear the few that exist e.g. some so so instructor
    in room 135 is really pretty bad. we all know those exist in any institution but
    it still does not dispute the fact that this is one of the best design schools.
    as far as &#34;the greats of their time&#34; i do in fact think many are and so
    do others. professors like doyald young, for example, are masters of their craft
    and art center is a haven for these types of individuals.

    pox, technically known as IWC, Infatuation With  Coolness. In most cases it does

    it becomes a terminal illness. The danger signs are a combination of arrogance
    and cluelessness. While this still is not enough for a definite diagnosis, you
    should act immediately. If it progresses to the point where the subject thinks
    that it&#39;s cool to avoid capital letters, it may be too late. Teachers take

    coke for three days and haven&#39;t washed my hair look.&#34;  along with hand
    written type that looks scratchy and ununiform.  i know that that is a sweet look
    to go for and everything and that whole subculture of non-druggies trying to look

  body: ethen, in reply to your other post which i neglected to see initially. you
    bring up an age old question here &#60;joke&#62;. design and style are very interrelated.
    i know many here would tell you that you should pay no attention to trend and
    just follow the standards that have been passed down for years &#40;which were
    in fact just trends at some point themselves&#41; but i think this is unrealistic.
    your job as a designer is to provide a service to your client. in many cases but
    not all that can be to zig instead of zag. this is an attempt to help them stand
    out. as far as the trend you are sighting, it really depends on how large it is
    and how entrenched your client is or should be in relation to it. weather to follow
    a trend or forge a new trend is very dependent on this issue. that being said
    there is also the element of the designers personal voice. i think this is important
    too. you need to love what you do and clients in the end will love you because
    of it. nobody likes a zombie robot that produces something with no soul. anyway
    i guess that&#39;s a good enough start on such a huge topic.

  body: 'What a great discussion! Sorry to have been travelling. First of all, a little
    historical perspective -- I was there, boots on the ground &#40;joke&#41;, when
    Neue Haas Grotesk was introduced. I thought it was heaven-sent. The only guy setting
    it in the US soon thereafter was Roy Rothstein of Type&amp; Art in Cleveland.
    Up until then the only decent sans serif we had was News Gothic. In Europe there
    was Akzidenz Grotesk. I simplify but only because there&#39;s enough text posted
    here already. When my 25-year hitch with Polaroid ended and they decided to do
    all the design in-house, converting everything to Helvetica, my parting shot was
    &#34;Congratulations, your typeface can be seen on every airport toilet throughout
    the free world.&#34;  <BR> <BR>Even so, Helvetica is a usable face, Avante Garde
    an abomination. It simply can&#39;t be read. NHG when set by the Swiss was eminently
    readable in at least three languages.  <BR> <BR>Thirdly, there is a difference
    between being educated and learning. My late Mass. Art schoolmate and friend,
    Jacqueline Casey, blossomed as a great designer at MIT in spite of a ho-hum curriculum.
    The same can be said of her colleague, Muriel Cooper. I think it&#39;s all about
    intellectual curiosity, and if one doesn&#39;t have it, it doesn&#39;t matter
    where he or she has been &#34;educated.&#34; '

    you in the nose. I happen to be a New Media Designer (which I agree is a strange
    title) but you have to admit it's much easier to say than mutidisciplinary proponent
    of aesthetics specializing in the application of current and emerging methods
    of application. Did you ever stop to think that the reason NMD's use helvetica
    so much is because they are getting paid to do so. I'm sorry but I have to quote
    snoop dogg when I say \"Don't hate the player hate the game.\" I also am a bit
    miffed about the over saturation of the media and over use of certian techniques
    but you have to remember that these old washed up art directors are looking for
    those \"catch phrase\" designers to do something \"hip\" and \"new\" but then
    force them to copy eachother. I'd have to say that if you want to gripe talk to
    the old farts who still use Quark and lay everything out in sabon about loosening
    the reigns and letting us go to town. I promise you I would never use Helvetica
    again if I could make the same money using cabinet, or eiko, or damske, or Chola,

    in Helvetica on screen as it would be even less legible than it's printed counterpart.
    Reading off the screen is a bitch full stop - why make it more painful?\r\n\r\nHelvetica
    Neue is a useful display face. For people like myself it's a great way to get
    into display typography because it has so many different weights and variants.
    If you're ten years older than me you'll hate it because it was old hat when you
    were a young designer."

  body: "What I like about Helvetica these days is its blandness. I a design surrounding
    where Kievit, Thesis et al have become the new Helvetica in their everyday use,
    I think a relatively underdesigned font such as Helvetica has a certain simplistic
    flair, a stupidness for lack of better words, that just works. Same goes, to a
    lesser degree, for DIN, for Courier and for some other fonts. Absurdely,  feel
    the same way about Garamond these days. Grossly overused, I find myself using
    it more and more often, because it IS so commonplace. Much as I love well-done
    typophile fonts and always hunt for notoverused serif and sans-serif typefaces,
    I find myself coming back to Helvetica (or similar-looking fonts such as FFBau,
    Galaxie Polaris or RKW Sans, which is a remix of Helvetica BQ we did with URW++)
    and Garamond again and again. I recently did a book-design and used Franklin for
    that, a font I haven't touched in well over a decade. But its crude mixture (in
    my mind) of simplicity and america-advertising-noise aswell as a certain Kalmanesque
    feeling made it the only viable option. Sometimes the wrong font is really the
    only right choice. Maybe I'm just tired of the delicateness of all these new,
    well-done typefaces and look for something clumsy and plain and stupid and honest?

  body: "PS: \r\nAs an example, I work on flyers, a brochure and a flash-based Site
    for suchthilfe.direkt, a local drug-aid and habilitation center. My idea is that,
    well, drugs and their usage is overdramatized in the media. I didn't want to show
    junkies and opted instead for something that struck me during the days of research
    and photoshooting in their facilities: It's mostly a very efficient, very bureaucratic
    job they do. The whole streetworker-clich\xE9 I had in mind just doesn't hold
    true, they're justr professionals doing their best in their field. It's all pretty
    banal, it LOOKS and FEELS banal. And that, imo, was good. \r\nSo we took very
    very nondescript photos, very downscale, very everyday. I wanted to emphasize
    that drug-abuse and thus drug-aid is normal, is mundane, is a job like everything
    else. Instead of showing the fear-inducing imagery of other campaingns, I opt
    for, more or less... a kind of down-to-earthiness :-D\r\n\r\nAnd damn, I spent
    WEEKS deciding on the design and the typeface. Frustrating, annoyinbg weeks. It
    all still felt too much like advertising, it pushed up too many emotions, it jst
    did not feel cool enough, bland enough, simple enough. \r\n\r\nThe final design
    is as simple as can be and the typeface, of all the choices available, is UNIVERS.
    definitively not a typeface I use often these days. Univers... simple, honest,
    straightforward. No real ligatures, no OSFs, no Caps, overused and still kind
    of the ugly girl at the dance party. And it fit perfectly. \r\n\r\nAnd it's quite
    often the same with Helvetica. The bad font is sometimes the only viable option.
