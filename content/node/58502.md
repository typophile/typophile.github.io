  trying to find this font, it looks like a revival of Thermo from ATF. Until I saw
  this, I didn't think there was a digital version. As you can see, I am only 5 letters
  shy of a complete uppercase. (Missing J, Q, V, X, Z.)\r\n\r\nI found this, but the
  rough edges don't work for me.\r\nhttp://www.archivetype.com/Latest/Archive-Thermo-Announcement.html\r\n\r\nThe
  attached letters come from a piece of art, so there is a possibility that the artist
  custom-created them. (The artist is unavailable to ask directly.) I'm hoping htere
  is a commercial font out there.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your help!\r\n\r\n~Sean"

    is the C, G, and the M and N. Are you sure this is ATF Thermotype? If this is
    an 'interpretation' then they took a lot of liberties with the original.\r\n\r\nA
    similar font that does exist in digital form is [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/hollywood-deco-sg/|Hollywood
    Deco]] (also an ATF typeface, from 1932, a year after Thermotype).\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: "I'm not sure of anything, actually. The one other bit of info I have points
    to this font possibly being named \"Thermo 300\". The designer working with the
    file that has these letters outlined says Illustrator asks for \"Thermo 300\"
    every time she opens it.\r\n\r\nThanks for the Hollywood Deco link, it is close
    but not quite it."
