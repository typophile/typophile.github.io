  a good general graphic design forum I'd love to hear about it.\r\n\r\nOur design
  firm is looking for a Canadian food packaging regulations consultant?\r\nWe need
  to find a consultant or firm that can help us make sure our frozen pizza packaging
  label meets Canadian regulations. The food product is manufactured in the USA and
  will be imported to Canada.\r\n\r\nI'd really appreciate it if someone could point
  me in the right direction."

    their job (and my tax dollars!) to provide that sort of service....  ;-)

  body: "And the third one contained the easiest solution: it's not like this process
    is particularly difficult, or even expensive, actually, since CFIA (Canadian Food
    Inspection Agency) requirements aren't nearly as anal as the FDA.\r\n\r\nSo long
    as there's the appropriate French content (one stick-on label), and the Canadian-specific
    nutrition information (another stick-on label), the American outgoing requirements
    are more intricate.  \r\n\r\n<em>La gouvernement yanqui</em> wants to know what
    you're shipping out of your country considerably more than ours cares about what
    you're shipping in....\r\n\r\nIt ain't rocket surgery!"

    to the general populace.  Wish our gummint subscribed to writing everything in

  body: Does anyone here that lives in Canada have any frozen pizza packaging in their
    fridge that they could take a few pics of? Or any other kind of bilingual food
    packaging. That would be very helpful. I'm very curious to see if French always
    comes before English on packaging panels in which both languages are together
    rather than on separate facings. Thanks.
