body: I need a font to paint on a wall. It needs to look like Persian, but be subtle
  and readable -- with a bit of study -- in English.  I will try to pass it off as
  a Tolkien, rune, or elven script. I would appreciate any suggestions or even break-through
  right-on insights.

  body: So far, I'm going with Midjungards, which will do, but it hasn't the arcane
    look for which I am seeking.  If I paint it loosely, adding a diamond between
    words to enclose space rather more evenly and bring the weight of words together,
    it might serve the purpose.  I may even add a bar across the top of certain letter
    combinations to introduce a dash of the Persian script, or, being daring, add
    a bar across the bottom with certain combinations to resemble god-knows what?  Increased
    complication?  Any comments?

  body: Sounds interesting but you need to upload some pictures. Right now I can't
    really imagine how it will look like.
