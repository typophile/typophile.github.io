body: "I'm trying to identify a font used in the body text of Les Mis\xE9rables I
  by Victor Hugo, from a \"folio classique\", Edition d'Yves Gohin, ISBN 2-07-040922-8,
  copyrighted 1973 and 1995.\r\n\r\nThe most unique thing about this font is the italic
  \"f\", which has a slightly curved, almost straight edge on the bottom. This characteristic
  alone eliminates most famous serif fonts, I think. Also, the italic \"b\", \"\"d\",
  \"l\" letters begin from the top with a curved, tapered hook. The italic \"z\" resembles
  the Times, as well as the italic \"v\"."
