    is Chicago \xA9 with a 10 degree slope.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ChicagoSloped10degInUse_5433.jpg]\r\nChicago

    as a general suggestion to all posters and not meant to be a criticism of you.
    You edited out the link, which all that any of us can do in these cases.\r\nCheers.\r\nDon"
