body: "Hi there, \r\n\r\nI've been asked to use this typeface but have had trouble
  identifying it, hence posting it here of course. The 'a' and 'e' are most distinctive
  so hoping that someone recognises those elements. Unfortunately I don't have a great
  deal of letters to go on apart from those in attached image. Any help is most appreciated.
  \r\n\r\nThanks in advance and kind regards,,\r\n\r\nPaul\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/whichfont_6533.jpg]"
