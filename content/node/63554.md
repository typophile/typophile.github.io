body: "Hello all,\r\nAre italics acceptable for body copy?\r\nI generally think they're
  much better looking than their roman counterparts, as well as being more economical
  to set, and this sounds like good enough reason to use an italic.\r\nSo, is it acceptable
  to use them for body copy, and if so, what do you use to indicate book titles and/or
  quotations? <em>eg</em> In an article in <em>eye Magazine</em>... or On the topic

  body: "I think what you guys are saying is true on a historical level, but you have
    to know you are really moving against the grain if you are using italics for large
    portions of body text. Many studies indicate that readability has to do with training,
    so for instance even though sans-serifs have a slightly easier definable shape,
    most people still find serif-fonts faster to read in large quanta. It's like with
    music and a lot of other things - you don't have to follow all the defined rules,
    but you have to know that you achieve a certain effect if you break them. If you
    set body text in italic, you probably will get a certain reaction (either conscious
    or subconscious) in the readers.\r\n\r\nOf course you will use roman to indicate
    book titles - as you do in for instance image captions where italic is the \"normal\"
    text."

  body: "I have to agree with hassebasse, typographic conventions are established
    regardless of where they historically originated.\r\n\r\nPersonally I use the
    Economist book of style to sort out arguments (you don't have to go by it, but
    it helps to have a guide, why constantly re-invent the wheel?). When working with
    an experienced editor, I'm always willing to debate, but in the end these things
    can be an editorial decision.\r\n\r\nI've just recently been dealing with a case
    where italics are used, I believe, inappropriately ([[http://www.garrettreil.ie/about-the-design-research-project.php
    | on our road signs here in Ireland]]). One of my arguments against this (beyond
    the legibility concerns!) is that conventionally italics are used to indicate
    a foreign language phrase, so using it for our native language demeans it in relation
    to English.\r\n\r\nLike any rule, it just requires a full and thoughtful understanding,
    before you set about breaking it. \r\n\r\nGarrett Reil\r\nhttp://raindesign.com\r\nhttp://garrettreil.ie\r\n"

    a reminder: lowercase letters originated as standalone designs, and we are long
    accustomed to using them together with caps.  :-)\r\n\r\nAndreas"

  body: "<em>\"you are really moving against the grain if you are using italics for
    large portions of body text.\"</em>\r\n\r\nGoing against the grain isn't inherently
    a bad thing! Forbidden is nothing. Make decisions with care, and think about what
    they imply/cause. \r\nFor instance, from what I understand, italics tend to slow
    down reading speed. And then of course, they tend to have a different flavor than
    the Roman, hence giving the text a different tone. Do you want these things? Do
    you need them? Observe carefully.\r\n\r\nAlso: This whole question depends a lot
    on the design of the Italic at hand. That's one reason why I personally favor
    somewhat \"subdued\"/subtly differentiated italics with structures closer to slanted-romans
    \u2013 they're easier to use for stretches of text too if you need that; and when
    they're well-designed, they work just as well for emphasis. A classically chiro-\"swirly\"
    Italic on the other hand, which diverges a lot structurally from its Roman, is
    a lot less flexible as a companion.\r\n\r\nFWIW, I just designed/typeset a book
    where one chapter consists of interview-like question/answer paragraphs. The editor
    insisted on having the questions in italics \u2013 and sometimes those are half
    a page in length. At first I groaned; but choosing the right font fixed it, and
    it works pretty well now in terms of marking a rather subtle difference in tone.*
    But I'd say don't do this with a classical Garalde face.\r\n\r\n(* Not a difference
    in color \u2013 I offset that by choosing a slightly heavier weight. Beware that
    many Italics will be lighter than their Romans, and might be too light for extended
    text.)"
