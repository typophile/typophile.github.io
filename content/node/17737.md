      I exactly looking for\u2026\r\nI am more looking for an \"how to\" for classical
      font. As example I could say \"how looks the template that as been used to create
      Frutiger ?\". That is the kind of template I would like to create."

    of a (diachronic) classic typeface is an entity in itself, I guess far from Ben
