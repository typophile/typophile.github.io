  (not my choice). I need to purchase it to complete the project, but I can't find
  it anywhere on the web using that name. I've attached a screenshot of it as used
  in the project. Please disregard the missing parts of the letters on the right.
  That's due to a head in the layout. Thanks for your help!\r\n"

    but I don't know if all these specific swashes are present in the various versions.

  body: "I just tried setting the line in Poetica (see gif). It's not the font, as
    you can easily see, but it is a better designed font, imho. So, it does give me
    a viable option, if I cannot find the font that was originally used. I did need
    to condense Poetica 10% (more than I like to do) and it's still a little wider,
    but I doubt the client would notice the difference.\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Poetica_3664.gif]"
