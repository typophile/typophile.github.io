body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nFirst I want to say hello. This is my first post here and I have
  to admit that I'm actually not at all a pro when it comes to typography, but I have
  a question where I think input from typophiles would really help me make a design
  decision.\r\n\r\nI am currently developing an iOS toy app. Now, near the end I've
  let a couple of friends test it and one of my friends' feedback was that he absolutely
  hated the font I used for my captions. I was using Cochin-BoldItalic until now and
  personally liked it, But since his feedback was so harsh I'm now unsure about it.
  A graphics artist friend of mine suggested using a font without serifs, so now I'm
  thinking about using HelveticaNeue-Light or its italic version. That's also the
  font I use for normal text.\r\n\r\nI've attached an image comparing the three fonts
  in their typical use cases (in game, selection and about screen). Which one would
  a typophile prefer? Or maybe I should use a completely different font? I'm trying
  to limit myself to fonts listed on http://iosfonts.com/ because they come built
  in with the devices (The site is only viewable on a Mac). \r\n\r\nI know that taste
  is really subjective, but maybe my original choice really was very bad from a typography
  point of view? (Personally I am now tending towards HelveticaNeue-LightItalic.)\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your input,\r\nGottfried\r\n"

    like the l/c d in Cochin Italic. It\u2019s <em>\xBBgew\xF6hnungsbed\xFCrftig</em>\xAB)\r\n\r\nYou
    could also try Avenir Next as a clean grotesk face. \r\n\r\nIf you\u2019d like

  body: There is nothing 'wrong' with Helvetica, except ... it's such a default choice!
    So indeed try Avenir (/Next) as well -- I see in your list that iOS has a good
    range of weights, which can help a lot. You could, for example, use Black or Heavy
    for those top titles.

    and only at 4 feet high. Especially considering your app seems to be about something
    emotive (providing more details would be very useful here BTW) you need something
    more compelling.\r\n\r\nAnd/but always remember: you can never satisfy everybody.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Helvetica works much better in print than on screen IMO.  It has small apertures
    which can hamper legibility at small sizes unless you're using a very good quality
    renderer and/or a high resolution screen.\r\n\r\nOut of that list, I dunno...
    Avenir or Gill Sans might work."

    consider Gill Sans or Verdana as good options. Maybe Optima, but it might be a
    little light.\r\n\r\nRenko: \u201CYou can\u2019t do anything wrong with Helvetica.\u201D\r\n\r\nWell,
    a lot of people who care about legibility, and are familiar with the research

    But it\u2019s a geometric sans, not a grotesk sans.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: Though I don't know exactly what feel you're going for, I like the Cochin
    in the screen shots. It's much nicer than the Helvetica, at any rate. If you're
    going for old-fashioned, elegant, playful, quirky, or magical, your Cochin example
    suggests all of these things to me. Your Helvetica example doesn't suggest anything
    other than iOS.

  body: "Thanks for all the comments.\r\n\r\n@hrant: You're right, I try to make an
    emotive app. It's hard to describe, I want it to be like a mixture between a toy
    and a gem. Something to carry around and be soothing. So I try to make it as polished
    as possible. It should feel like a nice crafted piece of wooden furniture (if
    you know what I mean). I've got an early teaser trailer here: http://deltaorange.com/gallery/pocket-nature/.
    But I made that after only 2 weeks into development, so now it's a lot more advanced.
    There are fish in the water and you can summon a unicorn, spawn flowers, etc.\r\n\r\nThe
    goal to have it feel like a nice piece of handicraft is also the reason, why font
    choice seems so important to me. I am using icons now in app from this guy: http://adamwhitcroft.com/
    And his page also made me aware how font choice can make a very simple web design
    shine.\r\n\r\n@Joshua: Yes, I liked Cochin for exactly those reasons in the beginning,
    because it felt polished, old fashioned and not as over the top as Zapfino.\r\n\r\nMaybe
    I should do the same as Adam Whitcroft and do serif-font for the text and sans-serif
    for the captions? This seems to be a quite common choice. Is the reasoning that
    serifs make a font more readable?\r\n\r\nScreen resolution is not a problem since
    the majority of iOS devices is going to be about 300dpi sooner or later."

  body: "If I understand the attached image with choices correctly, you are asking
    for a font for a title bar, in which case you should seriously consider not just
    the aesthetics of the in-app experience, but the overall consistency with native
    iOS look and feel. Case in point - the light Helvetica in the size that you have
    in screenshots make the UI look like Metro from the Windows Phone.\r\n\r\nConsistency
    of the <em>device</em> experience is FAR more important than a fancy-shmancy evocative
    feel of a half a dozen letters that stick out like a sort thumb, because they
    are set in exotic ultra-light cursive or what have you. \r\n\r\nIn other words
    - Helvetica, and in a standard iDevice size. Not because glyph shapes are awesome,
    but because they make your <em>iOS</em> app look better on the <em>iOS</em>."
