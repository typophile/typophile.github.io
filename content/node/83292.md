  I know that a few years ago a proposal was made to implement the babylonian and
  palestinian systems into the Unicode standard; in the meantime, the easiest way
  is to keep the existing Hebrew vowels and use a font with babylonian-style design.\r\nThank
  you very much for any help you can give!\r\nMichael."

  body: "That question was asked (in 2009) on the <a href=\"http://www.bibleworks.com/forums/showthread.php?4121-Unicode-and-Babylonian-vowel-pointing-for-Aramaic\">BibleWorks
    user forums</a>. You can look at the answers. \r\n\r\nI have been \"making fonts
    work\" on my Macintosh for a few years now (I am an academic in a computer science
    department) and your question gave me an idea: why not make a font that can display
    the same source with different \"vocalization styles\" using the style mechanism
    of truetype and opentype fonts?\r\n\r\nTo check if that can work, I took Maxim
    Iorsh's  <a href=\"http://culmus.sourceforge.net/\">Culmus</a> David CLM font
    and added three styles, plus the ability to use in TextEdit on the Mac. Style
    1 just shows blank vowels. Style 2 is basic babylonian, whitout the sheva and
    style 3 is what I made out of the Hebrew <a href=\"http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u05E0\u05D9\u05E7\u05D5\u05D3_\u05D1\u05D1\u05DC\u05D9\"><strong>\u05E0\u05D9\u05E7\u05D5\u05D3_\u05D1\u05D1\u05DC\u05D9</strong></a>
    article on the subject.\r\n\r\nHere is what it gives on a few lines copied from
    the Mechon Mamre <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/t/u/u0101.htm\">Targum
    Onqelos</a> (to compare with the Sperber grab of the <a href=\"http://www.bibleworks.com/forums/showthread.php?4121-Unicode-and-Babylonian-vowel-pointing-for-Aramaic\">BibleWorks
    user forums</a>.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DavidBabel_5867.jpg]\r\nOn
    top, the paste with the \"standard style\". Next, the blank vowel style etc. The
    font does no \"intelligent\" modifications, and vowels go on the mater lectionis
    instead of the preceding consonant (contrary to what Sperber does in the link
    above). That can be fixed using the keyboard. That's what I did in the last line.\r\n\r\n
    My guess it that using such a font on a text that is already vocalized with tiberian
    vowels, you can get with some properly implemented style a text close to what
    you want, with minimum effort;  you then make a few modifications for fine tuning.
    If you want to try you can download <a href=\"http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~boyer/typophile/DavidCLMBabel.zip\">DavidCLMBabel-Medium</a>.\r\n\r\n"
