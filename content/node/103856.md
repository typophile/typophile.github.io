  body: "It's a variation on the famous & by Caslon, so it looks very familiar:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CaslonClassicoBoldItalic_4429.jpg]\r\nAmpersands
    are the place for creative play by font makers, so it could well be from a font
    -- if so, probably a high contrast thick & thin. \r\nIt would take some time to
    go through the candidates to check for a precise match.\r\nThe & symbol is also
    a popular art project.\r\nPerhaps one of the cognoscenti with a good memory could
    pronounce on this one.\r\nBTW, ampersands have been discussed before in typophile
    forums. You might enjoy browsing through:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/search/node/ampersand\r\nDon"
