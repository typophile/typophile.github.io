  body: "This looks nice! I'm so into that swash on the d. \r\nThe first thing I notice
    is how straight and mechanical the underlines are. They are perfect and flat while
    the type is flowing and slants up a little (look at the space below the rs).\r\nThe
    two minor things I also notice are the fine line on the stem of the L looks a
    little thick and not quite right yet. And the bottom of the d, where the stem
    turns into the tail, looks a little heavy. It might be nice to play with making
    the thin upstroke of the bowl build into the stem. \r\nNice work."
