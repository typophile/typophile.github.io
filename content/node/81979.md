  body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nJust installed RoboFab on XP myself and indeed it wasn\u2019t
    completely straightforward. Especially getting FontTools to work required manual
    editing of a file. Here are my steps:\r\n\r\n1. Python 2.4.4\r\n[[http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.4.4/]]\r\ndownload:
    \"python-2.4.4.msi\"\r\nRun the downloaded file\r\n\r\n2. NumPy\r\n[[http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/NumPy/1.2.1/]]\r\ndownload:
    \"numpy-1.2.1-win32-superpack-python2.4.exe\"\r\nRun the downloaded file\r\n\r\n3.
    Robofab+FontTools+DialogKit\r\n[[http://robofab.org/download/index.html]]\r\ndownload:
    \"RoboFab + FontTools + DialogKit Combo\"\r\nUnzip file and place it in Program
    Files directory. I also shortened its name to \"RoboFab226\"\r\n\r\n4. Robofab
    install\r\nGo the the abovementioned \"RoboFab226\" directory, open the \"RoboFab\"
    directory and either:\r\n\u2013 double click: install\r\n\u2013 or open the Command
    Prompt and use C:\\Python24\\python.exe \"C:\\Program Files\\RoboFab226\\RoboFab\\install.py\"\r\n\r\n5.
    DialogKit install\r\nGo the the abovementioned \"RoboFab226\" directory, open
    the \"DialogKit\" directory and either:\r\n\u2013 double click: install\r\n\u2013
    or open the Command Prompt and use C:\\Python24\\python.exe \"C:\\Program Files\\RoboFab226\\DialogKit\\install.py\"\r\n\r\n6.
    FontTools install\r\nGo to C:\\Python24\\Lib\\site-packages\r\nOpen \"dialogKit.pth\"
    in a text editor\r\nReplace its text by \"C:\\Program Files\\RoboFab226\\FontTools\\Lib\"\r\nSave
    the file as \"fonttools.pth\"\r\n\r\nNow open FontLab,\r\ncheck in the properties
    window if Python is installed (otherwise you might need to check the FontLab preferences)\r\nopen
    a new macro window (\"Edit macro\")\r\ntype \"from robofab.world import world
    ; print world\"\r\nand run it.\r\n\r\nHope this helps!\r\n"

    a Mac user... :)\r\n\r\nAnd before I forget: there\u2019s a collection of scripts
    in the Robofab directory. Copy them to the Macros directory in the FontLab application
    directory."

  body: "In case someone is installing Robofab with FontLab 5.2 without any luck,
    try this (following the above steps):\r\n\r\n1. Python 2.7.x\r\n\r\n2. Numpy 1.7.1
    (or later) for python 2.7.x\r\n\r\n3. RoboFab 599 (or later) with all dependencies
    (plusAllDependencies zip file)\r\n\r\n4. Same\r\n\r\n5. Same (when saving the
    fonttools.pth file select the ANSI encoding system, others like UTF-8 may cause
    errors later)\r\n\r\n6. Run the code, you should get something like this:\r\n\"Robofab
    is running on win32, Python version: 2.7, Mac stuff: None, PC stuff: True, FontLab
    stuff: True, FLversion: 5.2.1.4868, Glyphs stuff: False, Glyphs version: None,
    RoboFont stuff: False, RoboFont version: None\"\r\n\r\nIf you get any Traceback
    or Import Error is because there is something wrong with Python installation or
    the other libraries, so you must try again.\r\n\r\nAh, don't copy the Robofab
    Scripts folder, instead copy the folders inside the Scripts folder (Fontlab can't
    read macros that are on folders inside folders) and paste in the macros folder
    (may be on this address: C:\\Users\\UserName\\Documents\\Fontlab\\Studio 5\\Macros).
    Check the scripts with the Macro toolbar (inside FontLab, go to View/Toolbars/Macro).\r\n\r\nMany
    thanks to pvanderlaan! \xA1Buena suerte!\r\n\r\nNote: If you came to this post
    from this another in the FontLab forum: [[http://forum.fontlab.com/index.php?topic=8750.0]]
    please be sure to follow this updated steps first. The FontLab forum post cited
    the steps published in 2011."

    admin account.\r\n\r\ndepending on where you have installed python, fontlab and
    the robofab folder, windows will protect changes done by other programs, so the
    setup routines etc. just don't do anything (but you don't get a warning about
    this).\r\n\r\nso make very sure - even if you have an admin account running -
    that your python command shell (python.exe) is executed with administrator rights
    (rightclick> properties > compatibility > run as admin) before doubleclicking
    the install scripts.  also make sure your text editor is running in admin mode
    when editing the path files."
