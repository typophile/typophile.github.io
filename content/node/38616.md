body: "Can anybody here help this volunteer?\r\n\r\nThis is a huge long shot and I
  know this isn't the Adobe support board but... this is slightly type related.\r\n\r\nI
  am making some short videos for Typecon in a 30 day trial of Adobe After Effects
  CS3. And While it is a hellaciously cool and powerful program it also seems to be
  hellaciously buggy. The error I keep getting is cutting into my productivity is
  and so it is putting the project into real jeprody. \r\n\r\nThe error itself is
  ' overflow converting ratio denominators ( 17:: 19 ) '\r\n\r\nThere are very few
  references online regarding this error but all of them suggest that the error is
  associated with pushing the limits of memeory with 2 hour long projects with huge
  file sizes. This project is the opposite. Super short & very small data sizes for
  the cast members. The time on the project is 9 min. It does use a Sound file ( 4.5
  Megs )\r\n\r\nIn case it is of any help - what I am doing is panning over and fading
  in and out of photos and Jpegs of Fonts.\r\n\r\nThe one idea I had which was to
  update the trial version from 8.0.0.298 to 8.0.2 did not work probably because the
  trial version is not eligible for the upgrade.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    Cow:</a>\r\nmy solution was to create a composition from one of the AE presets
    first and then tweak the settings slightly to match my movie properties. Adding
    my movie clip to this composition gives me no errors and we're good to go.\r\n\r\n\r\n>
    update the trial version from 8.0.0.298 to 8.0.2\r\nBetter idea: try their new
    deal (till next month) \u2014 PPK: Pay Per Keyframe. That said, you have the full
    version for a limited time  :^)             \r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                    "
