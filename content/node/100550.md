body: "Hi Folks, could really do with your help if you wouldnt mind?\r\n\r\nCould
  anyone identify the 2 fonts used in this image please? I'm kind of assuming that
  the 'Dog Walking' text may have had each individual letter 'skewed' but if we can
  identify the typeface that would be fantastic.\r\n\r\nThe smaller text uses a font
  that im sure i've seen before as i recognise the '&' symbol but I cant remember
  what its called.\r\n\r\nany help would be much appreciated :)\r\nThanks\r\ndaz\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Dog%20sitting%20and%20dog%20walking%20south%20london%20logo_5839.gif]"

    Everything''s working fine now. '

    to bother you again. They are similar but even the 'black' one isnt quite bold
    enough.\r\n\r\nany other ideas please?"
