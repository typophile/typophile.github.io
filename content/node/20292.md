  with Fontlab 4.5 (4.6) since 2003 and I like the product very much. What I mean:
  is it worth it?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nKTKM\r\n"

    If everything is working okay I'm not sure there is much of an advantage. On the
    other hand the upgrade from 4.6 to 5.02 is only $99 if I read it correctly. \r\n\r\nIt
    does seem to be much less inscrutable and has a bit more sophistication to it.
    It has far more options in regard to ongoing software and systems development
    though and this is always an important reason for keeping your applications updated.\r\n\r\nGerald"
