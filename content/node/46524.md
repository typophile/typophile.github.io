  body: "For some reason, besides liking the players, I specifically really like the
    Dutch shirt, and at least the number font -- the letter font is ok. (They are
    different, right?)\r\nAnyone know what fonts these are or how they choose them? "

  body: 'nevermind, tomhowe thanks, you hit it on the spot. Apparently the dutch use

    although I think they look pretty rad. '
