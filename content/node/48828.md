  scratch with my backups.\r\n\r\nHopefully, I had a copy of my C:\\PSFONTS folder.\r\nI
  thought copying that folder to my fresh C:\\ and reinstalling ATM after, will just
  do find and ATM will have updated automatically the font list but it doesn't work.
  ATM just show up default font list from its install but it doesn't list my OT and
  PS fonts from the copied PSFONTS folder.\r\nAm I missing some configuration file
  or database file somewhere ?\r\nI have a image copy of my C:\\ that burned so I
  can go look after some files if needed.\r\nI tried to find some config file in Application
  Data folders but without success, any clue ? Anyone already done that ?\r\nThanks
  a lot.\r\nI really don't want go trhought the process of reinstalling manually all
  my fonts as it was already setup find.\r\n\r\n"

  body: The downfall of all font management programs is the database. Bulletproof
    databases seem still embarrassingly difficult to build. ATM Deluxe on both Mac
    and Windows has always had the most robust database structure of comparable products.
    That said, I dimly recall there was some way you could manage to lose it. Let's
    hope someone from Adobe will be able to help. One problem is that nobody likes
    to have a database structure in simple ASCII (for space and time reasons), yet
    that is the best way to keep it clean and the only way it can be manually rebuilt
    if necessary.

    the least damaged, it would be very difficult to reconstruct. But if all you need
    is to find the file on an old system, perhaps everything will work? '

  body: "I believe that ATMREG.ATM has something to do with ATM database, as size
    increase while feeding my font list. Billtroop, you right, not the kind of file
    you want to reconstruct, I seriously doubt it can be. I had daily backups of my
    system so I can recover it from a previous working setup, that what I was looking
    after. I tried but without success, some troubles like trying to popup the ATM
    TT folder in C:\\windows\\fonts\\ that was set in my system before. May be I should
    try it by the recovery consol in DOS mode. That fonts folder in c:\\windows has
    special behaviour.\r\nMajus, I'll be glade if you can take few minutes and look
    for that .ini file.\r\nThanks."

  body: "Absynthe, I finally remembered to look into the issue today and I was wrong.
    You have the right file (ATMREG.ATM). That is indeed the database file.\r\n\r\nYou
    didn't mention what version of Windows you are using or which version of ATM you
    are using. What I suggest doing is to do a search for ATMREG.ATM and determine
    its location, then replace it with a backup copy.\r\n\r\nI've been responding
    under the assumption that you have ATM Deluxe so my answers are aimed in that
    direction. In general, if you have to reinstall ATM Deluxe and you have a backup
    copy of the ATMREG.ATM file, then just replace the newly installed file with your
    backup copy, restart, and ATM Deluxe will list all your fonts as before.\r\n\r\nIf
    you don't have a backup copy of the database file, all your missing fonts probably
    will have to be added to ATM Deluxe manually. If you are using ATM Deluxe version
    4.1, be absolutely sure that your font set names don't exceed 31 characters. If
    any set foldername does, all font sets after that point will disappear from view.
    While they will still be in the ATMREG.ATM database, ATM cannot manage them so
    you cannot use them.\r\n\r\nOnce you get back on track, make a copy of your database
    file and store it somewhere safe. Update it whenever you've added more fonts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
