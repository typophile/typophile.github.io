    <BR><i>&#40; The &#39;k&#39; seems &#39;rather&#39; narrow, compared to the other
    characters.. &#41;</i>

  body: no, the company that had this done says it is a font, they want to use it
    for other things, but i have no idea what it would be. I tried the whatthefont
    identification thing on myfonts too. Any help would be really, really great. Thanks
    all!

  body: Jeremy, convince them since its their name, its unique in that face and would
    be lost if it was used for other communications. Then you could use a nicely designed
    face.

  body: Leigh,  <BR> <BR>Something is going wrong with your posts, because I think
    you started out wanting to talk about designing a font for a special purpose.
    Your posts have showed up on several threads, completely out of context with the
    ongoing discussions. Click on the HOME page and look for the appropriate forum
    and then locate &#39;Start a New Thread&#39;. Then you stay with that thread to
    enter your posts. <BR> <BR>I hope this helps.
