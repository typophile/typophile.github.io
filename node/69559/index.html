  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Background - I usually don&rsquo;t have this kind of difficulty coming up with concepts but I have a client that has given a lot of things to deal with on this one. This is a re-brand of an architecture firm that has a current logo that they are not happy with for a number of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Their current logo is outdated and they are finding themselves bound to the &ldquo;square&rdquo; in all uses and many times it leaves the company name too small to even be legible. They find that they often blow the &ldquo;square&rdquo; up so large it is ridiculous just to see the company name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They would like carry over some element of the current logo to make it identifiable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They are hesitant to introduce a plant or leaf because they don&rsquo;t want to be mistaken for a landscape contractor and fear the line is thin to slip into something not professional enough. They are willing to explore a plant element if it is &ldquo;artistic&rdquo; or &ldquo;architectural&rdquo; in nature (their words).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since they are in the design industry they probably could design their own logo like many architects do so they are going to be more particular</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They would like an icon as part of their new logo, something they can use in presentation material or as a watermark</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So you can see that the creative box is a bit smaller than usual and I am going nuts with this one. Any comments or direction is greatly appreciated! Here are some initial quick concepts:</p>

Type: maybe something a bit more geometric could help.
When I think of &ldquo;landscape&rdquo;, I think something mostly horizontal with some vertical elements. Their original logo is too vertical.
They should give you some visuals of their work you could use as inspiration.
If you rotate the k in your last attempt (Box1c) 90° counterclockwise, you have an horizontal landscape with a very abstract (dare I say, architectural) tree in it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think that architecture firm needs more robust/stable/technical logo. Their current logo is nice, stable, square, firm&hellip;</p>
<p>To me 2B and 1A seem the most promising. Especially 2B. 1A has too strong an emphasized  type and should be loosened a bit. While changing type to normal weight, you could also widen character spacing when using all caps. It could make it even more &ldquo;posh&rdquo;, because you can afford space. Anyway. I don&rsquo;t think too organic logos will be well accepted by your strictly technical clients.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thank you all for your input. I definitely think I have too many options on the table because even in 5 responses there is direct opposite views, but I guess that&rsquo;s what makes design so interesting, it&rsquo;s all in the eye of the beholder.</p>
<p>penn &amp; ink, thank you for the directness of what you thought about the mark in 1/1a/1b. Their company tag line is &ldquo;Imagine. Create. Live.&rdquo; The 3 petals or leaflets were meant to represent each of these in the case that they want to use the mark/icon with just the tag line. Sometimes I find myself getting too caught up in satisfying these types of things and then when all is said and done I stand back and look at the logo and think &ldquo;what the hell was I thinking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As for the client&rsquo;s eye, they are attracted to the horizontal layout of the text in 2b but think &ldquo;Landscape Architects&rdquo; is too long to be sharing a single line with &ldquo;southwick&rdquo;. They also feel like that text arrangement is all too common among architects as well. While they like the horizontal feel in 2b they also dislike the icon in 2b the most of any. They feel it looks like something that represents a hotel/resort or would be found on a complimentary bar of soap&hellip;haha, I can&rsquo;t argue that!</p>
<p>They are most attracted to the idea of Agave1c but aren&rsquo;t sold on stacking &ldquo;landscape&rdquo; over &ldquo;architects&rdquo; on one side like that. They also have concerns about the square fighting for attention with the free flow of the agave plant. Here are some other options on Agave1c that may help resolve those issues.<img src="/images/old-images/Agave1c-rnd2_6303.gif" alt=""></p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>this is becoming better but as mentioned before in my post (I forgot to say that 1A I was referring to should actually be <strong>Box1A</strong> because there is more than just one 1A). Anyway.</p>
<p>I would use normal weight Gill Sans in &ldquo;southwick&rdquo;. The same would then be applied to the box/line that derives it&rsquo;s weight from letter weight.</p>
<p>Plant stylisation may as well be a bit confusing. Lines are also way to thin in some parts. Experiment some more with plant if you really need it. I wouldn&rsquo;t use it anyway. Or make it more &ldquo;sans serif&rdquo; with uniweight strokes&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well, I have met with the client a couple of different times since this update and they have reverted to wanting something more simple. They have thrown out all concepts at this point that have any plant mark involved and would rather stick to holding on to their box of the current logo somehow. They have also come up with a new tag line and would like to see it incorporated with the logo.</p>
<p>I feel like these are too plain now and don&rsquo;t set them apart as anything different. These could be anyone&rsquo;s logo and I am having a hard time believing that after all of this process that these are what they would truly be happy with.<img src="/images/old-images/SLA-B_3626.gif" alt="">
