body: "Hi everyone -\r\n\r\nApologies for what may be a basic question, but my company
  has been evaluating TypeKit for the past month and I'm trying to figure out if we
  can use Google Font API instead. I have a couple of questions I was hoping folks
  might be able to help answer.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nWe've been wanting to use TypeKit
  in the hopes that we'll be able to use a variety of typefaces across a portfolio
  of sites that we manage and it's attractiveness up until this point has been that
  it provides the largest library of high quality typefaces in a way that protects
  the foundries rights as well as offers the most cross browser support.\r\n\r\nThat
  said, if we can use the Google Font API to access non-open source fonts that we
  buy from foundries such as Mark Simonson, Veer, Village, etc., it might be cheaper
  and more cost effective for us to buy the fonts and use them this way, rather than
  pay for the enterprise TypeKit account.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I see that the Google
  Font API has a \"custom\" module that allows you to reference fonts on other servers.
  My understanding is that you still have to be referencing fonts that have a web
  embedding license in order to use the custom module, and that you can't just use
  any standard font that you've purchased. \r\n\r\nIs this correct? \r\n\r\nAlso,
  while I'm asking, does using the Google Font API automatically convert your TTF
  typeface to other formats such as EOT in order to display it in IE browsers or do
  I need to provide links to an EOT packaged typeface on our servers?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance. Any help navigating this subject would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nbest,\r\nkyle"

    use. And yes, converting a commercial font to EOT is most likely a violation of
    the license agreement (EULA).\r\n\r\nWith Fontfont Webfonts you can upload the
    files to your own web server, but they demand a license per domain, per business.
    Also: they only offer EOT and WOFF files, which isn\u2019t completely cross browser
    yet."

  body: "I think web font services can offer two distinct advantages over \"host your
    own\" solutions.\r\n\r\n1. Make commercial fonts available\r\n2. Provide on-the-fly
    enhancements when improved (hinted) versions of fonts become available, or when
    new platforms and browsers emerge. \r\n\r\nThe downside would seem to be having
    someone else host the fonts, and losing a level of control. \r\n\r\nSo unless
    I'm missing something, the Google service doesn't provide item 1 and doesn't mention
    2. So I really don't see the point of it vs freeware \"host you own\" sets from
    operations like Font Squirrel.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that this was developed for
    Google's own use (in ads) or perhaps for things like Googledocs (where it will
    be used to host licensed commercial fonts), and Raph is just sharing Google\u2019s
    engineering cleverness with the world. \r\n  "

    Google is offering in their repository, you can add Typekit's offerings (using
    your Typekit account), as well.\r\nNot sure how it would work with anybody else's
    product. Haven't had a chance to fully absorb all of it.\r\n\r\n>So I really don't

    Font Squirrel.\r\n\r\nI am assuming (only assuming, don't know for sure) that
    Google is using a CDN so speed of delivery is an issue. Also - and this is almost
    sure to be the case - Google's servers will already be set up to gzip and add
    appropriate cache-headers where appropriate. So, if you're unsure of what you
    need to do server-side to host effectively, Google is providing that.\r\n\r\n>My

    >Googledocs, and Raph is just sharing Google\u2019s engineering cleverness with
    the world.\r\n\r\nWell, if you ain't at least got engineering cleverness, what
    have you got?\r\nI'm guessing differently. The whole thing has been set up as
    a big open source project and there's a lot of enthusiasm behind it.\r\nBut it's
    still in the cradle right now and only time will tell.\r\n\r\n@kylec\r\n\r\nI
    would contact Garrick Van Buren at Kernest.com - the open source font hosting
    service. He will probably be able to provide you with exactly what you need, even
    if it's just sound advice. http://kernest.com\r\ngarrick[at]kernest.com"

  body: "In its current state, the Google Font API only works with the fonts we're
    hosting, which are all open source. The WebFont Loader library (written in JavaScript)
    has modules that will load fonts from other providers, including Typekit.\r\n\r\nFor
    the fonts we host, we automatically generate EOT, with more formats coming. We
    <i>will</i> be improving hinting, spacing, and other technical aspects of our
    fonts, and all these improvements should just work when you use our API.\r\n\r\nWe
    are using Google infrastructure for content distribution. Without getting into
    specifics, it's pretty good, and we're doing all the things you'd expect to optimize
    performance.\r\n\r\nWe definitely built this to serve both the world (as an open
    source project) and Google applications, including the new Spreadsheet Forms themes,
    and of course we're excited about the future of the project."
