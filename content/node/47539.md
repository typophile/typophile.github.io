body: "I am working on a project for a non-profit music organization. It's a brochure/calendar
  of their events for the 2008/2009 season. The last version of this project (which
  I also designed) was very clean, simple, structured, etc. (4panel, french fold,
  11x17in.)\r\nSee example below.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cgsbrochure_3946.JPG]\r\n\r\nAfter
  my recent meeting w/ the client, he mentioned they'd like a different aesthetic
  this year. Something more sophisticated, classy & elegant. Now, that's not typically
  my 'design style', but it's something that's lacking in my portfolio. Most of my
  work is very bold and in a way, heavy. Nothing elegant about it! :P \r\n\r\nMy client
  asked me to forward him some electronic examples of elegant/sophisticated/classy
  layout & typography. I've done my research and have look at TDC, SPD, and some other
  type books and real-life examples. What I was wondering if you guys have any good
  online galleries & other links that you could post. I'm not asking you do my research
  for me, as I am conducting research on my own already. I just need something online
  that I can send to my client.\r\n\r\nThanks Typophiles!"

    white space. But it's so subjective.\r\n\r\nSorry I cant think of any examples
    right now, I'll post if I do.\r\n"

  body: "they might also be looking for a layout with a more clear focus, and fewer
    'postage stamps.'\r\nthe spreads above are pretty boxy, with no 'come hither'
    quality... you might try pulling one iconic image, playing it a lot larger, and
    letting the smaller images reinforce and augment.\r\ni would also suggest a clear
    headline or tag to draw the reader in... that's how i often read \"elegant\" from
    a client."

    objective terms as well. what do they find classy? and why?\r\n\r\nat any rate,
    i like a lot of the work coming out of madethought:\r\nwww.madethought.com"

  body: "Hi Nikita. For a classy elegant layout, keep it simple. I mean </em>really</em>
    simple, and clean. Reduce the number of elements (pics, blocks of text etc) to
    as few as the content will allow, and banish of all traces of clutter. Use \"classy\"
    or classical type, or if the client must have serifless things go for a sans with
    classical underpinnings. Keep the stylings classical. That means horizontal lines
    and an emphasis on horizontal division of space. Type on its side, perpendicular
    to the horizontal axis, will not get you or your client upstairs at the Savoy.
    Chuck Groth is right about the postage stamps. Get rid of them. Also use color
    in a restrained manner. A tiny dab, in only a few isolated places, is all you
    need. Make the monochrome images monochrome with just a hint of warmth rather
    than the overt red colorization. Dotted lines are a pass\xE9, a woeful leftover
    from the early 2000's.\r\n\r\nIf you want classy and elegant, be classical. One
    of the simplest ways of doing that is to resist the temptation to mix italics
    in with roman. Make it all one or the other. Be a purist.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"
