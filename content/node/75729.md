  names need to be added and the original stone mason doesn't exist any longer.

  body: "Seems to be a difficult one - I would have thought that the rounded E and
    the 9 are very characteristic.  Is this a totally different field from print/online
    fonts?  Perhaps the mason designed it himself, or even my grandfather.\r\nFailing
    identification, we'd be interested in a font that's reasonably close in character
    but not too Gothic/\"aulde German\"."
