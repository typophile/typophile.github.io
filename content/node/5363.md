  body: Maybe try offsetting the icon so it doesn&#39;t look too corporate and using
    all lowercase so it isn&#39;t too sporty. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/39248.gif"

  body: Hi Adam, <BR> <BR>I really like the icon you designed . . . just a couple
    of suggestions to refine it further . . . <BR> <BR>I think you should get rid
    of the border around the icon, maybe offset another color behind it to add dimension.
    <BR> <BR>I agree with Tom about offsetting the logo and using lower case, although
    I think something like avante garde might work better for your font. Play around
    with a few things and see what works -- you have a great start! <BR> <BR><img

  body: 'Adam: <BR> <BR>I guess I&#39;m rockin&#39; the boat here, but if  your icon
    says anything about your illustrative style, I think the caps &#40;not italicized&#41;
    work better than lc. Your icon does look a little &#34;sporty&#34;, as Tom put
    it &#40;referring to the uppercase&#41;, and I haven&#39;t heard any reason to
    think that &#34;sporty&#34; isn&#39;t an appropriate representation for your work.
    Perhaps you can clear that up by letting us know a little about what you do. Until
    then, my only criticism is that your curves still need to be smoothed out a little.

  body: 'Adam, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m concerned about the swooshy P. The swoosh element
    has been over used in logos for some time now. That said, if it is representitive
    of your illustrative style use it. But, if you just think it looks cool, I say
    try something that would be more reflective of your work.  <BR> <BR>Where does
    the name Pappy come from? Is there some way to illustrate your choice in company
    name? '

  body: Hey guys, <BR> Thanks for the advice so far.  I see what you mean about it
    being too sporty.  I actually might go a whole different route.  I hope to have
    something else very soon.  Again, I appreciate the critiques. <BR>Adam
