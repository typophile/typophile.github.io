<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>The quote is a tricky, powerful "shape-shifter" of a character, with abilities way beyond its formal uses for marking verbal expressions, titles, etc. We've all seen it used to mean "not exactly", or even "not really, but this way you can't sue me", when a product is advertised to do something it doesn't. I've also seen it used to mean "not exactly but there's something to it": during a visit to the Cayman Islands I saw a car rental place with a large "JEEP ONLY" sign, in quotes; it actually had other vehicles for rent too, but/so wanted to succinctly state: "This is the place for renting a jeep, but we have other stuff too"*. And during this past spring break I saw the quote used thus:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/quotes_s_4715.jpg]
_
Can you guess what it's doing there?
_
* Some years later I saw a similar thing at a motorcycle rental place in Hawaii: "HARLEYS ONLY".
--
Please post other example of the quote doing something
besides what it's "supposed" to. (And there it is again!)

Well, they started out in all caps, so when it came time to emphasize a word, they were stumped. Setting it in lower case wouldn't look right, and they didn't have a bold or italic font, or underlines [edit: or as hhp notes, maybe didn't think of letterspacing], so quote marks did the trick.
Somewhat related, *certain* Typophilers use asterisks for emphasis -- what's with that?</div>

<div class=commentbody>I used asterisks heavily on Typo-L, and still do when when stuck without formatting (although sometimes I prefer all-caps these days). In fact I've noticed that sometimes the discussion list software will automatically make a word between asterisks bold.

<div class=commentbody>> “Chinese Food” for take-out and delivery only.
Those are Japanese quotes. As a translator I see them all the time.
I won't bore you with the details, but basically this is one way that people used to thinking in a topic-comment language try to make up for English's lack of ways to formally mark the topic.
They just want everyone to be very clear that this sentence is about Chinese Food.</div>

<em>Alamo</em>, the ninth and final collected volume of the comic book <em>Preacher</em>. I think that I may have to post this one in the graphic design studios at school.

Yes, but creating legibility issues is worse in some circumstances, especially signage. </div>

<div class=commentbody>I always thought the non-sarcastic use of emphatic quotes was the punctuation-equivalent of a misspelling or grammatical error. However, it is so common, and not condemned to the same degree. Lately, I am starting to suspect that there may be something more historical to it.
Nevertheless, with all the uses they already have, and visual similarity to primes, I think enough is enough. I am all for little *asterisk* stickers that I can slap over "abused" quotation marks.~</div>

<div class=commentbody>I wish I could find one of my favourite old Dilbert cartoons, where Anne L. Retentive, the editor, spots a typo and goes into a comma -- I had to explain both the typo and the sentiment to many people.
Where one can use emphasis tags, like here, I prefer them, but if I want to emphasize something elsewhere, I will use asterisks, as, has been noted above, there are programs that will convert them to bold.
Anytime I use quote to emphasize, I invariably put <em>soi-disant</em> before it. ;-)

<div class=commentbody>Though you are all showing a great sense of humor about the quotes - I doesn't sound like anyone here has set type hand in hand with an editor - trying to meet deadline.
A decent editor would take those quotes (I am speaking from interior book design) and make them <em>Italics</em> for the emphasis.
Right now, I am laying out a story on Duesenbergs - and the author refers to them as "Duesys" (hmmm should that be Duesies?) and yes, in quotes - but when the article is published the readers shall see it in Italics...
Or are we just picking on the word that's has the quotes around it...
And I love the inch-mark remark. When the New York Times back in 1987 printed a full page ad - and the quote marks were inch marks -- everyone at TANY (remember them? Typographic Association of New York) commented how it was the end of the professional typesetting age... and yes, they were right.
Meanwhile, I always loved the oversized quotes found in Zapf Dingbats - they really get the quoted message across.</div>
