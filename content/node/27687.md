body: "Hi I am making a flash banner for this company, but for some reason when I
  import an image of their logo it looks really blurry and horrible.\r\n\r\nI have
  been told I will need to recreate the logo in Flash to make it look a lot smoother.\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone know the fonts used in this ad? I need to know the logo font, and the other
  two body fonts (blue and green).\r\n\r\nThanks again. ^_^"

  body: "Hi Cheryl\r\n\r\nThe 'g' in the logo is probably ITC Bookman (Light). The
    'm' and the 'k' are from some other oldstyle face, possibly Caslon or Plantin.
    I notice there is only a half serif on the foot of the 'k', so you might have
    to mess about with a Caslon 'k' (just a little bit) to match the logotype exactly. "
