<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I have recently seen several references to grids involved with t-shirts and magazines layout. I know there is an option for grids in Photoshop, but never really heard how they are used. I have always composed by eyeballing it (and this may be obvious to grid afficianados).
Can anyone suggest a resource that would explaing the basic use of grids in design?
And when composing inside an image where the image dictates where some things have to go, are grids still useful?
Thanks.</div>

There are quite a few others as well, and I think there have been several 'Grid' related threads before, on Typophile. Let me see.

<div class=commentbody>Thanks for that info. It was nice to see all the reviewers were unanimous in the usefulness of this book. And the link showed what other books were bought by people who also bought that book. This led to a couple other interesting books, including one by Bringhurst, which I keep seeing people cite from.
"Thinking With Type" looks good too. Maybe one of these days I can say "I kinda know what I'm doing"

<div class=commentbody>Fontplayer -
Photoshop is not a "design" software per se - it's used for images and image manipulation. For design, especially something like a magazine, you should be using Quark or Indesign, not photoshop.
You should also familiarize yourself with guides so you don't have to be eyeballing anything. This applies to p-shop and Illustrator as well as Quark and Indy.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Photoshop keeps getting better and better for the things I want to do with it. It seems all I have to do is wish something, and PS has it two versions later. Kind of like magic.
All I ever design are fontplays. The magazines I do are just imaginary ones to display a font. It doesn't seem worth buying and learning all the expensive programs real designers use. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Photoshop is still pretty crappy for type, there's no way around it.
If you are serious about working with fonts you really need to work with design software.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Also, PhotoShop is quite cumbersome when it comes to type. You can do so much more, and much more quickly, with something like InD or even Illustrator.

<div class=commentbody>Photoshop is also not too good at exact grids. Besides eyeballing a composition is not necessarily a bad thing.

<div class=commentbody>> How do you test your fonts without real software :(
With some fonts, you don't have to do much to find out they are screwed up. Sometimes I consider it a challenge to make it display nicely (faking real quotes, or maybe kerning a little bit). But if it is too bad, it gets the boot. There are plenty more where they came from.
> If you are serious about working with fonts you really need to work with design software.
Maybe someday. I suppose it would be nice if I got good enough that foundries would start sending me some of their fonts to play with and feature on my site. A three relatively small ones already do, although I was a customer first. Someday I will probably start a commercial section, so I can play with more fonts that have fewer surprises.
Right now I have almost 20,000 IP addresses making over 4,500,000 hits a month, mostly for the free photos. At some point I am hoping I have enough traffic that someone that sells fonts and images, will also let me feature their images for a link to their site. I see some pretty cool photos in some of the magazines that somehow find their way to me in the mail. (I think Adobe may give away addresses).
Anyway, I'm an old dog, but I can still learn a new trick if I'm dragged kicking and screaming.
