  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">In September, my wife and I will be moving to Oxford, UK as she will be starting a masters program in book publishing at Oxford Brookes University. We currently live near Washington, DC, so right now we are going through all the crap that goes along with moving internationally. I've started to dip my toes into the water and have begun looking around for any leads for job opportunities over there and am realizing that I have no clue where to start looking.

I'm really only looking for internship opportunities to start, so I've started keeping a list of any design firms that look like they might be a good fit for me in the Oxford/London area, and figured I would send out my resumé / portfolio and hope any of them bite.

Now my questions are such:

It appears that bus or train travel to London from Oxford is readily available, with a commute time of 1hour for train and up to 1:45 for Bus (depending on the area). Are there any people who know anything about the Oxford/London area and whether a commute to London from Oxford would be suicide or if it would be feasible?

Are there online resources for design jobs in the UK that someone can point me to? (I'm sure there are and I just don't know them)

Are there any design firms that you suggest I add to my list?

Any other tips?

Thanks very much for any help you all can give me.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi

I live in Oxford and work for Oxford Brookes University. I am sure that you will enjoy your time in Oxford. It can be a great place to live.

A lot of people commute from Oxford to London, both by train and bus. The bus is relatively comfortable and pretty reliable. The train is quicker but more expensive. Both are cheaper with monthly or annual passes. The return trains which most people catch can be crowded, and sometimes it is difficult to find a seat. The key thing to look at is where exactly in London the job is. You do not want to spend an additional hour in each direction commuting within London.

Trains arrive at Paddington station, so you should look for something close by. The bus is more flexible and stops in two or three places in Central London.

Hope it works out.

Cheers</div>

FWIW – maybe have a look here: http://www.dezeenjobs.com/
It's mostly architecture / product design oriented, but there is the occasional graphic design listing too.

Good luck!</div>

Thanks for the inside info! It's good to know that a commute to London wouldn't kill me — it really opens my options. Thanks for taking the time to write.

@Nina
Thanks for the link. It definitely looks like there will be some leads there worth pursuing.
