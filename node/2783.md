  body: I think the underlying idea is good. But there&#39;s no way something rendered
    in this way will come out right under enough circumstances. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: What&#39;s the company called? Can you give an explanation for what you&#39;ve
    done so far? As is, I don&#39;t know about that color. <BR> <BR>I can make up
    an underlying idea here, something like the serif glyph projects the image of
    the company and the double-pixel font shadow describes their work, but it seems
    a bit trite to me. What are your thoughts?

  body: The idea was simply that of a real  &#39;h&#39; casting a digital shadow.
    I&#39;m not sure about the color either, but the budget is very tight and I only
    have 7 standard colors to work with. This color is pantone process cyan.   I was
    also considering PMS 021 &#40;standard AWT orange&#41;. The smallest the logo
    will appear in print will be on business cards.  I have considered stroking the
    individual &#39;pixels&#39; in order to better  define them at small sizes or
    for on screen use.  <BR>Thank you for your input

    never be able to go smaller than the size above. Other than that, neat analog&#62;digital
    analogy and a solid look. I like it. Don&#39;t do it in Orange, though... it&#39;s
    the most overused web-comapny colour of them all :-D. '

  body: I think the idea is plenty strong, just needs tweeking. I think the biggest
    reproduction problems &#40;when it gets printed on my ghetto laser printer or
    faxed, etc&#41; is going to be the fade in the shadow and the lines making the
    pixels. I might explore ways to say &#34;pixelated&#34; without the grid. I also
    thing the angle alone gives it the shadow flavor, no need to fade it out.  <BR>
    <BR>However, having said that, there is no reason to not have two versions, as
    long as you can stress their applications correctly in the standards manual.  <BR>
    <BR>Good luck, it&#39;s looking good. <BR> <BR>Aaron

  body: I&#39;m not feeling this identity at all. The serif isn&#39;t definitive and
    the pixel font is too &#34;whuh?&#34;. Could you try making the pixel font solid,
    as in no fade, no horizontal white lines, and no vertical white lines inside?
    Is that Minion? Not bad, but I don&#39;t know. <BR> <BR>Can we see an update?
    And what&#39;s the company name?

  body: 'The company is called &#34;Hannah Web Design.&#34;  <BR>Here are a few idears:
    <BR> <BR>A.  I tried standard teal &#40;PMS 320&#41; instead of process blue <BR>B.
    Here are a few versions of the logo - i&#39;m not sure if they are consistent
    enough, however.   <BR>C. My next challenge is the logotype to accompany the mark.  I
    want to use something modern looking that suggests the web, but doesn&#39;t look
    too unprofessional or illegible.  &#40;4&#41; this one is called D3 electronism.

    <BR>opportunity _ constructing a logo for a company name  <BR>whose name is a
    palindrome. <BR> <BR> <BR>Otto construction <BR>Radar industries <BR>etc. <BR>
    <BR>In my opinion, what you have currently is too trite. It feels very <BR>&#34;mid
    90s web company&#34; vs. &#34;modern web company&#34;. <BR> <BR>You have a great
    opportunity here ... i would suggest <BR>playing with the HAN/han forms &#40;sketching
    or doodling <BR>in a vector app&#41; and see what develops. <BR> <BR>bj

  body: I like the concept a lot, actually &#40;even if it&#39;s not incredibly original
    or whatever&#41;. But, it does seem a bit impractical for a logo. <BR> <BR>Like
    bj said, Hannah is a palindrome, so maybe that serif to pixel idea could be used
    half and half on the name hannah. Or maybe the H on each end could be capped or
    larger SC, with one serif and one pixel. But then again, you&#39;re entering Xerox
    logo territory again. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s tough, but there&#39;s a lot of potential
    with the name and the subject matter. Personally, I&#39;d try diggin into the
    company&#39;s personality a bit more, especially since they&#39;re small. That
    may give you something to work with that hasn&#39;t been designed 400 billion
    times already &#40;generic &#39;digital looking&#39; web company logos&#41;.

  body: Stephen, I think you&#39;d be better off with a bitmap font and forget the
    clever drop shadow. Look at the Indie books, lots of good bitmap fonts to choose
    from. The CitiBank/Travelers logo works because its so simple. KISS rules
