body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Foundries]] : The Ensched\xE9 Font Foundry</strong>\r\n\r\nThe
  firm of Joh. Ensched\xE9 en Zonen was established in Haarlem (Netherlands) in 1703.
  It is widely recognized as one of Holland\u2019s finest printing houses. Ensched\xE9
  prints banknotes and stamps for the Dutch government, fine art catalogues, and commercial
  high-quality work.\r\n\r\nEnsched\xE9 started type manufacturing in 1743 after purchasing
  the foundry of Hendrik Wetstein. From its early years the typefoundry was the most
  important part of Ensched\xE9\u2019s business. The famous punchcutter [[Joan Michael
  Fleischman]] was employed there in the eighteenth century. Its type business flourished
  throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and in the twentieth century
  the foundry achieved widespread international acclaim through the design and production
  of types by [[Sjoerd H. de Roos]] and [[Jan van Krimpen]]. In 1978, to celebrate
  their 275th anniversary, Ensched\xE9 commissioned [[Bram de Does]], one of Holland\u2019s
  leading typographers, to design a typeface specifically for phototypesetting. The
  result was [[Trinit\xE9]], a face which clearly shows its provenance and which continues
  the tradition of type design established at Ensched\xE9 so many years before.\r\n\r\nIn
  1991 [[Peter Matthias Noordzij]] established <a href=\"http://www.teff.nl/\" target=\"new\"
  title=\"Go to the website\">The Ensched\xE9 Font Foundry</a>. His high standards
  of design and craftsmanship, his wide technical expertise, and his established skill
  as a type designer, made him ideally placed to continue Ensched\xE9\u2019s tradition
  of high-quality type design and manufacture using contemporary technology. He soon
  made Trinit\xE9 available in the [[PostScript font format]], and this was followed
  by [[Lexicon]] (1992) also by [[Bram de Does]]. [[Renard]], by [[Fred Smeijers]],
  based on the types of [[Hendrik van den Keere]] followed. [[Ruse]], by Peter Matthias\u2019s
  father, [[Gerrit Noordzij]], and [[Collis]], by his brother [[Christoph Noordzij]]
  were released in 2000.\r\n\r\nBesides selling well designed and original typefaces
  to the general public, The Ensched\xE9 Font Foundry also does commissioned work
  on type, so called [[custom fonts]].\r\n\r\nURL: http://www.teff.nl"
