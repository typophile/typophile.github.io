  of typography. \r\n\r\nI was just wondering if you have any ideas of a typeface
  that would work well with URW Antiqua (specifically Alternative T Super)?\r\n\r\nLuckily
  I think Georgia works well with it in various forms, esp. for body text (I could
  be wrong?), but I'm looking for something a little less common, and with similar
  character to Antiqua, to use for the headings and other more prominent areas of
  text on a new website.\r\n\r\nYou can see the logo with Georgia here: http://www.finelysliced.com.au/old/\r\n\r\nThanks!
  I appreciate your help/expertise!"

  body: "If you're looking for fonts to use online, you might want to try <em>Baskerville</em>
    with <em>Baskerville Old Face</em> as a back up. The first come bundled with OSX,
    the second with MS Office 03 and 07 on a Windows PC, and MS Office 04 on a mac.
    (Add Georgia to be safe.)\r\n\r\nIf you're not looking for something web specific:
    perhaps <a href=\"http://typejockeys.com/type/6_Ingeborg\">Ingeborg</a> or <a
    href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/\">Scotch Modern</a>. I'd say the latter is more
    dramatic."
