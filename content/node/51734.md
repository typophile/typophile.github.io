body: "I just downloaded some calligraphic Hebrew fonts and while they appear on the
  font list they will appear within my InDesign CS 2 ME document. The files are FFIL
  and I have them installed in Linotype FontExplorer and within the font folder within
  Indesign. \r\n\r\nAnyone have any sugestions?\r\n\r\nI am using this program to
  create products for a new family business, www.mitzvahart.com\r\n\r\nThanks in advance
  for your help!"
