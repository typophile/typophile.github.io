    We&#39;ll keep an eye open for it.

  body: If Yves has given up, perhaps it&#39;s worth <BR>mentioning that <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/larabie/sui-generis/bold-italic/testdrive.html?s=NINESTAR&amp;p=48">Sui
    Generis</a> is similar, <BR>especially if it were stretched. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s
    not quite right though; the R is different.

  body: I was not exactly giving up, but nailing this one  <BR>might get a bit time-consuming,
    considering I  <BR>may have to do a full run of the FontBook and  <BR>some looking-up
    on a couple of websites. <BR> <BR>PS Robin the R is bugging me too. <BR> <BR>And
    thinking I recently got accused of only being  <BR>interested in money and refusing
    to do anything  <BR>for free. That hurt... :/

  body: There&#39;s always the chance that it was drafted by hand. I mean, it is a
    fairly plain, linear sans... <BR> <BR>Just a thought.

    <BR>It&#39;s a tricky beggar.

    thickbrickbook &#34;TYPO -who  when  why&#34; by  Friedl-Ott-Stein <BR>there is
    a small image of a font called CHINON  <BR>&#40;NO.. not cochin!!!!&#41; by Albert
    Boton   <BR> <BR>under the image it says Boton 1973 Chinon <BR> <BR>so i did a
    research but i could not find any Chinon <BR> <BR> <BR>anyway it is not slanted
    like the NINESTAR image above... and not so boldish...   but i got mad for not
    finding anything more on the web about Chinon... <BR> <BR>so this is really something
    for FontDetectives at Typophile...! <BR> <BR>what happened to Chinon? <BR>&#60;/font&#62;'
