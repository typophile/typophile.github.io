  what fonts I've designed here and\r\n        where they can be found. I'm proud
  to say that\r\n        some of my work for MTI can now be seen as\r\n        part
  of a demo for MTI's type layout engines:\r\n\r\nhttp://demo.monotypeimaging.com/itypewtle.aspx\r\n\r\n
  \       Look for the Univers OTS fonts in the pull-\r\n        down list (they are
  the first 6). I designed\r\n        the Arabic, Hebrew, and Thai versions. To see\r\n
  \       them in detail, bump up the PPM to a larger\r\n        size. It should reload
  automatically.\r\n\r\n"

    Is 'embolden' really a type term? \r\n\r\nEmboss is a legit graphic term. \r\n\r\nBut
    hmmm - I think embolden is not. Embolden means to to instill with boldness or
    courage. What do you guys say?"

    Can you tell us about that?

  body: "Eben,\r\n\r\nThanks for the kind words. But first off, I didn't\r\ndesign
    them in a vacuum--I work with some very\r\nsmart and talented people here at Monotype.\r\n\r\nYou're
    right about them having to be 'resilient'.\r\nThat particular suite of fonts is
    developed primarily\r\nfor use in mobile devices. I had to design within the\r\nrestrictions
    (e.g- reduced height, low res) many of\r\nthose devices have. And, of course,
    the text must\r\nalso perform in less than ideal viewing enviros.\r\n\r\n"
