body: "My question is on the old typewriters, before the electric typewriter, when
  typewriters had fixed type sizes.  Those sizes, if I correctly recall, were \"pica\"
  and \"elite.\"  One was 10 pts, and the the other was 12 pts. (I can't remember
  which was which).\r\n\r\nIf a form was printed, in those days, that was to be filled
  out using a typewriter, was the leading when using single spacing on the typewriter
  equivalent to the values used in modern software (12 pts. for 10 pt type and 14.4
  pts. for 12 pt. type)?\r\n\r\nIf not, does anyone remember the old typewriter single
  space leading values for those two type sizes?\r\n\r\nI tried several searches on
  this forum, without success.  Perhaps I did not use the correct search criteria.\r\n\r\nThank
  you."

    wouldn''t make any sense for it to be a 10 pt. equivalent) had 10 characters to

    leading (linespacing) value, 12 points. '

  body: "If I remember correctly (it's been a long time; but I did do a ton of research
    'cause I was really curious about all this) - for my Chandler 42 fonts, I measured
    everything directly from the typewriter and used that for my 10 point master (I
    was actually trying to do an exact copy of that machine) and the measurements
    were not consistent with typographic standards.\r\n \r\nBuried in the back of
    my head there's a note that says, 'typewriters have different measurements, don't
    trust them.' \r\n\r\nSo measuring them directly would be your best approach, that
    is a good suggestion.\r\n\r\nWhat I am positive about is each manufacturer had
    their own standards for developing their 'fonts' - and this was entirely based
    on their machinery, even the design of the letters themselves were drawn (large,
    at a drafting table) as one thin stroke, whereas the weight of the metal - when
    cast - would provide the weight.\r\n\r\nCourier's release changed all that. Kinda.
    It was the first time a typewriter manufacturer decided that there should be a
    standard.\r\n\r\nIf memory serves.\r\n\r\nsteve mehallo\r\ntinyurl.com/mehallofonts\r\nmehallo.com"

    confusion was causing me hell in the old (teaching) days. Pica and Elite (as in
    typewriters) describe the width of a character, not character size: Pica is 7.2
    pt wide (10 char/inch) and Elite is 6 pt wide (12 char/inch).'

    was called platen advance, and it was fixed, usually to six lines per inch. A
    few systems had the ability to advance a half line, but less than that meant the
    platen was not on a gear tooth, and was dangerous. \r\n\r\nI can't believe that

  body: "Normal typewriters in the English-speaking world indeed typed 6 lines to
    the inch (12 point) whether using pica (10 characters to the inch) or elite (12
    characters to the inch) characters.\r\n\r\nSince single-spaced elite typewriting
    included, effectively, leading, though, one <em>can</em>, if one wishes, consider
    elite type to be 10 point type - but if one does so, one should be careful about
    asserting that as an intrinsic property of the type instead of simply a choice
    one has personally made, because otherwise it would confuse people (no typewriter
    advanced 10/72 of an inch after printing a line of elite type).\r\n\r\nAt least
    one Swiss company, Hermes, made typewriters that put characters on the page with
    metric dimensions - 2.5 mm wide characters instead of pica, 2.0 mm wide instead
    of elite, and 1.5 mm was available for a typestyle called \"Economic\".\r\n\r\nI've
    seen an office manual typewriter made especially for government work, I believe,
    that typed 16 characters per inch and 8 lines per inch. And daisywheel typewriters
    often allowed the use of small 15 character per inch typefaces, since that fit
    in with the 1/60 inch unit that supported both pica and elite (and which was also
    often used for proportional spacing)."

  body: "Mechanically, if single-spaced Pica is 12 points on a 12-point body, then
    1 1/2 spaced is 12 points on an 18-point body, and double-spaced is 12 points
    on a 24-point body... and Elite is then 10 points, also on 12-point, 18-point,
    and 24-point bodies in those cases.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly true, on the other
    hand, that digital monospaced fonts come in only one version - and thus they can
    be in any point size, and their horizontal spacing will decrease proportionately
    as the point size is adjusted. So if you have a Pica typeface, then the 10-point
    version will have 12 characters per inch horizontal spacing - but things won't
    necessarily match up so well.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, the Pica version of Courier
    had basically the same character height as most Elite typefaces on the Selectric.
    If a digital version of Courier did not include the extra space, the 10 pitch
    version could therefore have a point size of 10 points instead of 12. But, as
    you've noted, with digital faces, spacing is often arbitrary. As well, digital
    faces seem to, at least by default, include considerable built-in leading."
