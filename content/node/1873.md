    So do I. Imagine that. <BR> <BR>&#62;<i>You never got any public credit for those
    faces, is that correct?</i> <BR> <BR>We never credited the designers in the Image
    Club or EyeWire catalogs, but we did include attributions <a href="http://www.eyewire.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/View.woa/wa/viewProduct-product=527.htm">on
    the web site</a>. In fact, you can still view them in amongst the broken remains
    of the EyeWire site. I was also fortunate &#40;or cursed&#41; enough to have <a
    href="http://www.eyewire.com/magazine/profiles/hutchinson/index.htm">a designer
    profile</a> written about my type exploits back when I was still at EyeWire. <BR>
    <BR>&#62;<i>I see that Identifont has you in its database now. Woohoo!</i> <BR>
    <BR>Yep. I&#39;m very happy to see that finally in place too. I emailed back and
    forth with David Johnson-Davies quite a bit to get all the Image Club information
    properly cleaned up and cross-referenced. Plus I was able to give him all of the
    nit-picky designer credits from my type library database. <BR> <BR>&#62;<i>Did
    you have a script face in the TypeCon gallery?</i> <BR> <BR>Oops. That was mis-credited
    at TypeCon. I did the design of the sample, not the typeface. The typeface was

    Do you know what Agfa/Monotype&#39;s &#40;A/MT&#41;arrangement with Image Club
    fonts <BR>is? <BR> <BR>Why do I ask? At $42 USD a pop, these fonts are priced
    considerably higher <BR>than most other fonts from Fonts.com. This leads suspicious
    me to a &#40;probably <BR>naive &amp; inaccurate&#41; possible conclusion of A/MT
    the sales of these fonts, but at <BR>a price point they know won&#39;t fly. Eventually
    they&#39;re able to buy out all rights to <BR>the fonts at a fire sale price.
    I&#39;m probably way off base here, but with older fonts <BR>at $22 and new releases
    at $22 to $32, something seems amiss. <BR> <BR>3&#41; Does the Image Club branding
    still exist in any way. It certainly isn&#39;t revealed <BR>on Fonts.com. <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;m really glad that A/MT kept the IC fonts alive, but I&#39;ve followed
    them through <BR>their various homes and I&#39;m curious about their current home.

  body: '&#62;<i>1&#41; Thanks for the link to Stephen&#39;s Stockholm typography

    <BR> <BR>&#62;<i>2&#41; Do you know what Agfa/Monotype&#39;s arrangement with
    Image Club fonts is?</i> <BR> <BR>My understanding is that AMT purchased the Image
    Club Type Library, the associated trademarks and the EyeWire website from Getty
    Images. They did <b>not</b> purchase the remaining Image Club or EyeWire products
    such as the clip art or stock images&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#62;<i>Why do I ask? At $42
    USD a pop, these fonts are priced considerably higher</i> <BR>&#62;<i>than most
    other fonts from Fonts.com. This leads suspicious me to a &#40;probably</i> <BR>&#62;<i>naive

    probably way off base here, but</i> <BR>&#62;<i>with older fonts at $22 and new
    releases at $22 to $32, something seems amiss.</i> <BR> <BR>The current pricing
    for the Image Club single faces is certainly higher than they were at EyeWire.
    Although, I always thought that they were underpriced to begin with. I don&#39;t
    think there&#39;s any conspiracy here, I suspect that AMT understands that there
    was some pent up demand for those faces during the dead period of the EyeWire
    business. Since they already own the library, I don&#39;t think there is any advantage
    to positioning them for failure. <BR> <BR>Of course, I may be a bit biased in
    my opinions on this subject. <BR> <BR>&#62;<i>3&#41; Does the Image Club branding
    still exist in any way.</i> <BR>&#62;<i>It certainly isn&#39;t revealed on Fonts.com</i>
    <BR> <BR>Other than on my hard drive and in my Image Club archives, I don&#39;t
    think so. Agfa certainly isn&#39;t going to be using the Image Club name or brand
    for anything. AMT&#39;s own branding currently wavers between schizophrenic and
    that glutinous mass of sub-brands and third-party products on the Fonts.com site.
    I can&#39;t see them doing any Image Club specific marketing, even if they do
    own the brand now. <BR> <BR>&#62;<i>I&#39;m really glad that A/MT kept the IC
    fonts alive, but I&#39;ve followed them</i> <BR>&#62;<i>through their various
    homes and I&#39;m curious about their current home.</i> <BR> <BR>I&#39;m pleased
    they got picked up as well, although in their current state &#40;missing formats,
    missing weights, strange pricing, no full collection&#41; - I wonder how long
    they&#39;ll last. <BR> <BR>&#62;<i>4&#41; Nice work on east Bloc.</i> <BR> <BR>Thanks.
    It seems so long ago...'
