  a scan of page 14 of \"Elementarteilchen\", english \"Atomised\" from Michel Houellebecq.\r\nSeems
  to be a tricky font - no results with \"What the font\" or the like.\r\n\r\nThe
  \"?\" and the \"\xDF\" are strikingly.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for the help!\r\nDavid\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/human_4627.jpg]"
