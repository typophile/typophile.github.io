    therein:\r\nhttp://www.pilcrowtype.com/blog/the-ever-useful-rotalic\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s

    remember that some typedesigner did a \u2018true Rotalic\u2019, i.e. one where
    subsequent letters rotate increasingly, so that, within a line, a full Roly Poly
    is performed. Can\u2019t find it back, though \u2013\_must have been on Twitter.\r\n\r\nEdit:
    Here it is, preserved by Indra. It was Frederik:\r\nhttp://kupferschrift.de/cms/2011/07/new-ideas-for-book-typography/"

  body: "Ah, thanks for the correction, and the links!\r\n\r\nBTW, I remember seeing
    a photo of a London Olympics merchandise store where -like you've done- they had
    rotated a line of Hague's font so the letters look upright (sitting on a diagonal
    line). I wonder if they'd done that to make it look \"normal\".\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "So the term is at least that old, but that example hardy deserves it (it's
    just an Oblique).\r\n\r\nBTW is it possible the font was called \"Rotalic\"? Although
    I don't know if that would disqualify it as a terminological precedent.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
