  from left to right there's 4 pages. Please tell me which type looks best here and
  what can be done to refine it at it's best.\r\n\r\nThe ones in dark using a 4HB
  pencil are the ones Id like to choose from, but let me know what is suitable and
  whatwould be the best way to refine it if it needs any.\r\n\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n"

  body: that is an interesting approach but that would be a very difficult approach
    too in a script type i think.

    have much space.  hrant: what is your opinion of the type though? '

    think it's cool, but first of all: What best fits the style of the work done at
    the studio, and what kind of clients does the studio want to attract? Beyond the
    appeal-in-a-vacuum of scripty, blocky, etc. samples, what really makes the most
    sense?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "thanks  riccardo and hrant. hrant that link you posted is gorgeous blocky
    type. \r\nTo answer your other question the studio is just about graphic design
    in general.  This is for me actually. I thought of using  a blocky lettering so
    as to get it into a 2x2 grid since it's ny/43, the squarish has a nice touch i
    thought like the \"i love ny \" logo.\r\nas for the script lettering, the inspiration
    came from the yankees and electrical posts that  have those numbers that are bulky
    and curvy. I also ersonally like script because it's got some elegance to it. "

  body: It is good that you are thinking of how things look, aesthetics. But for branding/identity
    work, what is really important is what it communicates. A basic brief would describe
    the key messages the brand should communicate, and who the audience is that the
    brand is targeting. These are fairly objective and concrete ideas compared to
    the aesthetic opinions of a bunch of online type designers. There really is no
    design studio that does general graphic design. They all have strengths and weaknesses,
    particular types of clients they attract and work well with, projects that really
    fit their skills, etc. To attract clients your brand should communicate the strengths
    and not be general. Your potential clients will find someone who is great at what
    they are looking for and choose them over a general solution. I hope that is helpful
    to you!

  body: "thanks for the insight LumaVine.  As for the branding of it I was confident
    about going with a plain customised lettering. It was the type that I wanted to
    see if it fit into the scheme of things. All in all I've decided to go against
    this whole concept and infact change the name even because it was restricting
    me from communicating to clients to some degree and the \"43\" part was limiting
    the design to a very out of focus element in the design. \r\n\r\nThanks!"
