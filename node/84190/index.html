  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Just starting out here. First &lsquo;real&rsquo; design job and I&rsquo;ve hit a bump in the road&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a bit confused about buying licenses to use fonts. I know that it&rsquo;s a requirement but have no clue about them.
When designing a logo for a company to use on a website and print, the designer/ client needs a license to use it right?
Do I (the designer) buy the license or does the client? And which type of license is required? Is it purchased when buying the font?</p>
<p>Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>Alternatively does anyone know any free alternatives to DIN light and DIN 1415?</p>

But that is it contains a law basis which will legalize you use the relevant font. As a designer, you could have a cost for the client to license the font, but it means the license&rsquo;s font belongs to your client. It all depends on your agreement with them.</p>

<p>You usually buy the licence and get the font for free with it. Oh, they say you&rsquo;re buying a font, but you&rsquo;re not. Read it (the licence) really carefully (this is a good time for deerstalker and magnifier) for it details&ndash;or at least should detail&ndash;what you may and mayn&rsquo;t do with the font.</p>
<p>The logo designer will need a licence for the fonts (s)he uses. The client? If your client  is using the font to produce new text, then yes. If the client is just rubberstamping with a pre-prepared logo, (s)he will probably not need hir own licence.</p>
<p>The folk behind the &ldquo;Open Letter to Monotype&rdquo; (see thread of same name) have been doodling a freely-available DIN type, if I remember correctly.</p>

<p>Your comment shows how smart you are listening to other comments.</p>
<p><strong>Check the EULA</strong>. Even if you get a free font. you are still bound by the EULA.</p>
<p>It was all about fairness between the font designers, graphic (logo) designers (first party client) and or the second party clients. It all depends on who the end user, IMHO</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>To add simple answers to your questions:
Whoever INSTALLS the fonts needs a license in the name of the user or company where the fonts are INSTALLED. 
It usually doesn&rsquo;t matter what the fonts are used for. If your clients just get PDFs, logos converted to vector graphics and so on, they don&rsquo;t need a license.</p>
<p>And in addition to Andi’s comment: 
It doesn&rsquo;t matter how the money flows. You might charge your client for purchasing the font license, but that doesn’t mean they own it then or could use the font. Nor could you grant them permission to do so. The only thing that matters is, which user (licensee) is specified in the font license.</p>

<p>It shouldn&rsquo;t, but there are common (though not universal) exceptions. Typically, you can&rsquo;t use the type created from the font as part of a commercial product (like kid&rsquo;s blocks using the letters as the design). And, often, you&rsquo;re not allowed to embed the font without a separate license (in a PDF, as part of software, etc.)</p>
<p>Some foundries also require separate licenses for identity work (for instance, I believe House requires a separate license if you want to use their fonts in a logo).</p>

Any advice would be great; I’m not very computer literate so have trouble with all language on the site. I really resent buying from them, I understand the value of intellectual property but the sarcastic tone of their website is really off putting. I also can’t find anything on the House website about a royalty or licence to the Neutra family or to the Eames Foundation; maybe they do but I couldn’t find it. If anyone has any suggestions about a similar font, happy to pay for it but just want the freedom to use it,that would be really helpful. I have bought fonts before from the font factory and didn’t have any trouble using them.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I did read that but was unsure about the &lsquo;embedding&rsquo;. I think I have to pay $US250 to do this plus the fee for the font. Which is fine but I&rsquo;m unsure if I need to.If I design the logo with a House font then use it on a pdf will that work ? I&rsquo;m sorry I&rsquo;m sure it is very tiresome for all you experts to have to deal with individuals who aren’t as familiar as you are, with how this all works… I was hoping I could buy a font from the website then design my little logo and send out my little letter heads to the printer to get printed…but I think I will have to employ a designer to do this. MB why the curt response, if I responded to my clients in the same belittling manner then I wouldn’t need a bloody letter head at all.I have no problem paying for their IP and respect the design process. I did email Dion Neutra who said that House Industries do pay a royalty; which is great. I will try to contact them again, which would be my third email to them in as many months.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I am not sure if all the questions have been answered, but if it were me, I would only use the logo as outlines, and never as text.  This of course avoids any issues with font embedding, and allows you some level of control over people modifying your logo (consistency is key in branding).  You probably want to manually adjust kerning and spacing to fit your project too, and it is a bit risky to assume those attributes will carry over if you bring your logo into a program as text.  Anyway, my point is that you should convert your final design to outlines to make your logo design master, usually *.eps format.</div>
