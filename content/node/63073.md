body: "I have been trying to find any information on how to print secret messages.
  The concept is simple, print a message in red with a blue pattern over the top to
  disguise the message. The recipient would then use a blue-filmed set of glasses
  to filter the blue pattern and reveal the message. Over the years, I have subscribed
  to over a half dozen different design magazines and could have sworn I saw a how
  to article on this very subject. But, wouldn't you know it, when I actually want
  to attempt this technique, I can't find the article.\r\n\r\nThanks for any assistance
  you may provide.\r\n\r\nMark"
