  Sans released\r\n\r\nMorris Sans, two of the weights\r\nDesigned by Dan Reynolds
  for Linotype GmbH.\r\n\r\nFrom the Linotype website: Morris Sans\u2122 is a newly
  revised and extended version of a small geometric family of typefaces originally
  produced by Morris Fuller Benton in 1930 for ATF. His initial design consisted of
  an alphabet of squared capital letters with a unique twist that characterized its
  appearance: corners with rounded exteriors and right-angle interiors. The types
  were intended for use in the fine print found on business cards, banking or financial
  forms, and contracts. But over the ensuing decades, this design became a popular
  element in all sorts of design environments, and several foundries revived the typeface
  in digital form. Since digital fonts are bicameral, with slots for both upper and
  lowercase letters, new cuts of the type opted filled the lowercase slots with small
  caps.\"\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Danno-Morris_6317.png]"

    of Morris Sans I was actually suspecting that the original weight in Bank Gothic

    Linotype had old Ikarus data for the caps of the medium weight, normal width font.
    I cleaned this up and used it. The rest of the letters that I drew for the Medium
    were designed to optically match these, so of course they are lighter than the
    caps themselves. \r\n\r\nThe other five fonts in the family were designed this
    one. So, the Medium cap glyphs are more or less \"historic,\" and everything else
    is bult to harmonize around them. So I guess we agree! The caps had to maintain
    their weight. If the non-cap glyphs were any darker, they'd be too happy.\r\n\r\nIn
    an ideal face, designed for legibility, one would start with the lowercase letters,
    and then draw the capital letters."
