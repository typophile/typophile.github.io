  the typeface regularly used on the cover of vintage Harlequin romance novels, but
  so far I've had no luck.\r\n\r\nThe good news is I have an extensive sample character
  set:\r\nhttps://dl.dropbox.com/u/17582217/FileChute/harlequin_sample.png\r\n\r\nIt's
  not Tiffany, though some of the letters are clearly close. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone have
  any guesses? This is driving me crazy!\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for any help!\r\n"

  body: "Your effort to post an extensive set of letters is appreciated. \r\nI suspect
    this is a font the company uses for its brand image and would not wish to see
    it sold or elsewhere. \r\nCopyright laws, at least in USA, suggest that if you
    did get a copy of the digital data for the font it would probably be unwise to
    use it. \r\nAs for the base font, i.e. before the swashes, one of our typophiles
    may identify a spot on match. So far I have not found a full match with the spurless
    C & S, outbowed legs on K & R, left cusp at the apex of A, and splayed M. Your
    letters have some resemblance to <a href=\"https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/tiempos-headline/\">Tiempos
    Headline Bold</a>.\r\nDon"

  body: "Thank you very much for your help, Don. As disappointing as the answer might
    be, it makes much more sense now. And at least I know I'm not missing some obvious
    answer everyone else could spot in a second. \r\n\r\nIt's for a Harlequin parody,
    so although I still need to match the font, I can work with what I have and cobble
    together a few names.\r\n\r\nWho'd have thought Harlequin Presents would be so
    crafty?\r\n\r\nThanks again for the answer. You've saved me a lot of time!\r\n\r\nSean\r\n\r\n"

  body: it's a large and very identifiable brand. they have a large team of creatives
    that run different lines within the company to make sure the appearance of their
    books is consistent.

    salad days [1970s]. The heavy swash also fits that era. I trust there are apologies
    to Beatrix Potter for the tribulations of the character channeling her her bunny
    rabbits :)\r\nDon"
