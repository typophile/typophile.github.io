  for an upcoming portfolio scholarship exhibition.  I settled on desiging a political
  magazine that is aimed at college aged young adults and more creative types.  I
  settled on the name Ars Politica (our politics) and right now im testing out different
  fonts for the header/logo.  I'm trying to create some typographic contrast by using
  two different font styles because i want the header to feel political yet youthful
  and fresh at the same time.  As of now i have about a dozen or so options but im
  none of them are particularly jumping out at me. So i could really use any suggestions/comments
  on whichs ones work/don't work and what other layouts or fonts might be good to
  use.\r\n"

    brief, id be considering Gotham, by Hoefler & Frere Jones - also  they have some
    other really nice fonts that Gotham combines well with, such as Mercury. that
    combo would give you a great starting point... \r\n\r\n\r\ncheck their site out
    at typography.com\r\n\r\njust a thought.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    politics, I'd definitely avoid Gotham - right now, it's strongly associated with
    Obama.  Unless that's what you'd want, in which case great!\r\n\r\n---\r\neeblet.com"

  body: "well, lets see, I have to agree, looking at your logos didn't inspire 'political
    magazine' they were more like 'website' to me.\r\n\r\nTake a look though political
    magazines at the bookstore.\r\n\r\nFrom what I've been able to tell, most successful
    and long-term magazines use simple beautiful typography, and don't rely on imagery
    or new typefaces.\r\n\r\nThink of Esquire, Time, and Harpers (the oldest magazine,
    and still in regular print)\r\n\r\nI think you can pull off something that hits
    the mark better than your current concepts because of the skill you've already
    shown.\r\n\r\nbest of luck, and remember, like copmany logos, sometimes the best
    and most recognizable are the simplest (Sony, Panasonic, Toshiba, Microsoft, IBM,
    Yale)"
