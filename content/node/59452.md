  nuptials.\r\nI am trying to portray unity through connecting swashes & ornamentation
  without\r\nlosing the legibility of the words. The wedding colors are cream and
  lightish pink and the flowers are lilies and roses. The wedding is pretty upscale
  and the bride is a girly girl.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am stumped just now; what do you guys
  and girls think of what I have so far?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nRachel\r\n\r\nps I am open
  to crit/comments on anything/everything (type, concept, ligatures, legibility on
  a projection screen (worried about this) (not quite sure how large/far away the
  screens will be), contrast, whatever!\r\n"

    to know whose wedding they''re at, it''s time to close the bar. '

    it your a might run into the swash leg of the R so you might need to fiddle with
    it. The J and o could be kerned a tiny bit too. '
