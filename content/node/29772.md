  me crazy. It just looks different than the rest of the face. I am attaching a picture

    of a type design addiction - consider yourself warned!  :-)\r\n\r\nIt's OK to
    modify a glyph whenever you think it's a good idea. Some people would say that
    you need to check the EULA (the licensing agreement) to make sure that's allowed,
    but in my book as long as the results don't leave your own hard drive you're always
    OK. Sometimes you're even OK if it leaves your drive, but then you really should
    check the EULA and probably contact the font house in question.\r\n\r\nSome others
    like to see fonts as works of art, and not open to tinkering. I think this attitude
    is very anti-design - but it does have proponents (like see some of the posts
    in the thread linked below).\r\n\r\nThe real problem is that it's quite hard to
    modify a good font and end up with something better. You need to be -almost- as
    good as the original designer. Almost, because everybody makes mistakes, and often
    it's easier for an outsider to see a problem and fix it (although the latter is
    qualitatively harder). In this case it seems like a very gentle change, and as
    a rule that's the most a novice can get away with.\r\n\r\nHere's an old thread
    that might be quite educational:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/14378\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    if you don't like the licence, find one more to your liking -- there are plenty
    of foundries who allow mods to their fonts, such as mine; I don't know what the
    AG EULA stipulates.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think it's a shame to tinker with old faces.
    Drastic systematic fontwide action is cool, but you gotta figure that the original
    designer was totally in the zone, or else the typeface would be in the trash can
    of history by now, not a classic. So everything is in perfect balance, and if

    If a font house has an unreasonable EULA, it will suffer the consequences of human
    behavior. If you don't like it, find a field unaffected by humans.\r\n\r\n> you
    gotta figure that the original designer was totally in the zone\r\n\r\nThere's
    really no reason to think that. Just look at Mrs Eaves: obviously flawed spacing,
    but a very very popular font. Perfect balance? No such thing, ever, especially
    not decades and certainly not centuries later. A font is not a painting inspired
    by the Muses; it's a worldly tool, with always room for improvement.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "<em>it\u2019s a worldly tool</em>\r\n\r\nExactly. Any succesful type is successful
    in its world, tuned to the needs of that world. Its success proves its usability
    and its merit, but that does not make it faultless, as Henry Petroski argues in
    <em>The Evolution of Useful Things</em>. Failure is the mother of invention, he
    says, prompting inventors to try to better what they perceive as the defects of
    existing products, but, \"What constitutes failure and what improvement is not
    totally objective, for in the final analysis a considerable list of criteria,
    ranging from the functional to the aesthetic, from the economic to the moral,
    come into play.\"\r\n\r\nSo one might point to a type such as AG or Mrs Eaves
    and say, \"but look at its flaws\" -- but how can one be so sure that it is successful
    despite those features, rather than because of them? The only thing to do is to
    try and make a better tool, and see if it works. So enough already with the Eaves
    critique, let's see your Baskerville.\r\n\r\nI must admit, I've tinkered with
    faces, my own and others (where licencing permitted), producing custom versions
    for clients. But I would still argue that the originals of classic faces have
    acquired a state of grace through the passage of time, which puts a barrier between
    today's redesigner and the ability to perceive all the subtle interplay of design
    themes which created the balance of the face, enabling it to come into being and
    function smoothly within the ecology of its own time -- which is why I caution
    against tinkering with the old ones. (But a radical makeover is another matter.)
    At the very least, you can be sure that quite a few people have become accustomed
    to, and fond of what you may consider its annoying quirks, as Muzzer opines.\r\n\r\nSo
    I'm pretty much in agreement with the comments in your first post, Hrant.\r\n\r\nFrom
    my own experience, I think designers get in a zone when they're working. I've
    picked up a face I've put on hold for a while, and come across two files named
    A and B, and then I try and remember whether I was happy with the final round
    of changes I made or not. So I look at the fonts and I can't immediately see any
    difference, but obviously at the time I thought there was some very important
    fine tuning going on. Most disturbing of all was when I tried to do a condensed
    version of something I did 20 years earlier, and just couldn't get in the zone
    at all. \r\n"

    Who hasnt?? Although I like it in metal better, the 2 doesn;t  worry me at all.
    Think when it was designed mate, Nick is right when he says that the designer
    is in the zone. It was his choice to do it, and if you don't like it then don't
    use it. But just fiddling with a tiny little bit to fix everything is like airbrushing
    chicks to make the prettier. Or putting a spoiler on a holden to make it look
    cool like all those dickhead boyracers.  \r\n\r\nHrant reckons there is always
    room for improvement. This is kinda true, but he also says there is no such thing
    as perfection so you'll end up going in ever diminishing circles. \r\n\r\nIf you
    want to 'fix it' then start from scratch and make your own typeface. I bet you'll
    learn heaps about the choices that were made!!\r\n\r\nGood on yer mate. \r\n\r\nMuzz."

    about thinking clearly. So for example claiming that Mrs Eaves's poor spacing

    poor spacing.\r\n\r\n> So enough already with the Eaves critique\r\n\r\nBTW, why

    not amplify it.\r\n\r\n> you\u2019ll end up going in ever diminishing circles.\r\n\r\nOnly

    mentioned it a lot more than he has, and in a more combative tone. Also, I don't
    believe he's working on a Baskerville revival. While there's nothing wrong with
    making a good theoretical argument, at some point we'd like to see the rubber
    hit the road.\r\n\r\n<em>So for example claiming that Mrs Eaves\u2019s poor spacing

    of its spacing, but that the spacing contributes to its general effect, which
    is what's popular. So something which may be dysfunctional in one aspect of a
    type's functionality can be positive in some other respect. The principal is that
    the designer brings the work to a state of completion, a balanced wholeness. That's
    not to say that the work is perfect, merely that it's in a state of balance."

    such a landmark example of how popularity works: not based on qualities that the
    \"involved\" tend to worry about. Mrs Eaves has something important to teach,
    something still generally ignored, and something that Licko certainly did not

    from the EULA and other issues, just looking at your 2 makes me realize how good
    the original is. The problem with a 2 is always to get that middle curve to turn
    all the way back into the head, which points the other way. Your re-designed head
    is too short, lacks that sharp incision at the end and make the number lean to
    the right. Your design is timid, the original is daring.\r\n\r\nI redesigned only
    one AG number once, when i did the Old Style numbers for the Light weight, back
    in 1988 or so for Berthold\u2019s stationery. That set of O/S figures was never
    supposed to be published, altough eventually it did. Having to fit those two curves
    into the small x-height was very difficult and made me appreciate the original
    even more. All the normal 2s are so safe and boring, with their reversed S-shape.
    That swan neck swoop is both daring and unique! I tried it with Meta, but i chickened
    out of it with Officina."
