body: "As it happens, one of the jobs that pay my bills is laying out a journal on
  welfare and social policies published twice a month by a no profit research institute.\r\nThe
  journal is entering its fortieth year of continuous publication, and, while studying
  how to deal with the \u201Cdeath of print\u201D, we would also like to refresh its
  printed appearance.\r\nMy goal is to add some white space/flexibility and some typographic
  niceties (such as proper small caps and old style numerals).\r\nConstrains are mostly
  due to a next to inexistent budget (cram as much text as possible per page, use
  only already available fonts) and a mostly aging readership (don\u2019t make the
  text too small).\r\nAttached there\u2019s a first draft of the revised layout.\r\nAny
  kind of criticism is welcome."

    the headline smaller and/or if available a type with more character for this purpose.\r\nThe
    figures of the footnotes in the margin stand too far apart."

  body: "Perfectly reasonable choices for this subject matter \u2014 Myriad and Chaparral.
    And the grid you have set up is working well for this document.\r\n\r\nHave you
    considered ragged right alignment? The narrow columns especially could gain from
    that approach \u2014 you wouldn't have to struggle with gaps between the words,
    such as \u201Ce 2009, Guida web\u201D in the far right column on page 1.\r\n\r\nLooking
    at page 4, the condensed Myriad text that appears under \u201CI progetti in atto
    e gli sviluppi previsti\u201D is a little overwhelming. I understand the constraints
    you outlined, but this block does seemed crammed. Any possibility of letting that
    particular info breathe a little?"

  body: On p3, the "Sistemi informativi" at the bottom looks confusingly like the
    "Gli output e i risultati" subheading above. Should it be moved under the line
    (or should the line be extended over it)?

  body: "Thank you very much for the comments so far. They\u2019re very thoughtful
    and helpful, and I will try to implement the suggestions as soon as possible.\r\nJuergen:
    Do you think I should reduce the white space between headline and body too? As
    for typeface with more character, I see what you mean, but our titles tend to
    be on the longish side, with very long words (things like \u201Cesternalizzazione\u201D
    or \u201Ctossicodipendente\u201D) and that\u2019s one of the reasons why I choose
    Myriad Condensed. But maybe a Smaller size Chaparral can work.\r\nAs for footnote
    references, you\u2019re absolutely right. And that will teach me to trust more
    my eyes and less measurements. I think I will need to find a way to align the
    reference numbers to the right (see page 5, for example).\r\nJohn: I too would
    prefer ragged right for footnotes. Problem is, I\u2019m not very good at tweaking
    hyphenation & justification settings, and, with the defaults, ragged text has
    many more line breaks than justified text.\r\nAs for the Myriad text, you\u2019re
    right. I need to find a different solution for boxed text, and use Myriad Condensed
    just for real tabular data and headings.\r\nCraig: I see what you mean. The line
    don\u2019t extend across the page in order to give a stronger visual clue that
    (especially in odd pages) \u201CProspettive Sociali e Sanitarie\u201D isn\u2019t
    directly related with the column above it. I will experiment different solutions
    (do you think that changing the appearance of \u201CSistemi informativi\u201D
    will suffice? Suggestions on how change it?).\r\n"

  body: "Riccardo,\r\nYes, if you are reducing the size of the Myriad headline i would
    also reduce the white space beneath. And ragged right setting for the footnotes
    would look definitely better; the column is too narrow for a decent justified
    setting in this type size."

  body: "Good improvements. Some more suggestions:\r\n\r\nFirstly, I would keep the
    figures a bit further away from the footnotes. You might almost double the space
    that is there right now.\r\n\r\nSecondly, I suggest using the proper OpenType
    superscript figures that come with Chaparral (at least with the version I have
    licensed) for reference numbers. In the footnote formatting options, you will
    have to set the position to \u2018Normal\u2019 and apply an appropriately defined
    character style.\r\n\r\nThirdly, small caps would probably look good in the \u2018Bibliografia\u2019
    for the names in front of the brackets and contribute to structuring the list.
    Maybe you want to try lining figures in this section, which tend to look less
    busy."

  body: I'm not sure how much attention people usually pay to vertical rythm, but
    I would've set the leading for each level in your hierarchy "in beat" with your
    body leading, and also aligned the side notes to the bottom line.

  body: "This is a nice design for this sort of publication. I think it reads well
    while being very efficient and professional in appearance. However, the color
    of the standfirst looks a little light to me, especially if this will be printed
    offset. Is it Chaparral Light Italic? With the extra leading there, you may find
    Italic Subhead (non-Light) to give better color.\r\n\r\nI agree with Frode about
    the leading - the heads seem a little out of rhythm with the text, especially
    when they fall at the top of a column. And I would suggest using oldstyle figures
    for the numbering of the notes in the margin and agree with R. that it would be
    better to use true superscript figures (lining) for the note reference numbers
    in the text. In the bulleted list, the space between the bullets and their text
    is a little large, relative to the size of the bullets. Perhaps move the bullets
    to the right some? Also, I would probably put nota 12 above the bibliografia."

  body: "Thanks again, later I will post the revised layout. In the meantime, some
    notes:\r\nAbout proper superscript figures: absolutely! That was just an oversight
    from my part. Proper superscripts were one of the reasons I choose Chaparral in
    the first place (even if maybe I will need to make them a little bigger than default).
    I just would have liked them linked to the superscript feature of InDesign...
    \r\nAbout oldstyle figures for the numbering of the notes, I'm with Frode on this
    one: I think in this case lining figures, being more consistent, work better as
    visual markers.\r\nAbout subheads alignment: They are (sort of) aligned:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/subhead1_5674.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/subhead2_5561.png]\r\nThey're
    spaced so that, no matter how many lines long they will be, they maintain the
    baseline rythm of the column(s). The clumsiness at start of columns could be mitigated
    by a paragraph ruler above, but that would clutter the page."

  body: "Frode: <cite>Why number the notes with old style figures? Think hierarchy!</cite>\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    this is a European vs. Anglo-American difference. It looks odd to me because the
    first line of the note as a whole, including its number, forms a single element
    of text, and varying figure styles within that element seems inconsistent without
    actually conveying anything to the reader. I probably wouldn't use lining figures
    for the note numbers unless the notes used lining figures altogether."

  body: "I've attached a new iteration. Here's the changelog:\r\n- Tried a different
    approach to main headlines.\r\n- For the standfirst, as much as I would like to
    use Chaparral's opticals, unfortunately they're not included with Adobe CS3. I
    tried the non-light italic. Better colour?\r\n- Aligned footnotes to the bottom,
    eliminated any other alignment with the baseline.\r\n- Slightly wider space between
    text and reference numbers of notes.\r\n- Also applied Semibold to reference figures
    and made them a tiny bit smaller than text.\r\n- Proper superscript figures for
    in-text reference figures (too small?).\r\n- Tweaked a bit more the dreaded text
    box at page 4.\r\n- Reduced space between bullets and text, used bold bullets,
    also moved a bit to the right.\r\n- Used small caps for bibliography's authors.
    Decided against lining figures, especially because of small caps ;-)\r\n\r\nAs
    for David (archaica)'s suggestion about placing notes above bibliography, it sure
    make more sense (the notes pertaining to the main text, etc.), but I preferred
    to leave the more visual clue of notes always being placed on bottom right."

  body: "I like the color of the standfirst better this way. It has lost some delicacy,
    which I guess is what you used the Light Italic for, and which maybe the Subhead
    optical could have retained. But given the constraints, I prefer the new version.
    Again, this assumes offset printing. For digital printing, where type tends to
    gain weight rather than losing it, the Light might be OK. \r\n\r\nThe reference
    numbers in the text for the notes look much better. However, noting your concern
    about \"aging readership\", if you think they're too small you could cheat by
    using the numerator figures rather than the superscript figures. They're a little
    bigger and lower but will still be easily understood by any reader as superscripts."
