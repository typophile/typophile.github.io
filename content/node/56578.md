  I'm interested in learning to write/draw letters of various types (serif, sans-serif,
  dispay) mainly for the use in titling, display and short texts. So I'm looking for
  a good manual to teach me these things. I know several cartoonists also do some
  great lettering (Chris Ware for instance), so any books from this field would also
  be very welcome.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\ncheerio Queneau\r\n\r\n\r\nPS: I've tried
  to search in the typophile database before I started this thread, but it gave no
  results at all. Is there some problem with the search engine?"

    It's to make letters from scratch, not just redoing a font by hand. Of course
    I'm already drawing a way for a long time time now, I was just looking for some
    pointers to give me some directions, showing some possibilities. \r\n\r\n@Phrostbite:
    It's a real shame these sign painting manuals are so darn expensive, cause they

    Sign Museum]]. Those Speedball manuals are usually available on eBay although
    more recent editions are more common and cheaper. Most, if not all, of the plates
    from the Atkinson at the top of the list were still available recently in a book
    called \"A Book Of Art Nouveau Alphabets And Ornamental Designs\" which was published
    by Main Street Press. I think this might be what they are referring to as the
    1980s & '90s editions. You should find that on Abe or Amazon. \r\n\r\nOld lettering
    books do sometimes appear very cheaply on Abe. I think the professional second-hand
    dealers mark them down because they've got a few paint splashes or pencil drawings
    in them, but that actually adds to the charm."

  body: I would have to agree with David here. If you trace a couple different styles
    of type, your hand will start to become used to the 'movement' of the type. From
    there, you can do what I do and draw yourself a baseline, x and cap height on
    a piece of paper then draw that same type freehand. Even if your new drawings
    aren't perfect 'tracings' you're still teaching your brain and arm how type flows.
    You're essentially creating the Queneau Caslon or Queneau Bodoni or Queneau Fette
    Fraktur. Get it?

  body: "<em>Hand lettering is not something you trace and draw.</em>\r\n\r\nIt can
    be. There are many techniques of lettering, including the \"built up\" method,
    which is basically drawing the outline of the letters and then filling them in.
    You will see this covered in most how-to books about lettering. The page on the
    Letterheads site describes the typical method of showcard lettering, in which
    production speed and efficiency is most important, and usually only a brush and
    a minimum number of strokes is used for the finished lettering."

  body: "Interesting pointers guys! Thanks!\r\n\r\n@David and Dave: You're probably
    right that it might still be good training to trace letters, so I will probably
    do this as well. Freehand lettering is more my 'thang' though. As to which methods
    I would likely use: as I said earlier it is not really calligraphy, but more like
    the \"built up\" method Mark described. In that sense it's closer to drawing than
    writing I presume. I don't know how people learnt this before, and this is what
    I'm interested in. I don't think I will start making fonts from my drawings any
    time soon, they are more one offs, and would lack the consitancy and characters
    to make it into one.\r\n\r\n@Phrostbyte: Thanks for the link, that's great! You
    have a point about lettering, though I'm likely to combine the method you talk
    about (using a brush to form the letters) with the \"built up\" method. I'll be
    using it for more 'expressive' purposes, probably not for extended pieces of text
    (though I might use it for this in the future)\r\n\r\n@Stephen: thanks for the
    link! I once attended a lecture by Wigger Bierma (from Werkplaats Typografie)
    and he also stressed this difference, with a certain disdain for lettering. He
    definately thought typography was a higher and nobler discipline than mere lettering.
    I don't share his views though :) I think they both have their using and can be
    used side by side. I won't give up the one for the other that for sure! \r\n\r\ncheerio

  body: "Queneau\r\n\r\nEDIT: to me the difference between calligraphy and lettering
    (as I practice it) is that the form that is laid down is not the \"final word.\"
    I futz with it for hours on end!\r\n\r\nThis is a tough topic to tackle... there
    are many facets to \"hand\" lettering. You are seeing the schisms as people post.
    Different people consider lettering to be different things (I noticed that you
    eschewed calligraphy BUT you have to remember that is is an integral part of understanding
    the tools). Tools can include the pencil and tracing paper, as well as ruling
    pens, chisel edged pens, brushes, round pens, square pens, pointed pens etc. ad
    infinitum. Then you can get into the division of commercial lettering artists,
    sign painters, sho card artists etc. (once again). What was lettering in the twenties
    is not the lettering of today. Engrossing is not the same as lettering of the
    '50's and is not the same as today. What they did for movie posters is not the
    same as they did for titling on product... is not the same as they did for grocery
    store windows... so you can see that it is a DIVERSE field.\r\n\r\nIt is funny,
    as many of my lettering heroes reside in different camps. Some are calligraphers,
    others are sho card artists, sign painters, \"lettering artists,\" and the list
    continues. \r\n\r\nAs far as books... the chronologies are the best, but they
    do not show step by step. It is material that is meant to be absorbed, possibly
    copied until you get your wings, and or are inspirational in nature. The 21 editions
    of the speedball books is a good place to start, AS WELL AS some of the other
    stellar recommendations.\r\n\r\nI know this is disjointed and disheveled but it
    is better than if I delineated every thought I had on the subject. Talk about
    War and Peace : )\r\n\r\nLettering Today\r\nThe ABC books by Eric Lindegren\r\nCalligraphy
    Today by Heather Child (lots of lettering in there)\r\nCreative Stroke (1 & 2)\r\n\r\nThese
    are fairly contemporary... 60's on. See the other similar thread that is going
    on for some more selections.\r\n\r\nOh my goodness the list is endless and the
    books cover my walls in multiple rooms. So decide what facet you want to explore
    and let me know and I will send you a list!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMichael"

    exaggerate the letterform in new and in interesting ways. While that aspect is
    fun the learning part comes in as you're doing it - take notice of what letter
    attributes characterise a form as one letter, and not another; or the similarities
    and differences between uppers and lowercases.\r\n\r\nIt's also a good exercise
    to loosen up the brain and get the gears spinning."

  body: "@Michael\r\n\r\nThanks for your very elaborate and helpful post! I realise
    that lettering is a difficult field to define, and I try not to narrow myself
    down to one thing now, but the thing I am most interested in at the moment is
    the construction of letters, less so the 'writing' of letters. (I hope you catch
    my drift) It's not that I want to exclude calligraphy from the equation, but this
    is not the direction I am most interested in. I would like to learn how to create/build
    letters by hand, which don't neccesarily look like handlettering. So it's more
    Paul Renner than Hermann Zapf :-)\r\n\r\nTo me letters are the kind of of base
    material to work with, like a set of shapes that can be combined and constructed
    (almost like Lego, perhaps also in 3D). So letters can be used to form words,
    but might as well be like concrete poetry, without semantic meaning attached...\r\nIt's
    sounds rather vague doesn't it??\r\n\r\nIt's hard to explain, as I don't really
    have an example of the kind of things I'd like to be doing. I hope it clarifies
    a little what I am looking for though... \r\n\r\ncheerio Queneau"
