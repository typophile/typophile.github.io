  body: Magazine logos are rarely straight typefaces, usually customized or drawn
    from scratch. The old one is likely an example of that. In this genre, you might
    like <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/families/foco/?affid=99346">Foco</a>.
    If you can find another sample of the new one, that would help. The most defining
    characteristics of the letter styles are obscured.
