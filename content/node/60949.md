    FOR GOOD RELATIONSHIPS TO 'T' 'A' KERNING, MEIER IS NUMBER 2 FONT DESIGNER KNOWS
    WHAT HES DOING WITH THE HANDWRITING FONT EH?\r\n\r\nGENERALLY NEEDS MORE WORK,
    ALTERNATE 'R' PENIS LOOK IS NOT NEEDED.\r\n\r\nTHERE ARE SO MANY SANS SERIFS THIS
    DAYS, A NEW ONE HAS TO BE SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL.\r\n\r\nSAD. BUT I'M SURE YOU
    COME UP WITH GOOD IDEA IN THE FUTURE. BEAUTIFUL DESIGNS, GOOD ON YOU MATE.\r\n\r\nHOFE."

  body: "Wow, I'm seeing something very different than you are, H\xF6fe.  To me, St.
    Atmos looks lively and playful, with unusual (but not *unusable*) details. It
    reminds me of work by Underware and Storm Type -- it follows its own internal
    logic to surprising but interesting conclusions. \r\n\r\nI love the phallic R,
    too."

    know.\r\n\r\n@Sasha: Congratulations on your release!\r\nI too think this is a
    good, original and well-made typeface. It looks like you've taken great care in
    working out all the quirky details, both separate glyphs and word shapes look
    very good indeed. Could you please post a pdf? I'd really like to take a closer
    look at this."
