body: "I just wanted to share a technique I've developed for acquiring good fonts
  on the cheap: Find old, cheap software at thrift stores like Goodwill or the Salvation
  Army. \r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\nI purchased Microsoft Greetings, software circa 2001,
  for $.50 yesterday. I pop it into my machine, and what do I find? A legit license
  for the Font Bureau's Hightower Text that would have otherwise cost me roughly $100
  on [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/hightower/buy.html|Myfonts.com]]. \r\n\r\nAt
  the same time, I bought an old copy of Wordperfect for $1 that included a full family
  of Futura, of which I had only the default Mac set + the extra bold from Elsner+Flake.\r\n\r\nAnyone
  else have any good finds like this? Also, anyone take issue with this technique?"

  body: "I've got to ask: for the type industry, how is this technique of acquiring
    type any better than piracy?\r\n\r\nIt's <em>not</em> piracy, of course, and it's
    perfectly legal, but the end result is the same: no money goes to the type designers,
    and no money goes to the industry that supports type design."

  body: So buying second hand records is bad too because it doesn't support the music
    industry?  I don't even see this as a grey area.  At the time Font Bureau licensed
    their font to Microsoft, they would most likely have been paid for it very reasonably.  To
    expect them to get paid for it again every time it changes hands is ridiculous.  I
    understand that the nature of fonts and software means it's likely that the font
    hasn't just changed hands, but has in fact been duplicated, but that's the nature
    of letting your fonts get into the hands of OEMs.

  body: The fonts within the packages have already been legitimately licensed from
    the foundry, hence the money has already went to the type designer. While I think
    that a type designer deserves more than that, the fact is that they've knowingly
    licensed a font that I can now use. (Within the scope of the original licensing
    agreement, of course.)

  body: "<em>So buying second hand records is bad too because it doesn't support the
    music industry?</em>\r\n\r\nOn the contrary; buying second hand records supports
    an aspect of the music industry: record stores. Are you arguing that there exists
    a comparable model in the type design industry: second-hand fonts?\r\n\r\nTo clarify
    my previous position, I don't think there is anything inherently wrong with this
    method of acquiring type, but I do think it's a side-effect of a broken model
    for selling software. With the transition to more and more purely digital methods
    of licensing software, there will be no more boxes of second-hand software in
    thrift stores."

  body: "It should be noted that in some cases, the software and the fonts will not
    be licensed. For example, the CD you buy in a thrift shop may be an OEM CD which
    someone received in a bundle when they bought a new computer.\r\n\r\nThere are
    various license conditions which apply to software which may not allow a transfer
    of license with the media. Aside from the obvious one of the software still being
    installed."

  body: "While it may not be good for the industry in some theoretical way, as a practical
    matter it doesn't amount to much. \r\n\r\nMost folks who buy used software at
    a thrift store are not doing so to acquire new fonts; the fonts are just a side
    effect of their purchase. If the fonts cost extra for licensing, they'd probably
    just skip the purchase or chose not to license them. It's not the same thing as
    music piracy in which obtaining the music is the person's goal."

  body: It's been mentioned here multiple times that Corel Draw is a particularly
    good buy online or at a thrift store if you can find it. I'll extend that further
    to Corel Office, which has an unusually large amount of type from Bitstream, as
    well as several Adobe knockoffs like the very un-creatively renamed Lithograph,
    and Charlesworth. There are some surprises as well, like Gerard Unger's Oranda
    & Amerigo (both released by Bitstream), and an enormous selection of Scotch Moderns
    like DeVinne. The one thing you don't get with any of these old fonts is a workable
    set of figures or small caps. Still, as a reference collection, this is a fantastic
    deal.

  body: Might want to check your old computer magazine CDs, too. Some mags were allowed
    to redistribute limited or old software versions. I recall spotting Microsoft
    Publisher (had a bunch of Monotype font files), StarOffice 5 (yucky, cruddy own-brand
    cooties) and Serif Publisher (fonts from you-know-who).
