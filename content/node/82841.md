body: "Please help me to choose a typeface to use for my daughter's gravestone.\r\nShe
  was 22, she loved reading, horseback riding, skiing, diving. She was intellectual,
  and had many interests in life.\r\nShe was brave and adventurous - and fragile and
  vulnerable at the same time.\r\nShe never was into any frills, hearts, \"girly\"
  things, etc.\r\n\r\nI think there will be a stylized image of a young tree in a
  strong gush of wind on the granite panel and her name and years of birth and death.
  Everything kept very simple.\r\n\r\nThere will also be place left for my and my
  husband's names."

    tempted to suggest one of my favorites, FF Avance, because it's a playful but
    ambivalent design, full of intelligence but still uncertain of what it will become.
    Also, it has no overly-thin parts which can get lost in engraving. Lastly, it
    was designed by somebody who also died too young.\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-avance/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "A lot depends on how smooth the stone will be, and how patterned.\r\nIf the
    surface is polished and there is no pattern, then a finely detailed face will
    hold up.\r\nSo the choice of typeface (and size and layout) should work in concert
    with the choice of stone.\r\n\r\nAs you intend to deviate from off-the-shelf template
    options, it may be advisable to engage the services of a professional designer.\r\n\r\nWhat
    would she have thought of the image you suggest? Depending on the execution there
    is the possibility it could become overly sentimental.\r\n\r\nA contemporary*
    type in the classic \"stone-chiselled\" mode is <a href=\"http://cartersans.com/index.html\">Carter
    Sans</a>\u2014very robust and un-girly. It would hold up well, even on dark, coarse
    stone.\r\n\r\n*Cousin to the Internet face Verdana, by the same designer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    appreciate and understand your concern. I am not into any sentimentality either,
    and I will be very careful not to allow that.\r\n\r\n> As you intend to deviate

    even to start looking for one, where to find them. The monument companies are
    awful designwise.\r\n\r\nI like all three suggested typefaces and will consider
    using one of them. I am very grateful for all suggestions."

  body: "Possibly a local graphic designer, they tend to be generalists.\r\nLook for
    one who has done work with special printing processes such as embossing, foil
    stamping, spot colors, unusual paper stocks\u2014or \"environmental\" graphics
    i.e. signage. This would indicate that they would have some experience relevant
    to the tactile requirements of gravestones, even if they have never designed one.
    \r\n\r\nAlternatively, an architect? \r\n\r\nIf you chose someone local, you can
    look at stone samples together and discuss with the mason/stonecutter.\r\n\r\nYou
    may have to go further afield for a specialist in stone carving.\r\nFrom the top:

  body: "Getting the assistance of a designer is an excellent idea, but most graphic
    designers will have zero experience with this kind of project. \r\n\r\nI think
    Nick's idea of talking to local masons/stonecutters might be your best bet. You
    could also check with a local arts council or college art department to see if
    they know any local artists who work in stone. Also if your community has a yearly
    arts festival, the organizers might know some stonecutters they could recommend.
    You might also try phoning some local funeral homes to see if they can recommend
    anyone.\r\n\r\nI'd suggest taking your time to make sure you find someone good.
    Temporary grave markers are available to mark graves until a permanent stone is
    ready."
