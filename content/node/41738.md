  body: "I first thought of white as well. I was reminded of the article written by
    Luke Williams of Frog Design comparing the iPod to bathroom fixtures. \r\nwww.frogdesign.com/design-mind/articles/early-articles/the-ipod-and-the-bathtub.html\r\n\r\nI
    then went the way of dr's/nurses' scrubs: powder blue only to find out that the
    color is called ceil blue. Webster defines ceil as: \r\n\r\nceil  \r\n   \r\nMain
    Entry: ceil  \r\nFunction: transitive verb \r\nEtymology: Middle English celen,
    from Medieval Latin celare, caelare, perhaps from Latin caelare to carve, from
    caelum chisel; akin to Latin caedere to cut \r\nDate: 15th century \r\n1 : to
    furnish (as a wooden ship) with a lining \r\n2 : to furnish with a ceiling \r\n\r\nTo
    me, it had no real connection to the color blue. I know cielo means sky in Italian.
    That makes much more sense to me than Webster's definition. I had never heard
    of ceil blue before and thought it a color made up by a company making scrubs.
    Apparently it has transcended that market and made its way into shoes, necklaces,
    etc. Have any of you heard of ceil blue before and possibly know its origins?"

    associated with hygiene in terms of body, IMHO, oral. Oral hygiene. I hear it
    on the radio, tv, print ads etc. Yet, none of us has a toothbrush that is white.
    With the advent of the two-shot injection molding process, toothbrushes have gone
    crazy with color and texture. I find it fascinating that white comes to mind most
    often as the color associated with hygiene, yet something we place in our own
    mouth to clean our white (hopefully) teeth is a myriad of colors/textures that
    don't necessarily evoke hygiene. Yet when we clean our ears its with a white cotton
    tip.\r\n\r\nThe thoughts that keep me up at night. . . "

  body: I said pastels because you see them in hospitals. But if I'm asked to design
    something hygienic the idea of white with bright full saturation colors are obvious
    to me. No dirt, no gray, no brown, just crisp colors bouncing off the crisp white.
    Like these toothbrush samples.

    the blood/yellow ones used to cure disease of the biliary system.\r\n\r\nHe also
    spoke of yellow, \"Saffron onintment with iris-oil applied to the head, acts in

    visible on white)...\r\n\r\n\r\n*) Before that doctors would wear \"everyday\"

    in terms of colour design and medical profession, I think of a colour in relation
    to white. But really any colour can also be presented in a relationship with Black,
    or any other gradation of the achromatic scale for that matter, to also represent

    of different frequencies (incidentally: _all_ the frequencies human sight cells
    can process) as are most other colours having a hue (except for the ones in the
    rainbooow!)\r\n\r\nThere is a describable difference between white and any other
    colour (as is between any two \"hueful\" colours), but no fundamental one (as
    there is none between two \"colours\" as proposed by you).\r\n\r\nWhite _is_ a
    colour. Perfect black is one as well. While perfect black is arguably the _lack_
    of electromagnetic waves, there exists the perception of this lack via the eyes
    as processed by the brain; that is the _colour_ black."
