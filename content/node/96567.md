  money with typography\"\r\nKind of a silly question I know but still... Isn't it
  worth answering?\r\n\r\nI had three (bad) fonts on the MyFonts for some years. They've
  been selling for like 50$ a year but now... I want to do something that is worth
  of my time.\r\nThere are a lot (really a lot) of good fonts for sell. So the question
  is once again, how to make money with typography?\r\n\r\n(It seemed to me a fun
  topic to start)"

  body: "Ok. I see here three statements: special, love, hard work. The three are,
    as always on these matters, fine. I've been a web and graphic designer for some
    time already (10 years) so I know that those statements are really a need.\r\n\r\nI
    was although trying to get a more defined answer. \r\nWhat do I mean by this?
    Something like which sells more? Script, sans-serif? Where do you get inspiration
    for fonts? Do people (the ones that earn money) still do revivals? Is a revival
    a good profit? Isn't just one more of the same?\r\nI guess my overall question
    is where to explore on type? Isn't everything (usable) more a less explored? Or
    there is still plenty of space for more fonts (there is always space but...)?
    In which categories?\r\nWhat do you have to say to this matter?"

  body: "@hrant & frode frank: it's misleading because their \"standard\" fonts. What
    do I mean by standard? Well... Helvetica is like... \"When you don't know what
    to use, use helvetica\". Museo, Futura, DIN, Univers, Frutiger became quite \"standard\"
    also. So standard, I guess I'm using the word to explain that most of people use
    those fonts. Fonts that here for a long journey already and became standard, they
    may not be the best fonts but since they're here for a while already...\r\n\r\nThere
    really is a difference between short-term and long-term success but still... If
    I could see a bigger bestseller list like... 200 fonts I guess it would be less
    misleading.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, trying to get some info from the 50 top list, it seems
    to me that people really like these \"modern\" sans-serif (I don't know how to
    call these straight lines and stuff eheh). When It comes to script and calligraphy
    seems to me that people goes for the \"strange\" category. There are exceptions
    of course like Almibar which by the way seems to me a really good font."

    compete with \u201Cstandard fonts\u201D.\r\nIt\u2019s a matter of offering something
    different or something fresh or something more (not necessarily design-wise).
    H&FJ do it in a way, Jos Buivenga do it in a different way, just as Christian
    Schwartz do in yet another.\r\nBut my advice would be starting with something
    you like or, better yet, with something you want to make better. And remind that
    success isn\u2019t always tied to money making. Just ask Pablo Impallari or James
    Edmondson."

    special in an established genre, it is more special to create something original
    by visually addressing (exploiting) some new or emergent quality of technology
    in an imaginative way. The issue you identify may be a quality of font production
    tools, or of font rendering tools, or of font marketing methods.\r\n\r\nDavid
    Byrne\u2019s new book sounds interesting, especially the chapter where he goes
    into the economics of music making in detail. Perhaps someone will do that for
    the font business. "
