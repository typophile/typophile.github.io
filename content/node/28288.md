  of mine (a book designer) \"What's up with all the slab fonts everywhere?\"  He
  suggested that I contact this forum.  So that's what I'm doing.\r\n\r\nIt seems
  that I started to see them a few years back when Martha Stewart LIVING commissioned
  its slab, Archer.  Ever since then, slabs seem to be popping up more and more.  What's
  it all about?  Was Martha Stewart an instigator--THE instigator--in this?  Or was
  she picking up on a trend she saw coming.  Because slabs are very now."

  body: "In the present era of new genres such as deconstructed, techno, pixel, distressed,
    etc., and with the dominance of the sans serif, the subtle distinctions between
    historic serif genres (old style, transitional, didone) have become relatively
    unimportant, and the more extreme variants such as slabs have assumed greater
    typographic significance for art directors.\r\n\r\nArcher may have been influential,
    due to MSL use.\r\nHowever, TheSerif (1994) was well used editorially before Archer,
    and Clarendon began to return to favor ten years ago.\r\nI designed an \"old style'
    slab serif type, Bodoni Egyptian, in 1999, it seemed like a niche that needed
    filling."

    of Real Simple's use of PMN Caecilia.\r\n\r\nWhile there are underlying cultural/psychological
    reasons why slabs might be appealing right now, I think obvious one is that they
    were underused for a long time. Art directors, always in search of variety/novelty,
    rediscovered slabs -- just as they've rediscovered scripts of late."

    period and reading about the issues that were being addressed."

    begs the question of how a slab is defined:\r\n1. Squared-off structure.\r\n2.
    Thickness.\r\n\r\nMany didones could be considered a slab according to 1.\r\nAnd
    many thick-serifed faces with wedge serifs (eg TheSerif} or bracketed serifs (eg
    Clarendon) fit definition 2.\r\n\r\nBauer and Berthold Bodoni at display size
    are very slabbish, whereas ITC Bodoni, never is, even the small text size set
    big. I have used the Bauer and Berthold in combo as an \"optically-scaled\" Bodoni.\r\n\r\nI
    found that Scala was a good text face up to about 9 pt., then it started to get
    a bit clunky. Of course, that was 10 years ago, and my experience might be different
    now, what with different glasses, the march of fashion, and my own changing tastes

    serif at text size. If it's squared-off and large, it's a slab.

    everywhere, and splatters of ink and paint have are finally tired. In the face
