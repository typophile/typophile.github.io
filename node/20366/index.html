  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">i need help. are any of these directions working for anyone?

i'm having a heck of a time finding a visual that embodies the word champfactory--at least a visual that is uncluttered, and holds its color well. think either addidas logo, nike or apple--simple, curvy blocks of color.

the product is a card game based on motorcycle racing that has been developed over time to embody many different types of racing, although its still motor-sport based as opposed to say, track and field.

so, i can try to create something illustrative of an actual factory that pumps out winners, or i can simply go for an illustration of winning, or speed, or strength, or other attributes of a champion.

this graphic is not coming easily to me, and i've ruled out trying to make a wordmark due to the sheer length of the name. it may be time for me to put it down and come back later with a clean slate.

any ideas, anyone?</div>

use a trophy or a "#" sign with the numeral "1".

		<div class="commentbody">I think 7 and 8 have speed but the winning is a bit obscured by the 1, I think if you are going to distort a character you should begin with a more usual* one. I might try using a non-oblique wordmark, because the impression of speed in photography is increased by having a stationary object in the foreground. Further to Hrant's suggestions you might think of a chequered flag which is probably more universal and can be made into a powerful graphic, along the lines of the simple logos you mentioned.

*bit subjective but I hope you take my point</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The Id needs alot more than a logo. You could do anything with a mark like that and it would mean nothing. I think your client needs to  think about branding not just a mark. What is it that they are selling or bringing to market? Get a marketing report or make them generate one for you. You need a point of reference to start from, like who are you talking to!</div>
