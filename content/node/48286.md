  on Flickr for tattoo fonts and came across this picture (now saved on my photobucket):\r\n\r\nhttp://i293.photobucket.com/albums/mm69/abecking25/tatfont.jpg\r\n\r\nI
  really need to know that font or a font close to it... oh and for anyone who is
  interested, my tattoo is the Joan of Arc quote \"I am not afraid; I was born to
  do this\"\r\n\r\nThank you!"
