body: "Good morning good people,\r\nMy department of designers are aggressively reassessing
  the brand image of the company we work for, starting with consistency of visual
  language. The Senior Designer established that the current corporate typeface, Helvetica
  Neue (or is it properly Neue Helvetica?), is perfectly suitable for our needs. It
  works quite well with all the various weights and styles for the US market, however
  our international offices are just frustrated. Characters are missing for the Bosians
  and the Russians do not have enough variation with the basic cyrillic family they
  have and so on and so on. Many of the offices have elected to use Myriad Pro as
  a substitute and it's just destroying our brand objectives. This must stop.\r\nI
  found this:\r\nhttp://www.fonts.com/font/linotype/neue-helvetica/paneuropean-complete-family-pack\r\n\r\n...and
  am curious if I were to purchase licenses for each office, if will be sufficient
  enough for the US as well. Or would I also need to purchase:\r\nhttp://www.fonts.com/font/linotype/neue-helvetica/complete-family-pack\r\n\r\nMy
  own view is that it's time for a modern family to be introduced but unfortunately...
  I am not the shot caller.\r\n\r\nAny advice is much appreciated."

    personal opinion. Sounds like a custom type family would serve both your practical
    and financial needs better.

  body: "Also factor in Neue Helvetica's overly-tight spacing, which reduces readability.
    Essentially it's a display face, and a profusely over-used (read: diluted) one
    at that.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Yes, we run into that all the time and typically track it out about 10-20
    points depending on the situation. Thanks for the tip hrant. :)\r\n\r\nWish me
    luck, I'm running upstairs to propose.\r\n\r\nAlso... if I were to present a cheaper
    alternative that has equal amounts of styles within the family... what would one
    recommend? I love Village's Galaxie Polaris but unfortunately it does not have
    the language support, nor the depth of styles Helvetica Neue encompasses."

  body: Whelp... it's been approved. Thanks for you help, folks. Either way, the Euro
    office needs it so in my book, that's a win.
