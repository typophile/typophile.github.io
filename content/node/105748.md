  Mark Bloom's modular grid system in illustrator.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.computerarts.co.uk/tutorials/create-modular-grid-system-illustrator]]\r\n\r\nI
  thought it was refreshing to see Computer Arts highlight how a designer works with
  a grid system in their day-to-day design projects.\r\n\r\nI was wondering what people
  thought to the process Mark uses? I am interested to hear everyones thoughts about
  creating Modular grid systems, perhaps you feel you have a better solution? or perhaps
  you work for a design studio that likes you use grids a certain way?\r\n\r\nAppreciate
  anyones thoughts?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks\r\np\r\n\r\n"
