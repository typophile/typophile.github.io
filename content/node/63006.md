body: "This is Badona, my first full typeface. It has two weights, thin and regular.
  As soon as the kerning and autospacing are being finished, it will hopefully find
  its place on the market.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typo1_4933.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typo2_5802.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typo3_4736.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typo9_3827.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typo5_5360.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typo4_6323.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typo55_5531.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typo6_4005.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typo7_4773.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typo8_6477.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nHope

  body: Nice. I think the OE needs more O in it.

    be to its \u0153! ;-)\r\n\r\nI like its constrained playfulness, by the way."

  body: "- Do the rounds have any overshoot? \"o\", \"e\" and such look small to me.\r\n-
    The caps seem more unfinished than the lc, also in terms of divergent curve character
    and widths (doesn't that \"QUARED\" look a bit strange?)\r\n- I see some clogging
    issues in joins, especially in the Thin version, but also the Regular. You might
    try to compensate/thin/taper more.\r\n- The spacing needs a lot of work. :-\\
    \ Your glyphs can be as pretty as they want \u2013 the spacing really makes or
    breaks a font.\r\n\r\nI'd say if you spend some more time polishing this, you
    can make it *really* nice (as opposed to quite interesting for a first/early one).&nbsp;&nbsp;:-)"

  body: "Really interesting!\r\nI really like the lc. nuy are too large though. u
    has too be less wide than n too (on average over 40 fonts I surveyed it is 2%)
    ; f and t are too narrow as almost always with a first font. m & w look too similar
    and w is too empty at the top.\r\nThere are many spacing issues. The rounds may
    need to overshoot slightly more. \r\nJ is really strange. The bar of the A could
    be lower. The R is a bit out of proportion with the rest. M is too narrow. Check
    the width of each stem and joints, they seem to vary too much.\r\n\r\nHTH, let
    me know if it does not or if you think that I am wrong. "
