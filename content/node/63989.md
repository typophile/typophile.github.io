  (?) street name plates I`ve seen when I was in Prague for a few days this summer.
  I loved the tectonic charm of the letters which often seemed to be handmade and
  based on a very simple grid. \r\n\r\nSo when I was at home again, I wanted to create
  such a typeface for myself. (I just had too :)\r\n\r\nAnd this is where I got now.
  I`ve drawn all the letters out of a very simple grid -- as you can see for sure
  -- and I decided not to adjust too much (I feel, doing that would work against the
  spirit of this kind of typeface -- maybe I am wrong, what do you think?)\r\n\r\nI`d
  love to have some opinions on this. Here I show you some .jpgs and a .pdf file to
  criticise the curves.\r\n\r\nI`m looking forward for any comment.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/opletalova_6402.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/opletalova2_4567.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/opletalova3_3594.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/opletalova4_4969.jpg]"

  body: "Nice. It's relaxing. Breathes easily.\r\n\r\nOccasionally it feels baseline
    heavy. Stylistically, some might find it a bit too geometric. It seems to be hinting
    at a more humanist vibe, especially with those chiseled ears, but the dominance
    of parallel lines tempers it's personality. That isn't necessarily a bad thing,
    but it seems to have potential for a bit more personality (i.e., more curves),
    if that makes any sense.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for your thoughts, which of course make sense to me, dirtcastle :).\r\n\r\nYes,
    the \"too geometric\" issue is definitely a thing I`ve been thinking about. But
    I didn`t want to draw the outer shapes rounder because then the contrast between
    the outer shapes and the inner shapes (rectangular) seemed too weird to my eyes.
    (Not sure, if you mean that)\r\n\r\nI understand your hint regarding the personality.
    I feel, driving it further in a humanist direction would lead to a completely
    different typeface -- I especially like the simple concept of the letters as they
    appear now, it is like one can immediately understand the letters and can draw
    them by hand on a plate (sign painter perspective). I liked that approach when
    I saw those plates in the streets of Prague and that`s what defines the character
    of the typeface at all, as I understand it. Maybe these letters can be a good
    starting point for a next typeface ;) -- \r\n\r\nFor now, I\xB4m not sure if all
    the letters play together in harmony -- on some days the lowercase v and w seem
    a bit dark to me. \r\n\r\nAlso the \"horizontal-vertical\" issue: at the moment
    all strokes have the same weight -- which is unorthodox, I know (do you mean that
    with \"baseline heavy\"?). Maybe I should fix that and bring it in balance as
    a next step..\r\n\r\nhope you can follow my english (imagine me switching between
    the typophile.com tab and the dict.leo.org tab while writing this) :)\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Your English is excellent. I understand 100%.\r\n\r\nI think you are right
    that curves would change the personality of the font.\r\n\r\nAnd I think you are
    right that changing the weight could have a big effect.\r\n\r\nI think the reason
    why it feels baseline heavy is height and width of the serifs. I think they might
    be just a little bit too wide and too tall. \r\n\r\nStill, even as it is, I think
    this is a very nice looking font."
