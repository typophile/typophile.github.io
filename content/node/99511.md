body: "I'm bidding on a bespoke headline type for an Irish client, who may need to
  use it for bilingual Irish/English texts. While the original plan was for an all-caps
  titling face, I've realized that all-caps setting in Irish sometimes requires the
  use of lowercase letters. For instance, HISTORY OF IRELAND is rendered STAIR NA
  h\xC9IREANN, with a lowercase /h/.\r\n\r\nCan anyone tell me what lowercase letters
  are needed to make an all-caps typeface usable in Irish? Do I need to draw lowercase
  for the whole Irish alphabet (i.e., a \xE1 b c d e \xE9 f g h i \xED l m n o \xF3
  p r s t u \xFA)? In fact, given the existence of loan words that use non-Irish Latin
  letters, does any Irish-capable typeface need a full Latin lowercase?\r\n\r\nFWIW,
  the typeface is meant to be a modern Latin, not a traditional Irish/Gaelic letter.
  And any Irish set in it would be modern Irish. "

  body: "BTW Max, I know you said this is supposed to be a \"modern\" design, but
    unless the client strongly objects this might actually be a nice opportunity to
    inject some subtle Gaelic flavor into the design - maybe restricted to those seven
    lc characters (with the \"d\", \"g\" and \"t\" possibly being the best candidates)
    if only in the form of alternate characters. It's the sort of cultural sensitivity
    that I for one value quite a bit.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Jack, in Irish orthography certain prefixed letters are not capitalised in
    mixed-case text; rather, the initial letter of the root word is. So, in Max's
    example, the mixed-case version would be 'h\xC9ireann'. The h in this case indicates
    an aspirated pronunciation, presumably triggered by the preceding vowel.* In order
    to maintain this orthographic distinction in all-caps text, the prefixed letter
    conventionally either remains lowercase or, in some typography and signage, may
    be a smallcap. In an all-caps typeface, my inclination would be to either go for
    the smallcap option or ensure that the nominally lowercase forms are designed
    to harmonise in all-caps settings by adjusting their proportions and weight and
    perhaps employing bilateral serifs on ascenders.\r\n____\r\n\r\n* I'm intrigued
    by the different ways in which languages evolve means to deal with successive
    vowel sounds across word breaks. Irish aspirates the second vowel: <em>na h\xC9ireann</em>
    rather than <em>na \xC9ireann</em>. French tends to elide the first vowel: <em>l\u2019\xE9cole</em>
    rather than <em>la \xE9cole</em>. In spoken English, vowels are also elided quite
    often, but not usually in writing, and British English has the delightful insistence
    that aspiration sometimes isn't enough: <em>an history</em> rather than <em>a
    history</em>."

  body: "Once it was explained that these small letters were <strong>prefixed</strong>,
    I had something to try Googling with (Irish prefixed orthography). I found a page
    on Irish pronunciation that had many such letters in one section, on a phenomenon
    called <em>eclipsis</em>. That may be too specific, as it may not be the only
    reason for such letters, but it may be useful in turning up more comprehensive
    detail.\r\n\r\nHmm. Apparently eclipsis occurs a lot, and it's only when it is
    not expected that a prothetic consonant is added (sometimes also called a prosthetic
    consonant, and apparently not just when one's spelling checker alters it behind
    one's back - that's a legitimate alternate name)."

    an idea worth exploring.\r\n\r\nI appreciate the suggestion, Hrant, though it's
    not clear that Gaelic flavor would be a plus for this particular client."
