  body: Isn't it possible they just used the O instead of the 0? Having a full circle
    0 with lining figures doesn't make sense, as that would make the 0 way to wide,
    so the numerals wouldn't align vertically when stacked.

  body: Yves is right. It's mistyped AvantGarde (on my keyboardd O and 0 are REALLY
    close together...).

    I'm not the only one, I thought I was just clumsy. :^D

  body: In the original character set of Avant Garde were some alternates, including
    two zeros. Since this is probably more recent, you're probably right about them
    just using an O. I don't think the alternate zero was different than a cap O in
    the original. Just placed conveniently with the numbers on the film fonts or whatever.
