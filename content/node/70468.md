  I do not know another text that on the same topic.\r\n\r\nCan you recommend me an
  article or book with such information? I find hard to believe this is the only available
  or ever published on dutch orthotypography. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Just checked my library and rechecked it, because I could not find a specific
    book\u2026 But what I noticed is that I have a lot of translations of British
    manuals.\r\n\r\nLet me postulate that Dutch typographic conventions are heavily
    based on the British. Where small differences occur they -- in some cases -- can
    be traced back to NEN (our equivalent to DIN in Germany), eg the way postal codes
    are handled and addresses in general.\r\n\r\nLet the discussion begin!"

    A.H.G.: \u201CZetkunst\u201D. Drukkerij Nieuw Leven, Den Haag, 1940\r\nBut like
    most of the times, I'm not in the same place as the book in question atm. Maybe
    Bert can check this as well. \r\nFurthermore I agree that most instances are similar
    to british or international conventions. Jeoffrey Dowding, Oliver Simon or Paul
    Luna\u2019s books come to my mind.\r\n"

    Older parts of my collection are in storage and I guess that Blankenstein (as
    well as Groenewegen) are boxed up\u2026\r\n\r\nI will have a closer look at what
    I have around, later today -- hopefully -- and get back to you all!"

  body: "You mean M.H. Groenendaal \u201CDruckletters\"? This I have here, one of
    my favourites, but there\u2019s nothing about ortho-typography or typesetting
    conventions in it. \r\nI checked Martin Majoor\u2019s essay on typesetting in
    \u201CLetters \u2013 een bloemlezing over typografie\u201D if this is the one
    you meant Ramiro (S. 189\u2013208 \u201CHad de Franse koning schoenmaat 49\u201C).
    Apart from the dutch style of quotes these are exactly the same rules as in Germany
    and probably internationally as well. What specific dutch conventions are you
    looking for? IJs vs. Ijs?\r\n\r\n(I wouldn't agree on his suggested use of ellipse
    though. I find it much more clear to have word spaces left <em>and</em> right
    if the ellipse replaces whole words or part of a text ... and without in cases
    where it stands for single letters or parts of a word, like in typogra... )"

  body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nThanks everyone for sharing. \r\nProbably I am influenced
    by the fact spanish typography have several typographic conventions which are
    different to english. French also has it peculiarities. \r\nAlmost every good
    spanish book on typography dedicate a chapter on orthotypography and I feel a
    bit lost when I set in dutch and I can not check is certain decisions are appropriated
    or not. \r\nBut it is good to know that beside of a couple of 'dingetjes' I can
    use english typographic conventions (I guess British english... am I right?)\r\n\r\nCheers.\r\n\r\nR."
