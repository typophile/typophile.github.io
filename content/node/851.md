  fonts for ran across my Typographica article today and said to me: <BR> <BR>&#34;I
  was reading your font article. I like the Snell Roundhand Script combined with Stempel
  Garamond Roman used in Font of the Week [on the Linotype Library web site]. I&#39;ll
  have to think of something to use it for. I used to buy fonts now and then for my
  web designs but because I lack organisation, I lose them on old hard drives.  Thus,
  I gave up looking. I&#39;m afraid to start up again ... it would be just like [buying
  books you like even though you don&#39;t intend to read them right away]!&#34; <BR>
  <BR>She also said: <BR>&#34;I consider myself the average user.  I would say the
  average user purchases fonts, especially if they are say in the 25&#43; bracket.
  I buy them one at a time. I see one I like, I buy it.&#34; <BR> <BR>I wonder what
  the ratio of people like this to font pirates is.'

  body: '&#62;I see one I like, I buy it. <BR> <BR>All my typefaces can be bought
    as single fonts or family packages &#40;a much better deal&#41; at MyFonts. Most
    of them are not out-and-out display fonts. There is a high proportion of single-font
    sales. I don&#39;t believe these are necessarily to graphic designers who need
    one font for a logo. I would also expect professionals to buy the family. So my
    conclusion is that there are a fair number of &#34;amateur&#34; sales there, in
    the single font purchases. '

  body: 'My first best customer still a non professional &#40;non graphic designer
    at all&#41;, who bought the complete PTF collection in 2000 or so? and buy all
    new typefaces since. I asked to him what he doing with the fonts. He answered
    just that he like typefaces and buy them for his own pleasure. A real amateur
    in all sences. <BR> <BR>This experience let me conclude: <BR>I don&#39;t think
    we can set up a clear definition on such subject, because of the web, you&#39;ve
    got all this earth as potential customer or pirates.'
