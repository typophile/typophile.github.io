  book cover:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/book_cover_6744.jpg]\r\n\r\n\"I
  Live Here is a paper documentary\u2013an intimate journey to humanitarian crises
  in four corners of the world: war in Chechnya, ethnic cleansing in Burma, globalization
  in Mexico, and AIDS in Malawi.\" -Barns and Noble\r\n\r\nThe cover design is very
  interesting, considering the subject matter of the book. I don't think I need to
  explain \"I live\", just that it has so much meaning given the subject of the book.
  It is all hand drawn type (in sharpie) on a wall that looks like it's been painted
  multiple times.\r\n\r\nIt's a funny thing for me, If given a decision I usually
  choose something pretty or comical, but the strong concept for this cover are what
  caught my eye.\r\n"
