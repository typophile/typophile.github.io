  body: "Seems to be cast with something from the pre-digital era. For Roman letter
    fonts the master could have been prepared with a letter routing machine, particularly
    the Leroy Lettering Machine. There are some fonts for Roman letters based on routing
    machine letters [see http://typophile.com/node/114201]. Perhaps a search of Cyrillic
    fonts might disclose a version of the routed letters. \r\nOne font that could
    be used to produce an approximate rendition of the Soviet Era phone booth plaque
    is Andriy Konstantynov's Pancetta\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PancettaRegCyr_5797.jpg]\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/konstantynov/pancetta-pro/\r\nDon"
