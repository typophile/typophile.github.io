  arms and legs, But I believe it's related to some comic book, Possibly Frank Miller.

    body: "I've done my best to trace a vector version. The original is very low quality,
      After leveling the colour and sharpening, It's still very low quality... Not
      good enough to use in various 'font finding' programs. \r\n"

  body: "As I'm the designer/programmer of a such font-finding application, I insist
    that in some cases the soft/gray edges of a low resolution image could provide
    more information than the sharp edges of a rough vector output - but it's your
    choice off course...\r\n\r\nPS: You should provide the original image: No re-size,
    no flattening, no sharpening, no brightness adjustment "
