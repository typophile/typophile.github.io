  and styles.\r\n\r\nEspecially I need it to have hi contrast style, Like Freight
  Big. And that elegant and unique feel to it.\r\n\r\nI\xB4m using it in a magazine,
  and considering to change it to another display face.\r\n\r\nIf anyone gets what
  kind of typeface I'm looking for please help.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n"

    liking. It is too obvious in it's shapes. But it is in the right direction though.
    Thanks."

    something new and special be something completely different from Freight?\r\n\r\nHave
    you seen Greta Display? Greta Grande? Fedra Serif Display?\r\nhttp://www.typotheque.com/fonts/\r\n"

  body: "I guess  are propably right. And the faces you listed are great. \r\n\r\nBut
    the thing is i am using Freight with Stag and Stag Sans, and I find the \"American\"
    feel of Freight to match Stag nicely.\r\n\r\nSo I think what I am looking for
    is US designed 17th century baroque style typeface with attitude...\r\n\r\nAnd
    Freight is the one... or?"

    that it is out of the question. Farnham is the closest you can get for what I'm
    looking for. \r\n\r\nFreight - Farnham - xxxx... This is what I'm looking for.\r\n\r\nand
    to all the good people in this thread: I REALLY appreciate your effort in helping
