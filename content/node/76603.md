body: "I recently created a newer version of a connecting script font for a client
  who uses it as a cheaper alternative for wedding envelopes. The older version worked
  well and had loads of contextual ligatures with swash versions in stylistic sets.
  For the newer version I restructured the stylistic sets that were for caps so there
  are now 5 complete Uppercase sets.\r\n\r\nProblem now is that 3 sets of ligatures
  h_y l_y and p_y along with the ending and swash versions of each no longer work
  in InDesign. If I type in any of those combinations I get an empty glyph cell. In
  the glyph palette if I hover over it, the index numbers and such are all correct,
  but it appears empty and so stylistic sets of these also don't work. I don't think
  its a code problem, because its the same as the older version that works. I have
  other similar ligatures like t_y with the same format of feature code and they work
  fine. I also noticed in Font Explorer it showed no problems until I type one of
  the bad ligatures into the preview. Then I get a warning that the font is corrupt.
  \r\n\r\nSo now I'm thinking my only alternative may be to use a copy of the older
  vfb file before adding cap sets and updating it all again. That would probably take
  a long time. If I do that what is the best way to bring in kerning. Its a large
  font with 1054 glyphs, uses some class kerning, but since its fully connecting the
  kerning is not terribly extensive. I'm even wondering if I might be able to copy
  over and arrange all the glyphs and classes to match and then just copy over the
  entire kern feature. \u2026or would that create a possible disaster? Any useful
  tips here would be most helpful."

  body: "The name of the new version has pro at the end to distinguish it from the
    previous. I don't think it's a cache problem. I used the cache deleting features
    in Font Explorer and even tried restarting.\r\n\r\nI did open up the font itself
    in FontLab. That changes around the names of classes, but the code was essentially
    the same and the glyph slots were all intact. I tried copying just the affected
    ligatures back in and deleted all the contextual elements for them. The same ligatures
    still would not come in. Very frustrating. The older version that I tried that
    worked was a ttf version of OpenType. I'm wondering if that might make a difference,
    but I'm not sure. \r\n\r\nWhen I made the updated version with all the stylistic
    sets for caps I rearranged the sets and changed orders around a bit. I don't see
    any for the lowercase where I've changed the hierarchy, but that's the one thing
    that I keep thinking might be involved. I also wonder if fonts just go corrupt
    sometimes without any noticeable changes that should affect them. When I worked
    at AG some of our old PS fonts would just stop working and I couldn't always find
    a clear answer even though an archived version still worked."

  body: It seems to me that it must be something you inadvertently did in the OT code.
    Something subtle that doesn't raise an error when you generate the font, but causes
    the behavior in InDesign. Just a hunch.

    ones. I'll keep trying to figure it out and see if I can find an error.

  body: "BTW, I say this because I'm pretty sure OT fonts can't get corrupted the
    way old PS fonts could. The reason they did (on the Mac, anyway) was to do with
    the fact that they were stored as resources (i.e., in the resource fork of a file).
    Because of the way resources worked on the old MacOS (pre-10.0), any font files
    that were installed had to be open (for read and write) while in use, and if a
    file was open when a system crash happened, it could be corrupted. Since installed
    fonts were always open, that made them vulnerable to corruption. Fonts don't work
    that way anymore on MacOS 10.0 and later (except in the Classic environment, but
    hardly anyone uses that anymore, and it's not even possible on 10.5 and later
    or on Intel-based Macs).\r\n\r\nThat said, I have heard of FontLab .vfb files
    getting corrupted."

    experienced it, and it's no fun. Generally, the only way to correct the problem
    is to generate a font, and open it up in FontLab. This procedure usually removes
    the voodoo hidden deep inside the original .vfb, but you have to check your Font
    Info, Classes and Features to make sure that they haven't changed."

  body: "The reason that happens is because the feature source code is not stored
    in the generated font. It gets compiled. So when you import the font back into
    FontLab, it must decompile the feature code. Some of the original structure is
    lost, even though it is (usually*) functionally equivalent.\r\n\r\nOne way to
    get around this is to export the classes and feature code from the original .vfb.
    Of course, if that's where the problem was, maybe not. It would be worth testing
    the OT features of the imported font in FontLab--as it interprets them--to see
    if the behavior in InDesign is present.\r\n\r\n* There are some OT features that
    FontLab doesn't know about that may be present if the font was not created in
    FontLab. But that's not going to be the case with your font."

  body: I tried opening up the generated font, but only to look at it. What I ended
    up doing, howeve,r was really simple. Apparently the corruption only happened
    when I generated a PS flavor OT font. I did it as a ttf and now have no corruption.
    Not sure what caused the problem, but I found an older version that I had made
    as ttf before the upgrade and it worked so I tried that format.
