  have something "safe" about them. Not totally sterile safe, just safe enough.

    but I think it qualifies in the "safe" category well enough).

  body: If meta is 'safe', then add bliss, officina, etc... oh, and auricfuzz, i really
    can't let you have futura... it's one of my favourite faces, however i've had
    that rejected on account of the 'squirly' question mark on a number of occasions
    :-)

    for so long it''s become the past few years what Helvetica was in the 70s. While
    I still think it''s great, whenever I see it used now I just think it looks either
    generic or gimmicky. '

  body: Brett, I was going to say that I'm a big fan of each of these faces (except
    for FF DIN ), but I didn't want to repeat Tiff's initial comment that they're
    safe, not necessarily sterile. As vectorgirl said, I see Futura a ton nowadays,
    probably more than anything other than Helvetica, Arial, and Times -- and it's
    often [[squooshed]] obscenely >-o . However, I'd love to see someone shake things
    up by using one of the versions of Futura with Renner's alternate a's, g's, n,
    m, and r.

    in the licenses for the fonts suggested so far.\r\n\r\nI do create Keynote files
    (exported to PDF) which my client uses to make presentations around the country.
    At present I am using Myriad Pro instead of Helvetica as a work-a-round. I've
    already stepped my client through that process twice as I had to explain to him
    why we couldn't use Whitney or Helvetica because he occasionally gives the files
    (as PDFs) to his other seminar leaders as well as those people they train who
    then turn around and do more internal training. It is a logistical nightmare and
    makes using Myriad more and more attractive. I don't hate Myriad. I do like it
    and have found it serves most purposes in the presentations. I might just have
    to license the rest of the family and see if I can't make it work through out
    the company."
