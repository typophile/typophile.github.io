  is M150, so maybe it's a fancy M. But it's unusual to see a ball terminal in that
  position/from that angle. Turn it upside-down and it looks like it's 'n s c.'\r\n\r\nI
  kind of hope it's just abstract, because I'd like to get a tattoo of it.\r\n\r\nAnybody
  know what it means/where it may have come from?\r\n\r\nBTW-were old accounts deleted
  at some point? I had an old one I registered probably five years ago and I was wondering
  if I could revive it."

    an M.\r\nBut I think that, taken out of context, it could make a nice decorative
    tattoo (and a fun game with friends: \u201CGuess what it is?\u201D ;-)."
