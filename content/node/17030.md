  body: "An uppercase A has three strokes. Unless it is a bit abstracted, and then
    it has two. Or, it might only have one if you count a quick cursive triangle as
    just a single stroke. Some blackletter variants might have given it four, five,
    or more strokes!\r\n\r\nThe uppercase A used to be written upside down, or on
    its side, until the Greeks rotated it. It probably symbolized an Ox head for the
    Phoenicians, who probably got the Glyph from Egyptian hieroglyphs. Some people
    think it is based on Mesopotamian Cuneiform, though.\r\n\r\nIt is the first letter
    of the alphabet, and certainly one of the oldest. The Romans could carve it into
    stone really nicely.\r\n\r\nI put my crossbar underneath the mathematical center
    (i.e., I optically center it, or sometime make it deliberately too deep, depending
    on the typeface's style), otherwise, it looks too high. Too high looks like a
    woman in a mini skirt, though, and that is ok sometimes, too ;-)"

    can be deceptive but not as tough to deal with as the W and M. You need to consider
    all the diagonal glyphs together so that what you do for one, makes sense with
    the others. There are no silver bullets, just work then rest, then more work after
    a bit of distance. Type design is the art of tinkering mixed with periods of frustration

  body: "While the uppercase A is normally pointed at the top, and the crossbar is
    somewhere in the vicinity of halfway up the interior space, there is lots of leeway
    for display typefaces in which A may be very unusual before becoming unrecognisable.
    I reckon what is essential for A is that it it closed at the top, open at the
    bottom, and there should be some kind of stroke connecting the sides. There are
    display types that do without the crossbar, \u039B, but in this case one only
    knows it is an A from the context: as an isolated letterform I don't believe this
    is sufficient.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMGP2164.jpg]\r\n\r\n.\r\nThe
    one with a concave top, fourth from left in the top row, is an interesting one:
    I think making the top concave is generally pushing the recognisability of the
    letter too much, but if you mirror this feature in the crossbar it is less problematic.\r\n\r\n[My

  body: "I believe the earliest appearence of an ox head in a writing system is in
    proto-cuneiform, generally recognised as the world's first true script. However,
    in the evolved cuneiform proper, the sign is abstracted through the use of the
    wedge stylus, and hardly recognisable as an ox head any more, so it seems unlikely
    that it made its transition into ancient Canaanite writing from this source. The
    Egyptian hieroglyph is a more likely direct source for what eventually became,
    via the Phoenicians and the Greeks, the Latin A. I don't think anyone has established
    a definite link between proto-cuneiform and proto-hieroglyphic, and the use of
    some common animal shapes may simply reflect the importance of the same livestock.\r\n\r\nI'm
    reading <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312330022\">this book</a>

    found it a bit chauvinistic.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nEvery letter has \"issues\", some
    more than others,\r\nand the \"A\" more than most. Here are some things\r\nI think
    are worth worrying about:\r\n\r\n1) Symmetry. People like it, at least in their
    consciousness.\r\nBut ductile \"logic\"* makes the left stroke** thinner than
    the right.\r\nThe thing is, stroke contrast is [generally] good for you, at least
    I\r\nthink so. So what to do? We haven't really thought about this yet.\r\n\r\n*
    Do mind the quotes.\r\n\r\n** Yes, I use it too - but not to mean anything chirographic.\r\n\r\n2)
    Height of the bar. As Dan alludes to, the height of the bar should depend\r\non
    the design. Specifically, the higher the bar the more elegant the resultant\r\natmosphere.*
    Another thing about the bar height is that smaller sizes need it lower, functionality-wise.\r\n\r\n*
    The potent miniskirt visualization notwithstanding.\r\nAlthough when I picture
    a woman in a miniskirt with\r\nher legs spread like that, I automatically see
    a machine\r\ngun in her arms for some reason. Chicks with guns is cool.\r\n\r\n3)
    Shape of the bar. Conventionally it's straight. But I think\r\nthere's a lot to
    be said about making it curve and/or thicker\r\non the left (especially if you
    maintain ductile \"logic\"). Some\r\nrecent South American designers have tried
    this, with great\r\nresults I think. And of course there's this:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/ehrhardt/\r\n\r\n4)
    The shape of the top tip. Quite significant, atmospherically.\r\n\r\n5) Outside
    serifs. Usually need to be shorter.\r\n\r\n6) AE. Think about it during the \"A\",
    and vice versa.\r\n\r\nBTW, Alfred Kallir insists that the \"A\" is a man with
    his member. If you read his book, that's not as crazy as it might seem. Who, after
    all, dreams of cows before sex? (No Gill jokes, guys! :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    letters jumbled at funny angles. Orientation is, in fact, a normative aspect of
    most shapes, because the shape changes when you change the orientation. [Someone
    who cares so much about notan should acknowledge that. If you shift the pattern
    of light and dark by rotating a form, you are redefining the notan.]\r\n\r\nNow,
    an interesting phenomenon regarding letters is that children when first learning
    to write, very frequently <em>flip</em> letters horizontally (sometimes even when
    copying directly from a model), and they seem to have little or no difficulty
    reading such flipped letters even when mixed in text. But to my knowledge they
    do not rotate letters or manage to read rotated letters in the same way that they
    read flipped letters. This seems to me a pretty good indication of what might
    be termed natural normative orientation and learned normative orientation. Natural
    normative orientation enables boustrephedon, but once one learns normative orientation
    that includes directionality it is hard to go back."
