  think it\u2019s really neat, so I would like to find out where it originally comes
  from.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s sold by Elsner & Flake as part of their \u201CTypeshop Collection\u201D,
  which, as it seems, is the former <em>Quick Brown Fox</em> \u201CSerials Typecollection\u201D,
  which is the former <em>Brendel & Pabst</em> \u201CSerial Type Collection\u201D.\r\n\r\n<em>Softmaker</em>
  sells it, too (as \u201CGlasgow Serial\u201D), as does <em>Red Rooster</em> in two
  versions (stating on MyFonts it originates from <em>Quick Brown Fox</em>).\r\n\r\nWhile
  most Brendel & Pabst typefaces are modelled after typefaces from other foundries,
  I couldn\u2019t find out anything about Glasgow. Could this be a Brendel & Pabst
  original?\r\n\r\nI hope someone can shed light on this!\r\n\r\nThanks in advance

    can't find good samples of it to compare with.\r\n\r\nFF Govan should be the commercial
    version of it \u2013 and it is similar \u2013 but the g is completely different."

  body: "Claus:\r\n\r\nIt seems that the Brendel / Softmaker / Infinitype is from
    ca. 1993. It was based on Georg Salden's Polo from\r\n1973.  On the connection
    between Polo and Spiekermann (and I am NOT taking sides), read this German wiki:\r\n\r\nhttp://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polo_GST_(Schriftart)\r\n\r\nThat
    may explain some of the design elements of the corporate Glasgow face by Spiekermann.
    But again,\r\nI have no crystal ball, and there are many differences between all
    the faces mentioned in the wiki and in this thread.\r\n\r\nHope you're doing well,\r\n\r\nLuc"

  body: "Thanks for your replies.\r\n\r\nOn the old Quick Brown Fox website, Glasgow
    Regular was offered as a free download.  The site including the download is available
    in the Internet Archive, see e.g.:\r\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20080302224520/http://www.qbf.de/tceng.htm\r\n\r\nIn
    this Glasgow Regular file, the copyright information reads:\r\n(C) 1993 B & P
    Graphics, Ltd.\r\n\r\nThis could of course mean that the typeface existed before
    and was digitized in 1993.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be evident that Glasgow is based
    on Polo, but the typefaces are different (Polo on top):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Polo_3557.png]<br>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Glasgow_6451.png]\r\n\r\n[[http://www.fonts4ever.com/portrait_library.php?language=en&id=3|On
    the Elsner & Flake website]] I found the following about Brendel\u2019s typefaces:\r\n\r\n<cite>The
    typographer and founder of the TypeShop Group* Walter Florenz Brendel (1933-1992)
    ordered the development of exclusive phototypesetting typefaces in the 70s and
    the beginning of the 80s for the phototypesetter he himself built, \u201CUnitype\u201D,
    which had their basis partially in historical but also in contemporary designs.</cite>\r\n\r\nIf
    Glasgow was made in the mentioned period, it must have been made shortly after
    the publication of Polo, which was developped 1972\u20131976 (according to Georg
    Salden).\r\n\r\nSo maybe it was made by an unknown employee of Brendel or Walter
    Brendel himself.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m eager to read it if someone knows more about
    the case."

  body: "Walter Brendel (1933-1992) was the founder of Brendel Informatik, Brendel
    & Pabst and the Type Shop group of phototypesetting houses. He also co-founded
    the European Typeface Corporation (ETC) which was connected with Typo Bach, another
    group of phototypesetting houses. \r\nBrendel\u2019s Serials were based on existing
    typeface designs, which had typically been made fit for creating a range of 7
    weights from extra light to extra bold by interpolation. The Serials Typeface
    Collection used to be exclusively available through Brendel\u2019s Type Shops,
    Typo Bach and others. \r\n\r\nThe German type designer Georg Salden created another
    range of exclusive typefaces, they were only available through the GST group of
    typesetting houses. Similar to Brendel\u2019s Type Shops and Adrian William\u2019s
    Club Type, the GST group also tried to enforce customer loyalty by offering typefaces
    that were exclusive to their group. As all of these typesetting houses worked
    for the same advertising agencies, their typeface libraries show many similarities.
    Some of these similarities were created on purpose, some of them not. Some of
    them are just copies, some of them are re-engineered designs, some of them are
    adaptations of existing designs, some of them are originals \u2026\r\n\r\nCurrently,
    the Type Shop / Serials typeface library is maintained and marketed by Elsner+Flake.\r\nhttp://www.fonts4ever.com/foundry_detail.php?f_shops_id=3&f_fonts_belegung_id=0&view=1\r\n\r\nThe

  body: "I have an early scan of a Polo sketch from 1971. Salden released Polo in
    1972. He had an contract with 6 typesetting companies to make 10 fonts per year
    (fonts, not families). The contract started in January 1972, and Polo was the
    first typeface he delivered.\r\n\r\nBrendel\u2019s Glasgow was made and released
    almost ten years later, in 1980 I believe. And as Albert Jan Pool wrote, Brendel\u2019s
    fonts were based on existing typeface designs. Brendel not only copied Polo but
    also four other fonts by Salden. They are still available at Elsner+Flake.\r\n\r\nWhat
    Gorissen and M\xF6llenst\xE4dt mention is the Diatronic version of Polo, which
    was done 1981/82.\r\n\r\nInteresting in the early Polo sketch: It\u2019s even
    closer to the later Glasgow (see the character e). In the sketch the g is still
    closed. Salden opened it in the released version of 1972. The first Polo release
    was only one font, a bold narrow headline version. More fonts were made until
    1976.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Polo_1971_5901.png]"
