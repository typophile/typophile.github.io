  from the OTF you can download, but I'm struggling with OpenSans. 11 weights as Windows
  TrueType, but I'm thinking it's an OpenType file because it's 940-odd glyphs. When
  I import into Universal Type Server it says the font is damaged and can't be imported.
  I've run Font Doctor and the font is fine. I've tried opening and resaving in FontLab
  (great licensing model from Google lets me do this) but I don't know enough to make
  this work.\r\n\r\nAnyone using using UTS with Google fonts?"

    for Google Web Fonts so I'm interested in figuring this out! :)

  body: Maybe you could take the problem to the makers of Universal Type Server and
    see what they can tell you. It might be that app is choking on the glyph count.
    Or 100 other things. You could delete half or more of the glyphs and then re-export
    and see if that helps.

  body: "Hi Mark,\r\n\r\nWe've tested OpenSans with Universal Type Server 2.1.3 and
    above, and haven't seen any issues. It's possible that there was a corruption
    issue with the font when downloaded. We recommend that you re-download and re-add
    the font to the server.\r\n\r\nFor any additional support, I recommend contacting
    our support team directly at: \r\nhttp://www.extensis.com/support\r\n\r\nJim Kidwell\r\nExtensis"
