  about the font Linea by Umberto Fenocchio as shown below. There was another short
  thread <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/59250\">here</a> but it didn't develop
  much and this <a href=\"http://blog.giofugatype.com/?p=37\">link</a> was already
  included.\r\n\r\nThanks for any help."

    about Fenocchio</a> (0.5 mb) that Hans Reichardt compiled for the Klingspor-Museum
    shows that were at least 9 styles of Linea. Maybe <a href=\"http://typophile.com/user/23726\">Nicola
    Caleffi</a> knows more?"

    really trouble Nicola.

  body: "Thanks that's very kind. If you have a digital image of the specimen and
    no objections to sharing it then of course I'd be interested to see it! I know
    the scans of the Unica specimen caused some stir about copyright here on Typophile,
    I think with the general consensus was that it relatively harmless, so I'll leave
    that with you.\r\n\r\nThanks again."
