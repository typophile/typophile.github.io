    Could you please make your thread title a little more specific next time? \"HELP!!!\"
    is not very helpful, pardon the bad pun. Incidentally, there is a thread explaining
    how this Board works at the top of the list. Its name starts with <a href=\"http://typophile.com/forum/typeid/faq\">Please
    read this first</a>. You migh, like, you know, <em>read</em> it first? O:^)\r\n\r\nAnd
    another thing -- shouting won't get you any quicker response. All it does is mostly
    tick us off. And you <em>don't</em> want to do that. :^P ;^)"
