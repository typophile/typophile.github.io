  train tracks from our building:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typo_FBK_blackletter.jpg]\r\n\r\nI've
  seen other examples of the Forty Blunts Kore tagged around town, but this one is
  the most carefully done. \r\n\r\nAbout once a month, the property owners prepare
  a clean slate, so I needed to snap this picture before the canvas is empty."
