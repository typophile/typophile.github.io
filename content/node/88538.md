  body: I was also interested in this font so I contacted the owner of the site.  He
    emailed me back and said it was a mish mash of 2 fonts,  Handsome Pro and House's
    "League Night". I found it League night here...http://www.fontpark.net/en/font/house-a-rama-league-night/

    Greffrath - I only inspire myself to write manually a word in a logotype I create
    - it's my private stuff for school. and I won't use it commercially, don't worry!
