  body: There's an old film font called Cycle that matches. I don't know if there
    is a digital version. I couldn't find one with that name anyway.

  body: Thanks Mark! Is there a way to get that typeset nowadays? Referral to a shop
    or resource or any other help would be appreciated.

  body: If I knew where it is being carried, I would provide the link. It may very
    well be available under some other name, but I wouldn't know where to start looking.

  body: Maybe it's not even available in a digital format. I looked on the website
    and it says the restaurant opened in 1978. The banner on the website now uses
    Kabel, instead of the font above. And, they've used a substitute font for the
    URL on the card artwork instead of matching the original type.

  body: Turns out it is called Minnett Mystique. Available at one point in dry-transfer
    type sheets by the Graphic Products Corporation.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Minnett_Mystique_5732.png]

  body: "I wonder which is the original name. I pulled out my old Formatt (GPC) catalog,
    and there it is. \r\n\r\nFYI, Formatt lettering worked differently from things
    like Letraset. The type was printed on a translucent adhesive-backed film. You
    cut out the letters and stuck them down to set into words."

  body: Also, FWIW, there doesn't seem to be a digital version under that name either.

    was way easier to use."

  body: Me, too, but I did use Formatt in order to get certain typefaces that nobody
    else had.
