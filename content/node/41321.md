  [[Compressed]]\r\nDesigned by [[Eric Olson]] 2002\u20132005\r\n\r\nDesigned for
  situations where large point sizes and maximum letter count need to coexist, Bryant
  [[Compressed]] is the narrowest of the Bryant families. Sharp stem joins and increased
  contrast \u2014 stylistic departures from the other weights and widths \u2014 allow
  this face to keep the Bryant style while maintaining a narrow width.\r\n"
