  body: "They share a design idea, but I wonder if these aren't all hand-lettered.
    There seem to be minor differences in the proportions of some of the n's, for
    example, and in the counters of the a's. Maybe it's just the details of the images
    and how they were made, not the actual letters, but it's hard for me to say. \r\n\r\nHow
    old are the things these were taken from?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    and the product labels, packaging and logo were designed in 2001.\r\n\r\nthanks!"
