  are better than me. I wonder if loading their fonts into the interface might be
  some sort of 'dust' of copyright infingment. \r\nHow do you learn? Do you print
  out large samples? \r\n\r\nthanks!"

    As long as you aren\u2019t copy/pasting anything into your own work there really
    isn\u2019t a problem."

    is decompiling any more than doing so by looking at the font in Illustrator or
    Indesign. There\u2019s a point where a line is crossed\u2014for example, going
    in and poking around through someone\u2019s Opentype code, or saving it as a VFB
    for whatever reason, but I don\u2019t think that just looking at the letters crosses
    that line."

  body: "I'm a newbie too, and I'm poking around inside & outside(installing and using)
    every font I have.\r\nSystem installed fonts, great designer's fonts, great foundary
    fonts, crappy free online fonts.....anything I can get my hands on.\r\nEverything
    I own will be looked at and learnt from. I never resave, adjust or make any changes
    to any designer's fonts. The legal implications aside, that's the respect they
    deserve at a minimum.\r\n\r\nI don't want to adjust other people's fonts, I want
    to learn from them.\r\nI have a special folder of completed various fonts I've
    collected so I can use as a constant reference, from the widely spread Arial &
    Helvetica, to display fonts, old fonts, and through to grunge and ultra modern.\r\n\r\nIn
    my early days as a Graphic Designer I've pulled apart Graphic Design Companies
    free Clip Art to see how they did gradients, patterns and any other tricks I valued.\r\n\r\nMy
    rule is to learn from the best and build new stuff using any skills or techniques
    you can grab from them.\r\n\r\nYou can't create in a vacuum. \r\nTake it all in.
    It's there to be learnt from. \r\nYou won't be a newbie for long.\r\nCheers\r\n\r\n"
