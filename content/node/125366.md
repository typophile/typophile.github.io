  with a typeface across a new brand (in this case, several cuts of Penumbra) and
  go to try and extend the licence to web usage. And I can't find the option anywhere.
  Myfonts don't allow webfont purchase for Adobe fonts, same on Fontspring, but when
  I look on the Typekit (which according to the Adobe site: 'All of Adobe's fonts
  are now available on Typekit.com as part of the Typekit subscription library'),
  it's nowhere to be found.\r\n\r\nIs that 'All' a mistake? Should that not include
  Penumbra? Should I be looking somewhere else? Or is it time to start looking for
  webfont alternatives? Thanks."

  body: Hi Jim. Sorry for the confusion. It's true that "all" is incorrect there,
    and we'll change the text. Some of Adobe's fonts, including Penumbra, have been
    kept out of Typekit (and any web licensing) due to licensing complications here
    at Adobe. We are actually working on a solution to that right now, but I can't
    give you any timetable or promises about that.
