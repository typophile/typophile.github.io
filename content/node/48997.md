body: "In earlier versions of Minion Cyrillic and Minion Pro, up to and including
  Font Folio OT, Cyrillic 'u' was distinct from Latin 'y' (slight curve on the tail).
  However, I have just noticed that in the version of Minion that ships with InDesign
  CS3, the distinctive Cyrillic sort has gone. One imagines this couldn't have been
  accidental -- and yet... the current edition of the printed Adobe Type Library Reference
  Book still illustrates the special Cyrillic variant, as did all previous editions;
  it is also shown in the downloadable glyph complement pdf. Can anyone cast any light
  on this?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/minion_cyr_u_4142.jpg]"

  body: "George, thanks for bringing this issue to our attention. We were actually
    not aware of it. The replacement of the Cyrillic \u2019u\u2019 by the Latin 'y'
    was unintentional. It might have happened some time ago when support for Vietnamese
    was added to the family. A bug has been logged and the Cyrillic 'u' (along with
    the accented versions of it) will be reverted back to the former shape next time
    the fonts gets revised. Currently there's no estimate of when that will happen.
    As for the Type Reference Book and the Glyph Complement PDFs, they're certainly
    using some old version of the fonts."
