  body: ' or just concentrate on curvy serifs and keep the rest straight.  <BR> <BR>the
    first thing I noticed that bothered me a little was the baselines...they change
    too much, but maybe your not at that point yet? '

    like, such as the width of the &#34;z&#34;, which disrupts the flow when reading&#40;this
    happens a bit with the &#34;r&#34; too&#41;, and the numbers, which have all square
    endings, none of the lovely organic &#34;tentacles&#34;. '

  body: The &#34;a&#34; looks way too much like a &#34;d&#34; to me. I &#39;d suggest
    making the bowl smaller for that character or eliminate the stem altogether.  <BR>  <BR>Also,
    I&#39;d have to agree with Tanya. I&#39;d like to it see with a more even baseline.
    I might not like it, but I&#39;d like to see it.  <BR>  <BR>sean

  body: Actually, I&#39;d say the font fits your sample use quite well. Readable enough
    to elucidate the ideas of the text, but disruptive enough to slow the reader and
    encourage further thought. This will work great for pull-out quotes and other
    short settings. <BR> <BR>Your <b>a</b> is just right, toeing the line between
    roman and italic forms. While not entirely legible, it&#39;s easily readable and,
    to my mind, works well. <BR> <BR>I very much like how the <b>t</b> combines with
    the <b>h</b>, where the swash of the <b>t</b> seems to complete the stem of the
    <b>h</b>. <BR> <BR>Resist the urge to normalize this font by evening the baseline.
    The sample settings escape the feel of bars of text, enriching the sprawling organic
    feel of the character shapes.

  body: 'In Response to Victors comment : <BR> <BR>&#34;dont take it personal, but
    its awful. Experimental, yes. but horrible. if this was your intention, then good
    for you&#34; <BR> <BR>Your comment says very little. Maybe you could elaborate
    on &#34;horrible&#34;. Also, try to imagine this font in a complimentary setting.
    Someone made a comment earlier about it having a Tim Burton feel... there&#39;s
    a saying in art: There are no ugly colors, only combinations. <BR> <BR>&#34;i
    hope they dont thrown me out of this very politically correct forum but its my
    heart right out...&#34; <BR> <BR>It&#39;s more about being coutreous/constructive
    than being politically correct. Criticism is what the critiques are all about,
    but I&#39;m pretty sure that they&#39;re more about the constructive kind than
    just saying that something is awful without an explanation. <BR>'

  body: 'Thanks for your comments, guys. <BR> <BR>Victor: Heh heh heh.... I&#39;m
    not offended. I figured out long ago that my taste in type is very different than
    most others&#39; here. You were probably saying bluntly what a lot of other people
    were thinking. <BR> <BR>But as Craig mentioned, Victor, there is an art to critique
    that generally involves backing up your comments -- both positive and negative
    -- by explaining your thought process. That is usually a lot more helpful to the
    critiqued individual. <BR> <BR>Thanks and have a great day.'
