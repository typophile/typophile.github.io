  languages, especially Hindi. It appears to be on the translator's end \u2014 the
  file she sent isn't Unicode. \r\n\r\nI'm wondering if anyone knows of resources
  that address multilingual issues for:\r\na) Translators \u2014 to instruct them
  on file preparation\r\nb) Designers \u2014 to instruct us on typesetting\r\n\r\nThis
  isn't the first language headache I've had, and it's not one particular group of
  languages that I struggle with. I'm hoping for a big resource that will answer all
  my questions. Fingers crossed!\r\n\r\nSuggestions would be much appreciated!"

  body: Thanks riccard0. I'm using InDesign with Fedra Hindi and Indic Plus. This
    particular problem is because the translator has used a font with a proprietary
    encoding and is not too computer savvy so I'm having to walk her through the process
    of installing Devanagari language support and Unicode fonts on Windows. And I'm
    not Hindi savvy, so that doesn't help either!

  body: The first thing you should do is find out what software she used to create
    the original file. It's possible that from that information, you could find out
    how it is encoded, and then find a resource with which to translate it to Unicode,
    so as to avoid retyping.

  body: "Ulee, you are correct. When working with Indic languages, it's important
    to establish which encoding to use before the translator keys the text. We do
    a lot of [[http://www.worldaccent.com/hindi/typesetting|Hindi typesetting]] and
    this comes up time and again. \r\n\r\nIt sounds as if there was not too much text,
    and the translator was able to re-type the text as Unicode. Hopefully that has
    fixed your problem. \r\n\r\nIf not, it may well be possible to convert, although
    this is often an involved process and in my experience can introduce some character
    errors. The other possibility is to set in the font the translator has used. All
    pre-Unicode Indic fonts were \"proprietary\" encodings but it is possible to use
    some of these in InDesign."

    when I do I try to work with translation services that I know to be computer-saavy.
    Generally I just turn over the English InDesign file to them and they do the translation
    and also revise the InDesign file. Because since I don't speak the language, I
    wouldn't have the vaguest idea whether the hyphenation is correct or not, or if
    the accents are correct in that font, and so forth, so I'd rather leave that to
    them.\r\n\r\nOne of my corporate clients has most of their pieces translated in
    foreign languages and the company they use is asisttranslations.com."
