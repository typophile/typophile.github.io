body: "This is the wall calendar for the year 2010. It's made of two thousand and
  ten keyboard keys. This design offers a new visual experience of time, differently
  than your average wall calendar. It looks beautiful on the wall, and makes finding
  dates and marking events a creative process.\r\n\r\nThe size of the print is B0
  (70cm x 100cm / 27.56\u201D x 39.37\u201D).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/70100_300dpi_6349.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  printing is done with a standard 4c offset printing machine on 135g/m2 glossy paper,
  finished with a UV coating to protect the colors from bleaching. The UV coating
  also provides protection against water and dust.\r\n\r\nShipping:\r\n\r\nWorldwide
  shipping (folded in a protected envelope) is included in the price of $20.10. \r\n\r\nFor
  $9.90 extra the wall calendar will be sent rolled in a reusable plastic tube.\r\n\r\nIf
  you decide to order two or more wall calendars, world wide shipping (rolled in reusable
  tubes) is FREE!\r\n\r\nOrders:\r\n\r\nOrders can be made through Etsy <a href=\"http://www.etsy.com/view_listing.php?listing_id=37601980\">http://www.etsy.com/view_listing.php?listing_id=37601980</a>
  or my <a href=\"http://haraldgeisler.com\">(beta-) Website</a>.\r\n\r\nCritique:\r\nIs
