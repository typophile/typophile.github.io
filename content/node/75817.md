body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nFor a paper I am preparing about the creative inspirations behind
  the birth of a typeface, I would like to know the various reasons for their birth
  according to each one of you who have designed a typeface. \r\n\r\nWhy do you design
  a typeface? \r\nWhat makes you want to design a typeface?\r\nWhat is the germ of
  inspiration?\r\nWhich are the points of departure?\r\nand\r\nWhat stages does typeface
  undergo from the initial concept to the final design?\r\n\r\nI would be grateful
  if I can draw upon your wealth of experience to arrive at a few generalisations.
  Any link, image, quote, paper, publication related to this theme would be a valuable
  input and would be credited.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

    awareness, i.e. they know why they do what they do.\r\nAnd further, that their
    self awareness is true, rather than being self-deception or self-promotion, AKA
    marketing BS.\r\n"

    The Creative Characters site is also an excellent source. \r\n\r\nI agree, some
    typefaces might often take birth by accident, without much thought. But if you
    look back may be you can find some reasons for their birth which is what I would
    like to find out. May be I should leave the marketing or promotional aspects (which
    only come much later) aside and focus only on their birth aspects.\r\n\r\nIn my
    preliminary studies, I have made some generalisations. Do let me know if I am
    wrong or if you think otherwise. Some typefaces may belong to more than one category.\r\n\r\nReasons
    for designing a typefaces can be any of the following:\r\n1. Commissioning for
    a particular purpose say for newspaper text (Gaurdian, Melior, Utopia), as a corporate
    typeface etc.\r\n3. Faithful recuts/ revivals for contemporary use ( many versions
    of Garamond, Baskerville, Caslon, Bodoni etc.)\r\n2. Inspired revival of an old
    classic for contemporary use (Sabon, Farnham, Miller etc.)\r\n3. Making the best
    use of the current technology (Swift, Charter, Lucida, Verdana, Georgia)\r\n4.
    Accidental inspirations: a glimpse of hand lettering, street signs, inscription,
    elements in Nature, more...? (Optima, Trajan, etc.)\r\n5. Adaptation/ amalgam
    of a few existing typeface concepts to create something new (Any names here?)\r\n6.
    Self-expression: some typefaces are designed to satisfy the designer's urge to
    express. (Mistral, Zapfino, Caflish script etc.)\r\nDo only (or all) the script
    fonts belong to this category?\r\nWhere do you slot the seemingly calligraphic
    fonts like Palatino, Photina, Baker Signet etc?\r\n7. Designers in non-Roman scripts
    also have the thousands of successful Roman typefaces as their fountain of inspiration.
    (Helvetica Arabic?)\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?"
