  to make a poster-sized fat face that has its base in the geometrics that Non-Format
  and such use, but with a feminine and humanist feel (e.g. Odile). I started out
  trying to add this curly bifurcated serif, and have been steadily trying to calm
  it down, but am definitely getting stuck.\r\n\r\nCommentary I've already received
  -- add countershapes .... I'm reluctant to do this, because I feel it loses a bit
  of the power and contemporary feel. It feels like it starts to go cartoony, Gills
  Sans UltraBold territory. To do small dots, like Christian Robertson's TypeBattle
  28/Defiant doesn't seem to fit here either.\r\n\r\nBut maybe I'm wrong. Anyways,
  feel like I'm just nudging around without making a bold move, so any insights would
  be great, thanks!!!!!! \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typophile_post_1_3575.png]"

  body: "I really like how you eliminate and invented new letter anatomy. f seems
    like it doesn't belong to the group, it look very normal. c look like e, h and
    k are hard to identify (or is there is no k, just two h ?). is there two n too?
    a and n look kinna similar, what if you eliminate the extension on top of a ?\r\n\r\nI
    think adding counter space (like the white circle dot of b and a) is just ruining
    the look. Perhaps, for example letter b, you could draw a thin vertical stroke
    with curve end from where the intersection of the bowl and the vertical stroke
    down to the white dot, about half way to the white dot, you might like it, or
    not ... i really like g, and the word: hills.joins is kinna hard to read, look
    like joms because only i and m are touch."

  body: "Revisions! I've developed more of the letters (still need v-z) and am not
    entirely convinced by \"c\" or \"e\", but have a much clearer vision overall,
    and have done some major cleanup.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts or suggestions are welcome!

  body: "Since you don't have much of the letter counterspace, that's hard to recognize
    the silhouette of the whole letter before look at the anatomy of the letter. For
    example, lot of letter look like 'o' if you take their counterspace away, like
    a c, e, s, they all 'ball' up in a round shape. Maybe a little more counterspace
    will help to define and distinguish them from each other, like how you did to
    letter h and k, m and n.\r\n\r\nSeem like not many ppl like to comment on this
    typeface. Is it gonna release for free? I think it'll be fun for other designer
    to play around with it."

  body: "Thanks for your thoughts again, ahnhng!\r\n\r\nI think you make a good point
    - I've been struggling with those letters and I like your prescription of chipping
    away in a more drastic manner - I've definitely been shy about doing it for the
    \"a\" and \"s\" especially because I've fallen in love with the individual characters,
    but I need to just do a rev where I have no soft spots!\r\n\r\nHaha, well, I certainly
    appreciate your insights, they help keep me going! I would love to release it
    for free for people to use - I just need to finish it (with caps I hope!) so I
    don't totally embarrass myself. Will keep you posted!\r\n\r\n:D\r\n\r\n................................\r\nwww.superchen.com"
