body: "Hi!\r\n\r\nThis is my first post on this Forum and more importantly my first
  ever attempt at designing a font.\r\n\r\nI've only been working in Illustrator at
  this point because I don't have any Font software yet (Are there any advantages
  to working in a specialist font application at this early stage of the design process?).\r\n\r\nI
  would appreciate it if you would be willing to have a look at my attached document
  and give me some critique. I'd also like to know if there are any similar fonts
  to this already - if there are then I don't really want to waste anybody's time.\r\n\r\nI'm
  hoping to use the font for Logos and possibly some document headings.\r\n\r\nLooking
  forward to your critique so that I can improve this.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\nSam"

  body: "Hi Sam\r\nYou should think about the pen-metaphor used in the construction
    of the characters. Take for instance K and compare it to the other charaters -
    it's upside down. In general you should be more consequent with the stem- and
    stroke widths. Compare eg. M with V. The S is really out of character with the
    rest, and I think it's because you try to force the squarish concept. Other characters
    that suffer somewhat from this are BCG."

  body: "Hi Sam, as a first attempt your Meridian is very promising. I do think you
    might want to have a look at the upper-right corners of letters such as BCDEGOPQR,
    to me the curve looks too steep. Same thing with the upper-left corners of HIJKLMNUVWXY.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    I know it\u2019s hard to come up with font names but if you intend to put out
    Meridian on the retail market I think you\u2019d be better off renaming it to
    something else to avoid confusion with Adrian Frutiger\u2019s own <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/meridien/\">Meridien</a>.
    \r\n\r\n(BTW: I\u2019ve been in Liverpool for a couple of days last month, nice
    city!)"

  body: "Thanks to you both for your comments. It sounds like I have a lot of work
    to do.\r\n\r\nClauses - I'm obviously a real novice at this as I can't even understand/see
    what you mean when you say the \"K\" is upside down?\r\nI understand the problem
    with the Stem and Stroke widths so I'll start working on that first.\r\n\r\nVerbosus
    - When you say \"the curve looks too steep\" do you mean that the radius should
    be tighter (smaller/more square) or bigger (more round)?\r\nI'm not thinking of
    this becoming commercial at this stage but thanks for letting me know about the
    other font name. And if you're ever in Liverpool again, you're welcome to visit
    my studio.\r\n\r\nSam"

  body: "Hi Sam. In the K the arm should be thin and the leg should be thick, not
    the other way around. That would be the logical outcome of using a broadnip pen
    to draw the letterforms \u2013 think calligraphy.\r\n\r\nThere is a very good
    website about typedesign by Briem here: http://briem.ismennt.is/2/2.3.1a/2.3.1.01.notes.htm\r\n\r\nand
    a good guide on handwriting/calligraphy here: http://briem.ismennt.is/4/4.1.1a/4.1.1.1.quick.htm\r\n\r\nHope
    it helps..."

  body: "Hi Sam.\r\n\r\nSome of your curves (let's take for instance G top right)
    are not italicised. They are just round. And they clash with italic form of your
    characters.\r\n\r\nSome of the letters are nice like: A,D,E,F,H,I,J,L,M,N,W,X,Y
    and Z. Others need more work to complement the later."

    a pro of drawing letters, lots of typophile members are great one, but at my point
    of view, That depends on your objective. If it is to draw a complete typeface
    family I' strongly suggest to use a drawing typeface software, you'll take advantage
    of it's special feature. If  it's to draw some letter for a logo, without any
    objective of getting a typeface you could continue with Illustrator. I've made
    the switch from Illustrator to Fontlab, two years ago and I never regret my choice.
    I continue to work with Illustrator for some specific needs in illustration, but
    for the typeface I work on, my typeface drawing software is really suit for. For
    instance, with FL, you'll be able to fix the kerning, the spacing or hinting,
    some action that Illustrator can not do. Hoping that will help you. Good luck."

  body: 'Regarding your concern that this design might already exist, I am not sure
    it pays to worry overly about that. Just learn how to see the forms and get them
    working together - that''s a big enough challenge. And in the case of fonts with
    this style generally it''s a standard that is rarely met. Quality always wins. '
