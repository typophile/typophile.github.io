  body: Interesting dilemma about the P and R. To me it seems you might have two fonts
    here, the middle two lines (H-M and O-T) look like a different (darker) font to
    the rest because they're not using hairlines in the same way. I'd go one way or
    the other, and make it consistent throughout.

    Then it would have just one heavy stroke, the crossbar. Too wacky, or just wacky
    enough for "flawed and handmade"?

  body: "This is progressing pretty nice!\r\n\r\nHave you considered making the /O/
    and /Q/ in similar fashion as you are now doing with /B D, P/ and /R/? Asymmetrical
    that is? Im saying because I kinda agree with Bendy, there seem to be two systems
    in use within the font right now for using thin or thick strokes.\r\n\r\nThe other
    option would be to use the thin strokes only as horizontals/bars and as serifs,
    and make everything else thick. So stick with the original /K/ (you could also
    add serifs on the right side ad you did with the new /K/) and alter /B, D/ etc?
    That said, the thick/thin contrast is probably what makes the latest version so
    interesting - so you might want to stick with the current route.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    have you considered using a thin stroke for the tail of the /Q/ instead of a thick
    one?\r\n\r\nLove the /E/ and /K/ by the way, nicely shaped!"

    again, if you have to make a consistency call, i'd go for both new versions for
    sure.\r\n\r\nI also wonder, now that you are using this in the /n/, should you
    consider the /p/ /b/ and  /d/ too? How about /p/ and /q/? They have the same 'filled
    gap' (if you see what i mean) that you are now leaving unfilled in the new /n/
    and /m/.\r\n\r\nAlso, did you have to change the name for Magnolia into Magnel
    for some reason??\r\nStill love that typeface!"

    for logo work for example.  I use them like an expanded version of the face, often
    times without the tall caps at all.  I agree about connecting the rules, that
    would be a fantastic touch.
