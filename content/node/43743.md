  work to produce some works in the class.  I really like the serif fonts used in
  the body and titles of \"W\" Magazine but I just can\u2019t figure out what they
  are.  I don\u2019t think they are the same font either. Every time I get close on
  a font finder, it\u2019s still not quite right. They remind me of Bembo, and searches
  I came up with were Hoeffler Text or versions of garamond but, I just dont think
  they are quite right. I am also wondering exactly what the san serif font they use
  in the inside is for body and subheads.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m just so frusterated in this
  search. If anyone could help me, I would greatly appreciate it."

    did custom display faces for W. Freight Micro by Joshua is the closest thing that
    is available to the public. Not sure what the body text is. Haven't seen an issue
    in some time.\r\n\r\nTry to post samples.\r\n\r\nDavid"
