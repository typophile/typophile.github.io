    claims some kind of trademark over the symbol you should be good (in my non-lawyerly
    opinion). There are other symbols in system fonts that may be more problematic
    (eg., the Apple logo) but this one seems safe. \r\n\r\nCheers, Si\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    just Apple) and therefore should be safe. See here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_symbol\r\n"
