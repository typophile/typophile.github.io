  body: "I think Moonraker is <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&startrow=1&records=&currpage=1&totalrecords=3&displayfontid=E.78.0.0&fontRendererText=WOOVRAKER\"
    target=\"new\">Emigr\xE9 Modula Sans</a>, with the W and V inverted to become
    the M and N, and a tweak to the stem of the R. (An old font called Institution
    had the same R as Moonraker, but would also have had to invert the W & V).\r\n\r\n
