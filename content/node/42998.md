    (Gareth Hagues, Alias)</a>\r\n\r\n<em>\xBBProgress is developed from another Alias
    typeface, Enabler. It features the pinched forms and strategically positioned
    curves of Enabler, but has purified, rounder, more organic forms, and has been
    fleshed out into 5 weights. Progress is a fluid, streamlined and dynamic type
    for short blocks of text and headline use.\xAB</em>\r\n"
