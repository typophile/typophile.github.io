  and what makes it worse is that I believe I once identified it and have since forgotten.
  My mind is a sieve, but I usually remember font names, apparently not this time.\r\n\r\nThe
  closest I could come up with would be a condensed version of Sahara Bodoni, but
  I fear it's actually a Didot and not a Bodoni. Another one that was suggested to
  me was Bitstream Industrial 700, but I was told that is not quite correct either.\r\n\r\nIt's
  lovely and driving me mad, any ideas?\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://typophile.com/files/22_vgogh.jpg\"

    close.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/didi_all_3644.gif]

  body: "Norbert, I just spoke with Stephen Coles and he agrees with you.\r\n\r\nThis
    is what he told me.\r\nThis series has been on Typophile a few times. As I remember
    the publisher digitized ITC Didi, a 1970s photo font. It's not available publicly.
    Similars include Didona, Moderno, Benton Modern, and Veer/Jukebox's digitization
    of Pistilli Roman.\r\n\r\nI guess the case is closed, thank you both Norbert and
    Stephen."

  body: "Agreed, Hrant. Especially since I recall seeing several beautiful Catalan
    type designs while in Barcelona. I don't know of any lettering directly attributed
    to Antoni Gaud\xED either... Anyone?"
