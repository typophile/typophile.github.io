  body: I saw this over at Fontmarketplace. And though I support Microsoft efforts
    to enhance typographic features in Word, a program used by so many people, why
    did they not choose typefaces where this would really have a point, like Times
    New Roman or Georgia. I don't really see the point of old-style numerals in Comic
    Sans... :-)
