  back my typeface \u201CCristoforo\u201D via Kickstarter]], and choose from cool
  typographic goodies, including the fonts themselves.\r\n\r\nCristoforo is a revival
  of some classic Victorian typefaces by Hermann Ihlenburg. It\u2019s also known as
  the typeface of Call of Cthulhu, the H.P. Lovecraft roleplaying game, and as the
  original logo for Cracker Jack.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Cristoforo-Kickstarter-headline-image-spaced_5633.gif]\r\n\r\nThe
  campaign will only last until midnight on Saturday May 19. Basically, people pledge
  money for fonts and other goodies up front so I know the project is viable. Reward
  options for backers depend on their funding level, and include not only the fonts,
  but computer desktop wallpaper, postcards, T-\u200B\u200Bshirts and posters.\r\n\r\nKickstarter
  is all or nothing. Only if the total pledges exceed the minimum funding target are
  people\u2019s credit cards charged and the project moves forward.\r\n\r\nIf funding
  exceeds the minimum by enough of a margin, I can add more language support for central/\u200Beastern
  Europe, and even pay an intern!"

    to see it superhinted for use at small sizes on screen, then no. But I expect
    it to see a fair bit of use on screen, just because that's how the world works
    these days. It's very much a display typeface, however, so it likely won't have
    a lot of fine tuning for the screen....\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    done. But, uh, it's problematical. What if you get hit by a truck in the interim,
    before the money can be returned? (Sorry to be so grim, but stuff like that happens
    all the time.) Does Kickstarter have any provision for a project that gets funded
    but never begins for one reason or another?\r\n\r\n$8,000 at the outset seemed
    a little optimistic.  (Although what formula one could use to come up with a more
    \"fundable\" amount beats the heck out of me.)\r\nIf you're doing a talk about
    it, you might want to know about voyeurs like me: in addition to boosting your
    efforts with a link/post on Facebook, I also kept an eye on the totals. But by
    the last week it was clear that, barring a mighty big contributor, the project
    wasn't going to meet the required funding so I didn't bother pledging. It wouldn't
    have made a diff. I wonder if there were others keeping watch."

    Plus unless you have cashflow problems (like me...) you can just -indirectly-
    put up the missing money yourself (you will however lose the cut that Kickstarter
    takes).\r\n\r\nBTW, I think Jackson might feel uncomfortable because this is mildly
    reminiscent of begging, and the uncertainly of success is an extra stigma. But
    I personally think it's a great tool if used well (and Thomas was on the right
    track, it's just that people -still- undervalue quality type design).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    the rewards decided, all the time invested in the write-up and the beginning of
    a video. Then, I changed my mind and decided not to do it. My reasoning was that
    I didn't want to be accountable to anyone and I wanted the time-frame to be as
    long as I needed. The money would have been extremely helpful, of course, but
    I figured actually doing it myself would be more rewarding.\r\n\r\nI also didn't

    How does it ask other people to assume the risk? Do you mean the risk that the
    fonts/project won't actually be completed? (The money never changes hands if the
    pledges don't reach the goal, so there's no risk to either side on that count.)"

    And you can always pay somebody else to make the shirts for example, the same
    way many type designers pay third parties to make a site for them. This BTW is
    where a font house can come in: they take care of all the boring stuff, and the
