  body: WOW! now that&#39;s rad! the q and the v are a bit unreadable to my eyes,
    however. do you plan on somehow converting this to a font format?

  body: Aaron, that sure is cool. I love the e y and t. I&#39;m with Paul on the q
    and v. On some letters the vertical  stems &#40;or are they posts or columns in
    this case?&#41; look too thick, like on the p, the q and the y. The shapes of
    s and z are really nice but maybe they can ascend higher in their imaginary cube
    &#40;or is it qube?&#41;. <BR> <BR>Nice and original. <BR> <BR>Jon

  body: Aaron, nice to see you on Typophile. <BR> <BR>I think I mentioned the same
    thing that Paul stated above when you first showed me this face - I wondered how
    it would translate to a standard font format as well. Maybe it can&#39;t translate.
    Perhaps it&#39;s destined to be a cut and paste modular system for motion graphics
    or other such application. The flavor of this type of experimentation recalls
    some of the work that has been presented in Rick Valicenti&#39;s <a href="http://rickvalicenti.com/playground/">Playground</a>
    or in his faces like <a href="http://thirstype.com/playground_handsome.html">Handsome</a>.  <BR>I
    really like the way that some characters feel vaguely Cyrillic. <BR> <BR>If this
    were to be developed as a standard font, you might be able to create different
    weights for each side of the three-d shapes &#40;x-axis, y-axis, z-axis&#41;.
    That way you could customize the colour and shading of the text by overlaying
    and adjusting the various weights. <BR> <BR>Anyway, bring on the numerals. <BR>
    <BR>Oh, and an @ sign too.

  body: 'Neat. The only thing I see as a &#34;must fix&#34; is that a <b>v</b> shouldn&#39;t
    have a tail; it defeats the effort of distinguishing it from the <b>u</b>. Other
    comments: A traditional lowercase <b>q</b> might look better. It bothers me some
    that the <b>s</b> and <b>z</b> are &#34;flat.&#34; I would want to depart from
    the template a little to give the <b>j</b> a curve; I realize that means introducing
    a blue-to-red gradient.'

  body: Actually, after looking at it again, I think the whole thing would look infinitely
    better if the x-height of everything else were extended to be consistent with
    the <b>a</b>. Sort of like a blackletter lc.

  body: Aaron, <BR> <BR>I really like this. The only comments I have are pertaining
    to the character widths and heights of some. I thnk the &#34;e&#34; and &#34;s&#34;
    would benifit from some more negative spaces. they feel kinda squat because of
    the vanishing point effect. and Conversely I would close up a bit of space on
    all of the descenders and a couple other characters; g, n, k, m, p, q, w, and
    y. Because of the vanishing point some characters feel much wider and more open
    than others. The forms themselves are great though. I think that making the spaces
    a little more equal will only help to make it more usable. <BR> <BR>For a more
    traditional black/white type approach, check out CUBA at <a href="http://www.cubanica.com"
    target="_blank">www.cubanica.com</a> for a similiar TreeDee effect. although yours
    is peculiar because it has the rounded aspects that work best with the gradient.
    those will unfortunately be lost in b/w. <BR> <BR>Nice work. <BR> <BR>Christian
