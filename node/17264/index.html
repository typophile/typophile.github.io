  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello people,

I need some crit on a logo that I am doing for a personal project (don't they seem like the hardest ones?), it's a website that is basically a web zine. The topic is vegan/vegetarian/DIY/indie subculture with accent on recipes and basically food and drink, but what's more important--education of people here (Serbia) on the topic of veganism/vegetarianism, because when you tell someone you don't eat meat here you look like a freak. So I want it to be very appealing visually, I am not looking for "deep meaning and clever" here, just plain sweet and mild, therefore the ferlauf (sorry--gradients). :)

The concept is that I took the word "herbivore" and played around with it resulting in "herbiv.org" for both the internet adress (obviously) and the mag name, it's in the pronounceation where you'll find the most similarity between those two. :)
It's shorter than herbivore.org and I think more clever and memorable, at least for me, <strong>but I'm interested what do you guys think?</strong>

As far as the logo itself is concerned, I just made the "g" nibble on the leaf--as the last logo says itself.

(For claricication <a href="http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y38/TheJay/herbivorg.png">here are the logo versions</a> (213kB) and <a href="http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y38/TheJay/herbivorg_colors_and_favorite.png">here is the direction I have decided to go along with the color versions</a> (518kB), the last bigger one is my current pick.) </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Haha i love the URL. Its the opposite of cnet's news.com.com, where you've built the url into the word as opposed to extend the word to the url.

Logo: glad you didnt go with the 213kb versions - it was quite illegible on first impressions. Your current pick is the best of them so far imho.

		<div class="commentbody">I prefer the Clarendon version (that maybe that I'm into Clarendon at the moment), although it will have an advantage over the didone at small sizes. I'm not sure that the leaf really explains/elaborates on vegetarianism, maybe a more distinctive vegetable would work. Your strapline will need adjusting for size and seems a bit close to the main body of the logo.

@ Tim:
I was planning to ditch the "strapline" (I had to look this one up! :)) on everything but the header or something along those lines, I don't think it's that necessary (to be on every aplication of the logo).

You may have a point on the plain leaf thing, can you maybe suggest something that I can't think of or haven't taken in concern yet?

EDIT:
> "I was planning to ditch the “strapline” (I had to look this one up! :)) on everything but the header..."
I was referring to the website header. :)

PS

That Clarendon sure is sexy now that I look at it. It grew on me actually, since it is the original idea (it was in the first iteration of the logo).

I was kind of hoping you wouldn't ask that because nothing leapt to mind, maybe you could use an abstract green square/cube or a cabbage/cauliflower/lettuce or a mushroom.
