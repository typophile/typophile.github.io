  <BR> <BR>Its theme is;  World Cities:  Where the future lives. <BR> <BR>I guess
  through my teacher they are going to pick a poster from my class that will be plastered
  throughout the city next year.  This  concept is the one that my class picked for
  me out of the three that I showed them.  I am not sure it says what the title says.
  What do yall think?  Do you think I should try to come up with another idea.  I
  would really want to take advantage of this situation. <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/51330.gif"
  alt=""> <BR> <BR> <BR>btw I have another idea i never photographed it because I
  thought it might be hard to execute  <BR> <BR>It was to have a robot and women &#40;mother
  earth&#41; shaking hands it would only feature their hands close up and it would
  show that we are going to make a commitment to the future to improve our cities.'

  body: Gregory, I find the skyline shilohette upside down disturbing and unnessary.
    I&#39;m from Manhattan and skyline shilos bother me since 9/11. Next the photo
    looks like the aftermath of a nuclear explosion. No buildings, no people, no animals,
    just leaves not growing up but strewed along a &#40;barren airport?&#41;. Hardly
    what I would like to experience in an urban green environment. <BR> <BR>What I
    suggest is show positive aspects of new urban living. Wind fans generating electricity,
    parks, people planting trees on urban streets, public transportation. If you can
    do something abstract try emulating the 60s poster approach like a flower sticking
    out of a power plant smoke stack. <BR> <BR>Finally, you have &#34;World Environment
    Day&#34; but no date. You have to have a date. Investigate another typeface for
    &#34;Green Cities&#34; too much Gill Sans for my taste. &#34;Where the future
    lives&#34; doesn&#39;t mean anything. &#34;Where our future lives&#34; is somewhat
    better but need explaination and you have plenity of room on a poster to do it.
    Does the poster want someone to do something or just know the day exists. If its
    proactive have contact information, phone numbers

    of new urban living.   <BR> <BR>I really dislike this idea but i feel stuck,  you
    just gave me the push i needed. I will update some ideas by the middle of next
    week. <BR> <BR>just so you know Green Cities: Where the future lives. is the theme
    , United Nations, picked for the conference. I fogot to mention that I didnt put
    the date or web addy for people to contact.'

  body: Gregory, one more thought. When you fly a flag upside down it mean distress.
    That the feeling I get from the Shilohette skyline

  body: Gregory, nice work! Try one thing try making the city skyline a brighter green
    and lighten the sun sky. One question what does the circle arrow mean? Last thought
    flush left the date and website to San Francisco.

    people pointed out, but it&#39;s more interesting to me.

  body: 'thnx for the feedback. <BR> <BR>John:  its funny because everyone ive shown
    the first one too said they liked it but when I tell them I feel like it has no
    meaning to me, they still say they like it  .  Maybe I should have developed it
    or tried to make a concept out of it, but I decided to move on. <BR> <BR>Daniel:  the
    arrow is supposed to represent a cycle.  I wanted to show that the city is a cycle.  Similar
    to the cycle in research and development. Constantly trying things and then when
    they dont work, you try them again.  I guess I was trying to address the technology
    part.  Iam unsure that it reads right; and now that you have questioned it. I
    may take it out.  I will see what I can do with the colors.  This is due soon
    and I need to send it to the printer.  Thnx for your advice! <BR> <BR>Overall
    iam bummed on the outcome!  I like the new direction better. I learned from this
    process that communication is hard.  I usually dont get most posters or design
    and as a result its hard for me to communicate to others.  Ive had some more simple
    ideas but i didnt think they were fresh or visual compelling which a poster is
    supposed to be. In general book covers and posters are hard for me.  I  am starting
    to realize my interests are identity and typoghraphy.'

  body: 'gregory ... a few things stands out as needing work,  <BR>if you indeed keep
    your current layout. <BR> <BR>&#42; the butterflies are detailed and correct,
    shapewise,  <BR>while the ladybug is a simple circle, rather than its true shape.
    <BR> <BR>&#42; I expected to see more GREEN in the design, but it feels <BR>more
    like something for a Ciudad del Sol, than Green City. <BR> <BR>&#42; the word
    cities is kind of a strange, when it sits <BR>by itself. I think you can do something
    better with cities <BR>than Scriptina out of the box. Take a look at: <BR> <BR>-
    the i-t-i combination. There is a possibility for some <BR>life here. <BR>- extending
    the s with a longer finishing stroke. <BR>- the t swash that gets too close to
    the e. <BR> <BR>If you sketch some letterforms on a piece of paper, <BR>you&#39;ll
    see that your hand can create something better <BR>than what you have. Sketching
    is a good thing...  <BR>Or get a calligraphy pen at  <BR>an art store and write
    on a napkin ... the ink bleed is beautiful. <BR> <BR>bj'

  body: don&#39;t abandon the first idea.  it&#39;s more captivating.  the huge yellow
    mass is not exciting me.  <BR> <BR>but if you must, <BR>--take some white out
    of the pink butterfly--make it a little darker than yellow background. <BR> <BR>--GREEN
    and &#39;cities&#39; needs help.  i almost like your first approach better, where
    there wasn&#39;t any strong contrast between the words.  also, mixed case Gill
    Sans is friendlier than the all caps you switched to. <BR> <BR>--bj is right,
    the ladybug cartoon doesn&#39;t fit in with the butterflies. <BR> <BR>--try switching
    yellow and green.

  body: thnx bj and loren for your additional comments. <BR> <BR>Unfortunately I got
    sick and didnt do much to the last version and turned it in.   <BR> <BR>The actual
    critique was really bad and I dont think one positive thing was said about my
    peice.  I guess I was trying to take a risk with this peice because my teacher
    is always saying that I try to be to safe with my typography.   <BR> <BR>Graphic
    design is hard!
