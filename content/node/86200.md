body: "Hey people,\r\n\r\nWhen I just started to get into typedesign, I was convinced
  that Myfonts.com was everything. If it wasn't on Myfonts.com, it didn't mean anything
  to me. As I progress I'm starting to find more and more foundries not selling their
  fonts through Myfonts.com. Myfonts being (I don't know the numbers, but it seems
  kind of obvious to me) the largest reseller of fonts, a foundry is very likely to
  sell more with, than without Myfonts.com, no? So why is it that some decide to go
  for Fontshop.com, or any other reseller, only?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJasper"

    found. Think K-mart vs. a gourmet shop. It's more likely to be used by people
    who know what they're doing.

    how to use it anyway. If you can get a financial bonus by selling to poeple who
    don't know what their buying at all (Myfonts.com), why wouldn't you? You can hardly
    call that unfair...

  body: Perceived value is is one reason. though I think it's faded in this case as
    MyFonts has improved. Another is that FontShop (and perhaps other resellers) might
    offer special benefits for exclusivity, such as extra promotion, more prominent
    placement and display, and a better share of the retail price. You might also
    want to submit your fonts to a foundry, or maybe none of the above and sell directly
    from your own site. I outline some of the considerations <a href="http://typographica.org/2008/on-typography/taking-your-fonts-to-market-foundry-reseller-or-go-solo/">here</a>.

    are font editing houses. When you want to do business there, you\u2019d have to
    queue at their gates first and ask for admission. At Myfonts you just go and sell,
    thats it.\r\n\r\nThe second way is simply more handy. But it means, of course,
    that *everyone* can go there as well and do the same, so you have loads of rubbish
    mixing up with the good stuff. Personally, I feel that at Myfonts the share of
    rubbish is moderate and not higher than at Fontshop or other big sellers. It\u2019s
    different with smart little foundries though, who can afford to manage their own
    sales infrastructure."

    If this were not the case, there would be no such thing as Optical Illusions.
    Exclusivity and Price (I call it the Veer model) are two Typographic Illusions:
    neither guarantees an actually superior product, but are presumed to. If I had
    a penny for every dollar people spend to flatter themselves, I would be a very
    rich man.\r\n\r\nMyFonts generates traffic. If you have a decent product, a lot
    more people will see it. More eyeballs = more sales. MyFonts also has the most
    generous profit-sharing arrangement around. Because of their increased volume,
    they take a smaller cut.\r\n\r\nSo, your choice: Bragging Rights or potentially
    more money in your pocket."

  body: Not all type designers finish their own fonts. Many of them get their work
    to an almost-finished state and then let a vendor do other tasks, including expanding
    the character set, QA testing, family naming, and final font production. When
    this happens the font is usually under exclusive contract to the vendor. Exclusivity
    contacts can also get a designer a (slightly) higher royalty and a commitment
    to promote the font. Exclusivity deals are not always that great, though, as some
    vendors will just offer some extra promotion on their web site and regular email
    blasts.

    much more often than I would go to Myfonts.com. My reason for this was that I
    was under the impression that FontShop was better curated than Myfonts and, with
    my typographical awareness less developed, I had more faith that the selection
    presented to me was of a higher quality. \r\n\r\nTo me, at that time, Myfonts
    was a place that was far too confusing (sorting good from bad) and too time consuming;
    sort of like trying to find a few beautiful antiques at your average estate sale
    (although the odds at Myfonts are much better)."

    say, from my graphic/web/ui point of view, comparing MyFonts and FontShop's websites,
