  body: "I once did this for a book (TG was the corporate font of the organisation):\r\n\r\n-
    Headlines set in TG Bold No2, same optical size as reading text (need to adjust
    the sizes!). \r\n- marginals, pagina, ... set in Trade Gothic Regular\r\n- reading
    text set in Kepler Pro, I think it was SemiCondensed (to fit width) and Caption
    optical weight (to get it \"darker\"). But Kepler is very flexible, so you can
    fine tune quite well to your needs.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt turned out quite beautiful in
    print, I would do this again."

  body: "<em>contemporary serif</em>\r\n\r\nThat would be 1948. So Caledonia, Dante,
    Electra and Fairfield would be suitable pairings.\r\nOf these, probably the \"Scotch\"
    Caledonia is best, as both it and Trade Gothic are revivals of 19th century genres.\r\nSpeaking
    of <a href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/scotch.html\">Scotch</a>...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Linotype Sabon and Monotype Garamond both go well with Trade Gothic; try them.
    Both are wider and slightly lower-slung than other Garamonds, like Adobe, which
    is why they would work better for you. Clean, not funky, almost transparent in
    effect--that's what you want, because that's Trade Gothic's personality.

  body: "Skopex Serif.\r\n\r\nThe Skopex Gothic already has a similar feeling of Trade
    Gothic, but with a more modern edge.\r\n\r\nYou could also replace Trade Gothic
    and go with the entire Skopex system.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=skopex\r\n\r\nMikey
