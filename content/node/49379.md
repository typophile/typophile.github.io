    seem to be other inconsistencies in the weight and spacing of letters, as well
    as in the letterforms themselves.\r\n\r\nDo you know if this is actually from
    an old poster, or just something made to look old?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Hi Mike,\r\nthank you really much for your answer. \r\n\r\nI saw this image
    in a postcard in spain, it should be an old commercial for a spirits factory,
    but i don't know other informations about it.\r\ndo you know similar fonts?\r\ni
    tought Block Berthold BQ http://www.identifont.com/show?GH. But there are many
    differences. This one looks like an East europe font, instead Mediterranean one.\r\n\r\ntommi"
