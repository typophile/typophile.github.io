body: A <strong>spine</strong> is the integral part of the common <strong>s</strong>
  structure in Latin types and fonts. Spines range in form from a simple diagonal
  line to <strong>s</strong>-shaped (including part of the upper and lower bowls),
  with and without stressing. The spine of some letter types such as constructivist
  and geometric consists of two right-angled joints joined by a horizontal [[Crossbar|crossbar]].
  The term is borrowed from anatomical nomenclature.
