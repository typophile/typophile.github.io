  5, that has more than four fonts.\r\nI have:\r\n\r\nLight\r\nLight It\r\nRegualr\r\nItalic\r\nMedium\r\nMedium
  It\r\nBold\r\nBold It \r\n\r\nand I wanted them all in one suitcase. I worked out
  how to do it for Opentype font, but I'm really stuck with the Type 1. I read the
  FL mannual, but it doesn't seem to explain it at all. Does anyone know of a good
  tutorial.\r\n\r\nc.\r\n"

    X to move fonts in and out of suitcase files. (Suitcase has a feature for doing
    this I think, but I don't use Suitcase.)\r\n\r\nThe simplest way I know is to
    boot into OS 9 (if you can) and combine the suitcase files in the Finder by simply
    dragging one onto the other. If your Mac can't boot into OS 9, move the files
    to an older Mac that can. (It's handy to have one around for things like this.)"

    thought you'd done a nice job. Congratulations.\r\nOn p.83 of 'Learn Fontlab Fast',
    Leslie Cabarga says <em>...the potentially <strong>four</strong> allowable weights
    that may occupy any one FontLab suitcase.</em> (emphasis mine). So maybe there's
    your answer... although I guess that other people here may know a lot more on
    this topic (like Adam Twardoch).\r\n\r\nAs Mark says it's good to keep old OS9
    Macs on hand for stuff like this."

    it here. I just put up the lastest hopefully finished version <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/28299\"
    target=\"blank\">here</a>.\r\n\r\nI have the Leslie Cabaraga book and a mac with
    os 9 so I'll have a look at both those.\r\n\r\nc.  "
