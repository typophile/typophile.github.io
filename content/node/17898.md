  \r\nThis is my first big job in formating a lengthy document and I wanted \r\nto
  get everything right, as far as paragraph standards go. \r\nIs there any rule to
  the way you set the first line left indentation or \r\nanything else for that matter,
  which is a must to consider when doing \r\na reasonably a document like this? (28
  pages including cover). \r\n\r\nI am really fussy when it comes to typography, but
  I find that I don't \r\nknow enough about paragraphs etc. Any help would be so greatly
  \r\nappreciated also links to manuals etc would also be appreciated. \r\n\r\nKind
  regards, \r\nJosh"

  body: "Without referencing any source at this moment, typographers often depending
    on the project (novel, non-fiction, reference material, scientific journal, etc.)
    will establish there own \"style guide\".\r\n\r\nPersonally, on extended text
    I start the first line of the very first paragraph of a chapter opening flush
    left, followed by indents for subsequent paragraphs.\r\n\r\nHere is where some
    typographers differ: Whenerver a new section starts within the chapter that uses
    a bold or large point size sub-head, I follow the same style and make the very
    first line flush left, followed by indents for subsequent paragraphs.\r\n\r\nI've
    noted others using only a flush left line for the opening paragraph and indents
    throughout even after sub-heads.\r\n\r\nThe choice is yours. A good bet is to
    quickly pick up any quality printed books within your reach to see what others
    have done."

    book is divided into two main sections, PART I and PART II.\r\n<em>PARTs I & II</em>
    are divided into key topics headed by regular sequential numbering and larger
    point size bold heads and a 1 pt. solid rule underneath (<strong>4. Legibility
    and readability</strong>).\r\n\r\nThe first paragraph below the topic head is
    NOT indented, and subsequent paragraphs ARE indented (approx. 1 em+). \r\n\r\nBUT
    even under a main topic, if there is a sub-section or change in subject EVEN without
    a subhead, he does NOT indent but instead does a double line space. Wow... talk
    about style."

  body: The Bringhurstian indent is one em or one lead. So, if your text is 9/12 point,
    that would be either a 9 or 12 point indent. And don't indent the first paragraph
    of a chapter or section; that's classy!

  body: "I second (or third) what's above - don't indent the first paragraph (or the
    first after a head) but do indent all subsequent paragraphs. Also, don't indent
    a paragraph following a line or section break even if there is no head.\r\n\r\nAs
    to how much to indent, I think it depends on your line length. Sometimes a paragraph
    indent of 2 or 3 picas can look nice, but not on a short line width."

  body: 'Beyond echoing the above comments on Bringhurst and Tracey, I would add that
    one of my bibles in this department must be a 1954 book by Geoffrey Dowding, reprinted
    1966, entitled "Finer points in the spacing and arrangement of type". Apart from
    being one of the most beautifully printed English language volumes in my type-library,
    I think this book is worth its weight in gold. Another interesting volume is Ari
    Rafaeli''s "Book typography" (British Library and Oak Knoll Press, 2005). There
    is also Derek Birdsall''s "Notes on book design" which also has some very interesting
    things to say about grids. '

  body: I've literally just finished a 300 book where the subheads are in a heavy
    sans, and the para's begin next line WITH ident, and the same style continues
    for following ones. I dont think it looks at all bad assuming you dont have a
    really short line on the final subhead line. Also, I got my chops busted once
    for doing what seems to be the general consensus here, as it's 'inconsistent'
    -- not that I agree with that.

    and the conflict between conventional essay writing/business communications style
    rules conflict with higher-end publishing techniques.\r\n\r\nYou can't appreciate
    what you don't know, so many new editors or corporate communication \"boses\"
    constantly fall back on sytle rules that got them though college.\r\n\r\nFine
    printing and quality typography is best appreciated by the best of publishers.
    \r\n\r\nI am now working on a 250+ page book with 100+ historic photos and have
    set up a page spread with left and right page grids mirroring each other. Photo
    captions all are placed at outer margins as annotated text. \r\n\r\nAt first,
    the author liked it, but now, three chapters into the book he'd like to see all
    pages symmetrical, placed centered on the page with equal inner and outer margins...
    very vanilla! He's the writer AND publisher who is paying for the project. I'm
    putting together comparitive layout samples to convince him otherwise... we'll
    see what happens."

  body: I always thought that the first paragraph should have no indent, rather that
    is how I think it works and looks best. I see however that NewsPapers including
    the NewYorkTimes include an indent in the first paragraph. Do anyone know if this
    is a NewsPaper specific thing?

  body: "It is probably a knowledge thing, or a speed thing. The reason we indent
    is to give the eye an indicator where the next paragraph starts when reading.
    The first paragraph doesn't need one because the change of type styles from the
    head or subhead to the text provides that clue.\r\n\r\nNewspapers do not do this
    because they are built in a rush, and it simpler to have just one style for all
    body copy, quickly applied, or more likely, a default. English teachers don't
    allow the unindented first line through the lack of knowledge reason ... and generally
    won't bend even when you show them the correct method in various textbooks."
