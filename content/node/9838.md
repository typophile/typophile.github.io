body: 'I just recently completed a job which went a little wrong somewhere between
  the printing and the binding and I&#39;d be interested to hear some opinions on
  where the blame lies. <BR> <BR>Basically it was a hardbound book, 128pp approx A4
  trim size. The binding boards &#40;2.5mm&#41; were covered with a printed paper
  laminate and endpapered as normal. <BR> <BR>When the finished books were removed
  from their shrinkwrap, the covers immediately opened slightly; the foredge of the
  cover is lifting up in a curve away from the spine. I didn&#39;t notice this initially
  and neither did the client; it was ultimately raised by the client&#39;s distributor,
  who reckoned the books had either been bound too tightly or one of the elements
  &#40;board, covering, endpapers&#41; had been used in the wrong grain direction.
  <BR> <BR>I read up on the problem and decided that grain direction was the issue.
  Apparently, the grain of all elements -- text block, boards, covering, endpapers
  -- should run parallel to the spine to minimise warping. I did a few quick tests
  and it seems like at least the endpapers were going the wrong way &#40;too hard
  to check the laminated coverings, although I suspect these too&#41;. <BR> <BR>Now:
  am I a bad designer for not knowing about this issue, and for not double checking
  with the printer at every stage that they were using the correct stock &#40;most
  papers can be ordered with the grain going in the long direction or in the short
  direction -- &#39;grain long&#39; or &#39;grain short&#39; -- to deal with different
  impositions&#41;? Or are the printers at fault? <BR> <BR>My feeling is that this
  is a technical issue and really should be the printer&#39;s responsibility, but
  as any of you guys will know, you cannot leave anything completely up to a printer.
  This is why we do press passes. <BR> <BR>So anyway, comments? <BR> <BR>Robert'

  body: It is the printer&#39;s responsibility. <BR> <BR>When they quoted on the job,
    they should have figured the imposition with the grain in the correct alignment.
    &#40;Assuming that the printer is making the film/plates.&#41; <BR> <BR>To avoid
    problems, the printer can show whoever is paying them an unprinted, bound up dummy,
    in the chosen stock, to be signed off on.

  body: Years ago I was involved in a similar situation in which the <BR>dummy was
    made to spec with the proper grain direction, was <BR>signed off on, and the final
    books arrived as you describe. <BR>In our case the entire guts were facing the
    wrong direction. <BR> <BR>Through extended debate and hassle we were able to <BR>have
    the books reprinted properly for free. <BR> <BR>Do you have the dummy - assuming
    it was prepared correctly?

  body: Eric, I don&#39;t have the dummy, no, but there was one made, and as in your
    experience didn&#39;t exhibit the problem that occurs in the finished books. <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;m beyond the point now where I can do anything to have the book reprinted
    or recouped in any way, I&#39;m just interested to hear opinions and comments
    on this. It&#39;s not something I&#39;d encountered before. <BR> <BR>I constantly
    find myself wondering -- where in the hell did the skills in the print trade go?
    Why as designers are we constantly having to educate printers in their own trade?
    It&#39;s taken me a good four years working with a print company &#40;who are
    well respected in the trade&#41; to get to the point where I have confidence in
    them to produce my books &#40;generally fine art catalogues and the like&#41;
    to the standard that I need -- trying to weasel dot gain figures out of them,
    find out what colour standard they&#39;re running their presses to, figuring out
    which press guys are the good ones, etc. etc. Now I&#39;m going to have to sit
    them down and explain to them that from now on my jobs will be paying attention
    to a thing called &#39;grain direction&#39;, and I can imagine the looks I&#39;m
    going to get. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m untrained &#40;I studied fine art and kind of fell
    into design work through my interest in typography&#41; and often wonder whether
    colleges are teaching this kind of thing -- arcane technicalities like the importance
    of grain direction -- to students of graphic design. Are they?  <BR> <BR>R

  body: I&#39;ve had printers build dummy books of the selected stock. Some stocks
    will bind in the wrong grain direction, some have problems. <BR> <BR>Keeping the
    grain in mind is ideal, but for many horizontal format books you won&#39;t find
    a sheet that works, particularly if you try a French fold cover. <BR> <BR>There
    are different quality boards as well. Humidity at the bindery and many other issues
    can play a part. <BR> <BR>Try the folkes at <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.stinehourpress.com/"
    target="_blank">http://www.stinehourpress.com/</a> <BR> <BR>They send out to ACME
    in Canada and are REALLY tuned in to the process. <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t be too hard
    on yourself. Next time you will be able to discuss this upfront with your printer.

  body: My feeling is that this is a technical issue.... <BR> <BR>A grain is more
    than just &#34;a technical issue&#34;; this is an important factor for printing
    &#40;and binding&#41;. <BR>BTW, an old trick to find the direction of the grain
    - tear off a corner and lick it; it will curl in the direction of the grain. <BR>
    <BR>I don&#39;t know who&#39;s your printer, but something here/there is not right.......

    about 4 years now, but I can tell you that this stuff wasn&#39;t taught to us.
    We learned about printers and printing, but it was more rudimentary &#40;we went
    on a &#39;press check&#39; and were taught about file prep&#41;. But a lot of
    this knowledge has to come from doing, from what I&#39;ve experienced thus far.
    I&#39;d guess that many schools just can&#39;t afford it &#40;or don&#39;t want
    to pay for it&#41;. <BR> <BR>Is there a good &#39;watch for these issues&#39;

    Binding, grain direction, how to check film, etc. are all covered.
