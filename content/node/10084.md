  body: Well, you can hardly call <i>that</i> &#34;type&#34;, can you? I&#39;m betting
    a euro that this won&#39;t ever get identified. This <i>must</i> be custom drawn.

    it or not - you might have noticed the the A shape is the same. <BR>You might
    also have noticed that by the way the H, K and I shapes are constructed, that
    we are here indeed talking about a type. Like it or not.

  body: Just because there are identical letters and there&#39;s a design throughline,
    if you want to call it that, it doesn&#39;t necessarily mean it&#39;s a font.
    <BR> <BR>At any rate, I went through a pretty good collection of the free fonts
    available around the Web and didn&#39;t find it. I can&#39;t imagine it&#39;s
    a commercial face, though I could be wrong.

  body: 'Harrumph. In this forum there are 56 threads. Of the very few where the specimens
    were not positively identified, most of them were, for all intents and purposes,
    unidentifiable. By my count, there were only three or four that should have been
    able to be identified, but we just weren&#39;t able to. <BR> <BR>A little math:
    9/10 of 56 is six if you&#39;re being generous, five if you&#39;re being stingy.
    If we nailed all but three or four, that&#39;s better than 9/10. <BR> <BR>Now,
    if you&#39;re being picky about the one-hour part, we fall a little below. But
    given all the three-minute ids, if you take an average, the one-hour mark is probably
    right. <BR> <BR>Finally, note that it says &#34;you&#39;ll have your answer within
    the hour.&#34; It doesn&#39;t say whether you&#39;ll be happy with the answer.

  body: Well Cheshire, that&#39;s not only an easy but also a bit childish way out.
    If these gurus don&#39;t recognize a type, OK. Just say so. If they don&#39;t
    like it fine with me. That, however, was not the question.  <BR>But if you count
    all the &#34;I don&#39;t know but I&#39;ll make a funny remark to hide that there
    is someting I don&#39;t know remarks&#34;, not just in this thread, but in many
    other threads too - thoughout this form, as an answer ... well the helpful/cooperative
    answers are limited. To say the least. I am aware that most of the funny remarks
    came from Belgium. In itself that&#39;s no surprise. Looked at the site? Who does
    what? Nobody does anything. But again, Belgium. By the way, remember one click
    navigation? Communicare nessese est! But let&#39;s not try to make it too easy.
    A true masterpiece of design prevailing over usability. I am afraid this little
    agency will not get my costom. <BR> <BR>But, as said, I love kids, <BR> <BR>Have

  body: Dear Koeiekat, <BR> <BR>We sincerely regret that we can&#39;t identify the
    typeface used for the &#34;Shakira&#34; logotype. Several of our voluntary, unpaid
    type identifiers have done some research, amongst them Cheshiredave who &#34;went
    through a pretty good collection of the free fonts available around the Web and
    didn&#39;t find it.&#34; <BR>We have come to the conclusion that the &#34;Shakira&#34;
    logotype probably is custom drawn. It is likely that no existing typeface, available
    commercially or as share- or freeware, has characters that match the corresponding
    characters in this logotype. <BR>If in  the future this would appear to be incorrect
    and a existing typeface should be found that matches the &#34;Shakira&#34; logotype,
    you won&#39;t be entitled for a refund. <BR> <BR>I can assure you that we DO love
    children and would like to help you out, but unfortunately we can&#39;t in this
    specific case. Furthermore, I would like to stress that our friendly banter was
    solely aimed at the character&#40;s&#41; of the logotype, certainly not yours
    nor Shakira&#39;s. <BR> <BR>Last but not least, I would like to apologize for
    our misplaced jokes and sorry &#40;lack of&#41; sense of humour. I can guarantee
    you that in the future we will restrict ourselves to helping our fellow men, women
    AND children in an efficient and orderly fashion. <BR> <BR>Yours truly, <BR> <BR>Yves
