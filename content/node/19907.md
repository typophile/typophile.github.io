    as seen in this <a href=\"http://www.scandinavian.net/aci420/sasmr98e.pdf\" target=\"new\">PDF</a>
    which also has a good showing of the modern logo, which seems to be based on this
    style.\r\n\r\nIt could go back a way, pre-digital, possibly custom."

    and modified in 1998 by Stockholm Design Lab.\r\n\r\nThe colour is blue (Pantone
    2738). Additional colours are silver (Pantone 877), dark grey (Pantone Warm Gray
    9), grey (Pantone Warm Gray 5), light grey (Pantone Warm Gray 1) and red (Pantone
    172).\r\n\r\nSAS uses its proprietary typeface Scandinavian, designed by Stockholm
    Design Lab.\"\r\n\r\nfrom:\r\nhttp://users.ncrvnet.nl/mstol/sas.htm\r\n\r\nGREAT

    Prada logos. Not corporate enough I guess.
