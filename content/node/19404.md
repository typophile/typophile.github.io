body: "I just finished up this interview with Micke Thornsby a.k.a. PMKFA.\r\nHis
  work reminds me of Jean Larcher's weirdo 70s display stuff and some Letraset typefaces,
  but all run through the 80s redux/electroshock blender with just a pinch of graffiti.
  \r\nThe article is a bit clunky, as the editorial staff at Ping seem to have trouble,
  well, editing.... but still, they do really well for folks whose second language
  is English.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.pingmag.jp/2006/04/10/styrofoam-mp3-ghettoblaster-and-other-stylish-tokyo-graphics/"
