body: I recently graduated college in May and I am interested in getting into Type
  design.  This is something I have thought about for quite sometime and very much
  so interested in designing my own fonts.  The only thing is, I don&#39;t know where
  to begin.  I don&#39;t have a portfolio of fonts yet, but was just curious as far
  as what kinds of projects do type designers do other then designing fonts?  I have
  created afew fonts, but with getting a new computer and no longer having access
  to the computers that I worked with at school I will have to start all over when
  it comes to making fonts.  Anyways, just wondering what kinds of work could I possibly
  do to get a start on my portfolio &#40;specificly for type purposes&#41;.  Please
  let me know.  Thank you.

    things... mostly because it&#39;s very very hard to make a living at type design
    alone, so it&#39;s in large part a labor of love for many of us. <BR> <BR>If you&#39;re
    shooting for type design as a career, I would suggest you try to wedge yourself
    into the custom type commissioning side of things. But of course you need a good
    reputation to get people with money to trust you... So -in the same way that people
    who shoot for retail success sometimes give away their font designs for free to
    get exposure- you might consider doing some free custom work for local clients,
    or people who already know/trust you through other channels. approach them and
    say &#34;I&#39;ll make you a custom font, no charge. If you like it, give me more
    work in the future, and tell people about me.&#34; If you end up doing that, make
    the font minimally functional: if they end up using it to satisfaction, they&#39;ll
    probably end up paying you to expand/refine it. <BR> <BR>Good luck. <BR> <BR>hhp

    in uses like the above &#34;just making fonts&#34;. That aside, strictly speaking
    type designers design type. Some do other things like lettering, typographic design,
    or graphic design. But when they do they are letterers, typographic designers,
    and graphic designers. <BR> <BR>Some even do their own web development and marketing,
    but again... <BR> <BR>James'
