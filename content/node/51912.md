body: "Hello Friends,\r\n\r\nIt has been a while since our last update even though
  we continue to release new Filmotype faces at Font Bros . . .\r\n\r\nWe're pleased
  to announce the re-release of three great new Filmotype faces in OpenType format:\r\n\r\nFilmotype
  Ginger - Initially designed in the early-to-mid 1950s, Filmotype Ginger helped usher
  in the Mod typographic stylings of the early 1960s visual aesthetic yet it retains
  a classic and timeless feel.\r\n\r\nFilmotype LaSalle - Among the very first handwritten
  script fonts offered by Filmotype in the beginning of the 1950s, Filmotype LaSalle
  was designed by Ray Baker, a former Lettering Inc employee at the time who named
  the face after LaSalle street in downtown Chicago.\r\n\r\nFilmotype Vanity - Filmotype
  Vanity marks the beginning of Filmotype's effect style Outline fonts, all of which
  incidentally start with the letter V, was developed from the original Filmotype
  Ginger typeface. \r\n\r\nSince technology didn't exist in the late-1950s to create
  drop-shadowed or outline styled fonts within the Filmotype machine, each letter
  was originally meticulously hand rendered and redrawn in this special effect style.\r\n\r\nAs
  will all our re-releases, they are fully remastered from the original filmstrips
  and have been expanded to include a full international character compliment, automatic
  fractionals, ordinals, and a suite of alternates in dynamic OpenType format.\r\n\r\nYou
  can see our full library at: http://www.fontbros.com/filmotype.php\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nStuart"
