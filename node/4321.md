body: This sample was sent to me by someone who says this was produced for them years
  ago, and they want to expand the product line, but don&#39;t know the typeface used.
  I thought it looked very familiar, but I can&#39;t place it. I&#39;ve searched T-26,
  Alias, Device, Psy/Ops and books where I thought it might be shown, without any
  luck. <BR> <BR>Anyone have any ideas? <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/33652.gif"

    <BR> <BR>In this sample it looks the &#34;a&#34; is the &#34;e&#34; and the &#34;e&#34;
    is the &#34;a&#34;...  <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-amoeba/regular/testdrive.html?s=salsatribe&amp;p=72"
    target=_top>Amoeba</a> has kind of the same style ... and a cool <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-amoeba/regular/index.html?s=ABCDEFGHIJKLMN%D1OPQRSTUVWXYZ"
    target=_top>uppercase</a>. <BR> <BR>Hope this helps Mike. <BR>

  body: Thanks Ignacio. I knew Amoeba had some similar qualities, but the font she
    sent is made up of ellipses, and I seem to remember reading a font description
    that mentioned this design feature. If she wants to expand the branding, I doubt
    that a more random-looking font will be what she wants. The a/e filp occurs in
    many designs I&#39;ve seen &#40;that would be a good list to make&#41;, but here
    I think the ellipses in most letter forms is the key to this ID.
