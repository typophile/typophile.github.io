  body: "Early, late or mid 19th century?\r\nItalian script styles over 100 years
    would have been diverse but there would not have been a great number of metal
    typefaces.\r\nPerhaps calligraphy and engraving might be good sources. Although
    much of this could be derivative of the English styles of the 18th century.\r\nHere
    is a digital font based on a Bodoni script in a specimen book of his fonts issued
    in 1818 at Parma, Italy by his widow. http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/parachute/pf-bodoni-script-pro/\r\nBased
    on very late 19th century Italian handwriting styles,  Diva by Nebiolo, as digitized

  body: "I have no information as to whether Sackers Italian Script http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/sackers-italian-script/
    is based on 19th century Italian scripts.\r\nLuc Devroye has this to say about
    Sackers Italian Script and the other fonts in the Sackers family of fonts:\r\n---start
    quote---\r\nThe Sackers family (Monotype, and before that Agfa) contains a gorgeous
    tall-legged open style, Sackers Open Antique Roman. There are also Sackers Roman,
    Sackers Gothic (sans), Sackers Square Gothic, Sackers English Script, Sackers
    Classic Roman and Sackers Italian Script subfamilies. As a whole, this is an elegant
    but curious collection. There are few clues as to its origins, which may be a
    bit louche because we can easily recognize Engravers Gothic in the Sackers Gothic,
    for example. All typefaces look like they originate in the 19th century, and started
    probably out as engraved (copperplate) lettering. Monotype has these families:
    Sackers English Script, Sackers Gothic Light, Sackers Gothic Medium, Sackers Heavy
    Gothic, Sackers Heavy Roman, Sackers Italian Script, Sackers Light Classic Roman,
    Sackers Light Roman, Sackers Open Antique Roman, Sackers Solid Antique Roman,
    Sackers Square Gothic. Any information is welcome.\r\n---end quote---\r\nhttp://luc.devroye.org/calligraphy.html\r\nDon "
