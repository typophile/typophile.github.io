body: "Dear friends and colleagues,\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, February 16th, my first e-book
  was published on the websites of Tablet Magazine and Nextbook Press. It's a small
  volume--a chapbook, really--of thirty-five poems by the greatest Jewish poet of
  Middle Ages, Yehuda Halevi. The poems appear both in Hebrew and in splendid new
  translations by Hillel Halkin, Halevi's biographer. Though many of you know Nextbook
  as an imprint of Random House/Schocken Books, it is, in fact, a privately funded
  non-profit publisher that's been the source of many of the brightest and best books
  on Jewish subjects in recent years.  \r\n\r\nThis e-book is an auspicious event
  for me, as it marks the debut of the new Hebrew types I made with Matthew Carter,
  after originals by Guillaume Le B\xE9. These are the types (there's a display size
  [the \"gros double canon\"], which was rendered by Matthew, and a text size [the
  \"texte\"], which was rendered by me) that first appeared in Christophe Plantin's
  great Polyglot Bible, published between 1569 and 1572. The colophon tells a bit
  more about them. (Yes, e-books can have colophons, too!) These new fonts were the
  impetus for this publication, and in their honor, Nextbook also made a video, at
  my office, of me talking about the types and explaining something about how they
  were made. I warn you in advance that there some small errors, as the 5-minute video
  was spliced together from over an hour of talk, so the second clause of a sentence
  might have been said twenty minutes after the first. They also had a delightful
  visit with an original copy of Plantin's Bible at the Harvard Divinity School. (Unfortunately,
  we couldn't get access that day to the Houghton Library's copies, which are from
  the best part of the run, on the better paper.)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.tabletmag.com/arts-and-culture/58585/letters-lost-and-found/
  The e-book link is below the movie, or:\r\nhttp://nextbookpress.com/books/1589/\r\n\r\nAn
  advance warning: the movie that's online now doesn't play on iPads or iPhones. They
  plan to change the format. The e-book is in PDF, so it will play on just about anything.\r\n\r\nTypes
  aside, the e-book has an interesting feature: the pages vary in depth to accommodate
  each of the poems, even the longest ones, on one page. I don't know if this is an
  altogether new idea--it seemed like an obvious path to me--but I've never seen it
  done before. I'm curious to know your reactions to it. For one thing, it places
  the book outside the realm of printing, though that wasn't my agenda. What I intended
  was to alleviate the disorientation one often feels in e-books, which, regardless
  of whether the pages are numbered or not, give no sense as to the page before or
  after--something that, in a paper book, we can grasp very easily. While this might
  not be a big issue in prose, it certainly is in poetry, especially in poems like
  Halevi's, which vary dramatically in length. It seems to me that, to get into the
  rhythm of a poem, one needs to know its extent. We're hoping the whole package,
  book and videos, will become an iPad app later this year.\r\n\r\nOne more thing:
  those of you in or around New York might be interested in a talk I'll be giving
  for the Type Directors Club, on March 10th, at 6:00 p.m. Cribbing a bit from Oliver
  Sacks (with whom I had the honor to work last year), I entitled it \"Tales from
  the Borderlands of Typographic Experience.\" I plan to speak about my work in complex
  books with on-the-page commentaries and annotations, multiple languages (combining
  left-to-right with right-to-left), making special types to suit specific purposes,
  how all these things relate to the future of print and of electronic forms, and
  their relationship to the printed Talmud and glossed texts of the past. I'll show
  numerous drafts, breakouts, and final examples from Mahzor Lev Shalem, the forthcoming
  Reform mahzor (in progress), the new Halevi e-book, and more.\r\n\r\nYou can find
  information about the event here: http://tdc.org/ The event is being cosponsored
  by Nextbook/Tablet Magazine.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith all good wishes and Shabbat shalom,\r\n\r\nScott"

  body: "Raphael Freeman says:\r\nFeb 17, 2011 at 9:06 AM\r\nInteresting decision
    to shorten the lamed. The lamed was drawn high in many typefaces because it is
    created by a yod/vav on top which represents God. Therefore since God is always
    above us the lamed is tall and never bent.\r\n\r\nOf course it makes it a nightmare
    to typeset with a tall lamed since it collides with the nikud on the line before.\r\n\r\n\r\nIsrael
    says:\r\nFeb 20, 2011 at 8:54 AM\r\nRaphael,\r\n\r\nYou made a good point about
    the top of the lamed being a special kind of yud, and representing G-d in kabbalah.\r\n\r\nActually,
    this is not diminished by shortening the height of the lammed, for the right upper
    part of the aleph too represents a yud, and G-d in kabballah.\r\n\r\nThe height
    of the lamed, like a lamdan or talmid chacham, stands tall and proud. For this
    reason, the height of the lamed is tall.\r\n\r\nHistorically, an alternative form
    of the lamed was invented, so typesetting with a tall lamed was possible. This
    was achieved by the \u201Ccurled lamed\u201D, where the ascending segment was
    wrapped to parallel the upper horizontal stroke.\r\n\r\nThis was first done successfully
    with the Romm family version of the classic Vilna font in the Talmud.\r\n\r\nThis
    posed a problem for Biblical diacritic text for upper taamim that needed to occupy
    that space. To address this, the lamed ascender was not bent or curled, but rather
    truncated. This is what Scott-Martin has done."

  body: "Since the ascender on the Lamed was much higher than in many other Hebrew
    typefaces, shortening it to make the new face more practical to use does not strike
    me as an odd decision.\r\n\r\nWhat I noticed, though, was that other details of
    the letter were changed in the outline shown in the video. But then, in general,
    it is normal for revivals to not necessarily be exact copies."

  body: "In creating the revivals for the set of Romm family Vilnas and Rashis, I
    tried to create exact copies of thee typefaces. This was extremely hard to do,
    because the original artwork was but a handful or two points high, and smudged
    and blurred.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, it is near impossible for an artist, a creative
    type designer, to stifle his or her creativity, and to be extremely subservient
    to the design that he or she is trying to revive.\r\n\r\nThe purpose in my case
    was to recreate the ancient Romm Talmud in the very same look-and-feel, so I could
    claim that ones great-grandfather studied the new revival edition. See www.GoTalmud.com
    for details.\r\n\r\nScott-Martin was aiming to do this with La Be. He wanted to
    create a rendition of La Be, very close to the original, so Hebrew poetry, prayer,
    and Scripture, would feel sacred like the La Be design expresses.\r\n\r\nI think
    that he did a superb job."

  body: "Thank you, everyone!\r\n\r\nBill, I did indeed keep the tall lamed, as well
    as the two variants of the elongated forms--everything that survives in the punches
    and mats. You'll notice that the largest change I made from the original was the
    design of the nikkud and taamim, which I believe wouldn't fly with modern readers
    of Hebrew texts. The task now is to convince a Bible publisher to allow the use
    of the elongated forms. Since the introduction of mechanical typesetting, readers
    of Hebrew have suffered with huge word spaces in justified texts, especially those
    set in short lines. Nowadays there are many readers who are unaware of elongated
    forms, except in calligraphy.\r\n\r\nIsrael, did the original cutting of Frank-Ruehl
    have elongated letters? I don't recall seeing them in the Berthold specimen. Perhaps
    that was the origin of the problem.\r\n\r\nThe very tall lamed didn't do much
    good for Plantin, as you can find many that became bent (they were cast as kerned
    letters, of course) under the pressure of the form lockup and the press. A long
    lamed in any font used with diacriticals runs the risk of bumping up against nikkud
    and taamim in the line above--a serious problem, in my view. I don't think my
    shortened lamed here is really all that short, anyway. Had I not mentioned it,
    I wonder if anyone would have remarked on it.\r\n\r\n"

    \r\n>>  Perhaps that was the origin of the problem.\r\n\r\nNo, Frank-Ruehl is
    a relative recent design. Mr. Frank designed it with a short ascender (ie. the
    lamed) and short descenders (ie. the kuf and the 4 final forms) clearing for practical
    purposes.\r\n\r\nPrior to the lamed and the descenders were very long. This was
    done both in type and by scribes. The reason is unclear.\r\n\r\nAccording to kabbalistic
    teaching these extremes did have significance.\r\n\r\nWhen the very popular Vilna
    type was introduced and heavily used at the beginning of the 19th century, it
    became necessary to address the impracticality of the height of the lamed. So,
    a \"curly\" lamed was introduced in the middle of the century. Later, a truncated
    version, like you created, was used. At first, the top was simply broke off. After
    all, it was a long trip from Lithuania to Italy for one letter.\r\n\r\nI believe
    Bodoni's students cut the Romm Vilna letters, as Frederick Goudy attests. I know
    that you contend that it's a load of bunk, from mouth of a drunken sailor.\r\n\r\nDid
    Goudy know the salute, \"l'chayim\"?\r\n"

    by very tall, the learned Jewish person, not in science or math, is high above
    the rest. Hence, the lamed is very tall.\r\n\r\nWhen Frank-Reuhl was introduced
    at the beginning of the 20th century, the height of the lamed was shortened in
    most Hebrew typefaces from then on, for practical issues.\r\n\r\nI think the lamed
    should have three heights: very tall, curled, and shortened or truncated. I regret
    that we didn't do that long ago and far away."

  body: i agree with gohebrew - fonts with high lamed create big problems in typesetting.
    nowadays it's simple though, to use the shortened lamed as a default, AND add
    a hightened lamed glyph using the openype features. i love the fact that you chose
    to preserve the shape of the lamed, instead of bending (or "curling" like GOhebrew
    mentioned) the ascender backwards. bent lameds seems quite un-natural..
