  much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe businesscard was created by pattern cutting tools l
  purchased at a secondhand shop, using them as a cheap alternative to die cutting.
  \ The front has a braile type texture created by piercing from behind[jpeg3]\r\n\r\nMy
  envelope is based on WW2 Dazzle patterns, with the inside incorporating a font l
  created.  The font was developed from patterns found inside envelopes and pay slips,
  designed to hide/distort content.\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "Well, if this is meant to be a set, I don't see much relationship between
    the envelope and the business card. So I will look at them separately, then.\r\n\r\nThat
    said, I LOVE the technique on the card! A tad bit time consuming to do by hand,
    though. Would be very cool to do a laser die-cit, but I understand cost restraints.
    (I'm guessing this is a personal self-promotion item?) The kerning on the smaller
    white type seems awfully tight, but that might just be because I can't see it
    up close.\r\n\r\nThe envelope also is quite dynamic in a very different way than
    the card. While the card is subtle, the envelope is energetic. Nice added touch
    to have a message on the inside... BUT usually when you open a piece of mail,
    don't you run a blade through the edge? The recipient might never see your message,
    as they wouldn't necessarily open the flap that way.\r\n"

  body: "It is meant to be a set, hopefully my letterhead and compliment slip will
    bring everything together, if not l may have to re-work the card or envelope.
    \ I have a very tight budget, so die cutting is out of the question.  \r\n\r\nI
    was initially stuck on the concept for my card, and after experimenting with my
    new found tools l created the card.  What l liked about it was the subtlety, with
    my name being somewhat concealed/hidden.  I have attempted to carry the idea of
    'hidden' through to the envelope design, using a variant on a camoflage pattern[Royal
    Navy colour pantones].  But this has the opposite effect in the context of an
    envelope, making it standout.\r\n\r\nThe disruptive typeface may not be seen.
    \ Most people l have asked tear open their envelopes, but l run the risk of my
    greeting meassage being missed.\r\n\r\nthanks."

  body: I would check out the postal regulations on this and any envelope before conceptualizing
    a design. <a href="http://www.wausaupapers.com/Resources/ten.aspx">Wausau Paper
    has a good overview worth consulting</a>. Nothing's worse than making a great
    envelope only to have the USPS reject it -- believe me, it's happened.

  body: "I think the concept of 'hidden' (while it applies to the design of both objects)
    needs to be more obviously connected between the two. \r\n\r\nI would be intrigued
    by a similar use of the hole-punching on the envelope. Perhaps just a small monogram
    of your initials in the return address area (matching the style of the card) that
    shows a hint of dark paper inside a light envelope (or vice versa... dark envelope
    -- like the card -- showing a light letterhead through). \r\n\r\nJust a thought.
    I'm all for matchy-matchy sets when it comes to stationery systems. Maybe that's
    a bit boring to you, but I find it strengthens the impact of the concept if everything
    is closely unified."

  body: "Michael, I had thought of that advice also, but noticed that Alex ('dole
    scum') is in the UK and the envelope was addressed for Italy. I have no knowledge
    of British or European mail standards, so I didn't comment on that aspect. \r\n\r\nIt's
    always good advice to check with the local postal service when designing mail,
    especially for business use. \r\n\r\n(Though, in reality, my experience with the
    USPS has been <strong>fabulous</strong> when it comes to delivering unique 'mail
    art' that doesn't conform to standards, even internationally. This is <em>not</em>
    the same for bulk business mail though, where the rules are much stricter.)"

    body: "Thanks for the link to the site.  The envelope guidelines seem very restrictive,
      but l have seen mail art in the LA based Arkitip magazine, so l assume they
      are leanient to some extent.  The envelope will be mainly used in the UK, so
      l cannot see any problems as any stamp marks are situated at the top of the
      envelope.\r\n\r\nI also like coherent stationary, l will have to look at my
      work afresh tomorrow evening and see what l think.  Thanks for the advice,\r\nl
      am now off down the pub for a pint of guiness, yumyum.\r\n\r\n "
