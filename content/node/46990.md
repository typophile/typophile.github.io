  <strong>FF Pitu</strong> typeface by <strong>\u0141ukasz Dziedzic</strong> has been
  just released by <strong>FontShop International</strong> and is available in OpenType
  in three styles:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_pitu_pro/\"
  target=\"_blank\"><strong>FF Pitu Pro Light</strong></a>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pitu03_5626.png]\r\n\r\n<a

  href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_pitu_pro/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>FF
  Pitu Pro Bold</strong></a>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pitu05_3951.png]\r\n\r\nIn
  his primary occupation as an editorial and magazine designer, \u0141ukasz Dziedzic
  has been constantly in search for new typefaces. Most of his own fonts originate
  in situations where he felt that none of the faces currently available on the market
  worked \u201Cquite right\u201D in the context of a project he was currently working
  on. Therefore, most of his typefaces have at some point been tested in real magazine
  layouts, and refined based on those findings. This was also the case with Pitu:
  an early version of the design was used by the Polish weekly \u201CEuropa\u201D
  until the magazine assumed a different stylistic direction.\r\n\r\nPitu started
  off in 2002 as a set of swashy capitals accompanied by lowercase that sits somewhere
  between a Didone italic and a Copperplate script. Its most characteristic features
  are probably the pronounced  stroke modulation and blade-shaped sharp stroke endings,
  which are slightly softened by generous calligraphic loops with \u201Cfoxtail\u201D
  terminals. While keeping a slanted angle of the face, Lukasz expanded the initial
  face into a three-weight family, changed the proportions of the lowercase, reworked
  the swash capitals and added a complete set of \u201Csimple\u201D Didone capitals
  and small caps. \r\n\r\nIn 2004, Pitu was selected for the \u201CBookmark\u201D
  exhibition that showcased Central European typeface designs. The  exhibition took
  place in The Hague and was hosted by the Slovak Centre  of Design.  \r\n\r\nThe
  primary alphabets of Pitu consists of an ordinary uppercase and lowercase\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pitu06_3788.png]\r\nsmall
  caps\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pitu07_5260.png]\r\nswash capitals,
  lowercase alternates\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pitu08_6034.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
  fonts also include several kinds or figures, various ligatures, superscripts, subscripts
  and many more characters.  The FF Pitu Pro fonts cover all Latin-based European
  languages, including some niceties. For example, in addition to the regular \u201E\u0142\u201D,
  \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pitu09_6332.png]\r\nPitu contains a calligraphic
  \u201E\u0142\u201D variant, typical for Polish handwriting:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pitu10_3917.png]\r\nAnd
  even, by popular demand (i.e. I asked him), an \u201E\u0142\u0142\u201D ligature:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pitu11_4121.png]\r\n\r\n<strong>Full

  Pitu Pro Bold</a> <em>(the images are large).</em>\r\n\r\nFF Pitu is available through
  the <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>FontShop</strong></a>
  network. In addition to the three FF Pitu Pro OpenType fonts, the design is available
  in a variety of other encodings and formats. \r\n\r\n<strong>\u0141ukasz Dziedzic</strong>
  was born 1967 in Warsaw. Rather than to finish high school, he worked as a sound
  technician and occasionally actor at a children's theatre group, spent a year working
  as a carpenter helper rebuilding 13th-century churches, he lent his voice and bass
  guitar skills to the band \xBBDunski Jazz\xAB, and worked as a software developer
  at the Polish patent office.\r\n\r\nDuring the first free Polish elections of 1989,
  he briefly worked as a newsboy for Gazeta Wyborcza, the newly-launched, first independent
  daily newspaper in the country. A year later, he joined the design department of
  Gazeta Wyborcza and spent seven years there, co-creating the layouts of the main
  newspaper and its weekly companion magazine, for which he drew his first typeface.
  He later worked for several other publishing houses in Warsaw (since 2003 at Axel
  Springer Polska), designing newspapers and magazines. In the same time, \u0141ukasz
  drew over a dozen typeface families ranging from large Latin and Cyrillic text families
  to single display styles. Many of these fonts were originally created for a particular
  newspaper or magazine layout. Some of them went into regular use or were used occasionally
  (in Poland: Gazeta Wyborcza, Vita, Przyjaci\xF3\u0142ka, Fakt, Lub Czasopismo, Go\u015B\u0107
  Niedzielny, Tele\u015Awiat, Komputer \u015Awiat, in Russia: OK!, in Germany: OK!
  and PAGE), others were never utilized.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, \u0141ukasz created a three-style
  Latin and Cyrillic corporate family for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/adamt/2563664544/\"><strong>empik</strong></a>,
  one of Poland's largest press and music retail store networks. In the same time,
  FontShop International released two of \u0141ukasz Dziedzic's families (<strong>FF
  Clan</strong> and <strong>FF Good</strong>). His <a href=\"http://www.typo-berlin.de/2008/index.php?node_id=Dziedzic;942&lang_id=2\"
  target=\"_blank\"><strong>Typo Berlin 2008 appearance</strong></a> did not bring
  him a standing ovation, as he did not show any examples of his own work, so he will
  do better next time. In 2008, FontFont released <strong>FF Clan Italic</strong>
  and <strong>FF Pitu</strong>. His other unreleased designs can be seen at his website
  <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.alfabety.pl\"><strong>alfabety.pl</strong></a>.
  \r\n\r\nThe designer's name is spelled \u0141ukasz, not Lukasz, but Typophile's
  support for non-Western characters in the Flash-driven headlines is broken. \r\n\r\nFor
  those who like tongue twisters and want to try pronouncing \u0141ukasz Dziedzic's
  name: it would go like <strong><em>woo-cash jeh-jeets</em></strong>. Also, <strong>Pitu</strong>
  should be pronounced <strong><em>pee-too</em></strong> (rhymes with <em>me-too</em>),
  not <em>pie-two</em> or <em>pie-t-you</em>. \r\n\r\n\u0141ukasz has absolutely no
  clue what Pitu is useful for, so I suggest you give it a shot and let him know.
  \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam"

  body: This is gorgeous. Provocative even. The stems which mimick a sharp nib pen
    ... well it certainly doesn't shy away from anything. This is what people should
    think of when they want something that looks opulent, lavish and exclusive. This
    is a font for a private club with high bench seat and private alcoves with velvet
    curtains.
