  sure how this usually goes, to me it makes sense to start with an introduction.
  My name is Jim and I am graphic designer getting started in the field. I have a
  BA and about a year of experience in print production. I am very interested in type
  but I am not a type designer. I would like to try it and hope to soon.\r\n\r\nMy
  intent with this blog is to use it as an exercise for myself to think about type
  in new way. Let's see what happens."
