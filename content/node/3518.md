    <BR> <BR>But I can&#39;t find Avant Garde in there. :-&#40; FontHaus does, however,
    have Elsner &amp; Flake&#39;s strange monospaced version. <BR> <BR>The Avant Garde
    alts were also part of Linotype&#39;s GX Font Collection, released back in the
    early 90s. It had such other oddities as &#34;schoolbook letters&#34; for Times,
    Helvetica, and New Century Schoolbook, all the swashes for Bookman, swash caps
    for Palatino &#40;not the originals, but rather Ariadne, which has often been
    paired with Palatino&#39;s and others&#39; lowercase italics&#41; and the swash
    alternates for Zapf Chancery Medium Italic. <BR> <BR>You might be able to call
    Linotype and see if they have any extras left that they would be willing to sell
    you. You can only get to the GX features through GX apps like UniQorn and LightningDraw,
    or one-by-one through the InDesign glyph palette. GX features do not work automatically
    in InDesign like OpenType features. <BR> <BR>Good luck in your quest, <BR>--John

    <BR>But what if you preferred that something be forgotten? What if you decided

    <BR> <BR>This is not a hypothetical question. The early Tiro Typeworks Type 1
    retail fonts have all been withdrawn from circulation, a process that took some
    effort to cancel contracts etc. We did this because some of the types were going
    to be revised and rereleased in OpenType format, while others we were unhappy
    with and wanted to retire. The fact that trading those old fonts on newsgroups
    doesn&#39;t financially harm me is irrelevant: the fonts are my intellectual property
    and I have the right to say when, how and if they are distributed.'

    I must admit that I adamently disagree with you. Especially in this case, when
    it is &#60;I&#62;clear&#60;/I&#62; that Advant Garde&#39;s Alternates are still
    commercially available. <BR> <BR>Many designers search fonts.com and myfonts.com,
    and if they don&#39;t find their searched-for font &#40;after a whole 10 minutes
    of research!&#41; they assume that the font is dead, and that this legitimizes
    piracy. A little more research would prove that this font &#40;AVG G Alt&#41;
    is still commercially available, albeit through Scangraphic of FontShop Austrailia.

    through Font Shop I had some &#34;problems&#34; to get it living in Europe. <BR>
    <BR>To summarize, I could not get it through FontShop Europe neither Australia.
    In touch with FontShop USA/Canada, they had it but told me they could not sell
    fonts outside of North &amp; South America. However, they kindly directed me to
    Type Sales &#40;Swipe&#41; where I finally got it. <BR> <BR>By the way, a very

    <BR>it is clearly indicated that the Avant Garde Alternates version is by Elsner&#43;Flake,
    but this essential information is missing from the detail pages, which is a pity.  <BR>
    <BR>Tiffany,  <BR>Since Avant Garde Alternates is from Elsner&#43;Flake, naturally,
