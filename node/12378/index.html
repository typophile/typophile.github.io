Spotlight has already come in handy several times too. Just make sure you let it finish its initial indexing before you do any serious work.

Quartz Composer (which comes with the developers' tools) is very cool. You can design and play back complex animations and effects that render right on the graphics processor.

I haven't heard of any bungled Tiger upgrades, Vince. If you're having trouble, talk to Apple. They didn't get ranked #1 in computer customer service by hanging customers out to dry.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Vince, have you rebooted your Mac since the initial installation of the update?

Sometimes a second reboot will force all of the automatic system-level maintenance scripts to run and do a bunch of stuff that needs to happen on a regular basis.

It really sounds like you need to run a system utility like <a href="http://macosxcocktail.com/">Cocktail</a> or <a href="http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/11582">OnyX</a> to clean your application and system cache files and repair permissions. Something has caused some file access problems with a few of your applications. You shouldn't need to reinstall anything. If you are unable to download and install a new program like Cocktail, then boot your Mac off the original OS X CD that came with it and run the Disk Utility from the CD. It will allow you to repair permissions at least.</div>

http://discussions.info.apple.com/webx?14@290.PhjBavYaWdQ.0@tiger

You might have better luck there than on Typophile.

Nuking the hard drive seems like a rather drastic step (although I have the impression that it is a routine solution in the Windows world).</div>
