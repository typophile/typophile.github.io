  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello all, I am new to the Typophile site and was really impressed with the professional look, not to mention the love of typography you all seem to share, as I do.

A little about me, 

I've been around. Started my career at a early age running a offset press, moved onto photography, where I stayed for 16 years running my own studio. Became jaded with the whole still image thing and moved to my next desire, Graphic design. I love it, love my Mac and all the wonderful stuff you can do using Adobe software. I am presently an art director at a nice little branding shop doing all the things I love. 

All that aside, I remember back in the day when being a commercial artist, designer, photographer etc. meant something. Not that you were treated like a god, you were a talented person with unique capabilities, as the respect followed. You were payed well for what you did and were responsible for your time as long as the deadline was met and everyone was happy and got along.

Now, here's what I found after playing the freelance game for the last 6 years. Granted I was a lowly freelancer but I found that the industry on a whole has turned the respectful advertising game into a bean counters delight! I found that creative was dictated by account suites with the help of a art director and time-sheets and meta data  were the mission of the day. Once was a witty chat about creative direction has turned into a ego swinging tantrum brought on by fear and inexperience, where on more that one occasion when I got involved, I was escorted to the main lobby.

Luckily I have found a nice little niche where I can do what I do best, work everyday, be creative, play golf every now and then and be paid fairly for what I do. As far as the agencies go, well no thanks, it's just to disappointing.

Please pass on your thoughts, hopefully I have opened a can of worms and just maybe, something will change.

Good luck to all.

moi

P.S. Sorry for the typesetting but it seems to be out of my control
