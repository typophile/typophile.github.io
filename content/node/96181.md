  body: "It appears to be Caledonia, designed by W.A. Dwiggins in 1939 for Mergenthaler
    Linotype. The page you scanned for this sample may have been printed from metal
    type (or by an offset reproduction of a page printed from metal type), which would
    account for the \"smudged\" appearance.\r\n\r\nCaledonia was one of the most popular
    typefaces for trade book composition in the 1950s and 60s. (<em>The Catcher in
    the Rye</em> was published in 1951.) Georgia was designed by Matthew Carter in
    1993."

  body: "I agree that this is Caledonia, and certainly not Georgia, because Georgia
    has a 'g' with a straight, horizontal 'ear'. See the attached sample of  a Berthold
    version of Caledonia from the Serif Font ID Guide.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega[img:sites/default/files/old-images/caledonia_be_full_3418.gif]"
