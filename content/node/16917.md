body: I'm trying to find the script font and hunting through the fonts I have on hand
  (over 3000) is taking too long. I know the "catering" part is Avant Garde, but the
  "Lavan's" part is such a commonplace script look that I can't think of any one font.

    I think - except that the ligature between the e and the v may have been done
    by hand - or is it open type?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.philsfonts.com/showing.html?sku=BQ900290X1P1&start=1"

    body: I'm not sure-- this is a tiny gif that the client wants us to recreate and
      spiff up a little, but wants us to keep that font. I'm waiting on a reply from
      them about what it is.

  body: "The font is Exquisit but you might have to make that ligature by hand (unless
    as I said above) there's an open type version that has it.\r\n\r\nHere is the
