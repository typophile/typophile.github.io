    would be even further off. So maybe: http://www.myfonts.com/search/hypatia/fonts/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    in which the author\u2019s name in Modesto Lite Expanded is used as the header.
    I\u2019m looking for a highly legible font for the body text that will compliment
    (or go well with) the header.\r\n"

    Extended Regular</a>\r\n\r\nDepending on the text size, and the means of printing,
    you might also consider the Light weight.\r\n\r\n"

    body: "Thanks for the suggestion, Nick. Beaufort\xAE Extended Regular or Medium
      would be a great alternative to Modesto Lite Expanded. Then I could use Beaufort\xAE
      Regular as the text.\r\n\r\nI would like a little more contrast, however.\r\n\r\nI\u2019d
      like a good sans serif text font to pair with Modesto Lite Expanded. I\u2019ve
      tried Avenir and Neue Haas Grotesk, and I\u2019ll try Hypatia, as suggested
      above. Further  suggestions would be appreciated."
