body: "Hi all.\r\n\r\nIs there a reason why Typophiles search function isn't working
  for me. What ever I search for I just get 'Your search yielded no results.' - I'm
  using OS X, and I've tried on a number of browsers with the same results. Is anyone
  else having the same problem ?"

    and a cornucopia of 2 for \"type\".\r\n\r\nI got nothing for \"logo\" though :o(\r\n\r\n(I'm

    can be obtained using Google. Type \"site:typophile.com [search]\" in Google to
    search Typophile only.\r\n\r\neg. site:typophile.com fonts"

    why there have been so many \"been there, done that\" threads.\r\n\r\n--Michael.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n//

  body: As mentioned above, Google is the best bet - unfortunately it's limited by
    how often the forum is crawled so you may not find the latest posts.

    have to believe that word has been used many, many more times than that.\r\n\r\n*Edit*\r\nA
