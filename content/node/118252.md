  readability and possible webfont combinations for this logo (attached below).\r\n\r\nMy
  client is a yacht charter company, aiming for a contemporary yet timeless and elegant
  brand ID. The name is rather long and unusual, but they insist it has to be one
  word, not \"xxxx Yachts\". There's a story behind that.\r\n\r\nI've selected Brandon
  Grotesque with enough kerning, aiming for a clean effect without feeling \"clinical\".
  In a small enough size, the logo gets the effect of Savoy hotels ([[http://bit.ly/1AglwCH]]),
  clean and refined. But, since we'd like to avoid lower case and different font weights,
  first readers may wrongly put emphasis on the \"AYA\", instead of on the \"E\".
  Is that how you perceive it?\r\n\r\nRegarding the website fonts, I was somehow hoping
  to use Univers, which I love particularly on this website: [[http://bit.ly/1pklIZd]].
  However, if proceeding with Brandon Grotesque, I'd possibly use the same font for
  the main menu and headings, and keep the body text neutral with Univers or Arial."

    for a subtle way to make it more readable. Maybe make the M and Y a bit larger,
    or bolder, or a slight space between words, or one word in serif and one in sans,
    or whatever.\r\n\r\nLong logos like that are occasionally awkward when they must
    fit in a narrow space (a small web ad, for instance) because the the type becomes
    very small. Make a postage-stamp size print and see what happens.\r\n\r\nAnd asking
    us if it's readable isn't a real test since you tell us it contains \"yachts\".
    Show it to a bunch of people (individually) without any explanation at all and
    ask them to read it."

    think of the B&O or D&G logos, for instance, very simple and still memorable.
    You're right, that's the challenge.\r\n\r\nYes, JamesM, the length may indeed
    be a problem, on social media as well. Something to keep in mind. I'll have to
    turn this around, in order to break the monotony and make it readable. How do
    people get to a simple logo like Dior, that works so brilliantly? Back to the

    The B&O logo is not generic. The D&G logo is not memorable. Most significantly,
    I don't believe visually expressing what a company is makes a logo trendy; it
    just makes it good design. And you can even do this just with letterforms.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    is used a lot in marketing, and sometimes in logos if the company is willing to
    update their logo periodically.\r\n\r\nTimeless is a look (generally very simple,
    for example the \"Dior\" logo) that's not trendy but will have style and be usable
    for many years."

  body: "Interesting discussion... I agree the urge to be timeless can be considered
    trendy. Most of us would enjoy conceiving something that will last for generations.
    To me, though, timeless design (if unique) is a great quality. Something generic
    could maybe be timeless, but timeless isn't per se generic (in the sense of bland).
    \r\nTimeless boils down to essence, stripping the design of whatever is pure ornament.
    Like Farnsworth House or a 250GTO.\r\n\r\nThere's some subjectivity here. If you'd
    wear a tailored suit by Caraceni, some would say you look like a boring business
    guy. Others, who look past the ubiquitous grey or navy blue colour, and notice
    the quality of the cut and fabric, would bet you fly private. \r\n\r\nI agree,
    JamesM, that a great logo shouldn't necessarily express the product it represents.
    It should give it a stronger identity though. And, it's a fact, hrant, that some
    logos surf the success of the product. I find this very interesting. It's like
    wearing jeans, T-shirt and a 3-day stubble, like you don't care, but the world
    is hanging on your every word. Consider the logo of OMA ([[http://www.oma.eu/]]).
    These guys are a global architecture firm, building high-rise from NYC to Hong
    Kong. Their logo is \"just\" plain arial. I like that sense of understatement.
    Or Herzog & de Meuron, they don't even bother about a logo!\r\n\r\nSo, then, what
    are remarkable and timeless logos in your opinion? \r\n"

    I would classify as a Modernist disaster.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    \r\n\r\nTrue, but most graphic design is ephemeral (has a short life). \r\n\r\nOne
    of my college design professors used to show a waste basket and say that's where
    most of your work will end up because graphic designers create things to serve
    a particular purpose in a particular time.  \r\n\r\nBrochures are read and discarded.
    Logos are changed. Very different from a fine art painter who would be horrified
    if one of his paintings is thrown away.\r\n\r\nOf course there are graphic design
    items that are admired for many years, but a logo from the 1970s may be admired
    today but probably isn't still usable in its original form. Any logo you create
    today will be changed eventually. If you want your work to last generations, be
    an artist not a graphic designer."

  body: "This is one of the directions I am exploring:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Mera_3514.jpg]\r\n\r\nI'm
    using the crossbarless \"A's\" for both simplifying the logo and as subtle upward
    arrows. The client likes the double meaning in Mera, referring to the name of
    the owner but also close to the German word \"mehr\", meaning more. It's part
    of their brand to focus on unique yachts, making a difference, rather than simply
    aiming for the largest or most profitable projects. Yachts with more added-value
    (in terms of authenticity, identity) as a vision.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that this
    still looks random to me. Both \"A's\" are close, yet part of different words.
    The \"Y\" seems lost, and so far doesn't align with the second \"A\".\r\n\r\nHowever,
    I think there is an opportunity in the sequence A-Y-A to get a consistent overall
    impression, while not compromising readability.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? Throw
    the crossbarless story away, and move in another direction?  \r\n"

    comment on this. I take it you mean the lettering overlapping the prow of a sailboat.\r\nA
    yacht can come in many sizes and shapes from the huge J.P. Morgan classic to a
    30 foot sloop. The sloop contains a design idea in the shape of the mainsail,
    which is essentially a right angled triangle, with a vertical, a horizontal and
    a diagonal. The vertical and diagonal make an crossbarless _A_ in a shape that
    is evocative of a sloop's sail. Just one possible way of thinking out of the box.\r\nDon"

  body: "Jean Louis, in your other thread I wrote \"I think if the crossbar is going
    to be removed it should be done for a valid reason, and not because the designer
    didn't have any better ideas.\" Looking at the version above, my impression is
    that you didn't have any better ideas. Ironic that you've tried to evoke the notion
    of \"mehr\" by <em>removing</em> elements. However, only the A has been modified;
    the rest are unchanged. Therefore, the modified A feels arbitrary. If you intend
    to simplify, you should probably simplify all the letters as much as possible.
    That might mean using a different typeface.\r\n\r\nThe larger problem, I think,
    is that you're trying to substitute simplicity for a solid concept. You seem to
    be designing backward, holding up letterforms and asking \"What does this make
    you think of?\" Figure out what concept you want to communicate, be it \"mehr\"
    or \"prow\" or \"mainsail\" or whatever, and then design a logo that illustrates
    it."

  body: "@all: Thank you for your comments and suggestions! \r\n\r\nReconsidering:
    If the concept was to communicate \"sailing yachts\" or \"mainsail\", then yes,
    the crossbarless \"A\" or delta could have been a solution. However, I must say
    Captain Howdy has a point: As of now, the \"A's\"still look random.\r\n\r\nWhile
    yachts are Mera's business, their identity isn't just about yachts (sail or motor).
    They believe \"luxury\" (if the word still has a meaning today), be it a car,
    a house or a yacht, should be authentic, unique and memorable. It should reflect
    individuality, instead of the \"old-world\" pompous status symbols. As James Goldstein
    once said: \"People ask me all the time, \"how big is your house\"? As though
    that's the criterion for making it special.\" This is quite common in yachting
    as well, were people seem obsessed with the top10 largest yachts. The client,
    however, believes in substance above size. For them it's \"Mera\", instead of
    just \"mega\". They are very candid about this. \r\n\r\nSo, the logo concept is:
    Authentic, contemporary, clean, (bold yet) subtle, innovative, effortless. I like
    the idea of using a font that can be used on the website and communication material
    as well, for more overall consistency. For that reason, I started exploring possibilities
    with Brandon-Gotham-Proxima. These are clean, open, welcoming, and still professional.
    Ideally I wouldn't customize the font too much, and let it \"speak for itself\".
    But let's be honest, unless you are a brand like, say, Bang & Olufsen (uses Frutiger),
    where the name alone already triggers emotion, it's a quest to get to \"that\"
    font that says it all..\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n"
