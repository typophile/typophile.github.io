body: I am new to the world of typography. I am just trying to create something personal.
  I want to create a hand mirror out of a script lower case "b" but I am having some
  trouble getting the word to be legible. The word is "behold" and originally I was
  going to do a mirror for each loop in the "b", "h", and "l". But I am now at the
  point where I am would be happy with just the "b"! Has anyone ever seen anything
  like this? Or could give me some pointers. I don't know if I am looking for inspiration
  or encouragement....or if this is even the right place for my question since I have
  only been working on this for a few days! Sorry if I am not in the right place,
  but thanks to anyone who could help me!

  body: Currently I do not recall a script face which 'b', 'h' and 'd' can easily
    be redrawn to resemble hand mirrors. Cool idea, though.
