body: "Please help me to identify the font used in this logo.\r\n\r\nIt was designed
  in the mid 1980's and used to create a rubber stamp, and a poster header.  Unfortunatly
  the print shop that designed it has long-since closed.\r\n\r\nWould be nice to know
  what it is, so the font can be used for other related things.\r\n\r\nThank you.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ChurchCrest_5631.JPG]"

    in or around the church which was done more professionally, and that might be
    a better starting point for finding a digital font that could match it.\r\n\r\nSearching
    through the [[http://new.myfonts.com/search/uncial/fonts/|uncials]] on MyFonts
    might bring up something, although the dots inside the top and bottom curves is
    an unusual feature."
