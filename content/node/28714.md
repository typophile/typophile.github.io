body: "(OK, perhaps a little off-topic on these forums, but still of interest to many,
  I hope...)\r\n\r\nOf course, as far as fountain pens go, I'm loyal to my old <a
  href=\"http://www.hochwertige-schreibgeraete.de/en/product.php?nav=3&catid=150&proid=157&catprodid=157\"
  target=\"_blank\"><strong>Pelikan M300 F</strong></a>. It's a true workhorse, but,
  like most fountain pens, it isn't disposable, and its ink can be messy and slow
  to dry.\r\n\r\nAs far as disposables go, I'm rather fond of the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Uni-Ball-Signo-Black-Gel-12/dp/B0002LCVV8/\"
  target=\"_blank\"><strong>Uniball Signo Micro 207</strong></a>. Smooth as silk and
  resists smudging.\r\n\r\nThat said, we all love letters, and we've discussed handwriting
  before, so...\r\n\r\nWhat disposable pen do you prefer? (And I mean for its quality,
  not for its convenience or low cost.)\r\n\r\nI've yet to find a disposable with
  a flat nib like a fountain pen (for those great thick-thin stroke variations we
  all crave). Any recommendations?\r\n\r\n"

  body: I've been using the Pilot Precise V5 (Extra Fine) for years. I used to be
    more partial to Pilot Razer Points. I still like them, but they are getting harder
    to find. I was into Microns for a while but don't use them much anymore.

    i find it handy to use the different colours to refine and adjust the outlines
    of my sketches. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/magnus_penn_4597.jpg]

  body: The problem I have with the Pilot Precise is that it is so sensitive it tends
    to make marks where I don't want them. I don't have the same problem with the
    Uniball Micro.

    Not that they're type designers or anything, but I guess that's another vote for

  body: I have to make a statement in favour < [there shouldn't be a red spelling
    mistake line under that word, either...!] of a real disposable pen; I love the
    Bic Fine ballpoint biro, you know, the plastic orange things; good to chew on
    and available in that lovely green ink. I do not believe the previous suggestions
    as disposable, but I'll certainly try some of them out. And treasure them forever...!

  body: "My favorite is the Pilot P-500. It's replaced the V5 for me because it writes
    as well (sometimes better) for me, and its ink doesn't bleed, unlike the V5. The
    only downside is that the tip is not as sturdy, so dropping the pen is not recommended.\r\n\r\nI
    haven't found the P-500 in stores recently (the P-700 is much more common, but
    I prefer the .5mm tip over the .7mm), but you can order them from office supply
    store websites."
