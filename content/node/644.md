  body: Client wanted Euro style bumper stickers for his Audi TT and give away promotional
    goodie.  We first tried authentic <BR>Din style typeface but decided branding
    would suffer, and went with FZX custom logo type . <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/13012.jpg"

    &#40;read a discussion held sometime before in this forum&#41; <BR>the bumper
    sticks look better, the font is just a bit shallow and rectangular

  body: Here are the logos. Top is primary logo and the rest are project specific...promotionals,
    banners, collateral.  <BR>Adding the TM was clients request as an afterthought.
    We had it without but he was given legal advise to include it. We are actually
    re-printing several business cards because if this.  <BR> <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/13050.jpg"

  body: Alex, I agree the logo is a bit shallow in the bumper sticker, the sacrifice
    was consistency vs. aesthetics. <BR>Client choose consistency. Here is the authentic
    Din  <BR>style Sticker that was rejected. Could perhaps use a tiny bit of kerning
    but idea was killed before that stage.   <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/13053.jpg"

  body: Business cards... <BR>We did a test printi run to see response. Orange design
    appealed to younger audience, top right with clouds worked best with older folks
    and business people. Design is being re-designed  to look like top Banner. Client
    also acquired FIZX.com domain so Fizxwireless.com will be utilized for traffic.   <BR>New
    Re-Design will be printed on 144 Lb Yupo synthetic paper to be run with brochure
    &#40;almost completed-will upload comps soon&#41;. <BR>Thanks for the critiques.  <BR><img

  body: Using the Fizx logotype in the bumper sticker is fine, but I think the logotype
    itself could use some reworking. The proportions of the letters seem awkward,
    and there&#39;s some conflict between the use of rounded and squared corners.
    Just MHO. <BR> <BR>Paul

  body: 'bj, i have no real knowledge on the subject, i am saying however that  <BR>a&#41;
    the tm thingy puts me off, you see it on every damn sign, signature, lame logo,
    everywhere for no reason <BR>b&#41; somebody suggested that it had no use, even
    as far as the law is concerned. that was a few days back, in another thread &#40;discussion
    about TM and R symbols&#41; <BR>c&#41; logically thinking, having the tm sign
    acts more as a warning. not displaying it doesnt mean you havent paid for the
    copyright. i dont see how it can stop potential dillutions from people who really
    mean to achieve their goals. <BR> <BR>i have heard about the ASI policy you are
    mentioning <BR> <BR>after examining a few big brands&#39; logos, i must say many
    of them carry the R sign, but it&#39;s size compared to the logo&#39;s size is
    minimum, so it doesnt get in the way or visually distract you, which is the case
    for fizx '
