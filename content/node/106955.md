body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nWe have a long document (100+ pages) that we need to replace the
  existing font Futura ND (PostScript) with Futura Std (OpenType).\r\n\r\nWhen we
  do so, all of the type shifts vertically a small amount.\r\n\r\nIs there any way
  to correct for this beyond manually moving text box so that the baseline of the
  text is in the original position?\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nJoshua\r\n"

    Character Features of Character Styles, and thereby apply it en masse."

  body: "Probably not. FuturaND was published by Neufville Digital and your Futura
    Std is likely produced by Adobe. Although I think Futura is licensed from Neufville
    by Adobe, internal settings of the fonts from the two different foundries are
    different in several respects which may be causing the problem you see. \r\n\r\nIf
    you are using InDesign or Quark XPress you may be able to fix the problem for
    the entire document by changing the app settings for the first baseline."

    can just move the baseline grid (Preferences > Grids & Guides).

  body: "If you've already applied paragraph styles to your text, I'd use Nick's method
    of adjusting the baseline shift in the style settings. But if you previously set
    up the document without style sheets, be sure to proof it carefully afterwards
    in case there are unintended consequences to applying new, global styles. There
    shouldn't be if you do it right, but check to be sure.\r\n\r\nYour original suggestion
    of moving the text boxes a bit could also work; you wouldn't need to do it on
    each page, just the text boxes on the master pages (assuming you haven't broken
    the links to them). Again, proof carefully afterwards since even small changes
    can cause text to reflow.\r\n\r\nAnd be sure to work with a copy of the file,
    so you can easily revert if needed.\r\n"
