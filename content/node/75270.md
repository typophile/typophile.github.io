  piece I\u2019m working on. I\u2019m not to familiar with brush scripts. Do you spot

  body: "The 'i' seems pretty low / small compared to the rest \u2014 so much so that
    I thought it was a swash from the character to its right. Also, the sharp ends
    on the 't' aren't present in any of the other characters."

    just the smallness of the i and the height of the t, but it looks like the word
    is angled towards me. '
