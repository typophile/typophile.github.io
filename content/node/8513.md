  body: The cover looks really nice. The idea of 2 doorways works well. <BR>The typeface
    is looking better also. The waw still needs a bit of work. If you imagine that
    the tail is a swimmer, it dives under the baseline but doesn&#39;t come all the
    way up. Also, the descender of waw and reh &#40;both isolated and attached&#41;
    are usually related so you need them to talk better with each other. The waw might
    extend more because it has more space to cover because of the head. Also, when
    waw and reh connect to previous letters, the lower part is not affected that much.
    The repetition of these 2 frequent letters has a very strong effect on the rhythm
    of the Arabic. The waw is a key character, top is related to closed forms of feh
    and qaf, and lower related to the reh.

  body: 'Thank you very much, Nadine, your comments are very important to me. <BR>I
    was thinking in the aproximations between nasrid and merini cultures, the same
    image in the doors can looks well. <BR>One of my collaborators is from Marrakech,and
    I had a lot of troubles <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> with him: he is very conventional in his point of view,
    for example, he thinks that a maghrebi typeface looks better... <BR>I try to aproximate
    the design to my colaborator callygraphy form and preferences, and he is very
    happy with the reh, ghain &#40;not in this version&#41;, sin, and kaf, of course...
    <BR>I will try to work with the waw whit yours recomendations, I&#39;ll show here
    my advances. <BR>Warm regards, Paco.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/62632.gif"

  body: i don&#39;t know for sure, but i guess your text blocks are too wide - at
    least they appear to be too wide for latin typesetting.

  body: The book format is 22x22 cm. and the text box is 15 cm width. I have used
    14,5 pt in arabic text and 11 pt in latin text size, wiht this meassures I can
    obtain the same number of pages and similar distribution of the text... <BR>This
    is a comfortable read in both languages.
