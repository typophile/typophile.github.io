  most reverse contrast slab serifs bear the dusty smell of Wild West, <em>M\xF8nster</em>
  by Sindre Bremnes stands out with a scent of the orient. More eastern than western
  in its design, this clash of cultures is tightly spaced for creating striking headlines.
  Named after the Norwegian word for \u201Cpattern\u201D, M\xF8nster\u2019s odd letter
  forms and exaggerated shapes combine into powerful, vigorous patterns, making a
  bold statement of any title. <a href=\"https://monokrom.no/fonts/monster/design\">Read

  body: Why would you use this for text though? It seems weird to use a Western/Eastern
    hybrid in such a context. I wouldn't consider it appropriate. I would probably
    use it as a display type if my talk involved Western typography. Using it because
    it "evokes the non-Latin world" (which, to me it doesn't to the extent I think
    you're implying) seems silly. Isn't your choice in selecting this typeface a matter
    of personal indulgement rather than practical, appropriate use?

  body: "Actually I ended up using Trilby for most of the text (which wasn't that
    much anyway though) and I used M\xF8nster for the titles.\r\n\r\nBut I feel they
    both do evoke the non-Latin world (in fact David seems to ascribe his attraction
    to \"reverse-contrast\" to his Jewish background) which is appropriate because
    my talk was about how Latin libre fonts should be made more open to non-Latin
    extensions (by adopting an Apache license instead of OFL).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
