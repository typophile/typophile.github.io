		<div class="commentbody">I think u have to get the basics in art, just like in any other major, and if u can do that in school, it&rsquo;s ok, but in my case i learn much more doing things rather then going to school, although i finished an art school. But it&rsquo;s always the teachers, so if u know that the teachers are good, yes go study.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I originally got into design through an interest in playing with Photoshop and building webpages for fun. After a year or so at a couple entry level jobs I decided that if I wanted to continue this as a serious career (which I did) I should consider getting some formal schooling (which I did).</p>
<p>I found 2 things as a second-degree student, First, already having a degree (and being 6 or 7 years older than &ldquo;true&rdquo; freshmen) I had a much greater sense of what I wanted to get out of my time at school and felt like I approached my classes with much more intensity than I had with my original (English) degree. Second, 3 years into a 4 year degree program I decided that I had learned enough (and spent enough :D ) to start working.</p>
<p>I certainly don&rsquo;t think degrees are useless, but if you already have a degree, work experience, and a strong idea of what you want to do (strong enough to leave your current career to start something new) I think you have some flexibility in how to approach a design education - that is, what you think might work best for you.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Just learning computer programs/applications does not make you a designer - art school is the way to go - learning to look and truly see, drawing - design fundamentals - color - and learning to be creative -  look at the program of study and if it goes beyond just being a &ldquo;techie&rdquo; go for it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Design &lsquo;certificates&rsquo;&hellip;especially web design, are more temp-agency centric than design-agency centric.</p>
<p>That said, RISD carries a lot of cache, so maybe that&rsquo;s not all that bad.</p>
<p>The key though is getting the graphic design background. The technology part will come either on it&rsquo;s own (your own ambition) or later if you decide to focus solely on that.</p>
<p>One advantage of the web industry, in general, is that they haven&rsquo;t bee as hung up on degrees as the more traditional print/ad agency world.</p>
