  there a more impersonal sanserif that resonates with Goudy Oldstyle?"

  body: "the only other sans that i know Goudy put his hand to were a bold version
    of <a href=\"http://www.p22.com/lanston/products/globegothic.html\">Globe Gothic</a>
    and Copperplate Gothic* but that may be a bit much. You may try something from
    the same period: Franklin Gothic, maybe.\r\n\r\n*There's also a \"Lining Gothic\"
    which was never produced "

    [[Jim Rimmer]] has quite a bit of Goudy influence in it.

  body: I like Credo too, Paul. Thanks for introducing me to it. Sadly, its heavy
    weights have the same problem that <a href="http://www.vllg.com/Thirstype/ApexNew/Example+About/">Apex
    Sans</a> used to have. (see comparison at bottom)

  body: I like Today Sans and think it would work nicely with Goudy, they are both
    fairly round fonts.
