  body: "Hello griffisse. I think the term you are looking for is \u201Ctype designer\u201D,
    not typographer. The former design typefaces, the latter composes the text \u2013
    much like Leica make photographic cameras and photographers uses them. There are
    thousands of people drawing type now, but only very rarely do I get excited. If
    I were to pick just one, I\u2019d choose Carl Crossgrove\u2019s <em>Beorcana.</em>
    Fellow Typophile Florian Hardwig wrote <a href=\"http://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/beorcana/\">some
    words for Typographica</a> when it was released back in 2006.\r\n\r\n\u2014 14
    years in the making. More slow type please!"
