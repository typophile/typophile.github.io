		<div class="commentbody">So HermesSoft are the only ones producing fonts in Bulgaria? That's rough... So what kind of Cyrillic types were produced in Bulgaria or used by Bulgarians historically, before digital fonts? How would those types be judged by today's Bulgarians?

In your opinion, what constitutes good Cyrillic design on the Bulgarian model? Are there any good, thoughtful examples being produced--lettering, custom logos, calligraphy, etc.--that might point the way? Or any historical high marks--models from the past that epitomize good Bulgarian Cyrillic design--that could be a good springboard for a present renewal?

Is there one model or a diverse range of models to follow for Bulgarian Cyrillic? Sorry to barrage you with questions, but I'm eager to learn about Bulgarian typographic traditions and the current scene.</div>

I don't think you can pretend to speak for everybody.

if there's no difference.

Oh, I've been working to tame Latinization for 7 years now.
I make fonts that way, and write articles & give talks about it.

Funny hearing that from a graphic designer.
Everything matters. And to us, especially glyphs.

		<div class="commentbody">With OpenType, this is not so much an issue for the type designer, more for the type user.
That's because it's possible to put "country-specific" variants of the Cyrillic alphabet in the same font. What's specified as the default for a specific language may be an issue, however. 

I've been developing some new typefaces (to be released this Fall/Autumn) in Cyrillic and Greek, and following a seminar given by Maxim Zhukov, I became aware of the Bulgarian issue. So I've included a Bulgarian "language specific" option to the standard Cyrillic letterforms in the fonts. Serbian too.

So while the basic Cyrillic typeface (below) is a fairly authentic 19th century revival (close to a type published by Adolf Darre in Harkov in 1888) the Bulgarian alternates are "historical fiction" based on a study of fonts published by HermesSoft. Given the logic of typographic style, and its relative portability across cultural (well, Latin-Greek-Cyrillic anyway) and temporal boundaries, that seems reasonable.

Here is the upright style of the serifed face, which shows the most distinction between standard and Bulgarian Cyrillic forms:

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bulg_3601.jpg]

To clarify how this works: when the language used in the layout application is specified as Bulgarian ("BGR"), the Bulgarian alternates are substituted.</div>

Well, the type designer still has to make the "sensitive" fonts!  :-/
As you're doing - which is commendable.

Also, software currently still ignores the language tags, no?

Thanks Hrant, your advocacy is not without effect, and the Typophile forums really help sort out this kind of thing.

I don't know too much about that, but it did come up on a thread in the Build forum, and Miguel indicated that it wasn't an issue. What's your experience of this, Vassil -- does the software used in Bulgaria support language tags in OpenType fonts?

I'm anticipating that some of the market for this typeface will be trans-national corporations producing multi-lingual material for the EU, and their suppliers should have the Adobe CS software which supports this kind of OpenType font sophistication.

Or should I (also) produce dedicated Bulgarian-only TrueType fonts?</div>

That seems wise even if the language tag is supported, because otherwise you're
assuming too much expertise both on the part of software at large as well as the
typical user. And I'd put a "Bulgarian" suffix within the name of the font.

It looks like you need CS3 to have it work properly.

I don't know whether I would go to the trouble of producing Bulgarian-specific, non-OT fonts. That's a production, marketing and distribution hassle as much as a font generation difficulty. It would certainly be quite unproductive to make Small Cap and Old-style figures fonts. 

It would probably be easier to make Bulgarian-first OT fonts, TrueType flavour -- they would work on any application that supported TrueType, with the benefit of accessing typographic OT features in earlier versions of Adobe software.

		<div class="commentbody">Sort of.
The general idea is to make the lower case less "capital-ish" than standard Cyrillic.
That applies at the alphabetic level to glyphs that acquire ascenders in the Bulgarian version, but also to the treatment of details.
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bulga_5512.jpg]
So the first changes shown here are alphabetic, but the second are typographic. 
They don't effect sans fonts so much, or italic.

BTW, this principle (as I deduced it) comes from fonts such as HermesSoft "Brilliant" (their Bodoni) -- although I have applied it in a conceptual manner (eg the flag on the "be"), as well as literal copying of their forms (the "en").</div>

I think what you did makes sense in that it provides options in the form of stylistic alternates, and it's fun to reimagine other Cyrillic letters to follow the Bulgarian model. It won't be terribly authentic, though, at least for the Serbian letters. Now I'm curious--what's authentic for Macedonian--Serbian style, Bulgarian style, a mixture of both, or something else entirely?</div>

You are doing marvelous job…Most glyphs given as bulgarian alternates are in deed widely used with some remarks (as pointed by Jongseong). Additional notes may be pointed: all letterforms cyrillic  an “typical bulgarian” are used in hand writing, note the serbian small caps b which is also used as small caps d in hand writing. Note that the k and dj are still questionable, dough beautiful, because of latinisation issue…

The open type question is little too hard for me – all the standart software, which we are using, is supporting it, but software produced in bulgaria doesn’t. But it could be implemented with proper support in the coming years, because the majority of pro oriented applications (bank software , accounting software, medicine and etc…) is still developed for DOS environments (yeah) and in the coming years they probably will shift platforms.

They are not, in practical terms, redundant -- one context for the use of "loan characters" in a font being educational. If you are typesetting a Bulgarian language primer on foreign languages such as Serbian or Macedonian, you will need all of their alphabet, and the characters should be available in the same style as the main font.

And in literary works, if the text is in Bulgarian, but quoting a Serbian author in his/her original language, the foreign characters are necessary. 

And surely Brian, in those contexts, the use of Bulgarian style--typographic as well as alphabetic-- is authentic.
For Russian, Serbian, etc. typesetting, people wouldn't be getting any of the Bulgarian alternates.

The support of OpenType features is limited to professional software (CS, XPress), and somewhat in Word. 

Note Thomas' comment in the Build thread linked to above, that it's only with CS3 that InDesign supports the "bgr" language tag, to support alternate language-specific glyphs.

I would also expect Word to support the Bulgarian language tag in OpenType fonts.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nick, I completely agree with the need for the Bulgarian-style non-Bulgarian letters. I just meant they were probably not authentic in the sense that they were not likely to have been in actual use. Inauthenticity should not be an obstacle to updating typographical practices; otherwise, typefaces based on the letters on Trajan's column wouldn't have J or U, Greek typefaces in the lapidary style wouldn't have lowercase letters, and so forth.

I'm curious about your Bulgarian-style Dzhe (џ) design, though. Shouldn't it resemble the Bulgarian I (и) with a stroke?

On the whole, your Cyrillic letters look really good, and I'll be looking forward to the release. Nice to see it's based on a type produced in Kharkiv (then Kharkov), whose typographic tradition I would like to learn more about.

Any chance I can persuade you to add Old Bulgarian letters to your font?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Brian, you're right that the Bulgarianized Serbian letters are not authentic to the native language; I was wrongly interpreting "authentic" to mean true to the typographic style of the (Bulgarian part of) the font, not to the alphabetic shapes. 

<em>Bulgarian-style Dzhe (џ) design, though. Shouldn’t it resemble the Bulgarian I (и) with a stroke?</em>

I haven't a clue, not being a linguist. I copied that interpretation from a HermesSoft font that I bought. Could you explain?

<em>Nice to see it’s based on a type produced in Kharkiv (then Kharkov), whose typographic tradition I would like to learn more about.</em>

The Darre style I'm reviving is taken from a specimen book in the New York Public Library; Maxim Zhukov arranged a viewing for those attending his TDC Cyrillic seminar earlier this year.

Possibly.
I added four historic Russian letters, (Maxim's suggestion, re. 1918 reform).
Yat used quite a bit in the specimen above.
How many?

		<div class="commentbody">A million thanks for the beautiful examples, Nick! I remember being delighted to see wonderful books from the period in a number of exhibits in Ukraine, including the Taras Shevchenko Museum in Kiev. I don't speak Russian or Ukrainian, so it must have confused my Ukrainian friend why I was looking into them as if I were reading them, just admiring the forms of the letters...

Returning to topic...

By 'Old Bulgarian' letters, I meant Yat (ѣ) and Yus (ѫ), which were used in the pre-1945 orthography. You already have Yat, of course, so it turns out I was just thinking of Yus... I vaguely thought there might be more letters I was forgetting about, but I guess not. So just one more letter and you've got older Bulgarian texts covered. you can do it, Nick!

p.s. I just found out that the pre-1945 Bulgarian orthography is due to one Marin Drinov, who studied and taught at Kharkiv University. He was living in Kharkiv around the time Adolf Darre was producing his types, and he died in Kharkiv as well. Just shows how important Kharkiv was as a cultural centre in that period.</div>

I'll try to. The "Bulgarian" forms are basically script forms of the letters which have been back slanted to fit within the upright paradigm.  as such, the и й ц џ are all related and based on the 'u' shape that you used for all of these letters excepting the џ.

'Old Bulgarian' was a poor choice of words... I just meant the letters Yat (ѣ) and Yus (ѫ) that were used as recently as 1945.

I don't want Nick to go through all the trouble of resurrecting all the earliest historical Cyrillic letters and their variants described in the article you linked to, most of which were archaic by the time the Adolf Darre specimen was produced.

Regarding the 'Bulgarian' џ... Yes, I also understood the 'Bulgarian' forms as an upright script form, and so expected something based on the 'u' shape. I couldn't have explained it better myself.</div>

Brian, I note that Milka Pejkova included Yus and yus in her seminal design (see Vassil's Typowiki link above).

But just so that I know what I'm getting myself in for here, I should probably produce two variants: the standard Cyrillic form (with the more curled "K" leg), plus the Bulgarian variant with straighter leg, in upper and lower case. What about the "iotified" version -- that would be very cool as it looks like a stick-figure animal, but is it necessary for the pre 1945 Bulgarian texts you're alluding to?</div>

Not as far as I know. Though I agree it looks like an animal shape composed of matchsticks, and would be fun to design just because.

New question for Bulgarians (and other native Cyrillic users): I came across <a href="http://www.sbible.boom.ru/slavpdf.htm">this page with PDF files of the Bible in Church Slavonic</a>. Does the style of Cyrillic used there have specific connotations as being appropriate only for religious literature or recreations of mediaeval texts? Or does it have broader appeal?

I'm thinking of a possible parallel example in Korean typography. The older Hangul (Korean alphabet) Bibles--the ones where the text is set vertically, not horizontally as Korean is written now--were set in a typeface designed by Seo Sangryun and Baek Hongjun in the late 19th Century and first used for printing in 1882. Because of the drab uniformity of Hangul book typefaces in contemporary use, the unique type style of old Korean Bibles is all the more distinctive.

In 1998, the Sandoll foundry produced <a href="https://www.sandoll.co.kr/SandollWeb/shop/product_down_read.asp?idx=182&listType=2">a digital revival</a> of this typeface under the direction of Lee Kyungbae, calling it Seonggyeongche (literally, 'Bible face'). Since then, I've seen it pop up on book covers, advertisements, and signs in uses that have nothing to do with the Bible. Although it was jarring at first, I've become accustomed to the type style being used in wider applications. Although the uses I've seen were all for display purposes, I even think a cleaned-up version would be good for contemporary book typography (as the Sandoll version is deliberately rough in imitation of the antique printing press outputs).

With the type style used for Church Slavonic typography, you similarly have a slice of older typographic history preserved through the conservative medium of religious literature. Is there a similar situation in Bulgaria and elsewhere where that type style is used for display purposes outside of the church context? To what extent could the style serve as an inspiration for contemporary developments in Cyrillic typography?</div>

(pp. 128-129)

I'm guessing that this means that the style you're referring to could either have church connotations or overtones of antiquity (not necessarily religious). I have several illustrated books of <em>skazki</em> (folktales), which use this style of lettering in illustrations, and there is definitely no religious connection there.</div>

Rumania — early literary history used the OCS + Cyrillic. Around 1860 the Cyrillic was replaced by Latinica in non-religious writing, and around 1890 in the Church.

[[Todor Vardjiev]] showed a lot of high quality type designs from his colleges and students, all in cyrilliza, latin and some times greek to. This style is not new, If I remeber it right, its teached since the late 60th at National Academy of Arts at Sofia. [[CYRILLIZA]] is not a special form of [[Cyrillic]], as he mentioned it - its an own alphabet and now the third official alphabet of the the European union. Watch, he is wearing a blue t-shird wich yellow [[Cyrilliza]] letters. :-)

But no foundry is developing it! Only Hermes Soft, but he has no good experiences with this foundry. So most documents use Cyrillic letters, but for a Bulgarian patriot this is dishonoring.

One of his master students was [[Ilia Gruev]]. So far he have done some really good text typefaces: Graphit, Scribo and Memo. But to the western (internet) world, unkown. 

http://www.moire.info/en_shrift_i_1.html

He showed also typefaces from Ivan Kjossev† (Bibliophonika), Olga† and Vassil Jontschev† (Viol), Milka Peikova, Stefan Gruev† (Wawel), Vassil Stefanov and Razvigor Kolev.

BTW: Its not possible for me to add new type designers to the wiki. (Indices : Type Designers) It will no be saved. A bug or a feature?

This is very confusing. I should like to see the official EU documentation on this. <em>cyrilliza</em> is just a different way of transliterating <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9A%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B0">кириллица</a> (pronounced kiɾiliʦə), which in English we translate as <em>Cyrillic</em>.</div>

Nick, in many Slavic languages, including Russian, <em>Кириллица</em> (reads ‘Kirillitsa’) stands for '<a href=http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9A%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B0 target="_blank">Cyrillic alphabet</a>'. Likewise, <em>Глаголица</em> (‘Glagolitsa’) means 'Glagolitic', and <em>Латиница</em> (‘Latinitsa’) ― ‘Latin’ [alphabet, or script].

Among non-Bulgarian designers the subject of this discussion is sometimes referred to, for lack of a better term, as <em>Болгарица</em> (‘Bolgaritsa’). However, by no means should it be mistaken for an official definition: it's a type designers' slang. There are a few nicknames of this kind, like <em>Armyanitsa</em>, <em>Gruzinitsa</em>, <em>Evreitsa</em>, <em>Arabitsa</em>, &c.

Sure enough, this is not a <em>branch of the Cyrillic alphabet</em>. It is a special pattern, an inflection of the l.c. glyph construction. The alphabet, or more correctly, the script, is still the same, Cyrillic. The character set is <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgarian_alphabet#Bulgarian target="_blank">Bulgarian</a>, of course.</div>

I'm sorry I've kept you waiting. I went scouring all over the Internet for samples of early modern Bulgarian printed works that include italics—how I miss having access to a large university library!—and after some <a href="http://www.library.uiuc.edu/spx/class/Periodicals/Bulgaria/bulgperimages/russe.jpg">frustrating 'almost' finds</a>, Google Books bailed me out:

<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=KX8CAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA2">A grammar of the Bulgarian language with exercises and English and Bulgarian vocabularies (1859)</a> includes a table of the letters that include italic forms. Perhaps because it reflects a chaotic situation in terms of orthography at the time, it also includes a variety of iotified forms including the iotified yus. It includes some interesting information, such as that the fact that most of the books then in use were printed in Russia, where some of the letters not available were substituted, including yus with 'y' (p. 10).

The italic yus, as far as I can tell from the low-resolution scan, simply looks like a slanted yus.

That's all I could find so far, and I hope the Bulgarians here can provide more help on the italic forms of obsolete letters.</div>

Charming, aren't they?

What kind of needles has he brought from Hamburg? (p. 62)
When we were rich we also wore fine clothes. (p. 89)
From whom do you come? I come from the shoemakers. (p. 98)
Where are you going in this rain, in this bad weather, in this cold, in this dust? (p. 98)

When I saw that you were doing a 19th-century revival, I thought it would be nice to have the additional Bulgarian letters appropriate for the period. After looking at the low-resolution samples online of Bulgarian printed texts from the period, I'm only more convinced that those letters would be excellent additions to your project.

The typographic component of the Bulgarian revival seems to have owed a lot to the Cyrillic types produced in the Russian Empire, and the Adolf Darre typeface you chose is as good a representative as any. I confess I'm not really a fan of moderns for Latin type, but for Cyrillic this period style seems to work perfectly, with the vertical stress and prominent bulbs. I'm sure a quality digital revival will serve as a welcome source of inspiration for today's cyrillic type designers.</div>

In this little section, there are a couple of iotified forms, so those, and possibly others, would have to be added too.
The accents could be done by the typographer.

But who would use such a font?
For comparison, it would be like setting Shakespeare in English with long s's -- sure, it would be nice, and very authentic, but consider how little demand there would be for that -- despite the huge readership of Shakespeare -- and compare that with the number of readers of old Bulgarian! 

One would be better employed, as Adobe has recently done, extending Cyrillic support to cover further tens of millions of present-day readers/writers -- and is still criticized (on the Phinney blog) for its discretionary cut off-line that leaves out several languages.</div>

I really don't think you should include both "b" variants (the ones in top right corner). The first form (with very little space between the bowl and the foxtail) is just poorly proportioned, and the second form is simply good, and works for Russian much better than the first one.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for your concern Adam, but my face is a revival, and that "b" is the way it was made in this genre of typeface in the late 19th century. 

Here are examples from four different books (one of which is a type specimen) of that era.
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bees_6262.jpg]

I was tempted to give my face a plumb-line, vertically-stemmed "y" tail, but decided that consistency with the latin over-rode that, and not all Cyrillic y's of that era had vertical tails, although from a design point it makes sense, avoiding bumping into the teeth (descenders) of preceding characters such as "de".</div>

Well, I let you talk me into making Fita, Yat, and Izhitsa :-)
Actually, I have decided against backwards compatability with 19th century Bulgarian.
It's one thing to do a type revival, but language revival is a horse of a different colour.
Thanks for the sample, though.

But seriously, let's talk about the yat. Pushkin, the great early-19th century author, used it, so the theory goes that it would be good to set his work that way (and a Scotch Modern would be the authentic type style) -- but what is the demand or inclination for that kind of thing? Wouldn't one employ one's time better making, for instance, schwa --to support present day Khazak users, etc?

		<div class="commentbody">Dear Nick,
I think that yat was a linguistic ballast in Pushkin's times. But... 
He probably used it as tool of poetry; for various technical, or aesthetic, romantic reasons. 
Including yat in the font could be a great hommage to his poetry. I suppose the poems ("modernised", written with e instead of Ѣ), loose the melody and probably some rhymes.

		<div class="commentbody">It is true that Church Slavonic is sometimes called Old Bulgarian, and that Russia and Bulgaria have had their own independent historical development of the Cyrillic letterforms.

But to go from there to criticizing Russian influence on Bulgarian type design as somehow inauthentic seems to be lacking something. Do people complain when Optima is used to set English texts as well as German ones, or when Bodoni is used to set French texts as well as Italian ones? No; it is recognized that from Poland to Spain, people are all using the same Latin alphabet, even if with slightly different sets of accented letters, and so of course they have the same pool of typefaces to choose from - even if different letter frequencies might make some typefaces more aesthetic in conjunction with some languages.

Bulgaria, Serbia, the Ukraine, Belarus, and so on share the Cyrillic alphabet with Russia. Here, some of the languages actually have additional letters, so the diversity is somewhat greater. But it is still not a question of trying to shoehorn one alphabet into the typefaces made for another - i.e., to take an Armenian typeface, and try to use those exact forms and styling for Amharic or Gujarati or Greek or Cyrillic or Latin.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Dear Marcin, 

I am not sure what you mean by ‘linguistic ballast’. In early 19th-century Russia using yat’—and also the decimal i, the fita, the izhitsa, the terminal yer, all abolished in 1918—was not an option. For sure, Pushkin did not use the yat’ ‘as a tool of poetry’; b.t.w., he also used it in his prose, his essays, his correspondence, his notes, his diaries, etc. He simply followed the standard spelling rules used in his times. 

F.y.i., the <a href="http://www.cms4site.ru/ru-joke-13-1917.html">pre-1918 spelling</a> is <em>still used</em>—in Russia and world-wide—in clerical literature, scholarly print, even <a href="http://lib.russportal.ru/index.php?id=index">general publishing</a>. This is why the letters whose use was officially discontinued in 1918 are often included in the digital Cyrillic fonts.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I introduced confusion. I know, that Lomonosov stated that the difference between sounds of Ѣ and e was barely unrecognisable. For me it looked like the evolving language started to throw the ballast away. But the rest of my post was overinterpretation. Old spelling rules were ubiquitous at the time (and they come back as we've seen), so yat' should be included in good Cyrillic font. 

Let me quote this photo as my self-ironic dedication to you, Mr. Maxim. Thank you.

Yes, it is considered spelling, according to the Unicode distinction between character and glyph.
By the same token, the long s (used by all English authors prior to 1800) should be considered different spelling.
It was not abolished by government decree, but fell from usage.

I'm pretty sure, however, that nobody really considers the long s to be a different spelling, any more than changing from two-bowl "g" to single bowl.</div>

Marcin, it looks like you know Russian. If you do, check that excellent <a href="http://www.elzabair.ru/cntnt/lmenu/biblioteka/lyubimye_s1/bajburin_a.html">essay on <em>yer</em></a> (the hard sign) written by Professor Albert Baiburin. It is very well written. I loved his quoting Leon Trotsky’s passionate rejection of <em>yat’</em>:

<ul><li><em>The letter </em>yat’<em>, as well as </em>the hard sign<em>, the </em>fita<em> and the </em>izhitsa<em> belong to that nobility class in our alphabet which has been eliminated by the October Revolution. Those were unnecessary, redundant letters, of the parasitic-gentility kind. They’ve been done away with </em>[…]<em>. As to the other letters, which are truly necessary—they have no noble, parasitic lineage, but are indeed hard-toiling, working letters.’</em></li></ul>Ah! ça ira, ça ira, ça ira.

When they recovered themselves it was too late: all yers were gone, and even if some have been left, no one would have dared using them. So they started using single or double apostrophe for the separating hard sign (e.g., <em>под’ем</em> instead of <em>подъем</em>); that felt both space-saving and politically correct.

		<div class="commentbody">The long s certainly did follow regular rules for its appearance. Essentially, the long s was used everywhere, with two exceptions: short s was used at the end of a word, and if s occurred twice in a row, the second one was a short s.

However, since both the long and short s were forms of the letter S, and because the long/short s rules were regular, use of long and short s would be thought of, I would suspect, as part of "how you wrote" a word, not "how you spelled" a word, since how you spell a word is the sequence of letters of which it is composed. Thus, "princess" is spelled P - R - I - N - C - E - S - S even if when you write it in lowercase it looks like princefs.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">You can’t write a substitution table, because some cases where ‘е’ is to be substituted by ‘ѣ’ results in multiple options, the choice amongst which is non-trivial and requires grammatical analysis of the sentence. The same can be said for other letters which appear in classical texts: ‘і’, ‘ѵ’, ‘ѳ’. Not only that, but the reforms of 1918 changed Russian grammar rules as well as spelling rules.

That said, I've created an online services that inserts ‘ѣ’ and other letters, including Bulgarian ‘ѫ’, where they should be in Russian and Bulgarian texts using a combination of algorithmic substitutions and dictionary lookups. Where multiple options are available for one modern word, all choices are presented.
