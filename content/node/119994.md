  body: "Unless this English photographer's stamp is recent it probably was not created
    directly from a font. To get something out of the box that would work you could
    use different fonts for the letters and numbers.\r\nThe scale of the stamp is
    small so there is some ambiguity in the letters.\r\nFor the lowercase letterforms
    you could use an English font like Eric Gill's Infant http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/gill-sans/std-infant/
    or a less quirky alternative in Nicholas Garner's Friendstar https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/aviation/fiendstar/\r\nBut
    you might get a closer match with a new font, Olivier Gourvat's Sofia. You have
    a choice of regular and condensed letters https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mostardesign/sofia-pro/
    and https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mostardesign/sofia-pro-condensed/\r\nOther possibilities
    include AG Schoolbook http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/ag-schoolbook-bq/
    and Alex Haigh's Hiruko https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/thinkdust/hiruko-pro/\r\nDon\r\n"
