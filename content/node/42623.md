body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nI have visited this blog for a long time, but I was busy with
  something else and did not created a account. I could have something to say about
  types and beautiful fh8 curves. I even have designed a nice form typeface in past
  seven or eight years, among some others experiments.\r\n\r\nIn the past two years
  I have been collecting letterpress artifacts (it is antique now baby) and after
  alotofgoingaroundandbiddingonauctionsandhoppingtogetthepiece I finally can tell
  to the word:\r\n\r\nAG Letterpress announces its promptness, headed to printing
  glory and adorned with 19th century and earlier great typography (I love type and
  the only thing I can say is that I would like to meet people that could be of some
  help - \"how the old type founders got their mats?\")\r\n\r\n\"AGL Grand Opening\"
  could well be a typeface name, why not. But the typeface is more then a table of
  characters. The presentation for this typeface which we already know the name is
  to be printed using my long waited Heidelberg T platen 1969 (groovy) - man, this
  press rocks. I also got a few old new ATF small type (Engravers 6 pt,  Caslon Italic
  14 pt, Shaded 12 on 18 pt, Craw Modern 6 pt and some others. My goal is to use this
  typefaces to print announcements and cards.\r\n\r\nAs a kid on a summer vacation
  I was first introduced to a letterpress shop. It was no more then a little cabinet
  with 16 cases of type, and a platen press 10\"x16\". That was in 1977 and few months
  later I was an apprentice. And so it happened: I am a type lover, and after 30 years
  of dealing with type I don't cease to admire letters.\r\n\r\nAs time permit I will
  posting some of my works. To start a picture of our dog, Nicky, which I designed
  as if it was a 'leadcut', and use it to print a card.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nAndre\r\n\r\n"
