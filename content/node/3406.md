  body: ' Hi Greg  <BR> <BR>Thanx for the reply <BR> <BR>In fact I&#39;ve drawn the
    whole alphabet in illustrator, and what would be in different layers, so different
    font later on are on the same layer in illustrator. I then paste the letters in
    fontographer, select and keep only the desired shapes that built one layer of
    the final font.I think it is what you call the same square, but without great
    result. I assume that when fontographer generate a font, it looses some presicion
    in keeping the outline as it is in the original .fog document. &#40;???&#41; '

  body: I understand how you&#39;re working and it appears to be a good solution,
    it&#39;s a shame it doesn&#39;t works... <BR>What I wanted to say is you can also
    define your layers in illustrator, keep only the desired shapes on each layer
    as you already do, and after draw a fixed-size square &#40;only outline&#41; around
    each letter and import all that in fontographer, one layer after one. You have
    then to delete this square in the .fog. <BR>Give it a try if you want... &#40;If
    you can understand my frenchspoken english &#74; &#41;
