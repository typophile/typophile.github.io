  body: It sounds like the firm is high-tech and green, which doesn't really say 1920s-40s
    arts & crafts to me. So, rather than seek something to complement Chelsea Studio,
    I would drop it and use something more modern like <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=Klavika">Klavika</a>
    or <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=FF%20Olsen">FF
    Olsen</a> that portrays the true nature of the company.

  body: "I'd give one of the \"new-but-inspired-by-jobbing-sans-of-the-mid-20th-century\"
    faces a try. Their historical roots will give them an affinity with Chelsea, while
    their simple geometric finish conveys modernity.\r\n\r\nThink Gotham (H&FJ), Proxima
    Nova (Mark Simonson), or Relay (Font Bureau)."
