body: Greetings from Charleston, SC! A resident was working on a historic house in
  Charleston and unearthed a stone marker with the name DAVIS carved on it. The owner
  is unaware of any Davis family connections to the house. The stone looks vaguely
  like some sort of a memorial, but maybe not a personal grave marker. Perhaps a marker
  for a family's plot? The look of the lettering is very artistic. It has a general
  1910s look, but I'm no expert on lettering. I would love to try to pinpoint the
  general age of the marker to help with identifying its use. It's only five letters,
  so it might be too small a sample, but it is unique enough that, if it was even
  a well-defined set and not just a one-off design, it might be identifiable. Any
  thoughts?

  body: "The style of lettering is Lombardic (aka versal), and has been around for
    centuries (as in since the Middle Ages and the time of illuminated manuscripts).\r\n\r\nBecause
    of that, the style of lettering alone won\u2019t help much with pinpointing the
    date of the marker. \r\n\r\nAlphabets used for stone carving prior to the age
    of digital type often diverged from those used for printing, but similar printing
    type styles appear in type specimens from the early through the late 19th century.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s
    a vaguely similar digital revival of the style.\r\nhttp://haroldsfonts.com/portfolio/king-xmas/"

  body: Rats. Thanks! But rats! I was hoping to pinpoint the age of the marker. Oh
    well. The mystery continues!
