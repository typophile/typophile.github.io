body: "Heeeelp! I really need to identify several different typefaces from a book.
  it's a 1988 release, printed using offset lithography method.\r\n*Sorry for using
  photobucket, The file attacher just won't do the job...\r\n\r\n\r\n1. What are the
  names of these two different display typefaces? (for the word \"Adventures\" and
  \"Wine Route\")\r\nhttp://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm224/shinnggo/Title.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.
  What are the names of the swash serif used for the on the word \"Advetures\" and
  \"Wine Route\"?\r\nhttp://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm224/shinnggo/Insidetitle.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.
  What are the names of the serif on the for the body text? it's quite a heavy (but
  not too much) for a body text with a dark font colour.\r\nhttp://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm224/shinnggo/Bodytext.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAny
  help will be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance!"

    I'm not sure which Garamond. An \"earmark\" of Garamond is the angled serif on
    the left of the T and vertical on the right of the T. \r\n\r\nJust checking further
    the \"Adventures,\" which has some lovely swash characters, seems to be Ludlow
    Garamond, though I'm assuming it would have been a photo version. The rest may
    well be a different version of Garamond. "

    the phototypesetting typefaces are beyond my knowledge. (another thank you for
    correcting me about which technology was used to print the book)\r\n\r\nNow, Does
    anyone know what are the names of the display types on the cover? (Question no.

  body: Actually, I might be wrong about it being phototype. The text looks a lot
    like [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/american-garamond/|American Garamond]],
    but it seems to me the ascenders are a little shorter than the current version.

  body: "I think they probably used Garamond Light Italic (Ludlow) and and Swash ones
    for the 'A' and 'R' for the inside title, and [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/american-garamond/|American
    Garamond]] for the text is a good possibility....\r\n\r\nI just found out that
    the WINE ROUTE type is \"Empire\" designed by Morris F. Benton But I couldn't
    find any information about the what seems to be an old western saloon typeface
    for \"ADVENTURES\", anyone know what is it?"

  body: 'WINE ROUTE isn''t Empire, which is more monoline. The thick-thin thing was
    pioneered by Radiant, though if I remember rightly it was originally a sign painter''s
    thing, and this I think is a condensed version, like this later version: [[http://www.identifont.com/list?2+radiant+8+7OJ+1+8YT+1+65M+1+5C0+1+8RX+1+7FZ+1+8RZ+1+5AJ+1+5AK+1+5AL+1+6IV+1|Radiant

    don\u2019t know which of the different digitalisation (other than various Empires,
    it can also be found as Silhouette and Iris) is the best match.\r\n\r\nAs for
    Adventures, it doesn\u2019t look like the typical western-style condensed. More
    like someone added some median spurs to a Century condensed."

  body: 'You''re right Riccardo; don''t know why on first glance I thought Empire
    was more monoline. Just checking, Britannic was 1901, so I was also wrong about
    Radiant being the pioneer of this thick-thin sans style in type. '

  body: Umm yeah I'm aware that some sites might make the "Empire" font seem like
    a monoline, anyway thank you all guys for the tremendous help, still have no idea
    what the name of the spurred Century condensed, maybe I'll find that out later.
