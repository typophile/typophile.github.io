  I feel stupid not being able to identify it. The Q has a long graceful tail very
  similar to Adobe Caslon. The J is pointed at the bottom rather than rounded as in
  Caslon. The curve of the ball of the p crosses the stem slightly. The e and a have
  small counters. I don&#39;t have a scan to upload right at the moment. Any ideas?
  Thanks!

    &#40;which is what I was interested in&#41; is in fact Hoefler text. Good eye.
    <BR>Thanks again, <BR>Tom
