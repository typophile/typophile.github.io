  body: "Berthold's Block Condensed, designed by H. Hoffmann in 1908, has matching
    letter forms but is a heavier weight than the poster's heading: _Bekanntmachung_
    [notice]. The Woellmer foundry produced it's own version of Hoffmann's typeface
    and sold it under the name of Hermes Grotesque Semi-bold. See the specimens of
    Block and Hermes  at p255 of Jaspert's _Type Encyclopaedia [1970]_. Hermes is
    slightly lighter than Berthold's Block Condensed and the weight and letter widths
    seems to be an pretty much an exact match to _Bekanntmachung_.  However, there
    are minor differences in the mid stroke of the letter _a_ and the arms of _k_.
    Hermes was digitized by by Tagir Safayev and is sold by Paratype \r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/hermes/\r\nParatype's
    Hermes would be a better match for the weight of the headline and would fit the
    font point size used in the poster, but Block is closer for _a_ and _k_ letter
    forms.\r\nSo you have a choice between two fonts with an equally Germanic Sans
    Serif character of the era. Either way, it seems you could have a very effective
    poster.\r\nDon\r\n"
