body: "Hey Guys,\r\nMy current workflow for creating oblique glyphs is to create a
  straight glyph and then change the value of angle in the glyph properties dialogue
  box. It is very cumbersome and nothing but a trail and error. Is there any other
  method to create angled guides in fontlab?\r\nThanks\r\n"

    you will get all your guides in that very angle.
