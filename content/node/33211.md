  I'm doing a poster and I drew these calligraphic letters to use in it and I was
  just wondering what you all might think of them, especially regarding kerning and
  word spacing.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screenshot_242_6322.jpg]\r\n<!--break-->\r\n\r\nBy
  the way, for our portuguese members (I'm sorry for being \"rude\" and writing this

  body: "Thanks for your help, Tim! Unfortunately, I had to print the posters this
    morning, so I couldn't change anything... it was a bit short notice. You're probably
    right about the kerning and wordspacing, though... I'd been staring at it for
    so long that I didn't even know what the words meant, let along kern it all properly!
    Oh well, not that big of a problem. :)\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about the letters?
    Could I aspire to be, one day, a reasonable type designer? I think I could do
    better \u2013 especially with that S (sounds funny) and that D \u2013, but I really
    didn't have the time or the patience...\r\n\r\nruD"

  body: "It's nice calligraphy, although I've always thought one of calligraphy's
    niceties is that it's not as mechanical as typography.  You can't yet (that I
    know of) control thinks like ink flow and coverage in existing font standards.
    \ Imagine the interesting things we could see if you not only defined shapes and
    outlines for fonts but also opacities or stroke directions.  But individual variation
    between letters, spacing, etc \u2014 often in spite of an attempted supression
    thereof, at least in Latinate calligraphy, Arabic and Asian of course being very
    different stories \u2014\_that's what gives calligraphy it's \"charm\".  Type,
    like I said, is pretty mechnical, even though we can fake having it lose that
    mechanical property.  At least, this is how I've always related the two.\r\n\r\nNow

  body: "I like the 'meaty' quality of your calligraphic type. You should compare
    your effort to other typographic versions of the Carolingian miniscule. Most of
    them are more sparkly, so there may be a place for this as a display face.  \r\n\r\nFor
    type and consistency of spacing you have to look out for things like the terminal
    on the u being much longer than on the a, which presents problems for spacing.
    \r\n\r\nThe a is wider than it would be traditionally, and maybe too wide.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Well, you're right, hrant, of course... but I love calligraphic type like
    Centaur and the likes, sometimes we can surely mix it up a bit and defy deffinitions.
    :P\r\n\r\nAnd thanks for the pointers, William! That detail about the terminal
    being of different length in those letters is certainly (maybe obvious for some
    but still) quite helpful. :) I do agree on the lcA being too wide... and originally
    it was actually even wider! I had a similar problem with the original letters
    on the lcO \u2013 which was far too slim even in this version \u2013 and the lcU
    \u2013 too wide \u2013, but I guess those were corrected, at least in the final
    version. Overall, this was a pretty much rough and sketchy (and lazy, I admit)
    first approach to the design of a calligraphic seriffed face, but it worked pretty
    nicely on the poster... I guess it's got that \"meaty\" quality that makes it
    a nice display face. :) \r\n\r\nBy the way, here's the version I ended up using...
    you almost can't tell the difference, but the lcA is less wide and the lcO is
    wider. I also messed around with the kerning, but today, when we put the posters
    up on the wall, I realised it wasn't that good...\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screenshot_245_4303.jpg]\r\n\r\nOh,
    and Guifa: I don't get much information regarding this sort of thing, but I'll
    let Typophile know when I do. :)\r\n\r\nruD"
