  body: "It's a clever design (the one in red is my favorite) and it would certainly
    work very well in small sizes, and I could even see it work as a website animation
    with it appearing gradually left to right as if it's being drawn and then the
    \"i\" dotted at the end. \r\n\r\nBut I don't know if I'd see it as a \"vi\" unless
    I already knew what it was. Have you tried putting a slight separation between
    the letters, or making the letters overlap rather than join, or maybe the \"v\"
    in black and the \"i\" in red? Of course those ideas would also disrupt the flow
    of the logo, so I'm not sure if they'd help or hurt."

  body: "thanks for your feedback.\r\n\r\nwhich particular red did you prefer? They
    are all slightly different.\r\n\r\nat this point I think the red ones look best
    because they are much more refined, the bottom one is refined also, but I don't
    like it so much as it moves away from the calligraphic form which was the initial
    idea behind the mark. \r\n\r\ni don't think not instantly getting the \"vi\" part
    is a problem, i actually like it being quite abstract. \r\n\r\nOne other thing
    I would love some suggestions on is the text to go with the logo. \r\n\r\nI was
    thinking of something along the lines of 'DESIGN & WEB' however I can see how
    that may be a bit of a clich\xE8. Is it important for my mark to convey exactly
    what i do? And web is a very vague term these days, as one can be a front-end
    developer, a web designer, a SEO guru or a usability expert. Myself I do design,
    front-end & usability.\r\n\r\nI could also just have Victor Ivanov to go along
    with the mark, but I think if I were to put my name there, I should probably explain
    what i offer. \r\n\r\nWould love to hear your thoughts everyone, I really want
    to nail this identity mark and move on to the website redesign + stationary etc.

    also weird to see a calligraphically rendered \"vi\" with a perfectly geometric
    dot to the i."

  body: "hi again, \r\n\r\nresurrecting this thread...\r\n\r\nstill not happy with
    my mark.\r\n\r\nplease let me know what you think of this?\r\nhave any suggestions,
    please feel free to express them. \r\ni have tried many other options, but i really
    like the simplicity of this idea, i just think the execution is not quite there
    yet...\r\n\r\nBONUS POINT on the new version, the formed shape also creates a
    cyrillic letter '\u0418' which is the 1st letter of my surname and being Russian,
    I quite like that ;)\r\n\r\n\r\nps, also just realised this may not be the best
    section of the forum. If any admins see this, can we please move this thread to
    corporate id? I think i might get more luck there :)\r\n\r\n\r\nthank you\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/morelogo_4198.gif]"

  body: "The mark is nice enough, but without text it doesn't say the name of the
    company.  \r\n\r\nIt feels a bit like an egg cracking open, which could be a good
    metaphor I guess.  The font you have there doesn't fit the type of business at
    all in my opinion.  Good job pushing forward with new concepts."

    sure...\r\n\r\nLuma : you're right, the type doesn't work at all. Was really just
    playing with some typefaces, but perhaps a nice sans will work much better. I
    don't necessarily want the mark to spell out the name, just give out a hint of
    my initials. \r\n\r\nthank you for your feedback.\r\n\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/vi123_6256.png]"
