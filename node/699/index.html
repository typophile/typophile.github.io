  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">holy cow! what an awesome time i had in minneapolis. now i'm all excited because i actually know fellow type-heads on this site. probably the best part for me was just meeting people in the community and making personal connections. i always love making new friends, and am already excited about the prospect of returning next year, to hang out and meet even more of you fine folks. as far as the actual program goes, my favorite stuff was the lettering workshop with ken barber, the letterpress tomfoolery on friday afternoon (what's this colored stuff on my hands?), and the typeface; twin cities presentation. well, who can forget armin's repeated mention of &quot;the f-word&quot; during the blog panel discussion? funny stuff.  <BR> <BR>so, what was your favorite part everyone?</div>

It was a privilege to meet the students, to work with them, and to see them participate in many aspects of the meeting.  <BR> <BR>We're all beginners at some point in this field; students are our past, present, and future. They were crucial to the success of this year's TypeCon; those of us who are professionals must reciprocate by assisting them however we can.

I'll let you all know when I'm done. <BR> <BR>And well, I guess I have to step up to the plate and put my dream in writing and in Google's cache for generations to come. So here it is, uncensored, unbiased and with Hrant's blessing: <BR> <BR>I dreamt that Hrant came to my house, the weird thing is that it was his typophile picture only (since that is as far as I know what Hrant looks like). So he came in, and went &quot;Number Two&quot; in my bathroom without flushing, after that, he headed out to the kitchen to hang out and stuff. So I go into my bathroom and see these unflushed turds in my toilet. I go up to Hrant and say &quot;Excuse me, Hrant, you left your turds in my toilet.&quot; His response involved handing me a plunger and adding &quot;This should fix it.&quot; And that was it.  <BR> <BR>Freud would have a field day with this one.  <BR> <BR>TypeCon rocked! <BR> <BR>Oh, regarding the &quot;f&quot; word stuff, did anybody notice that I actually never said  during the talk?</div>

It was so great to meet and talk to so many interesting and talented people. The workshops and talks were great too. Tamye, Richard, and everyone involved did an amazing job and I feel privileged and lucky to have been a part of it. I can't wait for the next one.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Friends and fellow Typophiles. My heart and mind are the both of them full.  <BR> <BR>TypeCon was amazing. The event itself was well-planned and well-executed!! But it was the people that &quot;made the pudding&quot;. Being able to talk with others whom are as obsessed and in love with letters as much as am I, well, it left me content and happy and overwhelmed. All at the same time.  <BR> <BR>The conference high points for me were Letterror's presentation of their Metro (for reason's both obvious to those whom also attended, and a few reasons better left unwritten) and Peter Bilak's &quot;Tschaikovsky Ballet&quot;. It was Tschaikovsky, wasn't it? &lt;<IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>&gt; <BR> <BR>Jon, your summation is perfect. P-E-R-F-E-C-T!!  <BR> <BR>Meeting all of you, putting names to faces (and with this mind hopefully they'll stick) &hellip; The internet is wonderful, but you certainly cannot replace the human warmth that comes from sharing your personal space with someone that understands your passions in life. <BR> <BR>I'm completely exhausted, but in a did too much, didn't sleep enough, didn't want to sleep, kind of way. <BR> <BR>For those that didn't go this year, create a little piggy-bank and start saving NOW!! <BR> <BR>Be proud of the little neighborhood that you've created here at Typophile. <BR> <BR>I'm going to bed now, 5 hours earlier than the last few nights. Possibly I'll have more thoughts to add tomorrow. For now I go to bed with a smile of satisfaction on my face.  <BR> <BR>Oh, and one more thing. Kristin, you rock!  <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hello everyone! I got back to Vancouver this afternoon and after 5 hours of much needed sleep, it's great to see you guys here talking about the conference already! Armin, your report is excellent! Yes, the conference was just amazing. It was way beyond my expectations! I enjoyed it so much. It was a little weird at first to meet some of you in person after having known each other online, nothing can substitute a real meeting! I think we have to thank our online community for uniting us beforehand, which is partially why this event was so successful. I now know I have real friends all over the country/world that share a common passion! Of course we have to thank Tamye and SOTA, for their tireless work putting together such a well-organized and content-rich conference! Well done! I'll be back&hellip; I'm so tired I can't really think straight right now. I'll get myself organized and write up something on my site soon.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nice report Armin. I'm sorry a small joke about the candor <BR>of SpeakUp became its mantra during the conference. I <BR>wish people would just -off. <BR> <BR>Tyler - was a pleasure to meet you. You are a good man,  <BR>and funny. <BR> <BR>Kristin is the coolest. She is both the mom you wish you  <BR>had and the distant friend you wish was living nearby,  <BR>dispensing wisdom and humor with humilty <BR>and ease. <BR> <BR>Praise to Mr. Coltz for gracing Typophile with his presence. <BR>His posts from today are all indicative of the quality we can <BR>expect from Jon. His writing is better than his dancing <BR>(fortunately, we all have a much greater need for the former). <BR> <BR>Dyana, I envy your job and latin moves. Glad to finally meet <BR>you, and I look forward to your FB releases. <BR> <BR>Mark Simonson probably didn't detect it, but I was in such <BR>giddy awe of his presence at my table during lunch on <BR>Saturday that I couldn't eat my quesadilla. What a friendly, <BR>amiable fellow, full of talent, and willing to share. Mark <BR>personifies the best aspects of TypeCon. <BR> <BR>Keith - Please monogram my linen. Your lettering skills are striking. <BR> <BR>Jared &amp; Joe - I expect you to post the video coverage of our  <BR>panel discussion soon. It will prove that you two are the <BR>driving force behind today's typographic dialogue and  <BR>community. Without dominating the panel, you directed the <BR>discussion down the most prudent path. I was proud to  <BR>share the TypeCon experience with a couple of Utahns. <BR> <BR>John B, Chris, and the others. It really was grand to meet <BR>your faces. I wish I had more time to spend with you. Next <BR>year, for sure. <BR> <BR>Tiffany Wardle is the best roommate ever. I suggest you all <BR>consider bunking with her at AtypI.</div>

Jon Coltz is an incredibly charming and gracious man, eloquent and sincere. Dyana &ndash; you go girl! Jared and Joe &ndash; solid guys. <BR> <BR>I apologize to all the Typophiles whom I met only briefly but didn't have a chance to really get to know (or didn't even get to meet). Each year I meet more and more people and sometimes I go into stimulation overload. So forgive me if I inadvertently dissed anyone. <BR> <BR>&ndash; K.</div>
