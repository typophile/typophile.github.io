(Word processors and graphics programs often come with full copies of fonts, usable by any application on the same computer. Their makers pay quite a bit to license those fonts.)</p>
<p>This is not at all the same thing as you using the font, and making documents with it. You are literally reselling the font, from their point of view.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">A book is a static text, and the font is not being &lsquo;used&rsquo; by the reader of the book. A font embedded in an app is, typically, being used by the app or by the end user in a variety of ways, e.g. displaying dynamic text or actually creating text. This is pretty straight-forward code licensing from the perspective of an app developer, like licensing an API or DLL. There&rsquo;s a pretty basic cost/benefit analysis to be made that is the same for fonts as for other embedded code: roll your own, license from someone, or find an open source or free option.</div>

<p>Yes, in this respect the analogy is closer to that of webfont. But if part of the complaint re app embedding licensing for fonts is that it is too complicated, trying to make a licensing distinction between apps that display text and apps in which text is created seems unlikely to simplify anything.</p>
<p>Mind you, I don&rsquo;t think simplifying the licensing of fonts for app embedding is necessarily in anyone&rsquo;s interests, and I&rsquo;m surprised to see some foundries trying to provide generic pricing for such licensing. Different apps have different capabilities and hence different needs, not to mention different value. It seems much more like the custom font development market in which I operate than the retail font licensing market, and I would expect any license agreement in such a market to be individually negotiated and subject to a particular agreement (as would be the case for most other embedded code). I understand that app developers might appreciate the convenience of a single license and pricing model, but that would inevitably mean that some of them would be paying more then they might otherwise, while others would be getting a great deal that fails to reward the foundry for the kind of value the fonts add to the product.</p>

<p>Fonts are typically licensed based on the number of those who will make use of the font&rsquo;s compositional capabilities.</p>
<p>I think this has been a great year for questions about how fonts are licensed, and a bit of a breakout year for ebooks, mags, and apps, while  game licensing of fonts just keeps humming along.</p>
<p>Some might be puzzled by the unbelievable choice, but &ldquo;sorry state&rdquo; is, I think, a simplification.</p>

We (<a href="http://www.monokrom.no">www.monokrom.no</a>) offer app licenses priced by units downloaded per month. It is certainly not a catch-all solution, but neither is licensing fonts for web nor print (think huge international magazine vs. student). With our app licenses, one of the goals was to offer a reasonable price for small and/or free projects. Up to 50 units downloaded* per month, the one-time fee per font is only slightly less than a regular 1–5 desktop license.</p>

<p>a) Downloads is always trackable, but probably not for us. We are fine with that and trust our customers to purchase a suitable license. This is not much different from desktop licenses.</p>
<p>b) We operate with a one-time fee, so this isn’t an issue.</p>
<p>Might I add:</p>
<p>c) We are working on a solution for upgrades that allows the customer to deduct previous purchased licenses if/when downloaded units per month increases and they need a new license.</p>
