body: Hi Y&#39;all, <BR> <BR>I am looking for some great type people to come talk
  to our graphics students at CCSF in the Spring 05 semester. <BR> <BR>How about you?
  <BR> <BR>There would be little to no compensation, but you would have the opportunity
  to influence and inspire our students. <BR> <BR>The ideal speaker would be able
  to speak about issues of wide appeal to graphic designers, or would be accomplished
  enough to have a large body of their own work to show. Forming a panel of speakers
  is also a possibility. <BR> <BR>Let me know if you are interested. <BR> <BR>Thanks!
  <BR> <BR>Amy
