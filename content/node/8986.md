body: Hi everyone. <BR>I&#39;m having a lot of trouble exporting a mac suitcase &#40;T1&#41;
  in Fontlab 4.6, MacOSX.  <BR> <BR>The manual says that FOND name and FOND ID must
  be the same for the different files in the same suitcase. But when I try to put,
  for example, a plain and an italic weights into the same suitcase and check the
  &#34;Adobe Type Reunion compatible&#34;, it pops a message saying that FOND IDs
  are duplicated. When I export the suitcase &#40;without &#34;Adobe Type Reunion
  compatible&#34;&#41; and install it in Extensis Suitcase, the program crashes. And
  when I simply put the suitcase file into the system fonts folder and test it in
  any aplication like illustrator or freehand, there are missing weights and wrong
  associations &#40;for example the Light weight is associated to Medium weight&#41;.
  <BR> <BR>Thanks <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>Thank you
