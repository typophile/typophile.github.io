  fonts are available for web linking. These fonts usually contain a large set of
  OpenType features, which are only accessible in OpenType-savvy applications like
  InDesign, Illustrator or QuarkXPress. Browsers have barely supported such advanced
  typographic features so far. But with the latest Beta of Firefox 4 this is about
  to change \u2026\r\n\r\nhttp://bit.ly/9FVmg0\r\n\r\nsee also: http://typophile.com/node/73173"

  body: "I will love to see OT features supported in all mayor browsers !!!!!\r\n\r\nFirefox
    (3.5+) already support ligatures (enabled by default), but most web-fonts have
    then removed when making the \"optimized\" version of the web.\r\n\r\nGoogle is
    now serving my Lobster (1.4) including the all the ligatures, and you can compare
    how it looks in Firefox vs all the other browsers, and will spot the difference.
    \r\n\r\nHave a look at this site, for example, in different browsers: http://bodesigns.com/"
