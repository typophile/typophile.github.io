  noticing that the [[kerning]] tables have some really awful spots. It's in some
  really obvious pairs, 1 and 0, J and u. \r\n\r\nWhat fonts do you think have the
  best and worst kerning tables? I'm giving best to House Industries Ed family, and
  worst to a nasty old Akzidenz Grotesk that I think was one of the earlier releases
  from Berthold Types Ltd. "

    It's difficult to beat Mrs Eaves on the \"worst\" end, even though its letterforms
    are so superbly appealing; it's the ravishing, elegant woman with a terminal speech
    impediment.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    it. \r\n\r\nI assume your criteria are not numbers of pairs, but appropriateness
    and completeness? Some typefaces need very light kerning, so the number of pairs
    is low. Some apparently simple ones need a lot.\r\n\r\nI remember doing print
    production in the '90's, having to use Univers Condensed Light (from Adobe, maybe?)
    every day, at tiny sizes and remarking that it appeared to have NO kerning. Can
    you think of examples of bad kerning that's worse than no kerning? "

  body: "Not exactly OT, but I will nominate two metal fonts that have superb fit
    in spite of lack of kerning.\r\n\r\nThe winner, I think, is Zeno. The best easily
    accessible example is the page from The Four Gospels, reproduced in \"Account
    of the work of a hand press\".\r\n\r\nAnd the runner-up is Kennerly Old Style,
    by Fred Goudy. This is the face used in his book, \"The Alphabet,\" and I think
    there are quotes from him about how he tried explicitly to design it so the serifs
    would connect visually with each other and there would be a flow.\r\n\r\nIn both
    of these cases, it's not immediately apparent to me what makes the fit so much
    better than average, but I haven't (yet) spent the time to really study the interactions
    between letterforms in depth.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I'm still looking forward to
    what people have to say about digital releases. I'm reading \"Children of the
    Lamp,\" by P. B. Kerr, to the boys now, and it's set in Mrs. Eaves. I repeated
    Hrant's quip to them and asked them whether they agreed, but I don't think their
    typographic sense is <em>quite</em> that refined yet. In any case, that's a face
    that I think doesn't quite work in a book."

    font made to emulate a metal one, with no kerning, intended to show that you don't
    really need kerning. As far as I'm concerned it shows no such thing, but presumably
    it's spaced very carefully (especially since Dan actually cuts metal fonts).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
