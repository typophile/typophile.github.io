  body: I think some glyphs specially &#34;o&#34; and the &#34;O&#34; you posted here
    are very similar to the ones you get streamlined from a image, look for the inside
    of these glyphs. So, I would say this is not a font but someones writed down,
    traced &amp; adjusted it... But then again it can be a trace over the original
    logo <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"

  body: Got me -- I checked all the free font handwriting pages I cared to. I&#39;m
    really bothered that not only did they not differentiate the two zeroes for such
    a simple logotype, but the lower-case o is just a smaller, widened zero.

  body: It may not be a font, actually -- looking at the website, this is the only
    instance of this type of writing; the other handwriting font on the page is something
    else entirely. The thing that would make people think it&#39;s a font is that
    the zeroes and lower-case o are identical. But that may simply be sloppy logo-making
    and not actually a font. If it is a font, it&#39;s one that we haven&#39;t been
    able to spot so far.
