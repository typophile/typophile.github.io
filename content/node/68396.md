body: "Hello, \r\n\r\nIn this logo I use Bodoni Poster Italic font.\r\nHowever, I
  don't have much experience working with classic linked typefaces.\r\n\r\n1. I've
  changed a bit the default kerning so it feels homogeneous and works as logotype.\r\n
  \  Does the rhythm of letters looks correct? (http://klim.co.il/misc/logo_01.jpg)\r\n\r\n2.
  It is TTF font, so it doesn't complete the links between letters.\r\n   So I built
  them manually. Are they correct? (http://klim.co.il/misc/logo_01.jpg)\r\n\r\n3.
  The opened link of \"m\" looked unnecessary, so I decided to cut it.\r\n   It became
  a little limping, so I compensated it by pulling the stem a bit lower.\r\n   I also
  fixed the kerning between \"m\" and \"&\". (http://klim.co.il/misc/logo_02.jpg)\r\n
  \  I've tried to decide what correct angle the cut should be according \r\n   to
  the cuts of \"&\" and \"C\". Is that ok? (http://klim.co.il/misc/logo_03.jpg)\r\n\r\nThanks
  a lot for any help and suggestions!\r\n "

    the upper serifs.\r\nPersonally I prefer the first version, without the cutting
    of the m.\r\nI also would join together C and o."

  body: "Quite lovely. \r\n\r\nI wouldn't dock the tail on the m though. But if you
    do, think not only about the the angle of the other tails but also the termination
    height in relationship to the base line.\r\n\r\nI'm being pretty very picky here
    but I might tighten the C and o VERY slightly if you don't join them."

  body: "Love this font. My opinions:\r\n\r\nDone pretty well with joining the 'lim'
    up, maybe could do with a bit of smoothing out.\r\n\r\nI agree with Jennifer on
    docking the 'm' - dont do it. If you feel the need to, just cut a tiny bit of
    in order to have consistency with the terminal direction on the C and ampersand.\r\n\r\nWith
    regard to the 'K - l' kerning, you could try docking both serifs to bring them
    closer, or perhaps have the l serif pointing upwards and therefore slotting underneath
    the K? Just a thought.."

  body: "Let me just nitpick. Why only connect 3 of the letters? It is a bold move
    and a little \"tricky feathers\". Does lim mean something specific? I might try
    to find a way to connect the K to lim and the Co as well. Leave the ampersand
    floating and visually joining the two.\r\n\r\nIf you are a type designer why use
    Klim? I'd think you'd want to set yourself apart.\r\n\r\n"
