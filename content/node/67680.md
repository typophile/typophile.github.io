    difference between\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sideboard_5386.jpg]\r\nand\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/drawers_3734.jpg]\r\nIf
    the factory specialises in a particular style, then this should be reflected in
    the typeface selection, as this will help establish a consistent identity."

    the cabinetry products, or is this for a logo or identity for the company (to
    be used in advertising, etc)?\r\n\r\nIf it's to be <strong>ON</strong> the product,
    I think I would go with something traditional like GOUDY, or maybe a more up to
    date traditional like WATERS TITLING.\r\n\r\nIf it's for corporate identity, I'd
    go more contemporary. A script style perhaps.\r\n\r\n"
