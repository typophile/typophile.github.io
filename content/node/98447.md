body: "dear typophiles!\r\n\r\ni am glad to show you my new release, ZionTrain Pro
  typefamily. I started this font five years ago for city transportation and overall
  city corporative font as a part of project of second largest Ukrainian city [[http://3z.com.ua/portfolio/identity/1602/|Kharkiv
  identity]] by 3z studio. when designing distinctive characters for the font i was
  wonder how shapes from Ukrainian calligraphy works fine for wayfinding grotesque
  (look at the tails of Cyrillic -\u0449- and -\u0446- for example). unfortunately,
  this type was not used as planned, but was lived on the street as font of some cultural
  events, and was used for Kharkiv promotion. \r\n\r\nit was featured in Slanted magazine
  #18 Signage/Orientation.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ziontrain_layout_pro2_6252.png]\r\n\r\nnow
  ZionTrain Pro supports all three European scripts and has additional roman stencil
  family. i welcome you to download [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/andrijtype/zion-train-pro/pro-stencil-demibold/?refby=Cyrillic|Stencil
  Demibold]] with full encoding (Cyrillic, Greek & Latin, alternates, old style digits,

  body: The Stencil looks pretty well done, though some of the tongues might be prone
    to buckling, were it a real stencil.

  body: "glad you like it, Sevag!\r\n\r\nthank you, Nick. interesting that 'Gray City'
    is the name of historic Kharkiv one part. but with rich architectural heritage
    (Kharkiv was the heart of [[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Gosprom|ukrainian
    constructivism]]) it looks bright for me. \r\n\r\nthank you, T\xE9! i know two
    issues: o-slash and a-ring, do you saw something else?"

  body: "I was thinking of the 'a' whose counter 'tongue' has little support. Couldn't
    help but try to visualise if it would look better or worse were the 'bridges'
    moved further left.\r\n\r\nWhen I was younger, much younger than today, I was
    occasionally involved in salting herring. They were still using wooden barrels
    then. I think that was when I got interested in stencil type."
