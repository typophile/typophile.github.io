  but more like a \"sunday travel 4x4 off road\". I was thinking in use the wonderful
  SOHO\u2122 COMPRESSED ULTRA but it is very expensive. Do you guys know a \"cheaper\"
  version with the same style...BTW if you could suggest a good font to go with...\r\nThanks
  in advance!\r\n\r\nAnt\xF3nio\r\n\r\n"
