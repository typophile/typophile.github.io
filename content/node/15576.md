    this might explain the little differences.

  body: Well, not exactly -- FBi's Grotesque is based on similar models, but looks
    decidedly American, while Monotype's is very British.

  body: Well, I've always had a soft spot for the regular width <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=C.6074.0.1"
    target="new">Light</a> and <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=C.6074.0.3"
    target="new">Normal</a> weight of the Monotype version -- deliciously quirky with
    that weird balance and nice vintage stroke modulation. Though I agree the FBi
    version is very beautiful as well.
