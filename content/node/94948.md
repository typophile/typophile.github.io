body: "Well, on a recent trip to Annapolis, Maryland\u2014where mine goodly wife and
  I attended a very special wedding and had an overall incredible time\u2014all I
  had to do was ask for it. For my money, IMHO, Moretti La Birra Rossa is the best
  double-bock on the planet\u2014if double-bock is what you are into, which I am,
  so it makes perfect sense.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, the inn we stayed at\u2014right across
  from the Maryland State House and, oddly enough, called the State House Inn (what
  are the odds of that?)\u2014has a lovely Italian restaurant attached to it\u2014literally\u2014with
  a LOT of friendly people working there. Plus, given the contiguous nature of stuff,
  they even bring it to your room, served up on fine china, with real cloth napkins,
  at a 10% discount, because you're staying in the inn. My old man, the cheapskate,
  would have loved this place!\r\n\r\nAnyhow, I splurge the first night and tell the
  missus to order whatever she wants off the menu, no matter the price\u2014which,
  I figured, couldn't be TOO bad, if freaking rack of lamb is only thirty bucks\u2014and
  we have a wonderful time eating, and then\u2014none of your business. The only problem
  is: it's too much of a good thing. Which means a sumptuous morning knosh the next
  day, already bought and paid for. Sweet!\r\n\r\nSo, the next night, we buy the best
  appetizer on the menu and some seafood fettucine, and we're set! Except for another
  Moretti. Well, the bill comes to forty-four bucks, and I am feeling so much love
  that I decide to SHARE the love, American style of course, and flip out a twenty
  for the tip. Mister Big Shot! For twenty lousy bucks! Well, the manager, Jose, who
  is a real hep cat, says, \u201CToo much, man!\u201D And I say, \u201CThank you for
  noticing,\u201D only he is not saying what I <em>think</em> he is saying. And, to
  prove it, he pulls ANOTHER TWO Morettis out of the cooler and INSISTS that I take
  them, ON THE HOUSE. So, what do I do? What do you think? I take them, even though\u2014at
  7.2% ABV\u2014three of these babies is like five regular beers, which is just about
  enough to get me in trouble.\r\n\r\nSo, forget the gift horse stuff: the one thing
  I DO NOT look in the mouth is free beer, no matter what, because that's the kinda
  guy I am. So, with and after dinner, I have two, leave one in the fridge for the
  next lucky patron\u2014who will consider him or herself fortunate if they just happen
  to like THIS PARTICULAR kind of beer (God will provide, I figure, and I hope he
  provides an opener, because the good stuff does NOT have a twist-off cap). And,
  what happens next when I am feeling frisky, is also TMI. If you catch my drift\u2026\r\n\r\nAnyhow\u2026I
  wish I could make it to TypeCon THIS year but, life being what it is, I have come
  up with far too many reasons not to the the right thing for a change, and I NEED
  to take a trip to Dallas in August (oh, the inexpressible joy!) to see my 85-year-old
  mom before she croaks\u2014which all parties concerned hope is not soon, but you
  never know, do you?\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the dearly departed, my cheapskate dad just
  LOVED Schlitz and, from time to time, I buy a sixer of the stuff\u2014which, for
  its class (which is low) is pretty decent stuff. Trouble is, you can't always find
  it where I live\u2014although, since it is THE beer which made Milwaukee famous\u2014I
  think I know where I CAN go to toast the old man. Except I can't, because of the
  old lady.\r\n\r\nSo, fellow travelers, while you're at the Con (and, believe you
  me, the name alone and its possibilities really intrigue me), if you have a chance\u2014and
  a strong constitution\u2014hoist a Schlitz and toast my Pop. His name is Jim, but
  \u201CL\u2019chaim!\u201D will do just fine.\r\n\r\nAnd, if you can't pronounce
  either, do that dippy Brit thing and say \u201CCheers!\u201D\r\n\r\nCheers."

    thanks for sharing the sentiment, and thereby, the love. All I got right now is
    iced tea, but the next sip is a toast to all Armenians, past and present, but
    especially past. If you know what I mean, which\u2014I am supremely confident\u2014you,
    of all people, do."

    it won't be beer because I gave up drinking it when I realised it was just bread
    in liquid form.

    I would choose a bit more wisely. Or not. Depending on your point of view and/or
    religious affiliation. Me? I was raised Catholic, and have two German grandparents,
    one Greek, and one Irish, so you know that I am genetically predisposed to the
    liquid variety.\r\n\r\nBesides, toss in a little butter and jam, and who can tell
    the difference\u2026at least, after a few \u201Cslices\u201D\u2026if you catch

    Staff of Agriculture with which the formerly free nomads, hunters and gatherers
    are beaten into civilisation. I hold no truck with them, in solid or liquid form.
