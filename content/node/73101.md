body: "This is most likely some form of Helvetica, but i can't seem to find any information
  on it. It looks more or less like a cross between Helvetica Neue + Railway Alphabet
  + Akzidenz Grotesk.. I know it was used quite extensively across the Norwegian railway
  network in the 80's, and i can recall seeing it in print in magazines from the same
  decade.\r\n\r\nMost people would probably pass it for a regular Helvetica cut, but
  i know it isn't (just have a look at the lower case 'a' and 's').. I've seen numbering
  as well, though i can't find any examples; all i know is that the numbers look even
  more like Akzidenz, though not quite..\r\n\r\nI reckon it looks perfect for signage,
  so I would really like to know if it exists in digital form. Any help would be appreciated
  :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    is it Triumvirate, which was Compugraphic's knock-off of Helvetica."

    just a modified Helvetica?\r\nStrange that the a and c have angular terminals,
    the s horizontal."

  body: I think that the second sample has wider characters and the 'o' looks rounder,
    do you not think?

  body: intricate googling :) searched for 'nsb' (railway company), 'helvetica' and
    'myriad' (current corporate font of the company), and found an old forum discussing
    previous fonts used by nsb..
