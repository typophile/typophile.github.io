  to check some kernings. \r\nBut even when I fix the kern, update the kerning feature.
  \r\nThen I generate the file (should I check Binnary or Compiled?)\r\nThe issue
  is stills there. The kern problem still remains the same.\r\n\r\nPlease help me."

    errors in them too so I'm wondering how relevant/critical these errors are? I
    understand the script was made for Adobe, so not all of the checks are relevant
    to others.\r\n\r\n_____________________\r\n<a href=\"http://www.dinariraqi.com/\">Iraqi
