  body: "I did a bunch of searching for school scripts and other handwriting. The
    most similar ones I found were Monotype's [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/school-script/|School
    Script]] and [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/aviation/tenison/|Tension]] by Nicholas
    Garner. The latter would need to be bolded to look closer, but many of the letterforms
    seemed close, although better formed than your sample.\r\n\r\nDafont was not much
    help. This font connects rather well, and I suspect it is a commercial font from
    a small independent source.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
