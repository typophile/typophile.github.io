  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">The fonts I create are display or poster fonts. I've worked mostly in the sign and screen print industry, so these are what I mostly use. My question, is there any reason to include document and math glyphs (such as mu, section, paragraph, etc.) in a font that no sane person would use on text applications? For signs, some of the math glyphs like the plus or minus glyph are necessary for acreages and legal descriptions. The other's seem pointless. I usually use those places for alternate characters and symbols. Would this, in theory, reduce the marketability of a font.

		<div class="commentbody">I don't think one can determine how one's fonts will be used. Or misused.
Typographers can be quite ingenious, if not downright perverse.

For instance, I have seen the Section symbol rotated through 90 degrees and used as a poster ornament.

The only area of discretion I would admit to typefounders in departing from standard encodings is to omit certain obsolete or obscure characters, such as Greenlandic k.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">As for whether or not there is a reason to making such symbols in the font, I think that any character used in text could potentially be used in a display setting. Coming this summer: Paragraph 14, a legal drama (against the background of a huge, light-brown gavel: in black, the numerals '1' and '4' beside a chilling pilcrow). On March 15, the Statistics Society will be presenting a talk on population means (against a dark, business blue, taking up most of the poster space: a prominent mu).

As for the marketability, I have no idea.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I dropped the extra math characters from Mac Roman or Win 1252 from my fonts because anyone setting that stuff <em>should</em> use a typeface meant for setting math. I do leave in section because that one gets use in legal advertising. I don’t waste effort on the generic currency symbol as it is only used by financial publications which do not use retail fonts. But I do draw pilcrows and daggers because I enjoy drawing them. A good baseline for these is H&FJ’s Latin-X encoding: if they can sell that many fonts without those characters then it’s pretty clear that nobody is complaining.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I used to leave out the never-gonna-get-used-anyway-math symbols (NGGUAMS) in display fonts. But I've had so many requests to fill in sets to please corporate clients that a couple of years ago I started adding them as a rule.

Videogame companies very commonly require NGGUAMS. I don't know what it's like these days but when I used to make games, Sony would reject fonts that didn't have NGGUAMS. It didn't matter that they would never be used in-game, that was their policy. Sony will not listen to reason. My fonts tend to be used in videogames often so it's NGGUAMS all around.

You're mistaken: all of our fonts have pilcrows, daggers, etc. Check out the character sets on our site, if you're interested; they're all there.

		<div class="commentbody">We do the same, Chris. I have a hard time imagining who really wants to use the paragraph mark in [[http://www.typography.com/testDriver/index.php?mode=characters&productLineID=100014|Knox]], for example, but you never know. Honestly the reason we include these things is that it's impossible to draw the line between what's useful and what's not: the slash? backslash? plusminus? asciitilde?

James, Latin-X is a spec for accented letters, and has nothing to do with analphabetic characters.</div>

Many of the younger readers of this forum, who grew up with the Internet as normal and expected, don't recall the earlier years that the @ sign had very limited use. I remember as a young man that the @ sign seemed odd to be included on a typewriter keyboard. Today, everybody uses it but not for its original purpose ;-)

<<<
"The symbol was included on the keyboard of 1885 American Underwood, the first typewriter, and remained largely obscure until Raymond Tomlinson, an American programmer, used it in 1971 as the natural division within the first e-mail message sent."--Wikipedia</div>
