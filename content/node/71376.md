  for something similar or even perhaps the idential font. It derived from the website
  www.garancedore.fr . I believed it might be a handwritten font but if anyone knows
  if this is an actual font or have any suggestions on anything similar, that would
  be great!\r\n\r\nThanks for the help in advance!"
