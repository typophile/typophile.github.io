  your help again. I need to redraw several logos in vectors so that they can be used
  for Print. But instead of redrawing all the fonts, I thought it best to just ask
  the Typophiles which fonts these are. I recognize most of them, but I can't find
  their names of the top of my head.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/logoscompo_5621.jpg]"

  body: "#4 is <a href=\"http://www.typography.net/type/font/bliss#\">Bliss</a>\r\n#2
    could be Helvetica, Arial, Akzidenz Grotesk\u2026 Too small for me. \r\n#3 looks
    like Papyrus, which is not. \r\n#1 the Sans looks like Futura"

    Sans</a> than Papysus, although I''m not sure about the "e".'

  body: "#3 is indeed Tempus Sans ITC. That was one of those I recognized but couldn't
    put my finger on. Thanks!\r\n\r\nThe font for Eureka is one I need to find. The
    other ones I think I can manage, but that one, I recognize it, but wouldn't have
    a clue were to begin looking."
