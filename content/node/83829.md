  body: "Of the four fonts used in the latest comparisons, only the Droid Serif seems
    to have been well hinted. I'd like to seem more comparisons with carefully manually
    hinted fonts. I don't like the greying of the smaller text sizes, although I recognise
    that for a lot of fonts it will be more desirable than higher density but more
    distorted shapes. [We used to do the same thing with gasp table settings in (semi-)autohinted
    fonts, applying greyscale antialiasing across all sizes if the client didn't want
    to pay for manual hinting. We made a lot of Arabic fonts that way.]\r\n\r\nI'd
    also really like to see some examples of ttfautohint applied to non-European scripts.
    How does it do with Japanese? Arabic? Devanagari? Sinhalese?"

  body: "good points :)\r\n\r\nIt's difficult to get hold of freely available fonts
    that have been manually hinted to the highest level - hence the need for a tool
    that comes at least close. I originally chose the Ubuntu Font as i know Dalton
    Maag documented it's hinting process, <a href=\"http://design.canonical.com/2010/11/of-hinting-and-tables/\">see
    here</a>, so for the sake of comparison, it seemed to me a pretty good real-world
    choice. Personally i don't have commercial fonts and i won't test the screen-optimized
    Windows system fonts.\r\n\r\nThe other angle to all this, as i see it at least,
    is that ttfautohint is not an attempt to emulate manual hinting or be a substutute
    for it, though it's allways tempting to compare :)  ttfautohint is really a tool
    to quickly create truetype instructions in fonts that are to be rendered on Windows
    machine from web based font servers. I guess the mark of whether ttfautohint instructed
    fonts are hinted well enough is whether web designers and web users accept the
    way they render on Windows OS screens.\r\n\r\n-vern\r\n\r\n"

    hinted fonts is to be able to determine exactly what sort of differences we might
    expect between ttfautohint results and deliberate decision making by an experienced
    hinter. I'm not interested in saying that one is better or worse than the other,
    especially not in a general sense independent of particular designs and intended
    purposes, but in getting a better understanding of what ttfautohint does in given
    situations compared to what I or someone else might do.\r\n\r\nMy interest in
    seeing examples of non-Latin results of ttfautohint is due to many years of having
    witnessed technological breakthroughs in font rendering that were not adequately
    tested beyond the Latin script. My take on all technology is that one should seek
    out the use cases that will provide the greatest challenge to the approach implemented
    in the technology."

    your wealth of knowledge.\r\nOne thing i'm noticing in my screen tests with XP
    and Win7 is the varied performance of manually hinted fonts under standard windows
    greyscale smoothing and to a lesser extent under cleartype. I think i understand
    why you say the Droid font is the only well hinted font in my tests, but can you
    clarify that a bit more?\r\n\r\nTo me the mark of 'well hinted' is the fact that
    the appearance of Droid Serif stays fairly constant between cleartype and greyscale,
    compared to e.g. the Ubuntu Font. Also with Droid Serif, whilst staying clear
    and legible at all ppm sizes, there are no dramatic changes in e.g. relative stem
    widths going from one ppm size to the next. In the Ubuntu Font stem widths change
    noticeably below certain ppms. Would these be fair criteria for the nitty gritty
    of defining 'well hinted'?\r\n\r\nmany thanks\r\n"

    thread, but in response to your query re. my comment on the hinting quality of
    your initial test fonts, let me clarify:\r\n\r\nI think the manually hinted Droid
    Serif looks best of the specimens (excepting in the smallest three sizes, which
    I'm assuming are below the sizes spec'd for hinting), and best in both GDI and
    DWrite rendering. But it was misleading for me to describe this quality in terms
    of 'well hinted' relative to the other test fonts, because a significant factor
    in this quality in addition to hinting is probably in the nature of the outlines
    and spacing, which enable Droid Serif to perform better, especially under DWrite,
    than the other fonts, including the well-hinted Ubuntu font, at the text sizes:
    there is less fuzzing of vertical stems in Droid Serif, and better stroke density."

  body: Mike, what we typically did when 'auto-hinting' fonts for greyscale was to
    apply x stem hints but still set the gasp table to apply smoothing at all sizes.
    The stem hints improved the density of the vertical strokes, especially in lighter
    types. Yes, this can introduce spacing issues, but those are relatively easy to
    deal with, and the gain in stroke density and hence text contrast is worth it.

    of autohinting results for an all-caps fonts I am working on at the moment (note
    that this will not, eventually, be autohinted; these are just tests for this thread).
    Although it is an all-caps design it is not intended for display work: its for
    publishing the diplomatics of Byzantine lead seals. I don't consider the XP rendering
    acceptable, but I do think the addition of x direction hints provides for better
    stroke consistency at some key reading sizes. As you see, there are spacing problems
    for some glyphs and for most at the smallest size, but I'm not sure I prefer the
    trade-off with fuzzier stems in the version without x-hints.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AR-GSxy_3762.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AR-GSy_5576.png]\r\n\r\nAnd

    turned on.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AR-CT_6743.png]\r\n\r\nMuch
    depends, I think you'll agree, on the individual typeface design: how light/heavy
    it is and how it has been spaced.\r\n\r\n[It would be nice if the gasp table enabled
    one to apply or not apply x and y instructions independently. Looking at those
    screenshots, there are sizes at which I think the version with x hints is working
    better and sizes at which that with only y hints is working better.]"

    more blurry stems, but you do gain more consistent spacing and typographic color
    with y only. Understanding that tradeoff, and then factoring in the work that

    top unhinted greyscale, bottom y-hinting only. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*We were never
    happy with the contrast we could achieve with greyscale and hinting at the lower

    GASP, is one approach, for webfonts on XP systems.\r\n\r\nIf the outlines are
    lighter as in the sans examples above, then reducing the stems to one pixel, which
    is more or less the same as hinting for black and white, will necessitate hinting
    to fix spacing problems, and also to fix the balance in color between the straight
    stems and the rounds, and diagonals. Also as a side note, the Italic sans above,

    hours, for what kind of hinting? I'm not certain that's what I'd spend, even on
    an aliased font. Antialiased hinting takes less time per glyph and fewer glyphs
    need the kind of details to be hinted versus aliased hinting. 40 seems more like
    a reasonable estimate for hinting 79-80 antialiased glyphs without too much fuss
    beyond that count on adjacentcy issues. This also assumes some help from one or
    another of the auto hinters.\r\n\r\nOn the bright side, if you are spending 80
    hours on any kind of hinting, you are getting more experience. And assuming that
    60 of those 80 are getting you more experience than you need, then the next job
    will come to an early conclusion, perhaps."
