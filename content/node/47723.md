  body: autumnlind, in my Opinion, <a href="http://www.linotype.com/497/goudyoldstyle-family.html">Goudy
    Old Style</a> is a great non-script font for a wedding invitation. At least if
    you are going for a classic look. Especially the italic with its minimal slope
    can very much survive on its own for the text body of your invitation and isn't
    confined to be used as an emphasizing supplement of the roman.
