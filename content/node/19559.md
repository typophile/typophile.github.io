  Demi is what I need. Another missing font. I don't understand why so many people
  submit art with no fonts, but I guess people forget... \r\nIf anyone can tell me
  where I can find it, I would appreciate it."

    I just bought one that's for 1-5 users.\r\n\r\nAnd - tell me if I'm wrong - if
    the client did purchase the font for that job, can't they send it to their designer?
    I had to sign something recently promising to delete a font from my system after
    I completed the job."

    freelance designers than for the in-house designers?

  body: "Yeah. I know. Trust me, I hate EULAs. This is one of the many flaws in a
    EULA. Some foundries are changing with the times, some won't. Some foundries have
    special clauses which allow for copies to go to service bureaus, some don't. \r\n\r\nHouse
    allows embedding for the service bureau. Quote: \"Our base license does, however,
    allow you to embed fonts in a .pdf to be sent to a service bureau or printer.\"
    \r\n\r\nI'd suggest getting the designer to get a PDF made. "

    body: "O.k. Thank you all. We do ask all the customers to outline types, but because
      we have so many distributors and reps for our company we always receive things
      with font problems.  And we have to manually trap jobs, so we do not use pdfs
      to print.\r\nHere is my question: When I freelance and design catalogs and stuff,
      all printers ask fonts used, and I had no idea that they have to actually buy
      fonts used in some cases. Does this mean all the printers and service bureaus
      who wanted fonts with art (many people) might not have been right?"

  body: Yep. Unfortunately. Very few foundries have any sort of clause which allows
    for giving the actual fonts to the service bureau. More and more, however, foundries
    are allowing embedding (mostly uneditable however) for service bureau.

  body: I'm sorry but this just begs piracy. If the client has to buy 3 separate licenses,
    one for themselves, one for their designer (moi) and one for the service bureau,
    how am I ever going to get them to pony up for a new font? The ultimate loser
    is the foundry, or the type designer, whose fonts are not getting purchased because
    of these ridiculous EULAs.

    some of whom are willing to pay for new fonts (altho I've just been purchasing
    single licenses) and some not.

    foundries \"should\" do, but I'm not sure I understand the logic here. If the
    foundry did not require separate licensing, they wouldn't be seeing any money
    that way, either. How would not requiring people to license the font get more
    money for the type foundry?\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "I just think if the font is being used for a single job it's a lot to ask
    someone to pay for it three times. I will never get a client to do that (hard
    enough to get them to buy it once), so then, the foundry loses out on the sale.
    If the foundries were a little more flexible with their licenses they'd get more
    business from me. That said I have been blithely giving fonts to printers for
    years now without additional purchase of license, since I didn't know better.\r\n\r\nI'd
    suggest rather than separate licenses for different locations perhaps it should
    be on a per job basis. But since I rarely actually read the EULAs that may already
    be the case. Pardon my ignorance."
