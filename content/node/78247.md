  rant about the logo emblazoned across the front of Egnater guitar amplifiers. The
  website is a site about guitar gear, like amps and effects and stuff.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.thegearpage.net/board/showthread.php?t=807344|Terrible
  mistake by Egnater.]]\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyway, here is the logo that they are complaining
  about, the great big scripty \"Egnater\":\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/RenegadeHeadCP_4528.jpg]\r\n\r\n$.50
  to the person who points out the bigger issue with the design :p"

    that with Brush Script, like in the original forum discussion? Spring has much
    more life to it, that lower case g in particular.\r\n\r\nIn fact, these lower
    case g's look pretty ugly to me.\r\n\r\nBrush Script Std Medium\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/g_3680.png]\r\n\r\nBrush

    a bit of stroke I don\u2019t see anything wrong with the logo\u2026 (maybe I need
    better glasses)."
