body: "I am working on the logo redesign of E&P Federal Credit Union and would like
  some input on what I have so far. For a little background, E&P has been the federal
  credit union for employees of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (hence E&P) but
  they are looking for a brand new look as their clientele demographic and business
  model shifts. Their main group of members now come from both a few local colleges
  and employees of the environmental protection agency. They are also planning to
  shut down many branches and become more of a virtual financial institution, where
  almost all banking services would occur through a new website.\r\n\r\nWhat they
  want to say with their new look:\r\n\u2022 Professional and trusted\r\n\u2022 Helping
  the environment (by going all virtual)\r\n\u2022 Friendly/personal\r\n\u2022 Secure\r\n\u2022
  approachable to Generation Y\r\n\u2022 Change name from E&P (acronym for Engraving
  and Printing) to EP (acronym for absolutely nothing)\r\n\u2026you get the idea,
  the same thing every financial institution wants to be viewed as\r\n\r\nHere are
  the general concepts for the three logos you see below:\r\n\r\nFirst image is their
  current logo.\r\n\r\n<strong>LOGO 1</strong>\r\n\u2022 Reinvention of the infinity
  symbol to incorporate the letters EP\r\n\u2022 Interlocking letters are secure yet
  kinetic\u2026like your money should be\r\n\u2022 Rounded letters are friendly\r\n\r\n<strong>LOGO2</strong>\r\n\u2022
  Arrow pointing up\u2026towards the future and showing positive growth\r\n\u2022
  Also feels like a protective roof\r\n\u2022 again, round and bold shapes feel friendly\r\n\r\n<strong>LOGO
  3</strong>\r\n\u2022 This is a leaf...I know, cheesy but I'm thinking money tree
  and the environment both connect to \"leaf\"\r\n\r\nAny conversation about this
  work would be helpful and appreciated.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/original_3443.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/eplogo_6337.jpg]"

  body: "Please, not another leaf logo! ;-)\r\n\r\nI would work on the first one.
    Make it completely b&w (no gradients for the moment), try a spurless p, experiment
    different solutions for the wordmark (maybe the three words vertically stacked)."

  body: "#1. i like infinity idea, but not feeling how the e connects to the p. it
    feels/looks awkward. wonder if you reversed the connection to e's stem to the
    p's bowl. might flow better, maybe?\r\n\r\n#2. has 'new' feel to it. arrow makes
    things feel cluttered. either use the arrow or the EP. might look nice if you
    enlarge/stack the federal credit union and utilize the arrow. \r\n\r\n#3. no.\r\n"

  body: "#1 The infinity comes with the \"stuck in the loop\" interpretation. The
    execution looks quite a bit like a map on a road. And above all the symbol looks
    sort of perched on a stick and about to fall over, because the left part is heavier.\r\n\r\n#2
    That's one mighty funky P... the shape of its bowl steals the show, I just can't
    focus on anything else in that version.\r\n\r\n#3 If the leaf is gone, I think
    this one has the most potential.\r\n\r\nHave you played with the uppercase E and
    P for the symbol? The lowecase p's descender is what might be making things hard..."

  body: "#1 - I like the general direction but the connection between two letters
    bothers me a little, although I'm not sure why; don't care for \"federal credit
    union\" being in all caps\r\n\r\n#2 - I kinda like it; I agree with apankrat that
    the \"p\" shape is a little distracting; again I don't care for the all caps although
    split into 2 lines it doesn't bother me as much\r\n\r\n#3 - I'd vote no on the
    big leaf; it seems a bit of a stretch for a credit union; the \"ep\" itself is
    nice and I like the lower case \"credit union\""

  body: I agree with the above. I am liking 1, but more work on it being more fluent
    and flowing. Too much contrast between straight and curve and the contrast is
    sudden.

  body: I'm glad to be hearing some positive feedback about the first idea as it is
    my favorite concept of the bunch. I do agree with most comments here that there
    seems to be something off with the balance and connection of the E and P in this
    logo. Do you guys think the following image is an improvement in this regard?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/picture_4978.jpg]

  body: "It's a shame they don't want to play up their roots. Here you have a credit
    union, an organization that handles peoples money, established for the benefit
    of <em>the people who actually make the money!</em> That background should inspire
    trust, even as they target an expanded membership base.\r\n\r\nThere are incredible
    design possibilities that could be built from that concept, but that doesn't appear
    to be along the lines of what you're tasked with.\r\n\r\nI, too, see a wind-up
    key in your latest design, as well as a scatological reference. Kind of hard to
    avoid that when you have two adjacent round forms with a descender between them."
