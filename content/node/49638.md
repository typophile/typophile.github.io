body: I'm pretty much a newbie in typography and so can anyone explain to me why Avant
  Garde has two variations of the uppercase A? One looks like the standard A (which
  I have) and the other one has an asymmetrical leg on either side (which I want).
  Is there another variant of Avant Garde I may not be aware of?

    What you need is either ITC Avant Garde Pro (which has the entire library of Avant
    Garde characters) or the Avant Garde Alternates set.\r\n\r\npenn"

    it was designed by Herb Lubalin for the magazine <em>Avant Garde</em>.\r\n\r\nI
    remember hearing that Lubalin didn't want the font released, especially the alternatives
    because most people will butcher the execution. He was spot on."
