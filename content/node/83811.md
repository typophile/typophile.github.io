  currently uses Dobra to great effect on headers, standfirsts etc. Trade Gothic is
  also used throughout. Body face is Palatino which reads OK but would be nice to
  update - can anyone suggest a more contemporary face that will pair well with Dobra
  and Trade but retain the legibility of Palatino (bearing in mind the business audience)?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    Or at least Aldus."
