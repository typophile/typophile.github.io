body: "\x7FSomething I've been thinking about the past few days and figured would
  spark an interesting discussion.\r\n\r\nWhat features / styles / etc are most important
  in a font family to you?  Eg, list first the ones you absolutely must have, followed
  by ones that you would have to think twice about buying if not present, to ones
  that are really nice and useful, then ones that you think are nice but probably
  won't use and lastly ones you find quite useless (edit: or add your own category
  of use-full/less-ness)\r\n\r\nSo out of this in-no-particular-order list, which
  features are most important?  Least important?  What other features do you find
  particular useful/worthless?  In principle this question is more about text faces
  than display faces.<!--break-->\r\n<ul><li>italic</li><li>reverse italic</li><li>upright
  italic</li><li>&gt;1 italic angle</li>\r\n<li>bold</li>\r\n<li>&gt;2 weights (light
  demi extra)</li><li>reverse italic</li><li>small caps</li><li>multiple scripts (if
  so which)</li><li>extra ligatures</li><li>double struck</li><li>outline/contour</li><li>hinting</li><li>arrows</li><li>dingbats</li><li>math
  symbols</li><li>other symbols</li><li>super-/subscript numbers</li><li>super/sub-script
  letters</li><li>script-script numbers/letters</li><li>language-specific glyphs</li></ul>\r\nEdit:
  some other potential categories to fill in\r\n<ul><li>bold italic</li><li>caption/text/display
  variants</li><li>serif/sans in same family</li></ul>\r\n\r\nAlso, to which extent
  should any of these glyphs (scripts / small caps) be spread out across the weights
  and inclines?"

  body: "By \">1 italic angle\" do you mean (1) there is a font with an italic angle,
    and it is greater than one, or (2) there are multiple italic fonts, with different
    angles? Which ligatures do you consider basic, that \"extra ligatures\" are an
    addition to? By \"hinting\" do you mean that the alternative is an unhinted font?
    What the heck are \"script-script numbers/letters\"?\r\n\r\nThat aside, here is
    a first take at some answers, from my personal POV as an end user of type, rather
    than as a type designer (nor in terms of Adobe's priorities):\r\n\r\nFeatures
    should be present in all weight and inclines unless they really make no sense
    in that font.\r\n\r\nMust have:\r\n- italic\r\n- bold\r\n- hinting\r\n\r\nUnlikely
    to buy without:\r\n- small caps\r\n\r\nReally nice, useful:\r\n- >2 weights\r\n-
    extra ligatures\r\n- super/subscript numbers\r\n- super/subscript letters\r\n\r\nNice
    but won't use much:\r\n- upright italic\r\n- arrows\r\n- dingbats\r\n- math symbols\r\n-
    other symbols\r\n- multiple scripts\r\n\r\nNot much use to me personally:\r\n-
    language-specific glyphs\r\n\r\nJust plain silly:\r\n- reverse italic\r\n- double
    struck\r\n\r\n"

    italic angle I meant having two or more distinct angles (say, 10 and 20\xBA).
    \ Basic ligatures would be the ones that more easily slide into the background
    like fi that correct for potential collisions etc, with the \"extra\" ones being
    of the more flashy ct/it/st style.  script-script would be a superscript to a
    superscript optimized form (some of the things I threw in the list like script-script,
    reverse italic and such I knew had very specific uses but I figured I'd open the
    field up as wide as I could).\r\n\r\nAnd re hinting, by including hinting I mean
    a designer going beyond what any font program's autohint would provide.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl

  body: "Oddly enough, the most important feature for me is that it be relatively
    easy to obtain permission to modify the font. Modifications I'll make would be
    (1) to add characters, esp. easy-to-create ones such as glyphs with diacriticals,
    extra ligatures, true-cut superiors, etc., and (2) to add or modify features,
    usually just to include the extra characters just made up -- such as \"extra\"
    (but functional) ligatures (fb, fk, fh, f-with-accented vowels, etc.), angle brackets
    to swap out the greater & less symbol when the text includes < http >, and on
    & on.\r\n\r\nI don't think it is possible for the font designer to include everything
    that will come up, and a text interior designer often doesn't take into account
    what a font has before specifying it. The comp gets stuck with setting the text,
    and it is just easier to make the changes in the font than to make them in the
    file.\r\n\r\nMost text designers I know (which includes me) don't purchase a font
    because of it's features, we select it because we like it, or sometimes just because
    it fills a need. We might, with reluctance, rule it out because it lacks needed
    features or characters. Big things that might rule out a purchase (rather than
    a use for a particular title), include the lack of an italic, roman small caps,
    and both old-style and lining numbers. Most of the many other things needed can
    be filled out by someone who has only workman-like skill.  "

  body: "I do often choose to add fonts to our type library based on the features
    they may include. That\u2019s because I\u2019m lazier than Charles and have never
    learned any of the font editing tools. So since modification is not an option
    for me, I must find types that have what I want. I have rejected some very nice
    faces because the font set lacked certain features.\r\n\r\nSo my basic features
    list will include roman and italic small caps; true-drawn superior figures; a
    full range of f ligs (given all the work we do about Norway, I really need that
    fj lig for fjords); and good set of made fractions, along with all the elements
    to create piece fractions that match the made ones.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want a
    bold, but I do want a medium, or a semibold or demibold, depending on what it
    is called and its color. I\u2019d like the features listed above to be present
    in the medium also.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m drawn toward the idea of a matching sans,
    but it is not of utter importance.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve never been interested in this
    critter known as the \u201Ccaption\u201D variant. I seem to do OK with italic
    or sans for captions. Old-school, I guess.\r\n\r\nTrue-drawn superior letters
    will be nice also.\r\n\r\nGiven the nature of the work I have done, do now, and
    will likely do in the future, that about fills my needs.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting
    that this topic comes up just a few days after a topic has been started about
    type specimens: http://typophile.com/node/52442. It is a well-made specimen that
    allows us to see just what lives inside a font, and thus whether or not we should
    get a license for that font.\r\n\r\npowers\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Here are my thoughts, based on the sort of books I'm used to working on.\r\n\r\nEssential
    (I won't ordinarily pick a text face without them):\r\n- italic\r\n- small caps\r\n-
    basic math symbols (the ones in MacRoman at minimum)\r\n- semibold, or a bold
    that isn't too heavy\r\n\r\nVery important (a text face with them is much more
    likely to be considered):\r\n- multiple scripts (Polytonic Greek, Cyrillic): I
    regularly need polytonic Greek for the books I set; Cyrillic I don't really use
    as much as Hebrew or Arabic, but Greek and Cyrillic are different in that their
    designs typically have enough relation to the Latin that the visual dissonance
    when they aren't quite coordinated is unpleasant\r\n- hinting\r\n- super-/subscript
    numerals\r\n- language-specific glyphs: either lots of them or, as Charles suggests,
    easy permission to modify the font\r\n- multiple cuts (e.g. caption/text/display):
    most of the things I set have footnotes, and a page really does look better if
    the chapter head, the text, and the footnotes are not all generated from the same
    outlines\r\n- extra ligatures: it depends on the meaning of \"extra\"; I'm assuming
    you mean anything beyond f_i and f_l\r\n\r\nNice and useful (will be considered
    but probably not the deciding factor):\r\n- super-/subscript letters\r\n- >2 weights\r\n-
    arrows\r\n- additional math symbols and other symbols\r\n\r\nThe rest may be nice
    but not terribly useful to me; the only ones I would pick out as being really
    useless for me are reverse italic and upright italic. The multiple cuts need to
    be available for all the scripts; I've had Greek show up everywhere from footnotes
    to chapter heads. I can live without a regular-italic distinction for Greek, if
    the regular is fairly calligraphic."

    in this context. \r\n\r\nThe earlier one is the sort of alternative italic, like
    the one that accompanies the digital version of Fairfield (not part of the original
    design, BTW). This approach and nomenclature is patterned after what Matthew Carter
    did for some custom work for <cite>National Geographic,</cite> where he created
    a more open, simplified italic for their use in captions, and thus called \"Caption.\"
    (This is many years back; not currently employed.)\r\n\r\nThe other variant is
    the small optical size that Adobe calls \"caption\" in its typical suite of optical
    variations. This is what you're referring to, I presume.\r\n\r\nI don't know which

    this (I didn't see the specimen thread until just now).   After seeing what people
    wanted from a licensing perspective I figured I'd be interesting to see what people
    wanted from a design perspective.  Charles makes a good point that a font needs
    to be user-editable, and while that works well if you need a letter or two that's
    not been doing or you need to make a customized letter that's not otherwise expected
    or something, I don't think most (any) people would take the default Times they
    get on their Mac and rework it to add in a full range of small caps and sub/superscript
    letters... that could be a week or two of work which ultimately makes it cheaper
    to just get a font that already has it.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea
