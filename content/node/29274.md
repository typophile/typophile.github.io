  body: "I can't speak for anyone else but I find it difficult to crit it without
    being able to see the whole image. However I think you have too much going on
    in the globe I would look for more contrast between landmass and ocean. I think
    you also need to work on the vertically distorted type, especially on the crossbars
    and some of the black areas (for example, the deep crotch of the V). Now you have
    distorted it you can use it as a template to draw up the lettering, CHANGE, with
    plenty of horizontal features, is forming a curve which is beginning to work;
    MASSIVE, on the other hand, doesn't have those horizontal features the large areas
    of black in the M, base of the S's and V are drawing attention away from the other
    characters. Also look at using an en dash to separate the dates and increasing
    the point size of the url so you don't have to track it out.\r\nTim"

    edited your image as per technical guidelines and deleted a couple duplicate posts.
    i'd recommend if you're new to the site reading the <a href=\"readme\">Read Me</a>."

    did you use a different font for this than you did for the rest of the text?\r\n\r\nOtherwise,
    I think the design is quite strong. I do agree with Tim's comments though.\r\n\r\n

    are few things I don't get (but maybe it's me):\r\n1) weren't you supposed to
    use text only? So why the globe?\r\n2) I read the massive change website and I
    know it's not your fault but I don't understand what their plan is. I mean it
    seems all so vague... "

  body: "there are some parts where the little 'fill' characters don't meet up with
    the borders of the globe. also i might make them a less intense shade, maybe a
    gray, and then make them more dense... the problem is they're too busy. i know
    any more dense and you might not be able to recognize that they're characters...
    but as it is now... you get the idea.\r\n\r\ncompositionally it works though.
    the idea of 'massive' comes across strongly."

  body: "I cleaned up the fill characters, and added the  en dash to the date. I also
    decided to change the color from a loud bold red to a shocking green. To answer
    lore's questions, we are allowed to draw geometrical shapes, in my case, i used
    it as an outline for the globe. As for massive change, the best way i could summerize
    their plan is to create a greater awareness of the power of design. To get back
    on ycole's comment on making the fill characters a gray, i have done it, and i
    was not pleased on how it looked. It looked dull and did not blend(into massive
    change) as well as black text would. Thank you guys from your comments and suggestions.
    Feel free to keep them coming. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/massivechangeteal_5383.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/massivechangepeagreen_6260.jpg]"

  body: "An improvement on the Massive Change lettering, although you still need to
    work on the depth of the horizontals of H & A and maybe open up the counter openings
    on C & G. You could shift the en-dash up a touch to centre on the uppercase characters
    and kern the numerals 16 and 31 closer.\r\nTim"
