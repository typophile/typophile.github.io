  body: I may have already posted these. They are photos taken at Typecon 2004 at
    the Window Lettering workship with John Downer and Leonard Otillio. The results
    are amazing. I don&#39;t know if he would use the same method described in the
    Times article for a larger window. Here he is silk screening the black, screening
    a bevel varnish, applying the leaf, backing with paint, and rubbing out the extra
    leaf. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.aquatoad.com/typecon/IMG_6127.JPG" target="_blank">http://www.aquatoad.com/typecon/IMG_6127.JPG</a>

  body: So nobody minds that Pagane is leaning heavily on Mantinia there &#40;right?&#41;
    with not a hint of credit to the font? And no size/weight compensation either.

  body: Yes. A heavy Mantinia lean. Serifs seem less delicate. Maybe the client specifically
    chose that typeface. Traditionally, I wonder, do lettering artists allow their
    customers/clients to choose a typeface to work with, or would they present them
    with some specimen of their own original designs?
