    old version of the logo and is definitely custom lettering. The three a's are
    different. So are the two l's and r's. Hallmark were traditionally a good employer
    for lettering artists.\r\n\r\nEven more recent versions of the logo don't seem
    to have used fonts. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Hallmark_3903.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/H02_3733.jpg]"
