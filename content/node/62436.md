  and which conveys qualities of: fast moving, collaborative, trustworthy.\r\n\r\nI'm
  currently using Myriad Semibold. My first reason is that its half way between a
  sans and a serif, which might come across as being collaborative. Secondly, its
  not heavy enough to convey slowness.\r\n\r\nMy second request is for a complimentary
  serif font that can make short work of a long boring block of text. For this job,
  I am currently using Lucida Fax.\r\n\r\nPlease advise, and thank you so much! :)"

    happy with Myriad Semibold because it's not heavy enough to convey slowness.\r\n\r\nAnd
    are we talking about a different Myriad? How is it \"half way between a sans and
    a serif\"?\r\n\r\nMinion is the classic serif pairing for Myriad. Have you tried
    that?\r\n"

  body: "Hi Glen,\r\nSounds interesting. The \"collaborative\" part is tricky. Maybe
    a semiserif? Something with open forms, preferably? \r\nFor the record, Myriad
    doesn't strike me as \"fast moving\" at all, more as friendly, clean and comfy.
    And not as \"halfway between sans and serif\" either (that's where a semiserif
    would be, or maybe a flared/stressed sans if you like that stuff).\r\n\r\nMaybe
    this is too much to ask, but could you maybe post a snap of the layout as it stands
    now? I'm having trouble visualizing the two fonts and what kind of jobs they need
    to do (text length, sizes, arrangement)."

  body: "Maybe my words are unclear. I like Myriad Semibold because it is not heavy
    enough to convey slowness. At the same time, I fear that the Myriad family might
    be too familiar to convey character?\r\n\r\nHeh. Myriad is clearly not a serif,
    but I meant to suggest that its proportions might help eyes scan whole lines -
    like a serif. Maybe I am being too optimistic? :)\r\n\r\nI don't have Minion!
    *faint* Instead, I have reduced my installed fonts to three other possibles. I
    think each is bit sugary compared to Minion and the free one failed at small sizes.\r\n\r\nI'm
    a self confessed novice. Do any expert typographer's feel they can outdo these
    proposals? :)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/companion_4519.png]\r\n\r\nIs
    there a good font like Roman Serif? The copy I found on a free site displays artefacts."

  body: "Thanks altaira, I did not see your reply sooner and will get back to you
    :)\r\n\r\nEdit: Just acquired a couple of the suggested fonts. Rotis Semi Serif
    is nice for the collaborative idea. I'll try to pluck up the courage to post my
    project, but not sure yet ;)"

  body: "Somehow [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_legato_1/|Legato]]
    strikes me as fast moving (cursive*), collaborative (glyphs that purport to connect
    cognitively into boumas) and trustworthy (open counters). \r\n\r\n*I mean its
    initial impression. Of course it's anti-cursive on deeper examination, Nina :P\r\n\r\n[[http://www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/typefaces-40-areplos-book-pro|Areplos]]
    also comes to mind."
