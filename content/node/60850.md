  body: "The 's' looks a lot like DIN, so I searched various DIN versions. They are
    similar, Especially [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/parachute/pf-din-text-cond-pro/|this
    one]] from Parachute, but letters like the M and 'a', among others, would need
    to be modified. I could not find existing fonts I know of that matched these details.
    Customized DIN of some kind?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
