  (starting with the free Scheherazade, but then seeing that the problem is quite
  widespread), I'm beginning to notice that kerning for Arabic fonts is quite rare.
  (From one long listing of fonts I saw online, a handful had any kerning pairs at
  all.) So, a couple of questions...\r\n\r\n(1) Are there any typefaces that do this
  well?\r\n(2) What the kerning pairs that need adjustment? For the most part I find
  that glyphs following \u0631 (and \u0631-like glyphs) could be much, much closer.
  Also \u0648 often seems to get an unnecessarily wide berth.\r\n\r\nAnd, off-topic,
  but since I'm writing...\r\n\r\n(3) What software do people prefer for working with
  Arabic script fonts?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAdam Baker"

  body: "We try to take considerable care in kerning our Arabic fonts, including those
    we work on for other foundries. Obviously what needs attention are right-joining
    letters followed by isolated or initial letters within words. In some calligraphic
    styles, kerning across word-boundaries is also desirable where swash final forms
    dip under following words.\r\n\r\nWhat I think of as the basic kerning of Arabic
    is fairly easy to do, but gets more complicated when text contains vowels or other
    marks: then kerning can result in situations in which either the mark positions
    need to be contextually adjusted (traditional technique based on scribal practice)
    or the kerning needs to be contextually adjusted, or both. The Adobe Arabic fonts
    that we made for Adobe use a combination of both mark and kern adjustments depending
    on context.\r\n\r\nSometimes the budget for a project is such, and the expecation
    of vocalised text so limited, that we can't afford to spend much time on contextual
    adjustments. Because most Arabic text does not use vowel marks, there are seriously
    diminishing returns to the large amount of work required to define all the contextual
    adjustments. Some clients balk at the cost."

  body: "<em>(1) Are there any typefaces that do this well?</em>\r\n\r\nI write one
    with 5553 kerning pairs (and also increasing). see my post on this forum.\r\n\r\n<em>(2)
    What the kerning pairs that need adjustment?</em>\r\n\r\n1 - all of [right-joining
    characters [isolated and final]]+[dual-joining characters [initial and isolated]]\r\n2
    - all of [right-joining characters [isolated and final]]+[right-joining characters
    [isolated]]\r\n\r\nIf you want to design an Arabic font with kerning, you have
    to be careful of above marks. you can add an extra substitution for replacing
    base glyphs with their alternatives when above marks are applied.\r\nMy advice
    is not to try make pairs manually. if you want a completed and clear kerning,
    write a program to accomplish it. i write an algorithm using some artificial intelligence
    and image processing algorithms to make kern feature in form of VOLT lookup.\r\nI
    can send you the algorithm.\r\n\r\n<em>(3) What software do people prefer for
    working with Arabic script fonts?</em>\r\n\r\nI'm not a professional font designer,
    but I'm pretty sure VOLT+FontLab+Font Creator is necessary and enough for designing
    clear Arabic fonts. you could use AFDK too."

  body: Soroush, your kerning algorithm sounds very interesting, and I would like
    to take a look at it. If it seems useful, I'd also be happy to discuss paying
    your something. Please contact me at tiro[at]tiro[dot]com
