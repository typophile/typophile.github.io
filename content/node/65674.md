  to this (great) website.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for an OpenType version of Behrens Antiqua.\r\nThe
  site MyFonts.com has various formats except OpenType.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know if
  an OpenType version of Behrens Antiqua exists?\r\n\r\n(On a separate but related
  question, does anyone know a metal foundry\r\nthat still produces Behrens Antiqua
  or BehrensSchrift ?)\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n/thomas/"

  body: "Behrens Antiqua was a Klngspor type.\r\nSo it might be possible, that Schriften-Service
    Gerstenberg, the follow-up of D. Stempel in Frankfurt, Germany, still holds the
    matrizes. Its not in the current program. This means, officially its only possible
    to order 6 times 1/2 minimum. So if you would order a, lets say, 28 p (best choice
    to produce clean prints from) 1/2 minimum's weight is at about 8 kg. 1 kg = 65
    Euro. 8 x 520 Euro. 6 times 1/2 kg ... lot of money. :( - may be, its possible
    to order just 3 times 1/2 minimum... I don't know yet.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested
    you can go directly into contact:\r\nhttp://www.schriftenservice-d-stempel.de/kontakt.htm\r\n\r\nOr,
    easier,discuss it with me by email. I'm representative of the company:\r\nwww.bleisetzer.de\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nGeorg\r\n_______________________________________________\r\n\u201EIch
