  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Greetings!</p>
<p>I apologize in advance if this post is in any way inappropriate.</p>
<p>A professional organization to which I belong &ndash; the American Philosophical Association &ndash; is looking for a new logo (and associated branding items). There is an announcement on their website, and they asked members to pass it on to any &ldquo;good designers&rdquo; we might know. There are plenty of good designers here, and I thought at least a few of them might be interested.</p>
<p>The announcement and the request for the proposals can be found [[http://www.apaonline.org/APAOnline/Announcements/Announcement_Content/The_APA_is_looking_for_a_new_logo_.aspx|here]].</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>With a budget of $2,500 USD, I recommend you approach a group of students under the supervision of a professor and make a class project out of this. Profit or no, $2,500 USD is very low for the following:</p>
<p>Logos
Usage guidelines
Web design guidelines
Email templates
Banners
Favicon
Letterhead
Business cards
Thank-you card
Publications designs
Typographic guidelines
Facebook &amp; Twitter design guidelines
Brand strategy document</p>
<p>A practicing professional would probably ballpark that closer to $10–25,000.00 USD depending on the size of their operation and how much of their labour they would be willing to donate in kind.</p>
<p>To give you a sense of the cost of a quality font, let’s say I suggested you use <a href="http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/starling/">Starling</a> as your text face for all your printed materials. The font alone would cost you  $1,080 USD for a 6–10 computer license. Almost half your budget.</p>
<p>If you made a class project out of this, you could put your budget towards purchasing a high quality font(s) for your materials, and have enough left over to play for the class’ printing budget (students making colour laser prints for their presentations) and provide the selected student with a small honorarium.</p>

<p>Same thing here. Sometimes organizations have unrealistic expectations simply because they don&rsquo;t have much experience working with designers. They may have a general idea what a plumber or accountant or auto mechanic charges, but unless they work with designers frequently they may have no idea what the going rates are.</p>

Rinse, lather, repeat. Stats isn’t my strongest suit, but seriously. Do the math.

<p>I can see how it&rsquo;s tempting to clients, but what they often don&rsquo;t realize is that their concepts will be coming mostly from amateurs, students, and designers who are having trouble making a living.

<p>Keep calm. – Basically, what I was mentioning is nothing else than a kind of competition for which you may volunteer or not. It’s as witty as any crowd-sourcing approach ;-)</p>
<p>However, if I would be the client, I’d prefer the more focussed method anyway. Search for some acknowlegded designers and ask them what they could do for a certain amount of money.</p>

<p>No, it is very different from many other kinds of crowd-sourcing.</p>
<p>For example, in crowd-sourced funding, all the money contributed is useful and used. In this kind of spec work, a bunch of people all take a stab at something, and the work of all but one person is thrown away.</p>
<p>It is simply horribly inefficient, a waste of the time and effort of many people. That&rsquo;s in addition to driving down prices (which may be good or bad depending on whether you are a consumer or a producer).</p>

<p>For example, McDonalds sells a lot of hamburgers, but getting a CEO from from McDonalds-land to admit that their “food-like-substance” has virtually no nutritional value whatsoever would probably be about fruitful as convincing a room full of typographers that hinting… I think you see where I’m going with this.</p>
<p>As far as “<em>It is not a luxury item if you are trying to sell something</em>” I’m not quite sure what that means. Are we talking about the person selling the overpriced smelly-water, the advertisement for it, or the smelly-water itself?</p>

<p>Why is [design] not taken for serious?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very broad statement. Average consumers and small businesses have little contact with designers so it&rsquo;s natural that they have no idea how business is conducted or what it costs. But many corporations deal routinely with designers and know how things are done and what they cost.</p>
<p>Last week one of my corporate clients asked me to estimate a design job. I said $15,000 (which was reasonable for the job), they said fine, and I had a p.o. the next day. Simple. They deal with designers every day and know what the going rates are. But when I deal with mom-and-pop shops who aren&rsquo;t used to buying design services, it&rsquo;s a different story and I have to justify and fight for every dollar.</p>
<p>As to the question of why clients sometimes ask for spec work, I think there are a number of reasons, but one might be that they have seen or read about advertising agencies competing for work. Several agencies will each come up with ideas and make presentations in hopes of getting the account. But that&rsquo;s really an apples to oranges situation, as an ad agency might get years of work and millions of billing dollars if they win a big account. That&rsquo;s very different from a graphic designer being asked to do free work in hopes of &ldquo;winning&rdquo; a one-time, routine job.</p>

<p>APA, a mom-and-pop shop?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… the bulk of graphic design is a luxury item …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are going to make ourselves completely uncredible by such statements. If you would be right, Chris, APA would be justifiable with their spec method: “it’s trash anyway, so why not asking for two loads of it for the price of one?” – economy.
NO!
Design is shaping our world. Conducting communication. Making a sustainable environment, ease living. And, yes, to please. In m.h.o. this is anything but luxury. 
And brand or trade mark – which stoud at the beginning of this – is neither an item of luxury, on the contrary. A trade mark materializes identity, hence it has VALUE. Very high value, sometimes. It’s not a nicety you can put on as apparel or strip of like socks.</p>

Here is what the APA director said in reply: &ldquo;We know our project budget is small, but as stated in the RFP, we&rsquo;re more than willing to consider proposals over that amount—we just need the budget to be explained in the proposal so we understand what we are getting for the additional cost. The APA&rsquo;s finances are tight, but we do want to pay a fair wage for the project, and if we receive a proposal that convinces us we should increase the budget, we will find the money to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that will encourage anyone here to take a stab, but it seems reasonable.</p>

<p>Given the response here, I&rsquo;d suggest contacting one of the designers at your university&rsquo;s press (Chicago). They live in roughly the same world as you, and in that world, have won a fair number of awards for their work. One of them might take it on as a freelance project.</p>

<cite>A practicing professional would probably ballpark that closer to $10–25,000.00 USD depending on the size of their operation and how much of their labour they would be willing to donate in kind.</cite></p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to be kidding. Jeez, am I in the wrong spot.</p>

<p>Of course, that&rsquo;s still world-dependent. In the world I live in &ndash; scholarly publishing &ndash; I believe if you check the indexes for the last 20 years of the AAUP bookshow, you&rsquo;ll find our company &ndash; about 5 or 6 of us &ndash; have &ldquo;composed&rdquo; more books selected for the show than any other single firm of whatever size. I haven&rsquo;t done this, I could be wrong. But if not the most, then comfortably way up there.</p>
<p>So much for <cite>bona fides</cite> in my world. Are you interested in what we charge to set a book? How much for image prep? An indication of what we make in terms of salaries? I doubt it, too different a world. Hint: at $25K a pop, I could do 2 logos in year and make significantly more&hellip;</p>

<p>Well they&rsquo;re asking for a lot more than just a logo. But putting that aside, there are some factors which make the freelance life less appealing than you might think. For example&hellip;</p>
<p>• You must buy your own health insurance (I pay around $800 a month)
• No paid sick days
• No paid holidays
• No paid vacations
• No retirement plan (except what you save yourself)
• Slow periods when you have zero income for several days/weeks
• The occasional client who doesn&rsquo;t pay you
• If you&rsquo;ve got an office and/or employees, a big chunk of your income will be spent paying expenses</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re busy and the money is rolling in, it&rsquo;s great. But there are lots of times I envy friends who have regular jobs with steady paychecks and fringe benefits.</p>

<p>My biggest grumble is someone new comes on the site and asks a question. It is obvious they&rsquo;re not Coca-Cola, not looking for New York, Madison Avenue, Mad Men prices. But they&rsquo;re told that&rsquo;s all there is, anything else is &ldquo;not professional,&rdquo; and by implication, &ldquo;not good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That is not true, not good information. And it denigrates the rest of us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fastest to deliver me a sandwich gets paid, all the other ones, just learn from your failure to deliver quickly enough&rdquo;.</p>
<p>… seriously, there are design school to learn. And then, most young designers make internships to continue learning and getting experience.
Once in the professional world, with bills to pay, a designers deserves to be paid for his work. Because you are learning something doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re not supposed to earn a decent wage.</p>
<p>Then, of course, everybody is &ldquo;free&rdquo; to do whatever they want, and participate to bullshit spec work/competitions if they &ldquo;want&rdquo;.</p>
