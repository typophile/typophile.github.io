body: "dear all,\r\n\r\ni am wondering if white spots in overlaying type can be caused
  by anything else than inconsistent curve-directions. the example attached is a screenshot
  of a pdf - could it also be a pdf-rendering issue or is the font certainly flawed?
  (i need to check if an argument for my dissertation is water-proof) ;)\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\ntitus"

  body: PDF rendering (especially prior to Acrobat v.7.0.5) can cause problems like
    this. I used to have trouble with Arabic in Acrobat for this reason. Have you
    tried printing the PDF to a PS printer? This might reveal whether the issue is
    rendering or outline direction. If it is outline direction, I would expect to
    see it in print also.

  body: "\r\nThe white spots also occur with overlays when the curve directions are
    correct. For example, if you forget to \"remove overlap\" your ccedilla it can
    have a white spot even if the curve directions are correct. I assume that most
    DTP applications and printers are developed under the assumption that there are
    no overlapping contours, not keeping in mind non-latin scripts.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    ignoring the fact that overlaps are forbidden could still be called a technical
    flaw of the font. Connecting scripts can be designed without any overlap, if you
    think of Mistral hot metal.\r\n"

  body: "<em>The white spots also occur with overlays when the curve directions are
    correct.</em>\r\n\r\nYes, but this is a renderering error. We accomodate it in
    the case of something like the c with cedilla, always being sure to merge the
    outlines, because there are other problems associated with leaving them unmerged
    (e.g. when a user applies an outline stroke to the glyph). But in the case of
    connecting scripts, the bug must be fixed on the rendering side.\r\n\r\n<em>Connecting
    scripts can be designed without any overlap, if you think of Mistral hot metal.</em>\r\n\r\nIn
    digital type, though, there must be an overlap for connecting scripts, because
    greyscale rounding can cause loss of stroke weight or even drop out where there
    should be connections. At a upm of 2048, Microsoft recommend an overlap of 70
    units for Arabic glyphs to prevent this problem."

    that the contour direction is wrong is not water-proof.\r\n\r\n<cite>because greyscale
    rounding can cause loss of stroke weight or even drop out where there should be

  body: "<em>Would that not be a rendering error that must be fixed on the rendering
    side? Interesting to learn about that issue, however.</em>\r\n\r\nNot really,
    because unlike something like how to handle overlapping outlines, which is something
    that can affect print as well as screen rendering, the rounding issue is simply
    an aspect of 'the raster tragedy at low resolutions' (to use Beat Stamm's memorable
    phrase), i.e. it is part-and-parcel of how we make type for screen. The renderer
    doesn't know that two glyph shapes are adjacent and are supposed to look continuous;
    it just knows that here are some outlines and tries to rasterise them as well
    as it can using algorithms and instruction sets. Since a font is going to encounter
    multiple kinds of rasterisers (b/w, greyscale, subpixel) from multiple software
    developers (MS, Apple, Adobe, FreeType...) outlines and/or hints need to be able
    to ensure correct handling of connections."

    \r\n\r\nAnd an interesting fault dump, too. Because type designers are still alive
    around here somewhere, the Tragedy, I assure you, is in the Rasterizer: Adobe
    thinking that two blacks make a white is just plain stupid, and the tragedy that
    MS thinks \"native mode\" only ever means sub-pixel positioning making the path
    to quality longer, but still possible.\r\n\r\n\"The renderer doesn\u2019t know

    renderer doesn\u2019t know that two glyph shapes are adjacent and, if they are
    the same, are supposed to look the same, either...\r\n\r\n"

  body: This could be remedied in an OpenType font by having two sets of glyphs for
    every character, one with clockwise paths, and the other with counter-clockwise
    paths, and including a contextual alternate feature that alternates the directionality
    of adjacent glyphs.
