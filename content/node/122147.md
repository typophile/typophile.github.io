  the Secession Vienna building. I am not looking for similar \t\r\nArt Nouveau or
  Arts & Crafts fonts; would prefer suggestions to the actual, professionally digitized/licensed
  typefaces.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nJonathan\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/secession-1_5706.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/secession-2_5387.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/secession-3_4372.png]\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I agree with Riccardo. Take a good look at the architectural drawing on the
    second to last row on this page:\r\nhttp://galleryhip.com/secession-building-olbrich.html\r\n\r\nThe
    typography on the building was designed by the architect, Joseph Maria Olbrich,
    and/or one of the artists involved in the Secessionist movement. If it has ever
    been turned into a digital typeface, I can find no evidence of it.\r\n"
