body: This might be a long-shot but I'm looking for a rather elegant serif that includes
  an RG-ligature. Where the R encapsules a smaller G. I have this feeling I have seen
  this somewhere, but i don't know where. Here's a quick mock up to illustrate what
  I mean:[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lig_4853.jpg]

  body: Thank you both. Mantinia might work. I see it has an alternative R that could
    fit well.
