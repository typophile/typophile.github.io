  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Regarding LinoLetter 03/05 - &quot;Designs Determined to Inspire&quot; uploaded by Mr. Thorsten Weil on 3rd March 2005 to this Typophile forum, I would like to add the following remarks to Section 2 on &quot;Basic Commercial&quot;: <BR> <BR>     2. The Typeface in the New York Subway System - Basic Commercial <BR> <BR>     As far as sans serif text faces go, you'll always be on the <BR>     safe side with this old favorite: the Basic Commercial font <BR>     family epitomizes clear and objective design. These classic <BR>     forms have very few unusual qualities, and remain both <BR>     lively and legible in all weights. Perhaps this anonymity is <BR>     the reason that Basic Commercial's style has been popular <BR>     with graphic designers for decades! <BR> <BR>     Basic Commercial's design has a century's worth of history <BR>     behind it. The typeface was distributed for many years in <BR>     the United States under the name Standard Series, where it <BR>     worked its way into many aspects of daily life and culture: <BR>     for instance, it was the face chosen for use in the New <BR>     York City subway system's signage.  <BR> <BR>     Grab all eight Basic Commercial font styles together in one <BR>     low-price value pack:  <BR>     <a href="http://www.linotype.com/6-2387-6/basiccommercialvp.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.linotype.com/6-2387-6/basiccommercialvp.html">http://www.linotype.com/6-2387-6/basiccommercialvp.html</a></a> <BR> <BR> <BR>1) &quot;Akzidenz Grotesk&quot; by Adobe <BR> <BR>More than 15 years ago, in 1989, Adobo published the font &quot;Akzidenz Grotesk&quot; with the following copyright notice: <BR> <BR>&quot;Copyright (c) 1989 Adobe Systems Incorporated. All Rights Reserved. The digitally encoded machine readable software for producing the Typefaces licensed to you is copyrighted (c) 1989 Adobe Systems. This software is the property of Adobe Systems Incorporated and its licensors, and may not be reproduced, used, displayed, modified, disclosed or transferred without the express written approval of Adobe.&quot; <BR> <BR>Mr. Thomas Phinney of Adobe Inc. contends with reference to this Adobe copyright notice that it was Adobe that created in the year 1989 this &quot;font software program&quot; as &quot;original work of authorship&quot;. <BR> <BR> <BR>2) &quot;Basic Commercial&quot; by Linotype <BR> <BR>About 5 years ago, in 2000, Linotype published exactly the same font. &quot;Exactly the same&quot; means that both fonts (Adobe's &quot;Akzidenz Grotesk&quot; and Linotype's &quot;Basic Commercial&quot;) have completely identical glyphs and that both fonts are completely identical &quot;font software programs&quot;. <BR> <BR>However, in the &quot;Basic Commercial&quot;, Adobe's copyright notice was removed and replaced by this notice: <BR> <BR>&quot;Copyright (c) 2000, 2002, 2003 Linotype Library GmbH, <a href="http://www.linotype.com" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.linotype.com">www.linotype.com</a></a>.

Basic Commercial is a trademark of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG which may be registered in certain jurisdictions, exclusively licensed through Linotype Library GmbH, a wholly owned subsidiary of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG. This typeface is original artwork of Morris Fuller Benton. The design may be protected in certain jurisdictions.&quot; <BR> <BR>Mr. Bruno Steinert of Linotype GmbH contends with reference to this Linotype copyright notice that it was Linotype that created in the year 2000, i.e. 11 years later, this &quot;font software program&quot; as &quot;original work of authorship&quot;. <BR> <BR>Is it possible that Linotype, more than 10 years later and completely independently created a &quot;font software program&quot; that is hundred percent identical with a &quot;font software program&quot; created by Adobe more than 10 years ago ??? <BR> <BR> <BR>3) Morris Fuller Benton <BR> <BR>Bruno Steinert of Linotype contends with reference to &quot;Basic Commercial&quot;: <BR> <BR>    &quot;This typeface is original artwork of Morris Fuller Benton.&quot; <BR> <BR>For instance at the website <BR> <BR>   <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/basic-commercial-lt/" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/basic-commercial-lt/">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/basic-commercial-lt/</a></a> <BR> <BR>we read about &quot;Basic Commercial&quot;: <BR> <BR>    Design Credits <BR>    First seen on MyFonts: April 10th, 2002 <BR>    Designed by: Morris Fuller Benton <BR>    Designed when: 1990 <BR>    Design owned by: Linotype <BR> <BR>And if you enter the following keywords at <a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.google.com">www.google.com</a></a> <BR> <BR>    Basic Commercial Morris Fuller Benton Akzidenz Grotesk <BR> <BR>Google displays a link to a Linotype website, whose contents has been modified, but if you click on the &quot;cache&quot;, Google displays the old contents of website on 8. Apr. 2004 23:28:15 GMT. Here we read the cached contents of the Linotype website of 8th April 2004: <BR> <BR>   &quot;Basic Commercial <BR>   Designer Morris Fuller Benton, 1900  <BR>   About Basic Commercial(tm) <BR>   Basic Commercial font is based on the design for Akzidenz Grotesk, <BR>   which appeared with Berthold in 1900, designed by type setters whose <BR>   names have not been recorded, but whose skill cannot be overlooked.&quot; <BR> <BR>This means that Bruno Steinert contended that &quot;Basic Commercial&quot; was designed by the Berthold designer Morris Fuller Benton in the year 1900. <BR> <BR>However, Morris Fuller Benton never designed the &quot;Akzidenz Grotesk&quot;, nor did he design Linotype's &quot;Basic Commercial&quot; which is 100% identical with Adobe's &quot;Akzidenz Grotesk&quot;. <BR> <BR>In &quot;LinoLetter&quot; of March 2005 &quot;Designs Determined to Inspire&quot;, Bruno Steinert now tells a new story. Now, he does not mention &quot;Akzidenz Grotesk&quot;, &quot;Berthold&quot; and &quot;Morris Fuller Benton&quot;. These names are now discarded by him. Instead, now in 2005, Bruno Steinert contends that the &quot;Basic Commercial&quot; is identical with the font &quot;Standard Series&quot;. He declares: &quot;The typeface was distributed for many years in the United States under the name Standard Series&quot;. <BR> <BR>Let's summarize: According to Bruno Steinert, the font &quot;Basic Commercial&quot; by Linotype, which is identical with the font &quot;Akzidenz Grotesk&quot; by Adobe, was created by Morris Fuller Benton in 1900 as &quot;Akzidenz Grotesk&quot; for Berthold, and Bruno Steinert distributed this font for many years in the United States under the name &quot;Standard Series&quot; and Bruno Steinert created the &quot;font software program&quot; for this typeface in the year 2000. Correct? <BR> <BR> <BR>4) The Funny Font Forging Industry <BR> <BR>Professor Devroye at his website <BR> <BR>    <a href="http://jeff.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/legal.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://jeff.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/legal.html">http://jeff.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/legal.html</a></a> <BR> <BR>draws the attention to the report &quot;The Funny Font Forging Industry&quot;, which is downloadable as forgers.pdf from the website <BR> <BR>    <a href="http://www.sanskritweb.de/fontdocs" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.sanskritweb.de/fontdocs">http://www.sanskritweb.de/fontdocs</a></a> <BR> <BR>In this report, Linotype's &quot;Basic Commercial&quot; alias Adobe's &quot;Akzidenz Grotesk&quot; alias Berthold's &quot;Akzidenz Grotesk&quot; is seen from the point of view of public prosecutors and criminal court judges. In this report, Bruno Steinert is described as a font forger who forged the &quot;Akzidenz Grotesk&quot; by the &quot;Linotype Method&quot;. <BR> <BR> <BR>5) name removed by moderator <BR> <BR>Those who want to have a look at the &quot;Basic Commercial&quot;, but who do not want to waste money on this font forgery by Bruno Steinert, may visit name removed by moderator <BR> <BR>url removed by moderator <BR> <BR>These fonts do not contain the copyright notices so that criminal investigators cannot decide whether the fonts at the name removed by moderator are Adobe's &quot;Akzidenz Grotesk&quot; or Linotype's &quot;Basic Commercial&quot; or Berthold's original &quot;Akzidenz Grotesk&quot;. This is no surprise, since all these fonts are identical with the exception of the copyright notices. <BR> <BR>If you open Berthold's &quot;Akzidenz Grotesk&quot; with a font editor and replace the Berthold copyright notice by the Adobe copyright notice, you create Adobe's &quot;Akzidenz Grotesk&quot;. <BR> <BR>If you open Adobe's &quot;Akzidenz Grotesk&quot; and replace the Adobe copyright notice by the Linotype copyright notice and additionally replace the name &quot;Akzidenz Grotesk&quot; by &quot;Basic Commercial&quot;, you create Linotype's &quot;Basic Commercial&quot;. <BR> <BR>If you open the name removed by moderator fonts and replace the name &quot;Basic Commercial&quot; by &quot;Basic Crimes&quot; and if you insert the notice &quot;Copyright by Criminals&quot;, you create a general-purpose version for the criminals in the font forging industry. <BR> <BR>Any lawsuits instituted against the name removed by moderator would be most interesting from the legal point of view, since all three fonts are identical: <BR> <BR>Mr. Harvey Hunt of Berthold would contend at court that it was he, who wrote the &quot;font software program&quot; of &quot;Akzidenz Grotesk&quot; (&quot;Copyright by Berthold&hellip;&quot;). <BR> <BR>Mr. Thomas Phinney of Adobe would contend at court that it was he, who wrote the same &quot;font software program&quot; of the same &quot;Akzidenz Grotesk&quot; (&quot;Copyright by Adobe&hellip;&quot;) <BR> <BR>Mr. Bruno Steinert of Linotype would contend that it was he, who wrote the same &quot;font software program&quot; of the &quot;Basic Commercial&quot; (&quot;Copyright by Linotype&hellip;&quot;). <BR> <BR>Wilhelm Ohnesorg, Germany</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Your point in earlier mails seems to be that fonts can't be copyrighted, despite the fact that courts have supported font copyright.  <BR> <BR>But the above case, even if true, seems to relate purely to trademarks. The fact that font vendors go to extreme measures to avoid using or referencing other people's trademarks is understandable. Trademarks add more protectability to 100 year old designs than copyright, design patent, EULAs and big sticks combined. <BR> <BR>Even if it turns out that copyright strings in fonts are worthless, I think including them sends a good message to the uninformed that the font isn't public-domain and was probably provided under some kind of license.  <BR> <BR>Cheers, Si</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Dear Mr. Daniel, <BR> <BR>I am very surprised about your message, and I am astonished that the moderator removed the name of the website which offers the &quot;Basic Commercial&quot; font WITHOUT THE FALSE copyright notice. <BR>  <BR> <BR>1) Copyrightability of Computer Programs in US <BR> <BR>&gt; Your point in earlier mails seems to be that fonts can't be copyrighted, despite the fact that courts have supported font copyright. <BR> <BR>I did not say so! On the contrary: In the US, computer programs (which, by the way, are defined by US courts as &quot;literary works&quot;) are copyrightable since 25 years (since the enactment of a certain amendment in the year of 1980) PROVIDED THAT certain requirements, which I have described, are fullfilled, namely (1) firstly that a computer program is only protected by copyright if it is a creative work, and (2) secondly if the author of this creative work is a human being that has written the source code of this computer program. <BR> <BR>Regarding the SOURCE CODE requirement which was rejected by other members of this forum as &quot;so scurrilous and wrong&quot;  (William Berkson), I give a short example: <BR> <BR>My grandmother does not know the PostScript programming language and she cannot write the source code of a PostScript program. Therefore she can never be the programmer (=author = copyright owner) of a PostScript program. <BR> <BR>The same is true for PostScript Type 1 fonts: My grandmother cannot write the source code of PostScript Type 1 fonts, and therefore she can never be the programmer (= author = copyright owner) of a PostScript Type 1 font. <BR> <BR>A computer programmer, who reads this &quot;grandma example&quot;, will be most astonished to learn that the other members of this Typophile forum are of the opinion that persons who are NOT computer programmers and who do NOT know the PostScript programming language and who are NOT able to write the source code of PostScript Type 1 font software programs, claim to be the programmers (= authors = copyright owners) of PostScript Type 1 font software programs. This is very, very strange indeed! <BR> <BR> <BR>2) Trademark Notice <BR> <BR>&gt; But the above case, even if true, seems to relate purely to trademarks. <BR> <BR>No, no! Copyright law and trademark law are two completely different laws. By stating <BR> <BR> &quot;Basic Commercial is a trademark of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG&quot; <BR> <BR>Mr. Bruno Steinert made it clear that &quot;Basic Commercial&quot; is a trademark. This statement is correct and it is legally sufficient, but this trademark notice refers to the trademark law, not to the copyright law. <BR> <BR> <BR>3) Copyright Notice <BR> <BR>&gt; Even if it turns out that copyright strings in fonts are worthless <BR> <BR>Here begins the crucial part of the case. The copyright notice is not a declaration that you can add to a font just for fun. This would be highly dangerous: The copyright notice is a fully binding legal declaration which must contain the whole truth and nothing but the truth, since the copyright notice is similar to making a declaration in lieu of an oath. <BR> <BR>In the &quot;Copyright Law of the United States of America&quot; downloadable as Circular 92 at the website of the Copyright Office (I do not mention the link for fear that the moderator removes the link), you will find the regulations concerning the copyright notice in sections</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Mr. Ohnesorg. My phrase 'scurrilous and wrong' referred to your accusations against Mr. Phinney, not to your claim of a &quot;SOURCE CODE requirement&quot; for  fonts.  <BR> <BR>Your 'source requirement' seems to me just wrong as far as the current state of the law. I confess I know little about this whole matter, but I do know that the law is determined not by any person's theories about it, but rather by what legislators enact and judges rule in interpretation of the law. You do not seem to grasp that whatever the logic or illogic of your argument, it is not the law unless a court agrees with it.  <BR> <BR>Currently Judge Whyte seems to have the last word, and he doesn't agree with you. So for your argument to become law in the US you would have to convince another court in the US that you are right, and Judge Whyte wrong.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Dear Mr. Gianotten, <BR> <BR>Thanks for your interesting reply. <BR> <BR>Morris Fuller Benton made a lot of Gothic typefaces, e.g. Alternate Gothic, Bank Gothic, Clearface Gothic, Franklin Gothic, News Gothic, Raleigh Gothic and others. I examined all these fonts, but none of these Benton fonts is identical with Linotype's &quot;Basic Commercial&quot;. <BR> <BR>As regards the Franklin Gothic by Morris Fuller Benton, to which you refer by quoting Ansel M. Olson's chapter on &quot;Franklin Gothic&quot; from the book &quot;Revival of the fittest&quot;, we see that Olson writes &quot;&hellip; intended to COMPETE with &hellip; e.g. Akzidenz Grotesk&quot;. But a font that COMPETES with another font is NOT IDENTICAL with another font, UNLESS it is a pirated copy or a knock-off imitation of the other font.  <BR> <BR>Furthermore Ansel M. Olson does not mention &quot;Basic Commercial&quot; at all in connection with Morris Fuller Benton and therefore he does not answer the question whether Mr. Bruno Steinert's legally binding copyright notice declaration &quot;This Basic Commercial typeface is original artwork of Morris Fuller Benton&quot; is a false fraudulent copyright notice or not. <BR> <BR>If a judge at a criminal court looks at the comparison picture attached below, he will easily recognize that &quot;Akzidenz Grotesk&quot; and &quot;Basic Commercial&quot; are completely identical, whereas &quot;Basic Commercial&quot; and &quot;Franklin Gothic&quot; are completely different, and hence the criminal court judge will easily recognize that Mr. Bruno Steinert's declaration that &quot;Basic Commercial&quot; is &quot;original artwork of Morris Fuller Benton&quot; is a false fraudulent copyright notice intended to make gullible font buyers believe that &quot;This typeface is original artwork of Morris Fuller Benton&quot;. <BR> <BR>If an art seller declares: &quot;This painting is original artwork of Vincent van Gogh&quot;, although this artwork was not made by Vincent van Gogh, then this art seller is a criminal. And if the font seller Bruno Steinert declares &quot;This typeface is original artwork of Morris Fuller Benton&quot;, although this artwork was not made by Morris Fuller Benton, then Bruno Steinert is a criminal. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>W.O. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4102/66730.gif" alt="Comparison of Basic Commercial with Franklin Gothic"></div>

It just took some days instead of the 5 years you mention.

		<div class="commentbody">Dear Mr. Gianotten, <BR> <BR>Why is your message of 6th March misleading? For the simple reason that you do not mention &quot;Basic Commercial&quot; in your message, nor is it mentioned in the book quoted by you. However, in your Dutch statement, you mention it, and also the &quot;juridische verwikkelingen&quot; between Adobe, Berthold and Linotype. <BR> <BR>The professional font forger Bruno Steinert has been selling the font &quot;Basic Commercial&quot; since SEVERAL YEARS (since at least two years and a half) with the fraudulent claim &quot;This typeface is original artwork of Morris Fuller Benton&quot; and with the fraudulent claim &quot;new typeface&quot;. <BR> <BR>Many of the dim-witted managers in advertising agencies and design studios who are the font-buying customers of Bruno Steinert and who had already bought the font &quot;Akzidenz Grotesk&quot; sold by Bruno Steinert until year 2000, have bought AGAIN exactly the same font thus paying TWICE for the same commodity, because these dim-witted suckers of advertising agencies and of design studios have been cheated by the fraudulent lies of Bruno Steinert claiming that &quot;Basic Commercial&quot; is a &quot;new typeface&quot; and &quot;the original artwork of Morris Fuller Benton&quot;, and therefore have been mentally unable to recognize that the font &quot;Basic Commercial&quot; sold by Bruno Steinert since year 2000 is identical with the font &quot;Akzidenz Grotesk&quot; sold by Bruno Steinert until year 2000. <BR> <BR>Most members of this Typophile forum consider it as customary that font-buying suckers are cheated by fraudulent font sellers. This explains why they begin to doze off, if someone tells them that fraudulent copyright notices are customary. That is why Mr. Papazian released &quot;deep, reverberating snoring sounds&quot;. <BR>  <BR>In my previous message to this thread, I made this conditional &quot;if-then&quot; statement: <BR> <BR>If Mr. Bruno Steinert, manager of the Linotype GmbH, cannot prove that Linotype's &quot;Basic Commercial&quot; was published FOR THE FIRST TIME in the year 2000, then he is a copyright criminal according to section</div>

		<div class="commentbody">On March 22 Wilhelm Ohnesorg replied: <BR> <BR>&gt;  Why is your message of 6th March misleading? For the simple reason <BR>&gt;  that you do not mention &quot;Basic Commercial&quot; in your message, nor is it <BR>&gt;  mentioned in the book quoted by you. However, in your Dutch statement, <BR>&gt;  you mention it, and also the &quot;juridische verwikkelingen&quot; (legal implications) between <BR>&gt;  Adobe, Berthold and Linotype. <BR> <BR>The original question of Sergej Malinovski in the contribution I referred to was &quot;You thought it was clear but it is not clear. You are saying Basic Commercial is not designed by Benton. So?&quot; <BR>My answer was:  <BR>No, he did not. I tried to explain that by referring to the text in the book I mentioned.  <BR>Morris Fuller Benton was asked by ATF to create a typeface to compete with Akzidenz Grotesk. <BR>That was my attempt to reply Sergej. <BR>Just that. <BR>But I failed. You did not understand it. <BR>Yes, I wrote several articles on the legal issues. In several magazines.  <BR>And some documents for Adobe, Agfa, Linotype and others. That</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Bruno Steinert states that  Basic Commercial and Berthold Akzidenz Grotesk are not identical.</p>
<p>This appears to be true when one reads David Lemon&rsquo;s comments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Adobe licenses a typeface, the licensing company supplies what they consider the definitive design; Adobe is not free to reinterpret it. As an example of the difference that sources make, I suggest comparing the Akzidenz Grotesk, Berthold Walbaum or Post-Antiqua which Adobe produced from Berthold&rsquo;s digitizations to the versions that Linotype sells.&rdquo;</p>
