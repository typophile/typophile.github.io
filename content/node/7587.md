body: I have a question about trapping type.  <BR> <BR>I am printing on the surface
  of a clear plastic &#34;bottle&#34; which has a reflective core. It makes for a
  great effect although I am fighting the obvious, readability. I wonder whether or
  not to place the dark type against a white ground to bring out the brand. I worry
  about problems with registration with a second ink and whether to trap  &#40;choke&#41;
  the type.  <BR> <BR>Any thoughts, or experience?

  body: If the type is dark enough why not overprint the dark type over the white
    background.

  body: I think you are using the term choke incorrectly. In the situation you describe
    the dark type will remain unchanged, and you will &#34;choke&#34; the background
    to created the trap. If you had light type overprinting a dark background you
    would &#34;spread&#34; the light type into the dark background to create the trap.
