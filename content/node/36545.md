body: "Hi guys:\r\n\r\nI saw this font on MyFonts. I like it for the most part- some
  stokes are little a blunted- nothing i can't work with though. \r\nBut the numerals
  look a little off to me- especially the six. Am I right? Or is it just me? I usually
  can spot ugly curves in alphabetics but not so much in analphabetics.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/images/library/source/Jupiter.pdf\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/jupiter/\r\n\r\nThanks
  for helping,\r\n\r\nMike Diaz :-)\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    there is nothing better than Thierry Puyfoulhoux's <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/presence_typo/classica_prestige/">Classica

    putting it but you seem to be correct."

    these days.

    thank you! And no thanks to Jupiter- I'm glad I posted.\r\n\r\nMikey :-)\r\n\r\nPs..
    Coles perhaps Thierry is consumed by large project? Any official comment?"

  body: "I hope I'm not being thick, but in case there is an insinuation that I knocked
    off Berthold's font, I am pasting what I just emailed Carl Crossgrove. \r\n\r\nI
    do give credit to Poppl's Nero face as an inspiration in the font's blurb, and
    Jupiter is a clean display roman type as opposed to Poppl's original idea of unregulated
    rough calligraphic forms, not to mention that the character set is entirely different,
    and the majority of Poppl's original shapes had to be changed because they didn't
    work as well in a non-calligraphic concept. If you would like a copy of Jupiter
    to compare both ideas, I'll be happy to send you one. I do not have the digital
    version of Nero. Whatever I garnered from Poppl's idea was through a 1983 Mecanorma
    catalog.\r\n\r\nPatrick Griffin"

    want to head back to Arles with a nice camera and put together a typeface based
    on the inscriptions and nutty ligatures in the museum and necropolis. Maybe we\u2019ll
    be able to get back to Europe next summer seeing as we have no big renovations
    left and Typecon is in a far less expensive city."

    design; the various upright caps, small caps and swashes greatly increase its
    usefulness. "
