  body: The articles seem to imply that, at the minimum, Apple will continue to be
    able to include the most recently updated versions of the Microsoft fonts that
    they currently include with Mac OS X. If I recall correctly, those include Andale
    Mono, Arial, Comic Sans MS, Courier New, Georgia, Impact, Times New Roman, Trebuchet,
    Verdana, Wingdings, and Webdings. There is nothing said about new fonts being
    added to that list, but nothing to suggest they won't either.

    prefer the Linotype edition that Apple has had for ages.  The shapes of the diacritics
    make me want to puke.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea tan fina que apenas

  body: "Sorry, no ClearType collection fonts were part of this license. It's the
    Vista versions of the core fonts and Web fonts, plus a couple of extra fonts Apple
    asked for and a few we suggested. The old versions Apple were shipping were the
    Mac IE-era versions (1998), so the Vista versions include thousands of additional
    characters and other updates missing from the Apple shipping versions.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Simon thanks for the info!\r\n\r\nBummer I guess, but really that would have
    been asking a bit much from MS to license their brand spanking new fonts to Apple.
    It usually takes a while.\r\n\r\nFor example, Skia by Matthew Carter and Hoefler
    Text by Jonathan Hoefler were unattainable to non-mac users for sometime until
    their exclusivity contract was up.\r\n\r\nOf course, Apple may consider a deal
    with Ascender that could put the new fonts into Leopard. Or I buy them myself
    from Ascender.\r\n\r\nMikey :-)"
