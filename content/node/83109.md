body: "In some fonts, especially fonts from over a decade ago, the macron diacritical
  glyph is really, really wide, sometimes almost twice the length of a tilde. Often
  the stroke seems too thin compared to the rest of the accents.\r\n\r\nGeorgia is
  an example where the regular macron looks like a normal macron and the combining
  macron is long & thin.\r\n\r\nWhat's the deal with skinny, wide macrons?\r\n\r\n<img

  body: "@John 0304\r\n\r\nMy mistake: Georgia has a regular macron. I think I figured
    out the problem. Lots of early 90's fonts didn't contain macronized letters so
    there may have been less likely to require a properly designed macron. That might
    be why there's sometimes an overscore in the macron (02C9) position."

    across fonts: the character was treated as a generic line.'
