    Institute</a>. Tremendous Impressionist/Post-Impressionist collection. There's
    some great architecture all around too. You may want to check out a walking tour
    with the <a href=\"http://www.architecture.org/\">Chicago Architecture Foundation</a>.
    \r\n\r\nOh and if you're into funny, gotta catch a mainstage show at <a href=\"http://www.secondcity.com/?id=theatres/chicago/mainstage\">Second
    City</a>."

    mentioned. The problem will be the schedule now\u2026 But that's an happy problem!\r\n\r\nJackson,
    we'll be there from November 8 through November 12-13, so it may be short for
    the exhibition\u2026\r\n\r\nOnce again, thanks a lot.\r\n\r\n"
