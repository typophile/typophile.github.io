  body: "Thanks for the help. I am not looking for a label looking font but what the
    machines used as letters. I want to update my font \u201CImpact Label\u201D to
    include some extra glyphs (@ # $ etc.) and want to keep it in the correct face
    if I can. I may have to just make up my own.\r\n\r\nTotally appreciate your time
    and help. Cheers."
