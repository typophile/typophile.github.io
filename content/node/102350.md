  body: I don't know if it's a font actually (hope you're not expecting one reproducing
    Hulk's face trough letters ;) may be more a custom lettering or a heavily squooshed
    font... Part of the very specific /U bottom, it could be approximate with any
    generic fat black sans of your choice ([[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/univers/|Univers
    Extra Black]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/helvetica|Helvetica]] (Black or
    Compressed), [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/compacta|Compacta]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/impact|Impact]],
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/haettenschweiler|Haetschenweiler]]...) and manipulate
    it. The closest I was able to find is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/francker|Francker
    Ultra Black]] though which comes very close. If you still need this logo, it is
    freely available to download [[http://www.brandsoftheworld.com/logo/hulk|here]].

    body: Hi, thank you so much. I have a vehicle to brand for a rugby player, which
      nickname is Hulk. He wants his name on the vehicle in the "HULK" font. Thank
      you for your prompt reply. Helps a lot.
