  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hey all, this is my first time posting here, need some help on a logo. 

The client is a photographer who focuses on music/band and fashion photography, aimed mostly at younger people. He says what sets his work apart from the rest is the way he captures colour and movement.

This is what i have tried to represent in the logo. The final roughs i think look OK, albeit rather cliched. The client has chosen the logo bottom right (despite me saying the extra swirls and colours seem a bit overcrowded, and that the swirls on the other logos 'sit together better).

The client is happy, but i can't help but think that i could make the logo more impressive. I'm not too hot on identities and logos (this is my first paid job), so any pointers are appreciated. Thanks!

What is the name supposed to mean? No-ID(ea)? No name? - but that's a photographer's best asset.

The eye is definitely clichéd - there's heaps more to explore - flashes, viewfinders, framing, viewing the world differently.
In my opinion doesn't really capture "movement". There's also the issue of being able to consistently reproduce that number of colours in a logo (you'll be printing CMYK every time.)
Could you not simply use and abstract portion/crop of the photographers work next to the text, thus allowing some flexibility in the 'identity' you print that logo under a picture in a book etc and it'll take focus away from the image.

		<div class="commentbody">Well the name itself is not down to me, i think the client already has it established and therefore can't be changed.

Secondly, the identity is mainly to be applied to his website (not printed onto every photo etc), although i'm not sure where else he would want it.

He stated he wanted an eye, so i couldn't be too creative with ideas either, i was going for an aperture ring effect inside the eye to link it with photography.

Good point about the colours, though.

Thanks for your feeback :)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">My suggestion would be to design in one colour first (black on white) then add colour later.

I don't see music/fashion aimed at younger people in this logo. It's too clean and subdued, but it is a good start. Try a different typeface.

		<div class="commentbody">I saw a rainbow sphincter and the picasa logo.  I didn't even see an eye until reading the discussion!

I strongly agree with the advice to start with b&w, and also to try a different typeface.  Go for punky & distressed!  Perhaps retro art of an eye rather that's more stylized and less abstract.

Play with it!  I look forward to seeing what you come up with.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi there.

I agree with the comment that you have to try black and white first, then add color to the logo.

I'd recommend that you use a more "youthful" typeface, perhaps something more "grunge". You also have a great opportunity to create an "eye" out of the letter "O" of the name.

Play with this logo! Have fun with it!

		<div class="commentbody">I also saw the picasa logo, and the colors give me the idea of a print shop or graphics company.  I agree with others regarding the typeface that it's not "young" enough, maybe you can show movement in the typeface.  I just didn't feel it at first, but now that I've been staring at it for a while, I kinda like the left bottom one.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">OK, I just went to the website.  I am sorry to say this, but I like the current identity (white sans on black bg, minimal) better than this one.   I think refining the minimalist look or going punk would both be good directions, but that the current logo proposals seem totally inconsistent with the brand.

Good luck!
