  body: 'Well in that case, try Gill Sans, it''s the inspiration for Bliss Pro. Or
    even Myriad Pro, it''s a very elegant sans that''s overlooked because it''s the
    default font for most of Adobe''s products... there''s a reason for that. '

    Apple adopted Myriad for their corp ID.

    I don't see it being overused either: just because Apple is using it doesn't mean
    everyone else is....) (EDIT: or that no one else should....)"

  body: Whether you use Myriad Pro or Gill Sans, try a little letter spacing, I think
    your sans is set too tight.

  body: "But Kepler has something like 170 different variants from optical size to
    compression/expansion to weight. You sure you couldn't find something in that
    range to use effectively as a subhead without having to jump to a sans?\r\n\r\nAside
    from that, Kepler is a \"modern\" style typeface. Why not go for a grotesque instead
    of a humanist sans? It would match the proportions of the Modern better."
