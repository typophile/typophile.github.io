<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>EDIT: Had some trouble uploading the pictures in this post; they're in the follow-up. <br>-- <br> <br>Hello people. <br> <br>I'm doing a logotype for a group called Melk. <br>http://www.madshougaard.dk/typophile/melk_1.gif <br>I started out with this (very loosely outlined - no consistency whatsoever) <br> <br>Then decided it was a bit too 'sharp', so I reworked it, trying to get a Cooper / Sauna Black -quality to it: <br>http://www.madshougaard.dk/typophile/melk_2.jpg <br> <br>..then decided it was, after all, a bit too loose. <br>http://www.madshougaard.dk/typophile/melk_4.gif <br> <br>However, I did like the slanted look of the previous sketch, so I did this: <br>http://www.madshougaard.dk/typophile/melk_5.gif <br> <br>Something doesn't look right to me. It is the M I think. Maybe partly the E as well (btw: is it legible?). <br> <br>Please comment... <br> <br>regards, <br>Mads</div>

<div class=commentbody>I think your sketch is sweet! Kerning aside, i think it's got a more accurate baseline and a more descernable form for the 'e,' a better series of terminals, and, well, I dig the curves. <br> <br>Not knowing who this hiphop/electronica folks are, I can't tell you whether or not the fluid is better for them, but I know visually I find the sketch more interesting, and more cohesive. The strokes on the 'm,' for instance, are a lot more similar to the rest of the letters, where as the digitized versions don't quite match. <br> <br>I think the angle of the 'm' strokes aren't supported by the angle of the 'e,' which appears to be violently attacking the m. maybe if the left corner of the e was not a corner this would be different. <br> <br>Anyway, rock on, this is interesting stuff! <br> <br>Aaron <br> <br>EDIT: I just noticed that in your hand drawn sketch, the 'lk" ascenders are not really lined up, which I think is a great detail and could help liven up your digital versions!</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi Aaron, <br> <br>Thanks for the comments! You make some interesting points.. I'll try to work at it. <br> <br>To some degree I also think the sketch is best.. still; I think it gets too soft for them. Guess I'll have to try to balance the soft / hard details better.. <br> <br>Mads</div>

<div class=commentbody>hi! <br>I think the "where I am now:", nr 1. version is more legible. at nr. 2 the e and the k's hmm... righ side is quite alike, which makes them read the same. so in the worst case i could read (if i realy want to <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0> ) melle... <br> <br>so i thought.. I show u what i had in mind, <br>with a more K like thing... maybe: <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/55378.jpg alt=melk_b> <br> <br>cheers Mads, i actualy realy liked ur 1st scatch too <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0></div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi Greg, <br> <br>Thanks for looking into it. I like your take on the K.. however, I think it's turning to a direction that's not quite right for this. <br> <br>I've made a new M. It's been a struggle. Is it too different from the others?<img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/56003.gif alt="new M"> <br> <br>regards <br>Mads</div>

<div class=commentbody>hey - the e in your sketch...I think you might need the curve in the eye from the sketch onto your comps. in fact if you traced your sketch excatly, smoothed out some curves, I think you got something, well I like it at least, rather then the hard lines. <br> <br>strangely enough before your last revision I can't quite see the e - seems more like "c" or just some undesernable glyph but when you flipped the m, I see more e-ness, but the direction bothers me - unless you extend the strokes on k to the same degree and lenght for some sort of balance? <br> <br>just my tidbits. <br>-t</div>

<div class=commentbody>I also like the e in your sketch, but the m and k look sort of like Hebrew. You've rectified this largely in the last revision, but I second Tanya's suggestoin regarding the curved eye. Bring back the curved body, as well</div>
