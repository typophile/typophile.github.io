  I have like Impact and Walkway SemiBold, but I don't think they are the right font
  I'm looking for. \r\n\r\nFont 1:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FONT_5523.jpg]\r\n\r\nFont
  2:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FONT-2_5944.jpg]\r\n\r\nYou can look up
  these two pages of the website for more examples:\r\n\r\nFont 1 - http://models.com/oftheminute/?p=52602\r\nFont
  2 - http://models.com/oftheminute/?p=2480\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated.
  Thanks for advance.\r\n\r\n"

    my example, but it's pretty much close. \r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks for the help!"
