body: Hello, I have to redesign a restaurant&#39;s logo for an assignment, and I would
  love to get some feedback.  <BR> <BR>The restaurant I chose offers fine dining as
  well as a more casual cafe in the front &#40;although you can dress pretty casually
  in either part of the restuarant&#41;. It serves contemporary French cuisine, and
  the decor is very art nouveau, saying that the main restaurant is set in a turn-of-the-century,
  restored ballroom. Since the space is so &#34;grand&#34; and the gorgeous chandeliers
  inside left a lasting impression with me, I wanted to incoroprate the grandness
  of the space, its art nouveau roots and of course the chandeliers. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve
  done many versions, but this is the direction my teacher liked best. I&#39;m not
  exactly crazy about it &#40;I think it may be a little too bulky and unversitle&#41;,
  but the other solutions I had didn&#39;t seem &#34;grand&#34; enough. <BR> <BR>Please
  let me know what you think! Some good, constructive feedback would be wonderful!
