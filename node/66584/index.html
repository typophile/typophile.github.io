I don’t want Mormons or Islamic fundamentalists or born-again Christians running Typophile. I also don’t want squeamish, schoolmarmy atheists running it. As it stands now I can’t tell which of those groups is in charge, because the result is the same: You can’t really swear on this site.
</p>
<p>
In particular, not only can you not write the word “f&#117;&#99;&#107;” or any derivative, you can’t even post a link that includes those four characters in its URL (even if you’re using an actual <code>A</code> element rather than being dumb as a mule and pasting in an URL like it was plain text).  You have to <a href="http://typophile.com/node/59606" title="As by f%75%63%6B">obfuscate the link</a>.
</p>
<p>
It’s OK if you’re offended by the word “f&#117;&#99;&#107;.” I’m offended by Arial, but I don’t try to ban its usage, which is what the self-proclaimed “moderators” of this site are doing. And they’ve gone to elaborate lengths to set up a system that automatically censors your words without human intervention. (Yes, Americans, it’s still censorship even if the government isn’t the one doing it.)
</p>
<p>
Typophile has a whole list of banned topics, implicitly including all the topics I am posting under the MetaPhile rubric but explicitly including any topic explicable with the word “f&#117;&#99;&#107;.”
</p>
<p>
It’s simple: The most uptight and censorious members of Typophile, even if, for some reason, they have the keys to the house, should not get their way. If this is a discussion forum, I expect to be able to discuss things, and in particular I expect to be able to express indisputable facts (like the full and accurate text of a link) without interference.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I hesitate to make this post lest I reveal my other internet affiliations, but SomethingAwful has a filter that is turned off when a user is logged in, but if someone is just lurking, swear words are replaced by much less offensive phrases.

<p>I&rsquo;m not suggesting that Typophile do anything like this, given that this is not a comedy forum, but there could be a filter that is only activated when a user is not logged in, and a user could turn the filter on or off, as Lex suggested.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we could replace words with &ldquo;Arial&rdquo; or &ldquo;Comic Sans,&rdquo; as in, &ldquo;What the Arial are you rambling on about&rdquo; or &ldquo;Comic Sans you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Initiating a meta-forum just to complain on the features and handling of an existing forum might create an infinite loop, as <em>that</em> forum in turn may lead to complaints, resulting in a request for a meta-meta-forum. Perhaps Joe should install a filter on his own computer that discerns between typophilic and acidophilic posts, and directs the latter to a more suitable website. Or silently to his thrash can, so he can still feel good on sending, but no-one ever have to read &lsquo;em.</p>

With this view, of course, comes the recognition that some ideas require particular language, but so far as I know it is general possible to talk about typography without profanity. [That said, I&rsquo;m glad that my recent OED reference to the dog&rsquo;s bollocks was not censored.]</p>
<p>If Typophile were a communally created and operated site, then I&rsquo;d say that the members should determine what standard of language usage is desired. Typophile is a private concern, and I view my participation here as something like my attendance at someone else&rsquo;s house party. If my host doesn&rsquo;t want swearing, I will generally respect that wish. Of course, I&rsquo;m able to look at it in such terms because I know various ways to circumvent the nanny when occasion demands.</p>

<p>John, I love how you’ve dusted off that old we’re-all-guests-here argument, but it doesn’t hold water. This isn’t Typophile administrators’ little playground. I would refer you to <a href="http://fortuito.us/2007/05/some_community_tips_for_2007" title="Matt Haughey: Some community tips for 2007">mathowie’s years of hard-lived experience</a> running MetaFilter. Running the place like a fiefdom with hard-and-fast rules – the logical outcome of your position – harms the forum. At any rate, banning individual words, even words you personally believe we, i.e., other people, don’t need to use, is surely the pettiest manifestation of the I-own-this-place-and-I-set-the-rules ethos, is it not?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hrant, boys don&rsquo;t have the swearing skills men have. Proper swearing really does separate the men from the boys but the other way around. Swearing can be powerful and beautiful. Knowing when to use horseshit instead of bullshit . . . kids don&rsquo;t know. Have you ever heard a kid deliver &ldquo;goddamn son of a bitch&rdquo; properly? They can&rsquo;t do it. When said properly it&rsquo;s a breathtaking tom, tom, bass, hihat, cymbal crash. You try when you&rsquo;re a kid but it just doesn&rsquo;t sound right. When you&rsquo;re 20 and your voice is a bit lower, you can deliver a good &ldquo;bastard&rdquo; with the proper oomph it deserves. It takes years do do it properly. To swap an expected swear with a more obscure one at the right moment is a fine craft. When I was a kid, I could hear old men swearing in such an manly way, especially Quebeckers. I loved how they threw in a little English &ldquo;fuck you&rdquo; right in the middle of a sentence. It&rsquo;s said so quickly and casually; you wouldn&rsquo;t ever put a comma before it. Sublime.</p>
<p>Forbidding specific English words is far more childish than using them.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Ray, I hear ya. I grew up in Lebanon, and Arabic is held up by many as by far the most glorious language to swear in - not just because of its repertoire of oldschool insults, but also because of its incredible acoustic range. I&rsquo;ve experienced the same sort of high as you when witnessing masterful cursing; it can bring on a smile or even a loud chuckle, sometimes even if you&rsquo;re the target!</p>
<p>But I rarely feel inclined to engage in it myself, especially not in a place like this. Reacting explosively to almost getting run over by a car is one thing, telling somebody off about his lack of respect for readability is another! Words, even the simplest ones, have so much subtle, nebulous power within them - I simply enjoy leveraging that too much to fall for the sledgehammer that is swearing. BTW, this might be running parallel to my preference for text fonts over display.</p>
<p>That said, I rarely mind other people swearing. Except when I feel sorry for a person becasue a valid point he&rsquo;s trying to make is masked by offensive-for-its-sake language; or when an impressionable person is present, and he leaves as a result. Quite often, not swearing is simply a wise compromise for the greater good.</p>

<p>I’m with you Joe. The f-word isn’t the only f-word we need to be concerned with. Freedom. As in Freedom of Speech. Being able to freely express myself the way I want, when I want is very important to me.</p>
<p>You’re right about those Morons and god-damm Islams funda-whats-its on typophile. Now that you got me thinking Joe I never liked them and never will. Glad you brought it up.</p>
<p>But your forgetting two very important groups that totally piss me the fu.ck off! Perhaps you too.</p>
<p>Gays and disabled people. Ohhh-weee.</p>
<p>I have to park a million miles out of the way and I can just FORGET about using a public bathroom these days.</p>
<p>You feel me Joe—my brotha in telling da truth!?</p>
<p>Another f-word: fagg0t.</p>
<p>Why can’t I say it here on typophile? Did you know since I’ve joined Typophile I have so much difficulty in not using that word, but since me and Joe might get a breakthrough on the word f.uck we might as we have access to all the offensive there are. I just don’t want to say f.uck to be chic in an intellectual way like Starbucks people.</p>
<p>If only on Typophile we could utter a sentence like this:
<em>This rim-stretching muthafukin’ broke-ass windowlicking retarded meat-watching semen-guzzling parkin’-in-the-blue-space ear-biting slow as fukz faggy ass Adobe Flash is slowing my muthafukin computa down son!</em></p>
<p>Words can’t offend— their just sounds we make with our mouths.</p>
<p>Let’s say how we feel. Let’s say fuc.k freely. Let’s not limit ourselves. Let us say <em>whatever</em> we want to say when we want to.</p>
<p>Say it with me Joe, 
Let freedom ring!</p>
<p>Mike Diaz</p>

<p>Joe seems to be the leading advocate and practitioner of swearing on Typophile. His outbursts frequently lead to more swearing from otherwise mild-mannered folks who are exasperated beyond the point of no return. In other words, people on this forum who never otherwise swear in their posts&hellip; swear at Joe.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hello Guys et Gals:</p>
<p>Man has be marginalizing man since the beginning of time, and even in these (supposedly) educated times the practice is still just as common. The heart doesn’t engage the brain anymore. Intolerance and lack love for your fellow man (no matter what he is) will make its way into another susceptible heart.</p>
<p>Bendy, you rightly should find my words offensive much the same way I find Joe Clark’s intolerant comments towards Mormons, Muslims, Born Again Christians, and even Atheists outrageous.</p>
<p>I (we) don’t know if Joe harbors any true hatred for the aforementioned groups—perhaps a literacy device (or stunt)—a punch in the gut to the reader to draw him into the censorship portion of his Metaphile manifesto. I dunno.</p>
<p>I think Joe was trying to be provocative when he really was being reckless, spewing evil vitriolic dross—much in same way people say the f-word to show “they really mean it” or racial epithets when they run out of the more intellectual put-downs.</p>
<p>In any case I find it hypocritical (and ironic) for Joe (especially) to make ANY marginalizing comments about ANY group when he is member of two oft-sidelined groups ever in history of human beings: gays and the disabled. (There are Born Again Christians who cuss up a storm and there are gay Muslims who find cursing repugnant&hellip; I bet that wasn’t apart of your equation Joe.)</p>
<p>I think fear is at the heart of the issue.</p>
<p>Joe, do really feel Typophile is taking something important from you? What are these “list of banned topics” involving the f-word? Are these topics particular to disability or homosexuality? Are they relevant to a website revolving around the typographic arts?</p>
<p>Joe, if you got your way and Typophile was truly no holds barred, do you expect me or anyone else to keep the level discourse and the level of nastiness only to a bar you set and that everyone else except you be stung? Perhaps I <em>was</em> being veiled. In your truly meaningless conversation here in the ether are you willing to discriminate against Mormons, Muslims, Born Again Christians, Atheists or anyone else and yet not be held to the that same standard? If my “diatribe” was too “surreal” for you Joe then I’ll make it clear—I don’t do anything piecemeal. What you dish out, you will get dished back. Some will do it worse than I.</p>
<p>Why are you fighting for freedom on Typophile for yourself when you want to marginalize students to their own zone YET you don’t want Zara to put your topics in a special folder?
Why do you say f.ucktard when this word is portmanteau of f.uck and retard—do you not champion the mentally retarded?</p>
<p>I want you to think about ways you can feel strongly about something and fight vigorously for it, and bring it to success, yet in a way that doesn’t require the discrimination or disrespect of someone else. This doesn’t mean you have to dilute your being. You don’t have to appreciate an ideal, nor respect it, you can even hate it, but you do have to tolerate the person believing it .</p>
<p>(That is a concept so many people failed to understand after 9/11. 
Osama=terroist=middle easterner=all middle easterners are terrorists=let’s light up that mosque)</p>
<p>Mike Diaz</p>
<p>PS&hellip; Coles, I don’t ever recall saying I was gay on Typophile-never had sex with a man. SuperUltraPuzzlingFrequentUseOfTheWordFabulous?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>What is a bit of an issue is exactly what words are being censored. I&rsquo;ve had a few unexpected and rather mild utterances come up as a string of asterisks. I would assume the big [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_dirty_words|seven dirty words]] you can&rsquo;t say on TV are on the list. 
The words are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shit
<li>Piss
<li>Fuck
<li>Cunt
<li>Cocksucker
<li>Motherfucker
<li>Tits
</ul>
But I've had "ass", the alternative word for donkey, starred out in the past, while "arse" passed through undetected.
As mentioned above the big O-word for the sexual response "orgasm" gets blocked too, though there is nothing rude about that at all.
<p>What is being hit and missed exactly?</p>
