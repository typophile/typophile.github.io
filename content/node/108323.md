  body: This lettering comes from [[http://www.theguardian.com/data/series/show-and-tell|The
    Guardian]]. I'm pretty convinced this is a stencil version of their [[https://commercialtype.com/typefaces/guardian/egyptian_headline|Egyptian
    Headline]]. As alternative, you might like [[http://vllg.com/schwartzco/stag-stencil|Stag
    Stencil]], also designed by Christian Schwartz.

    \r\nGuardian Egyptian Headline Black does indeed seem a fit if edited using the
