  no English major but was appalled at the use of the word \u2018famous\u2019. I suspect
  'infamous' would have been too long for the column width but other choices could
  have been made. Am I wrong to be critical?\r\n\r\nDoes the layout accommodate the
  size of the article or the other way around?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sfchron_4031.jpg]"

    of the paper; headlines and photos get tweaked to work within the layouts. In
    the editorial world content and design are not really so separate."
