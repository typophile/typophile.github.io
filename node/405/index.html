  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">William <BR> <BR>I find attempts at classification like Bringhurst's a bit misleading, in the sense that they assume continuum. The historical perspective that &quot;we&quot; enjoy was not apparent prior to the use of the camera for documenting historical artifacts. Typefounders such as Caslon worked &quot;in the contemporary&quot; so to speak and were influenced in that way, not by historical precedents. The Dutch were drawing upon contemporary German, French and East European work. It would be wrong to assume they had knowledge of typeface development in an historical sense. <BR> <BR>So to some extent I would say they were not sacrificing elegance of letterform since they were not aware of previous effort. I think a reading of Moxon, writing in 1683 and very fond of the Dutch work, will reveal this. Both Updike and McLean show typographic developments as very culturally nationalistic. I believe this the correct path to follow in discerning why typeface design changed prior to the introduction of the camera. It explains much more than classification systems can.</div>

It may have been more revealing in terms of presswork, and required or allowed a different approach, but this is speculation. However, prior to the art movement phenomenon of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, technological advancements did tend to be of some significance in altering the type road.</div>

And nobody before him or since has had the balls to do what he did (that I've seen). <BR> <BR>Second, I'm no Fleischman expert - in fact the font in that sample (#65 in the Enschede inventory, and the most focused expression of his particular &quot;style&quot;) was brought to my attention by Andy Crewdson. A number of people have made Fleischman revivals, but none of them have dared to incorporate his <i>structural</i> innovations. Even the most daring interpretations have restricted themselves to superficial aesthetic funkiness - that misses the whole point (except as yet another source to milk) in my mind. <BR> <BR>Now, Fleischman was too far in the past to have benefited from the findings of Javal concerning how we read (and certainly not those of Bouma), so he couldn't have known any of the empirical things we know today. On the other hand, he could very well have been smart enough to figure things out -at least on a qualitative level- on his own. It really doesn't take much brains to realize that information arises from contrast, and the part of the lc &quot;d&quot; for example that conveys the most information is the ascender - for that reason you would make the body smaller (as he has). And you might give the &quot;o&quot; a different stress. And you might make your head serifs larger than the foot serifs. Things like that. <BR> <BR>But of course I can't be too sure about what's in the head of a man who worked three centuries ago&hellip; <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, all I've seen of Emile Javal is indirect, referenced by pretty much anybody interested in reading. As for Herman Bouma, his research is readily available through books and papers, if you have access to a good library (especially one with ILL capability). Unfortunately though, Bouma is now retired, and he never distilled his findings into one neat package. For a superb single work, check out Taylor &amp; Taylor's &quot;The Psychology of Reading&quot;, 1983. <BR> <BR>Mainly: <BR>- Towards the end of the 19th century, Javal established that reading proceeds in saccades (jumps), not a flow. <BR>- In the 1970s and 80s, Bouma clarified the ways in which we generally read word-shapes (or actually, letter-clusters), as opposed to complining words from recognized letters. <BR> <BR>What this means for instance is that an x-height can indeed be too large for optimal readability (even though it might be great for seeing an individual letter). <BR> <BR>Also: <a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/ss_read1.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/ss_read1.html">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/ss_read1.html</a></a> <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

BTW, this would include MS's own Bill Hill, who [re]invented ClearType based on the bouma model. Note how small Berling's x-height is, for example. But really, if you want a [non-retired] guy who really knows his stuff, try to get O'Reagan. I have to say that giving only the minority view to ATypI attendees does a deep disservice to the craft. The last thing we need now is a return to obese x-heights! <BR> <BR>If Larson is basing his conclusions on measurements concerning reading on-screen, then I would simply point out that speeds are much lower there, exactly because it's a lot less immersive!

		<div class="commentbody">Kevin Larson was hired by Bill Hill, so I would be very surprised to find their views so at odds as you suggest. <BR> <BR>I think you are, typically, reacting too quickly to a <i>blurb</i> for Larson's presentation. Why not wait until you actually know and understand what he is going to present and have seen the evidence on which he is basing his conclusions? I suspect, even in reading his blurb, you are probably missing the subtlety implied in what he says. It seems to me that he is looking at the question 'How do we recognise words?' Which is not the same thing as questioning <i>whether</i> we recognise words and groups of letters as the primary units of reading. He is investigating how we recognise those primary units and his evidence suggests that it is not by the <i>outline</i> of those units but by their components. I don't know any more than you do what the details of this presentation will be, so why don't we wait and see? I simply brought the presentation to your attention because it is relevant to the discussion that has evolved in this thread. I'll be perfectly happy to discuss it in detail <i>after I've heard it</i>. One thing I'm pretty sure of though is that Larson is not advocating a return to massive x-heights.</div>

Linotype only had to be concerned with their own linecasting machine. I've used Adobe Caslon letterpress and it worked out well, but it just seemed to lack the character of metal type. <BR> <BR>Is the Linotype variation on the x height due to sizing changes or baseline shifts? The latter were quite characteristic of smaller text sizes in machine composition, both Linotype and Monotype. Never did find out the rationale for this, whether it is a concern for readability or a technical situation. <BR> <BR>There would have been a natural restriction as to how tight a Linotype could space due to the natural boundary of the metal matrix. Adobe didn't have this restriction; most digital type seems a bit tight. Problematic when you go to letterpress with it as you risk &quot;ink bridges&quot; (between very close characters) developing during the editioning.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">gn <BR> <BR>Significant changes in technology tend to allow for different &quot;creative&quot; approaches. If the Linotype technology restricted the ability to set characters tightly and the photofilm technology of the 60s, 70s, and 80s allowed one to set extremely tight; these approaches need to be understood as historical developments and not taken out of context. Digital technology follows a different path and yields a different aesthetic. If work from the 70s appears &quot;fresh and exciting today&quot; that is simply because digital technology allows us to mine the past. This is less a retro thing than the result of technological change; we've seen these before: with the introduction of wood type and the changing of the way type foundries marketed their wares in the nineteenth century, with the introduction of machine composition and the revival movement in the early twentieth century, with photofilm at mid-century&hellip;. typefaces from different times and different places proffered up together. Part of the confusion here about Caslon is that the various permutations of it are being taken out of historical context. You really can't qualitatively compare a letterpress designed typeface and a digitally designed typeface, for instance, without a consideration of how they were to be used or are to be used.</div>

Is this primarily due to the roller getting ink slightly on the sides of the face, and then getting picked up when pressed into the paper, or is ink actually squeezed out from the face?

		<div class="commentbody">William <BR> <BR>To some extent you are encountering both. Each time you pull a print you are taking ink off the form but not all of it. Increased impression beyond what is adequate for the inking of the form, incorrect roller height adjustment, natural variability in ink charging, accumulation of ink deposit on rollers and type, all contribute to the problem. Differring paper surfaces will contribute widely to the problem as well. <BR> <BR>Fine printers might clean the type form of accumulated ink fairly regularly during an edition run but this would be a rare occurrence in commercial work. Unattended, the problem will increase during the run. Since the ink is quite viscous it will draw other ink to it, so any ink that begins to accumulate outside the definition (outline) of the letterform will increase. Sometimes this ink is being pushed there by roller action, other times by the incorrect application of ink by the operator (too much ink for the form) or a combination of both.  The ink is clinging not only to the edge of letterform but also is drooping somewhat down the bevel. Once this happens there is little recourse except to clean it off. Though metal typefaces often have ink drains built into the bevel, this would not really help that much with sloppy presswork. <BR> <BR>Specifically, if the rollers are incorrectly low they will push down too hard on the type and add ink to the outline but this might not be uniform as it would have to do with the relative weight of the letterform (serifs might take the brunt of it), the actual configuration of the form (the lone edges of longer lines or isolated words might be hit harder), as well as the rolling direction of the rollers (vertical vs horizontal movement causing a distorted accumulation). <BR> <BR>Did this address your question? <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">William <BR> <BR>One last point to this perhpas. I recently scanned an obscure metal typeface with the intent of digitizing it and in the process I have noticed something that might not have been dealt with.  <BR> <BR>Chank or someone has a tutorial on typeface design that essentially reveals that pieces of letterform constructs are used over and over again to form the composites of the various letterforms. A time saving device that I assume, as I get into this now, must be a fairly standard practice in digital typeface design. <BR> <BR>Problem is, this metal typeface, which has some pedigree, doesn't follow that technique. Every character has a bit of slight alteration to it. No cut and paste technique available then I guess. <BR> <BR>So, maybe that is another reason why you see a nice variability to older metal based typefaces that you do not in digital revivals??? <BR> <BR>Gerald</div>

I think this is unquestionably one of the factors in the different look of metal and digital.  <BR> <BR>I think there is some valid analogy here to a tune in music. I read or heard somewhere that music has to be something like 50% repetition and 50% variation. (I may have the percentages wrong.) The idea is that without the repetition, there is just a string of notes, and no tune.

Worn type, battered type, unclean type, linty papers, faulty make readys, soft packing etc. <BR> <BR>Lets not forget work ups.
