  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I was wondering: what ideas do you have about a typeface before you begin drawing it? Obviously the basics will be there, sans or serif etc., but how much detail do you go into? Do you know in advance how much contrast you want, what sort of terminals you want, or does most of that come as you work? I know this probably differs for everyone, but I'd be interested to see where the common ground - if any - lies.</div>

I usually start from one or two characters that have been sketched in my notebook or on a scrap of paper (or sometimes a shape that emerged playing in Illustrator. So, I have this one character, and I start building around it. As I make more characters, I might realize that the weight of the stems has to change. Nothing is set from the beginning and the glyph that started it all might not even make it into the finished design.

I do try to pin down the details as quickly as possible, so as not to have to redraw glyphs too often.</div>

Yes, in my case. Like I said, I'm not a professional typographer. I make type just for my personal pleasure. I don't turn every logotype I've designed into a typeface, of course.

I'm not talking about creating a wide family of text face overhere, just another silly looking typeface you could find scattered on the internet. Being staggered is really unnecessary. :)

The answer is 'yes' if you're asking to curious peoples like me. :)</div>

:-) I think I'm of the opposite sort; I tend to over-think concepts and have trouble actually getting started. That said, I do think it's a good thing to have at least a semi-solid concept before starting out &ndash; at least basic things like intended use / target point size, serif size/shape (if applicable), basic proportions, and something like the "feel" the whole thing should have. 
But I'm just starting out designing type, so this process is still very much under construction (and will likely remain so for the years to come ;-) ).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, so far most of my fonts have been more of a weekend or two scope.

I've been working on one whole typeface (something appropriate for hobbits, is my current opinion) that has pan-European glyph coverage, regular, bold and italic fonts and it all stated with a capital 'H' I doodled on the metro one day.
I mean, you have to start somewhere, and for me- designing type without a brief, it starts in my notebooks. I don't think I have anything significant to add to the world of text fonts yet, so for me- the more ambitious project I've undertaken- which may last a year, has mostly been an exorcise undertaken to learn all the parts that need to go into a complete typeface and to try and work out an efficient workflow (hint: not the way I've been working) </div>
