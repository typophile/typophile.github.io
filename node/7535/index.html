		<div class="commentbody">According to Martin Kotulla, I think SoftMaker is finally creating an all-new exclusive typeface design, an actual clone of Doyald Young&rsquo;s best-known script typeface (recently released as Home Run Script-roman), which is called &ldquo;H785 Script&rdquo; (numbered from Homer, featuring both the uppercase and lowercase character sets, the same as Home Run Script-roman; however, the numbers look quite original, the @/at symbol is not inverted, and that the Euro Symbol and some math symbols look different, although the rest of the characters have their glyphs kept intact).   This font name is appearing on both the &ldquo;MegaFont XXL 3.0&rdquo; and &ldquo;infiniType 4&rdquo; premium-quality typeface collections from SoftMaker, which were both being released around May 27, 2014.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Eric, <BR> <BR>Beautiful and ambitious! I like it. The style seems consistent and  <BR>for the most part well done. I'm also a large admirer of Doyald  <BR>Young's work. A few comments: <BR> <BR>1. Overall I think the general swash shapes are working,  <BR>Consider adding a second swash element that begins in the loop  <BR>below the D, parallels the other, the crosses to curl into the  <BR>white space below the ld to improve balance. Make sense? <BR> <BR>2. The D. I'm not fond of the top curling in and the bowl curving  <BR>in also. Consider trying the bowl crossing over the stem and  <BR>connecting to the stems tail (echoing the y).  <BR> <BR>3. The y is too narrow and poorly spaced between the o and a.  <BR>(tough to kern a pencil drawing &ndash; exacto!). Not sure the ball  <BR>terminal fits. Nice detail in the slight bulge on the right side. <BR> <BR>4. The modulation in the l is uncertain. Actually, the modulation  <BR>in general is a little inconsistent, but not incredibly so. It's the  <BR>danger of drawing a script with a pencil. You have to know  <BR>exactly how you'd draw it with a pen or brush. I know Young  <BR>uses a pencil for his scripts, as did Benguiat when he drew  <BR>Edwardian Script. I don't have this expertise, but something  <BR>seems off. Try to picture the draw of the nib as you apply  <BR>pressure down and release going up, and the angle that your  <BR>wrist can feasibly make, will it take one or two strokes etc&hellip; Did  <BR>you have a model you were working from? Kinda sounded like  <BR>you chose not to. Even if it's not close look at something to sure  <BR>up your modulation.  <BR> <BR>5. Maybe wrap the top of the d a little more to echo the swash tail. <BR> <BR>There are some flat curves in here, but that can be remidied. <BR>This kind of thing is really tough. I'm impressed. I notice you are  <BR>in LA, is this a class for Doyald? Looking forward to seeing the final. <BR> <BR>Randy</div>

		<div class="commentbody">That's a huge improvement. And it was excellent to start with. <BR> <BR>So here are my two bits: <BR> <BR>The first D is sloped too far. It looks to me like it's being forced out of the way by the y's swashing tail. Which isn't very nice. It also very closely resembles an infinite symbol. Try straightening the stem a bit and raising the intersection point.  <BR> <BR>Also, I have to point out just how phallic the D in your first effort is. You might want to save that for a more provocative typeface. Perhaps titled &quot;ID&quot; or &quot;Freudian Thoughts.&quot; <BR> <BR>The bottom of the bowel of the second &quot;d&quot; begins to thicken too soon and too fast compared to the &quot;a.&quot; <BR> <BR>Maybe thicken the second arm of the &quot;y.&quot; <BR> <BR>Gorgeous script. <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Personally, I prefer the second floating swash (if anyone knows a name more proper, please inform my ignorance of it).  <BR> <BR>I was just wondering if you couldn't use the shape of the D from the first picture to drop down into that swash. <BR> <BR>However, the first picture does have more focus on the word itself. The second one has such a repetition of that curved right line that it motivates your eyes into its direction. It reminds me of sound waves. <BR> <BR>If you don't like the effect, try cutting the fat out of the bottom. Those swashes are much thicker than the top letterforms. <BR> <BR>Also, the back of the &quot;a&quot; should technically be thicker. I believe it would fall on the wider angle of the pen, and follow through slightly into the ligature between the &quot;l.&quot; I could be mistaken, though. <BR> <BR>Either way, I still prefer the extra swash. And I like the extreme thick thin difference.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Eric, <BR> <BR>As a matter of personal taste I actually prefer the original post. It's unusual to see a low(er) contrast, formal script. <BR> <BR>Looking at formal scripts that include swashes and flourishes, is seems the lower case in particular is pretty locked in it's modulation axis. The caps have a bit more variation as needed, and the flourishes often vary considerably. <BR> <BR>For example in your 11/7 2:59 post, the flourishes seem to follow the axis of the roman too much yielding too much up and down motion. The original brings more horizontal push which is nice. Also in this example, the one-sided a and one-sided l look week in combination. <BR> <BR>Basically, I'd go back to your original drawing, and focus on: <BR>1. Getting the D to feel comfortable. <BR>2. The y wider, as in later versions, but make sure the right is thin (!) swelling smoothly, but quickly at the end to finish (more like the teardrop, just finishing in a point) &ndash; I'd keep it at x-height too). <BR>3. Working on the l. Understanding that the orignal style is quite different that what I'm about to point too, I still think this form could work (<a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/hogarth-script/hogarth-script/testdrive.html?s=Doyald&amp;p=72" target="_blank">Hogarth</a>). Note how it doesn't actually connect as yours does, it begins higher. <BR> <BR>One other note, I think generally, the thicks in your flourishes should be slightly thinner than the thicks in the text. Put the emphasis on the word. See Bickham for example. <BR> <BR>Oh, and I agree that the second flourish is a little busy. Keep pushing! I applaud you for sticking to a pencil and your brain. It lets an idea remain an idea and not straight jacket you into a bad idea because it looks &quot;final.&quot; <BR> <BR>R</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Eric <BR> <BR>The D in the 8:31 post looks much more dignified now. <BR> <BR>Hrant is right about the 'a' and 'o' becoming too similar. However, I think flattening (or cutting diagonal) the top of the a's stem while bringing the point slightly closer would fix it. I'm looking at your first drawing which doesn't seem to have the problem. <BR> <BR>I'm not sure why Randy doesn't like the 'y' going above x-height. It increases the y's character, in my opinion. I'd even suggest raising the left side too. But you do need to carry a thicker stroke out of the arm of the 'y' so the left side arm runs into the right side. <BR> <BR>I like Randy's suggestion for the 'l.' It does look more standard than the other letters. <BR> <BR>As for the 8:42 post: the D is so much more original to me. I was thinking that besides straightening the stem, the first D would do better to not have the top wrap in on itself. I know everything else is more round, but it becomes much more recognizable if the top of the D goes back straighter, with only a slight curve. <BR> <BR>The D is definitely worth another try or two. <BR> <BR>My preference is still for the second flourish and the 8:42 post is intriguing to me. That post is also a good reminder of why kerning is so important with scripts. It reminds me of the <b>Walg reens</b> I have to pass everyday on my route to work. But that's for the Critique Board. <BR> <BR>Well, we're coming at you from all angles here. I'd be more willing to give up the second flourish if the original D, with changes, slipped back into the picture. To my eyes, with the work you're basing this off of, the thins increase Doyald's elegance.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">thanks for all the comments from everyone. even though I'm not sure I agree with everything (nor do the different opinions agree with each other), it has given me a lot to think about and try. I'm going to try at least one more version before my class today at 5:30. I'll try to do 2 if I can. <BR> <BR>I really like the simplicity of just one flourish beneath the word; I've tried adding a second one two seperate times, and I wasn't happy with it, so I'm going to stick to one. Also, I think I prefer the original D, or some modification of it. Since I'm not truly designing a font here (more of a logo, I guess) I think I can take certain liberties with the characters.  <BR> <BR>I should have another version in an hour or 2 <BR> <BR>eric</div>

I think it balances out the flourish on the other side, which extends past the lc &quot;d&quot; <BR> <BR>I think the y is improved; the angle is more consistent with the other letters and the right arm transitions better into the flourish. <BR> <BR>The a is pretty good, looks much more like an a than an o, and the weight on the right side is more consistent with the d. <BR> <BR>Not sure about the l. I tried to straighten the left stroke and bulge out the right one. I liked that about the Hobart l. I think the bulge on the right size echoes the ascender of the d as well. I still wanted the l to connect to the a, though. <BR> <BR>The D could probably still use some finessing.

		<div class="commentbody">Eric <BR> <BR>I love it. My eyes just float around and around it, like a roller coaster. <BR> <BR>I'm glad you stuck with the D. The angle of its stem no longer bothers me and it fits so much better with the rest of the script. <BR> <BR>The real problem is that 'l.' The thick side needs to curve more. It's too straight compared to the 'd' and the flourishes. <BR> <BR>That is a simple solution. <BR> <BR>I'd also like to suggest to you a more drastic change with the 'l.' The first example I found was <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/roundhand/"> Roundhand</a> by Mr. Snell and Mr. Carter. <BR> <BR>Of course, that's not the best example for this script, but if the 'l' became just a simple solid curve, matching the 'd' but slightly flatter, I think it would compliment your script. <BR> <BR>I think you're doing a wonderful job of taking suggestions from us while finding solutions of your own. <BR> <BR>DeWitt</div>
