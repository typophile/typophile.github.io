body: "I feel as if this font must be helvetica neue but then is there alternative
  glyphs that give round circles as the dots in the lowercase \"i\" or punctuation
  marks? The lowercase \"a\" seems like it is different. The bold version looks like
  a different font. I took the picture from the H&M store ads because I felt it looked
  like helvetica neue thin/ultralight but I didn't know they had round alternatives
  or is it just editing via something such as illustrator? Or is this a real font?\r\n\r\nI
  couldn't insert the image as it did nothing when I chose the image so instead I've
  attached it. Thanks for all the help!\r\n"

  body: This is not Helvetica Neue. It is a custom drawn typeface for H&M called HM
    Ampersand.

  body: "It looks like it is based on News Gothic/Trade Gothic, but more geometric.
    [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/bentonsans/|Benton Sans]] is a contemporary
    take on the genre.\r\n\r\nAnother face with traces of both geometrics and grotesques

  body: Ah thanks! Is there a way to buy or get this HM Ampersand font? It just looked
    similar to Helvetica Neue thin/ultralight to me which are the two weights that
    I like the most of that font. Thank you for answering asking here is better than
    anywhere I've asked before about fonts. I really appreciate it, thanks! I actually
    have so many fonts I want to identify. Thanks again!

  body: "I already mentioned Graphik. It has a lot of similarities, although it is
    based on the European Neo Grotesque genre \u2014 whereas HM Ampersand is based
    on its American counterpart: the Gothic.\r\n\r\nGraphik also have a wide selection
    of weights, and [[http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/genres/extra_light_grotesquegothic_sans_serifs/|here\u2019s
    a list of extra light Gothics/Grotesques]].\r\n\r\nI do not know of any News Gothic/Trade
    Gothic variants with round tittles and punctuation."

  body: Thank you! Do you know how or what I would type to search for typefaces that
    are related to what HM Ampersand is based on? Would it be categorized as American
    Gothic, the Gothic? Or what would I call that style? Your help was greatly appreciated!
