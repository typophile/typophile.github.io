  body: "OK Chris. I'll treat it as a logo.\r\nThis could be made by editing Neue
    Aachen Std Bold Italic http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/neue-aachen/\r\nFor h,
    modify the lhs by clipping the base serifs, modify the rhs by replacing the bottom
    of the stroke with a copy of the bottom of the stroke on t. For i, do the same
    replacement. For s, narrow the terminal width by perhaps one-third. For w, use
    a copy of the new i for the lhs and extend the tail in a sweeping stroke upwards
    at about 45 degrees, repeat for the center stroke and clip off the upper serif,
    draw a new rhs stroke.\r\nAll this is unncessary if someone finds a match.\r\nDon\r\n\r\n\r\n"
