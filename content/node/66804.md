  of Art & Design. I'm taking some time to refine a typeface that I created a year
  or so ago. I know it's rough, but I'm looking for all the help I can get. I would
  be grateful to hear any and all criticisms. I have not yet had any formal training
  in type design. This is a learning experience for me. Thanks for looking.\r\n\r\n<a

  body: "Sorry I don't have time to go over your font more thoroughly.  Let me give
    a disclaimer: I have no more experience than you (probably less).  But if this
    were my font, I'd pull in the top terminals on lower-case and capital 's' and
    lower-case 'a' a bit.  I'd also make 's' and 'S' a bit more narrow; it doesn't
    seem right to me for 's' to be wider than 'e', for example.  '3' and '5' strike
    me as top-heavy and the bottom stroke of the '7' extends too far to the left,
    giving the impression that it may fall over. Finally, it would be nice to see
    a PDF with some running text.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, though, it looks like a very
    solid start to an interesting project.  Good luck with it!"

  body: "Hi riley. I'm a student, too. Also working on my first typeface for some
    time now. ;)\r\n\r\nI really dig your typeface and it's grotesk feeling. Reminds
    me a of DIN Mittelschrift for it's nice rough impression. \r\n\r\nLooks like you
    you allready compensated optical illusions (thicker verticals, etc.) but some
    of them are still there. On 'v', 'w', 'x', 'X', 'y', 'Y', 'Z' and 'z' some diagonal
    strokes look thinner then others. Especially 'Z' and 'z' show this effect. If
    you want to keep the thinner lines you should maybe put more contrast into this.
    Plus horizontals of 'z' are usually thinner than the diagonal stroke, even if
    it's different when drawing the letters by hand. In your 'z' it is the other way
    round (optically).\r\n\r\nI'm not sure about the ending of your 'a' as this form
    is unique and does not appear anywhere else in your font. \r\n\r\nI agree with
    aric, the proportions of '3' needing more efford. '3' and '8' are build somehow
    similar so maybe you can build your '3' out of '8' for keeping your proportions.
    \r\n\r\nI assume you haven't done final metrics yet. In case you did, you need
    much more space between your vertical strokes (see 'lm' in belmont). Would be
    nice to see a pdf with body copy in this font.\r\n\r\nI hope you keep us updated
    about this! :)"

  body: My thanks to both of you. I'm currently drawing a more condensed version with
    your suggestions in mind. I'll post them very soon. Cheers!
