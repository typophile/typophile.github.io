  dont understand polish. \r\n\r\nAnyone know another site wher ei can buy it from?\r\n\r\nthe
  name of the font is: \r\n\r\nRittswood Rozania\r\n\r\n\r\nThe site looks a little
  like a webtemplate site that offers others fonts for charge, so maybe it also goes
  under a different name and foundry?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthx. from insearchof. "
