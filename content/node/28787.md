  who offers internship to current students to get hands on experience in type design.
  I'm very much interested in type/typographic design and thus looking for the same
  kind of work. \r\nIm comfortable in both static as well as motion design. Right
  now i have almost 8 months to go for my internship ..but i think this is the right
  time to start searching. \r\nI'll be greatfull to you if some one can help me to
  find out the right place for me.\r\n\r\nI can send my portfolio/resume if someone
  interested.\r\n\r\nsatya\r\nStudent, Graphic Design\r\nNational Institute of Design\r\nAhmedabad,
