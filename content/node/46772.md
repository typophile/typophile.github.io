body: There's a logo I can almost... almost see in my mind's eye, but can't quite
  remember it. The font is a condensed, bold, unicase sans serif, lower- and upper-case
  all the same x-height, just one word, strong and contemporary. Does this ring a
  bell for anyone? I'm also remembering that the company name began with "f"--but
  I could be wrong. Many thanks in advance.
