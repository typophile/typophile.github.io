body: "I was asked to clean up a booklet for my company, but unfortunately its design
  is justified text with a fairly short line length. I'd love to redesign the whole
  thing, but it needs to be done and published in a couple weeks, so I'm left doing
  damage control.\r\n\r\nI've twiddled with the justification and even the hyphenation
  in hope of fixing the letter and word spacing with some success, but it's not good
  enough yet. I was wondering if anyone here has any suggestions for possible typefaces
  that handle justification better, or even settings I haven't thought of. Thanks
  in advance."

    only so much you can do with justified text and a short line length. It\u2019s
    going to be a matter of all factors, but the typeface itself is probably the least
    of them. \r\n\r\nThe words themselves often dictate the viability. With a short
    measure, if they don\u2019t fall right, there may not be a lot you can do, short
    of rewriting."

    lines its giving us ugly rivers.

  body: 'Well, a narrow typeface can help you, and more hyphenation. Another way to
    get up letter and word count in the line is to go with a smaller type size. How
    much leeway you have to get a decent result depends on what already have: the
    measure of your line, the length of the lower case alphabet in your font, and
    the size of type, among other things. As Kent wrote, you have to get into the
    details to see what can be done. '

  body: "You need to do a lot of manual work with your paragraphs, not automatic stuff
    from a menu. At newspapers (which is where I've got my Indesign training) we've
    practically only got short line length justified text to work with, and we do
    a whole bunch of stuff to alleviate rivers. Some of these may be unacceptable
    in more complex settings, but here are some tricks anyway:\r\n\r\n* Rehyphenate
    manually. A lot of rivers can be made to disappear if you just switch hyphenation
    one syllable forward or backward. \r\n\r\n* Ever so slightly fiddle with tracking.
    Up to 15/1000 of an em (some say 30/1000) is basically not noticeable for the
    naked eye unless you're really looking for it. You'd be amazed how much difference
    those little changes make. Absolutely don't overdo this, though, going over the
    limit it starts to be really visible. Oh, and only do it to whole paragraphs at
    once.\r\n\r\n* As a last resort, Rewrite! No writer in the world (except possibly
    Giles Coren) is going to remember which particular word order they used, or exactly
    what adjectives went where. If you're reasonably stylistically confident you should
    be able to pull this off on the sly."

    as you, the designer, would want to be consulted if a team member decided to change

    different. Perhaps newspapers operate that way due to the extreme deadlines, for
    example.  But your original comment mentioned doing it \"on the sly\", which implies
    that the writer would would not regard it as s.o.p and would be upset.\r\n"

  body: "Well, paragraph, you are right that there is a phenomenon that the excitement
    of novelty may temporarily blind people to something that really doesn't work
    aesthetically. But often the practiced eye will see through novelty alone, and
    that something is not well done.  \r\n\r\nThe tight-but-not-touching fashion came
    into being because it was possible for the first time with photo typesetting.
    I'm sure that for a lot of people, in addition to Ben Lieberman, the badness of
    things like that Royal Carribean ad\u2014which has a lot of touching by the way\u2014was
    also obvious at the time. \r\n\r\nOf course it may have worked OK at the time
    for the intended audience. But still, there were people who knew better. \r\n\r\nA
    more recent version of this was all the layering that went on in the 90s, with
    the grunge and other fashions. \r\n\r\nBoth tight display type and layering can
    be done effectively, but now we can see the difference between good and bad examples.
    \r\n\r\nBy the way, I thought at the time that platform shoes were idiotic, as
    they are both ugly and impractical. Now Lady Gaga is wearing them. Bell bottoms,
    wide lapels, and side burns I still don't see any inherent problem with..."

  body: "Ok, you're right I wasn't clear, so let me clarify. In general very tight
    letter spacing disrupts the balance of white space between letters with white
    space within counters. So evenness of color is hurt. And as a result I think readability
    is hurt and the texture of long or multiple lines of type get ugly.  \r\n\r\nHowever
    with display type of a few words, I think all bets are off as far as \"rules\",
    because it depends on the setting and the goal. In logos and advertising, the
    visual interest of the image of a few words becomes more important than readability,
    and you can sometimes get a more interesting or punchy image by tight, touching,
    unusual ligatures, rotated or woven together letters, distorting letters, etc.
    etc. With a few words, and even more so with a few letters, you can get an interesting
    image that coheres with all kinds of visual play. And tightening spacing is one
    of the simplest things you can do to increase liveliness and punch. But it often
    looks ungainly, and is still overused today, IMHO. But it certainly can be effective,
    and I'm sure you can find many good examples, with a few letters and words. Not
    with extended text. \r\n\r\n  "
