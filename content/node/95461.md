body: I am working on a new site about the intersection of law and technology that
  I expect will get quite a lot of press when it launches. It will essentially consist
  of one report, probably a couple thousand words long, with paragraphs of text, various
  heading styles, some bulleted lists and a graph and table with the results. I really
  think that the key to making this work is to choose the right typefaces, and I'd
  like to hire someone with experience in typesetting documents for the web. If you're
  interested, please post a reply with a link to some work you've done online.
