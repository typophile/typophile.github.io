  body: Well you could be right, my graphic memory might be letting me down.  I guess
    the face i was thinking of is more slanted/italic than this, but the descender

  body: Maybe you were thinking of <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/lanston_type/ltc_goudy_heavyface_italic_pro/">Goudy
    Heavyface Italic</a>? It has a similar style descender of the g.
