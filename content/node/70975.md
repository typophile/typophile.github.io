  that were used within old books (think of Moby Dick?) to show what fisherman or
  sailors faced back in their day. Or perhaps to tell a dramatic fictional tale.\r\n\r\nExamples
  would be sailors facing rough seas, turbulent travel, fighting off an adversary
  (large squid, etc.), but all developed as dramatic, detailed line drawings.\r\n\r\nReally
  hope that you know...been racking my brain and searching online for a while now!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJustin\r\n\r\n"

  body: Periodicals of the time might be helpful...although pictures of fighting off
    giant squids are apt to be few and far between. I seem to remember that Harpers
    Weekly has an online archive of issues dating back 150 years or so.

  body: How about Google Books? For Melville, for example, they have full view versions
    of Moby Dick, Omoo, Typee, and White Jacket, each with several drawings. Another
    example is [[http://books.google.com/books?id=qR0XAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=sailing&lr=&as_brr=1&cd=1#v=onepage&q&f=false|Sailing
    Alone Around the World]] by Joshua Slocum. Some books list illustrations in the
    TOC, others you have to scroll through. For inspiration as to titles, and a few
    included illustrations, try [[http://books.google.com/books?id=MU0qAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=A+collection+of+books,+pamphlets,+log+books,+pictures,+etc.,+illustrating&lr=&as_brr=1&cd=2#v=onepage&q=A%20collection%20of%20books%2C%20pamphlets%2C%20log%20books%2C%20pictures%2C%20etc.%2C%20illustrating&f=false|this.]]

    London Illustrated News for engravings.

    as he had had a few sailing adventures himself.\r\nHis book <em>N by E</em> recounts
    the tale of a trip he made to Greenland in the 1920s, including shipwreck, with
    100 of his woodcuts and beautiful typography."

    the illustrations date back to the 1800s, though. You can order their books online,
