    I haven't seen that, but most likely it looks like an average, market edition
    - althought is features illustrations and could be well designed.\r\n\r\nBut for
    some true Italian pieces of typography, and if you have some money to spend, Giovanni
    Mardersteig's books are what you have to look for. The <a href=\"http://www.stamperiavaldonega.it/Stamperia_Valdonega/eng/HomePage.html\">Stamperia
    Valdonega</a> hand-pressed editions are among the top-notch XX century books.\r\n\r\nAnother
    publishing house with an eye for good typography is <a href=\"http://www.ilpolifilo.it/\">Il
    Polifilo</a>, who also published a Mardersteig book.\r\n\r\nOther small, limited-edition
    Italian quality printers using movable types include <a href=http://www.talloneeditore.it/Inglese/introE.html>Enrico
    Tallone</a> and the delightfuly eccentric Pulcino Elefante by Alberto Casiraghi.
    \r\n\r\nOutside the limited edition books field, Einaudi's <a href=\"http://www.einaudi.it/catalogo/%28codSercollana%29/MIL/%28searchSessionKey%29/I%20millenni\">\"I
    Millenni\"</a> series of books still continues today a tradition of highly valuable
    typography."

    Aldus Manutius...
