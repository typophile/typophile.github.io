body: I&#39;m creating a large Unicode font &#40;1600&#43; glyphs, although many are
  composites&#41; with FontLab 4.5.2 under Win XP.  The font functions fine with Notepad,
  OpenOffice Writer, and InDesign 2, and also with TextEdit and Character Palettte
  under Mac OS X.  With Word XP and Character Map, a good number of the characters
  &#40;the last 200 or so I&#39;ve added, I&#39;d guess&#41; are just ignored.  That
  is, they do not appear in Word&#39;s Insert/Symbol, nor in Character Map.  If I
  type the hex value for one of these affected characters in Word, followed by Alt-X,
  I get a blank box.  This has gone on through a few revisions now and I need to get
  it fixed.  I&#39;d suspect a bad cmap, or that some Unicode values were set incorrectly,
  but then how does it work on certain apps?  I would appreciate any suggestions very
  much. <BR> <BR>David
