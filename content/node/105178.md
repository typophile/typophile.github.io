  body: "That is likely to be DIN Engschrift or it\u2019s (almost identical) East
    German TGL-sister. DIN 275 - Hausnummerleuchten (house number lights) prescribes
    the use of typefaces according to DIN 1451. DIN 1451-2 contains DIN Mittelschrift
    and DIN Engschrift, but the final drawings of the typefaces vary by manufacturer
    / supplier, whatever \u2026 \r\n\r\nIt may also be interesting to take a look
    at the twin-types Cst Berlin East and Cst Berlin West. They were designed by Ole
    Sch\xE4fer and Verena Gerlach in 2000 and are inspired by the typefaces as used
    on Berlin street name signposts.\r\nhttps://www.fontfont.com/fonts/cst-berlin-east\r\nhttps://www.fontfont.com/fonts/cst-berlin-west\r\n\r\nCalibre
    and Metric, designed in by Kris Sowersby \xB12010 are partially inspired on the
    same street sign typefaces: https://www.klim.co.nz/blog/metric-and-calibre-design-information/
    Calibre and Metric do not (yet?) seem to have the condensed weights you are looking
    for though.\r\n"
