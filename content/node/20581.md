body: "Hello\r\n\r\nCan anyone suggest a girlish font (could be a script) that has
  the vibe of a fairly sophisticated and moderately sexy, confident teenage girl?
  Not little girl silly like big circles or hearts over the i's, but older and more
  sophisticated -- hipper and a little edgy.\r\n\r\nNot retro, like a 1950s or 1960s
  script.\r\n\r\nCould look hand drawn.\r\n\r\nThanks for any ideas."

  body: That Cafe Mimi sure is nice! There's <a href="http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000018">
    Plumero </a> but it might be a little too scripty. Still, it's fun. There's <a
    href="http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=LFT2349400"> Gigi </a>
    too. A bit more upright, grungy.

  body: "I think you have to be careful of patronising people in this \r\nage group
    by avoiding cliches. You also have to remember \r\nthat most teenagers aspire
    to be older! \r\n\r\nI think Dalliance from emigre (www.emigre.com) is sexy, \r\nbut
    perhaps a bit TOO sophisticated. \r\n\r\nPerla from www.alias.uk.com has some
    really sexy alternates, \r\nand could work well as a headline face (I don't know
    exactly \r\nwhat it is you're designing).  \r\n\r\nIf only you could get you hands
    on Dederon from \r\nwww.typofonderie.com. I think that would be perfect, but\r\nunfortunately
    it's only for Beyonce's fashion line!\r\n\r\nPhil"

    the company that made it could change the name of it though. \r\n\r\ngood luck"

  body: "I've always considered the Scala family to be quite feminin. You can't get
    any more \"girly\" than the lower case \"p\". From what's I've noticed... a large
    percentage of female designers tend to go towards scala when using a post modern
    font in magazine and books. Would that not suggest that it has feminin qualities?
    \r\n\r\nPs. does anyone know if \"me\" magazine is using a scala slab serif? what
    is that font for titling? I might just post it in the ID forum.\r\n\r\nI think
    I just opened a can of worms. :("
