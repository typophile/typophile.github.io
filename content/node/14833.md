  finally decided to register.\r\n\r\nI am doing an identity for a group whose purpose
  is to promote creativity, in the form of the arts, music, etc. So I thought it would
  be cool/useful to see what you, the good people of Typophile, thought were some
  fonts that 'feel' innovative, exciting, and/or creative. I am not as knowledgeable
  as I would like to be on available typefaces, and I am looking to expand my collection,
  as well as find a good font to use as a starting place for this logo.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n-Nate "

  body: "i'd hafta say that fonts that <em>are</em> innovative will <em>feel</em>
    innovative. I think a good reference would be <a href=\"http://typographi.com/000969.php\">Typographica's
    list of favorite fonts for 2004</a>. These are all innovative designs in different
    ways. You're bound to find something that'll work for you on that list. Some personal
    favorites on this list: Auto, Andulka, Olduvai & Pill Gothic.\r\n\r\nI think typographica's
    list is due for an update sometime soon as well, so there will be new favorites
    posted in the next few days?\r\n\r\nan aside... you really love that Blue Island,
    doncha Hrant? why is that?"

    I realized its depth. Hopefully one day Jeremy will make the full OT version he's
    always dreamed of. BTW, the single most amazing use of Blue Island I've seen was
    in Huda AbiFares's \"Experimental Arabic Type\" - simply genial.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    Once you know the \"signature\" (written name like \"Coca-Cola\" or \"FedEx\")
    you (or we) can begin exploring possibilities.\r\n\r\nThink of the \"<a href=\"http://saltlake2002.paralympic.org/front_features/assets/ae_network.gif\"
    target=\"new\"><strong>A&E</strong></a>\" logo.\r\n"

  body: "<strong>My issue with Blue Nile is</strong> that it is so overly mannered
    and unique, that if you use it for an identity, and someone else uses it for an
    identity, you really end up lacking any form of identity at all.*\r\n\r\nThis
    is something find myself ranting about quite frequently. There is something to
    be said for a touch of neutrality in CI typography. Now if you were able to have
    exclusive license, or custom development of something like Blue Nile, you are
    in even better shape. But if this is available to all, then it is something I
    would strongly suggest staying away from.\r\n\r\n<em>*Let me know your address

    I get the creeps, because I know that the last thing they are really after is
    "creativity".

  body: The one key about using typefaces with a lot of character is to not use them
    direct from the can. I wouldn't shy away from a typeface simply because it might
    have too much character, but I would make sure its character supported the character
    of the company.

  body: "Tiffany,\r\n\r\nI am going to disagree with you (strongly) on this topic.
    I don't disagree with the type supporting the 'character' of the company -- that
    is a very basic aspect of any corporate identity. I still stand behind the idea
    of too much 'typographic character' in a publicly available font, used as a wordmark
    for a corporation/organization, as being a bad thing.\r\n\r\nI have witnessed
    multiple situations where this type of application has put the business in a very
    bad position.\r\n\r\n"

    in the Papyrus font. One is called Southland Florist, the other is Sally's Florist.
    This is a potentially very confusing identity for the consumer to digest."
