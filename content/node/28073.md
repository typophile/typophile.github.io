  body: "Nice catch, Patty. Here's a zoom from neopharmed.com (it's Flash, so there
    is some distortion):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SafariScreenSnapz001_6138.jpg]\r\n\r\nLooks
    like it could have been perhaps \"professionally\" stretched - as the strokes
    don't seem to be affected they way they would with a simple [[squooshed|squooshing]].
    There is also a custom 'A' with pointed apex."
