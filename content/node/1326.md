  body: It&#39;s interesting that in Jill&#39;s sample there&#39;s no trapping&#42;,
    while the original does have some - like in the &#34;W&#34;. <BR> <BR>&#42; Sorry,
    I can&#39;t help it!  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Either that, or it was printed out on an inkjet. Silkscreened onto vinyl.
    Photographed at close range with mad flash. Then scanned while moving the print.
    Perhaps a new method for auto trapping? <BR> <BR>That&#39;s not the prettiest
    alphabet ever drawn, is it? Kinda has a Danielle Steele quality to it :-&#41;  Jill
    great catch.

    digitization, used <BR>to be an Image Club font... <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.gettyimages.com/"
