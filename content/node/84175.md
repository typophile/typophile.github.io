  body: "In the 1950s, most commercial artists were trained to do display lettering
    by hand, so it's a distinct possibility this ain't a font. (The fact that the
    first and second <strong>BIG</strong> are identical might just mean someone drew
    it once and made a photostat.)\r\n\r\nIf it's a font, it's very likely a wood-type
    alphabet designed for poster use. If you must match it exactly, you might start
    by researching old wood-type alphabets. If it has been digitized, you may have
    some luck using keywords like <em>circus</em>, <em>carnival</em>, or <em>rodeo</em>. "

  body: 'Thank you for the input PublishingMojo! I will definitely do some research
    on the old wood-type alphabets. The only thing digital that I have seen that comes
    remotely "close" is Leathercrafter JNL by Jeff Levine and that''s a little bit
    of a stretch. As for now, if I do end up finding something I will keep you guys
    updated.    '
