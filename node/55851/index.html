<p>Don&rsquo;t know much about it unfortunately, it&rsquo;s a cafe in Brisbane, Australia. The people that manage the place didn&rsquo;t seem to want to help for some reason! I even bought an overpriced sandwich! Tried the free font identification websites but they didn&rsquo;t seem to prove successful. Any help would be much appreciated, even a similar typeface would help!</p>
<p>Cheers, Alex</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I agree with Simon about the Art Deco look, but this doesn&rsquo;t look familiar at all. Mark Simonson and Nick Curtis both hang out with specimen books from this era, and might have an idea. So far, I haven&rsquo;t found anything particularly close. It&rsquo;s an odd blend of serif, sans serif, and script.</p>
<p>Seems like it could be a good project for a font, because vertical &lsquo;script&rsquo; styles seem to always get a lot of attention.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Not that I thought it was particularly similar, but as an experiment I took Fluidum Bold and set the word Chelsea, then backslanted it 10 degrees. You can see how different the result is when you start with a script face, particularly considering the e, s and a. The cafe lettering is more like a backslanted italic that has been connected.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I have a theory that this is not a font, but a custom reworking of Bodoni and Bodoni Italic, with connectors added.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s why:</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working in the same genre for years - Jeanne Moderno (this week&rsquo;s typophile featured font! <a href="http://www.mehallo.com/introducing_jeanne/">http://www.mehallo.com/introducing_jeanne/</a> ) is sort of a similar approach; and about 10 years ago, my first attempts to &lsquo;straighten out a Bodoni Italic&rsquo; were simply killing the oblique angle and seeing what happens.</p>
<p>And it looked a lot like the Chelsea treatment, only messier.</p>
<p>Some of the vertical strokes in Bodoni are not always consistent - which is why the h and the l in Chelsea are tilting slightly to the left.</p>
<p>Then, in just de-obliquing, the rounded forms, such as the C, e and s really fall apart.</p>
<p>Then there is the decision: do I keep the dot-based terminals or not (in my fonts, I chose not to - it made everything look &hellip; dotty)</p>
<p>So here it looks like the designer chose to keep the roman Bodoni e and a - then work on adapting the dots to the roman C and s.</p>
<p>And if you look closely, you can see they are a Roman C and s with the italic dots added (with sort of bumps where they connect).</p>
<p>The script strokes could have just been added later - and they seem too custom in this use to be part of a font that was drawn this way.</p>
<p>So this looks - to me - like a custom job.</p>
<p>If it is actually a font, I&rsquo;d say the designer took an existing Bodoni, redrew parts and regenerated it. Which is a EULA violation.</p>
<p>One more:</p>
<p>There IS a straightened out Bodoni free font out there - I can&rsquo;t remember what it&rsquo;s called - that is similar to this, but it also has major problems in its rounded forms. Someone else may know what it is.</p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p>
<p>I kind of like this look, personally would want to eat there some day. :)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I see myself coming back to this forum alot. :)</p>
<p>Thanks for all the great replies, I certainly didn&rsquo;t expect anything like the sort of response I&rsquo;ve gotten so far!</p>
<p>After looking around at some fonts with bell terminals last night after I posted this I rediscovered Bodoni and started working with that. I&rsquo;m not much of a typophile.</p>
<p>I put Chelsea up on a grid once I&rsquo;d fixed the perspective from the  photo and I didn&rsquo;t even notice the left tilt on the &lsquo;h&rsquo; and &lsquo;l&rsquo;. Great find. :)</p>
<p>The food isn&rsquo;t to bad at all, I had a BLT on turkish bread with some lovely tomato relish!</p>

<p>A quick sketch I did for the project I&rsquo;m working on. This is for educational purposes, not for profit or anything just in case anyone was wondering.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if I should have put this in another thread, it&rsquo;s no longer an ID but if one exist it will sort of answer this question as well. I want to reproduce the missing letters not create my own face.</p>

<p>latest version. a few questions:</p>
<p>Is it okay that the &lsquo;S&rsquo; and the dot on the &lsquo;i&rsquo; is taller than the &lsquo;l&rsquo;? If not, how would you suggest fixing this up?</p>
<p>Should the ball terminal be a similar size on the &lsquo;r&rsquo; as to the dot on the &lsquo;i&rsquo;? Should the dot exceed the width of the &lsquo;i&rsquo; for balance or sit square?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Yes - and no. It&rsquo;s sort of designer&rsquo;s discretion. For the i, I would probably sit around for the longest time and move that dot up and down a bit, size it larger, then small then large again and again, moved right, then left then up then down until it just looked right.</p>
<p>Drawing this stuff is both mechanical and not. The not part is based on trusting your eyes - and if something doesn&rsquo;t look right, it isn&rsquo;t right. (something I attribute to Albrecht Durer).</p>
<p>My eyes say the dot is too low to the i, but if moved up - it might be too high. You just have to futz with it until it works.</p>
<p>My eyes also say the t needs to be taller and the cross bar needs to stick out more on the right. And the l is a hair too wide, it is standing out too much compared to the i next to it.</p>
<p>With the S, there&rsquo;s a few ways to look at this:</p>
<p>One, you&rsquo;re working with two different alphabets here. What we call &lsquo;upper&rsquo; and &lsquo;lowercase&rsquo; - and when using them together, one should either get the upper to match the lower more or take an initial cap (drop cap) approach: where the S is actually larger than the rest - as a beginning point for the word. The latter is the direction you&rsquo;re going in.</p>
<p>The other is to reduce the cap height of the S and let it flow better with the letters. The ascender on the l would then be taller than the S.</p>
<p>Want the ear on the g to match the r more. Look at some other lowercase g examples, there&rsquo;s some great ones out there. Bauer Bodoni comes to mind. :)</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re getting there - this one also takes into account white space, which is also very, very important. :)</p>
<p>And &hellip; last night I cooked this kale dish similar to a BLT. Your post made me hungry. :)</p>
