body: "[[http://typographyshop.com|TypographyShop]] has just released three new themes
  on four shirts. We polled our buyers and a few friends, presenting 9 ideas for new
  shirts.  By an overwhelming majority they chose [[http://typographyshop.com/make-the-logo-smaller-large-mens-t-shirt.html|\"Make
  the Logo Smaller]],\" followed by [[http://typographyshop.com/sans_m.html|\"Sans\"]]
  and [[http://typographyshop.com/serif_m.html|\"Serif]].\"\r\n\r\nOur respondents
  were split over whether the phrase \"Make the Logo Smaller\" should be quite small
  or very large, to drive home the point. So we decided to offer both.\r\n\r\nAll
  who responded expressed a great deal of enthusiasm for the entire range of designs
  presented and we plan on releasing new themes on a much more regular basis. For
  the past year we had a grand total of two designs available.  The workload at my
  firm, [[http://kinggroupmedia.com|The King Group]] was overwhelming, thankfully,
  and just keeping up with orders for TypographyShop was enough work without adding
  to it all with an extended line.\r\n\r\nNow that we've had a bit of a lull we've
  managed to jump back on the shop and are working on a proper redesign of the site
  complete with a merchant banking shopping cart  instead of the current PayPal system.\r\n\r\nWe've
  also got some big news involving several well known practitioners from the fields
  of design, web and type design. Look for designs by or homages to your favorite
  folks soon.  Part of the business model of TypographyShop is the donation of a portion
  of each sale to design education programs, so each of our guest designers will be
  choosing the recipient of the donation from the sales of their products.\r\n\r\nNext
  month we'll be having our first buyer's design contest. We've got some very talented
  customers, many of you among them.  I'm very anxious to see what they come up.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typophile509_4159.jpg]"
