  body: "Perhaps the designer used Optima Bold Italic and applied a horizontal expansion
    of about 120%. This would produce a general appearance similar to \"Sleep.\"  He
    could then have done a series of edits: straightened the vertical and cross strokes,
    converted some corners to arcs,  and sharpened the tips of the terminals.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OptimaBoldItalExpHoriz120Percent_4186.jpg]\r\nDon"
