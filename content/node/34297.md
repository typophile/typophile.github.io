  honor of Jan Tschichold. And in my quest for knowledge I found the ever so awesome
  Japanese magazine IDEA did a whole issue on Jan Tschichold it was actually, IDEA
  NO. 321 : Works of Jan Tschichold. If I wanted to order this from Japan I'm looking
  at $67. Does anyone know where I can pick up this issue in the states? I live in
  Las Vegas so my outlets here are pretty nill. S-O-S!\r\n"

    can see the site @:   http://checkofoto.com/tschi_sites/tschicholdindex.html   .
    Most of my class had no idea whom Se\xF1or Tschichold was so this was more or
    less a primer to hopefully gain interest not only in Tschichold but also in typography.
    I also did a Flash site in honor of Paul Renner. that one should be up before
    typecon. Comments are cool. Ciao, \u221A0"
