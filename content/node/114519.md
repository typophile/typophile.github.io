  body: Ryuk good call on Eras ITC, and I should have recognized Helvetica but it
    was squished and skewed so... thanks! It doesn't matter for my project, but just
    for kicks, the ", LLC" part is apparently a different font than the other two
    and I can't figure that one out either. But Helvetica Neue is what I needed, so
    thank you!!

  body: For the /LLC, I'm pretty convinced it's a Frankestein with /L from Helvetica
    Neue and /C from Eras.
