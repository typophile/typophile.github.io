    a printer, but not a web designer. A web designer is a professional designer just
    as you are and needs to buy his own font licenses to use them in his work."

  body: I think he means an outsourced printer(person) as opposed to a printer (hardware)
    in his office. I believe LHF used to have some way of preventing copies being
    made of their fonts and thus making it difficult to send out for a specific job.
    Best to contact LHF about your issue for printing. I believe the web designer
    would likely need to purchase the font as well. If you're just making images for
    the web as opposed to any kind of active web type you could create the images
    to your web designers specs and send those.
