  body: ' Todd - Kudos for crafting something special for this craft-related job.  <BR>
    <BR>A few things you might look at: <BR> <BR>&#42; the connectors coming off the
    u, d and l seem too different from each other. The &#39;itti&#39; works nicely
    because the connectors are uniform.  <BR> <BR>&#42; You might omit the connection
    between the &#39;p&#39; and the &#39;i&#39; and also consider omitting the connector
    between the d and l. <BR> <BR>&#42; the g on the middle design is sweet, but the
    other g fits in better. <BR> <BR>&#42; You might look at the inconsistent height  of
    the ascenders on the &#39;ddl&#39;   <BR> <BR>&#42; if your ascenders, descenders
    looped, it might look more...more homespun. <BR> <BR>&#42; The initial cap &#39;C&#39;
    looks too large in relation to the &#39;K&#39; <BR> <BR>&#42; Can any knitting
    tools be incorporated...can the descenders become loose thread? <BR> <BR>hope
    this helps. good luck. <BR> <BR>a few fonts that might work if the client suggests
    revisions -- P22 has a Needlepoint font, Dave Bastian has a font called Noodle
    Script, and My Fonts sells Coquette by Mark Simonson. <BR> <BR> <BR>bj '

  body: ' Sorry, this isn&#39;t specific, but your font seems too mechanical for me.
    I see a cutesey handwriting font being more fluid, with no harshness to it. '

  body: ' I guess since this is a logo for a website, I was going for cutesey, with
    a dab of tech. Which ended up making it a little more vertical/rigid than fluid.
    <BR> <BR>Yeah, I am going to tweak this logo a bit after the holiday here and
    post some new versions. Thanks for the feedback everyone. '

  body: ' I think the type choice is to thin and doesn&#39;t feel like knitting. I
    think of fat yarn and country style. tiny threads sticking out of a thick line...Something
    that is soft and cuddly. <BR>so a typeface that has some weight '

  body: 'It took me a while to get back to this logo, but by sorting and absorbing  <BR>all
    the comments above Ive come up with these three variations. Its actually  <BR>more
    of a progression. <BR>The first one: is similar to the originals except thicker,
    more yarn-like,  <BR>and I removed the connector on the p. The second: I started
    to make the  <BR>connectors and shape of the n&#39;s and u more uniform while
    leaving the varying  <BR>heights of the d&#39;s and l alone. I also added some
    breathing room. Third: I  <BR>just finished making the connectors and heights
    more uniform. What do you  <BR>think?  Todd <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/4148.gif"

  body: The thicker style looks a lot better and taking the connector off the p looks
    nice as well. <BR> <BR>I was liking the uneven ascenders on the d and l -- have
    you tried making the t&#39;s uneven? Crossing the t&#39;s at a slant if you do
    might help it not look so rigid/techy <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: For this logo I do like the uneven ascenders a tiny bit better. It makes look
    more hand crafted. <BR>I havent tried making the t&#39;s uneven, Ill give it a
    go to see how it looks.

  body: Thanks for the comments everyone. <BR>I see now that the first stroke of the
    u looks a bit too much like its owned by the C. But I dont want to detatch it,
    i like it connected. Im going to take a look and see how other script fonts finish
    their C&#39;s. <BR>Ill work on trying out some variations on the l and tt. Ill
    post the results. Keep m coming though. <BR>
