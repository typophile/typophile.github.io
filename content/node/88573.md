  on the web the usual symbol to represent elision in Latin poetry.  That symbol is
  something like a stretched-out breve, or a parenthesis symbol turned on its side,
  written below the space between the two elided words.  If possible--I don't expect
  this--the symbol should extend slightly below the word on each side.  A clumsy example
  using an image can be seen on the page at http://members.toast.net/prufrock/latinmeter.html.\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas, or good references I could go to?  I have looked around quite a bit, but
  so far have had no luck.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nClem"

  body: "Something like\u203Fthis?\r\nI am not familiar with Latin poetry, but Unicode
    has an \u2018undertie\u2019 (<a href=\"http://www.decodeunicode.org/de/u+203f\">U+203F</a>),
    which may or may not be the character you are looking for. You can use it by copying
    it into your HTML document. Will it shows up on the reader\u2019s screen? That
    depends, one needs to have at least one font installed that features this character.
    On my system, Arial Unicode, Lucida Grande, Courier, Helvetica and a couple other
    fonts do. Georgia does not, which is the reason why it might look off here on
    Typophile: With the current stylesheet, the letters are in Georgia, while the
    undertie is rendered in something else (for me)."

  body: "The undertie is used in IPA phonetic transcription to indicate the \u201Cabsence
    of a break\u201D. That means that there isn\u2019t the usual tiny pause between
    words that would otherwise be expected. Aert Kuipers and a few of his European
    students used it to indicate clitics in Salishan languages, whereas nowadays most
    people use the equals sign instead: s\u203Fqa\u0142 versus s=qa\u0142, both pronounced
    like [sqa\u026C] and not [s qa\u026C]. (I made this example up for illustrative
    purposes.) Clitics are elements that are word-like but not entirely independent
    words, usually because they can\u2019t be said alone. English examples are the
    <em>\u2019s</em> for possessives like <em>Phillip and Edwin and Alfred<strong>\u2019s</strong>
    apartment</em> and the <em>n\u2019t</em> for negation like <em>do<strong>n\u2019t</strong></em>
    \u2018do not\u2019 and <em>could<strong>n\u2019t</strong></em> \u2018could not\u2019.
    There\u2019s also the <em>\u2019d</em> for the \u2018would\u2019 clitic and <em>\u2019ve</em>
    for the \u2018have\u2019 clitic, e.g. <em>I<strong>\u2019d</strong>n\u2019t<strong>\u2019ve</strong></em>
    \u2018I would not have\u2019. All of these could be represented with the undertie
    in transcription, so /... \u0294\xE6nd \u02C8\u0294\xE6l.f\u0279\u025Bd\u203Fz
    .../, /\u02C8k\u028Ad\u203Fn\u0329t/, and /\u02C8\u0294ai\u032F\u203Fd\u203Fn\u0329t\u203F\u0259v/.\r\n\r\nI
    don\u2019t know much about Latin poetry, but I suspect that the IPA symbol probably
    derives from the Latin academic tradition. Hence it\u2019d be appropriate to return
    it to its Latin-usage roots."

    even for my everyday needs.<cite>\r\n\r\nI've spoken to Harry Parker (Mike's son)
    at Font Bureau. Their official position is the end user may modify fonts for their
    own use, AFTER Font Bureau has both seen and approved the modification. Approval
    is the key here. Some font manufacturers -- H&FJ comes immediately to mind --
    take the same official position, but will not even reply to a request.\r\n\r\nHarry
    also indicated that in keeping with the old Linotype position, expanded character
    sets may already exist. The old Linotype policy was that the original customer
    paid for the modifications. Anyone could then purchase them, but they were not
    advertised. This gave the person who paid for them a slight edge. Of course, this
    came about in days when type was not available on a personal computer; it makes
    rather less sense today.\r\n\r\nI don't know who actually owns Georgia. Mathew
    Carter drew it of course, and may retain the right to allow modification. But
    I suspect FB to be far more accommodating than H&FJ. It wouldn't hurt to ask them.
    \r\n\r\nYour choice, I suspect, would be to ask for permission to modify if you
    are willing to limit use of the fonts to yourself, or pay for the extra character
    sets if you want fonts which can be distributed.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nBy the way,
    for Greek poetry, the long breve is also needed. In a way, this discussion rivals
    the one on character sets for linguists. IIRC (and I may not) the needed characters
    only exist in Unicode in the combining diacriticals. Of course, they are not diacriticals,
    but if your desire is simply to put ink on paper or pixels on the screen, no one
    will know -- always assuming a device that will actually use your fonts."

  body: "hrant,\r\n\r\nThis is a long & involved topic. What my far from exhaustive
    research showed was that regardless of what the EULA says, the publisher may give
    permission to modify. IIRC, Adobe's EULA forbids modifications, but the same group
    of lawyers responsible for the EULA OKd the FAQs where permission is explicitly
    given.\r\n\r\nChristobal Henestrosa's EULA does give permission, if he is notified.
    I believe a few others, -- perhaps in the Village group? -- have something similar.\r\n\r\nAs
    a type designer, you have to consider markets. There are about 100 presses in
    the Association of American University Presses. Some are small, 3-4 book per year.
    Some, like Oxford, Cambridge, Yale, Harvard, Chicago, etc. publish a lot of books.
    Or at least we think so. Maybe not, when considering publshing as a whole.\r\n\r\nSecondly,
    90% of the characters needed are accented letters. Modifying the font to take
    care of these rids one of a nuisance. It is not needed, just a convenience. As
    an oddity, we can set Arabic or any of the Indic scripts in the original language,
    but setting the words romanized can be a nuisance. The window you have is there
    are enough words you don't want to do the work by hand, but not enough to write
    a script to take care of it. Small window.\r\n\r\nIt's when you get into needing
    characters like an eng that you can't (yet) do the work within a layout program
    such as InDesign. As you know, you can legally modify the hell out of a font in
    the layout program, and they are getting more tools all the time. Well, it isn't
    hard to make up a supplemental font, which you might need anyway to preserve syntactic
    integrity with some accented characters -- the accent characters like dot below,
    not the alpha/numeric glyphs. Again, nuisance value.\r\n\r\nEtc. etc.\r\n\r\nBasically,
    what I advise AAUP presses to do is to investigate carefully what the font publisher
    will allow before purchasing a font. Secondly, there are getting to be enough
    open source fonts that we as a group can combine our skills and make what we need.
    I've set a couple books with extensively modified open source fonts that got in
    he book show -- they are not all bad. This, coupled with Adobe's policy, and the
    smaller studios that allow modifications, will allow any needed work to get done.\r\n\r\nNow
    as I said, it is a small market, and probably its needs are not something any
    of you need to take into consideration for your livelihoods. Your only issue is
    whether or not there may be enough other such markets.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nBTW,
    over 50% of the work I do when \"modifying\" fonts is to work on the kerning.
    Again, to work in the font is a convenience, not a necessity.\r\n\r\nFrom my perspective
    \"no modifications\" is an attempt to stop piracy (which I abhor) that will backfire.\r\n\r\n"

    on this. The Georgia/Verdana Pro projects were a joint effort by Font Bureau and
    Ascender, with the blessings of Microsoft. And in fact, all of the Georgia expansion
    was done by the Ascender team, led by Steve Matteson. \r\n\r\nI believe that Microsoft
    still owns the rights and retains some control over both families.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t
    think that FB can grant permission for modifications to Georgia unilaterally \u2014
    and Ascender has since been absorbed by Monotype Imaging. So getting official
    permission for mods could be a sticky wicket.\r\n\r\nAlso, the \u201CPro\u201D
    designation was Ascender\u2019s initiative. FB doesn\u2019t use this designation
    itself. \r\n\r\nThe Georgia/Verdana Pro fonts cover the <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/WGL4.htm\">WGL4
