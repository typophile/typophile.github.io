  body: The concept of endnotes does not exist in InDesign. Essentially it only handles
    footnotes, i.e. notes on the same page. If you need the notes to be placed at
    the end of the chapter, or the book, you'll have to do it manually.

    suppose this is technically correct. Think of endnotes as part of the text stream,
    either a new chapter if end-of-book notes, or more text following a subhead (\"notes\")
    if end-of-chapter. The moral is you have some organizing to do in the files you
    import.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of situations with notes that make for a lot
    of work using InDesign -- or any layout program. We get five to six books per
    year that have two footnote streams, one numbered, one signaled by the asterisk
    sequence. We occasionally get a book with three notes streams -- alpha, numbered
    and asterisks.\r\n\r\nOr a book where the text is single column, but the footnotes
    are to be set double column. Or three languages (with footnotes) running parallel
    on a two-page spread.\r\n\r\nAll of these are infrequent, and you cannot expect
    any layout program to provide for them in any automatic fashion. They just require
    extra work. "
