  looking for a font like it with the style this set has for the numbers. Thank you.

    all the trimmings.

    &#40;ex: 1234..roman style&#41; but it is a personal project and I cannot spend
    much on the font. Thanks!'

    target="_blank"> Day Roman</a>? It has your numerals and <BR>even includes a second
    Expert font with ligatures and extras. The <BR>documentation is an interesting
    read. <BR> <BR>This typeface is quite different from Verdigris, but I&#39;m under
    the impression <BR>that you&#39;re simply after a nice serif text face with oldstyle
    figures. <BR> <BR>Another possibility is Tim Roland&#39;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/timrolands/envoy/"
    target="_blank"> Envoy</a>, which he&#39;s offering for a pittance. <BR><br>
