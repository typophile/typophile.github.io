		<div class="commentbody">Sebastian, I was fine with your direction until you added: &amp; IT Strategy. Why don't you also say: &amp; We take out the trash. You might do IT Strategy but if Visual Communications is the core business drop the &amp; IT Strategy, its just an add on. Plus visually the tagline disappears. I see you tried to compensate in a couple of versions by spacing out .Li, that doesn't work for me, it starts to fall apart.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hey all. Thanx again for all the feedback. In terms of the extended tagline, it wasn't my choice people! However, I will try to talk 'them' out of it. I also decided to go back to helvetica neue, condensed black. I feel that the other faces weren't quite bold enough against the 'chunky' '.LI'. Suggestions of a suitable typeface anyone? I've now narrowed it down to four versions. I'm still having a hard time deciding on outlined or not? Also, do you guys have any suggestions on the distance between the baseline of 'LI' and the tagline? Should it be based on the distance between the elements of 'LI'? (it currently is) I'm still working on the corporate colours, will get back to you on that one&hellip; <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>S. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/54342.gif" alt="final four"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">As for the distance, scale it down so that it's about 50 pixels tall.  if you can't read Visual Communications, adjust the size ratio between the logotype and the tagline as well as the spacing between the two.  The reason you want to do this is because the entire logo usually takes up 50 pixels with about 7 pixels white padding around the logo, usually being 65 pixels total on the web.  Of course, this depends on the design of the website, but this is very common and you want it to be readable at low resolutions as well as very high resolutions (like 1280 x 1024).  I think you want to avoid using different ratios for print and web.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">As you can see, the tagline is not very visible at low resolutions, which is not appropriate for websites (see all major corporate websites of all industries for verification of this concern).   <BR> <BR>You also cannot read the tagline from far away.  If the tagline is important for the business, which most are, it should be somewhat visible.  In many cases for new brands, the tagline is as important than the logo/logotype is seeing as people have not made the connection that &quot;.LI&quot; symbol means &quot;visual communications&quot;. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/54486.gif" alt=""> <BR> <BR>Again, you still might want to consider why you are using &quot;.li&quot;.  Maybe it's because your client/management says so, but I think it's a bad idea in a lot of ways.  Acronyms and shortforms usually made it harder for people to remember the brand.  People will not say &quot;Lee&quot; or &quot;Lie&quot; communications when they talk about the brand.  They just won't know what to call you and it'll be extra hard for people to make the connection with your old name (if they know it) and new people will be clueless.  Don't pick a shortform just because IBM and others have one.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">If you make it bigger than 65 pixels, it'll look huge at 800x600.  This is why most sites never cross that pixel barrier. <BR> <BR>I still think you should have Lindborg in the name.   I'm basically assuming that &quot;LI&quot; is the logo, not the name and that Lindborg should be somewhere. <BR> <BR>I think the mark itself is fine.  It gives the impression you want.  But a logo that is memorable is nothing if people don't have something to associate it with, i.e. a name.  There are very few brands that rely on the mark alone and it takes billions of dollars to make sure people know it.  For an abstract company like yours, you almost have to have the name in the logo.  If I started to call my company Upfactor as &quot;UF&quot; and used the same logo, that would confuse a lot of people.  It doesn't make a lot of sense since Upfactor is short enough and an identifiable name on its own.  In a way, I'd be making the brand worse by cutting it down.  I think you're doing the same thing.</div>
