  was born and raised in the small town of Joseph City, Arizona. \u201CI love the
  countryside,\u201D he says, \u201Cbut I\u2019ve always felt like a city kid at heart.\u201D
  \ He attended [[Brigham Young University|Brigham Young University]] and received
  his degree in International Studies. Paul got involved professionally in design
  when he took a job as a graphic designer for The Winslow Mail while still living
  in Arizona. Paul now lives in Buffalo, NY, where he works as a type designer for
  [[P22 Type Foundry|Lanston/P22]]. \u201CEver since I was young, I have been fascinated
  by art, language and culture. I guess it\u2019s only natural that these interests
  have come together in my love and practice of type design.\u201D\r\n\r\nTypedesigns
