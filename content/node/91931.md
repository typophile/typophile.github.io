  was mainly caused by economic necessity. The Gothic script is narrower, thus more
  space-efficient, thus cheaper to write in. However, it's development in the 11th
  century coincides with economic growth in Europe, making this theory unlikely. Also,
  it seems odd to use such a depressing looking script, when times are good. Gothic
  architecture makes much more sense in that way. Could anybody shed some light on
  this?\r\n\r\nCheers! jasper"

    \u2014 those slender and tall forms were quite to thing. Fashionable, in other

    quill than it does in economics. Vellum was not the greatest cost of a copied
    manuscript: labor was. Hence, prosperity paid more scribes, who wrote in the fashionable
    style. Had different, easily available equipment been available and a different
    style prevailed, a great many medieval manuscripts could just have well been written
    in Comic Sans.'

  body: All mature scribal cultures develop both formal and informal styles. The Carolingian
    minuscule had, however briefly, imposed a single uniform model which then diverged,
    predictably, into formal and informal styles regionally. The blackletter styles
    represent formalisation, a typical characteristic of which is the frequent lifting
    of the pen (contra the reversals characteristic of informal styles) and hence
    deliberate slowness that encourages care in the forming of the letters and their
    consistency.

  body: "@John Hudson: From my research, it seems the Gothic script became a more
    formal script some centuries after it came in to use, so this would not really
    explain the initial reasons for it's design, right? Please do correct me if I'm
    wrong :-)\r\n\r\nHere's my take in my essay:\r\n\r\nDuring the 11th century, Europe
    went through a period of high economic growth. As a part of the population got
    wealthier, the demand for books increased, pressurizing scriptoria to produce
    more books in less time. With an increase in demand came an increase in competition
    to not only produce books faster, but cheaper at the same time. This resulted
    in the development of a new script in France and Belgium, with a much more compressed
    and angular design than the previously used Carolingian minuscule. Due to it\u2019s
    economical width, this new script, later called the Protogothic script, required
    fewer pages to be used, bringing down costs spent on parchment, and making books
    lighter. The latter was especially important for the improved transport and storage
    of books, as one can imagine. Another advantage of the Gothic script was it\u2019s
    relative simplicity, making it easier to teach to the monks.\r\nAlthough uncertain,
    there seems to be a relation between the tall Gothic architecture and the tall
    (or narrow, depending on your viewpoint) Gothic typography. Fashion will always
    remain an elusive subject, so the precise reasons for this new design, other than
    it\u2019s economic functionality, remain unclear."

    some centuries after it came in to use.</em>\r\n\r\nBy my classification, all
    Blackletter styles are formal, because all are slow to write, all require frequent
    lifting of the pen, all favour consistency over fluidity, all are disconnected,
    all are upright... these are the classic characteristics of formal Latin book
    hands, contra informal, cursive hands. The process of development of 'protogothic'
    that you describe is a process of formalisation of the Carolingian minuscule,
    from a semi-cursive script featuring a lot of pen reversals and organic terminals,
    to a non-cursive script featuring a lot of pen lifts and constructed terminals.
    Consider: the Carolingian letter <em>n</em> can be written in two strokes with
    a reversal between them; the pen never needs to leave the page. A textura <em>n</em>
    requires a minimum of six strokes, with the pen lifted and repositioned between
    each stroke."

    that the formal script must be written more slowly than the cursive means that
    more care is taken: a scribe can easily produce page after page of consistent
    text in a formal style, which is the purpose of such styles. Formal hands are
    book hands."

  body: Thank you both :-) very convincing. Sorry to keep on asking questions, but
    I guess thats what typophile is for. Why would copyists chose a more formal (thus
    slower written) script in a time when te demand for books increased, requiring
    faster production?

  body: "In part, as Bert suggests, it is part of a larger aesthetic movement, about
    harmonising the appearance of text to the cultural context in which it is encountered.
    This is continuous factor in the development of new writing styles and, later,
    new typographic styles. [An area of research for me is the development of the
    'English Roman', which results in Baskerville's types, and which can most easily
    be made sense of in terms of trying to find a new model for text that harmonises
    with neo-classical applied arts.] Blackletter styles harmonise with the strong
    perpendicular and verticality of Gothic art and architecture, just as the Carolingian
    minuscule had harmonised with the softer and more curvaceous Romanesque forms.\r\n\r\nThe
    other thing to bear in mind is that, almost all the time, what you are going to
    see reproduced in picture books of mediaeval manuscripts are prestige volumes,
    and especially volumes intended for communal liturgical worship. The formal script
    is used because these are formal books."

  body: "Ok, I feel like I got it now :-) John, time to write a book perhaps? You
    seem to know a lot... In any case, thanks a lot. Do you mind if I mention your
    name in a footnote as a source for my essay?\r\n\r\nHere's my last version. Sorry
    for the long read.\r\n\r\nUntil the 11th century, the Carolingian minuscule was
    a relatively standardized script in Western Europe. It was a very elegant and
    legible script, still treasured for it\u2019s beauty by designers these days,
    but it\u2019s time to make place for a new script had come. This new script would
    later be known as the Gothic script.\r\nDuring the 11th century, Europe went through
    a period of economic growth. As a part of the population got wealthier, the demand
    for books increased, pressurizing scriptoria to produce greater volumes of books.
    With this increase in demand for books, the emphasis of a script\u2019s purpose
    came to lie more in the writing of books, which were seen as formal objects, as
    opposed to informal every day usage. This resulted into a formalizing process
    of the Carolingian minuscule. A typical characteristic of formal writing is the
    frequent lifting of the pen, thus writing slower deliberately to encourage greater
    care in the forming of the letters and their consistency. France and Belgium were
    the first to introduce a more formalized script, called the Protogothic script,
    in the 11th century. \r\nTo understand how the Protogothic script, as well as
    the Carolingian minuscule, was written, it is important to be aware of the tool
    used to write with. This tool, the \u2018broad-nip pen\u2019, is still used today
    to understand the underlying structures behind modern day typography. It was,
    and is, constantly held at the same angle of approximately 45\xB0, lifted of the
    parchment with every new stroke. The formalization of the Carolingian minuscule
    resulted in previously single-stroke curves, being replaced by several vertical
    and diagonal strokes throughout the alphabet. This gave the Protogothic script
    a much more angular design. This angularity, in turn, led to a much more compressed
    design, for curves take up more space than straight lines. [Picture of comparison
    between Carolingian minuscule and Protogothic script to come.]\r\nAlthough uncertain,
    there seems to be a relation between the verticality and perpendicular Gothic
    architecture and the Gothic script. Fashion will always remain an elusive subject,
    though, so our focus here is in the functional and cultural aspects of the design
    of scripts.\r\nDue to it\u2019s economical width, this new script required fewer
    pages to be used, bringing down costs spent on parchment, and making books lighter.
    The latter was especially important for the improved transport and storage of
    books, as one can imagine. Another advantage of the Gothic script was it\u2019s
    relative simplicity, making it easier to teach to the monks.\r\n"

  body: I should point out that the term 'Gothic' in this context is a bit problematic.
    It is a later term, mostly found in English sources, and is confusing because,
    of course, there was also a Gothic language with its own script and palaeography.
    I think the term 'blackletter' is better as a general category, and within that
    category care should be taken to distinguish the individual styles.
