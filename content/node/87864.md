body: "I found this beauty years ago in one of my old letter pressed books and since
  then I wanted to work with it, but couldn't find anything alike, so I redrew it
  and filled in the blanks (about 1/3 of the characters needed for English and German
  were missing). \r\n\r\nThis is the first draft (I'll call it Reverendissima), so
  there is still plenty of room for improvement, but before I go crazy with it: Does
  that font exist in digital form already or is it as much a find as I thought?"

  body: That's right. It's very similar. Probably an older variation of it. QRSTU
    are quite different though.
