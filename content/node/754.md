body: One of my colleagues heard a rumor that typographers could not generate fonts
  correctly when using Fontographer in OS10. I tried a search on Typophile and found
  a couple of specific issues, but not a general concern. I emphasis this is just
  a rumor and I hope I&#39;m not starting one! <BR> <BR>So for those of you using
  OX10, how is Fontographer working? Have you been forced to go back to an old OS?
  Or is this info lifted directly from the latest issue of &#34;Weekly World News&#34;?

  body: I haven&#39;t run across any issues with generating fonts under OS X, however
    Fontographer will not launch in the Classic environment of OS X unless you&#39;re
    using the non-FPU version of the application. There&#39;s more information in
    <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/fontographer/ts/documents/osxfog.htm">this
    tech note</a> on the Macromedia site. Quite frankly, when I have to use Fontographer,
    I simply boot into OS 9 - it&#39;s much less painful.

  body: I have an older Mac running OS9 that I use almost exclusively for Fontographer.
    My main Mac is running OSX, which I use for everything else.  <BR> <BR>As Grant
    said, it&#39;s possible to run FOG in OSX, but it&#39;s really not very happy
    there. It often quits unexpectedly when printing samples and working with character
    references. It also feels slow when it updates the drawing window. Changing to
    &#34;Thousands of Colors&#34; helps. I don&#39;t think there are any problems
    in generating fonts, though &#40;no new ones, anyway&#41;. <BR> <BR>When I finish
    the batch of fonts I&#39;m working on, I&#39;m ditching Fontographer as my main
    production tool and switching to FontLab. As Erik van Blokland told me at TypeCon,
    after you draw 600 or 700 characters in FontLab, you get used to it.

  body: The major roadblock for FOG in Classic Mode on an OSX machine is that you
    cannot manipulate composite characters once they are created. <BR> <BR>Make a
    U umlat with a direses over the top and try to move the direses with the mouse
    or the keyboard and it&#39;ll start spinning the old stopwatch till infinity.
    . . . <BR> <BR>DONE! <BR> <BR>For that reason alone I cannot use FOG on my X machine
    because I build out all of the composite glyhs. It&#39;s a damn shame - Jim Gallagher
    informed me that this is due to Classic mode referencing the Carbon Lib instead
    of the Bitmap file when you&#39;re creating any information that affects the bitmap/metrics
    information associated with the FOG file. <BR> <BR>Oh well, I keep an 8.6 machine
    to do FOG work in for now and the X machine for Font Lab. I do expect to eventually
    abandon FOG once my brain makes the conversion. . . <BR> <BR>Stuart :D
