  sold it to a font library? <BR>I&#39;m curious on what the conditions for the fee
  are. Not that I think my fonts can/will/should be sold, but just in case. Perhaps
  in the future it will be usefull to know some experiences from people that have
  sold their fonts. <BR> <BR>Topics of interest: <BR>- registering <BR>- fee <BR>-
  price per font <BR>- Font library or private <BR> <BR>Anyone? <BR> <BR>Ren'
