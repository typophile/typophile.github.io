body: "Greetings, all,\r\n\r\nI have a handful of fonts that I have created, and I
  want to file the copyright for the computer code with the U.S. Copyright Office.\r\n\r\nThey
  ask for a certain number of pages of the \"source code\" from the beginning and
  the end of the \"program\" to accompany the application for the copyright.\r\n\r\nI
  have no idea how to get to the \"source code\" of a font in order to do this.\r\n\r\nCan
  anyone suggest a method for creating a listing of source, or anchor points and coordinate
  information, or something that I can submit?\r\n\r\nAny help will be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nBrian
  P. Lawler\r\n"

  body: "Hey Brian,\r\n\r\nYeah, they didn't know about fonts when they wrote that.\r\n\r\nIt
    depends on the format of the font. If it's OpenType CFF or TrueType, you could
    use TTX to dump the code in text form. If it's Type 1, I would use an unencrypted
    PFA file to treat as the text/code form of the font.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

    are all OpenType).\r\n\r\nIt's great that you are with Extensis. Delightful people!\r\n\r\nWe're

  body: "According to Google:\r\n<cite>TTX is a tool to convert OpenType and TrueType
    fonts to and from XML. FontTools is a library for manipulating fonts, written
    in Python. It supports TrueType, OpenType, AFM and to an extent Type 1 and some
    Mac-specific formats.</cite>\r\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/fonttools/"

  body: "Yup. Download the TTX tool, and use it to dump your fonts into XML source
    files (which can also be recompiled into fonts with TTX).\r\n\r\nTTX hasn't been
    fully maintained, so it doesn't deal with some new developments, like new formats
    of the OS/2 table, etc. But I don't think FontLab does any of that stuff yet,
    though Adobe's FDK can produce fonts TTX can't handle.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

    file, cat the other files on, and then print that.
