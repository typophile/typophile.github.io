  body: The A doesn't match. I think the rest of the font is very close though. Any
    other suggestions?

  body: "Which Casablanca were you looking at? The one at Fonts.com seems to be a
    good match, although your image is rather small. Arquitectura matches some of
    the Casablanca Condensed alternate letters.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "After looking more closely, the Casablanca condensed is the exact font that
    I need. So this is now solved and closed.\r\n\r\nThank you so much for your help
    (both of you). I very much appreciate it!!"
