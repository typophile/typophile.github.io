body: "I am using Dicot Medium in a logo, but the client asked if this is a system
  font. Honestly, I don't know. Nor was was I concerned... if it looks right, what
  does it matter if it is or isn't?\r\nBut I understand the need for exclusivity and
  the safety of a custom or rare font for logo designs (it didn't stop Instagram...
  until recently). So I turn to you, fellow font friends. What are the origins of
  Dicot?"

  body: "If it's a system font (but which system? :-) then you don't need to install
    it (which might further involve licensing it). Dicot isn't a system font on any
    system AFAIK but -being a freebie- isn't exactly custom or rare either... And
    I don't understand your search for its \"origins\".\r\n\r\nMy advice: Find a good
    font that's not free (which helps make it less common) and convince people it's
    a good idea to use it.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "The key words are \"no budget\" with the client. As soon as I mentioned purchasing
    a font, he shook his head and said Dicot is fine. I think my mistake was not anticipating
    the need to purchase a new typeface in the proposal. I'll remember to include
    this in the next gig.\r\n\r\n@George: Yes, I think we're all adults here and realize
    one would normally find all of life's questions on Google. The answer is 42, by
    the way.\r\n\r\n@Michael: So Dicot is basically a ripoff or potentially a font
    from Photo Lettering?"

    In any case, in this <a href=\"http://lists.runrev.com/pipermail/use-livecode/2005-December/071848.html\">message
    dated dec 2005</a>, Mr. Saperstein speaks of FontBank as a thing of the past.
    That may explain those fonts that are floating around, free, without a EULA.\r\n"
