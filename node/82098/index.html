  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello

I'm looking for help creating a few magazine spreads (a mockup essentially) for a school assignment, with emphasis on good typography. You might be thinking that it may prudent to educate myself on these things, read some books, and you may be right, but my time frame is very limited, so unfortunately I do not have time to do so. I hope, regardless, that this post is in the spirit of the site, as I do hope to learn something from this, despite rudely requesting end results, so to speak, of tested and tried combinations of fonts and style. If you deem this inappropiate, then disregard the remainder of this post and please know that no disrespect was intended. 

Looking at the forums on this site, I'm convinced that there are a great many typographically and design gifted people that frequent this place. I'm looking for one of those for not only advice, but if I find someone both creative and willing to assist the design of these spreads, there can be payment. But not a lot, as it is a non-profit/non-commercial school assignment, and my budget is not great. 

I'm looking for help in setting text, font choices (what fonts goes well together), proper leading, kerning and so forth of headings, subs and the body text for legibility, column widths (left justified or perhaps full justified if possible) and gutter. A tested and tried recipe, I suppose - but for the sake of doing the fonts justice. Suggestions on use of whitespace is certainly appreciated. I realise this is more of a design issue than legibility.

The spreads I will print on a highend color laser printer on matte coated paper. I don't know the exact details of the paper.

My idea is that the titling and headings may be a sans-serif font, and a serif font for the body text - legibility and easy decoding being key. I hope for a modern look, but not necessarily brand new fonts.

Please forgive me, these are all of different style and period and I don't know which fonts go well together. I liked some of the Gerard Unger fonts, but I also looked at some type foundry sites, like Linotype. I looked at Garamond, Granjon, Edison, Centennial, Bembo, Caslon, Farnham, Mrs. Eaves or some derivative of any of those for the body text. For titling or headings: Frutiger, Gothic, Aptifer or some other modern looking font. Yes, I realise that this is very vague and subjective. I'm sorry, I do not know how to otherwise describe them.

I know there are many variations of most of these fonts. Any suggestions?

My apologies for the very lengthy post. I hope anyone would like to provide some tips and suggestions. If this post is completely off key, please disregard, or if a mod deems it inappropiate, delete it.

Many thanks for reading it all.</div>

Folks here are glad to give some general advice, but if this is for a homework assignment it would certainly be better for you to do most of the work yourself rather than hire someone to do your homework for you.  

If you mean it's for an extracurricular project -- like designing your school yearbook or a program for a school event -- you might want to talk to some local designers in your town to see if they'd be willing to contribute some time to help out.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">My thanks for the excellent and informative responses.

mike_duggan: I browsed the majority of these photos of magazines and newspapers, and they are tremendeously inspiring. I can only hope to achieve an endresult that approaches. Many thanks for the link, I appreciate it.

dberlow: This link had some very interesting examples. They in particular brought my attention to the size, or dimensions of the physical media. The format of 8' by 1X' some inches, really seems to the most common. I assume, this is mostly about cost and the limitations of the print machines that presses them, and the sheet sizes you can push through them. Thank you, I found it informative.

JamesM: I know, and can clearly see that this is a good place to seek advise. I understand that my post did not make my intention clear. I am not trying to pay someone to do my assignment, merely rewarding a knowledgable and kind person, if they were to assist me, as I clearly understand that the subject is vast. I wouldn't ask for such a large favor, and not return the favor, in a way that I am capable. 

frode frank: This list of tips and suggestions for further reading is much appreciated. I do hope to study as much as time allows. I will try to find resources online that will allow me to research them further. 

Although, I must admit my time- and budgetlimit is quickly approaching, during my hunt for fonts. Buying two or three fonts will largely expire my resources. 

When I am done with the project, I intend to share it with the forum visitors here. Hopefully, it may be of some use to people that aren't well versed in typography, like me, but wishes to learn more.

If I am not being overly presumptuous, I wonder if there is not a person here that can assist me further. I have seen inspiring things, and found others, by following the links, posted in this thread, but I still seek more. Please forgive my impertinent persistance - also the mixing of US and UK spellings. I can't help it. :(

		<div class="commentbody">I'm thinking of using Fedra Serif B Book for body text and a heavy Helvetica Extra Compressed for titling and a less heavy version for subs. 

For the body text I'd like there to be ample white space, and have it be very legible but also have the neccessary tightness and framing so it doesn't become too loose.

I'm hoping to do column widths of about 2.5' and a height of about 5. I'm trying to set the type at 9/12, but I can't quite figure out if it is a good amount. This particular type face has somewhat larger ascenders and descenders than others I have looked into. I am hopeful for any suggestions.

Thanks a lot. </div>

I've read through Ellen Luptons very lovely guide on text and style on her website. I also looked around for a site that had more information in a format with examples about the correlation between the things I mention above, and how one would choose these, if they weren't experienced at using them.

This post turned out to be a bit of a semi bump of sorts. Sorry about that.</div>
