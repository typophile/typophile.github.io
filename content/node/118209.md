  that can give me more information)\r\n\r\nI recently picked up a small booklet of
  \"Intertype Gothics\" that shows two sizes (36 pt. and 42 pt.) of a face called
  \"Spike Gothic.\"\r\n\r\nCan anyone give me more information about it? I've never
  seen it before and would like to know more about it. Any digital versions? A quick
  Google search didn't turn up anything.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SpikeGothic_4601_4566.JPG]"

    to agree with apparent consensus that it was made in the Intertype office and
    is not digitized. \r\nDon"
