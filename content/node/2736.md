  <BR> <BR>To summarize: working on a <i>logo for a bicycle tour company which guides

  <BR> <BR><b>Industry Analysis</b>: Not much to say or learn except that there is
  MUCH room for design improvement industry wide. No one company has a strong graphic
  identity. <BR> <BR><b>Projected Media</b>: crossmedia from web, to printed &#34;rack
  cards,&#34; signage, vehicles &#40;vans&#41;, clothing &#40;tee-shirts, hats, etc.&#41;.
  <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s my first B&amp;W iteration. <i>Please be brutally honest</i>.
  I&#39;m looking for any &amp; all comments from composition to kerning. Meanwhile,
  I&#39;m going to go dunk my tired eyes in ice water and then shut for a few hours.

  body: hi tim <BR> <BR>i like it, but i think there is something strange in the contrast
    in the AU in MAUI. in someway i think that two thick strokes don&#39;t work very
    well together, even though i am not sure that it will work better if you flip
    your M and A, i think that you should try that. <BR> <BR>In &#34;Cruisers&#34;
    i think that you should work with two different &#34;s&#34;, just to take away
    the spirit of a script typeface and give it a look like manual script. <BR> <BR>i
    dont know if i was clear in my observations, but anyway, i hope that they are
    usefull <BR> <BR>CG

  body: The balancing seems way too contrived. I know the M of Maui is suppose to
    extend down to the M of Mountain - but what&#39;s the point really. I also think
    the words could be sized differently - make Cruisers big and overlap it on top
    of mountain knock out the egdes to white. And Maui Mountain could be smaller,
    justified center

    did you hand draw the Maui Mountain or modify an existing font? &#40;Guessing
    the latter&#41; <BR> <BR>&#60;putting_on_sherlock_holmes_hat&#62; <BR>The reason
    I say that is from looking at the A. The thin stroke looks overly thin. That is
    because it used to have a cross bar and the thin got thinned even more to compensate.
    Now that it&#39;s gone, the thin needs some weight back. Make it look the same
    as the thin on the N. Also check the thick stroke. They may have been shaved too
    &#40;hard to tell at this resolution&#41;. BTW since the M = A&#43;A that will
    need fixing too. <BR> <BR>The O might want more space in the middle &#40;too dark&#41;.
    Instead of straight sides, try an oval made of 4 points. <BR> <BR>Script: This
    will need fixing in three places. 1. The Cr connection isn&#39;t smooth and could
    maybe use a bit more weight, 2. se spacing combination is too tight. You may want
    to draw a custom connection between them wrapping the s a little tighter and connecting
    it to the e. 3 er connection changes weight too quickly. <BR> <BR>Randy <BR> <BR>

    It&#39;s causing the whole logo to lack cohesiveness &#40;possibly because of

    What about trying a lower case c? Try a bunch of other layouts to solve this issue.

    I may play with that a bit. At the very least, placing it on an angle may liven
    it up. <BR> <BR> -t

  body: Sorry to pester, but my deadline is looming and I&#39;d love to get some fresh
    eyes on this. I&#39;m currently working on the script connectors and fiddling
    with &#34;Cruisers&#34;&#39;s placement, but could use some more feedback about
    the best &#34;M&#34; weight, the wedged &#34;A&#34; and weather or not you think
    the &#34;peaks&#34; concept bears exploration. <BR> <BR>Will post multi-sized
    examples of best weight&#43;wedge with &#34;Cruisers&#34; polished for a final
    kerning check soon after. Also beginning color explorations. <BR> <BR>Thanks busy
    typophiles! <BR> <BR> -t

  body: 'Regarging your post &#40;TIM&#41; #109 -- I think slanting the M is too tricking.
    It messes with the eyes in a negative way. <BR> <BR>The connection of the letters
    s&#62;e is too tight and seems like there could be a smoother transition from
    letter to letter. The s seems a little tall &#40;in the altogether and in the
    loop&#41;, which could explain why the transition from s to e seems forced. And
    the r seems a little short. The connection from C to r seems to have a bump in
    it too. <BR> <BR>I really like the direction you have taken this, however I wonder
    if the word &#34;Cruisers&#34; could be a little more extended? Looser. Same style,
    but more of a scrawl or rather stretched across the bottom of the word &#34;Mountain&#34;?'

  body: I still kind&#39;a like the mountain range direction, but I don&#39;t like
    the chiseled peaks. I would keep the peaks flat, like the original type. Also,
    I think more variation is needed in the heights &#40;see below, marked in red&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>As for &#34;Cruisers&#34; positioning, I was thinking something like
    this &#40;see below marked in red&#41;. Sorry I don&#39;t have your script type.

    had a chance to fix the script connections yet and am aware or the C-r, s-e, e-r
    issues. I agree that some fiddling with the placement, angle, and kerning could
    liven the word up as well as the overall contrast. <BR> <BR>Scott -- Hmmm, I like
    what you&#39;ve done with the peaks by leaving them flat, but wonder if there&#39;s
    still not too much optical trickery occuring, which tends to distract. I&#39;ll
    have to look at this more closely. I like the cruisers on an arc or at least on
    more of an angle concept and pushed right. I&#39;m gonna play around with it a
    bit. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR> -t'

    something rough in this case. Keep Cruisers clean. Also, I think it has too many
    tiers &#40;the mountain, the &#34;maui&#34;, the &#34;mountain&#34;, and &#34;cruisers&#34;&#41;.
    If you are going to do something decorative like the volcano-mountain then don&#39;t
    add another element with &#34;cruisers&#34;.  <BR> <BR>Going back to Scott&#39;s
    idea: I think he has a good idea with the &#34;maui&#34; and &#34;mountain&#34;

    Just a thought. ;&#41; I&#39;m not the most outdoor-friendly person so I could
    be wrong.  <BR> <BR>Tanya ... I like the idea of rough and smooth. But, because
    both ends of &#34;cruisers&#34; have a similar shape, it almost reads as &#34;ruisers&#34;.

  body: aaa well - like I said I just wanted to play with it a bit to show some overlapping
    and how the white contour can solve a bunch of space problems.  <BR> <BR>- its
    by no means &#42;that&#42; thought out. The upcurl or course is way too similar
    to the C but I had suggested way back that things could be center justified with
    that triangular base. something needs to &#39;end&#39; it so to speak. perhaps
    just thinner and not so long. I donno. <BR> <BR>the roughness thing was only because
    I exported paths of of Tim&#39;s .gif image and didn&#39;t bother simplifying
    them. I thought after that it might have been apropos for style...because honestly
    I don&#39;t see the relation of a danty, girly, script face with these freakish
    people who fall 38miles peddle-free. I&#39;m sure the &#34;cruisers&#34; aren&#39;t
    that elegant. hehe <BR> <BR>but anyway if this visual sparks an idea then great.
    Its sometimes hard to explain things in words.

  body: '<b>MAUI MOUNTAIN CRUISERS Redux</b> <BR> <BR>Firstly, my apologies for falling
    off there -- but I was past deadlines and had to move on to other aspects of what
    was a larger project. <BR> <BR>I wanted to be sure and post the final logo and
    thank everyone involved for their excellent eyes, critiques, guidance, feedback,
    ideas and mock-ups. <BR> <BR>Unfortunately, some feedback came just a little too
    late for me to respond to, as I had committed to one direction that I was &#40;by
    that point&#41; fine tuning. Thanks nonetheless, to Tanya, BJ, Tom C. and Andrew
    for their concepts. <BR> <BR><b>SPECIAL Thanks</b> to Scott K., Tiffany, and Hrant
    for their professorial like tutelage -- never giving away too much, but just enough
    to inspire one to think about the design challenge in new ways. <BR> <BR><b>SUPERCALAFRAGILISTICEXPEALIDOCIOUS
    T h a n k s</b> to Randy Jones for his mentoring and hands on help perfecting
    those pesky script face beziers, not to mention other subtleties which really
    brought the final design to life. Thanks Aquatoad! <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/29180.gif"
    alt=""> <BR> <BR> <BR><b>Notes About The Final Design</b> <BR>Much happened as
    compared to iteration &#34;10.74&#34; from my post #104, including weight and
    letterform changes to the &#34;M,&#34; a sizing up of &#34;Maui,&#34; and the
    obvious enhancements to &#34;Cruisers&#34; which include smoothing of the curves
    and connectors, adding weight to the face, a bit of vertical squashing, and a
    fine finishing flourish. Color directions have yet to be decided, but are likely
    to resemble the lavaesque orange currently displayed at the new website where
    you can see the logo basking: <BR><a href="http://www.mauimountaincruisers.com/"
    target="_blank">http://www.mauimountaincruisers.com/</a> <BR> <BR> <BR><b>What
    I Learned</b> <BR>SKETCH, SKETCH, SKETCH! Whether by pencil, paper and erasure
    &#40;my preference&#41; or tablet -- there is simply no better way to work out
    solutions to logotype and letterform challenges than mad scientist like sketching.
    Have fun with it. Brainstorm, scribble any concept that comes to mind. <BR> <BR>There
    are many possible ways to solve a problem, but there&#39;s usually one or two
    that are &#34;best.&#34; Still, it&#39;s subjective, and what you consider best
    might be someone else&#39;s &#34;worst.&#34; <BR> <BR>Use your eyes. Always consider
    legibility. How do the letterforms &#34;sound&#34; to your eyes? Balance positive
    as well as negative space. White space is your friend -- don&#39;t ignore it.
    <BR> <BR>Know when to say when. There comes a point where you have to commit,
    fine tune and finish -- even with personal projects. <BR> <BR>Contrast is key,
    especially when it comes to logos with many words and letters such as this one.
    <BR> <BR> <BR><b>Typophile Props</b> <BR>Typophile, in my opinion, is the web&#39;s
    richest resource and community. The sheer abundance and quality of information
    available to type designers, typographers, and graphic designers is astonishing.
    <BR> <BR>I only hope that I can give back some iota of what I&#39;ve received
    in my little time here. In fact, it&#39;s my prediction that I&#39;ll reach 6,000
    post long before Hrant.  <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
