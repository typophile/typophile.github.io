  body: You drew the image, right?  Why not draw the type with it?  Right now those
    2 parts are not as unified as they should be.  The grey stroke on the letters
    is not helping things.  Good illustration, build off of that.

    maybe it's more am illustration than a logo, so I make a new test using my mascot.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo-new_4811.png]\r\n\r\nWhat
    do you think about it? The first one better or the second?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Personally, I find the first image to be much more effective, it the line
    weight and shading really bring forth the mascot.\r\nThe second image looks more
    corporate in my opinion.\r\n\r\nI agree with Luma Vine in the sense the type should
    be drawn in and to exclude the grey lines.  The only thing I would further recommend
    is making a difference between both of the \"E\"'s.  The reason being is because
    they are situated right beside each other, the eye will compare them against each
    other. If there is a slight difference, it adds character/complexity, thus making
    a nicer image.\r\n\r\nAll in all it is a wonderful looking design, good work!"

  body: "Actually I'm building a website that will organise a monthly tee-shirt contest,
    and then I will sell them online. So this logo should be a brand for my tees and
    a logo for my website. \r\n\r\nI'm just afraid that the first logo looks more
    as an illustration rather than a logo.\r\n\r\nHope you can tell me more, and help
    me in my choice?"

  body: "It's a logo for a website that organizes monthly contests. It is a logo of
    a service and not a company. It's perfectly feasible to have such a grunge-looking
    logo for the service you described.\r\n\r\nAnd the first logo is really good.
    But change it as Luma told you. Keep the illustration, remove that type with strange
    bluish gray outline (or stroke as he named it) and draw those letters just as
    you drew the illustration. It was working perfectly, but those too perfect letter
    shapes were telling us they weren't drawn.\r\n\r\nAnyway. Great illustration.
    Kindda reminds me of the band Gorillaz... That's good. :)"
