  Photographers? Typographers? or people who generate concepts for advertising, people
  who art direct in photography etc? Or are they there to produce leaflets, logos,
  junk mail, stationery sets and editorial work? Hmm...what do you think? \r\nPS graphic
  designers have been told they are not advertisers, they are not illustrators or
  photographers. So what are they and what do they do?"

    that can live under the umbrella of Graphic Design; identity design, interface
    design, publication design, information design, and so on. \r\n\r\nI usually only
    call myself a graphic designer in when speaking to people who either wouldn't
    get the specifics or wouldn't care. :) Doctors are a (somewhat) reasonable analogy.
    Most of them practice within a specialty or sub-specialty like cardiology, neurology,
    etc. When asked what they do for a living, much of the time they'll just tell
    you they're \"a doctor\".\r\n"

    has changed since the old days of X-acto knives and paste-up.\r\n\r\nThese days,
    a designer IS and illustrator/photographer/etc. It's the most encompassing and

  body: "It's not quite the same thing, but \"Art Director\" has a similar perception
    problem. Here is what Saul Bass had to say about it:\r\n\r\n\"For years, my mother
    wondered what I do; that is, what i <em>really</em> do. She new I did art work--and
    actually she was very happy about it despite some vagueness that surrounded the
    matter. Her only concern was that I should make a living, and I seemed to be doing
    all right. But finally her curiosity overcame her timidity, and, I think with
    some prompting from the neighbors, she finally asked me what it was that I <em>really</em>
    did.\r\n\r\n\"I pulled out a proof of an ad that I had designed and I showed it
    to her and said, \u2018Mom, that's what I do.' She looked at this and said, \u2018Oh,
    I see . . . ' and she pointed to a photograph in the ad and said, \u2018<em>That's</em>
    what you do?' I said, \u2018Oh, no, you see, there are photographers--and they
    are specialists--they know all about cameras and things of that kind, and they
    make the photographs.'\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2018Oh,' she said, disappointed, \u2018Then
    <em>this</em> is what you do?' I said, \u2018No, that's typography. You see there
    are special organizations who do nothing but set type--you know, Garamond, Caslon,
    etc. . . . these people do that.' Again she was a little disappointed. She pointed
    to the lettering and we went through this again. Finally she looked at me somewhat
    concerned, and said, \u2018Well, now, what do <em>you</em> do?' I said, \u2018Well,
    you see, I conceived the whole thing, and then I get all these people together
    and get them to carry out the process.' She looked at me very coyly, and said,
    \"Oh--you devil!'\u201D\r\n\r\n(From \"The Design of Advertising\" by Roy Paul
    Nelson)"

    is one of the few growing professions nowadays (or so I hear) I think more people

    \"what do you design\" and then you can get into specifics. And no, Uncle Al,
    it doesn't mean I draw the pictures.\r\n\r\nBut we do a little bit of everything.
    In addition to designing (layout/print/books, in my case) I art direct photo shoots,
    check proofs, read copy for mistakes, typeset, lots of things that fall outside
    the job description but that (I hope) make me more valuable to my clients.\r\n\r\nYou

  body: missgiggles -- the beauty of the design industry is it's possible to not only
    be creative in terms of the work you produce, but also create your own job on
    your own terms (if you're willing to hustle). People who receive graphic design
    training can go on to be any myriad of things, not just a graphic designer at
    a graphic design firm who does graphic design projects like brochures, logos,
    and websites. There are all sorts of niches and different worlds to live in within
    the umbrella of the design industry, and a lot live on the peripheral edges. I
    think of myself as a graphic designer, but I've had the opportunity to work on
    projects that overlapped with photography, fashion, industrial design, interior
    design, etc., and I'd say that's fairly typical for designers.

    takes them as opportunities arrive in their way. Sounds great. I visited a design
    firm in London recently and they suggested that brochure work etc would slowly
    disappear and become digital based. What does everyone think? Will there be a
    time where paper based work will be a thing of the past like books etc? Will we
    be reading online? I know you can already do that but a majority of things be
    digital based. Agree or disagree?
