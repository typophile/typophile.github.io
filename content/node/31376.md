  resources with examples in that matter? Do you know any designer or calligrapher
  making those? Especially I'm interested in making all those swashy lines around
  initials rather than ideas of connecting letters.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NG_1_4972.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/RE_2b_4166.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/RE_3_3697.jpg]"

    pages of initials.

  body: "If you are really interested in designing swashed forms, you have to develop
    some skill with a calligraphy pen. That means practice of the basic letterforms,
    and the basic swashes, so that the hand and eye make them--in beautiful, sweeping
    strokes -- rather than the brain.\r\n\r\nThe fashionable filigree which today
    attaches itself to everything from Helvetica to blackletter is another matter,
    more cut, paste, and general idea than the integral structure suggested by your
    sketches.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Basically I'd like to see how those swashed forms could be arranged as kind
    of frames around the initials. NG is a guy and I'd like his initials and swashes
    to be more masculine - simplier, more straight lines, closed in square shape.
    RE is a gal and swashes around her initials should be feminine - curved, shaping
    a circle, flower etc.\r\n\r\nAs for my calligraphy skills I'm afraid I won't have
    time to develop any reasonable level for this case. Also I'm left handed and to
    be honest it's hard to write with pen - not single shapes or letters but whole
    words and sentences. Are there any left handed calligraphers?\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n_______\r\n

    It''s been years since I''ve touched the stuff, but it just takes a little more
    patience to not smear everything is all. Also, when I took it in school, my teacher
    had me ink some pieces right to left as well. '

  body: "There are <em> lots</em> of lefty calligraphers.\r\n\r\nNormally, lefties
    keep the paper with baseline parallel to stomach and either \"push\" (risking
    smearing) or \"hook\" (cramps hand and wrist). Using a standard nib is difficult,
    and the purpose-built \"lefty\" nibs aren't all that satisfactory.\r\n\r\nIn the
    years when I was teaching calligraphy, a few of my lefty students had success
    with this unusual approach: hold pen (in left hand!) fitted with standard \"righty\"
    nib (Brause, H&B), place paper with left edge close to stomach and right edge
    at far side of desk.  It takes a while to get used to the change in perspective
    but the payoff is that your hand is completely relaxed and all the nib slant variations
    can be done with relative ease. Might be worth a few minutes of experimentation,
    at least. Doesn't work for everyone.\r\n\r\nOn quite a few occasions, I heard
    horror stories from lefty students who had attended parochial schools in the early
    grades: the teachers <em>forced</em> then to write with their right hands, using
    adhesive tape to fix the pens in their right hands. Yuck. \r\n\r\nI think the
    first RE has lots of potential. "

    it. The thing is to make NG similar to RE or even in one swashy shape as they
    will appear next to each other (wedding stuff).\r\n\r\n_______\r\n AL\r\n<a href=http://www.lenart.pl>lenart.pl</a>"
