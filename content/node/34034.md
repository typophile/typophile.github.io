body: "Hi everyone, i'm exploring kinetic typography and movie titles as a dissertation
  idea, I just wondered if anyone could think of any examples of interesting typography
  use in opening sequences to films, either old or new, the only one which springs
  to my mind is the titles of 'Catch Me If You Can' (see below), a style which has
  been copied quite a lot, but if anyone can think of anything else please let me
  know.\r\n\r\nthanks."

  body: "thanks for all the replies guys, this was my first post and i'm astounded
    by the quantity and quality of posts.  some great examples here, most of which
    i'm familiar with - particularly love the napoleon dynamite's opening sequence,
    which coupled with 'we're going to be friends' by the white stripes, perfectly
    captures the innocence of the film.\r\n\r\ni'd seen a lot of the work of Saul
    Bass before, without really realising it was his, and its stunning. part of the
    titles to 'the man with the golden arm' were copied for the white stripes  'hardest
    button to button' single sleeve. (you may have noticed i'm a white stripes fan!)
    \ Love Wes Andersons work, his attention to detail, and his love of futura (like
    Kubrick), which is most noticeable in the Royal Tenenbaums...along with Helvetica
    for the book covers featured in the film.\r\n\r\nI've got a lot of ideas, just
    struggling to come up with a cohesive title/proposal for my dissertation, and
    a strong direction, but keep these coming!"
