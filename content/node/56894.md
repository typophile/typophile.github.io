body: Does anyone know how to make a font display correctly in Font Book on the mac?
  I made it in Fontlab, and generated a TTF, which looks and works fine in Illustrator
  and other software, but has its head cut off in Font Book. Sorry for newb question.
  Cheers

    been drawn. Check in particular to make sure your tallest letter above the baseline
    is the same, or ideally less tall than the value in Font Info/Metrics and Dimensions/Key
    Dimensions/Ascender. \r\n\r\nIncrease that Ascender value to cover the tallest
    letter, or scale the whole font so the tallest letter fits inside the Ascender
    value.\r\n\r\nIt could be something else, but this is usually checked first.\r\n\r\nCheers!"
