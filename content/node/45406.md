  body: "As I said in my mail, I\u2019ve been encouraged by Gerry to also detail my
    personal typographic research and interests as part of my application for Reading.
    He told me one of the most important criteria the MATD steering committee is looking
    for in people applying to enter the MATD is intellectual curiosity. I tried to
    fit as much of my past few years of work into my portfolio: apparently it worked!"

  body: They also like to see that you have experience typesetting projects with a
    lot of text. People tend to leave these projects out of their portfolios because
    they're not the glamourous jobs, but at Reading you will be expected to design
    a typeface that works in text, so the ability to handle text typography is a plus.
    Good luck Eben.

  body: "Thanks for the additional advice. I am almost done with my text. Layout is
    next.\r\n\r\nAs far as longer texts, happily I did design a short run literary
    Magazine out of Montreal recently. It's called Snafu Anthology. (The type used
    is P22 LTC Caslon Long Pro, - Viva P22! ) \r\n\r\nThe bad news is they can't seem
    to get me photos of it which is slightly maddening because they say it is selling
    well and looks quite good! At least I have the InD files..."
