  body: "Yes, welcome.  I have a feeling that your sans serif lettering may be a simple
    customization of a (hopefully common) sans font. It looks like the outlines have
    been tweaked to angle certain corners for artistic effect. Noticing that the E's
    have different corners removed, and that the first N has no corners tweaked makes
    me think this is a customization and not a font. You could choose almost any sans
    with a D like this and do the same thing.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
