    is direct link to a .wav which shows how to pronounce neue in german (its \"Neue
    Welt\", new world, so forget about the second word).\r\n\r\nits a computer voice
    as you'll see, but its pretty accurate. \"noy-a\" sounds pretty wrong to me."

    know. It bends a bit in that direction, when you say it fast. If the faq read
    \u201Cnoye\u201D, all these english speakers would say \u201Cno\xEF\u201D."
