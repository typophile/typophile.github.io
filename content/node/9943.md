  body: This kind of question is always tricky, because our idea of &#39;resemble&#39;
    may be very different, but I would suggest looking at Lucida Sans, ITC Symbol
    &#40;which is almost a sans&#41; and ITC Eras which has a similar clean feel,
    and large x-height. <BR> <BR>See if one of those is close enough to what you want.

    an Optima wannabe.
