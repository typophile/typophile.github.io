		<div class="commentbody">This brings up a curious question for me. Let's assume for one moment that the glyphs are not just hacked up copies of Charlemange (although, that makes me question Mason as well, as it bears a lot of similarities to Chalemange as well, doesn't it?). If I'm inspired by a font I see, and I design a font that uses those characteristics, how is that theft? The laws in the US do not protect type design. They protect the software that allows one to use the font. It's not theft, it's a protected act that the patent office and copyright offices in the US have zero problem with.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I view this the same way I view copycat films in Hollywood. It's lame as an artist to create by slavishly copying, but it's not unexpected or illegal. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(Yes, I know that not everyone here is from the US, and the copyright protection of font design is different outside of our little western nation.)</div>

She built on those ideas and created something both respectful of history and original at the same time. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If the Parish designer printed out the Charlemagne and Mason sets, then traced them, added the Mason-inspired accents to the Charlemagne forms by drawing them on the paper, then scanned it in and did every bezier from scratch, then I wouldn't really have a problem with it. But if the designer simply converted Charlemagne and Mason to outlines, then modified the beziers, I'd be much more upset about it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Finally, if it is an outright theft, as it looks like it is, it doesn't matter how hard the font is to find. The legal argument about international copyright is immaterial to me; it's a breach of professional ethics, especially to turn around and charge for the theft.</div>

I do have a problem when someone tries to pass off such a font as an original work.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I do think derivative fonts should be allowed to exist somehow in a way that's fair to the original designers. There is certainly a demand for them. The one avenue that is allowed now in some licenses is that, if you have a legal copy of a font, you can make a derivative version for your own use. The problem is when you try to distribute it, which puts the maker of such a font in a very dubious and possibly illegal position. In an ideal world, Carol Twombly and Jonathan Barnbrook would get a cut of the proceeds from something like Parish. Or maybe there should be a requirement that, for example, anyone using Parish should have a legal copy of Charlemagne or Mason. In fact, there's no reason why people couldn't do this on their own now.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It's a little sticky with Parish in particular, though. The basic font data seems to me to have come from Charlemagne. The designer then took ideas from Mason and applied them to Charlemagne. I think taking the basic font data from Charlemagne is very different taking visual ideas from Mason. The first is more to do with software copyright, the second is more about artistic integrity.

		<div class="commentbody">At least as I understood it, your LOL remark indicated that you thought it was funny (likely in the ironic rather than the ha-ha sense) that even after you knew the font was a bastardized version of two established typefaces, you still liked it better. You have every right to like it better &ndash; I'm sure the designer did, too; it was his idea to &quot;improve&quot; upon Charlemagne and Mason in the first place. The problem (for me, anyway; not trying to speak for Yves but I did it so well before&hellip;) is that I don't think there's anything funny about how he apparently went about it, ironic, ha-ha, or otherwise. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Note: neither I nor Yves suggested that you approved of the practice, but if you end up using the font, you've basically accepted it as a convenience with reservations. Two very different things.</div>
