    the designer and will post back here if he replies :-)

    not close enough- it\u2019s optimized for text not display work like Didi is.\r\n\r\nPS...
    I think Didi is a really cute name for a font.\r\n\r\nMikey :-)"

    we get a digitization of Didi?\r\n\r\nMikey :-)"

  body: "Image Club Graphics digitized a version of ITC Didi from large format Velox
    masters back in 1989. When Image Club was part of Adobe Systems (c. 1998), several
    hundred typeafces (including our ITC Didi) were discontinued. It was determined
    that the quality of the outlines and metrics in those faces were simply not up
    to our upgraded technical and aesthetic standards at the time. Due to a lack of
    resources, ITC Didi was never redigitized.\r\n\r\nIf your are able to locate an
    older copy of one of Image Club\x1D\u2019s Letterpress CDs, ITC Didi will be part
    of it. Unfortunately, my stash of those old discs has long since been exhausted.\r\n\r\ng."

    ITC Didi and Didoni are only generally similar.'

  body: No Florian, I'm not trying to be funny. Since you can't buy it or get it ANYWHERE
    other than a "piracy forum" I'd think it'd be okay since the survival of such
    a great font would be more important to me than simply letting it die out of respect
    for the original designer, OR simply because like many people have pointed out,
    it's simply been overlooked. In any case . . . I'll adhere to the posting guidelines
    and no longer seek to share this font with anyone.
