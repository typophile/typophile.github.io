body: "The naming debacle is resolved, and I even found inspiration in something <a
  href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_engine\">a bit more mechanical</a>. With
  a name like !Exclamachine, there should be at least a few industrial-flavored fonts.
  I  now present <strong>!Square Engine</strong>, a font family.\r\n\r\n!Square Engine
  050<em> Defex</em>\r\n!Square Engine 150<em> Simplex</em>\r\n!Square Engine 250<em>
  Reflex</em>\r\n!Square Engine 350<em> Latex</em>\r\n\r\n144 characters x 4 Styles
  x 2 weights in each. Includes Euro, Irony Mark, lc accents and more.\r\n\r\nThe
  family is inspired by the European tradition of using model numbers to describe
  the body & motor combination of a car or bike(and sometimes a name). These four
  fully-interchangeable monospaced fonts have different wrappers or \"bodies\" (\"0xx\"-\"3xx\"),
  and share character design, or \"engine\"(the \"x50\").\r\n\r\nFuture additions
  to the !Square Engine family will be numbered similarly, and spaced/scaled to also
  interchange.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/promo-on-burg_3710.jpg]\r\n(Apologies

  body: "Thank you! Really, thank you very much! I appreciate the feedback because
    every font I make is both an experiment and  an education. I often get frustrated
    and estatic several times over, because the vision in my head might look nothing
    like what I had in mind (sometimes better, sometimes not.)\r\n\r\nI already have
    a few sketches for a sister series in the !Square Engine line, give me a few weeks,
    and I'll post a prototype.\r\n\r\nI like to think of my fonts as an open invitation
    to an artistic collaboration, waiting for whoever might pick it up and use it
    in a page. The hand off of a baton can be an anxious moment. \r\n\r\nOn !Zugwang;
    Thank you again. ( I peeked at your website: pretty, cool, hip. )Oddly, this is
    my least favorite font! I'm fairly happy with the letters' shapes, but I find
    it impossible to really use anywhere. I may revisit it another day. Tonight, I
    will sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\nChoz Cunningham\r\n!Exclamachine Type Foundry\r\n|\\/|O

    body: "I was at first very apprehensive about that. All the fonts I've made as\"!Exclamachine\"
      have a \"!\" at the beginning, even though it sometimes isn't included when
      others refer to them. And it's invalaid in some early specs, but I <em>believe</em>
      it degrades gracefully.\r\n\r\nIf you, or anybody, has any technical problems
      with the fonts please bring it to my attention immediately. chozcunningham@exclamachine.com
      If you can tell me what OS, application or printing hardware this has happened
      on, I will offer all the support I can.\r\n\r\nFrom my testing, or from feedback,
      things seem to function correctly  under Win98/NT4/2K/XP/Server 2003, Mac OSX
      and 3 distros of Linux, Redhat, Ubuntu and Debian. All contemporary Adobe products
      seem to be okay as well, when bypassing the OS's font management. I've also
      had good luck with several Windows free/shareware type managers. At this time
      I am unable, to experiment more in Linux, or Pre-X Macintoshes.\r\n\r\nChoz

      as good as practice.\r\n\r\nI may later drop this gimmick, or reserve it only
