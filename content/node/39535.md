  my company back in 1972. Have searched a number of sites including \"identafont\"
  and so far the closest I have found is \"FF Atma Serif LF Book Italic\" but even
  that is not close enough. Would appreciate any help in identifying this font.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance.\r\n\r\nBrian Scott[img:sites/default/files/old-images/communitas logo
