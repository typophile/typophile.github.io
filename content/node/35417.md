  bearing values are saved.\r\n\r\nI have changed the width values of some gylphs
  in my font but wanted to keep the side bearing as before.\r\n\r\nI did the alterations
  in a duplicate vfb file and then imported the metrics form the original vfb file,
  but the metrics file only seem to import the left sidebearing and the width of the
  glyph, therefore the right side bearing is always incorrect.\r\n\r\nIs this the
  case and is there any way of exporting and imprting the metrics so it uses the sidebearing
  values.\r\n\r\nRr"

  body: "The quickest (and easiest) way to do this is to copy the glyphs from the
    font you want to take the sidebearings from.\r\n\r\nThen mark the glyphs on the
    new font that you want to change and do \"Paste Special\" on them - and choose
    only right and left sidebearing in the following window that pops up when you
    do Paste special.\r\n\r\nPaste special is my favourite commando ;-)\r\n\r\nYou
    could also save the sidebearings, but this is quicker.\r\n\r\nBe careful if you
    paste the sidebaerings on compsites however, there is a bug sometimes making the
    composites destroyed, better to adjust the composites manually or by clicking
    the little arrow in the metrics window (copy to composites) OR use classes to
    set the composites to the same value as the component glyph."

  body: "Thanks Goran, but is there no other way of doing this. Fontographer allowed
    you to save metrics and then import them in another font where it would copy the
    side bearing and if needed the width would change.\r\n\r\nI've made lots of alterations
    to a duplicate of a vfb file and now I want to import the side bearings form the
    orginal vfb. The only way I can of doing this is going through every glyph and
    then copying the metrics to the new vfb. Surely there must be somethng faster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRr"

  body: "Yes, you could save the metrics, just click on the AFM-box in the picture
    to save it, and then you could import it another font.\r\n\r\nBut, when you copy
    metrics you dont have to do it one by one. Just mark a bunch of glyphs and then
    mark same glyphs in the new font and then do Paste special, I think this is even
    quicker than saving and importing metrics.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/saveAFM_3812.png]"

  body: "Goran,\r\n\r\nAre you talking about copying the glyph here or just the metrics,
    I don't want to copy the glyph just the metrics of the glyph.\r\n\r\nI'm not too
    sure what you mean by the ATM box"

  body: "In the image shown in my previous post, you see that there is written AFM
    (two times)? The first one opens/imports metrics files, and the second one (looking
    like a disc) saves AFM-files, which is Metric information. Could be kerning and
    sidebearings. If you sweep over the buttons you will also se what all buttons
    means in FontLab.\r\n\r\nNow, when you copy metrics, you can just mark the glyphs
    you want to copy metrics from. Lets say you mark A-Z, all 26 letters. Then do
    normal copy (as if you were copying them).\r\n\r\nThen, shift to the other font.
    Mark A-Z here to, and then do \"Paste special\" instead of just \"Paste\". You\u2019ll
    find the command up in the Edit menu. Paste Special, lets you paste what ever
    information you want onto the marked glyphs. \r\n\r\nWhen you do Paste Special,
    you\u2019ll see a following window:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/paste_special_5716.png]\r\n\r\nIf
    you click on these two I\u2019ve checked here \u2013 the only thing you\u2019ll
    paste is the sideabearings.\r\n\r\nHope you get it working, Rachel."
