body: "Greetings,\r\n\r\nI\u2019m planning moving to Ireland this year thus I\u2019m
  looking for any design related course around. Specific courses would be great too,
  like typography, photography or just graphic design. \r\n\r\nIt doesn\u2019t have
  to be in Dublin, since I\u2019m still planning the trip. Actually it would be interesting
  to hear about courses um Scotland also. I left England off because it\u2019s too
  expensive.\r\n\r\nI really appreciate your help.\r\n"

    is Irish and her parents live there. I'll correspond with my wife's sister, who
    took very good courses in Dublin in web design, and get back to you.\r\n\r\nJordan"

  body: "Gustavo\r\n\r\nHi again. Ok, here are 3 places you might look into. Dublin
    Institute of Technology, www.dit.ie, NCAD National College of Art and Design at
    www.ncad.ie and the Dun Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design and Technology at www.iadt.ie.
    Take a look at all of them, though the last has a very fine reputation. My wife
    went to NCAD where she learned to be a great weaver, hand-woven fabrics. Good
    luck.\r\nJordan"
