  body: I have spent way too much time toodling through various listings on MyFonts.com
    in a vain attempt to determine what style of font this is. It&#39;s not keyworded
    or categorized as <i>linear</i>, <i>monoline</i>, <i>script</i>, <i>swash</i>,
    <i>loopy</i>, <i>decorative</i>, <i>alternate</i>, <i>curly</i>, or <i>fancy</i>...
    <BR> <BR>I think I&#39;ve covered all of the most obvious characteristics of this
    sample. Perhaps I&#39;m missing something completely, or else the face is simply
    keyworded incorrectly. <BR> <BR>Aaagh! <BR> <BR>Chesh, you&#39;re such a tease.
