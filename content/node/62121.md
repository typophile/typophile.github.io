body: "Dear typographers and typophiles\r\n \r\nI am writing a thesis, and am using
  Indesign as publisher after quitting latex, but I am constantly unsatisfied with
  the proportions on the A4 paper, which is the mandatory form. I am trying to apply
  the typographical principles, but especially in this format the rule about 66 character
  as the ideal, and 75 character as the maximum per line is very difficult to arrive
  at, unless you have very broad margins, and some large letters, which looks a little
  unprofessional. I have seen some solutions in journals where they use two columns,
  but that is probably to unorthodox for many professors, (who are used to see good
  layout in journals but bad layout by their students). \r\n\r\nIs there someone who
  could help? Especially with the priorities: Which elements should come first, and
  how can you make a single column A4 thesis look good?\r\n\r\nBest regards.\r\nJon
  \r\n"

  body: "Thanks for the link, there is some very nice layouts there using A4 size!
    \r\nSo apparently, it is possible, given the weird dimensions it has.\r\nI must
    try to copy some of that, but at least I was not wrong in choosing Arno. A couple
    of the papers use that typeface too.\r\n\r\n"
