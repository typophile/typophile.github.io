body: I am looking for a font similar to the one in the image. I want to make wood
  signs with custom names. I need a font that has character like "a" "o" "e" "d",
  etc to have breaks in the letters. If you use a normal font, the middle of the letter
  will "fall out'" and the character will lose its details.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wood
