body: Here&#39;s a font I designed a loooong time ago &#40;July 1995, according to
  my records, though it may have actually been earlier&#41; for a DOS-based audio
  visualization application.  It was similar to one of those multi-effect Winamp plugins
  that everyone&#39;s so fond of, except that it predated Winamp by quite some time
  &#40;not to mention mp3s as a viable format&#41;.   &#40;It worked using a quirk
  of the Pro Audio Spectrum 16 soundcard which let one program monitor the output
  of another, though the real trick was getting two programs to run at the same time
  back then...&#41; <BR> <BR>Someday I&#39;ll get around to porting the program to
  a more modern operating system, but in the meantime, here&#39;s the font. <BR> <BR><IMG
