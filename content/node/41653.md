  body: "Hi David,\r\nI have sent you a message. The catalog in possession of Peter,
    as Stephan suggested, should not have Forma in it, since it is from the 1950s
    and Forma was designed in the 1960s.\r\n\r\nEdit: Stefan, if you hear Rodrigo
    Cavazos, send him a big hug from me! :=)"

    be great, if you could take a look. Thanks.\r\n<em>(Claudio, I just sent you a
    reply, off site. Thank you. I also contacted some more people I remembered once
    noting/stating that they have Nebiolo specimens. I have/own one myself, but mine
    is older than the release of 'Forma', as well, I am afraid.)</em> Thank you, so
    much.\r\n\r\nDav(id)"

    it's \"pre Forma\" ;-) Anyway I found another specimen in the ever useful \"Encyclopaedia

    to Rodrigo next time I speak to him.\r\n\r\nDavid,\r\nI've sent you a scan of

    Formo in it. Could somebody put a small scan of Formo online? I would love to
    see it.

  body: "Claudio, Hmm, Why do I like 'Forma'? I may as well admit that I don't really
    'love it to death', but first of all, it sure may be because 'Forma' also is the
    name of a 'Design Bureau', I am currently establishing. ;) <em>(Forma/formlos)</em>
    And it's also a nice alternate to the known more or less 'neutral' Sans Serif
    types, like Helvetica, Akzidenz Grotesk, or Univers. <em>(Quite a mixture of influences.
    And maybe the 'lowest common denominator' of/in all these. ;)</em>\r\n\r\nDav(id)"
