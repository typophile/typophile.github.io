  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I feel that 10 years of almost exclusively computer-based writing have reduced what is left of my handwriting to an illegible and clumsy mess and quite frankly, I have had enough of it. I think I need to learn handwriting anew, from scratch, as it were, until I like what I see when I write by hand once again and until I (and of course everyone else) can decipher it as well.  Does anyone have links to websites and books on handwriting/calligraphy etc. that might be of use in my quest?</div>

This site is a nice starting point. Very nice capitals, if you ask me. 

I've done the same thing as you, btw. It's well worth to remember that this is very much a project that you can teach yourself without any instruction, if need be. Just sit down, rethink your letters, practice a lot and repeat.

The real problems come when trying to write your new handwriting quickly, something I haven't yet managed.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">There are many decent books on this subject and a few excellent ones too.
I like The Italic Way to Beautiful Handwriting by Fred Eager because
it has a solid italic model and a practical "cursive" mode as well.
I'm guessing it's out of print but I've seen many used for a few
dollars. Be sure to check in the Craft section of your local used
bookstore as calligraphy (or writing in this case) usually falls into
this section. Again, there are many others including the classic stuff
from Alfred Fairbank.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">You're not alone! Talking to my brother last night--who has never had to write much of anything by hand--and he said he sometimes forgets how to make certain letters. Has to consciously stop and think, then continue writing. (He also can't spell because spell check always does it for him.) I was truly surprised, but I guess it's not that uncommon. If you don't use it you lose it...
