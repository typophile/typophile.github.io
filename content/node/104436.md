body: "Following a request by a student asking how to cite Typophile for her graduate
  thesis,\_specifically, <em>how to cite and reference the same person multiple times
  from the same thread on a forum with pages as opposed to a single scroll</em>.\_I
  checked the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, Sixth
  Edition, only to discover that they actually don\u2019t have a proper way to do
  this. I expanded upon their recommendation, it and brought it to their attention.
  The main points are:\r\n\r\n1. Provide an in-text citation every time you cite something
  from Typophile.\r\n\r\n2. In your references, regardless of how many times you have
  cited the same person, you only need a reference for each group of citations by
  year. Provide another reference should you cite the same person from a different
  year \u2014 which is not uncommon for long threads. Below is an example of four
  in-text citations which span a two year period, which only requires 2 references:\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n\r\n<strong>In-text
  citations</strong>\r\n\r\n\u201CThis is the first quote or passage.\u201D (Dean,
  2008, September 7, Page 8, 17:33).\r\n\r\n\u201CThis is the second quote or passage.\u201D
  (Dean, 2008, December 22, Page 9, 09:02).\r\n\r\n\u201CThis is the third quote or
  passage.\u201D (Dean, 2009, January 6, Page 9, 17:45).\r\n\r\n\u201CThis is the
  fourth quote or passage.\u201D (Dean, 2009, January 11, Page 11, 12:22).\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>References</strong>\r\n\r\nDean,
  C. T. (2008). Re: Thread title [Online forum comment]. Retrieved from http://typophile.com/node/101331\r\n\r\nDean,
  C. T. (2009). Re: Thread title [Online forum comment]. Retrieved from http://typophile.com/node/101331\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n\r\nI
  also discovered a reason to use your real name as your screen name:\_Let\u2019s
  say you were citing Chris Lozos. You make the appropriate in-text citation (Lozos,
  C. 2000) and reference, but, when the reviewer goes to check the URL, all they will
  see is a screen name \u2014 dezcom, and they may be unable to validate your source.
  If a reviewer can\u2019t validate your source they may not let it be published,
  and you would have to remove content, citation, and reference entirely.\r\n\r\nIn
  conclusion, please be mindful that\_a failure to properly cite and reference a source,
  even an online forum, is\_<strong>plagiarism</strong>."
