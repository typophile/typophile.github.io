  typeface.\r\nI know I have seen it before, or something similar, just can remember
  where.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/853168ff81c92af852201de3b0052787_4603.jpg]"

  body: "Found the same image on a few visual poetry blogs, with references to the
    artist Sol Lewitt's \u201C122 variations on incomplete open cubes,\u201D which
    it resembles.\r\n\r\nSome even identify it as a typeface by Lewitt titled \u201CIncomplete
    Open Cubes,\u201D but I haven\u2019t found evidence of that assertion.\r\n\r\nRadim
    Pesko has a similar, but more dimensional, typeface inspired by Lewitt:\r\nhttp://www.radimpesko.com/fonts/sol\r\n\r\nOther
    Lewitt-inspired faces, but still no matches to your sample:\r\nhttp://www.curatedassortment.com/2010/07/roland-tiangco-sol-lewitt-font.html\r\nhttp://www.officeofyankallen.com/Sol-Lewitt-font"

    be perfect, if only it was able to be purchased.\r\n\r\nAppreciate the help."
