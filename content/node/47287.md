  very similar to it. I'm assuming he wants a tattoo of it or something of the like,
  I don't really know. It's definitely not the most attractive by far, but he's a
  friend so I thought I would help him out. \r\n\r\nAny suggestions?\r\n\r\nps- my
  apologies for the horrid image size.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/l_849394e329a8112da81f1490ce2280c2_4390.jpg]"
