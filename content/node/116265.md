  body: "Gulinda, please try to post smaller images in the future.\r\nThis looks like
    wood block lettering in a Clarendon style. Wooden Type Fonts has [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/woodentypefonts/clarendon-extended/?refby=bowfin|Clarendon
    Extended]], which even has the same shaped counters. It would need to be widened
    however to match your sample more closely.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega\r\n\r\n"
