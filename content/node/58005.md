body: "I will let Geometro rest for around a week, so now I made something new.\r\nI
  always wanted to make a nice sans-serif font of text purposes, so I started my first
  project on that.\r\nThe name is Sweet Sans for now (or is it right?/do you know
  a better name?). After making some glyphs, I realised I started a little bit thin,
  so this will be the Light/Thin version. I did not take a lot of time for spacing-
  and kerning details, etc.\r\n\r\nHere's a preview:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PreviewCrop_5535.PNG]\r\n\r\nSee
  the attachment for a PDF file of the glyphs I've made today.\r\nI thought, let's
  place it here now, before I screw up the rest. :P\r\nThis is my second big typeface
  project, first time completely in FontLab. :D\r\n\r\nI hope this will be a nice
  font. :)\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nMartijn van Berkel"

    type design. I like the contrast is weight, and the overall feel. I am not a type
    designer like most of the other readers of this site, but I could make a few suggestions:\r\n1)
    The rounded shapes of the bowls need optical compensation along the baseline etc.
    This will become more important as you design heavier weights. See below.\r\n\r\n2)
    Some of the letters, like the e, m, and n, are a little left leaning, which is
    nice. But some of the other letters, like the f and c, feel very upright. There's
    a little tension there. But that's kind of nit-picky.\r\n\r\nYou are off to a
    great start...\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Optical_5617.jpg]"

    now, I've been working on this font and the letters are finished now, together
    with a bunch of other glyphs. I've added a new PDF to the OP (\"MFSweetSansLightBeta.pdf\"),
    please review.\r\n\r\nReplies much appreciated. :)\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nMartijn

  body: "Good work. I'll make some comments: the oblique of the \xC6 seems to thick,
    same for the M, Y. Also, I think you should use an ink trap for letter with an
    oblique in it (M' N in particular) or reduce the thickness . You should work on
    the top of the bottom bowl of the B, this section should be higher a bit. The
    bottom left of the 3 seems too square or the top on is too  rounded. Keep going!

  body: "Hi Martijn :)\r\nThis looks good. Here are some observations (I'm no expert
    though!):\r\n@ looks very large.\r\nB needs a larger bottom bowl, smaller on top.
    \r\nC, G and J look perhaps a little narrow.\r\nI might consider giving K a different
    knee: a lower join with the bottom leg connected to the arm rather than the stem.
    Or take the arm and leg apart from the stem to give a bit more width?\r\nM looks
    narrow. \r\nOPQR are very pleasant.\r\nThe curves on S looks a bit like the curves
    go too far round into the spine. Perhaps you could make the spine a bit steeper
    with the BCPs nearer the extrema? See the S in [[http://typophile.com/node/45498|Modena
    Light]] to see what I mean. \r\nThe lc is looking really nice.\r\nI think the
    crossbar on e could afford to be a smidge lower.\r\nh could be slightly too wide?\r\nTail
    on j looks a bit long to me.\r\nThe bottom of the bowl of q should be more shaped
    like the bottom of the bowl of d (more upwards in the SE corner)\r\nThe arm on
    r looks a bit thin.\r\nTry making the crossbar on t a similar length to the foot.\r\nu
    looks wide.\r\nI usually prefer a straight y, but that's just my taste. \r\n\r\nGood
    luck and keep going :)\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi Martijn,\r\nThis is coming together impressively well! Congrats. I'm especially
    fond of the \"a\" and \"e\", they're truly beautiful. And the slight taper on
    top of the \"t\" is delicious! \r\nBut overall I'm most impressed with how well
    the \"system\" is expressed in all lettershapes. It looks quite mature. \r\n\r\nHere
    are some questions/observations (but I'm not an expert either):\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Maybe
    my biggest critique is that those letters that only have straight lines, especially
    diagonals, look a bit heavier and not as elegant as the \"curvy\" glyphs. Also,
    in some of these glyphs the joins are too dark (like in the \"M\" or \"w\") \u2013
    try some [more] inktraps for optical correction maybe, or widen the joins. (You
    might enjoy this article by Mark Jamra: <a href=\"http://www.typeculture.com/academic_resource/articles_essays/pdfs/tc_article_6.pdf\">link
    to PDF</a>, which explains some things about optical correction with useful before/after
    pictures.)\r\n<li>I wonder if you've tried to make the caps close together in
    width? The \"L\" seems rather wide, and the \"M\" (and maybe the \"K\") pretty
    narrow. Is that intentional?\r\n<li>Have you tried a \"t\" with a shorter foot,
    or a longer crossbar? This one looks nice, but it might be difficult to get the
    spacing right with that foot \"in the way\".\r\n<li>I'd suggest you give the stem-to-curve
    join of the \"r\" a closer look. It seems like the curve tapers less than in other
    comparable joins like the \"n\" etc.\r\n</ul>\r\nGreat work overall! Absolutely
    keep it up. :)\r\n"

    narrower and the K wider. In my eyes, the M is good now, but I will review it
    later. ;)\r\n3. I will try those two options out and see what's the best, or post
    them here for you to decide. :)\r\n4. I've updated the \"stem-to-curve joins\"
    a while ago, but it seems like I've forgotten the r. It's fixed now. ;)\r\n\r\nBTW:
    I have my doubts about the \"S\", \"s\" and the \"2\". Someone else too?\r\n\r\nKind

  body: "Hi Martijn, please remember I'm a learner too and take my observations more
    as questions than facts ;)\r\nThis is coming along very nicely indeed. I'm looking
    forward to seeing how you might approach a heavier weight.\r\nThe join of K is
    quite a dark spot. I think perhaps a solution might be to make the arm and leg
    one stroke, just touching the vertical, rather than have the top arm branching
    from the stem and the leg branching from the arm. Does that make sense?\r\nM and
    N have maybe dark blobs at the junctures. I'd trap the counters slightly or thin
    them some more.\r\nThe crossbar on Q is unusual and slightly looks broken. I like
    the idea of tapering it inwards but there is a discontinuity between the inner
    and outer contours that is a bit arresting.\r\nR's bowl is a bit wide in comparison
    to the supporting leg. Not sure whether the leg could be pushed out or the bowl
    brought in.\r\nS I think looks a bit too wide next to T. Middle vertex of W needs
    lightening??\r\nX could do with some optical correction; the crossover looks discontinuous
    \u2014 check Mark Jamra's article about this.\r\nI'd add more rigour to the curves
    of e. To me it needs more superelliptical shoulders. It might do with being slightly
    wider too? Compare with o.\r\nI think your l is causing problems in text. The
    foot is pretty long and creates wide spaces as Nina observed with the t.\r\nLowercase
    m is quite narrow compared to n. w and x maybe need similar treatment to W and
    X.\r\nI think ring should have no observable stroke contrast. Not sure where I
    read that, sorry. It looks rather large to me. But I am not too familiar with
    its design.\r\nTh ligature has an unbalanced crossbar \u2014 the stem of T is
    not centred?\r\nI'll refrain from judging your numerals since I find them totally
    impossible to get looking anything like I hope. ;)\r\nHope that might be useful.
    Keep it up! :)\r\n"
