<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hello typofriends.
Since the first days of 2007 i decide to come back to the field of type.
I like to share the first font from my re-starting new effort to become a typedesigner.
Picara is a sanserif organic font, with local vernacular references, a little condensed proportions, dark color, roman humanist model(Jenson)and open counterforms.
I want to keep armonic rithm of vernacular letters, without distracting too much the attention of the reader. The propose for this font is to work from 7 to 12 pts, in magazines and books, with a family of the 4 classic weights: Roman, SmallCaps, Italic and Bold.
The end strokes follow a strong left-right "italic rithm" in the lowercases; Do you see the same in the uppercases?
There are some characteristics that i want to follow, for example, the monetary lowercase signs aligned to the x weight old style figure numbers.¿is this weird for commercial standard requirements?
More details to look at in this first complete version of the roman, in the character set attached in the pdf.
Best Regards,
mh.

<div class=commentbody>Miguel - I've said it elsewhere already, but this is looking wonderful. This warm, organic finish will be a hit, especially in these days of soft'n'cozy, but Picara doesn't feel trendy.
The bowl of the 'a' might be just a tad too small for text sizes. It's the only counter in danger of clogging.
> There are some characteristics that i want to follow, for example, the monetary lowercase signs aligned to the x weight old style figure numbers.
No reason not to do both. Make a Lining Figures version of the font with punctuation and monetary symbols that match the uppercase.</div>

<div class=commentbody>"Pícara" is a word that describes an attitude and a whole language present is the popular folckore warm humor, very rich on slangs, with a touch of erotism.
Translation words: rascal/naughty/cunning
My favorite newspaper use this language (lacuarta.cl), and off course, Picara is a metaphoric type interpretation of vernacular lettering and this chilean popular language.

<div class=commentbody>I like this. The 'softness' of it is nice.
Only thing that comes to mind right now is, as Stephen Coles already mentioned, the bowl of the 'a'. That looks a bit too small maybe.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I really like this design. Here is what I wonder about; Could the UC C be more exciting like the other glyphs? It lacks some of the tension they have. The S & s both seem to be rolling foreward to me a little. I see how the font holds together with the top being where is is so maybe rather than pulling the top back the rest of the form could change. Does the lc eth bend over to far? The lc o feels a little heavy to me compaed to the e & a. I like the dimunation of the dollar sign. The upper case Thorn is super nice!</div>

<div class=commentbody>I really love the flow of this typeface and I think it will work great for body text. The only thing I'm worried about are, as people already mentioned, the bowl of the a. It may be a bit too narrow. I'm also wondering why the end of the descender of the 4 are toward left?
Great work!</div>

<div class=commentbody>This is excellent. One thing that looks out place is the florin: it's rather wide and square-looking, and should probably descend instead of ascend. Not that anyone uses the florin, but it's there.</div>

<div class=commentbody>The a in the ae ligature looks a bit slapped on, the forms dont really flow together.
The ß is a bit too wide, I think. And its lower bowl too small (don't use the s for that).
Re the florin: maybe you should line up the horizontal strike thru with the one in the sterling etc. And do elongate it and maybe give it a bit of a cursive slant (that's common usage in the Low Countries).
The ampersand is a bit unbalanced. Maybe the lower bowl a bit larger and the upper smaller?
The cedille needs to beef up.
Sounds like a lot — but I do like this design. Makes me wish I could do something like it ; )</div>

<div class=commentbody>It has quite nice proportions, Miguel.
I don't know why, but the first impression I had is that is somewhat "falling backwards" (the terminal modulations probably give this overall impression, which is reinforced by the fact some glyphs (like the S, s, numerals 3, 5, 7, 9) does not have this. Maybe it could benefit to slat it very very little to the right.
May I ask you: do you know when Alejandro Lo Celso's Australis will be made finally available to license?</div>
