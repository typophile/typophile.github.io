  body: Letragraphica was a subset of Letraset, and I seem to remember waiting every
    six months of so for each new catalog.

  body: "Thanks oldnick. I have a chance to pick up a copy of Letragraphica, Characteres
    Letraset D'Avant Garde 1977 and I was wondering if there were other catalogues
    I can also look for. \r\n\r\nThe content is inspirational stuff - well to me it
    is anyways. After some digging I found that volume featured on -  http://acejet170.typepad.com/foundthings/2007/06/index.html
    (shown down at the bottom of the page).\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I have an incomplete set of Letraset supplementary catalogs from the Seventies
    and Eighties. Only a few are what you could call Letragraphica catalogs, but most
    of them have Letragraphica faces in them:\r\n\r\n18 New Type Faces / Letragraphica
    / Featuring Letraset International Typeface Competition Winners 1973 (1973)\r\n\r\nRange
    Extension 1974\r\n\r\nLetragraphica 16, 17, and 18 (1974)\r\n\r\nLetragraphix
    Number Two (features Ray Cruz; no date, probably 1975)\r\n\r\nNew Typefaces 1976\r\n\r\nLetragraphix
    Number Three (designed by Kit Hinrichs, 1976)\r\n\r\nCatalog Supplement '77 (1977)\r\n\r\nLetragraphix
    Volume Four (designed by SVA students, 1977)\r\n\r\nThe Letragraphica Gallery
    (purple, orange and red cover; no date, but probably 1977 or 1978)\r\n\r\nThe
    Letragraphica Gallery (black and brown cover; no date, but probably 1979)\r\n\r\nLetragraphix
    Volume 6 (no date, probably 1979)\r\n\r\nSweet Treats (1980)\r\n\r\nLetragraphix

    typefaces were announced in the catalog.)\r\n\r\nOne other thing: These were all
    U.S. editions.\r\n"

    I see a few others I'm going to hunt down too.\r\n\r\nThanks for mentioning Kit
    Hinrichs, I hadn't heard his name before. I took a look at some of his stuff online
    and read a few articles/interviews, he seems well grounded."

  body: 'The Letragraphix editions featured well known designers and illustrators.
    The early ones look more like brochures, the later ones look more like newsletters
    (more text). A bit of trivia: Letragraphix Volume 6 features the winners of the
    "Liberated Letter" contest, and one of the winning entries is by Rick Tharp. The
    "Art-I-Fact" editions are not as nice-looking.'
