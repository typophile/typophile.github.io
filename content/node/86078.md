  about a month, and just barely mustered up the guts to sign up.  Anyhow, I'm creating
  a logo for a personal business of mine for designing print work.  Which will hopefully
  one day include web design.  Below are a couple logos I have been working on, in
  their beginning stages.\r\n\r\nAny feedback would be greatly appreciated, thank
  you!\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://typophile.com/files/design_addict_studio.png\"> "

  body: "The top \"pill\" doesn't read as a pill. I would suggest never running lines
    directly through letters. Also, I would try to freehand the script rather than
    using a script font (or at least use a font with different \"d\"s).\r\n\r\nThe
    second one's a better start, but I'm not a fan of the monogram. It's too busy.
    In my opinion, if you eliminate the monogram and leave just the full name you'd
    have a pretty good basis for a logo.\r\n\r\nAnother alternative: Have you considered
    [[http://drugs.medsort.com/Drugs/Images/PillAtlas/C1040035wtmk.jpg|that pills
    have acronyms/IDs printed in a simple font like this]]? That kind of style, a
    horizontal pill with just \"DAS\" might be convincing, with an optional wordmark
    underneath. That gives you a versatile logo, a simple one (the pill) for branding
    and then a full version when appropriate. That's a good system for a long name."

    my opinion you should find a solution that communicates you are a design addict
    in a positive way.\r\n"

  body: "could this be one of those acceptable usage? i actually like the idea and
    possible execution. is there a visual that could replace a pill - eraser, pen
    cap, bottle...etc.\r\n\r\nI'd do without the monogram though and widen the pill
    and less roundness on the pill ends. "

  body: i prefer the horizontal pill - it's so damn hard to get those things to stand
    up on end
