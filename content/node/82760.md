  tables probably aren't very practical, but they sure look cool. They're by Alessandro
  Canepa and Andrea Paulicelli, two designers from Italy. They're available for sale.
  The height is adjustable so you can overlap letters.\r\n\r\nI saw them here:\r\nhttp://lookslikegooddesign.com/type-tables-canepa-paulicelli/\r\n\r\nPage
  at the designer's site that describes them:\r\nhttp://www.outdoorzgallery.com/aa_font\r\n\r\n"
