body: How come character map doesn't show me alt codes for every glyph? And what's
  the logic behind the numeration?

  body: "I think those codes are only for ASCII-8 characters. Note that the leading
    zero is a \"trigger\", so you really only have 1000 possible codes anyway. But
    only 0 to 255 are implemented. In fact try Alt-0321: you get \"A\". Because 321
    = 65 (the code for \"A\") plus 256. So it's just cycling through (like how 370
    degrees is the same as 10 degrees).\r\n\r\nAnd logic?!  :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Microsoft. Logic. Choose one.\r\n\r\nThe initial zero is a trigger allright,
    but for the incoming strokes to be interpreted as Windows-1252 or Unicode (on
    later and chromier Windowses) instead of CP437 or whatever your local DOS codepage
    is.\r\n\r\nThe zero may not be needed on DOS-less Windows (anything after XP,
    I think), but I don't know for sure."

    like EBCDIC or something.\r\n\r\nBTW, I'm pretty sure the ASCII (even -8) arrangement
    predates Microsoft.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Nah... I don't think Microsoft ever did EBCDIC. Too IBMish, even for them.
    No, I'm sure the Win98 user manual said that without the zero, it went by the
    DOS code page, and my own checks seem to confirm that with Alt-165 returning \xD1
    and Alt-224 returning \xD3, both proper for code page 850."

  body: When I shell out to DOS it does. In Windows I only get ASCII approximations.
    Guess that's to be expected, since Windows-1252 does not have the borders anyway.

    &ndash; Nope, not even when I choose Terminal (an OEM/DOS font) in Notepad. Mind,
    the zero prefix does the trick, then.\r\n\r\nOf course, the Win98 machine has
    accumulated all sorts of patches and stuff, and I can no longer remember if using
    the DOS codes worked fully on base Win98.\r\n\r\n@Theunis &ndash; I recall (re)writing
    some UI routines in Turbo Pascal, which was of course the <em>other</em> language
    for the laity after GWBASIC.\r\n\r\nYuck. Never liked Microsoft-style BASICs.
    But then, I did own a QL."

    Pascal, eh? I used to put up \"Dijkstra is a Wimp\" flyers at my school. When

    for me either, but CN does it, well, out of the retro-box! I didn't even had to

    shows that Unicode nowadays includes rounded corners to match. And they added
    a little bit more order to the set ... My bottom line in the image shows codes
    179 to 202 (ish), a pretty random order.\r\n\r\nIt <em>would</em> be cool to see
    the box set in a modern font -- matching the rest of the font in style, of course!"
