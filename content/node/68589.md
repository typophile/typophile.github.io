body: Although I've embedded every version of TNR available on my machine in Acrobat-Pro9,
  it's clear that that PDF representation of TNR 10pt lacks the same solidity/density
  that it has in MSWord. Tildes, for instance, appear broken, losing the delicate
  curve. Suggestions?

  body: Are you sure that the various versions of TNR actually got embedded in the
    PDFs? I ask because TNR is one of the 14 base fonts that by default does not get
    embedded.

  body: 'Thank you both for your responses. Strangely, the problem seems to have fixed
    itself (almost). That is, if I go directly from MSWord using the Acrobat tab,
    the resulting PDF is much better looking than if I start with Acrobat and OpenFile.
    The tilde is still doesn''t seem completely solid, but close enough. And yes,
    I did check the properties of the document, and it does contain the different
    forms of TNR. Thanks again. '
