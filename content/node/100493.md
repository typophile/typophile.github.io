  identifying typefaces or finding similar ones:\r\n\r\n1.) A photo of vaudeville
  world wrestling champion Ernst Roeber's cafe in NYC in 1908. Can anyone recognize
  typefaces or know any that are very close to ANY of the  type in this picture. It
  can be the prominent ones you see on the marquee or something from the window or
  smaller signage in the background. \r\n\r\n2.) This is a poster also related to
  Ernst Roeber from 1898. I posted recently to see if anyone could recognize the typeface(s)
  in it or something very close. People were kind enough to give suggestions but nothing
  has really come close yet so I thought I would give it another shot. \r\n\r\nThanks
  very much!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/roeber_cafe_5777.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/704px-Roeber_and_Crane_Bros_4355._Vaudeville_Athletic_Co.,_Ernst_Roeber,_champion_of_the_world,_wrestling_poster,_1898.jpg]"

  body: "On closer inspection, I have to conclude this is hand-lettered. \r\n\r\nAt
    the top, the letter 'R' in 'Roeber and Crane Bros' has four 'R's. Each is just
    slightly different from all the others. The same is true for the letter 'O' in
    'Roeber' and in 'Bros'.\r\n\r\nExamine 'Champion Of The World', with emphasis
    on the lower-case 'o's. None of them are alike. Very similar, but each instance
    is just slightly different from all the others.\r\n\r\nWhen this poster was designed,
    hand-lettering was a big part of the illustrator's bag o' tricks. Today, that
    skill is almost a 'lost art', and that's a shame. The suggestions that have already
    been made are excellent, and will be your best starting point if you're planning
    to modify them to create similar letterforms."

    flat letters with 90\xB0 edges which are okay for what they are but they\u2019re
    not in the same league as the fully dimensional ones on that gorgeous storefront."
