    but you can go to this link of <a href=\"http://jeff.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/filipino.html\"
    target=\"new\">Filipino type designers</a> and various dialect typefaces (there
    are quite a few links).\r\n\r\nHope this helps. And yes, my father, Norberto Flores
    Florendo was born north of Manila.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\nYes,
    I'm old, but I'm back in style!"
