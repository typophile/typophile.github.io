  aesthetic (albeit lightly). The use is on playing cards (landscape orientation)
  where the title is set in a large size [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/filmotype/modern/|Filmotype
  Modern]] and the captions and play instructions are set in a rugged Serif (after
  a wide search [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/066font/kulfonus-no-2/|Kulfonus No
  2]] is my best candidate). My question is: what do people think about these two
  fonts, particularly using them together? Thanks.'
