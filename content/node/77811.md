  I'm in the process of a personal website redesign that should look like it dates
  from the 16-18th centuries. While I have the graphics figured out, I'm a bit stumped
  regarding typefaces to use.\r\n\r\nI'm absolutely in love with the <a href=\"http://iginomarini.com/fell/the-revival-fonts/\">Fell
  types</a> by Igino Marini, particularly <em>Great Primer and DW Pica</em>. They
  are a revival of 17th century typefaces, so they would fit my design nicely.\r\n\r\n<img

  title=\"IM Fell DW Pica\" />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://iginomarini.com/fell/wp-content/uploads/fell_gp.jpg\"
  width=\"540\" title=\"IM Fell Great Primer\" />\r\n\r\nProblem is, <em>I'm not too
  sure about on-screen readability</em>. They have been hinted and kerned extensively,
  it seems; but part of their appeal (irregular letterforms) is also the reason they
  may not be completely legible on screen.\r\n\r\nI have tried them in Firefox on
  Windows XP, and they seem okay. But I'm no typophile by any means! They would definitely
  make for lovely display faces, but what about body text? <em>Do they make you want
  to read the content, or are they hard to read?</em> I've encountered them in use
  at <a href=\"http://blog.hypsometry.com/\">http://blog.hypsometry.com/</a>.\r\n\r\nIf
  so, could anybody suggest alternatives for 16-18th century body typefaces? Preferably
  freely licensed for @font-face use. I'm currently looking at <a href=\"http://friedrichalthausen.de/?page_id=411\">Vollkorn</a>
  and <a href=\"http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Cardo\">Cardo</a>.\r\n\r\nAny help
  would be greatly appreciated!"

    it on the screen in smaller sizes. As for alternatives, I would have a look over
    at FontDeck http://fontdeck.com/ and TypeKit http://typekit.com/\r\n\r\nThey have
    loads of typefaces ready for the web and fair prices for licenses too.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck!"

    to read *at all*. (The forced justification without hyphenation doesn\u2019t help
    either.)"

  body: Yeah, I tried to use it at small sizes and found that legibility/readability
    varied wildly across operating systems and browsers. They are served by google
    [ http://code.google.com/webfonts ] so they load quickly though. I have screenshots
    somewhere...probably on my other computer. It's too bad - I love those fonts.

  body: "Why not use Fell for headlines and one of the core fonts for text? That way
    you address both functionality (core fonts for readable text) and design (webfont
    in headlines to signal a certain mood, hinting at a certain time period, place,
    etc).\r\n\r\nIMO the possibility of using webfonts resulted in a somewhat irrational
    hype around them, an urge to use them even when they do not improve anything,
    neither in terms of functionality nor in terms of design. As to the former: Very
    few fonts get rasterized well enough on certain platforms that they really help
    the readers of a website \u2013 especially when compared with the core fonts.
    As to the latter: Given the low resolution of screens and thus small ppem sizes
    at which fonts get rasterized, there is not much of a chance for fonts to differ
    much from another at text sizes. So even from a design point of view, it does
    not necessarily make sense to use webfonts for everything.*\r\n\r\nYou might make
    your decisions with two questions in mind: Does using a special (web)font make
    a noticeable difference? Can I achieve the intended visual effect by different
    means too?\r\n\r\n* One example. This morning I noticed that a design firm started
    using some sanserif webfont for headlines, at a rather small size. I thought:
    what's the point of it? what differences does it make? In this case a bold Helvetica
    or Arial would have done the job too ..."

    for only display sizes. So what about alternatives for a body typeface, something
    very classical/old-style?\r\n\r\nI like <a href=\"http://friedrichalthausen.de/?page_id=411\">Vollkorn</a>
    a lot. It comes in regular, true italic and bold too. Any other options? From
    FontSquirrel or Google Webfonts?\r\n\r\nThanks again!"

  body: "Hi all. The Hypsometry blog's mine, and I'm happy to hear a little feedback
    about how the Fell types look on it. Like Mesonprojekt, I think Marini's revivals
    are simply beautiful.\r\n\r\nKentlew, I'm curious what browser and OS you're viewing
    my site on? The type as I see it, at the sizes I'm using it at, looks pretty good,
    and I've done a fair amount of browser testing. But as Mugford points out, there
    is a lot of variance amongst possible browser / OS combinations.\r\n\r\nThe browsers
    use different justification techniques too - for instance, I think the justification
    looks reasonably good (not amazing, but definitely decent) in Safari, but Chrome
    (which, of course, uses Webkit, and thus should be identical) spaces the lines
    much worse.\r\n\r\nAh, designing for the web. Always fun.\r\n\r\nThanks for any
    specific comments or observations you might have."

  body: "Hi cboone,\r\n\r\nYour blog looks passable on my work computer, but has some
    issues with thins and thicks in the body text.\r\n\r\nWindows XP, default grayscale
    antialiasing, Firefox 3.6.13:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hypsographyblog_winXP_FF3_6289.png]\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nWindows
    XP, default grayscale antialiasing, Internet Explorer 6 (the standard at the state
    agency where I work!):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hypsographyblog_winXP_IE6_3442.png]\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever,
    your blog is actually more legible than the I Love Typography website, so you
    have that going for you...\r\n\r\nWindows XP, default grayscale antialiasing,
    Firefox 3.6.13:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ilt_winXP_FF3_6443.png]\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n(IE6
    is actually slightly better on that website). Nothing against ilovetypography.com,
    it's a great website.\r\n\r\nWhen browsing on Windows or any computer with a lo-res
    monitor, I personally still prefer websites that use Georgia and Verdana at small
    text sizes, simply because they just don't use antialiasing AT ALL (due to their
    built-in hinting) at small sizes. On my Macbook Air at home, it seems to be less
    of a problem because the pixel resolution is higher and OS X uses a different
    text engine - but most people don't use macs.\r\n\r\nI will probably continue
    to wince at sites that use webfonts until hinting/screen/rasterization technologies
    improve."

    I think the OP might have summed it up right at the start: <cite>\u201C.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

    interesting at all. But my gut response to the site is: I\u2019m just not inclined
    to try to read it. Too much work.\r\n\r\nBut it seems like you\u2019re targeting
    an audience that is prequalified and highly disposed to want to get at your content

    also glanced at it just now with Safari 4.0.4. \r\n\r\nRenders larger by default,
    for some reason, which is a little less off-putting. But then, for example, in
    the IX section, it\u2019s randomly clipping entire lines as I scroll. Just FYI:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Hypsometry-SafariClipping_4673.png]"
