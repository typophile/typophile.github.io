  or dont make sense : )\r\n\r\nI was after peoples opinions about fonts they like
  to use for Corporate Identities, not really the actual name of the company but rather
  addresses, names, numbers ect and what size do you usually go for?\r\n\r\nI know
  certain fonts require certain sizes. But any responses would be appreciated.\r\n\r\ncheers"

    you mean some fonts look best between certain sizes?\r\n\r\nI think what you are
    talking about is the way letterhead & business cards are handled. Basically what
    I have seen is that the bigger the business the smaller the type. This is over-simple
    but it seems to be true. There is a good reason for this. A bigger business needs
    to be able to print a wider range of names and addresses. Some names and addresses
    are longer than others - and you will want to future proof the design just in
    case the business grows. \r\n\r\nAs to the font, I will suggest that Helvetica
    gets used a lot. And News Gothic. But a formula should be avoided. This is meant
    to be creative work...\r\n\r\nBTW It's a good idea to make the title a bit more
    descriptive of your question in the future. It fact you may want to change it
    if you want more responses."

  body: My guess is that you're asking what fonts people like for names and phone
    numbers on stationery and business cards. The actual font will generally depend
    on what the font used in the company name is, as they need to fit well together.
    But generally I prefer sans serif faces in this use, which often runs at smaller
    sizes.

  body: "Yeah I was trying to mean what Don pointed out. I mean compare for example
    Arial/Lucida Grande at 12pt with Copperplate/Garamond 12pt and see the difference.
    Not that you would like to put these fonts together or anything. \r\n\r\nI like
    using the sans serifs too, and love to overindulge in some Geneva when I can.
    Permitting its fits in with the company name.\r\n\r\n'Gud job eye listened to
