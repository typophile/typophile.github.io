body: Hi Guys, <BR> <BR>Anybody know of any fonts like/along the same lines as these
  <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.pixelpyro.co.uk/font.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.pixelpyro.co.uk/font.jpg</a>
  <BR>or <BR><a href="http://www.totallyspies.com/logo.gif" target="_blank">http://www.totallyspies.com/logo.gif</a>
  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m after a &#34;fat script&#34; sort of feel. I realise that the logo
  above is not a font but that is the sort of feel I am after for a logo myself <BR>
  <BR> <BR>Thanks
