  the typeface</strong>.\r\nDesigned by Ale Paul.\r\n\r\nThere is plenty of lyric
  and literature about looking over one\u2019s shoulder in contemplation. What would
  you have done differently if you knew then what you know now? This is the kind of
  question that comes out of nowhere. When it does and whether its context is personal
  or professional make very little difference. It\u2019s a question that can cause
  emotions to rise and passions to run hot. It can trigger priority shifts and identity
  crises. It\u2019s never easy to answer.\r\n\r\nThree years ago, I published a font
  called Semilla. My aim with that was to distill the work of Bentele, a lettering
  artist from early 1950s Germany. Picking such an obscure figure back then was my
  way of pondering the meaning and efficiency of objectivity in a world where real
  human events and existences are inevitably filtered through decades of unavoidably
  subjective written, printed and oral history. And maybe to pat myself on the back
  for surviving surprises mild and pleasant.\r\n\r\nHaving been fortunate enough to
  follow my professional whims for quite some time now, I took another, longer look
  at my idea of distilling Bentele\u2019s work again. I suppose the concepts of established
  history and objectivity can become quite malleable when personal experience is added
  to the mix. I say that because there I was, three years later, second-guessing myself
  and opining that Bentele\u2019s work can be distilled differently, in a manner more
  suited to current cultural angles. So I embarked on that mission, and <strong><a
  href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/bowling-script/?refby=alepaul\">Bowling
  Script</a></strong> is the result. I realize that it\u2019s difficult to reconcile
  this soft and happy calligraphic outcome with the introspection I've blathered about
  so far, but it is what is. I guess even self-created first world problems need to
  be resolved somehow, and the resolution can happen in mysterious ways.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typofeatu_6566.png]\r\n\r\n<strong><a
  href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/bowling-script/?refby=alepaul\">Bowling
  Script</a></strong> is what people who like my work would expect from me. It\u2019s
  yet another script loaded with all kinds of alternation, swashing and over-the-top
  stuff. All of that is in here. These days I think I just do all that stuff without
  even blinking. But there are two additional twists.\r\n\r\nThe more noticeable one
  is ornamental: The stroke endings in the main font are of the typical sharp and
  curly variety found in sign painting, while the other font complements that with
  ball endings, sometimes with an added-on-afterwards impression rather than an extension
  of the actual stroke. In the philosophical terms I was mumbling earlier, this is
  the equivalent of alternate realities in a world of historical reduxes that by their
  very nature can never properly translate original fact.\r\n\r\nThe second twist
  has to do with the disruption of angular rhythm in calligraphic alphabets. Of course,
  this is the kind of lettering where the very concept of rhythm can be quite flexible,
  but it still counts for something, and experimenting with angular white space in
  a project of a very dense footprint was irresistible. After playing for a bit, I
  decided that it would interesting to include the option of using optically back-slanted
  forms in the fonts. Most scripts out there, including mine, have a rhythm sonically
  comparable to four-to-the-floor club beats. So the weirdly angled stuff here is
  your chance to do the occasional drumroll. Everyone knows we need one of those sometimes.\r\n\r\n<strong><a
