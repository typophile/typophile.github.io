  about some others? Thanks..."

    work. Also, fonts that would easily enable the branding of a special exhibit,
    be it for a classical orientation or a contemporary one, as examples. '

  body: "This is akin to asking \"what's a good company font\" before designing a
    logo.\r\n\r\nI think you should seek a typeface that fits the exhibit rather than
    one that fits museums in a broad sense."

  body: "I think of museum fonts in terms of \"microsignage\". That is, the small
    labels and placards that accompany exhibits, along with the larger, text heavy
    posters explaining the exhibits. This is related to, but not the same as, the
    fonts on the wayfinding signs that direct you through and between exhibits, but
    those could be included in the superset of museum fonts as well.\r\n\r\nI can't
    help but keep thinking of how to redesign the signs in the Rosicrucian Egyptian
    Museum in San Jose. they have some labels on their exhibits that haven't been
    changed since they were typed in the '60s (like, on a typewriter, man).\r\n\r\n(not
    much of an answer, more of a comment)"

    question, I'm helping with an exhibit of Matthew Carter's fonts for Microsoft
    during Typecon. Which font should we use on the captions for artifacts?"

    available as an expanded family called [[http://www.typography.com/catalog/verlag/index.html|Verlag]]).
    I'd love to hear more about fonts designed for museums or art galleries, as I
    work in-house at an art gallery. We are considering a re-design of our corporate
    style and this would be an excellent starting point for considering new house
    fonts.\r\n"
