body: "Hi, everyone.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a really fat font. The fattest. It can
  be almost unreadable. Preferably slightly organic. Like every letter was bitten
  by a snake on saturday, and no medical help is readily available. Or was comically
  decompressed in outer space. Or is just about to eat a last mint.\r\n\r\nFinding
  it hard to locate anything like it and would very much appreciate help on this one.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for helping!"

  body: "@Form Function: Welcome to Typophile. Can you tell us a bit more about your
    context? It may provide people with greater insight, and allow them provide you
    with more informed recommendations (and prevent random shots across the bow).
    It may even be possible that the solution lies in the treatment of the type, and
    not it\u2019s selection.\r\n\r\nAn example an old professor used to illustrate
    this point was a client asking a designer to build a door. They spent days talking
    about blue doors, green doors, screen doors, french doors, sliding doors, rotating
    doors &c. After several failed attempts, the designer asked the client \u201CWhy
    do you want a door?\u201D The client replied \u201CSo I can provide my guests
    with privacy.\u201D The designer replied \u201COh, well if what you want is <em>privacy</em>,
    there are many things other than a door we can do for that. A bent hallway or
    flight of stairs to obfuscate view, sound dampening walls, a guest house &c. By
    identifying privacy, a whole new set of solutions presented themselves. If memory
    serves, this was from a lecture on the role of rhetoric and semiotics in the design
    process.\r\n\r\nMy father used to use a medical analogy: \u201CDon\u2019t tell
    me what kind of treatment you want, just tell me where it hurts.\u201D\r\n\r\nIt
    has also been my experience that members tend to get more feedback if they use
    their real names as their screen names. It used to be somewhat of a convention.\r\n\r\nAnd
    remember: May the fonts be with you\u2122."

    comment! \r\n\r\nIt only took about twenty years for me to find that figure ...lol.
    I always admired guys like Dondi, Haring, Basquiat, et al, who could create a
    coolio stick figure almost as a second nature of expression. So natch I wanted
    to create my own. It's more of a squiggle man than a stick man but hey I'll take
    it :)!!\r\n\r\nAnd what I really dig most about the figure is it's my name/signature.
    \r\n\r\nThe feet form an /N/ and up from there is the rest of my first name. The
    head is a /C/ and the rest of my last name down from there. So the mark doubles
    as a gestural figure and as my signature.  I've snuck it into a couple of important
    graphics as a main feature ...hehe. It's gestural qualities and figural relationship
    compliment a manufactured element(s).\r\n\r\nAnd thanks also for asking about
    my identity ready to go  yet ... I'll have it ready sometime during the Spring
    ...long time coming.  \r\n\r\nForm Function, you still here??? \r\n\r\nHave you
    found a satisfactory thump of plump??? \r\n\r\nn.\r\n"

    reply.\r\nFor this particular project there were no need for context to chose
    a font. I needed it for a very specific use, and I felt that the keywords I gave
    were descriptive enough by far.\r\nYour professors example is a good one, and
    I try my best to think like this in my process.\r\nReal name? Yes, I guess you
    are right. I will think about it.\r\n\r\n@hrant\r\nI know that I came across as
    rude when I said that, but I do not think you are right. Read my descriptions,
    and then look at some of the examples. They are not even close to what I asked
    for. But then again, I do feel a little like an asshole when saying this. I think
    you're right when you say that people are just trying to help, I just don't think
    that their effort was completely thought through. Their enthusiasm for showing
    their own work trumped my wishes.\r\n\r\nAgain, I do understand that I come across

    give it a fat chance. \r\n\r\nThe letter shapes were done by stroking a skinny
    old normal sans serif font (one with slightly rounded corners) in Illustrator.
    I tried applying the same technique to a slab serif and the result was just as
    much a splat of fat except it had square corners. To apply a stroke and maintain
    the letter shape characteristics just use the drop down menu in the Appearance
    palette. Select Add Stroke (I think that's what it known as) and make sure to
    arrange the Stroke layer below the Type layer in the layer stack of the Appearance
    palette.\r\n\r\nTo bad your project went in another direction.\r\n\r\nn.   "
