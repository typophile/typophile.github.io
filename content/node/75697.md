  Stella McCartney logo, but could anyone please suggest any similar fonts to this
  logo as the Stella McCartney suggestions are not quite right! Would like a font
  that is not digital looking, more elegant and has as few dots as possible, as I'm
  looking to have it die cut so need the dots at a reasonable size.\r\n\r\nThis is
  probably a commissioned job that has be drawn but any font suggestions welcome.\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "The problem is that, the fewer the dots, the harder is for the typeface to
    appear \u201Cmore elegant\u201D.\r\nYou can see it for yourself following the
    tag-links on the pages I linked to.\r\n\r\nEdit: anyway, you can always modify
    the Fontstruct\u2019s one to fit your needs."

  body: "Thanks, just wanted to see what was out there first I'll probably have to
    draw it up myself. \r\nThe elegance was more of a reference to being not so digital
    and I need few dots so that the individual dot size if is big enough when scaled
    up to die cut on a letterhead!\r\n\r\n"
