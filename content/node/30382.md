  font to ID is the one from the \"BENQ\" phrase, I know that \"It Zone\" was written
  in Times New Roman Italic... I already try Gill Sans but none of the characters
  fits... perhaps some other font similar to Gill Sans?\r\n\r\nWell, I'll be around...\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nQ\u2122

  body: Logos are often custom designed in order to insure a distinctive look. I think
    we're seeing a letterer's work influenced by Gill.

  body: "Stephen:\r\n\r\nYeah, I can understand what you're saying... I've done it
    myself, but I refuse to believe that this designer would have the \"custom spirit\"
    in mind when he (or she) created the arrange, I wish to think that he (or she)
    just typed the word and didn't care for any distinctive look...\r\n\r\nBut, that's
    just me talking right?\r\n\r\nThanks for the thought Stephen!! \r\n\r\nAnyone?
    any ideas?\r\n\r\nQ\u2122 Says: It's all about the Fonts!!"

  body: '"BenQ" is almost certainly custom, as it is unicase (mixing upper- and lowercase
    letters of the same height). In order to create a unicase in which each letter
    has the same weight or thickness (as they are here), you need to alter whatever
    typeface you are using. If the designer just typed it and made the e and n bigger,
    they would be much, much thicker than the B and Q.'

  body: "Hi:\r\n\r\nOk, I give up, it is a custom job... I did a little research,
    and definitively looks like it, I only needed to trace the logo for a small Ad
    application, so Thank God BENQ.COM publishes their annual reports online (in PDF
    format), so Adobe\u2122 Illustrator did the job for me...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BENQhigh_4680.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    If anyone ever knows its origin, it would be appreciated...\r\n\r\nThanks ya'll\r\n\r\nQ\u2122
