  body: Very nice. I'd love to see a print sample. Really like the f, and the e looks
    to be breaking up a bit, but this is on screen.

  body: Reminds me of freight micro. I like it a lot. I think the e may have problems.

  body: Be carefull with those lowercase 'e's... the horizontal stress needs to be
    balanced. Since you're saying that this is meant to be read in small sizes, it
    will tend do disapear.... ;)

    think the Freight Micro vibe is coming from the squared counter moments, which
    is a dwiggins move, and an inspiration source for Mr. Darden."

  body: "Your lowercase x will give you problems when it gets smaller.  The lowercase
    g will also be a problem, not enough space between the upper and lower bowls.
    It looks ok in display, but that is not its intended use.\r\n\r\nAs will the default
    spacing which seems way too tight for its intended use. Both the word and the
    inter-character spacing. Kinda weird to me to design a typeface intended for small
    sizes and not show a sample of it at small sizes.\r\n\r\nYou should proof the
    design at its intended size, and not get too concerned with what it looks like
    large.  Also, all those soft edges may render strangely in small sizes, you better
    pay close attention to how you hint it."
