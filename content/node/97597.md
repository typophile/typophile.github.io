  I've decided not to ask noob questions on the forum. Also i had recently gotten
  into trouble with my FL studio. When ever i open a glyph cell i had to open the
  tools toolbar again and again. I didn't know what the problem was. I wanted to post
  it in typophile forums but I had restrained myself from doing so. I never knew i
  would find the actual solution but today i miraculously found the solution. I had
  the autohide feature turned on( i just wondered what it was when i turned it on
  and completely forgot it). Now it is working flawlessly and i am happy that i found
  out the solution. It might not be a lot but it gave me confidence.\r\nP.S. Be careful
  while you are messing with your software"

    think it's not the noobiness of the question that matters, it's how much effort
    you put into it before you ask for help. If it's something in the manual for example
    definitely don't pester people. But most of the good questions are not in the
    manual...\r\n\r\nIn fact a noob can't learn without asking noob questions. What,
    you're going to ask advanced questions right from the get-go?  :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    the Design board:\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/forum/5\r\n\r\nPeople dont look
    at the blog section for things like this. The Blog section is just that. A blog.\r\n\r\nI
    would re-post this question if you want any advice.\r\n\r\nAnd as far as asking
    questions go, you don\u2019t ger what you don\u2019t ask for ;)\r\n\r\n(I would
    also recommend using your real name as your screen name)\r\n"

    I am not very sure what the blog entries in this forum are meant for...
