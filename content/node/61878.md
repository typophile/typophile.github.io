body: I posted a version of this a long time ago, but recently I've re-investigated
  the letters. Any comments would help. I'd like some tips with picking out any spacing
  issues and weirdness in the capitals. Also, are there any fonts similar in vein
  to this one that I can look at for help in fine tuning?

  body: "Nice typeface.\r\n\r\nThe spine of the S is a little too straight.\r\nIt's
    a matter of personal taste but I find the e a little more extreme than the rest
    of the alphabet. I would love to see an \xE6.\r\nI love the b and d. The tail
    on the Q is very appropriate to the overall look and feel.\r\nLowercase t and
    i are a little thick on paper but the rest of the alphabet seems to have a consistent
    colour (maybe better trained eyes have a different say?).\r\nI'm not suggesting
    you add a terminal, but the branch of the r seems to fade away at text size (could
    be my printer though)\r\nCan we see a hook g? :P\r\nI just expect a serif on an
    n following that g.\r\nThe last five letters of the lowercase alphabet are far
    more mechanical than the rest. Of course in a text setting they are dispersed
    and blend in okay. It's just a coincidence that they form a band in the alphabet.\r\n\r\nAnyway
    I love the comma. Would love to see some more punctuation, oh and old style figures
    ;)"
