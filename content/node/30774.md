  you have here!  \r\n\r\nI want to report a number of things, not to complain - but
  to see if others are having the same problem and, if so, to bring it to the attention
  of the webmaster, etc. \r\n\r\nAm I the only one having the following problems?:\r\n\r\n1.
  \ frequently the server is very slow (minutes) in responding or times out or sends
  a general error message.  \r\n\r\nI suspect this is, in part, because there are
  a great number of people online at the same time - which is to be expected at such
  a wonderful forum!  And yet, I've spent time at many forums with similar numbers
  online at once, and very few server delays.  One thing that might help is email
  notification of thread updates to reduce the load??\r\n\r\n2. often when I'm trying
  to \"insert image\" there is an \"error.\"  Simply repeating the action is usually
  and eventually (but not always) successful.  I'm not sure why this is - anyone else
  having this problem?\r\n\r\nThanks & Cheers!  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n "

      \ Maybe the 1200 odd people are regular (though currently unregistered) posters
      checking in to see if posts have been updated?  I am a little surprised that
      there's no email notfication.  Having it might cut down on people checking in
      - although, come to think of it this might have nothing to do with server load.\r\n\r\n"

    who just read the forum. All 1200 of them posting would indeed not be a good thing.
    But if some of them would, some of the forum boards might get a bit more.. active."
