  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I am looking for font recommendations from this intriguing group of font mavens. 

Project: A 160-page manual/workbook on judging floral design.

Purpose of book: To provide a fresh look at a stale and entrenched judging process.
Primary audiences are two divergent groups:
•	Perhaps 40% of the audience is sophisticated, trendy and highly creative floral designers.
•	Perhaps 30% of the audience, though very creative, is fairly regimented and regards the current judging process as sacrosanct. As conservative as they are, they are always diligent and anxious to expand and grow, though change comes painfully slowly, and only after much deliberation.
Additional uses of book:
•	Manual for training new judges
•	Part of curriculum for students of floral design, primarily at the college level.

Style of the book:
•	Most likely it will be a clean, well-designed contemporary look, signaling a fresh approach to the serious topic of judging.
•	Possibly a traditional look.
My taste:
It generally runs from such classics as Centaur, Bembo, Goudy Old Style (or Fabiol), Scala, Vendetta Light, Requiem, PMN Caecilia, to Cholla Slab, Gotham and Quartet to…well, what are your thoughts?

What I’m looking for:
Suggestions for serif and sans serif fonts that complement each other. I would be appreciative of fonts for both a contemporary and traditional version of the book, and for possibly a script font. 
Open Type suggestions are particularly desirable.

Other suggestions or caveats?
Thanks for giving your time and expertise to my project.

Thanks for your reply.

I am aware that you design fonts and perhaps some of your fonts might be a good match.
I presume you have suggestions beyond your fonts as well. 

Thank you. I shall email you.

The reason why i don't post type proposals (my own) directly on Typophile any more is mainly because some users are getting offended by the fact that Me and other independent designers make self-promotion here. I therefor keep a lower profile as for now... now since the "Eartlink server" refuses to accept my e-mails and consider them as spam (quite funny though) I make an exeption for this time.

I do think some of my typefaces would fit for this book.

Headline suggestions could be:
(strict) STALEMATE: http://www.fountain.nu/catalogue/stalemate.asp
(liesure) SOPHISTO: http://www.psyops.com/html/spec_sophisto_ss.html
(wilder) OXTAIL: http://www.psyops.com/html/spec_oxtail.html

Body copy suggestions;
(classic) ANZIANO: http://www.fountain.nu/catalogue/anziano.asp
(classic/stylish) DELICATO: http://www.fountain.nu/catalogue/delicato.asp
(contemporary) OMMEGAAND: http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=CTT0000059
(classic) TAROCCO: http://www.psyops.com/html/spec_tarocco.html

Other typeface suggestions from other foundries;
Bello, Dolly and Auto, all from Underware: http://www.underware.nl/site2/index.php3?id1=fonts

Verlag, Chrnicle, Whitney, Archer, Gotham and Mercury, all from Hoefler & Frere Jones; http://www.typography.com/home/index.php

Various scripts could be found at Veer (http://www.veer.com)

Contact me further if you have more questions regarding my own typefaces?

Cheers</div>

I am appreciative of your taking the time to organize the font suggestions representing both your work and other foundries, complete with links. You have been generous with your suggestions. There is a lot diversity here.  

Now it's time to play with them.

Many thanks, Stefan.</div>
