  on this typeface (I've never finished one) and I could need some advice from more
  skilled eyes than mine. I don't have all the characters and havent done the kerning
  yet (because I suck at kerning).\r\n\r\nThanks for your constructive criticism.\r\n
  \r\n \r\n \r\n(EDIT) To boring? you can tell me that as well. Please talk to me
  :)\r\n\r\n(EDIT2) Do you need more information? This font is mainly inspired by
  the classic American Gothic fonts. I didn't really have a sertain goal in mind,
  I just combined elements I like (Though I heard thats the wrong way to do it)"

  body: "Welcome. But first things first and it will be harsh:\r\n\r\nAnother neutral
    text sans serif... \r\nGo to whatfontis.com and run the search. You'll get a ton
    of similar typefaces. Because even a decade ago there already was an over-saturation
    for such style.  \r\nThen ask yourself: what can help your font stand out from
    the sea of others? Is it design (not the case yet), language support, opentype
    features, ornaments. Maybe being free? But then again, browse fontsquirrel.com
    for a bit.\r\n\r\nThat was only one part. Here's the other:\r\nTo design a working
    text typeface, you need a lot of experience. To make it a stand-out takes even
    more. On top of that, they take the longest to finish. Plus, you'll need bold
    and italic styles too.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm trying to say is:  \r\nNo one can forbid
    you to do it, but you'll be spending a lot of your time on a project that will
    be lost between typefaces having more original designs done by more experienced
    professionals (I'm no professional myself ). It's too steep learning curve. On
    the other hand, there are too much geometrical \"circle + line\" typefaces too.\r\n\r\nBe
    original.\r\n\r\nP.S. Capitals are too narrow..."

  body: "Thanks a lot for your Replie, Minerva\r\n\r\nI know it's not original and
    I mainly did this one for myself. To learn the basics. Otherwise I waste original
    ideas to an unexpirienced technique :)\r\n\r\nBut I get what you are saing and
    you've given me a lot to think about.\r\n\r\nP.S. Yes, they are too narrow - thanks"

    a wrong view. You came here looking for experience in the first place.\r\nIf you
    have original idea, show it instead. Then both you and other people would have
    way more fun working. And the result would be meaningful too.\r\n"

    design is pretty good. \r\nThere are no nonsenses and I like your smooth /S s/.
    These aren't easy to do."
