body: "This letter fraudulently claims to be from 1998. Can anyone ID the font and
  date of the font's creation, etc.? The forger is using this letter to defraud people
  out of a house. If you want the whole letter, give me your email at mdswendsen@comcast.net
  \r\n\r\nIt's pretty distinctive. The ends of the bases go down, as does the bar
  on the 5.The middle of the bases go up.\r\n\r\nI've added a newer letter from the
  same writer, which is appears to be the same typeface."

  body: "The images are degraded (through faxing, duplication or scanning) so that
    it would be very difficult (maybe impossible) to tell which version it is from
    things like the serifs, which are virtually indistinguishable between Times (Linotype/Adobe)
    and Times New Roman (Monotype/Microsoft) anyway. However, the \"P\" in the word
    \"Please\" and the spacing in certain words (\"look\") suggest that this may be
    Times (Linotype/Adobe). \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/search/times+roman/fonts/?testdrive=src%3Dcustom%26text%3DPlease%2520look%26size%3D76%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3DFFFFFF%26w%3D600%26goodies%3Dot.liga%26dock%3Dfalse%26seed%3D26\">Comparison

    document was created just from the typeface. Both versions have been around as
    digital fonts since at least the eighties and the shapes of the letters have probably
    changed very little (if at all) since then."

  body: "I would be surprised if the metrics of either font has changed measurably
    over the years. People don't like it when their documents reflow, and Times and
    Times New Roman are among the most widespread fonts in existence (i.e., lots of
    users depending on them not to change).\r\n\r\nI agree with William about contacting
    Adobe or Linotype to see if any measurable changes have taken place."

  body: "Is a lawyer supposed to have written this letter? \"I sent you a letter request
    that you let us know what you plans are.\" The \"you\" instead of \"your\" might
    be a typo, but the \"request\" instead of \"requesting\" starts to look like less
    than the literacy I would expect from a lawyer. \r\n\r\nBy the way, forget what
    I said about kerning. Only spacing is relevant. This doesn't have ligatures or
    kerning, and so was probably composed in a Microsoft Word. "

    seems to be an undercurrent of sloppy English (how do you \"perform\" a condition?
    \"cleanup\" as a verb should be two words), but not sure that that gets us far
    except supporting William's doubt about the literacy expected from a lawyer...\r\n\r\n(FWIW,
    10pt TNR in a 5\" wide text block in Word, with double-word-space between sentences
    [ahem!] produces <em>exactly</em> this layout.)"
