  body: No, no, no, no, NO You got the ID first, I was just promoting Yves&#39; technique
    of ID, post, edit for linkage, sit back and bask in the glory. <BR> <BR>Anyway
    what&#39;s your excuse for lurking here at whatever hour of the morning it is
    where you are? I&#39;m supposed to be dealing with the household accounts at the
    moment, but I thought I&#39;d just pop in

  body: You are most gracious. I knew this was one I would have to be fast on, so
    I took the &#39;post now, link later&#39; method that I thought Yves espouses.
    I didn&#39;t realize the &#39;edit for linkage&#39; was part of the technique.
    How does he say &#39;cool&#39;?  &#34;Cyewl&#34;? <BR> <BR>I&#39;m on the West
    Coast of the US, and I&#39;m the early riser here &#40;I&#39;ve been up for 2-1/2
    hrs already&#41;. In 30 minutes my spouse will be up and our day together starts,
    as my computer time ends. Maybe some spot checks on e-mail, and stray open font
    ID questions, but I&#39;ll be MIA for most of the day. <BR> <BR>Where are you
    located?
