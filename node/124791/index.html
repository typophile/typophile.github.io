  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I have a very irregularly shaped, non-latin font, where I have to kern every letter pair. Let's say this font contains eleven letters. I have set the right margin of one letter – let's call it "A" – to 50 units. Then I kern that letter with the other ten letters, let's call them "B" to "K".

After kerning, I realize that of the ten letter pairs, eight ("B" to "I") have a kerning of -10 units, one ("J") has a kerning of +10, and one ("K") has no kerning (i.e. 0).

My font data now looks like this:

<pre>
    A 50
        B -10
        C -10
        D -10
        E -10
        F -10
        G -10
        H -10
        I -10
        J +10
</pre>

To simplify the kerning, I would like to change the right margin of letter "A" from 50 to 40 units (50 - 10 = 40), the kerning of the eight letters from -10 to 0 (-10 + 10 = 0), the kerning of "J" from 10 to 20 (10 + 10 = 20), and the kerning of "K" from 0 to 10 (0 + 10 = 10).

My font data should then look like this:

<pre>
    A 40
        J +20
        k +10
</pre>

which results in the same spaces between pairs as before (e.g. 50 - 10 = 40 - 0).

Now, instead of going through the font and changing the margin and kerning manually, which is time consuming and error prone, I would like to do this programmatically.

While I was thinking about writing a Python script that will read the kerning information from the font file into arrays and then loop through the arrays and calculate the new values, I am wondering if there is font software that allows this manipulation out of the box, or maybe there are scripts available online that do this manipulation, and I could save me a couple of hours of inventing the wheel a second time.

Do you know of such solutions?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I don't have an answer to your question, but in general reducing the number of kerning pairs by changing the left and/or right side bearings is not a good idea.

If your metrics are correct, don't change them. If they are not good, then correct them before starting with your kerning.

Also be aware in your example all other characters that are likely to pair with A should now include the additional 10 units as well, so:
A +10
L +10
M +10
etc

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you, erwindenissen. In my example the font does not contain any letters beyond "K", so there are no "L" or "M", but I get what you mean and will take care not to forget that.

As for "correct metrics", my font does not have regular letter shapes, so I cannot set, for example, the right side bearing to be the same for "n", "h" and "m". For better understanding, think of a symbol font where each glyph contains a unique form. Or hieroglyphs, where each glyph contains a different shape. I gave latin letters in my example only because you have them on your system, and I did not want to include images of my font.</div>
