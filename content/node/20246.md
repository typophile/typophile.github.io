body: "I have a slight problem with InBooklet SE on Indesign CS. I'm doing a small
  magazine of 32 pages, and when I try to use the plugin for compagination on a 2up
  saddle stitch booklet some text boxes move, apparently not all move the same distance.\r\n\r\nCould
  anyone help me with this?"

    based on creep settings?)\r\n\r\nAnd, are you creating a new, imposed version
    of the file, or just outputting an imposed copy (to printer or PDF)? I've found
    that the former sometimes tosses things around, but the latter seems to keep them
    in their place."

  body: "As I mentioned above, if, by \"move,\" you mean that objects (text boxes)
    shift slightly towards/away from the spine you might have the creep settings set
    oddly. If that's the case you'll notice the same shift in the PDF.\r\n\r\nI'm
    assuming, however, that you're familiar with creep settings and that this is not
    the issue.\r\n\r\nIf, when creating a new (imposed) file, your objects are jumping
    around significantly and text flow is getting screwed up, printing to PDF should
    fix that (at least that's been my experience.)"

  body: InBooklet for InDesign seems to have vanished - an update(3.05) was issued
    in Dec 05 and then its maker was aquired by Quark (also in Dec.) and now it has
    now disappeared. Interesting?

  body: That's disappointing news; although InD CS2 comes with InBooklet built in,
    I suppose this means ImposerPro for InDesign is gone as well and won't be further
    updated. Damn Quark.

  body: "Jason, I have creep set to 0, text boxes are randomly (not all of them) shifting
    position notticeably to the northeast. I tried to make a pdf but something is
    wrong with the Adobe PDF driver, it doesn't matter much now because the printer
    asked me the native unimposed file.\r\n\r\nI'll try to fix the bug and output
    pdfs, thanks for your help :)\r\n\r\nH\xE9ctor"
