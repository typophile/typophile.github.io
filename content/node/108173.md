  and would like some font recommendations.  I think I am happy with Oxygen Mono,
  which is a Google web font and is used in the tagline under the logo, the first
  header, the news headlines, and the copyright line.\r\n\r\nBut everything else probably
  needs to be changed, especially the logo font and the \"Why bitcoin\" paragraph
  in the middle of the page.  I'm also considering a different font inside the quotes
  widget itself.\r\n\r\nAny recommendations would be appreciated!\r\n"

  body: "Hi Hrant.  The purpose of the site is to promote the use of Bitcoin and serve
    as a one-stop hub for people interested in the Bitcoin currency.  Currently, it
    is centered around a simple widget that provides real-time price quotes, which
    is what most people are interested in anyway.  Over time, other widgets and information
    will be added, but the idea is to keep the design simple.  \r\n\r\nMost visitors
    are tech savvy and prefer minimalism over fancy design, but I still want to make
    the site look tasteful--something that has attention to detail but doesn't get
    in the users' way.  The idea for the \"plain\" look is probably inspired by reddit
    (which is where a lot of visitors come from) and, to a lesser extent, craigslist."
