  Greater Albion Typefounders, having made it into both \"Rising Stars\" on the Myfonts
  site, and \"Hot New Fonts\" on the New Myfonts sit *as an aside, interesting that

  on our [[http://gatf.wordpress.com | blog]].\r\n\r\nBonning is currently offered
  at a 40% discount on [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/gatf/bonning/overview.html |
  MyFonts.com]]. The family also includes bone fully licensed free face.\r\n\r\nHere's
  one 'taster' of Bonning:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/antique-rose-vase
