body: "Hello everybody!\r\n\r\nI'm doing a bit of research for my employer on the
  typographic zeitgeist. I'm both researching new typefaces and the use of type today.
  The project I'm working on is a magazine redesign, but my research is not necessarily
  limited to just that. I'm also looking more in a text typeface direction than at
  the most outspoken display typefaces around. So, I thought it would be worth the
  try to ask the dedicated people in here, what do you see as important tendencies
  in contemporary type design? And among all the new typefaces around, have you got
  a favourite?\r\n\r\nAll help appreciated!\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nEivind"

  body: "The most obvious current development in type design, although it's been going
    on for several years, is the creation of lots of new Humanist sans-serifs, many
    of them suitable for text. \r\n\r\nThe other big change is the development of
    text typefaces intended specifically for extended reading on-screen.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I think the zeitgeist is in fact the huge amount of brilliant, original,
    typographically complex, multi-script \"text\" typefaces recently published, in
    the second half of the previous decade. \r\n\r\nThe OpenType format has made this
    possible, as has the development of an international retail online font market,
    and the maturity of independent foundries (i.e. designer-owned, not legacy publishers
    or Big Silicon bundlers). \r\n\r\nThe Reading and KABK courses are cause/symptom,
    as is TypeCon and Typophile. All contemporary phenomena.\r\n"

    Guardian Serif, Milo Serif, Expo Serif, Stuart, Tisa, Calluna, Lyon Text."

  body: "Nick Shinn; when you say <em>multi-script</em> \"text\" typefaces, does that
    mean they are designed for different languages?\r\n\r\nFreiberger: Thank you for
    the suggestions! \r\n\r\nI find Publica pretty neat too. And Greta is also a favorite
    of mine, although not intended for Magazines."

  body: "Script \u2260 Language.\r\n\r\nExamples of common scripts are Latin (including
    a smattering of accented glyphs), Greek (which may or may not include pre-<em>katharevousa</em>
    accents), and Cyrillic.\r\n\r\nYou can usually set a number of languages with
    each script (Cherokee has its own, and I'm sure there are quite a few others).\r\nThe
    number of accented glyphs per script is the real touchstone for \"supports this
    or that language\".\r\n\r\nNick refers to fonts like Minion Pro (supports <em>every</em>
    Western European Latin script, as well as pretty much Eastern Europe languages
    -- but not pinyin Chinese transcription, because it lacks one of the accents;
    Cyrillic; and Modern and Old Greek), Myriad Pro (Latin, Cyrillic, Modern but not
    Old Greek), Adobe Garamond Pro (Latin, Modern Greek)."

  body: "No, I was specifically referring to designer-owned foundries producing multi-script,
    feature-rich fonts, not software/hardware generalists like Apple, Microsoft and
    Adobe, or legacy publishers like Monotype (although they do produce many new designs),
    who have been supporting multiple scripts since the beginning of digital.\r\n\r\nFor
    instance, my own Modern Suite. \r\nOthers too numerous to mention, several who
    post often to Typophile.\r\nRecently, many Greek and Cyrillic type designers have
    started publishing multi-script faces."
