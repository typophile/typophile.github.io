  is rounded, top and bottom, like R. D, F and L are not rounded on lhs. W is flipped
  M. C has terminals like S.  G has crossbar on inside and vertical spur. K arm and
  leg are straight lines that meet at lhs vertical stroke. Myfonts and identifont
  find a number of similars, but no match. Any ideas? Thanks.\r\nDon"
