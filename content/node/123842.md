  computer some months ago and can no longer find which font I used.\r\nI've tried
  identifont, whatthefont, Bowfin printworks wihout success. It's driving me crazy!\r\nWhat
  I love about this font is that not only does it seem \"human\", but it kind of fits
  in the spaces the way it should. It\xB4s just awesome.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/myfonts2_6124.png]"
