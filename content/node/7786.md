body: I have a very large multilingual font &#40;file size ~1 meg.&#41; that contains
  a great many composites.  I had always understood that using composites made for
  a smaller and possibly more efficient font.  I recently read in Leslie Carbaga&#39;s
  book on FontLab that &#34;some font formats&#34; don&#39;t deal well with composites.  He
  recommends making all composites into separate characters with their own outlines
  as the last stage in font production.  I have seen many quality fonts that make
  extensive use of composites for accented characters, and I have never had a problem
  with any of them or with my own font.  What is the best practice here? <BR> <BR>On
  the same topic, I have a few composites with outlines that overlap slightly &#40;cedilla
  and ogonek mainly&#41;.  I know that overlapping outlines are technically not good,
  but the Font Validator help file says that newer versions of the TT rasterizer handle
  such overlaps OK.  So again, what&#39;s the tradeoff here?  Keep the overlaps or
  make a bunch of separate and possibly unecessary characters? <BR> <BR>Thanks - David

  body: David,  <BR> <BR>For Type 1 and OpenType PS fonts, I&#39;d recommend decomposing
    composites. For OpenType TT/TrueType fonts, you can leave the composites in. For
    overlapping outlines, it&#39;s not only &#34;technically not good&#34;.  <BR>
    <BR>If a user applies some stroked contour to the letters or converts them into
    outlines, the overlap may become visible. Also, some laser printers and imagesetters
    don&#39;t deal with overlapping outlines very well. So I recommend always decomposing
    glyphs such as ccedilla or eogonek, and removing the overlaps.  <BR> <BR>Also,
    ogonek rarely works well from the design point of view if used as one and the
    same shape in all the glyphs. The connection of ogonek with e and U should be
    usually designed differently than the connection of ogonek with the other glyphs.

  body: I&#39;ll second what Adam has said about keeping composites for TrueType fonts,
    but decomposing for PS fonts. Note, however, that OpenType PS fonts can be generated
    using subroutinisation, which will automatically make the CFF table as efficient
    as possible, effectively replacing the composite format. This is an option in
    FontLab, which I believe is on by default.

  body: I&#39;ll also add that composites within a CFF flavored OpenType <BR>font
    will not show up when displayed through some database <BR>systems. For example,
    the font showings on myfonts.com.

  body: Thanks, gentlemen. <BR> <BR>I distribute my font only as TT &#40;now TT flavored
    OT&#41;, because Word can&#39;t handle T1 fonts with more than 256 glyphs.  This
    probably explains why I&#39;ve never heard of problems with the composites.  I
    will decompose the cedilla and ogonek composites, though.  And someday when I
    have stopped adding even more obscure characters I will go back and improve the
    design of the ogoneks. <BR> <BR>David

  body: Adam, <BR> <BR>Every version of Word that I have used under Windows &#40;up
    through XP; I have not yet tried 2003&#41; shows only 256 characters in the Insert/Symbol
    dialog &#40;ending with y-dieresis, the last character found in an old-style [non-Unicode]
    Windows font&#41; when a Type 1 font is being used.  I just did a quick test with
    Adobe Garamond Pro under Word XP, and this continues to be true.  I then tried
    typing some Unicode values followed by Alt-x, using characters that I knew existed
    in Garamond Pro.  Word first displayed a blank box and tried to change the font
    back to Times New Roman.  After manually resetting the font to Garamond and redoing
    the Alt-x I was able to get the characters to display.  So I should amend my statement
    to &#34;doesn&#39;t handle well at all&#34; rather than &#34;doesn&#39;t handle.&#34;  My
    recollection, which I now have no way of testing, is that earlier versions wouldn&#39;t
    take characters beyond y-diresis at all in a T1 font.  Of course Garamond Pro
    is an OT font which may have something to do with it.  But Insert/Symbol still
    needs to learn some new tricks, at the very least. <BR> <BR>David

  body: David,  <BR> <BR>what you describe is a bug in Word 2000 and XP. This was
    fixed in Word 2003, which is also otherwise much better than the previous versions.
    Not that I wouldn&#39;t agree that if you&#39;re making a font intended primarily
    for multilingual use, then the OpenType TT format is your best choice.  <BR> <BR>Regards,  <BR>Adam
