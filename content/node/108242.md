body: "Hi Typophile friends,\r\n\r\nI am currently refreshing the logo to be used
  on web, pretty much everywhere else. I feel that the weight of type might not match
  the icon. Currently using Futura bold with Museo slab 500.  Should i use two sans
  serif fonts or keep the two different styles currently?\r\n\r\nAlso, I was wondering
  for the web, if I went ahead with the two fonts above would you guys and gals use
  the same fonts for the web copy (one for headings, the other for paragraph)? Any
  tips??? Please critique away..\r\n\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/logoNEWlarge_6602.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks
  a ton!"

  body: "> Should i use two sans serif fonts\r\n\r\nDifferent weights or styles from
    the same family might be fine, but two entirely different sans serifs in the same
    logo could look weird. \r\n\r\nTo me, Futura's circular shapes goes well with
    the round icon, but using all lower case (which I usually like in a logo) may
    be a tad casual for a security firm. You might experiment with all caps or a cap
    \"I\".\r\n\r\n\"Home security\" will become very tiny if the logo is reproduced
    small."

  body: I think this is a very nice logo. I did not like the "e", "a" couple though.
    "e" looks thin and interrupts the flow.

  body: "Cuttlefish, what are you seeing in this icon? I probably can't unsee it once
    I do, but right now I'm not seeing anything other than a lock.\r\n\r\nI also agree
    the /e interrupts the flow. The lowercase /i possibly makes the logo too casual
    for a security firm, but perhaps the concept of the /i in the lock icon will be
    lost on you then. I guess you will have to try a few different things out.\r\n\r\nI
    can say however that it generally goes against my philosophy to use a typeface
    for a logo which is already in overuse. There are exceptions to this, but essentially
    a logo needs to be unique, and I don't think you do that by selecting the most
    popular/overused typefaces there are. The rounded shapes do match well with the
    icon though, so I would look for other sans serifs with the same kind of shapes.\r\n\r\nMaybe
    shorter ascenders will work nicely as well. It would make the type more compact
    so you have more vertical space to fill, which might fix the weight issue you're
    having (which is rather a color issue I think) and allows you to set the slogan
    at a bigger point size. I guess you shouldn't be afraid to use a bit more space
    horizontally as well, otherwise you will have to use a condensed type for the
    slogan, which is probably not smart."
