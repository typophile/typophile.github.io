  one used by the old New York Central railroad... I recently found a site where the
  font used for the headlines and nav buttons are spot-on.  I emailed the webmaster,
  but no response.  Can anyone tell me what it is?  The site:  <a href="http://fglk.railfan.net/"
  target="_blank">http://fglk.railfan.net/</a> <BR> <BR>Again - I&#39;m trying to
  ID the white sans font used on the site.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!!'
