  there are more ideas for fonts than time to always elaborate them to a whole family
  package. Usually, the ideas lay dormant in some hidden file for that reason, having
  little chance to see the light of the day. But sometimes I want to release the baby
  for I feel that it would be rather a pitty to \u2018keep it imprisoned\u2019. So
  I decided to [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/andreas-stotzner/lindau/|release Lindau
  now]], although it is such a \u201Clonely child\u201D. It may be of some usefulness,
  anyway.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/schild_Lindau_5_T_6523.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/schild_Lindau_4_T_6404.png]"

  body: I saw it on MyFonts last week and I was very impressed. I feel there aren't
    enough expressive typefaces like these. I genuinely hope you decide to expand
    Lindau to a proper type family at some point.
