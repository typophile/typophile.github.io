  existing chair wholesaling business. His new business will sell office, executive
  and designer chairs direct to architects and interior designers.\r\n\r\nThe business
  name is Chairs Only and the idea for the logo at the moment is a play on this seemingly
  uninspired name.\r\n\r\nThe client is onboard with the idea, but I know the design
  of the logo is far from good\u2014would love some input to help me develop it into
  something better,\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nDan\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typophile1_5372.jpg]"

    tends to carry negative emotional charge and unless it is applied to a negative
    subject (e.g. \"No to hate\"), there is typically a better branding option.\r\n\r\nAlso
    that looks more like a pool table to me :)\r\n"

  body: "@epsilicon\r\n\r\nThanks for the suggestion. I'm a bit of a chair nut, so
    it's a tempting option for me to use but it's one that I've so far deliberately
    avoided for a couple of reasons.\r\n\r\nThis business does sell a few of the usual
    suspects (barcelona chair, le corbousier chaise, eames rocker, jacobsen egg, coco
    nut, etc. etc.) but it isn't their primary market \u2014 they mostly distribute
    standard office and eames line of executive chairs \u2014 using geometry from
    the iconic designs listed would be somewhat misrepresenting the business (and
    the eames executive chairs have way to many lines to simplify into a logomark..)\r\n\r\nThe
    main reason though is the target market. Interior designers and Architects are
    saturated with images of barcelona chairs to the point that using them to promote
    a furniture business is beyond the point of clich\xE9. The motivation behind the
    designs proposed is to break with what this audience is expecting from a chair
    retailer and also opening up a platform for a visually distinct and expandable
    brand.\r\n\r\nThat said, I do acknowledge my solution is still far from perfect
    (as reflected by your concerns) and any suggestions like yours are very much appreciated.
    \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typophile3_5628.jpg]\r\n\r\nBased
    on the suggestions offered up by Lefty & Lex I've made a few changes to the design
    of the table and the cross. I've used the alternative to a cross like Lefty suggested,
    and cleaned up the angles of the table to better reflect this change. While there
    is always room for improvement I'm now starting to feel a bit more confident in
    the execution of this element. What do you think? \r\n\r\nSo far I've neglected
    typography and colour, so turning my attention to that soon. I have been using
    Gotham but I don't think that is really working as it doesn't reflect the lightheartedness
    of the graphic. Any ideas?\r\n\r\nMuch appreciated,\r\n\r\nDan"

    you will need to include and cross out everything that is not a chair in your
    logo, a lamp, a cat, a rocket etc. The name chairs only excludes everything but
    chairs - so focus on chairs\u2026\r\n\r\nBest"

    X works the best.  Let me quantify these:\r\n\r\nScribble is used typically when
    you sketch; ideas, concepts, roughs... anything unfinished.  This is probably
    not how the company wants to convey themselves.  It's not an idea they are neglecting,
    it's not a concept, or a sketch or an idea.  The name is a statement:  Chairs
    ONLY.  Period.  \"We don't do no stink'n tables... chairs only!\"\r\n\r\nThe single
    slash isn't working due to the quick nature of drawing a single slash.  For me,
    it's like a teacher checking math test problems or an individual slashing out
    various classified ads, its too quick of a thought and not a statement.  \"No,\"
    slash, \"No,\" slash, \"Wrong,\" slash, \"Wrong,\" slash...\r\n\r\nThe X is a
    statement.  \"Tables ARE wrong.  Beds ARE wrong.  Chairs only.\"  It's very intentional.
    \ Love it.  Go with Lex's suggestion and create multiple \"X'd object\" logos.
    \ You're starting to formulate their marketing strategy...\r\n\r\nThe pure typographic
    solution using the captial H as a chair is a fun solution as well.  Explore more!\r\n\r\nI
    disagree with epsilicon on the \"negative charge\" in the brand simply because
    as a consumer, I'd go to a place called Chairs Only to buy a chair.  I'm pretty
    sure they would know chairs better than some guy at Office Max.  As state above,

    side profile chair could work.\r\n\r\nI guess you need to look at the overall
    brand - what image are they trying to convey? The first is more humorous, playful
    and interactive, the second more elegant and sophisticated.\r\n\r\nA business
    card or letterhead is one thing but think about how it would live as part of a
    brand entity. If their imagery is all about style with sexy minimalist close-up
    product shots then i think the first idea will be more difficult to reconcile.
    \r\n\r\nOn another note, maybe the crossed out tables etc would work better as
    a secondary branding element - say a catalogue cover with a 5x5 grid of product
    shots, mostly chairs but with two or three shots of another item of furniture
    crossed out. That could be a theme carried across to other touch points too -
    website, tags, bags, etc. \r\n\r\nThe first idea has legs in terms of marketing.
    Just of the top of my head - some sort of direct mail snap card game, or sponsoring
    a ummmm...i dunno...office wine tasting event for corporate clients, but the imagery
    used could be a wine bottle silhouette along with a can of fizzy drink and a faucet
    crossed out. There loads of directions you could take it.\r\n\r\nJust some ideas

    about somehow drawing an image of several chairs situated around a table - but

    That way you will show the chairs, but convey the message that the table is missing
