body: "Okay, so I'm entering a side contest for a wine label re-branding, and I have
  a draft, but I really hate the typeface for the \"Yorkville Cellars/2008\" part.
  \ For the logo, the sumi-e style \"y\" had to remain part of the label; and the
  specific information listed on the label also had to be there.  The logo image provided
  is pretty low quality, so it can't be made much larger without looking grainy.  I
  just wanted to know mainly opinions/recommendations for spacing of the type, or
  maybe some different (free?) typefaces that I could perhaps use for the text on
  the label.  \r\n\r\nI'm thinking of maybe centering the \"Yorkville Cellars\" as
  well, even though it's kind of boring.  The image for the wine is supposed to be
  not corporate looking, but more of a country, organic feel, while still being minimalistic.
  I was trying to maybe find a serif font that isn't too rigid, but a little more
  playful? Please help. Thanks. :)\r\n\r\nDraft: [[http://i49.photobucket.com/albums/f254/strwbrrygshs88/newred.jpg|Yorkville

    for some reason. In short, please don't (I'm begging you) enter a design contest.
    Design contests are pure evil and devalue the design industry. It's essentially
    a way for companies to get designers to work for free. It's spec work. Don't do
    it! You'll be burned, badly. No respectable, professional graphic designer would
    do it because it compromises our ability to make a living. \r\n\r\nFrom (the currently
    crashed) [[http://www.no-spec.com|No-Spec.com]]:\r\n\r\n<em>Why Speculation Hurts\r\n\r\nBy
    Robert Wurth, Creative Director, Freshly Squeezed Design\r\n\r\nWhen your company
    seeks out a new logo design, advertisement, brochure, or any other marketing collateral,
    what you\u2019re really looking for is a solution to a problem. For example, you
    have just made a new product. Your problem is that no one knows about it, so you
    require a means to alert potential customers. You might conclude that an advertisement
    is the solution. In reality, the advertisement is merely the vehicle that delivers
    the solution, but the concept is similar enough.\r\n\r\nSome companies advocate
    the practice of gathering a number of different designers or agencies to pitch
    ideas for a project. The way it works is that the company calls up several different
    designers and says, \u201CWe need a new ad. Come up with an idea to show us and
    if we like it, we\u2019ll hire you.\u201D If the designer is lucky, the company
    will at least have a creative brief, a short document explaining the problem,
    to send.\r\n\r\nIn the design community, we refer to this practice as speculative
    work. It requires a designer to put forth work on behalf of the company without
    any promises or guarantees of getting paid.\r\n\r\nThis practice has become popular
    because many companies erroneously view it as a quick and easy way to get the
    best ideas from designers. Unfortunately, requesting speculative design is a poor
    business decision because it caters to the lowest common denominator of design.
    It also forces designers to engage in the poor design practice of making snap
    decisions.\r\n\r\nCurrently, one of the hot books in the world of business and
    marketing is \u201CBlink: The power of thinking without thinking\u201D by Malcolm
    Gladwell. In Blink, Gladwell advocates for the inherent quality of decisions that
    are made in an instant, citing that often these decisions are just as accurate
    (if not more accurate) than decisions made after careful, conscientious deliberation.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    within the book Gladwell also cautions that the process of snap decisions can
    backfire, sometimes drastically. The difference, he says, seems to be one of knowledge
    and experience. For example, you might come to me doubled over and complaining
    that your stomach hurts. I might make the wrong snap decision that it must have
    been something you ate and that you\u2019ll be fine. A doctor, on the other hand,
    might make the correct instant conclusion that you have appendicitis and then
    examine you more thoroughly.\r\n\r\nGladwell\u2019s explanation for this would
    be that the doctor\u2019s experience allows him to instantly take in all of the
    subtle clues about your condition, allowing his mind to make a correct conclusion
    based upon very little data. Of course he would order more tests to be sure, but
    that\u2019s not the point. Rather, the point is that I lack the experience and
    knowledge to give me a chance to make the same sort of correct diagnosis. I might
    have been able to guess right, but that would simply have been a matter of chance.
    Instead, my snap decision is based solely on my personal experiences \u2014 maybe
    I ate something bad once, and it gave me a severe stomach ache.\r\n\r\nThis is
    important because it relates directly to speculative work.\r\n\r\nInspiration
    never comes from just nowhere. It is the culmination of experiences stored subconsciously
    for the right moment to all click together. Speculative design work is an attempt
    to force inspiration without the benefit of experience. None of the designers
    are allowed the opportunity to get to know you and your business. They aren\u2019t
    allowed the time to examine your market and industry. They simply lack the necessary
    data too allow them to make good, informed decisions about your marketing.\r\n\r\nThe
    result is that the designers are forced to develop ideas based upon their own
    personal experiences and preconceptions about you and your company. Without any
    research, or discussions with you to guide them, their ideas become less about
    substance and more about style.\r\n\r\nIf the designers are talented, they will
    certainly be able to come up with appealing designs. It\u2019s even possible that
    one of them, through sheer chance, might hit upon a perfect solution to your problem,
    but that\u2019s a gamble. In fact, it\u2019s a gamble on two levels: first that
    at least one of the designers comes up with the right solution, and two, that
    you happen to choose that design.\r\n\r\nMany business owners tend to distrust
    designers. They will hop from designer to designer, never satisfied with the work
    and becoming more and more jaded to the process. Often this is a result of poorly
    executed ideas that come from the speculative process. The knee-jerk reaction
    is to blame the designers for not hitting the right message, without ever considering
    that their own process might be flawed.\r\n\r\nSo, going back to the beginning,
    you still need an ad. Having read all of this, you decide not to put out a call
    for pitches, but rather you decide to choose one designer or agency and work more
    closely with them.\r\n\r\nNow, the process is different. Before the designer ever
    gets to the idea stage, he or she comes in and talks with you to get to know you
    and your business. The designer is armed with materials you\u2019ve done in the
    past, information about who your customers are, about who the competition is,
    and what the industry is like.\r\n\r\nAs the designer absorbs more and more information
    about your company, preconceptions are replaced with meaningful knowledge. When
    inspiration strikes, it has context that is relevant to your business and your
    needs, and that makes for a better design that caters more to your needs, and
    less to the whims of the designer.</em>\r\n\r\nIf the website comes back up, I
    also suggest reading this article about [[http://www.no-spec.com/articles/design-contests/|Design

    that more and more companies want to work with designers it terms of a contests.
    I guess it\u2019s a side effect of a current financial crisis\u2014they simply
    want less for more. (I don\u2019t know what\u2019s the situation in the US, but
    in Eastern Europe it is like that... Sad.)\r\n\r\nNow, to not make it entirely
    off-topic...\r\n\r\nangechilada\r\nConcerning your design... The negative leading
    does not work well here. If you are going to enter the contest, go for something
    simple. As the typefaces go, it is actually pretty hard to find a good, reliable,
    classic serif font that is free. I can suggest trying out Microsoft\u2019s Georgia.
    It has oldstyle figures, so the 2008 part would look nice... Also the kerning
    in YO is way off (the letters should be closer to each other). You should also
    let the type breathe. Letterspace an uppercase a little (Yorkville Cellars especially)
    and maybe make the type a bit smaller to give it more space?"

- body: "Angechilada,\r\n\r\nIt has nothing to do with being a student. There are
    several ways to expand your portfolio and gain experience without undercutting
    the profession you want to join. If graphic designers continue to work for free
    through contest work, how will you ever earn a living after graduation? Think
    about how you'll feel when you can't find a job, but you're working 80 hours a
    week entering contests in the hope of getting paid.\r\n\r\nIf you want to gain
    experience and build a portfolio, work on your own identity. Do you have a personal
    logo? Business card? \r\n\r\nOr, find a non-profit charity and volunteer to do
    some pro-bono work for them. When I was in college, I did several projects for
    a women's shelter. \r\n\r\nYou can do work for a friend or relative. Do you know
    any musicians? Tell them you'd like to take a stab at making them a logo, poster,
    or album cover.\r\n\r\nThe projects I've suggested are far more valuable to your
    education than a contest could  ever be. Graphic design is MUCH more than making
    something look pretty. It's visual communication, and in order to craft the right
    message, you need to understand your client. A contest doesn't offer any relationship
    to the client, so any understanding is minimal. It's guess work! Good communication
    through design is NEVER guess work.\r\n\r\nAK "

    patients and low-income families. I have a good amount of creative freedom and
