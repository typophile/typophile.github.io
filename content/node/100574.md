  I need some typographers and designers to have a look and potentially participate
  in a free beta program. I would like to gain some insight into what would be interesting
  for you and what may or may not be useful. If you are interested please let me know
  by going to [[http://www.helpetica.com]] and you can sign up there. There will be
  limited spaces. '

    is a sign-up dialog. There's no indication of what might be involved, what background
    or experience you're looking for, what platforms the tester should have access
    to,  the possible scope of the effort, etc.\r\n  - Herb"

  body: "Agreed. I like to try out new type-related products and services, but before
    entering personal data, I would like to know who is behind it, what it is about
    and where it is headed.\r\n\r\nBTW: Have you cleared that name with Linotype?
    Helpetica set in Helvetica with just one letter changed from the most famous trademark
    in the type industry. That sound's like trouble. "
