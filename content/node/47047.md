body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI am hoping to put the proper fonts from soccer teams into my favourite
  video game.\r\n\r\nI've collected the numbers in the attached pic, it should have
  0-9 can anyone tell me what font it is, or even a close font. \r\n\r\nOn the blue
  and white pic, there are 2 fonts here, the WHITE-ON-BLUE is font one (sort of Italic,
  offset); the BLACK-ON-WHITE is font two (big rounded numbers). \r\n\r\nOn the red
  and white pic there is just one font, it seems strange because the characters are
  sort of cut (e.g. top of \u201C1\u201D).\r\n\r\nAny help would be great. \r\n\r\nThanks,
  \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/0a35fb39e6a73dd4ea5926542e4dd1e2_44410_5965.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/64ce4e191349dc2495841c7f20869f8c_27129_6091.jpg]"
