  to popular demand and our continuous effort to broaden language support, we have
  been working on a Cyrillic extension for our award-winning typeface [[http://www.type-together.com/Adelle|Adelle]].
  As its Latin sister, Adelle Cyrillic is intended for multi-purpose editorial use,
  providing robustness and personality. To guarantee consistency throughout the two
  scripts they also share proportions, colour and general features without stepping
  beyond typographic acceptance. Alexandra Korolkova was a great help in finding the
  right tone and fine-tune subtleties of shapes. All 14 styles will be available later
  in the summer.\r\n\r\nContact us for more information: [[http://www.type-together.com/info]]"
