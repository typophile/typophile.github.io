  on this blog has been the story of the engraving proofing presses.  Since that time
  they were completely dismantled, steam-cleaned and the individual parts and fittings
  sand blasted.  The parts were immediately \"oiled\" with silicone to prevent rusting
  in the extreme, south Louisiana humidity, the frame and screw handle with inertia-weight\u2014that
  looks like a dumbell with a big steel ball on each end\u2014were coated with a primer
  then painted.  It was so humid the primer wouldn't dry so we had to leave them up
  in Alexandria, LA, until dry.\r\n\r\nMy husband brought them home yesterday and\u2014with
  our 2-ton shop crane, dolly, ramps and brute force\u2014into the cool, humidity
  controlled studio where he is polishing the brass fittings.\r\n\r\nDaniela Marx,
  head of graphic design at Loyola University New Orleans, was here yesterday for
  an AIGA New Orleans board meeting and I treated her to a sneak peak at some of the
  spiffed-up parts (like the massive steel screw that attaches to the handle).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PressParts_5911.gif]\r\n\r\nAccording
  to \"Engraved Stationery Handbook\", Robert N.Steffens published by The Cronite
  Co., Inc., New York City, 1950, \"This type of press was developed years ago\" and
  \"is rarely used any longer.  It was designed to stamp the 1/2\" thick engraving
  dies we use creating social stationery.\r\n\r\nNote the name and how similar it
  is to Kelsey and Kelton, both manufactures I have seen for small letterpress presses.\r\n\r\nThe
  Cronite book is the only reference I have yet found to this type of press, if anyone
  knows more about them, please share."
