  body: An Interstate clone with more than eight weights? I guess you'll just have
    to draw one yourself. How hard can it be, after all? :-|

  body: There are other multi-weight faces based on the Highway Gothic design, or
    related, e.g. Expressway and Blue Highway (from Typodermic) and Clearview (from
    Terminal).

  body: Clearview is not all that similar to Highway Gothic, although it is certainly
    intended as a potential replacement for Highway Gothic.

    that they belong to the same genre of being designed speci\uFB01cally for highway
    signage.\r\n\r\nThere is also <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/transport/\">Transport</a>,
    but it only has two weights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
