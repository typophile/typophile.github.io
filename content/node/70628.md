  body: "I had hoped that the open 'e' would be a good clue, but it may be that the
    opening is a customization. It seems that the 'f' serif should be a good earmark,
    but I don't recognize it offhand.\r\n\r\nAre there any other letters?  If this
    is a logo, all bets are off.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I think you're right, O Lex-o-saur, although the 'r' doesn't look very close
    on any of those. The 'f' is definitely Goudy-esque. It would seem to me that this
    was 'inspired' by Goudy's lettering, but is probably custom work.\r\n\r\n- Mike
