  the complex, cursory parts of type design. One such part is the subject of revivals,
  do any of the more seasoned designers on here have any basic do's & don't's for
  revivals? How do you check if you're breaking the law by redrawing an old typeface
  from a specimen? Is there a minimum age before its in good-taste? What do you look
  for when finding a typeface to revive?\r\n\r\nAny answers are really appreciated,
  cheers.\r\n\r\nSeb"

    should, if that is what you want to do. You asked for opinions and Hrant gave
    you his.\r\n\r\nThe process of digitising an extant typeface will no doubt give
    you an appreciation for process, type history and a variety of other things, most
    (if not all) of which you could attain in creating something new.\r\n\r\nIf you
    are in doubt from a legal perspective then it is likely that you have not done
    sufficient research. If you have and there is still considerable doubt then you
    should look elsewhere. Then again, what you do on your computer is your business,
    it is only if you intend to advertise, share, license and/or sell the results
    of your work that you could land in trouble.\r\n\r\nYou would perhaps get more
    (and more specific) responses if you were to post about a proposed revival you
    are thinking of, tell people why you want to do it at all and then proceed (or
    not) from there."

  body: "@hello seb: In situations such as this, it is always best to ask lawyers
    for legal advice. While some Typophiles have encountered similar situations through
    out their professional careers, they may not necessarily be lawyers. Just as an
    accountant is not a physician.\r\n\r\nTo begin, <strong>I am not a lawyer</strong>.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>How
    do you check if you're breaking the law by redrawing an old typeface from a specimen?</blockquote>
    \r\nTo check if you are breaking the law, ask a lawyer. However, as a starting
    point, I would recommend contacting the current copyright holder of the typeface
    in question and getting their feedback. Again, they may not be lawyers either.
    Even if they tell you \u201Cno\u201D there may still be no legal precedent. Confirm
    this with a lawyer.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Is there a minimum age before its in good-taste?</blockquote>\r\nFirst
    you need to define \u201C<em>in good taste</em>.\u201D If you mean ethical, that\u2019s
    subjective. If you mean legal, I believe it varies from region to region.\r\n\r\nFor
    more detailed information, I would recommend contacting an established foundry
    and designer directly. For example, try speaking with <a href=\"http://www.fontbureau.com/people/MikeParker/\">Mike
    Parker</a> from <a href=\"http://www.fontbureau.com\">The Font Bureau Inc.</a>
    about <a href=\"http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/starling/\">Starling</a> (he\u2019s
    a great story teller, so you might want to set aside 30 minutes to listen to him
    if he is kind enough to give you his time). Be mindful, this person may not be
    a lawyer either. And what has happened in their context might not be the same
    as yours. Especially if you are in a different country.\r\n\r\nIssues of copyright,
    plagiarism, outline theft  &c have come up many times on Typophile, and if memory
    serves, many of them have little to no established legal precedent. Given this,
    they often spiral into debates about ethics. Which of course are entirely subjective
    (and very sensitive to some).\r\n\r\nThat said, given you are a student and (if)
    this is for educational purposes, you are most likely free from legal obligations
    provided you are not intending to profit from your work. One could start another
    <em>subjective</em> ethical debate on this as issue as well if they cared to.\r\n\r\nAgain,
    <strong>I am not a lawyer</strong>.\r\n\r\nMy best advice: Gather your materials,
    information, questions, &c. and <strong>ask a lawyer for legal advice</strong>
    \ (not a law student).\r\n\r\nIf, at the end of the day, you find no formal legal
    declaration, and it does in fact require you to make a subjective, ethical decision,
    the choice is yours.\r\n\r\nIf you do end up seeking legal council, please do
    share your results!"

  body: "I wouldn't dismiss revivals out of hand, since contemporary typography owes
    a great deal to them.  Many of the most admired and/or widely used types today
    are either revivals or reinterpretations... Garamond, Jannon, Bembo, Janson/Kis,
    Bodoni, Centaur, Caslon, Baskerville... the list goes on and on.\r\n\r\nIf you're
    doing it purely for your own education or enjoyment, and don't plan on releasing
    the results, I'd say do what you like.  OTOH, if you want to design something
    for release then, yeah, do some legal research.  Also, apply some common sense:
    don't 'revive' anything that's younger than the standard length of copyright in
    your part of the world.  I'd also say, don't release a 'revival' that simply duplicates
    something that's already available.  Your revival should be unique in some tangible
    way."

    Altsan's point of not just reviving but being almost guided by a font is very
    smart and it seems like this option has the best of both worlds, since it still
    requires research keeping me out of legal grey-areas. I will most probably move
    my project in this direction now.\r\n\r\nThank you all for your helpful hints

    aren\u2019t copyrighted, fonts however\u2014that is the digital medium through
    which typefaces are delivered, (the typeface in its digital form) are. This is
    why we have font revivals in the first place\u2014the visual aspect, the typeface,
    is not protected technically under copyright. In this fashion it\u2019s entirely
    legal for you to bust out an old Helvetica specimen sample, redrawn all the characters
    yourself, which undoubtedly will not be perfect replications anyway, name it \u201CSeb\u2019s
    Helvetica\u201D, render it/tweak it in your go-to font studio, thus creating an
    entirely new font (delivery system for the typeface) that is your own, and release
    it to the world. \r\n\r\nHere\u2019s a little quote from Ellen Lupton\u2019s <em>Thinking
    With Type</em>. \u201CIntellectual property law in the United States protects
    the font as a piece of software (a unique set of vector points), but it does not
    protect the visual design of a typeface.\u201D\r\n\r\nIt is extremely illegal
    however, to download an already digitized typeface (ie: Adobe Garamond) open it
    in your font program, tweak it in there, then release it\u2014for you are releasing
    the same font\u2014the same delivery framework for the typeface which is owned
    by Adobe and thus violating copyright. \r\n\r\nTo be on the safe side though,
    I would do as suggested and both stick to typefaces whose creators would no longer
    have any copyright due to time passage, and of course conduct further research/consult
    with an expert on law.  "

    is your dream to recreate the type, or to sell it? To put a point on it, if you
    can't fulfill the dream of selling it, does that mean you don't want to (re)create
    it at all?\r\n\r\nThe answer to that question will tell you what's most important

    Same as the piece of metal (if it's a metal font)? Same as the look of the ink
    on paper that the bit of metal made? A modern reinterpretation of either of these?\r\n\r\nSome
    work other than legal may be needed..."

    draw make the process clearer.\r\n\r\nMr. Ellertson \u2012 This isn't so much
    of a conundrum as much of a reminder that I need to more carefully choose my words.
    I guess what I am trying to say is that I wouldn't like to limit any work that
    I do, to purely scholastic, if at all possible.\r\n\r\nThe way is project is shaping
    up, it will not be close to a strict revival, as I have already made some changes
    to proportion, ascenders & descenders, weight etc. I redrew it from low-quality
    specimens and many glyphs have been altered. After some exercises comparing it
    with the original, the differences are noticeable (and not completely terrible!)\r\n\r\nSince
    I'm still very inexperienced in the field, I figure a project like this, where
    I study the skeleton of an existing typeface, and try to redesign to fit within
    the present context, is a smart idea. I have discussed it with some of my lecturers
    and they feel its a smart way to ease into the daunting world of type-design.
    So perhaps when I've finished the italics, the old-style figures, tabular lining,
    and the kerning, the work will be something of my own.\r\n\r\nThank you all for
    your advice, I really do appreciate it. I intend to put the process on here, when

    fact that both Kelly and Shaw leave out the work of G\xFCnter Gerhard Lange, Berthold\u2019s
    type director for several decades. I think that many typefaces that were revived
    under his supervision, such as Baskerville Book, Berthold Bodoni, Bodoni Old Face,
    Quadriga and Walbaum Buch are worth being noticed at least. Also the fact that
    the various Fleischmann revivals were left out by Kelly tells us that he rather
