body: "Is there a way to determine or control the height the accent is placed above
  Upper case glyphs using Create Glyphs. I have placed all my upper and lower case
  glyphs into FL and all the accents such as the circumflex, tilde and grave. If I
  then select an empty lowercase accent glyph such as aacute or agrave the glyph is
  created using a composite letter and correct accent, the height of the accent above
  the glyph is determined by the height of that accent in it's own window.\r\nIf I
  use the same process for the uppercase accent glyphs such as Adiereesis the accent
  seem to appear very high up above the glyph. Is a there a way to control the height
  of the accent when used with uppercase glyphs.\r\n\r\nRr\r\n "

  body: "Yes, you can have complete control over the position of automatically placed
    accents. See the \"Anchor Layer\" chapter in the FontLab manual.\r\n\r\nIf you
    do not want to go the anchor route, the default position of accents for caps is
    determined by the difference between the x-height and cap height. The position
    of the accent is offset vertically by the difference. For instance, if your cap
    height is 700 and your x-height is 500, the accents will be shifted up by 200
    when automatically generating accents for caps. So, by altering the cap height,
    you can control where the cap accents are automatically positioned. (Note: You
    don't have to alter it permanently when doing this. You can change it back after
    generating the accented glyphs.)"

  body: Maybe a list, saved alongside .enc and other files, could map user-specific
    glyph suffixes to FLS-internal tags (to identify glyphs as uppercase, lowercase,
    smallcap, numeral, etc)? So Generate Glyphs and other functions 'know' what's
    what.

  body: Thomas, maybe you know this already, but you can save lists of glyph compositions
    (built with your cap accent names) into a text file, and then load or paste them
    into the Generate Glyphs dialog.

  body: "Thomas, \r\n\r\nof course FontLab Studio \"knows\" which accents are for
    uppercase. \r\n\r\nFor example, if you\u2019re generating the glyph \"Aacute\",
    FontLab Studio takes the glyph \"A\" as the first composite. \r\n\r\nFor the second
    composite, it tries to use a glyph named \"acutecomb.case\" (if it is found, it
    will not be shifted up). If the glyph is not present, FontLab Studio checks for
    \"acute.case\" (and if found, it will not be shifted). \r\n\r\nIf that is not
    present, FontLab Studio checks for \"acutecomb\" and if found, it shift the component
    up by the difference of caps height and x-heights (as specified in Font Info).
    In absence of that glyph it does the same for \"acute\". \r\n\r\nIf you wish to
    use a different suffix for your uppercase component glyphs, make a copy of \"alias.dat\"
    in your user folder and in there, replace all \".case\" by \".c\" or \".uppercase\"
    or whatever your preferred suffix is.  \r\n\r\nAdam\r\n"

    variants through the \"case\" feature (hence the glyphname suffix). \r\n\r\nYou\u2019d
    most likely include OpenType Layout code in your font such as: \r\n\r\n<code>feature
    case {\r\n  sub macron by macron.case; \r\n  sub uni0304 by uni0304.case; \r\n}
    case; </code>\r\n\r\nIf your font includes only the spacing macron (named \"macron\"),
    I\u2019d call the glyph \"macron.case\". If your font also includes the combining
    macron (\"uni0304\"), then perhaps it would make sense to include a combining
    uppercase variant as well (\"uni0304.case\"). \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam\r\n"
