  from our client. \"fl\" had gone missing from the beginning of one of the words.
  When we turned the ligatures off and tried another PDF, it was fine. Any idea why
  this happened?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nNatalie"

    document in, and how did you generate the PDF?

    solution--turning off ligatures--works, so you probably oughta go with it..."

  body: "ID uses ligatures by default, but in the case of an old (presumably Type
    1) font, it has to rely on the font's character map to know whether or not there
    is any glyph in that position. If there is none, or if the font designer used
    that position to insert something else he thought would be useful (that would
    not be uncommon, given the limit on the total number of glyphs in a Type 1 font),
    you'll see nothing -- or a \"wrong\" glyph -- in InDesign, and in any PDF it generates.\r\n\r\nIn
    other words: is there actually something on screen if you use this font in InDesign?\r\n\r\n(I
    would suspect there is not; there may be dodgy fonts that <em>look</em> good in
    ID itself but don't export, but I haven't ever seen it happen.)\r\n\r\n[Ed.] Gah!
    And Nick's link tells me you cannot rely on your PDF viewer either!"

    have disappeared in subsequent versions."

    InDesign application folder in a special one called \"Fonts\". ID should be able
    to load it from there.\r\n\r\n(Ah -- CS5 ... it's been promised you can use \"Document
    fonts\" by copying them alongside the document, in the same folder, but word on
    the streets has that, of all things, Type 1s don't work. Can't help wondering
    why--)"

  body: "I used Utopia in many projects during the past 12 years, usually exporting
    final version from ID to a PDF. The /fi/ff/fl ligatures were always exported correctly
    both from Type1 and OpenType fonts.\r\n\r\nMaybe there is a problem with the PDF
    export settings or the Utopia files are corrupted.\r\n\r\nAnyway, you can disable
    ligatures in Utopia without visible flaws. The short terminal in /f/ makes /fi/fl/ff/
    ligatures very similar to the isolated characters."
