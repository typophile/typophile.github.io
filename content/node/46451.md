body: "Hello!\r\n\r\nI have been spending all day trying to get support for OT fonts
  on my Linux machine, and the best I have done so far is with XeLaTeX. I have, however,
  been having a few problems getting Igino Marini\xB4s Fell Types to work properly.
  I have control over all of the special OTF features, it\xB4s just that the spacing
  is really messed up and they come out much smaller than I specify. I have gotten
  a few other OTF faces to work fine, so I\xB4m not sure where the problem is. Can
  anybody point me to some assistance???  \r\n\r\nThe example below is as follows:\r\n\r\nDelicious
  at 10pt;\r\nLinux Libertine at 10pt;\r\nIM Fell Double Pica Pro at 80pt.\r\n\r\nThanks!!!\r\nGlen[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bildschirmfoto_6485.png]"

  body: "I don't know the reason. All I know is that if I change the em size of the
    otf font from 2048 to 1000 using Fontforge, the problem seems to disappear. Is
    the em size the very reason? I have no idea. Does the license allow changing it?
    I would say no. Is there a way to do the equivalent using low level variables
    in XeLaTeX without touching the font? I dont' know either and I don't think that's
    the way to go. The font seems to work well with InDesign but it would indeed be
    more fun with XeLaTeX because it is then easier to adjust the opticals to get
    them automatically.\r\n\r\n[added] In the texlive installation, the files XeTeX-notes.pdf
    and XeTeX-reference.pdf (that on my mac are in /usr/local/texlive/2007/texmf-dist/doc/xetex)
    and the file fontspec.pdf (in /usr/local/texlive/2007/texmf-dist/doc/xelatex/fontspec)
    contain useful information. "

    from page 164 of Lawson's book, <em>Anatomy of a Typeface</em>:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n\\documentclass{article}\r\n\\usepackage{fontspec}\r\n\r\n\\font\\flower=\"IM

    fonts seem to work just fine. However, if I use <code>xdvipdfmx</code> instead
    of <code>xdv2pdf</code> I still get a bad pdf output with fonts having an em-size
    of 2048 (and <code>xelatex</code> without the <code>-no-pdf</code> option uses
    <code>xdvipdfmx</code> to produce the pdf output). \r\n\r\nMichel"

  body: "Thank you, Michel. In the meantime I asked an italian TeX user that I knew
    for having used the Fell Types to investigate a little. He sent me a test pdf
    output telling me everything was working right. But when I looked at it, it was
    bad exactly the same way as another pdf I received. I asked him about this and
    sent him a screen save and he answered that it used Acrobat Reader 5 and the output
    was good and sent me, as a proof, a jpg. We both are on Windows XP. I use Acrobat
    reader 8 and the output is bad. I tried another pdf reader, Sumatra, an open source,
    and the output is good. So it seems the problem is in the chain pdf creator-pdf
    reader: somewhere the \"Postscript=1000 em size\" identity should have remained.\r\n\r\nIgino"

  body: "The Acrobat/PDF issues are a problem we've recently learned about with unusual
    (non-1000) upm sizes for Type 1 and OpenType CFF fonts and PDFs created with xdvipdfmx.\r\n\r\nIf
    the PDF is created using Acrobat, it works fine. If the PDF is created with xdvipdfmx,
    it will look incorrect on screen in Acrobat 8 and 9, and print incorrectly. Although
    it will look correct on screen in some older versions of Acrobat, it will still
    print incorrectly (at least to Adobe PostScript devices).\r\n\r\nI expect that
    the on-screen problem in XeLaTeX is related to the same issue of upm scale. That
    one is clearly a XeLaTeX bug.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"
