    It seems to be point and shoot quality. Otherwise, nice blog with lots of interesting
    architecture. I enjoyed it.\r\n\r\nSharon"

  body: Great job, rbarker. The layout is clean, open, and inviting. You were wise
    to use Georgia as your face too (works pretty well onscreen compared to other
    serif faces). All that said, though, the content is, appropriately enough, king!
    Very inspiring stuff.

  body: "Contemporary living, is that modernism?\r\nIf so, a bit apologetic -- like
    yes, modernism is still up-to-date, really, even after post-modernism.\r\nGo,
    modernity!\r\n\r\nThe content is almost all hard-surfaced, perpendicular and sharp
    cornered, yet all three typefaces used are at odds with that sentiment, and unrelated
    to one another:\r\n\r\nCocon: a sans softened by mannerist detail. The most contemporary
    thing about the site.\r\nGeorgia: a Scotch (19th century) design. Surely the other
    Microsoft default, Verdana, would have been more in sync. (Or the ultimate default,
    Helvetica/Arial.) \r\nThe serif tag-line, an old-style (antiqua) face. OK for
    Palladio...\r\n\r\nIf you're going for the classic mid-century, retro-modern vibe,
    something like the 1960s face Eurostile would capture the tone better:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/contempo_5848.jpg]\r\n\r\nWhy
    didn't you choose unusual types with plastic qualities and connotations that harmonize
    with those of your unusual subject matter?"
