    first face to be registered was Besley\u2019s Clarendon type in 1845. It has been
    argued that Besley\u2019s foundry was not the first to offer a typeface of this
    kind, but the act of naming the face and registering that name secured the grounds
    to defend its ownership. By the mid nineteenth century typeface names were acting
    as marketing tools and marks of property and effectively this remains the case.\r\n--

    href=\"http://www.linotype.com/187/hermanneidenbenz-designerfonts.html\">Hermann

    to give you this link about Freeman \"Jerry\" Craw, who created a famous version
    called <a href=\"http://www.tdc.org/events/2003crawtalk.html\">Craw Clarendon</a>.
    \ I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Craw several times at Type Directors Club
    meetings, so you know it can't be as old as the original Clarendon.\r\n\r\nI don't
    think you will find EVERY variation of the original Clarendon, but just know that
    the two above are very well known and accepted.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\nYes,

      research on the topic.\r\nOne year ago I started with my work concerning the
      Clarendon. I \"redesigned\" it for poster applications, which means that I drew
      it in FontLab using the \"Meisterbuch der Schrift\" by Jan Tschichold.\r\nNow
