  body: Whoops, it turned out to be okay when I reloaded the page after my post, I
    don&#39;t know why it didn&#39;t show up the first time.  I guess I was just anxious

    target="_blank">New Age</a> are closer but neither is an exact match.

  body: Yeah its the bases of the characters that really seem to be the key, as its
    moderately similar to many semi serif fonts besides that.
