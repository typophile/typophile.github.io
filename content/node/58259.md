  body: Okay, yesterday I was in Borders and I saw a magazine cover featuring a font
    similar to Glaser Stencil, but the stenciled lines through the letters were curved
    instead of straight. I tried to take a pic with my cell phone...it didn't come
    out too well but I'll try to upload it...anyone know what font it might be?
