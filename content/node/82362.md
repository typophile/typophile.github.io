  an imaginary seminary for one of my papers. \r\n\r\nI am looking for interesting
  Spatial Typographers as ideas for speakers, I have a few chosen but i would really
  like to find some tattoo artists that specialize in type, as i am looking into the
  personal aspect contrasting corporate identities.\r\n\r\nCan anyone help me out
  with some suggestions?  \r\n\r\nThanks! :)"
