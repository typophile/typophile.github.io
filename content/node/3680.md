body: HI, <BR> <BR>Apologies if this is a trivial matter, but it is giving me no end
  of headaches. I have Baskerville MT, bought many years ago. Worked beautifully with
  ATM on all computers, up to my latest addition -- an XP machine. I copy into the
  font folder, and it just refuses to use it &#34;font invalid&#34;, etc. I am rather
  dismayed that I cannot use what I bought any more. Any ideas much appreciated!

  body: Have you tried just putting it in the C:/ Windows/ Fonts folder, just to see
    if your OS will recognize it? Maybe it&#39;s a conflict within ATM.

    it may be a kind of copy protection by the friendly folks at Agfa... '

  body: There are two possibilities. <BR> <BR>1&#41; It&#39;s the case that newer
    versions of Windows are getting ever stricter about fonts adhering to the appropriate
    fonts specs &#40;whether it&#39;s Type 1, TrueType, or OpenType&#41;. The reason
    for it is stability/security concerns. <BR> <BR>As a result, some fonts that worked
    just fine before don&#39;t work correctly in XP. <BR> <BR>2&#41; It is possible
    to &#34;break&#34; the built-in Type 1 support in Windows. Most commonly by installing
    a really old Windows 9x/ME version on Windows 2000/XP. Have you ever installed
    ATM 4.0 &#40;not 4.1&#41; on your XP machine? <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T <BR>

    and it should work fine.

  body: Yes, if it&#39;s problem &#40;1&#41; and not problem &#40;2&#41; that would
    likely do the trick -- although it may be necessary to tweak some setting or another
    in the font. <BR> <BR>T

  body: Thanks folks, I will start looking for someone with Fontographer or Scanfont
    etc., and hope that will do the trick. not easy when you are an economics professor,
    and all your friends&#39; idea of fun is playing with MATHEMATICA. i don&#39;t
    think that prob &#40;2&#41; is key -- i never installed anything other than atm
    4.1 &#40;except a VERY old version of ATM from the days of win 95...&#41; <BR>
    <BR>best, <BR>j

  body: If you are saying that you installed a very old version of ATM on this XP
    computer, that is almost certainly your problem. We see this pretty often. <BR>
    <BR>Have you tried installing other Type 1 fonts? Do they install okay? <BR> <BR>If
    you are running ATM 4.1, you should upgrade to ATM 4.1.2 anyway. If you have broken
    Windows, this will also fix the problem. See my announcement and links on the
    Adobe User Forums &#34;http://www.adobeforums.com/cgi-bin/webx?13@29.qevKcXFfbAV.0@.ef9db1e/35&#34;
