  to know which were the option in exporting all data that are text-based\r\n- from
  a font (.fea .afm .flc are my first thoughts)\r\n- from FontLab itself (.reg .rc
  + shortcuts are my first thoughts)\r\n- and why not custom .enc .nam files which
  intricate FL and the font\u2026 \r\n\r\nI guess this might be easily solved with
  a bit of Python and would produce a feature partially close (in concept) to what
  TTX does, but I'm looking for a more specific tweak.\r\n\r\nFor a font, this would
  allow replication and backup of data throughout several files\r\nFor fontlab, this
  could allow quick and reliable configuration backup\r\n\r\nAny ideas? (yeah, \"buy
  a Python book\" is one of them already :)"

    the one named \"Python Tutorial\" is a very good way to get into Python quickly
    because it is quite \"just do it\" and does without formal definitions and rules."

  body: "Jean Baptiste, \r\n\r\nmost of what you ask is possible to do using Python
    scripting, but not through some simple calls of some one-line commands. For most
    of the filetypes you're asking for, one needs to actually write some code -- procedures
    that collect the data and aggregate them in some text form. \r\n\r\nAlso keep
    in mind that RoboFab stores a lot of font-related information in text files (XML-based
    UFO/Glif). \r\n\r\nThere are Python developers on this forum (including myself)
    who might be available for writing this kind of code for hire. \r\n\r\nAdam\r\n"

  body: "Uh typophile up again\u2026\r\nOk so:\r\n\r\nTim,\r\nThanks for the documents.
    I'll have a glance at it and see what it can do, but It's more a matter of time\u2026\r\nAdam,\r\nThanks
    for input and proposal. Trying, as long as time's not to short, to read & do,
    is the 1st option, then hiring a coder is a definite solution, though.\r\nThe
    reason I'm asking is because I'd like to be able to transpose not only a font
    but its own \"environment\" mainly for backup purpose but also for hot development.
    It's sometimes a real pain to pull out an old design and to regenerate it if your
    encodings, preferences and so on are for long gone or tuned..."
