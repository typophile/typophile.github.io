  body: "Hi David,\r\nmaybe not in Phil\u2019s book, but on <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/BauhausFaces1.html\">Mike\u2019s
    website</a>!\r\nAt least, it has an sample of the Letraset typeface Dempsey Medium.
    Apart from the weight, it seems to be a hit. I don\u2019t know if/where it is
    available in digital form, though.\r\nF\r\n"

    from the lowercase t.\r\n\r\nIf anybody has a specimen of anything other than
    Dempsey Medium, I'd love to see it.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nDavid"
