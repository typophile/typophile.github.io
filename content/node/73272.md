    Web, Myriad Web, Caflisch Script Web, Mezz Web, Penumbra Serif Web, Giddyup Web\u2026[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Minion_Web_4689.png]"

  body: based on what I have seen so far at the Typekit site, the hinting does not
    appear to be as good as in the Adobe Web fonts of old.

    Pro 14 & 24 point for example in any browser in Windows 7, x-heights are not aligned,
    lowercase z is a mess\r\n\r\nhttp://typekit.com/fonts/minion-pro\r\n"

  body: "We've noticed the alignment zone issue with Minion. (Nobody's perfect!) The
    beauty of web fonts is that fixes can propagated everywhere very quickly. We'll
    see what we can do...\r\n\r\nNote that the old \"Web Type\" fonts had the old
    basic Type 1 character set. These new fonts on Typekit are the \"Pro\" versions
    and support the same languages and scripts as their desktop counterparts."

  body: "thanks for the reply Christopher. I was curious as I had read on Webmonkey
    the following comments\r\n\r\n>>>Adobe is a little late to the party \u2014 the
    company is one of the last major font foundries to partner with Typekit \u2014
    but Typekit President and co-founder Bryan Mason tells Webmonkey that the reason
    for the delay is a heavy attention to detail. \r\n\r\n>>>\u201CAdobe has been
    working on the hinting and screen rendering of these (and others to follow) for
    months,\u201D says Mason, \u201C[that] means a character-by-character, weight-by-weight
    review of each font family.\u201D\r\n\r\nI have noticed a few of the other fonts
    that have problems with hinting, Myriad Pro Bold for instance at text sizes, has
    filed in counters on lowercase e, so I just wondered if these types of issues
    were going to be addressed. "

  body: "Well,I'm sure you'll enjoy the re fonts (and please don't give them the old
    1 eyed high sign just cause they look fantastic at 144dpi, really beat em), but
    this is in celebration of Adobes joining the web font flotilla, (who ray!).\r\n\r\nThe
    more people who try, the more who wonder \"why?\", and the more of the www c wg
    who try, the more who may understand, you can only take print fonts and formats
    so far into de endlessly complex chase of today's web, before you're kerfuked
    by some browser janitorial staff, or os that doesn't follow the ttf font spec,
    or some do gooding but clueless industry \"helper\" class.   \r\n\r\ncheers!"

    -- but those who are asking \"what took you so long?\" can probably begin to appreciate
    that, in striking a balance between visual perfection and actually shipping a
    product, things slip through the cracks. We appreciate any feedback anyone wants
    to provide here or elsewhere.\r\n\r\nI wrote: <cite> Still, some Typekit fonts
    (Myriad, Minion) share the language and script coverage of their full \"desktop\"

    something got lost. (TypeCon sleep deprivation setting in, obviously.) I think
    what I was trying to say is that some fonts that shipped in the old Web Type package
    now have <em>more</em> coverage than they did before (such as with Myriad and
    Minion's Greek and Cyrillic)."

    the same thing you told Duggan. Charming.\r\n\r\n@christopher slye\r\n\r\nOnce
    WOFF/EOT support is ubiquitous among the major browsers will Adobe be selling

    first batch were dead on. Nicely done, old chums!\r\n\r\nThat being said, I have
    seen both the current crop and some of the future RE fonts from Font Bureau, and
    they look FABulous. It's a crazy lot of work, but it's a great way to go if a
    handful of seriously tuned web fonts are your objective.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"
