  R1800 printer to use for comping things that I can\u2019t do on laser printers.
  Because nothing I do on this printer needs to last long I am thinking about using
  third-party inks to save money, but I don\u2019t want to buy the wrong ones and
  trash a $500 printer. Has anyone found a good ink brand for Epson printers that
  doesn\u2019t have to be purchased as a continuous inking system?"

    R300 and it was a total disaster, and I've heard of other similar horror stories.
    \ I buy my cartridges when I can spot 'em locally on sale, or as an alumna through
    my university's comp store, where it is almost half-price. (Now, if they'd only
    give an education discount for iPods....) :-)\r\n\r\nHave seen canvas prints off
    an R1800, and they were spectacular: when I upgrade to a large-format printer,
    it's high on my list."

    for keywords they're interested in :\r\n\r\ni never tried generic inks, but i've
    had nothing but disappointment with epson printers and am currently LOVING my
    canon i9900. it uses 8 colors, the ink cartriges are much cheaper than other brands,
    and it's fast.\r\n\r\nunfortunately, the newer model (canon pro9000), which i
    use at an outside office, is less desirable. in our rabid rush toward making every
    last machine seem \"smart\", they've added microchips to the ink cartridges in
    the pro9000. these chips aren't smart, they're stupid. they prevent one from using
    the printer when any of its diagnostic functions are alerted, and i've had false
    alerts that are impossible to override.\r\n\r\ni'm sticking with dumber (but strictly
    canon) cartridges. \r\n\r\n"

    This is really meant as a photographic printer. If I wanted to proof type I would

    the cartridges are separate now, I remember when they had 2 - black and CMY.\r\n\r\nYou

    You can print up to 13\" x 44\" if you want with the R1800. I believe the R1800

    Rolls can be a great money-saver because one doesn\u2019t end up wasting chunks
    of large sheets. \r\n\r\nWe have a few 4800s and a 7600 at school. The 4800s are
    fabulous, but the 7600 churns out some really awful colors on Epson paper. $5
    per giant roll crap paper from the local art shop works great tho. Regardless
    of model, big Epson printers are horrible for sheet-fed printing. My last office
    had three 24\" Epson printers; two were purchased because another one had stopped
    accepting sheets of paper at very inopportune moments. "

    pinter all the way through college, without much difficulty. True, the inks would
    clot on occasion, and the heads requited thorough cleaning every once in a while,
    resulting in a loss of about half of the ink from the cartridge before it became
    useful, but after that it'd always print like a charm, saving me hundreds of dollars
    that could I spend on new typefaces and Ramen noodles. A $12 pack lasted for a
    year and a half.\r\n_____________________________________________\r\nPersonal

    - and helped the rhinos! - but my newer Epson (not so new anymore, the 1270) won't
    take them. \r\n\r\nMy problem with Epsons is that if you don't use them regularly
    the heads are a mess and you have to replace the inks no matter how much is left
    in the cartridge. I don't use my machine on a daily or even weekly basis but when
    I do need to use it I want it to work without my having to overhaul it every time.
    I don't want to have to squander expensive toner and paper just to keep the thing
    \"lubricated\" every day.\r\n\r\nI had bought Power RIP software for the first
    Epson - total waste of money, the color was hideous. I'm told it's improved now.
    Don't have a RIP on the newer machine, but if I make everything CMYK the color
    is pretty good. I print straight from Quark, not from PDF. I'm not using it for
    proofing, just for comps tho. \r\n\r\nI don't have this problem with my lovely

    what used to happen to me. If you print from PS or Illy it will rip it for you.
    The problem is there is not a postcript interpreter in the inkjet so if you send
    it a job that requires it, you will get an error.\r\nI haven't tried this for
    quite a while, but I remember Quark jobs blowing up on me with an early Epson.\r\nAcrobat

  body: I can print using the non-postscript Epson rasterizer and it looks like ass,
    in a really bad way. No sharp edges on anything and the color is way off. The
    RIP just gets the postscript function to work, and usually allows for custom profiling
    associated with different resolutions and paper. I can't get the 1440 res on mine
    without it.

    Velvet Fine Art paper, I just downloaded a new one and have yet to try it. The
    Premium Lustre also needed a little tweaking but once you get it the results are
    outstanding.\r\nSo are you saying you can print from a layout program (Quark or
    InDesign) and it looks bad? Or are you printing from Acrobat?\r\nThe basic thing
    that is recommended is that you turn off color management in the printer and let
    the Adobe programs manage the color. I have had really good results using that.\r\nIt
    also solved a problem of mine at work where InDesign would change the black plate
    behind .psd transparencies. I turned off color management in the printer and it
    looks great now. There was absolutely no problem in the files. Basically things
    were being double color managed (since everything you send from an Adobe program
    is color managed no matter how hard you try and turn it off) and that led to problems.\r\n\r\npbc"
