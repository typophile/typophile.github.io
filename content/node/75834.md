body: "I sometimes need GlyphOrderAndAliasDB files for the AFDKO in the same order
  as the index in FontLab. But I am not competent in Python scripting (although I
  have coded this script today). If you want to optimize the code, you are welcome.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nNow
  I have added a script, that generates a nam file. This is useful for example, if
  you want to have the same Unicode points in different fonts, that are partly in
  the PUA. (The script does not generate Unicode points, but it reads the Unicode
  points of an encoded font.)\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n<strong>Updated on 09.11.10.</strong>
  Save <strong><a href=\"http://typophile.com/files/Macros[Arno Enslin 09.11.10].zip_.txt\">me
  <a></strong> (context menu) as zip file."

  body: 'You only have to add "#FLM: Build GlyphOrderAndAliasDB" or another title
    beginning with "#FLM: " to the top of the code, if you want to store it in your
    macro folder.'

  body: "I have added a few more versions. And forget my previous message, because
    the files include titles now. \"py_.txt\" has to be replaced by \".py\", because
    \"py\" is not an extension, that is allowed as attachement here.\r\n\r\nAnd here
    you can find info about the tkfile dialog: http://tkinter.unpythonic.net/wiki/tkFileDialog"

  body: Thanks, Arno! I needed to do this recently, but I used search and replace
    in a text editor to do it. Looks like using this script will make it much simpler
    the next time.

    am an absolute beginner. It would be better to compare the length of the strings
    instead of comparing numbers or to compare hex numbers instead of decimal numbers."

  body: "I am still working on the scripts. <strong>Two questions:</strong>\r\n\r\nAfter
    the dialog, where you want to save the file, has closed, the focus is not anymore
    on FontLab. You first have to click on the title bar of FontLab or on another
    point in FontLab. The user may be unsure then and click on another font window
    than the window of the active font. How can I give the focus to FontLab again
    in the end of the script?\r\n\r\nAnd in the script the root directory is indicated
    by a slash (initialdir=\"/\"). Does this also work on the Mac? Probably not. So
    I had to check first, if you are on Mac on PC and set a variable for the root
    directory. But which character(s) indicate the root directory?"

  body: I have cleaned up the code and fixed a few bugs. Now it also works, if more
    than one font is opened. You have to change the file type to zip. Just put the
    content of the zip (the two folders) into your macro folder. I assume, they work
    on Mac and PC now, although I could test them on PC only.
