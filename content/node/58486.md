body: "Hi! I'm designing a logo and I decided to use House Gothic 23 Text. But I'm
  with problem because I think there's only the following versions: House Gothic 23
  Text Light, House Gothic 23 Text Italic and House Gothic 23 Text Bold. And I really
  wanted a \"Regular\" or \"Medium\" version.\r\nWhat do you suggest me to do? I don't
  think filling the outline is the best option. Do I need to customize it? Or is there
  an easier way?\r\nSorry my broken english. Thank you in advance."

  body: "Well I chose this font because it goes well with the icon I designed. Both
    font and the icon are square-ish and semi round.\r\nI'm using caps and I tried
    now a tricky thing, to open even more the kerning of the Bold version and resize
    it smaller so it will look lighter. I'm going to print and see if it works.\r\nAny
    alternatives to House Gothic 23? It has to be very similar. Thanks."

  body: Well it doesn't work that way. :\ I really need a Regular version. I don't
    understand why wasn't released one. Or am I seeing things?

  body: "Is there a reason you used Text and not Display?  Because Display has forms
    similar to text if you use the alternates. For example a more traditional 'S'.\r\n\r\nBTW
    lets see the logo as it is."
