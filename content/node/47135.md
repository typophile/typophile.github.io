body: "I've recently taken on a fairly big brand job and inherited a logotype which
  utilizes Baker Signet with the addition of some slight changes. I'm looking to streamline
  this logo and presented Fedra Sans along with some of the existing nuances. Still
  client response was \"too far out.\" I'm hoping someone may have a suggestion of
  a typeface that embodies some of Baker's qualities but be a bit more contemporary
  if you will. A foundation for me to move this logotype forward. I appreciate any
  input.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nJ.C."

    a bit more \"fresh\". I must also use it in ALL CAPS. I don't work much with these
    type of faces and wonder if anyone is doing anything new in this area.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again,\r\nJC"

    whose work is readily identifiable and individualistic. The word idiosyncratic
    comes to mind.It is borne out of his personality, the tools he uses and his studies.
    \r\n\r\nIf you are looking for something with his \"trademark style\" you've only
    to search the myriad faces he has designed over the decades. Look at Hiroshige(Sans)
    as a possible alternative or just google his typefaces. Most are calligraphic
    but there are others to choose from.\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: "Thank you kindly for the typeface recommendations Florian. - The most difficult
    part of this assignment is that the foundation I must start from is beautiful
    (Baker no doubt) the challenge is the face itself for a very recognizable brand
    is just too recognizable and maybe a bit over used to date. Feedback is, \"it's
    nice but I feel like I've seen a million times, seems like my mom's brand type
    logo.\" Not my words but the overall impression from a focus group. However much
    I respect the beauty of the typeface, I must find something \"familiar\" but that
    can relate to a younger market and a more savvy user following that is looking
    for something just a bit more freshened up, or should I say current. This isn't
    easy as nothings seems to be better looking than Baker in my Glyph search and
    when I move to a Sans, it's too far off. Arrrg...\r\n"
