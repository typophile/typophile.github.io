  comprehensive revival of Rudolf Koch's classic Wilhelm Klingspor Schrift.\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/WKSchrift_4029.png]\r\nThe
  font adds a lot of features to existing revivals (notably Adobe/Linotype Wilhelm
  Klingspor Gotisch), including the full sets of basic characters, narrow capitals,
  alternates, ligatures and ornaments originally designed by Rudolf Koch.\r\n\r\nI
  would be extremely grateful to hear your invaluable opinions before releasing the
  font. You can download a high-res specimen sheet [[http://www.alterlittera.com/al_image/Spec1.gif|here]].\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for your help.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/al_logo_4715.png]"

    too thin for the text sizes. I fear they are even too thin for the 14 point size.
    Apart from that the type looks really fine."

  body: "J\xFCrgen,\r\n\r\nThanks for reading and commenting. I wanted the hairlines
    to be really thin, so they provide a hard contrast at display sizes while, at
    the same time, are almost unnoticeable at text sizes. I didn't want to make just
    another standard revival in several respects, so I expected the thin hairlines
    would contribute to set this revival apart from those of, say, Adobe and Linotype.
    Anyway, the topic doesn't seem to have generated too much enthusiasm ... Nonetheless,
    I have updated the specimen sheet linked to on the first post. Incidentally, the
    gif file now seems to be properly loadable within IE.\r\n\r\nThanks again.\r\n"

  body: "Almost done! Lots of additions and refinements since the previous post, including
    a careful revision of each and every glyph. The font is finally an (almost) exact
    reproduction of the Klingspor original (with many convenient additions for modern
    OpenType use), providing vast improvements over the current Adobe/Linotype and
    other not-so-popular renditions.\r\nUpdated information and samples available
    at [[http://www.alterlittera.com/al_htm/oldtype/wklingspor_schrift.htm|alterlittera.com]].\r\nThanks
    in advance."
