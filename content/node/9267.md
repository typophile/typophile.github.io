    ID in one post seems &#39;cruel &amp; unusual&#39;.  They are not even numbered.
    Please don&#39;t post this way again Nathan. You will make matters much easier
    for us with old computers with small screens. <BR> <BR>Have we identified them
    all? I would have to take notes, just to figure out which ones are still questions.
    It shouldn&#39;t be this much work. Sorry.

    crazy scanning all in one nite, and just threw them up on here, not really thinking
    about organizing. Alas, I numbered them at first, but my html coding didn&#39;t
    work..

  body: 'I say &#39;Good job, Matthew!&#39;  Picking out a text font with that screen
    resolution and letter size is NOT easy. <BR> <BR>I have been hunting every where
    for #2, but have really had no luck getting very close. I got excited when I saw
    Tourist by Julian Bittiner in the ATypI &#39;Language Culture Type&#39; book,
    because the upper case seemed very close, but the lower case was all wrong.  <BR>
    <BR>The only other missing one now is #9, and it&#39;s a good sample &#40;although
    almost no upper case letters&#41;, but very few distinctive &#39;earmarks&#39;.
    For me the f, r, g and y have been the letters I&#39;m looking at hardest, but
    I haven&#39;t had the pupil-dilating feeling that comes with &#39;That&#39;s it!&#39;
    <BR> <BR>Still hunting.  <BR> <BR>Yves, what do you think about splitting these
    two remaining unidentified fonts into their own threads? The scroll to the top
    each time is becoming tedious &#40;sound of whining&#41;. <BR> <BR><i>I tried
