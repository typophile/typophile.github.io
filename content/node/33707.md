  body: From what I know, QXP6 doesn't understand any OT features or Unicode. But
    it does "accept" fonts in OT format. So, for Mac, you have to make sure to generate
    fonts using a Mac codepage, (and Win for Win,) and for all kerning to be exported
    as a kern table, not a kern feature.

    it feels to me like Quark 6 occupied the same developmental stage as Photoshop
    7 and Illustrator 11. It's a transitional application. Many Quark 6 users are
    still primarily using PostScript fonts because they are inherently conservative.
    This isn't necessarily a bad decision, since they are able to recover the substantial
    costs they've sunk into their type libraries. I agree with Village; use PostScript
    with Quark 6 and consider OpenType with InDesign or Quark 7. "

    - what of the investments users have made in Postscript Type 1 fonts if they won't

    tried all possibilities now, but cant get an OT font work in QuarkXpress 6.5 without
    the \xE5 ending up being an \"Cacute\" and the \xC5 ending up being \"Amacron\".
    And Ive seen this on other fonts aswell, which I didnt generate.\r\nIt works fine
    in Quark 7 and everywhere else, but not in 6.5. OK, I know that 6.5 isnt supporting
    OT fonts fully, but still \u2013 a lot of OT-fonts with a \"pro\" character set
    indeed does work in Quark 6.5, so it kind of gives me an itch to try to solve
    this.\r\n\r\nWell, actually I CAN get it work if it is not an OT-Pro font, with
    only the standard glyphs as they were for example in FOG \u2013 Standard Mac OS
    Roman(?) but if I have all the Latin Extended glyphs in the font, it seems impossible.\r\n\r\nDoes
    anyone have patiance to try to help? (help for dummies..)\r\nJust to be clear
    with what you all mean, with the encoding-stuff: Do you mean that when I encode
    I should Stand in the CODEPAGES mode, and there choose for example the MacOS Roman
    encoding and then generate the font? Doeas this mean that I have used this encoding?
    Or should I do something else also? Maybe I dont get it...?\r\nPlease have mercy
    on me :)\r\n\r\nPS: Darn.. I just want to use my dear FontLab and be able to make
    it work. I think it\u2019s rather funny that the most difficult part of producing
    fonts, is not the design, not the spacing, not the kerning, not the OT-code-writing
    etc \u2013 but generating the final font??! Its like you have a hundred of different
    choices to choose and click on, just to generate the font.\r\nWhy cant this just
    be as generating a PDF? :)\r\n"

    of any... yet ;^)\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that, AFAIK, Quark 6.x only supports one
    codepage at a time. So, in a 'Pro' OpenType CFF (.otf) font with a large character
    set, only a subset of that will work correctly. This means you won't be able to
    get Western and CE characters working correctly at the same time; you can only
    have one or the other.\r\n\r\nHave you ever wondered why some foundries make different
    versions of the same font? (e.g. [[FontFont]]'s Maiola Pro, Maiola OT, Maiola
    CE, Maiola Cyrillic) One of the reasons is to circumvent the problem that some
    applications treat OpenType CFF fonts as if they were basic Type 1 fonts (where
    you can only encode 256 glyphs)."

    that the Western subset of your Pro font will work in Quark 6.x (on a Mac; AFAIK
    the PC version will not trigger the OS/ATM bug). The same font will also work
    on Quark 7.x, Adobe apps, etc. My point is, just because Quark 6.x only \"sees\"
    a subset of your fonts, it doesn't mean that you need to trim-down all your fonts
    to that subset; there are more software applications on the planet ;^)\r\n\r\nWhat
    you should do is to advise your clients that when using your Pro fonts with Quark
    6.x, only the Western set of characters will be handled properly, because Quark
    6.x is not [[Unicode]] savvy. If they require CE (for example) characters in the
    same job, then they should upgrade to Quark 7.x. Alternatively, you could (in
    the same way as FontFont does) provide fonts that are effectively subsets of the
    Pro font, to your clients still on Quark 6.x.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do not recommend
    the second option. Why? Because, let's imagine you make a font that contains only
    the CE glyphs. When using such font in Quark 6.x, although you  get the intended
    glyphs (i.e. you get the correct ink on the page), in Unicode-speaking the underlying
    character is incorrect, because the codepoint inserted (when you type a key on
    the keyboard) does not correspond to the glyph you're seeing. This has the side
    effect that the text will not be correctly encoded, so if you try to use a Unicode-savvy
    font with it, you'll get gibberish glyphs in place of CE characters.\r\n\r\nPut
    in a simplistic way: Think of codepages as if the two first Unicode blocks (Basic
    Latin and Latin-1 Supplement, the first 256 codepoints) were repurposed over and
    over to display different glyphs."
