    Guides and Baseline Grids' (File > Print Presets > Define > Edit > General)\r\n\r\n

  body: If you're not printing separations, you want to choose "Print Visible Guides
    and Baseline Grids" from General when you bring up the Print dialog box.  Assuming
    you pick two blank pages, that's all you'll get.
