  contained 2 fonts I wish to identify or at least find similar ones.\r\n\r\nThe fonts
  I'm looking for are\r\n- the one from the logo : Triumph \r\n- and the one in which
  the sentence \"L'armature qui se fait oublier\" is written. \r\n\r\nThanks for helping
  me out !\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Triumph-2_4947.jpg]"

    LL)\r\n'L'armature qui se fait oublier': can't find a match but probably custom
    and exclusive for Triumph; [edit]: got a name and confirming hunch, bespoke typeface
    called 'Triumph Tailoress Script'; reminds me of [[http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Hubert_Jocham_Type/|Hubert
    Jocham]]'s like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hubertjocham/susa|Susa]] and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hubertjocham/madita|Madita]];"

  body: "_Triumph_, also bespoke, is difficult to replace with a substitute. It seems
    to be based on the traditional 18th and 19th centuries English script but with
    a reduced inclination. \r\nFor example Bo Berndal's Carl Beck [img:sites/default/files/old-images/CarlBeckInUse_5416.jpg]
    \r\nhttp://www.fonts.com/font/monotype/carl-beck/regular?SiteId=15\r\nAnother
    script that attempted this is Aldo Novarese's Juliet, which has been digitized
    by  Rebecca Alaccari and Patrick Griffin as Ambassador Script [img:sites/default/files/old-images/AmbassadorScriptInUse_3698.gif]

    website: [img:sites/default/files/old-images/TriumphTailoressScriptInUse_6666.jpg]
    Perhaps the additional letters will assist in finding a closer substitute.\r\nNone
    of the suggestions so far really catch the flavor of this script.\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "Feather Script is an unusual combination of an classic structured lowercase
    similar to Englische Schreibschrift with casual swooping capitals.  Feather Script
    seems to give some hint as to how letters other than the _T_ in _Triumph_ could
    work with the _Triumph_ lowercase.\r\nAs for the second script -- Triumph Tailoress
    Script -- it's a far from casual design.  I made a somewhat similar _f_ from scratch.
    [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Recreated_t__6046.jpg]\r\nThe exercise was
    surprisingly time consuming. Wish I could find a similar design as elegant and
    structured in an an existing font that is available to the public.\r\nDon"
