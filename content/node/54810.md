  body: Section "G ltfloat.dtx" of the LaTeX2e source description file (look for source2e.pdf
    on CTAN) hat a subsection "Footnotes" that describes the LaTeX footnote commands.
    It's actually not easy to define what is the basic \footnote command in LaTeX
    as the \footnote command itself calls a number of macros that use global as well
    as local settings.
