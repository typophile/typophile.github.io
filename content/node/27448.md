body: So when I was studying in college, I once had some art director who was a special
  guest to my class get mad at me because I used dumb quotes (or a dumb apostrophe;
  whatever it's called) in my design. From then on I'm always careful to try to make
  the right choice. Anyways, I'm doing a design for the community college and they
  use Futura Bold Condensed on a lot of their publications, so I thought I would use
  it as well, but the apostrophe is not curly. Would this be a safe decision?

    Be sure to check that they\u2019re slanted and thicker in one end than the other."

  body: That's what I was thinking. It looks like a prime, and is not quite straight
    up and down like a dumb, so I just wanted to get a second opinion.
