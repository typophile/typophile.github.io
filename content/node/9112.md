  i am working. So far not many things.  <BR>I started with the logo i am sending
  and for  <BR>the moment i&#39;d like to have some comments  <BR>on the C-O &#34;ligature&#34;
  &#40;espessialy about the  <BR>weight of the diagonal&#41; and the kerning.  <BR>That&#39;s
  why i didn&#39;t post it on the &#34;Logos&#34;  <BR>forum after all. I promise
  as soon as i will  <BR>have a worthy collection of rough-logos i will  <BR>ask for
  logo-critique in the right forum. <BR> <BR>christos <BR> <BR><!--attachment: colibri-64809.swf*attachment_icon.gif*application/x-shockwave-flash*5.7*colibri*colibri%2eswf

  body: first or rather second one seems to have a logic distace between characters
    when comparing with &#34;co&#34;. 3 &amp; 4 make it more fuzzy.

  body: I agree with JP - I only see LIBRI. Try curving the bottom of the O loop upward,
    or cutting it off at a different angle. <BR> <BR> - Lex

  body: Sorry Daniel  <BR> <BR>I sent swf because you would be able to zoom in and
    see the curve detail  <BR>&#40;i need to have a crit on the weight balance also&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>So, there you are... <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/65028.jpg"

  body: My view is that the problem is with the top left of the <BR>counter of O,
    the outside curve works well, but as it  <BR>stands I read a script lowercase
    s. The dot in the O <BR>makes it more like a logo mark for Libri, and next to
    your <BR>ligature I find the open counter on the R unattractive. <BR>Tim

  body: Hello again  <BR> <BR>The project doesn&#39;t move too fast as you see. <BR>We
    abadoned the first idea and i started  <BR>designing a &#34;font&#34; for the
    logo.  <BR> <BR>I had great problems with C and i am not sure  <BR>if i solved
    them.  <BR> <BR>The pseudofraktur is a quick modification  <BR>of the original
    letters...i think my colleagues  <BR>won&#39;t like them, but i am a kind of obssesed  <BR>with
    the gothic types, so i had to give a try. <BR> <BR>I am looking forward for comments...

  body: I think the new concept is much better. the old C/O ligature was too cryptic.
    With the new design I think that the sharp one is best. It stil needs work. I
    am think there is too much variance in the C/o/b &#40;C being the ligthest&#41;

  body: Hi Ole <BR> <BR>thank you for the input, but i am really  <BR>stuck here.
    Do you suggest a way that there could  <BR>be more harmony between C/o/b? <BR>
    <BR>The form i&#39;d like to keep is b. For the C and o  <BR>am not sure. <BR>
    <BR>If you wish i could sent you the file to make  <BR>your proposals. <BR> <BR>Here
    are some more efforts... <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/66048.gif"

  body: Hi Christos. send me some vector files to work with and I will show you what
    I think would work. For now consider some of the monor negative space issues.
    Center of &#34;o&#34; vs. &#34;b&#34; . The &#34;b has a bit more negative space,
    and it is open, so the form looks even larger. <BR>I primarely use Freehand MX.
