body: "I know this is a long shot but I'm trying to identify the fonts used in these
  Old bicycle decals so I can re-create them. The bike dates from 1988-1989\r\n\r\nThe
  fonts I'm trying to identify are those used in the words RANDONNEE, BRITISH and
  EAGLE\r\n\r\nI have also attached pictures of a different bike using the same fonts
  with decals that are more complete\r\n\r\nGrateful for any help"
