  sets for more supported languages. In some cases I'm subtly revising a handful of
  characters and doing a general overview and update through this process, but nothing
  drastic.\r\n\r\nHow does one discern between 'Version' updates and 'Revision' updates.\r\n\r\nIt
  would seem what I'm doing would fall under a 'Revision', so I was wondering what
  the general consensus is that constitutes a 'Version' update?\r\n\r\nThanks for
  your feedback."

  body: "The name table version string should always be updated whenever you <em>release</em>
    a new version of a font, no matter how small the changes. The only time I do not
    increase the version string number is if I am working on internal, pre-release
    builds (in which case I use a private build number in the version string, e.g.
    'Version 1.01 Build 012').\r\n\r\nThe head table version string should be kept
    in synch with the name table version string.\r\n\r\nThe head table revision string
    isn't something I generally assign any significance. I certainly would rely on
    it to distinguish different release builds of a font."

  body: "The current trend on releasing the same old font with extended char-set and
    some other minor tweaks is to call them \"xxxxxxxxx Pro\" and sell it for a few
    more bucks.\r\nOr add \"XXXXX Next Pro\" if you prefer the more flamboyant Linotype
    Way.\r\n\r\n"
