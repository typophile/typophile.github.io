  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I was wondering if anyone would know of any typesetting courses that exist via correspondence? I live in New Zealand and would love to study about typesetting but can’t find any courses that cover this subject specifically. I’ve been working as a book designer for the past 3 years but would love to hone my skills. Any ideas?</p>
<p>Thanks &hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m not sure what you are asking. Do you mean something like the mechanics of getting an author&rsquo;s files into a typesetting program (i.e. &ldquo;How to get Word into InDesign&rdquo;), or something like the aesthetics of typesetting (e.g., What&rsquo;s the difference between a compositor and a typesetter)?</p>
<p>If the former, I&rsquo;m sure there are a lot of correspondence courses on the market. The latter is entirely different. I don&rsquo;t even know of any good books on the subject, though Dowdings <cite>Finer points in the spacing and arrangement of type</cite> at least shows things people sometimes consider part of the <em>practice</em> of typography, which includes setting type. (I&rsquo;m showing my bias here; Dowding covers &ldquo;good&rdquo; typography as seen through a 1940s British lens.)</p>
<p>Viewed one way, design and composition are on a continuum; the compositor just deals with smaller details. But in other ways they are quite different. For example, in setting justified copy, the typesetter is always seeking to make the best of several compromises; usually the designer isn&rsquo;t thinking in terms of compromise at all.</p>
<p>If you can be a bit more specific, maybe we can offer some advice.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Definitely the latter. Perhaps put another way I would like to learn the &lsquo;art&rsquo; of being a good typesetter. There is nothing worse than a beautiful book being let down by poor typesetting, second only to spelling mistakes in my opinion!</p>
<p>Thank you for your book recommendation, unfortunately it seems to be out of print.  Any other suggestions would be very welcome.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>As for Dowdings book, the Wace edition is long out of print, and sells used for around $150 U.S. I&rsquo;m surprised the Hartley &amp; Marks edition is out of print. But since Dowding supervised the Wace edition (&amp; would have held his nose at the Hartley &amp; Marks rendering), perhaps it is just as well.</p>
<p>There are any number of books which cover setting type, usually as a part of design, such as Mitchell &amp; Wightman&rsquo;s <cite>Book Typography</cite>, but even these I&rsquo;d regard as &ldquo;manuals.&rdquo; Put it this way: in the design category, there are books which prescribe what (the author thinks) is good design, then there are books that help you think about good design. Rich Hendel&rsquo;s <cite>On Book Design</cite> is one of the latter. I don&rsquo;t know any books dealing with composition that parallel <cite>On Book Design.</cite></p>
<p>Going far out on a limb, I think the biggest element in the composition of book text is getting the word spacing right. When setting a new book, I go through tests establishing the min-ideal-max word spacing with a particular design AND A PARTICULAR TEXT. If I&rsquo;ve used the font before, this is usually done quickly. And just like a designer, if I haven&rsquo;t used the font before, I&rsquo;m probably not going to get it just right anyway &ndash; but I still try; it takes an hour or more.</p>
<p>Other spacing compromises will be forced on you by the publisher&rsquo;s house style. If, for example, they don&rsquo;t allow a hyphen after two letters, (e.g., be-cause is ruled out) the evenness of the word spacing will suffer. The same with prohibiting the last word of a paragraph from being hyphenated. Or &ldquo;no hyphens overleaf.&rdquo; All of these have been considered &ldquo;good&rdquo; composition rules, but the person who specifies them seems to forget that the comp cannot rewrite the copy; all he or she can do is follow them at the expense of even word spacing.</p>
<p>My favorite book for reflecting on both design &amp; composition is Blumenthal&rsquo;s <cite>The Art of the Printed Book, 1455-1955</cite>, because it covers several centuries, several countries, and a host of styles as fashion changed. But I have the Godine edition, I&rsquo;d be a bit suspicious of the Oak Knoll edition (<a href="http://www.oakknoll.com/detail.php?d_booknr=3276&amp;d_currency=">http://www.oakknoll.com/detail.php?d_booknr=3276&amp;d_currency=</a>) <cite>An Atlas of Typeforms</cite> is another good source for examining how type looked across the centuries. What is considered good or fashionable in 2008 may be a bit different, but the issues we all struggle with have not changed.</p>
<p>Put it this way: good composition is, in its way, as much a craft as good design. As with design, there are no recipes to guarantee success.</p>
