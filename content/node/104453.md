  by the Monty Python folks.\r\n\r\nAnd how I could get this desired effect when designing?\r\n\r\nI
  have a feeling it was likely hand drawn, but I might be able to get some tips?!\r\n\r\nThanks

  body: "The base font is could be any of many Gothic sans serif designs. Here is
    one by Filmotype that was used in movies: <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/filmotype/glenlake/\">Glenlake</a>
    as digitized by Mark Simonson.\r\nLife of Brian was made in 1979. IIRC the cracked
    monumental lettering dates from then. If so, almost certainly made by a graphic
    artist working without computer programs. As for the 3d effect this can be done
    direct on a font using a program such as Fontlab. To find out how to get the desired
    cracking effect using a computer, I suggest you consult any good book on Photoshop
    techniques or a few web searches for tutorials on textures etc. \r\nGood luck.\r\nDon"
