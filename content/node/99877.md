  ugly. For example: in PT Serif (headings) + Source Sans Pro (body text) combination
  uppercase \"J\"s just \"can't stand eachother\"). I intend to use it at home and

  Both printed and on-screen \"performance\" is important. Fonts with SIL Open Font

    there goes <em>my</em> suggestion: commission a custom serif version of Source.
    \ :->\r\n\r\nBut here's a good lead from Paul's Typblography article*: \"I was
    drawn to the forms of the American Type Founders\u2019 gothics designed by Morris
    Fuller Benton.\" Like see if somebody has made a serif version of News Gothic.
    BTW that sort of thing is FontBureau's neck of the woods.\r\n\r\n* http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2012/08/source-sans-pro.html\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    FB (included in MS Office) is \"compatible\" with Benton Sans (first on the list).
    Both Benton Sans and Source Sans Pro are based on News Gothic + some claim Source

    the version I use is an expanded TrueType derivative called <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/evristika/\">Heuristica</a>,
