body: "I've been working on my upright cursive sans, and have gotten some good feedback
  on my [[http://typophile.com/node/50618|post on the Critique board]]. \r\n\r\nThis
  weekend I played around with FontLab's Interpolate tool and was struck by what some
  horizontal thickening using it did to my font. Before:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/unthickened_5167.gif]\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/thickened_6235.gif]\r\n\r\n(This
  is rather unevenly applied - just a test to see what would happen.) I was struck
  by the appearance of the widened letters - rather handsome to my eyes. The dramatically
  increased contrast works well with the cursive-like loops and bumps, I think. \r\n\r\nI'd
  like to pursue this further. One thing to ponder is whether this would make a suitable
  bold to the original, spaghettilike font, or if the differing \"pen theories\" (brought
  up in the Critique thread) would hinder their compatibility. \r\n\r\nThe other question
  is what to do with the caps - in the original they already are different in character
  from the lowercase. It remains an open question whether that will fly, but the introduction
  of contrast I think will exaggerate the caps/lc distinction to a point where the
  mismatch is really bothersome. I suppose I should try to work out some possibilities
  of caps that share some of the \"cursivity\" of the lowercase letters."
