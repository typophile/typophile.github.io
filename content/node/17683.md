  suspicion it might have been!), I googled and searched Typophile but couldn't find
  it mentioned. Anyway...\r\n\r\nQuestion: Can anyone recommend a really nice rich
  black out of CMYK? I know there are no hard and fast rules about this, so I thought
  that maybe someone out there has hit on a formula they could recommend.\r\n\r\nThanks
  very much!\r\n\r\nSi"

    a warm or cold black & what paper you are going to print to. \r\n\r\nPaper has
    color that affects the result & differing absorbancy too. \r\n\r\nAnd there are
    varnishes. \r\n\r\nDifferenet pressmen will give different results ( really! )
    and different presses will too. \r\n\r\nThat said there may be formulas out there
    that certain people like...\r\n\r\nIt might be more useful to find a black *you*
    like & try to trace how it was made. If you do that 4 or 5 times you might begin
    to see some common traits - plus you will be relying on your own eyes rather than
    someone else's.  \r\n\r\nAlso, keep in mind that there are different Pantone blacks
    out there than can be used apart from Standard 'K' plus the hexachrome model exists
    too. \r\n\r\nIt is a very complicated thing you are asking about!"

    \"rich black\"?\r\n\r\nAs to AN answer to your question (if you locate the other
    thread, you'll see that there wasn't much agreement) is that 40% Cyan + 100% Black
    works very nicely AND doesn't put too much ink on the paper. Other people have
    their own opinions; if any of them actually WORK IN A PRINT SHOP (which I do)
    and TALK TO PRESSMEN ON A DAILY BASIS (which I also do), then listen to what they
    have to say as well, and make up your own mind."

    of mixture behind it. If you look at the CMYK sliders in Photoshop you can see
    the undercoating to the left of the black slider. I recently did an ad with a
    black background and a really large blue logo. I normally like cold black but
    in this case it was eating up the logo so I mixed up a warm black. It helped a
    lot. The best advice here is talk to your printer. They will know what works for
    them\u2026\r\npeace"

    if you use too many tints to make it rich."

    a URL strapline in 8pt white text on it... and nothing else, so there's a large
    amount of flat colour on it - I just didn't want to be disappointed with it printing
    out like a Quark black.\r\n\r\nThanks for all your suggestions!\r\n\r\nSi"

  body: Off topic a little, but something always interesting, is adding a fluorescent
    booster to your CMYK, making it five instead of four color process. Typically
    this will take the form of a bright orange or violet, at about a 40% screen. Jobs
    that need to have very bright, vibrant blues, yellows, and greens can often gain
    a significant amount of color saturation by this addition. In contrast, brighter
    colors are not always easy to obtain with CMYK, but if your client absolutely
    has to have that green, or that red, and it is outside the normal CMYK gamut,
    suggest the addition of the fifth color (fluorescent booster).

  body: "Somewhere along the line, I heard to stay below 250 total coverage... Thus
    the C70M50Y30K100 formulation. If 240 makes a difference, I'd recommend C70M45Y25K100.\r\n\r\nThe
    Y doesn't really add darkness, it just helps to neutralize the hue.\r\n\r\nThe
    suggestion of adding a thin stroke of K around (and behind) the reversed text
    to allow for misregistration is very sound advice. My company publishes DVDs -
    the faces of which are silkscreened - and this technique has allowed us to print
    very small text sizes even with this notoriously temperamental printing method.\r\n\r\nI

  body: If it's a billboard job then it's being printing on an inkjet, not an offset.  And
    because it's an inkjet, it's going through its own cmyk conversion during the
    output, and only laying down as much ink as dictated by the machine and paper
    necessary to get a black-black.  I'm sure they told you 100:100:100:100 to ensure
    the printer would put down the blackest black it could.
