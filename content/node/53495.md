  type to Cicero's text, or do some of you prefer your own custom passages?\r\n\r\nI've
  recently started moving away from lipsum to personal copy.\r\n\r\nThe advantage,
  is that the paragraphs look and break in a more natural way (for English).\r\n\r\nI
  am however concerned that clients might concentrate too much on reading the copy,
  which could color their judgment, and detract from the aesthetic/conceptual considerations."

  body: "Oh, and here's the dummy I am currently using (only with select clients,
    and at smaller point sizes for now)\r\n\r\nIt seems that the time has come to
    create the new dummy text, devoid of any semblance of meaning, whole and utterly
    unremarkable compilation of dreary nonsense. Cicero's work can only get you so
    far, as the structure of Latin is rather different, not to mention, that certain
    letters of the alphabet are omitted all-together. So there you are, plowing through
    the textura, as stale and boring as most of Milton's poetry, rife with omissions,
    plagued by horrid grammar, with no horizon in sight.\r\n\r\nContrary to popular
    belief, writing a thoroughly nonsensical copy is a serious challenge, quite comparable
    to other creative endeavors. A self-referential dummy is even more straining,
    as the subject gets exhausted quite quickly, leaving you short of synonymous words,
    or seemly metaphors. There is also a vague fear that some poor demented soul could
    actually read this dribble, risking their fragile, precious brains exploding into
    a centillion glittering pieces.\r\n\r\nLuckily, in our advanced industrious age
    of infographics and condensed bullet lists, the likelihood of this tragedy is
    rather low. Still, I have to warn you, if you are one of the unfortunates tricked
    into reading this far, you must stop this silliness at once! Go outside, bask
    in the sun, make a flow-chart, compose an impromptu toast, hold an important staff
    meeting, pass out the crab-flavored coffee biscuits, but for the love of all that
    is good and wholesome, don't even think about reading this to the very end, least
    you suffer the fate far worse then gradual decomposition (a proper, judicially
    approved and well-recommended manner of passing) and end up a dried-up, prunish
    sort of being that even Heidegger would not find the time for.\r\n\r\nIf you've
    read thus far, you might be be wondering why none of those horrible things have
    actually happened. Let me assure you that they have, but the sheer horror and
    impossibility of them was such, that the reality has split in twine, leaving the
    original one all crumpled up and laying by a dumpster, while the current copy
    goes on all primmed and pampered, moving through unbeing with a joyful (though
    metaphorical) spring in her steps and apples in her (allegorical) cheeks. Incidentally,
    among other adjustments, the text above has also changed irrevocably so as to
    prevent anyone from destroying the world. So, once gain, we have a new dummy text,
    devoid of any semblance of meaning, whole and utterly unremarkable compilation....(Ad

    that post-WWII fine art criticism is rife with long essays that amount to nothing
    more than doggerel, so now I use that to greek up pages.\r\n\r\nAlthough given

    language, and figures.\r\n\r\nSomething I use to do is to copy paste everyday
    the first News on top from Google News.\r\nLikehow, i have almost everything i
    want.\r\n\r\nLong Text.\r\nFigures & Ponctuation.\r\nAlso sometimes Small Caps.\r\n\r\nThe
    great thing with this \"ipsum\" generator, is that you also copy paste some Date
    information. Then when you print your design research, you automatically have
    a kind of Date Mark.\r\n\r\nThis is very useful for me.\r\n\r\nMerci !"
