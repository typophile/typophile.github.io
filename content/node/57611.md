  body: "Looks great! I have some notes for you:\r\n\r\n- The image is too wide for
    my screen resolution, hopefully the website itself won't have this fixed weight.\r\n-
    The \xA9 in your footer is missing.\r\n- I personally dislike Arial, but it may
    look better with just ClearType.\r\n- You could add some effects to the blue headers.
    Gradients, patterns and/or shadow under the logo.\r\n\r\nGood luck :)\r\n\r\nKind
    regards,\r\nMartijn van Berkel"

    of the blue band didn't line up with the bottom of the tabs, unless you wanted
    to make the active tab merge into the main page."
