		<div class="commentbody">I agree with Patty. It doesn't look like anything familiar to me, and letters like that W seem like you would recall them. It's more likely that it was done completely by hand than that someone 'played' with a font. <BR> <BR>If you have some calligraphic skill, you might make your own W, b and g, which seems like the most atypical letters in this sample. However, I presume your purpose is not to re-create this, but to identify the typeface to use for other purposes. <BR> <BR>One that I know with at least a somewhat similar W is P22's <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sherwood/p22-roanoke-script/p22-roanoke-script/testdrive.html?s=Williamsburg&amp;p=60" target="_blank">Roanoke Script</a>, and it even tries to reflect a style roughly from the Colonial era (or earlier).  <BR> <BR>You could look in Part 10 of the <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script10Pg1.html" target="_blank">Script Font ID Guide</a> for other Antique Handwriting fonts. Not sure what qualities you are looking for, but at least I know these are actually fonts.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I have a much larger sample in print with me, but I posted the smaller graphic link because it was already online.  And you're right, I need the font for a commercial to use with other text than &quot;Williamsburg&quot;.  I'm still convinced it's a font with looking at the exactness of tips (between the tops of the s and r), the i's and l's being identical to each other (though I suppose there's something to be said for copy and paste :p)  No less, I appreciate your input and suggestions!  The Roanoke font is a mix of the font I was looking for and a different one inside the brochure, so may be more perfect than finding the fonts I was trying to.  Thanks so much <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>PS - please pardon the bit of artifacting - was a quick mask cutout that I did to see if Identifont or the like could identify it <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/66295.jpg" alt="Williamsburg Scripty Font"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">There are a few other earmarks indicating this is custom lettering and not a font: <BR> <BR>- The wide looping descender on the g (which would not work in a font after another character with a descender). <BR> <BR>- A similar case with the b. Both sides would collide with other tall characters. <BR> <BR>- The b and u connect differently than other pairs. <BR> <BR>- The W would be very awkward with short words or words that start with Wh (e.g., Why).</div>

The Williamsburg above is a digital rendering of the Original &quot;Colonial Williamsburg&quot; not Historic&hellip; I was given the original logo and extrapolated the font from the two words. The letters in W'burg are digitized as they were and there are no problems with letter fit or leading as was suggested. It is a proprietary font for in house use only.</div>
