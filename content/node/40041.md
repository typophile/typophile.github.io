body: Is there any reason when creating an OpenType font to convert OpenType [kern]
  feature to "plain" kerning data? Is this only an option to be used when converting
  OpenType fonts to standard Postscript or TrueType fonts. Would the kerning data
  if converted to "plain" still work in the final exported OpenType font if the OT
  kern feature was removed?

    the Metrics window under kerning, as well as when I use the Preview window with
    Open Type Features\u2026 the only time it doesnt show up kerned correctly as a
    pair is in the standard 'Preview' window.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know why this might
    happen. I've double checked for exceptions and there are none\u2026 as well as
    I've double checked that the particular character isn't repeated in any other
    classes\u2026 strange\u2026 if anyone has experienced this or has had this problem
    let me know.\r\n\r\nThanks"

    have a platform independent fontfile with kerning recognized by non OT apps.\r\nAs
    far as I know the plain kerning works after removing the kern feature. But do
    a bit of testing to be sure."

    some options, many of which depend on your situation and hopes for the font. Also
    under Preferences > Generating OpenType & True Type > Kerning, be sure to uncheck
    \"Generate OpenType Kern feature etc.\" and check \"Export old-style non-OpenType
    etc.\" \r\n\r\nAs for the issue with Preview, I wouldn't worry about it too much.
    The best plan is to test kerning with various apps."

    the old-style kerning table is not officially part of the spec for OT CFF fonts.
    So, it may not work. It is supported for the TTF flavor of OT fonts. \r\n\r\nFWIW,
    kerning in OT CFF fonts <em>is</em> supported in non-OT savvy apps. They just
    don't get every possible pair. The system creates an old-style kerning table for
    the apps to use based on a subset of the pairs that would be possible using the
    OT kern feature."

    purposes\u2026 Fontlab is a funny application\u2026 it makes me realize how comfortable
    I am with Adobe, I often find the preview panel doesn't always accurately reflect
    what is done in the Metrics Kerning window\u2026 I'm very meticulous with my work
    and find inconsistencies here and there as well as actual pallete and window features,
    drop downs occassionally stop working as well. (OS X, Fontlab 5) I've had to reinstall
    the program a couple of times to try and solve some of these glitches."

  body: I'm also curious what Twardoch would say as far as going with OT (postscript
    flavored) kerning feature, keeping in mind Simonson mentioning that the system
    auto creates 'old-style' kerning table for non OT apps, I'd like to really push
    the use of the OT features and accept it as a forward format, seems a cleaner
    and simpler way to go plus not any extra work since I have a few recently completed
    fonts that are good to go, pending testing, utilizing the OT kern feature and
    a few other OT features.

  body: "For TrueType-flavored OpenType fonts, if your font only has \"GPOS-table\"
    (OpenType) kerning, you will get zero kerning in applications that don't support
    GPOS kerning but only support \"kern-table\" (non-OpenType) kerning. Incidentally,
    Microsoft Office 2007 for Windows only supports kern-table kerning but the new
    default fonts it ships with (such as Calibri, Cambria, Constantia, Corbel, Candara)
    only include GPOS-table kerning. Result? No kerning at all. I'm still trying to
    figure out why Microsoft did here what they did. So if you make an OpenType TT
    font with just GPOS-table kerning, there will be no kerning at all in applications
    that don't support OpenType Layout. \r\n\r\nFor PostScript-flavored OpenType fonts,
    the operating system takes the GPOS-table (OpenType) kerning, extracts the kerning
    pairs for the Western codepage only, and produces a virtual kern-table kerning
    on the fly. So if you make an OpenType PS font with just GPOS-table kerning, there
    will be kerning in non-OpenType applications but only for Western codepage characters.
    Cyrillic, Greek or Extended Latin characters will have no kerning at all in those
    apps. However, if you include kern-table kerning as well, you will get kerning
    for the non-Western characters at least in some apps. The kern-table kerning is
    not officially supported by the OpenType specification, but I don't know of any
    situation where it would actually break anything (the principle behind the OpenType
    font format is that you can put whatever table you want into the font, and applications
    must ignore the tables they cannot process). \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam Twardoch\r\n\r\n"

    codepage only, and produces a virtual kern-table kerning on the fly.\" \r\n\r\nNote
    that this is only true if the GPOS kerning in the font is built to certain standards
    (one lookup of type 2). GPOS kerning may employ other techniques as well (multiple
    lookups, extension lookup type 9 that allows to overcome the subtable size limitation
    without using subtable breaks, contextual kerning) \u2014 but if your font uses
    any of these, the virtual kerning conversion done by the system will no longer
    work, so non-OpenType applications will have no kerning, not even for Western
    glyphs. In such case, placing the kern-table kerning may be the only solution
    as well. \r\n\r\nBut still, keep in mind that the OpenType specification states:
    \r\n\"OpenType fonts containing CFF outlines are not supported by the 'kern' table
    and must use the 'GPOS' OpenType Layout table.\"* \r\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/OpenType/OTSpec/kern.htm\r\n\r\nThe
    spec does not say that the kern table must not be present in an OpenType PS font,
    nor does it state that OpenType PS fonts must use only the GPOS kerning. But it
    says that OpenType PS fonts with kern-table kerning are not \"supported\" by OpenType,
    whatever that means. \r\n\r\nA."

    kerning pairs can fit into one subtable within the \"kern\" table (and most font
    engines only support one subtable). \r\n\r\nBut there are some old Windows GDI-based
    applications (which still were largely used when the OTF font driver was developed
    12 years ago for Windows 2000) which had a smaller limit. \r\n\r\nToday, I'd say
    the practical limit for the \"kern\" table is indeed 10,920. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam\r\n"

  body: "There is a limit to the number of kerning pairs allowed in an old style kern
    table. If an OpenType kern feature is expanded to an old style kern table, this
    limit can easily be exceeded. So, to prevent this from happening, when the system
    creates an old style kern table on-the-fly from an OT kern feature, it must limit
    the number of pairs.\r\n\r\nOne of the big advantages to using OpenType class
    kerning is that you can kern many more glyph combinations than were possible with
    the older kern tables.\r\n\r\n[edited to fix spelling error]"

    working on with over 4,000 kerning pairs. It's an OT-flavored OT font and it's
    using the OT kern feature. But if that font is loaded into an old non OT-savvy
    app, many pairs will not be kerned that should be. \r\n\r\nThat really stinks.
    I can't wait until all apps are OT-savvy. Hopefully this will happen, and happen
    soon. Right now I am so annoyed when I see kerning that I have worked hard on
    failing to show up when I use the font in various apps. I'm trying to get all
    of them to show up and there are certain problem kerns I'm facing. I have many
    new ideas and possible solutions that I have read about lately that I'm going
    to try to fix this problem with, but maybe the apps I'm loading the fonts into
    aren't very OT-savvy and there isn't anything I can do in that situation - or
    is there? I'm using TextEdit 1.6 on mac, and Microsoft Word X.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone
    know how OT-savvy Mac's TextEdit app is? What about Microsoft Word X? The thing
    that I will say about these apps is 95 percent of the time it seems to me that
    all kerns are showing up. It's that 5 percent that is the problem. Maybe I'm being
    too demanding and will have to accept 95 percent as being the best I can get?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Today I upgraded from fontlab 4.5 to 5, but I hadn't really done any more
    testing to my font yet. Then I did what twardoch recommended. \"...edit the \"kern\"
    feature in the OpenType panel. You can explicitly convert your class-based FontLab
    kerning into the \"kern\" feature in the OpenType panel flyout menu, \"Generate
    kern feature\". If you don't do that and the option \"Generate \"kern\" feature
    if it is not defined\" is enabled, then FLS will generate the \"kern\" feature
    when generating the font.\" It asked me if I wanted to rebuild it, and I clicked
    yes. That fixed all my kerning problems. It looks perfect in textedit now. I haven't
    tested it in Word yet but my version of word is old anyway and may not be opentype
    savvy. But hopefully that's fine too. I'll report back on that soon.\r\n\r\nI
    highly recommend anyone with kerning issues to try this if they haven't.\r\n\r\nTHANX
