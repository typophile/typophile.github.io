body: I am needing to place a logo for a local racing track and they sent me a smaller
  .png of the file and said thats all they have. I can re-illustrate it but I don't
  have the fonts used and am having a hard time finding them.  I would like to know
  both fonts used.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you in advance.
