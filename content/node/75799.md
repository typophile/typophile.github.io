    with such a shin, with its vertical really perfectly vertical, even touching its
    lower horizontal bottom?\r\n\r\nI have never seen that.\r\n\r\nI would reserve
    such a radical design for a modern looking letter set. To me, it looks awkward
    in a traditional-like setting."

  body: "Eli,\r\n\r\nI reviewed Nadav Ezra's Tehila from FontBit. A traditional font
    with an unusual shin.\r\n\r\nAfter carefully looking at your Pnina El, your design
    is very provocative, as it conjures up a whole slew of styles.\r\n\r\nI particularly
    liked the serif spitz on the lower left of the shin. It subtly moves the eye forward
    leftward after the straight vertical middle bar of the shin. In addition, it creates
    more weight to the lower left side of shin, to better match the weight of the
    other letters. Plus, it's a stylistic uniqueness that makes this a special font.\r\n\r\nClearly,
    you are a very talented designer."

  body: "Eli,\r\n\r\nThis is very nicely made. I never thought I'd see a Hebrew based
    on Lombardic letters, but I have now! This will make a very good type for children's
    books, I would think. As the father of two daughters, age 26 and 5, I have seen
    my share of children's books for girls, and I have a feeling this will be a success
    in that realm, perhaps for products, as well.\r\n\r\nIf you follow the Lombardic
    manner, you might try adding that serifed foot on both sides. Here's an American
    example of well-carved Lombardic letters, from the Cathedral of St. John the Divine,
    in Harlem, New York City.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lombardics25_4993.jpg]"

  body: "I suspect that the bottom half of the shin is too wide. Probably in a heavy
    weight, the white spaces close up more on the bottom, and look more balanced.
    When you go to a lighter weight, sometimes you have to change shape to keep the
    rhythm of counters the same. \r\n\r\nIn latin type we have that kind of problem
    working with weights with the aeg, where there are three strokes to work with
    in a small space; that's similar to the shin problem. \r\n\r\n"

  body: I think Rephael is making a good suggestion, because then there is better
    placement for a dotted shin.

  body: "The middle vertical stroke of the shin, and as Bill points out the left vertical
    stroke of the ayin are very straight and mainly of a single width.\r\n\r\nThey
    stand out because of this, and therefore seem odd.\r\n\r\nAlso, as a result, their
    is less rhyme and rhythm to text set in it. The music of text is its movement
    seen in its letters' shapes."
