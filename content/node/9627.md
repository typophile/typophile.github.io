  body: Mariano, you have been patient. I have looked through samples from T-26 &#40;the
    first place I look for Techno fonts&#41;, but this could be newer than my sample
    sheets.  Have you checked the Techno fonts at <a href="http://www.dafont.com"
    target="_blank">DaFont</a> for the freeware fonts? &#40;one of the best freeware
    sites, and one of the very few that sorts fonts by style categories&#41;. <BR>
    <BR>I also checked the two Indie Font books, but no luck there.  <BR> <BR>Maybe
    this post will re-awaken this thread. I think it looks familiar, but that is &#40;for
    me&#41; the problem with Techno fonts -- too many of them look like one another.
    <BR> <BR>I guess that&#39;s what Tech fans would say about Text fonts <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Mike and Patricia, thank you very much for your comments. I aprecciated very
    much. <BR>Actually I said in my first post that it could be a freeware font but
    also, as Patricia say it could have been drawed by hand, since I have to re-draw
    the logotype to have a digital version. <BR>Anyway, thank you very much I always
    get answers in this forum. <BR> <BR>Bye the way, Mike I was watching your site
    bowfinprintworks.com and I find very usefull your Font Identification Guides and
    references , so thanks again <BR> <BR>&#40;sorry for my English&#41;

    by Iconian fonts. It seems to have been slanted witha custom, but dreadful, R.

  body: I think it is a matter of personal taste Mariano. Personally, since the R
    seems to be consistent with the design &#39;theme&#39; of this font, I think it
    fits, and is as good &#40;or bad&#41; as the rest of the font that we can see.
    <BR> <BR>If you like this style, do not let us convince you not to like it.  How
    you use it can be more open to criticism than how the letters look, as long as
    they seem true to the design for the typeface. &#40;In my opinion&#41;

  body: What irks me about the R is that its leg is too much to the right,  <BR>that&#39;s
    all. For the rest I think it&#39;s a consistent design with a well- <BR>defined
    style signature. It&#39;s a good choice if you wan to convey  <BR>a techno/clubbing
    atmosphere.
