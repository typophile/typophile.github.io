  & Company. I plan to revive this typeface digitally. \r\n\r\nBefore I do, could
  you guys help me identify this type or know any ones that are similar in style?
  I've done some research and no luck.  I truly appreciate it, thanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Yamanaka_5832.jpg]"

  body: Agree with Don of course. Hand-drawn. Reminds me of the spirit behind some
    '[[http://www.myfonts.com/search/tag%3Aarchitect|architect]]' fonts. For this
    one, I like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hiekkagraphics/savu|Savu]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fabulousrice/dumb-thick|Dumb
    Thick]] and [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/estilo|Estilo]] (though too formal
    to do the job) as alternative.
