  researching transport (kinneir/calvert) and this leads me to the crux of this post;
  tranport...discuss. any opinions, reactions, quirky info (ie. something that wouldn't
  be on wiki!), useful links, sightings other than uk road signage....\r\n\r\nvery
  much appreciated\r\n\r\npersonally i find it functional. obvious perhaps, but its
  seeming lack of versatility (maybe as a result of its original use which casts a
  somewhat domineering shadow (?)) make this a de facto conclusion."
