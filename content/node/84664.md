  and style used for most infographics designed today? Has anyone encountered an infographic
  that uses a serif typeface? Maybe serif typefaces are too decorative for infographic
  designs? \r\n\r\nWhat is the typeface Good.is uses? http://www.good.is/infographics"

  body: "> infographic that uses a serif typeface\u2026\r\n\r\nA seperate treatment
    of the alphabetical and pictorial parts of info graphics seems still to be the
    average way of doing it.\r\nI think a more fancy approach to info graphics is
    a field yet to be explored. As well as a more related design of both ingredients.
    There are quite interesting designs of the prominent olympic sports pictographs.
    \ \r\n\r\nI provide this [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/andreas-stotzner/andron-corpus-publix/|Andron
    symbol package]] via MyFonts and it sells modestly well. Haven\u2019t seen it
    yet out in the wild though.\r\n\r\n\u2013 Sorry for yet another self ad.  ;-)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Stimmen_publ_t_5251.jpg]"
