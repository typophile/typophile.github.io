body: "Hi All,\r\n\r\nI'm developing my personal identity. The logo is narrowed down
  to a few versions of the same basic idea. I'm mostly looking for formal and aesthetic
  comments, but everything is welcome. I don't really want to give any description
  of the concept; out in the real world, the viewer will be on their own to determine
  what it expresses, so why manipulate others' reactions now? I'm very interested
  in what everyone thinks of the graphic, what impression it gives off, and how it's
  crafted.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nJim\r\n\r\n-- \r\nJim Hargreaves\r\nMA Graphic Design\r\nSavannah

  body: I like _01 best, though I couldn't say which variant. It's well crafted and
    I like the type treatment. The only sure message it sends me is that you would
    like your name to be pronounced "har-gree-ayves". As for the mark, it seems exceptionally
    neutral, evoking nothing and just being a design - and since you're selling design,
    I guess that works.

  body: "I like _03 best. I think it looks a more confident mark.\r\nI generally prefer
    logos where the type and icon interact with each other, and are'nt separate parts.
    With _01 and _02 if the purpose of this project is a visual device to promote
    your name, then the size ratio between the type and icon needs attention.\r\n\r\nYou
    have another design element of the '-' symbol above the 'a', not sure what this
    is telling me? \r\n\r\nAlso for _03 I think you should spell out your full name
    and not the initial."

  body: "I like number 1, the one in the middle best. Looks really nice, I'd like
    to see that one with the none-filled corners rounded like the inside of the filled
    ones, to see if it improves it or not. The \xE3 bothers me when the j and i dosen't
    have any dots.\r\n\r\nI think number 2 would be better if the \"flower\" would
    be filled instead of just having a stroke.\r\n\r\nI like number 3 the least.\r\n\r\nNice
    examples though.\r\n\r\npeter"

  body: "Initially _03 was the one I liked the most think the placement and the serif
    type sold me to it, however i dont understand the bag (in case thats a bag) or
    the frame outside it, on a second look I liked _02 best i feel it more generic,
    and still comunicating the same. however i wonder about the icon placement perhaps
    tilting it up a notch.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jh02_4224.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
    would like to know what the frame in comp_03 means though.\r\n\r\nmy2cents\r\n\r\nMak

  body: "This is why logos ought to be designed in single color.  Others think the
    symbol is a flower.  I thought it was an orange slice.  If that's the case, I
    imagine this is about \"fresh\" design or something.  I also see a hub and partnership.
    \ Let us know if this was intended or not.\r\n\r\nI'd like to see the type (from
    02 as well) made a little less neutral.  I'm not sure I feel much relationship
    between it and the symbol.  And, like the others, I'd like to know what the macron
    over the 'a' is about."

- body: "I agree that it's a finely constructed mark that conveys simplicity, sophistication,
    and freshness. \r\n\r\nI'm cursed with corny shape associations ... so take what
    I say with a grain of salt from this point forward.  Stupidly, I see the orange/flower
    as as a Trivial Pursuit game piece. (Maybe I'm just bitter for sucking at Trivial
    Pursuit.)\r\n\r\nThe examples that are \"framed\", my crazy brain sees a piece
    of toast, which makes the \"flower\" a rather distinctive burn pattern embossed
    by a novelty toaster.\r\n\r\nI hope Dr. Phil isn't reading this."

  body: I love the second version in the last set you've shown. Having the shape a
    little above the name gives it a lot of interest and is unique.
