  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Klavika has been selected as the new face for an engineering recruitment agency who is having a modest rebrand.

I'm having a lot of trouble selecting the right font package!  I'd love to buy the whole family, but its quite expensive, so I'd rather have a subset.

Which brings me to my problem.  Klavika comes in four weights: light, regular, medium and bold.  Basic packs include all weights but exclude small-caps, tabular figures, old style figures etc.  I'm not too fussed about the figures, because the face will mostly be used for the website, business cards, brochures etc.  But, I dont want to go without small-caps, because I use these all the time.  So that rules out basic packs.

Then there are normal packs, which come with all the extras, but limited to combinations of: light + medium, or regular + bold.  Great!  But I think I want light + regular!  Because regular is the best weight to use for the logo, and Light will be great at larger sizes for headlines on the website.

I guess I could buy the full family - but as mentioned, its quite expensive.

What would you do?

I guess I could buy the single weights for light + regular, but I would be kicking myself if I later find a need for the heavier weights.  I'm pretty new at this, so I'd appreciate any thoughts on how I'm going about this, or things that I might have missed.

Cheers,

		<div class="commentbody">For $300 (US) it's a pretty standard price for a big family–and a bargain compared to some of the families in the $1000+ range. I'd buy the big set and recoup the cost by using it in projects for other clients down the line, not to mention other projects for this client. Treat the cost as an investment, not just $300 spent on one cheap identity job.

If the big pack is just too expensive, however, it seems like light+medium would be a lot more useful than light+regular; light and regular are just too similar to build an effective hierarchy.</div>
