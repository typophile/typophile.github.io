  published in 1933 and tell me if there is anything around now with a similar feel?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nColin"

  body: "Thanks so much guys.\r\n\r\nI had the words Copperplate Gothic half formed
    in my mind, but could not get hem out! I find that I have it, but it will only
    work in Classic so I guess if I move if from my Intel iMac to my PPC iBook I can
    compose the few words I need and save it as a pdf to place on the page on my iMac.\r\n\r\nCan
    anyone suggest an alternative to Broadway? I am reproducing a 1933 book of the
    title used in the Font 2.jpg and I want it on the spine which is only about 3mm.
    Gill bold is the right period of course, but feels so different and I'd like something
    with the contrast of the original but of course there is no need for the inlining.\r\n\r\nCheers,
    Colin\r\n--\r\nNo furniture so charming as books. Rev Sydney Smith, 1771 -1845"

  body: "Colin,\r\n\r\nRegular [[http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=broadway|Broadway]]
    does not have the inline. \r\nThe original [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/kabel/|Kabel]]
    dates back to the late 20s (not the ITC Kabel which was redrawn in the 70s and
    has a much higher x-height.\r\n\r\nFutura of course also goes back to that era,
    as does Bank Gothic, designed in the early 30s.\r\n\r\nSomething closer in weight
    to Broadway would be [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/radiant/|Radiant]], a great
    typeface designed in the late 30s.\r\n\r\nGood luck - have fun!\r\n\r\n"
