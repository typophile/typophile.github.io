  body: "It looks like avariety of dot matrix to me. I collect these too. The technique
    used to mark varies: ink, thermal etc. but it is almost always a dot. I made a
    request like yours over a year ago. I didn't get a big response. Probably because
    I worded it a bit like you have. To get a conversation going here it's good to
    assert something or ask a specific sort of question. The more general the question
    the less likely people will respond. There are several good reasons for this believe
    it or not! \r\n\r\nBTW, you may want to lok at these folks' work: \r\n\r\nhttp://www.lineto.com/"
