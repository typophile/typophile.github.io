    body: "Hi Stephen,\r\n\r\nThanks for the compliment about my work. \r\n\r\nNow
      I understand how to get to the PDFs. \r\nWhat's confusing is that it says \"see
      PDF for complete specimen\" but it doesn't really tell you where to click. I
      would like to be able to click on the word PDF to emmediatly start downloading
      the entire specimen I am interested in.\r\n"
