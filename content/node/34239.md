    an uncanny ability of figuring out fonts, especially uncommon ones. What''s your

  body: "I think both of them would be considered sans types, but this particular
    one I would say borders on script, because the letterforms have a hand-drawn (to
    me) feeling about them.\r\n\r\nI second the thoughts about your skills Angel.
    I'm glad you seem to be using your 'powers' for Good, and I appreciate your efforts
    here.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
