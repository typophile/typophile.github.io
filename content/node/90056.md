  curved. Any suggestions?

  body: Thanks guys... not quite sure any of those will look like a campground sign
    (maybe saycheez). Hobo was the closest thing I had found on my own.

  body: "I contacted the nice folks at [[http://www.woodproductsigns.com/|Wood Product
    Signs]] because they had this photo posted of a newer sign they made with that
    older type:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sand-dunes_5308.jpg]\r\nThey
    told me that it was routered out using CAD software, and that the \"font\" (CAD
    letter outlines) they use is called \"Old Time Round Gothic.\" That's not really
    a font, but maybe it can help you in your search?\r\n\r\nNone of these are exact
    matches, but have have a similar retro feel (to me):\r\n- [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/szardesign/zar-brush-gothic/|Zar
    Brush Gothic]]\r\n- [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/comicraft/dash-decent/|Dash
    Decent]]\r\n- [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/parkinson/wigwag/|Wigwag]]\r\n- [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/magnesium/fonts/|Magnesium]]\r\n-
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dtptypes/delargo-dt-rounded/|Delargo Rounded]]\r\n\r\nSearch
    terms like \"monoline,\" \"rounded,\" \"speedball,\" \"showcard,\" retro may get
    you closer...\r\n"
