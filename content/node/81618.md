body: "Hello, I am done with my font on FONTLAB except for the fact that my font is
  double the size of any regular font. I would like to reduce it, meaning reducing
  all the contents of my glyphs without having to set all my metrics, kernings, etc
  all over again.\r\n\r\nI notice this when I tried posting it in FontSpace and on
  the preview the capital letters got cut off on the top part . I realized the ascender
  value needs to be changed, BUT I don't know how to to this (I'd like to know how
  this is done). Nevertheless, they are too big and I think my problem can be solved
  by reducing the contents of all my glyphs.\r\n\r\nCan I have some advice on this
  please?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance"

    simply go to the <strong>Font Info</strong> dialog, and then the section <strong>General</strong>.
    And then you'll measure what the highest point in your font is, and take that
    coordinate and put it into the <strong>Ascent</strong> box, then measure the lowest
    point and put that into the <strong>Descent</strong> box. Then make sure <strong>Scale
    Outlines</strong> is unchecked and press OK. Then open <strong>Font Info</strong>
    again and put a rational number into EM size, generally 1000 or 2048, this time
    with <strong>Scale Outlines</strong> checked, and press OK.\r\n\r\nBasically your
    making sure everything is inside the bounding box, and then making the EM size
    normal."

  body: "I figured out how to make the font smaller without altering my metric settings.
    Bring out the ACTIONS panel from the TOOLS menu. Under \"Contour\" choose \"Scale
    (50.00, 50.00) HMZ. Click on boxes \"Scale hints\" and \"Scale metrics\" Apply
    the scale you wish. On the \"Scale center\" option: choose \"Reference point\".
    Click on \"Apply to entire font\" is this is your case.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUT I am still
    trying to figure out how to change ascender value\r\n\r\nThanx"

    that good practice suggests that the sum of the Ascender and Descender AS A POSITIVE
    NUMBER equals the em size."
