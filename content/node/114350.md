    Font ID Guide]] and used some of the font tools and have not found any close matches.
    Have you seen other letters to prove this is a font? When there is a 'font' with
    no duplicate letters, it's always possible that it's hand-drawn. In your sample
    the 'disconnects' appear to be added over the stroke, rather than the letters
    being spread apart.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
