  Sowersby]]. The KLIM studio has been set up to deal specifically with typographic
  issues within the realm of graphic design. If you need something that is typographic
  by nature, then I am at your service. \r\n\r\n<strong>A thing well made\u2026</strong>\r\n\u2026is
  a song by legendary New Zealand band The Mutton Birds. \u2018When a man holds a
  thing well made, there is a connection, there is completeness\u2026\u2019 This philosophy
  is at the very heart of my approach to typographic design\u2014for art is long and
  life is short.\r\n\r\nURL: http://www.klim.co.nz/"
