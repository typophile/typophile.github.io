body: 'Hi, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m looking to find out what font is used in the Century Theatres
  logo. In case anyone is wondering, I&#39;m not trying to steal it or anything. I
  actually work for the company, but nobody wants to help us out. We&#39;re trying
  to put it in some paperwork that we give to employees, but we need it to be text,
  not graphic. <BR> <BR>The closest font that I&#39;ve been able to find is Albertus
  Medium, but it isn&#39;t quite right. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/40899.jpg"
  alt="Small logo"> <BR> <BR>If you click <a href="http://www.wdwgfh.com/centurylogo/combobig.jpg">this
  link</a>, you&#39;ll get a rather large version to look at details. <BR> <BR>Knowing
  the company, I really don&#39;t think it is a custom font, but I don&#39;t think
  I&#39;ve seen it anywhere else. <BR> <BR>If anybody could help, I&#39;d appreciate
  it. '
