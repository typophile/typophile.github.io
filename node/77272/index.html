  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">why is it considered rude or insulting to set the word ‘god’ with only the first letter as a capital (God) or with no capitals (god)?, why does it have to be GOD? is it so his/her/it’s name can tower above all other words? in that case is it rude to set it in small caps? and what if the typographer or author doesn’t believe in GOD can it then just be ‘god’? 
I prefer ‘god’ since their are quite a few of them. 

I'm not talking about religious books, the book I noticed it in was about Casanova and in one chapter there was a GOD sticking out every couple of sentences.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">My understanding is that one normally writes "God" when referring to... God, and "god" when referring to pagan deities. There may be a tradition in which GOD is written, but I am not familiar with it.

In certain translations of the Bible, the word LORD is written in all capitals, or with a capital L, and the rest in small capitals, when it is being substituted for the Divine Name (the Tetragrammaton, Yod-He-Vau-He).

I am primarily aware of Roman Catholic usage in this matter. The word "God" is capitalized when referring to God, as are any other nouns that refer to Him (i.e., the Creator, the Trinity) or personal pronouns referring to Him, or any of the Persons of the Trinity (i.e., the Holy Spirit, God the Father).

Incidentally, note that Jesus Christ is not a proper name as popularly believed. It is derived from the Greek Iesous Khristos, and thus literally means Joshua the Anointed. Thus, capitalizing Christ is an example of capitalizing a common noun, as opposed to a proper name, when it refers to a Person of the Trinity.

As far as I am aware, some Protestant denominations follow Catholic usage, and others have their own rules which do not require capitalization to the same extent.</div>

I just checked a bible we have at home and it is in small caps, another book has it as 'God the Merciful' (Why capital M?!), so that answers 2 of my questions. I guess their aren't any specific rules to it. It could be God, GOD, or small caps GOD.

Thanks to everyone for the responses.

Don't you wish everyone just followed the rules, they're capitalizing common nouns and adjectives. :> 

Their should be 10 typographic commandments "thou shall not capitalize adjectives" ...</div>

IMHO, “God” is a term improperly used by Christianity and Judaism as a proper name for their deity. This only makes sense if you think that there is only one god, so you can’t be confused: the others can be idols, demons, deities, false gods, but no “God”. A bit arrogant, I think.

So when I have the chance I name the Christian god as Yahweh — YHWH and Jehovah are acceptable variants. Or, if I want to refer to the father, the son and the Holy Spirit, then I go for “Trinity”. Of course, I don’t have this freedom too often, except on my own writings. If I am working for someone else, the chances are that I must keep the capital (God) or everyone will get upset.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Aziz,

We can just think of god names as we do anyone else's proper name.  Capitalize the first letter of any proper name, whether it be a particular god's name or any normal mortal.  I am not the least bit religious but I think making every proper name follow the same rule is fair, clear, and easy.  I believe that many people throughout history have believed in various gods as is their personal choice. I am not interested in all the arguments among religious zealots of all faiths.  From what I have seen, the only thing that comes out of it is that people end up getting killed or "Cleansed" or whatever euphemism they choose. From the sheer stupidity of the Crusades, and the Spanish Inquisition to Northern Ireland, Bosnia, Iraq, Iran, India and Pakistan, American KKK, Hitler, and soon to be Darfar, people murder each other more in the name of their own god than any other reason.  The funny thing is that no religion tells us to go out and kill.  Humans just make that all up to excuse their own violent nature and feed their power-hungry greed..</div>

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">The reason for only capitalizing extra words referring to the Christian God is if the author <em>is</em> a Christian, or at least writing for an audience of Christians. In that case, one is both signalling that a pronoun refers to a particular god, and that one believes, or is acknowledging a belief, that the particular god being referred to is the One Real God, all others being imitations.

Because of that, some texts will instead be produced according to a neutral style guide instead of a traditional Christian style guide, just as Jehovah's Witnesses, Jews, and some atheists will use the abbreviation for "Common Era" instead of that for "Anno Domini". Given that the Western world has been overwhelmingly Christian in the past, and the traditional style was deeply ingrained, however, many people find the neutral style offensive, or at least jarring, which is why it is not universal even in this age of political correctness.

As to the issue raised by Chris Lozos (Dezcom), I hope the following comments of mine will not be too intensely polarizing, but will instead promote clarification:

Does religion produce nothing except people fighting over sectarian differences? Sometimes it may seem that way. One could certainly claim that revealed religion, as opposed to natural religion, is not <em>required</em> for any of the good things that are said to come of religion; one can be an atheist and still care about one's fellow man. But "A is not required for B" is not the same statement as "A does not promote B".

The idea that God appeared to humans in one particular time and place, with one genuine, accurate, and trustworthy revelation - and one official priesthood that requires your support, respect, and obedience - certainly makes religious conflict possible. But it also makes religion <em>easier to understand</em>, and, at least for some people, easier to accept, than would be the case if religion remained on a more abstract or philosophical plane.

Thus, while the kind of religious belief that carries with it the potential for religious conflict is <em>not required</em> for non-violence or charity, it would be unfair not to give traditional revealed religion the credit it is due for further promoting these things than something less intelligible to, and less zealously instilled in, young children would do.</div>

To quote Spiderman's Uncle, "With great power comes great responsibility."

Organized religion is neither a requirement or even a needed participant for charitable work. There are many members of organized religions that do charitable work.  I would imagine that the percentage of devout Christians in the USA who do charitable work is about the same as it is among the rest of the population of the country, including atheists and agnostics. If you are doing helpful things for other people just because you fear an afterlife in hell, then you are far less a good person than if you give of yourself for others simply because you just "know" it is the right thing to do. People had compassion and concern for others long before there was an organized religion to relieve them of the responsibility of just deciding right and wrong on their own.
I am not saying religion is necessarily bad, I am saying it does not absolve us of our personal responsibility to decide to do the right thing.  You can believe your reward will be in heaven.  I believe your "reward" is simply in the hearts of the people that you help right here on earth. When I die, I will simply decompose and become organic matter for rejuvenation of the soil. Whatever I do, I must do here on earth because there is no second chance afterward.  Be charitable NOW for the sake of charity alone. If you do it out of fear for your soul, reward in an afterlife, or to impress others, you are still being selfish while taking what appears to be a selfless action.

With that, I close my sermon and promise not to bother you any more with my views on organized religion.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">In English, the names of religous faiths definitely are capitalized: Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, and so on; just as are the names of nations: France, Britain, Belgium; or the names of languages: English, French, Mandarin, Putonghua, Guo-yu, Cantonese, Southern Min, Frisian, Basque; or of language families: Hamitic, Semitic, Indo-European.

All of these, after all, are arguably proper nouns, since they are the names of unique things.

Words derived from names or other proper nouns are also capitalized in English. Thus, words naming ethnicities are almost always capitalized: Caucasian, Polynesian, Jewish, Negro, Asian, Oriental, East Indian, Native American. However, "white", "black", and so on are not capitalized, even when used to refer to people of Caucasian or African origin.

One specific exception to this is that officially SI units derived from proper names are not to be capitalized, contrary to normal English usage. This official ruling is still often ignored in the English-speaking world as it is contrary to long-established habit - thus, one will still tend to see references to A above middle C as having a frequency of 440 Hertz; on the other hand, while Siemens is likely to be capitalized, Ohm usually isn't, from familiarity with it as a unit. But Joule, Newton, Faraday, and Pascal still tend to be capitalized even when used as units, since that is what people are used to from older textbooks.

People who studied science and engineering, that is, because for most people in the English-speaking world, either metric units would not have appeared in most older textbooks, or at least non-compound units of quantities (Pascal rather than pounds per square inch, Hertz rather than cycles per second) other than length, mass, area and volume would not have so appeared.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The Ngrams result is interesting, but the conventional form "God", when put in as a third alternative, far exceeds the other two in popularity. And it has a peak as well, though: from 1670 to 1710, earlier than the much smaller 1710-1770 peak of the all-caps form.

Also, a look through Google Books leads me to suspect that the majority of the occurrences of "GOD" were not in the midst of lowercase text, but were simply within all-caps chapter headings and the like.</div>
