body: "Hello!\r\n\r\nIt's my first time here, so I'll quickly introduce myself: I'm
  Carel Fransen, graphic designer from the Netherlands, and currently working on my
  graduation projects.\r\n\r\nFor my project, I'm looking for a quality condensed
  font with a large x-height that does great at small corps-sizes (approx. 6-7 pt).\r\n\r\nI
  have got one font that works very well: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/bureau-grot/light/|Bureau
  Grot Light]]. However, I'd like to have some options. Unfortunately, due to the
  \"advanced search\"-mechanisms on big font-sites not being that advanced, it's nearly
  impossible to search for something this specific.\r\n\r\nI hope that some of you
  might be able to give me some recommendations. Preferably, I'd like a font with
  some Opentype-features like different kinds of figures, but most importantly it
  should be a bit condensed, readable at small sizes, and kerned nicely.\r\n\r\nThank
  you in advance!\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nCarel\r\n"

    check whether it meets your needs.\r\nDon"
