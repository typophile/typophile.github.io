body: 'Looking for fonts that could be used as a corporate display font for a large
  shoping mal complex. It should be used in all their ads as a large display font
  together with b&w fashion imagery. The keywords for the font should be: 1. Classical,
  seductive (HTF Didot or  Mercury Display are good examples but I need some more)
  or 2. Entertaining & strong (Boxing match vegas lightbulb font) This should be a
  vector font drawn with similar quality and professional approach to the typeface
  design as you would find in any of Tobias Frere Jones typefaces. Is there any typefaces
  like this around????)'

  body: The script used in Las Vegas is beautiful but not quite what I am looking
    for. I need a type that is both corporate enough to sell and still completely
    out of the ordinary. Preferably a Gothic or geometric type
