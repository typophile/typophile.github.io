body: "This logo is for a small architects firm. The majority of their work is for
  local homeowners (house extensions, refurbs, etc). They are a small company, with
  only about 5 employees.\r\n\r\nAlthough this is pro bono and no real brief was provided,
  I talked to the owner of the company and he said that one of the main selling points
  of the business was that every client got the full and undivided attention of a
  fully qualified architect (I had presumed every architects business would do this
  but there you go).\r\n\r\nBased on what I was told about their audience and business
  mantra, I tried to design something friendly and personable that would appeal to
  their clients without losing the professional look required for something people
  would be spending a lot of money on. At the moment it is just the logo, I plan on
  adding the company name later, but want to hear critique of just the logo for now.\r\n\r\nI've
  spent quite a bit of time on this and am in need of fresh eyes. Would be great to
  hear some critique."

  body: "Did you draw the letters, or use a font? The aperture of the R seems too
    tall to me \u2013 well maybe not too tall but too \u201Copen\u201D compared to
    the A. The A also doesn't really match the R stylistically. The A seems almost
    Asian, and is a bit more dynamic whereas the R is similar to Goudy and is more
    traditional. I'm curious about the circle on top of the A. Does it have significance,
    or is it just a design element? I wonder if there's a better way to communicate
    what kind of business is being represented, since it's rather ambiguous \u2013
    unless that's what you intended. Is the firm known for a particular style of design?
    Are they conservative, traditional? Or a bit more creative and experimental? The
    letter forms should reflect the personality of the firm and it's work. This is
    totally my subjective opinion, but a mark with a firmer structure might be better
    suited for an architect firm."

  body: "This says <em>professional</em> to me, but it doesn't say <em>personal</em>.
    \r\nThe old-style <strong>R</strong> (Goudy?) also says <em>old</em>, as does
    the compass (I assume 21st Century architects draw circles and arcs with a computer).
    If your client's core business is renovating historic homes, the message of old-school
    craftsmanship might be just right.\r\nOtherwise, I'd look for imagery with less
    emphasis on the process (<em>here's how we do it</em>) and more on the outcome
    (<em>your new kitchen/living room will make you feel so comfortable/proud</em>)."

  body: "I have to agree on the nauticality and the vintage vibe of this design. Besides,
    putting a circle on top of an A makes another letter: \xC5. The ring is not a
    diacritic, \xC5 represents the sound \"aw\" in all Scandinavian and several other
    minor European languages. "

  body: "Thanks for the comments so far, I'll definitely put them to use later today
    when I work on the design.\r\n\r\nEd_Aranda - The 'A' was drawn by myself and
    the R is Garamond (if I remember correctly - I'm at work now so can't check) with
    a bit of customization. The 'A' is supposed to be a compass. The work they do
    is definitely on the traditional side - they do indeed renovate old homes and
    are also known for doing church renovations so I thought this would work. I hear
    what you say about a firmer structure though. I'll post a few more ideas later.\r\n\r\nMojo
    - you're right about the old school craftsmanship vibe, I do think it works for
    the company as their business revolves around renovation of older buildings rather
    than modern design of steel and panel buildings. I'm glad you recognized it as
    a compass! I think what you say about looking for imagery concerning the outcome
    will help make the logo more personable, I'll have a think about other concepts.\r\n\r\nI
    think the nautical vibe might be coming from the traditional serif font and of
    course the compass being a map readers tool! Alaskan, you are seeing the logo
    as blue? Might be the JPG because it is actually black. Is the 'A' reminding you
    of an anchor?\r\n\r\nI'm thinking of changing the R to a Sans and changing the
    A a little to make it feel a little more modern, as well as hopefully losing the
    nautical vibe."

- body: "\r\nYes, the A looks like an anchor awkwardly leaning on a post. The pencil
    compass isn't obvious at all; for starters, the ring on top is too thick and as
    I recall, they have knobs on top, not rings. But, even if it read as a protractor,
    I'd be saying it's a cliche choice. This compass-as-a-letter idea has been so
    beaten to death that I (personally) don't think it's even worth exploring. \r\n\r\nArchitecture
    is filled with beautifully structured visuals; why would you choose a tool that
    most people associate with elementary school? \r\n\r\n"

  body: Yeah I think I need a few more concepts as this one probably is overused.
    I did look at a lot of other architects firms logos and the vast majority didn't
    have any imagery so I thought I'd try and incorporate something that says 'architects'
    without having to actually write it. From the responses so far I obviously haven't
    got there yet. Back to the drawing board for now...

    architecture, but maybe the client doesn''t need to try too hard to convince people
    of what line of work they''re in. I''m with AndreaC with regard to the shade of
    cyan: it''s a little harsh on the screen and it could fade away on paper. [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/exljbris/museo/|Museo]]
    has a structured look that suits architecture, but I wonder if it''s too trendy,
    and since it''s a free typeface, possibly too ubiquitous.'

  body: The color choice is certainly bold. If would work better if you chose a different
    hue or desaturated it. The perfect symmetry itself is very cool, even if it's
    not explicitly telling about the company's area. I would opt to try to keep it
    if I were you.

  body: Have you tried using just two colors instead of three ? I.e. paint the overlap
    differently. By the way the shape of the mark is really nice, though again not
    sure if it's a bit too smooth, curvy and rounded for something as precise as architecture.

  body: Having the "a" in the darkest tone puts the emphasis on that character. It
    should be the other way around. R for Randfield is more important than A for associates.

  body: I have tried using 2 colours, though I think it makes it look a little old
    fashioned, the picture below shows it with 2 colours and harder edges (might rework
    it into squarer letters to explore your point about it being too rounded) and
    also with the colours swapped to put the emphasis on the 'r'. I'm not sure about
    that as having the a darker seemed to look more balanced, could always adjust
    the colours a bit I suppose.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/comparison_5223.png]

    the sharp corners are not working either .. though on the other hand the corner
    radius in the other two is a bit too big.\r\n\r\nAnother idea - what if the \"r\"
    was simply sitting on top of the \"a\" ? Just forget about the overlap. The \"a\"
    should still be easy to see I think. \r\n"

    field, opposite to what people think. Engineering is an Exact field (I have a
    BA in Architect and an AAS in Graphic Design). The logo is structured, well-aligned,
    symmetrical, suggests spatiality, layered, all things that relate to architectural
    drawings and how they work.
