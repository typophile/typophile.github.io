  body: Looks like someone added some drippy to a casual serif script like <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=UR.109683.0.0&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=S%27more+of+YOSEMITE&sampleSize=32">Avon</a>,
    <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=UR.109675.0.0&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=S%27more+of+YOSEMITE&sampleSize=32">Apache</a>
    or <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=UR.109962.0.0&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=S%27more+of+YOSEMITE&sampleSize=32">Parade</a>.

  body: I think <a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?4F1">Sixpack</a> is even closer

    style?!?
