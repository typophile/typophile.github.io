  files. Aside from Area 51 are there any apps/scripts that can quickly convert a
  batch of UFO files to OTF or some other format Fontlab reads natively? Can I do
  this from the command line with FontForge?"

    easily using the [[http://code.typesupply.com/wiki/ufo2fdk|ufo2fdk]] package that
    I released last week. In fact, the demo script from my presentation might be a
    good starting point for you. It is included below. (Replace the \"....\" with
    the appropriate white space.)\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you could use the batch generator
    in [[http://tools.typesupply.com/area51.html|Area51]].\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nfrom robofab.world
    import OpenFont\r\nimport ufo2fdk\r\nimport glob\r\nimport os\r\n\r\n# path to
    the fonts\r\ndirectory = \"/path/to/a/directory/containing/ufos\"\r\n\r\n# print
    a message if the FDK can't be found\r\nif not ufo2fdk.haveFDK():\r\n....print
    \"I couldn't find the FDK :-(!\"\r\n# if the FDK is available\r\nelse:\r\n....#
    start the compiler\r\n....compiler = ufo2fdk.OTFCompiler()\r\n\r\n....# for each
    UFO in the directory\r\n....for ufoPath in glob.glob(os.path.join(directory, \"*.ufo\")):\r\n........print
    \"Compiling: %s...\" % os.path.basename(ufoPath)\r\n........# put the OTF next
    to the UFO\r\n........otfPath = os.path.splitext(ufoPath)[0] + \".otf\"\r\n........#
    open the UFO\r\n........font = OpenFont(ufoPath)\r\n........# compile\r\n........report
    = compiler.compile(font, otfPath)\r\n........# print the makeotf report\r\n........print
    report[\"makeotf\"]\r\n\r\n# done\r\nprint \"Done!\"\r\n</code>"

  body: "I try to compile my UFO font to OTF as explained above but it doesn't work
    because my UFO font is not complete.\r\n\r\nI'm working on a project where typography
    is gradually created. Thus, I don't have a complete UFO font but I have to create
    the OTF to display the progress\u2026\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have an idea for this
    case?\r\n\r\nThank you very much."

  body: Can you do it with FontForge? Yes, I'm pretty sure you can. FF can read UFO,
    and it handles scripts, both Python and its own old scripting language.
