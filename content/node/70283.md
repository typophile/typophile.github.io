  I took in account, it should have an official look to it,\r\nuse of blue and red
  (nba-nfl...), the short for 'open poker championship' should\r\nbe well readable
  (easy reference for people;'yeah I'm attending the OPC') \r\nand there should be
  a direct link to poker in the main visual.\r\n\r\nI created the following logo's
  but I feel there could be some improvement (mainly on the visual consistency-coherence
  and used type),\r\n\r\nhttp://img534.imageshack.us/img534/3774/opcx.jpg\r\n\r\nIt
  would be nice if you guys could share some thoughts !\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,
  \r\n\r\nMatt"

  body: What did they used it by designing poker logos? Is it a Photoshop? I've been
    suggested if I join this competition, I would like to have a custom logo with
    matching chips near of the top corner.

  body: I don't really get the immediate connection to poker on that logo, but I guess
    I could understand it a little maybe. It looks like the rounded shapes were put
    into perspective, and <em>then</em> the little pointy bits were added... they
    don't seem like they're in perspective with the logo. Maybe work on tweaking that
    so they seem to fall back into space as well. The descender on the /p/ is a bit
    short, and the angles on the terminals of the /c/ don't seem to be the same, so
    the /c/ looks like it's tipping (the two points for each terminal don't line up
    to its vertical counterpoint, either). The subtitles also stick off the logotype
    a bit too far... shorten that up a bit so it fits perfectly within the width of
    the "opc."

  body: "Agree with aluminium.\r\nWhat about an uppercase OPC?\r\nIf I am not wrong,
    the logo is a diamond, which is cool but I will go for a more recognisable spade..

  body: Agreed with Luca. The diamond doesn't immediately communicated, especially
    in its current location. A spade or clover would be better.

  body: Hm. I was going to say why not to try and change the mark into two (French-style)
    doors, swinging half-open symmetrically, but then it would probably look like
    a loo entry in those stylized country restaurants with the heavy use of wood and
    carpentry work... may still be worth a shot though...

  body: "The card is displayed as if it were a door. I see the connection, but try
    laying it flat on the table. Suddenly it's moving towards you and inviting you
    in. Perhaps add a couple more cards and now we have a 3-d world to \"look into,\"
    which might suggest openness the way youre attempting.\r\n\r\nAlso, the spacing
    of \"OPC\" is soooo open that it looses its punch."
