Because although Hrant can  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->occasionally get on my nerves as no one else can and  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->infuriate me to unknown levels, I firmly believe that  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this - kinda - tribute is deserved. Because I've got  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a gut feeling that Hrant is one of the good guys, and  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->no amount of online abuse will convince me of the  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->contrary. Me like him too. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And really, there's nothing Hrant can throw at you  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->that a healthy dose of self-relativation and a good  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sense of humour won't help you through.

His comments are indeed provocative, which in my opinion is the best kind of discussion. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm not at all sure what happened on the thread between Hrant and Gerald Giampa, but I've noticed that Hrant has been missing from the discussion and critique boards since then.

He is honest, trusting, trustworthy, generous, kind, and forgiving. And quite mild-mannered!!! He is geniunely interested in intellectual effort and a search for truth.

		<div class="commentbody">Folks, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I heard you chaps don't like my humour. Then you are really going to like this. It's not funny. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->First of all I think all of us respect and have heard of John Hudson. I am sure he too is sympathetic with your buddy, probably he too thinks I am a little pissed off and you know something. He just might be right about that. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But if you think John Hudson and Ross Mills would be involved in type making without my encouragement you are wrong. Does that tell you anything? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If Hrant keeps people like Erik Spiekermann, Joseph D. Treacy, Jim Rimmer,  myself and only God knows who else that does not bother to contribute because of his puerile, ego centric, insulting attacks just because they don't believe the unbelievable, you are better off without the clan member. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->One thing I can assure you all this tear jerking is just a lot of wasted  drama. Hrant does nothing but write in the Forum his two cents on virtually anything, and everything he knows nothing about.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->His work is truly boring at best and rest assured that he is thoroughly addicted to this culthood of button pushers that I predict he could never be gone for long enough. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->His Pascal &quot;fantasy&quot; is crap supported by a letterpress spokesman that could never have ever found gainful employment in a real print shop. His press work is good but it is done, from what I can make of it, on a press that is idiot proof by design. I hope I am wrong, a proof press. I would be much happier if it were something more. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->He should try a 32 page book forme on a 44 inch semi automatic cylinder press and see how he cuts the mustard, any bets? Believe me, it will quickly separate the men from the boys. He is an enthusiastic hobby printer at best resting on his laurels. He obviously knows nothing about Linotypes, Monotypes, or he would not spout such uninformed material in his teachings to boo hoo Hrant. He knows little to nothing of type cutting which is clearly indicated by his sitting in the bleachers of Hrants cheering section. If he believes what Hrant tells him then he too, is just passing wind. If he believe in the &quot;Pascal Fantasy&quot; the man is an idiot. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I put more impressions through my hands in one month that he ever did in his entire life span. He prints mainly by polymer which does not give authentic entitlement of any expertise as a letterpress printer. I know, he has played with a little type in a California job case, maybe printed Christmas cards on a treadle hand fed platen press. Nothing wrong with that. But his preference towards  polymer leans towards what I deem to be low grade material. Or more rudely put, &quot;buyer beware material&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Putting it bluntly how many ems per hour can this man set? I know my money would not go on Gerald Lange in a typographical horse race. People you have never heard of outperform and know more than he. Common run of the mill letterpress printers. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That been said I think Gerald Lange had a great opportunity. Now, after his tear jerking to comes to pass, if he ever comes to his senses, he will of wished he had been a little more diplomatic in his handling of myself in particular. I am not a nut case belonging in an institute thank you all very much. I have made a tremendous contribution to this industry and further if he considers me to be &quot;a has been&quot; as does his bossum buddy boo hoo Hrant, may I suggest the following, he is &quot;a never has been&quot;. So he will never have anything to be &quot;nostalgic about&quot;. Get my point. So before it is to late, you cry babies should welcome Jim Rimmer, Joe Treacy, and myself to speak our piece. Gerald Lange should have welcomed us. You know why he did not, he is too busy protecting his pecking order. But is about to miss, taking you with him, a rare opportunity to leap frog your knowledge far beyond what previously has been available to you. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The opportunity is passing before your very eyes, an opportunity that will never again show its face because some of us &quot;middle aged&quot; &quot;Honky&quot; &quot;White &quot;Male&quot; punchcutters are going to give up on you all. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So do not waste your time with a phoney 60 hr letterpress expert. There is no such thing. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I KNOW LITTLE OF THE CULTURE OF THE DELETTANTI  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">This is a very weird thread, but since my name has been mentioned, here are my thoughts. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Over the years, in various forums, I've had many violent clashes with Hrant, often prompted by him saying something incredibly insulting about someone else. I'm not going to go over the history, but one of my objections has always been that his mode of hectoring discourse puts people off and stifles contribution from people who might like to engage with the topic under discussion, but do not wish to do so in the way in which Hrant discusses things. I don't buy Hrant's suggestion that these people lack confidence or need to develop stronger spines. In a civil society, people who value discourse work to create an environment in which such discourse can flourish. This is not some kind of Darwinian debating society in which only the most 'confident' (loudest, most prolific, most thick-skinned) survive. I don't claim to always manage to create a good environment myself &ndash; I can be as abrasive as Hrant &ndash;, but unlike him I do see my failings as failings, and not as virtues. I believe that we have an obligation to foster broad and open discourse, and this will often require us to adjust the way in which we engage in that discourse ourselves. Typically, this implies nothing more onerous than being polite.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Jon, re. Socrates. I have no doubt that Socrates' method was considered 'extremely offensive by many of his time'. If you were simply implying by your original comment that both Socrates and Hrant are offensive to many people, then I have no argument: I was concerned that your comment suggested that Socrates' method and Hrant's method are similar. They are different methods, both capable of causing offense to some people. As it happens, Socrates' method doesn't offend me &ndash; and I have been subjected to it more than once, complete with irony &ndash;, while Hrant offends me quite regularly, although I tend not to get involved in squabbles with him as much as I used to. The ambience is better when people ignore his insults and encourage him to talk about type. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I am also very far from convinced that Hrant's goals involve goodness or truth.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">What is at issue here which is not a matter of personality, and is important to the usefulness of discussion, is manners on a discussion board.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Let me discuss Hrant's view, then mine.   <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;We come from different environments, and naturally civility has different measures for you and me. The key thing to realize is that in any multicultural milieu such as this, you cannot enforce Western social ideals (or any social ideals) without stifling content. The only thing you should try to enforce is tolerance. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->-Sounds plausible, but is in fact profoundly wrong. First of all, all societies have standards of politeness in them, and traditional societies are more courteous, not less, than Western society. (Incidentally, putting tolerance as practically the sole social virtue is a typical American and even more typical L.A. mistake.)   <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Furthermore, there is a unifying idea to politeness, even though its forms vary in different cultures. That unifying idea - according to the antropologists who wrote the book 'Questions and Politeness', and studied politness in different cultures - is avoiding embarassment to the other person in a discussion.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Is saying something that belittles the other person helpful to furthering debate? No. Is it harmful? Very often, yes, because it diverts the subject or stops debate or drives people away.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What I want to make clear is that Hrant's 'cultural' defense doesn't hold water at all. But, as is usually the case with any passionately held view, there is a kernel of truth in Hrant's view, even though as explicitly formulated it is quite wrong.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The manners of debate are not an easy thing. Socrates is definitely a gadfly stinging people in Plato's dialogues, as John Coltz notes, and not a model of politeness or gentleness.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As 'Questions and Politeness' points out, one of the problems is that debate aimed at uncovering the truth requires clarity, and politeness often requires ambiguity and vagueness, so as to avoid giving offence.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now hard hitting debate aimed at the truth, which keeps on the topic and is not openly personal at all, can give offense. This is because if the person is a professional in the subject, then their professional standing is partly at question when their views or work is questioned. This aspect of politeness must indeed be compromised for a forum like this to be useful.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And in this respect Hrant's view, though misguided, has an element of truth in it: to participate in a rational debate about the substance of something you care about requires a willingness to take some lumps. In fact, this is why Western society is less polite than traditional societies - in which all argument is regarded as rude. It is the Socratic heritage of valuing debate aimed at the truth so much that people should swallow their pride to learn from it.   <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->However, arguments to the person, rather than the topic, serve no purpose in discovering the truth, and in fact impede it.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The rule that will best serve for all of us to learn on this board is in fact very simple:  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stay on the topic and don't get personal.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now when I sinned recently in this respect on another thread, I was reminded that it is especially easy to misconstrue and take and give offence in ASCII. And therefore I think we have to take special care to act with the courtesy as we would with the person being in the room, and not thousands of miles away. For over time a community like this will in fact meet each other. And in any case this will further productive discussion. Who was that sage who warned me of the dangers of 'ASCII-itis'? Oh, yeah I remember - Hrant.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What to do when someone does get personally insulting or tediously irrelevant. Another second rule: be silent. So, in answer to Jon Coltz question, if it is Hrant Hyde rather than Hrant Jeckle, silence is appropriate. Don't take the bait! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now I am certainly a repentent sinner on these issues, as John Hudson says he is also, but I think the rules that help a debate forum like this are the simple ones I have stated.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1. Stay on topic and don't get personal.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2. Be silent and don't take the bait when someone is insulting. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->These will serve to handle, dare I say it, the 'Rant' in all of us, and keep discussion productive.    <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->   <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you for the thoughtful post, William. I would like to expand on one point you made, partly because I think it might be misinterpreted and partly because it is a useful example of the distinction between 'hard hitting debate aimed at the truth' and personal attack aimed at demeaning someone. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As you note, when engaged in a debate and claiming any kind of expert status based on experience or occupation, one puts one's professional reputation on the line to a certain extent. This happens as a matter of course, although it is unusual for someone's reputation to be destroyed in such debate or even more than temporarily tarnished. That it happens as a matter of course is an important point, because it helps us to contrast the intrinsic vulnerability of professional reputation in honest and focused debate of a topic against an open attack on an individual's reputation as a means of shifting focus from the topic &ndash; and from that individual's views on the topic &ndash; onto the person. In the first case, an individual's reputation sustains collatoral damage from an attack on his ideas. In the second case, the reputation is attacked directly in order to undermine confidence in the ideas. I've seen Hrant perform the latter manoeuvre numerous times: if someone disagrees with him &ndash; or, sometimes, if he imagines that someone might disagree with him: actual knowledge of the other person's ideas does not seem to be a prerequisite &ndash;, he will attempt to undermine the reputation of that person. As one example, he did this on Typophile not long ago when I mentioned the presentation on the psychology of word recognition that Microsoft's Kevin Larson will be giving at ATypI. Not content to wait to hear what Dr Larson has to say on the subject, from the position of a PhD in cognitive psychology specialising in empirical studies of reading, Hrant almost immediately called into question Larson's professional conduct by suggesting that he was telling Microsoft what they were paying to hear. It is this kind of attack that I find most offensive in Hrant's mode of discourse.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Gerald Lange, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->We agree it is all about Hrant. This post I believe was initiated in particular by his inept ability to distance himself from his &quot;racial inflictions&quot; (Not my words) about this. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And it seems to me that Mr Giampa's post regarding  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Pascal60.jpg">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Pascal60.jpg</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->on Wednesday, June 25, 2003 - 12:53 am was exactly correct. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You apparently have problems yourself but express them differently. Equally as objectionable. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The resulting attack on Joe, who by the way is a very nice guy was certainly undeserving. I think I have made myself fairly clear on that matter. However it appears difficult by the injections from the &quot;nipple sucking cult kittens&quot; to feel confident of that. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Before you suspect I am getting personal here. I am not attempting to be, but I am hindered by the very nature of this discussion itself. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Since coming to Joe's defence I have had a sudden surge of disturbing e-mails.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There are motions to turn the tap off from serious outside contributions. To start a closed forum. Initially this was inviting and encouraging. But there is one thing that does not work for me. I enjoy sharing things I know with my peers, certainly love to learn new things. And don't even mind finding out that I may have been wrong about some things, all of this is exciting for me. Also in the same way I enjoy learning from children, I enjoy learning from beginners. Believe me trying to explain how things are done is one thing, but the question &quot;why&quot; can sometimes be cause to pause. I remember teaching someone on a press and realized that I had not be doing it wrong, but I could have been doing it quicker and easier. That lesson had a payday every time I started my press. Also as with children I have always wondered who brings up who? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So I enjoy, as John will attest to, the spirit of sharing my enthusiasm with people who are new or continue to learn about the industry. (I include myself as one that continues to learn) That is what I enjoy the most. That is the only reason that I began to write into the Typophile Forum in the first place. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So my gut re-action is strongly against a closed forum and have expressed as much. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->By expressing my objections to this new motion I have been faced with an argument that has left me with out answer. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;but Typophiles is a closed forum&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So until that has changed this middle aged &quot;Honky&quot; male punch cutter is out of here. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hrant, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And it seems to me that Mr Giampa's post regarding  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Pascal60.jpg">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Pascal60.jpg</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->on Wednesday, June 25, 2003 - 12:53 am was exactly correct.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pascal, that's not ink trapping!  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gerald Giampa <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

That's why in such a multicultural environment the onus is on people not being so anxious to feel offended. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It's tempting -and maybe often religiously necessary- to apply universality to a group of people, but it can only backfire if it's applied beyond the natural social capacity of that group of people. Instead of making others conform, excercise your ability to adapt. If there should be any universal quality enforced, it should be candor - because <!-- raw HTML omitted -->communication<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is much more important than restraint in solving problems. Don't spend most of your life stopping yourself from doing things that feel right. (I don't [necessarily] mean &quot;you&quot; personally, btw.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>
