  another designer but the numbers were already outlined.\r\n\r\nThe overall letterforms
  of Gill Sans are a close match but they're not perfect. The original numbers are
  a bit wider. And most noticeably, the \"1\" in the original has a slant at the top
  and Gill Sans has a vertical line with no embellishment.\r\n\r\nPlease take a look
  at the attachment and let me know if the original is even Gill Sans at all. The
  original is in white, my additions with Gill Sans MT are on the inside in gray."

  body: "it does seem like Gill Sans to me. I don't see any discernable difference
    between the Monotype, Adobe and Linotype versions. Gill Sans Display does have
    a tail for the 1. might be a mix, or using some alternate characters.\r\n\r\ni
    also see that the 0 seems different in the original at the bottom. strange."

  body: Thanks! I checked Gill Sans Display and although the "1" does have a tail,
    it's shorter. After looking at many, many options and repeatedly stumping What
    The Font and WhatFontIs I'm pretty sure it's a mix of similar Humanist typefaces
    or uses some customization.

  body: "Indeed, I checked another file and found the number \"180\" in non-outlined
    type.\r\n\r\nThe \"1\" is Frutiger (Linotype), the \"80\" is Gill Sans Std.\r\n"
