  body: "Judging from the apparent age of the sample, it might be safe to guess this
    is pre-digital work. The C and Y are not like the typical initials from most formal
    scripts, so I suspect something custom lettered for better readability. I have
    not been able to find a match in any of my font or type books yet. I am about
    to look at some Photo-Lettering catalogs.\r\n\r\nDo you know how old this lettering
    sample is?\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"

  body: "The closest I can find in the Photo-Lettering books is something called Cumberland
    Script, whose lower case matches fairly well, with the non-looping ascenders,
    but which has slightly more ornate initials (more curls at the terminals).\r\n\r\nI
    think this was probably custom lettering done for Chesterfield cigarettes, for
    complimentary matchbooks. This sort of lettering was the daily work of many lettering
    artists until Photo type came along, and even the Photo type was made from their
    hand-drawn samples.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
