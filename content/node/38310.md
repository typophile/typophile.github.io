  on how to create logos and type in Illustrator. Can anybody recommend one that has
  a focus on logo or type design. That would be great. Thanks."

    is the best book that I have personally seen. I just bought it and wished I'd
    had this 10 years ago. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Logo-Font-Lettering-Bible-Comprehensive/dp/1581804369\r\n\r\nIf
    anyone has any other recommendations, I'd be just as interested. I'm always looking
    for good books.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Adobe Press's <em>Classroom in a Book</em> series is always a good investment,
    but their <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/training/books/illustrator.html\">Illustrator
    book</a> does not focus exclusively on type or logos.\r\n\r\nLeslie Cabarga has
    a new book called <a href=\"http://www.fwbookstore.com/product/1619/how\"><em>The
    Secret Life of Logos</em></a>, but I think it is more about designing a good logo
    rather than how to draw one in Illustrator."

  body: "Heavens no! I am not the author of that great book... and I think some of
    that info in my profile is already needing updated, I'm no longer in Warsaw. :-)\r\n\r\nI
    may have sounded like a commercial in my initial post, or worse, some gushing
    fanboy. Truth is, I was really impressed with the book, and so I'm just praising
    it. Note that the book is not only based on designing logos with Illustrator.
    There is a lot of history and how to solve logo design problems. I enjoyed it.
    The Illustrator based content is towards the end of the book, but it, in my opinion,
    is among the best direction I've ever seen. You can preview the book at Amazon
    to get a feel for the content.\r\n\r\nIn truth, I someday would like to write
    a book of the same caliber on creating great logo designs. But that is later down
    the road. My first plans are going to be taking the custom work that I've done
    and making fonts from them.\r\n\r\nAlso, I did order <strong>The Secret Life of
    Logos</strong>. It should arrive sometime soon and I will post my impressions
    of it."

  body: "> I ordered Cabarga\u2019s book on Thursday, received it on Friday \r\n\r\nYou're
    lucky, I ordered directly from Leslie, and while I got an autographed copy, I
    had to wait three weeks. Not Leslie's fault ... it was held up at customs, where
    they charged me 2.36 customs (and a five dollar fee on top). And I thought we
    had free trade with the US.\r\n\r\nThe money doesn't bother me, it is the time.
    I just wish those guys at customs could read faster."

    received it on Friday and have already finished half of it. It pretty much combines
    everything I ever wanted to know about typography and logo design; it really is
    a great book, so thanks for telling me. \r\n\r\nIf there's any other book on this
    topic that you can recommend, please let me know. I'm gonna buy it straightaway!\r\n\r\n@mjpatrick:
