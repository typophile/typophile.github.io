  body: But aren't they there? Here are the Neo Tech Regular gylphs as they show in
    my InDesign. I don't know French very well, so I don't know what's missing.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/neotech_reg.jpg]

    isn't, S\xE9bastien, just as it wouldn't be ethical for someone to copy the identity
    you're designing for that trade fair and selling it to the client behind your
    back.\r\n\r\nFurthermore you can use the preview function on websites like <a
    href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&startrow=1&records=&currpage=1&totalrecords=24&displayfontid=C.117387.0.0&fontRendererText=Habitat+%26+%C3%89nergie\"
    target=\"new\">FontShop.com</a> to generate a proposal, but if you end up using
    the typeface you still have to purchase a license.\r\n\r\nDon't do anything you
    might regret afterwards, and try no to forget that type designers need an income
    to live as well. Thank you for understanding."

    to set these two words in Neo so my client could have an idea of what it's going
    to look like.  There isn't much I can do with that pdf but use it to convince
    my client to buy a license.\r\nI can see why my request could be a problem on
    the other hand I am only trying to get the finance to buy the font"

  body: Yves, what is unethical about someone who has a legitimate license for Neo
    tech providing Sebastien with a PDF of those two words or, for that matter, any
    other text? If I own a license to a font, I can use it in any way that the license
    permits, and that generally includes setting text either for myself or a client,
    for a fee or gratis. Unless the license specifically prohibits embedding in PDF
    files, I don't see anything wrong with what Sebastien is asking for. He is not
    asking for a copy of the font. He is asking for someone to do a spot of typesetting
    for him.

    to good business: if the person makes too many requests from somebody who has
    the font, it will more likely lead to a purchase of the font. If you prevent this
    sort of thing, the person will either buy nothing or another font.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
