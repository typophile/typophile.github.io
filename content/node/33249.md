    non-English pronunciation (like Oo-knee-VAIR for "Univers").'

  body: "<a href=\"http://www.behindthename.com/php/view.php?name=caecilia\">Behind
    the Name</a> says it's the German form of Cecelia. A search doesn't turn up much
    of interest, but it appears in a lot of German pages with the spelling \"C\xE4celia\"
    so I guess it would be like \"zezelia\" or something.\r\n\r\nNote: At some point
    German started using \"\xE4\" for the digraph \"ae\" (when it represents a single
    sound), so Latin words and names, like Caecelia, that were borrowed before that
    time also sometimes ended up with \"\xE4\" (though many names didn't change)."
