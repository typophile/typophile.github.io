  body: "For TrueType fonts, look in the &lt;glyf&gt; table, each &lt;TTGlyph&gt;
    element contains the point coordinates for that glyph's contours.\r\n<code>\r\n&lt;glyf&gt;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;TTGlyph
    ... &gt;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;contour&gt;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;pt
    ... /&gt;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;pt ... /&gt;\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nIn
    CFF OpenType fonts, the outline data is represented as PostScript code contained
    within &lt;CharString&gt; elements, which can be found in the &lt;CFF&gt; table.
    Unfortunately, determining point coordinates from the charstrings is not so straightforward
    unless you're fluent in PostScript."
