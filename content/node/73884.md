  body: "Hi!\r\n\r\nThanks for your quick reply!\r\n\r\nI don't think it's handwritten
    - because they used the font also for sublines like \"Classics\" (http://myfonts-wtf.s3.amazonaws.com/5a/5ae20adf612cd71d74dd50dcd4a2491c.14391.png
    - all \"s\" are the same).\r\n\r\nMy picture is a scan from a poster - i deleted
    the background-image and this could be the reason for the different \"a\"s :-)\r\n\r\nBut
    the \"M\"s, \"i\"s and \"g\"s aren't different :-)\r\n\r\nThanks for trying!"
