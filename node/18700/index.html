  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I know "readiblity" is a very common topic, but I was wondering about this specific issue: is ANY "slant" going to hurt readability in blocks of body text? Roman always seems based on a strict vertical orientation, with a strict horizontal, perpendicular base. I'm not talking about "italics" so much as subtler variations between roman and ital. Any thoughts?</div>

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">CLARIFICATION! I don't mean to suggest that all roman fonts are strictly "vertical" in terms of their strokes, bowls, etc. I mean in terms of the overall perpendicularity to the baseline. Variations of thick-thin along a diagonal axis is, of course, a property of plenty of otherwise vertical, roman typefaces. I'm referring to those that are slightly off that perpendicular, without looking italic or wackily slanted. I suppose I need an example of what the hell I'm jibbering about.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">From the title of this thread I thought this was about
Chinese, and I'd started working up a reply in my head!  :-)

There are two reasons to think that slant harms readability:
1) People aren't used to it (in long stretches).
2) It distorts the boumas readers expect, for example by confusingly offsetting the ascenders and descenders in bouma silhouettes. Our Peter E might be able to throw one of his image-processing algorithms at this and come up with interesting insights (although he's actually not a silhouette fan for one thing).

Fonts with less slant presumably suffer less, although they can have another problem: especially at small sizes and/or bad output conditions, the difference between Roman and Italic can fade. BTW, this is why the so-called "upright Italic" style can't work as an Italic (which is why I prefer calling it "cursive Roman").

Some notable slightly-slanted Romans:
Syntax (1/2 degree)
Rialto (1 degree)
Seria (variable, ~1 degree)
Flora (~2 degrees?)

In Nour&Patria, the slant (in Nour's Armenian and subordinate Latin, and its Latin italic) is 1/16*, which is about 3.6 degrees. This seems to be the least slant one can safely have (in a text face). I think it's safe enough that Nour's subordinate Latin (codenamed Harrier)** can be used for setting a (short) book.

* In digital fonts I think it makes more sense to use integer slopes
instead of degrees. The latter is a pretty arbitrary measure, while
the former allows easy control over slope segments.

Assuming his empirical methods (or to be fair, anybody's) are good enough.
They don't seem to be (although still, "he's our only hope").

BTW, I think Randy is working quite seriously on semi-serifs too.
They rule.

		<div class="commentbody">THanks for the examples, hrant. Isn't the very idea of the "bouma" debatable, though? My sense is that the debates is that either (a) we recognize word-outline shapes at first pass, then further refine cognitively, or that (b) we parallel-process individual letters in groups at first pass, then further refine cognitively. I guess the result is kind of the same, and might even perhaps be hypotheses that predict much the same reading behaviors, but strictly-speaking they are different cognitive-perceptual animals, right? Frankly, I don't believe much in boumas; I prefer (b). But that's just me.</div>

Of course.

One thing though: boumas aren't necessarily whole words. Essentially they're letter clusters, deciphered as wholes thanks to frequency, distinctiveness, the experience of the reader, the semantic context of the text, the clarity with which it's seen (how close to the fixation point*) and yes, word boundaries as well.

* In fact the decipherment of single letters -which is indeed the norm in the fovea- can be seen as a special case of bouma decipherment. But the more experienced the reader (to me the prime target of improving readability, because the rest is mostly just legibility, a different -and simpler, if only pragmatically- problem) the more important the -blurry- parafovea is.

> I don’t believe much in boumas

Well then you owe yourself another explanation as to why
serifs and good letterspacing (just to name 2 things) matter.

BTW, if you haven't already, you might get
yourself a copy of issue #13 of TYPO magazine,
where three rival viewpoints are presented.

		<div class="commentbody">I will check out the TYPO stuff, hrant. My initial response, though I know I need to investigate further: 

"serifs"-- yes, they make each letter different from every other in more ways than the same letter in a sans-serif font. I.e., more transformations from letter to letter, even among similarly-shaped letters. But why can't this be explained equally well by parallel-processing of individual letters vs. a bouma model?

and as for "good letterspacing," well, I just don't see how this does any more than distinguish one unprocessed clump of stuff from another. It actually has nothing to do with the shape of each word, but just the division space between. 

and, bouma-tastically:

how do you process

   hrant

different from

   lmemk

yes-- there are indeed word outline differences, but arent the real KEY differences in h vs. l, r vs m, a vs. e, n vs. m, and t vs. k?

Anyway, just playing with ideas here. I love this stuff. And I usually find that pushing the devil's advocate is one way to learn. I was a philosophy major-- hard for me to make ANY general claims about ANYTHING. Just meaningless neutrons in the void.</div>

You're talking about the deliberative (or at least foveal) aspect of

Agreed. I always get this when designing an italic then switching back to the roman, it looks really odd and throws me for a second!

I guess the only way for you to test this is to do it. Download a novel from the Gutenburg Project, set it in a few different typefaces, some with slant, some without, and read them. See what happens!

Well, guess what one possible solution is: a roman with a slight slant!  :-)
And the only people who'll think it's a mistake (at text sizes) are type
amateurs with loupes. Yelling isn't the only way to communicate,
and subtlety is a cornerstone of <cite>text</cite> face design.

I thought that Fairfield, with its caption and italic styles, might solve the problem, but it really needs a different angle as a extra differentiator between the two "italic" styles. So I put together this demonstration: the normal Worldwide Italic has about a 10 degree angle, whereas Albany Italic is 20 degrees, and has large "pot-hook" serifs. I inserted Times Italic "i" in to the Worldwide Italic -- the horizontal intro serif further serves to differentiate the two italic styles. So far as I know, there are no typefaces that utilize this concept.

I've been a fan of multiple italics for a while now,
but in applying the idea I decided to go one step
further and vary "mood" instead of angle, resulting
in the Daam Entity fonts. But those are for display.

In terms of "proper" multiple italics, those have been done
now and again during the 20th century, but always sort of
as an afterthought or a correction. It's only recently, thanks
to Underware, that we've seen an unapologetic application of
the idea. So it has indeed been done, but at least not by Goudy's
pesky "old folk".  :-)

In theory, and Underware does mention it, Auto's two italics could be used in contrast to one another, but that's not shown in the PDF specimen, and I don't think there is enough contrast for it to work. It's primarily the similar amount of slant that mitigates against it. So I really do think that the contrast between two italic styles would have to be maxed, including different angles as well as serif/whatever structure, to make it work. That's why I gravitated to showing a pot-hook modern in my experiment, because of its extreme slant and features.

Maybe a better example is Seria, which has an Italic (actually a cursive-Roman) and a Cursive; and although the latter was released after the former* it does benefit from being originally planned (AFAIK).

"Meaning"... those sound like example of arbitrary typographic conventions. Italics does, though, convey something like "emphasis" (at least in an impressionistic sense), if you have any <em>idea</em> what the <em>hell</em> I'm trying to say. :-)

Then again, those are arbitrary conventions, too. Except that the forward "thrust" at least mimics the forward thrust of breath when we HEM-phasize our words.

Also, just to run with this a bit: titles of books, in traditional, Western (American?) texts like books are <em>often</em> but not <em> always</em> italicized. In newspapers, magazines, etc., you see single or double quotes around those exact same kinds of titles.

And there's a historical dimension, too-- note all the wacky uses of italics and caps in early American (i.e., British colonial) writing that persisted up through the early 20th c.

For the kind of setting where an all-italics sidebar produces a few words of emphasis in roman, that's usually at the behest of by-the-book editors following style guides. I guess it boils down to who has the final cut, the editor or the typographer. If it's the editor, they will likely go with "arbitrary" convention. However, typographers are free to come up with new forms of emphasis: one that's gained status seems to be switching from serif to sans for URLs and code. </div>

Much easier in the old days, from the writer's perspective anyway: type it up on the ol' typewriter, double-space it, underline stuff you want in itals. Then, I guess the typesetters and editors hash it out from there...

And then there's LaTex. It really "wows" at first, and it does help people get their equations formatted for small journal presses and the like. And Knuth certainly is a major genius. But it renders the whole art of typography kind of void of meaning, unless you're an uber-geek who can tame it to do what you really want.

I sympathize, even if I'm propped in an ivory tower (well, around here, it's more like a crumbling concrete tower...). I'm an artist by nature (and by a very small amount of training).

In other words, try to think of the whole word as a pattern of whites (counters, inter-letter spaces) and blacks (stems, bowls, diagonals) whose visual integrity as a unit is more overpowering than the identity of the component parts.

This makes visual wordform resolution a special case of direct pattern recognition (perceptual, white + black based), not a case of letter-recognition mediated word-identity computation. (In the later scenario the letter recognition part is perceptual, and black-specific, the computation part post-perceptual. This route is less direct.)[img:sites/default/files/old-images/][img:sites/default/files/old-images/][img:sites/default/files/old-images/]</div>

Bah! Humbug! Ok, ok. Yes, I see the perceptual point. But sooner or later it just becomes a matter of semantics-- are you seeing a "chicken" or "undifferentiated chicken parts"? If my eyeballs are taking in not a silhouette or outline  but the entire pattern of whatever atomistic elements make up units of vision, and my brain is sorting those into a "word pattern," then I just don't see how this is different in any substantive way from saying that the eyeballs are taking in a collection of "letter patterns," each letter of which is built from the same elemental units, and then my brain is processing these in parallel.

Obviously, I don't think it's completely either/or. But I just cannot buy this idea that we see words as NOTHING BUT unitary Gestalts not composed of smaller components. "Shapes" exist in perceptual hierarchies-- they may be constituted of smaller component shapes, and they exist in fields of shapes within which they find themselves, via our perceptions, becoming components of larger shapes.

I mean, if "the bouma" is so "real," why both designing type-faces? why not "word fonts"? The closest we get are ligatures and logos.

The different schemes predict different processing routines at the neuroanatomical and visual cortex level, and because of that make different predictions about what's important at the level of type design and typography, and why. For instance, Kevin Larson predicts wider interletter spacing is better; I predict a rhythmic spacing which frustrates letter recognition is better; I am unclear where Hrant stands: tighter than rhythmic?

If you want to push beyond intuitive and ad hoc judgements about readability and verticality, no matter how craft-based your intuitions might be, you're going to have to go there. Most type-involved people are sufficiently confident about their intuitions and the craft knowledge of the ages to not want to or need to. Going there is like entering a labyrinth.

I happen to be interested in all this because I want to see if craft knowledge has a robust 'perceptual processing in reading' foundation or if it's foundation is cultural historical precedence or personal aesthetic preference.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/]</div>

Gestalts <em>are</em> composed of smaller components, but perceptual processing optimized for reading is not just climbing the perceptual hierarchies. Perceptual processing seeks shortcuts, so that sense or a meaning becomes directly embedded in the sensible whole, without having to chomp through the letter-route produced phonological computational and orthographic computational noise.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/]</div>

Bingo.

But there are two good reasons to make individual letters:
1) It's easier, both in terms of manpower and technology.
2) You always still need the individual letters.

On the other hand, with OpenType, and with some sophisticated
linguistic analysis, a font could very well ramp up readability
by intelligently varying glyphs depending on context.

> I am unclear where Hrant stands: tighter than rhythmic?

How could I, when I don't think rhythm exists (during immersion)?

But if you're asking exactly how tight I think things should be,
I have to say I really can't know until we have some truly good
empirical testing. All I know is that it matters that it's tight.

> Perceptual processing seeks shortcuts

Yes, this is key.
And what's missing from Larson's entirely too
algorithmic (as opposed to heuristic) model.

In the immersive reading of the experienced motivated reader, what is 'sharp-rendered' in foveation? Just the fixated letter or the parafoveally pre-indexed whole now filling the attentional window? Why should breaking the whole up be the norm in the fovea when breaking it up is inhibited by cross-letter binding in tight spacing?

Because the results are qualitatively more reliable. Why do you think we never regress back to text that's been directly foveated? Since the information is there all crisply, and the brain is powerful enough, there's no reason to rely on the fuzzier (more error-prone) lower frequencies, because no speed is gained. One great thing about this is that it fully assimilates Larson's model - gobbles it up.

A good test of this though would be to see if we miss typos that are foveated.
And if we do, can that not instead be attributed to <cite>letterwise legibility</cite> issues.

"In other words, try to think of the whole word as a pattern of whites (counters, inter-letter spaces) and blacks (stems, bowls, diagonals) whose visual integrity as a unit is more overpowering than the identity of the component parts."

Yeah! But not quite.  

I've read Kevin's first stuft now, in partiuclar the studeis he builbs on. 
It's very interesting how so many simple studies can all point to one and only one thing, de Bouma. But when you add "as a pattern of whites (counters, inter-letter spaces) and blacks," you miss, "and a pattern of thicks and thins in intersection along the x ht.", which is what defines that subtle zone,  along with the extrudings, so that we can get "that word(s)" and go on. 

The question(z) I have for the Bouma Maker Masters are: if you demote the "letter-by-letter" and "words-by-words" approach to "nyet" how come you can not compress this text by 50% and still "have a good time", much less improve speed with shorter boumi to zippo thruo?, How do Germans "Do It"?, How do our new words come easy? (both the new ones we Learn, and the new 1s we Make)? and what is a child in this theory, and when does it become Boumawara?

No myne companioneres, they cannot answer these reading questions unless there is a multiple function planetary mechanism at work. Reading is not just one method. . .even within a language, even across the languages of a script, and especially, not across the scripts of the world. And as such it is not likely to be "addressed" for the screen by "one thing" attractive as that may seem. Apple is small market, they can and did pufffft and patoey in the OS display. Even on the Mac though, I can, through de vizardry of digital outline and know-how, get what I want. But Windows, is a huge market, billion o users, and these people are demanding of options, and ain't sew sofistigated. 

So, de Emperor's new question is — why? why do we have a long and costly set of experamints, and marketing, and videos, and specialty fonts, and all zee other choices are pufffft and patoey, 4 All users, globularly and globally?</div>

But my question about 'sharp-rendering' still applies: what is sharp-rendered in the regressive saccade? Just the fixated letter or the previously skipped whole now filling the attentional window? Why should breaking the whole up be the norm in the foveation of skipped boumas when breaking it up is inhibited by cross-letter binding in tight spacing, especially if the word is familiar, like skipped words typically are?

Yes, that would be "emphasis", but I don't think that emphasis is what is generally meant by switching to italic for a few words. Emphasis is metaphorically a change in volume (more ink, more decibels), whereas italic indicates a change in tonality -- another voice, or a different category of name. For instance, "in a study published last year in the journal <em>Antiquity,</em> Hunt, Lipo and Britton Shepardson of the University of Hawaii concluded..." Here, italicization disambiguates, or at the very least eases the traffic jam of a string of proper names. 

Conventions become established because they work. An example is celebrity boldface -- blatantly judicious(!) and therefore entirely appropriate for the "coding" it signifies.

I did mispeak in saying something like Gestalts are themselves atomistic; they form out of elements. Rudolf Arnheim 101. I get that.

Nevertheless, I think what it comes down to is what, if any, self-consciously scientific explanation of the neuroanatomy of visual perception one happens to buy into, whether because one is just muddling along and saying "Hmm, X makes more sense to me that Y explanation," or because one is a neuroanatomist or cognitive pscyhologist or whatever and has a career staked on the establishment of one "view" (boo!) or another.

The thing I object to is this idea that somehow when people read-- even when they read quickly-- they somehow, it seems that some of you are saying, don't really "see" individual letters!  I still think, and maybe am a fool to, that Jay, Joy, and Jap, are three different things, and I doubt except when very fatigued or when MISTYPING (which is a whole other barrel of monkey), that I would ever sort of "blur" them perceptuo-cognitively. And they appear different because I am processing the individual parts ALONG WITH the whole, perhaps. 

Nevertheless, there's no end of intriguing questions at this intersection of skew, bouma, and fovea.

And this is really interesting:

I must be missing something, but: you know
that Kevin doesn't believe in da Bouma, right?

Anyway: the "simple studies" (and simple they are) don't point directly to boumas, because they can't. But they do fill in a lot of holes, and it  is the coupling of this to two other key things -faith in anecdotal experience, and beliefs about how the mind works- that paint the complete picture, with da Bouma in the center. If you can get a hold of issue #13 of TYPO, that's the least incoherent I've been about this; and if you can't, I would gladly send you a copy of it.

> how come you can not compress this text by 50%

Because one of the prime ways a bouma is deciphered is width, and too much compression reduces the absolute width differences. Another reason is that foveal/legibility decipherment probably gets hit too.

> How do Germans “Do It”?

I posit more slowly (since they have too-few word spaces).

By coming out of immersion and doing letterwise, in fact <cite>sequential letterwise</cite> decipherment and compilation. This is also how kids/forinurs learn to read.

No? I think I'm doing fine.

Different thread.  :-)
But it's probable that our reasons vary.
For one thing, I've yet to see any green...

What's "sufficient"? Parafoveal bouma decipherment is always
at the edge of certainty - it would be self-defeatingly inefficient
if it were too certain. So "sufficient" here simply means highly
probable; while there's no need for such heuristics in the fovea.

Not skipped, but misread.

?!

But in any case, I don't think users are so set in stone when
it comes to learning "codes". And hey, aren't you the one who
always says familiarity is highly dynamic? (And I agree.)

As for the fact that italics are used for different types of things:
1) Is that actually good? Maybe a better code than what we generally
use would be to use weight for emphasis and italics for the other stuff.
2) There are always quotes. Or better, guillemets.

Nope. It's our killer heuristics compensating for the 2/3-rds of the visual field you're talking about being too blurry to make out individual letters. The fovea is only about 3-4 characters wide (at the typical point sizes and reading distance).

When a visual wordform resolutional event happens, we are connected with it in it's particularity, object-like-ness and letteredness and we see it momentarily sharply, in detail and in focus (and then move on), but if we compare the time it takes to resolve a word in immersive reading to identifying a letter within a known word or a letter in a non-word at a cued location the letter identifying task looses the race. A letter alone is even faster.

Hrant: "Are regressive saccades always to a skipped word or bouma? [me] Not skipped, but misread. [you]"

What a minute! You asked: "Why do you think we never regress back to text that’s been directly foveated?" Where is the misreading happening? If it is in the parafovea, and the word hasn't been skipped how isn't it a regress back to text that’s been directly foveated? And what happened in the first foveation to perpetuate the misreading?

Maybe I don't understand your scheme after all, or maybe it contains incoherencies that haven't been resolved.

David, I like your 'you miss' and will think about it further. 

And globally, yes, there is a 'multiple function planetary mechanism' at work. I try mostly to describe how it works in experienced, nor-reading-impaired, motivated adult readers of western alphabetic scripts when they are immersed in text with just a few unfamiliar terms. In specific contexts I would presume an identifiable--if complex--pattern of functioning is followed and the mind doesn't just shoot madly off in all directions.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/][img:sites/default/files/old-images/][img:sites/default/files/old-images/]</div>

How could it hardly matter if most of the "snapshot" is too blurry to

> Where is the misreading happening?

Necessarily in the parafovea, is my point. By "foveated" I mean being made to fall within the fovea. Also, nothing is "skipped"*, although boumas are certainly "assumed" to be certain letter sequences (and that's the point). When it's assumed to be the wrong thing (which I'm saying shouldn't be able to happen in the fovea**) resulting in the sentence not making [enough] sense, we figure_out/remember where the problem was, regress to it, foveate, and resolve for real. What's confusing again?

* Except in "speed reading", which however is not really reading, at least not in any useful sense in the context of type.

** Unless there's a <cite>legibility</cite> issue.

In your scheme, for familiar words:
1) what percentage of words in a typical text are sufficiently recognized parafoveally to not actually require foveation?
2) what percent of parafoveally sufficiently recognized words are actually foveated?
3) if the answer to 2) is "many": why is foveation on them done? is foveation ever redundant or superfluous, or is it always redundant if the bouma is correctly recognized in the parafovea?
4) in parafoveal vision, is sufficient confidence about identity obtained just on the basis of silhoutte and context or is foveation always required to complete the recognitional loop?
I am asking because your pattern of reply makes me think I have an incorrect picture of what you are proposing. It may be that I am misslead by your identification in Typo #13 of parafoveal recognition as the hidden core of reading into thinking that the only role you see for foveal vision is in correcting missreadings, confirming readings when there are confusions caused by grammatical or syntactical oddities, and decoding unfamiliar words. So that optimization of reading performance really amounts to superceeding the foveal bottleneck by making it's contributions redundant.

Are you not conceding the fovea to the proponents of a cognitive scientific misappropriation of the data and then doing an end-run around it that makes it seem that a compensatory mechanism dyslexics use (if Gad Geiger and Jerome Lettvin are correct) is the norm, or at least, that is how your scheme sometimes looks from here.

So Bouma-no-kids.

The odd problem then, is that CT, PS, and Mac OS X system fonts have gone so clearly Boumaphilic, i.e. If you blur the black, and the white is left purely up to rounding, you are giving over to the Bouma, because as the inter-character spacing deteriorates, even by 1/3 or 2/3 of a pixelettica, (by being left up to the machine), the word space becomes the most stable white thing, and the discernment of the word is thrown Boumawaya.

And my point is that's fine, but CT, and these other fuzzers then favor immersive readers, and reading, with the breadth of readers, words, fonts, scripts and screens, not to mention uses, where, i.e. A huge number of uses on screen are one word, in a box -—- not having a mode where the word can be the best it can be (i.e. Where each letter is as good as it can be to the pixel, and each letter is set beside the other with a typographic solution for low resolution adjacency perfection, is odd for anti -bouma types...

Users ought to have three solutions from the rasterizer at all times. Aliased, Greyscale, and "whatever". Founders ought to have the option of not hinting, hinting for aliased use, or hinting for a 1x1 pixel with X levels of grey (preferrably 3), and Whatever can apperntly almost take care of itself. In fact, if the founder cleverly hints his Grey scale fonts, they could be perfect for CT with a production pass that applies the hints to transform the outlie for lighter diagonals and italics, or for some future rasterizer that's 10X in x, and still 1x in y...pink, yellow and green.

The proportion of parafovea span to fovea span

In proportion to the inexperience of the reader.
Or actually: no.

If foveal confirmation was required for everything, saccades would
be about 5 characters. While they can be as much as 15, or more.

As I said above, sufficient confidence is obtained via a combination of things, including: semantic context, silhouette, reader experience, lighting, how deep in the parafovea it's encountered, and blank spaces.

> the only role you see for foveal vision is in correcting missreadings

No, foveal vision takes care of about 1/3-rd of reading, plus regressive corrections. So let's say something like 35-40%. I'm talking about full immersion by an experienced reader.

At the typeface level, optimization of reading performance is best done by making saccades longer, which is done by making boumas easier to decipher, when blurrier.

Not conceding, assimilating. Essentially, trying to make sense.
Because all the data, no matter how crappy, has to make sense.

The typical age at which an English-language
child starts reading boumas is about 10.

four years away from that Average. The rest soon.)

The first pass gets your attention, the second pass clarifies.

I don't think that it is possible to comprehend the extent to which day-to-day living so utterly depends on <strong>pattern recognition</strong>, unless one experiences the here and the now of things without benefit of the ability to apply the process. For those of us of a certain age, with a certain level of recklessness that prompted us to experiment with psychedelic drugs (LSD, to be precise), the fact of a human being's utter and abject dependency on pattern recognition was hammered home when the ability to recognize patterns disappeared, and we were confronted with pure, unfiltered input from all five senses, without the ability to make sense out of that input. A chair is a chair <strong>if</strong> one recognizes the <em>bouma</em> of a chair; otherwise, it is a dance of photons bouncing off a series of connected surfaces, with no apparent shape or purpose.

For readers/writers of non-Arabic and non-Hebrew scripts, "slanted" lettering is no less legible than upright lettering; quite the contrary, it is probably more legible because it reflects the natural slant of handwriting (assuming, of course, a right-handed writer -- jlg: you wouldn't be left-handed, would you?). Clockwise cycloids tracking right underlie natural writing rhythm, and the motive force tracks northeast.</div>

There is in fact the paradox that making individual letters more confusable (by making them blurry and/or run into each other) promotes reliance on (multi-letter) boumas! But of course foveal decipherment sinks.

The revival of blur (more controlled in CT, pretty rampant most elsewhere) is not something I think much of. Especially when glyphs of a letter vary; not to mention when they have purdy colors around them too. Grayscaling is certainly a powerful thing, but at decent onscreen text sizes it still needs to be handmade (except for CT's equalizing power in italics).

BTW, it's notable that the 1-bit (bilevel) bitmap fonts of the past (and still somewhat the present) were hopelessly unreadable because their black was too thin (in the Regular weight). A screen font of normal horizontal and vertical proportions is much better served by going to 2 pixels above about 14-15 PPEM.

Actually, when I designing Mana I realized that having

For some of you this will be part of my old broken record, but for the sake of clarifying certain -often terse- things I've said in this thread (like "research sucketh") let me elaborate: the problem with almost the entire corpus of reading research is that the tests, the subjects, and the environments are not conducive to immersion; this does not prevent people from reading, but it does prevent the exposition of what happens when an experienced reader gets immersed, and hence how type designers can make any difference. In 99% of tests, the subjects are hovering between deliberation and light immersion, so speeds are slow, and things like serifs, the paucity of wordspaces in German, etc. never get a chance to matter.

The worst part is that people relying on such tests to tell them everything they need to know tend to see no reason to believe there might be a dark twin world. But the telltale signs (like the missing of typos, the existence of regressions, the foveal skipping of words*, etc.) should not be ignored, and anecdotal experience (like "use a serif for a long book") should not be shunned. The signs and the experience, coupled to a belief that the subconscious brain is an hyper-efficient heuristic beast, should put the parallel-letterwise reading model firmly in the half-world where it belongs for any objective, non-room-temperature-IQ person.

* Some words being short, frequent and distinctive enough to show up on the radar of even some of the most near-sighted empirical testing.

Now, the results from these tests are not useless - in fact they help to nail down fully half of the reading model; but it's the boring half, or at least the half that type designers can't do much to affect.

For me, the gulf between what science has recently discovered and what typographers know is still too massive to be significant, the science too rudimentary to have any bearing on my work.
And yet a tacit popular assumption exists that there are quantifiable rules for reading (of use to government organizations and universal accessibility) and the science of reading is a mere step away from automating the procedure of type design, like Big Blue trouncing Gary Kasparov.
A more apt comparison is music. Sure, there are formulas for writing hits, but the results aren't for everybody.</div>

And this state of affairs has mainly to do with the modern division of intellectual activity into "disciplines." We've been in an era of "disciplinarity" for so long that we have to invent a new term for what used to be the norm for serious thinkers and inventors: "interdisciplinarity." I mean, think about anyone from Plato to Locke to John Dewey to Suzanne Langer. I doubt any could find a job in a university today as easily as a newly-minted cog-sci PhD reading "research scientist."

Nevertheless, I don't knock empircal researchers in these areas, generally. I was married to one, and I've know a lot. They are a genuinely smart, serious, analytically-sophisticated lot, for the most part. It's not so much their own fault for being so hyper-specialized as it is just a result of 125+ years of "disciplinarity" --- since around the 1860s-70s when American "gentleman scholars" had to move over for the youngbloods who got their PhDs in Germany and came back to set up the first research uni's here. In fact, the immediate backlash of that new trend resulted in the first real "generalist vs. specialist" debates in my own field of rhetoric and communication (see Quarterly Journal of Speech ca. 1914-1920).

What I think we need is more in the way of "interdisciplinary" centers that bring together typophiles-- with their sense of art and history-- and researchers-- with their sense of controlled experimentation, operationalization of fuzzy-headed notions, etc. I bet this already exists in the Netherlands, perhaps? (Maybe not-- just guessing-- I've been there twice and am just stunned by how freakin' hip they are to all this stuff).

You are right about the need for interdisciplinary centers. Cognitive scientists, even cognitive neuro-scientists exploring reading, are generally under-aware of the fine mechanics of perceptual processing, to name just one example. And hardly anyone in the world of reading science sees the white of the word as information in the way type-oriented people do. Most also don't see the problems with 'representationalist' accounts, even at the neurological level--problems which the later Wittgenstein and existential phenomenology have alerted us to.

Hrant, the problem you describe is called the ecological validity problem. There is a fair amount of talk among researchers about it and 'generalizability.' 

The interesting thing about the boring half, by the way, is that <em>in immersive reading</em> processing relative to material in the foveal area probably <em>doesn't</em> follow the rules supposedly supported by ecologically problematic tests. You seem to think it does.

Nick: What I see in my delving into the fields that have a bearing on perceptual processing in reading are tantalizing prospects for developing an understanding of reading congruent with the craft attunements of the type-obssessed.

Certainly one doesn't need science to make money in type. But nonetheless I myself am a strong proponent of relying on science. As much as I agree that strict quantification is a pipe dream (or a pipe nightmare) there's a lot of good soil between that and looking the other way.

Exactly! I tend to call it "Old Science"; like what the Ancient Greeks did: figure stuff out with sticks and rocks. These days the brute power of the computer tends to relieve scientists from <cite>thinking</cite>.

You can't blanket like that. This one certainly does. In fact I would say that a "good" designer (I'm not talking about artists) inherently does that.

What you're talking about applies essentially to Style - to display type.

With all due respect (and I certainly wouldn't say your motivation was the next-level look), I'm not aware that you have "developed your product" in a scientific manner -- on a par with the kind of lab testing that has gone into producing the knowledge against which you position your designs. 

James Montalbano has been the most rigoorous in this respect, fine-tuning Clearview with driver testing.

Legato is a theory-driven design, but whether it actually works according to its own criteria has not been proven or even tested, as far as I am aware. I would say it works as a typeface because Evert Bloemsma was a virtuoso craftsman, subtle of hand and eye.</div>

Critically, it probably can't ever be. So then what do you do? You do it anyway.
And you don't call it "post-rationalization", but something much more worthwhile.

		<div class="commentbody">An analogy that might be useful here-- think about herbal medicine. 5000 years of traditional trial-and-error, distilled into a detailed and generally accurate form of "wisdom" about herbal remedies, is good enough for a lot of people. But others prefer blind, controlled experimentation, in the model of modern hypothesis testing. What is the point of saying the former is "folk" and thereby "not science" while the other is "really science"? The only point is to control what counts as knowledge in a certain kind of market economy. 

But the interesting thing to me is, after a while, people who are "real science" chauvinists sometimes come around to say, hey, these aren't mutually exclusive territories here. The National Institute of Health in the U.S., for example, now has a large and highly-regarded <a href="http://nccam.nih.gov/" target="_blank">department for examining traditional medicine</a>.

Granted, this is still a kind of absorbtion or co-optation of "traditional" by "modern," but at least it bespeaks an attempt to build a bridge.

The relevance to typography seems obvious to me: it's not art VERSUS science, or tradition VERSUS modern, or intuitive VERSUS quantifiable. The wisdom of what Donald Schon calls the "reflective practitioner" actually MUST be build on syntheses of these. No amount of basic-science knowledge in a specific field will ensure you make good <em>decisions</em> as a lawyer, teacher, designer, etc.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi, I'm very late to the party, but I'll respond to some early questions in this thread.

There have been several studies that compared one or more Roman fonts to one or more italic fonts. Every study I’ve seen has shown that people read 3-5% faster or more accurately with Roman fonts (including a few I’ve run). I haven’t seen any comparisons between Roman and non-italic slanted fonts.

Even though every study I’ve seen says Roman fonts perform better than italic, I would be cautious in generalizing past the fonts that have been tested. It’s not clear to me what would make Roman fonts more readable, and it may well be possible to make a readable italic if someone were to make that a focus.

Here’s a reference to an early Tinker and Patterson study showing a Roman advantage:
Tinker, M.A. & Patterson, D.G. (1928). Influence of Type Form on Speed of Reading. Journal of Applied Psychology, 12, 359-368.

Here’s a reference to some studies looking at on screen fonts including italics as a variable:
Gugerty, L., Tyrrell, R. A., Aten, T. R. & Edmonds, K. A. (2004). The effects of subpixel addressing on users’ performance and preferences during reading-related tasks. ACM Transactions on Applied Perception, 1(2), 81-101.

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, people make regressive fixations to previously fixated words.

I quote from Keith Rayner's excellent paper "20 Years of Eye Movements". From the section titled What Causes Regressions?:

Readers are much more likely to regress to a word on the current line than to words on previous lines. However, when they do regress further back in tect, although there are sometimes backtracking movements readers often have fairly good spatial memories for where they went wrong in comprehension and make fairly accurate saccades to that region of text. Frazier and Rayner (1982) also demonstrated that when readers encountered a word indicating that their prior interpretation of the sentence was in error, they often made a regression as soon as they encountered disambiguating information. It is likely that many regressions are due to comprehension failures. However, many regressions are very short saccades and are probably due to oculomotor errors.

That doesn't follow. Kevin indicates that fixation regressions happen when the reader realises that a sentence doesn't make sense and that a previous word must have been misread. The parallel letter recognition model as explained by Kevin at the Vancouver ATypI conference and in subsequent publications involves a feedback and efficiency process by which letters recognition is key to word recognition but possible word identity is 'guessed at' during the process. So the identity of a word might be guessed at before all the letters are identified, and the reader might move on to the next fixation. The speed benefits of this feedback and efficiency process are obvious, but sometimes the reader guesses incorrectly, realises this at a later fixation what the content doesn't make sense, and regresses to correct the misidentification.

What I find interesting in this kind of regression is the idea that we might have flagged the misidentified word, in order to know where to regress to if necessary. That is, the brain might log a word as being 90% certain that it has been correctly identified, and if the subsequent content does not make sense, a regression to that word is triggered. If the subsequent content does make sense, then the flag is cleared. I can conceive of a test that would indicate whether such regressions are precise in this way, or involve a process of searching, and wonder if any studies have been done in this particular area?</div>

The problem is, if that's true (and it is, if not with that letterwise angle) then why is it not done to parafoveal data? It is.

I do believe this is what happens.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks, Kevin, but does the passage you quoted actually say regressions due to misreadings (that is, regressions that are not the result of occulomotor errors, but of comprehension errors) are to previously <em>fixated</em> words?

And when it does, the fixation often falls on a different point in the word that is the object of the regressive fixation.

John, you highlight 'the speed benefits of this feedback and efficiency process,' (and relative to serial processing the efficiencies are indeed there) but critiques of this kind of scheme suggest there is a problem of 'combinatorial explosion.' At Thessaloniki I mentioned 'computational overload'. For me there is a 'computational overhead' implicit in such a scheme that does not appear to be locatable in functional anatomical terms.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/][img:sites/default/files/old-images/][img:sites/default/files/old-images/][img:sites/default/files/old-images/]</div>

> Is “familiarity” or “custom” not a possible variable in reading experiments?

It certainly is, and virtually no testing of Familiarity has yet been done (at least not in the realm of typography). Which however doesn't mean one can use Familiarity as an escape clause to shun analysis of the human reading "firmware", as both the PoMo and the Chiro schools do. Anyway. The main things we need to discover about Familiarity are how deep, and how fast it is: exactly what is it we become familiar with (letter "skeletons", letter imagess, what) and how much time does it take (seconds, hours, years, what).

> This regression thing? ... Isn’t it so fundamental to reading

Indeed. I used to think that the way to improve reading performance is to reduce regressions; then I realized that regressions are a "natural" part of our heuristics, and if you're not making enough of them it means you're not trying hard enough, i.e. you're wanting to be too certain what letters a bouma is. So regressions are an inherent correction mechanism, not a flaw.

The way to improve reading performance is to make saccades longer. To improve boumas so that a given reader's given heuristic guesswork experience/ability isn't pushed or pulled, but simply empowered to guess boumas deeper into the parafovea.

That's nonsense, and it highlights the peculiar meaning developing for the word "readability".

From the perspective of general usage, "readable" means capable of being read. The bizarre meaning some scientists are pursuing apparently refers to two quite specific qualities, "comprehension' and "speed", as measured over short sections of text in a laboratory, and with a very limited definition of "comprehension". Compare the word "edible" to "readable" -- all food is edible and edibility is not something that can be measured. What can be measured are things like nutritional content and calories; these have nothing to do with palatability or cuisine, another issue again from how fast and how much it's possible to eat. 

Let's not be misled into thinking there is somehow something wrong with type that is not "readable" according to a scientific alteration of the word's meaning, in particular using it in an unqualified manner. In fact, "readability" has absolutely no scientific meaning, so please stop using it, Kevin et al. What you're researching is properly termed reading ergonomics, which is what one would expect at Microsoft Advanced Reading Technology. Yeah, "reading ergonomics" is less contentious, and doesn't it sound more scientific than pirating a word from flakey typographer-speak?

The word "readability" entered the typographic vocabulary as a refinement to the concept of "legibility". It has a general meaning, applicable as much to a page layout as to a typeface. In the hierarchy of page layout, typographic readability applies at every level. Really, it means good typography! In other words, not too loose, too busy, too dense, too regimented, or too "regressive", but just right. And yes, it may be applied to a typeface, but that typeface always has to be set, and will be uniquely effected by the typographic variables.

So what the altered concept of "readability" does is to define good typography in limited, quantifiable terms, with "better" meaning things like "3% faster". 

For the typographer, working at the level of page layout, the main text may be set in roman, and to add interest, a sidebar in italic. Ironic that the "unreadable" italic adds readability to the page! As a leavening of italic is common practice, it's hardly surprising that snatches of italic will be read slower than roman in lab tests, because readers spend the vast majority of their time reading roman. This suggests that the social sciences have more to reveal about this phenomenon than lab tests -- statistical analysis of populations and reading material. That's where the answer to Hrant's "Familiarity" lies. Or else you'd have to construct a desert-island laboratory which isolated and controlled the subjects' reading material for months on end. Or twins, one brought up reading roman, the other italic. Or quads, with added sans/serif split. Clones in alternate Truman Shows. 

At the level of paragraph layout, the full range of typographic nuance comes into effect. To  raise the text from a solid mass of letters, the typographer adjusts the values of leading, paragraph indent, line length, type size, flush/justified, h&j settings, paragraph leading, and type style. Don't forget paper stock and ink colour, or what happens on monitors.

With thousands of typefaces to choose from, and so many different ways to set them, to make a work as "readable" as possible, it's impossible to test all the combinations in a lab, to discount the effect of untested variables. I was discussing news text with a newspaper designer the other day, and he mentioned that in North America, 8.6 pt was the preferred size, but in Europe 8.2 pt (maybe not those exact numbers, but you get the idea).

Another analogy, with music. The same score may be played by different performers, with marked difference in "listenability". 

<em>How would you improve reading performance?</em>

So, hire a typographer.
And for typeface design, someone with a good hand and eye, ideas, and experience.

***

Again, I would suggest taking research out of the lab and into the field.
Philosophically, compare the ergonomics of reading with ergonomics in other areas of design.

Sorry, I broke my new year's resolution not to use the word "readability". In future I'll replace it with "reading ergonomics".

You're talking about the micro stuff, which is great, but my "extend saccades" which you objected to I presented as the mechanical result of any helpful micro stuff, a result that opens the door to higher performance. So my question really was: what mechnical result do you see as being tied to improved reading performance? If not longer saccades, is it shorter fixations? Or maybe fewer regressions? (Assuming we agree that another possible parameter, reading comfort, is actually the same thing as long-haul reading speed in the end - something Kevin and I actually agree on.)

> it highlights the peculiar meaning developing for the word “readability”.

Peculiar? Maybe to somebody who made a New Year's Resolution
not to use the word thinking that was an admirable thing to do.

"Readability" has evolved in meaning not least because some
text face designers need more typographic nuance than the
archetypical Art Director seems to. Style is what's banal.

"How would you improve reading performance?"

For one thing, use type NOT by a designer who is
blind to fully half the spectrum of typeface design...

The nuances I put into text faces aren't measured in reading ergonomics tests.
Why do some typographers and/or readers prefer one version of Century to another?
Is their preference borne out by lab testing for speed and comprehension?
So far, reading ergonomics is a million miles away from nuance.

Hrant, I mostly see lower computation costs in the visual cortex and a more efficient use of attentional resources globally, so that the processing is not fatiguing, the vehicle of sense recedes into the attentional background and attentional resources are freed for cognitive processing or narrative sense-folowing.

That is correct. Some, but not all, regressive saccades are to words that have been previously foveally fixated.

It’s almost impossibly difficult because we would need to find a group of people who had spent just as much time reading with italic fonts as with Roman fonts. The only way I can imagine doing it is to control the typography on everything a child reads from birth.

>>it may well be possible to make a readable italic
>In fact, “readability” has absolutely no scientific meaning, so please stop using it, Kevin et al.
I wasn’t using readable in a scientific sense. When I mean people read faster or with higher accuracy, that is what I will say. My program of research is developing new measures of readability which include speed and comprehension, but also include aesthetic quality, eye fatigue, and mental effort.

Begining readers have an undifferentiated grip on the visual form of words. They don't have 'maximal grip', and a large amount of  attentional resources are used in simple orthographic and phonological decoding. In experience motivated readers the distribution of attentional resources shifts almost completely to sense following.

My view, reflected among other issues in my belief that reducing regressions isn't the point, is that grip depends on experience, and cannot decline due to increased speed, because the former is the determinant while the latter is the result.

Then, if there is no group of people reading italic fonts why would you make a test reading Italic CT vs. Italic Aliased and call it a test? Have you tested children at all? Do you remember Flouride in the drinking water, and what a good idea that was? Do you have any grounding in reality or is it exactly like you said in your paper: interest in applying CT to reading no matter what? :)</div>

The problem in his statement is that it assumes Familiarity is gained over a lifetime. It's not impossible that that's the case, but it's also possible (in fact from what I've read, seen and thought I think it's probable) that Familiarity is gained very quickly, maybe a few days, maybe even a couple of hours*. If this is the case, it becomes quite possible to test for it, factor it in/out, etc.

* Which is absolutely not to say that Familiarity is all that; there are neurological and physiological realities about us that affect/limit reading in particular ways, and no amount of Familiarity can turn us into ethereal, abstract beings.

David, I was responding to your question about the possibility of controling for familiarity. I think the tests that I have described have a lot of external validity because they test readers with typical experiences. There may be reasons to create a group of readers with unusual experiences (your Floride comment?), but there should be a compelling reason to do it. I would love to run more tests with children, the elderly, people with low vision, and dyslexics, and would do so with sufficient time and resources. Tinker and others have studied children and would happily find you some references if you are interested.*

* Tinker, M.A. (1935). Studies in scientific typography for children. Psychological Bulletin, 32, 703.

Hrant, I concur that familiarity may be acquired very quickly. How do we tell when an adequate level of familiarity has been acquired? It is a quibble, but I think anecdotalism is necessary and important for hypothesis generation, but will always choose to believe empirical data when it is available.

There is at least one, which I explained in my TYPO 13 piece: to gauge what might be happening at the "high boundary" of reading, to then base action on; instead of simply trying to nail down the barren, ho-hum average, which only teaches us what that average is. In this case the subjects' "unusual experience" would be one more people could and should be having: long, deep immersion.

> I would love to run more tests with children, the elderly ...

On the contrary, I would encourage you to aim to grasp the -high- mainstream, because that's where the path to improved performance lies, at least for the bulk of readers. On the other hand, I admit that having child reading for example as a contrast would help.

> How do we tell when an adequate level of familiarity has been acquired?

Good question.
Let's think about it.

> will always choose to believe empirical data when it is available.

Only if it's good enough. Is it good enough right now? No way. Can it ever be 100% good enough? I think probably not. Anecdotalism doesn't pass the baton to Empiricism; it's a lot more like a three-legged race :-)
