body: "I'm working on my personal branding and would like some input on the logo that
  I've been developing. I've gone through about 50 variations of this, but am attaching
  the top 5 designs that were narrowed down based on a first round of critique from
  a colleague. The concept is based on a strong personal affinity for modern vintage
  design through the vintage seal/stamp shape and original craftsmanship. This is
  just the basic flat logo that I'll eventually add some slight additional styling
  and perhaps get turned into a physical rubber stamp for promotional print items.
  \r\n\r\nI am seeking preferences for integrating the script typeface monogram which
  gives it the more modern edge versus the more slab typeface.\r\n\r\nThank you!"

  body: "I prefer the upper monogram to the bottom one simply because it balances
    within the circle motif better. \r\n\r\nAs for the seals themselves, I'd opt for
    the upper left for no other reason than it's the simplest, which would make the
    logo the most versatile to use. But they all look good. "

  body: "Welcome to Typophile, Katie. I'd pick A.  \r\n\r\nAbbreviating \"Atlanta\"
    seems a bit odd to me in the A layout. I'd spell it out and maybe delete GA. Everyone
    should know where Atlanta is, and I presume your full address will appear nearby
    anyway.\r\n\r\nThe stars and smaller type may not hold up well when the logo is
    reproduced small. I'd suggest printing it out in tiny sizes and see what happens.
    And you might try simplifying the stars and not putting them at an angle."

  body: "My eye first went to C but rest on A.\r\n\r\nI agree with the comments above,
    but would like to add that whilst the top row KG is more favourable perhaps the
    'G' its self could be opened up, it's like a 'g' and 'C' got together to create
    that. The bottom row KG has a more striking presence out of the two (on their
    own).\r\n\r\nOverall its well crafted and fine tuned but its screaming US election
    and latest hipster design trend to me.\r\n\r\nI hope that helps Katie. What does
    A look like without the 'stamp' and just the text in red?"

    small will this have to work?\r\n\r\nBTW the rubber stamp is a great idea. Consider
    a wax seal too.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "> How small will this have to work?\r\n\r\nThat's a good question but may
    be hard for her to answer. You can anticipate what size it'll be on your website
    and stationery, but situations may come up later where you have to use it smaller.
    \r\n\r\nLike maybe you want to buy ad space but can only afford a tiny size. Or
    you want some promotional giveaway items but the imprint area is very small (I've
    had clients put their logos on pens). Or a charity event prints a microscopic
    row of logos to thank companies that contributed to the event. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Attaching some revised 3 versions based on feedback above, taking the 2 that
    were mentioned to stand out the most and added one without a background shape.
    Will have to work out the \"tiny size\" issues once I've nailed down the basic
    final design. I'm okay with fitting into the \"hipster trend\" since this is very
    much my style and personality, thus hard to try to be something else :) \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/final-three_5372.png]"

    could we get a close-up of all the circular text? Letterforms can fall apart when
    treated like that.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    I'm still unsure about the 'G' but the tyophiles here will be able to shed more
    light if its a real problem.\r\n\r\nI agree with hrant about the stars.\r\n"
