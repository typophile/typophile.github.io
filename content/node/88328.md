  that AmCap is just an American phenomenon, you couldn't be further from the Truth.
  This collection spans the globe with language support in Cyrillic, Eastern and Western
  Europe languages, Hebrew and Greek. We've included crowd pleasing small caps and
  the Sharp S. If this doesn't start your thoughts springing towards Heroic designs
  there is a mind numbing array of Stylistic Alternates. Sinister design conspiracies
  will be brought to their knees with AmCap's Side Kicks like Eternal and Patrius.
  So for Truth, Freedom, and Excellent Design - American Captain. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AMCAP_520_002_6599.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AMCAP_520_003_5480.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AMCAP_520_004_5413.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n[[http://www.thefontry.com/americancaptain|American
