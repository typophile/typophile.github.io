  type is in image form so I can't see what font is actually used.  I am posting an
  image of the menu bar to see if anyone can help me identify it.\r\n\r\nThanks[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font_5222.jpg]"

    but modified - the bar of the H has been raised, and the U is squared. And no
    wonder you need the font, the word \"SHEDULE\" is misspelled!\r\n\r\nIf you want
    something with a similar flavor but actually good, take a look at <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/mostra/\">Mostra</a>."
