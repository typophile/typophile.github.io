body: "A bit of background: This is the logo for a wedding-related site (\"br\xF6llop\"
  means wedding in swedish). The idea was to create something a bit \"weddingy\",
  but not too formal, more fun. \r\n\r\nThis has been my fist serious attempt at designing
  any lettering \"from scratch\": It's been tough! I'd appreciate any feedback and
  critiques, especially on curves that look weird and the kerning- i'm not really
  sure how to kern a semi-script text."

  body: "It reminds me of [[http://www.vllg.com/Village/GalaxieCassiopeia/|Galaxie
    Cassiopeia]] - that's a good thing.\r\n\r\nIs there a special reason why the beginning
    stroke of the r is so low?"

    stroke... should it be shorter than the end stroke?"

  body: It's cool and I like it. Actually, along with a script font ID a few days
    ago, it makes me want to try making a scripty retro font.
