  for an architectural / nonprofit design build firm called Front Porch. It is based
  in southern Louisiana.\r\n\r\nBasically they want something that is modern and clean
  but also has some kind of southern touch to it. Any suggestions for fonts? \r\n\r\nI've
  been looking at Southern Colonialist by Intellecta, but its just not clean enough
  for what they want\r\n\r\nThanks for your help!"

    a graphic designer, except as a nonprofit, we have absolutely no money. This is
    something we are doing on the side, working with local communities to rebuild
    homes that are still uninhabitable after Hurricane Katrina. The logo isnt even
    that important, as we have no physical presence, office, website, or anything.
    We all do this in our spare time outside our regular jobs. \r\n\r\nThanks for
    the sarcasm Andreas, hope it made you feel better about yourself for the day.

    The US doesn\u2019t really have much in the way of geographic font associations
    aside from people associating the mythical old west with fonts that were actually
    in use all over the country."

  body: "\"modern and clean but also has some kind of southern touch to it\"\r\n\r\nIn
    architectural terms, that seems a bit like asking for something that is mid-century
    modern but also log cabin rustic. \r\n\r\nMaybe stick with modern and clean for
    the type, and consider a secondary element to tie in the regionality (is that
    a word?) of it. An icon or symbol to go with it. Given that you are architects,
    the obvious (if maybe a bit cliche) suggestion would be a sketch of a traditional
    southern covered front porch. "

  body: "I think I agree with aluminum; drop the search for the 'southern' font and
    go with something else that will give an immediate visual trigger for your area.
    \ Maybe not a porch, but a colonnade or portico?  Or maybe an even bigger cliche
    for your particular area: a stylized fleur-de-lis that could get across your group's
    mission?  \r\n\r\nYou could get quite a bit of mileage out of a slightly watermarked
    loose sketch of any of these, and going with that option would give the modern
    look your organization is wanting.\r\n\r\nGood luck!"
