body: 'Here&#39;s an interesting article about the business of branding: how logos
  are taking a backseat to names, which suggests exploiting the right typeface for
  a company&#39;s identity is more crucial than ever for graphic identity and retention
  value: <BR> <BR>Corporations, which have heavily relied on graphic design, logos
  and too many colorful themes while ignoring the real names, are facing some new
  challenges. As the logos have lost their power, the companies now have to reinforce
  their ignored name as a solo warrior. Previously, names were basically seen in print;
  today they are mainly typed in cyberspace. <BR> <BR>Your logo is not that important
  these days, as most customers have no motivation to remember the subtle intricacies
  or bizarre approaches to logos to stimulate a crave. They are already over-flooded
  with colorful graphic look-a-likes and continuously regenerated blasts from every
  corner 24/7. <BR> <BR>Today&#39;s customers are in need of a simple name to follow
  and remember until the next time a need arises. <BR> <BR>Names have replaced logos
  and have dramatically changed the rules of corporate and product branding. <BR>
  <BR>So what good are names if your customers can&#39;t see, hear or speak about
  them, and what good are the products and services if they are invisible? <BR> <BR>What
  is quickly killing big branding is the dramatic impact of e-commerce and how a marketing
  message is delivered to the end user today. Gone are the days of big budget billboards
  and massive blitzes in print with the constant hammering of fancy corporate logos
  supported by extensive graphic treatments as the main selling proposition. <BR>
  <BR>One Single Solution <BR>True, you do need some typeface for your name, and you
  can easily append a circle or a square or a triangle or a combination thereof and
  you can select one, two or several colors to go along. That&#39;s all that logos
  are good for now. The more simple the solution, the better. No need to study six
  months and interview the entire city on whether a circle is better than a square.

  body: Leon, interesting that you stumbled on this article too - I posted a link
    on my site to it on Wednesday - I too found it interesting, and somewhat disappointing.  <BR>
    <BR>Perhaps someone could make a PDF showing how many of the best logos would
    appear if they were simply typed in the source font with default spacing and no
    tweaks by a designer. Send that back to this chap and see what he says.  <BR>
    <BR>FedEx springs to mind as a logo that would fail if it weren&#39;t for the
    mods made by the designer. I&#39;m sure there are other less obvious examples.

    <BR> <BR>Naseem sounds like a gruff old man who doesn&#39;t like how all the cars
    these days don&#39;t have crank handles on their windows, &#39;cause it makes
    kids lazy. <BR> <BR>Or better yet, he sounds like he doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s
