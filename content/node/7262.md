body: Hello <BR> <BR>Like many people on Typophile, I have a collection of old type
  samples, the majority of which are 20&#39;s and 30&#39;s books. I want to reproduce
  some of these pages for a magazine article, and I wondered if anyone knows if I&#39;ll
  need permission to do this.  <BR> <BR>I am not sure if 20&#39;s and 30&#39;s is
  outside of copyright, and as some of the companies no longer exist, I am not sure
  who I could get permission of for a few. <BR> <BR>Any suggestions would be welcome.
  <BR> <BR>Thanks <BR> <BR>Jim

  body: 'Short answer: I think you&#39;re in the clear. Long answer: it&#39;s hard
    to be absolutely sure. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s a fairly authoritative guide to <a
    href="http://www.unc.edu/~unclng/public-d.htm">when works pass into the public
    domain</a> from UNC. Everything published before 1923 is definitely public domain.
    Between 1923 and 1963, the copyright owner had the option of renewing copyright,
    but if not exercised, the work is now in the public domain. It&#39;s not trivial
    to determine whether copyright was renewed &#40;it&#39;s not like there&#39;s
    a searchable list online or anything&#41;, but my guess is that it&#39;s very
    unlikely that specimen books had their copyrights renewed. <BR> <BR>What I would
    do: contact the companies that are still around asking whether copyright was renewed,
    and, if no answer, assume it wasn&#39;t. <BR> <BR>I have a small <a href="http://www.levien.com/type/">archive</a>
    online, mostly scans from ATF books 1912-1943. I&#39;m in the process of moving
    the archive to the <a href="http://www.tug.org/">TUG</a> server, which has graciously
    offered to host the high quality 2400 dpi scans as well as the 200 dpi scans I
    have up now. <BR> <BR>I am not a lawyer, of course. Thank God for small favors!'

    Most of them love publicity, and will say yes to this sort of request in a heart
    beat. <BR> <BR>Here is a list of old foundries and their successors, just off
    of the top of my head. I&#39;m sure that others here can fill in more blanks.
    <BR> <BR>Mergenthaler Linotype, Dr.-Ing Hell, Haas, D&amp;P, Klingspor, and Stempel
    are all now part of Linotype Library GmbH. <BR> <BR>AGFA Monotype is the continuation
    of the various Monotype houses &#40;although Gerald Giampa&#39;s Lanston might
    own exlcusive rights to some of Lanston Monotype&#39;s collection. I don&#39;t
    know any of these details&#41;. AGFA Monotype now owns ITC wholly, as far as I
    know. But you can still contact ITC directly. <BR> <BR>I would direct all questions
    about H. Berthold AG to Berthold Types in Chicago. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know how
    the ATF collection&#39;s rights have been divided up. That has been discussed
    somewhere on Typophile before, though. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve left a ton
    of things out

  body: It&#39;s <i>really</i> complicated and murky, but for the most part the US
    has the longest copyright terms of any nation in the galaxy. For example, the
    copyrights are starting to expire in the UK for Elvis&#39;s recordings, but that
    won&#39;t happen here until something like 2047. <BR> <BR>So for specimen books
    published in the &#39;20s and &#39;30s, I really think it&#39;s all in the clear.
    By all means ask the remnants of the original foundries to make sure, but at the
    same time I wouldn&#39;t let legal questions hold you back from sharing material
    which is rightfully in the public domain.

  body: 'I find myself running into snarly legalish issues quite a bit when it comes
    to fonts. I think it&#39;s important to make clear distinctions between what&#39;s
    legal, ethical, and moral. In happy cases, they all align and there&#39;s no problem.
    But often they don&#39;t, for many reasons. <BR> <BR>To me, the primary moral
    question is: what is the harm? In some cases, it&#39;s clear. A designer who uses
    a font fallen from someone&#39;s hard drive, rather than licensing it, directly
    harms the foundry by not paying the money that they&#39;re legally &#40;and morally&#41;
    entitled to. That, in turn, has other negative consequences, not least of which
    is discouraging font designers by sapping their rewards. <BR> <BR>For what Jim
    is asking, I can&#39;t for the life of me see any harm. Can anyone argue with
    a straight face that Morris Fuller Benton was motivated in part by the fact that,
    after 70 years, ATF&#39;s assets would end up in the hands of some lawyer or other,
    and that copyright law would force people to pay for the privilege of reproducing
    his specimen pages, or more likely that legal fears would suppress that altogether?
    <BR> <BR>I like the kind of ethical solution that&#39;s been adopted by the fansub
    community &#40;fans of Japanese anime who release English subtitled versions on
    the Internet&#41;. Their ethical code calls for <i>not</i> distributing any series
    which is licensed in English-speaking countries. However, before a series is licensed,
    it is considered fair game, even though technically illegal. This helps anime
    producers in all sorts of ways, basically doing market testing for free, and increasing
    the interest in general. One could make the theoretical argument that free fansubs
    compete against DVD purchases, but the incredible growth of popular interest in
    anime belies that.  <BR> <BR>The fansub ethical code works especially well, I
    think, because of the consensus in the community that it is fair and just. You&#39;ll
    experience warm, friendly help if you&#39;re trying to acquire ethical fansubs,
    but if you&#39;re a scammer trying to make money off other people&#39;s work,
    you&#39;re shunned. In the end, everybody benefits, <i>including</i> the Japanese
    creators of the animes, who of course look the other way even thought their copyrights
    are being violated. <BR> <BR>I think the typophile community could do a great
    service by evolving and formulating ethical codes along similar principles. Are
    we capable?'
