  body: Sounds like a pretty pointless remark to me. Doesn&#39;t he elaborate on this?

  body: I find it very helpful for display purposes to have a condensed version &#40;if
    it is a good one&#41; but I would hardly say any sans without one is useless.  Frankly,
    I am not very fond of the condensed version of Futura but I do use the normal
    width version.

  body: 'People like Smeijers aren&#39;t &#34;supposed&#34; to make throwaway comments,
    but most humans are tempted to make dramatic statements now and again. The problem
    is that the faultier one&#39;s ideological basis&#42; &#40;irrespective of how
    &#34;nice&#34; the actual fonts produced happen to be - like I really love Quadraat&#41;
    the more risk that such statments will be absurd. <BR> <BR>&#42; &#34;Why take
    the first step of making something? It must come from an urge to create.&#34;
    Absolutely not. Design &#40;unlike art&#41; must come from an urge to <i>serve</i>.
    <BR> <BR>No condensed = No good? Fred, habeebi, rise to the level of Legato &#40;no
    condensed in sight&#41; and then maybe you&#39;ll realize that a real text face
    &#40;or as texty as a sans can get&#41; actually has no room for horizontal variance:
    the balance is too delicate to throw a wrench into it like that. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: Hrant, I think a typeface should be motivated in equal amounts both by the
    desire to create &#40;something which does not exist yet&#41; and to serve &#40;to
    be used by others while being possibly good and useful&#41;. <BR> <BR>I think
    a condensed is very useful in general design, but surely not indispensable in
    extensive text setting types. It depends largely on the nature of the design,
    anyway. <BR> <BR>Futura Condensed does not make sense to me &#40;related to Futura,
    I mean&#41;. Although is quite usable it drops all the &#34;rationale&#34; which
    could have been in the original Futura completely &#40;and I stress could have
    been&#41;.

    page 137. <BR> <BR>In regards to the expansion of Quadraat in 1997 Fred writes:
    <BR>&#34;A sans without a condensed version is, of course, not really complete&#34;
    <BR> <BR>The differences between &#34;no good&#34; and &#34;not really complete&#34;

  body: Ahh, that&#39;s it Eric. Sorry about the false alarm! <BR>I remembered that
    it said something like that, <BR>but it was early and the book was at home. I  <BR>am
    actually really enjoying the read! But not <BR>as much as I am enjoying Dutch
    Type, which <BR>came in the mail at the same time. Mmmm, beautiful <BR>books make
    me happy! <BR> <BR>

  body: I ordered &#34;Dutch Type&#34; a few weeks ago from 010 Publishers and am
    anxiously awaiting its arrival from accross the pond.  I am wondering if it is
    the same book P. Scot Makela showed me in Camden Maine about 10 years ago? Does
    it have a first published date Kris?  Actually, I wonder what happened to Scot?  He
    quit answering my emails and faxes several years ago. Is he still in Minnesota?
    He was a great guy.  He was the first person to show me both PhotoShop and FOG.

  body: HI Chris. I think the book was published this year. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t really
    want to be the one to tell you, but I <BR>think that Mr Makela died in 1999. My
    sincere regards. <BR> <BR>kris.

    typophile. <BR> <BR>From what RvL told me at TypeCon, Makela contracted a tropical
    disease &#40;having to do with the respiratory system, if I remember correctly&#41;
    and he could have actually been saved if not for a misdiagnosis. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: Scott died of pneumonia, in the end. I was shocked at the time. When I was
    collecting stuff for my &#34;naive&#34; book idea, I talked to Maya Drozdz, which
    had been a student of both Laurie and Scott and I have had a brief mail exchange
    with Laurie, which now has relocated &#40;don&#39;t recall were&#41; with her
    &#40;and Scott&#41; kids and her new husband. <BR> <BR>Laurie had been really
    nice, as I asked her a brief intro for Dead History, but since I stopped the thing
    &#40;which will be very likely reincarnated in a methodic book project some time
    in the future&#41; I have not heard her or Maya, although Maya here and there
    sends me email notice of her projects at <a href="http://www.visualingual.org/"
    target="_blank">http://www.visualingual.org/</a> <BR>Ciao Maya!
