  body: Garamond-esque, but not Garamond.  Look at the K in "Black" - the top diagonal
    meets the bottom well away from the vertical.  I've never seen that in a Garamond.  This
    font also has a serif on the capital U, which Garamond doesn't.

  body: I don't think it's a typeface, rather custom lettering (which was very common
    on book jackets prior to the 1960s).
