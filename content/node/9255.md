  body: 'It&#39;s good to see you&#39;ve done some preliminary reading! The area of
    revivals is a very tricky field to negotiate, in the legal, ethical and even cultural
    realms. Some people Just Say No, and they have a point. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>I
    for one know virtually nothing about any Baltic culture, so I can&#39;t tell if
    Palemonas has any merit in this respect. But I think that even if I did, it&#39;s
    hard to imagine it having any, since this is indeed close to Bembo &#40;more below&#41;
    and I&#39;ve never heard anybody say Bembo had any Batlic -much less specifically
    Lithuanian- affinity! And anyway, it&#39;s very hard to imagine a functional text
    face having such a particular cultural angle. Some Eastern European fonts have
    that, but I think there has to be a lot of non-typographic cultural &#34;support&#34;
    to create such an enabling environment for this; does Lithuania have an overall
    distinctive graphic style, and one that can be expressed in a text font? <BR>
    <BR>As for the closeness to Bembo, although the overall effect is slightly different
    -probably different enough- it does indeed seem that some of the outlines are
    really way too close... My guess is it was a direct derivation from digital Bembo,
    but I could be wrong. Personally, that wouldn&#39;t be so bad if the result was
    highly different &#40;like where people take Garamond and Futura and blend them
    together - there&#39;s no way that font is going to be interchanged for either
    and affect sales or anything&#41;, but in this case I think you&#39;re hunch is
    right: the ethical limit line seems to have been crossed. <BR> <BR>But you know
    what personally bothers me more: the bad craft. The neutered &#34;f&#34;&#42;,
    and splotchy color in the italic, etc. Pretty messy, not professional. Well, at
    least the way I use the term. <BR> <BR>&#42; Was Palemonas perhaps derived from
    a <i>Linotype</i> cut of Bembo? <BR> <BR>hhp'
