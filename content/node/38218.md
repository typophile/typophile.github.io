body: "I want to check an assumption - when you make an Ohorn ( U+01A1, U+01A0 ) it
  is necessary that the 'horn' be joined with the O shape so that the O shape in the
  Ohorn cannot be a component. \r\n\r\n(Although the Ohorn shape can be a component
  of other Unicode glyphs.)\r\n\r\nIs this correct?\r\n\r\nPut another way though
  - I might ask. Will a composed overlapping shape create an unwanted white space
  the way that a temporary ( unconnected but overlapping) leg on an upper case R does?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    I weld (remove overlap) cedillas and ogoneks onto accented characters. Shipping
    a font with diacritics in component form only saves a few kilobytes in font file
    size and adds nothing to the quality of the product.\r\n\r\nMost fonts I've produced
    so far are display types, or semi-display-demi-text, and designers will inevitably
    render them in outline form. As long as your horn glyph, cedilla glyph and ogonek
    glyph exist stand-alone in their own cells with legit unidoce index numbers assigned,
    they can be components of diacritic characters combined on-the-fly by applications---but
    you knew that already.\r\n\r\n<em>Will a composed overlapping shape create an
    unwanted white space the way that a temporary ( unconnected but overlapping) leg

    Type 1 outlines, but for some reason not in TT fonts with TT outlines.\r\n\r\nj
