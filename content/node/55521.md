  Let\u2019s draw a line in the sand and send a message to these evil purveyors of
  type, telling them that we have enough fonts, thank you very much, and perhaps they
  could do something really useful, like invent new colours or wear funny hats. In
  time, and with enough re-training, these poor creatures could become normal members
  of society.</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>\u2026 No longer will they have to suck the ends
  of their pencils, staring into the middle distance, trying to come up with a catchy
  name for their fonts that hasn\u2019t been used before. Bello? C\u2019mon, pal,
  you can do better than that. Chevin? My grandmother could think of a better name
  than this bizarre contraction of Chav and Kevin. Ultura? Refracta? Now you\u2019re
  just making words up.</cite>\r\n\r\nTalk amongst yourselves."

    too. I say, who needs more? Enough is enough. Nothin' new under the sun. Bah,
    humbug!

    the future.\r\n\r\nSeriously, I don't think he's serious. No one is forcing people
    to buy and use new fonts."

  body: "Only just discovered this four year old post. And just for the record, I
    wasn't being <em>entirely</em> serious in my article for Computer Arts, which
    is hopefully obvious from the tone. I love type, love type designers, and have
    even designed around forty commercially available fonts that used to be sold through
    Atomic Type. \r\n \r\nStill, it was fun discovering this little conversation!
