  body: 'I think if that is blur it was reworked. The crossbar of Blur Light&#39;s
    lowercase &#34;e&#34; does not connect as it does in the sample posted above. '

  body: Yeah, and the _t_ is a little bit thicker. <BR> <BR>Perhaps Neville Brody
    reworked it for Sony &#40;?&#41;

  body: Well the &#34;n&#34; is the genuine article, so let&#39;s stick to  <BR>customized
    FF Blur until someone can provide irrefutable  <BR>proof it&#39;s something else.

  body: Oh yes! Actually FF Blur is not exactly the same, my sample is something -
    uhm - taller and wider &#40;argh, sorry for my poor english&#41; Probably Sony
    reworked it... They can&#39;t use a commercial font, of course, they must have
    their own font... But it&#39;s very very similar! <BR>Thank you font Gurus, thank
    you very much!
