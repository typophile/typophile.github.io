  a peculiar question. I'm looking to physically enlarge a text(Ziggurat) in order
  to use it as a stencil. I would have kinko's do it as usual, but considering the
  size, it will be more expensive than I'd like to pay.\r\n\r\nI was wondering if
  anyone new of a site or place to find font measurements and pitches, which would
  make it very easy to enlarge. If not, I guess I'll resort to finding the ratios
  from photoshop or try to make/buy a projector. Any other tips or recommendations
  would be appreciated. \r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: If you actually own the font, what's to prevent you from setting individual
    letters in an appropriate type size, printing them out individually, and then
    pasting them on cardboard to cut the stencil? With most faces, you could easily
    print a 500-700 pt. letter on a letter-sized sheet...

    it across several sheets, and then cut/tape them together to form the complete
    letter. Some programs (InDesign, for example) can tile automatically when printing
    an image that's too big to fit on one sheet. \r\n\r\n> or try to make/buy a projector\r\n\r\nIf
    you use a projector, draw some faint vertical and horizontal guidelines on the
    cardboard -- or whatever surface you're projecting onto -- to help keep everything
    aligned and to make sure you're not getting any subtle distortion."

  body: "I've already been tiling at kinko's with 11\"x17\" cardstock (their largest
    size available for cardstock). But since this will be about 5ftx50ft(250sq.ft)
    printing at kinko's could potentially cost $140-$180. I was just hoping there
    was an easier way than the grid system.\r\n\r\nAfter some googl-ing, I think I've
    settled on trying to copy this <a href=\"http://goo.gl/cjE8\">simple projector</a>
    design, but I will most likely resort to manually taking the measurements from
    the computer, which requires no cost. I know an antique store that sells old lenses,
    but it may not be worth the cost. \r\n\r\nThanks for the input"

  body: Edmund Scientific used to sell inexpensive meniscus lenses in larger sizes.
    Some thirty-five or forty years ago, I built an opaque projector with two three-inch
    lenses mounted the proper distance apart (Google "optics") at either end of a
    cardboard tube. The whole project cost less than $10 (hey, I said it was awhile
    ago), and worked just fine.

    you could borrow -- the kind that hook directly to a computer to project PowerPoint
    presentations and so forth. They're used at many companies, schools, etc.

    I'm going to mod into an xy table. The computer will draw/cut it out for me! Now
    the only cost will be a sharpie/exacto and poster board. No more settling for
    stencil or helvetica fonts. No more kinko's or rulers.\r\n\r\nFor anyone that's
