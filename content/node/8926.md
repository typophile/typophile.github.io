  body: Thanks Bert! You know how many times I have seen Unibody-even on their site
    and still didn&#39;t recognize it. <BR> <BR>Yes, I think the RR is a modified
    Gill Sans. The cross bar on the E is drawn in and the J does not extend below
    the baseline. Otherwise it is probably that.

  body: I initially thought Gill sans too but there are other differences - the R
    doesn&#39;t really match either.

  body: I think they mixed in some Futura. Those S&#39;s are pure Futura.

    The Ses however a a bit more troublesome.
