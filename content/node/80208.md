  body: "<em>I'm curious about the rise and fall of popular faces per area.</em>\r\n\r\nThen
    why don't you do some research?\r\nFor instance, for a particular area, look at
    the advertising done by certain sector-leading companies a few years ago, and
    compare it with today. You would need to go to a library and look at back issues
    of magazines, and identify the typefaces used. Or use the Wayback machine. Is
    that too much like work? As a form of 'research', asking for opinions at an online
    forum is pathetic.\r\n\r\nIf the learning outcome is to identify what's popular
    and make a poster using it, just download one of Jos' free Museos from MyFonts
    and get to work. Tip: all caps, bold sans serif. That should be good for at least
    a B.\r\n"
