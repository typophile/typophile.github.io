  its not another free font, would like something a little more pro. I really like
  Mandatory but it only has one weight.  Perhaps its built off of (or stolen from)
  another font?\r\n\r\nThanks Guys,\r\nPeter.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Mandatory is an amateur digitization of the UK  car number plate typeface.
    A cleaner, well-done version is <a href=\"http://www.liquitype.com/workshop/type_design/cp-mono\">CP
    Mono</a> by [[Tino Meinert]]. It comes in 5 weights and is, despite its good quality,
    free as well. See <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/27362\">this thread</a>
    for more license plate type. \r\n\r\nFrode already mentioned Lineto. They also
    have <a href=\"http://www.lineto.com/The+Fonts/Custom+Typefaces/Alpha+Headline/\">Alpha
    Headline</a>. It comes in 4 weights, but is available only \u2018at the end of
    2012\u2019. \r\nLorenzo Geiger\u2019s <a href=\"http://lorenzogeiger.ch/#11\">Trans-Am</a>
    is similar.\r\n\r\nSee also the fonts by <a href=\"http://www.binnenland.ch/\">Binnenland.ch</a>;
    Blender, T-Star and Regular, maybe FRAC.\r\nFor a more angular direction, check
    out <a href=\"http://www.houseind.com/fonts/unitedcollection\">House United</a>
    \u2013 styles aplenty. Only one weight, but nevertheless 12 styles: <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/suitcase/vafle/?refby=mfde\">Vafle</a>
