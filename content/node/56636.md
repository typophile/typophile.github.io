body: "Hi there.\r\n\r\nCurrently, I'm in the midst of choosing which school to go
  to for graphic design.  So far, I got into CCA in SF, Art Center College of Design
  in Pasadena, Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, and School of Visual Arts in NYC.  I didn't
  think I would get into any, so this is a great surprise.  \r\n\r\nPart of me is
  leaning towards Art Center, but they haven't sent me any financial aid/scholarship
  information and want me to wait a month to 6 weeks.  And, that would be past my
  deadline for the other schools which is May 1st.  I have asked my design teachers
  for their advice, and when they found out I got into Art Center and CCA, they suggested
  Art Center.  But now, I have two more schools to consider, Pratt and SVA which was
  not part of the discussion since I found out this week.  My dream was to go to SVA
  and the fact that I got in made me happy.  I still have to wait for financial aid
  info from Pratt.  So, I have a lot to decide.  My mentor told me that whatever school
  I choose, I've chosen great programs  and that I would prosper in the program.   Currently,
  I'm experiencing an emotional rollercoaster b/c I've waited for so long for this
  to happen and dedicated so much time as I am getting my second degree.   And, its
  happening! \r\n\r\nSuggestions?  Advice?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    the last edition of print and it had a great article on the directions that different
    schools followed. I go to The School of the Art Institute of Chicago (saic.edu)
    and I love it. I think you should look at your work and see what is it that motivates
    you, that would allow you to decide what school is the best for you '

    legends for a reason. It will also allow you to intern in New York, and while
    the pay sucks, that really builds up a resume. OTOH, California weather is great\u2014I
    imagine all that Pasadena sunshine makes dealing with stressful winter days much
    easier."

  body: "Thank you for your comments.  I have been following Print Magazine's articles
    on the schools which provide great information, but makes it that much harder.
    \ I still need to visit NY by the end of this week to make a final decision.  I'm
    leaning towards SVA and Art Center b/c they have great faculty.  And, I would
    love to intern in NY to build my resume.  But as a Bay Area native, I'm not sure
    if I could handle the weather in NY or Pasadena b/c I don't like hot or cold weather.
    \ That's just a small thing.  \r\n\r\nAlso, I'm thinking if I should just stay
    in the Bay Area and attend CCA to cut cost on living.  \r\n\r\nDecisions, decisions!!
    \ I have to calm myself down b/c I get excited, but nervous.  I want to make the
    best decision for myself and my career.  "

    really no good reason to assume that this recession will be over by the time you
    graduate\u2014you\u2019re better off to assume it will be a long depression and
    borrow as little money as possible."
