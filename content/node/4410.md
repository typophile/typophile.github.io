  B2B &#40;business to business&#41;. Our logo and letterhead are designed in Frutiger.
  I&#39;m looking for a nice/ contemporary/clean/easy to read typeface for correspondence
  which will compliment/go well with the Frutiger letterhead. I&#39;ve attached a
  file of our logo and tag line.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve received some suggestions but
  have not found one which stands out for me. Any suggestions - &#40;please also include

  body: If its for correspondence only, I&#39;d go with Officina Seri, or probably
    with TheSansSerif, which is more in touch with the dynamic of Frutiger. Other
    than that, a solid renaissance Font like Garamond or Sabon could also work, if
    the Frutiger elements  and the actual text of the letter are in differnet colours
    or otherwise clearly differntiated by their placement on the paper.
