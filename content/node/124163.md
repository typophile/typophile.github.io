  body: "Hi Creativetype,\r\n\r\nLetters on gravestones are almost always hand-engraved
    by stonecutters \u2013 universally up until the advent of computerised engarving
    in the 1960s and in the vast majority of cases since then, too. In this example
    letter shapes vary quite a lot and it's clear not even an alphabet guide has been
    used, rather just the instinct of the craftsman. Also, as you can probably guess
    by the dates, at least two different hands have been involved, with the top two
    names and dates being engraved with \"classical\" proportions (with e.g. wide
    O and C, narrow E and S \u2013 as inspired by [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan%27s_Column|the
    famous engraved letters on Trajan's column]]), the bottom one with more equal
    \"modern\" proportions.\r\n\r\nYou can get close to the first style with something
    like [[http://www.fontshop.com/families/cresci|Cresci]], the bottom one (less
    convincingly) perhaps [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/insigne/aviano-serif/|Aviano
    Serif]]."

    you would like to try some others with classical proportions  -- like Cresci they
    are all derived from the lettering carved on the Trajan column of ancient Rome

    good modification of classical Roman capitals design to provide wider versions
    of letters like _B_, _E_, _F_, _J_, _L_ and S. \r\n\r\nDon"
