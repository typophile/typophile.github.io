  Absinthe Robette by Livemont Privat\r\nI did a project on art nouveau last semester,
  and so Ive become very familiar with many designers, and font faces from that period.
  This is a great poster, done by one of the designers regaurded as one of the masters
  of the poster industry at that time. Art Nouveau  posters tend to have very curvilinear
  shapes (as you can see in this poster) and make use of many lines and motifs found
  in nature. There is alot of use of flowers and vines, along with the female figure.
  Fonts used in this time period include Avant Guarde, Benguait, and Arnold Boecklin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/VonStuckFranz_5663.jpg]\r\nSuccession
  by Von Stuck Franz\r\nThe Vienna Succession was also known as the Union of Austrian
  Artists. The movement was a protest of the younger generation against traditional
  art. It was a separation from the past towards the future(like most periods, right?).
  The first chairman was Gustav Klimt. I like the type used in this period. It's very
  long and narrow, and much like art nouveau in  terms of stylized type. It has influences
  from the arts and crafts movement. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fischer-NovischDorothea_5278.jpg]\r\nMarilyn
  Monroe by Fischer-Nosbisch, Dorothea\r\nPop art is a design movement that emerged
  in the late 1960s in the United States. One of the most memorable designers from
  this period is Andy Warhol. I chose this poster to protray pop art, because I feel
  like everyone has already seen Andy Warhol's works. So here is Marilyn Monroe. In
  German. I love how the type fills the dress. The type is a san serif font and it
  is a little distorted in order to follow the curves in the dress."
