body: "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nI've created a client font that has some manually added ligatures.
  It works fine on Apple, because OpenType does the work for me. But can I get these
  ligatures to work in Microsoft Word? They're not mapped to any key on the keyboard,
  so how can I access them? I'm making a small manual for the client how to use the
  font. If this means I have to map these extra ligatures to some keys, this is fine
  with me. \r\n\r\nCan anyone help me out here?"
