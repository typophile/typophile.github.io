body: I'm using FontLab 5.0.2 at OS X 10.7.2 (MacBook) and the fonts that I generated
  with them don't works at OS X 10.5.8 (MacBook Pro) . This newest version of OS try
  to validate the .ttf archives and tells me that 'serious errors' were found. The
  system only links the error with the file, without further explanation. Thus, I
  can't install my new fonts on my new computer. On the other hand, I'm using the
  same fonts in the older system without any problem. What's happening? How can I
  solve this?

    if it works on older versions of OS X and also on PCs, who is the most likely
    culprit here?\r\n\r\nThe font itself, FontLab itself, or the version of OS X itself?\r\n\r\nMaybe
    someone at Apple though a little TOO different\u2026"

    run on OS X 10.7.2. Anyway, thank's"
