    what you mean, it's not very stable... agree ((\r\n\"the R\u2019s leg feels very
    stiff\" - I like it. )))  combined with the \"K\" & \"N\"\r\n\"M doesn\u2019t
    stand comfortably\" - not agree. \r\n\r\nagain - thanks ))))"

    with the main stem and it makes all the difference in the world (balance)\r\n
    when compared to his solution in Optima.\r\n\r\nPossible change?   :-)"

  body: "@typerror  - Thanks )\r\n\r\nMichaelangelo by Zapf has a more \"handwritten\"
    basis... It is more \"humanistic\"\r\nI did not set the task of making the Capitalis
    Qudrata, I wanted to give \"spirit\" of classical Roman architecture.\r\nMy font
    have more elongated proportions, I also added a lower-case.\r\n\r\nIf the \"R\"
    is causing so much comment, I'm reviewing it. )))\r\n\r\n\"Possible change?\"
    - changes are always possible )))\r\nBut likely they are be insignificant.\r\nI
    repeat - I like the \"power\" of her leg.\r\n\"The R loses the connection of the
    bowl\" - I like the idea, I'll try it. )))"

  body: "First off, in response to Hrants comment on another thread... I am not trying
    to give this a calligraphic bent. I am merely talking balance. I think the R is
    off in Optima and it could have helped if the join was separated. PERIOD> Now
    back to the other thread where, once again Hrant has misconstrued what I said!\r\n"
