    for a better chance of an answer.

  body: This isn't really an Arabic question per se; it's more of a Build question
    if anything. And an interestingly difficult one. I don't think Word or any major
    layout program allows different elements of a single glyph to have different colors
    (without converting to outlines), so it would require a solution where the diacritic
    is a separate glyph from the base character, but contextually positioned relative
    to that character. And then the color would have to be applied by the end user
    (perhaps aided by scripting). Or am I missing some easier way to do it?

  body: "In Word, display/colouring of Arabic marks is controlled at the application
    options level based on the OpenType GDEF table 'mark' category, i.e. glyphs designated
    in the GDEF table as marks will be separately coloured from base letters. This
    is a pretty crude mechanism, and one that I hope to see replaced or accompanied
    by a more sophisticated approach that will enable font developers to specific
    exactly which glyphs should be coloured separately. The present mechanism cannot
    distinguish between diacritic marks and e.g. decomposed dots, which makes it break
    for nastaliq and other styles in which dot decomposition and dynamic positioning
    is the most efficient way to shape the script.\r\n\r\nNote also that to take full
    advantage of the current Word mechanism you need to decompose some precomposed
    Unicode Arabic characters such as \u0623 and \u0625 using the OpenType 'ccmp'
    feature, and then position the hamza signs as marks. Otherwise they will not be
    separately coloured.\r\n\r\nVOLT writes the GDEF table, so as long as your mark
    glyphs are categorised as such in the VOLT glyph info, this should work. You need
    to categorise them as marks in order to use them in anchor attachment GPOS lookups
    anyway.\r\n\r\nIn Word, open the Options and look for the diacritic display options.
    I can't remember exactly where these are in Word 2003."

  body: "Thanks for the reply of archaica, have good suggestion to try placing Diacritics
    through contextual placement, instead of mark positioning, Will try to assign
    Diacritics as character not marks. But I am not sure will this work in searching
    the text or not. Let try.\r\nAlso thankx for John for details reply, but my issue
    is not to colour all diacritics, I want to do this with some Diacritics. Words
    option to colour Diacritic will colour all.\r\nI will try another option to use
    Kashida or 200C, 200D Characters. Will see what happen.\r\n\r\nFor Aziz, my question
    was to display Diacritics in colour in MS Word, not in InDesign. Does your font
    work in MS Word to display Diacritics in different colours. \r\n.........Happy

  body: "I believe the problem here is particular to the way in which Microsoft handles
    letter+mark combinations in Word and in at least some other applications (I've
    tested Wordpad, but not yet any of the browsers). There is no way to select and
    colour individual combining mark characters independently of the letter base to
    which they are applied. I've confirmed that this is still the case in Word 2010.\r\n\r\nSo
    I'm afraid the only help I can offer is to suggest that you try InDesign ME."

  body: I don't think this is a font issue. I think it is an application and layout
    engine issue, and I suspect Microsoft are making decisions about colouring marks
    with bases on the basis of <em>character</em> level analysis in their Arabic shaping
    engine, so nothing you do at the glyph level is likely to have any impact.
