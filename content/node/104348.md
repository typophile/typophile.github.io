  body: "In terms of letterforms, <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/linotype/trajan_pro_bold\">Trajan</a>
    seems like a good match to me. The contrast is not quite right, but the quality
    of your sample isn\u2019t too good either."

  body: To me it looks like a combination of two different fonts. Check out the width
    difference of the "I" and the "S" and "A". I second Jan, looks like Garamond family,
    but combined with other type of font. I hope you find this approach useful!

  body: "Here is how I think the type in the sample was created: Trajan Bold + Faux
    Bold effect in Photoshop. Look at this comparison of the original sample (top
    half) to Trajan artificially emboldened (bottom half):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ristatyba_5077.png]"
