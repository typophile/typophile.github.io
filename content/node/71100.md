    don't think the reversed-bowl alternates add much of value.\r\nSee what you can
    do with a two-story /g/!"

  body: "This concept has an interesting appearance, there's letterforms from both
    versions that I like. \r\nI really like the 'u' on the first format, the second
    'u' looks a little simple, but it has a better connection to the 'n'. I'm not
    sure about the first 'a'. "
