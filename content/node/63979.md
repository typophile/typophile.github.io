body: I'm looking for lining numerals as an alternative to the old style numerals
  in Georgia. Which font would you suggest trying for that purpose? It would be for
  personal use, not a design job. Thanks.

  body: "@riccard0: Sure, that's what processcamera asked for :-)\r\nAll the same,
    I wouldn't use the numerals of one font together with another one that has a different
    style, just because they have the same father. "

  body: Maybe I wasn't thorough enough in my search, but it seemed to me that Charter's
    figures were the ones that more closely share the shapes with those of Georgia.

  body: Indeed, I still prefer having Georgia 1.0 loaded on my system because I prefer
    the original figure style (which is not quite lining, as Maxim shows) to the later
    oldstyle figures in all the current Georgia versions.

  body: "Matthew gave me the following explanation while I was researching his fonts
    for the TypeCon Seattle exhibit. Robert, was Robert Norton, Microsoft's type director.
    Version 1.00 included the hybrids so I think the timing of this would have been
    around the release of the WGL4 versions, not the initial release.\r\n\r\n\"In
    my design of Georgia I used \"hybrid\" figures similar to the ones in Miller.
    These are somewhere between \"modern\" figures that align with the caps and \"old-style\"
    lowercase-like figures (and are historically authentic in the Scotch Roman faces
    on which Miller is based). Very late in the day, Robert decided that these figures
    were confusing at small sizes and wanted them changed to true \"old-style\" figs.
    I was surprised by this decision -- I thought \"old-style\" figs would be too
    literary for a Microsoft screen font. This happened so close to the release date
    that to save time Tom Rickner designed a new one, two and zero and realigned the
    other figs. I was very happy with the result, and with Robert's decision to insist
    on them. I think he has been proved right because I have often been complimented
    on the Georgia figures -- the first in any screen font I would guess.\"\r\n"
