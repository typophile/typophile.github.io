body: "[[Indices]] : [[Terminology]] : Squooshed\r\n\r\nA term used to describe type
  that has been horizontally or vertically stretched or condensed using graphic design
  software. Glyph scaling in this manner is almost always inadvisable and is often
  a sure sign of amateur typography. Space is best saved by reducing the type size
  or using a condensed (or extended) version of the font professionally drawn by a
  type designer.\r\n\r\n\u201CSquooshed\u2122\u201D is a trademark of <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/6471\">Miss
  Tiff Industries, Inc.</a>\r\n\r\nSee also [[Faux Formatting]].\r\n\r\n<strong>External

  to Font Scaling</a>\r\n\u201CAs a way to train the eye, we suggest that designers
  (and customers) take their own photo and distort it along with the font. When the
  distortions become visible on the face, it\u2019s time you stop disfiguring the
  font.\u201D"
