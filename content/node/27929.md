  experience yet, this is my first real go at a logo - It's a lot harder than I ever
  thought it would be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'Eight Three Nine' is the name I have been trading
  under for the last year.  Mostly low level desktop publishing and some basic web
  design services.\r\n\r\nAny feedback would be great.\r\n\r\nThe website that it
  will eventually belong to is also being redesigned.\r\n<a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/21296\">This
  thread</a> has discussion and screenshots related to that.\r\n\r\nCheers - JonnySchneider\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_001_5398.gif]"

  body: "mad_grab - the mark is actually supposed to read 839. 8 and 3 are joined
    together, with the 9 behind.  It's obviously not succeeded as a legible mark since
    you guys havent recognised it right away. \r\n\r\nPerhaps i'd be better off with
    an ambiguous mark?\r\n\r\nI'll do some more work and post some revisions.  I've
    got limited time to get this done though and so far its taking a very long time.

  body: "Here's a variation using an ambiguous mark, still has similar shape.\r\n\r\nDoesnt
    feel very inspired to me, I like the way the words stack, but not sure about how
    it feels next to the mark.\r\n<strong>version 2:</strong>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_002_4919.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnother
    variation.  Tried to make the mark legibly read 839.  This is pretty sketchy.
    \ Not sure if the idea is worth developing.\r\n<strong>version 3:</strong>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_03_3799.gif]\r\n\r\nHere's
    another direction.  I think the idea is okay, but it looks a bit conservative
    for it's purpose.  The mark can be read as \"ETN\"  It might be a bit subtle?\r\n<strong>version
    4:</strong>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_04_4230.gif]"

  body: "Out of all of them, I prefer the mark in version 3 the best. I think version
    4 is too subtle because even after explanation, I don't get it. Version 2 looks
    too much like a shamrock (esp. since it's green), which I guess could work if
    you wanted to emphasize your Irish / Bostonian roots.\r\n\r\nI say stick with
    version 3, refine it a bit more, and do something different with the type.\r\n\r\n

  body: "Thanks Lex.\r\n\r\nAgreed, the type in version 3 needs a lot of work.  It
    was the one I probably spent the least amount of time on.  I might do some custom
    lettering to give it some distinction.  Maybe a simple geometric with some shaved
    finials?\r\n\r\n-Jonny"

  body: "thats a really good idea. that way the top and bottom of the mark will be
    flat and three will definitely read as three, instead of maybe being an eight.
    \ \r\n\r\nThis idea was originally inspired by the cool shapes of triline type
    for Mexico Olypics in '68.  I saw it in a book recently bought and like the way
    it looks.  \r\n\r\nThanks for the idea Tim.  I'll work on it..."
