  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I watched the Ninth Gate last night from Netflix. IMHO, a rather unremarkable film that I normally would have just shut off if not for the fact that it all centered around antique books. Type didn't play a huge part, but got me thinking about what other semi-mainstream movies might use graphic design and/or type centric plot elements. Any come to mind? 

Any romances set in a print shop? Any murder mysterious surrounding a sign factory? The Scarlet Letter? </div>

		<div class="commentbody">There was a German film I saw a few years ago on TV... I think it dated from the'80s.

A famous graphic designer - head of a big firm is always wrapped up in his work. Eats sleeps and drinks design.

Design design design.

His wife is bored.

She has an affair and runs off with a hip young artist.
Uber cool young artist.

The husband responds by taking the young atist (who reminds him of himself) under his wing and turning him into an uber successful, famous designer - With whom his wife quickly becomes bored and she returns home.

The young artist's life is destroyed by success. What a terrible revenge. 

I don't remember the name of the film though

In "Catwoman" Haley Barry's character is a Graphic Designer during the day.

Also, if you goto www.imdb.com and search for Graphic Designer or Web Designer under plots, there's like 4 or 5 movies that come up with characters who play such roles.

Recently, I watched a show on the Sci-Fi Channel called "Mind-Control with Derren Brown" who manipulates people with subliminal messages. Here's a video of him tricking two employees of the Saatchi and Saatchi ad agency that they'll pitch him an idea he has already written down.

		<div class="commentbody">Couldn't tell you, the rest of the plot goes like this: ...Here he becomes friends with Maciste, his landlord, and Ugo, anti-fascists both of them. When Campolmi is beaten by the fascists, Mario meets Milena, Campolmi's wife, at the hospital and falls in love with her leaving Bianca. Then Maciste is killed, again by the fascists, Ugo is wounded and he seeks shelter in ^ÓSignora^Ô's house. Here he falls in love with Gesuina and the two marry. Campolmi dies, but Mario and Milena part themselves. Later Mario too is arrested by the police.

No mention of how much typography this guy does, or even if he keeps doing it after moving to del Corno. The movie sounds like a political romance, like "The American President".</div>

I watched the pilot. I enjoyed the vibe of the era, and the cute jokes that reference the future ("there is no imaginary machine that can make perfect copies of paper reports"). But I'm not sure if they can drag an entire series along with that. Has the series remained watchable?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">BTW, "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ninth_Gate">The Ninth Gate</a>" is based on (about half of) the book "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Club_Dumas">The Club Dumas</a>." I recommend the book much more highly, though I quite enjoyed the film. The radically different endings between the two are an interesting discussion item for those who've experienced both.

Also, note that the all-important book everyone's dying over in "The Ninth Gate" is a thinly-fictionalized version of the actual book "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnerotomachia_Poliphili">Hypnerotamachia Poliphili</a>" (erotic dreams of Poliphilus), printed by Aldus in 1499. It's a stunning book, with cool typography and imagery. Another fictional unravelling of the secrets of this same book, but under its real name, is also the inspiration for the best-selling thriller "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rule_of_Four">The Rule of Four</a>," which is also being made into a film.

Oddly, the Wikipedia pages on "The Ninth Gate" and "The Club Dumas" don't even mention the <i>Hypnerotomachia</i>.

		<div class="commentbody">Linotype–Hell AG was in existence from c. 1989 to 1997. Linotype AG acquired Dr.-Ing. Rudolf Hell GmbH in 1989, and then changed its company name. Heidelberg acquired Linotype–Hell AG around 1997, at which point Linotype Library GmbH was formed (Heidelberg AG sold Linotype in 2006). The "Library" was dropped from Linotype's name in 2005, and the company is now known simply as Linotype GmbH.

"Hell" was a great company. Its founder (Dr.-Ing. Rudolf Hell) invented both the fax machine and the scanner. They also created the world's first digital typesetting machine, the DigiSet, in 1968 I believe. Many designers, including Hermann Zaps and Gerard Unger, worked for Hell for a time. Note that they were both freelancers or external employees, as far as I know. This is important, because of the differentiation it creates—while they may have worked for Hell, they did not work in Hell. Hell's offices, of course, were located in Kiel, a port city in Northern Germany.

Some may be sad to hear that "Hell" no longer exists ;-)</div>

That’s half the reason I loved it. The Ninth Gate like watching a bigger-budget Hammer or  American International Pictures film. It has overacting, cheesy dialogue, gratuitous bosoms, and with the nerdiest plot to hit a film since Wargames.

<cite>I couldn’t believe Roman Polanski and Johnny Depp had produced this.</cite>

Polanski has a dearth of critical thinking skills that tend to get him into all sorts of trouble. Thankfully he’s been limiting that trouble to crummy movies for a while now. But yeah, Depp should have known better.</div>

Oh right? So is this movie kinda formalist? I can see the Hammer thing; and I'm sure I must have missed something; Chinatown/Rosemary's Baby are so good and you just can't usually fault Depp on his movie choices... it just seemed so spectaularly bad that there must be a deeper (or shallower) meaning that's hidden to the casual viewer. Surely. Or perhaps it was just that making advertisements for Shell (? pretty sure it was shell) and Range Rover was worth it so that other and better movies could get made. I remember one shot that made us laugh out loud, Depp is walking down a otherwise dark and dingy London street completely emptied of any colour apart from a huge and glowing Shell sign attched to a building behind him!

		<div class="commentbody">There's a neat little Russian import called "Night Watch" that got pretty creative with the subtitles on the dvd here in the U.S. (and maybe at the theaters too?).  I've never seen subs treated that way before, and thought it was an excellent idea. They added a whole new  dimension to the movie by animating the type, and was like the subtitles became another character in the movie.  Did nobody mention this?

		<div class="commentbody">I enjoyed <em>A Merry War</em>, featuring Richard E. Grant as a copywriter and Helena Bonham Carter as a graphic designer who meet at work. (And not just because I'm a copywriter who married a graphic designer.)

"Grant stars as Gordon Comstock, a successful copywriter at a flourishing advertising firm in 1930's London. His girlfriend and coworker, Rosemary (Bonham-Carter), fears he may never settle down with her when he suddenly disavows his money-based lifestyle and quits his job for the artistic satisfaction of writing poetry. Based on George Orwell's novel "Keep the Aspidistra Flying"."

The karaoke of their time, these bouncing ball sing-alongs were nothing without lyrics and the beat. The "type" was hand-lettered, but still an essential - - sometimes the only - - element of plot in these forerunners of music video. The films were designed to promote pop music.</div>

Many silent movies used written or printed documents (eg telegrams) as plot elements (reducing the need for intertitles to represent speech)
My favorites: Nosferatu and The Phantom of the Opera.

Inside advertising films:

The Hucksters, Clark Gable. Sydney Greenstreet as the worst client ever, gobbing on the boardroom table.

Good Neighbour Sam, Jack Lemon. Great scenes of ad men hyping each other in client presentations to E.G. Robinson.

<strong>Jorge de Burgos:</strong> Laughter is a devilish wind which deforms, uh, the lineaments of the face and makes men look like monkeys.
<strong>William of Baskerville:</strong> Monkeys do not laugh. Laughter is particular to men.
<strong>Jorge de Burgos:</strong> As is sin. Christ never laughed.
<strong>William of Baskerville:</strong> Can we be so sure?
<strong>Jorge de Burgos:</strong> There is nothing in the Scriptures to say that he did.
<strong>William of Baskerville:</strong> And there's nothing in the Scriptures to say that he did not. Why, even the saints have been known to employ comedy, to ridicule the enemies of the Faith. For example, when the pagans plunged St. Maurice into the boiling water, he complained that his bath was too cold. The Sultan put his hand in... scalded himself.

"There is as much difference to my eyes between the leaded bourgeois type of a Times article and the slovenly print of an evening halfpenny paper as there could be between your negro and your Esquimaux. The detection of types is one of the most elementary branches of knowledge to the special expert in crime, though I confess that once when I was very young I confused the Leeds Mercury with the Western Morning News.

A feisty little guy with a black mustache, Loomis dealt in hot lead both figuratively and actively, for he heated up the lead pot each morning, straddled a stool shaped like a saddle, and composed on the linotype while wearing a black cowboy hat, boots, spurs, and at times, I suspect, a holstered six-gun or two."</div>
