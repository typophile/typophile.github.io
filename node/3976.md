  body: Could be Giampa&#39;s <a href="http://lanstontype.com/GoudyThirty.html" target="_blank">Goudy
    Thirty</a> -- Gerald are you listening? Even if it isn&#39;t a match Gerald&#39;s
    type would be a nice replacement.

    target="_blank"> Goudy Thirty</a>. Quite <BR>a different interpretation than Giampa&#39;s,
    and even more <BR>different than Jonathan&#39;s image sample. <BR> <BR>Is it just
    me, or is this a mishmash of eras/styles? That <BR>leading &#39;T&#39;, to my
    inexpert eye, really looks out of place. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll be interested to see
    Jonathan&#39;s reply to give context. <BR><br>

  body: I can give context. This is a sign that first went up outside the Royal Courts
    of Justice in London around 6 years ago &#40;before that they had no signs outside&#41;.
    The font basically matches &#40;I cannot promise exactly&#41; the standard typography
    they use &#40;from time whereof the memory of man runneth not to the contrary&#41;
    for signage inside the building. It probably goes back a long way, certainly to
    hand-painted signs and so on. Presumably some technological solution has now been
    found, and the basic style remains in use for signage in the RCJ. <BR> <BR>I have
    never seen it printed. When English lawyers used ye olde type on printed documents
    they generally used &#40;and use, though it is now rather rare&#41; something
    that looks like Monotype Old English Text or Engravers Old English.

  body: Sorry. I started to write before Jonathan posted. <BR> <BR>I can add that
    I know from people who have worked there that whatever this is the RCJ administration
    is absolutely insistent that it and only it is used for signs etc.
