    and T-26.  <BR> <BR>Chank is another possibility, and so is Harold&#39;s Font&#39;s

    target="_blank"> Good Girl</a> by Cathy Davies, who states in <BR>the copyright
    area, &#34;GoodGirl was inspired by a font in 1960 Modern <BR>Teen magazine.&#34;
    and &#34;No copyright; use as you wish&#34;. <BR> <BR>Ms. Davies also created
    several <a href="http://moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/davies/cathy.htm" target="_blank">
    other retro fonts</a>. <BR> <BR>Oh, and a bit from her bio: &#34;In 1997, Cathy
    Davies casually put some <BR>fonts she designed on a website as a free download.
    Within two years, <BR>these fonts had been used in graphic designs from TV commercials
    <BR>to mainstream rap albums to riot girl zines.&#34; <BR><br>'
