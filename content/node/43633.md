  of brilliantly designed magazines from around the world.\r\n\r\nMay i have your
  list of magazines. It does not matter what the magazine is about. only the design
  matters.\r\n\r\nThank you for your help,\r\nSami\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    and that was/became my 'all time favourite' magazine, ever. The design <em>(simple,
    minimalistic, unusual photography, generous whitespace, Helvetica, 'urban')</em>
    and the content. Finissimo.\r\n\r\nDav"

  body: There is a magazine that comes out of Sydney called Black+White. It is a large
    magazine of art photography and articles about culture (sometimes pretentious
    and post-modern, sometimes not). In design terms it is without doubt the most
    significant mag to be published in Australia. Take a look at that.

  body: "<em>Seed</em> and <em>Metropolis</em> are worth noting for mixing patterning,
    color, and illustration right into the layouts. <em>The Believer</em> is interesting
    because I get the impression that the design is motivated by budget (no ads but
    only $7.95 an issue) as much as it is by aesthetics. <em>Lemon</em> is great,
    but I\u2019m not sure that it\u2019s really a magazine so much as a self-promotional
    piece sold at newsstands. <em>Idea</em> magazine is especially awesome, but very
    expensive and hard to get outside of Japan."

  body: "<cite>The Sciences</cite> had content that usually had to do with science,
    research and technology, but also the implications of emerging reality. What really
    killed was the illustrations of works by fine artists and illustrators that seemed
    to have a resonance with the subject matter. For instance, a review of a book
    on Chomky's linguistic theories and how his work had been replaced by more contemporary
    theories. To illustrate this concept a Mark Tansey painting was permmisioned that
    features Rothko and Rauschenburg tossing a painting frame into the abyss of a
    cave. The magazine design was clean and utility minded. The mixing of art with
    subject matter was brilliant.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/_3291016_6097.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n<cite>EAT
    </cite>is Bob Pollard's collage art. In typical form, a friend of his handles
    the layout and uses an oversized Futura Caps for the work titles/captions. It
    is indulgent and boring at worst, but the conceptual content of the work is very
    good. I like that this is so personal for better and worse. \r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/_3281014_5152.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n<cite>Newtype
    </cite> is an odd mix of busy J-Pop layout, but includes Photoshop how-to sections
    and great studies of character design. I love that it has all these different
    elements together. Why wouldn't a fan also know how the production was handled
    and have skills?\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/_3291017_6461.jpg]"

    Scientist: I'm impressed with the way they come up with visuals for topics which
    are usually quite abstract and difficult to explain, week after week. And lots
    of charts, maps, and diagrams, for instance, a \"cut-away\" view of the Large
    Hadron Collider showing the villages it's underneath. Even silly stuff, like the
    biggest overhangs possible with Jenga blocks, is nicely done--and the cartoonist
    for the letters page is always on the ball.\r\n\r\nBut most, it's the endlessly
    inventive modernist layouts, and Dax heads with lots of white space.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    in magazine design and writing a book about it  you should definitely check out
    the following sites:\r\n\r\nwww.designingmagazines.com/\r\nwww.magculture.com/blog/\r\n\r\nThey
    are both related to great books and always seem to be updated about what's going
    on.\r\n\r\nPersonally I'm into the quite busy design with lots of details and
    small elements. For now my favorite magazines are the following:\r\n\r\nGQ (American
    \u2013 layout and content - http://men.style.com)\r\nEsquire (American - layout
    and content (especially the covers!) - www.esquire.com)\r\nWired (American - layout
    and content - www.wired.com)\r\nLodown (German - mostly for the content and concept
    \u2013 www.lodownmagazine.com)\r\n\r\n(If anyone would like to see some of my
