  both globally and individually. I don\u2019t want to set a new exception to zero,
  I want to delete the exception and have the pair respond to the class kerning and
  not have a red number in it. If I delete the kern exception or type zero, I get
  a red zero and a new exception. If I type the value of the kern class master, then
  I get a red exception of the master of the same value but I can't just get the thing
  to go back and be a happy member of the kerning class and not an exception any more--once
  an exception, always an exception.\r\n\r\nI even read the manual (hard to believe
  as that is) and can't find an answer.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    kerning exceptions that are covered otherwise by class based kerning. I would
    like to know if I can do this for every exception at once as well as just one
    class at a time.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nChrisL"
