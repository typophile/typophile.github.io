  body: "I don't think this is connected to Lucida at all, but I haven't had any luck
    finding it in my Script Guide, or in checking the fonts of designers whose work
    might look like this. It's hand-printed lettering that was used to make the font,
    so it could be a custom font -- this style is so easy and cheap to make. I thought
    there was something familiar looking about the 'g', but no luck yet.\r\n\r\n-
