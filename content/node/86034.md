body: "Hello. I hope find you well!\r\n\r\nI have a dude about programming some glyphs
  with OT features, for various alternates of any letter. For example, I have a J,
  it is the normal or simple version. Then, this J can be down in its trace of baseline,
  thinking in a J swash. However, I programmed it J swash using feature with this
  code:\r\n\r\nfeature swsh {\r\n  sub J by J.swash ;\r\n} swsh;\r\n\r\nNow, I have
  a new version for J with a extended curve to left, thinking for a initial version,
  however, it was programmed with:\r\n\r\nfeature init {\r\n  sub J by J.ini ;\r\n}
  init;\r\n\r\nFor one third version of this J, that can be swashed and extended to
  left for only initial versions, how can I program it mixing both features, initial
  and swash? Can it be possible?\r\n\r\nMy English is not very fluently, I am Spanish-speaker,
  I hope you can understand me.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nVargas1974"

    add\r\nsub J.swash by J.swash_ini; \r\n(or whatever you've named the new character)?\r\n\r\nIf
    it were me, I would probably put the descending /J/ into a \"stylistic alternate\"
    feature (salt or ss01) rather than swsh, and I'd put the initial forms in swsh
    instead of (or in addition to) init."
