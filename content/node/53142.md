body: As part of project I'm doing for the final year of my degree I'd like peoples
  opinions on fonts that have been "forgotten". Fonts that have been brushed over
  or left behind but deserve more recognition and use. My example is Cassandre's Exotic
  350, what does everybody else think?

    been done before?\r\n\r\nAnyway, I am in a posting mood tonight for some reason.
    My examples:\r\n\r\nthe original Healey from John Haddon & Co, London\r\nGoudy
    Catalogue & Catalogue Italic\r\nOld Style from Miller & Richard, Edinburgh and
    London - designed by Alexander Phemister in the 1850's\r\nBernard Roman from Frederic
    Wesselhoeft, Ltd, London - designed by Lucian Bernard in 1924-28\r\nCarlton from
    H W Caslon & Co, London and not the ITC version\r\nthe original Stellar designed
    by Robert Hunter Middleton - its a sans, sorry Michael.\r\nand lastly Hans Mohring's
    1928 designs for his Elegant Face series including the Outline Face - a sans family,
    again, sorry Michael, but you will understand."

  body: "David, you will find visuals if you can get hold of a copy of \"Printing
    Types of the World\" by Alfred Bastien and G J Freshwater published by Sir Isaac
    Pitman & Sons, Ltd. But you may find it difficult as it was published in 1931.\r\nIt
    has visuals of all the typefaces I mentioned. It also has many more, very beautiful
    designs as well, but these are my favourites (it was a hard choice) and so much
    better than the later digitized versions. Unfortunately they are shown incomplete
    and not very large, most range between about 18 to 24 pt and some smaller.\r\n\r\nIf
    you can not find a copy in the library or second hand bookshop (well worth the
    effort in getting hold of a copy), then let me know and I will scan them for you.\r\n\r\nAs
    an aside: It may have been tied eyes last night, but I thought that I noticed
    some subtle differences between Exoctic 350 and Peignot. But perhaps it is just
    a serif equivalent of a sans 'innovation'  :)"

  body: "<em>this typeface\u2019s name on this page is Exotic 350 for some obscure

    the font, when the type designs were legally available but the established names
    were trademarked. \r\n\r\n[[http://www.tug.org/fontname/bitstrea.aka|Here's]]
    an old email that catalogues the equivalents (Humanist 521 = Gill Sans, etc.)."

  body: "Thanks, Craig. I've been trying to steal some time from other chores to respond
    to Graham's note. The point I was tying to make was that Cassandre designed a
    face the foundry called Peignot. When Bitstream issued its version they called
    it something else, as part of their overall somewhat descriptive style of name
    + number. The reasoning is not obscure at all.\r\n\r\nThere may indeed be some
    \"subtle differences\" between Exotic 350 and Peignot. This invariably happens
    when a face is re-done by a manufacturer different than the originating foundry.
    It can also happen when a face is re-worked for a different technology.\r\n\r\nBoth
    these kinds of differences and the use of new names is all part of the type business,
    and has been for a long time.\r\n\r\npowers"
