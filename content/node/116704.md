body: I would love to know what font this is from this business card my friend's mom
  had made for his hamster breeding business back around 1983. It must have been from
  a few select fonts that one could choose from when having cards made at the printer's.
  I would like to know what it is so that I can surprise him with a T-Shirt with this
  printed on it. Thank you so much for any help you are willing to give!
