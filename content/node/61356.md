body: "I am designing a website and I would like to use Gill Sans for display titles
  & short bursts of text.\r\n\r\nMy idea is to render as png and sifr Gill Sans Extra
  Bold or Heavy for logo, taglines and main titles and using the default Gill Sans
  for mac for secondary titles and support text (list of links, navigation, sidebar
  content).\r\n\r\nFor windows, where Gill Sans isn't present I will fall back to
  Trebuchet/Calibri MS(dependending of the os version the user runs).\r\n\r\nBut I
  would also like to use a serif for long-length body text (mainly articles's content)
  at a somewhat bigger size than the average (14/16px).\r\n\r\nDo you think is possibile
  and advisable to couple Gill Sans with a serif like Garamond, Georgia or Cambria?
  If so, which of these fonts do you think is more suitable to coupling with Gill
  Sans (mainly with the extra bold/heavy weights)?\r\n\r\nMy possibile choices are
  (limited to os default fonts): \r\n\r\nGaramond (with Hoefler Text and Palatino
  as fallbacks), Georgia ( with Palatino or Times/Times New Roman.) or Cambria (fallbacks:
  Georgia and Times/Times New Roman)\r\n\r\nI am not an expert so I am not comfortable
  in combining fonts and i would really appreciate your help.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance"

  body: "Gill Sans is, although not by default, still on a vast number of Windows
    machines. Something like at least 50%, IIRC. I believe it comes with Word?\r\n\r\nThe
    Garamond on a Windows box isn't the greatest typeface in the world for screen
    legibility, and Georgia is used practically everywhere, so if you want to be slightly
    different, Palatino makes a good choice as a companion.\r\n\r\nAn added benefit
    is that both Gill Sans and Palatino follow classical proportions, so you'll have
    that going for you as well.\r\n\r\nBut then again, I find Georgia to be beautiful
    in many sizes because it is so well designed."

    good results (imho).\r\n\r\nI will share when finished."
