  for the font that the magazine &#34;Rolling Stone&#34; uses for it&#39;s  magazine
  title. I&#39;m talking about the acutal &#34;Rolling Stone&#34; text, at the top
  of the magazine. The name. Yeah, so... Could anyone help me out? Thanks!

  body: I figured out the Jim Parkinson thing so far... But the problem is, his font
    set is like $300, and a single font is $40. =P Oh well. Guess it&#39;s better
    than a free knockoff. Thanks!

  body: "Although RS body copy has been a serif face for the 20 (off and on) years
    I've been reading it, at the time of this original post (2004!), Proxima had been
    introduced in a recent redesign as the main sans face. (They've since moved on
    to Amplitude.)\r\n\r\nThe serif text face is ID'd here as Font Bureau's Hightower:\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/3532\r\nhttp://fontbureau.com/fonts/Hightower"

    are reacting to a three year old thread. How relevant can that be? :^P"
