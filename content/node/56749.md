body: "Welcome to our first newsletter this year! :)\r\n\r\nCheapProFonts is constantly
  growing, and we\u2019re now spreading our wings a bit: some of our fonts are now
  also available on MyFonts - and more are on their way! :)\r\nBecause of this I had
  to spend some time preparing new files and graphics etc. so the releases of new
  reworked fonts has been a bit further between - but I still keep a respectable pace.\r\n\r\nIn
  this news release I present the following 9 fonts:\r\n- 3 from Ronna Penner\r\n-
  2 from Ray Larabie\r\n- 1 from Nick Curtis\r\n- 1 from Brian Kent\r\n- 1 from Kimberly
  Geswein\r\n- 1 from myself! ;)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CheapProFonts-NEWS-09-01_3930.gif]\r\n\r\nBecause
  of a recent policy change by Microsoft (and others) regarding the encoding of Romanian
  I have started updating all the released fonts to make them compatible with this
  practice. This updating will continue inbetween new releases.\r\n\r\nCheapProFonts
  is dedicated to supplying high-quality OpenType and TrueType fonts for setting \u201Cforeign\u201D
  languages (languages requiring more than the basic A-Z characters) for professional
  Mac and Windows users.\r\nCheck our site for constant new releases, and see you
  in the next newsletter!\r\n\r\nRoger S. Nelsson\r\n-- \r\nhttp://www.CheapProFonts.com\r\nHigh
  quality multilingual fonts at a low price - for professional (non-english) designers
  with a small budget!\r\n"
