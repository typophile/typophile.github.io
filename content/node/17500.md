    lots of samples of luggage tags, stickers and posters. One font I think works
    very nicely is the Neutraface and Neutraface Condensed family from House Industries.
    I'm using them in combination with Stuyvesant Open script and Corvinus Skyline.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=94&subpage=viewfonts\r\n\r\n"

  body: "<a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/eunoia/\">Eunoia</a> is something
    I did recently. It's not based on anything in particular, but has a kind of geometric
    style that could be Art Deco, or Op Art, or even contemporary.\r\n\r\nCould be
    mixed with something more historical, say from <a href=\"http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000106\">Blumlein
