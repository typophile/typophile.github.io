body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI need help with \"this home\" on the link below. The font reminds
  me of Ambassador, but the h's are different. I know there must be flourishes used
  on the t and the e. I've been looking and trying to identify this font since yesterday
  and I come close but not exactly right.\r\n\r\nI hope someone can help. Thanks so
  much!!\r\n\r\nhttp://wildsigns.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/bless-this-home.jpg\r\n"

    by an additional let's say 12+ degrees.\r\n\r\nI recommend to check the following
    ones;\r\nif you ignore /t/ and /e/ they look pretty close:\r\n\r\nFleurishScript\r\nAncestory
