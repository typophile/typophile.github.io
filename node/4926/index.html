		<div class="commentbody">Ms. Now, <BR>That is an awful lot to ask of any logo.  A logo could &#40;in a small way&#41; be useful only to represent the effort as organized. Your best chance at getting donations is to get pictures and video of the kids who would be helped in front of the media as often as possible.  Perhaps a well taken photo of a representative group of kids there would be the best branding device you could use.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Mr. Lozos, <BR>While your point is quite true, I invite you to look at our own collaborative board re: the DV/Deaf Logo effort.  Outstanding in every respect.  The artists truly captured the essence of the shelter.  All memorable works.  I thought it in the renovations best interests to offer the same impact opportunity T forums offer.  Surely that</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I am not saying don&#39;t do a logo.  I am saying while the logo is in process, perhaps here is something that can be done quickly. I was just thinking out loud hoping to get a dialogue going that would bring ideas to the surface.  Maybe it&#39;s my socratic herritage. <BR>Do you have a name or slogan that gets to the meaning you are after? Here is a quick mind dump to help you think about it: <BR>Small Hands Need Big Help <BR>Help Kids Play it Safely <BR>Playground for Progress <BR> <BR>By the way, what is the name of the playground or project? If that is still open, you might want to use the name as a vehicle beyond just the name of the place. <BR>Again I am just blurting out stuff, please don&#39;t take offense.  <BR> <BR>Also, do you have a marketing plan?  Who is the target audience and what avenue is the best way to reach them?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The quick fix would be Kaboom! canned stuff.  I mentioned it lacks...something.  But it is slick and available.  So that would do for now.   The Fernbank area is an eclectic mix of internationals, blue bloods &#40;Driving Miss Daisy was shot here&#41;, academia &#40;Emory University&#41; and more.  A motley crew:-/  So how to appeal to the diverse yet small masses?   <BR> <BR>Save the Kids &#40;Whales&#41; <BR>We Need You &#40;Uncle Sam&#41; <BR>Just Help Us &#40;Nike&#41; <BR> <BR>You succinctly identified the first step of this journey.  Hooray for your Socratic heritage.  No offense taken, just reading too many old hhp threads.  The working name is Fernbank Playground Project.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I must have misslead you.  What I meant by the audience was the people you are trying to get to contribute money to your cause, not the children who will use the playground.  The desired action here is getting contributions to the playground so the audience for your symbol is those who are the most likely to contribute. Does anyone you know have connections to your &#34;bluebloods&#34; social scene?  I&#39;m hoping for some groundwork networking to maybe make this a pet project of someone there.   <BR>The University may be able to supply young willing and caring students to help with the work and perhaps get their parents to contribute. <BR> <BR>What does the word &#34;Fernbank&#34; mean to the greater community there?  Does it carry any meaning other than a place? You may need something more telling in the name.</div>
