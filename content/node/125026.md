  a font as it was created by a printer. They wouldn't have gone to such lengths to
  create custom letterforms for this small job. Unfortunately the printers are no
  longer trading (Defasio, Bradford on Avon, near Bath).\r\n\r\nThe sample can be
  viewed here: http://www.winterdesign.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_1910.jpg
  \r\n\r\nIf this can be identified I'll be so pleased!\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

  body: "My copy of Rookledge's International Type Finder shows a font called \"Tamil\"
    that looks very close to this. Sadly any attempts to Google this are swamped by
    results about new fonts using the Tamil script, rather than actually CALLED that.
    Grr.\r\nYou can see it as number 613 on this Amazon \"look inside\" preview: https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GxBKJa983wcC&pg=PA239&lpg=PA239&dq=Rookledge%27s+613+tamil&source=bl&ots=WS315jytkk&sig=XIZPSZdh8OSvo_krZulLtTD233c&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiLmJ28zNbQAhVFCMAKHc1ODCMQ6AEIGzAA#v=onepage&q=Rookledge's%20613%20tamil&f=false"

  body: "I agree with Dave's ID of Tamil as the typeface that was used. It shows up
    in the Solotype Catalog (p. 158), where is is shown in even weights. Tamil Medium
    looks about the same. Even though the Solotype Catalog doesn't show the whole
    typeface (notice I am not calling it a font), his \"Sans Serif Display Alphabets\"
    book does show the complete font and I'd say it's a match, even the quirky U and
    S. The book only shows the Light and Black weights, but that convinced me.\r\n\r\nI
    don't know if this has been digitized, although my notes show Expresiv Fonts had
    a font called Tamago that was Tamil Black.\r\n\r\n- Mike yanega"
