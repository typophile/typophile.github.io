  body: I think they left this one for me because I have a whole set of &#39;speeches&#39;
    about this font style. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>I think it is a custom font, because this style
    is so easy and cheap to make. The lettering looks perfectly ordinary, probably
    because it was done by someone with no training. That&#39;s all the skill you
    need to have such a font made -- that and about $9. <BR> <BR>The bad news is that
    it&#39;s almost impossible to find this exact font, even if it&#39;s out on the
    web somewhere, because there are thousands like it. The good news is that there
    are thousands like it, so just find one with most of the characteristics you like
    and use that. <BR> <BR>If you want a concentrated place to see samples of over
    500 similar fonts, have a look at <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script11Pg1.html"

  body: Yves,  are you going to put this kind of answer in the FAQ? We get these so
    often I have thought about using a stock reply that I can cut &amp; paste here.  <IMG
