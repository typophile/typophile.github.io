body: "This is a sample from a bunch of hand lettered text from circa 1960. It's a
  modern/Didone italic, similar to Monotype Modern Italic or Century Italic. However,
  note the treatment of the ascender serifs, which differs from those two.\r\n\r\nI
  need to more or less match this. I'm looking for a typeface that is close enough
  that nobody but a typophile would notice. Maybe the hand lettering was directly
  inspired by some particular font?\r\n\r\nNote: There's too much lettering in this
  project to make me doing it by hand practical, and I'm not really eager to hack
  an existing font for the project, though I will if I feel I have no other choice.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: Maybe I'm a little off the mark, but since it looks a lot like copperplate
    lettering to me, so why not try MVB Sirenne ?

  body: "Hmmm. I can see why it reminds Hrant of Eidetic Neo, but some of the letters
    are *very* different.\r\n\r\nMVB Sirenne is a pretty good suggestion. It is really
    quite different in detail, but very similar in spirit. My lettering is from a
    game board that is trying to imitate a nautical map....\r\n\r\nI'm still hoping
    somebody will suggest something closer to the original, but Sirenne may be my
    fallback. Or I'll just modify another font.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Oh, pfooey. Sirenne is only available in Type 1, and only in bundles of bunches
    of fonts for a bunch of money. I'd have to buy the text and display sets just
    to get the italic and italic display faces. This project just doesn't warrant
    spending $200+ on fonts, and there's no way I'm buying Type 1 fonts in this day
    and age.\r\n\r\nT"
