  body: I almost recommended [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/ingomar/|Ingomar]]
    by Jeff Levine. He apparently scanned wooden type blocks to make this typeface.
    I thought the G especially in Bureau Grot was closer.

  body: "Hi, \r\n\r\nThis is a magazine that I design and founded with friends some
    years ago. The type is indeed a wooden letterpress font that was originally only
    available to us in 12 and 16 line sizes. Its an old Grotesque known simply as
    Sans No 7. We set the type ourselves and then once printed scan it in. For other
    applications, and necessities we've been searching for a digital counterpart for
    many years now and the closest that we've found so far is Linotypes Compacta.\r\n\r\nThe
    hot metal version is far more slender and certainly similar to many condensed
    black grots. The wooden stuff is far chunkier for some reason.\r\n\r\nI hope this
    helps.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
