  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello,

This is driving me crazy.  I've posted elsewhere with little luck, so I'm going to post this here in the hopes that someone will recognize this font.  I'm fairly sure it's commercially available - it's been used in a number of sources extensively.  Hopefully this font will ring a bell here -- you guys are experts, I'm trusting you!  :D

The font I'm looking for is the font used the logo for "The Ring."  A possibly modified version was used in the cover for the Thai movie "Shutter."  The examples that follow are all taken from the HBO Making-Of special on the DVD for "The Ring Two."  (The font was also used as the font for captions in the last few episodes of "Scariest Places on Earth" which aired last Halloween; unfortunately as of now I don't have any examples of those.)

Here are the examples I have so far ... they should be enough to at least form a rough outline of the font in question.

"Shutter" cover:

The place I've seen fonts like this is at deviantart.com

One other idea. There was a salesman at our office who wrote almost exactly like this. I'll bet for a price he would hand-letter your job. He lives in So. Cal. Let me know if you want me to hook you up.

		<div class="commentbody">It's not so much NEEDING the font as it is wanting to know what it is.  Ever since I first saw the logo for "The Ring" I've been obsessed by it -- kind of fitting, when you think about the content of the film.  It's like a childish scrawl, but there's something unnerving about it.     The font in the pictures is undeniably ugly - but it's also sort of cool.  Maybe I'm alone there.  I don't know.  Fonts can't all be perfectly proportioned.

The reason I think it's commercially available is because on the show "Scariest Places on Earth" (I'm a bit obsessive over that show) they used to use this creepy handwritten font.  When I posted a font request over at the WhatTheFont forum, they came back with "Herrick's Hand" (see here: http://www.kandjsupplies.com/text_fonts_handwriting/herricks_hand.html).
I thought the SPOE font was custom-made, but then lo and behold: there's the font, commercially available.  (Just for the record, I've checked all the fonts at the kandjsupplies.com place...I've found a few results that come vaguely close, but nothing perfect.)  Another example: I swore that the font "The Sixth Sense" used was custom made.  Then - there it was, Las Bonitas.  Most fonts used in movies are available, even if they are slightly altered.  In the examples above, if you compare the letters ot those used in the logo for "The Ring," you'll notice definite differences -- but also definite similarities.

This font, I can't tell if it's all lowercase or if they only use lowercase letters to achieve the "Ring" effect.

Another similar logo was used in the recent movie "Reincarnation" (an After Dark 8 Days of Horror or whatever film festival movie), seen here: http://www.impawards.com/2006/reincarnation.html.  I realize that this poster uses handwriting - the letters don't match up, so it can't be a font, but it gives you a sort of idea about what I'm looking for.  Argh.

@fontplayer: I snooped around deviantart...by snooping I mean casually glancing ... and I couldn't find ANY fonts, period.  Is there like a section for them?  There's a possibility that some user-made font made it to the big screen -- the "Harry Potter" spinoff font "Lumos" that was designed to emulate Ablefont made its way onto the Harry Potter DVD menus, so you never know.

Another thing.  Look at the Unrated Edition version of "The Ring Two" DVD.  The "Unrated Version" is written in a similar "Ring"y font.  http://g-ec2.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KBVJRVDVL._SS500_.jpg.  So many examples...so few answers.

Wow, long post, and I lost exactly where I was going.  Long story short, keep your eyes peeled, and let me know if you find anything!

Thanks!! :)

There are a ton of them there. Many have the same look, which is for me: What were they thinking? But I guess there are twisted uses for such things. (and I mean that in the best way)
: )

And there is no good way to search for fonts at deviantart. They are usually posted on members pages as something they did on a lark. I see them when I go through Dr. Luc's latest fonts pages. Here is one I just found that way (I hope the link works)
