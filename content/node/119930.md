  body: "EDITED\r\nAccording to Meggs\u2019 History of Graphic Design Behrens used
    this cover to explore formal geometric design motifs with modular sans-serif characters
    based on a square. Here is a larger scale image of the lettering portion of the
    cover \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BehrensCoverSquareSansDetail_5891.jpg]\r\nSo
    what we need is a very boxy wide font with a fairly heavy weight.\r\nNothing really
    works. Sackers Square Gothic and Bank Gothic are about right for the squarish
    shapes but are too light.\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/sackers-square-gothic/\r\nBank
    Sans Caps Bold\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BankSansCapsBoldUC_4946.gif]\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/bank-sans-caps-ef/\r\nis
    closer. For a better match the font could be edited. For _A_ flip the _U_ and
    add a crossbar. Edit the arms on _K_. Trim off the top and bottom tips on  _S_.
    Reduce the height of the vertex on _W_. Extend the serif on _G_ almost to the
    lhs stroke. For an almost exact match use a parallel line stroke to thicken the
    letters.\r\n\r\nDon\r\n"
