  body: "@ apankrat, Miro and hrant\r\n\r\nWhy does nobody of you shortly explain,
    why this is the wrong place to request font files, although at least one of you
    is a typeface designer?\r\n\r\n@ Alansiin\r\n\r\nThis is the wrong place, because
    many of the people here are typeface designers. That\u2019s their profession,
    but not their hobby. They want to be payed for their work; and the development
    of high-class fonts is very much work. The problem is not mainly a poor student,
    that uses an unlicensed font for his private purposes, but people, that earn money
    with projects, for which they have used unlicensed fonts. Unfortunately many of
    these type designers compare the passing on of font files with the theft of material
    things, which is not really a plausible explanation for people like you, because
    a Porsche cannot be copied in milliseconds."

    I need you so bad, girl! I remember a scene from Clockwork Orange. Alex says there
    (retranslated from German to English, I would like to know the original wording):
    All I want to be, is <em>good</em>. Shouldn\u2019t it be called \"All I want to
    be, is being good\"?"
