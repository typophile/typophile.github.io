body: "Hi.\r\n\r\nI have a special request to create a logo that should be upscale/aristocratic
  but shouldn't reflect fashion. I ruled out any script treatment (fashion related).
  I don't want to go with just some sans serif loosely spaced type, but would like
  to choose a font that would have nice subtleties like Phaistos from FontBoureau,
  but can't use this particular one.\r\n\r\nI could also use any other without those
  nice details and change it myself. Anyway. Do you have any suggestions for font
  choice and/or logo treatment.\r\n\r\nAny other suggestions welcome as well\r\n"

    lots of logos that are meant to convey luxury, and some of them actually manage
    to do that.\r\n\r\nAlso, something like [[http://www.google.ca/search?q=luxury+site%3Alogopond.com|this]]
    might also help to get creative juices flowing :)"

  body: "Typefaces are mostly irrelevant when it comes to projecting the concepts
    like upscale or luxury. A real upscale brand can use anything and get away with
    it because it will be printed on great stock, be advertised in great magazines,
    be photographed by excellent photographers, and sold in great stores with great
    locations. Looking upscale is the result of attitude, planning, and having lots
    of resources to throw at the problem. Typefaces don\u2019t solve that kind of
    design problem and when people on a limited budget try to look upscale it doesn\u2019t
    fool anyone who has the money for the product."

  body: "This is my first try. It's actually heavily manipulated ITC Berkeley font.
    I've put in lots of subtle and not so subtle details that will show themselves
    at larger sizes on press. Actually looking at it, you can probably hardly recognise
    Berkeley anymore.\r\n\r\n@James:\r\nI agree with you James to some degree. Still
    I think that type does give an emotional feeling. Wrong type can give you exactly
    what you didn't want people to feel. Anyway.\r\n\r\n@epsilicon:\r\nThanks a bunch
    for the reference. Never thought of it. Silly me. ;)\r\n\r\nHere's #1, #2, #3.
    Give me your opinions and suggestions.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Verum

    type is \"fancy\", but not too much.\r\n\r\n#2 is the worst out of three, cluttered

    look like two hands of a clock. Or a bird. I don''t know if those are relevant.

    exactly sure if they work well together. I lean more towards #1. It seems to work
    well together thus far. I might suggest playing with the size of the enclosed
    v. seems more classic.good luck.'

  body: "Thanks guys. I stared working with #1, because I can really nicely incorporate
    it into main material: magazine...\r\n\r\nClient also likes #2 more, so I guess
    I'll have to come up with something in the line of #2.\r\n\r\n@epsilicon: #2 is
    done using golden section, so it should be balanced. :) Your suggestion looks
    very nice, but reminds me of diamond. That is exactly what I don't want to achieve.
    As stated in the title \"... not fashion\". Don't you think that lines coming
    together into one point could be problematic? Lines normally tend to blend when
    tapered at very close distance...?\r\n\r\n@hola: Thanks... I like #1 as well...
    But as said... It's not meant to be. Maybe I'll be able to convince the client
    somehow.\r\n\r\n@bendy: bird association could be something I could use. Freedom.
    Publication will use lots of white space... So free... Nice one. Thanks.\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert
