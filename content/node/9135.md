  what it is and where to get it.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/64907.jpg"

  body: I would say it is a font, because the duplicate letters look exactly the same.
    It  may be custom though, because it doesn&#39;t look familiar. &#40;Or else I
    just don&#39;t know all fonts !! &#40;Duh!&#41;&#41;. <BR> <BR>It seems like a
    style Nick Curtis, or Font Diner &#40;Stuart Sandler&#41;, P22, or Letterhead
    Fonts could possibly have done, if I had to guess where to look. Big help, right?

  body: The letters look the same because this is from an Illustrator file. Whoever
    drew this just created and duplicated the letters as needed. She drew it from
    a scan of the logo on their menu. I don&#39;t know who originally did that. <BR>
    <BR>I need to make some t-shirts, and the want more text in the typeface, so I&#39;m
    getting desparate here. I really don&#39;t want to draw the letters out, being
    this is a bit ornate. <BR> <BR>Thanx. I&#39;ll check those designers/sites you
    mentioned.

  body: No, this font isn&#39;t part of any of their libraries. Any other ideas?

    draw.

  body: Dan, if this is intended to be humour, it really doesn&#39;t come  <BR>across
    as such. I suggest you be a little more careful in your  <BR>phrasing.
