body: "Centim is contemporary sans with sharp top endings of stems that give a bit
  technical charm to typeface. With a squarish look, it can be used widely in all
  modern publications or become a part of an corporate identity. In smaller sizes,
  Centim offers good readability due to its simple and good balanced lines.\r\n\r\nCentim
  is available in Regular and Bold weights, as an ideal high-contrasted combination
  where all characteristics of the typeface are purely effective.\r\n\r\nCentim is
  the archaic Serbian word for Centimeter, a word that was mostly used in tailoring
  during XIX and XX century.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Centim_poster_0_typophile_4284.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Centim_poster_1_typophile_5204.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Centim_poster_2_typophile_5104.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Centim_poster_3_typophile_4975.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Centim_poster_4_typophile_4596.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Centim_poster_5_typophile_4343.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Centim_poster_6_typophile_5162.png]\r\n\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/foundry/Tour_de_Force/|MyFonts]]\r\n[[http://www.ascenderfonts.com/foundry/tour-de-force/|Ascender

  body: "I like it. Although it's reminiscent of some other designs of the past few
    years, it does have its own character, which make it useful to companies trying
    to be just a little bit different (a common situation).\r\n\r\nBTW, I would be
    very curious about something: since you're selling this through nine channels
    it seems, it would be very interesting to learn of your experience concerning
    which ones worked best for you... I will stay tuned! (And good luck.)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Thanks Hrant.\r\n\r\nResults depending on many things, but I'll say only
    that we started selling fonts via MyFonts at the beginning, so they were the first
    and only place where you could bought our fonts. Later, we joined the other vendors
    and I'm pretty satisfied with everyone of them (except the one that's not on this
    list above, which turns out to be totally unsatisfying for us). New vendors needs
    time to get the audience, same as with new foundries. So, I wouldn't exclude any
    of those from the list as not satisfying or bad or anything... all of them are
    good for us in some points!\r\n\r\n(it is diplomatic answer, but it is really
    like I wrote, from our point of view)"

    face looks crisp and cool; congratulations."
