  body: Manuel is entitled to his opinion about what types are best. It seems like
    an odd list to me of basically what is most common. I don't understand how he
    came to his conclusions. I also am pretty much 100% sure I don't agree. But none
    of that is so important. Manuel, do you have any additional explanation? How did
    you decide on these anyway?
