  body: "This type of font is usually called Melior. A famous design by Hermann Zapf
    for Stempel in 1952. Based on Zapf's experiments with designs using a squared-off
    circle known as the super-ellipse.\r\nLinotype has the Melior trademark http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/melior/
    Many digital knock offs, some with minor variations such as the softened outline
    found in the ID specimen and in Marseille Serial which is similar but not identical
    to the specimen.\r\nDon\r\n"
