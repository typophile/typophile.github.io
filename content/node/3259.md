  body: Joseph, the odds are great that this is a custom &#40;home made&#41; font,
    because this type of font is so easy and cheap to produce. There is even a website
    &#40;<a href="http://www.fontifier.com/" target="_blank">Fontifier</a>&#41; that
    will do it for free with your own printed letter samples. <BR> <BR>However, there
    are a lot of these kinds of fonts already available, or in circulation. If you
    have the patience to scan through about 500 samples, see my <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script11Pg1.html"
    target="_blank">Script Font ID Guide, Part 11</a>. Those with &#34;HW&#34; in
    the names are from the ClickArt Handwritten Fonts CD &#40;no longer being sold&#41;,
    but there is an <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/ListPages/HWFontAliases.html"
    target="_blank">HW Alias List</a> that tells you the re-named versions that you
    might be able to find on the web. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m sorry, but I don&#39;t have
    time to do it myself right now. <BR> <BR>My advice in cases like this is to find
    the closest match and go with that, because you may never be able to find the
    exact font. It&#39;s not worth the effort, in my opinion.

  body: I did a quick sweep through the Script Font ID Guide and didn&#39;t run across
    anything even vaguely matching the sample above.

  body: Thanks Mike and Grant. <BR> <BR>I went through the Script Font ID Guide as
    well and found some nice fonts but nothing to match what I am looking for.  <BR>
    <BR>I had e-mailed the company that did the web page I got the sample from. It
    turns out that an intern had created the font for them but is no longer with them
    and they don&#39;t have the font. <BR> <BR>Thanks again for your help...
