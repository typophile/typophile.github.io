    out as Arial.

  body: Stretched type... a typographic sin.  <BR>Kerning needs some work.  &#34;Y&#34;
    should be optically centered between &#34;O&#34; and &#34;P. Consider the space
    &#40;between &#34;O&#34; and &#34;P&#41;  <BR>in volume, not distance when centering.  &#34;Group&#34;
    should be centered under &#34;leadership&#34;. Best advice....Hit delete and start
    over....

  body: Okay, the fonts were right. <BR> <BR>Maybe you should ask them if you can
    redo their logo before you design a wine bottle to go with that.  It&#39;s...well,
    it&#39;s pathetic. <BR> <BR>Looks like someone made it in Word.

  body: Lets assume Shaun&#39;s hands are tied and he must use this, somewhat as is.
    Shaun try a script or an italic for the 10th anniversary and place in the elongated
    O. Another thought is use the Roman Numeral X for 10 and Something in all caps
    for Anniversary in a Chunky Serif to contrast with the logo, ala Super Bowl look.
    Along the same line look at the X as in OSX from Apple its very stylizied and
    might be a direction for you to look into.
