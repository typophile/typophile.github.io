  body: "Hello.\r\n\r\nI like the square icon in the first sample... Im not sure about
    the type style on 'communication' or cube for that matter... consider a linear
    sans? DIN... Gridnik... The one below is a complete contrast with more an 'engraved
    style' should I say. Is there any reason for this?\r\n\r\nWhat does the logotype
    have to say? It'd be nice to know a little more about your project...\r\n\r\n--\r\nRez

  body: These are drastically different. So, in terms of picking one, I think you
    need to better determine the audience they are for.
