  Granjon but could be Elegant Garamond.  How can I tell the difference?  Princeton
  UP is not able to help.\r\nScott"

  body: They are the same thing. "Elegant Garamond" is what Bitstream called their
    version of Granjon.

  body: But as far as I know, Bitstream doesn't like to include SC/OSF's in their
    font families. Or am I wrong?

  body: For the most part that's true. There were some expanded sets released in the
    QuickDraw GX era (remember GX fonts?). Most of them (all?) were included in the
    Type Shop Pro CD-ROM. Elegant Garamond wasn't one of them.

  body: "For instance, Bitstream's Aldine 401 is touted as a relatively good-looking
    Bembo, unlike most of what's out there now (save for JY Aetna and Bembo Book.)\r\n\r\nBut
    I'll never fathom why they didn't include small caps or old style figures."
