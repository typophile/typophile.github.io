  struck by the numbers on the face; I've never really seen anything like them. If
  you could tell me if these numbers or numbers like these can be found in any font,
  I'd appreciate it.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_0502_5792.JPG]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_0503_6414.JPG]\r\n\r\nSorry
  that I can't get an image that's not blurry."

    both the camera and the subject on a steady surface? Increasing distance between
    camera and subject? If available, utilizing a macro feature? Flatbed scanner?

  body: "Taking the watch off your wrist might help too. Using a scanner would be
    best if the watch has a flat glass. If it is too curved the scanner's light might
    get reflected too much.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'd really like to see these numbers."
