  body: Thought of that one too, but it has a sort of straightened out feeling, with
    more condensed and controlled letter forms. For example the tail of the R goes
    up in a straighter way than Century Schoolbook (see picture, sorry for the poor
    quality). Hmm, what could it be?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TESTLETTERS_4847.jpg]
