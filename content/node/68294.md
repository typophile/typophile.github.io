  body: "I know this is an old post from over a year ago, but I think I figured out
    the font for the 5 in \"5 Gum\". Its from the Krptonian font and its the lowercase
    letter \"t\". Here is a link to download that font in case you want it. \r\nhttp://www.supermanhomepage.com/downloads.php?cat_id=1&file_id=10\r\n\r\n"
