  I have hit a stumbling block with the script. I don't use script very much and as
  such I have little knowledge of them.\r\n\r\nWhat would allow me to solve my own
  issue would be if I knew what made a script contemporary? \r\n\r\nIt was bought
  up that 'simple flourishes' make a script look dated. What other characteristics
  make a script look 'dated'?\r\n\r\nCan anyone offer any other resources on the issue,
  such as web pages or books?  \r\n\r\nAnswers to all or any of my questions would
  be useful. "

  body: "I think that this is actually pretty subjective. I know that plenty of people
    would say Alejandro Paul\u2019s scripts are contemporary because they\u2019re
    some of the best and most popular new script faces being used in contemporary
    work. But other people would point out that Alejandro and his collaborators are
    excellent historians in addition to being excellent type designers, and that his
    work is partly revivals of script by the masters of the past.\r\n\r\nThen there
    are the very popular grunge scripts by designers like Eduardo Recife, with overlapping
    ornaments, double lines, etc. distressed, and auto-traced. Sure some of them are
    just rehashes of older designs, but others are new, unconventional, and absolutely
    gorgeous. But the argument can be made that grunge design of any sort is the echoes
    of postmodernism\u2019s death rattle, and that the nostalgic scripts that get
    more use are still more contemporary.\r\n\r\nAnd it might be that technology is
    what defines a contemporary script, that style is irrelevant, and what really
    makes them contemporary is having a giant Opentype table full of CALT subs that
    allow it to make up for the tiny number of people who can still use a pen or brush
    to write legibly. But if we go there all the people who don\u2019t like the idea
    of technological determinism will start to bitch\u2026\r\n\r\nAnyway, I\u2019m
    going to stop before I get really pretentious, but I think you see what I mean
    about it being subjective."

  body: "@James Eduardo Recife does some really cool type faces. \r\n\r\nWhen I was
    reading about Burgues it said that it was '[an] ode to the late 19th century American
    calligrapher Louis Madarasz' and that got me thinking about how contemporary it
    is. But I have seen other scripts such as for this cloths company <a href=\"http://www.allsaintsshop.co.uk/\">All
    Saints</a> that I consider to have quite an old skool look but still contemporary
    - so I know where you are coming from when you say it is subjective. \r\n\r\n@Florian
    Yeah and anything like this: <a href=\"http://www.allsaintsshop.co.uk/\">My Fonts</a>\r\n\r\n@Nick
    Interesting the use of the pseudo-randomization. It does look contemporary. It
    doesn't do much for me though."

    only for describing prevailing trends of the moment, but by the time it is described
    the moment is already past, and no longer contemporary.\r\nOne runs into the same
