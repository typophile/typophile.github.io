body: I want to create a typeface (OTF) based upon the handwriting of my Grandmother.  She
  has beautiful handwriting. What I am wondering is if there is some resource out
  there outlining a list of particular words or a paragraph, that I should have her
  write in order to understand the relationship between specific letters (i.e. ss,
  th, tt, ing, etc.).  My thought is that there may be a paragraph (or more) of text
  that she can write down and that I can study in order to learn and create the typeface.  Any
  insight on how I might go about starting this would be great! Thanks!
