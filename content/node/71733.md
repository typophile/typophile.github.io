  body: "I love you.\r\n\r\nIt's only for \"sale\" on one site... \"fontmenu.\" There's
    also a \"wide\" version, which is obviously just a stretched version.\r\n\r\nI'm
    preparing to draw a typeface that looks a lot like this, but it'll have precise
    curves instead of the imperfect lines... planning on doing a couple weights of
    it, too. Wish me luck."
