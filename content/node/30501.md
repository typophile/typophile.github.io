body: I'm working on a project that's taking some inspiration from SoCal hot rod culture
  using this shirt graphic as an example. Hot rod-inspired fonts are easy enough to
  find, but can anybody suggest something similar to what used here for "Irwindale
  Speedway" and "Saturday, Dec. 9" that I can use for things that need to be more
  legible. It looks like a semi-sans with a variable stroke weight. Any suggestions?

    is similar to the date type style, the speedway one looks like a brush-type script,
    maybe Brody?\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "The Fontry is actually run by a crazy cool guy by the name of Michael Gene
    Adkins, who also has fonts through GarageFonts and Phil's Fonts. The Fontry is
    in Oklahoma, and if I recall, Michael has a used car business in addition to the
    foundry. He specializes in fonts and lettering for signmakers, including Becker's
    beautiful stuff.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.philsfonts.com/sresults.html?key=5&fcode=FN\r\n"
