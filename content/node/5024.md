  body: My suggestion is to look at the samples in <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script07Pg1.html"
    target="_blank">Part 7 of the Script Font ID Guide</a> to see if you find something
    fairly similar. These are all the scripts I have collected so far that might be
    like your sample. &#40;Part 6 also has some connected sign scripts, but I think
    they are duplicated in Part 7&#41;.
