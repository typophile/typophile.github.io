body: I was excitied when i first got my new laptop last year that shipped with Microsoft
  XP and found that it came loaded with several OpenType fonts. I was quickly let
  down, however, when i realized that apparently there are no OT features for these
  fonts. Do these fonts show up as OT fonts simply because they have been digitally
  signed? or is there some other reason? And why wouldn&#39;t Microsoft go ahead and
  add OT features to these fonts? Any answers anyone?

  body: Yes, any TTF that has been digitally signed will show up with the OpenType
    logo. <BR> <BR>The Microsoft Typography group has a surprisingly limited budget
    considering how many different groups within MS they service and how many different
    scripts and languages they need to support. This means that they are careful how
    they spend their money, and only invest in development of new features as they
    become accessible in the operating system or other MS software. Since typographic
    OTL features for European scripts are not supported in Windows XP, MST decided
    not to invest in adding such features to those fonts, preferring to spend their
    money on features for complex script shaping that is supported. To date, I believe
    Palatino Linotype is the only shipping MS font with OTL features for the Latin
    script. <BR> <BR>I think you will see more fonts with typographic layout features
    shipping with the next version of Windows &#40;Longhorn&#41;, because this system
    will provide support for such features.

  body: Yes, they show up as OpenType fonts simply due to the digital signatures.
    In the future, Microsoft may make a clearer distinction between OpenType functionality
    and digital signatures. <BR> <BR>Adding western typographic OpenType features
    in any major way means adding glyphs to these fonts. It&#39;s a pretty big undertaking.
    <BR> <BR>Remember too that Microsoft&#39;s main focus is extended language support.
    They have already shipped many fonts that do advanced typographic stuff related
    to language support, and are working on many more. The &#34;Arabic Typesetting&#34;
    font is quite an impressive piece of work, for instance &#40;despite the lame
    name&#41;. <BR> <BR>Microsoft&#39;s Palatino Linotype does have a fair number
    of OpenType features, but AFAIK it&#39;s the only western language font family
    that MS has shipped for which this is true. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T
