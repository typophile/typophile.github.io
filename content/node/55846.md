body: "I am looking for some recommendations for fonts to use in LaTeX/Beamer slides.
  I am limited to fonts bundled with CS3, Windows system fonts, and free as in beer
  fonts. The slides are not too busy, but do contain short blocks of text.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "The slides accompany lectures, seminars, and conference papers. The audience
    is typically students or academics in law or urban planning. The rooms range from
    seminar rooms, to midsize lecture halls, to large auditoriums (I usually test
    the slides in advance from the back row and adjust the size before compiling).\r\n\r\nIf
    you have several recommendations for different scenarios, I'll take them all!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Give Candara a shot. It's a screen font, it's very open (including trapping),
    plus it has the right level of liveliness - enough to inject some interest in
    the lo-fi world of slides.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Steve, XeTeX is great, but I'm a LyX user, so I'd have to export every document
    to .tex first, then compile. Also, won't I have problems with \pgfpagesuselayout?
