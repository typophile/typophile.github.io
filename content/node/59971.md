body: "I'm designing a rather wordy coffee table book for this company. They already
  license Font Bureau's Interstate (it has their name on it, but I don't see any difference
  between the PDF and their font), and want to use it for the book.\r\n\r\nI'm against
  setting the whole book in it... BUT, I can't seem to find a serif that really feels/matches
  it. I've tried tinkering with Adobe Caslon, but I'm not happy with the results:(
  Need suggestions?\r\n\r\nThe company is a very big international company, with over
  a century of history. It would be good to have a small reference to that, while
  at the same time being quite contemporary...at least..to match Interstate(?)\r\n\r\nGarh..
  need help.\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: I can't imagine an entire book set in Interstate, ideal for headlines, captions,
    but not extensive text IMO. I'd recommend you take a look at [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Whitman|Whitman]]
    it's a more "modern" serif that has underlying geometry that seems to compliment
    Interstate, Gotham, etc. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/interwhit_4826.jpg]

  body: "Some years ago, Ellen Lupton's <em>Mixing Messages</em> was set in Interstate,
    quite nicely.\r\n\r\nCaslon is a rather unimaginative choice.\r\nThere have been
    many excellent new serif faces released in the past five years.\r\nTry searching
    at Fontshop.com.\r\n\r\nMy <a href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/pratt.html\">Pratt
    Pro</a> has similar large x-height and semi-condensed proportions to Interstate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Thanks Nick & Chris.. Whitman seems like a good choice, got to factor that
    into the costs (argh..convince the client..convince the client)

    Interstate has never come across as a functional bodytext, but Ellen Luptons book
    look rather nice actually. "
