  critique.\r\n\r\nHere's something I did for the agency I work for.\r\n\r\nIt's an
  alternate from our corporate identity for use on shirts, hat and other merchandise.\r\n\r\nThe
  leaf is a part of the primary system.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/744211262026184_5150.jpg]"

  body: "I like the illustration style in this logo. Very clean and well done. I feel
    it suffers a little in terms of being quickly readable. I think that could be
    cleaned up by simplifying just a little. Try taking the highlights off of the
    script, as I think that adds too much busyness. I also think the \"Studio\" part
    of the logo could loose the strokes below the circles, again to make things a
    little less detailed.\r\n\r\nIt's a tough call though, because as I look at it
    again it's got a neat style, and I could see it being used as is. Especially since
    you do say it's an alternate identity, and I assume the primary identity is a
    little simpler. I think cleaning it up to make it more instantly readable would
    make it much more powerful as a logo, however you might also loose some of the
    style in the process and if you're just going for something stylistic and artsy
    that doesn't necessarily read quickly, it might just be better to leave it."

    details and it makes so much sense.\r\n\r\nAlready ran into some small issues
    with embroidery, so I agree with your statements and will remove the small distractions.\r\n"
