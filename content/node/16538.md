  body: I remember that from signmaking. The font is a standard Gerber Omega/Signmaker
    font called Caslon Adbold - sorry I cannot find a sample for you to compare, but
    I am certain of the name.

  body: The old Fontbank font <a href="http://www.buyfonts.com/value_for_money/calentad.htm"
    target="_blank">CalentAd Bold</a> is a match for Caslon Ad Bold except for a few
    details (the ball serif on the 'a' is slightly cupped, for one).
