  logo is in?\r\n\r\nIt might be custom designed, any help would be appreciated!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rvltn_3722.gif]"

  body: Great stuff! :^D The R has some problems, but what a fun logo! The typeface
    (if it isn't a custom job) might be a freeware one. Did you check the techno section
    on DaFont?

  body: "Whaddaya know, FontHaus is now selling all the Image Club fonts. Here is
    [[http://www.fonthaus.com/products/fonts/view.cfm/sku/MI415591|East Bloc Closed]].
    There is an alternate version and two equivalent lined versions.\r\n\r\n[edit:
    hmmm, I guess they are getting them from Monotype, which also has this font. For
    some reason I thought Monotype had offloaded the Image Club fonts after having
    them for a while. Apparently they just decided they didn't need to be the exclusive
    vendors.]\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
