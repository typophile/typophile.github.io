  body: "the only real exceptions for the bottom text not being imprint shadow was
    really the C and the T. From what i can tell it does have the holes inside the
    letters. it might just be because its low res but heres my comparison shot (sorry
    its external hyperlinked but my work proxxy is bugging out on uploads..)\r\n\r\nhttp://i54.tinypic.com/4txe2o.jpg"
