    Veyron does rule. But not for the scenario you mention; in fact considering I
    already have four kids I would need a Veyron for going in the <em>other</em> direction...\r\n\r\nBTW
    as any serious driver will tell you, it's not the car, it's the driver. Give me
    a 1980s BMW M3 and I can get anywhere in 2 hours.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
