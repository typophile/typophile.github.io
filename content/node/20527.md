  body: Yara, I don't know if this is what you are looking for or not but from time
    to time I have referenced a very basic book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0072492910/sr=8-2/qid=1149949115/ref=pd_bbs_2/104-2148455-1477543?%5Fencoding=UTF8">
    The Newspaper Designer's Handbook</a>. Very basic, but it has good information
    in it. I'm certain there are other books, too.
