body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/preview_4257.PNG]\r\n\r\nThis is my first
  actual font, though I've drawn some letters before in Illustrator. I have used a
  broad nib pen before, and handled a copperplate pen, if that matters. This is intended
  to be a Garamond-like text face. I tried to make the lower serifs somewhat triangular
  too.\r\n\r\nI drew all the letters right in fontforge, which I've never used before.
  It's a bit slow-going, and I also happen to be a perfectionist. If you know about
  font files &c, you can email me, and I can send you a copy to comment on.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
  you can critique anything, so I'll know if I'm doing something wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\nBri\xE4n."

  body: "Okay, you definitely asked for it ;-)\r\n\r\nMaking text fonts is the high
    art of typography, way more difficult than display fonts. So why would you make
    your own text font? There are so many excellent ones around. What's so new about
    yours that the world (or you) should have it?\r\n\r\nYour font mixes different
    style elements from different eras of fontmaking. There are many Geralde (Renaissance)
    characteristics in it (slanted axis in o and e, wedge shaped upper serifs). The
    \"a\" OTOH reminds me of modern (classicist) fonts like Century Schoolbook. The
    \"s\" borrows from Cheltenham, the \"k\" even from Walbaum. The bottom serifs
    are mostly too pointy. In summary, I see no concept in your font, except for using
    a diamond shaped period and i-dot. You could rather take a Garamond or Minion
    and replace round dots by diamonds if that is what you're after (remember to check
    the font licenses first!).\r\n\r\nSorry to be so direct - I'm not American ;-)\r\n\r\nAndreas"

  body: "Okay. I have posted another preview - I'll make a PDF when I get home. (At
    the Library right now.)\r\n\r\nWhy make a text font? Because I've never made one
    before; I'd like to make a font I at least can <i>use</i> regularly. I really
    don't have an extreme amount of display fonts I use. I suppose I don't have much
    to say about what new thing my font has to offer. I thought of that, though. I
    suppose it will add just as much as any other text font that has been released
    -- a different flavor.\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't think mixing different style elements
    is bad, <i>per se</i>, as long as they mix well. Though many of those were unintentional.
    I reworked all of the letters, just about. I think it's better, though I printed
    a test at text sizes, and I'm sure the eye is too small on the 'e'.\r\n\r\nThe
    diamond dots are a bit of an experiment, though I think if I'm keeping them, I
    need to soften the corners a bit.\r\n\r\nThank you for the critiques, that's been
    helpful. (Maybe I should change the 's'.)\r\n\r\nBri\xE4n"

    I think you have improved a lot on your font. But those pointy serifs still look
    very pointy and too light in my opinion. Try giving them a little more weight.
    \r\n\r\nHaven't got too much time to look at it right now. Sorry\r\n\r\nMagnus"

  body: "@magnus_gaarde\r\nYes, when printed at text size (on a decent printer) the
    serifs are definitely too thin and pointy. There is definitely also too much contrast,
    I think. (Though the r probably needs the join slightly thinner, perhaps not though
    depending on how much I lessen the contrast everywhere else.) Any comments on
    the spacing?\r\n\r\n@fontgrube\r\nI forgot to mention, though, that I don't see
    how the k borrows any more from Walbaum than from, say, Adobe Garamond. Or are
    you speaking of something other than structure?\r\n\r\nBri\xE4n"

    That's quite typical of Walbaum.

  body: "Interesting work. You probably need to think through the homogeneity of the
    work, no? What makes your font a font rather than characters thrown together?
    Try to group them like that\r\n\r\naeg eoc obdpqg hklf ars sz kvwxyz lijt hmnu...\r\n\r\nand
    so forth, to see what does and does not pair up. Do the same exercise on a quality
    font (Garamond Premier ?) and a bad one (say, ITC Garamond) in order to see what
    works and does not. Does it also on fonts in a very different genre to get a better
    eye.\r\n\r\nThen, IMVHO, you'll see the changes you need to make and why other
    people have suggested them."

  body: "I like the feel of this face its sharp and crisp but I don't think the lowercase
    s fits with the rest of the characters. It's to soft. I can see what you are trying
    to do, but I'm not sure it works. Also in the text setting the i and j dots seem
    a little obtrusive.\r\nThe g reminds me to much of Minion.The lowercase x looks
    broken I think the strokes are offset to much. \r\n\r\nI think sharp and crisp
    are the key characteristics of this typeface and this direction should be pushed.
    Think of Frutiger's Meridian. This would mean a rethink of the foot serif on a,
    and another look at s.\r\n\r\nBut my initial impression remains \"I like this\"
    so keep going\" \r\n\r\n"
