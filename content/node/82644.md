  asked to find out if there are any standardised web fonts for each of the following
  languages:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Hindi\r\n\u2022 Urdi\r\n\u2022 Arabic\r\n\u2022 Mandarin\r\n\r\nSimilar
  to what we have in fonts such as Verdana, Georgia, and...say it quietly....Arial.\r\n\r\nReally
  appreciate any help from the members of the board who may have experience in this
  field of typography. Of course, and insights from speakers of those languages would
  be deeply appreciated, as well. :)\r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance!"

  body: "Oh wow...thanks a bunch Aziz. :)\r\n\r\nI had a look around on that sub-forum,
    and still couldn't find a definitive answer to my question.\r\n\r\nAlso, one of
    the guys that I am working with on this project is quite adamant that, at the
    very least, there is a default chinese or japanese web-safe font. But I'm having
    no luck in trying to find it.\r\n\r\nAgain, any advice on this matter is deeply
    appreciated."

    to my multi-lingual web typography quandry?\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_typeface\r\n\r\nAs,
    I understand it, Unicode fonts account for many different languages by having
    a tremendously larger set of glyphs than a standard, language-specific, font."

    of typographical forum etiquette by having the audacity to utter the 'A' word
    whilst in the company of your good selves?\r\n\r\nOr was it my wanton usage of
    an emoticon <em>and</em> elipsis in my second post?"

    bound by what the users have installed on their computers. So, depending on the
    expected OS share, you will want to look for the bundled system fonts for each
    script and/or for the various surveys on installed fonts."

  body: "Your question assumes a level of sophistication in multi-script type design
    that remains elusive. People have enough trouble making fonts that are both authentic
    and harmonious in a script like Armenian; having standard fonts in the Arabic,
    Hindi and Chinese (not Mandarin) scripts that are truly compatible with even hallmark
    Latin fonts is still a dream.\r\n\r\nSo: just be happy there's anything at all
    in those scripts available by default.  :-/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
