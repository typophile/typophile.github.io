  body: "The typeface seems to be pre-digital, as it shows up in the 'Homage to the
    Alphabet' book from Phil's Photo from 1985. This looks like the Heavy weight.
    Treacyfaces <A href=\"http://www.treacyfaces.com/050806_TFWembley_2c5a.html\">Wembley</a>
    is based on this, but he has only the light weight of it. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Nice ID, Mike. Unfortunately, the only digital version of Richmond I'm aware
    of is <a href="http://www.treacyfaces.com/sample.html" target="_blank">Joe Treacy's</a>
    Wembley Light, which is his version of Richmond Light - and the only weight he
    seems to have digitized.

  body: If you can wait until November, I should be releasing Normal, Normal Italic
    and Bold versions of Richmond (although they will probably be named Rowan Oak)
    then.

  body: Good to hear, Nick. Are you going to tuck those alternate characters in there
    somewhere - especially those swashy ones in the italic?

  body: pre-digital. You don't see that as much anymore, especially in this age. Thank
    you for the ID

  body: "Thanks much for the nifty preview, Nick!\r\n\r\nBTW, that 'F' is actually
    a 'J' per <em>Homage to the Alphabet</em>. Oh, and don't forget the alt 'k' (I
    know ... there are only so many slots you can get away with plugging alts into)."
