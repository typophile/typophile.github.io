  body: "The first font is very similar to House Script, from the Signpainter's set
    by House Indusries. A little different in the capitals, but the lower case letters
    are almost identical.\r\n\r\nSecond one is Compacta, for sure.\r\n\r\nThird could
    be Futura Bold Extra Condensed,-but it's not- or even Avenir BC. Looks a bit French
    to me... \r\n\r\nLast looks a bit like Antique Olive, but it isn't. I don't think
    it'a a proper font, because it's rather badly made. Compare the (lack of) balance
    between the M and the C, and also note the very bad Y. Also, the S looks funny.\r\n\r\nI
    hope this is of some help\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Second one isn't compacta indeed.\r\n\r\nAfter a closer look, the 'a' is
    different and the downstroke on the 'r' is longer.\r\n\r\nBut it's not the House
    Gothic, because that one has a very unfrienly (and badly crafted) 's'.\r\n\r\n(Thanx

  body: "The top one is the predigital film font Jackson Script, although it's been
    manually slanted a bit more and heavied up. The only digital versions I'm aware
    of are <a href=\"http://www.qbf.de/dceng.htm\" target=\"_blank\">QBF's</a> <a
    href=\"http://www.qbf.de/cart/cart.exe?gif=dc.gif/Sdc02658.gif\" target=\"_blank\">Louisiana</a>
    and an <a href=\"http://www.castcraft-software.com/homepage.html\" target=\"_blank\">Opti</a>
    version (not sure of the name). Note that many of those QBF Designer Collection
    fonts were 1994 clones of the Opti equivalents, which were made 3 or 4 years earlier
    even. As such, the digital technology and know-how were in their early stages
    and the fonts were, by today's standards, poorly made.\r\n\r\nThe only other option
    I know of: <a href=\"http://www.fontdiner.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Stuart Sandler</a>
    now has the rights to the old Filmotype collection and he, with the help of others,
    is slowly digitizing the faces and <a href=\"http://www.fontbros.com/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?search=action&category=1220&keywords=all\"
    target=\"_blank\">offering them for sale</a>. If you aren't in a hurry, you could
    contact Stuart about where Jackson Script is in the queue."
