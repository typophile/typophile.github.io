body: "Im a Design student doing a rebranding/packaging project. The brand I'm doing
  this project with is Tetra. They make home aquarium/pond products and fish/reptile
  food. This is the logo I've made:\r\nhttp://img514.imageshack.us/img514/7357/logost.jpg\r\n\r\nThe
  concept has to do with water, growth, fluidity, scales, movement, and fish. \r\nMy
  problem is now I'm having problems picking a complimentary font to use on the packaging.
  It needs to follow the same concepts(especially fluidity), but not be too similar
  to the logo type. Any suggestions? I've really hit the wall on this one."

    complimentary one is what you get when you register a software program with Adobe,
    and they send you a free font.\r\n\r\n(I hope that saves you a grammar mark in
    your project.)"
