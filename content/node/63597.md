  am looking for a font that somehow can have some connection with the theme dissapearance.\r\nMaybe
  a very minimal or experimantal font that plays with the illusion of dissapperance\u2026.
  \r\nanyone have any tips?\r\nwould really appreciate it! :)\r\n\r\n\r\n-S"

    something like this type: ([[http://www.behance.net/Gallery/Type-Face-WORN/142134|WORN]])
    where there is such a large contrast between thick/thin that the thins disappear.

    do you know where it's possible to buy it?\r\n\r\nspeter: That sound like a good
    idea, but unfortunatly it is a school assignment without any budget, so I'm limited
    to print."

  body: "thanx guys.\r\n\r\nI think the UMBRA type kind of symbolises that it\xB4s
    already gone, and not disappearing.. but maybe I could do some experimemts with
    taking a typeface like that and making only some of it \"dissappear\".\r\n\r\npennANDink:
    I found another typeface that\xB4s free that works with the same kind of principles...

  body: Maybe go with type that is actually disappearing from the world, losing it's
    relevance etc? Ok probably not, but I thought I'd throw it in anyway. Good luck
    with your project.

    this project. Could be a fun thing to work with on another occasion.. maybe next
    assignment should be working on which classic typefaces are dissapearing and why.
    Maybe a re-design/uppdate project. :p thanx"
