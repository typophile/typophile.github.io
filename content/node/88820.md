body: "Happy New Year to all!\r\n\r\nWe're currently using ATM Delux to manage our
  fonts, mostly in Windows XP. All the fonts are stored on a network drive and we're
  able to create and export font sets for each project. Before beginning word on a
  project we always go to the central location and load the font set for that project.
  The ATM sets are simply a list of pointers to the font files so that when we update
  a font (as we do for some of our series books) when the fonts are next loaded the
  font files are re-read and the most recent version of the font gets loaded.\r\n\r\nTrouble
  is ATM is VERY sketchy in Windows 7 and won't work at all on some installations.\r\n\r\nWe
  have Font Explorer X on the Mac but it, unfortunately, doesn't allow the export
  of the sets as described above. I'm looking into other programs now but the few
  I've checked thus far only indicate that you can manage them into sets, I've not
  seen specific info for exporting the sets.\r\n\r\nMaking my plea here so as to hopfully
  avoid downloading bunches of programs for trial.\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\nKen"

  body: "ATM deLuxe is not supported in Windows Vista and Seven \u2013and it is supposed
    not to install or run properly on these systems. Anyway, it works with some adaptation.\r\n\r\nJust
    copy-n-paste the folder where ATM was installed in a XP. Create a shortcut to
    the executable and make it run in XP SP2 compatibility mode:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/atm00_5263.png]\r\n\r\nIn
    ATM settings, define the folder where it manage fonts as a subfolder from Windows
    Fonts system place. Works perfectly for me. I just avoid to change the original
    Windows fonts with ATM \u2013to this, I use Windows Fonts control.\r\n\r\nATM
    deLuxe can even managem MM fonts in Windows Vista/Seven:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/atmmm01_4296.png]\r\n\r\nNewer
    applications, as InDesign CS5x, cannot recognize MM instances. But they are active,
    as this Word 2002 screen shows:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/atmmm02_6671.png]\r\n\r\nOf
    course, although ATM can work in newer OS, it may be not the best option if compared
    to tools available today \u2013and Thomas pointed a good one."

  body: As should be pretty obvious, neer45's last is spam. Some interesting bits
    about ceramics, but nothing on font management. Might yield some new font names,
    though.
