  body: There are no two-colored fonts. It can only be done by combining two seperate
    fonts that are designed to work together (like Rosewood/Rosewood Fill for example).

  body: This is very similar to Bifur by A. M. Cassandre. IHOF revived it as <a href="http://typographica.org/000918.php">P22
    Bifur</a>.
