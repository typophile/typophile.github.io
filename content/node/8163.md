  body: We had that request before, courtesy of Karen Huang, and  <BR>never succeeded
    in identifying this typeface. Please keep  <BR>in mind this could very well be
    a custom designed logo for  <BR>Singapore.

  body: I found out that the word &#34;UNIQUELY&#34; is Nick Shinn&#39;s Shinn Medium.
    FutureBrand&#39;s the company behind it. And if you want more information about
    the logo, some rationale &#40;unofficial&#41;, newspaper article in which a straw
    poll which said that 10 out of 10 people  <i>didn&#39;t</i> like it &#40;hehe&#41;,
    etc. It&#39;s all <a href="http://www.manic.com.sg/blog/archives/000140.php" target="_blank">here</a>.  <BR>
    <BR>You know Yves, no one identified the &#34;bond&#34; girls font either, or
    had any clue who designed it. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif"
