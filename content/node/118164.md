  time again a little help from typophile also comes handy and highly appreciated.\r\n\r\nunfortunately
  i have not come across any copy of the cover which is neither low res, blurred or
  distorted. Thus, automated research is not effective.\r\noriginal cover was first
  produced in 1967 (so as to give YOU an idea when the font in question was created)\r\n\r\nletters
  that do stand out are K, Y and up to a point S.\r\n\r\nthanks for the help provided!\r\n\r\n"

    exact). \r\n\r\nHere's a bolder modern reinterpretation (use the alternate glyphs
    to get the Y), but you'll have to add an inside-edge stroke the color of your
    background to approximate the weight.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/jazz-gothic/\r\n\r\nI'm
    sure House Industries has something comparable, but I'll have to do a bit more
    research."

  body: "THANK YOU all for your kind respective input!\r\n\r\nI would like to concur
    with Ryuk, in that the original font most definitely has been INFORMAL GOTHIC
    and in its digital revival being SOCIAL GOTHIC. The finding fits the timeline
    as well (font creation 65 - recording 66 - cover production 67). It is not the
    first columbia/emi cover from the late 60s either which I have encountered that
    mixes upper/lower case letters of then 'modern' fonts.\r\n\r\nHence I'd say: CASE
    CLOSED!\r\n\r\n(Since there is no free version out there, I'll have to fumble
    around in PS a bit to recreate the cover text)\r\n:)\r\n\r\ncheers!"

    PhotoShop is also helpful.
