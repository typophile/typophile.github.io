  body: "I am sorry, but this looks more like a 'Type Test', than a logo. Right now
    I only see the word 'Efficase' set in front of a 'f'. Unmodified and unmotivated
    type. Dont get me wrong, I looove nice typographic logotypes and minimalistic
    approaches in logo design. But there is just something missing here. One thing
    that would bother me is the 'f'. As you wrote its just an 'f', set in Balance,
    enlarged, colored and moved to the back. About the 'wordmark' itself, What about
    slightly adjusting / customizing the type, so it stands out. What about a 'ffi'
    ligature? A logo should be unique, or at least as unique as possible. Especially
    typographic logos should have 'That Something'. Otherwise everyone with a license
    of 'Balance' could just set 'TheirCompanyName' and 'copy' your 'logo' in an instant.\r\n\r\nDav"

  body: Is this a medical software company? I am getting that impression based upon
    what you have said. Either way, this doesn't evoke healthcare or information management.
    I would do some research on other similar companies. A logotype/mark should "identify"
    a company, like a fingerprint it should be unique. You have a font and color choice,
    but you have to put these elements together in a more unique way as Dav said.
    Keep working on it.

    body: "Subtlety is lost on you folks. (joke, joke)\r\n\r\nThis is not a defense,
      just a chronology.\r\n\r\nRegarding ligatures:\r\nBloesma didn\u2019t draw any.
      I tried an ff, ffi and fi. The f is so asymmetric that\r\nI lack the imagination
      to improve it. I like it as a shape/glyph. Large, and slanted on the business
      card (so seventies), it has presence. Add Legato for name.address, etc and Avance
      for body copy . . . Too much Bloesma?\r\n\r\nIs the ankh, crook, cross evocation
      a miss?\r\n\r\nSpacing, etc: Well, I did change the c in efficase to provide
      a (too) subtle emphasis on the  \u2018case\u2019. Letterspacing can always be
      improved.\r\nSo can font selection, for that matter.\r\n\r\nThanks, as always,
      for your counsel. Please keep it coming.\r\n\r\nJohn"

  body: I think you need to change the font choice. It looks more playful than serious,
    as it is in the medical profession. A more geometric, rational look will present
    itself more appropriately. The color is a very good choice, though.
