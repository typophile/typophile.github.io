body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI've been banging away turning <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/51521\">what
  started as a harmless diversion</a> into a working typeface. This is my first script
  type, so it took some doing getting high/low joins and alts. At the moment I'm fleshing
  out the uppercase which is trickier than I expected. \r\n\r\nHere are some talking
  points:\r\n\r\n\u2022 I'm thinking of calling it Moped Script. Thoughts?\r\n\u2022
  I have alts that create a non-looped version. Should loops be default, or straight?\r\n\u2022
  Occasionally loops crash into neighbors. I don't want to add letterspacing. What
  do you think of the contextual alts in these cases? (I like the descenders, but
  not ascenders)\r\n\u2022 Should I make the caps work in all cap setting? Is it important
  that they physically connect to the lowercase\r\n\u2022 Any other thoughts or ideas
  that could make this better?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/moped_5504.gif]\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nRandy"

    I did was complain that you don't release enough. It looks beautiful.\r\n\r\n>

    \u2022 I have alts that create a non-looped version. Should loops be default,
    or straight?\r\n\r\nStraight. Loops in the Swash or salt slots. No connectors
    is Moped Sans.\r\n\r\n> \u2022 Occasionally loops crash into neighbors. \r\n\r\ncalt
    or ligs.\r\n\r\n> \u2022 Should I make the caps work in all cap setting? Is it

    a Moped Sans\r\n\r\n> \u2022 Any other thoughts or ideas that could make this
    better?\r\n\r\nAdd a light weight. I think there is enough character in the bones
    of this thing that you won't lose much when the stroke is thinner."

  body: From your name sample "Moped" the "p" almost reads to me like a "js" ligature.
    It could be the looped tail that's causing my confusion. I see you already have
    an unloopy alternate version (except for the g, q, and y, hmm...), so maybe that's
    taken care of already, but it's something to think about

    nearly done?! Thanks for the encouragement.\r\nCuttlefish: Interesting. I totally
    didn't see that till you mentioned it. Seems I have mashed it again :-)"

  body: great stuff. i think this style of script is a largely unfilled niche (in
    type). great work at being one of its pioneers. :D
