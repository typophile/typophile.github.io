  I'd love to have some ammunition to stop the madness.\r\n\r\nPlease excuse me for

    not a hyphen, dash, or worst of all, a bullet. Thanks for answers.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    any other case that had a \"codified\" layout, for those cases had space for far
    fewer sorts than digital fonts have. In a good book typography shop, though, you'd
    have found that swung dash in a \"pi case\" or a \"math case\" or a \"side sorts\"
    case. & each of those cases would have had its own layout, devised for the particular
    shop. The Linotype guy or the hand comp would know where to go get them.\r\n\r\nI
    doubt you will \"stop the madness.\" As people find cute little sorts like this
    one lurking in fonts, they'll find ways to \"decorate\" work with them. Good luck.\r\n\r\npowers"

  body: "I often see the swung dash used in dictionaries to stand in for the entry
    word in an example text.\r\n\r\nIn Korean, the swung dash is called \"mulgyeolpyo
    (\uBB3C\uACB0\uD45C; <em>wave mark</em>)\", and it is part of the standard set
    of punctuation defined in the standard orthography. It is mainly used to indicate
    a range of values, much like the en dash is used in English.\r\n\r\n1\uC6D4 25\uC77C
    ~ 2\uC6D4 25\uC77C (25 January \u2013 25 February)\r\n\r\nLess frequently, it
    is also used to stand in for part of a text which is missing. In the following
    example, the swung dash functions as a \"blank\" in a multiple-choice question.\r\n\r\n\uC6B0\uB9AC\uB294

    the plane\r\n\r\nOne of the frequent mistakes made by Koreans when writing in
    English (and I imagine other languages as well) is to use the swung dash as they
    are used to when writing Korean. It comes up all the time when I proofread English
    documents prepared by Koreans."

    when I was in school, one ~ was never used for \"approximately equal.\" That can
    be found in the Unicode mathematical symbols area. And even one of them isn't
    the same as an ACII tilde (& so is - the same as equals? - is half of =, after
    all). \r\n\r\nI suppose there is a term approximating \"orthography\" for symbols?\r\n\r\n(BTW,
    I think the question should be about the character, not the glyph. The question
    about ~ would be the same, whether in Helvetica or Minion.) "

  body: "My sympathies Koppa, it must be galling to see this usage spread if you dislike
    it so.  I myself like the curve itself and often use it in my paintings.  Mathematically
    it could be a sine or cosine curve which outlines one wavelength of a wave function
    in physics. William Hogarth championed the curve in his 1753 book  \"An Analysis
    of Beauty\" a treatise to fix \"the fluctuating ideas of Taste\". According to
    this theory, S-Shaped curved lines signify liveliness and activity and excite
    the attention of the viewer as contrasted with straight lines. Hogarth's  term
    Line of Beauty has recently cropped up as the title of a novel, and is also called
    the Curve of Beauty in metal smith work.\r\n\r\nThe Victorians had another alliterative
    compound-name for the S-curve that I once knew but have since forgotten- anybody
    recall that?\r\n\r\nBy the way, isn't it possible that its use as a substitute
    dash may have started in California, considering the question-like intonation
    some natives there use to end their sentences ? ~ perfectly mimicked by, er, the
    glyph in question.\r\n"

    instead of writing the word discussed again, as already noted above.\r\n\r\nThough
    it seems to me, that dictionaries usually use a shorter \"swung hyphen\" sized
    sign, while those linguistic texts rather a longer \"swung n-(or m) dash)\"."
