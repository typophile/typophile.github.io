body: Hi, <BR>I am looking to create a ficticious airline called &#34;DebonAir&#34;
  - which has a strong reference to the 60s air travel aesthetic &#40;Pan Am etc&#41;.
  I was hoping for some suggestions for a typeface to base a logotype from. My main
  goal is to create something that hints of that era, whilst still maintaining a contemporary
  edge. <BR>I understand the highly subjective nature of my request, but some stepping
  stones to get me on my way would be &#42;greatly&#42; appreciated. <BR> <BR>Thanks
  in advance!
