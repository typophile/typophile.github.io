  body: "It's not a Serif that I have cataloged either, so I am interested to learn
    what it is. Unfortunately the sample shows very few upper case letters, but the
    l.c. 'e' in combination with other l.c. key letters (a, g and y) is not in the
    Serif Guide, so this is either new or custom.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
