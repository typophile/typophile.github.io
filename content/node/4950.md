  body: That&#39;s a custom designed logo, C_h_r_i_s, not a font.  <BR>You won&#39;t
    find anything like it.

    by Mattel. <BR> <BR>My guess is that it&#39;s bundled with Mattel Barbie software '

  body: Well, we don&#39;t know if the typeface actually looks like the  <BR>logo.
    Dang we should find a sample. Nobody has kids  <BR>who own Mattel Barbie Software?
    We won&#39;t laugh at you. <BR>Promise. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: the logo posted by C_h_r_i_s is probably 20 years old. <BR> <BR>the mark itself,
    while custom, made me think of Treacy&#39;s <BR>work or Benguiat&#39;s work. <BR>
    <BR>As JFP, noted, there are more recent Barbie logos <BR>than the one shown.
    It&#39;s possible that the most recent <BR>one &#40;with the flower dotting the
    i&#41; was turned into a font. <BR>But it&#39;s unlikely that the old logo above
    was made into <BR>a font for a recent computer game. <BR> <BR>Like JFP, I have
    a boy and a girl, ages 7 and 5 _ <BR>actually I&#39;m really into toys myself.

    <BR> <BR>I have some toy industry reference books at home that <BR>I could consult,
    if anyone is interested in specifics. <BR> <BR>Mattel is consistently good with
    its typography, but <BR>there are aberrations, such as the recent Cali Girl logo.
    <BR> <BR>Alright Yves, I&#39;ve set you up for a doozy. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
