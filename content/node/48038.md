  body: "Lining Gothic No. 544 already appears in the 1906 catalog, so I went back
    to the first collective specimen book of ATF (1895). It looks like it is a slight
    reworking of Lining Gothic No. 44 in that book, which means the font was around
    before ATF was formed in 1892. You'd have to look at individual specimen books
    from the foundries that formed ATF to go back further in the history of this typeface,
    but I doubt you would find who drew it. Most of those early gothics are anonymous.
    I can scan the specimen page for you if you like.\r\nJuliet"

  body: "Hi Juliet! \r\nThanks for that info. It would be great to have a digitalisation
    (the best possible).\r\nBy the way: if I decided to do a digitalisation of this
    type, can I do it? I mean in terms of copyright?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nAnt\xF3nio"
