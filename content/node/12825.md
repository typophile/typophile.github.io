  body: Sergej, May I ask what some of your problems with Typophile and its members
    are, beside Flash.? <em>( You sure seem annoyed, by almost everything and everyone,
    recently.? )</em>

  body: "I like the flash interface. Almost every browser in use today supports flash.
    And since so many sites implement it, quite a lot of users have installed the
    plug-in. I can't see why any internet user would not mind \"going through the
    trouble\" of downloading the plug-in\u2026\r\n\r\nHowever, typophile *does* work
    without the flash parts\u2026 I was at a conference center in the middle of nowhere
    last week\u2026 internet access, but the computers did not have flash installed!
    I surfed Typophile anyway.\r\n__\r\nwww.typeoff.de"

  body: I myself am not normally a fan of a flash interface, but it works in this
    instance. Although I would echoe some of the other requests to get some screen
    fonts for the main page. If not an ultrafont, then maybe just something aliased?
    That small fuzzy text will be the death of me.

  body: "<em>I like the flash interface. Almost every browser in use today supports
    flash.</em>\r\n\r\nYep. That's true. But really has nothing to do with user preferences.\r\n\r\nI've
    installed FlashBlock on most of my browsers. This has made the web so much nicer.
    Granted, it makes sIFR rather annoying.\r\n\r\nI don't MIND the flash on this
    site, but it's not really necessary. It also messes up my javascript fix a bit
    that changes the width of the forums, but that's my doing, I suppose. ;o)\r\n\r\nMy
    BIGGEST gripe with the flash navigation is that I can't launch pages into new
    tabs. \r\n"

  body: Though I'm a sucker for simplicity in this kind of forums, I must say I have
    no problems whatsoever with the Flash bits. I'm experiencing version 2.0 as fluid
    and certainly fast enough, and I do use tabs all the time. What exactly is the
    problem? Why remove all Flash?

  body: "But when will we be able to upload images directly into our posts?\r\n\r\nIt
    was much more convenient in the previous version of Typophile, now it looks like
    one has to upload the image onto one's own website and create a llink to that,
    a much more complex procedure."

  body: "<em>Not sure I follow Darrel. I use multiple pages and/or tabs to look through
    typophile.</em>\r\n\r\nThe flash-rendered navigation across the top. I can't middle-click
    to launch any of those pages in a new tab. Not a terrible hurdle, since I spend
    most of my time in the forums, but just another reason to avoid Flash navigation
    most of the time."
