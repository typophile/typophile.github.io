  everyone, I have been a big fan of Typophile for a while now, yet this is my first
  time posting something.\r\nI am a photographer but have been taking part in a graphic/web
  design program.\r\nWe have ben requested to create a  business identity for our
  personal \"business\"\r\nI am still debating if I made a good choice with the name
  but in any case here it is: aRGeBe \r\n...as in RGB...as in the unification of elements
  to create a unit/experience yet seen from a slightly different perspective.\r\nI
  would greatly appreciate any feedback you could give me with regards to this mark
  I have been working on...\r\nI am attempting to portray a dynamic, young, edgy feel
  to it.\r\nColor might come into play eventually but as for now....I must figure
  out the basics of structure/size reductions/spacial relationships and so on.\r\n\r\nThank
  you for you time."

    is my target audience? \r\nWhat does my company name express to them?\r\nUnless
    your target audience are folks in the graphic industry, that name does not say
    very much. If so, it might be ok. Not my cup of tea, but hey, that's always subjective.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck."
