  ago but lost track of. (I'm now trying to recreate the design I used the font in
  after frying my hard drive and losing most everything.)\r\n\r\nAny info would be
  helpful! Here's what I know: It was a free font from a website like 1001fonts.com,
  dafont.com, etc., and I remember that while I looked for it specifically the first
  time around, it took a few days to find it. \r\n\r\nPlease see the examples attached
  below. (One of the examples is the font in outline; in reality the font is solid,
  but I'll take the outline if that's what you can find.)\r\n\r\nThank you!"

  body: Danielle - Candice is not a free font. It's a commercial font. A commercial
    font hosted wrongly on a freebie font website and offered for download doesn't
    mean the font is free, it simply means you can grab a copy without paying for
    it - which is very different.
