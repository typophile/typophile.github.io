  Font Directory and I would like to make sure it works properly on Windows xp. My
  brother already checked it for me, but some weights didn't work according to him.
  He's good with computers but not so much of a font expert. I can't find the bug,
  so I'm wondering if it's there in the first place. So to make a 'long' story short,
  I am looking for someone who is willing to install 4 weights of my typeface on windows
  xp and has some knowledge of the technicalities of fonts.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nJasper
  de Waard"

    the name? I checked the list of fonts on my mac and all .ttf files use a space
    isntead of a dash.

    PC. You'll find my mail on my site. I also checked your Rotterdam OTF on MF and
    it seems to miss a few things. Might be better by direct mail.\r\nCheers,\r\nMicha"
