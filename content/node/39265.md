  are already familiar with the Olduvai font. \r\n\r\nI've just purchased a Mac version
  from Veer, and I'm having problems creating the banners using the Ornaments. When
  I type in the keys to create the banner ligatures, the characters don't appear properly.
  (The specified keys to create the ligature are \" and '. I've attached a jpeg to
  illustrate what I mean.) \r\n\r\nI feel foolish about asking for help, as I'm sure
  the answer is pretty obvious - but I'm at my wit's end. Any thoughts?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Olduvai_4713.jpg]"

    I guess this has to do with OpenType substitutions, so make sure your app is capable
    of that.'

    your font setting in Photoshop.

    the reason and solution for your problem:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/olduvai_5755.gif]\r\n\r\nHope
    that solves it. Feel free to post here or contact me if you have any more questions.
    I'm revising the pdf field guide that accompanies the font to reflect your discovery.
    Many thanks!\r\n\r\nWith my monacle and pith helmet I remain,\r\nRandy"

    the designer of the font itself! :-D\r\n\r\nThanks Randy, it worked when I used
    the glyphs palette in Illustrator, but apparently no such option exists for Photoshop
    CS (unless it's been added to the most recent version?) \r\n\r\nAnd thanks again
    for everyone's input - greatly appreciated again! "

    Photoshop CS2. BTW, Illustrator is better for arranging the borders if you're
    going to be using them in a low resolution file. Rasterize them as a group after.
    At a course resolution in photoshop, it's difficult to line up the fine details.\r\n\r\nI'm
    curious to see what you're up to as well :-)\r\n\r\nRandy\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Tiff, Randy -- lovely stuff!\r\n\r\nSeeing nice examples like this makes
    me wonder if a \"type in use\" forum or perma-thread in the Design forum would
    be useful/possible? It could be organized by type style (sans/serif/slab), media
    (print/online/motion), client/audience.\r\n\r\nI suppose the Typography/Composition
    sub-forum in Critique serves a similar purpose, but I'm imagining more of a gallery
    for finished work, not a working space."

  body: "Tiffany: thanks for sharing that. First time I've seen Olduvai used by a
    non-family member (haha! merry christmas, here's a font). Veer often presents
    the font by setting the ornamented initials as words instead of drop caps. It
    always strikes me as funny since I never intended it that way. Looking good in
    your hands despite the fact that letterspacing drop caps is explicitly forbidden
    in the EULA.\r\n\r\nPaul: Tiff owes a small part of her layout to you... The Pineapple!
    If I recall a raven flew up to me and mentioned you were planning to set some
    POEtry in olduvai. Is that nevermore?\r\n\r\nMarc: The in-use thing has come up
    before, but I think it gets shot down because of the potential for bragging and
    bashing. I really enjoy seeing the laborious fruit of longtime typophile regulars.
    It gives you just a bit more of a picture of who they are. I think it could work
    though. The format I'd like to see is by font in more of a blog-style. So each
    entry in the post would be an image example, with comments attached to each image
    (but hidden a click away).\r\n\r\nKind of like this site:  www.TheSuperest.com\r\nWhich
    is most excellent, and features regularly the exceptionally-lettered illustrations
    of Kevin Cornell (www.bearskinrug.co.uk)."
