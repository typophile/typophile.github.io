  body: "It really was a good article. I'll second those congratulations!\r\n\r\nMy
    only critique would be that they didn't show them off as well as they could've
    been. I've noticed an increasing trend in the articles specifically about typefaces
    where the design falls apart. The specimens they did show were nice, I'm not saying
    that. They should simply dedicate a few more pages and really have a ball. "

  body: Yes, original showings would be good. Christina Schultz may have designed
    something specifically for the article, but the others have already been seen.
    Of course the title in Paul's newest script is entirely original.

  body: I only said that, Stewf, because someone was looking at it and asked me if
    it was Zaner and I had to tell them to read the article. That's all.

  body: Hey, crowded layout or not, at least there were samples with the article.
    I remember when Step Inside Design did an article on some of my work, and forgot
    to include any art with the piece. A nice big blank whole in the layout. (they
    did call to say they were sorry) It seems they may be getting it together at last.

    m pretty happy and honoured to appear in a design magazine. Here, in Argentina
    we had Tipografica magazine that sadly will  not be published anymore...\r\n\r\nThe
    images on Step site doesnt look good but they are pretty well in the printed version.
    Go and buy it hehehe\r\n\r\nI want to thanks Allan Haley because he was very nice
    and efficient.\r\n"

    Fontana edited TpG over 20 years and 74 issues. Always  the magazine had the same

  body: "Hi, Ale. Pleased to meet you, if only online. I was studying at the University
    of Buenos Aires when the first issue of TpG was published! 20 years... that makes
    me feel old! \r\n\r\nBut seriously, it is a big loss because it was such a well-made
    magazine, in every sense. And like you say, it is a big loss for Spanish-speakers.
    A large percentage of graphics publications is done in English, German, Japanese,
    etc. Material in Spanish, whether translated or original, is hard to come by,
    and TpG helped to fill that gap.\r\n\r\nPerhaps their <a href=\"http://www.tipografica.com/\"
    target=\"_blank\">website</a> will stay up?"
