body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\njust a quick question for you. I have a logo that I've created
  for my company. The text for the logo is all lower case and is two words together
  as one word (like facebook for example), but when I mention the name of the company
  in a sentence, I'm not sure how to write it. Is there any kind of convention to
  go by for this?\r\n\r\nI noticed facebook writes it as \"facebook\" or \"Facebook\"
  most times. Its always one word. \r\n\r\nWhere as if I look at my bank, their logotype
  is \"CommonwealthBank\". In sentences they write it as Commonwealth Bank. That seems
  more acceptable since the B is capitalized in Bank within the logo...\r\n"

  body: Intercapping, the inserting of capitals into an unbroken word, is a fad that
    rears its ugly head now and then. It was popular in the mid-to-late 1990s (especially
    during the dotcom boom). Do yourself a favor and avoid it.

  body: haha, I see so you're saying don't do "CommonwealthBank" but what if its "commonwealthbank"
    and in the sentence you write, "Commonwealth Bank". Does it work against the brand?

  body: "Hi viceversarohan,\r\nYour logo is your companies identity. The text phrase
    for your company is also your companies identity. The text phrase can be Trademarked
    with no specified typeface or color specificatons for use in editorial material
    and legal documentation, such as, yourcompanyname\xAE. \r\n\r\nThe only rules
    you need to apply are the ones that promote your objective. Consider the context
    in which you want to be percieved, and apply it to your decision making process.
    I'm guessing that whenever you write your company name, you want people to be
    reminded of your logo. \r\n\r\nBe consistent with whatever elements of style you
    apply to your companies identity and you wont have to worry about trends.\r\n\r\nMike

    In sentences they write it as Commonwealth Bank. \r\n\r\nI suspect the name of
    the bank is Commonwealth Bank, and thus that is how it should be written in text.
    The omission of the space is only a design thing, and thus only should apply to
    the logo. On the other hand, if the company name is spaceless, like WordPerfect,
    then you would omit the space in all cases."

  body: "Okay nice answers guys, thanks a lot! My company name is \"creativelifeform\"
    all in lower case. But when I write it in a sentence, I am going to capitalize
    the \"C\" so it will be \"Creativelifeform\". \r\n\r\nFacebook does this, even
    though their logo text says: \"facebook\" and I think its fine. I am happy with
    it being lower case in my logo, but when its in a sentence, I think it should
    take on the form of a proper noun to give it more presence compared to other words
    in the sentence. \r\n\r\nThanks again guys. "
