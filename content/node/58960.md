  body: The type at the top looks like <a href=http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_din_ot_collection/>FF
    DIN</a>, but it's rather small and hard to ID for me. The type at the bottom is
    just too small (though my knee-jerk guess is <a href=http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/joanna/>Joanna</a>);
    maybe someone else can help. Or please post higher resolution images.
