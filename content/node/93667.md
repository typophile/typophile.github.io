  body: "Helpful Hint: it\u2019s usually best to start a new thread for a new ID.\r\n\r\nAs
    a general rule, hand-carved headstones didn\u2019t use standard typefaces, so
    you are not likely to get an exact match. Nonetheless, the style is more or less
    what was considered oldstyle in the 1800s; an extrabold old cut of Caslon might
    do the trick."
