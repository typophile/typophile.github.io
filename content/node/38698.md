body: "Hi folks,\r\n\r\nThought this item might be of interest, since the typography
  on this 'authentic' NYC subway sign on eBay just looks wrong to me. It doesn't look
  like Helvetica; the spacing of the station name seems all wrong, and the odd positioning
  of the two small lines of text top right just seem clumsy. Tell me I'm wrong (and
  if I am wrong, don't go bidding against me!). Maybe some NYC subway signs do actually
  look this bad?\r\n\r\n[[http://cgi.ebay.com/Authentic-NYC-Subway-Sign-42nd-Street-Not-a-repro_W0QQitemZ300166157792QQihZ020QQcategoryZ4152QQssPageNameZWDVWQQrdZ1QQcmdZViewItem|ebay

  body: Ha! Intriguing. As a counter-example, Gary Hustwit, in his film <em>Helvetica</em>,
    briefly focuses on some NYC subway signage, attributing it to Vignelli (and, of
    course, implying that it's Helvetica). The plot thickens.

  body: What happened is that -- although originally all signage was done in Standard
    Medium which is a 'version' of Akzidenz-Grotesk -- subsequently they switched
    to Helvetica for the signs. So originally it was all Akzidenz-Grotesk, but now
    there's also a lot of Helvetica.
