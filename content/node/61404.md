body: "Hopeless Diamond is a contemporary display type inspired by the dimensionality
  of 19th Century carved lettering and signage. Our initial designs were reminiscent
  of the radical forms of the B-2 Spirit Stealth Bomber and the F-117 Nighthawk Stealth
  Strike Aircraft which provided an additional arena for inspiration. The name itself
  is taken from an earlier model of the F-117 that was called the \u2018Hopeless Diamond\u2019
  due to its unusual structure and departure from aerodynamic doctrine.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hopelessdiamond_ty_4820.png]\r\n\r\nHopeless
  Diamond is available in 3 varieties, each composed of 4 styles; Regular, Alternate,
  and accompanying Italics.\r\nAvailable in OpenType, PostScript and TrueType formats
