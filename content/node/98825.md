  body: "\r\nThe general form of your glyphs is nice, but I don't think the inlines
    are working. The sliver of a stem created on the left side of the glyphs is distracting,
    especially at normal/ smaller sizes. The inlines make the glyphs feel unbalanced
    and feel more like slapped-on embellishment rather than a gesture that grows naturally
    out of the letterforms (exceptions include the |A| where the inline cuts into
    the counter, but even then the super thin sliver bothers me). \r\n\r\nI personally
    think a non-inlined version would be nice. Either that or rethink the inlines.\r\n\r\n"
