  are many wrong exceptions in the class based kerning. \r\nI need to erase all kerning
  values that are not equal to the leading pairs. Is there a way to do that?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance.\r\n\r\nRamiro."

    bad exceptions it is possible to just delete these from the metrics window kern
    listing. Make sure you have the kerning classes you require correctly added to
    the Classes Pallet. The kern values for your exceptions should now turn red in
    the kern listing.\r\n\r\nNow click the top of the kern listing on the header that
    says 'Value'. This will sort the listing and force all the red exceptions to the
    end of the listing. Go to the end of the listing and start deleting them.\r\n\r\nIt
    is a bit infuriating that you can only select one entry at a time to delete which
    means if you have more than just a couple of hundred - it will take a long time
    to delete them all.\r\n\r\nHope this helps\r\nMalcolm"

  body: "Hi Malcom,\r\n\r\nI was looking for some method less manual. Yeap, I finally
    did that, but it is a pain not to have a way to reset class members if someone
    has been messing around with them. \r\nIf you set them to zero they continue ignoring
    changes in the leading pair. After setting all of them to zero I cleaned the kerning
    erasing all pairs with a value under one. In that way they work again with the
    class. \r\n\r\n"
