body: "Hi! \r\nI am freshman and just start to use Fontlab (XP platform).\r\nI try
  to test my first opentype font so I only add a ligature feature to my font in the
  FontLab 5.\r\nAll things go well until I try to generate my new font.\r\nI have
  tested the ligature in Opentype preview wnd. It's perfect.\r\nBut I don't add the
  digital signature to my font so my font icon is not correct. \r\nI wanna know:\r\nIn
  this condition, can my ligature work in InDesign or WinWord ? \r\nI tried to make
  it run, but failed. Later I also tried the MS Volt and my ligature runs well in
  it but after I ship font, it can't work in InDesign.\r\nWithout the DISG, can Opentype
  feature still work well?\r\n\r\nWaiting for your reply and Thank you very much!!!\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nKT\r\n"

    dsig being there or not will have no effect. Something else is wrong, and in the
    case of Word (on Windows at least) OpenType ligatures are not currently supported."

    mean:\r\neven if I add the digital signature, winword still can not show me the
    Ligature? I can only check it in InDesign? Is there some text editor support ligature
    and other opentype features ?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot! :)\r\n\r\nKT"

  body: "Digital signature (DSIG) need only for inform user about <strong>originality
    of the font</strong>. Ligatures controlled and used only by OT feature liga. Microsoft
    Word/Notepad/Wordpad, Emurasoft EmEditor and others except Adobe Creative Suite
    can't have access to ligatures. Also right way is placing ligatures to a private
    area (assign proper Unicode index for glyph) to get access to your ligature in
    OT-blind applications.\r\n\r\nI'm right ? Correct me if not."
