body: "Hey all, so I'm working on updating the identity for a productivity app. The
  message that needs to be communicated is as follows:\r\n\r\nTo-do List\r\nTasks,
  Notes, Lists, Outlines\r\nTime Management\r\nProductivity\r\n\r\nLogo - I've got
  two logo options I'm choosing between. Both are just concepts so please don't critique
  kerning, colors or technical tweaks. I need to choose a direction, and it will then
  be flushed out further. I'm using the typeface Adagio sans for the logo in both
  cases. I'm leaning towards the page turn as it seems stronger and holds the space
  better. The dots communicate time management but the mark seems frail to me.\r\n\r\nTypography
  - I'm restricted to using fonts from the standard CSS stack. That said, I'm using
  Lucida for body copy, and futura bold for CTAs and some headlines. I'd like to stick
  with Lucida as the users will probably be reading large blocks of copy, so legibility
  is a high priority. I'm not sure if futura is working with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Please
  keep in mind this product is also an app, so the mark needs to work well in an app
  icon (square) shape.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/opt-1_3714.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/opt-2_4900.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typography_4665.jpg]"

  body: "Welcome to Typophile, Bridget. \r\n\r\nOption B would work better in a square
    shape (for an app), but it seems too specific to time management, I don't see
    \"todo list\" in it.  \r\n\r\nSince the app has multiple functions, have you considered
    using multiple elements (maybe 4)? I know that makes the elements small which
    is a disadvantage, but Bento by Filemaker used a similar approach. I'm thinking
    simple and more iconic than Bento's more photographic approach. (Unfortunately
    Bento was recently discontinued, and I have most of my business records on it!)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bento_4358.jpg]"

    use of the check mark which graces every and all to-do apps icons out there (so,
    if you want to differentiate, you could want to follow James\u2019 advice)."

    instead of a checkmark. (I only got 3 hours sleep last night which might be a
    factor.) You're right, it is clever!"

  body: "I really like option B. It's clever how it combines a check mark with a clock.
    So obvious and simple, yet I've never seen it done before.\r\n\r\nWhy are you
    stuck using CSS for the type? If the typography were part of the logo you would
    be able to make some needed refinements."

  body: "I did <a href=\"http://swapped.cc/content/logotypes/img/certtime-mark.png\">something
    similar</a> to B for a past project, so I think it's the best option of two. Though
    mine also covered a wax seal :)\r\n\r\nWith regards to the type choices, I'd say
    that while Lucida Grande works fine as a body text, it looks somewhat flimsy in
    large sizes, e.g. in \"Data Synching\". Not illegible, but kind of artsy-fartsy,
    not assertive enough. Also, another thing to keep in mind is that Lucida Grande
    is replaced with Lucida Unicode on Windows and it doesn't look *that* good nor
    is it remarkably legible."

    the line not being flat feels off. \r\n\r\nI agree about the checkmark/clock logo
    being nice! It implies that the app will save you time, etc."

  body: "Thanks for all the comments,\r\n\r\nI'm also partial towards B, as is my
    boss. The only issue is people misinterpreting it as only a clock, and losing
    the checkmark (as happened to JamesM). We noticed a few other people overlooked
    it too. Now the goal is to make the checkmark a bit more assertive for that option\r\n\r\nThe
    checkmark has to stay (to my dismay). I'm well aware it's used in every productivity
    logo ever made, but it's another constraint.\r\n\r\nThylacine- I can use any typeface
    for the logo, it's just the typeface used in the app where I'll be using Lucida
    and Futura.  The interface for the app is used internationally and translated
    into different languages, so using something from the css font stack ensures there
    won't be any translation issues.\r\n\r\napankrat- Is the attached image a good
    representation of what lucida unicode looks like for windows?  If so yes it is
    gross.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Lucida-Sans-Unicode-Regular_6482.gif]"

    not sure that \"assertive\" is the right direction. Perhaps it would help to make
    it look more like a hand-drawn checkmark, like someone would make on a piece of
    paper.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Yeah, by \"making the checkmark assertive\" what I mean is to assert the
    message of the checkmark (to do) more than the message of the clock (time).\r\n\r\nHand-drawn
    is definitely one way that could help. Good thinking"
