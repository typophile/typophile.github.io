    difference in the angle of terminal of the e, but otherwise it's a match.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/news-gothic/condensed/"

  body: "The angle of the terminal of the \"e\" makes me believe it could be <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=LH.108133.0.9&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=bythesea&sampleSize=96\">Trade
    Gothic No. 18 Condensed</a>, although both News Gothic and Trade Gothic have slightly
    curved endings on the lc 'b' and 'a'. It certainly isn't Benton Sans.\r\n\r\nThe
    lettering on a Ferrari Testarossa probably is custom designed -- as with most
    cars, and certainly for a luxury car like this one."
