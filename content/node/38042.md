    in Brooklyn \u2013\_really close to Manhattan though, so don't let that deter
    you.\r\n\r\nThey have a fantastic design book + magazine collection + some great
    tshirts and a huge selection of Japanese (I think) publications, toys, and apparel.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.zakkacorp.com/\r\n\r\nAlso,
    I think PHAEDON just opened a store in soho... or one of those big name design
    book publishers... I want to say it is on West Broadway somewhere between Grand
    St. and Spring Street.\r\n\r\nHave fun!"

  body: "The shop in Soho is a Taschen bookstore, I believe (unless Phaidon has also
    opened up a shop), so it probably won't be worth spending much time there. They
    will stock their own publications exclusively, most of which are available at
    any of the big chain bookshops. The Cooper-Hewitt has a good selection, and is
    worth the trip (2 interesting exhibitions on as well\u2014Piranesi and Ingo Maurer).
    The MoMA design stores have some books as well, though their main bookshop in
    the museum is very weak (or was when I was last there).\r\nHave fun!"

    actually Third Avenue and 9th Street, although Stuyvesant is nearby. (I like it,
    too, by the way!)"

    great Untitled bookstore on Prince street is now a store specializing in doggie
    treats.\r\n\r\nDefinitely check out the Urban Center on Mad. Ave."

  body: Not bookstores - but art stores. Sam Flax had a large collection of type books
    (I'm talking 1990s - things change) so did ohhhh was it Art Brown - gosh too long
    ago - memory definitely clearing out trivial stuff from New York on me...
