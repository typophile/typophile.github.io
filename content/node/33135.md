  with lots of black&white photography...\r\n\r\nWe like Warnock 10pt., but want something
  with a taller x-height. \r\n\r\nLike Paperback, but the weight is too heavy...about
  60 fewer words per page than Warnock.\r\n\r\nLike ITC Giovanni, but it also needs
  to have international characters (for Croatian).\r\n\r\n\r\nBasically, it needs
  to be taller than Warnock, closer in size to Giovanni, and not as wide as Paperback.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for all suggestions!"
