  body: "This sure seems more of an illustration than a 'simple' logo. And if it should
    spell out 'VentureFest' I guess it still is legible. ;) <em>(Not too keen on the
    typeface, but that may be some personal preference.)</em> It's also 'quite' colorful
    and 'playful' for what it's for, but maybe that was/is intended.\r\n\r\nDav"

  body: "Hey Dav,\r\n\r\nThanks for the response. The original concept was using the
    overlap of the letters to represent the networking of companies. The lines/flourish
    off the V is a refreshed device that has been used over the past 3 years. The
    typeface is a custom version of Wyld. Obviously going for the cutting edge technology
    look. The mix of colour's is to show the diversity of business present at the
    event. The fact you could read it is the most important thing!! Thanks again for
    the comments.\r\n\r\nBen\r\n "

  body: "\r\nI quite like it, but to me eyes the problem with its readability is that
    the n is the only letter to actually loose some of its form as opposed to just
    being overlapped.  If its downstroke was reintroduced the whole word would be
    much more understandable.\r\n\r\nWill"

  body: "it reads fine.\r\n\r\nits not as instant as it could be - but then you would
    lose the other elements you are trying to convey, with the style your bringing
    to the party, the least people can do is glance for more than 2 seconds.\r\n\r\nargue
    with your boss mate.. they love it really.\r\n\r\nif he really sticks- the e/s
    of fest are the biggest worry - as its a slightly unusual word so the brain doesn;t
    grab it as quickly as it does with venture - a colour tweak there might solve
    it\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: I actually read it as "Lecture Fest". I think the V should be tipped back
    to be more recognisable. I also think the lines coming out of it might flow a
    little better then. Apart from that I like it.

  body: "My thoughts ... you mention your boss isn't a designer - which is an interesting
    point.\r\n\r\nAre the majority of people who will see the logo going to be designers?\r\n\r\nI
    don't mind the idea overall ... but seriously are you absolutely SURE you overlapped
    the type to represent 'the networking of companies\"? I'm tipping it was post-rationalisation.
    You've only overlapped some letters ... does that mean not all companies can network?
    (playing devil's advocate.)\r\n\r\nI like the movement of the lines ... I'm just
    not feeling the relevance of the type.\r\n\r\nAnd ... as a logo -it's not going
    to work at smaller sizes.\r\n\r\nAll that aside ... back to answering the question
    of legibility ...\r\n\r\nI can read it ... and I read VENTUREFEST but it took
    time.\r\n\r\nThe original logo represents the world I imagine is trying to be
    communicate more clearly than the proposal in this thread.\r\n\r\nA combination
    of both would be the killer outcome in this situation.\r\n\r\nThe fresh feel of
    the work you've presented mixed with the clarity of the existing mark ... working
    together to push both directions further = WIN!\r\n\r\njust thoughts anyway.\r\n\r\n<br

  body: I read it easily too. It looks quite "now" with the colors and treatment.
    I would find it attractive if I saw it out randomly and be interested in more
    information.

  body: "Hey guys!\r\n\r\nThanks for all your comments. Its a great help. Pitched
    to client yesterday and received a very positive response. We are hoping to attract
    some 'big' sponsors to the event so hopefully the branding will have the gravitass
    to do that. We have produced some very innovative promotional print to accompany
    the brand which I will post later for your comments/reactions.\r\n\r\nThanks again!!"
