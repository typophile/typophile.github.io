body: "I need a new font for our corporate letterhead contact details. Here's the
  logo:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_fortypophile.jpg]\r\n\r\nBoth
  the graphic and the name Alembic need to stay the same (though I think they are
  too close and crowded looking in the picture above). Our old letterhead is very
  80's: a gradient strip on the left with the line art and contact details reversed.
  The font was Futura. \r\n\r\nThis time, we'll be using the full color logo, a return
  to our original ID. I need a font that is classy, since we are a high end guitar
  maker. But it shouldn't be harsh, since our product is handmade and sensual. Any
  suggestions of specific fonts or general styles that would fit the bill? "

  body: "Are there other typefaces you're currently using on other print materials
    (brochures, etc.) that would work? It's always good to have a selection of approved
    typefaces to use on all your materials, the letterhead is one piece within your
    overall identity, so consider faces that will work on a wide range of materials,
    not just the letterhead. Sounds like there may not be a corporate guidelines book
    for you to follow, so now is your chance to start establishing those guidelines.\r\n\r\nBy
    the way, have you seen this?\r\nhttp://www.psyops.com/html/spec_alembic.html"

  body: If the word 'Alembic' as has been shown is to be kept I really think any decorative,
    including a serif font, is wrong.

    with Tiffany. I think the companion font should be a sans serif, but with some
    hand-made feeling. Nothing too neutral or crazy.\r\n\r\nHere's a couple of nice

    lower case characters (n = 3 sides of a square) that have a vibe with Boyle's
    elemental symbols (17th C), which Futura connects with also. Ancient and modern
    at once."

  body: 'Take a look at Tarzanna and Vista from Emigre. I think Tarzanna might work
    better because it has a small x height. What you need is something that allows
    the elaborate logo to dominate and is quietly in the background. I would suggest
    what ever you use to either add a PMS gray for the type or a tint of black. '

  body: "Wow, thanks for the great suggestions everyone. This is not an easy job for
    me, and the help is really welcome.\r\n\r\nChris, we use a variety of fonts for
    the brochures, website, etc, and you're absolutely right for the need for guidelines,
    and so I start on the simple part of letterhead and business cards, which are
    the first items I'll actually produce. Right now I'm enjoying things as different
    as Tankard's Alchemy and Simonson's Grad. I use Minion for our owner's manuals.\r\n\r\nTiffany,
    I do agree that it needs to be almost anti-decorative, or least only very subtle.
    All the serif fonts I tried weren't looking quite right. \r\n\r\nChester, your
    list of suggestions produced quite a suprise in Solpera - it's now on my short
    list with Stella. Spalted type? Heh, that won't last for many impressions. Lignum
    vit\xE6, now you're talking.\r\n\r\nNick and Dan, I think I'm not brave enough
    for Emigre. I <em>want</em> to like them, but then there's always some design
    aspect I don't seem to understand. \r\n\r\nHere's the worst thing: our address.\r\n\r\n3005
    Wiljan Ct.\r\nSanta Rosa, CA 95407\r\n\r\n\"Wiljan\" was made up by the developer
    of the buildings on our street. It combines all the goodness of \"William\" with
    the beauty of \"Janet\" and smashes them into one ugly word. \r\n\r\nIt's likely
    the paper will be a sort of parchment-like antique color, because that's what
    my mom wants and she is the boss. In that case, the type will be set in a nice
    woody brown tone. I'm still evaluating papers, each part helps form the whole,
    and all aspects influence the others."
