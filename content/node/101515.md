  wondering if anyone knows of a font that is similar.

  body: "This is surely hand-drawn, given the spontaneous feeling it has. It has a
    flair that is hard to find in a font. Stephen Rapp has some nice scripts with
    swashes and alternate glyphs, and Laura Worthington's [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/laura-worthington/sheila/|Sheila]]
    has the most similar feel in terms of the apparent spontaneity. Some of her other
    scripts, like Alana are also very nice and have multiple glyphs for most letters.\r\n\r\n-
