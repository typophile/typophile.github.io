  body: Dave, great stuff! Love the overall feel - but can't help reading Quebs, Maybe
    this can be fixed by slightly adjusting the 'tails' of the P and O? Also, would
    like to see the bottom tail of the S curling up instead of down. Keep us posted.

- body: "I agree with seb - the overall feel is really beautiful, interesting and
    lively. It's not terribly legible, however. My first take was \"Ruebs.\" I think
    the Q needs more work to read correctly - it's too small to be an uppercase letter.
    Have you tried a lowercase q? \r\n\r\nMaybe the \"po\" wouldn't read as an uppercase
    \"B\" if the whipped peak on the o wasn't reaching up to touch the bowl of the
    p? It's beautiful, but as it is, detracts from the readability and legibility. "

  body: "How do these revisions look? I tweaked the terminals on the P and the S.
    I also gave the POS a bit of a slant forward as I felt like they were too upright
    compared to QUE. Thoughts?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/QUEPOS2_5759.png]"

    in bright happy colors.\r\nSomething very minor that my eye got sort of stuck
    on: The very bottom of the \"S\" looks a bit bumpy (unhappy outline)? But it might
    also just be the rendering."

    a full loop, ending in a taper over the right part of E?"

  body: "Nina: I'll check that, though it's probably a rendering issue. I need to
    show the client and figure out the palette of colors where it will be placed in
    the town. There is talk of recreating it via a tile mosaic, so I might just be
    supplying the outlines to her.\r\n\r\neliason: Hmm, I'm not sure I understand
    your suggestion, but i'd like to try it. Would you care to do a quick sketch over
    what I have now?\r\n\r\nI'm also feeling like the O/S combo is too tight and evenly
    nestled together. Anyone else have any input on that?"

- body: "Is anyone else bothered by the overall shape and tilt? Why is the S and the
    o so much bigger than the Qu? The shape lacks finesse, and I fear it will be hard
    to insert into media without looking wonky. \r\n\r\nCurrently, it reminds me of
    a souffle about to collapse off to the right. Or perhaps a balloon in the midst
    of being blown up? Expanding puddle of molasses? A whipped-cream cornucopia? (Ok,
    I'll stop with the dopey visuals now, fun as it is. I think I'm hungry.)"

  body: I was also a little confused about the slant. I think that if the size is
    scaling bigger from left to right, the mark should either be perfectly horizontal
    OR more likeley diagonal, bottom-left to top-right.

- body: "Dave,\r\nI'm still struck by the odd slant and shape created by the scaling
    of the letters. It's especially glaring when you couple the logo with text. I
    couldn't stop myself from playing around with it, but I won't post my tweaked/revised
    version here; I'll email it to you (to the address on your website) from my yahoo
    account. I really think you'll like your beautiful (!!) lettering even more if
    you tweak away the slant. Right now, the oS feels kinda like it's being being
    sucked away by a vacuum cleaner.\r\nAK"

  body: "Dave,\r\n\r\nthis has come along nicely. Some small things, I agree with
    Alaskan on the slant and I am little 'confused' about the fitting of the letters
    - most have a very tight fit with even spacing, but ex. the top left stroke of
    the U doesn't wrap around the Q as I think it should. I hope you understand what
    I mean?"

- body: Great! It looks much, much better now, and it will be much easier to fit into
    typographic media. I did like the p in your last post better (4.Jun.2010 4.33pm)
    but it's fine this way, too. Congratulations - it's beautiful, polished work!
