  not sure im that happy with it... i like the weight, but some of the shapes arent
  really working for me... any suggestions?\r\n\r\nusing minion pro on the inside
  also... what do people generally think of discretionary ligatures in the body text?\r\n\r\ncheers\r\n\r\nDuncan"

  body: "thats quite nice, i really like H&FJ's design (Mercury grows on me more and
    more).\r\nI like the sharp 'N'  rather than the flattened scala 'N'."

  body: "That's what I found slightly off-putting with Scala Sans in this application,
    the flat footed N. I just think, for what seems to be a sophisticated film critique
    magazine, a sharp and crisp face would work better. I might have some further
    suggestions later, I'll have to look around a bit.\r\n \r\nAs for discretionary
    ligatures in body text, I wouldn't advise it. It can affect readability and can
    be a bit gaudy. The body text needs to be transparent.\r\n"

  body: "Or Futura/Avenir light. Geometric Sans are crisp allright.\r\n\r\nAs for
    the body text's transparency, I would totally agree with Geoff; but, really, it
    depends on the content and context. How wide would the text column be? Is this
    magazine going to be read quickly, or be savored like an old Cabernet? How sophisticated
    is the publication? What kind of movie would it cover? These are the kinds of
    questions that would need to be addressed before deciding upon the usage of discretionary
    ligatures.\r\n\r\nBut, like Mr. Riding, I'm totally leaning toward the usual choice."

  body: "Neutraface is really interesting, thanks for the link, and yeah i was thinking
    a futura geo' sans. I really like the other letters im using on the cover (the
    cap 'W', old style 'dropped' numbers). I think by the writing so far the mag would
    be read more than a few times, and it mainly covers art films and performance,
    so I thought discretionary ligatures could be a nice spice. Ill try to post some
    images of how its looking (the body text that is).\r\n\r\ncheers for the comments."

  body: thanks, yeah i agree, i think its about 90% there, but i'd  like to try and
    push and see if i can get it even further. at least if i go too far i can always
    go backwards :)

  body: "After a few wines, managed to get Kris to let me have a Karv masthead, cheers
    mate.\r\n\r\nfinal cover and a few details, sorry about the dodge photos. \r\n\r\nUsed
    Minion as the body, with headings in Mrs Eaves. Wasn't sure about Mrs Eaves, I
    know about the spacing issues, so would be hard to use as a really readable body
    text, but headings were ok. Captions in Scala sans worked nice with minion ( ahh,
    neo-humanists), its a pretty standard pairing, but standard for a reason i guess.
    Mrs Eaves small caps for headings... it just worked for me this time. Used Minion
    SC for body Subs.\r\n\r\nI wasn't so sure about mixing two serifs. the headings
    weren't to close to the body (literally), and it looked nice. I just kept in mind
    that it can be difficult to mix.\r\n\r\nThe back page had an ad for the NZ film
    commission, and managed to set it with serapion.\r\n\r\ncheers for the comments
    and help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Cover-002_6256.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Film_6314.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Detail-2_3506.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Detail_4654.jpg]"
