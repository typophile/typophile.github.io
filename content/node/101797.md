  body: "John, it's always interesting reading your pieces, and this one is intriguing
    as well, althought, paradoxically, on my screen it doesn't look good at all -
    in The Magazine site I see very long lines of text and no margins!\r\n\r\nThat
    said, about the specific issue of your article, the few reading experiences I
    had with e-books (even those made by corporate publishers) were disappointing.
    I wonder if there isn't a way to transfer (translate?) a book design layout made
    with, say, Indesign, to a tablet or an e-reader device, for example using the
    pdf format which still seems to be the best for rendering books layout (by the
    way, didn't Amazon introduce a sort of \"as printed\" e-books format?)"

    body: "Nicola \u2013 You can certainly do that, but then what you get is a <em>static</em>
      layout, which only works if you're viewing it on an appropriately sized and
      oriented screen. What I\u2019m talking about is <em>flexible</em>, adaptive
      layout. And having the tools to design that well."

  body: "Very clearly written and expressed, without being condescending - nicely
    done. I certainly agree that it's high time reading software took layout seriously.
    BTW, I like the \"return-from-footnote\" links!\r\n\r\nOne thing I'd love to see
    properly implemented is multiple columns. The main question there is: how do you
    reconcile that with vertical scrolling? Here's an idea: don't. Scroll <em>horizontally</em>
    instead! :-)  In fact the human existence -including our reading \"hardware\",
    from the acuity of the retina to the structure of the neck- is much stronger in
    the horizontal dimension. The ancient scroll was right on.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Hrant \u2013 Pagination based on the actual screen you\u2019re reading on
    would eliminate the need for \u201Cscrolling\u201D as we use it now. Instead,
    you\u2019d page down (or over) from one multi-column page (if that\u2019s appropriate
    to the screen size & shape) to the next. \r\n\r\nBut you\u2019re quite right that
    multiple columns on a \u201Cpage\u201D larger than the screen makes no sense whatsoever.
