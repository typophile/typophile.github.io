  here logo started out as? \r\n\r\nI myself am a type-torturer - by trade - for kids
  and youth bicycle logos in mass retail (grin) - so I'm ready to go to town on whatever
  font this is if needs be to match this Gatsby-esque look!\r\n\r\nThanks - in advance...\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nMArko\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Richmond_logo_5922.jpg]"
