  a standard OTF or TTF work fine? Naming procedures etc?\r\n\r\nThe font contains
  only one symbol.\r\n\r\nAnyone with knowledge like this?\r\n"

  body: What do you mean 'work in visual basic'? Visual basic is a programming language.
    Are you referring to rendered interfaces? Visual studio?

  body: "To be honest, I don\u2018t know what Visual basic is, more than that I am
    going to do a font that somehow is compatible with Visual Basic, so one can use
    the font when using(?) Visual basic. "

  body: "It sounds like you want to make sure that the symbol contained in your font
    can be rendered/displayed by an application written in Visual Basic.\r\n\r\nIf
    that's the case, then yes, a standard OTF or TTF should work just fine."

  body: "Well, that's like saying 'make a font work in English'. Since Visual Basic
    is a programming language written in English, as long as you have all the standard
    english characters, you'll be fine.\r\n\r\nThat said, I'm curious as to where
    this goal/request came from. I can't say I've ever felt a need to have a font
    just for use with my visual basic programming ;o)\r\n\r\nOtherwise, if you mean
    'rendered via a VB application' I guess that depends on the type of application.
    If it's a windows app, then you'd need a font compatible with windows. If it's
    a web app, though, then that's really not applicable."

  body: Yes, rendered by an application written in Visual Basic must be the goal here.

  body: Well, I suppose the simple answer is 'no' there's really nothing special you
    need to think about. It's going to use the standard font formats that windows
    uses.
