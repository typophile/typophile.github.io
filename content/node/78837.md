body: "Hey there all,\r\n\r\nI'm a new-to-Typophile print designer of the campus magazine
  at my uni. It's 16*23cm (~6.3*9 in) and there's plenty of content every month, so
  the space I can work with is really very limited. \r\n\r\nA recent idea of mine
  is to pair up Avenir and Chaparral Pro in this magazine. The former for titles,
  the latter for body text.\r\n\r\nWhat's your opinion of this combination? It would
  be great to hear what you think as I'm in no way an expert on print design. The
  way I see it, this solid slab serif provides good readability (which is a key factor
  for me here) and Avenir complements it really well, with the diverse weights and
  whatnot.\r\n\r\nSamples:\r\n[[http://i56.tinypic.com/nx9rut.jpg|Regular 1]]\r\n[[http://i53.tinypic.com/16hp01j.jpg|Regular
  2]]\r\n[[http://i51.tinypic.com/28v4vas.jpg|Light 1]]\r\n[[http://i54.tinypic.com/ak7fqb.jpg|Light
  2]]\r\n\r\nLight or regular? Thoughts in general?\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n\r\nTaking
  penn's advice, here's a PDF sample of the [[http://konyveim.com/tatkontur_reg.pdf|regular]],
  and the [[http://konyveim.com/tatkontur_light.pdf|light]] version.\r\n\r\nNick,
  I will try a 3-column design, I'm just worried that it'll be too cramped to be read
  comfortably (approximately ~1.8 inches per column)."

  body: It would probably be better if you could post pdfs of your examples as there
    is some strange coloring going on due to the anti-aliasing of the white text on
    the black background. From what I can see it looks like a nice pairing.

  body: "I would go to three columns and less leading.\r\nThat seems more like a magazine,
    less bookish/brochurey.\r\nAlso, never run body text across a halftone, even if
    faded.\r\nYou might want to consider adding some lighter weights in the heads
    (possibly of Chaparral) to spice up the visual interest."
