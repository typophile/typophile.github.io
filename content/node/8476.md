    Bold</a> or <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=204524">Memo
    Medium</a>. The &#39;R&#39; and &#39;S&#39; make me think Elan is a better choice,
    but the &#39;A&#39; looks closer to Memo. A lot of tweaking was done to the letters
    though &#40;the &#39;P&#39; may be based on a &#39;D&#39;, &amp;c.&#41; <BR> <BR>
