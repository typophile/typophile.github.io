    a look at Simon Schmidts custom version &#40;not  for sale though&#41;. <BR><a

  body: Thanks again. <BR>The type that says &#34;monaco&#39; is Horatio, right? <BR>The
    kerning has been altered, though. <BR>If not, please advise me of a better match.
    <BR>Thanks in advance. <BR> <BR>Kind Regards, <BR>FS

    Horatio</a> it is indeed, with negative kerning.

    BTW Which weight do you think it is?

    target="_blank"> too light</a> and this is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/horatio/bold/testdrive.html?s=monaco%3F%20too%20bold&amp;p=72"
    target="_blank"> too bold</a>. Then again, I could be wrong. What other weights
    are there for Horatio?

  body: Or they could have done that MM-magic with Illustrator&#39;s interpolation
    tool. I&#39;ve tried that before, and with some typefaces it&#39;s possible. You&#39;ve
    got to be extra careful though and double-check if all data points are corresponding.
    <BR> <BR>And it&#39;s certainly not improbable that they&#39;ve gone through a
    bit of customizing for the band&#39;s name. Just like they probably did for Shakira&#39;s...

    catchy name Yves came up with for his band. No, I think that name has been trailing
    Yves for quite some time...
