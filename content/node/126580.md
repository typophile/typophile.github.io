body: "Hello there!\r\nI have a client who had some notepads printed up about 10 years
  ago. They love the typeface that was used. They want to do new notepads as well
  as other items, but they want to add additional names, etc. They do not recall where
  they had these done.\r\n\r\nI have been to every font matching site i can find (whatthefont,
  fontsquirrel, fontspring etc), i've used the \"find my font\" program, spent an
  inordinant amount of time on identifont, bowfin and search by sight, as well as
  looking through every typeface book i could get my hands on. I am at a loss.\r\n\r\nAny
  insights here would be appreciated.  According to the salesperson here at work,
  they are not really open to changing the style. So i would prefer to match but i
  am also a realist and if i could present something with a similar feel that might
  help.  \r\n\r\nThank you so much!!"
