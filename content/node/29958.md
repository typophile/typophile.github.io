  While there, I was hoping to go on a bit of a type tour - looking at places and
  things of typographic significance.\r\n\r\nWhat suggestions of places and things
  to see do people have? This may be an interesting list to make into a sticky post
  too.\r\n\r\nThings I'm thinking of are:\r\n\r\ntype foundries\r\npresses\r\nmuseums\r\ntypographers
  birth places/places of work\r\nexamples of fonts\r\n\r\netc.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    & Albert Museum, London\r\nmaybe the University of Reading, UK\r\n\r\nGutenberg
    Museum, Mainz, Germany\r\nKlingspor Museum, Offenbach, Germany (depending on the
    exhibition, at least)\r\nLots of bookstores in Berlin\r\n\r\nPlantin\u2013Moretus
    Museum, Antwerp\r\n\r\nRome (all of it)\r\nbut I particularly enjoy the lettering
    at Santa Maria in Trastevere, the Vatican, St Paul's Outside the Walls, and the
    Forum\r\n\r\nFlorence (all of that, too)\r\nBut Santa Croce may have the most
    lettering"

    Both feature Roman sarcophagi and tombstones inscribed with text and all sorts
    of crazy custom ligatures, IIRC most of the Roman goodies date from ~0 to ~1000
    AD.\r\n\r\nAnd I second the notion of digging deep into Florence. It's an amazing
    place."
