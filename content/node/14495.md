  body: "I have to admit that only recently I got to know about the existence of Adobe
    Proxy, although the first issue dates back from November 2004.\r\n\r\nThe nice
    thing is, each issue has a section about Type, among other interesting and helpful
    topics. I would like to highlight two articles which I found particularly appealing:\r\n--
    Secrets of the Glyph palette, <em>by Thomas Phinney</em> (Vol. I, No. 3)\r\n--
    The Making of Garamond Premier, <em>by Robert Slimbach</em> (Vol. II, No. 2)\r\n\r\nAlso,
    a related thread: <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/15041\">Expressing yourself
    with nonexpressive type</a>"
