    that it reflects the order in which you designed/pasted the glyphs.\r\n\r\nIf
    this is true, the way to fix it is going to the Index mode and drag and drop until
    you get the desired order.\r\n\r\nGood luck!"

    \u0153 are together, why doesn\u2019t happen the same with \xC6 and \xE6? Why
    questiondown is so far from question, exclam or exclamdown? Why \xDD and \u0178
    are separated? Why dotlessi is separated from the other i characters [\xEC \xED
    \xEE \xEF]? Etc.\r\n\r\nI know this is the Unicode order, but it\u2019s pointless
    from the user perspective."

  body: 'Good point. In fact, I''m going to completely reverse my advice. Don''t order
    by Unicode: where there''s the option for the user to select glyph order, they
    can choose Unicode order if they want. Therefore it makes little sense to have
    the GID order the same. Order it in a way that makes sense to you as suggested
    first of all.'

  body: I think you can create a custom order, save it and then import it into all
    your fonts so you don't have to reorder them every time by hand. Or at least that's
    what the 'save encoding' button indicates to me??

  body: "I think that after creating the custom encoding that Bendy mentions, then
    loading it up and activating that encoding in the Names mode, you can use Glyphs
    > Sort Glyphs > by Encoding to get the GIDs ordered the same as your custom encoding.
    Anything outside the range of your encoding stays in the order it was (which is
    the order of creation by default).\r\n\r\nI think that's how it works. Been a
    while since I did this.\r\n\r\nYou can create a custom encoding in a text editor
    (easier than moving glyphs around by hand)."

    did nothing to any 230-odd glyphs with Unicode, and also did try not to affect
    them. I only used 'liga' script.
