  is proud to introduce Rue Display, an organic, casually ornamental, narrow-faced
  sans serif designed by Winnie Tan. \r\n\r\nRue's spirited and exploratory design
  is the materialization of a feeling about fonts as a family of organisms taking
  on a life of its own, in work and play. It was conceived as a typeface, used as
  an image and discovered as an ornament. \r\n\r\nIt comes in 10 weights of light,
  regular, medium, semibold and bold, each with italics.\r\n\r\nGET RUE DISPLAY NOW

  body: I guess Italics count as a separate weight and why not?

  body: To my mind, calling italics separate weights is an abuse of the term, albeit
    one that is frequently encountered. Italics are separate cuts, but not separate
    weights from their roman counterparts with the same heaviness. Just my opinion...
