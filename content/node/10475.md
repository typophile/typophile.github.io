body: Can anyone recommend some Thai or Farsi fonts? Right now I just need them as
  place holders for a design concept. If the design gets approved we&#39;ll get actual
  translations and typesetting done. <BR> <BR>Thanks

  body: 'I don&#39;t know a lot about Thai typography, but IMHO these are some decent
    Thai fonts for long copy - e.g., they have the loops on them &#40;font followed
    by vendor&#41;: <BR> <BR>Thonburi &#40;Apple Singapore&#41; <BR>Iris &#40;Unity
    Progress&#41; <BR>Merrimia &#40;Unity Progress&#41; <BR>Eucrosia &#40;Unity Progress&#41;

    &#40;JS Technology&#41; <BR> <BR>If I&#39;m not mistakem, Iris and Eucrosia are
    installed on Windows machines that are set up for Thai. And there&#39;s always
    the work-horse Angsana which comes bundled with Windows too. Decent headline fonts
    in Thai...Lily &#40;UPC&#41; and Imperial &#40;PSL SmartLetter&#41; are &#34;sans&#34;-style
    faces. I think Kobori is what you see on most of the newspapers. And when I was
    there, I saw Siara &#40;PSL&#41; and Pumpuang &#40;JS&#41; used quite a bit in
    advertising. They&#39;re highly latinized faces, complete with serifs if you&#39;re
    into that sort of thing. <BR> <BR>Hope this helps.'

  body: Very helpful, yes. Thank you. I should have mentioned that these are not text
    settings, just a few isolated words.

  body: Farsi, of course, uses the Arabic script.  I don&#39;t know off-hand what
    the best Arabic fonts are, but a few of the OpenType fonts that come with Windows
    have Arabic glyphs.  You will need an editor that allows right-to-left text input.

    target="_blank"> VOLT</a> &#40;Visual OpenType Layout Tool&#41;, the supplemental
    files contain a <i>really</i> nice Arabic font complete with substitution tables
    for initial, medial, final, and isolate forms, mark positioning, ligatures, etc.

  body: 'Actually, the version of the Arabic Typesetting font that is available with
    VOLT is a pretty early alpha version. It&#39;s been completely redesigned since
    then, and a lot of new stuff has been added. The new version, however, will not
    be available as a sample font from the VOLT community: it will be shipping with
    future MS products.  <BR>  <BR>Another thing to bear in mind is that not every
    Arabic typeface is appropriate for setting Farsi text, even if the Farsi character
    set is supported. There are long-standing stylistic preferences among users of
    what is nominally the Arabic script, and fonts that are appropriate for use in
    Arabic text in, for example, Egypt are not appropriate for Urdu text in Pakistan.
    I&#39;m afraid I do not know enough about Farsi to identify the stylstic differences
    between Farsi and Arabic type styles, but I know they are significant enough for
    Farsi users to have requested a distinctively Farsi font from Microsoft, despite
    the availability of numerous Arabic fonts.'

    type than I do about Thai.:-&#41;

    <BR> <BR>From what I&#39;ve seen most laymen can work with both styles fine -
    the picky ones are those in the field, like us! :-/  But one clear functional
    difference are the numerals: the 4 is totally different, and the 5 has... buttcheaks
    in the Farsi incarnation. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'
