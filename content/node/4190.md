  body: When are we going to be able to register for Typecon online? On the <a href="http://www.typecon2004.com/"
    target="_blank">Typecon</a> website, it says online registration will be available
    by the end of March. My calendar says it&#39;s almost mid-April. What&#39;s the
    deal? I want to give you my money, Typecon!

    working like mad to get the registration system ready. It will be up soon, very
    soon! 20 workshops this year! More details to come shortly. Guaranteed, this is
    going to be the best TypeCon ever. <BR> <BR>And although we will miss John and
    Yves, congrats on the new arrivals coming soon! Must be something in the air,
    as there are several other type folks expecting little ones late June through
    early August. We&#39;ll expect to see them in attendance at TypeCon2005 <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> It&#39;s never too early to get those little Typophiles
    started on the path to typographic enlightenment.

  body: Thanks all for your warm wishes! <BR> <BR>To answer your question Yves, as
    near as I can convert with Google tools, 3.312 kgs is what she weights . . . <BR>
    <BR>And she&#39;s 49.53 cm long . . . <BR> <BR>Overall a pretty average to petite
    sized little girl! A good sleeper to boot! &#40;. . .so far, knock on wood!&#41;
    <BR> <BR>Regarding the Typecon tie-in, you got to start &#39;em early! BTW, had
    it been a boy, he may have had the name Pilcrow for a middle name! Just sounds
    cool to me :D

    a more interesting question is What is it about September? &#40;Conceived at ATypI,
    born at TypeCon, perhaps? You see what I&#39;m getting at . . . &#41; <BR> <BR>--
