body: "I posted this a few years ago and received two responses, Trade Gothic bold
  condensed No.20  and Alternate Gothic No.2, these two are close but neither the
  same font. See the curves of the R in particular. Would love to finally identify
  this font,\r\n\r\nTrade Gothic\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/trade-gothic/\r\n\r\nAlternate
  Gothic No.2\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/alternate-gothic-lt/\r\n\r\nHope
  someone can help,\r\n\r\nIf anyone knows the other font in all caps that would be
  great too. Bonus points :)\r\n\r\nThanks everyone"
