body: Could anybody please explain to me why helvetica has a double storey a but single
  storey g? I am sure there are other typefaces that might do this but helvetica is
  so widely used I wondered why it is like that. I have been trying to find out the
  whole storey (!) of the lower case a and g as they seem to be the only two letters
  that have a commonly accepted alternate that all english readers recognise without
  problem, and maybe without even noticing. Thank you.

  body: "My old 1958 Encyclopedia of Typefaces says that grotesks that follow the
    German or continental model use a single storey 'g' while grotesques that follow
    the traditional English pattern use a double storey 'g'. This difference is the
    basis of grotesque (double storey) and neo-grotesque (single storey) as separate
    classifications (see the BS:2961 in the back of Rookledges Typefinder). The double
    storey version is older - essentially 19th century, rather than mid-20th century.\r\n\r\nYes
    its true that AG set the norm for German grotesks (see also Venus, Folio, Reform
    Grotesk et al) but I have also seen that variant of AG that includes a single
    storey 'a'..."

  body: "Thank you so much for your help. I didn't know about the continental vs English
    aspect. I have followed the single storeys from script to italic type and through
    to more general use via modernist faces and am starting to look at use as infant
    forms for children's books although why that began I don't know.\r\n\r\np.s Dezcom,
    sorry to disappoint, I know very little about opera, I like some snippets. The
    Cosi comes from an old college project, I quite liked the sentiment behind the
    phrase, it always provokes discussion."

  body: Hi, yes I believe you are right about following handwriting forms into print
    but some research does suggest the double deckers are better for letter differentiation.
    I guess familiarity has a strong link to recognition too which is perhaps why
    the two forms have happily co-existed.

    on Akzidenz Grotesque. The black letters seem to always have a more or less one
    story g (a hair line closes it), and often a two story a. The English Johnston,
    with Underground and the American Benton, with Franklin, did the two story g because
    of no blackletter influence. '
