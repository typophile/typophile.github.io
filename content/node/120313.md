  body: "Your sample is a bit low-res for an accurate match. It closely resembles
    Optima:\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/optima_pro_bold/ot_ps/specimen/tester/\r\n\r\nBut
    I haven't been able to find an Optima-like typeface with a left-facing serif at
    the apex of the A.\r\n\r\nThese two fonts (which are basically identical) by Steve
    Jackaman also come close:\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/creative_alliance/castle_book/pc_tt/specimen/tester/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/salzburg-rr/\r\n\r\nSame
    for this font, which came bundled with Windows 7:\r\nhttp://www.whatfontis.com/IrisUPC-Bold.font?text=DATACOM\r\n\r\nAlso
