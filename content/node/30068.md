    and mysql-database ;)\r\nThe guys which \"host and code\" typophile.com know what
    i'm talking about.\r\n\r\nIf you write in your comment-textfield, you can format
    visual paragraphs manually, with your enter-key (hardbreak). This could create
    &lt;br&gt; or &lt;br /&gt; or new paragraphs &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; (that is what
    i was  talking about). This is a descision of the programmers. If you create paragraphs
    instead of &lt;br&gt;-Elements you can give them a dynamic-id, if you want to.
    If it has an identifier you can work with it, like i mentioned before, ie you
    can link directly to a specific paragraph, within a posting, within a thread.\r\nIf
    you don't get what i trying to describe, i can make a (static) example on my webspace
    if i have the time. (sorry, my english...)\r\n- short said, i mean, it's possible
