body: 'Just now, I was walking to the basement restrooms of a local library, when
  a certain dolphin and anchor caught my eye. On display, opposite some vending machines
  is an Aldine octavo. It is open to the printer''s device, so I don''t know what
  the work is. However, judging from the call no. penciled in on the inside, it appears
  to be from 1534. It is in a regular glass display case (not sealed) with a cheapo
  display case lock. Doesn''t this deserve better treatment? An Aldus Manutius printing
  is more than just an old book (at least to a typophile). Should I mention this to
  the library staff? '

    that the book is special, and if you spotted it, it could just as easily be spotted
    by a book thief. '

    it is. I was similarly astounded to see the exhibit put out for Typecon at the
    Buffalo Central library with minimal security: A Shakespeare first folio, A Kelmscott
    Chaucer and  a few other gems.'

  body: 'They know what it is,probably; a first edition of Ginsberg''s Howl is sitting
    nearby. I have to wonder if they simply don''t have the proper storage. I am of
    the opinion that some things are better of being given to an institution that
    can properly store them. I''m sure this library will disagree, but it should probably
    be brought up. '
