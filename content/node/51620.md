  that will work in arabic, hebrew, greek and such like. Basically languages that
  dont use english letters for the alphabet? Russian and greek too. Unfortunately
  my knowledge of opentype/cycrillic fonts is minimal (if indeed that is relevant)
  so any help/pointers would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n"

  body: "The Helvetica World fonts, to which Si links, should meet all your needs
    except perhaps Arabic. The fonts do contain Arabic support, but the design of
    the Arabic is not harmonised to Helvetica in the way that the other scripts are
    (it is a revised version of the Yakout simplified Arabic design). Also, in order
    to fit the Arabic into the vertical metrics of the existing Latin design, without
    compromising backwards compatibility or clipping the Arabic descenders, the Arabic
    has a raised baseline.\r\n\r\nIf you need Arabic as well as the other scripts,
    I would recommend getting Helvetica World for everything else but using another
    font for the Arabic."
