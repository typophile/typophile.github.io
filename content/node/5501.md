    Strangelove <BR>The Deep End <BR>Brazil <BR>Alien <BR>Mars Attacks! <BR>Monty
    Python and the Holy Grail <BR> <BR>I&#39;m sure some of these are just because
    I like the film, but just about any of them I would enjoy watching just the opening.'

  body: Thnx Ignacio... I&#39;ll hafta check those out. <BR> <BR>I wanted to put Monsters
    Inc. on my list too, I think it&#39;s cuz it&#39;s got that same feel as Charade
    with the general feeling being more fun and not so much mystery/suspense.

  body: It&#39;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World has an extremely long animated opening
    by Saul Bass. Probably the longest opening he did. It&#39;s a very long movie,
    so I guess it&#39;s appropriate.

    it to prove themselves for <i>Matrix</i> funding, a hyper-noir lesbian crime drama,
    great 3D type intro. <BR> <BR>I have other favorites, but they&#39;ve been mentioned

    President's Men\" with Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman, where the opening credits
    sequence is an extreme closeup of typewriter keys smashing onto paper and the
    closing shot is a teletype printout confirming Richard Nixon's resignation:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/APM

    images of typewriter bashing paper in slow motion with huge reverberating sound
    was dynamite.
