body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Crs_sample_3899.jpg]\r\n\r\nCrisis was
  designed and generated completely on one single day. The target was to make a useful
  font while investing nothing more than the absolutely indispensable. The component-based
  glyph construction scheme of another font has been utilized, further detailing work
  has been strictly limited. Due to those restrictions some letters have rather unusual
  shapes. \r\nHowever, because of the production limitations Crisis will be offered
  at an unbeatable rate. It is equipped with 320 glyphs and comes with all accented
  letters needed for any European language. Crisis has compact proportions, it is
  very legible even when set in small sizes. In printing you get more text on one
  page and thus save up to 30% of paper.\r\n\u2013 Coming soon at Myfonts.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Crs_alphabet_5684.jpg]"

    work -- when in the morning did you start and when did you finish? :-)

    started at six in the morning (most unusual for me, but I was awake this night
    by 3.am), and finished about 8.pm. A few nimor adjustments have been made the
    other day."
