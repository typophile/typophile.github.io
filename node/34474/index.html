<p>Where did you get that number? From what I know, it&rsquo;s way too large.
Note for example that typical ink bleed is one mil (1/1000 inch) and
that&rsquo;s very easily visible. Furthermore you seem to be confusing micro
differentiation with something huge like slant.</p>
<p>Also, this type of &ldquo;limit&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t account for the

A slant of 1 degree (like in Syntax) is known to be easily

<p>Where did you get that number?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is what I saw in at the Museum of Printing in their Mergenthaler Linotype library. In their measured drawings they would go down to quarters of a thousandth, but not below that&ndash;IIRC that&rsquo;s what Larry Oppenberg told me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ink bleed one mil (1/1000 inch) and
that’s very easily visible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>1/4 of a thousandth is of course four times smaller, and that, they assume, is visible. It&rsquo;s below that amount they didn&rsquo;t bother with.</p>
<p>Now that I think of it, that limit might have been their limit control over the pantographic punch cutter, and not the limit of what the eye can see.</p>
<p>So I may be wrong and you can go finer. I still suspect you are near the visible limit with two units in a 1000 unit em at 12 points&ndash;particularly when you are not talking about stem width but with a 2 unit slant over a distance of say 400 units.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m doing my math right, then Goran&rsquo;s slant&ndash;if this is at x-height&ndash;is about the same as Syntax&rsquo;s, which is 1/2 of a degree. And that you can feel rather than see at text sizes, right? So I would think that&rsquo;s about the detectable limit. If this is at cap height I think you might not see it at 12 point.</p>

<p>I think you&rsquo;re assuming a 2-unit difference along the entire 1000 Em height, while I suspect Goran is talking about that difference just along the height of that glyph, which I would guess is about half the Em height. Which adds up, since I got 1 degree (double yours) using a visual measurement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>that you can feel rather than see at text sizes, right?</p>

<p>Well, Seria Italic has an -average- slant of 1/2 a degree, and I think Majoor would tell you it&rsquo;s visible. But I&rsquo;m not sure how to differentiate &ldquo;feel&rdquo; and &ldquo;see&rdquo; here&hellip; Certainly if you ask a person to estimate the slant he can&rsquo;t do it; but if you set totally upright text next to 1/2-degree-slanted text and ask a person to concsiously choose which one is slanted I&rsquo;m pretty sure he can, even at like 12 point.

<p>Visually they both represent the same stem-feeling I want. They look more different when you see the point placement here than they do when you look at the letter in the preview window or on print. Visually there is so small difference that I can be happy with either of them.</p>

<p>If we are talking about an x-height character at say 400 units, then the ratio away from vertical (horizontal to vertical) is 2/400, which is .005.</p>
<p>An angle of .3 degrees has that tangent of .005.</p>

<p>.00025 inch was the finest machining tolerance that Mergenthaler Linotype Co. worked to. This was, of course, a very precise tolerance at that time. The company made a big deal about it. And I recall reading an article about MLCo. precision being touted in an engineering newsletter (<cite>The Scovill Standard</cite>).</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know if you can extrapolate from this tolerance anything about limits of human visual detection.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if the pantographic cutter had anything to do with that lower limit. I believe the cutter was probably the primary device in the manufacturing and machining process. But I don&rsquo;t know if it was the limiting factor. I suppose that .00025 may have been the diameter of the smallest cutter. But this would take research to confirm.</p>

<p>OK.
Personally I would do the right one, but place the points at the maxima:
about 3/4 of the way up on the left, and 3/4 of the way down on the right.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a huge deal, and there might very well be other mechanical
or operational reasons (like William&rsquo;s auto-Bold point) that push the decision in a different direction.</p>

<p>edit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>try estimating it via photoshop</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are vectors, so the calculations are relevant to what you will get in print. The Photoshop rounding by pixel might be misleading.</p>
<p>Oh, and the diameter of the cutter it seems to me isn&rsquo;t the only factor. It might be that though they couldn&rsquo;t route out a very tight radius, they could control &lsquo;wobble&rsquo; of the cutting line down to .00025. That would be relevant to something like a back slant of that dimension.</p>

<p>The indication of back slant was, IIRC, at the left most point of the stem, where the top of the f started to bend forward.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Will you please stop denying it’s ~1 degree?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If it&rsquo;s less than 1/2 degree, and the math says .2- .3 degrees, one would normally not round up and call it one degree. If anything one would round down and call it 0. It is perfectly valid to go with it, but I thought Goran might want to know it was less than he seemed to think.</p>
<p>By &lsquo;wobble&rsquo; I mean eg that when drawing a straight vertical line, the cutter would not vary more than .00025 to the right or left.</p>

<p>That makes more sense &ndash; .00025 would be pretty dang small for a cutter. Can you imagine?</p>
<p>BTW, I dug up that article. The drawings were done to .00025, but it turns out the margin of error on machining was smaller. Here&rsquo;s an excerpt from Griffith:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The matrix in its final form represents over sixty manufacturing operations alone. Each matrix must pass through more than half a hundred examinations and inspections before it goes out to the printer.

<p>No, I think you insist on measuring the wrong thing, or in the wrong way. What you should measure is the slant in FontLab, or in print, not in photoshop or a gif.</p>
<p>One of my whacky prejudices is that trigonometry is true.</p>
<p>If the difference is of 2 units over 400 then the tangent&ndash;the slope&ndash;in degrees is .3. 
Even if the difference is 3 units over 400, then the slant in degrees is still less than .5 degrees.</p>
<p>And FontLab reflects that in their not showing 1 degree in the measuring line, as you can see. The line below is 400 units high, and the top node is 2 units to the right of the bottom. Try it yourself.</p>

<p>Well then I guess it&rsquo;s not over 400!</p>
<p>Because if it were, a visual check would not indicate a 1 degree slant.
Lacking the actual vector data, the way I&rsquo;m measuring it is the least
error-prone. Your calculations are based on an unfounded assumption
about the height.</p>
<p>Do this: measure the X and Y distances between the leftmost points.* You get 8 and 439. The arc-tangent of 8/439 = ~1.04 degrees. Interestingly, the X pixel distance between the two tangent points is in fact 2! Maybe that&rsquo;s the number Goran was providing. And their Y distance is 120. Not 400. With the arc-tangent of 2/120 being ~0.95 degrees.</p>
<ul>
<li>Even though it&rsquo;s not a straight line, that&rsquo;s still what it translates to in slant.</li>

<p>That is a reasonable assumption, it seems to me. If this is the bottom of an i, it would be x height, and 400 is a small x-height. If it&rsquo;s an upper case I or and l the height would be bigger still, and the slope less.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>You don&rsquo;t have to speculate. Goran said &ldquo;about two steps on the grid in FontLab&rdquo;. As I said even with three units it would be less than half a degree.</p>
<p>You persist in not measuring it in FontLab, which is the relevant measure.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is a silly argument. Goran can tell us the grid numbers, and that&rsquo;s all there is to know, basically.</p>

<p><cite>Ah, now I see that you are talking only about the points in the mid section—not the whole stem.</cite></p>
<p>No I was talking about the whole stem (as a whole) – but then of course – the top of that stem (which was in fact only an example) was moving slowly to become thicker at the endings, so there the angle increases all the time the closer you get to the top ;-)</p>
<p>Russ – Yeah, I should have done that, but the whole &ldquo;problem&rdquo; has to do with the appearence of the stems in smaller sizes, and how the hinting is working with the stems – which one is better at a small size, etc. So the angle is the key, but the number of the angle was not important.</p>
<p>If the letter was upright, I wouldnt have to post the question, because it’s so much easier with straight lines and how they appear on screen etc.

<p>Goran, you should probably read up on hinting to get a sense of how it works and what will happen in a case like yours. I hope you are solving this problem before drawing the whole character set; that is the wise thing to do. It&rsquo;s difficult to predict results until you test things out; the only guess I have is that autohinted stems will appear thinner than they are at low res. Still, hinting tools will give you an opportunity to choose the preferred stem weights, so undesirable thinning would not have to occur.  Are you interested in hinting (consistent stem weights at low res/small sizes)? If not, either method of construction you show should be fine, since they both give the shape you want.</p>
<p>If hinted performance is a major concern, I suggest you change the construction so that there are points on extrema. The simplest way to do that would be to add them to your simpler stem (shown on the right in your first image). Unfortunately FontLab is not good at doing this automatically; if you could use Fontographer to &ldquo;add points to extrema&rdquo; automatically, it would be quick and pretty accurate. Then you wouldn&rsquo;t have to re-draw each stem.</p>
<p>For other examples of slightly angled stems see Eras, which has flared stems as well, and Syntax, whose stems are not flared.</p>
<p>It hasn&rsquo;t been mentioned, and you seem certain of the need for this slight angle in the stems, but have you examined whether the angle is really necessary? Could you instead get a leaning effect by making the flares asymmetrical? You could also massage the shape slightly so that you don&rsquo;t need any additional points; if the top left and bottom right corners had bezier handles that are perfectly vertical. This image shows that construction and its filled appearance.</p>

<p>Goran, I took your &lsquo;about two steps in FontLab&rsquo; to be about the position of the topmost points in your glyph relative to the bottommost points. If that were so, then the slant of the glyph would be less than half a degree. But the points you are evidently referring to in the &lsquo;two steps&rsquo; are the upper and lower set of central points where the straight line is. If I get it right now, the top and bottom most points are clearly shifted further relative to each other, more than the two units of the middle set, in order to continue the same slope.</p>
<p>As to the straight lines, I don&rsquo;t think there is any technical problem, which is why nobody has come forward. It may be that you will get &lsquo;kinks&rsquo; using Multiple Master or Superpolater in creating multiple weights, but I don&rsquo;t really know.</p>
<p>Edit: Just saw Carl&rsquo;s post. Thanks, I was hoping you&rsquo;d post because of your great experience doing the tapered stems of Beorcana! So hinting is the main question&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>FontLab is not good at doing this automatically</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Carl, in FontLab, I use Font Audit to identify extrema, and click on &lsquo;fix&rsquo; where I want to have an extremum. Are you saying that Font Audit doesn&rsquo;t identify and place extrema accurately?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks Carl for such nice explanation. I have experimented with this all day now, and I think I will end up with the extrema points after all – and only them. It can produce the look I want, and it also makes the AFDK Autohinting results better. Btw, I am not a hinting expert, but slowly learning this (I think&hellip;).</p>
<p>What I noticed, when having two tangents on each side of the stem, was that in some sizes on screen, it sort of flipped out. The letter looked like two straight stems that was shifted a little bit apart from each other. With this solution, it looks good both with or without hinting.</p>

<p>FontLab also has the feature allowing you to select outlines, or bunches of characters, and apply the &ldquo;add points to extrema&rdquo; function. This is the function that seems petulant in that it simply won&rsquo;t add a point if the extrema isn&rsquo;t really obvious. A case like Goran&rsquo;s is exactly what FL won&rsquo;t reliably handle. Using the FontAudit function might be more accurate (if so, why?), but it would take a lot longer, since you have to step through the glyphs.</p>
<p>Fontographer had a magical ability to clean up points and add points to extrema without mangling the intended shape, and it does this operation on any number of outlines you want. Someday&hellip;.  ;)</p>
<p>Goran, I think you found the best solution. It allows you to apply hinting, which you can control somewhat, without changing the original design. I like this as an example of maintaining fidelity to a design; getting PS outlines to obey the drawings, not the reverse.</p>

<p>Oh, I see what you mean. When I use the &lsquo;fix&rsquo; in fontaudit, it does often mangle the shape when when it adds the extremum,though my feeling is that it does get the extremum at the right place.</p>
<p>When I do this I paste the glyph to mask first, and then correct the messed up shape back to the mask by hand; it would be great if it restored the original shape too. I also do it step by step instead of control-e, as that kind of gets out of hand, and sometimes I don&rsquo;t want to do them all, and I have to correct anyway. It sounds like in Fontographer all that work around is not necessary.</p>

<p>Which it very well could be, if the height were about 110. Goran&rsquo;s original screenshot shows a lateral separation of 8, which is what you would get at a zoom of 400%! But anyway in no case has any assumption about the <cite>height</cite> on our part been safe.</p>

<p>In my first post of June 15 I suggested what Carl later said about extrema:
&ldquo;Personally I would do the right one, but place the points at the maxima:
about 3/4 of the way up on the left, and 3/4 of the way down on the right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hrant you are reading stuff into my comment that isn&rsquo;t there.  I wasn&rsquo;t discussing the suggestion of putting points at extrema.</p>
<p>Because Goran still expressed the desire for help on something &lsquo;technical&rsquo; <em>after</em> your post, I figured he had been looking for some kind of &lsquo;technical&rsquo; information that hadn&rsquo;t been discussed yet. Since he responded to Carl&rsquo;s post positively, I now think what he was looking for is the impact on hinting, which hadn&rsquo;t been discussed before.</p>
<p>Carl&rsquo;s discussion of the various options was interesting also.</p>
