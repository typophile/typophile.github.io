  \r\n\r\nI am really happy about the UNIQUE part of the logo, but not 100% convinced
  about the additional characters i drew for WORLD. I feel there might be a more elegant
  solution to the R and W. Also, i shortened the leg of the L to balance it - too
  much maybe?\r\n\r\nAs a reference, i also included the designs for different divisions
  within the company.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any input,\r\n\r\nSeb\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/uniqueworld_5090.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/uniquedivisions_5485.png]"

    is perhaps just a bit narrow. Widen in up a bit and see how it looks.\r\n\r\nThat
    said, if the brand is technicaly 'unique' and the rest is just a division identifier,
    I'd maybe not try to use the same typeface for the identifier. \r\n\r\n"

    the straight edge of the top counter at the top and have the curve bottom right
    and reflect the leg so that the curve is coming away from the character. For the
    W try making it wider, epsecially the lefthand half where the curve is slightly
    cramping the counter, you could also look at making it from the lefthand curved
    section repeated or constructing it from a similar shape as the O. I find myself
    reading the Q as D, I wonder if reflecting the tail so that the square corner
    is protruding might make it more Q-like. The L could be a little wider, but it
    might be that the width of the R and D are driving that.\r\nTim"

  body: "I like the 'UNIQUE' part as well. But the 'W' and the 'R' in 'WORLD' would
    slightly bother me, as they dont really seem to fit in there. <em>( Especially
    the 'R' looks too 'forced'. )</em> The 'W' could / should be wider. What about
    a small 'r', as you used a small 'e' before? A small 'r' may as well integrate
    better, because of the more open forms / shapes.\r\n\r\n<em>( Edit-A-Bit: By the
    way, none of the above posts / replies, including mine, showed up, when I posted
    my reply. Thanks to the Typophile Regular Errors and Outages. Broken. Its broooken.
    This site is sooo out of order, half of the time. )</em>\r\n\r\nDav"

  body: "i liked the identity, specially the UNIQUE part of the logo.\r\nIn upper
    one..you can align the middle stroke of the \"W\" to the top line(cap line).Im
    not happy with the \".EU\". and the \"R\" in the UNIQUE WORLD requires some corrections.
    Rest is very nice.\r\n"
