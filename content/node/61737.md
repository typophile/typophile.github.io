    font is listed as \"ZoeNeueSixtyB\". I assume that's custom.\r\nSux because now

    just for you is most of the time not allowed, i don t know if they ask the rights

    original one, you have exactly the same curves and same optical corection)... '

    used in the book isn't Unica, at least in it's original form. You can even tell
    by comparing the image I attached originally and your image.\r\n\r\nI have confirmation
    that it is a customised version of Unica. You'd think that someone who co-founded
    a type foundry would ask permission before editing someone else's typeface."

    can see a lot of illegal stuff even by typefoundry. It was just some bad thought\r\n\r\nBy
    the way Unica is a really nice typeface. and the graphic design work of Cornell
    is as usual great"

    to me. And of course, I am a huge fan of Herr Windlin's work.\r\n\r\nI didn't
    mean to accuse you of saying something you didn't, Ian. I do apologise if it came
    across that way! Cornel said that this customisation was done just for the work
    he's doing for the Schauspielhaus and unfortunately for altaira and myself, will
    not be available to anyone.\r\n\r\nThanks everyone for helping me identify this
