  body: "Thanks so much for that, Don. What a splendid scan!\r\n\r\nTo correct what
    I wrote: What I knew as Music Hall Text is actually Kirchengotische Schrift and
    was digitized by Aridi and Facetype (Aeronaut is an incredible set of layered
    fonts and is half off until June 27th!). Your type, Erica, is Favotir/Teuton text
    and was digitized by David Nalle as Rheingold."

    trying to identify all. They are very old... and really beautiful! "

  body: I just came across the Aridi font collection, which are simply named Aridi1
    through Aridi33, and most of which I recognise as commercial typefaces even though
    the Aridi collection was a free download. Are his versions pirated or just extremely
    similar to their commercial counterparts?
