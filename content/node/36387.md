body: "Maybe my judgment has gone askew, maybe i drank too much coffee, but even if
  i can't convince the client I want to know whether my heart is right or wrong. So
  please respond.\r\n\r\nSo currently in the first image they use Helvetica exclusively
  in all kinds of GIGANTIC SALE ways on their website. Actually more extended and
  condensed, but never anything in between.\r\n\r\nI really do heart Helvetica, but
  this is a candle company. They have Trajan in use in their identity and I just feel
  Helvetica has no place in their typographic repertoire. It's lack of character(at
  least relating to the company's aesthetic look) just grinds against my constitution
  as seen below. I think it just cheapens the look.\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\nRather
  do I give props to the same Helvetica, because it can look like a supermarket ad
  and just excuse it for use when they have a clearance(purely for the pervasive psychology
  and overuse of said typeface).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cc_home_6577.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese
  example of course doesn't have candles, but meant to be a seasonal theme(indian
  summer)in relation to new fall colours. The photo is just a test, so lets not focus
  on critiquing that. In use in the first image is the illustrious Sackers Gothic.
  I couldn't find the history of Sackers to back up any argument, but it has that
  retro, nostalgic feel that you'd find on an old 50's pickup in Door County, Wisconsin.
  At least to me. It may not be that old, but it's similar-looking fore fathers pass
  that nostalgia on don't they?\r\n\r\nSackers\r\n \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/home2_5074.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\nHelvetica\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/home3_5780.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall
  thoughts. The writing of this book is done.\r\n\r\n\r\njosh"

  body: I don't see why Helvetica <em>shouldn't</em> work with candles. Sure, it's
    overused and I wouldn't use Helvetica either, but with good choice of style, color
    and weight, Helvetica <em>could</em> work with candles.

  body: Maybe if you use one of the lighter weights. A bit more elegant. Although
    usually that reminds me more of.. fashion magazines or something.

    \u2013 especially if it is intended to sit on an image \u2013 and Helvetica offers
    a broad choice of weights and widths, Sackers Gothic doesn\u2019t. Linking choice
    with size, colour and placement (including ranging) is the job of the designer
    (typographer) \u2013 in your samples I am not convinced that either reach an optimum
    position, size or colour (in that order). If anything I would say that Trajan
    is the obvious (too obvious) choice.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "Helvetica (in all its forms) provides a lot of variety for character. So,
    I think it's doable. But I certainly wouldn't go to it first for something like
    this. Trajan is another typeface that gets beat up because it offers what it does
    so well, but is usually completely inappropriate for what it's used (or over-used)
    for.\r\n\r\nI think their original sample is generic as all hell and will numb
    the minds of consumers, but it's also not offensive. Their use of all lowercase
    letters helps to soften the Helvetica, whereas your sample uses neither the same
    cut of Helvetica, nor the same typographic treatment. It seems designed to fail.\r\n\r\nKnowing
    nothing else, it's hard to recommend anything, but if I had to <a href=\"http://www.yankeecandle.com/cgi-bin/ycbvp/retail.jsp\">guess
    who the client is</a>, I'd say go with what works best for the project and don't
    get hung up on using the same cut of Helvetica as they do on their site. They
    obviously don't cling to it too tightly."

  body: "Haha.\r\n\r\nChris you are pretty close, but not correct. I forgot that Yankee
    used Trajan as well.\r\n\r\nI'll make some attempts from the above advice to use
    some other weights of Helvetica and see if that works.\r\n\r\nI was using Avenir
    in various weights for another project. Anyone have any thoughts on that compared
    to using Helvetica without visual examples?"

    world. Ubiquitous, unassuming, inoffensive.\r\n\r\nOf course, this client wants
    SPECIAL candles that stand out, so I agree, scrap the Helvetica."
