  project, and I'd appreciate any help/pointer from everyone!\r\n\r\nSomeone pointed
  out that it's pretty similar to Palatino Linotype, which I think is quite true,
  so maybe it's a variation of Palatino?\r\n\r\nThank you so much for your time!\r\n\r\nHans\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font

  body: "Could be Garamond, definitely not Palatino. The counter of the \u2018e\u2019
    of Palatino is larger. Also the \u2018c\u2019 of Palatino has a serif top right
    and the \u2018t\u2019 of Palatino does not have the triangle top left. Posting
    a sample showing more characters would definitely be of help."

  body: Seconded on "a" Garamond, although there is no obvious match in size and spacing
    with Adobe Garamond Pro or Garamond Premier.
