  I was overjoyed when \r\nI discovered that his wonderful Iowan Old Style was included
  in Yosemite \r\n\u2014 in a \u201C.ttc\u201D format, which I don\u2019t quite understand,
  but with small caps and \r\nold style figures, which were lacking from my old Bitstream
  PS version.\r\nUnfortunately, these features don\u2019t seem to work in InDesign:
  the glyphs are \r\nvisible in the \u2018Glyphs\u2019 window, but can't be used unless
  you double-click on \r\nthe ones you need to typeset\u2026 Does anyone know what
  all this is about?\r\nThank you very much."

  body: These seem to work normally for me (Mac OS X 10.9.4/InDesign CC 2014) by highlighting
    the lower case text and selecting the small caps button or by selecting Small
    Caps from the Character palette sub-menu. Are those methods not working?

    are fake small caps, significantly smaller and thinner than the real ones accessed
    through the \u2018Glyphs\u2019 window."
