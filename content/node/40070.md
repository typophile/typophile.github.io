  in January... Do any of you have any\r\nrecommendations of manuscript, typography,
  and/or\r\nprinting museums that I should check out? I'm\r\nparticularly interested
  in incunabula and illuminated\r\nmanuscripts, but I'd love to visit some contemporary\r\nprint
  shops as well.\r\n\r\nThanks so much!\r\nGrendl.\r\n\r\np.s. Restaurant recommendations
  also welcome... and\r\napologies for the cross-posting."

    Diocletian, which contains the Epigraphical Department. Not all this came from
    there but a lot of it did.\r\n\r\nI saw this. http://www.flickr.com/photos/ebensorkin/sets/72157594336113040/\r\n\r\nI

    form Rome to Milan):\r\nhttp://www.mb-museobodoniano.it/museo.htm\r\nI am sure
    you know Giambattista Bodoni, anyway here is the wikipedia entry about him:\r\nhttp://www.mb-museobodoniano.it/museo.htm\r\n\r\nLast
    but not least, Parma is famous for food (Parmigiano Reggiano and Prosciutto (ham)
    di Parma above all) and there are a lot of nice places where to eat.\r\nMy suggestion
    for lunch is \"Sorelle Picchi\" (http://www.mytravelguide.com/restaurants/profile-79501805-Italy_Parma_Sorelle_Picchi.html)
    a nice and peculiar place, since the restaurant is in the backroom of a \"salumeria\"
    shop.\r\n\r\ne-mail me in private if you need more infos about my town.\r\n\r\n\r\nciao\r\nandrea"

    ;-) I was a poor college student when I went, so I didn't eat at any restaurants.
    However, there is a nice cafe in Scandicci (a suburb of Florence) called Bar Mario
    (or is it Cafe Mario?). It's just a coffee bar, really, but it's good.\r\n\r\nI
    went in 1999, and that was before I learned much about typography or took any
    design classes at all. There's a lot of great art to be found, especially in Florence:
    The Uffizi, Palazzo Pitti, L'Accademia..."

  body: "Hi all!\r\n\r\nI'm back from a great trip to Italy and I just wanted to thank
    everyone for their very helpful suggestions!\r\n\r\nThanks especially to Sauternes
    for recommending the Bodoni Museum in Parma (don't forget to call ahead and make
    an appointment if you go!) and to Eben Sorkin who recommended the amazing Epigraphic
    Museum in Rome. Oh my God! \r\n\r\nMy poor boyfriend nearly expired, as we had
    to stay there for hours! My only complaint was there wasn't quite enough information
    on the processes and tools involved in making the various inscriptions. Plus the
    lighting was often quite low, not a quality you want in a museum. But those gripes
    aside, the collection is outstanding.\r\n\r\nAnyways, grazie to everyone!!!!\r\nGrendl."

    pictures taken within its premises, and even if you manage to sneak some I believe
    you are forbidden from publishing them. \r\n\r\nI went there last june (I don\u2019t
    live too far) and since the visit was during a series of type design workshops
    they exceptionally let us take pictures but told us they were for personal use
    only. I took a few, but light conditions where very poor and I had to give up."
