  (spark or flash) is a new daring sans serif typeface by talented designer Tom Grace,
  who has already published two interesting typefaces with TypeTogether, the blackletter
  [[http://www.type-together.com/Givry|Givry]] and [[http://www.type-together.com/Aliz%C3%A9|Aliz\xE9]],
  a chancery italic.\r\nIskra, containing several width and weight variations, was
  conceived to challenge the limits between utilitarian and decorative. Sporting a
  low-contrast profile, it is a study of bridled energy in the Cyrillic and Latin
  scripts, and an oblique tribute to the less-predictable style of brush lettering.
  The first 14 styles will be available at the end of summer.\r\n\r\n"
