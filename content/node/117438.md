    the full story here:\r\nhttp://luc.devroye.org/fonts-54070.html\r\n\r\n<blockquote>A
    strange sports font story out of Oregon. The University of Oregon protects its
    font and its logo, a watered down version of Handel Gothic (a font by Don Handel,
    1965, and Robert Trogman, 1980). A local politician, Gordon Smith, started using
    an extremely similar font, and is being accused of font theft. Darrel Plant says
    it's a tempest in a teapot (and I tend to agree).</blockquote>"

  body: "Dig through the links and we find that the custom font _Belloti Bold_ a.k.a
    the \"Mike Belloti\" font was designed by Nike and it actually exists as a font
    rather than merely as custom letters. http://www.blueoregon.com/2008/06/the-gordon-smit/
    As for legal prohibitions on use of the letter designs, I have nothing to add
    to the Luc Devroye page mentioned by Fivos, except to recommend that for bizzare
    entertainment at length you follow Luc Devroye's link to \"David and Goliath\"
