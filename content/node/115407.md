  body: "I note from http://typophile.com/node/115135 that you are familiar with the
    big collection of Fraktur by Gerhard Helzel \r\nhttp://www.fraktur.biz/\r\nI expect
    that you may be familiar with most or all of the foundries on the following short
    list -- I have not checked them for this particular design:\r\nAlter Littera\r\nhttp://www.alterlittera.com/\r\nDelbanco
    Frakturschriften\r\nhttp://www.delbanco-frakturschriften.de/\r\nRalph Unger at
    RMU\r\nhttp://www.dtp-studio-unger.de/ and, with others, at Profonts\r\nhttp://www.profonts.de/shop/index.php\r\nas
    well as the standard Fraktur offerings from the major foundries, which can be
    readily fond by using the \"fraktur\" tag at Myfonts.\r\nLuc Devroye's page on
    Blackletter fonts\r\nhttp://luc.devroye.org/fraktur.html\r\nis an outstanding
    source for possible matches.\r\nPerhaps it is recent from one of the smaller European
    foundries?\r\nIf all of this fails, you could always ask the designer/producer
    of the EP.\r\nDon"

  body: "Thanks! I\u2019m familiar with all of those sites but had frankly forgotten
    about Alter Littera.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m now pretty sure this is the extra bold weight
    of Leipzig Fraktur by Peter Wiegel. There appear to be some \u201Cexpand stroke\u201D
    artifacts in that weight.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.peter-wiegel.de/Leipzig.html\r\n\r\n\u2014J"

  body: "Hi John, I believe you are correct. \r\nHere is Leipzig Fraktur Bold by Peter
    Wiegel, made heavier by applying a 10 point parallel line. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LipzigPlus10Parallel_5537.jpg]\r\nThe
    top part shows an individual letter. The original bold is in black. The expanded
    stroke in red. \r\nThe bottom part shows the preview results for the phrase. This
    looks identical to your image except for some rough spots which can easily be
    edited.\r\nDon"
