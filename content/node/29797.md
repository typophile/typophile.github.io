    shaded and engraved look of the 19thC is striking, have a look at Letterror's
    <a href=\"http://www.letterror.com/catalog/fed/index.html\">Federal.</a>\r\n\r\nThe
    address lines also look like an engravers titling font to my eye. Full of old
    world charm."

    seeing as The United States is only 230 years old, as opposed to a nation like
    Greece, which is thousands of years old, we don't have as much past to get away
    from.\r\n\r\nI can't remember where I read this, but I remember reading somewhere
    \ that during the late Victorian era, Americans were trying to make their new
    buildings look \"old\" by aging the copper and whatnot, while the French were
    embracing brand-new buildings.\r\n\r\nSo I suppose that Americans do have a tendency
    toward \"retro-ism,\" let alone the fact that in many ways we are still rather
    Victorian, not nearly as progressive as certain parts of Europe. (But in other
    ways we're ahead of the game, but not for long, I fear.)"
