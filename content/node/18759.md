body: "hello,\r\n\r\nregarding digital printing, i was wondering if anyone had any
  suggestions on typefaces and or type treatments, or any other type nuance that would
  lend themselves to this process. are there any type related problems that anyone
  has run into with a digital job? would you use a different approach if you were
  going to design a typeface that is intended for digital printing?\r\n\r\nthank you
  for reading this post. any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n------------------\r\nnick

  body: "This was far before the digital era, but is the only thing that comes to
    mind right off the bat. Bell Centennial which was designed by Matthew Carter.
    Specifically used at small point sizes, it avoided many problems that you get
    with sub-8 point type and dot gain.\r\n\r\nOther than that, having worked with
    two HP Indigo's, I do not really think that there is any difference between the
    type of quality that you can expect with fonts from a digital press then you would
    with a traditional press. The digital presses have their limitations, but they
    really do not restrict typography. There have been some jobs, high-end photography
    stuff, were the client thinks they can get good reproduction on the digital press,
    just like on the traditional press, and this is just not the case. Overall, IMO,
    the differences are more to do with color, sharpness, and tonal inconsistencies
    in photographs than with anything to do with type."

  body: "thanks for the reply Matthew,\r\n\r\ninteresting\u2026\r\n\r\ni just recently
    purchased <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-charter/\">ITC Charter</a>
    by Matthew Carter and noticed that the letterforms have some unique features in
    regards to the contruction of the serifs and terminals (especially in the italic).
    then i learned that it was designed for laser printer use. i'm wondering if these
    features have some functional purpose, or if they are simply aesthetic. \r\n\r\nalso,
    in regards to ink traps and dot gain, are these features still beneficial when
    you are using a digital press?\r\n\r\n"

  body: They are to an extent I imagine seeing as the paper will still absorb the
    ink. As stated above the real difference in using digital press is the color and
    quality and type isn't really affected by that. In my past experiences the only
    printing I've had type issues with is newspaper printing and that's generally
    more the case of the plates shifting.

  body: "Digital printing is what every laserprinter does. Back in 1988, I designed
    ITC Officina just for that purpose. Sturdy with blunt corners. A lot of letters
    have the same width, which is one of the things Officina inherited from Letter
    Gothic, which was my monospaced model.\r\n\r\nI never presumed that people would
    use Officina for anything but office correspondence, printed on Laserwriters or
    other \"modest\" resolution out put device. At the time, 300dpi was the norm,
    and Officina was made for that.\r\n\r\nFF Meta was designed for small sizes on
    bad paper, with pseudo-serifs and pretend-inktraps. That also makes it suitable
    for digital printing, which is all about a lot of thick ink and oil onto plain
    paper at medium resolution. The faces that worked well for bad printing conditions
    obviously work well for digital printing.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I agree with the above comments. Most of the time, when you hear about \"digital
    printing\", one is talking about xerographic devices. Printers such as the HP
    Indigo, use liquid \"ink\", but the process is much the same. The plastic which
    holds the pigment is pressed onto the surface of the paper, but not into the paper
    they way letterpress does. Even litho inks interact more intimately with paper
    fibers. Devices like the Indigo can have their own, unique pathologies if they
    are out of adjustment. This is more true with color printing, where the printer
    may not understand features like overprinting. \r\nOf course nowdays this mainly
    matters at small sizes.  \r\n\r\nAlso, a lot of high speed photocopiers still
    produce documents at 300/600ppi. In those cases, Erik's types really look great.
    I also like Zapf's Melior. \r\n\r\n"
