body: I just modified gill sans for a logo I&#39;m working on. And I realize there
  is probably an existing font out there...which would help me with collateral and
  what-have-you. <BR> <BR>is there a rounded gill sans or an equivalent? <BR>I could
  always &#42;gasp&#42; squash vag rounded... <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.iwishiwascreative.com/misc/gillrounded.gif"

  body: It <i>looks</i> like Frankfurter and VAG, but it has the potential to  <BR>be
    its own thing because those other two are geometric sans. <BR>Work some more humanism
    in there, you can see it already <BR>coming out in the &#39;C&#39;. <BR> <BR>I
    think this should be in the Design Critique Forum instead.

    in time and opened an archived thread...  are you feeling nostalgic? <BR> <BR>--sorry
    for the off topic thread--
