body: "I'm working on a project which other may find interesting. I'm trying to replicate
  a publication from 1798 (Malthus' Essay on the Principle of Population as it affects
  the future improvement of society). The source files are HTML (from Project Gutenberg)
  and I've added a CSS style sheet to produce a PDF file as close to the printed edition
  as possible, while still keeping the HTML in a browsable form. Here are links to
  my edition:\r\n\r\nhttp://css4.pub/2015/malthus/essay.html\r\nhttp://css4.pub/2015/malthus/essay.pdf\r\n\r\nAnd
  here's the original from 1798:\r\n\r\nhttps://archive.org/details/essayonprincipl00malt\r\n\r\nThe
  PDF is produced with <a href=http://www.princexml.com>Prince</a>.\r\n\r\nThe printed
  first edition uses long s. I didn't feel like changing the HTML source files for
  this purpose and instead uses the 'text-replace' property in CSS to achieve this:\r\n\r\n
  \ text-replace: \"s\" \"\\017F\"\r\n\r\nNow, the long s should not be used at the
  end of a word, so exceptions must also be coded:\r\n\r\n  text-replace: \"\\017F\\20\"
  \"s\\20\"    \r\n\r\nThere are more such exceptions, see the HTML source for the
  set I've been using. I know that some fonts also encode these substitutions. However,
  I believe it is easier for authors/replicators to edit the CSS source. Changing
  font files is frowned upon, no? Also, some other interesting substitutions are encoded.
  For example, to change \"etc.\" to \"&c.\", one can use:\r\n\r\n  text-replace:
  \"etc.\" \"\\26 c.\" \r\n\r\nAnd \"economist\" to \"\u0153conomist\":\r\n\r\n  text-replace:
  \"economist\" \"\\153 conomist\"  \r\n\r\nThe 'text-replace' property is described
  here:\r\n\r\n[[https://books.spec.whatwg.org/#character-substitution]]\r\n\r\nIt
  would be interesting to hear of similar projects and how presentational substitutions
  are encoded. \r\n\r\nIn the past, I've also replicated Henrik Ibsen's poems from
  1871 in the same manner, it's linked from here:\r\n\r\n[[http://css4.pub]]\r\n\r\nCheers,
  H\xE5kon"

  body: "Very interesting project!\r\nIn a perfect world, the right form of |s| would
    be automatically handled via OpenType features in the font, but support in applications
    is still spotty (https://www.typotheque.com/fonts/opentype_feature_support), more
    so in browsers (http://caniuse.com/#feat=font-feature)."

    body: "@riccard0\r\n\r\nI can see two reasons against encoding this in the font
      files. First, is it acceptable/legal for users like me to edit the font files
      if a font doesn't have the feature I need? Second, I'm not sure that the rules
      for handling longs are set -- they may vary from language to language or era
      to era. Having several features in every font file may be an option, but using
      the human-readable (albeit with unicode code point) 'text-transform' property
      seems like a more compact and editable solution?"

    body: "@Nick,\r\n\r\nI'm trying to understand your code. Don't you also need to
      have a \"sub s by longs;\" at the beginning to perform the majority of subsitutions?
      And, the last line seems to revert all substitutions? How to you express that
      an \"s\" at the end of a word should remain \"s\"?"

  body: "<blockquote><p>First, is it acceptable/legal for users like me to edit the
    font files if a font doesn't have the feature I need?</p></blockquote>\r\nNot
    unless the license allows it, but you can select an appropriate font and serve
    it as webfont.\r\n<blockquote><p>the rules for handling longs [...] may vary from
    language to language or era to era</p></blockquote>\r\nThey do. That's why you
    have both language and historical related features.\r\nAs I said, that would be
    the right solution for the user in a perfect word, where copying the text and
    pasting it using a different font would not end up with characters either missing
    or rendered with yet another different font.\r\nToday, especially for the creator,
    your solution is probably the best, and indubitably a very clever one."

  body: What Nick used is <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/topic_feature_file_syntax.html#5.e">Contextual
    substitutions</a> i.e. substitutions that occur only in a specified context (for
    example substitute an s only when followed by a letter).  LuaTeX allows using
    <code>.fea</code> (Adobe feature) files to do that so as to get the functionality
    without modifying the font.

  body: My AlQuds Arabic font featured a nicely extended letter /ra but it clashed
    with the following mark in a couple of  specific cases. To correct it I used a
    contextual Marks feature to change the mark position when that combination occurs,
    implemented as an OpenType feature in MS VOLT tool. Iffue solved.

  body: '@howcome: The "ignore sub" takes care of that. It details when a substitution
    is <em>not</em> to happen. The net effect is that ''longs'' is substituted by
    ''s'' <em>unless</em> it is followed by a lower-case character.'
