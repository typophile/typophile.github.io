body: "Normally, I hate when clients request to use a \u201Chandwriting\u201D typeface
  because I personally think if you want handwriting, you should actually use handwriting
  and scan it. Unfortunately, this is not always possible especially with clients
  that like to change copy at the last minute.\r\n\r\nSo last week I posted up a question
  on Twitter asking for suggestions for a handwriting face that isn\u2019t too scripty/brushy
  and doesn\u2019t suck. The Twitter conversation can been see here: https://twitter.com/realdougwilson/status/438050628548325376\r\n\r\nHere
  is a condensed list of the faces I found most useful.\r\n\r\nRoller Script by Nick
  Cooke - Lots of good alternates and both a rough and smooth version.\r\nhttp://www.g-type.com/rollerscript-font\r\n\r\nFresco
  Script by Fred Smeijers - Not sure I like the lc \u201Cg\u201D but it fits in the
  bigger family of Fresco. Good amount of weights as well.\r\nhttps://ourtype.com/#/try/fresco-script/\r\n\r\nSuomi
  Hand Script by Tomi Haaparanta - More \u201Caggressive\u201D than some of the others,
  but still has a good feel.\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/suomi_type_foundry/suomi_hand_script_ot/?affId=98220\r\n\r\nErikRightHand
  & JustLeftHand by  Erik van Blokland and Just van Rossum- Two variations on proper
  handwriting.\r\nhttps://www.fontfont.com/fonts/erikrighthand\r\n\r\nSignature by
  Henrik Kubel - Loose, marker feel.\r\nhttp://www.a2-type.co.uk/html/signature.html\r\n\r\nCaflisch
  Script by Robert Slimbach - Obviously a classic, but I feel this is too used and
  not unique enough.\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/caflisch-script/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI
  would love suggestions for additions to this list. Remember, the face needs to have
  a handwritten feel and not too fancy/scripty or brush script."

  body: "Here are a few additional faces suggested.\r\n\r\nFF Mister K by Julia Sysm\xE4l\xE4inen
    - Not the most legible, but wonderfully informal. I love the cross-out version
    as well.\r\nhttps://www.fontfont.com/fonts/mister-k\r\n\r\nNotera by M\xE5ns Greb\xE4ck
    - Another informal script.\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mawns/notera/\r\n\r\nInstant
    Vivd and Instant Quick by J\xE9rome Knebusch - A very nice, restrained but still
    handwritten face. A nice mix of handwriting and type design.\r\nhttp://www.batfoundry.com/catalogue_6_instant_.html?lang=2\r\n\r\nScripto
    by Franck Jalleau - Informal script with lots of good alternates and Open Type
    tricks up its sleeve.\r\nhttp://www.batfoundry.com/catalogue_7_scripto_.html#"

    a bit of flack for being over used and a bit like Papyrus) but is still  a nice
    font IMHO.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/170684/Regular-product.html"
