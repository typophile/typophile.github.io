    Plantin-Moretus at Antwerp</a> (go to collection). \r\nType fonts, punches and
    matrices from the same time - about 1550 - can also be found at the Imprimerie

    of types from the 1520s. Maybe I can find the text at work.\r\n\r\nBy the way,

  body: "> 3. Punches and matrices?\r\n\r\nDon't know whether these are the oldest,
    but these two are pretty old \r\n(both are from 1543):\r\n\r\n<strong>Garamont\u2019s
    Royal Great Primer or Gros-romain (Greek) 16 pt (1543)</strong>\r\nPunches and
    matrices preserved: Imprimerie Nationale, Paris, boite 47\r\n(That is, it was
    at the Imprimerie Nationale, before it closed down due to lack of funding).\r\n\r\nThe
    typeface was probably ready by the end of 1542. \r\nThe first use of it is in
    Robert Estienne's 1543 'Alphabetum Graecum'.\r\n\r\nfacsimile and literature:
    \r\n\u2022 Vervliet, Hendrik D. L., 'Greek printing types of the French Renaissance:
    the \u2018'grecs du roy\u2019' and their successors', in: Journal of the Printing
    Historical Society, new series number 2, winter 2000, p 13-14\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Plantin-Moretus
    Museum has some pretty old stuff, too, for example:\r\n\r\n<strong>Granjon\u2019s
    Italique Saint augustin premi\xE8re 12 pt (1543)</strong>\r\nMatrices preserved:
    Plantin-Moretus Museum, Antwerp, MA 27a\r\n\r\nfacsimile and literature: \r\n\u2022
    Vervliet, H. D. L., \u2018The italics of Robert Granjon\u2019 in Typography Papers

    see p 4 and no. 16/25\r\n\r\nSo, 1543 is my guess right now. \r\n(it's not much
    more than a guess - I didn't do proper research) \r\n\r\nAny other or earlier
    suggestions?"

    theory: When an old plant became obsolete, businesses would shutter it up, and
    build a new one next door, on the same premises. Clearing the ground and disposing
    of the remains was an avoidable expense, by doing nothing. So as long as the business
    had continuity, the old buildings retained their contents. The situation was the
    same with the old family mansion, where it would have been disrespectful, bad
    luck even, to chuck out one's ancestors' effects."

  body: "Good question\u2026 The consensus is that several existing technologies came
    together when Gutenberg invented \"printing\". There were presses (eg for winemaking),
    the technique of making punches was around (for decorating metalwork) \u2014 even
    the use of counterpunches was in use. The technique of printing by using a counterform
    was known and used (blockprint). Paper was being produced in quantity. Literacy
    was increasing as well as the buying power of the middle classes. Etc. etc.\r\n\r\nGutenberg's
    genius lays in putting all this together, industrializing several processes (eg
    producing the loose type) and (very important!), inventing an ink that was suitable
    for his needs \u2014 something new and the last cog needed to get it done. In
    the end he never benefited from his invention, but untold others have\u2026\r\n\r\nAs
    with most mayor inventions the art of printing sprung up in more places at the
    time, but Gutenberg hit it spot on and the others have been relegated to the outposts
    of local history (sorry, Coster).\r\n\r\nThe speed with which printing spread
    throughout the world was impressive \u2014 almost comparable to the revolution
    of the world wide web. Go figure \u2014 that happened five centuries plus ago\u2026"
