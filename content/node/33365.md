    a room, and should appreciate a vulgar visual typographic pun, respond, but I
    don't anticipate any change in their behaviour. Too ingrained.\r\n\r\nAwareness
    campaigns are not the way to combat global warming.\r\nNeither are percentage
    reduction targets for industry -- because we live on a finite planet, we need
    absolute targets.\r\nBanning incandescent bulbs is a token gesture. \r\nGasoline
    and air miles should be rationed."

  body: Conservation and environment education is like an ocean cruise ship trying
    to turn, you can turn the wheel but the ship will take a long time to turn. The
    problem is no one is steering. In the USA the administration's solution is to
    exhaust the resources we have, damn the environment.

  body: Speaking of things it reminds people of. This reminds when I was working on
    the east coast and the wife of one of our designers worked for the competition
    across the street. They did a summer morale BBQ and gave people shirts with the
    slogan "Good is the opposite of great". We all begged for a copy of the shirt,
    sadly she had given hers away before the end of the day, before we found out about
    it.
