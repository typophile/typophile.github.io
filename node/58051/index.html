  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I just ran into a strange OT Feature compile occurrence with a recently finished monospaced type I just completed.</p>
<p>What happens is when I &lsquo;compile&rsquo; the features FL Studio crashes. The whole application quits immediately.</p>
<p>I immediately figured i&rsquo;d do a trial and error by deleting all of the OT features and add them back one at a time but what was strange is after deleting all of them I added a basic ligature feature definition (as a quick test) and compiled only to have the same problem. Application quit immediately.</p>
<p>The feature was as stripped down as possible as well, like this:</p>
<p>feature liga {
sub F H by FH;
} liga;</p>
<p>So with troubleshooting my feature code solved (being that adding one simple feature definition, STILL caused the app to crash) no need to go back through all of the features I originally had in the file…</p>
<p>I decided to just generate the font and test it.</p>
<p>The results of generating the font file are fine, all the features are intact, I tested them all, they work and show up fine, all the glyphs are there and everything seems good to go.</p>
<p>The one thing I noticed after &lsquo;generating&rsquo; is the Output window contained this:</p>
<p>salt
aalt
titl
frac
ss01
ss02
ss03
ss04
ss05
ss06
ss07
ss08
[WARNING] <TestI-Regular> The feature file OS/2 overrides TypoAscender and TypoDescender do not sum to the font bbox size!</p>
<p>Any ideas? Am I missing something?</p>
<p>Opening any previous font build and &lsquo;compiling&rsquo; is fine.</p>
<p>It just happens to be this particular font file and I have no idea why.</p>
<p>At this point since the generated file seems to be fine I&rsquo;m assuming it is some type of glitch and proceeding forward but if anyone else has any similar experience or know what the problem might be please advise.</p>
<p>This problem is definitely the first of it&rsquo;s kind for me. I&rsquo;ve had a few feature syntax errors in the past that would be described in the Output window that I&rsquo;ve successfully fixed with no crashing of the app so this whole problem so far doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>If there was a real issue it seems the font wouldn&rsquo;t successfully &lsquo;generate&rsquo;, or the Output window would list a more serious problem when generating, correct?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Mike</p>
