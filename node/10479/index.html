		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks! I have tried to make text faces before but they&rsquo;ve always turned out to be more like display faces (I&rsquo;m relatively new to this whole font business). This time I figured I&rsquo;d learn from the experts and scoured almost every post on the serif board, reading the advice people gave to others  and applying it to this font (worthwhile, but quite time-consuming). I think it&rsquo;s worked out&hellip;
Really, I&rsquo;m looking to see if this is good, bad or ugly before I start working on the bold and other bits.</p>

<p>Overall looks good. I&rsquo;m not an expert, but here is my critique:</p>
<p>I will make thinner the arm of the &lsquo;r&rsquo; (the part the joins to the stem) at the moment seems too thick. Make also the right serif a bit longer as well.</p>
<p>&lsquo;c&rsquo; seems to narrow. The loop of &lsquo;g&rsquo; as well.</p>
<p>The numerals need some work. For example the ranging 3 and 5 are too prominent.</p>

I agree with the comment about the numbers 3 and 5 being too prominent, I wonder if there&rsquo;s another solution for these. The lowercase s looks a little squat to me.

For the Roman:
There are two characters that rub me the wrong way: the g and the j. The ear on the g just looks depressed. it looks like it&rsquo;s in pain. and that kinky tail needs to see a chiropracter. and the j stubbed it&rsquo;s toe, i&rsquo;m afraid. it looks like the whole tail of the j was well-formed and then got abruptly shoved to the right.</p>
<p>For the Italic:
the head serif on the ascending lc characters would look better if it were slightly flatter.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Wow.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d largely given up on this one (actually, more put on hold indefinitely).</p>
<p>Thank you for your comments, everyone.</p>
<p>I completely agree that I need to work on the numerals and now you mention it, the &rsquo;s' does seem to be too short (not sure how I missed that).</p>
<p>I also agree with the B looking odd, I don&rsquo;t really know what I was thinking with that one (probably something along the lines of &ldquo;yeah, I&rsquo;ll carry the curve up into the upper counter but only a tiny little bit, that&rsquo;ll look good&rdquo;).</p>
<p>I was going to ask about the g (and that pretty much answers my question!)
I do like it but it does look like it belongs in a different font. I&rsquo;m thinking that making the bowl rounder and stiffening the ear will probably help it.
And the j wasn&rsquo;t particularly well formed to begin with. Initially I didn&rsquo;t have the serif on the bottom but it just looked like it was missing a serif. I might try a few things like basing it on the top of the f or maybe just &lsquo;stretching it back out&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Oh, and I still haven&rsquo;t thought of a decent name yet.</p>

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody"><p>First: It&rsquo;s nice to see somebody scouring old crits to learn stuff; that&rsquo;s the mark of a craftsman. Second: This is quite good for a first text face! Some of the glyphs (like the &ldquo;a&rdquo;) have a lot of maturity. With some polish it&rsquo;ll be a winner.</p>
<p>Macro stuff:
Some of your corners seem confused, or indecisive. Like the bottom-left of the foot of the &ldquo;a&rdquo;/&ldquo;d&rdquo;, and inside of the top serif of the &ldquo;c&rdquo;. Considering how nice -I think- your general angularity is (like in the spur of the &ldquo;b&rdquo;) I would just make those sharp too.</p>
<p>Micro:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;d thin out the top bowl-stem join of &ldquo;d&rdquo;.</li>
<li>The top-right of &ldquo;e&rdquo; is too light.</li>
<li>The tail of the &ldquo;j&rdquo; needs to&hellip; morph!  :-/</li>
<li>In the &ldquo;k&rdquo;, that join is too choppy.</li>
<li>&ldquo;s&rdquo;: a bit wide, and top-heavy.</li>
<li>&ldquo;t&rdquo;: the head is way too timid.</li>
<li>The tail of the &ldquo;y&rdquo; is out of character.</li>
</ul>
<p>Caps: Your proportions are nicely classical (although I&rsquo;d make the &ldquo;L&rdquo; a bit narrower). And for some reason the tail of the &ldquo;J&rdquo; seems to work here, I think; so does that stub in the &ldquo;K&rdquo;. But the disjoin in the &ldquo;P&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t working - although I think it is working in the &ldquo;R&rdquo;. The &ldquo;Q&rdquo; though seems entirely too 19th century. I&rsquo;d make the &ldquo;U&rdquo; a hair wider, and the &ldquo;W&rdquo; slightly wider. BTW, you&rsquo;re using my favorite form of &ldquo;B&rdquo;!</p>
<p>Numerals: the head of the &ldquo;1&rdquo; is best for making the numerals fixed-width (which right now they aren&rsquo;t); and its base could be a lot stronger. The &ldquo;4&rdquo; and the &ldquo;7&rdquo; need more presence I think. The OS &ldquo;4&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t working.</p>
<p>Others: the Pound has an unusally strong top, but I think it&rsquo;s cool. The Florin should slant. The &ldquo;a&rdquo; in the At should be smaller. I&rsquo;d remove the x-line tick in the Eszet.</p>
<p>The Italic is quite refreshing, and its distinction from the Roman balanced very delicately, very&hellip; 21st century - wonderful. There&rsquo;s something old about it, like in its long diagonal serifs, but also something new in its ampleness and gentle slant (which I like a lot). Interesting, the &ldquo;f&rdquo; with a partial descender; I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;ve left the flourish out. The &ldquo;k&rdquo; might need to be less Art Deco. The &ldquo;&amp;&rdquo; is a flop.</p>
<p>Spacing: assuming you keep the nice slight darkishness, I would tighten it all up a bit.</p>
<p>Overall, quite encouraging!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>More micro crit. Either the bottom bowl of the &lsquo;u&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t go far enough below the baseline, or the lower right tail goes too far, or maybe a little of both. At very large sizes, the curve of the left side of the &lsquo;e&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t seem to match up (try temporarily removing the crossbar to see what I mean). Righthand bowl of &lsquo;R&rsquo; could probably be a bit darker.</p>
<p>Righthand bowl of &rsquo;m' may join the middle vertical stroke too low, although maybe this is the effect you were looking for. To my eye, it&rsquo;s a bit asymmetrical.</p>
<p>Italic &lsquo;agy&rsquo; seem a bit wide. (btw, &lsquo;vwxy&rsquo; are very nicely executed! I may have to steal ideas from those). I personally miss the lower left tail on the &lsquo;f&rsquo;, but again that&rsquo;s a matter of taste. The curve on the top arm of the &lsquo;k&rsquo; stands out to me - you&rsquo;ll note it&rsquo;s backwards from the curve you usually see on a Greek kappa.</p>
<p>Misc characters. The two-stroke &lsquo;$&rsquo; seems especially dark. Either going to a single stroke or pulling back on the darkness of the serifs would fix that. Braces aren&rsquo;t very curvy, a pet peeve of mine. See how I dealt with those in my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Century Catalogue<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The florin has a similar problem - the segment of the central stem which is perfectly straight should be shorter. The eszet seems topheavy, but I think that could be fixed by making it a bit narrower (especially the &rsquo;s' part of the glyph).</p>
<p>Spacing on the italic could use some adjustment. rbearing on &rsquo;t' is too loose, on &lsquo;i&rsquo; too tight. ge is too tight &rsquo;s' seems a bit loose. I think you&rsquo;ve overkerned the &lsquo;ke&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Overall, very nice!</p>

<a href="http://www.protimient.com/NotanuthaSerif2.pdf">http://www.protimient.com/NotanuthaSerif2.pdf</a></p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve covered all the suggestions made. I&rsquo;ve also slightly expanded the character set (although some of the ligatures may not make it to the final version).</p>
<p>I must admit I&rsquo;m still not 100% happy with the tail of the y, but I think it&rsquo;s going in the right direction (metaphorically speaking). The number of different approaches I&rsquo;ve tried is quite astounding (second only to the ear on the g, which I have spent far, far, far too much time tweaking and changing).</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve improved the tail of the j, as well as the tail on the Q, although I&rsquo;m not totally sure about it yet. Does it work? Also, is the new italic ampersand good or does it look a bit too uncial? Is the italic k working? How are my numerals?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The &ldquo;f&rdquo; and &ldquo;y&rdquo; are rockin' now. The &ldquo;g&rdquo; though is starting to look more and more homey - it needs to be more elegant; try making its head smaller and its curves more rigid. The head of the &ldquo;t&rdquo; is out of character. The &ldquo;Q&rdquo; is&hellip; interesting. It might work, but I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>Italic: I&rsquo;d give the leg of the &ldquo;k&rdquo; some pizzaz. That ampersand is novel, but I have to doubt it&rsquo;s good enough. The little Roman alternate is cool though. Italic spacing: a bit loose.</p>
<p>Your blank space is too wide in both Roman and Italic.</p>

<p>Since then, however, I have actually worked on it, making the semi-bold, bold and black weights and their italics, as can be seen in this third PDF (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nosta.pdf<!-- raw HTML omitted -->). I haven&rsquo;t included the entire character set for each font but I have put in the character set for the regular weight (all the fonts have the same quantity of glyphs), as well as the a-z&rsquo;s for each font and some text settings.</p>
<p>Any feedback would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>(Oh, and I will most probably be calling it &lsquo;Nosta&rsquo; (unless anyone can suggest a good reason not to!))</p>
<p>Ben</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Congrats; this is very well done. I can hardly find anything to criticize. Here&rsquo;s what I personally think. These are extremely minor.
-bowl of P too big
-make the top of the q bowl rejoin the stem as a hairline (don&rsquo;t rethicken it)
-maybe lighten lower bowl of g a tiny bit
-make the t a bit more chiral at the bottom left; also maybe a bit less smooth up top (maybe)
-x a little out of balance
-perhaps s also a little out of balance
-zero could be a bit more square
-tail of the italic g seems out of harmony for some reason&ndash;maybe not
-I can&rsquo;t shake the feeling that the italic f should come all the way down, or at least some farther.
-italic a needs more chirality
-rethink top italic k arm serif ?
-black k too lo-fi at join
-perhaps give black C,c a smidgen more underbite
-you mistyped &ldquo;black italic&rdquo;
-pi too narrow
-Euro could use a little more underbite
-maybe don&rsquo;t rethicken tail of eng (not sure what you would do about Eng in this case&ndash;perhaps treat it like y)
-what&rsquo;choo want an etc ligature for?</p>
<p>Most of these are so minor I can&rsquo;t even definitively say if I&rsquo;m actually seeing them or not. Overall I think it&rsquo;s very near to perfected. The vision is well captured. Where does the name Nosta come from?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thank you!
All good points (and I&rsquo;m quite glad they&rsquo;re not major problems like &ldquo;change all the serifs&rdquo;; I don&rsquo;t think I could really handle that at this stage). I&rsquo;ll look in to it all and update as and when.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->you mistyped “black italic”<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
$*#!&hellip; damn.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->what’choo want an etc ligature for?<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
A good question&hellip; I think it seemed like a good idea at the time. Who knows, maybe someone, somewhere will have a use for it. And besides, what&rsquo;s the point of designing type if you can&rsquo;t make ridiculous ligatures?!</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Where does the name Nosta come from?<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
It&rsquo;s a shortened form of the working title I was using for the font, Notanutha (serif). I&rsquo;d been calling it Notanutha for the last twelve months and I think I&rsquo;d grown too used to it, because I never liked any of the names I came up with that were a radical departure from it. Nosta is the closest I could get to it that sounded good (and not as silly). (It&rsquo;s a made up word, btw.)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Now keep in mind, tho', I&rsquo;m by no means an expert, having been alive less time than many here have been designing fonts. When I roam the forums somethimes I see that someone very astute has caught a big-picture sort of thing that I might never have noticed. I should be very nervous saying &ldquo;perfected&rdquo;. (The gist: My comments aren&rsquo;t the definitive ones.) Hmm. Seems like I end up saying this to everyone I comment on. Maybe I should just put it on my profile instead.</p>
<p>Now, about your ligature. If it&rsquo;s fun, I have no good cause for eliminating it. You&rsquo;re right: what&rsquo;s the point if it&rsquo;s no fun?!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well, it seems that I&rsquo;ve finally finished it (that is to say I&rsquo;ve decided to call it finished, or rather, to stop endlessly tweaking it, ad infinitum, with no discernible benefit to either the font or my mental health).</p>
<p>I must say thank you very, very much to everyone who has contributed to this thread (and, in fact, to the critique section in general). I have learnt many, many things (including, I know, that I&rsquo;m rubbish at regularly posting to this forum, but I&rsquo;ll be working on that).</p>
<p>A complete, full-on, final typespec can be found <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (PDF, 320kb), replete with full character sets (including daft ligatures), text settings and headlines.</p>
<p>Oh, and if anyone fancies buying it, it&rsquo;s available through <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MyFonts<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>All the best,</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>For a first text face (or even a second or third) this is amazing. It just works. Of course there are several little tweaks and adjustments to be made, but I&rsquo;m afraid that no matter how long you work on it, you&rsquo;ll always find someone who&rsquo;ll tell you to improve something else. In a sense, no typeface is ever perfect or 100% finished.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really in a position to criticize your design and can only hope to be as good as you one day. However, my overall feeling is that this face looks somewhat &ldquo;generic&rdquo;. The capitals have quite a lot of personality, as someone else pointed out, but the lower case just looks very good and clean and well-behaved, without looking personable or unique.</p>
<p>So I guess what I&rsquo;m trying to say is, if this was just an exercise in type design, you should give yourself an A+, summa cum laude.</p>
