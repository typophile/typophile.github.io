    521</a>. I don't if the little finishing stroke at the ends of the words is included
    in the digital version, but it doesn't look like it. Never noticed that before.

  body: "You're right Mark. In the metal typeface (shown in Mac McGrew's book), Mandate
    is shown as having a character that is an extender that can be added to the end
    of the letters. That was not included in the set of glyphs for the font.\r\n\r\nThe
    metal type was designed in 1934 by Robert H. Middleton. So it could have been
    used in early Monopoly sets.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Interesting link John (quadibloc). So the Mandate look wasn't until later
    (at least by 1954) according to what I could find on that site. That would still
    mean using the metal type, and not digital fonts.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega "

  body: "The Mandate look was pretty long running, apparently from 1937 to 2008. In
    2008, Hasbro standardized the game internationally, using a computer graphic image
    of Mr. Monopoly (formerly Rich Uncle Pennybags) on the cards - and using the <em>same</em>
    image on several similar cards, instead of a different image on each card.\r\n\r\nI
    had not formerly known of this, and am now deeply shocked and distressed. Yes,
    even a long-running classic must be modernized, but it ought to be an improvement
    when it is done."
