    more Arial fonts than Windows? \r\n\r\nAs a font it's more Apple than Mickey Mouse
    and the rainbow fatty nano iPod combined! ;-)"

    right to choose (a different font)\r\n \r\nPro immigration (only from countries
    that use the Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, Arabic and Hebrew writing systems)\r\n\r\nAgainst
    all taxes (the forms sill use Helvetica)\r\n\r\nAgainst the Iraq War (because
    Helvetica is it\u2019s official font)\r\n\r\nPro cloning\r\n\r\nPro stem research\r\n\r\nSpent
    the last eight years in a POW camp being systematically beaten by Mark and Erik.
    But still in favor of torturing designers everywhere. \r\n\r\nFears being surpassed
    by a younger rival with less baggage (Calibri)\r\n\r\nSounds Like McCain should
    drop Optima and choose Arial. ;-)\r\n"
