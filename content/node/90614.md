    bulk of your retail font income from Latin script users?

  body: "Andrijko, my Shinntype Cyrillic fonts have sold poorly.\r\nI could probably
    repackage and reprice them to be more attractive, but I don\u2019t think it would
    be worth the effort.\r\nMarketing is an issue for a Westerner.\r\nFor instance,
    they do not show up in a search for \u201CCyrillic\u201D encoding at ParaType.\r\n\r\nI
    thought Fontesque Cyrillic would do a little better, but again, AFAIK FontFont
    doesn\u2019t specifically target the Cyrillic market, and no doubt Fontesque is
    out of style right now.\r\n\r\nHowever, I will be releasing a new face later this
    year with Cyrillic and Greek, and I will try and do a better job of marketing
    to Russia and Ukraine.\r\n"

    on pirate use you can earn more than the sales.\r\nHere is a recent example -
    noticed the pirated use of Cyrillic Fedra (Russian Bank adds)\r\nhttp://s59.radikal.ru/i166/1203/b5/e584dd02e830.jpg\r\nWe

    choose to fight.\r\nIMO it\u2019s just part of the \u201Cshrinkage\u201D (the
    trade term for shoplifting) of the digital marketplace.\r\nI have enough to do.\r\nFor
    instance, I have been exchanging emails with Lineto for many months, trying to
    persuade them that they should not have named a new release \u201CBrown\u201D,
    as that is a longstanding Shinntype trademark.\r\nIf I wanted, I could spend all
    day running my business and not designing typefaces (or posting on Typophile).\r\nHowever,
    this is not to say that I wouldn\u2019t go after a particularly egregious act
    of piracy if I came across it or it was brought to my attention."

    if you're looking at market for each one?"

    you're on to something; if there isn't that might mean people are looking for

    I\u2019m not in a position to monitor or market to Cyrillic countries, either
    directly or through distributors. I\u2019m better off concentrating on Western
    markets, with Cyrillic & Greek as features for Western corporate customers selling
    in those markets.\r\n\r\nAnd the types in question, Scotch Modern and Figgins
    Sans, are not productized for mass sales in the first place, in the West. \r\n\r\n<em>That's
    just a color \u2026 </em>\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s more than a colour, it\u2019s also
    a surname (Brown is a newspaper face, named after the publisher). There\u2019s
    no Mr Red or Mr Yellow, outside of <em>Resevoir Dogs</em>\u2014not all colours
    are equally generic.\r\nBut that\u2019s not the issue \u2014 Lineto didn\u2019t
    do an adequate name search."
