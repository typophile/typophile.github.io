  body: 'This looks like it&#39;s a freeware font called Potrzebie, from Rotodesign.com:
    <BR> <BR>&#34;Potrzebie is a jumpy headline font based on an old phototypesetting
    font called Animated Latin,&#34; says the site. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.rotodesign.com/fonts/potrzebie/index.html"
    target="_blank">http://www.rotodesign.com/fonts/potrzebie/index.html</a> <BR>
    <BR>I suppose, since this is book is from a major publisher, they might have actually
    found an old phototype machine to produce the cover type, or digitized it themselves.
    But I doubt it... <BR> <BR>&#40;I used this last week in a quick &amp; dirty flyer
    for my company&#39;s holiday party, too. What are the odds?&#41;'
