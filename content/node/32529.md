  typophile pages and say hello. I hope to learn a lot more about design and specifically
  typography while I am here. There are some amazing designers here!\r\n\r\nI am currently
  studying second year of Communication Design at RMIT university in Melbourne, Australia
  and really enjoying it. Typography is one of my main interests and I designed some
  basic typefaces during my final year of high school which really started my love
  for typography!\r\n\r\nanyway, I look forward to gaining more knowledge.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nNick
  Cooke"

  body: "thanks for the welcome guys. yeh i had realised there was another Nick Cooke
    on the forum! I remember typing my name into google a few years back to find a
    Nick Cooke - typography designer, and it was quite bizarre considering that is
    a field I would love to be working in!\r\n\r\nBen, i did not know about Barry
    Spencer's site, thanks for sharing, he has some quite experimental type designs
    there. I shall find out more.\r\n\r\nNick."
