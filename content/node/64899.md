  know what the problem could be?\r\n\r\nThe sites Ive looked at to solve the problem
  all give conflicting conclusions. Some say there PC only and vice versa.\r\n\r\nThanks

  body: For the case, that you want to use it in Indesign (and probably also in other
    Adobe applications), there is an internal font folder, in which you can put PC
    Type 1 files, as far as I remember. Otherwise you have to convert it.

    via Font Explorer X and Font Book but neither of them seem to be able to read
    it.\r\n\r\nIs it a simple job to convert them?"

  body: "<cite>Is it a simple job to convert them?</cite>\r\n\r\nI never have converted
    a PC Type1 font to a Mac Type 1 font, but it is dependent from the tools you use
    and from your experiences, as in most cases. But I am relatively sure, that there
    also is a font folder on the Mac, that belongs to the Illustrator directory, where
    you can put in PC Type1 fonts. (Search for fonts in the Adobe directories to locate
    font folders, if nobody else replies, that can specify the path.) I don\u2019t
    know, if there is a free Mac tool for font conversions. Except from the Adobe
    Font Development Kit for OpenType (AFDKO), with the help of which you can build
    OpenType fonts."
