  body: "I would say start by realizing that Aldus's matching of a static Roman to
    a fluid Italic was a shotgun-wedding from hell. Then consider that the ideal flavor
    of a given Italic depends on its role in the whole, which can vary, so blindly
    following the established fallacy by default is Bad Design. And usually this role
    is one of subservience to the Roman, not \"Look at meee, look how pretty I am
    in my tutu doing a pirouette!\" Cursiveness has <em>nothing</em> to do with emphasis.\r\n\r\nNow

  body: "<blockquote>Cursiveness has nothing to do with emphasis.</blockquote>\r\nHow
    doesn't it? I'm often greatly annoyed when an italic looks too much like the roman
    and it's barely noticeable that some text is set in italic. I think whether you
    use italics for emphasis or something else, just like bold and small-caps they
    have their function and they're used to denote something, so you better make it
    clear that they denote something. What else is an italic for?\r\n\r\nI personally
    also see the italic as a way to go a little nuts. Traditionally the italic was
    a distinct typeface from the roman, so I actually wonder from a historic perspective
    why you would want the italic to look like the roman. You state the initial combination
    of roman and italic was a shotgun-wedding from hell, but I just can't relate to
    that.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>so blindly following the established fallacy by default
    is Bad Design.</blockquote>\r\nI'm not quite sure what you mean here and how you
    would prefer to see it.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>And usually this role is one of subservience
    to the Roman, not \"Look at meee, look how pretty I am in my tutu doing a pirouette!\"</blockquote>\r\nWhether
    you feel italics are for emphasis or not, I think the cursive script inherently
    says \"Look at me \u2014 look how pretty I am\". Why would you even want to fight
    that?\r\n\r\nI guess you won't like the italic of Kristal by Eyal Holtzman; I
    think it's awesome. Here I could understand your sentiment though. It's very prominent,
    which you generally don't want to that extent in body text, though it's fantastic
    in a display context.\r\nhttp://www.eyalmyrthe.nl/letterontwerpen.php\r\n\r\nRoman\xE9e
    is the same case as Kristal in this regard. How do you feel about upright italics
    in combination with roman?"

  body: "First: Jeremy, sorry for the digression (par for the course here on Typophile,
    especially when yours truly is involved...) but I hope it's still somehow useful.\r\n\r\nNick,
    I would say look at Harrier* and the Italic of Nina's Ernestine**. And Martin,
    I don't have a lot of typefaces... Well, not in digital \u2013 they're mostly
    in brainwave format. :->\r\n\r\n* http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&patria/dev/nour-latin.gif\r\n\r\n**
    http://ernestinefont.com/\r\n\r\nMore on my thoughts about Italic in my old Daidala
    interview: http://www.daidala.com/25apr2004.html\r\nBut frankly, I feel like I'm
    still taking baby steps in this area; I'm just standing on the tip of the iceberg.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>you
    better make it clear that they denote something.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nTotally agreed.
    But cursiveness remains an arbitrary and distracting means to do that. For example
    I see the \"upright Italic\" trend of about a decade ago as a huge mistake. Slant,
    different story.\r\n\r\nI don't think <em>pretty</em> usually makes sense when
    you're trying to emphasize. Certainly not as a rule, which is what it is now.
    Most Italics are like a ballerina crashing an economists conference.\r\n\r\nGoing
    nuts? Display face.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I like the tension in the italic of Ernestine. Perhaps it's better to have
    an italic with such tension rather than a full cursive, though a cursive inherently
    creates tension when combined with a roman. I personally like how text tends to
    become more vivid when such tensions are employed. For example, I like the combination
    of roman and blackletter to add texture and color to a page. I suppose in a way
    it's strange that the italic has become part of the roman while this hasn't been
    the case for blackletters. I know blackletters are generally out of fashion, but
    I love it when a blackletter variant has been added to a roman.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    I think the ballerina approach to italics tends to work very well for classical
    typefaces. It's sort of Venetian, with lots of tension within the shapes.\r\n\r\nHrant,
    why haven't you done more typefaces? Don't you particularly enjoy the process?
    Nour & Patria has a very nice texture. I like the tension in the italic, which
    you probably wouldn't expect from such a transitional, vertical design."
