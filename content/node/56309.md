  glyph is not available in an open type font like Eurostile LT Std...\r\nI need to
  use 1/3 and apparently its not here... and well making a normal 1/3 as fraction
  in the open type menu of in design does not fix the problem apparently.\r\nSO what
  I do (and yes I feel stupid) is build it on illustrator and simply stick it where
  it should be used... (damn design huh?)\r\nAnyone has a suggestion? I am seriously
  annoyed! and would /embrace a kind answer from you!\r\n\r\nThanks"

    might be your option.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, depending on your adherence to the EULA
    of the font and the availability of the proper font tools, you could cannibalize
    the \xBD symbol and hack it in.\r\n\r\nOr, depending on the circumstances, you
    can use one from a different font. (Although, it's not going to be easy to match
    Eurostyle.)"

  body: "You can build it in your layout application, by setting the superior \"one\",
    followed by \"fraction\" and superior \"three\", with appropriate baseline shift
    and kerning.\r\n\r\nI don't know if that process would produce a match for the
    other fractions in that particular font."

  body: Adobe's EULA is actually quite generous, and it's my non-lawyer's opinion
    that this is the exact kind of modification it allows, as long as you don't re-distribute.

    character (a.k.a. \"virgule\") is different from the slash, and should be the
    same in the font when both an isolated character, or when part of a composite
    fraction."

    comment on this one, but am pretty happy with his Make Book Jacket script.

    is in fact a difference between the native otf fractions available and the ones
    \"styled\" by the script. So I don't know... has anyone tested the Pro version
    here? Any feedback? Would be informative!\r\n\r\nThanks for all the help folks!\r\n\r\n"
