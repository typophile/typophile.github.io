  ligatures or swash initials, things like that. even something looking alot like
  DTL Fleischmann would be a great help. the primary thing im looking for are the
  angled cuts on the serifs though.\r\n\r\nim working on a book for uni and fleischmann
  would really fit well i imagine, so im looking for type i could actually pay for
  (because, of course, my budget for type is pretty small as a student).\r\n\r\nthanks
  alot!"

    and Farnham are just about your only choices if you don't like DTL Fleischmann
    (I think Matthew Carter's Fenway is not freely available). To my knowledge, neither
    has funky ligatures, just the usual ones, but Farnham, as Lari pointed out, does
    have a font of swashes. You can see them better <a href=http://www.christianschwartz.com/farnham.shtml>here</a>.
    If price is a concern, you can buy only the Farnham fonts you need from Font Bureau
    by clicking on \"25 styles\" and then adding the ones you want to your cart.\r\n\r\nMy
    recommendation (based on how I've used both in my newspaper) would be to use Farnham
    at display sizes and Mercury as text, but they're both extraordinary typefaces."
