  to get some feedback: KERN.\r\nWe are developing some graphic-design oriented titles
  and wanted to make something specifically for our type loving friends!\r\n\r\nYou
  can see a video preview [[http://www.vimeo.com/3177481|here]].\r\n\r\nThe App is
  available at the [[http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=304330441|App
  Store]] as well. \r\n\r\nThe project is also featured in detail at the [[http://www.formationalliance.com/index.php?id=39|FORMAtion]]
  site.\r\n\r\nLet us know what you think!"

  body: "This is fun! Good work guys. I just tried it. It's pretty hard, too!\r\n\r\nMinor
    critique: One thing I'd really really wish for is high scores. This way, it's
    kind of sad how the end of the game seems to only be defined by the negative (losing
    all five \"ligature\" bonuses); it would be nice to introduce a positive incentive
    to keep playing (apart from learning about spacing!).\r\n\r\nAlso, a big wish
    for version 2 would be not being limited to Helvetica. ;-)"

  body: We do have the SCORES in the main menu that tracks the high scores for the
    games...based on how many points you score and how many words you get thru.  Tracking
    the scores to a national database is something we would like to add, as well as
    more variety for the typefaces.  Thanks for giving it a try!

  body: "The falling words is okay, but for a learning/teaching tool I think it would
    be more useful to have a static word with one or more missing letters that you
    need to shift left/right. After you submit your answer it's graded the way your
    game currently does it.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you could offer a few options for how the
    words appear? Falling, shifting, bouncing, static, etc."

    missing letter of each falling word in it's correct position by...\" \r\n\r\n...<em>it
    is</em> or <em>it has</em>?\r\n______________________________________________\r\nEver

    for the word to fall near enough  for gauging is sometimes a little too long.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    great stuff!"

  body: Great comments all.   Thanks for the feedback.  That apostrophe hurts!  That's
    what I get for working with no sleep!  Will fix!  Although the game is not intended
    as a true teaching tool, we hoped it might intrigue some players to be more interested
    in typography.
