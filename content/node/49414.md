body: "Based on a skeleton of Roman inscriptional capitals, History includes 21 layers
  inspired by the evolution of typography. These 21 independent typefaces share widths
  and other metric information so that they can be recombined. Thus History has the
  potential to generate thousands of different unique styles. History is available
  as a collection of 21 OpenType fonts that can be used just as any other fonts, and
  also as part of the layering software <a href=\"http://www.typotheque.com/fonts/history_remixer/\">History
  Remixer</a>.\r\n\r\nAvailable from <a href=\"http://www.typotheque.com\">Typotheque.com</a>\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/history_04_5087.png]"
