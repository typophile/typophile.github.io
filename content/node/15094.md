  were used and when (posted by myself as well).\r\nAs part of this section, I am
  proposing a typographic survey that charts font usage by year. For instance, when
  was Helvetica REALLY big etc.\r\nI don't really know how the info would be collected,
  and validated. The presentation is the easy part (for me anyway).\r\nConceptually
  it would look like this: http://www.babynamewizard.com/namevoyager/lnv0105.html\r\n\r\nThoughts,
  ideas, suggestions?"

    right that it is the presentation that is the easy part. \r\n\r\nHmm, I guess
    some questions to ask to get the ball rolling would be:\r\n\r\n<li>Should font
    usage data be limited to a certain country or should it be international?\r\n<li>Should
    we look at specific types of media? Ads? Books? Packaging? Signage? Movie credits?\r\n<li>What
    about more emphemeral and mundane things like hang tags on clothes, instructional
    manuals? \r\n<li>And what about new types of media that have come into use only
    recently, like the Internet?\r\n<li>Should we only chart one medium to see how
    font usage has changed in one context?\r\n<li>Or should we chart differeint media,
    ads and web alike, to see how font usage has been affected by context?"

  body: "I was thinking of selecting a range of 20 or so publications that actaully
    span a decent length opf time. Quite a wide range too, trade mags, professional
    mags as well as pop mags. Then, go through each, page by page and write down everything.
    I'm not sure if that's a good means of getting a sample, but it seems pretty good
    right now. Any ideas about how to effectively hone a sample group? I was envisaging
    this being a group effort in terms of the actuall analysis, it would take AGES!!\r\nIt
    would be worth perhaps making the spread of info display not only type, but when
    and where (country/media) too. This means film, swing tags etc. To get the ball
    rolling, a focus in the interim on magazines might be the go? It has to start
    somewhere...\r\n"

  body: If you go with sampling an array of magazines over a time period, the next
    question is what will count as an instance of one font. Magazines will use a specific
    font for text over the course of a few years, as part of its style, but advertisements
    for a product may use an array of fonts, depending on the campaign. Would you
    count each year that a magazine uses one font as an instance of usage, even though
    it's one continuous use?

    good question though.

    body: "To get a good sample of magazines, maybe compile the magazine subscriptions
      of public libraries. Since libraries serve a public readership, which is anybody
      and everybody, their subscriptions are usually pretty well rounded. This could
      be a starting point, but I would imagine that you'd of course have to add to
      the list.\r\n\r\nAlso, when you collect data for font usage, how would you compensate
      for a font that is really visible versus not very visible? Like a font for newspaper
      headlines versus one for photo credits."

  body: "Good idea! In addition to Danas first comment I suggest that the survey should
    also be split into groups of fonts \u2013 e.g. serifs/sans etc. - for ease of
    use both in data accumulation and in readibility of the \"output\". There are
    several web pages that give the front pages of daily newspapers, I once categorized
    the ~400 \"logo heads\" (i.e. the newspaper titles) for a day into several groups
    of typefaces (sans, serif, typewriter/egyptienne, blackletter, non-latin, plus
    Caps in those categories) and country/continent. It was somewhat restricted to
    the pictures I could accumulate through automated downloading w/ wget, but it
    showed quite a lot of different uses of type in different regions. It was a heck
    of work, and I lost it after not making a backup copy. \r\nI imagine one could
    combine such an approach with the question of unique type faces and think that
    such a survey could help quite a lot both in identifying typefaces from a certain
    period of time and in designing new stuff.\r\nOne more question that comes to
    my mind: What about combinations of typefaces? I think that these contribute to
    the appearance of a designed product and should not be forgotten (although that
    would further complicate the survey)."
