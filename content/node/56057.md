body: "Cameron Moll has written a very thoughtful and objective article <strong><a
  href=\"http://cameronmoll.com/archives/2009/03/cufon_font_embedding/\">Exploring
  Cuf\xF3n, a sIFR alternative for font embedding</a></strong>. <a href=\"http://wiki.github.com/sorccu/cufon/about\">Cuf\xF3n</a>
  is an SVG (scalable vector graphics, similar to Flash) and Javascript alternative
  to [[sIFR]], which uses Flash and Javascript. \r\n\r\nPros:\r\n+ No plug-ins required
  \u2013 it can only use features natively supported by the client\r\n+ Compatibility
  \u2013 it works on every major browser on the market\r\n+ Ease of use \u2013 no
  or near-zero configuration needed for standard use cases\r\n+ Speed \u2013 it's
  fast, even for sufficiently large amounts of text\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n_ No text selection.
  You can\u2019t select the text to do something simple such as copy and paste\r\n_
  No hover state. Yet.\r\n_ Older PostScript fonts on Mac OS X aren\u2019t supported.
  Requires converting font files. Eula alert?\r\n_ Letterform fidelity may be inferior
  to sIFR. (But if Cameron says it's sufficient for his needs, I'm inclined to listen.\r\n_
  Typeface information (files) may be easier to thieve than with sIFR.\r\n\r\nIt raises
  some questions. It's a font embedding mechanism, but is it fundamentally different
  from sIFR as to warrant foundries' revisiting their licensing agreements? If that
  last point is true, we can expect some foundries to get ruffled.\r\n\r\nWorth reading
  his in depth piece.\r\n\r\nIt's also worth writing the Typo Wiki entry for [[Cufon]]."

  body: "If I\u2019m a designer worried about people pirating my fonts Cuf\xF3n actually
    makes things worse. Cuf\xF3n makes it likely someone will write a script to scrape
    degraded 360 UPM versions of my fonts of the web, convert them back into OTF format,
    and then release a bootleg collection of my fonts with bad outlines, naming issues,
    and OpenType problems. We could even end up with type degraded over multiple generations
    floating around, which could damage a type designer\u2019s reputation. I can just
    imagine hypothetical designers who use bootleg fonts telling people to \u201Cnever
    buy from that guy! His fonts are a mess!\u201D \r\n\r\nPersonally I\u2019d rather
    just charge an high licensing fee for @font-face and explicitly prohibit Cuf\xF3n
    to ensure that pirate fonts look good and work right."

  body: "Wow. Interesting point, James.\r\nI guess I'd never thought it through that
    far.\r\n\r\nAs a music file organization freak who loves complete albums over
    single tracks floating in the wild, your points about degraded collections strikes
    a large  array of gongs. \r\nI can't stand mislabeled, incomplete tags, crappy
    album art, etc., etc., you all get the picture. To think that there would be fonts
    out there in such a state creeps me out. \r\n\r\nThanks for replying."
