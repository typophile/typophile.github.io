body: "I am an artist and I have recently become very interested in Josef Muller-Brockman's
  grid systems however I am very new to this sort of system and would like to better
  understand the math at work in the construction of the grids so that I can construct
  a 20 cell grid for a page that is the golden ratio (ie. the height is 1.618 * the
  width).\r\n\r\nI am using the 20 grid on page 77 of Josef Muller-Brockman's Grid
  Systems in Graphic Design  as a reference, however the page the book is printed
  on is not exactly a golden ratio, nor is the grid area a true golden ratio.\r\n\r\nPlease
  forgive me if any of this is rudimentary as I have never dealt with anything like
  this since high school geometry, but does anybody have any idea how I would go about
  constructing a similar grid in Indesign where the page is a golden ratio, and so
  is the bounding box of the grid?\r\n\r\n\r\nI have included  a scan of page 77 from
  the Josef Muller-Brockman book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAny suggestions would be greatly
  appreciated\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks so much!\r\n\r\nps. Please let me know if there is
  any other information or any files i could provide that would be helpful\r\n"

    the extra white space around the grid from the image, then resize the image--de-selecting
    \"Constrain Proportions\"--to 1000px wide \xD7 1168px high. Then, place the image
    in InDesign, resize it--proportionally this time--to fit your page, then use it
    as a template to create your guidelines. Delete the JPG, make this page a master,
    and you're all set. "

    ratio to 1.6 or 1.625 to make measurements easier. Although the golden ratio resides
    at 1:1.618, a near-enough estimate still achieves the intended goal."
