  body: "Looks like a wider Myriad. I like the proportions and drawing quite a bit.\r\n\r\nHigh
    i tittle seems out of place with such short ascenders.\r\n\r\nt seems a little
    weak above the crossbar.\r\n\r\nYou might narrow (pull in the diagonal side) a
    bit on the top left of r/m/n and bottom right of u a touch."

  body: "I\xB4ve messed around with it quite a bit, changed some proportions, like
    in the uppercase S, tried to flesh out as many characters as I could (many looking
    pretty horrible at the moment, you will see).\r\n\r\nDo check the new PDF (Board
    2) on the first post.\r\n\r\nOne big question I have, regarding the design of
    the letter s. How do you people go about the spine of it, how exactly does the
    2 nodes (sometimes 4) happen in there? So far I don\xB4t have them at all, but
    notice it in every respectable typeface I can remember.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nRodrigo"
