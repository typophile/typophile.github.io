body: "Hi there!!\r\n\r\nI was testing my fonts in CorelDraw x13 and had a big surprise!
  I couldn't find anywhere to acess opentype features such as stylistic alternates
  and discretionary ligatures... actually, when I searched the help in Corel, I didn't
  find anything related to \"opentype\" or \"open type\". In the section of font formats,
  in help, OT doesn't even appear. Too weird...\r\n\r\nMy AFTER fonts (http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bytype/after-headline/)
  have lots of special ligatures that aren't encoded, so I can't even acess them in
  the INSERT SPECIAL CHARACTER box because the software only shows encoded gliphs
  :/ dammit Corel!!\r\n\r\nIs Corel indeed like this or someone knows how to solve
  this?\r\n\r\nthks!!\r\nFabio"

  body: You must assign Unicode indexes to ALL GLYPHS (of course from PUA, to avoid
    possible conflicts).

    FL manual that some foundries use the PUA unicode range for special characters,
    while others don't, for reasons I can't remember now.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "<cite>with no unicode assignment at all?</cite>\r\n\r\nWell, it depends.\r\nThe
    bad thing about insertig PUA characters is, that you will mess up the text. You
    cannot change the typeface, without having wrong characters, spell checking won't
    work and so on.\r\nBut if you design a display typeface this is not so much of
    a problem. And if you know your customers will use CorelDRAW you may rather do
    the wrong thing ... and make your customers happy.\r\n\r\nRalf\r\n\r\n"

    and more each day.\r\n\r\nI'm still holding on to Freehand but will have to give
    in soon. I'm trying to avoid the Adobe CS suite, though I know I'll end up with
    it.\r\n\r\nI do want to consider the alternatives, though. Corel is definitely
    a contender.\r\n\r\n"
