  F]] makes me curious because it\u2019s such a limited typeface, especially considering
  Adrian Frutiger is the patriarch of this family. There\u2019s  55 Roman, 56 Italic,
  65 Bold and 75 Black, but why not a 66 Bold Italic and a 76 Black Italic?\r\n\r\nI
  am designing a brochure and using Egyptienne F in combination with [[http://www.fonts.com/FindFonts/Detail.htm?pid=421588&/cgi-bin/MsmGo.exe?grab_id=0&page_id=57440&query=UNIVERS&SCOPE=Fonts|Univers]]\u2014a
  whopping 27 fonts in this family pack. However, the lack of bold-italic in Egyptienne
  F is a bit troublesome.\r\n\r\nIt seems there must be a story behind why the type
  design screeched to a halt with just four fonts. Anyone here familiar with the history
  of this typeface?"

  body: "Perhaps Egyptienne never became a large family because Frutiger later made
    [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/glypha_std_complete_family_value_pack/|Glypha]].
    I also feel like I read somewhere that Frutiger didn't actually care for Egyptienne
    or Glypha. I can't remember which it is, or where I read it...\r\n\r\nI know they
    aren't identical, but it is something else to pair with Univers."
