body: I have a number of 1890s-era maps from the USGS that pair Didot and an uknown
  (to me) sans-serif with matching proportions. This series of maps always strikes
  me as particularly satisfying typographically, but also leaves me wondering about
  the sans. I'm not aware of too many in existence before the mid-1890s, and this
  one looks fairly mature and particularly well-matched in proportion and character
  to Didot. Any ideas what it might be or where it came from?

    serif type first appeared in foundry specimens in the early 1800s (1816, if this
    source is correct):\r\nhttp://www.designhistory.org/Type_milestones_pages/SansSerif.html\r\n\r\nI'll
    do a bit of searching to see if I can find a digital typeface that approximates
    the look of your samples....\r\n"

  body: "I appreciate your help, K.C.\r\n\r\nI'd assumed they were engravings. Still,
    the type is clearly a Didot and something else. I'm just wondering where that
    sans came from? I haven't found any digital faces that resemble too closely."
