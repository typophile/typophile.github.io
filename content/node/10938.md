body: I was going through the forums &#40;which I love&#41; and came upon the paid
  memembership part. I would love to become a paid member but I&#39;m not an expert
  on fonts. Never created a font and have no idea where to even start making a font.
  I just enjoy the beauty of what can be done with fonts. I&#39;ve learned a lot by
  going through the forums. If i do become a paid member would other paid members
  take offense? <BR> <BR>Bella

    you aim it on them, I would do that gladly! <BR> <BR>Seriously: I don&#39;t condone
    killing, and I&#39;ve never done it myself &#40;mostly because I was luckily to
    avoid being in that position&#41;. But my attraction to certain machines of war&#42;
    is there - you might catch the bug too if you ever find yourself growing up smack
    dab in the middle of a 17-year war. I don&#39;t try to reconcile &#40;or even
    explain&#41; all my feelings, but the fact that I admit to them puts me on a higher
    level than denial-junkies engaging in criminal voting. <BR> <BR>&#42; Like the
    mangonel. <BR> <BR>And remember Gill? He hated Industry, but he couldn&#39;t help
    but love trains. <BR>Humans are strange, and I&#39;m stranger than average. Who/what
