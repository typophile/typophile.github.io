  body: "Without knowing the date of the tag (airline was founded in 1955, tag could
    date as late as '70s, by the look of it), this appears to be a bastardized version
    of Avant Garde. Didn't find anything with the curiously square-off R and P, but
    the following may be helpful:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/avant-garde-gothic/std-bold/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/font-fabric/solomon/black-99953/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mostardesign/sofia-pro/semi-bold/"

  body: "I don't think this is a font, it's probably a Frankenstein construction of
    different fonts (not only the style but also the weight of the letters is different).\r\nIf
    you insist to construct something similar, you can take \"GO\" of <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=ITC&ffam=AvantGardeGothicC%20-%20Demi&fid=606569c8748e3bce41a5067fe31b6c8f&fsize=60&text=GO&wrap=2|Avant
