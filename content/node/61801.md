  was Berthold Akzidenz Grotesk Super but at a closer inspection it's not,, the O's
  perfectly round on my reference, and Akzidenz isnt... \r\n\r\nso if anyone could
  point me in the right direction, that would be amazing.. it might be a modified
  version of some font, but would be good to work the starting point\r\n\r\ncheers!\r\n/markus\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_3419.jpg]"
