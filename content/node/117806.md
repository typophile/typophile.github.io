  logo is currently used for a professional gaming team that has been around for many
  years. In terms of what the brand should represent: professionalism, edginess &
  competition/sportiness with perhaps a bit of a futuristic vibe given the industry
  it's in.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the text version of the logo is quite tacky and
  outdated (currently uses Concelian Jet).\r\n\r\nWhile the core shape of the logo
  is unlikely to be changed, I've been considering trying to change the font used
  in the main logo and move it *beneath* the logo instead of on top. However, I've
  been struggling to find something that really fits well visually.\r\n\r\nI've played
  around with Eurostile Extended, Magistral and even typefaces like TradeMarker. I
  just don't know what will work well visually with such a round, sharp logo. Keeping
  the brand qualities in mind, does anyone have any suggestions? I was thinking trying
  to stick with something bold & oblique, but would that be a bad idea?\r\n\r\nFurthermore,
  our assisting brand font is currently DIN but I've been thinking about switching
  to the less sterile and softer Roboto although I worry that it may not mesh well
  with the logo.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance to anyone who offers their input."
