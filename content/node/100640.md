  \r\n\r\nDo you have any examples of the letter F where the cross strokes  more or
  less form a circle? Or to be more specific, where there is a \"white space circle\"
  in between the  cross strokes? \r\n\r\nHope I am not to vague in explaining what
  I am after. It's a bit tricky to explain in words.\r\n\r\nUpper- or lower case does
  not mater. Also it does not have to be part of a complete type set, I am only after
  some inspiration. \r\n\r\nThanks!"
