  body: '@David, as your link shows something labelled as ''experimental'' and fits
    both labels, could you be a lot more specific? What research have you done so

  body: Additionally, depending on whether this leads anywhere for you, Chris Dean's
    post on [[How to cite and reference Typophile for academic research|how to cite
    and reference Typophile for academic research]] could prove very helpful, as could
    using your real name as your user name, which will help other users to take you
    more seriously from an academic and professional perspective.
