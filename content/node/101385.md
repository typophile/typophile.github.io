    type design per se. At least from the few page examples I've seen, I think there's
    some useful information on those pages, specially for quickly glancing and comparing
    some glyphs features.\r\n\r\nI've been trying to buy it online, with no luck,
    for a very long long time, and I already gave up trying to get it from a bookstore.
    I wish to buy it scanned from somebody, that's all.\r\n\r\nAm I crazy trying so
    hard to get my hands on that book? Letters of Credit is good, but I'm a visual
    person and need something to look for answers quickly.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    you can do the same thing if you have any font drawing software, like FontLab.
    Just open a bunch of typefaces you want to compare, and start copying and pasting
    them over one another. You can even do it in Illustrator, going to outlines. And
    to really study a question you have about how designers solve the design of E
    or e in different styles, you will want to do a lot more and different comparisons
    than Chung does. \r\n\r\nIn response to Hrant, it would be great to have a newer
    'book 1' on type design, including digital type issues, but meanwhile Tracy is
    it.  "

    be widely available.  I doubt a.jp would ship to Russia, but I'm sure some Chinese
    online retailers would be able to get it.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I think it's a great
    book.  It's not simply comparisons, it contains a lot of brief but very useful
    notes about how letters are typically structured, character by character.  I imagine
    an experienced/professional designer would probably find most of its hints to
    be no-brainers, but for a beginner like me it's been invaluable.  \r\n\r\nLots
    of people recommend Walter Tracy's book, but that one really does seem to be un-purchasable
    (unless you're willing to pay several hundred dollars to a rare books dealer)."

  body: Ops, on a similar subject... is there any book like Cheng's which deals with
    italics? While working on the italics of my Graphirus font I have encountered
    some "problems" that I'd like to check on a visual manner, but I haven't found
    any resources yet. I've been comparing some italic fonts and making some assumptions
    from that, but is a pain in the a** to do so and maybe my italics pool is not
    as big and varied as to get conclussions from it anyways.

    choice for one of several books a beginning type designer could own. The book
    is strongest at a micro level analysis of individual glyphs and their relationships.\r\n\r\nSignificant
    omissions include the lack of italic coverage, and the fact that the Latin coverage
    is limited to western European (there\u2019s an eszett and acute, but no ogonek
    or L-slash). I don't have a problem with stopping at Latin, but covering at least
    CE/Baltic/Turkish as part of that seems pretty standard these days.\r\n\r\nFor
    western readers, the book is easy to find. Amazon has it in stock, I have seen
    it in local bookstores, etc. Sorry that getting it in Russia is so hard!"

    is lost to the publisher or the author or any part of the supply chain, because
    no real potential for a sale exists. \r\n\r\nIf Mr. Graphirus chooses to distribute
