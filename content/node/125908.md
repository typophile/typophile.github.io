body: Hey, I need to put a mixed case word on a window and it seems it would work
  best vertically. Wondering if there is a standard rotation whether the text is typically
  rotated to read bottom to top, or top to bottom. It is mixed case so rotated 90
  degrees counter clockwise would put the base line on the right hand side, and the
  text would be placed on the right hand side of window reading bottom to top so I'm
  thinking this works. Wondering what the norm is for vertical type.

    other European countries that run bottom to top.

  body: But to answer W's question, I would say he/she has it right if signage is
    going on the right side of window. If on the left side then top to bottom would
    seem more appropriate. In each case the baseline is reinforced by the window's
    edge (esp. if there are no descenders)

  body: On the other hand, where do you expect people to be standing? If they're standing
    in front of the window, they will be reading the text upside down if they tilt
    their heads, and will need to move to the right in order to read it the right
    way. So having the text run bottom to top at the right edge of the window seems
    to me to orient the text outside the window frame, whereas running it top to bottom
    orients it to a reader standing in front of the window.

  body: Very good point John! My thoughts were for foot traffic coming at the glass
    from outside the frame but obviously that only works in one direction! Perhaps
    there is a strong case here for keeping the text horizontal, placed in any one
    of the four corners?

  body: From the brief description here I think I would be tempted to go for reading
    downwards, although I'd make my decision based upon the exact circumstances and
    conditions in situ. I have often wondered if there is a handedness issue with
    this. Looking at bookshelves for example, with both 'up' and 'down' spines, I
    find it irritating to have to keep rocking from side to side and find tilting
    to my right much more natural; I'm right handed.

  body: "Typically when you're doing vertical text you want people to read up; the
    reason it reads downward on book spines is so that it will be upright when the
    book is lying cover-side up on a table.\r\n\r\nI agree, though, that orienting
    it so the baseline is supported by the edge of the window makes sense."
