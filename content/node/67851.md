body: "These letters are from the Yale University School of Medicine logo. I pulled
  out the most  distinctive glyphs (characteristic characters?) for viewing here in
  TP.\r\n\r\nI can't get a vector version of their logo for a sponsorship. I've got
  a huge gif, and, at its size, would work fine, but it's not anti-aliased, as you
  can see in the extraction.\r\n\r\nFYI, I already ran this through WTF in various
  ways, to no avail.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\nRay\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Yale-School-of-Medicine_5856.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Yale-School-of-Medicine-full_5569.png]"
