  was really great since that is my favorite design contest out there. However I have
  been submitting every year since and have not made it in again. So now they have
  raised their prices and I have lost a bit of my confidence...\r\n\r\nso my question
  is are design contests worth the money to submit and how can one tell when something
  is worth submitting?\r\n\r\nthanks!"

    But award lists only tell me who likes a particular designer and not necessarily
    whether I'd like their work.

    getting projects, it can also help in being accepted as a conference speaker (if
    only because somebody who has won awards makes the conference look better) which
    is of course yet another way to promote yourself and get more work.\r\n\r\nThe

    must be something intrinsically wrong with the system. That said, I have come
    across many that are way overpriced and definitely seem like an old boy''s club,

    something for a practical application or use there is great reward in seeing the
    design being used and appreciated over long term.\r\nThe exposure from winning
    contests is super. At this point in my career just seeing the satisfaction on
    a client's face once Ive given them something they appreciate is enough for me.
    Even encountering a piece of my portfolio in it's intended use years after designing
    it is satisfaction enough. I often feel like I've won an award just knowing people
    like and use my work. It is wonderful how my pieces show up in odd places and
    not a soul in the room can identify the connection between me and the design.\r\nIt
    is delightful like being the writer of a book with a secret alias.\r\n\r\n"
