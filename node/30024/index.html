  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Dear Typophiles,</p>
<p>is there anything that could help me understanding [[cyrillic]] font design and typography (letterforms, proportions, cultural differences, etc.) as a western-europe-guy capable of reading german, english and some dutch?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found this one:
<a href="http://store.artlebedev.com/catalog/books/design/kniga_pro_bykvy/">http://store.artlebedev.com/catalog/books/design/kniga_pro_bykvy/</a>
and I think I&rsquo;ll buy it if it is available, but I won&rsquo;t understand much, except for the pictures.</p>
<p>Or do you think I should stop thinking about it, as everything I ever could produce just can be inferior to people who &ldquo;really understand&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Thanks
Sebastian</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think that latinization is the expression of modernism within the realm of writing systems. In the 20th century, type designers were fond of chopping of serifs and simplifying forms, and also unifying the formal language of writing systems &ndash; mostly by imitating the Latin forms. To me, modernism has always been an echo of the 19th-century fascination with the machine.</p>
<p>My idea for the 21st-century type design is a search for more natural, but also more ad hoc forms &ndash; in all writing systems. Neither directly derived from the writing hand nor overly simplified. The technical limitations of type design are less and less existant, it&rsquo;s possible to draw thousands of glyphs, create glyphs made of components, engineer automatic, contextual substitutions. Typefaces need to find a balance between hand influences, mechanical influences and electronic influences.</p>

<p>That goes without saying.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m saying is that all writing systems have undergone &ldquo;modernismazation&rdquo; attempts in the 20th century, including the Latin script. For non-Latin scripts, latinization was one of the aspects of &ldquo;modernismazation&rdquo;. I believe that the drive for modernism is no longer a good idea, which includes dropping the latinization trend for non-Latin scripts, and dropping other modernism-driven trends such as simplification, for all scripts.</p>

<p>Matthew Carter’s Georgia is most likely the best Cyrillic typeface designed by a non-Russian, and one of the best Cyrillic faces ever. It’s perfect in every sense.</p>
<p>The work done by <a href="http://www.paratype.com/asearch/default.asp?search=safayev">Tagir Safayev</a> and by <a href="http://www.paratype.com/asearch/default.asp?search=yefimov">Vladimir Yefimov</a> for ParaType is seminal.</p>
<p>Especially check Yefimov&rsquo;s own Octava, his Cyrillic renditions of ITC Charter (great!), Kis (great!) and Raleigh as well as Safayev&rsquo;s Rodchenko typeface and his Cyrillic versions of ITC Officina Sans (great!) and Serif and of ITC New Baskerville.</p>
<p>Later check Yefimov&rsquo;s Cyrillic versions of Futura, Futura Futuris, New Standard, ITC Avant Garde, English 157, and Safayev&rsquo;s Cyrillic versions of ITC Kabel, Humanist 521 (Gill Kayo), FF OCR-F, FF Meta. The ParaType version of Humanist 531 (Syntax) is also very good, by Isay Slutsker and Manvel Shmavonyan.</p>
<p>Some of the new Microsoft ClearType fonts that ship with Office 2007 (Calibri, Candara, Consolas, Corbel) have very decent Cyrillics. I’m not very fond of Constantia and Cambria as designs altogether, but I’d say their Cyrillics are also not worse than their Latins. However, in general, Luc(as) de Groot, Jeremy Tankard, Gary Munch and John Hudson have a fairly firm grip on designing Cyrillics, while Robert Slimbach’s Cyrillics (Minion, Garamond Premier Pro) are more controversial.</p>
<p>The work of Alexander Tarbeev and his students is also worth looking at.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>&ldquo;I would say that if you go with your imagination, and design an original, new typeface, and make the “ef” work smoothly within that context, you will have a better chance at transcending the weight of history.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think this is the best approach to any type design as long as you are not attempting a revival where the historical part is your driving force.
Regarding history, it has been written, interpreted, revised and reinterpreted many times. If we always base our design logic on this shifting sand, it will always stand the chance of missing the intension. Better to design in the present for the present and allow your new design to be fulfilled in its own terms.  Whatever you do, there will certainly be those who decree, &ldquo;but it isn&rsquo;t&hellip;[siting the historical references which they most agree with]&rdquo; so why not just let it be its own cosmos. It is probably more efficient to design something and reflect on its plus and minus characteristics than to do nothing because of an endless debate that stops you from ever getting started. There are those who will say it does not follow tradition and there are those who will say it is the same old stuff as we always see. The world has an ample supply of critics.</p>

<p>BTW, Chekulayev recently extended <a href="http://www.linotypefont.com/search/frutigercyrillic">Frutiger</a> for Linotype while some years ago, Tagir Safaev designed ParaType&rsquo;s own Cyrillic version of Frutiger called <a href="http://www.font.org/pt/search=FreeSet">FreeSet</a>.

<p>I don&rsquo;t think there are any critiques available, online or offline – especially in English. I believe that the Russian type designers who would be able to do such a critique are far too polite and modest to actually publish anything that would criticize fellow type designers (who otherwise do excellent work, like Robert Slimbach). However, if you track Russian typographic publications, you will notice the trend that the work of certain designers is regularly praised and awarded, while others are left unmentioned. Also, typographic conferences such as ATypI are often a good occasion to sit down with some Russian designers and talk with them one-on-one.</p>
<p>For anyone interested in Cyrillic type design, I recommend the <a href="http://www.tdc.org/events/education/non-latinweek-ends/"><strong>TDC Cyrillic Weekend</strong></a> which will be held on March 2-4, 2007 at the Type Directors Club in New York. Maxim Zhukov’s expertise in the field of Cyrillic type design is unquestionable, he was the consultant who helped Hudson, Carter, de Groot, Tankard, Munch and many other Western type designers to get their Cyrillics where they are now. Maxim’s approach on Cyrillic is quite orthodox, with certain rules and schemes. As with anything in typography, these rules are very practical to learn even if at some point, you decide to break them.</p>

<p>If it looks good, it will read well.
There are many well-established Latin typefaces that have a character or two with an odd alphabet-form, which nonetheless harmonize visually with the rest of the font. You could look at the bottom bowl of Baskerville&rsquo;s &ldquo;g&rdquo; and say that&rsquo;s not right (as some revivalists have), the bowl should be closed, but it&rsquo;s really not a problem. Souvenir&rsquo;s &ldquo;g&rdquo; is even stranger, and yet it has become a well-loved face.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting point of view. But that would mean that, for example, I could design a suitable Japanese textface just by studying the shapes, and the shapes alone. (supposing I don&rsquo;t have a clue about Japanese language but yet about esthetically good design)</p>

<p>You might be able to. You would need a long list of popular fonts to compare variations of form, an idea of how mainstream each one is, and fat helping of artistic talent.</p>

<p>I fully agree. If you read Maxim Zhukov&rsquo;s paper, you will find that he firmly believes that some Cyrillic letters <em>must</em> be identical with their Latin &ldquo;relatives&rdquo;. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s reasonable.</p>
<p>Most ParaType cyrillizations, and most Cyrillic typefaces altogether, suffer from the fact that Latin and Cyrillic share the same letter proportions. I think the Cyrillic lowercase could be slightly taller, and have larger sidebearings &ndash; that&rsquo;d be the minimum. I don&rsquo;t see why some forms couldn&rsquo;t be a bit different altogether.</p>
<p>This is wonderfully proven with ITC Officina and FF Meta. Of both Spiekermann&rsquo;s typefaces (both adapted for Cyrillic by Tagir Safayev), Meta actually works better in Latin text, but for Cyrillic, Officina is far superior. Officina used to be very popular in the West but when Meta was released, it gradually replaced and suppressed Officina. But not in Russia. Officina Cyrillic is still one of the most popular modern sanserifs there, and Meta is hardly present.</p>
<p>Officina has looser spacing and a higher x-height than Meta: for Latin, it is a bit over the top. For Cyrillic, it works perfectly. I don&rsquo;t even think it&rsquo;s an ad-hoc hypothesis: I believe that the intuitive choice of typographers in both script rooms and their &ldquo;natural&rdquo; preference for Meta over Officina or the other way around, delivers actual proof.</p>

<p>both in Renaissance and in modern fonts, Latin and Greek differ noticeably, and there is no &ldquo;problem&rdquo;. The Greeks had their latinization phase but they&rsquo;re over it now. The Russians don&rsquo;t necessarily have the confidence yet.</p>
<p>Also, nobody said that the letterforms have to differ <em>noticeably</em>. &ldquo;d&rdquo; looks like a &ldquo;p&rdquo; turned upside down, and the top &ldquo;B&rdquo; counter looks like it&rsquo;s the same size as the bottom, but we both know that neither of that is true. Harmonization of forms does not mean making them geometrically identical.</p>
<p>In fact, the current Cyrillic faces often suffer from the problem that if you set two columns of text, side-by-side, one in Russian and one in English, with the same point size and leading, then either the English is too tight or the Russian is too loose.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the principle of script harmonization within multilingual typefaces is simple: when set side-by-side in two columns <em>and</em> when mixed together within one column, the scripts should <em>look good</em>. Now, what &ldquo;look good&rdquo; exactly means is up to the type designer to decide. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll agree that it doesn&rsquo;t have to be simple geometric copy-pasteness.</p>
<p>As for the Cyrillic &ldquo;ef&rdquo; in New Standard, it fits. It is a reminiscent of the era, and is probably a way of reaching out to the &ldquo;greekness&rdquo; of some Cyrillic forms rather than following a Latin model. In Cyrillic, the double and the reverse letters (ef, zhe, ya, yu etc.) are among the most unorthodox ones.</p>
<p>I recommend that you order a copy of Yuri Gordon&rsquo;s book (<a href="http://store.artlebedev.com/catalog/books/design/kniga_pro_bykvy/">http://store.artlebedev.com/catalog/books/design/kniga_pro_bykvy/</a> ). It shows some nice examples of Cyrillic letterforms in different writing styles, and also their extreme treatment in logos &ndash; which can be helpful in exploring the &ldquo;acceptable&rdquo; borders for each character.</p>
<p>Regards,
Adam</p>

<p>This is a tall order - too tall for many and maybe most combinations of two* scripts. This is why Nour&amp;Patria is a multi-lateral system. Yes, the archetypical Modernist decries it as Too Complicated, but as far as I&rsquo;m concerned that&rsquo;s more of a reflection on him.  :-)</p>

<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s available, but the shipping is steep and it&rsquo;s all in Russian. It is very impressive and the illustrations are very informative. As for Russian the Wiley / Katzner Russian English dictionary is the only one I&rsquo;ve found that has any sort of typographic terms in it. Anybody know of a better one for design and type?</p>

<p>Any plans for a Cyrillic along the same lines?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It depends. For Cyrillic I&rsquo;d need plenty of &ldquo;native&rdquo; advice though. And as I&rsquo;ve explained in my Spatium/Hyphen article it&rsquo;s more work adding a new script in a multi-lateral system: you have to make a new master with subordinates for the pre-existing scripts, plus you need to make a subordinate for the new script for each pre-existing script. The good news is that a lot of the process can be mechanized, like how Patria&rsquo;s Roman and Italic sprouted from the subordinate Latin, and how the subordinate Armenian came from the Armenian master.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would expect it to accentuate the effect, in parallel
column setting of Latin and Cyrillic, of the Latin being
more tightly leaded.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An effect which, especially being &ldquo;pre-existing&rdquo; (I mean in the conventional scheme) is best alleviated by giving the Cyrillic a larger &ldquo;x-height&rdquo; (which is more significantly justified by the issue of apparent size). On the other hand, there are much worse things that different apparent leading, or even misaligned leading between two columns - for example a Cyrillic that&rsquo;s harder to read because the proportions are off.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Artemius’ descenders, x-height, sidebearings, and common
glyph-shapes appear to be the same across the two scripts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which coupled with the difference in ascenders makes
the whole too subtle, like a mistake, in your view, no?</p>

<p>Or on the typesetting side by setting the Cyrillic slightly
larger in point size (with the same line-to-line leading).
This does introduce color issues (assuming a color-balanced
Latin/Cyrillic system) but not much. In fact color differences
can be used to compensate for script-inherent apparent size
issues (like how Arabic always looks smaller than Latin).</p>

<p>You could pick your advisors based on potential sales, or number of users, or some other scheme. Fortunately type design is non-deterministic - there&rsquo;s never really a &ldquo;solution&rdquo;, so you find the best advice you can from as many people as seems reasonable; the best you can do is never better than what your circumstances allow for.

<p>In a mixed setting like this caption from the Gordon book, set in
Artemius Sans, surely having different x-heights for the two

letter shapes (B, C, e, a) would be an unnecessary distraction.</p>

<p>I agree, but only because it&rsquo;s a caption: deliberative reading.
For immersive reading (much better with a serif anyway)
there is no distraction; the subconscious doesn&rsquo;t care.

<p>Nah, theory should adapt to the needs of the artiste, like
his need not to have his opinions exposed as fraud in public.</p>
<p>In The Official Thesaurus of Shinnistan, &ldquo;flexible&rdquo;,
&ldquo;convenient&rdquo; and &ldquo;self-serving&rdquo; seem to be synonyms.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>A question, for Adam and of course others with good
insight into Cyrillic, and the perceptions thereof:</p>
<p>Do natives feel that the lc looks like a mish-mash of UC and lc forms?* Maybe if only as a result of exposure to Latin? Or is this perception (which I very strongly have) merely an artefact of Latin nativity (and lack of Cyrillic nativity)? And if it&rsquo;s only the latter, how much does that matter? Lastly, if this sentiment is there, even mildly, has anybody done anything about it?</p>
<ul>
<li>Not that the two Latin cases don&rsquo;t have that issue - although in Latin
there&rsquo;s the real distinction of case - you don&rsquo;t see much intermixing.</li>

<p>Yuri Gordon&rsquo;s book is in Russian only but it&rsquo;s useful even if you don&rsquo;t read a single word in Russian. The illustration and the drawings included there already make it a good investment.</p>
<p>David,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Should that advice come from the Bulgars for whom 
it was originaly intended? the Moravians who first 
received it? The Bulgars who exentually received 
it or the Russ who eventually made it there’s. 
Like, there’s only one Cyrillic native?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Russian Cyrillic tradition now has the position of, say, the American Latin tradition. The Bulgarian Cyrillic tradition could be compared to perhaps the Norwegian Latin tradition, or something. I mean, regarding influence.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re American, David, so you should know that you&rsquo;re the most important guys out there. Same for the Russians in the Cyrillic domain :&gt;</p>
<p>(Only half-kidding)</p>
<p>But it is true that the Russian type designers or consultants, such Vladimir Yefimov or Maxim Zhukov, are often more rigid and orthodox in their views than, say, Jovica Veljović, who is a Serbian native. There was an interesting discussion between them at the ATypI Prague conference where Jovica showed his typeface in progress that showed some unorthodox Cyrillic forms.</p>
<p>Jovica Veljović&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.font.org/fc/pid=427471">Sava Pro</a> is worth looking at. It&rsquo;s small-caps-only but shows some wonderful &ldquo;brave&rdquo; Cyrillic capitals.</p>

<p>Paul: All of the above.
I&rsquo;ve seen that spec. The mystery left in this work, (regardless of script) is how one weights the choices: geographically, by population density, to a historical time or technology, or etc., so when one making the gross and then detailed decisions, one is targeting something less than all, or looking long at the end of ones own tail. I think, in general, if you want to serve them best you have to design their core glyphs first with a mind clear of your own. I.E we design around our use of our l.c. e.g.</p>
<p>Hrant:David, I guess pity those who need native advice for Latin. :-)
Either I don&rsquo;t understand, or the word pity translates to serve if I say the same thing?
The point is, Latin has been hyper-styled for obvious reasons (massive cultural and ethnic absorbsion plus geographic spread, so, as other scripts are freed to do so, it&rsquo;s of benefit to examine what Latin&rsquo;s done, how and why. No?</p>

<p>Non-deterministically. Non-Modernistically. As best one can.
Which is always better than either dismissing the issue or running away.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>design their core glyphs first with a mind clear of your own.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clear? Never!  :-)</p>
<p>Concerning Latin what I meant was that if one needed &ldquo;native&rdquo; advice the way you worry it needs to be done, one might be in worse shape than for Cyrillic.</p>
<p>If you mean that Latin is more free than Cyrillic nativity-wise, I would agree on a certain scale, but never completely, and because it&rsquo;s used so much more broadly the net issue is at best comparable. For example note the issue of acute/grave accent angles in Polish versus French, or the particular -if nonformalized- preferences in certain African lanaguages that use Latin.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it’s of benefit to examine what Latin’s done, how and why.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Certainly. Study, but not emulate, not per se.</p>
<p>In the same way that type should study chirography and take away things like stroke contrast, but not because of where it&rsquo;s coming from, but because it&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>And these two can be combined: in Thai the &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; style is monoline, but looking at Latin and being inspired to introduce stroke contrast (as is now done) is a good thing. But being inspired <cite>because</cite> it&rsquo;s from Latin (and/or chirography) can only bite you in end.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Right. 
Does anyone familiar with Serbian Cyrillic know the &ldquo;proper&rdquo; way to design the Dje letter? (Appears as Dje-cy in Glyphs 2). The Wikipedia article uses two versions - with a loop similar to a reversed &ldquo;c&rdquo; on the baseline, and with a tail under the baseline- similar to the F clef (Bass clef). As far as I see in various fonts, the &ldquo;c-tail&rdquo; version is the more common one. So is it the &ldquo;proper&rdquo; one? Or should I include both versions as alternates?</div>
