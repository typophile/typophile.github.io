  \r\nI am soo happy, if they just asked us nicely I would have done it for free.\r\nAny
  hows typy stuff at the moment is, \r\ncompany logo is  ITC Avant Garde, copy text
  on ads is Gotham Round, but this my change.\r\n\r\nIf any one is interested have
  a look at the temp website www.madebykate.co.uk\r\n\r\nI still can't believe we're
  getting paid to draw monsters, it's like being at primary school and your dreams
  coming true.\r\nHave a great weekend\r\nMartin"

  body: We all need money, however doing something you love for zip is good as long
    as you are happy.  Ounce in a blue moon I do some pro-bonos for those who can
    not afford it, the cool thing about it is you have 100% control of the work.
