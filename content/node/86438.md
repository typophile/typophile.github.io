  forms construction, space between letters and some things to be considered to add
  it on a font to be completed with this extended range. If its are available in Spanish
  can be better for me\r\n\r\nThank you very much.\r\n\r\nJ\r\n\r\n\r\nP.D. My English

    is that it is written in Russian.  As far as I know, there are no translations
    offered in Spanish or English\r\n\r\nI have the book but cannot read Russian--it
    is sill quite good because the illustrations are very good on their own."

    Cyrillic fonts and documents and come to your own conclusions."

  body: "My design philosophy is not so script-specific.\r\n\r\nWith the exception
    of a weekend TDC seminar with Maxim Zhukov, I have generally avoided other people's
    advice*, whether working in my native Latin script or Cyrillic and Greek.\r\n\r\nThe
    results in Cyrillic mimic precedent (Scotch Modern, which I prefer to think of
    as authentic revival), are indeed caricatures (Fontesque, which is a caricature
    in its native Latin), or have some degree of originality (Figgins Sans). It has
    more to do with being true to the qualities and principles of the typeface than
    native exposure to the script. \r\n\r\n*For retail fonts, that is\u2014on commissions,
    the client calls the shots."

    at all script-specific.\r\nHowever proper typeface design cannot look only to
    style formalisms.\r\n\r\nSorry old chap, I caught the following before you edited
    it:\r\n> I generally ignore other people's advice\r\n\r\nThat's the most useful
    statement you've ever made.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nUseful originality in ignorance of
    nativity can only come from dumb luck.\r\nEverybody gets lucky sometimes, but
    don't bet on somebody who relies on luck.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "When asked what market research was done for the iPad, Steve Jobs said none,
    consumers don't know what they want.\r\nNot much difference between leadership
    and self-indulgence.\r\nWith products, the marketplace decides; if it sells, then
    people want and need it.\r\nThe market has been kind to my whims, which is why
    I recommend that others do their own thing, rather than try to calculate or guess
    what people want and need.\r\nThe market is so large that if one follows one's
    interests, there are bound to be others of like mind.\r\n\r\nHowever, the market
    for Cyrillic fonts is presently not very receptive to western-designed fonts.\r\nI
    don't think that has anything to do with any alien \"they don't get it\" quality
    that such fonts might have, it's more to do with the difficulties that western
    foundries have in establishing their brand over there\u2014as well as the issue
    of piracy in Cyrillic font markets."
