  body: "Bob, now you have no link at all.\r\nI learned to write html without an editor
    for my first web page and appreciate the frustration when it does not work. All
    it takes in this case is one missing symbol, such as a \", to break the link.
    Oh well, as Kurt Vonnegut said, \"such is life.\"\r\nDon"

  body: Tried Avenir Heavy and Black but not heavy or black enough - also dot on i
    above top of f. Knowing that fonts at Dafont are often based on other things I
    think we can say that Matiz has a lot of Avenir qualties
