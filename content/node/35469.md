  Do Good</a>.<br><br>The 2007 \"Type Specimen\" tee was designed by Christian Robertson,
  a longtime Typophile member and moderator who joined Punchcut in 2004. Christian
  designed the popular typefaces <a href=\"http://typophile.com/wiki/Dear%252BSarah\">Dear
  Sarah</a> and <a href=\"http://typophile.com/wiki/Pill%252BGothic\">Pill Gothic</a>.
  The \"Type Specimen\" tee takes its cues from 1923 ATF type specimen books. Rather
  than finding a historical looking typeface for the design, Christian drew an American
  gothic inspired typeface from scratch. The shirt will be available on August 1 to
  attendees of TypeCon, Seattle. It will then be made available for purchase from
  Typophile.com.<br><br>\r\nRead more after <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/35469\">the

  of the proof. Not the final layout, nor the final color. The ink is a new eco-friendly
  \"water-based\" process that actually strips away pigment in the tee. The result
  is a very soft feel (no thick layer of ink) and a more subtle look. It also allows
  for some killer overprinting effects.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nMore pics and purchase

    payment methods I'm sure we can work something out. =)

    shrinks a lot when you wash it the first time...
