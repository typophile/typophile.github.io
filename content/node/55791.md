  body: "A few quick comments:\r\n1) That uppercase bold sans speaks pretty dam loud,
    but then it takes a long time to read. Maybe consider a mixed-case setting?\r\n2)
    The color scheme says France to me, not Italy. I'd change the blue to green. If
    you need the blue for CI reasons, I wouldn't use it on the word \"Italy\".\r\n3)
    The colosseum in the corner, while I like its graphical treatment, looks a bit
    like an excuse to squoosh in an image after all. You might try making it more
    prominent and exploring ways the type can interact with the image.\r\n4) On the
    detail level, there's some kerning to work out (\"AIRW A YS\")."

  body: It might work during the holidays...but red and green? Are you trying to offend
    the color-blind? :-) I'm not a fan of the color scheme. Try something a little
    less primary and a bit more sophisticated. And all-caps does suggest yelling,
    something that seems a bit off-message with the supposedly awesome and polite
    service British Airways offers.

  body: i'm not trying to offend the colour blind, but if i was i think i was done
    a good job lol, i understand with the red, it was feeling like it was being burnt
    into my pupil against the green. I chose caps because in lowercase it seems to
    feel off, ill post it lowercase when i get back home. I did want to use british
    airways colour scheme, the red and blue as a gradient it. i just want more typographical
    then illustrative. something a little different.

  body: "Maybe choose a bit more of an airy color scheme? Something that suggests
    air-travel and freedom. Light blues. Maybe some dark blues, suggesting ocean.
    And if you pair it with a nice, clean sans-serif - upper and lower case as you
    want people to read it and not feel they were yelled at - you may be able to convince
    people that these flights are economical which may be a key selling point in these
    economic times. Maybe also throw in a flat, silhouette illustration of something
    unique and easily recognizable to the destination being served - but be careful
    that the illustration item is not too clich\xE9 (I'm specifically thinking of
    kangaroos)."

    typography. I still agree with bemerx that \"you want people to read it and not
    feel they were yelled at\", which was also what I was trying to get at in my first
    reply to this. \r\nThat said, your most recent mixed-case variation yells less,
    but looks a bit like you haven't spent a lot of time playing with different typefaces,
    font sizes, arrangements, with the leading and the line lengths, and the placement
    of the illustration (which might also benefit from a more refined treatment).
    \r\nYou've got so many variables at your disposal &ndash; already in the \"purely
    graphical\" realm, i.e. before you reach color. Play with them! :-)"

  body: "Well the last image is the best yet but Nina's suggestions are spot-on. Think
    about what you're communicating and think of the \"tone\" and \"feeling\" that
    you want to communicate. Play with your typefaces and find a family (or two) that
    help capture that. Then use 1 or 2 fonts from those families in such a way that
    you capture that feeling while balancing it with the layout. \r\n\r\nDesign is
    about problem solving with multiple variables all which need to be balanced successfully.
    It's challenging yet very fulfilling. Advertising is design but with a focus on
    wish fulfilling. What's the wish? How will BA fulfill it? And I think it's less
    about \"cheap flights\" and more about \"good value and excellent service\".\r\n\r\nYou
    might want to check out ads in say, National Geographic or in some traveling magazine,
    and see how other designers solve similar problems. Look at the type that they
    use and see if it helps invoke feelings appropriate to the message.\r\n\r\nAnd
    finally, don't get frustrated. Stop and take a break by doing something completely
    unrelated to this project (or even design in general). Then come back to it later."

  body: That's not very comfortable at all. I would have to disagree, I think making
    "huge discounts" a separate line, it reads very choppy. Takes too much effort.
    You want someone to be able to read it quickly and with ease. I think the previous
    version does that more effectively. But it feels crammed - there isn't enough
    space around it. You want it the sentence to be comfortable in there. You wouldn't
    have to make too much room, it's just way too close to the edge as is.

    it is getting quite plain. b) i would actually try something a little different
    for each..\r\nI mean, Italy is a lot different then New York, you could give each
    poster a certain feel about it. \r\nI sound confusing don't I?\r\nOk. I would
    probably use the first idea for Italy..using the Italian colors...which even the
    color blind people would understand, becuase it is the color of their flag. And
    for somewhere like America, I would use ... http://typophile.com/files/heroes_3505.jpg

    does look like yelling, perhaps de-emphasizing some of the less important words
    would make it more readable. \r\n\r\nwith our\r\nHUGE DISCOUNTS\r\nthere has never
    been a\r\nbetter TIME TO\r\nEXPLORE ITALY\r\nwith BRITISH AIRWAYS\r\n\r\n...or
    something like that. Needs work, but the idea is get the consumer to see a more
    direct message right away.\r\n\r\nAlso, I like the graphic of the colusseum and
    the opera house. It has a nice negative/positive space feel to it - it just needs
    to be worked into the design better.\r\n\r\nhope that helps."

    the copy doesn't need to be, and probably shouldn't be, the same size. \r\n\r\nYou
    really need to make the colors you choose match the country on the poster (Italy-green/red,
    America-red/blue, etc.). \r\n\r\nI think the Colosseum and the Sydney Opera house
    silhouettes looked good, they just needed to be incorporated better with the type
    and color schemes. \r\n\r\nTry making \"Explore Italy\" the biggest type, add
    the Colosseum illo back in, put the supporting type in 1/2 or 1/3 the size of
    your \"headline\" and incorporate the green/white/red color scheme."
