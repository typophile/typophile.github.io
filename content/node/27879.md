  wanted to communicate simple, and nothing too distracting in the look.\r\n\r\nThe
  type, I couldn't find a more simple serif font with ligatures. Want something clean
  and simple. Suggestions welcome.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I think the masthead works better
  without the icon and background ... on it's own in a way. Let me know your thoughts
  anyway."

  body: This looks very nice. I would lean towards the top treatment - an icon that
    can be used above or to the side of the type. The way you have used sharper angular
    lines, and smoother curved lines in the brain does bother me. I would smooth out
    and curve all those lines on the inside, the contrast of forms draws attention
    to the lines too much. Would probably look at some other type options as well,
    not that this is bad though. Nice work.

  body: "I agree with the 2 previous posts: the typography part looks really great
    (nice colours too), but the brain could use a make-over. More curvy lines & perhaps
    a few more \"bumps\" at the top might do the trick.\r\nLike Chris said: they do
    work better next to eachother or perhaps maybe even separately (like Mercedes
    has a logo & a type-logo that are hardly used together)."
