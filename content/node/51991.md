  and middle [[middle school|http://pi-schools.sch.gr/gymnasio/]] school that are
  used in Greece (for students and teachers).\r\n\r\nI am neither a type designer
  nor a typographer, but I think that the typography of almost every book there is
  horrible; a collage of bad advertising, Post-it notes and text \"enriched\" with
  some cacographic fonts bundled in book format. There are a few publishers responsible
  for the typesetting, so the quality is not uniform. \r\n\r\nIn Greece, sloppiness
  is the ruling phenomenon. What happens to other countries?"

    are slow from your link so it his hard to get a fair viewing, Children's books
    in the USA run the gamut from outstanding to terrible. You can check Amazon who
    has a textbook section as well as searching for children's books and judge for
    yourself. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/\r\n\r\nI attended Greek School here in
    America as a child and remeber the books being of poor quality. I presume thiswas
    just what was available in the U.S. at the time (1948-1956).\r\n\r\nChrisL\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    thought that every state has different books in the US. I will give a look at
    Amazon.com as well. My feeling is that schoolbooks are getting worse."

  body: "Yes, every State has chosen their own books but often they choose the same
    books because publishers do not make many different ones. There are perhaps 5
    to choose from per grade. Sometimes only 3 because the ones with greatest use
    are cheapest so schools pick the cheapest.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
