body: 'I was wondering if anyone knew the exact ratio of Futura''s perfect circle
  lowercase "o". In other words how much larger the "outer" circle is than the "inner"
  to make up the weight of the letterform? '

  body: "1.625 is almost exactly the Golden Ratio (1.618).\r\n\r\nBut be careful.
    The O in Futura is not a perfect circle. It's slightly wider than it is tall,
    at least that's what I see when I convert Futura to outlines in InDesign and then
    look at the W and H dimensions: \r\n\r\n12 pt Futura by Adobe\r\n\r\nLight\r\nW
    = 0p9.383\r\nH =  0p9.286\r\n\r\nBook\r\nW = 0p9.43\r\nH =  0p9.358\r\n\r\nBold\r\nW
    = 0p10.007\r\nH =  0p9.647\r\n\r\n"
