body: In one of my college lessons, its states that typography refers to mechanically-reproduced
  letters while calligraphy refers to hand-rendered letters. I wondered if this is
  technically correct, despite the general use of the word "typography" to refer to
  the study and use of letterforms?

  body: It's correct.  Typography is the arrangement of pre-made pieces, whereas calligraphy
    always involves creating something new that didn't exist before (even the pieces).

  body: I guess my use of the word "new" is pretty ambiguous here.  I mean a calligrapher
    creates a new physical object, not arranging old pieces to make a new object.  Even
    though I guess you could say that the calligraphers style doesn't have to be new.  Hmmm,
    this is actually harder to explain than I thought it was.  Somebody help me out
    here?
