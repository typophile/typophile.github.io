    to me.

  body: "Thanks, Ryuk, I'm not sure though. It's very close but the counters in the
    image above seem smaller to me. For example, with the 'a' and 'e'.\r\n\r\nIt almost
    looks like a parody of Avenir and/or Frutiger."

  body: The BBC has commissioned a large number of proprietary fonts, some unique
    to each of BBC1, 2, 3, and 4.  Most, if not all of them, created by FontSmith.
    I've collected samples of a few dozen from their website(s), but don't have one
    identical to this.

  body: Mm, thanks HVB, I looked at Fontsmith's site but there's only one font for
    the BBC featured there. Would be interested to see your collection! Have you put
    it anywhere online?

  body: Totally agree with rtaylor (screen effect?).  Another point giving credit
    to Avenir is the reference on [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Two#Presentation|BBC
    Two page on Wikipedia]] for the tagline 'TWO'. It could also be a custom version
    of Avenir exclusively done for BBC.

  body: Another detail that could either be screen effect or design in the sample
    above is what looks like a cutoff on the 't' sloping down from left to right.
