  to replace.\r\nIt is to be adapted for Europe, so I don\u2019t need to know anything
  about Japanese language fonts. But there is text set in latin, too. I need to know
  common fonts with similar metrics to replace:\r\n\r\nA\u2013OTF Gothic BBB Pro Medium\r\nA\u2013OTF
  Gothic MB 101 Pro B\r\nA\u2013OTF ShingoGo Pro (the latin part looks like Eurostile)\r\nA\u2013OTF
  Futo Go\r\n\r\nAlso there is Helvetica in there:\r\n\r\nHelvetica LT Std \r\nHelvetica
  Neue LT Std\r\n\r\nWhat does the LT stand for or mean?\r\n\r\nAny help much appreciated
  (by Akira maybe?)."

  body: "Hi Jan,\r\n\r\nGothic BBB Medium and Futo Go are very similar fonts and you
    may regard them as fonts in the same family. Those are the most formal fonts among
    them that you listed.\r\nGothic MB101 B is more casual than the two.\r\nShingo
    Go, whose counters are very wide, is the most casual and modern.\r\n\r\nSo you
    should replace Shingo Go with a font whose counters are wide, whose x-height is
    high and which is casual and modern.\r\nGothic MB101 B has a modern feel, too.
    Modern fonts might be good. Of course, Neue Helvetica is O. K., too. In my opinion,
    Grotesques fit rather than Humanistic Sans Serifs.\r\nGothic BBB Medium and Futo
    Go are more formal. So you could replace them with Neue Helvetica or any other
    Grotesques and Humanistic Sans Serifs.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nAkira"

  body: "Thank you, Akira.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m mostly concerned about replacing the latin
    parts of the fonts. Am I running into trouble with the metrics if I replace everything
    with Helvetica? Is the latin part of A-OTF Futo Go a lot narrower than Helvetica
    for example?"

  body: "I\u2019m sorry I misunderstood what you meant. I seem to have to study English
    more.\r\nDo you mean you would like to replace latin characters of the Japanese
    fonts with other latin fonts and you would not like to change the widths of the
    words very much?\r\nIndeed the latin part of Futo Go looks narrower than Helvetica,
    but if you set text in the both fonts, they are not different very much, I think.\r\nThe
    latin parts of Gothic MB101 and Shin Go are very wide. So you might run into trouble
    if you replace them with Helvetica.\r\nSorry I\u2019m no good at English and cannot
    help you very much.\r\n\r\nAnyway, for people that have not seen the latin parts
    of the Japanese fonts:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/japanesefonts01_5791.gif]"
