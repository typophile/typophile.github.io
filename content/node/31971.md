  body: Besides Computer Modern, there are many free math fonts available for TeX.  Many
    of these will also work with other programs.  They can be obtained at <a href="http://ctan.tug.org/">CTAN</a>.  Of
    interest might be this <a href="http://tug.ctan.org/cgi-bin/getFile.py?fn=/info/Free_Math_Font_Survey/en/survey.pdf">survey</a>
    of free math fonts that can be used in TeX.

  body: If you are willing to spend a few dollars, Adobe sells Lucida Math fonts (three
    fonts) for $79. These are based on the characters in the free Computer Modern
    fonts in TeX, but look nicer (to me, anyway).
