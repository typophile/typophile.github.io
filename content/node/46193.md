  short, Marlboro is no longer allowed to put their logo on the F1 car they used to
  put it on.\r\n\r\nInstead, they have what looks like a bar code, and I suspect it
  to be a subliminal add in which the \"bar code stripes\" correspond to the vertical
  strokes of the wordmark. When I saw this for the first time, approximately 2 minutes
  ago, my first instinct was \"is that some sort of font/wordmark?\" With Phillip
  Morris footing the bill I'm positive they have a team of psychologists on this job.\r\n\r\nI
  am currently trying to find a good shot of this bar code, yet I have also come across
  certain variations. Lhe link at the top of the page is the one I just saw. It also
  appears on the backs of the pit crew's shirts &c.\r\n\r\nCan anyone help crack this
  code?"

    scheme is weird enough to be written about in the racing press, and enough fans
    will find out what the barcode and colors mean for this to be a relatively effective
    advertising campaign even without the Marlboro logo."
