  to in his album cover for Sleep through the static? It may actually be a custom
  face but if anyone has an idea of what it may be based that would help as well.\r\n\r\nJC[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Jack_Johnson_4273.jpg]"

    are all different from each other, and the baseline and letter sizes are not consistent.\r\n\r\n
