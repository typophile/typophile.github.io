body: "Hello all,\r\n\r\nI'm working on a long text about a school where the classes
  are named after the initials of the teachers. The text is full of references to
  old pupils of the school with the class initials and year in brackets after their
  names, e.g. Mickey Mouse (JEC'89).\r\n\r\nAttempting to follow Bringhurst, my plan
  was to not set the initials in small caps on the grounds that they are initials.
  However, since there are so many of these in the text, it looks pretty ugly next
  to the old-style numbers I'm using.\r\n\r\nWould it be wrong to set them in small
  caps?\r\n\r\nAnd if I do, will the small-cap initials and old-style numbers be a
  bit overwhelmed by the brackets?\r\n\r\nI guess I would still keep ordinary initials
  (e.g. M. Mouse) with an ordinary capital letter.\r\n\r\nOn a related note, capital
  or small-cap for something like \"B Team\"?\r\n\r\nText will be set in some form
  of Caslon (probably King's Caslon).\r\n\r\nyour expert help much appreciated. thanks!"

    has been discussion in the past about the use of small caps. In your specific
    case, I would say if it looks better then use the small caps.\r\n\r\nYou probably
    want to use a font where the small caps are bigger than the x-height. I'm not
    sure if the Caslon types do this or not.\r\n \r\nAnother approach is no small
    caps at all, just use a font where the height of the regular capital letters is
    less, such as Gentium, Greta Text, Malabar, or others. This is my preference,
    to keep it simple."
