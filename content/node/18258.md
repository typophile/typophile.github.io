body: "i am currently taking a Typography One evening course and i was wondering if
  people could tell me what i should expect from the class.\r\n\r\ni was hoping that
  we would start off with some nitty-gritty exploration of the mechanics of type and
  would be learning by inking or hand-lettering letterforms. so far, we haven't really
  done any of that. we just dove right in and were given assignments with almost no
  discussion about basic things that i had expected to learn (spacing, scale, measurement,
  etc.)\r\n\r\ni enrolled in the class to learn the very fundamentals of working with
  type, but it seems like we are skipping far ahead without first learning the basics.\r\n\r\nam
  i wrong to assume that the class would cover first-things first?\r\n\r\nbtw, the
  course is offered by a \"respected\" art school.\r\n\r\nthanks for any insight."

    and I suspect that there are as many \"ideal\" ideas for a Type 1 class as there
    are Type 1 instructors.\r\n\r\nI can only say what I learned in Type 1. We learned
    to group some typefaces in five, very basic categories (sans serif = Futura, old
    style = Garamond, transitional = Baskerville, modern = Bodoni, slab serif = Serifa).\r\n\r\nWe
    also learned how to properly space letters next to one another, how to space words,
    and lastly, how to space a few lines. That was it, and actually, that was quite
    a bit of work. We had a series to accompanying type history/terminology lectures.
    The stuff went over my head, but later, after having it repeated to me several
    times over the next semester and a hlaf, I got it, and was glad.\r\n\r\nbtw, my
    course was offered by a \"respected\" art school ;-)\r\n\r\nhope that helps\u2026"

    spacing words and lines and stuff like that before being given assignments to
    design a poster, etc."

    list of books to read up on. Is there a textbook associated with the course?\r\n\r\nJames
    Craig's <em>Designing with Type</em> is used at many schools. There are project
    descriptions and many student samples of assignments you can review at the official

    i am asking ;)\r\n"

  body: "Without knowing the approach of your instructor, an initial \"practical use\"
    of type could lead to a better understanding of the mechanics <em>provided</em>
    that the class assignments are critiqued on the basis of fundamental typography
    and not \"graphic design\" criteria.\r\n\r\nThat could stimulate class discussion
    and participation as analysis <em>after the fact</em> with the intent of redoing
    the assignment with new found understanding of fundamentals, followed by another
    group critique.\r\n\r\nAs I said, I don't know the planned curriculum or stated
    outcome of the course (this should be clearly stated in the school's course description),
    but several instructors have voiced their personal frustrations to me regarding
    the building of effective and viable typography courses.\r\n\r\nIncidentally,
    I have just devised an interesting class assignment for beginning graphic design
    and typography students. It's in the early stages and not field tested yet, but
    the intent is to help students develop a sensitivity to type [[color]] and how
    to use it as an element of page layout."

  body: I find it surprising that there is no intro to type history at the start of
    the course to help ground you and show you where type comes from. After all, how
    can you understand where you're going if you don't know where you've been? Was
    there a pre-requisite for the course in terms of knowledge or understanding? I'd
    certainly address the instructor or school regarding this.

    your teacher's lesson plan is one thing, expressing what you hope to gain is another.
    If you weren't given a lesson plan (or you were and it is devoid of the history
    and mechanics), I would suggest you approach your professor. Don't ask them to
    change the schedule, but let them know what you're interested in.\r\n\r\nAt the
    very least, they could give you extra-curricular guidance or inform you of the
    appropriate class to apply for next semester. It may be that be as simple as a
    misleading nomenclature of the courses.\r\n\r\nGood Luck,\r\nDeWitt"

    to teach you. It's your time and money, and you won't be getting it back.
