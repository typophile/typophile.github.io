body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nIn InDesign there are two options in the justification window; adobe
  paragraph composer and adobe single-line compser.\r\nMy guide books recommands me
  to use the first one but it doesn't tell me why. I don't like to be told what to
  do if I don't understand why I am doing it. Can you guys tell me what this is all
  about?\r\n\r\nCheers"

  body: "As I understand it, the single-line composer does the best it can justifying
    each line. Having done that, it then justifies the next line to the best <em>it</em>
    can be given what has gone before, and so forth. \r\n\r\nBut better spacing overall
    can often be achieved by considering the paragraph as a whole. For instance, the
    \"best\" justification for line 1 (considered alone) may lead to very bad breaks
    for lines 2 and 3. It may be that by having a slightly worse break for line 1,
    you can have much better breaks for lines 2 and 3, and the overall effect will
    be better. The paragraph composer does that: it looks at the paragraph as a whole
    and, as it were, notices \"If I break this line here I get terrible spacing later;
    maybe it would be better to break it there instead, and improve the spacing of
    later lines.\"\r\n\r\nThe advice to use the paragraph composer generally is therefore
    sound: overall it should result in better (more intelligently) justified text."

    It's faster. In this day of 2GHz+ processors, that's <em>really</em> unlikely
    to matter much.\r\n\r\n2. The results are a bit more predictable when you're editing
    text. In particular, when you make an edit at the very end of the paragraph, it
    won't change much at all. The whole-paragraph option could easily reflow the whole
    thing. If one were using InDesign to key in large pieces of text (as opposed to
    importing them from elsewhere), that could be distracting.\r\n\r\nSo, bottom line,
    for the vast majority of users, there's no good reason at all. But software developers
    <em>love</em> leaving in options as opposed to making up their mind about what's
    the best thing to do."

  body: "It seems to me though that software is <cite>always</cite> pushing the hardware's
    limits (maybe due to a lazy attitude towards code optimization, and/or guided
    by a desire for eventual/perpetual upgrade fees...) and I can think of two recent
    example: InDesign's somewhat brutish (but necessary, performace-wise) use of a
    bilinear algorirthm for optical spacing, instead of a smooth (ideally quadratic,
    or maybe parabolic?) curve; and MS forsaking vertical hinting in CT (until Longhorn/Vista).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Actually, I use the single-line composer a fair bit. For finicky layout problems,
    the last thing I want is to be fighting with a computer that is making decisions
    for me. Single line composer is really useful when I need to make a course description
    fit onto a certain number of lines. With paragraph composer on it often ignores
    the discretionary hyphens I want it to use; it's difficult to force the paragraph
    composer to do what you want. So when it's important that I squeeze that last
    word onto the line above, I'll try the single line composer.    \r\n\r\nKristina."
