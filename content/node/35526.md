  body: Next time maybe do a search if you know what you're looking for. A search
    for "Lula" came up with <a href="http://www.typophile.com/node/31374">this</a>
    and <a href="http://www.typophile.com/node/34457">this thread</a>. Then you even
    wouldn't have had to wait almost ten minutes. ;^)

    to do a search first, but then i forgot (thinking that it was unlikely perhaps).
    i have learned my lesson.\r\n\r\nit seems the Lula magazine font is a big hit!\r\n\r\n(maybe
    i should be worried...)\r\n\r\n: )"

    don't know how to do a search? i remember now. i had typed in \"lula' in the search
    box in the upper right, and got only this one thread, about a restaurant in chicago.\r\n\r\nhmm.
    i think i better figure out how to use the search function on this website....[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lula_chicago_6690.png]"
