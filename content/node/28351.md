body: "G'day Philiers,\r\n\r\nI'm designing a logotype for a major organisation for
  the first time (well it's the first time for a straight-faced kind of logo) and
  I'm a bit lost as to what steps to take. I've worked the idea up to a fairly high
  level on paper and I feel it's getting close to the time where I take it into Illustrator
  and make the weights consistent and the curves even but this is where I'm a bit
  scared, my pen tool skills are a bit rudimentary and I tend to make things lumpy.
  Also I'm not aware of the conventions when it comes to what curves can be repeated,
  how curves should look and so on. If there any tricks or rules or ways of working
  that people could throw my way or links to good sites (I'm ordering Leslie Carbaga's
  book soon but it won't arrive in time to help me as I only have a week or so) or
  anything at all I would be very appreciative, I know the request is a bit vague
  but I've never really done this high detail formal kind of design before so I'm
  not even really sure what to ask. I'd love any help you can give me\r\nthanks for
  reading\r\n\r\n--N"

    direction. It's a bit of a broad question.

  body: "Thanks for the sites David :) i had seen type workshop before and I had a
    quick look at briem, they seem both to be on the brief side but I realise such
    a general question doesn't really do itself any favours, thanks again :)\r\n\r\ni
    thought long and hard about whether or not to post this but I decided education
    was more important than pride\r\n\r\nhttp://home.iprimus.com.au/nkgross/quakers_1.gif\r\n\r\nThis
    is very very very (very) early days. I realise the Q is wobbly and ALL the strokes
    are uneven. I guess at this stage I'm looking for comments on the structure and
    general shapes of the letters. I want the logo type to have a leg in both script
    and san-serif land. I'd also appreciate comments on what shape components I can
    repeat to add consistancy, the height and width of letters in relation to other
    letters and any other tricks to make things consistent and to get the proportions
    correct. I'm happiest with the 'u', the 'a' and the general form of the Q for
    what it's worth,\r\nthanks very much \r\n\r\n--N"

  body: "Like the idea and the Q. The s doesn't connect to the rest of the word, it's
    currently \"Quaker s\" (makes me think about Racer X). Is the name of the client
    \"Quakers\" or \"Quaker's\"?\r\n\r\nThe \"r\" feels like it doesn't quite belong,
    seeming a little \"tense\" in relation to the freeflowing letters that precede
    it. To enhance the scriptlikequality, more \"flow\" between letters is called
    for. Like modifying some of the letterforms so that the word would be possible
    to write without lifting pen from paper or changing stroke direction too often.
    The letters can connect, but they don't have to.\r\n\r\nTracing paper is a great
    tool for trying out variants of letters."

  body: "Thanks Stefan,\r\n\r\nyes the 's' is far too far out, I lessened the width
    of it and just didn't pop it back nearly enough. Helpful thoughts about the scriptlike
    quality and esp. the 'r', I've thought this myself, i'm thinking the top arm of
    the 'k' should perhaps mimic the Right hand end of the 'Q's tail and perhaps the
    arm of the 'r' could be similar to the tail of the 'a',\r\nyes tracing paper :)
    and lots of it\r\n\r\nI'm concious of not letting it stray too much into scriptland,
    I like some of the bluntness to it\r\nthanks again\r\n\r\n--N"

  body: "Best advice I can give you is when you use the pen tool let the bezier handles
    go out on both sides and constrain them with the shift key, it will help avoid
    some of the lumpiness; use as few points as possible and try to keep them at the
    extreme points. I normally draw one version up roughly and then duplicate the
    layer before refining then duplicate again so you can go back to earlier versions
    without command zedding and losing bits you wanted to keep, I find that better
    than saving mulitple versions of the document. Outlining similar fonts can give
    you some good tips as well.\r\nIt does get easier (note I didn't say easy) :)\r\nTim"
