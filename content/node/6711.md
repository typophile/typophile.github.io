    Types&#34; <BR>in 1985. It was featured in Fine Print &#40;I think&#41;. <BR>Great

  body: thanks Eric, <BR>I started the search for the document or you know where I
    can get it in Europe? <BR>In the mean time I still would like to know about the
    characteristics in comparison to Bembo, or Centaur for example. <BR>Has anybody
    set text in the Monotype version? <BR> <BR> <BR>Patricia

  body: 'Patricia <BR> <BR>I have hand-set and printed both the Monotype Centaur and
    the Bembo. Is that what you are asking? I am not sure what characteristics you
    are looking for but in terms of their technical function, they did differ from
    other Monotype issues &#40;Monotype Centaur was a particularly weak face in this
    regard&#41;: <BR> <BR>While quite beautiful and desireable typeface designs, as
    a pressman I found them to be tragically flawed. The bar on the lowercase e is
    quite weak and erodes quickly with repeated impression. I always bought plenty
    of e sorts because of that. <BR> <BR>The digital versions however, hold up well
    when printed with the photopolymer plate process. This may be due to a change
    in the design &#40;none of the digital versions are exact replications of the
    metal&#41; but I suspect it is more simply the differing substructure characteristics
    of the two transfer materials, that is, that the polymer provides better relief
    support to the crossbar.'

  body: Patricia, <BR> <BR>I also have used the two faces. Although I set the text
    on a Monotype. The types themselves would be identical to Gerald Lange&#39;s,
    at least in image, if not in metal formulae. <BR> <BR>I did not notice Gerald&#39;s
    objections with the cross bar. It may have been because of the metal alloy. It
    may also have been because  Monotype keyboarded text was always fresh, or at least

  body: 'Thanks much for the great technical insight  Gerald L. and Gerald G. <BR>but
    there is still for me the doubt about the digital versions; <BR>-which characteristics
    or patterns define Dante? <BR> I read for example that Marderstieg&#39;s Griffo&#39;s
    &#34;source&#34; is Bembo; <BR>Dante has the spirit of Griffo&#39;s work, said
    Bringhurst, <BR>So that brings the two of them to the French Old Style,   <BR>then,
    which digital version is the best bet: <BR>Monotype Bembo or Monotype Dante? <BR>

  body: Patricia <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve always favored Dante over Bembo but to answer your
    question. The Bembo was an earlier digital issue and may very well have been based
    on the photofilm version of Bembo rather than the metal. The Dante however, which
    was a much later release,  was based on the metal patterns. At least that is what
    I recall. When Monotype Typography issued the digital Dante they put out a very
    nice prospectus detailing the production of it. At the time there were a number
    of reviews as well, including my own in _The Typographer_.  <BR> <BR>You might
    also look into Pastonchi. When Monotype released it they put out an amazing prospectus
    which included samples of Marderstieg&#39;s work with it. When Monotype Typography
    released the digital version &#40;I believe it was their last before they merged
    with Agfa&#41;, it was a direct replication of the metal. I had printed a book
    with the metal version and the day I finished I was sent a beta version of the
    Pastonchi release. I did the prospectus using the digital and printing it letterpress.
    Quite nearly right on. <BR> <BR>Gerald

    remember the association. It shut down in the early 90s. Every pub I write for
    tends to shut down almost immediately afterward. Hmmm. But there probably is a
    library somewhere... <BR> <BR>The Dante review was part of a longer piece on Monotype/Lanston
