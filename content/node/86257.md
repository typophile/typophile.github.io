  body: It's a tricky one. A lot of it feels like early, pre-Helvetica grotesques,
    like Akzidenz-grotesk, Monotype Grotesque, Ideal Grotesque or Venus, though it's
    none of these.

  body: Was this photographed or scanned from a page in a book? If so, look on title
    page and copyright page and post the name and nationality of the publisher and
    the year of publication. That might help someone on the site to make an ID.
