  completely on-line.\r\n\r\nWe want to see how it might be possible to teach a full
  studio course on design using only the internet.  Utilizing the Loyola University
  New Orleans Blackboard format as the administrative center, we are teaching the
  studio experience through reading, writing and creating with blogs, MySpace and
  Youtube.  The Media Services department is videotaping tutorials for us which will
  be uploaded to Blackboard, and, we are creating our own mini-tutorials through ScreenFlow.\r\n\r\nEach
  week the students have to create a digital \"sketchbook\" entry 5 days a week and
  post to their account in MySpace.  Also, we all work on a weekly collaborative project
  that is shared and exhibited in the class MySpace account. Each student is responsible
  for posting a 200 word blog in their Typophile account and for commenting on 2 peer's
  blogs and 2 professional blogs weekly as well."

    make assignments like 'post two comments on this or that web site/newsgroup/forum'
    and that can tend to annoy the natives. ;o)\r\n\r\nAlso, just a personal opinion,
    myspace is the student-overflow-flimsy-rented-trailer-in-the-parking-lot of classrooms
    ;0)\r\n\r\nAll that said, sounds like a really interesting project!\r\n"

  body: "Dear Aluminum,\r\n\r\nThank you for your insights.  As to your reservations,
    allow me to explain:\r\n\r\nI am 53 and Daniela was born in the 70s; I have practiced
    graphic design for over 32 years, hold an MFA in graphic design, mentored young
    designers since 1980 and taught type and design at the university level for over
    four years.  Daniela's MFA is from Cal Arts and she is a tenured professor of
    Graphic Design at Loyola University of Loyola.  She is also on leave from being
    \ a member of the board of directors of the Education Steering Committee of AIGA.\r\n\r\nI
    attend TypeCon annually so that I can hear for myself what is going on in the
    field professionally and educationally.  Also, this past semester I taught \"Design
    for Music Industry Majors\" which is kind of the audio equivalent of design, sort
    of.  The students were all seniors at Loyola University Loyola and all very very
    bright.  What I learned from them about life and work through the internet blew
    my socks off.\r\n\r\nThese kids are our competition; they work harder, faster,
    smarter.  Though they lack the long view of aged wisdom, they instinctively KNOW
    what is going on and how to compete in the marketplace.  Sometimes I think of
    students as the gorilla fighters in an information war who compete against behemoths
    like old scholars, mature professionals and major corporations.\r\n\r\nYouth often
    annoys but it is our job to show them the way.  As long as anyone is polite and
    respectful in any arena, I believe they are welcome.\r\n\r\nDaniela and I decided
    to throw ourselves into this arena to see, while using heavily controlled and
    directed supervision, how we could teach a studio course, like design, in this
    very accessible and popular medium."
