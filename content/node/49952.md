  to you as a plea for help. I admire the level of expertise visible on this board.\r\n\r\nI
  am working on a personal logo and, although I have gotten it where I am suitably
  happy, areas of the script and swashes I have drawn feel clearly off for reasons
  I do not have the capacity to articulate. It is posted below in the hopes that I
  can be guided in the general direction to resolve this (as it is totally bugging
  the hell out of me).\r\n\r\nBelow is an image and attached is a PDF, for anyone
  who cares to look at it. Thanks!\r\n\r\nAny comments on the logo generally are completely
  welcome, it's for my own portfolio / business cards etc.\r\n\r\nYours forever,\r\nNelson\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/omb_logo_5383.gif]"

  body: it looks great ! it looks like a vintage logo but with the name you've choose
    "one-man brand" (a good pun with "one-man band") i think you're in that kind of
    universe. so, let's go !

    in \"The\" needs a little work. I know that it is an \"e\" in context the word
    it is used in, however it looks more like an \"o\" than an \"e.\" That said, the
    logo is very well done.\r\n\r\n\r\n-----------------------\r\nMichael Browers\r\nwww.michaelbrowers.com"

  body: "The h and e of The looks like they were done with a confident stroke of the
    brush, the vertical bar of the T however looks a little overworked. It's almost
    spot on but there's just something small that bothers me a bit. Or is it the lower
    swoosh that's a positioned badly? Not sure. Try this: try flip the graphic horizontally
    so you're \"looking at it in the mirror\" and see if it still holds together well.
    You might find this technique reveals to you some useful hint on how to finish
    it off perfectly.\r\n\r\nLooks like a whiskey or old fashioned beer label. nice."

  body: "Any thought of moving the lower swash to the bottom of the logo, below BRAND?
    Right now it raises and underscores \"The,\" neither of which is necessary. \r\n\r\nI'm
    getting a bit of \"Jhe\" instead of \"The.\"\r\n\r\nMaybe a hair more space between
    One and Man - unless you intended an interCaps look.\r\n\r\nKerning in BRAND -
    BR is too close, maybe a bit too much space around the A, too.\r\n\r\nThis is
    very appealing."

  body: "eliason is spot on with your kerning issue in BRAND and the spacing between
    One and Man.\r\n\r\nThe other comments are more or less opinions and valid ones
    at that, but I am going to say I like the underscore swoosh that you have right
    now simply because I think it adds a vertical dimension to your logo which is
    nice. Many logos lack that.\r\n\r\nAbout eliason's comment of seeing Jhe, I wonder
    if this might be a solution:\r\nLook at the top \"serif\" of the J, see how it
    points to the right. What would happen if you slightly had it extend to the left?
    I'm not a type expert so it's just a guess, but could work.\r\n\r\nPity CocaCola
    doesn't have a T in it because that would be your answer!"

  body: First I like this a lot and think you have done a terrific job. However, I
    too see Jhe One Man Brand. Perhaps if the vertical of the T were to extend slightly
    higher than the h? So it's still not touching the cross bar of the t but is close
    to kissing it? Also I tend to want to nudge the underscore a tiny bit to the left,
    just a tiny bit.

    And all criticism is of value.\r\n\r\nSpecifics with spacing and kerning I seem
    to struggle with. I get so caught up in microscopic changes I have a tendency
    to ignore the bigger relationships. \r\n\r\nI think there is some truth to the
    claim that the first is more appealing, in my efforts to stabilize it I have effectively
    neutralized some of the embellishment and indeed verticality I initially had.
    \ I am working on a medium between the two, using a more restrained stem for the
    capital T.\r\n\r\nAgain, thanks for all the help."

  body: "No one else has mentioned this so perhaps it's only me, but I think there
    are kerning problems with the words \"ONE MAN\". Specifically, the spacing on
    both sides of the A is more open than the rest of the line. There are three possible
    ways to fix (or at least improve on this):\r\n\r\n1) Tighten up the spacing on
    each side of the A. To make the spacing exactly visually equal it would probably
    be necessary to let the bottom serifs of MAN touch each other, which you may or
    may not like depending on your personal preferences.\r\n\r\n2) Open up the spacing
    of the rest of the line to match the spacing around the A. Again, you may or may
    not like this option.\r\n\r\n3) The third option would be to fudge between the
    two previous options: Close up the spaces on each side of the A until the lower
    serifs are almost, but not quite touching. Then open up the spacing of the rest
    of the line a little -- again not quite enough to exactly match the visual spacing
    around the A. The result will be a line that, although not exactly spaced equally,
    is close to equal without resorting to the extremes of the first two options."

    some thing more tied in so there is less  jhe  confusion..and maybe simplify with

  body: "I agree with the positive reviews. \r\nPerhaps the \"e\" looks a bit like
    an \"o\" because of how the \"T\" and \"h\" are leaning. It looks to me like those
    two letters are leaning forward while the \"e\" is almost upright if not leaning
    back.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying to pull back the angle of the \"T\" & \"h\". I think
    its best to match their \"oblique-ness\" with your \"e\".\r\n\r\nBesides that
    the symbol/script quality of \"The\" compliments your main type choice well. I
    enjoy the extra space in \"brand\" and the tightness of \"One Man\". Though maybe
    those 2 words need a hair more space between them (sorry to nit pick).\r\n\r\nGood
    job."

    the criticism of the letter \"E\" (either it is leaning to the wrong side, hurting
    legibility, or looks like an \"o\") led me to the realization that it kind of
    looks like a flat tire. I redrew it as more of an italic than a script.\r\n\r\nStill

    come up at a similar angle to the loop of the h. That will give your script more
    of a flowing rhythm and will allow you to join to the e in a similar way to the
    old version but at a height closer to the new one. The new crossbar of the T is
    a lot better."
