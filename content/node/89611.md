body: "Hi\r\n\r\nI was reading over on another thread on here that IE7 might not just
  turn CT on at an app level but at an OS level too when installed. Can anyone confirm
  that it will turn CT on system wide by default?\r\n\r\nMy scenario is that I've
  been overseeing a large website build which potentially could have a larger than
  average number of legacy users locked to IE6 due to out of date institutionalised
  systems. We have hand picked a selection of typefaces for both legacy and optimum
  setups (in regards to CT rendering)  and i now need to confirm to the coder which
  scenarios to display which typefaces (based on their hinting). I currently have
  legacy typefaces (B&W) set to be displayed in Windows XP IE6 and all Chrome (as
  these browsers down force CT on). HOWEVER if IE7 is turned on at a system level
  when installed i'd be more likely to only apply legacy typefaces to IE6 as i think
  its more likely that a user using chrome is likely to have IE7 installed.\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nMatt"
