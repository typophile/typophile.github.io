    designed this typeface in 2003 in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the
    Master of Arts in Typeface Design, from The University of Reading.\r\nMaiola was
    one of the TDC2 2004 winning entries. This typeface was recently added to the
    FontFont library, and first appeared in its Catalogue 2004-05 Addendum, on page
    3. It covers Extended Latin, Greek and Cyrillic.\r\nI find it amazing the way
    she handled the curves. It's a beautiful typeface full of (Czech) character.\r\n"

  body: "<em>>Why has this thread fallen off the front page? It took me ages to find

    category is quite self-explanatory I guess. The threads that go into the <strong>Hanpicked</strong>
    category are indeed literally handpicked by the moderators. For example I promoted
    Joe's birthday thread to the front page for one day only and removed it after
    that. The <strong>Hottest:</strong> category is somewhat more complicated, so
    I'll let Christian do some 'splainin':\r\n\r\n<cite>\"The algorithm that picks
    the hottest simply picks the threads that have the most posts in the last four
    days. So a thread that got a lot of attention on the first day, but none on the
    next three will drop off quickly. A thread can't just rest on its laurels, it's
    got to stay hot. We decided to do it this way so that the content would cycle
    pretty quickly and stay fresh.\"</cite>"

    alphabet. And we already know it isn't an X.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this is a typeface
    that I do not own (or have) so I took this character from a PDF sample. I didn't
    realize it until later last night but I chose one of the many alternate characters
    in this font. I know it isn't much of a clue, but the designer of this typeface
    usually builds a lot of alternates into his fonts."

    's' slot</a>... But the glyph itself is cap height so technically it's a capital
