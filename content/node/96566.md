body: "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nI don't use the forum for a while. I've been centered on other
  kind of job. More around web design and such. Now that I've thinking on getting
  back to typography got back!\r\n\r\nWhat is happening with the typophile layout?
  The older one was better in my point of view. This one doesn't really gets a nice
  and responsive layout. Sometimes DIVs get on top of each other. Why the complete
  and sudden change?"

    recruitment Group</a>  I must say that sharing your thoughts with one another
    is an easy way to relax yourself in the daily hectic routines. <a href="http://manpoweragenciesinpakistan.com/">Manpower
    services</a>  Each time a description of the change, there are always lots of
    talk about it anywhere. These are not exempt. I mean one must be up to date with
    the day to day change in the environment and in the technology as well. <a href="http://staffingagenciesinpakistan.com/">Global
    staffing services</a>  In my personal opinion, the world is turning into a global
    village and now you can get a lot of required information by just a click while
