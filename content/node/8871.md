body: 'I am learning FontLab, trial and error. When I exported a Mac Suitcase, there
  came a message saying something about the &#34;R&#34; not having all curves connected,
  the R was left out from the font and, in the glyph panel, the &#34;R&#34; became
  highlighted in red.  <BR> <BR>See image: <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/63859.jpg"
  alt="Screen dump of red highlight"> <BR> <BR>Since that, I&#39;ve tried to make
  the highlight disappear. Now, the &#34;R&#34; is included when I generate suitcases,
  there seems to be no open curves and I&#39;ve done all I can come to think of: still,
  the red highligtning is still there.  <BR> <BR>Can you tell me why?'

  body: Per, <BR>Control Click on the red glyph; a contextual menu will pop up onscreen;
    scroll down to the submenu color section and select &#34;none&#34;.  You can use
    this menu for multiple glyphs and color code them as desired as an organizing
    tool. <BR> <BR>ChrisL
