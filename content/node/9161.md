body: Anyone planning to go to the How conference this year in Chicago? <BR> <BR><a
  href="http://www.howconference.com"> How 05</a> to check it out if you have not
  heard. <BR> <BR>Also, if anyone here has attended in the past, what did you think?
  I am considering attending the upcoming conference for the first time, but am wondering
  how &#40;no pun intended&#41; good it is. <BR> <BR>Mike

  body: I spoke at a How conference in the late &#39;90s, in Atlanta. I only knew
    a few people there &#40;Matthew Carter, Tim Starback from Emigre, and the Wahlers
    from the TDC&#41;, which was a bit of a drag because the conference is very large
    and not at all intimate. It was also very much focused on graphic design, and
    Matthew and I gave the only two specifically type related talks. So if you&#39;re
    looking for something typophiliac you are probably much better off going to Typecon
    in New York.
