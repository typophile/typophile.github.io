  offer For small and medium sized companies all-inclusive it-support with open-source-software
  and the creation of content-management-systems (cms).\r\nSo it\xB4s a bit like \"Turn
  the existing chaos into a clear system\"\r\n\r\nit\xB4s a selfmade font, together
  with different signs.\r\nthe color will be either yellow (m30, y100) with cyan (100%)
  or one of them together with black.\r\nnow it\xB4s time to decide which one is the
  best (or throw them away and create new ones ...)\r\n\r\nthanks for your critics!\r\n\r\ngreetings,\r\nnau"

    doesn''t read well. I''d go with one of the ones where you spell out ''it'' completely. '

  body: The y looks a little tall compared to the s and why did you make it a stencil
    and not make a stencil from the other characters. Also the bottom of the y looks
    a bit long. Good start

  body: "I like the face too. You might consider an uppercase \"I\" (with crossbars)
    to ensure its read as \"sys I.T.\" and not \"sys it\"\r\n\r\nI think th emark
    in #5 speaks the most about the order out of chaos concept."

  body: "like the face.  though dan is right about the y. and perhaps it doesn't need
    to be a stencil?\r\n\r\nI think #6 is working best for me.  though I am not sure
    about the two I's.  Perhaps just one and make it a logotype only, no mark?\r\n\r\nmarks
    are hard for IT companies.  They've been played out.  I think perhaps just a logotype
    with some kind of stylized dash between the sys and the IT would look quite nice.\r\nperhaps
    the dash in some way hints at order from chaos...\r\n\r\n"
