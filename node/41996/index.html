  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi everyone, I&rsquo;m new here so please be gentle.</p>
<p>I had a bit of a conundrum regarding a project I am working on. The project itself is the Out &amp; About Phonebook, which is a free phone directory of gay owned and gay friendly businesses throughout the U.S. I was in charge of a drastic re-brand for the book, and when designing the identity I wanted to use a font that was not going to be widely recognizable. I ended up falling in love with Absara Sans for it&rsquo;s unique ampersand (<a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fontfont/ff_absara_sans_ot_medium/">http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fontfont/ff_absara_sans_ot_medium/</a>) and set the logotype in it. The problem being that my company only had the budget for one weight of the font, in this case medium.</p>
<p>Here is my question: would it be wise to use Absara in the layout of the book (for headings and such), knowing I only have access to this one weight (and conversely is it a mistake to not use the font if it makes up the logotype)? Also, if using Absara is a good route to take, what more widely available fonts with larger families would work well with this font? So far I have tried pairing Absara with various serifs including Berkeley, Garamond, and ITC Cheltenham. Any advice would help me out a bunch. Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>EDIT: Here&rsquo;s a copy of the logo for reference if it will help. Another note, the subtext is set in Futura light, and while still part of the logo I can probably swap out the font of that part without too much hassle from the higher-ups.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@ jupiterboy: The pages will all be pretty text heavy and is more than likely going to be printed on newsprint</p>
<p>@ James Puckett: The latter. I would definitely not set the entire book in it. My question is really in regards to whether or not I should use the font I composed the logotype from in the design of the layout.</p>
<p>@ aluminum: We actually do have a web based directory. You can check it out here (<a href="http://www.myoutandabout.com">www.myoutandabout.com</a>). Unfortunately it was created from a template and uses the old design (blech!)</p>

<p>Not really, but you can still make a potful of money publishing them. Advertisers haven&rsquo;t learned that the value those ads had 20 years ago is not there today.</p>
