body: "Hey, I just compiled a list of all the JavaScript commands to apply/remove
  OpenType features in InDesign through scripting. They should work in both CS2 &
  CS3, except the ones marked as 'CS3 only'.\r\n\r\n<code><strong>myObject</strong></code>
  can be anything that accepts the properties, from a whole Story to a single Character.
  So, if you want to apply the properties to the first story in the document, you'll
  need to declare 'myObject' as:\r\n<code>var myObject = app.documents[0].stories[0];</code>\r\n\r\nIf
  you only want to change the first line of text in a document, 'myObject' should
  be declared like:\r\n<code>var myObject = app.documents[0].stories[0].lines[0];</code>\r\n\r\nAnd
  if what you want to change is the first character in a document, 'myObject' should
  be:\r\n<code>var myObject = app.documents[0].stories[0].characters[0];</code>\r\n\r\nThe
  properties can also be applied to paragraphs, text frames, words, etc.\r\n\r\nHappy

    other list just for the sake of completeness.

  body: "Yes, you can use any OpenType feature and InDesign will apply them blindly.
    However, you can have trouble if you apply a feature (example 'swsh') that InDesign
    has an alternate way of applying -- in this case, InDesign may turn it off.  Both
    GPOS & GSUB features should work. Of course, any 1:many glyph substitutions will
    still fail. \r\nAlso, you can create character or paragraph styles and modify
    them via scripting to add features using the code above -- a style is another
    \"text target\" for these commands. Or, you can apply the feature to text and
    it the \"new style\" button which will load these attributes into the style, even
    though the UI doesn't support them.  \r\nWARNING: this is a way to confuse less
    savvy users who may get the documents later..."

  body: "There was an older mechanism that was replaced by the syntax above in CS2.
    I think the older one was \"OpenTypeFeatures\" (not sure how the capitalization
    is done between the different scripting systems). It specified 2 integers instead
    of a string & an integer, so it would be harder to use.\r\nNew\r\n<code>myObject.opentypeFeatures
