  body: I love Lagarto, too. I purchased a license for it from Gabriel Martinez Meave
    a few years ago, so it was definitely available then. I would send him another
    e-mail. Perhaps he's just busy with ATypI stuff right now.

  body: "Their website shows that you should be able to buy Kimera Type fonts from
    FontShop, but perhaps it is not the US FontShop (it only has his Arcana Script).
    I wonder if Stephen Coles is around to shed some light on this?\r\n\r\n- Mike

    is 'Available Soon' in really small print. The only way to order would be by contacting
    Kimera directly."
