  is not abble to suggest anything even close.\r\nI have the feeling it's a mix between
  several fonts.\r\nThe capital \"T\" looks like an \"F\" without the \"-\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAny
  idea welcome.\r\nThank you for your help."

  body: The capitals look like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/roundhand/bold/">Roundhand
    bold BT</a>, and the lowercase letters look like Times New Roman bold italic,
    all mechanically condensed.
