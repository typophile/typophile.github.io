body: "Hi everyone! Apologies if this is the wrong forum for this question. I do a
  lot of custom invitations in my free time and I'm just starting my own wedding invitations,
  which have to be my masterpiece. I can already hear my design friends critiquing
  them! I'm inspired by the typography in these examples, from Mr. Boddington's Studio,
  but they're custom, and too rich for my budget. Does anyone know of something as
  unique and special as these? Or if anyone is interested I'd love to talk about possibly
  commissioning the type from one of you. \r\n\r\nThanks x10!\r\nSarah"

    are always nice for wedding invitations, and most of them have contextual alternates
    so they almost look like custom calligraphy.\r\n\r\nYour first sample reminds
    me of <a href=\"http://www.hubertjocham.de/item.php/type/display/Mommie/\" target=\"_blank\">Mommie</a>
    from Hubert Jocham.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    through Sudtipos, I'm feeling Kewl Script, very very nice. Also Feel, which I've
    always liked. Thanks for the links!"
