  body: "ITC Avant Garde Gothic Demi + a circle (avant garde has a square) + ITC Avant
    Garde Gothic Book\r\n\r\nThe terminals on the \"c\" are sliced.\r\nThey could
    also have used a period from Futura (or Avenir).\r\n\r\nYou could reproduce it
    using <em>Futura Heavy</em> and <em>Futura Light</em>, but you would need to slice
    off the descender on the \"y\" and the ascender on the \"d\" (even with the cap
    height of the \"l\"). Also you would need to use an \"o\" character and slice
    it accordingly as the \"c\" in <em>Futura Light</em> doesn't have terminal angles
    that match.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lynda_6389.com.jpg]\r\n\r\n***Update***\r\nAfter
    downloading a pdf from their site and looking at the fonts, they use Avenir for
    their regular copy. Since \"lynda\" is obviously not <em>completely</em> Avenir
    based on the letterforms, it looks like the \".com\" however could have been made
    with <em>Avenir Book</em> without alteration. They likely used <em>Futura Heavy</em>
    as the basis for \"lynda\" because of the trough in the \"y\" character, although
    using Avenir Black for the consonants and Futura Heavy for the vowels (chopping
    the \"y\" descender with the difference in length between the x-height and the
    ascender on the \"d\") would be yet another way to make it work."

    need to look further.
