    A while ago I had an Eizo 21\" TFT in the classic format 4:3. As far as I remember
    the 24\"-widescreen TFT are just a bit wider, but the height (in pixel) is the
    same. I remember, that I send my first Eizo 19\" TFT back, becauses I felt totally
    blended and I could not imagine, that I had to regulate the backlight down to
    20% or less. But meanwhile I know, that I have to do that. And then the screen
    cannot be big enough. And there is no duty to use the whole screen. If you edit
    outlines in FontLab a big screen is an advantage. And in case of the creative
    suite with all the docking panels (I think, the last Photoshop, that I liked on
    small screens was version 7), the screen likewise cannot be big enough.\r\n\r\nPersonally
    I hate the widescreen format (I don\u2019t watch movies on the TFT [except from
    porn videos {from the seventies, when women were unshaved, as they should be}]),
    but there are no new TFT in the classic format.\r\n\r\nI am still using Windows
    XP. 102 dpi is too much there. The resolution of the 21\" Eizo was optimal for
    me. But on Windows Vista and Windows 7 you can better change text sizes. So I
    don\u2019t know, what I will buy, when I turn to Windows 7 this year. When I primary
    worked with bitmap imagines the low relative resolution was an advantage, because
    it is a bit easier to work pixel-exactly (especially with regard to the positioning
    of helping lines and lineals) without zooming."

  body: "Follow-up: I ended up getting an LG w2253v, which is also 21.5\" 1920x1080.
    I really enjoy the 102 dpi compared with my previous 89dpi monitor. \r\n\r\nThe
    real benefit is the lower eyestrain. The monitor has a light sensor and automatically
    adjusts brightness to ambient light. Evening and daytime end being two very different
    levels, and although it seemed dim at first, I have noticed that my eyes do not
    get tired so quickly. The setting can also be turned off. "

  body: I just got a 27" iMac, and for the first couple days it did almost feel too
    big, but once you start working two page spreads in Indesign, and especially in
    Final Cut and Motion, you get used to it real quick. My old 22" CRT seems so small
    and dingy now.

    The ViewSonic still works great but started going dim about a year ago, which
    should be expected. Now it's my extended desktop monitor. \r\n\r\nI got the samsung
    because I wanted an all-in-one monitor. It's my TV/game and computer monitor all
    wrapped up in one. Setting up color profiles for it was just easy. Highly recommended. "

    24\" on the market. I didn't expected too much from it, but for me then (about
    6 months ago) was the best buy!\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm using it mostly for typo and
    webdesign, for print/photos you need the better one then this.\r\n\r\nIf you need
    monitor for everything except print design or tuning photographies, then this
    ViewSonic class is not for that. It's actually for everything else (web design,
    fonts, surf'n'play...).\r\n\r\nHope I helped."
