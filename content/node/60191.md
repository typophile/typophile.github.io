  body: "<cite>Directing blanket hate at Rotis  \u2026</cite>\r\n\r\nI wouldn\u2019t
    talk about hate here. Its more something like \u2013 B\xE4\xE4\xE4hhhhhhrlckxx.
    \r\nAnd yes, Aicher maked it very easy to feel so  ;-)\r\n(Wished other things
    in life would be that easy)\r\n\r\nFor the half-rounded alteration: this is exactly
    the spirit and approach Otl Aicher himself advocated. He did a Rotis Semi-Sans
    and a Rotis Semi-Serif which are Bastards even worse than our Cincinnati child."

  body: "<em>\"B\xE4\xE4\xE4hhhhhhrlckxx\"</em>\r\n:-)\r\nI don't think it's pretty,
    either. That \"e\" looks like it just ate something that went bad a week ago.
    But: It reads amazingly well when properly typeset \u2013 which seems very hard
    to do, as the optimal effect most often isn't achieved. I've seen it done well
    once (by Aicher himself), which sure convinced me that it has its merits, even
    though it's so often badly used.\r\n\r\n<em>\"Rotis Semi-Sans and a Rotis Semi-Serif
    which are Bastards\"</em>\r\nShouldn't it be time to think out of the boxes classically
    delimited by classification? \r\nI suspect that especially semiserifs are massively
    underrated, and that there is a lot of uncharted territory for successful text
    fonts between the classic serif and sans genres. Essentially declaring that territory
    a \"no man's land\" is convenient, but not very fruitful."

  body: "<cite>\u2026 it has its merits</cite>\r\n\r\nYes it has. I respect the designers
    courage to explore something. But not every interesting outcome of an exploration
    is equally good as a typeface.\r\n\r\n<cite>\u2026 think out of the boxes classically
    delimited by classification</cite>\r\n\r\nI didn\u2019t think along the lines
    of classification but rather about *the nature* of script. Aicher was obviously
    uncomfortable with the *traditional* opposition between Sans and Serif. It was
    HE who reasoned along the limits of classification and thought it would have merits
    to just violate these limits. Now, what did he embark on? He did NOT go back to
    the roots of both to see what new paths can possibly be found from THAT point.
    Instead he took his knife and cut one ear off from the two \u2013 very well. The
    frankensteinish result, if one likes to put it so, is something new, ok. But is
    it something worthy?\r\n\r\n<cite>\u201Cno man\u2019s land\u201D</cite> \u2013

  body: "<em>\"But not every interesting outcome of an exploration is equally good
    as a typeface\"</em>\r\nLike I said before, I personally can't get excited about
    the way Rotis looks &ndash; but I think it works (or at least can work) extremely
    well. Actually, the style I had this \"epiphany\" with was the Semi Sans, which
    I find the most hideous of the bunch, visually speaking. But the fact that it
    <em>works</em> makes me forgive it for being so ugly, and in my book, makes it
    a successful text face.\r\n\r\n<em>\"He did NOT go back to the roots of both to
    see what new paths can possibly be found from THAT point. Instead he took his
    knife and cut one ear off\"</em>\r\nWhat makes you say that? Does he discuss his
    design process somewhere? (I admit I haven't finished reading \"typographie\"
    yet.)\r\nAnd just for the record, of course he didn't just chop off the serifs
    and that was that; I think the way he rebalanced the shapes in each style is pretty
    successful:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rotises_5505.gif]\r\nBut I'm
    curious, are there any fonts that you think actually do that: Go back to the \"roots\"
    and find new paths from there, off the beaten tracks of the \"classic\" genres?
    I'd be curious to learn what kind of results you think such an approach might
    yield \u2013 results relevant for today no less.\r\n\r\nBTW, I wonder if historicism
    (in the sense of basing one's designs on historical precedent and the way things
    developed to where they are today &ndash; your \"roots\") must really be the only
    permissible way to go about finding shapes that work. What's so despicable about
    \"remixing\" existent shapes? About cutting off ears? Are type designers that
    indebted to type history &ndash; more so than to the reader, who just wants/needs
    type that works?"

    but radicalism (\u201Cradix\u201D ;-).\r\nThere are fonts which sometimes get
    referred to as \u201Cincised\u201D. I think this is a far more interesting direction
    for the option \u201Cserif/sans\u201D.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want to be dogmatic
    on this, just wanted to express that Aicher\u2019s thinking is too mechanistic
    for my taste, not only in terms of Rotis.\r\nBut that\u2019s another thread \u2026"
