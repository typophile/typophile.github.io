    can&#39;t think of an exact match, but I&#39;d suggest you to <BR>take a look
    at <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/grotesque-mt/grotesque-mt/testdrive.html?s=STATE%20PUBLISHING&amp;p=48"

    target="_blank"> not exactly</a>. It&#39;s one of the grotesques that  <BR>preceded
    it and on which Helvetica is inspired. It&#39;s not  <BR>Akzidenz-Grotesk for
    sure.
