  The Storm is heavier - too heavy? but gets the quirky uppercase 'r' better. The
  Storm's heaviness does give it perhaps greater legibility. \r\n\r\nStorm and Berthold
  both provide pdf's. The Storms is excellent, by the way. I would be interested in
  anyone's views\r\n\r\nJohn"

  body: Storm's Walbaum is my favorite work from Storm. You see people heavy up faces
    to make them feel more like letterpress, but the work on this face is really lovely
    in the micro details. I have yet to take a job to print using it but I don't think
    you would go wrong.

    body: thanks so much, Jupiterboy, for your quick reply.I will go with the Storm.
      Interestingly, a designer I came across on Will Harris web site used Walbaum
      (I don't know which) for a business card, but Bodoni for the numerals, as they
      come up clearer, and he challenged the viewer to find some disharmony. It looked
      very good, actually

    body: 'I just made a careful study of Walbaums and concluded that I need two of
      them: Storm for a delicate, historically accurate look, much like the Monotype
      version (which is not available with old style figures loaded)...plus Storm
      has bold italic, which Berthold Standard lacks--I hate that! I know the first
      job I use it for will require Bold Italic--how many type famillies are still
      released without one?? And the second Walbaum is from Linotype, heavier and
      more contrasty than Berthold Standard, and cheaper than Berthold Book (I''m
      a freelancer who pays for his type). Two really superb Walbaums, with different
      blacknesses and different personalities. I would like to go for Berthold Standard,
      but the lack of bold italic is really egregious.'

      body: The Berthold is beautiful. I guess the quirkiness of the Storm cut is
        what sold me, plus the discretionary ligatures are hot.

    body: "I am doubly fortified in going with Storm! Thanks, Chris. \r\n\r\nThis
      is a new topic, really, but came to me as an afterthought. There are three faces
      I love, but nobody seems to use them much. They are Weiss, Aldus and Zapf Renaissance.
      The last two are Hermann Zapf, of course, but all three are so great, I wonder
      whether all this is a matter of fashion, or poor PR from the foundries."

    put together versions of this great face.

  body: I chose Storm's Walbaum as a body face for a fashion magazine with trepidation,
    but since have never regretted it. It's a brilliant, idiosyncratic face. Storm
    = genius.
