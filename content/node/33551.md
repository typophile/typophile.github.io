body: A little off topic here probably, but does anyone have any links to real fortune
  cookie fortunes? I'm looking for actual fortunes & no funny rejects or made up fortunes.
  I've found a few interesting ones myself, but if anyone knows any links, please
  post them here. Especially photos of fortunes are appreciated. Thanks in advance!

    crack me up\r\n\r\nhttp://www.rahoi.com/2006/03/may-i-take-your-order/\r\n\r\nI
    do have a few fortunes I've saved over the years. My favorite:\r\nYou will be
    fortunate in everything.\r\n\r\nRunner up (this one is kind of existential):\r\nStrike
    while the iron is.\r\n\r\nOthers I have:\r\nTo age is to ripen into a luscious
    fruit.\r\nA little mystery will leave others scrambling for clues.\r\nThe time
    to settle your mind about relationships is never.\r\nYou have at your command
    the wisdom of the ages.\r\nIf your desires are not extravagant they will be granted.\r\nHappy
    news is on its way to you.\r\nFriends long absent are coming back to you."
