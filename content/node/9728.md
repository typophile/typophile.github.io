body: Artist For Modern Livin &#40;AFML&#41; is a new company that produces glass
  and ceramic tiles, vases, decorative and functional glass and ceramics. Greatest
  influence on the products is mostly Bauhaus school of design. Simple, geometric,
  and affordable for the people. Artists are German and American. Fabrication is done
  in one of the worlds largest glass facilities in China. I had three rules to work
  by. Make logo design reflect aesthetics of Bauhaus era / theory. ALM &#40;no F wanted&#41;
  should be legible. Icon not required, in fact a typographic solution is desired.
  Must be designed to be chemically etched &#40;reversed on glass/ stampable on ceramics.<img

  body: Ole, take all of your designs and make them the smallest they will ever appear.
    This will help you remove the weakest ones as they won&#39;t hold up to the reduction.
    I think at small sizes the grid lines won&#39;t hold up. Just some thoughts
