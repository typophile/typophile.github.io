  the credit given to Giambattista Palatino as the reason for Zapf naming his typeface
  Palatino is most likely wrong. Tracy says that Zapf was most likely refering to
  the city of Palatino, not the calligrapher.\r\n\r\nI'm just wondering if what I
  recall from the book is indeed accurate, and if so, does Tracy's comment hold any
  water?\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: There's only one reference to Palatino I can find in <em>Letters of Credit</em>,
    and it doesn't say anything about the name. Maybe this edition is different, but
    I can't find any references at all to Zapf, either. Are you sure you have the
    right book?

  body: Oh yeah, I remember Tracy talking about it. I have a hardcover edition, one
    of the ones set in phototype Sabon. I'll go through it again and post when I can
    confirm/deny my original post.

  body: "Robert Bringhurst tells it this way: That Zapf's original name for the face
    was <em>Medici</em>, but after consulting with the Stempel Foundry, they eventually
    settled on the name Palatino. (He insinuates that this was for purposes of marketing.)\r\n\r\nBringhurst
    continues that the name merely \xBBalludes\xAB to Palatino the calligrapher, as
    it is not based on any of his designs.\r\n\r\nI don't gather that Palatino is
    a city; rather, it is a hill in Rome."

    master of the sixteenth century in Rome, Giovanbattista Palatino, a contemporary
    of Michelangelo and Claude Garamond. (I hope Palatino may one day forgive me in
    heaven and give me his blessing for using his good name for my typeface).\u201D
    [<em>Alphabet Stories</em> by Hermann Zapf, pp. 22\u201323. (Rochester NY: RIT

    on any calligraphy by Palatino."

    master of the 16th century Giambattista Palatino. I hope he will forgive me once
    a day in heaven and give me his blessing in using his good name. I had no intention

    Emperors lived and it overlooks the Forum Romanum where the plebs lived. I noticed
    two distinct inscriptional styles there, maybe the first instance of branding
    ever. The Forum Romanum has many examples of lettering that we can recognize as
    Trajan, while up on the hill is the other style we can recognize as Palatino."
