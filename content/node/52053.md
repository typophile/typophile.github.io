body: There are some good resources online for finding letter frequency data for English
  and other major languages, including both corpus and dictionary keyword derived
  data. But none of the corpus data I've looked at so far maintains a distinction
  between upper- and lowercase letters. Has anyone seen such data? I want to know
  what the average frequency of individual uppercase letters is.

    such data: take a list of word frequencies, and use a thesaurus (I mean a digital
    one) to eliminate all the entries that are not proper nouns. The first letters
    of the words you're left with coupled with the frequencies of the respective words
    should constitute a decent estimate.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: John, this SHOULD be fairly easy to find out with Unicode encoded text, yeah?
    If you have a corpus, I have a small app developed by typophile Aric Bills that
    should crunch the numbers for you. Let me get in contact with him and see if he
    will let me pass the app along to you, or perhaps he may contact you directly
    as he did me.

  body: I don't have a corpus, Paul, but could probably find one. For my purposes,
    a corpus of scholarly works in English would be best. In case you're wondering
    why I'm after this, I'm trying to quantify the amount of space saved by using
    one typeface instead of another; since the capitals in the new type are quite
    a lot narrower than in the old one, they may have a significant impact.

  body: "There's more than one way to skin this cat. A lot of it I think\r\ndepends
    on what the client <em>wants</em> to see in terms of analysis.\r\n\r\nFor one
    thing, this is all deterministic; there can be no strict quantification in any
    case. Letter frequencies are always estimates, in some ways better but in other
    ways worse than simply setting a longish typical text supplied by the client to
    get an actual reading of comparative economy.\r\n\r\nWhat you might do instead
    is simply figure out what proportion of text is caps (I've heard it's ~5%*), calculate
    the average set width of each font's caps, and use those three numbers to arrive
    at the economic difference. A refinement of this would be to weight the averaging
    based on general (non-cap) letter frequencies; a further refinement would be to
    use frequencies of initial letters of words only (whereby for example \"Y\" would
    have a very low weight).\r\n\r\n* 15% for German?\r\n\r\nAnother twist is that
    letter frequencies are not enough when it comes to figuring out the effect of
    letter widths on economy. The proportion of paragraph breaks is just as important
    if not more so. A font that saves a certain degree of horizontal space can have
    all its savings trashed by a paragraph break! The greater the proportion of paragraph
    breaks, the more moot narrowness of glyphs becomes.\r\n\r\nAll this makes me think
    that using a sample text from the client to compare the fonts would make more
    sense than relying on frequency stats. But frankly in any case I think the savings
    will be so small (except maybe for German) that the awkwardness of very narrow
    caps will kill it.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    that too. The frequency stats provide a generic baseline comparison between different
    typefaces, but real documents provide a better indication of actual benefits/costs."
