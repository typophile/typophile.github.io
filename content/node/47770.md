body: Hey everyone, hope this belongs here and not in the Type ID section. My question
  is about [[http://www.urbanfonts.com/fonts/Alfredo_Heavy_Hollow.htm|this font]].
  It shows up as Alfredo Heavy on some sites and Alexuss Heavy on others. Can anyone
  tell me what the correct name is? Is one of those a knockoff of the other, or are
  they both knockoffs of a font called something else? Thanks very much for any help
  you can give me.

    I gather was derived from Cooper Black. (I've just watched a \"Behind the Typeface\"
    mockumentary on Cooper Black. Didn't realize how ubiquitous it is.)\r\n\r\nThanks
    very much for your help!"

  body: "Clarification: Goudy Heavyface was not derived from Cooper Black. \"Derived\"
    implies that the shapes of one design were used directly in the genesis of the
    other, which was not the case with Goudy Heavyface. \r\n\r\nHowever, Goudy Heavyface
    was designed in direct response to the popularity of Cooper Black and was meant
    to provide competition in the same style, thus the similarity in feeling. Cooper
    Black ca.1922; Goudy Heavyface ca.1925."

  body: Thanks, kentlew. An important distinction. And I guess Cooper had been Goudy's
    student? It's been interesting for me to learn a bit of the history.
