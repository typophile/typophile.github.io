body: hellooo everybody! a friend told me that today we will all die so i want to
  ask a quick question before all the smart people are gone. lately i have been going
  to many exhibitions and design events and one thing which has caught my attention
  is that i see a trend among independent hipster publications and designers who mostly
  use fonts such as sabon, courier and custom made ugly future like sans serif fonts
  in their magazines and works. so i want to know why is this. have this people been
  reincarnated from the last century . thank you and happy christams!!!!!!

    intriguing talk on YouTube by founder Dave Eggers and was particularly amused
    by his comments with regards to fonts, or perhaps I should say \"font\" as initially
    he could or would only use one, Garamond 3. This was by his admission the result
    of not being able to fully grasp the font management software on his computer,
    which, as he was using Quark 4.1 in Mac OS 9 is hardly surprising : )\r\n\r\nThe
    video is a recording of The Art of the Book: Behind the Covers with Dave Eggers,
    Chip Kidd, Milton Glaser and moderator Michael Bierut at the 92nd Street Y in
    New York, December 4, 2006 and can be found here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpVQRKyD_yM\r\n\r\nMerry
    Christmas/Apocalypse or whatever greeting works for your preferred religious iconography

    want what they don't have. Once good design saturates a culture it's inevitable
    for artistes posing as designers, who merely want to be trendy -as opposed to
    useful to society- to bring it down. And the peon masses will follow.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>before

    - not that, like any trend, it doesn\u2019t contain vast swathes of mediocrity,
    but there\u2019s beauty in a distressed Gill advert too, even if Instagram has
    made it look otherwise. All depends on what\u2019s behind it I\u2019d say - something
    designers can easily lose sight of, at least the gentrified fools I occasionally
    have a fashionable coffee with.\r\n\r\nBut Happy Apocalypse to ya. That\u2019s
    the main thing."

  body: "Depends by what standards you measure it, or from where. Hideous it certainly
    was in many many ways. But, for example, artistically, in Europe, it was a hundred
    times superior to the grim rationality of the preceding century. Socially it was,
    for pretty much anywhere in the world undiscovered by the nightmare white man,
    better than the century which followed. It even produced one or two decent fonts,
    if I\u2019m not mistaken.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT! Ooops. My mistake. \u2018Last century\u2019
    means Twentieth these days dunnit? Keep forgetting. Well, my first sentence still
    holds true. Much marvellousness came from the Century of Horror too, as from any
    darkness."
