  and picture-books like the \"Type in Motion\" publication. Maybe more a theoretical
  and historical work about the relations and correlations of different disciplines
  like typography, film, animation and programming. Not just the viewpoint of filmmakers,
  animators, post-productioners - more a typographic insight. Things like timebased
  typography, but not ust animated letters also code as typography and typography
  as code. I am thinking about the Intro from the Film \"The Matrix\", the Alex Copher
  Video \"The Child\", the font \"Beowolf\", the work of \"Saul Bass\" etc. Thanks
  a lot, Michael"

    anyone have a link to that cool online type clock? I've seen a few of them in
    the past (I know, I'm waaay off base now!)"

    body: "Hi. Sorry to be dredging up an old thread, but I am new to the forums,
      so I am catching up.\r\n\r\nI did my MFA thesis on type in motion with a slight
      bent towards time-based typography in cinema and broadcasting (although it did
      cover some cases of good web/flash based type in motion). You are right though,
      there are not many good books on the subject. Here is all I was able to find
      during my research...\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li> Type in Motion, Jeff Belantoni & Matt
      Wollman\r\n<li> Type in Motion 2, Matt Woolman\r\n<li> Moving Type - Designing
      for Time and Space, Matt Wollman & Jeff Bellantoni\r\n<li> Motion Design, Matt
      Wollman\r\n<li> Type & Typography, Phil Baines & Andrew Haslam (only one chapter
      near the back)\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nAlso, there is this book which is likely much
      more along the lines that you talk about, but it has been listed as \"coming
      soon\" on Amazon since I started working on my thesis back in late 2004. So,
      who knows when/if it will be released.\r\n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321316258/qid=1106005547/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_bn1_xgl14/002-8900632-4354409?n=507846&s=books&v=glance\"
      target=\"_blank\">Typography for Film and Video (Absolute Beginner's Guide)</a>
      \r\n\r\nYou mentioned the first book in the list above and the second isn't
      that much more substantial (I didn't think the first one was good enough to
      warrant a second quite frankly). The third and fourth books are practically
      the same content just slightly rewritten. These are the two gems of the list
      and actually have decent substance.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you are really bored and
      want a good chuckle, my thesis is online here:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.art.uiuc.edu/grads/handbook/theses/TypeInMotionOPT.pdf\"
      target=\"_blank\">Type In Motion</a>. You have to ignore the first section on
      history. It is somewhat inacurate and full of holes\u2014it was a last minute
      addition I didn't research adequately and should have left out. About the only
      potentially useful bit in the whole thing is the morphology (a methodological
      device first introduced by Kenneth Hiebert for those who know that name) toward
      the end. I have found it to be a useful methodological tool for critiquing,
      discussing, and designing moving type. Take it or leave it though....\r\n\r\nAnyhow,
      this post is already long in the tooth. However, I will be going to TypeCon
      in Boston and am really looking forward to the Type Film Fest.  Anyone else
      going who is interested in chatting about Type in Motion / Kinetic type drop
      me a line and lets grab a brew or few while we are there!"
