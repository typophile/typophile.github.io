  perfectly white capital \"I\"s, with gorgeously subtle serifs.  Each of them unique
  and yet they go together.  \r\n\r\nI was playing hockey this morning - and every
  single cut in the ice felt like lettermaking, lots of \"c\"s and \"o\"s and \"u\"s.\r\n\r\nThe
  branches in the park nearby have delightfully light \"fs\" with sharply invividualized
  flags, and \"ts\" with the wispiest of crossbars.\r\n\r\nAnd so on....\r\n\r\nIs
  this a normal reaction to visiting this site and spending time with books on typeface/typography?
  \ \r\n\r\nAnyone else experience this?\r\n\r\nI wonder if the alphabet came from
  observing nature?  I remember Robert Graves claiming that the letter \"v\" came
  from watching geese. :-)"

    at. It is perfectly normal. Okay, I don't really know if it is really \"normal\",
    but it happens. The shapes of the letters are very powerful, and the most ungainly
    are no accident. When you've got them on your brain, their ghosts appear everywhere.\r\n\r\nThe
    rest of the time, I think people seem to get sucked into consiously IDing and
    analyzing the typeface choices of others around them. I was flipping through some
    CDs, and thinking, \"Why don't the labels use more hand lettering?\"\r\n\r\n<A
