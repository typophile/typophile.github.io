    \"Even\r\nif text is given to you by a client, check it.\", that it is not advisable
    to correct text that is given to you, unless you are asked to do so. You can point
    out errors to the writer, but do not correct it yourself. Some 'errors' in the
    text might be on purpose, so if you correct it you could ruin the text. Only correct
    with permission. At least, that is what I have (learned) as a rule.\r\n\r\nAlso
    the bit called <em>28. Indents</em>, I think this is to be decided by the typographer/typesetter,
    only if he/she thinks indents are appropriate for the particular text he/she is
    working on. It's not a rule, because it is not always necessary."

    when old-style figures might be appropriate.\r\n\r\n8: I assume you'll explain
    the proper use of bold weight.\r\n\r\n29: The jury is out on this one, but you'll
    find far more grammar and usage experts who disagree with you.  Including the
    last comma adds consistency; omitting it often creates ambiguity (it leaves the
    reader confused about whether the final two elements of the series have a special
    relationship above and beyond their inclusion in the series).\r\n\r\nOtherwise,
    very nice."

    years, where AP style says omit that last comma. Even then, though, I recognized
    that clarity may call for you to use it (no style rules should be absolute; they
    should be used as guidelines to enhance clarity).\r\n\r\nThis may reflect my time
    with the newspaper, but regarding rule No. 3: I understand that only periods and
    commas go within quotation marks. Other punctuation, such as semi-colons, still
    sit outside the marks. I'd be interested to hear of another style guide that says
    differently (I always found that rule awkward).\r\n\r\nFinally: I'm not sure how
    you mean that an en dash is used to denote a duration of time. That may very well
    be true, but I'd need an example to know just what you mean.\r\n\r\nLindsay"

    guide to good typography. That takes a book, like Bringhurst, Felici, etc. \r\n\r\nCases
    in point: \r\n\r\n\"Rule 12. Increase line spacing to improve readability in text.\"
    \r\n\r\nToo much leading is also a problem. \r\n\r\n\"Rule 19. Ideal Column width.\"
    \r\n\r\nYour recommendation on ideal single column width of 4 1/2 inches is just
    wrong. Both Bringhurst and Felici both recommend about 2 1/2 lower case alphabets
    for ideal measure in a single column. The physical length will be affected by
    the typeface chosen. Also it will vary with leading, etc. \r\n\r\nA good relationship
    between font, measure, leading, number of lines, and margins is a complex subject,
    and central to good typography. The books devote a lot of pages to it, with illustrations.
    \r\n\r\nAlso the writing here is too loose and informal for a guide. "

    I would loose \"true\" in \"true quotation marks\". While there are fake small
    caps and true small caps, I don't think there are any fake quotes. There are simply
    quote marks and feet and inch (prime) marks.\r\n\r\n9., 10., 28. I think uppercase
    \"not\" is over the top. Rule 24 works effectively with a bold word, perhaps these
    three would too. Perhaps emphasis with italics would be even better?\r\n\r\n13.
    I am not sure how other people feel about this but Airal, Helvetica, Meta are
    all huge at 9pt. I'd say 7pt is a more appropriate lower figure. And I'm not talking
    about special cases (like faces not likely to be used for extended text, or special
    cases like children's books). I am talking about mainstream type.\r\n\r\n17. I
    believe the period after \"caps\" should be a comma.\r\n\r\n19. I don't feel this
    rule is necessary at all. You can never get it right with absolute measures like
    inches anyway. To me this falls under 16 where you do talk in character count
    unit (some people express it in ems too). \r\n\r\n24. \"spell=check\"?\r\n\r\n26.
    \"Whine\"?\r\n\r\n28. Quoting em again seems unnecessary. I don't think an em
    can be equated with 3 spaces. I would simply loose spaces reference altogether.
    I would also advise students against using tabs. Indents option in the software
    is the only way to go, imho.\r\n\r\n29. Just omit...\r\n\r\n\r\nHope that's constructive."
