  for dlig's goes like this:\r\n<code>\r\nsub A A by A_A;\r\nsub K A by K_A;\r\nsub
  R A by R_A;\r\n</code>\r\nI understand why K_A gets priority over A_A, but why A_A
  gets priority over R_A? \r\nOr vice-versa."

    arcane ways (see the comments on ligatures at http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/topic_feature_file_syntax.html#4.e).\r\n\r\nIf
    you want complete control over how your ligatures are prioritized, you should
    include explicit lookup declarations in your code. For example, if you want your
    RA ligature to take priority over other ligatures, include the following:\r\n\r\nfeature
    dlig {\r\n\r\nlookup HighestPriority { # This lookup will be applied to the text
    run first.\r\nsub R A by R_A;\r\n} HighestPriority;\r\n\r\nlookup LowerPriority
    { # These substitutions will be applied after R_A substitutions.\r\nsub A A by
    A_A;\r\nsub K A by K_A;\r\n} LowerPriority;\r\n\r\n} dlig;"
