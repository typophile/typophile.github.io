  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi all,

I'm a newbie here and i'm french... so excuse my bad english :S 
I look this site for a few weeks and I see much talent here. I would need your assistance for a tattooing in symbiotogram.  I know that for you, expert of the letters, that will be like a challenge to take up and I hope for it amusing. 
Then... the name "Karine" must become to 180 degrees the name "François"...
I send a sketch of an idea.. but I'm not ready to make a tattoo whit... this. 

Thank you very much for your help... everything will be appreciate. 

K

		<div class="commentbody">Rather than start on the computer you should really get out a pencil and paper. Think about the many different variations of style that the letterforms can take. Look at other lettering artists and ambigram artists to see how they do things. In the end you may have to pay someone to do this if it's really what you want. What you have right now is rather 'mish-mashy', keep trying...don't be content until it's perfect.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">John's book doesn't really tell much more than what he gives here on this part of his webpage: http://johnlangdon.net/ambigrams.html In the book he dives a bit further into his process, but again it's an artform and you can't really spell it out. It's easiest to experiment over and over and over until you find something that works, learning what corners you can cut so letters are still recognizable.

On the other hand...go buy his book. John is an amazing artist, wonderful professor and basically my mentor at school/inspiration for love of type. You'll enjoy it even if you don't end up with a finish of this project!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think your basic approach is sound and some of the letter combinations are working well, as you say patience and perserverance are going to be required, you could look at <a href="http://typophile.com/node/1516?from=0&comments_per_page=50">this thread</a> for some ideas. The approach I take is to draw the letters from one direction, turn the page and amend to work the letters from another direction, trace it and start the process again, whether I am working on paper or direct on the computer. Combining letters or using swashes to create a letter* from the opposite direction can be productive, especially when you have different number of characters in the two words.

Keep at it,
Tim

		<div class="commentbody">I worked a little on that... I send you an example of that I tested. I've some problem whit the E... or rather with the Fr of François, not the same style and not enought precision, but I think it's a beginning. I'm not yet enought familiar whit that to make swashes or ornements, but I still practice !

		<div class="commentbody">I think you're onto something with your 'k' becoming an 'is'. Just needs a little straightening out to make it work with the other characters.

I think you could eliminate the stroke leading into the a in Francois and bend the bowl of the a back to the right a bit to make the a more obviously an a without compromising the n. I believe the o in Francois could also get rounder as long as you keep that incoming stroke that makes it an a. Finally, the F might read better both as F and E if the top horizontal was not detached from the stem.

It's very cool to see sketches in progress - save these when you've arrived at a result, they're great. And don't give up hope, you're almost there.</div>

I think your final solution will incorporate the new 'K/is', the old 'ari/nco', and some way of packing 'ra' into 'n'.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree with cerulean that the "r" is getting a bit lost. I know that it is difficult to work around but the flourish at the end of Karin is a bit confusing. I know that you need it for Francois. I recently designed a tattoo for myself using my two daughters names. It is a bit different because the names are stacked. Each name is an ambigram, so you read it one way it says Kendall/Kylie. The other way it says Kylie Kendall. Just another way to think about it. Good Luck!
