  far) to identify. I have run through MyFonts and Dafont 'Techno' showings with no
  luck, and checked the FontBook and Indie Fonts books, just so you know where I've
  looked.\r\n\r\nAnyone recognize this?\r\n\r\nThanks, \r\n- Mike"

    Here is the image I made from  it that I intended to post. It suffered from being
    converted from a rotated screen shot -- the strokes should look smooth.\r\n(Too
    bad we can't edit our post when it starts the thread.)\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Windustrial_3489.gif]"
