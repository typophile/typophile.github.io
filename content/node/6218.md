  I don&#39;t know how  <BR>American people will judge the design which is a protest
  &#40;as well as the  <BR>font name&#41; against the horror, the terror and the human
  cruelty. Typeface will be on sale on November 11th at my Website  <BR>&#40;<A HREF="http://www.germaris.com"

    it. <BR> <BR>At risk of sounding nitpicky, should this perhaps have been posted
    to the Display forum, rather than the Bitmap/Screen forum? <BR> <BR>That technicality
    aside, I really like what you have done with this rather illustrative font. Some
    of the bending, twisting and skewing decisions really add to the overall evocative
    feel. <BR> <BR>I also think you&#39;re on more or less the right track regarding
    your handling of the descending lc characters. <BR> <BR>I especially like the
    upper case. <BR> <BR>David '

    a very perticular apperence and idea. Like Hrant said to distribut to America
    I think that the rest of the world would like to use to express better the day
    of 11 of september and reallity of WAR. I like very must of the capitals than
    lowercase letters because the structure of the letters are more irregular and
    show better the felling of the catastrophe. The lowercase fell&#39;s me that have
    a repetive and regular apperence &#40; tratemant &#41;. Gerald good work and good
    luck to distribute this honest typography to every one. '

  body: ' Hello Jared! <BR> <BR>Me too I am as dubious as you are. I don&#39;t know
    why your opinion and your comments &#34;wake the Devil in me&#34;! <BR>Since the
    first time I saw the rubble at Ground Zero I got the idea to make a type with
    these tortured structures. A few days later, it was announced that a part of the
    structures will be preserved to make a memorial at WTC site. This is what decided
    me to start working on this design. Life isn&#39;t a garden of roses and artists
    &#40;which I think I am not!&#41; have to react their way to catastrophes or tragic
    events or to beautiful and nobles actions as well. &#34;Infamy&#34; is my way
    to react. I am not as famous and as smart as Picasso &#40;I suppose you know that!!!&#41;
    but remember Guernica. Do you think this masterpiece is somewhat &#34;morbid&#34;?
    I don&#39;t think it is. It is a angry shout against horror and human cruelty.
    <BR>I decided to make a typeface &#40;which is conceived to be a long lasting
    object&#41; because of the iconic nature of the rubble. And also because I am
    not convinced your fellow citizens really want to sooth their wounds when I watch
    24/7 CNN Breaking News or when I listen to interviews of ordinary people or politicians
    &#40;of both sides&#41; or when I read Time magazine or The New York Times or
    the Enquirer &#40;sic!&#41;. I am not convinced too when I heard about the WTC
    Memorial which will integrate wreckage of the Twin Towers &#40;with a &#34;cross&#34;
    made from the structure!!!, just enough to start a religious war!!!&#41;.  <BR>
    <BR>I am sure that people will use this font in the future for titles which need
    to refer to a symbol of human cruelty. And if they won&#39;t, it will be too bad
    for me. <BR> <BR>Anyway, thank you for revealing your position in such a polite
    way. And I can say that I completely share your opinion about the September 11
    font. I already knew this font and you know what? I found it much more morbid
    than mine and particularly the sample you posted! Just because it shows the action
    instead of showing the horrible result. Some design my peers made show a complete
    lack of decency. <BR> <BR>Warmest regards '

  body: ' Wow... What an interesting thread this is shaping up to be. <BR> <BR>I completely
    agree with what has been said about both the September 11 font and this one. They
    are evocative of very unsettling reactions. <BR> <BR>Perhaps where we differ is
    that I see this uncomfortable reaction as an eminently good thing; indeed, I believe
    that reaction to be exactly the point of both of these fonts. <BR> <BR>The events
    of September 11 were, without question, some of the most abhorrent, tragic, morbid
    and heart-rending events I have witnessed in my lifetime. In fact, the day could
    easily be argued to have been the most significant world event in my lifetime.
    <BR> <BR>As such, while it is certainly necessary to heal from the pain the events
    inflicted, it is also necessary to recognize the significance of the scars they
    have left behind. <BR> <BR>Like the Nazi Holocaust, Jonestown, and countless other
    tragedies, little service is paid to their memories by finding only comfortable
    ways to remember them. Indeed, no service is done to their memory by allowing
    ourselves to forget or gloss over the pain they have caused. Of course there is
    a fine line between morbidity and boldly/proudly displaying the scars of our experience;
    but I do not think that efforts such as these two designs even approach such a
    line, and I hold that opinion completely apart from the fact that proceeds from
    the sale of the fonts will be donated to charities dealing with the disaster.
    It should be remembered that if it hadn&#39;t been for the horrific images seen
    on the broadcast and print news, those of us who weren&#39;t there to experience
    it firsthand really wouldn&#39;t have had the same sense of the depth and scope
    of what really happened. <BR> <BR>Is it uncomfortable to be reminded of the images
    of the occupied planes slicing into inhabited buildings, or the images of terrified
    people jumping hopelessly from windows a hundred floors off the ground, or the
    images of those still-occupied buildings crumpling into twisted, grinding, smouldering
    piles of debris? <BR> <BR>It is excruciating. And it should be. <BR> <BR>Art,
    including in this sense typographic design, should be provocative &#40;or evocative&#41;
    when it wishes to be, and I believe that both of these fonts have achieved that
    goal, among others, in their own ways; &#34;Infamy,&#34; as an evocative functional
    display font, and &#34;September 11,&#34; as &#40;at least&#41; an evocative exercise
    in typographic expression. <BR> <BR>Responses are welcomed and encouraged, as
    always. <BR> <BR>David '

  body: ' High five. <BR> <BR>I like the more recent version. I&#39;m not sure that
    a type-face is the right way to express whatever needs to be expressed, but the
    second version, with the tattered characters, is definitely more expressive. I
    would tear it apart a lot more. the shapes of the trade towers columns are compelling,
    but the shapes of the letters are so clean and nice, it doesn&#39;t work. It feels
    wrong. If I were to use this face it would be silk-screened, or rubber stamped
    then torn to peices. The ultra-clean, CNN looking gradient doesn&#39;t help much
    either. <BR> <BR>There is nothing wrong with a morbid subject-- but say something
    about it. Being cute or clever won&#39;t cut it here. '

    the whole world has experienced. i myself contributed to the Sept. 11 fontaid
    2 font. &#40;UC &#34;S&#34;&#41;. from the time i woke up in my home in California
    to watch the second plane hit the tower,till right know, i have felt that making
    the glyph&#39;s for font aid was something &#40;as a type designer&#41; i could
    do for my country. and for the others glyph&#39;s in font aid, it was how the
    world of type designers delt with there feelings. i also submitted an &#34;H&#34;
    the looked like the WTC.&#40;the only released the ? font&#41; <BR>and as for
    &#34;INFAMY&#34; i think it is GREAT, this is oviously how you are dealing with
    this world tragdey. i like the idea of having a version with the ground and without.
    and someone posted eariler that the lc looks more &#34;controled&#34; than the
    UC. don&#39;t get discourged cause a few people don&#39;t understand the drive
    behind the font. <BR>keep it up and i&#39;ll be looking for it this month!&#40;

    <BR>You can see in the pictures how different they are and what their structures
