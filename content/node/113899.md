  But we are reprinting this book and I need to know what font this is to recreate
  the cover.\r\n\r\nWe couldn't find it for building the website so we used Harrington:
  http://www.haikuwisdom.com/\r\n\r\nBut now we need the font for the second edition
  of the book. The original publisher is unavailable.\r\n\r\nAny help is greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank
  you,\r\nDiana aka Bonesai[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Capture_4468.PNG]"

    few who may be original designers. The problem seems similar to http://typophile.com/node/108416
    where it took some digging to get to a copy of the probable original.\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "Thanks Mike for the lead. This is a big help in clearing the water. So, first
    the original BB&S font:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LiningAngloDetailBBS1907SM_3567.jpg]\r\nThen
    an original digitization. Fivios mentioned an Anglo \"Generated by Fontographer
    4.1.5.\" I found this in my folder of original digitizations by Dan X. Solo of
    metal type fonts that he had purchased during his many years of hunting for metal
    fonts. The digitization is of good quality, not merely an autoscan. This digital
    font was distributed [1998?] by Dan X. Solo in Dover Victorian book + CD pack.
    The legitimate way to acquire it is by purchasing the book.\r\nSo the digital
    font ID could be Dan X. Solo's Anglo.\r\nThere are some other digitizations but
    of poorer quality. I have not checked their provenance, but some might be original
    creative works. Version 2: Angelo 1993 B & P Graphics, Ltd. Can't say if this
    is their original or they lifted it from someone's earlier digitization, perhaps
    Opti.  Version 3: Viata Script, Softkey, 1992 SS & Rankle 1995 Elfring Soft Fonts.
    And more loose ends: Anglophile (Novel), Anglican (WSI).... I have not checked.\r\n
