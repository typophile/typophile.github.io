    using left part of a /Z for the /T, mixing alternate /d with a /d for the /h.\r\nCan't
    be 100% positive for the Gothic but could be [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/rsantos/van-condensed/|Van
    Condensed Bold]] modified (distressed, slanted and inlined). The better way would
    probably to ask directly to the designer [[http://cargocollective.com/RyanjBush#1228240/OLC-WEBSITE-REDESIGN|Ryan
    J. Bush]]. If he tends to answer, please drop some lines about it."

  body: He did! They are Fenway Park [Veer] (modified) and Van Condensed Bold (obviously
    modified) were the fonts used, respectively. Good call.
