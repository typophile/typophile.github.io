  weights using MM based work-flow. But how to make open-type font that would include
  different masters for different pt sizes. As I want to refine 4tp, 5pt, 6pt, 7pt,
  etc. I guess it has to do something with wrapping up multiple fonts and some open-type
  coding, is it so?\r\n\r\nSo, some help on this would be highly appreciated.\r\nLinks
  or key words for searching would do too."

    feature]], but AFAIK it is not supported by any software. If this is true, I don\u2019t
    think it\u2019s a good idea to put all your optical variants into one single file.\r\n\r\nA
    better approach would be to use different fonts named properly, as [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/garamond-premier/|Adobe
    does]]."
