body: "Microworld Sharptype is a filter plug-in for Photoshop, it mainly concerns
  on generating ultra-clear type at small font size in Photoshop or any compatible
  host. Sharptype can provide far sharper type than the built-in Photoshop engine,
  which will improve your compositions' readability dramatically. Sharptype is similar
  to Microsoft Cleartype and Adobe Cooltype, it uses a distinct method to render font,
  and does not use functional routines provided by operating system, and however,
  it optimizes vector information to sharpen the vertical and horizontal lines. Sharptype
  provides 5 rendering methods and 3 enhancing modes, and currently has support of
  Truetype and Opentype fonts. Flexible combination of bold, italic, underlined and
  outlined rendering styles, font preview, can search additional user defined font
  directory other than system default, built-in character map makes the insertion
  for figure fonts easier. Global encoding and native keyboard layout enable us to
  support multiple languages inside one unique version.\r\n\r\nV1.3 (23 May 2005)\r\nNew
  slightly-fitted rendering arithmetic, which can provide better shape than grid-fitted;\r\nNew
  LCD enhancing mode, which can provide clearer type for LCDs and mobile electronic
  manufactures, \r\nit is similar to Microsoft Cleartype and Adobe Cooltype;\r\nAdded
  LCD screen striping control for management of LCD enhancing mode;\r\nFixed some
  bugs.\r\n\r\n"
