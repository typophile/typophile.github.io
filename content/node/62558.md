  has just released our next two families on Myfonts. com.\r\n\r\nGoldbarre is a finely
  engraved slab serif face in the spirit of \u2018between the wars\u2019 commercial
  confidence. It\u2019s a solid and dependable face of distinction for use on certificates
  and posters which need to convey an emphatic yet refined message. The letterforms
  of Goldbarre combine finely hatched shading with and embossed, three-dimensional,
  quality.\r\n\r\nVeneribe -the Venerable face- is an experiment in what many today
  might call \u2018grunge\u2019, though we at Greater Albion would probably prefer
  to talk of rustic (or if we\u2019re feeling really old-fashioned rustick) charm.
  It\u2019s a derivative of our Clementhorpe family, and aims to combine a battered
  antique look with the charm of that decorative Roman family. Regular and oblique
  forms are offered.\r\n\r\nYou can preview these faces in acction on our [[http://gatf.wordpress.com
  | blog]] or try them out for yourself on [[http://new.myfonts.com/foundry/Greater_Albion_Typefounders/
  | Myfonts.com]].\r\n"
