body: "Hey guys,\r\nI was wondering about the vertical positioning of Hyphen, minus
  and N dash. Should all the three be at the same distance from the the base line
  or should the hyphen be higher and the minus and em/en dash be lower? Most of the
  posts talk about the width but not the vertical positioning. Also is figure height
  same as x-height( used here http://www.microsoft.com/typography/developers/fdsspec/maths.aspx
  description of plus sign)"

    Cheng's fantastic book <em>Designing Type</em>]] very helpful. It is always useful
    for things like this to look at what others have done and fonts like Cambria,
    Georgia or Verdana might be good places to start looking.\r\n\r\nWith regard to
    mathematical typography and typesetting I would highly recommend the [[http://www.tiro.com/projects.html|Mathematical
    Typesetting booklet]] edited by Ross Mills and John Hudson and I daresay that
    John may be able to recommend other sources and further reading on the subject
    if he sees this.\r\n\r\nWith regard to your initial question, in my (extremely
    limited) experience they tend to be but others here will no doubt have much more
    informed opinions."

  body: Old style figures are often slightly taller (not counting ascenders) than
    the x-height. Sometimes they follow the small cap height.

  body: "It makes sense to align the hyphen and dashes, and for common text use they
    should normally be slightly above centred on the x-height. In all-caps settings
    they need to be raised to be slightly above the centre of the cap height; this
    is why many OpenType fonts contain 'case' feature variants of the hyphens and
    dashes.\r\n\r\nMathematics is a different beast altogether. There is a central
    horizontal axis running through each line of an equation, normally centred on
    the (lining) numeral height, to which operators are aligned."

  body: and what about the thickness of these dashes(Not width but the height)? Should
    the hyphen be thicker than the en/em/minus ?

    necessarily. In my current project for example these get thinner as they get longer,
    and I know I'm not the only one."

  body: "<em>I would say slightly below.</em>\r\n\r\nWell, if you want the hyphen
    and dashes in all-caps settings to appear below the centre line, you could do
    that, but why would you want to, especially when those caps typically have waist
    features such as the bar of the H and the middle of the B above the centre line?
    Indeed, the easiest and least visually disruptive way to position the hyphen/dash
    height in all caps settings is to align it to the H bar."

  body: "Regarding weight, I usually have the en dash and em dash of the same thickness,
    but the hypen is considerably heavier.\r\n\r\nNow, who here provides kerning for
    \ dashes so that they overlap when typed in sequence? This supports their use
    in bibliographical entries, where a sequence of joined em dashes is conventionally
    used to replace repeated author citations, e.g.\r\n\r\nFurtzwangler, J. <em>Water
    polo my way.</e> Harvard University Press, Cambridge MA. 1982.\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014

    but when I chose to do this with Whitman in 2003, I had never encountered this
    pair in any other fonts that I\u2019d investigated. True, the practice of adding
    sidebearings to the em dash was also not as widespread as it is today.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    John, the typical convention in the sort of bibliographic example you show is
    only a three-em dash \u2014 not eight!"

  body: "When a continuous-line appearance is needed several times in an InDesign
    document, I create a character style for it that has tight kerning. Makes it easy
    to adjust the spacing of all occurrances later, if needed, plus you can temporarily
    make that style a different color so you can immediately see if you've applied
    that style to some text or not. \r\n\r\nAlso works for underlines used to make
    rules on a form (although I normally prefer to create rules by a different method)."
