  body: "> Im looking for some cool fonts.\r\n\r\nIs the readership of this magazine
    primarily looking for \"cool\", irrespective of content? Because otherwise you
    should look deeper than what we might think is cool. Chris has the right idea;
    and then there's the more technical stuff, like article length, paper type, etc...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: You could go the tried and true route of using Amplitude for (almost) everything.
    Christian's own personal coolness just seems to rub off on every magazine that
    uses his type.

  body: Its often not what fonts that are used but how they are used that can make
    a publication fresh (different). A tabloid here is using all caps, condensed and
    bold/black at a huge size that jumps the spread to sensationalize their articles.
    Just some thoughts
