body: "Hi all. It's good to be back.\r\n\r\nI design and typeset a multilingual literary
  journal in 20+ languages. We use Skolar for latin, Greek, Cyrillic, and Devanagari.
  For our other scripts (Hebrew, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Bengali), we have survived
  thus far on a mix of various free fonts, not all of which are a good match for the
  Skolar. As funding is starting to come through for new typefaces, I am improving
  the quality of typesetting one script at a time \u2014 and Hebrew is next on my
  list. I'm looking for a good Hebrew face for running text that has something of
  Skolar's low contrast and contemporary feel. Below are some of the faces on my current
  shortlist. While I like some of them quite a lot, I don't think any of them is quite
  the right match. What else should be on my list?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.hebrewtypography.com/sample-page/%D7%A8%D7%A5-%D7%A8%D7%92%D7%99%D7%9C/\r\nhttps://www.myfonts.com/fonts/masterfont/narkisim/\r\nhttps://www.myfonts.com/fonts/masterfont/tzoba-mf/\r\nhttps://www.myfonts.com/fonts/masterfont/yeadim-mf/\r\nhttps://www.myfonts.com/fonts/masterfont/emuna-mf/\r\nhttps://alefalefalef.co.il/font/synopsis/\r\n\r\nThank
  you,\r\nJosh"
