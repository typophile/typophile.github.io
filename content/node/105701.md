  Tribute for headlines and body on product labels, as well as throughout the brand.
  \r\nNow I need to size down the supporting copy (all choppy fact bites) on the labels
  to 8/9 pt, add more of it, and think it's time to add a sans. \r\n\r\nThoughts for
  what sans might feel good with Tribute and have a straightforward factual style?\r\nThanks
  so much in advance. "

    is very compact humanist sans, with eight weights, so would give you a lot of
    design \uFB02exibility. Its partner <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/sense/\">Sense</a>
    is plainer, but also with the marked overshoot of ascender over cap that would
    harmonize with Tribute.\r\n\r\nMy <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/brown/\">Brown</a>
    is more straightforward and also semi-condensed, and its detailing gives it a
    slightly old school/letterpress quality to match Tribute.\r\n\r\nStorm\u2019s
    <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/sebastian-pro/\">Sebastian</a> has
    classic old style proportions, as do Mr Eaves and Brandon Grotesque with their
    small x-height."
