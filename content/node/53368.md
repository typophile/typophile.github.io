  body: "The first site that comes to mind is Ban Guan Park at Greenleaf Road, which
    I blogged about here and here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.manic.com.sg/blog/archives/000549.php
    Hopefully someone can identify this font (again). I thought it was Caslon 224,
    but no. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.manic.com.sg/blog/archives/000547.php\r\nhttp://www.manic.com.sg/blog/archives/000550.php\r\n\r\nWhile
    you're there, you might wanna grab a bite at <a href=\"http://eatbma.blogspot.com/2005/08/cantina-greenleaf-road.html\">Cantina</a>,
    just because it's quite out of the way. And you might feel silly trekking all
    the way there just to see some type!\r\n\r\nGreenleaf is also near Holland Village,
    which is fairly interesting typographically. Sneak peek here: http://www.manic.com.sg/blog/archives/cat_neighbours.php\r\n\r\nIf
    you want to see older types, you'll wanna go round to the Arab Street area. It'll
    be an interesting area to visit, and I think there are a bunch of old sign boards
    there.\r\n\r\nWhile you're in Singapore, no doubt, you'd want to check out the
    Esplanade, also known as the \"durian\".\r\nAnd while you're in the area, you
    should check this out http://keropokman.blogspot.com/2008/01/our-glorious-dead-cenotaph.html\r\n\r\nNo
    need to make any special effort to see these, you can't miss them. \r\nOur Rotis
    road signs: http://www.manic.com.sg/blog/archives/000194.php\r\n\r\nWell, if you
    have more non-type related questions on where to go, just ask. I'd be happy to
    answer them. \r\nEspecially if they have anything to do with food. :)\r\n\r\nHope
    you enjoy your stay here. When's your trip?"
