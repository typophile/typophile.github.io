  My Fonts' \"What the Font?\" forum, so I thought I'd try here...\r\n\r\nIs this
  a commercially available script font, or something that was drawn by hand and/or
  custom-made?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Malin+Goetz_5023.gif]\r\n\r\nAny
  help will be greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJohn the Fontaholic"

    website</a> (click a few links to see the categories in red). I'm sorry, but I
    don't believe I've ever seen that font before.\r\n\r\nFor future reference, John,
    it's the MyFonts automated WTF utility that has a max of 25 characters. For the
    MyFonts Forum, as here, more is generally better for identification purposes."

  body: I see now that Jan was unable to ID your font on the MyFonts forum - and she
    is the <em> very best</em> at script fonts. I also see that Metro2005 came up
    with the same conclusion I thought likely - that your font is a Barney's exclusive.

    target=\"_blank\">Part 11 of Mike Y's Script ID Guide,</a> using the distinctive
    'y' to try to find this font. The only font with a similar 'y' is Chas HW (which
    is otherwise not a match).\r\n\r\nBased on the source, this is most likely a custom
    job for Barneys. You could try contacting someone at <a href=\"http://www.theingredient.com/\"
    target=\"_blank\">Ingredient</a> as they seem to have designed the site.\r\n\r\n

    to know that if all the font gurus here are stumped, then at least I'm in good
    company!  ;-)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJohn the Fontaholic"
