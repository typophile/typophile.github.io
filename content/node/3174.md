body: In the Best of Business Cards volume 4, there&#39;s a cool looking sample  <BR>for
  a company called OpenThinkInc.com. The web site doesn&#39;t show it  <BR>and I could
  not find a sample online. It looks like Digital Sans Medium  <BR>but I&#39;m really
  not sure. <BR>Thanks <BR>

  body: Sorry, can&#39;t scan it. It caught my attention while browsing at a  <BR>bookstore
    and I didn&#39;t want to buy the book just for that. <BR>I realize that it&#39;s
    not much fun without posting pictures but I  <BR>expected a few people here to
    have access to this book. <BR>They seem fairly popular. <BR>The logo is in the
    first half of the book. I&#39;ll write down the  <BR>page number if I return to
    the store soon enough. <BR>
