body: I need to locate the owners of the license for ITC Highlander.  I&#39;ve had
  it so long i don&#39;t know where i got it from. The programmers of a Print -On-Demand  E-Comm
  site I&#39;m working on is having trouble kerning Price Points utilizing this font
  and the only solution i have is for them to work with the original programmers on
  a custom font for their system. I realize this is a long-shot but i figure it&#39;s
  worth a try. thanx
