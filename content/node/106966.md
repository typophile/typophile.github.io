    of original Tabasco. Another "commercial" version of Tabasco is [[http://paratype.com/pstore/default.asp?fcode=SU_TVR&letter=T|Tavrida]]
    by Paratype. Actually, don't think there's any legal/legitimate digital version
    of it ([[http://typophile.com/node/100230|related discussion]] on the topic).
