  Poetry in the English Language</em>.  It has facsimiles of poems in the handwriting
  of the poet, from John Skelton to Dylan Thomas.  I gaze on it every once in a while,
  half in admiration, half enviously, because the handwriting displayed therein is
  so gorgeous.  The handrwriting isn't beautiful in a calligraphic/formal sort of
  way (at least not usually), but more that it's distinctly individualized while being,
  at the same time, very legible.  \r\n\r\nMy handwriting comes in two varieties:
  \ my \"real\" handwriting, which is absolutely unlegible; or, when I try for legibility
  (my hand moving painfully slow), it has absolutely no distinction, something like
  a second graders tortured cursive. \r\n\r\nSo, I imagine many of you on this forum
  have nice handwriting, or at least might know how to improve it?  Does anyone know
  of any resources I might consult?  Books?  Websites?  Thanks & Cheers!   "
