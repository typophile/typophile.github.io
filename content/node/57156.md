body: Could someone tell me, if he knows the name of this typeface. Looks somehow
  like a black avantgarde but has tiny sharp serifs???[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font_iding_6699.jpg]

  body: "Thanks for your quick reply, but i don't think that it's ITC Serif Gothic.\r\nThe
    N and the A look different (position of serifs and the general proportions of
    the letter).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font_iding2_5105.jpg]\r\n\r\nBut
    maybe its a custom-made font based on the Serif Gothic.\r\n\r\nThanks anyway.\r\n"
