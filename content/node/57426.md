body: "Hello,\r\nI am designing the book about a theater. \r\nThe text I am given
  contains a huge number of quotation marks: \r\n\r\n\u2013 names of plays \r\n\u2013
  role in the play\r\n\u2013 names of artistic groups \r\n\u2013 names of programs\r\n\u2013
  citations \r\n\u2013 \xABironic\xBB meanings or metaphors, \r\n\u2013 foreign language
  words \r\n\r\nI am trying to make all this emphases less obtrusive by changing all
  names of theater plays and foreign language words to Italic. \r\nHow legitimate
  this approach is? \r\n\r\nthank you!\r\n"

    would go like this:\r\n\r\nName of play: italic or underline\r\nRole in play:
    initial-cap or (maybe) small-caps\r\nName of group: title-cap or italic\r\nName
    of program: title-cap or italic\r\nCitations: quotation marks\r\nIrony: quotation
    marks\r\nForeign language: italic\r\n\r\nThe Compa\xF1\xEDa Comarcal de Danza
    demonstrated its <em>chef d'\u0153uvre</em> in 1978 when the <em>Endless Performance</em>,
    an annual show consisting of <em>The Nutcracker</em> and <em>The Swan Princess</em>
    followed by an immense flamenco show, according to dance historian Juan Doj, \"brought
    the house down, both literally and figuratively.\"  The Princess was interpreted
    by Ivana Humpalot, and the Evil Rat King was portrayed by the \"graceful\" Sancho
    Panza."
