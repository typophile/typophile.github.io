  body: "Rodrigo,\r\n\r\nIt's a relaxed sans that kind of reminds me of Myriad and
    Ed Gothic. I like it a lot!\r\n\r\nThe lc c is one of my favorites.  The only
    thing that bugs me are uc M an N.  Maybe make spot where the diagonal stroke joins
    the vertical a little bit thinner?  I'm talking as a graphic designer, since I
    haven't even finished my first font as a type designer.\r\n\r\nBest of luck with
    the project!"

    I find it hard to evaluate with the examples the way they are. It seems like it''s
    pretty solid though. '

  body: "Hi! I just updated this thread that has been dead for long! Check out the
    PDF sample on the original post. I'd love to hear comments on this, once more
    :D I updated a lot of stuff, made a lot of changes, so it might be nicer just
    to look at it as it was just starting.\r\n\r\nThank you so much\r\nRodrigo"

  body: "Wow, what a difference it makes to see it set. I think your basic forms may
    be okay but to fine tune them up you will have decide on your spacing right now
    because unfortunately the font is not very well spaced yet. After you do that
    you may also realize that you can alter the lettershapes for better fit too. And
    then you space things again. And around & around. Hopefully not infinitely. Anyway,
    that is my suggestion. \r\n\r\nAlso, you might want to move the ear of the g up
    to make spacing easier."

  body: "Thanks for the response Eben!\r\nIt's the first time I try to letterspace
    it (No kerning at all at this point). It was done pretty much based on Avenirs
    metrics, just so I didn't start from scratch and not to be as awful as the time
    I tried doing it without any reference at all :D But we'll get there! Thank you
    very much for the answer and I'll keep on refining it.\r\n\r\nAbout the g, I have
    to restart on the double story g and the ear of the g will be up by then :D Let's
    see how it goes :D\r\n\r\nThanks again!\r\nRodrigo"

  body: "Very nice!  I like your font quite a lot.\r\n\r\nThe only suggestion I have
    matches that of antiphrasis: the joins of M, N, W, and w look too black.  This
    could be fixed, for instance, on the top left of the M by shifting the vertical
    leg to the left.\r\n\r\nI think the irony's going over my head. ;)  To me, the
    font seems just very clean and solid.  A bit refined, maybe.\r\n"

  body: "I like it too, some of your letters remind me Kai Bernau's <em><a href=\"http://www.letterlabor.de/\">Neutral</a></em>,
    it will be useful to make a light and bold version of it. I don't know why but
    my computer has some problems with the point of your lower case i\u2026 Anyway
    good job."

  body: "Hey guys, thanks for the encouraging comments,\r\nwhile I don't really have
    new stuff to post yet, I'm working on the spacing, numerals and getting the rest
    of the characters, punctuation etc. roughed out.\r\nI was studying how the numerals
    get to be cohesive with the letters. Where in the alphabet could I find parts,
    that would help build the numbers and make them more cohesive with the rest of
    the font. Any thoughts on that would be greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!\r\nRodrigo

    of all uppercase characters is needed, I think the curved characters like \"O\"
    are not optically adjusted to match straight topped characters.\r\n\r\nRespaced
    the whole thing using Briem's tips (http://briem.ismennt.is/) and then refining.
    It's getting better.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\nRodrigo"
