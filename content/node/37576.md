  identity over the years but I have a new problem, one which I haven't encountered
  before.....\r\n\r\nI can't mention names as the work hasn't been released yet. A
  bank asked me to produce a piece of type to compliment an existing identity. I choose
  several fonts and presented to see what direction they wanted to go. Then then choose
  one (Aksidenz Grot. Ext.) I then modified this font changing several elements so
  that it worked with the accompanying arabic which was supplied by client.... also
  so it was a bespoke piece fit for purpose... so, they love it! Excellent job done....
  Then they ask for a full working typeface based on my modified aksidenz....\r\n\r\nWhat
  to do? As Ive modified heavily does this mean it's a new font, or do I have to go
  to Berthold and ask permission??? Not sure how this works, I want to do the job,
  but at the same time I don't want to break any law!!!!\r\n\r\nANY help would be
  really appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks guys and girls!\r\n\r\nM\r\n\r\n"
