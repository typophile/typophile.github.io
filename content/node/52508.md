  body: "That's a very good start Murray. It's already been done tho, but I guess
    you knew that already.\r\n\r\nThe best advice I can give is to keep going, keep
    experimenting. Don't let my critical assesment discourage you. Type design is
    a thing you really have to work at, and work at, and work at. At times I thought
    I would never make any progress, never come up with original type designs. It
    seemed everything had been done. But by perforce of will and with a great deal
    of effort it happened in the end. It turned out to be worth the effort.\r\n\r\nI
    see from your website you'vre a musician and you have worked for Universal McCann.
    I did a stint with them a few years ago. It's fun comparing them with Starcom.
    Starcom are great.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

  body: "Hi Murray.\r\n\r\nThat's a good start. You should, however, make the circles
    overshoot the baseline and the x-height for optical compensation. Try to look
    at the first image [[http://www.designassembly.org/2008/11/06/making-geometric-type-work/|here]]
    and observe that the stems of a, b, and d are positioned quite higher than the
    tangent of the circle to the horizontal at the bottom.\r\n\r\nGood luck with your
    experimentations. :)"

  body: "Thank's people!\r\n\r\nI know it has already been done, but I'm using it
    as a test to see where the pitfalls are with type design. What I'm actually reeeally
    interested in is finishing this set and making a 'Rounded' one. That hasn't been
    done (well) as far as I know...\r\n\r\nJames - I'm at LBi now... they are fantastic!
    Partly the inspiration behind me getting into this as a side-project."
