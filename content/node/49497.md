body: "Dear Typophiles, \r\n\r\nDesperate is not a strong enough word to describe
  my present situation. With all the projects I should be working on, the last thing
  I wanted was to spend my morning trying to locate my fonts!\r\n\r\nSo here is what
  happened. I while ago I installed FontExplorerX for Windows (I run XP). I figured
  it would help me finally organize my fonts. So I ran the program and it seemed to
  \"index\" all my fonts from my default font folder (in the Control Panel). It created
  a folder for each (!) font file and placed them in a larger folder. Now, when you
  look in  the Control Panel font folder, all the fonts appear to be shortcuts to
  the new location of the font file. \r\n\r\nAnyway, the program would not install
  properly. It would jam during the installation. I tried to repeat the process, but
  the same happened. What I'm trying to do right now is simply move all my font files
  back to the default folder, because I've been noticing that some fonts appear to
  be missing. Today I opened up a file I was working on yesterday and a missing font
  window appeared! Everything was fine yesterday! \r\n\r\nI'm wondering what to do
  next. The only way I can think of is copy all the font files from the FontExplorerX
  folder (this means going through hundreds of folders) to a separate folder, deleting
  the shortcuts in my default font folder, and then pasting the copied files back
  to the default. \r\n\r\nDo you know of any other solutions? Or is my solution flawed?
  Has anyone encountered a similar problem? I'd really appreciate your help. Thank
  you.\r\n\r\nDan"

  body: "The same thing happened to me. I was really keen to try/use FontExplorerX
    (because I'm really quite desperately in need of some way to manage fonts, and
    the consensus seems to be that this will be the best option). The installation
    seemed to work, but in the same way that you describe, the program itself wouldn't
    run. To get my fonts back, I had to go through all those folders and copy everything
    back manually; there are few that still seem to be missing, but I replace things
    as I find out about them.\r\n\r\nThat answer's not much help, I realise, unless
    it's any consolation to know you're not alone..\r\n\r\nSimon"

  body: Eventually I did, but I'd moved all of the contents (at least I thought I
    had done!) I also reinstalled all the standard Windows fonts, which was the most
    pressing since, since when I restarted the computer all the system text had turned
    into a weird sequence of lines and blobs (like Dingbats but worse ... presumably
    as Windows couldn't find its most basic standard fonts for things any more.)

    then reinstalled the rest of the fonts with the help of another font manager (MainType)
    that allows me to preview/install from folders/subfolders.\r\n\r\nFontXplorer
    looked good on the surface, but underneath the hood... horrible. "

  body: Why don't people just use rock solid Adobe ATM 4.1 Deluxe for NT? Still works
    on XP; still works on Vista, and gives you multiple master creation as a bonus.
    ATM Lite is still available as a free download but doesn't have font management.
    Deluxe is discontinued by Adobe but still seems to be available for sale on the
    web. This is a product that can actually be trusted to work.

  body: "I'll note a couple of things:\r\n\r\nFontExplorer X for Windows was a public
    beta. Unlike some public betas, it was really not ready for general use.\r\n\r\nATM
    Deluxe has a pretty primitive UI, and not a lot of features. But it is really
    very stable. As long as you don't object to using an unsupported product, and
    to turning off User Account Control if you're on Vista....\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "If you do acquire a copy of ATM Deluxe 4.1 and proceed to use it there is
    one caution: don't name any of your font sets with more than 31 characters. Should
    you do so, everything in your font list from that folder and below will disappear.
    The only way to fix the problem is to delete the font database and start over.
    This was a lesson I learned the hard way.\r\n\r\nThat being said, the program
    is indeed rock-solid and I use it to this day on my Windows machines."

    all my fonts!).\r\n\r\n@Thomas\r\nAs you point out it was \"beta\" and I understood
    the risk. But crashing repeatedly in during the installation? I did not expect
    that. Maybe a short word of caution for should have been included on the download
    page. I read their \"known issues\" file, but could not find anything relevant
    to my situation.\r\n\r\n@Majus & Spiral\r\nThanks for your instructions and advice."
