  body: "This came up a long time ago, but since the thread author (you?) didn't use
    a nice title, it's lost in the mists of time.\r\n\r\n\"SOAR at EMS\" is Univers.
    \"EAGLEVIEW\" is a free font called Varsity which has been squooshed.\r\n\r\nI
    also see a free font based on the Blade Runner logo, Benguiat Roman, Benguiat
    Gothic, Aviano, ITC Bauhaus, And some grunge fonts that are probably free. Check
    dafont for those.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    it left out the word \"eagle\". I was just asking if you posted it before.\r\n\r\n
