  body: "Decoro (2011), if you customized the E, is the closest commercial font I
    could find:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/john-moore/decoro/\r\n\r\nThere is
    a free font called Lot (2009) that is an exact match. The general policy on this
    forum is not to link to free font sites if a commercial version is available,
    but Lot appears to predate Decoro:\r\nhttp://www.ffonts.net/Lot.font\r\n\r\n[And
    before any other posters jump on me for linking to the free font, I tracked down
    info on the designer, Svetoslav Simov of Fontfabric, and every listing I could
    find lists Lot as a free font. Oddly, it is no longer offered as a free font on
    Fontfabric proper....]"

  body: "Mike, when I went searching for this using the keywords black/extra bold,
    deco, and minimal, I came across dozens of possibilities that differed only slightly
    from one to another.  \r\n\r\nWere they all based on the same Art Deco sources,
    or was too much \"borrowing\" going on? \r\n\r\nThere's a fine line between homage
    and hijacking...but it's still a line."

    early example of this style was the 1929 <a href='http://old.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/bric-a-braque-nf/'

    idea was more modern day, though (along with lots of present day freebie fonts
    that <em>do</em> steal to various degrees).\r\n\r\nA similar revival from Dick

    making those fonts available digitally  (I just wish they were easier to find
    ... )"

  body: "Thanks Mike for the link to a specimen of Milton Glaser's Baby Teeth. FWIIW
    there are differences between this specimen and the Baby Teeth [Photo Lettering]
    shown in the old Letraset catalogs. Your link is also interesting because it shows
    several of Milton Glaser's other variations of Baby Teeth, and presumably some
    knock offs of it.\r\nSimilar fonts, in addition to those already mentioned, include
    P22 Constructivist Block. For more, Google: fonts Pacman.\r\nDon"
