  thinking about using it for commercial use.  But the zip.file wich contains the
  txt.file doesn't say exactly what author I should contact for purchasing and negotiations.
  \ It just lists a bunch of not so serious looking websites.\r\nEven when I google
  the name of the font I'm given a bunch of none sersious looking e-shop sites.\r\n\r\n*****************
  \ Question 1.) **********************\r\nCan someone recommend me to a trusted e-shop
  which sells the \"Old English.ttf\" font?\r\nWhich doesn't cost a fortune.\r\n----------------------------------\r\n\r\nI
  want to use the font for my website, logo, and use the font to print messages on
  T-shirts which I want to sell commercially.\r\n\r\n*****************  Question 2.)
  **********************\r\nWhat sort of license fits my needs?\r\n----------------------------------\r\n\r\nAny
  kind of guidance and tips would be much appreciated.\r\n"

  body: It depends entirely on whose font it is, but if it's a commercial font, a
    basic user license will work for your uses.

  body: Do you have the EULA? I can't help but think we need to know from where you
    licensed the font before we can answer your question. Some foundries allow you
    to use their fonts commercially. Other foundries do not and are quite specific
    about it.

    license, you are allowed to sell images of the characters comprising the font
    on finished products. That's what fonts are for. (Some free fonts specifically
    disallow this under their non-commercial use only clause.) Sometimes the amount
    of use comes into the terms of the license, but that is not typical.\r\n\r\nWhat
    you can't do is package the font software, either on a disc or as a downloadable
    file and sell or give it away it yourself. An entirely different sort of licensing
    is required in that case."
