  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I just wrapped up a logo design for a small business that I did for about ten times less than I should have. I offered to do the job for $250 because I thought it would be a quick wordmark for a yoga teacher, it turned out to be a three-part logo with a brandmark, wordmark, and an add-on workmark for a sub-brand. I was really busy and not sleeping much when I agreed to do the work without raising the price (end of semester stuff) and have a contract with the client for $250.</p>
<p>Now the client is happy with the logo and wants to pay extra. The question is: do I tell her not to worry about it knowing that she&rsquo;s planning to do more business with me, or do I accept the extra cash even though we have a contract?</p>

Maybe this would be the perfect opportunity to charge much more via doing as Elio (ilovecolors) suggests. Rewrite the contract taking into account the additional services you&rsquo;ve rendered.
I feel your pain; that it&rsquo;s embarrassing to undersell yourself so badly that the client feels hesitant accepting on the original terms. Also, why am I not looking at a picture of this wordmark and logo right now? Has your Photoshop broken down?</div>

<p>Now I&rsquo;m always a fan of sucking every last penny from a client, but I think this will end up hurting you down the road. It would be better to just call it good at $250, but make it clear to her that this was more or less a freebie with a small stipend. If she gives you $50 extra, she&rsquo;ll think that she paid you what you&rsquo;re worth (or whatever arbitrary number she comes up with). And then she&rsquo;ll expect those same rates down the road.</p>
<p>Probably your best bet is to walk away, unless you think it would be a really great portfolio piece.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I can&rsquo;t really offer an opinion on this one, but I have a couple of practices that have served me &amp; my company well for almost 30 years.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We have two prices: full price and free. Even friends can understand this one. It should go without saying that if it is a free job, we work just as hard as if we were getting full price.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>95 % of the time, for our work &ndash; even creative work &ndash; we have a price agreed on in advance. Sometime we make a little extra, sometimes we don&rsquo;t; it averages out in the long run. For that other 5% of the time when I come back &amp; ask for more because of some unforeseen complexities, customers almost always agree. I think this is due in part to that 95% consistency; and in part because they too see that the extra work was needed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And a final thing: very occasionally I quote too high, yet the price is agreed to. In that case, similar to when I have to go back &amp; ask for more, we bill less than the agreed amount. I don&rsquo;t view this as a change in price so much as a mistake in assessing the complexities of a job, just like the situation where we ask for more.</p>
<p>FWIW</p>

<p>Coming from a sign design background I have created many logos and various &lsquo;marks&rsquo; to distinguish local companies and services. I&rsquo;ve had customers hammer me with re-vamps on designs, and have had them love my first iterations.</p>
<p>Think about all of the time you have put into developing your skills as an artist FIRST. The time that you involved yourself with the customer evolving and constructing the ideas are SECOND. The actual design process is the most enjoyable part of this business but it&rsquo;s still THIRD.</p>
<p>Take the money James. You&rsquo;ve worked hard for it. Even if it seems like it was too easy&hellip;..It wasn&rsquo;t. You know that. It seems as though your customer knows as well!</p>
<p>Redo the contract with the yoga teacher. You will most likely benefit from a happy client.</p>

<p>How? From what James said, the client recognized that the job was worth more than originally agreed and made the offer of more money. He didn&rsquo;t browbeat her into doing it. Sounds like a great client!</p>
<p>It is always good to have a contract before starting a job (learned the hard way) but it&rsquo;s also important to make clear the scope of the job within the contract. If the contract stipulated a wordmark and the job exceeded that description then you would also have been within your right to negotiate for additional money.</p>

I think being honest with the client and calculate how much it should have been (actual figure at full rate) and then make a price that you both agree to, though the quote would have been logo only?</p>
<p>If however you undersell yourself now, they will expect that sort price in the future.</p>

<p>It’s a two-part logo designed at the client’s request: an abstract brandmark that can be used as an element of other designs and a wordmark that secondary brands can be attached two. The plan is for this to be a high-end, yoga-centric lifestyle products company.</p>

<p>If the client doubled or tripled the money, great, take the money. But if she thinks paying extra means $20 and a Starbucks card, then I would turn that extra amount down. Accepting a small extra amount sends a completely wrong message to the client: you can arbitrarily decide what my work is worth, and feel generous and fair in your actions. I would want to send the message that $250 was a student rate, and was a one time only deal.</p>

They know you&rsquo;re a fresh-faced designer that&rsquo;s up and coming. The extra money could be considered a tip for exceptional services rendered, or an investment in future services rendered. When you&rsquo;re more established and have a better idea of how and what to quote, this will happen less and less, but by then you&rsquo;ll be more solid in your quoting and contracting that you&rsquo;ll be earning what you&rsquo;re worth.</p>
<p>Take it and remember to give them as good or better service next time they come around. Also, don&rsquo;t forget to charge them accordingly next time as well.</p>

<p>This is why he shouldn&rsquo;t take it &ndash; it sets up a dynamic where the designer is now in debt to the generosity of the client. Unless it&rsquo;s coming from your beloved grandmother, money almost always has strings attached.</p>
