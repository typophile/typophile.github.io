    did too.

    the person was like than what the usual gravestone would.

  body: Are you kidding me? This is FANTASTIC!! I didn't even know you could get a
    custom font on a headstone like this...this opens up possiblities. Now all I have
    to do is decide which one of my fonts I want on mine...what better way to leave
    a testimonial to my life. Of course that's AT LEAST 50 years away :)

  body: That's obviously Photoshop, but yes, you could get any font you want laser-etched
    into a headstone. There is actually a market for <a href="http://www.pacificcoastmemorials.com/gallery.php?gallery=hand_etched_art">hideous
    themed tombstones</a>, so maybe designers should start getting into that business
    and clean them up a little
