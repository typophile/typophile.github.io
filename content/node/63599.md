  this one and it's awesome, I still have to create the italic, bold, and bold italic
  also, and I get depressed.\r\n\r\nFor things like scripts or upright italics, one
  variant is fine, but what about other typefaces? Is it wrong to not want to do them?
  In the end am I doing my type a disservice because less people will consider the
  single cut as being \"complete\"?"

    as a text face, then I think you'd want at least italic, and probably bold and
    bold italic. If it veers more towards a display face, I think you're fine (although
    additional weights are always good, and thankfully, they're a heck of a lot easier
    to do than italic).\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    at least one different style (it could simply be a semibold, for example, not
    necessarily an italic), for emphasis and such, will greatly improve the usefulness
    of the design.\r\nBut maybe you don't mind seeing your typefaces in the wild faux-bolded
    and faux-italicized... ;-)"

  body: "You don't have to even do both cases if you don't want to. (I'm guessing
    someone somewhere's made some serious cash out of Trajan, and no-one would consider
    that it's incomplete.\r\n\r\nSeriously though, for credibility, you've got to
    do one of the following:\r\n(a) surrender and do at least 4 fonts, maybe 64+,
    or\r\n(b) execute one of the finest pieces of design ever; see for example Transport
    Medium and Heavy (\"no italics please, we're British, and we like to be able to
    read our road signs from 10 miles\").\r\n\r\nI guess we're talking \"Display fonts
    get you off the hook.\"\r\n\r\nThe fact that more and more type designers are
    venturing into super-family territory is not going to help your cause if you are
    designing something that's not for display purposes (whatever that even means).\r\n\r\nWho
    is to blame for this obsession with complete saturation of a type family? Are
    you simply vocalising an irritation that we all have with having unrealistic and
    unnecessary expectations on us all because there are a select handful of 'freaks'
    who have no problems designing MM fonts with 17 axes! \r\n\r\nOr are the rest
    of us just lazy or economically unproductive.\r\n\r\nGreat thread, Dan. This would
    make a superb thesis (\"Are we all striving for the unattainable?\" or \"The (fair
    and unfair) obligations of a credible type designer\") Would love to hear what,
    for example, Jonathan Hoefler's view is. Probably something like, \"Put the customer
    first and don't forget to give the customer exactly what he wants, making sure
    you never let the customer down, and, if in doubt, put yourself in the position
    of the customer and then exceed the customer's expectation at every level.\" If
    that's the case, that approach has certainly led to some of the most amazingly
    broad and robust type families in recent times.\r\n\r\n "

  body: "Dan,\r\nIn the past 5 years, I have started and am still working on 17 different
    type families. A few have just one weight and some have 10, some have italics
    and some not. I don't recommend this way of working, it drives me nuts. I finally
    squeezed out one lousy font and put it on the market. It was a battle that I had
    with myself causing anguish and tears. I finally gave up and just released one
    stinking font just to relieve the pressure of the whole damn mess. My advice is
    just put one out and add to it later. The longer you wait, the harder it gets
    to let go.\r\nI have nearly finished seven variations of that font now and three
    versions of another. I hope I can persevere and get them out on the market soon.
    Life is not easy and I should know better after all these years.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    Thank you. Dez, that is exactly the kind of response that helps not only myself,
    but anyone in the same boat."
