  it is written that I should delete the text in the note, and then close it.\r\n\r\nI
  do this, but the note is still there.\r\n\r\nCan anyone delete notes at all?\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/notes_4031.png]"

  body: That works for me and I'm on a mac. Are you doing it from the font window
    or from the individual glyph window? Maybe that makes a difference.

    note \u2013 delete the text inside the note \u2013 and then just close it.\r\n\r\nIs
    that how you do also?\r\nThanks for helping."

  body: "I just tried it on a font. I opened it from the glyph cell in the main font
    window, deleted the text and closed. The note was still there as you said. Then
    I opened the glyph widow for that cell and opened the note from there. The text
    was still in it even. I deleted the text from there, closed it and it did go away.
    \r\n\r\nThat seems like a small bug in the program, but it did work for me from
    the glyph window."

    robofab.world import CurrentFont\r\n\r\nf = CurrentFont()\r\nfor g in f:\r\n\tg.note
    = \"\"\r\n\tg.update()\r\n\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nIt should
    blank all notes.\r\n(note that you will have to have Robofab installed).\r\n\r\nCheers.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Ramiro,\r\n\r\nThanks for helping out.\r\n\r\nDo you mean I should just copy/paste
    that in to a new program in the macro editor and hit play? If so, then this result
    is produced in the Output-panel:\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n
    \ File \"<string>\", line 7\r\n    g.note = \u201C\u201D\r\n    ^\r\nIndentationError:
    expected an indented block\r\n\r\nDid I do something wrong?\r\n\r\nIt is amazing
    that a simple task as removing a note should be so hard ;-) Why dont they just
    add a command \"delete note\"?"

  body: "Hi Goran,\r\n\r\nSorry, my mistake. Indentations are important in loops:\r\n\r\nfrom
    robofab.world import CurrentFont\r\n\r\nf = CurrentFont()\r\nfor g in f:\r\n\u2014g.note
    = \"\"\r\n\u2014g.update()\r\n\r\n(copy & paste but **replace the mdashes before
    g.note and g.update() for single indentations**)\r\n\r\nThis should work fine
    if you have Robofab installed.\r\n\r\nGreetings.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
