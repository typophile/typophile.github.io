  body: I thought it would be neat to squeeze things together. After I did that, it
    seemed like there needed to be a bold weight. Now that I&#39;ve done that I think
    the &#34;V&#34;, &#34;W&#34;, &#34;X&#34;, &#34;Y&#34;, &#34;v&#34;, and &#34;w&#34;
    seem a little out of place. Maybe even the &#34;m&#34;, &#34;n&#34;, and &#34;r&#34;.
    I like the characters on their own, but just not sure they fit. Hum, maybe even
    the &#34;G&#34;, &#34;3&#34;, and &#34;4&#34;. The compact version needs some
    kerning, maybe that has something to do with it... <BR>
