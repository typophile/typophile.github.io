  body: 'Can''t state if it''s a font or not. The closest I have is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/kostelansky/kostel-infinity-sans|Kostel
    Infinity Sans]]. Could be the one or not... More candidates for customization
    (mainly making /A top larger): [[http://www.dafont.com/alien-encounters.font|Alien
    Encounters]] SF, [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/daltonmaag/elevon|Elevon]] (good
    one simply closing /A counter)'
