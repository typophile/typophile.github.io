  body: "Does it have to be Flash? Why not just the usual method? :-\r\nhttp://support.microsoft.com/kb/310430\r\n\r\nPersonally,
    I think executing Flash as part of the login process is too fiddly, would annoy
    the users and slow down things down too much.\r\n\r\nIf you do wish to do this
    anyway, you'll need to create a batch file that somehow executes the Flash in
    a window (not sure off hand how you'd do this), place this and the Flash file
    in a location accessible to all users, then set the batch to run as a login script
    for all users via a Group Policy in the Active Directory snap-in.\r\n\r\nMore
    on logon scripts:\r\nhttp://www.rlmueller.net/LogonScriptFAQ.htm\r\n\r\nAnd yes,
    it is kinda the wrong forum for this :) Try a Windows Administration forum or
    Microsoft's support site."
