body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI'm working on an Arabic version of an English software, and
  I'm really confused as to what font to use as the default font for software interface.\r\nSince
  this software will use the default system font (btw what's the default system font
  for Arabic Windows?) for input fields and dropdown lists and etc., I want to make
  sure the UI font doesn't look too different from the default system font. The UI
  font will be used at sizes between 14px to 30px. Also for English I was using Milo
  as the UI font.\r\nI know similar questions have been brought up in the past, but
  I wasn't able to find an answer after reading all those posts.\r\n\r\nRight now
  I'm looking at Tahoma, but still undecided yet. I have also tried simplified arabic,
  but [[http://maricastudio.net/temp/2.png|the result]] isn't very good (actually
  I think it looks terrible) to my eyes. But again I know nothing about Arabic, so
  forgive me if I sound ignorant.\r\n\r\nMarica"

    the benefit of a true bold, scales better too. MicroSS only really works well
    at 8pt. \r\n\r\nAvoid Simplified Arabic. Might want to look at Arial and TNR.
    \r\n\r\nPreference amongst native readers is somewhat mixed, and depends on the
    language for some extent.   \r\n\r\nThere are some good third party UI fonts.
    Might want to consider talking to Mamoun Sakkal, Monotype, Ascender or Bitstream.
    \r\n\r\nCheers, Si "

    Maybe the FontFont ISV sales folks can suggest something matched for the Arabic
    or may be willing to produce a custom Arabic.   '

  body: "Thanks for the replies Si.\r\n\r\nThis software is aimed at professional
    users who should be pretty familiar with computers, so I guess most of them may
    have got used to reading text set in european fonts? I googled for some random
    Arabic website and went through their css files, turns out there aren't much difference
    in the choice of web fonts. Anyway I think you are right about avoiding Simplified
    Arabic.\r\n\r\nThe software doesn't actually have a UI font, but lots of little
    images with text on them. It's a pain to edit them, really."

  body: If you're not shipping a font, or tied to a system font then that opens up
    more possibilities. Might want to look at Sakkal Majalla - it was originally designed
    as a UI font.

    This will definitely look no different from the rest of UI. \r\n\r\nAll system
    fonts used for UI in Windows support Arabic."
