  long time</A>, and I think that it's finally going to be ready for release just
  as soon as I can whittle down the kerning pairs so that it doesn't drop half of
  them at random upon generation (apparently 250 pairs is too many... and yes, there
  are classes), and then learn how to do the hinting right.\r\n\r\nBefore I do, though,
  I should start letting other people look at it again. Is there anything I don't
  see? (I see the crap kerning.) I'm particularly interested in opinions on how I've
  handled the nonLatin alphabets. I know there is something inherently perverse about
  making Greek into a biform unicase, but Cyrillic takes to it quite naturally, and
  I hope it's as successful as I, an anglophone, think it is. Are there any unacceptable
  transgressions? And, if you hope to use this font yourself, no matter where you
  are, are there any characters you would expect to use that are conspicuous in their
  absence?"

    must be something else.

  body: "Yes, I've heard of fonts having several thousand kerning pairs, I think...\r\nThis
    is pretty neat. I like the quirky way you have serifs blended with cut-off terminals
    (like on the G or between the S and T for instance). I love the caps especially.
    There's a kind of uncial feel going on in there too, which is surprising considering
    the sharp edges. The AKMWY are my favourites. I find the lowercase letters less
    successful and the curves look less polished. I find 2 unbalanced (always my hardest
    glyph by far!) and the regular e somehow distorted up close. I think \xA3 could
    have a lower crossbar like the F? There's something wrong with the bottom curve
    of a in the bold and black, where it retroflexes back down to join the stem.\r\nYour
    italic ampersand is fascinating. Bold and black somehow look better to me than
    the regular, not sure why. Can't say anything about the nonlatin glyphs I'm afraid. "

  body: "Nice work, seems like the Cyrillic/Greek really outshines the other letters
    for sure. The latin characters \"e\" and the R's could use a bit more work but
    the rest are pretty consistent.\r\n\r\nAs far as the kerning issues, normally
    if I have kerning issues, the font is not spaced properly. Spacing is 99% of making
    a font look good also. Kerning really cements the fine details but if you are
    having to kern one letter a lot more than the others, its probably a spacing issue. "

    they help, I know)\r\nYour project is awesome. It looks really elegant.\r\nI love
    the italic variable, it is so fluid over text.\r\nI think the minuscule \"a\"
    of the regular latin version is a bit overweighted, but just a bit, it may be
    because of its top part which is a bit thicker than I think it should be.\r\nThis
    is my opinion, only my opinion. \r\nI strong believe that your font is superb,
    so keep it up!\r\nBest,\r\nMaximiliano R. Sproviero\r\n\r\n[[http://www.flickr.com/msproviero|Li\xE1n

  body: "Thanks very much; I've made adjustments benefiting from just about all of
    your comments, plus some others from my friends (the s was lacking overshoot,
    for instance). See the new pdf.\r\n\r\nThe missing pairs were caused by putting
    multiple alphabets all into the same kerning classes. I've separated the classes
    out, but I still need to sort them into their language categories.\r\n\r\nCan
    you help me decide: The crossbar of the regular Latin capital A is really low,
    originally owing to the face's concept of big spacious counters wherever possible.
    I raised the crossbar some in its Greek and Cyrillic equivalents lest they be
    too easily confused with \u0394 and \u0414. Should I also change the Latin A to
    match, or is it okay that way?\r\n"
