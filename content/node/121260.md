body: "Definitely a typeface with a long story for me. After several adoptions for
  sub pixel rendering I newly had to make some redesigns for a retina display version
  <cite>without</cite> sub pixel rendering (lately problematic in iOS8).\r\nAfter
  the time and many corrections with what Frederic Goudy once called the <cite>fresh
  eye effect</cite> it became slightly more classic gothic more in the direction of
  a Chanel like typeface. This was caused by making design automatically bolder and
  lighter a few times doing the needed corrections by hand.\r\nAs since I had started
  over the time many letters have undergone improvements that I wouldn\u2019t want
  to get lost during the re-process."
