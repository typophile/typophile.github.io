  is a twist/been inspired by a quintessentially English typeface \u2013 such as Gill
  Sans / Baskerville / or other any others not known to me \u2013 I am already aware
  of the connection between Baskerville and Mrs. Eaves \u2013 but everything else
  is welcome.\r\n\r\nMany thanks\r\nJ\r\n\r\n"
