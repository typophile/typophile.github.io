  find the stroke weights homogeneous? Should some characters be designed differently?
  All comments will be most welcome and very much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n"

  body: "Looks nice, the colour of the text is quite even.\r\nOnly, maybe I am wrong,
    but the overall weight of seems rather light to me for use in books around 9 or
    10 pt. You might want to compare with other book faces at the same x-height to
    get an idea of the stroke weight.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nArtur"
