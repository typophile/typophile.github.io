  take the pleasure to announce the release of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/andreas-stotzner/andron-2-eir-corpus/|Andron-2-Irish]].\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Tschild_Andron_Irisch_2_3476.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Tschild_Andron_Irisch_1_5661.png]\r\n\r\nAndron
  Irish is the youngest child in the ever-growing Andron family. Together with Andron-Latin,
  Andron-English, Andron-Deutsch, Andron-ABC and other brothers and sisters it forms
  a unique set of specialized typefaces in a classical style.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Tschild_Andron_Irisch_3_4197.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/schild_Andron_Irisch_4_5266.png]\r\n\r\nAndron-Irish
  is a comprehensively furnished suite of 5 fonts. Now you can use Italics, Bold and
  small caps as with Latin, the usual way. A fancy extra is the middlecase font with
  uncial glyphs. It follows the proportions of the  [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/andreas-stotzner/andron-mc/|Andron
  MC series]].\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Tschild_Andron_Irisch_6_5582.png]\r\n\r\nOpentype
  features have been implemented to enable the easy use of alternative insular glyphs
  as well as to switch from modern orthography to the tradional one.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Tschild_Andron_Irisch_8_6723.png]\r\n\r\nBest
  wishes for St Patrick\u2019s day \u2026 !"

  body: I did not even know there was an Irish script! This is beautiful - love the
    harp-like A and the many letters that seem to be half Latin and half Arabic. Kudos
    and good luck.
