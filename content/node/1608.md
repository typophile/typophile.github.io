  body: Okay, calling them design 1, 2, 3 and 4 in descending order, design 3 to me
    has the most potential, the O and the N have a nice shape. <BR> <BR>R and T need
    work, as does the weight of the S especially when looking at smaller point size.
    <BR> <BR>Design 1 isn&#39;t bad either, design 2 looks like design 1 gone too
    far &#40;but maybe combining the best of these two versions might work?&#41;

  body: Hey Phillip, <BR> <BR>The 3rd one translates and looks the best. I also <BR>like
    the 2nd as a whacked alternative &#40;except for <BR>the B&#41;. My main problem
    with the 1st is it halfway <BR>between the 3rd and 2nd, maybe combine the best
    <BR>of 1st &amp; 2nd like Christian said. The 4th is too <BR>plain. Maybe keep
    it as a bitmap version? <BR> <BR>Got a charachter set to view? <BR> <BR>Bren <BR>

  body: I like the third flavor as well. You should post a full set of  <BR>the characters
    you have so far. I will say that I don&#39;t care  <BR>for the W, Y, and F so
    far.

    It&#39;s similar to what  <BR>you&#39;ve done here.

  body: 'I agree with Brennan, and think the B in all versions needs to be opened
    up -upper bowl- or at least revisited. I am enjoying 1 the best.  I think the
    &#39;exterior wall&#39; design is strong and playful but not soo rigid, as in  3
    &amp; 4. '

  body: haha, I guess Christian decided it was time to review it. I didnt check the
    date either. ;&#41; <BR> <BR>So is it finished or still in development? <BR>I
    like the sample you have above, especially the alternates. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>

  body: it&#39;s a working font, but since i haven&#39;t sent it out into the world,
    i suppose it&#39;s still in development. It&#39;s a set of fonts rather than just
    one design. <BR>-phillip
