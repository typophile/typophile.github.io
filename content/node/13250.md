body: "[[House Industries]] is seeking a motivated, enthusiastic and talented lover
  of typography to draw little letters and make them into unique and innovative working
  typefaces. Must be a reliable self-starter who can take multiple projects and run
  with them while working with input from multiple sources. Strong bezier drawing
  skills, a knowledge of FontLab and willingness to learn proprietary techniques also
  a must. All House Industries projects are team efforts, so loners, big egos and
  \"artistes\" need not apply. Must be willing to relocate to the area and work in
  our Yorklyn studio, which is a quiet, relaxed setting with few distractions. We
  will provide relocation assistance. If you are interested, please send a brief synopsis
  of your qualifications and a few samples of your work to getajob@houseind.com.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nRich"

    little letters\", or do they have to do 12 months of kerning and hinting before
    they can move up the ladder?\r\n\r\nI mean, does the team work involve division
    of labor by task, or by typeface?"
