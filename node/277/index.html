		<div class="commentbody">If you prep the images carefully, e.g. by adjusting curve contrast before converting to b/w, you can get pretty good results from ScanFont. Also, you can edit the position of glyphs on the bitmap within ScanFont, so you can align to and specify a common baseline. <BR> <BR>I don't use ScanFont very often, but when I do I usually select the tightest fit in the tracing options. This will result in hundreds of nodes, but will very closely wrap to the bitmap outline, including all bumps and nicks. I then put the resulting outline in the mask layer in FontLab and construct a clean outline on top of it. <BR> <BR>I have S.R. Rao's book on decipherment of the Indus Valley script.

Streamline is more intuitive. Be nice if Adobe would at the very least upgrade the import and export features as long as they are still bothering to market the software.

		<div class="commentbody">Tom, SF-Mac version 4.0 and SF-Win version 3.x are very different. I think that John mean Win version which allows to name cells inside ScanFont. We decided to not include this feature to version 4 on the Mac because it will not add much value - it is so easier to just drag-drop a cell to the correct place in the font than to fill in all names. <BR> <BR>OCR seems to be a good idea for ScanFont but we yet not made good algorithm that is really shape-independent.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yuri, thanks again, that makes sense. I was dragging one cell at a time and it was getting a bit tedious. I didn't think to select multiple cells and drag them to a starting point in the font. Once I did this, it all made sense. (I'm a little slow to catch on!) <BR> <BR>This feature does not seem to be covered very well in the documentation. At least I wasn't able to find it.</div>
