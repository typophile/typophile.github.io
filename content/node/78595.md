  Type And Why\r\nMatteo Bologna\r\nMonday, February 7, 2011, 6:30 pm\r\nThe Rose
  Auditorium in the New Academic Building\r\n41 Cooper Square at East 7th St, New
  York, NY \r\n\r\nMr. Bologna will talk about the reasoning that informs the choice
  of typefaces during the design process. Why does the designer choose certain typefaces
  instead of others and what do these choices mean for the audience? Mr. Bologna will
  accomplish this by exposing the behind-the-scenes operations of Mucca Design.\r\n\r\nType
  Design as a Second Career:\r\nW.A. Dwiggins Starts Over at Age 49\r\nPaul Shaw\r\nMonday,
  March 7, 2011, 6:30 pm\r\nThe Rose Auditorium in the New Academic Building\r\n41
  Cooper Square at East 7th St, New York, NY \r\n\r\nThis talk will place Dwiggins\u2019
  type design efforts into the context of his wide-ranging career as a commercial
  artist, examining the impact of calligraphy, historical typefaces, stencils, marionettes
  and book design on his typefaces. It will explore his thoughts and theories about
  type design, especially the M-Formula which has had a far-reaching influence on
  contemporary digital typefaces. Dwiggins\u2019 career will also be situated within
  the context of type design as a nascent profession in the 20th century."
