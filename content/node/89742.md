  Every time I double click on the ampersand Stylistic Alternate #2(salt2) or Stylistic
  Alternate#3(salt3) in the glyph palette, Stylistic Alternate(salt) gets inserted
  in my text box. Is there another way to access the #2 and #3 ampersand glyphs?\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone else have this problem?\r\n\r\n"

    will only give me the first alternate. There are three ampersand alternates in

  body: "@Josh\r\nTurned off all stylistic sets and still can't get it.\r\n\r\n@Nina\r\nI
    don't have InDesign on my 9to5 machine (Web Premium only). I'll try when I get
    home.\r\n\r\nThanks everyone!\r\n\r\nOn a side note, I've also experienced similar
    problems with a free OpenType font called Lavendria. I know you get what you pay
    for so I shouldn't complain about it and have learned my lesson. Basically the
    only lowercase /e/ that I could use was a swashed alternate even though I could
    see the normal /e/ in the glyph palette. I ended up inserted an /\xE9/ every time
    I needed /e/ and deleted the accent. Painful. \r\n"

    don't need to \xBBdouble-click\xAB in the Glyph Palette. You click-and-hold on
    the base character (&), the fly-out menu appears revealing all the alternative
    characters for this base glyph. Then you just hover over the one you want and
    let go. The character will be inserted. I just tried it again using Arno Pro in
    Illustrator. "

  body: "What version of Illustrator are you using? I\u2019m going to guess CS5. \r\n\r\n(And
    Ralf, I\u2019m going to guess you\u2019re using something different, probably
    CS5.5.)\r\n\r\nI\u2019m pretty sure there is a known bug in various CS5 apps such
    that they do not properly interpret GSUB Lookup Type 3, alternate substitutions.
    These are the ones that take the syntax \u201Csub <em>x</em> from [<em>x.alt</em>
    <em>x.alt2</em> <em>x.alt3</em>]\u201D.\r\n\r\nThe app only substitutes the first
    in the list. Which is what Trevor is experiencing. I am able to duplicate his
    problem on my machine with Arno Pro and Illustrator CS5. (Other fonts, too.)\r\n\r\nWe
    experienced a similar bug with Richard Lipton\u2019s Canto. We noticed it in InDesign,
    where the entire Swash feature doesn\u2019t work in CS5 because of the presence
    of a few Type 3 lookups. \r\n\r\nThe OTL implementation in InDesign is a little
    different, so you can in fact insert the glyphs from the glyph palette. I believe
    that is because InDesign CS5 converts to GIDs when inserting from the glyph palette.
    (You can also insert the Arno Pro alt ampersands.)\r\n\r\nBut copying from InDesign
    and pasting back into Illustrator won\u2019t help, because Illustrator doesn\u2019t
    use the GID, instead relying on the feature \u2014 which is implemented incorrectly.
    So, basically there\u2019s no way (that I have discovered) for Trevor to get the
    ampersand he wants from within Illustrator CS5. \r\n\r\nVarious attempts to alter
    the Canto OTL code to work around this caused it to not work as desired in other
    versions. So, in the end we decided to leave it, because the feature was in fact
    written to spec and this is essentially an Adobe bug of not implementing to spec.
    \r\n\r\nTrevor, you can try scouring the Adobe support sites to see if there was
    an update release to fix this. I can\u2019t swear that I\u2019m using the absolute
    latest version.\r\n\r\nI believe these issues are resolved in all CS5.5 versions.
    (But, of course, that\u2019s an actual upgrade, not an update.)\r\n\r\nOr go backwards.
    I believe previous versions also work fine. I know CS3 does. Never had CS4."
