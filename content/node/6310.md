  body: 'I think it&#39;s pretty nice. It&#39;ll look great at larger point size.
    <BR> <BR>My only complaints are that the &#34;D&#34;/&#34;d&#34; are too close,
    and some letters &#40;like &#34;F&#34;/&#34;f&#34; are too rigid&#41;. BTW, the
    numerals are really cool. Spacing: As you probably already realize it needs work,
    but I&#39;d also point out that the blank space a bit tight. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: The d/D might use more variation, but the rigidity in the f/F only helps support
    the rigidity/straight strokes of some of the others letters.  <BR> <BR>This is
    beautiful Dan, delicate and strong. Lovely large too.

  body: It&#39;s nice, but I think the lowercase letters should be a little darker.
    &#40;Also, it seems that most of the lc characters are just scaled down versions
    of the Uc?&#41;

  body: 'Thanks a lot guys! Here is a gif with an idea for a new capital D: <BR>&#40;old
    D&#43;d, new D&#43;old D, new D&#43;d&#41; <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/47341.gif"
    alt="new capital D?"> <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll enlarge that space, Hrant. <BR> <BR>Eduardo:
    Yes, most of the lower case are just scaled down upper case letters, except for
    a, d, f, h, j, l, q, and y. I guess that you are suggesting that I design more
    true lowercase, huh? And darker ones at that? I&#39;ll get to work and post a
    new PDF in a few days.'

    certainly needs adjustments of weight and width.'

  body: 'ok, thanks for the tip! Here&#39;s another question: do you think that the
    lowercase i need a dot? can a lowercase i be legible without one. I&#39;m dotless
    at the moment, but am thinking that maybe I should change that'

  body: Matha Standun once told me that a dotted &#34;i&#34; is inauthentic for Gaelic.
    But a dot is also that letter&#39;s only saving grace in terms of legibility/readability.
    And since a dotless &#34;i&#34; is a standard character, I&#39;d leave the main
    one dotted &#40;unless this font is specifically for Gaelic text&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: this isn&#39;t specifically for any language I&#39;ll change the i. The standard
    256-character set includes a dotless i anyway, and the accented i that appears
    above has an accent instead of a dot a normal i without a dot is probably too
    wierd. &#34;Type design is about giving up all of your good ideas&#34; &#40;Charles

  body: I think the capital A has slightly too much weight to it. Other than that
    I think it's quite a beautiful font. It probably wouldn't work as well in a modern
    language though. Part of its beauty is the old style which relates with Anglo-Saxon.
    I think for that reason a dot on the i really isn't needed. Hopefully this feedback
    (or rather comment at this point) is still appreciated, more than 5 years after
    showing your font ;)

    at school so I have a fondness for it. So what's happening with your font?
