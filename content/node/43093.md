  it really hard to find a new font for them that looks good against their logo. \r\n\r\nThe
  logo is REALLY 80's. Not sure what the typeface is, but it's a very geometric font.
  Looks something like [[http://www.linotype.com/155774/monolithsquarebold-font.html|Monolith
  square bold]], but all uppercase.\r\n\r\nnew brand image is thinking along the lines
  of 'high value', 'pristine', 'classy' & 'modern chic'\r\n\r\nJust wondering if anyone
  could throw out some suggestions for a typeface to use.\r\n\r\nThankyou very much
  :)\r\n\r\nMatt"

  body: "Thanks for the reply\r\n\r\nNo.. not to 'match' as such. Just a more practical
    font for all communications that doesn't jar with the logo.\r\n\r\nI see where
    you're going with Microgramma. Letters are fairly squared off. Luxury is too far.\r\n\r\nAny
    other suggestions?\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n\r\nMatt\r\n"

    versatility. Lots of different weights extended and condensed and the face would
    compliment but not compete with the logo face. '
