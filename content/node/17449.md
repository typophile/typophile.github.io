  I'm relatively new here, this is my second post, but checking Typophile several
  times a day is already a daily routine for me.\r\n\r\nI designed this logotype for
  a webhosting company called W3SERVE. The letters are designed by myself. I think
  they are appropriate for this type of company. They are robust, a thing you also
  want to expect from a server, and are easily associated with computers and the internet.
  \r\n\r\nThe client already saw the design and liked it, but maybe you have some
  critique and/or suggestions. Everything is welcome.\r\n\r\nDavid\r\n\r\n"

    this even closer to a pixel grid, and make all the counters the same optical width
    as the strokes. I might try to bring more diagonals in too, since the one in the
    V seems a little lonely.\r\n\r\nThat said I think what you've got already functions
    admirably, and if the client likes it that's a strong argument to leave everything
    the way it is!"
