  body: 'It is very similar but not strictly identical to Castle, of which there is
    a number of cuts by a wealth of foundry. Look around identifont for fonts similar
    to Castle and chances are you will find one that suits your needs. Also check
    dafont: some of the detailing suggests it might not be a professional font but
    a rip off.'
