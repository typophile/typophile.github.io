  characters in trying to create my own typeface and been researching on various websites
  and books.\r\n\r\nI was just wondering what all of you do in starting to design
  a typeface as books and resources i have found all have different ideas which has
  just left me a bit stuck on how i should progress and what typeface i should design.\r\n\r\nSo
  far i have just been sketching i started of with the lowercase n and liked the look
  so have started to progress to other characters in no particular order or fashion.\r\n\r\nIs
  there certain characters that use the same elements e.g n and h (should i start
  with these?)\r\n\r\nAlso i just started sketching without thinking if the typeface
  would lend itself to display, text etc is this a bad idea and should you think of
  its purpose first before starting to design a font?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sketchbook_5419.1.png]"

  body: "Thanks for the info.\r\n\r\nI have decided to start with a display font to
    be used in print.\r\n\r\n\u2022 When designing a display typeface what is usually
    the best size to design to would it be around 24pt?\r\n\u2022 Is there a specific
    width that makes the font roman or bold or is it just dependant on the visual
    difference between each.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n~J"

    be used in. This is tricky for signs ;) \r\n\r\nFor display, you might consider
    48 to 60 points. \r\n"

    site very useful as I designed my first (and only, to date) typeface.\r\n\r\nhttp://briem.net\r\n\r\nBriem
    is a veteran designer, and the site is essentially the syllabus and notes from
    a type design course he taught."
