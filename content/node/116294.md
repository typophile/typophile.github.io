  body: "I haven't been able to find anything that matches this. It is hard to be
    sure, but repeated letters seem not identical. Is it just a poor scan? If not,
    then this might be calligraphy.\r\n\r\nThere are several Sudtipos fancy scripts
    that have alternate glyphs that allow this sort of flair. My suggestion is to
    look at those for an alternative.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Nothing for me as well. Thought it could have been some Hallmark for William
    Arthur but no luck. Finally, found it was a custom hand lettering by [[http://www.bespokepress.com.au/invitation/angela-and-justin|bespoke
