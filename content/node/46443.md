  suggest for a sports club magazine where the audience is age 35 to 75?\r\n\r\nLooking
  for body copy, captions for photos and headlines with subheadings.  \r\nAlso includes
  1 table of stats (numbers) in one article.\r\n\r\nCurrently using Helvetica Neue
  (body copy) and Universe as the boss recommended.  \r\nLooking for something more
  updated.\r\n\r\nAppreciate any suggestions.\r\n\r\nRaymond"

  body: I think Caecilia sets a very sporty tone. It's a slab serif though. It can
    team up very nice with something friendly like Frutiger.

  body: I also like Kievit a lot, but it might not be "tough" enough for sports.

  body: "Being bang in the middle of that demographic, I would second the idea of
    a slab serif. Legibility is an issue for those 40+, so try to avoid text type
    with too fine details. Sure, you can go with a larger sized serif face (or sans),
    but that cuts down on the amount of copy per page, and makes things look banal.
    So a sturdy text face would be good, and a slab serif would be considered more
    sporty than say a Clarendon. <a href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/bodoni.html\">Bodoni
    Egyptian</a> is mine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    boss who seems to like san serifs for body copy.\r\n\r\nHey Mr. Shinn, would you
    say that Frutiger, Avenir or Universe goes with your suggestion of the Bodoni
    Egyptian?\r\n\r\n"

  body: 'L Raymond: Bodoni and Futura team up real nice, and Futura and Avenir are
    both geometrics.  I would give Avenir a go, print out some test samples and see
    if it works. I find Avenir a bit mild - futura is very pointy and dynamic. It
    could work great for this kinda stuff.'

  body: "<em>would you say that Frutiger, Avenir or Universe goes with your suggestion
    of the Bodoni Egyptian?</em>\r\n\r\nI'm afraid I don't think any of those have
    enough punch and snap for magazine headlines, except perhaps for the Black weights.\r\nAlso,
    they have all been a bit too well-used in corporate communications.\r\n\r\nI just
    tried out Clan, which I got a few weights of with the Font Stars CD, and it looks
    quite interesting, contemporary shapes, and with a massive x-height. These settings
    are with Bodoni Egyptian at 9 on 10. I would work out a strategy, for instance
    use Clan Extra Bold u&lc, with Clan Book all Caps -- but no Book u&lc settings
    (that style has bad contrast with Bodoni E). \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sports_6411.png]"
