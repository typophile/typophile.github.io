  are pleased to announce the launch of a new, fully redesigned <a href=\"http://www.sudtipos.com\">Sudtipos
  web site</a>, with many features and new additions.\r\n\r\nThe new site was built
  to accommodate the showing and interactivity with the many fonts we have developed
  over the past three years. The reconfigured interface now includes a rollover list
  that quickly previews each font in the Sudtipos collection.\r\n\r\nAnother important
  addition to the site is the Sudtipos Probador\u2122, our fully interactive type
  tester that allows users of the site to try any Sudtipos font on screen before licensing.\r\n\r\nTwo
  new sections were added, one to showcase the use of Sudtipos fonts by the general
  public, and one to preview upcoming fonts and projects in development.\r\n\r\nWe
  hope you enjoy the new Sudtipos web experience. Please direct any feedback to sudtipos@sudtipos.com"
