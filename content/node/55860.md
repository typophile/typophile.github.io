  phone at Igor's website. The Luna typeface looks nice, but I'm curious about what
  typeface it is. Can anyone help? Thanks in advance. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/luna3-lg_6554.gif]\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nJZ"

  body: "OK... Looks like no one can help. I just tried and found <a href=\"http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=413812\">The
    Sans B8 Extra Bold Regular</a> is the closest match. I assume that the typeface
    is slightly modified one. Any other suggestions will be much appreciated. \r\n\r\nJZ"

    serif typefaces, but its' only Tahoma that slipped out of my mind. Quite embarrassing...\r\n\r\nJZ"
