    us to pay to protect ourselves. Slowly, but surely, the government is no longer
    protecting us. They are, instead, continuing to line the pockets of the corporate
    world.

    gov't has gone so far overboard in protecting copyright the past few years, with
    the DMCA and such. Then it comes out with the orphan works act, which I thought
    was a breath of fresh air (for them to recognize the problem of so many 20th century
    creative works being lost) until I actually read it.\r\n\r\nIt does nothing to
    clear up any of the rights on old material with uncertain ownership, and does
    plenty just to make creating new work a hassle."

    that's not right. There's only a limitation on damages if the defendant proves
    they performed and documented a qualifying search and was unable to locate & identify
    an owner (amongst several other conditions they must meet). The onus is on the
    defendant to prove this, otherwise there's no limitation on damages.\r\n\r\nIf
    they receive a claim of infringement notice *and* have already performed the above
    search plus other conditions, but then don't pay reasonable compensation or don't
    pay at all, the limitation is removed. If they didn't perform a qualifying search
    to start with, there's no limitation.\r\n\r\nProving you did an exhaustive search
    for the owner but couldn't find them is no easy task, and if the plaintiff has
    registered their works this then becomes practically impossible (\"You mean to
    say you did an exhaustive search, but didn't bother to check with the Copyright
    Office? Excuse me while I laugh, then sue your ass off.\"). As such, it will be
    cheaper to just pay the owner of the work in the first place rather than use it
    without authorisation and risk a lawsuit, hoping that your search stands up in
    court. Only if you can't find them *and can prove this* do you stand a chance
    of limitation, and even then it's a bit risky.\r\n \r\nRemember than if there's
    no limitation you can claim punitive damages and legal fees, so if someone's infringed
    your work you should be able to proceed without worrying about affording the costs.
    (If you win, they'll pay them.)\r\n\r\nOf course, you can only punish infringement
    if you discover it, but this proposed Act is certainly not a carte blanche for
    anyone to start abusing copyrighted works without fear of recrimination. It seems
    well written to me.\r\n\r\nWhat I can see this creating is a thriving 'copyright
    registration & search services' market, which would be no bad thing. Yes, it sucks
    that you have to register your work before it's fully protected, but this is *already
    the case*. (See Duncan Davidson's link above.) Anything that makes registration
    cheaper and easier is an improvement for the little guy as it'll put you in a
    much stronger position to protect your work by providing a greater certainty of
    winning any legal action. If these registration services combine with automatic
    violation scanning and billing (say, 3x usual cost for infringements), and on
    the other side provide a service for consumers to search for registered works,
    perhaps along with liability insurance if the service's search doesn't work, it
    may actually make you more money and offer better protection than the current
    law provides.\r\n\r\n[Note: I am not a lawyer either.]"

  body: "there's a lot of misinformation and hysteria floating around about this bill.
    \r\n\r\none would think, on the face of it, that the digital libertarians would
    be howling in protest, but here is a statement from the EFF (electronic frontier
    foundation) explaining why they think this bill is A GOOD THING:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2008/05/release-orphan-works\r\n\r\nMay
    16th, 2008\r\nRelease the Orphan Works! - by Corynne McSherry\r\nOrphan works
    legislation has returned to Congress, and the controversy surrounding the bill
    is just as heated as it was the last time around, in 2006. While a broad coalition
    of libraries, museums, independent filmmakers, public interest groups, and commercial
    arts organizations such as the RIAA and the MPAA back the bill, several prominent
    visual artists\u2019 organizations have been rallying their members in opposition.
    (For a discussion about orphan works, listen to the latest episode of EFF's Line
    Noise Podcast.)\r\n\r\nEFF strongly supports the legislation. Orphan works reform
    will dramatically expand the cultural commons, easing access to and use of a wealth
    of historical works that are presently locked away from public view. It should
    help create a system in which artists get paid, the public sees more works, and
    unlawful infringement continues to be punished. But the current legislation could
    be better, which is why we urge Congress to consider some small but significant
    changes that should alleviate the concerns of the visual arts community.\r\n\r\nFor
    those who haven\u2019t been following this battle, here\u2019s a quick primer
    on the problem that this legislation is trying to fix. Orphan works are those
    whose owner cannot be located. Others who would like to use and share these works
    may hesitate to do so out of fear that they could later be found liable for copyright
    infringement because they didn\u2019t get permission. Consider the following examples:\r\n\r\nA
    library has a vast archive of photos and music from the Depression Era. It would
    like to put this archive online, so people who aren\u2019t able to visit the library
    can use the works for pleasure, research, making art, etc. But the library is
    unable to locate owners for twenty percent of the works in the archive and is
    afraid that if it displays the works online without permission, it would be sued
    for copyright infringement if those owners emerged later.\r\nA documentarian stumbles
    upon an album full of photographs from the 1960s and is keenly inspired -- it's
    a treasure trove of local history, with photos of politicians, celebrities, and
    events. He asks if the thrift store can identify the person who brought the photo
    album in, but they simply don't remember. The documentarian wants to use some
    of the photos in a film, but he's aware that use of the images could infringe
    someone\u2019s copyright. By using the photos without permission, he could be
    opening himself up to thousands of dollars in damages, per photo, if the original
    photographer (or his or her estate, or any legitimate owner of the copyright)
    steps forward and sues him for copyright infringement.\r\nThe Orphan Works legislation
    would help resolve those fears and, in the process, encourage the display and
    re-use of these \u201Clost\u201D works. Under the proposed law, individuals who
    would like to use an orphan work must put diligent effort into searching for the
    owner of the copyright in the work, based in part on best practices to be outlined
    by the Registrar of Copyright. If that search comes up empty, they can use that
    work. And, if at some future time the copyright owner comes forward to demand
    payment, the legislation requires the second author to negotiate with that owner
    in good faith to determine reasonable compensation for the use, and promptly pay
    that compensation.\r\n\r\nAnd if the second author doesn't follow the new rules
    under the law and simply uses the work without making a diligent search? The copyright
    owner can sue them under the current rules and potentially obtain statutory damages
    of up to $150,000 per work -- just as they can now.\r\n\r\nCongress also plans
    to certify searchable databases for visual works like photographs, graphic arts,
    and textile designs that will collect information about works and contact information
    for the related copyright owners. There are not \u201Cformalities\u201D associated
    with these databases. No artist will be required to \u201Cregister\u201D with
    the databases, and failure to register will not result in it being considered
    \u201Corphaned.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe legislation prioritizes the search for the copyright
    owner. One of the proposed law's strengths is that terms like \u201Cdiligent effort\u201D
    and \u201Creasonable compensation\u201D would allow the courts, the Copyright
    Office, and owner and user communities to adapt the requirements over time and
    address the needs and concerns of a variety of artists and rights holders. By
    providing guidelines for what constitutes a \u201Cqualifying search,\u201D the
    legislation would have a positive effect on artists by helping to provide a legal
    standard that can be used to hold bad faith infringers accountable.\r\n\r\nWhile
    the legislation proposes changes that are sorely needed, some small but significant
    modifications would make the bill even more effective at enriching our culture.
    First, the copyright databases must be free for everyone to use. No one should
    be penalized for doing the right thing -- namely copyright owners for making themselves
    easier to contact about works and artists seeking copyright owners before making
    use of orphan works. Second, the notice of use requirement included in the House
    version of the legislation should be jettisoned\u2014it will add a layer of bureaucracy
    to the process, potentially invite \u201Ccopyright trolls\u201D and add an additional
    (possible prohibitive) expense to second users.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the Orphan
    Works legislation represents an extraordinary good faith effort on the part of
    the Copyright Office, technology policy groups, rights holders and our elected
    representatives. While some changes are in order, this legislation gives Congress
    a crucial opportunity to revise the copyright law enrich the community at large
    and providing avenues of revenue and inspiration to generations of artists to
    come. Here\u2019s hoping our elected officials take advantage of it!\r\n\r\n\r\n"
