body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nanyone have any advice on how to invoice internationally from the
  US as a sole proprietor? Been living in the States for a while now, but I still
  have some Euro clients left and I need to send a bill.\r\n\r\nHere I've just billed
  my freelance work with the W9/1099 system. Would that or something similar work
  when billing from California to  the Euro-zone? I'm not really looking to set up
  my own business or getting an accountant, as working under my own name is not my
  main focus right now.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
