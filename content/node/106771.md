body: "Get in on the FUN! Write any typeface of your liking a letter. A love letter,
  break up letter, an apology, secret admirer, a hate letter... it is up to you. It
  is simple, quick, and fun, so give it a go! This is for my senior degree project
  in graphic design at the University of the Arts. \r\n\r\nEXAMPLE LETTER:\r\nMy Dearest
  Gotham,\r\nWhat a beautiful typeface. You've always been able compliment so many
  things so very, very well. It pains me to say this, but I don't think I can ever
  use you ever again. Why's that? You ask me why? Well let me ask you in retort: Why
  do I grimace when I look at my old work? Why do I avert my eyes to the nearest crack
  in the cement when I see you on a billboard? Why did my temper rise when I saw you
  the other night, glued to the steps at the train station? I can't get you out of
  my head! All I want to do is use you, yet here you are associating yourself with
  these- these commoners! Peasants! Plebeians! By God, you're being misused, don't
  you see?! They're taking advantage of you dammit! Wake up!\r\nWAKE!\r\nUP!\r\nWell,
  Gotham. Our relationship was rather short-lived, but going any further this way
  would be ludicrous, suicidal even. I'm afraid, we'll have to part ways.\r\nFarewell.
  Until finals. \u2013Matt\r\n\r\nYou can send the letters to deartypeface@gmail.com
  also, pictures of yourselves attached would be wonderful!\r\nTHANKS EVERYONE, this
  is greatly appreciated!!"
