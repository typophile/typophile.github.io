  body: "Luke - that does make sense. \r\n\r\nWe did try an option with the 'l' being
    in line with the 'i', and wondered if being too technical and precise took away
    from the personality of it? Our initial thoughts were that the slight variation
    in angle alignment was a good thing. Maybe it is too distracting when not aligned?"

    would make it look great would be if you work it out from a grid of triangles,
