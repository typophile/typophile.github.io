body: "I am finally working on a project that justifies and needs dynamic custom font
  rendering on an HTML page. I am aware of CUfont (which is perhaps what Typophile
  is using for its headers?) and Typekit and remember from a post about a year or
  two ago that Google has an offering as well.\r\n\r\nCan anyone provide some links
  to some nice sample sites that are using these or other custom web font technologies?
  Also interested in perceived pros and cons between the different options from a
  technical, as well as cost perpective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPS - I must suck at using
  the search function here at Typophile because I have seen threads discussing this
  stuff before but could not surface anything using the search tool today."

    which one is the best off the top of my head and I am being lazy and not researching
    it. Anyway, I wanted to mention a cool tool for quickly figuring out what a web
    font is: http://chengyinliu.com/whatfont.html. '

  body: "Dynamic fonts (no Flash) is certainly the best option. Typekit is fine, but
    you make sure you pick something that also renders well under the worst conditions:
    Win XP. Many resellers have browser samples. \r\n\r\nFor good text type, a place
    to start is the masterful Webtype. There\u2019s also Fontfont, Typotheque\u2019s
    Fedra Screen, Ascender fonts and Adobe, along with [[http://typedia.com/blog/post/cure-for-the-common-webfont-part-2-alternatives-to-georgia/|this
    list]] and [[http://typedia.com/blog/post/cure-for-the-common-webfont-part-1-alternatives-to-arial-and-helvetica/|this]].\r\n\r\nFor
    display, the market is bigger, as the type designer doesn\u2019t need to make
    such a huge effort to render the fonts acceptable at larger sizes."
