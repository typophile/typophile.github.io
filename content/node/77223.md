  an old discussion. Years back I posted this ...\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/5563\r\nto
  the forum and frankly I have not had to deal with font issues for a while but recently
  an old client asked me to come in and install a new 27\"iMac. \r\n\r\nProblem is
  their old workstation and files have been touched by numerous users who all have
  different ideas of how to manage fonts and there are multiple copies of numerous
  fonts and at least three different font managers, Apples Fontbook, Fontexplorer,
  Suitcase, you name it. \r\n\r\nThey want auto activation, the current user has no
  leaning toward any one tool and does not seem inclined to tackle the issue of wading
  through multiple copies and organization, so it is up to me. I am re reading the
  Extensis \"best practices\" doc and this one I found googling. \r\nhttp://www.jklstudios.com/misc/osxfonts.html\r\n\r\nI
  am seeking info on what you all think is the best way to cleanup and organize for
  starters then what management tool to use. My gut feel is to gather the fonts (minus
  system) use Font Doctor to clean and then use a management tool. What are yours?\r\n"

  body: "You could look into a server based/browser based manager. That would allow
    users to still have system and some application fonts on their computers, but
    the main collection is all on one server. You can create specific user groups,
    manage licenses, etc.\r\n\r\nWhen I worked for a large studio we used Font Reserve
    (that had problems) and then switched to Universal Type Server (UTS) by Extensis.
    UTS seemed to perform well once you got used to it. Fonts with limited seat licenses
    can be restricted to specific groups. Font Reserve, also by Extensis,  I had problems
    with and wouldn't personally recommend.\r\n\r\nFor myself at home I use Font Explorer
    also."

  body: "Be careful with Font Doctor and all those fonts. An Extensis rep came to
    my former workplace and did a font migration of our Font Reserve server to a new
    one dedicated to UTS using Font Doctor. It was a complete disaster.\r\n\r\nAs
    a preface I should mention a big problem Font Reserve had. Font Reserve would
    allow users to manage fonts on their own computers as it well should. Only problem
    was it was also copying these fonts onto the server. I was not managing fonts
    when that was all set up, but started about the time we got UTS. So when I went
    to go through the new migrated collection instead of a couple thousand fonts there
    were close to 10.000. More than half were unlicensed fonts pulled from users computers
    that were either corrupt or PS orphans. Font Doctor also merged versions of fonts
    with the same family name even if they were from different sources. I spent way
    too much time fixing that mess. The only good out of all of that was I got a large
    studio to finally pay attention to licensing."

  body: "Thanks all, the more I read the more I think many of the issues are because
    they went to a new Mac that has to use 10.6., there are some font conflicts with
    OS 10.6. Mainly Helvetica, Helvetica Neue and some others.\r\n\r\nhas anyone read
    the two docs I mentioned? I am impressed with both but Kurt Lang's writeup is
    fairly new and complete, I am going to read it a second time today.\r\n\r\nStephen,
    This is a one graphic person shop so a font server is not needed, you FontDoctor
    story is scary but plan is to clone the users Mac with either Carbon Copy Cloner
    or Super Duper, clone their OS to another Mac and figure out the issues there
    first so I am not too worried. \r\n\r\nJamesM and Fontrasin, if you made me choose
    today I would go with Fontexplorerx, in fact they own that as well as Suitcase
    which I made them them stop using and move to Fontexplorerx a few years ago because
    of issues but I hear it has improved.\r\n\r\nTell thanks for the tip on FontCase,
    I love the company name! I googled it, reviews are good and a lot of people like
    it but auto activation was a big issue for him until recently. Also perhaps the
    biggest drawback is it appears they are a one man shop. The comments on the reviews
    keep pointing me back to Fontexplorerx.\r\n\r\n\"About Bohemian Coding\r\nAlthough
    I use the plural everywhere when I talk about Bohemian Coding, there's only one
    person in this company. Bohemian Coding was founded early 2008 in the Netherlands
    and is being run by Pieter Omvlee. We develop a number of great (at least in our
    opinion) shareware applications for Mac OS X and have many things planned for
    the future.\"\r\n\r\nBabs, stay tuned.....\r\n"

  body: "re FontCase: Although the program has been a one-person endeavor it has the
    backing of FontShop International nowadays (they assisted with the plug-ins if
    I recall correctly).\r\n\r\nMy program of choice is FontAgentPro, which is simple
    yet powerful and well maintained by the developer (example in case: they are quite
    forward with putting out new versions of plug-ins for new CS-versions, which counts
    in my view as a major plus). For a single person shop it is just the thing, imo.\r\n\r\nMy
    tip for your friend/client: Backup all the font files onto a external drive. Erase
    from the main computer. Install just the necessary ones and the ones that come
    with Adobe apps. Search and install fonts as and when needed, preferably OS-format.
    And always test before giving newly installed fonts the right to live on.\r\n\r\nI
    did the same a couple of years ago and it's been plain sailing ever since\u2026
    : )\r\n\r\n(I also have tried FontDoctor to sort out things, but it is \u2014
    or was \u2014 quite finicky about certain characteristics which I never could
    place in context; maybe a misplaced byte by a font designer or such\u2026 The
    result: loads of font files classified as Reject/Repair and such, blah!)"
