body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NewChapterLogo_6189.gif]\r\n\r\nSpecifically,
  the font on top that reads \"A New Chapter.\" I've tried using identifont and whatthefont
  but neither came up with an option that was even close. I'm beginning to think the
  original designer of the logo adjusted an existing font in Illustrator using outlines,
  but i'm hoping this isn't so. \r\n\r\nIt looks like it could be Century Gothic,
  or some other gothic, yet the capital \"E\" is really different. \r\n\r\nI'm redesigning
  this logo for a client and they want me to use the same font, yet they don't remember
  what it is, and I can't find it. :)\r\n\r\nThank you so much,\r\n\r\n-Piasaw"

    it <em>is</em> a font, it's likely to be plagiarized from Century Gothic, so best
    avoided.\r\n\r\nBut anyway: how hard is it to add a line to the \"C\"? In fact
    it would take less time than trying to find a font!\r\n\r\nAnd while you're at
    it, tighten the \"EW\".\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    horizontal bar to /C, pull down /H middle crossbar and done :)\r\nSome alternatives:
