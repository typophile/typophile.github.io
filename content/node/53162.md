  out this idea that grew out of a love for the lowercase g. No spacing, still working
  on proportions. Thoughts? Suggestions? In particular, I know there are a lot of
  squared/octagonal types out there, so any ideas on how to make this more unique/interesting
  would be helpful. Thanks!\r\n"

  body: I wonder what you mean with 'proportions' having a type made out of a hairline
    stroke.

  body: I hope I'm not 'killing your darlings' too much when I say I must disagree
    with you on the lowercase g. I think the lower bowl is set too high. Usually with
    double-story g's, the top of the lower bowl sits on (or just above / below) the
    baseline. In my opinion, it doesn't look right the way it is now. A bit like someone
    who's wearing his pants up under his armpits (Steve Urkel? ;)).

    but it's too distracting to be the default. I would also lose the hanging bottom
    vertical stroke on b and just let the vertical go right into the bowl.\r\n\r\nKeep
    at it!"

  body: "In the top sample, it doesn't look like Urkel anymore, but it's still off
    balance.\r\n\r\nI think the bottom loop could be enlarged a little bit (if you
    want to, since this will obviously change your descender length). The top bowl
    could be right, or slighty too large. You'll have to judge that when you change
    the bottom loop.\r\n\r\nOn the bottom 'gg' sample, I think they're both interesting.
    The first one would probably fit your current design best, although if you include
    such a 'g', I wouldn't throw away the double-story one (keep them both). \r\n\r\nThe
    second one looks more like an upright italic, which is in itself interesting to
    explore. But you'd have to carry that style through the entire design to make
    it work (I think). Maybe something for a different version belonging to the same
    family?"
