body: Looks like a wood type, highly condensed slab serif. Illustrator identifies
  the missing font as Collier Heading Plain. Searches yielded no result, so it doesn't
  look like it came from a major foundry.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/slab-serif_3898.jpg]

  body: "It looks like <strong>OPTI Carmi Five Caps</strong> by OPTI/Castcraft\r\nOPTI
    is a known font-forgery company and they almost always renamed the fonts they
    copied/digitized.\r\n\r\nIf you go to the OPTI Archive, Letter \"C\" here:\r\nhttp://opti.netii.net/fonts-c/index.htm\r\nyou
    can see the following note bellow \"Carmi Five Caps\":\r\n<blockquote>Original
    is Collier</blockquote>\r\nand this is further indication it's the font used on
    your sample ;)"

    body: "Yes, that would be Opti's version. I wonder why I could find no references
      to these versions of Collier in web searches? Thank you.\r\n\r\nCollier is no
      longer available from Letraset, apparently. It's as if the digital version has
      simply vanished."

    body: "Bingo! Thank you.\r\nUnfortunately it isn't in my system anymore for some
      reason. I didn't think to look through my Letraset floppies (most of them are
      factory Double-density and I can no longer read them anyway)."
