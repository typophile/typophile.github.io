I wanted to see if I could add a workable lower case, and try my hand at my own version of the upper case and symbols in a style that would make for a reductivist addition to my Seriatim family (now showing in the Sans Serif Critique Forum). <BR> <BR>The question behind the experiment is this: How much of each character can be removed while still allowing the human mind's phenomenon of &quot;gestalt recognition&quot; (recognizing the whole) to still resolve each individual character? <BR> <BR>The result seems to be very similar to a stencil font, but then it occurred to me that stencil fonts are another extension of this same question. In order to allow counters, etc., to remain in place in a stencil font, what parts of each character can be safely removed without compromising character recognition? Seriatim Gestalt simply takes it beyond the counters. <BR> <BR>As always, comments are appreciated and encouraged. <BR> <BR>David</div>

I'm not certain the components you are emphasizing are the essential ones (I'm thinking of the lc k &amp; a at the moment). some of the characters seem less reductivist than decoratively geometric (the lc p &amp; d, perhaps)</div>

The upper-case &quot;M&quot; had a similar genesis, as I tinkered with the angles and strokes of the glyph. <BR> <BR>PlainClothes: <BR>I agree that this experiemnt is far from complete.
