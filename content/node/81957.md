  body: Has a look of French Old Style about it especially the R but the S is too
    flat top and bottom. Did you see if it was carved or sandblasted?

  body: "What year was the stone made? That would help rule out newer type designs.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    do you have other samples? Other useful letters: J, U, K, W (sample has M, E,
    R, which are Serif Guide key letters)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
