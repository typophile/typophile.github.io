body: "Hello all:\r\n\r\nI am an author and about four months ago I downloaded a font
  called \"Mohammed\" from a free internet site to use as the title font for my new
  book \"The Sparrow's Blade.\" I recently had to install a new hard drive on my computer
  and completely forgot to back-up my font files and so now \"Mohammed\" is gone so
  work can't continue on the cover art. I have only a .jpg of the cover art but it
  does show the now missing font. I have searched the internet for two weeks now but
  to no avail...you folks are my last hope. I will attempt to post the .jpg of the
  cover here but if it doesn't work please go to my website at www.kennethrlewis.com
  and click on the page called \"books\" and you can see the cover art there...\"The
  Sparrow's Blade.\" And please be advised that on this cover for the words The Sparrow's
  Blade a red Mohammed font has been overlayed with another black Mohammed font but
  slightly off center for a shadow effect. The smaller words \"a novel\" are lower
  case black Mohammed. So, I know the name of my missing font but need to know where
  I can find it again? Thanks to all of you in advance, for your help.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/THE
  SPARROW'S BLADE_5552.font.JPG]"

    you too many places that have nothing to do with fonts. The only fonts with this
    name I could find at freebie sites I know look like pseudo-arabic, and not like
    your typeface at all.\r\n\r\nIf someone else doesn't solve this, I'd strongly
    recommend looking for a new typeface, and backing it up.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    looks like a free font. Perhaps losing it was a blessing in disguise. I'd suggest
    <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/macbeth/\" target=\"_blank\">Macbeth</a>
    as a better-drawn alternative.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    shouldn't squoosh it. At all.

  body: Yes it was a free font and I thought I downloaded it from a website called
    "1001 Free Fonts." Ok, look guys...I am obviously way out of my element here among
    the "font elite", but free, crude, and as squished as it is I really do like this
    font and more importantly, it works for the book cover. I will look at MacBeth,
    but I would appreciate it if some of you could keep looking, racking your brains,
    or whatever it is you do when you go on a font search. Anyhow, thanks for the
    responses so far...you typophiles are great folks!

    for a professional job. Take it as \"Lehrgeld\". This is the german word for money
    you have to spend for wrong decisions in the past, you did.\r\n\r\nDoes it smell
    too hard?\r\nSorry, but its the truth.\r\n\r\nGeorg\r\n"

  body: Kenneth - Aaron Beck's Warlock was the original for that font you used. He
    created it way (in computer time) back in 1994 and, until recently, offered it
    as $5 shareware. <a href="http://www.recordkeeper.com/products/fonts.html" target="_blank">The
    website</a> appears to mostly be defunct now in favor of Beck's <a href="http://www.awbeck.com/"

  body: "SUCCESS! I have the font again and refinements may now continue on my book's
    cover. My thanks to all of you, and especially to Angel 71. By the way, I did
    find out this font is shareware and I am doing my best to contact its creator
    and pay him his $6.00...don't know how I missed this the first time but I guess
    I was so excited about finding the \"perfect\" font I didn't bother to read the
    \"read me\" file attached with it. Thank you again for introducing me to the world
    of typophiles...I had no idea such an alternate universe existed! But I'm inspired
    now. Here's the title and a short synopsis to my next novel:\r\n\r\n        \"The
    Deadliest Font\" by Kenneth R. Lewis\r\n\r\n        When a gathering of typohiles
    at the annual\r\n        Stockholm Typophile Convention in Sweden leads\r\n        to
    contention between two rival groups...the Sans,\r\n        and the Serifs...over
    who designed the year's\r\n        prize winning font and will go home with the
    coveted\r\n        \"Typie\" Award, bickering leads to brain bashing murder\r\n
    \       in this fast paced tale of deadly secrets, intrigue, and \r\n        steamy
    typography inside one of the modern day world's\r\n        most misunderstood
    societies.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n"
