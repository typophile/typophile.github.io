  think this is FF Dax, but looking at it closely now, I see it's not -- for instance,
  \"e\" has a horizontal bar, while that of Dax is tilted."

  body: My, every other character is so bang on though I'd be inclined to think it's
    FF Dax with a customised 'e'. Don't know why you'd bother, but there you go. Thought
    it may have been an alt glyph, but I went through the Character Set for the Pro
    version and all the e's have the upward angled crossbar. Also downloaded a couple
    of PDFs from the tournament website, but the only font they had embedded in them
    was Myriad Pro. Maybe someone else has more of an idea?

    has a straight cross bar...\r\nWhy the Australian Open would use it is beyond
    me though. "

  body: "Actually, it's not just \"e\" that's different -- \"r\" is quite different,
    too, and even \"s\" appears not to be the same. Here is a comparison with FF Dax
    Pro Bold:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ausopen_4462.png]\r\n\r\nThe
    subhead is pure Myriad SemiCon SemiBold. But, does anyone else think \"Asia/Pacific\"
    is awkward and unnecessary -- instead of \"Asia-Pacific\" (as used by <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/default.stm\">BBC
    News</a>) or just \"Asia Pacific\" (as used by the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/pages/world/asia/index.html\">New
    York Times</a>)?"

  body: "Interesting, Seb. I hadn't heard of that little controversy before. Googlin'
    around I came across <a href=\"http://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/barmen.pdf\">this
    PDF</a> which shows the differences between FF Dax and UPS Sans.\r\n\r\nI took
    a screenshot of the table but I can't seem to insert images at the moment? Keep
    getting an Error. You can click on the link or take my word for it that with the
    lowercase there are only seven characters that differ between the two faces. The
    'r' isn't one of them which, as Henry points out, would tend to suggest that this
    sample isn't UPS Sans as the 'r' is not that of Dax. \r\n\r\nAnd regardless, I
    can only assume it's not UPS Sans as surely, like the <a href=\"http://fontfeed.com/archives/french-anti-piracy-organisation-uses-pirated-font-in-ownlogo/\">recent
    case with Bienvenue</a>, UPS Sans is a corporate face made for the exclusive use
    of UPS?\r\n\r\n"

    it to a printer, who then doesn't delete it, then that printer uses it in one
    of their own designs, not remembering where it originally came from.\r\n\r\n -
