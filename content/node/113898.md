  But we are reprinting this book and I need to know what font this is to recreate
  the cover.\r\n\r\nWe couldn't find it for building the website so we used Harrington:
  http://www.haikuwisdom.com/\r\n\r\nBut now we need the font for the second edition
  of the book. The original publisher is unavailable.\r\n\r\nAny help is greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank
  you,\r\nDiana aka Bonesai[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Capture_4912.PNG]"
