  body: i think what you have in the leftmost column is mostly correct. the only one
    i think is incorrect is the palochka (u+04CF), which is usually not cased and
    keeps the form of the I all the way through. so i <em>believe</em> that an italic
    I would be appropriate there. experts?

  body: "Thanks Paul.\r\n\r\nRe. the Palochka: My theory is that in this kind of scripty
    italic, a roman \"el\" represents the \"uncased\" version of \"I\" stylistically,
    i.e. a tall baseline-to-cap-height stroke. \r\n\r\nHowever, I could use the upper
    case italic \"I\" form, with four serifs, but make its stroke width much narrower,
    as I've done in the roman. In the italic, that wouldn't fit well with other characters,
    though. I wonder how the Palochka appears in text. Perhaps it's not an issue if
    it never appears in the middle of words. What language is it used in?"

  body: "On further investigation:\r\n\r\nUnicode Standard, version 5: <em>Palochka.
    U+04C0 \u201CI\u201D cyrillic letter palochka is used in Cyrillic orthographies
    for a number of Caucasian languages, such as Adyghe, Avar, Chechen, and Kabardian.
    The name palochka itself is based on the Russian word for \u201Cstick,\u201D referring
    to the shape of the letter. The glyph for palochka is usually indistinguishable
    from an uppercase Latin \u201CI\u201D or U+0406 \u201CI\u201D cyrillic capital
    letter byelorussian-ukrainian i; however, in some serifed fonts it may be displayed
    without serifs to make it more visually distinct. In use, palochka typically modifies
    the reading of a preceding letter, indicating that it is an ejective. The palochka
    is generally caseless and should retain its form even in lowercased Cyrillic text.
    However, there is some evidence of distinctive lowercase forms; for those instances,
    U+04CF cyrillic small letter palochka may be used. </em>\r\n\r\nHere is how the
    Palochka appears when the font has a standard Cyrillic character set, and the
    typographer improvises:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Pal1_6169.jpg]\r\n\r\nHere
    it is with my first attempt at proper unicode characters. The roman is acceptable,
    as per the Unicode chart specimen, but the italic is suspect:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Pal2_4601.jpg]\r\n\r\nFrom
    a typographic perspective, one should look for correspondences in the alphabet.\r\nHere
    is the Adyghe orthography:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Adyghe_5546.jpg]\r\n\r\nThere
    are two other characters with vertical strokes (other than those which incorporate
    the palotchka). The ef is not a good model in the italic, but the yeru is promising,
    and there is a pattern here, which the palotchka could fit into:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Pal3_6597.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
    practice referred to in the Unicode Standard, of a serifless stroke, should be
    discounted. Typographically, it is not enough like a letter, more like an accent
    or vertical bar. The \"exit serif\" in the italic serves to space the following
    character, and is not really something that can be dispensed with in this genre.\r\n\r\nTherefore,
    for consistency within Adyghe typography, the following lower case forms seem
    appropriate for this kind of serifed face:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Pal4_4388.jpg]\r\n\r\nThis
    design answers the question--if there are two characters in the alphabet with
    ascenders, why would they be given different serif treatments? (Which is what
    the Unicode chart specimen does, by following the ad hoc practice of using capital
    I.) And why should there not be consistency between the vertical strokes in ef,
    yeru, and palotchka?\r\n\r\nHowever, as the roman ef shown above is an alternate,
    and the default in my font is this more exotic, symmetrical form, the Unicode
    configuration of palotchka roman is OK:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Pal5_5887.jpg]\r\n\r\nBut
    this is tempting:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Pal6_5895.jpg]"

  body: "to me the \u044B looks as if it is missing the top right serif on the second
    element. this probably depends on what models you've been looking at, but i'd
    suspect that <em>most</em> Cyrillic typefaces would include the serif in this
    spot and if you follow this logic for a \"lowercase\" palochka, you would <em>essentially</em>
    arrive at a form similar to the uppercase I for the roman. adapting an italic
    version of this does seem that it would be a bit of a challenge. i think using
    an l-shaped palochka is a decent solution, but of course, i am no expert."

  body: "Thanks for your comments Andrijko.\r\n\r\nYes, the upper left serif of \"small
    ghe with upturn\" is unusual, but I think it is OK in the context of this 19th
    century style of Scotch Modern. I had observed that historically in Adolf Darre's
    specimen (Harkov, 1888) this character, and \"small em\", had a horizontal left
    serif, not a \"pot hook\" like the rest of the italic lower case. While I generally
    stuck closely to Darre's letterforms, for some reason I felt I would rather change
    this detail. It's vanity I suppose, that no matter how good the original, there
    is always something a redesigner thinks he can improve upon.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nmnrn_5353.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
