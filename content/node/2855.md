  body: My kids did something similar early on in their school career, in a medium
    known as &#34;Macaroni on cardboard&#34;. Only that was more technically complex,
    because the macaroni wasn&#39;t self-adhesive. <BR> <BR>

  body: Tanya, you are so right. <BR>I have dozens of sheets of the stuff, haven&#39;t
    used it for years, but now I know it was worth hanging on to. What a great retirement
    hobby this will make! I just checked my Letraset markers, and they still smell
    great, so looks like I&#39;m all set.
