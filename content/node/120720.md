body: "Hello all, \r\n\r\nI'm hoping that someone on here could give me a helping
  hand. I have been instructed to create some artwork for one of our clients utilising
  their existing styles and branding. However, they are requesting that we use certain
  fonts that we do not have and they are not permittted (quite rightly) to give us
  for this exercise. The fonts that they require us to use are:\r\n\r\nHelvetica Infant\r\nHelvetica
  Infant Hausa\r\nVagInfant Black\r\n\r\nObviously we need to buy these fonts but
  I can't find anywhere on the www that sells them. Even a quick google search doesn't
  give any results. Can anyone suggest where I might find these elusive fonts. Any
  help will be much appreciated.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "From the names, it looks like your client, or someone else, has created custom
    versions of Helvetica, Helvetica Hausa and VAG Rounded, and added \"Infant\" to
    their names. I suspect you won't find these specific fonts anywhere, only your
    client has them. Of course, you could acquire the source fonts, but you'd need
    to find out what alterations were made to them.\r\n\r\nDavid\r\n"

  body: "Four years ago someone asked about Helvetica Infant, but no one could link
    to it.\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/67600\r\n\r\nMy guess is that it's either
    a custom font as David suggested, or maybe an infant's clothing used helvetica
    and somehow \"helvetica\" and \"infant\" got accidentally combined in the product's
    title, similar to this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/helvetica_3835.jpg]"

    :). Trouble is the client is saying that they cannot supply them to me. So, for
    now anyway, I will have to use standard Helvetica & Vag rounded.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again!!\r\n"

  body: "Martin: \"Infant\" typefaces are text typefaces that are meant to structurally
    mimic the very earliest handwriting of small children. The theory is that by making
    the symbols close to the ideal shape they're taught to write (or rather, at that
    age, draw) it makes it easier for children to learn reading. (I don't have the
    exact studies at hand, but I seem to remember from elsewhere that this is not
    actually verifiable, and may even be outright false.)\r\n\r\nIf at all, they differ
    from \"schoolbook\" or \"primary\" typefaces by being even simpler in construction
    and, where possible, by being less cursive, and more constructed, just like a
    four year old will have more constructed writing than a seven year old. [[https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/sassoon/|Sassoon]],
    a typeface developed by a child psychologist, has an \"Infant\" version which
    is upright, has a low X-height (to clearly differentiate between the two cases),
    and is stripped down in a reductionist way, and a \"Primary\" version which has
    a slight slant, taller X-height and several other  more handwriting-mimicking
    features, like a looped k and a q with a tail."

  body: "> they cannot supply them to me\r\n\r\nCan they give you sample text set
    in those fonts? If not, they probably don't have the fonts but have just heard
    of them.\r\n\r\nIf they actually have the fonts (perhaps custom fonts), you could
    prepare layouts on your own computer and then switch fonts using their computer
    (assuming they have the right software). Or just tell them the fonts can't be
    purchased anywhere.\r\n\r\n"

    though to not be able to share fonts with a design studio if those fonts can't
    be purchased anywhere else. I understand the design studio isn't allowed to use
    these fonts for other projects, but how are you supposed to work on a design when
    you have no access to the correct fonts? Replacing the font on an other computer
    isn't a great solution as you may experience some shifts in the text. Or are the
    horizontal metrics the same?"
