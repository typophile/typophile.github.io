  body: My guess is this is a persons handwriting that has been converted to type.
    There is a company that will do it for something like $6 or $9. Someone will chime
    in with details.

  body: "Nike, \r\n\r\nYour reasons are understandable, and you may be right that
    it is a professional script design, but for what it's worth, it isn't one that
    I have collected, and Script fonts are my specialty.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to think
    that this is a personal font, but made by someone who took the trouble to do it
    right. I don't think it is a commercially available script font. \r\n\r\nIf we
    find out otherwise, I want to add it to the Script Font ID Guide.\r\n\r\n- Mike
