		<div class="commentbody">I&#39;m very interested and look forward to seeing where you take the lowercase. I enjoy both versions of what has been shown as I can see a serif/semi-serf and a sans-serif version, as well as perhaps a wider version. Once set at a text size, it might work better a bit wider. &#40;?&#41; I can understand why some would consider this a display face, it goes against what has become expected and what we are used to using for text. It would be interesting to try this for text in small amounts for flavor. But I want you to convince us &#40;me&#41; that it can be used for longer texts. Perhaps once you are finished, or closer, you could set a page and create a pdf. </div>

Somewhat belatedly, but justified by my Saxon descent ;-) How may I obtain a file of the Pseudo Sachsen font, which (as I understand) has been ready for some time? Strictly for my private projects, of course.
