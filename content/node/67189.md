    boxes filed with day-to-day items (letters, watches, invoices, photos, etc) from
    various stages in his life. Very cool. \r\nThere was even the hand written lyrics
    to Heroin by the Velvet Underground (Lou Reed gave them to him apparently).\r\n\r\nThe
    one that sticks in my mind (because of the ridiculous price) was an invoice for
    an NY ad agency, 2 illustrations for $7 and some change. It was written on a typewriter.
    \r\n\r\nI'm sure he would have done some design work, but largely as an adjunct
    to his illustration. He may even have done some store front window displays?  Hmmm."
