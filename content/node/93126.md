  Corp.'s Steve Matteson for making all ten variants of it, and to thank Google for
  commissioning it and making it available for free. It's friendly but professional,
  and I hope that one day it replaces Arial and others as the web's default sans.\r\n\r\nThere,
  now at least I've paid a compliment, if not any money."
