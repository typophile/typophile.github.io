  am having a hard time finding the correct fonts to use.  Here's a picture of the
  license plates in question (the specific type I'm looking at recreating is the yellow
  one).  Can anyone help me out with both the font for the large characters and the
  small type that reads \"67-Colombia-69\"?  Thanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Mystery
