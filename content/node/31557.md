body: "Hi folks,\r\nThis sample shows what at first seems to be a hand-printed ad,
  but closer inspection shows that it is a font with 2 or 3 variations of most letters
  (some might be part of ligatures). This screams OpenType, but so far the only hand-printing
  font I know like this is <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/madtype/casino-hand/\">Casino
  Hand</a> by Matt Desmond. The thing that makes this work so well is that the lettering
  looks so natural.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone recognize it? I wonder if the 'cheap, easy-to-make
  hand-printed fonts' have just moved into the world of OpenType.\r\n\r\nThanks, \r\n-
  Mike"

  body: I'm far too much of a neophyte to be able to ID this ... but I do know that
    the boys at <a href="http://www.muccatypo.com">MuccaTypo</a> did a similar OpenType
    font (which is, of course, not listed on their very aesthetic but largely unhelpful
    website).

  body: "Thanks David, for alerting me to a new foundry, but in looking at their planned
    font offerings, there's nothing similar to this casual script printing style.
    There are an increasing number of OpenType fonts coming on the market, but I'm
    looking for something besides Casino Hand that looks hand-made, and contemporary,
    like the sample.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "This is mailnly to bump this one back into visibility. I found a similar-looking
    font in Chank's GFY Handwriting Fontpak, called <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/chank/gfy-handwriting-fontpak/gfyjeanna-regular/\">GFYJeanna</a>,
    which comes in an OpenType version, but the character maps give little idea of
    more than a few optional characters. It's only similar stylistically -- no letters
    are identical to my sample. I'm hoping someone knows of another casual OpenType
    hand-printed font.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
