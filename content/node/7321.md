    get it. Is jalcomulco hand drawn? What does the tagline say?

    i was trying to do something &#34;dirty but nice&#34; as some nature sports...  <BR>the
    tag line says &#34;adventure paradise&#34; and the graphic is a kind of semi-abstract
    draw for a prehispanic jar fragment &#40;discovered while digging the land to
    build a camp&#41; or can be also a drum &#40;drums are played in many events during
    camp activities&#41; or can also decorated rock... the wave can represent the
    river... in fact i want to create a multi-meaning simbol that catches the spirit:
    &#34;natural, cultural and etnhic beautiful&#34;  <BR>Thanx a lot.'

  body: 'Hola Pablo: <BR>I personally don&#39;t like the type very much. It looks
    badly rendered rather than distorted on purpose, and i think this will be more
    the case the smaller you go. I would try with a &#34;normal&#34; font, or try
    to express the roughness in some other way, like a hand-drawn font. <BR> <BR>Gusto
    ver otro mexicano por aca!'

    instead of doing detailed &#34;noise&#34; distortions. <BR> <BR>hhp'

    the &#34;c&#34;s and one of the &#34;o&#34;s different than the other, to make
    it more handwriting-like. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: Pablo why not use an actual photo of a shard of pottery. Creating more of
    a corporate Id than just a logo. When your logo is shown, a picture accompanies
    it with a Mexican symbol photographed.

  body: Pablo, <BR>your first icon is by far the best, looks earthy and speaks culture
    and adventure to me. <BR>Also, i don&#39;t find your initial approach on the type
    that bad. As others suggested, try to experiment with other techniques in photoshop
    to avoid the impression of a bad rendering.
