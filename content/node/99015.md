  body: "Hrant, this is from Harold Lohner\u2019s website:\r\n<em>I advertise my computer
    fonts as \"original\" because I make all the digital fonts myself by hand. Throughout
    my website and other materials, I am quite clear about the inspirations for my
    fonts, which may be the earlier creations of others. To me, this sort of \"learned
    borrowing\" is an important aspect of the history and practice of art. It is not
    my intention to rip-off the work of any individual or company; I put my own stamp
    on my work and fully acknowledge the artists and designers in whose shadows I
    stand.</em>\r\nPlease don\u2019t discredit other people\u2019s work unless you
    have proof it\u2019s not original."

  body: "You might be right. But looking at the glyphs above, and Lohner's \u0153uvre
    in general, do you think \"Pharmacy was inspired by the sign at a local (Albany,
    NY) drugstore\" explains the results to satisfaction? Look at that \"a\".\r\n\r\nThe
    desirability of Proof does not preclude letting one's instincts smell something
    funny, even if sometimes the scent is off.\r\n\r\nSee: http://typophile.com/node/98598\r\n\r\nBTW
    if I said \"I am Nefertiti, queen of Egypt\" would be believe me?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    that came to my mind seems to be a match.\r\nPharmacy:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Pharmacy_5151.png]\r\nITC
