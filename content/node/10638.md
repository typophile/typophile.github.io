  body: 'These are very interesting, Hrant. I can certainly see the great disparity
    in gain between the heavy inking on antique paper of the <i>Emblems</i> and the
    finer impression on calendared paper from Big Red. All I can say at this point
    is that I would also not specify Linotype metal Electra for a book to be printed
    on very smooth paper -- it was obviously possible for the original Electra to
    be too dazzling also. <BR> <BR>Slight tangent: Here is an interesting early statement
    from Dwiggins, from <i>Layout in Advertising</i> &#40;1928&#41;:  <BR> <BR>&#34;But
    as a matter of fact, printing type on antique-surfaced paper seems to be something
    of a stumbling-block to the modern craft. The fine points of the time-honored
    process have been forgotten in learning &#40;and learning very thoroughly&#41;
    an entirely different trade -- <i>viz.,</i> the trade of printing half-tones.
    . . . If [the designer] is a stickler for good workmanship, he will demand more
    impression than is compatible with the ideals of most pressmen; and an inking
    -- and an ink -- that will leave crisp, solid inlays with sharp edges printed
    from the <i>face</i> of the type, not from its shoulder.&#34; <BR> <BR>I have
    no personal experience printing letterpress, so I am not sure what to make of
    this declaration. Gerald may find it provocative. <BR> <BR>He goes on in this
    section to say that Antique and English Finish &#40;what we would probably call
    Vellum and Wove today&#41; are &#34;essentially <i>type</i> surfaces,&#34; while
    Machine Finish and Sized &amp; Super-calendered &#40;Smooth and Super-Smooth or
    Plate&#41; are &#34;general utility <i>half-tone</i> papers.&#34; And then: &#34;It
    is interesting to note how the <i>picture,</i> exclusively, has set the pace in
    all this career after smoother surfaces. Type has had to trail along as best it
    could.&#34; [all WAD&#39;s italics] <BR> <BR>He also mentions briefly the development
    of coated papers as the current evolution in this search for ever greater polish
    and smoothness. He concludes the section with &#34;The problem of assembling type
    and pictures on half-tone papers has not yet begun to be solved. The solution
    waits, first, for new styles of type letters; and after that for a sharp break
    with the traditions of the past.&#34; <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t say for certain what
    he might have meant exactly, but Hrant, I thought you&#39;d find this last statement
    fascinating. <BR> <BR>I suppose it would be reasonable to assume that Electra
    &#40;begun a few years later&#41; represented some of Dwiggins&#39;s thoughts
    along the lines of a new style of type letters for printing on half-tone papers,
    which lends credence to the thrust of Gerald&#39;s arguments, as I understand
    them. If this was part of Dwiggins&#39;s goal, then I confess that I am ambivalent
    about his success toward this particular end. Sharpness? certainly; Lightness?
    maybe; High contrast? no. <BR> <BR>It is interesting to note, however, that Dwiggins
    himself &#40;as far as I know&#41; did not specify any jobs to be printed with
    Electra on machine finish or s&amp;sc papers -- continuing to prefer antique and
    english finished stocks. <BR> <BR>-- K.'

  body: Kent <BR> <BR>I suspect this may very well be a key to Electra. With the standardization
    of photoengraving in the very late nineteenth century the problem of the photograph
    was of great concern. With the letterpress process, halftones cannot be printed
    the same as type. They need a very smooth and unresilient paper. Any kind of overinking
    and the tonal quality is lost. Impression has to be exactingly uniform and quite
    light compared to type. Beatrice Warde&#39;s study concerning the differences
    between the letterpress process and the offset process on various kinds of substrates
    would also be revealing here. Many of the old standby typefaces did not perform
    well on the kind of paper required for halftones.

  body: 'Kent <BR> <BR>One other thing here that may or may not shed some light...
    It would probably have been quite rare for bookwork to have been printed directly
    from the Linotype castings. I doubt Big Red was printed from the castings. Linotype
    metal and Monotype metal were far too soft to withstand such repeated impression.
    Monotype, in fact, was not initially intended for printing. At the time, these
    casting processes were used for the initial composition. Once proofed and okayed,
    a paper mould of the form would be made and from this a stereotype was cast. The
    printing would be done from the stereotype. At a later point &#40;when stereotype
    fell out of practice&#41;, or in less moneyied shops, they would probably have
    just taken a proof and made a copper photoengraving and would have printed from
    this. I would suspect you would see more of a bolder character from any printing
    done directly from the Linotype metal, which would grow bolder &#40;or conversely,
    weaker, with heavier inking to compensate&#41; as the metal face wore down during
    the printing process. '

    but I think chances are he would have approved of the digital <i>for 14 point
    usage</i>. <BR>3&#41; The difference between the 14 and the even the 12 is large.
    The digital should not be used for smaller sizes, unless there&#39;s a lot of
    gain &#40;and it&#39;s tracked looser&#41;. Even then the x-height might be too
    small. &#40;BTW, Linotype had two versions for each size: long and short descenders.
    Although I didn&#39;t see a long for the 14 in the Supplement.&#41; <BR> <BR>--
    <BR> <BR>Also, here are some numbers &#40;derived from the alphabet-length specs
    in the Supplement&#41; that show how much wider each cut was compared to the 14:
    <BR>7 : 16.25% <BR>8 : 13.75% <BR>9 : 13.75% <BR>10 : 9.37% <BR>11 : 7.39% <BR>12

    compared to other faces that were quite &#34;light&#34; in color, such as Centaur,

    put up here, that there was metal flashing between some of the characters. Flashing
    is a leakage between the matrices as the result of dirt or misalignment. I&#39;d

    the thinner versions&#41; best for captions etc because they are much less interfering

    printing with wood engravings which carry a tremendous amount of weight. There

    his career in favor of engraved illustrations &#40;rather than photos or halftoned
    illustrations&#41; as the best complement in book texts because they are of the
    same nature as type; halftones are too gray in character. I suppose, then, that
    you are right that an appropriate type to match up with halftones would need to
    be lighter in overall color.  <BR> <BR>Lighter perhaps, but so contrasty? It still
    just doesn&#39;t jibe for me with his comment about being drawn to avoid the extremes
    of thick and thin usually seen in modern style typefaces. In this way, I would

  body: Kent <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t see Electra as all that contrasty. Compared to Joanna
    sure, but the latter is more of the oldstyle approach to letterpress design. Electra
    certainly was not a Modern typeface design in the historical sense. There is certainly
    something else going on there. Moderns also required a fairly smooth paper and
    there was initially a reaction in opposition to them because of this. <BR> <BR>I
    believe that the contrasts built into Electra serve a technical purpose. If Hrant
    would put up the 96 point, the Linotype specimen, &#40;hint, hint&#41; along with
    the similar sized digital, you will seem some interesting characteristics to the
    original that would more have served the face as a letterpress face. I suspect
    these were &#34;knowingly&#34; altered by the digital designers.

    of 20th century typefaces until the optical &amp; digital eras.  <BR> <BR>It says
    that Zapf dealt with the old system, in which three sizes would be designed, and
    adjustments made in the rest. If TYPOFILE could ask Zapf about this issue of adjusting
    type weights and widths point size by point size, I bet the answer would be fascinating.
    <BR>  <BR>In Open Type could the shifts in weight with point size be built in

    may have wanted a very clean and new look, but he carefully adjusted the weights.
    The 12 point is noticably heavier than the 14 point basis &#40;according to Hrant&#41;
    for the digital and the 10 point more so, in Hrant&#39;s scans.  '

    read out at 84 or 96pt, if I remember correctly, and DT was adjusted to 119 points
    to match. DD, the digital display, is actually slightly smaller in height than
    DT when set to the same size. <BR> <BR>The actual L60 is a bit finer in some areas
    than the DT as it shows here. Since L60 was well printed, I believe the swelling

    is not an indication of ink gather.

    includes a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/features_pt.htm#size">&#60;size&#62;</a>
    feature, registered by Adobe. This feature does not apply any transformations
    to fonts that contain it, but it enables a font to be linked to a specific point
    size or range of point sizes. To date, there are no applications that support
    this, but the idea is that when the user selects a font that includes this feature
    and sets the type size to e.g. 7pt, the appropriate font from the family will
    automatically be used. <BR> <BR>I met a very interesting man from Berlin at the
    TypoTechnica event in Heidelberg last month. He has made a study of the ways in
    which types were adapted to different sizes in different periods and technologies,
    and has identified ten principles for optimising type for different sizes. He
    showed me samples of a custom version of Aldus, optimised for 6-12pt. The 6 and
    12 point sizes were manually designed, and the intermediate sizes were interpolated.
    Adobe, of course, tried in some of their Multiple Master fonts to interpolate
    between a much greater range of sizes &#40;between 6pt and 72pt&#41;. I tend to
    agree with my German colleague that interpolation for optimised sizes only works
    across a smaller range of sizes.

    due: Dwiggins would not have been responsible for any of the adjustments you notice.
    At that time, these optical adjustments were all performed as a matter of course
    by Linotype. The man most responsible would have been the unsung hero of Linotype&#39;s
    drawing office, Nils Larson. There were separate drawings made by hand for each
    character of each size of each design. When Larson retired in 1959, a commemorative

  body: 'Okay, here&#39;s the report I promised. There are still gaps in some of the
    details, but I think this provides the broad strokes of the provenance of the
    Linotype outlines.  <BR> <BR>The primary sources for this research are conversations
    with Mike Parker and Matthew Carter, augmented by the timeline given on the Linotype
    Library website. For those who don&#39;t know: Mike was Director of Typographic
    Development at Mergenthaler Linotype Co. &#40;MLCo&#41; from 1959 to 1981. He
    succeeded Jackson Burke, who in turn succeeded Chauncey H. Griffith. Matthew worked
    with Mike at Linotype from 1965 until 1981, when they both left to co-found Bitstream
    &#40;with Cherie Cone and Rob Friedman&#41;.  <BR> <BR>&#42; &#42; &#42; &#42;
    &#42; <BR> <BR>In 1958, Mergenthaler Linotype Co. introduced the Linofilm phototypesetting
    system. The original Linotype production drawings were used to convert the designs
    to film. The Linofilm system, however, was limited to an 18-unit em, so the original
    drawings had to be adapted to this system. In many cases, this may have been a
    simple matter of marking new side-bearings on existing drawings, but some faces
    may have had characters redrawn, as well. Also, new drawings would usually have
    been made for characters that would benefit from the absence of kerning and duplexing
    constraints -- characters like the &#39;f&#39;, as well as many italic designs.
    <BR> <BR>In a process which is somewhat analogous to the metal process of Drawings
    -&#62; Brasses -&#62; Punches -&#62; Matrices, the drawings were used as patterns
    to cut friskets from rubylith; these friskets were photographically reduced to
    create glass &#34;plaques;&#34; the plaques were assembled into an oversized version
    of the Linofilm grid; and this array was used to produce the Linofilm film master.
    <BR> <BR>The Linofilm optical system was only capable of enlarging to 200%, so
    three grids were needed to cover the size range: one for 6-12, one for 12-24,
    and one for 18-36. The master drawings used were usually 8, 12, and 18 point,
    but there may have been exceptions. Later the V-I-P system was capable of covering
    a wider range with a single master and the middle, 12-point size became the default
    master. <BR> <BR>At some point in the late 1960s or early 1970s, MLCo began converting
    the fonts into digital data. The friskets were scanned on a drum scanner and the
    data was &#34;quantized&#34; on a main-frame and converted into fonts for the
    Linotron machines. Linotrons set encoded data as vertical stripes, but it is unclear
    whether this data was initially stored as such or as outlines. The Linotron 202,
    introduced in 1978, is mentioned as the first model to store the font data as
    outline vectors. I could not determine what format these vectors were encoded
    in, but they may very well <i>not</i> have been Bezier splines. <BR> <BR>In 1987,
    Linotype licensed its typeface library to the fledgling Adobe and the fonts were
    converted into the now-familiar Type 1 Postscript format. Type 1 was a proprietary
    format until 1989 or 90, so I would think that Adobe did the conversion themselves,
    but a recent Linotype catalog indicates that the fonts were digitized by Linotype.
    &#40;This could, of course, simply refer to the original digitization from the
    friskets back in the 70s.&#41; <BR> <BR>&#42; &#42; &#42; &#42; &#42; <BR> <BR>When
    the American Linotype offices were closed down for good in the late 1980s, Mike
    Parker managed to save some of the materials from destruction. There was a complete
    set of Linotype matrices which had been used by the MLCo. in-house typesetting
    department. He got these donated to RIT. Later these went to the Smithsonian Institute,
    where they are stored off-site to this day. I don&#39;t know what happened to
    the brasses. The production drawings were initially put into storage and later
    offered to the Smithsonian. The Smithsonian was reluctant to take them because
    of concerns about mold contamination. So Parker found a home for these with the
    Museum of Printing in North Andover, MA. <BR> <BR>&#42; &#42; &#42; &#42; &#42;
    <BR> <BR>Matthew said that in the early days of photocomp and offset printing,
    the results were really terrible. Over time there was some improvement. Although
    apparently there was some speculation that the font companies went back and added
    weight to the characters, Matthew said this is baloney. Instead, plate-makers
    and printers probably just learned how to use the photo output better.  <BR> <BR>Faced
    with the daunting task of converting the metal library to photocomp back in the
    late 50s, the MLCo Drawing and Matrix Manufacturing departments must have felt
    that it would be impossible to redraw every single character to compensate for
    the difference in gain -- not and get the Linofilm system to market in a timely
    fashion. Matthew said, &#34;Having just done that to one family, I cannot see
    how it could ever have been accomplished at the time for the entire library.&#34;
    He is referring here to his recent reworking of Linotype Monticello for the Princeton
    University Press.  <BR> <BR>Also in reference to that project, he told me, &#34;As
    I discovered with Monticello, the work of improving the photocomp data until it
    looks reasonable is really daunting. The digital font will never look exactly
    like the hot-metal face printed by letterpress, but at least it will not be as
    anaemic as digital data made straight from the hot-metal drawings.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#42;

    to above. It is quite small -- 4.5x7&#34;, 36 pages. Nicely set in 10 pt Monticello.
    There are seven short tributes from Walter Tracy, R. Ruzicka, P.J. Conkwright,
    Hermann Zapf, Paul Bennett, Jackson Burke, and James Darley. All, save Burke&#39;s,
    are average about 500 words. There are also five pages listing the typefaces Larson
    had a hand in. <BR> <BR>You won&#39;t find any magic formulas. <BR> <BR>That &#34;eye
    is the final arbiter&#34; statement is Griffith&#39;s. Tracy was just quoting
    CHG. This was a common Griffithism.  <BR> <BR>Larson&#39;s first job was as an
    apprentice in a brass foundry and machine shop in Sweden. He started at Mergenthaler
    as a clerk in the matrix department. Later he started training in the letter-drawing
    department. He took night classes in art and architectural design. Larson advanced
    through the drawing office to eventually become the supervisor. He basically came
    up under Griffith and would have absorbed a lot of his knowledge from CHG&#39;s
    methods. <BR> <BR>Only after the pilot size of a typeface was completed and approved
    for all technical details of shape and proportion and fitting, then the remaining
    sizes of the series would be graded for correct optical proportion. From Burke&#39;s
    tribute:  <BR> <BR>&#34;In order that a type design may pervade a series, optical
    illusions need to be effected. Six point type looks like its related twelve point
    only because it is carefully drawn to be different. It is proportionately wider,
    heavier, squarer and more open. It is Larson&#39;s trained eye which establishes
    how much wider, heavier, squarer and more open. There is no formula which serves
    to shepherd a design through all these permutations.&#34; <BR> <BR>There wasn&#39;t
    a formula, but that doesn&#39;t mean that everything was done arbitrarily or willy-nilly.
    I would guess that Larson &#40;and Griff&#41; had some rules of thumb in their
    heads. Once the grading of the essential dimensions of a design was determined,
    the figures were recorded on a graph. This became the master blueprint for that
    particular typeface. But the graph would vary by design. The point is that the
    graph recorded what the eye determined, not the other way around. That was Griff&#39;s
    stance on fitting as well. &#34;The eye is the final arbiter. . .&#34; I know,
    it frustrates the hell out of you. &#40;It frustrated Dwiggins somewhat too, as
    he kept looking for a formula for fitting. I believe Tracy&#39;s method may have
    been based on Dwiggins&#39;s search.&#41; <BR> <BR>One could probably deduce much
    of those rules of thumb by analyzing different designs in the Linotype line. When
    I&#39;m able to get over to the Museum of Printing I hope to take a closer look
    at this matter. <BR> <BR>Is that <i>Colophon</i> of yours the new series, Vol
    I, Number 1, Summer 1935? In a letter from June 20, 1935, Dwig writes, &#34;<i>Emblems
    and Electra</i> is going to be pretty swank. It will be interesting to see how
    the printing trade takes it. My bet is that it will be good merchandising. The
    <i>Colophon</i> use of Electra will be a good christening, I think. The type looks
    fine in the pages we have got so far.&#34; The two publications were contemporary.  <BR>
    <BR>The <i>Emblems</i> is set in twelve point, the pilot size. Electra was not
    released yet, but the pilot was completed and the series was being graded. Obviously,
    the eleven was also done, since <i>The Colophon</i> used it. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
    at a loss to explain the degree of ragged baseline in <i>Emblems</i> related to
    the other examples. But in general, the movement of the bottom overshoot on the
    rounds and pointeds as one traverses the different sizes was very likely another
    dimension that was graded for optical adjustment by size. Somewhere I recall reading
    Harry Carter discussing some general figures for overshoot -- maybe in the Fournier;
    I&#39;ll have to try to dig that up some day. <BR> <BR>-- Kent. <BR>'

    say this limits the effectiveness of the design across the whole range of sizes?
    Isn&#39;t it better to design with more than one size in mind &#40;like some masters

    make it work well at all sizes. They must have trusted him. JvK would have killed
    him. <BR> <BR>&#62;&#62; &#34;It is Larson&#39;s trained eye which establishes

    buy this for a second. It&#39;s just romanticism. The mysterious eye &#40;which
    it is&#41; is much sexier than plain thought. <BR> <BR>But let me be clear: I&#39;m
    all for the eye deciding what the numbers are - no doubt about that. And I don&#39;t
    pretend it&#39;s worth devising a Magic Formula that accomodates everything &#40;even
    if that&#39;s possible&#41;. What I&#39;m saying is that math was -and is- used
    a lot, even by those who seem to see benefit in denying it. And the clues are
    everywhere. The clean interpolation in Falcon for example. I will find more. <BR>
    <BR>&#62; &#34;The eye is the final arbiter. . .&#34; <BR> <BR>No, and even Griffith
    couldn&#39;t really have believed that - the evidence is there. The eye and math
    work in parallel. In fact, the straight interpolation in Falcon is an indication
    of <i>too much</i> reliance on math at the expense of the eye &#40;which is known
    to be non-linear&#41; on the part of Linotype. ATF had better math. <BR> <BR>&#62;
    it frustrates the hell out of you. <BR> <BR>I can see how it would have frustrated
    Dwiggins, but I have no boss to tell me what fonts not to make, so in my case
    it&#39;s just disappointment: that people I otherwise admire have a coping mechanism
    preventing candor. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>My Colophon is Spring &#39;38, V3#2. <BR>I

    throughout the run. The goal of a fine printer is to maintain consistency but
    there will be some variation. In some cases, with bad presswork, a lot of it.
    And that particular showing of the Emblems... might have been an errant copy that

    the same. At the moment, it is a little difficult to add &#60;size&#62; information
    to a font, as the feature utilises the GPOS table in an unorthodox way &#40;basically,
    it uses the table to store a string of bits that provide information to an application
    but do not constitute a normal GPOS lookup&#41;. I have not experimented with
    the Adobe FDK or FontLab in this regard, but since I used VOLT for all my OT development
    I would probably need to post-process fonts with <a href="http://www.letterror.com/code/ttx/index.html">TTX</a>

    And I don&#39;t think Griffith would either. They clearly used plenty of math.
    But they didn&#39;t have a formula. Just because a certain proportion or interpolation
    worked in one instance, doesn&#39;t mean that it would work in the next instance.
    Which is why a trained eye is needed to judge the results. Hence Griffith&#39;s
    statement. I think you take read too much into it. &#34;The eye is the final arbiter&#34;
    doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t measure, multiply, and cogitate. It just means
    that when all is said and done, you &#42;look&#42; at it and decide. Use the math,
    but trust your eyes. <BR> <BR>In that Falcon memo, by the way, the very next sentence
    following that &#34;arbiter&#34; statement, and which Tracy did not include in
    his quotation, is &#34;Just how accurate is the eye and whose eye is a safe and
    acceptable standard, is an open question that can be answered -- by whom?&#34;
    <BR> <BR>The Falcon grading is by and large mostly linear, but it is not &#42;strictly&#42;
    linear. The advance proof &#40;the final proof made of each size of each design,
    which becomes the official record of the font&#41; lists several key measurements
    for a given font. Those that bear most on this discussion are the face height
    &#40;from top of ascenders down to the bottom of descenders&#41;, the height of
    the capital H, and the length of the lowercase alphabet.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve put
    together a graph of these three features over the range from 6- to 12-point Falcon.
    In creating my graph, I used a convenient scale for the beginning and end points
    of the lc alphabet line; then I placed the end points of the other two in the
    same places and located the in-between points proportionally. So there are three
    completely different scales. My purpose was to be able to overlay the lines so
    that we could compare their degrees of linearity. I&#39;m sure someone more mathematically
    inclined than I will tell us if my method is flawed. The figures are included
    in my graphic for you to do your own analysis, if you wish.  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/7859.gif"
    alt="Falcon Linearity"> <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t have an explanation for the divergences
    in the upper range. You can see by the number of decimal places they bothered
    to measure that the processes were geared for precision machining, so I don&#39;t
    think you can explain them away as some sort of manufacturing errors. <BR> <BR>Make
    of this what you will. <BR> <BR><i>&#62;that people I otherwise admire have a
    coping mechanism preventing candor.</i> <BR> <BR>Do you mean Griffith? I don&#39;t
    think he was trying to hide anything. That &#34;romanticism&#34; about Larson
    was Burke, remember, not Griffith. I think the thing preventing candor is he&#39;s
    dead -- he can&#39;t join the forum and explain it all for you. You&#39;re going
    to have to do some digging for this stuff. <BR> <BR>Maybe this will help. In a
    footnote appended to one of WAD&#39;s letters regarding Falcon, Griffith offers
    this explanation of something Dwiggins makes reference to:  <BR> <BR>&#34;&#42;
    By &#39;graph&#39; is meant a method devised by me for charting and recording
    the predetermined visual proportions and basic dimensional data in relation to
    each point size of a series, in this case 6- to 11- point, inclusive, above mentioned,
    predicated on the norms established for the pilot 12-point size. The proportions
    of height and width and the thickness of stems and hairlines in each size are
    thus determined in advance of and as a basis for subsequent development of the
    indicated point sizes required for the series. Dimensional data on the graph is
    a recording of the visual conception of relative proportion. Visual conception
    is given a graphic test by cutting experimental characters of each size. If found
    correct, the standard list of trial characters, &#39;E H M O R T W e f h j m n
    o p&#39; are cut in each size as a further test. After final approval of these,
    the letter draughtsmen proceed with letter drawings for each of the point sizes
    in the series. N.B., for perfect visual gradation of sizes, each is drawn separately,
    and none is cut from the master patterns or drawings of any other in geometrical
    proportion by the pantograph process.&#34; <BR> <BR>I&#39;m still digging.  <BR>
    <BR>-- Kent.'

  body: '&#62; I&#39;ve put together a graph of these three features <BR> <BR>Wow,
    nice. <BR>The only problem I see with your method is that you can&#39;t appreciate
    the scale of divergence. <BR> <BR>&#62; the number of decimal places they bothered
    to measure <BR> <BR>Since the Blue and Red are floating-point, the divergence
    is unlikely to be an error, I agree. On the other hand, I don&#39;t think they
    had precision down to about 2.5 microns &#40;like in the Red 7&#41; back then.
    In fact, look how round those numbers are: they&#39;re a result of some sort of
    integer math ratio applied to some [whole] source number. Beyond the mil range
    there&#39;s a uniformity that cannot come from eyeballing. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s
    some thoughts: <BR>- The deviation in Black &#40;from the straight line&#41; must
    be due to rounding to integer. <BR>- I could understand the deviation in Blue:
    you want caps smaller in reading sizes than either in really small sizes or sizes
    verging on display setting. <BR>- I have no ideas about the Red divergence. <BR>
    <BR>&#62;&#62; &#34;The proportions of height and width and the thickness of stems
    and hairlines in each size are thus determined in advance of and as a basis for
    subsequent development of the indicated point sizes required for the series. <BR>
    <BR>There you go! <BR>Makes total sense. You take a 12 point master &#40;the &#34;intended&#34;
    design&#42;&#41;, generate benchmark characters in the 6 that the eye likes using
    predetermined <i>numbers</i> &#40;that were arrived at through an iterative process
    with the eye as &#34;arbiter&#34;&#41;, refine the numbers some more &#40;using
    the eye&#41;, then generate everything with those numbers, interpolating all the
    middle sizes &#40;with tweaks as your graph shows&#41;. The only problem is that
    the eye is not linear... so I would have actually established an eye-determined
    interpolation scheme in addition. BTW, I once measured InDesign&#39;s optical
    spacing compensation for different sizes, and found that it was bi-linear&#42;&#42;:
    no change below 4 point, a straight line between 4 and 12, a separate straight
    line between 12 and 72, and then no change above that. <BR> <BR>&#42; Like I said,
    this is problematic. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42; It probably wasn&#39;t some non-linear
    formula for performance reasons. <BR> <BR>Anyway, please let me/us know if you
    find more good stuff like this! <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'
