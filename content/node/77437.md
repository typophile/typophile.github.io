  body: "As a mature person I would say a freshly applied tattoo with some disparate
    elements that do NOT form a concise design \u2014 but that\u2019s me, a person
    who is considering investing in tattoo-removal clinics\u2026\r\n\r\nAs a graphic
    designer and somewhat type-literate older guy I\u2019d describe this as middling
    hand-lettering, done by someone seriously hindered by a lack of historic art and
    type knowledge\u2026\r\n\r\nAnd on a personal note I\u2019d consider this a truly
    horrible piece of kitschy crap.\r\n\r\nBut that\u2019s just 3 me\u2019s! Your
    mileage may vary."
