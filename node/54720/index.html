Thought I'd use this opportunity to run it by you guys before i show any of the design sketches to the client. 

I'm here to learn and improve my logo design skills. I'd appreciate any feedback/critique from more experienced designers.

		<div class="commentbody">Interesting idea... Miss Tiffany is correct, the top M looks like it hangs too much. You also might want to eliminate the letter shadows as they will create production problems, and they don't really add to the design. In fact, they will detract from the cleanliness of the design when used at small sizes (see image below). In general, shadows (as well as their negative space clearances) should be large enough to work at small sizes.

		<div class="commentbody">I just don’t think that the box of letters conveys the idea of a house. In particular this is because the perspective feels forced in a way that reminds me of technology/software logs. Also, the big heavy letters do not connect to the words, that typeface will never look good centered, and you need to track those caps out, not in. What is it about the houses these companies build that makes this typeface appropriate? And why doesn’t that concept carry over into the mark?

I think you need to go back to the drawing board and come up with a series of ideas that are much more literal and then move to abstraction from there. You also need to rethink your type choice.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">If we're talking home building, the D looks structurally unsound: the M looks like an overhang, an unsupported awning over a void.

I agree with chrisherron that the shadows will be trouble.

What if you put a cube inside, maybe with a blueprint pattern?

And what is the relationship between MMD (or MDM?) with TØMRER/BYGG? Initials? A company name? It's good to spell out the company name so we know what it is.

Square and bold, it would be a useful logo for marking plans, tools, stuff around a job site. (But it *is* merely Helvetica.)

		<div class="commentbody">If you are going for a 3D mark made out of letters, I'd try making it a bit more geometrically interesting. At the very least consider folding M vertically in middle to form a roof or wrapping adjacent faces along D's curvature. 

E.g. rotate D 90 deg ccw and use it as a front side of the house, then use two Ms to form side walls and make them curve along the D and meet at the top.</div>

Maybe this means at first there's no person and it's sad, then they built the house (the "D") and a person moved in! ;-)  (Warning, textbook graphic designer post-rationalization ahead...) You can even see how the "D" is actually an arrowhead leading from the cold, barren skeleton of a house to the warm, full-of-life house!

		<div class="commentbody">Well, I thought they were MMD... Perhaps it is too difficult to follow the MDM path for me.

Three things I had to deal with when I was a beginner in studying Architecture:
<ol>
<li>Humans don't like to live within the stereotypes they use to represent their houses.</li>
<li>In real life, one never sees the world from the point of view one use to represent it.</li>
<li>Nobody feels him/herself represented as some lines whit a black dot as a head.</li>
</ol>

I forgot how many times me and my colleagues forgot those basic principles while designing houses in the wrong way, especially by not taking in account we build spaces for very complex individuals, not poultry farms for chickens.

As a teacher, I laughed with my pupils when, asked to draw some urban landscape, they used to show the upper side of things –mostly balconies–, something that was impossible to see since they were sat on the ground floor, but that was indelibly printed on their way of thinking.
