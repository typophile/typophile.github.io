    is holding it up (and likely for ransom, thinking I'm a desperate cross-border

    lined up around the block to see it. No riots, though. :)

    I happen to bump into them when I was out for a walk the next day. Knowing I'm
    a type designer, they stopped me to ask if I had seen it. They said they really
    enjoyed it and we stood there on the sidewalk talking about it for a good half
    an hour.\r\n\r\nIt's very entertaining and accessible. If you're expecting some
    kind of dry historical survey you might struggle to stay awake through in an art
    history class, it's nothing like that. "

    one with the X on it that you see being made at the factory, the bag that also
    accompanied Gary on his 90-city international screening tour. Inside the bag,
    you'll find a limited-edition box, a Helvetica T-shirt, and special extra goodies.

  body: Ohhh.... I can't wait to get my hands on it!!! The movie was sooooo great
    :-)) I just loved the scene where they showed the "Linotype" building - it is
    sooo funny when you have seen the "real" building, hihi....
