  typography can contribute to helping dyslexics read with more clarity.\r\n\r\ndoes
  anyone know of any good sites or projects of a similar nature?\r\n\r\ni have seen
  the basics, bda etc... but am looking for some info from designers or typographers
  with knowledge of this particular topic.\r\n\r\nwww.unitprodesign.com shows an interesting
  reasearch based project, but there doesn't seem to be a typeface along with it!\r\n\r\nall
  help is greatfully welcomed.\r\n\r\njohn b."

  body: Have you seen <a href="http://www.readregular.com/english/intro.html" target="blank">this</a>?
    It's a typeface specially designed to help dyslexics read. The theory is that
    the letterforms are asymmetrical making it easier for word / character recognition.

  body: "In your research you've probably discovered that Dyslexia is a blanket term
    for a diverse range of reading issues. Although the approach used in Read Regular
    or other specific typefaces might help some of these readers, proving so would
    be very difficult. \r\n\r\nSi"

    a <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/14660\" target=\"new\">previous thread</a>
    with some useful links.\r\n\r\nAs Simon mentioned, Dyslexia is a \"blanket\" term.
    Here an extract from my post to the above mentioned thread:\r\n\r\n\"I believe
    your mention of learning disabilities (inclusive of dyslexia, dyscalculia, dysgraphia,
    dyspraxia, and visual processing disorder) involves a completely different area
    of research not fully dependent on character recognition itself.\r\n\r\nBy no
    means do I understand the issues related to such disorders, but one of my business
    partners is heavily involved with <a href=\"http://www.edvocacy.org/prob2.htm\"
    target=\"new\">Edvocacy.org</a>, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to establishing
    a national early recognition program for children with dyslexia. (Visit the link
    and take the little decoding test to give you a sense of what dyslexic readers
    go through.)\r\n\r\nMy wife also happens to work for <a href=\"http://www.landmarkoutreach.org/res_e_faq.htm\"
    target=\"new\">The Landmark School</a> which is one of the best known private
    educational facilities for children with reading and learning disorders. Of what
    I know of their mission is that they are training the students to decode and reprocess
    information encountered in their daily lives.\""

  body: "Apparently there is less dyslexia in Italy, attributed to fewer phonemes
    and fewer alternate phonemes for the same glyph.\r\n\r\nSpelling reform is surely
    a more fruitful area of research than typography.\r\n\r\nBut I don't think you
    have to do it for everyone. Perhaps just a variety of alternate \"logicalized\"
    spelling systems for the different kinds of dyslexia, and a software program to
    translate.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do believe that \"non-transformable\" glyph shapes
    are inherently more legible than those which can be transformed into other characters
    simply by rotating or flipping. Which gives serifed type the advantage.\r\n\r\n"

    first glance, yes. But when you realize that typography can be improved through
    the subconscious channel, while spelling reform can't, and only a good king can
    carry through conscious reform, and we don't got many good kings now, then spelling
    reform is pretty hopeless.  :-(\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
