body: "Hello!\r\nThis is to let you know of my second font release called Silent Alternates.\r\n\r\nSilent
  Alternates born from the deconstruction of Silent Light, resulting in a most impressive
  typeface.\r\nIdeal for use in large sizes, such as posters, titles and is an alternative
  to italics. It can be used to highlight some words in conjunction with Silent Light.\r\n\r\nHope
  you like it.\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/danieljusti/silent-alternates/\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your time. Feedback\u2019s apreciated.\r\nBest regards!\r\n\r\nJusti\r\nhttp://www.danieljusti.com[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2_4756.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/4_5824.png]"
