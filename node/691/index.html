  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">OK, I&#39;m convinced that exclusivity would be a good idea. For one, it avoids having to discuss the side issue of why we want a separate grouping. &#34;Because we do&#34; is as good an answer as I&#39;m willing to give a lot of folks. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m thinking we need to have T-shirts with our individual names on the back, except replacing the occasional vowel with a strategic &#34;y&#34; -- right, Dyana? <BR> <BR>I find it interesting that in that nearly 30 years I got my first job as a &#40;cold&#41; typesetter, the majority of my colleagues have been female. I suspect the opposite was true when hot metal was the standard. I&#39;m thinking the gender issue in our field is quite an interesting topic.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>&#62;but reading should definitely be open. You want us to learn, right?</i> <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think it has to be about anyone else learning, Hrant. I think &#40;and y&#39;all can correct me if I&#39;m wrong&#41; it&#39;s about having their own place to discuss what they want to discuss. Tiff, Dyana, Kristin, Shelley, you gals should do whatever the hell you want -- open or not open -- without caring a whit what Hrant or I or anyone else thinks. &#40;I guess this includes that remark, too -- whatever.&#41; <BR> <BR>BTW, in the course of my research I was impressed to find, among the unsung heros of the MLCo. drawing office whose names appear in the title blocks of the working drawings, a Ms. Dorothy Arbogast working on the Caledonia Italic drawings in 1937. If memory serves, that&#39;s well before the widespread migration of women into the American workforce that occurred later during the war years. I thought that was cool. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">&#62; budding female type designers/lettering artists might not know it exists. <BR> <BR>Although I think this can be largely counteracted through good promotion, you&#39;ve made me realize something related: it&#39;s not enough to declare existence - some people join a list based on the quality of its content, sometimes even to reply to a specific post they simply <i>can&#39;t</i> let slide. These people won&#39;t join if they don&#39;t see what&#39;s inside first &#40;especially if they have to <i>pay</i>&#41;. <BR> <BR>For example, from what I understand ATypI gained members as a result of opening up the list to non-members. Actually, this has currently been suspended, but only because of a legal situation. And for the month of August the list will be opened up again - but possibly only to discuss a specific issue, the Code Morale. More on this soon. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thought #1: It is free. The registration to which I referred was mostly teasing Shelley, as she is still unregistered. <BR> <BR>Thought #2: Typophile is mostly a boys club. Not out of the doing from Joe or Jared. It is open to the girls, that is true, but I think for the most part girls don&#39;t want to deal with the confrontational nature of some of the members here. I&#39;m attempting to bring them to typophile through the back door. <BR> <BR>Thought #3. If it were to be read by the boys, what would stop you from criticizing our discussion in the main hall? As Jon and Kent have mentioned, if anything starts in Alphabetty that I think needs public discussion, I&#39;ll do that. <BR> <BR>Thought #4. This was offered to myself by Jared and Joe. If they felt is was using resources they wouldn&#39;t have offered. <BR> <BR>Thought #5. I&#39;m not the one launching an atmosphere of antagonism. <BR> <BR>Thought #6. I think you, Hrant, are the only one threatened by the idea of us girls having our own little room. <BR> <BR>Thought #7. At TypeCon there was great interest in the idea of the Alphabetty. Yes I will have to do some promotion. But in between the few that do want to participate, I&#39;m sure we can drum up enough interest. However, should it fall on deaf ears so be it. But we won&#39;t know without trying. So please don&#39;t yank the bud until it&#39;s bloomed. <BR> <BR>Thought #8. Just because I am starting the Alphabetty forum, don&#39;t think you&#39;ll see me disappear. <BR> <BR>So. How many of you boys are against this idea? And what about the girls? Just post FOR or AGAINST. To be fair to Hrant. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I can understand having different interest groups based on some sort of relationship to the typographic community, such as a student group, an independent foundry group, a group mainly interested in revivals, or blackletter, or whatever.  <BR> <BR>I can also understand why people may want to have geographic-based groupings too - that certainly makes sense from a social, cultural and typographic standpoint too. <BR> <BR>However, I do not see why there would be a particular need for a form of <i>membership</i> that is based on gender, or sexuality, or race, or religion, or any other grouping that does not in any significant or meaningful way relate to the subject matter at hand - that of typography. <BR> <BR>I certainly do not wish to cause offense &#40;indeed the post was meant to be tongue in cheek, referring to my own particular little minority that is faaarrr smaller I suspect&#41;, neither would I want to stop it happening, but this is an open forum, and do I wish to remain silent on issues and events within the community merely for fear of contradicting others.  <BR> <BR>That said, if anyone found the ghetto reference offensive, please accept my apology here. May I invite you along to my favourite club here in London for a drink. Called, aptly, The Ghetto. <BR> <BR>Yours, a minority.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&#62; girls don&#39;t want to deal with the confrontational nature of some of the members here. <BR> <BR>Yes, this is a classic phenomenon - not restricted to Typophile. I think Kent referred to this early on. <BR> <BR>But there&#39;s a huge difference between limiting participation to foster a certain class of discussion versus limiting exposure to... what? The type of discussion that&#39;s confrontational &#40;!&#41; enough to be a <i>social</i> problem is unlikely to be typographically relevant. And again, there&#39;s always private email. <BR> <BR>&#62; what would stop you from criticizing our discussion in the main hall? <BR> <BR>Proper decorum. In my 5&#43; years on-line I&#39;ve rarely seen such a thing happen, and when it does people generally strike it down. Or you could ask the listmoms to remove offending posts - I&#39;m a big fan of judicious censorship. <BR> <BR>Or: <BR> <BR>&#62; Trust <BR> <BR>But obviously not enough of it to let non-females simply listen in... <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t feel threatened - people use private email to bag on men &#40;and me&#41; all the time - it&#39;s natural, and I wouldn&#39;t want to stop it, or even read it. I just feel sad that you want to hide, instead of letting the world benefit from your insight. And I can&#39;t be the only one who thinks like this, just the most vocal. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>&#62; does not in any significant or meaningful way relate to the subject matter at hand <BR> <BR>I think it does. Gender has bearing on everything. <BR>That&#39;s why I think Alphabetty is a great idea, as long as it&#39;s not used to entrench insecurities and mistrust. <BR> <BR>&#62; faaarrr smaller I suspect <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not so sure about that!  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">FOR or AGAINST. <BR> <BR>I think David has a valid point. I don&#39;t like the idea of breaking up into groups that focus on our differences. <BR> <BR>If one group feels isolated, then a focused group may be an acceptable means of integration; so long as there were plans to actually <i>integrate</i>, instead of just permanent plans to segregate. <BR> <BR>Perhaps a solution would be including in the plans a phase out of the seperate group once female participation has reached a predetermined level. And a caveat to dissolve the group if it doesn&#39;t achieve it&#39;s designed purpose - to make women feel welcome here - so that the group just doesn&#39;t perpetuate in segregation indefinitely.  <BR> <BR>So, if you decide to pursue this vein, just make sure that women do become an actual part of the community through this and not just an annex to it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">One of the most wonderful aspects of type appreciation,  <BR>design, and history is it&#39;s capacity to bind. When I say  <BR>bind, I mean the collection of opinion, culture and  <BR>knowledge - people, in other words.  <BR> <BR>Independent of geography, income, skin color or yes,  <BR>even sex, we have a commonality among us. We have  <BR>a love for typography and all of us are free to express  <BR>our passions here.  <BR> <BR>I want to know what you are thinking, what ideas you have  <BR>to share. I want to talk to you regardless of what you  <BR>might look like, what gender you are or what sex you prefer. <BR> <BR>And if I can, I would like to share my ideas with you as well. <BR> <BR>Collectively, our community is relatively already small and I would <BR>find it unfortunate to divide it, in any way, by such a thing as gender. <BR> <BR>I, for one, am not going to stand in anyone&#39;s way of doing  <BR>something. But I think the consequences should be fully thought out.  <BR>The result, in my mind, will be that everyone will lose a little something. <BR> <BR>Our collective knowledge is better than divided. <BR> <BR>Sean</div>
