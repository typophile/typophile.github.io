body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI'm trying to determine a good body copy font for an identity
  system, but the tricky thing is I.D.ing something that is likely on my client's
  system. Not the end client, but my client (the marketing person) in order to avoid
  extra expense.\r\n\r\nI used Bell Gothic in the logotype but don't intend on using
  it for the font family(s) for the identity system. My preference would be to I.D.
  one humanist sans like Scala, Syntax or Profile for use in all communications and
  skip a serif font. I have no control over the communications materials as she's
  taking that on herself, even though she's not a designer (another story).\r\n\r\nThe
  business is a pretty manly, industrial enterprise. Many of my serif fonts tend to
  have italics that are too calligraphic for some uses, and my tastes, like Minion
  and Meridian. Sabon isn't bad. I've used Adobe Garamond too much in my life, though
  I like it.\r\n\r\nI may have to resort to Myriad or Frutiger (for the sans) but
  I don't think those are as flexible in a total identity system to stand on their
  own for all copy. In which case I will need to pick a serif to go with.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any opinions!\r\n\r\nJane"
