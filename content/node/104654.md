  Extended and Medium Extended. If possible, I'd like to avoid using Neue Helvetica
  Extended. In a previous response to this question from 2010, someone suggested:
  Armitage (Fontspring). Has anyone come across any other substitutes since then?
  \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n"

  body: '[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/castletype/standard/|Standard CT]] has eight
    extended weights and is quite similar to Akzidenz-Grotesk. No italics though.
    You could also try the two extended weights of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/trade-gothic/|Trade
    Gothic]] (regular and bold).'
