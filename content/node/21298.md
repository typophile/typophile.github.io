    and this is my first posting, I will make something out of it:\r\nAs a screenfont
    I prefer Verdana / Tahoma / Arial, in that order. The only problem with Verdana
    is, that it is rather wide.\r\nOn websites that need a serif (maybe for a classy,
    old, luxureous look n feel) I prefer Georgia."

  body: "I think it somewhat depends on the rendering. From what I recall, Verdana
    was designed to be a screen-friendly font, back before anti-aliasing became more
    prevalent. However, now that most operating systems support some form of anti-aliasing
    technology, many more fonts can be \"screen-friendly\" without necessarily being
    designed for the screen. With anti-aliasing in play, Verdana still looks good--but
    not a whole lot better than [insert font here].\r\n\r\nFor me, the best sans-serif
    is a tie between Verdana and Lucida; the best serif is Georgia.\r\n\r\nIMO, when
    printed on paper, Georgia still looks nice... but Verdana looks awful, especially
    at larger sizes."

    wouldn't say that it was *for* Adobe, or Apple or MS, these companies (Adobe included?)
    just licensed the font.\r\n\r\nIf Tom gets credit for Nina he should also for
    Verdana, Georgia and Tahoma. \r\n\r\nArial, for IBM originally, no?\r\n"

    know about the Arial for IBM.

  body: "Hi guys:\r\n\r\nLucida is the only (interface) sans good for print and screen.
    Verdana and Tahoma are very ugly in print but highly readable on screen (the best).
    Helvetica is nice for print and o-kay screen but for interfaces???? Georgia is
    lovely on screen and print- if they made a PRO version with small caps I would
    snatch it up!!!\r\n\r\nWith Vista just on the horizon... there is going to be
    even more choices than ever... I'm loving these new fonts- I hope us mac folks
    can get these preinstalled with leopard too.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ascendercorp.com/WPF_fonts.html\r\n\r\nBTW...
    comic sans looks excellent on screen at smaller sizes- apatures are nice and open-
    very readable!\r\n\r\n\r\ntwardoch> Where did you find the information officina
    sans being hand-hinted?\r\n\r\nMikey"
