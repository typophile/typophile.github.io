  body: "It IS Kursivschrift!\r\nIf you like the semi-script thing about it, you might
    also like Fenotype's Digital Kauno (http://www.fenotype.com/font/fontpage.htm)
    although its balance is leaning to the other side, being more script-like.\r\nI
    posted my first font here (http://typophile.com/node/27678) a couple of days ago
    which was inspired by Digital Kauno (amongst other things).\r\nAnother -closer-
    alternative to Kursivschrift would be Bellevue (http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=bellevue)
    which however is a little old."

  body: "yes, you're right it IS Kursivschrif. I can tell too.\r\nFling and Digital
    Kauno (I have this one and love it!) are awesome too. I am going to check these
    other ones right now.\r\nI've found this font called Wenceslas at http://www.dafont.com/fr/search.php?q=wenceslas.
    What do u think, i think it's kind of an interesting font...\r\nI'm in the middle
    of redesigning my business cards and I am desperately looking for a \"crush\"
    on a new font that i am going to use for the \"text\" (the adress, title etc.)
    I started with a Minion, then went for a Trade Gothic Condensed, then an Officina
    s\xE9rif italic and at last a Georgia italic. Call me a schizo : I like them all
    (though I am kind of tired of Minion) ! Now i am actually considering purchasing
    this Kursivschrift. The matter is this seems to be a great font at a rather big
    size but doesn't seem to be perfectly readable at a size 9 for example. What do
    u think ?"

  body: "Wencleas seems a little like an amateuristic version to me (although Manfred
    Klein does make nice things in general).\r\nNone of these typefaces are really
    suitable for longer texts or for small use. Depending on which you choose, it
    could be OK for an adress though."

    Linotype and I am very happy about it.\r\nNow, may I ask for your comments about
    this new business card of mine, I'm still hesitating between the different \"versions\".
    It is going to be offset printed on transparent Cromatico\u2122 paper.\r\nThanks
    in advance.\r\n(I was also thinking to use Digital Kauno's \"@\")\r\n\r\nOh shit
    ! Can't I post a .pdf on typophile?"
