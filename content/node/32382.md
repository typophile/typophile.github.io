  me.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a good and hopefully free (or at least inexpensive) typeface
  to use for annotations on certain slides in my portfolio (industrial design). Something
  that looks personal, perhaps in a handwritten style but that remains readable. Other
  options would be a cursive or even a warm italic typeface. \r\n\r\nI want to use
  it for brief segments pointing out details on pencil sketches.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions
  would be appreciated!"
