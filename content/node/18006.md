body: "Hi people!\r\n\r\nI\u2019m new here, and I think someone can help me. So, let\xB4s
  go to the problem:\r\nI study Environmental Engineering in Brazil (my native language
  is Portuguese, so sorry about any English mistake) and I tried to, at the beginning
  of the course, create a logo for the course. The first try resulted in:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/14-engamb.jpg]\r\n\r\nThis
  was a very bad logo, I know\u2026 and everybody, all my friends said that too! ;)\r\n\r\nSo,
  I have decided to improve the logo, and then:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/22-engamb.jpg]\r\n\r\nAlthough
  better then the first, I wasn\xB4t completely satisfied. People criticised about
  the hand of 4 fingers! LOL! Then, finally I did another logo, now with 5 fingers
  and some more modifications and variations (see attachments to enlarge and see better
  the hand\xB4s details):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/engenharia1.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/engenharia2.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/engenharia3.png]\r\n\r\nAnd
  here is the final Logo with some lights and shadow effects:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/eng_amb-yahoo.png]\r\n\r\nBut,
  the problem is that, this new hands with 5 fingers didn\xB4t satisfy my college
  friends! They told that the hand looks like a monster hand! I'm not professional,
  and my artistic ability isn\xB4t enought to draw a realistic hand.\r\n\r\nSo, I
  come here with the hope that someone could help me with this hand, and any other
  suggestion about my logo. I don\xB4t know if is necessary the logo in vetorial format
  here to you make changes\u2026 I can share here the file in CorelDraw format if
  necessary.\r\n\r\nThanks to all that help!!!"

  body: "You should have the USP follow the same curve as the rest of the copy above
    it and below. Right know it feels as if the U and P are skewed in oppisite directions.
    You could also give it a little letter spacing to the letters to fill out the
    area. \r\n\r\nAs for the hand maybe you can be simplier with it. Treat it as an
    icon like you did with the water, sun & nature symbols. I feel like you are trying
    to draw a realistic hand, which is something that is just plain hard to do. I
    think that the bumps on the fingers take away more then it is giving.\r\n\r\nAlso
    I like the black and white version better then the color version. One key thing
    to remember when designing a logo is that it needs to work first in black and
    white before color should be applied. When you design in black and white, which
    is a designers purest form, mistakes will appear that color will hide.\r\n\r\nI
    hope this was helpful, and good luck.\r\n\r\n< J o s e p h >"

  body: "I think you are fitting a lot of information into the logo, and as Joseph
    notes hands (and feet) are notoriously difficult to draw, I like the simplicity
    of the first revise, a kind of Matisse cut paper feel to it, try taking the form
    of that representation but instead of showing the fingers separated join them
    together into one block (keeping the thumb separate) with four curves as finger
    tips (kind of like <a href=\"http://creative.gettyimages.com/source/classes/FrameSet.aspx?&UQR=goxcof&pk=4&source=front&lightboxView=1&txtSearch=openhand&selImageType=6&chkLicensed=on&chkRoyaltyFree=on\">this</a>,
    this is not of your style but gives a hint).\r\nOne of the most important considerations
    when designing a logo is that it should be usable in any number of situations
    (I realise your logo has a narrow use but the principle is the same) to that end
    it has to be possible to use it at a small size so in many ways the simpler the
    better, I would avoid using the dropshadow and gradation, to keep the potential
    use to a wide range of possibilities.\r\nTim"

  body: Simplify the logo you have to many things happening and nothing is dominate.
    First loose the sun and waves they are not needed they don't add anything. Just
    use a hand shape with the fingers together and knock out the leaf shape, from
    the hand shape. Don't make the hand follow the curve. Loose all the photoshop
    effects they don't add anything to the look. Joseph is correct about the USP type.
