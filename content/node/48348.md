  body: "edit: crosspost with florian\r\n\r\nthere's not a font quite like this ...
    it's either built-from-scratch (custom) or\r\na font heavily modified (customized)\r\n\r\nif
    it is customized, it might be a titling face such as New Horizon Titling\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/aboutype/new-horizon/\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nim_3429.jpg]\r\n\r\nYou
    could get in contact with Mojohouse ... Mojo did the Nim's Island movie posters.
    They might have been working with key art created by someone else.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.mojohouse.com/contact/emails.html\r\n\r\n"
