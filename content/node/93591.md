  body: Looking at [[http://991.com/NewGallery/Marvelettes-The-Best-Of-The-M-452449.jpg|this
    better quality version]] reveals it to be Helvetica with a somewhat artificial-looking
    inline stroke, an effect that should be easy enough to replicate in whatever design
    program you're using. :) (A version of Helvetica appears on Mac computers, otherwise
    you have to buy it I'm afraid.)

  it?
