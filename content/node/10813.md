body: Here is the Design Alchemy logo , which is a modified &#34;A&#34; from RXC&#39;
  s Spanner typeface. It weighs in at about 230 lbs and is fabricated to spec by Rubicon
  Design &#43; Fabrication in solid 4&#34; steel using plasma cutting technique. It
  was then distressed with torch and hammer. <BR>I had it photographed by Robin Bartholick
  &#40;bartholick.com&#41; . We shot 5 rolls of 4x5 and then scanned the best pictures
  at 360 meg files with a Nikon 8000 film scanner. We did a couple of rolls experimenting
  with fire by applying rubber cement and ligthing it on fire.  <BR>I have yet to
  finish up these as they take lots of time due to difficulty of creating realistic
  masks around fire. <BR>I am currently going through ideas and comps for a co-promotion
  of Psyops/Design Alchemy. I will post this as it comes into final stages. <BR><IMG

    but now it has new meaning for me!  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>One suggestion: I&#39;d like
    to be able to lift it &#40;with some effort&#41;, so maybe you should make one
    about half the weight? <BR> <BR>hhp '

    with one leg crossed high over the other - matching the structure of the glyph/sculpture.

  body: ' Hola Ole! <BR> <BR>Is a great idea to work with typography in urban proyects
    as a sculpture. I think that the B-boys, and grafitti have to study more architecture.  <BR>In
    my personal wave, i&acute;m study the 3-d grafitty <BR>style and i imagine this
    as a new kind of urban expression, with more impact! <BR>Congratulations, guys!!!!

    The cost and time factor is sadly too much for most clients and too expensive
    for personal expression. '

  body: "I don't understand why you've chosen this way for your promotional card.\r\n\r\nWhy
    have you made a 'crafted' version of your logo (with such techniques as plasma
    cutting) ?\r\n\r\nI mean why spending time and money to make something 'big' and
    'real' (which is something cool in this 2.0 world) if it's to put it so small
    in a corner of your card with so much effects ?\r\n\r\nI'm sorry, but I don't
    get it. if I were you, I'd just put a big photo of your real-life logo with a
    kind of motto saying something like \"here at Design Alchemy, we're giving life
    to typography\" or \"we make it big\", etc.\r\n\r\nHope you'll understand what
    I mean and that I'm not out of the subject.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I wish you the best.\r\n"
