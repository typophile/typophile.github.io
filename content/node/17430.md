body: "<strong>Welcome to the Typophile message boards!</strong>\r\nWe're happy to
  have you and hope you feel comfortable enough to join our discussions. To keep things
  running smoothly, please read and follow these guidelines:\r\n\r\n<a name=\"forums\"></a><strong>Post
  threads in the appropriate forum:</strong>\r\nIf you're trying to identify a font
  from a sample, post requests in the <strong><a href=\"http://typophile.com/forum/29\">Type
  ID Board</a></strong>.\r\n<p>\r\nLooking for type advice for a specific project,
  or searching for a certain style of typeface? Ask in the \"<a href=\"http://typophile.com/forum/5\"><strong>Design</a></strong>\"
  forum. Do you have a typeface, logo or layout that you want some feedback on? Post
  your work to the \"<a href=\"http://typophile.com/forum/1\"><strong>Critique</a></strong>\"
  forum. Having technical difficulties with fonts or software? Ask your question in
  our \"<a href=\"http://typophile.com/forum/6\"><strong>Build</a></strong>\" forum.
  Are you wondering about legal or marketing aspects of fonts? Post your questions
  to the \"<a href=\"http://typophile.com/forum/7\"><strong>Release</a></strong>\"
  forum. Trying to find the name of a font you've seen?  Ask our gurus in the \"<a
  href=\"http://typophile.com/forum/29\"><strong>Type ID Board</a></strong>\". Do
  you have an announcement you think everyone should know about? You can either contact
  one of our moderators (more information below), or you can <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/add/story\">post
  it yourself</a> (be sure to check \"Published\" and uncheck \"In Moderation\" before
  submitting, you must then alert one of the moderators to your new posting: see Help
  below). Most other topics will belong here, in the \"<strong>General Discussion</strong>\"
  area. There is no need to duplicate threads in separate forums, one thread to your
  question in the appropriate forum should suffice.\r\n\r\n<a name=\"search\"></a><strong>Search
  before you post:</strong>\r\nMany topics have been discussed at length previously
  on Typophile. If you're researching a particular topic, utilize the search function
  to look for threads with relevant information. If there are no threads that address
  the topic or angle you're looking for, post a new thread or feel free to add to
  one of the existing threads. There is no need to post your inquiry to more that
  one discussion board, multiple threads will be deleted. For answers to other frequently
  asked questions see the [[FAQs]] section of the [[typowiki|wiki]]. And on the other
  side of this coin:\r\n\r\n<a name=\"new\"></a><strong>Don't hijack other threads:</strong>\r\nDon't
  post irrelevant queries within another thread; create a new thread. You can post
  a new topic by scrolling to the bottom of one of the main forum pages and clicking
  on the \"<a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/add/forum/0\">Post a new topic</a>\"
  link.\r\n\r\n<a name=\"images\"></a><strong>Image technical requirements:</strong>\r\nThe
  best way to post an image is to use the \"Insert Image\" function below the \"Comments\"
  box. To utilize this function, you must have the <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/shockwave/download/download.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash\">Flash
  8 player</a> installed. If you have an image to accompany your post, please ensure
  that it conforms to the following guidelines: do not exceed 600 px wide, save images
  as an RGB jpg/gif/png (tips: gifs are usually crisper for black and white type renderings
  and not all browsers support png). Also, make sure that your image has a unique
  name, otherwise typophile may call another image instead of the one you inteded
  to be displayed.\r\n\r\n<a name=\"help\"></a><strong>Contact Moderators for Assistance:</strong>\r\nIf
  you need help using Typophile features, have a news announcement, or find someone
  is abusing the forums, please contact one of our moderators: http://typophile.com/moderators\r\n\r\n<em>Typophile
  moderators reserve the right to edit or remove any posts or links that they deem
  inappropriate.</em>\r\n\r\n<a name=\"free\"></a><strong>About <em>Free</em> Fonts:</strong>\r\nIf
  you're looking for free fonts, please see our article called [[FAQ_free|FAQ: where
  to find \"cool\" free fonts]]. Do not ask members to send you copies of retail fonts.
  Such behavior is not looked upon kindly by those of us who make a living designing
  type or those of us who support the work of talented type designers. By the same
  token, please do not post links to sites which offer unauthorized downloads of commercial
  fonts. If you do wish to report a site with this activity, please contact a moderator.\r\n\r\n<a
  name=\"conduct\"></a><strong>Be Courteous:</strong>\r\nLast, but not least, please
  conduct yourself with restraint and treat others who use these discussion boards
  with respect. Be prepared for some lively banter and keep a thick skin. However,
  please refrain from any personal attacks of other typophile members on these boards.
  Also, do not abuse contact methods made available to interact with other users to
  make such attacks. Once again, if you notice any inappropriate behavior in this
  regard, please contact a moderator.\r\n\r\n<strong>Thanks</strong>\r\nThank you
  for reading and abiding by these suggestions. Thank you, also, for participating
  in our Typophile community. If you would like to show your support for this site,
  please visit the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/membership\">Membership</a> area
