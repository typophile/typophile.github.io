body: "I created a logo for a sports cafe and I would like some critique please. Feel
  free to tear it apart, I have a strong stomach, LOL. I am not really liking the
  *DINE* part of it but I am not really sure what else to do with it. Thank you.\r\n\r\nI
  just added a second version that I like a bit better.\r\n\r\nThe last three images
  are what I came up with for the second round. I realize the full version is a bit
  large so I added a version with just the name and just the initials. The client
  asked to have the initials *GTD* with the text *Game Time Dine* and *Sports and
  Fine Dining* underneath."

  body: What about GameTime set in an arch, and DINE set in a varsity style slab?

  body: "DINE in all caps definitely isn't working, that's just not a font that can
    be set that way. If you did choose to go that way I think an unobtrusive sans
    would be your best bet.\r\n\r\nThat being said I also had the thought of a varsity
    style slab for the logo, I think that could work well and would be a bit less
    cliched than your first attempt."

  body: "Personally I don't think 'Dine' is the right word to use. When I read out
    Game Time Dine it sounds pretty awkward. I would also connect the word 'dine'
    to a cheap restaurant not a caf\xE9. Do you have other options or is the client
    set on 'Dine'?\r\n\r\nAgreed that the type for 'Dine' doesn't work. In the second
    version it's very crowded as well.\r\n\r\nThe Connection between 'e' and 'T' seems
    awkward. I think I would separate 'Game' and 'Time' and shorten the part of the
    e that sticks out.\r\n\r\nOtherwise I like the typeface. I get a baseball feel
    from it which is suitable. The arch idea sound interesting that might work very
    well."

  body: "What is DINE? Is it a command? \"It's game time! Now, DINE!\"\r\n\r\nDo you
    mean Diner? It doesn't make sense right now (graphically or grammatically).\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thank you for all of the input and I apologize for my delayed response. After
    continuing to tweak the logo I ended up completely changing the logo. I set *Fine
    Time Dine* in one size using main script font. I then added the text *Sports and
    Fine Dining* in Bembo, tucked between a swatch that I added to the *e* of *Dine*
    and I enlarged the *G* of *Game*. I showed it to the client and I am going to
    start over from scratch. I might use the same script font although I think I will
    change it to go for a classier look. Unfortunately the copy that was supplied
    by the client and I am stuck with it. If anyone would like I can post the changes
    I made. I will be working on the logo this weekend so I can post the redesign
    I come up with too.\r\n\r\nOh, and I got these fonts from http://www.letterheadfonts.com.
    The main font is Ballpark Script and the font in the swatch is Tideway Script.
    Just in case anybody was wondering. I should also add that I quick whipped this
    logo up as a favor to a friend and I am not all that proud of it. I will put more
    effort into the next round :)"
