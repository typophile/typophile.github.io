  body: Oh, that's annoying. I don't suppose there are any deep-pocketed eccentrics
    out there who feel like sponsoring a brief transatlantic research trip about typography
    and math, right? Not only do I miss TypeCon this year, but it looks like that
    workshop will happen on the very same day I began writing my dissertation on that
    exact topic.
