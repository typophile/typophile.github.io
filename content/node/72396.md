body: "Hi all.\r\nBefore I get too deep into this design, I want to run this past
  everyone to see if it resembles any existing typeface. I'd hate to put in a ton
  of effort to hear someone say \"you know that looks like a knock-off of XXX Roman\"
  etc. I like where it's going, but you know, I want to make sure.\r\n\r\nAnd if you
  have any initial comments, have at it. But keep in mind I haven't yet touched the
  spacing/kerning.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fetique1_3734.png]\r\n\r\nThanks."

    thing that bothers me. I used to make the same mistake and I see it in a lot of
    starting typefaces.\r\n\r\ncheck: http://www.typeworkshop.com/index.php?id1=type-basics\r\nthe
    article 'Balance Shapes' is what I'm talking about, but it's a very good website
    in general."

    What's the one thing? I'm pretty sure the B and r have the right adjustments."

  body: Did you already adjest it, but your not sure weather you did it properly.
    Your B doens't need adjestment. It's fine. But an r needs more whitespace at the
    than an n. You just made a chopped of n which is bad for readability and (my opinion)
    looks unbalanced.

    below) This \"spurless\" design presents its own little problems, like we have
    here. No matter what you do it's going to look somewhat like you've just cut the
    leg off an \"n.\"\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture-2_5511.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture-3_3468.png]"

    and it's still your typeface, but I think this looks better. Hope you agree. Could
    you have a look at my 'expletus sans' and 'expletus text' posts please?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture-3_3468_6566.jpg]"

  body: "I appreciate your critique but I'm not completely sold on that way of doing
    it. I agree that yours does look more balanced as a singular letter but it creates
    a shape that doesn't appear in any of the other letters that run along the x-height.
    \r\n\r\nI could be persuaded though. Any other opinions out there?"
