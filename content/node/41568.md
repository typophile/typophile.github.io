  body: Design Museum's typeface has been identified before as a customized <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fontfont/ff_schulbuch_nord_fett/?sample_text=Re-Magazine%20Claudia">FF
    Schubuch Nord</a>, but looking at this 'R', I have to say <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/ag-schoolbook-be/medium-a/">Akzidenz-Grotesk
    Schoobook A</a> or <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/ag-schoolbook-bq/two-medium/">AG
    Schoolbook Two</a> is more accurate. As far as I can tell, the two Berthold families
    (one from the BE collection and one from BQ) have identical outlines.
