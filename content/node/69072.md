  feedback on these logos.\r\n\r\nThis is a re-brand for an established IT help desk
  company \r\nwhich is looking to promote the web hosting side of their business.\r\n\r\nThey're
  present branding includes the red colour, with just text (arial i think)\r\nI'd
  unfotrunately like to stick with only the fonts you get free on a standard mac.\r\n\r\nI
  would like to present a maximum of 3 logos to the client,\r\nnot got the confidence
  yet to decide for myself whats best.\r\n\r\nAny feedback welcome, just your top
  1 or 2 logos\r\nsome finish work needed on all logos[img:sites/default/files/old-images/samples_5721.jpg]"

    calligraphic) lowercase e with a lowercase d? '

  body: "Definitely not B. Too much detail.\r\n\r\nNot A, C or E either, because they
    depict WiFi service or product.\r\n\r\nThat leaves D, which is not bad purely
    from the perspective of the mark design. But I cannot relate the mark to neither
    help desk nor to the web hosting service. So I agree with gtrianta - D shows most
    promise, but it needs work.\r\n\r\nAlso consider using two colors for edesk. One
    for e, and the other - for desk.\r\n\r\nAlso d-e and s-k look too loose compared
    to e-d and e-s. I would re-kern for consistency."

  body: D looks way too "d-ish" as it stands now. I don't see the e.

  body: "Thanks gtriana - i'll investigate the calligraphic style, not sure if I have
    a font for the type that will match it, or if it relates to th business\r\n\r\napankrat
    - thanks also, i'd agree with you that the e and desk need differentiated, and
    that E and C depict wi-fi,\r\nthe idea with A is that the 3 lines depict a stack
    of hard disks (the web hosting) and also and uppercase E, \r\nwhich i guess is
    redundant really.\r\n\r\nthanks aluminium, always good to hear a positive with
    the constructive, I guess I need to work on the d mark and see what \r\ni come
    up with.\r\n\r\nif anyone has any ideas on a mark that depicts web hosting (not
    forgetting the ITdesk angle) i would be glad of the advice\r\n\r\nGood Stuff!"

  body: "I am a bit color blind (green and brown colors are sometimes a problem).
    So don\u2019t give too much on my comment with regard to the colors: The contrast
    of color and light is odd in all examples. The colors somehow don\u2019t work
    together (in both columns, except from the white logos). And partly the examples
    look mixed up from existing logos/icons.\r\n\r\nAnd I dislike the shine on the
    symbol in A and D. In A and E the color of the three curves does not harmony with
    the rest of the icon/sign.\r\n\r\nThe best is this ed-ligature. But even there
    is a disharmony between the ligature and the text below."

    i'm probably spreading myself too thinly and beed to work on just one logo\r\n\r\nCheers
