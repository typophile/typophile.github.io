  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I put this study together this afternoon. It was good to get out the ink and work on paper for once. I've been meaning to play with cursive contextual alternates for a little while. The good news: no kerning! The bad news: getting all the connectors just right. I'm not sure if this works yet; I'm still against handwriting fonts in general, but they're definitely cooler with some alternates mixed in, and with the connectors done right. I think to do it right I would need to mix in a bunch more alternates, but it's a start, and I like where it's going so far. The letters are pretty low res; my scsi scanner won't work with the powerbook, so I resorted to the digicam : (  <BR> <BR><!--attachment: dear_sarah-34367.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*40.7*contextual+alternates*dear_sarah%2epdf --><center><table border=1><tr><td><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_pdf.gif" align=left alt="application/pdf">contextual alternates<br><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/dear_sarah-34367.pdf" target="_blank"><b>dear_sarah.pdf</b></a> (40.7 k)</td></tr></table></center><!--/attachment--></div>

		<div class="commentbody">More stuff. I'm up to around 400 characters so far. This sample doesn't have everything, but it's a bunch. I didn't intend to go this far with this one. I was just working on ideas on how to work the connectors with opentype. At any rate, I've manually added a little bit more resolution to most of the letters. It will take quite a bit more before I'm happy with the digitization. I need to get a scanner (I recently gave my old scsii beast to a thrift store). My 3MP CoolPix isn't cutting it here. It still doesn't seem random enough. I am working out some more fancy OT stuff to randomize the letters. For example, the ll ligature seems to repeat too often. I might mix some of the alternate l's in there somehow. The ff combination also seems repetitive. Maybe it's just becuase I've been looking at it too long. The reality is that the font will probably never be used for more than one sentence anyway, now that I think about it. <BR> <BR>One question for the OT techies out there: at what point to OT instructions start to bog down the software. I would like to do some contextual stuff to make sure that no two letters are ever the same within three characters or so. It will take a lot of instructions to really get it right. I haven't noticed any slow down yet, but it seems like if it had to parse a couple hundred lines of code for every character it would really start to bog down the host software. <BR> <BR><!--attachment: small_cap-36241.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*65.6*More+work*small_cap%2epdf --><center><table border=1><tr><td><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_pdf.gif" align=left alt="application/pdf">More work<br><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/small_cap-36241.pdf" target="_blank"><b>small_cap.pdf</b></a> (65.6 k)</td></tr></table></center><!--/attachment--></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Tiff: I have been trying to work out a double f solution. I'm not quite satisfied with what I've got. You are one step ahead of me on the non-connected characters. I'm working on a set of leading strokes that can attach to the first letter in a word, as well as a set of characters sans connecter. There are certain characters that work well without a following connector: an occasional x or t&ndash;s's can be nice too. If I do get around to adding the unconnected series, I'll tie the left connecterless to the right connecterless with OT. <BR> <BR>I have been thinking about some more ink spatter and I've settled on using &quot;spatter alternates.&quot; Since the current implementation of OT doesn't allow for inserted characters, I'll have to attach the spatters to different characters. What I'm doing so far is placing the spatters so that they will end up to the far left or right of the spatter alternate (or even show up on another line). This way, the spatters will be connected to random characters. The trick is planning the spatters so they look good where they happen to land. <BR> <BR>Of course, I'm still adding more alternate caps. I've got three different SC sets. I'm starting to resign myself to the fact that I can't get the randomness perfect with OT. The typographer will have to add a few alternates here and there to polish it off, but at least they'll have plenty to choose from. (See the small caps in the last sample: I've added alternates by hand.)</div>

You would also want to make sure that no two letters were ever the same right next to each other. There are only so many of those that happen regularly in English, so I have added specific substitution rules for each of those cases (ee ff gg ll mm nn oo, etc.) Also notice that I have placed an @letter between the @random character. This makes the pattern even more difficult to spot. You might notice the funky h after every t, but you wouldn't notice the funky h after t-anycharacter, (unless you were freaking crazy). <BR> <BR>In the case of this font, the fact that there are a different set of characters to connect to the o b v w also helps the font appear more random. The randomness feature above needs to be adjusted to get the connectors right for this one, which makes it more complicated. To be honest, I haven't completely figured it out.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Very, very impressive. Christian, it is so cool to go back through these forums and watch a brand new high-quality type library unfold inside less than five years. You are truly talented. Your designs just keep getting better and better. <BR> <BR>I worked with Erik van Blokland (Letterror) a few years ago on something similar for the OT implementation of his Kosmik design. Every glyph (including accents and punctuation!) had three variants. We overloaded the Contextual Alternates feature to simulate ideal flipping behavior as best we could. But as you widen the &quot;search radius&quot; the feature code grows geometrically in size. We learned yet another way to crash InDesign. <BR> <BR>I am hoping that the good folks at Adobe and MS will do the necessary programming to add true flipping capability to their layout engines and support the RAND feature, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/features_pt.htm#rand">described here</a> in the OT spec. Then Contextual Alternates can be freed up to do its real job in fonts (like yours) where you do have truly contextual alternates like your loopy d. (&quot;pendant&quot;) <BR> <BR>It would not hurt for a font developer like yourself to drop a line to the Powers That Be at Adobe and second these requests to the InDesign/CoolType programming teams. Especially with one of these PDF samples of your font in action.</div>

<p>I&rsquo;m hoping that someone can help me.  I&rsquo;ve purchased the OpenType version of the font from Veer and I&rsquo;m having trouble with it in Photoshop CS.</p>
<p>All of the options in the type menu are greyed out for Dear Sarah, while Adobe Caslon Pro has the ability to check/uncheck ligatures, ordinals, etc.</p>
<p>Please help&hellip;</p>
