  body: "Thanks for the link Eben\u2013I love those old carved letters from Europe.
    \r\n\r\nIf you ever have a chance, make sure to spend some time in Arles, France.
    It's one of the oldest towns in Europe, there was a massive Roman necropolis there
    for centuries, and they have hundreds of amazing tombstones on display in the
    museum as well as the Necropolis itself. The quality of the carved lettes is excellent,
    but what really impressed me is that those Roman carvers managed to cook of dozens
    of amazing ligatures that will have a typographer drooling. "

    that take place there and it sounds like a wonderful place to be if you wish to

  body: "Tiff, \r\n\r\nI looked for images from Arles on Google & Flickr - no luck
    so far finding detailed images from the cemetary. I agree that flickr is a great
    resource to see what a place actually looks like (When there are photos of that
    place).\r\n\r\nTim, \r\n\r\nI don't know that the date you see there is the date
    that the text was inscribed. That date might be when something else happened.
    If you have a question about a specific image I can attempt to recall where it
    is in Rome and then you could maybe find an authority on the subject or from the
    museum it came from to sort it out for you. At least half of the images are from
    the Epigraphical Department at the Palazzo Massimo (MUSEO NAZIONALE ROMANO). Some
    of the images come from the Palazzo Altemps (MUSEO NAZIONALE ROMANO) too. I have
    been looking for the way you might contact them but I haven't found the answer
    yet. Sorry I don't have more than that. I thought about shooting the descriptions
    but the light was not too good in there & I was jealous of my chip space. Also
    my wife was already being very patient that day... The reason I was taking them
    is that I was interested in having them to study for a project I am working on
    - and to share. I saw a book on the epigraphical collection at the Palazzo Massimo.
    Looking online I am unable to find it. It may be too new or have a very limited
    printing. Unfortunately the Museums don't have an online gift shop or much of
    an online presence. "

  body: In your 'essentailly entertainment' it was my ( and I think Tiff's) impression
    that you meant entertainment as opposed to information. My comment about candid
    shot was an example of that utilty. I have a pal who shares your feelings about
    memories. He feels like photos essentailly take the place of memories if you let
    them or even if you try not to let them. So he is kinda photo hostile. There is
    something to this idea of course. But I can't let it stop me from enjoying photos.
    Also, I suspect that some folks are more suceptible to a negative photo effect,
    just like some people faint more easily, laugh or get angry more easily, or get
    drunk more easily, or are emotionally effected by weather than others. Having
    a dad who was photo-manical can also tweak your feelings I bet. But your originally
    was that the REAL south of france should not be confused with the photos- no?

    At the Egyptian city of Naucratis, there was a famous old god, whose name was
    Theuth; the bird which is called the Ibis is sacred to him, and he was the inventor
    of many arts, such as arithmetic and calculation and geometry and astronomy and
    draughts and dice, but his great discovery was the use of letters.</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>Now
    in those days the god Thamus was the king of the whole country of Egypt; and he
    dwelt in that great city of Upper Egypt which the Hellenes call Egyptian Thebes,
    and the god hiimself is called by them Ammon. To him came Theuth and how his inventions,
    desiring that the other Egyptians might be allowed to have the benefit of them;
    he enumerated them, and Thamus enquired about their several uses, and praised
    some of them and censured others, as he approved or disapproved of them. It would
    take a long time to repeat all that Thamus said to Theuth in praise or blame of
    the various arts.</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>But when it came to letters, This, said
    Theuth, will make the Egyptians wiser and give them better memories; it is a specific
    both for the memory and for the wit. Thamus replied:</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>\u201CO
    most ingenius Theuth, the parent or inventor of an art is not always the best
    judge of the utility or inutility of his own inventions to the users of them.
    And in this instance, you who are the father of letters, from a paternal love
    of your own children have been led to attribute to them a quality which they cannot
    have; for this discovery of yours will create forgetfulness in the learners\u2019
    souls, because they will not use their memories; they will trust to the external
    written characters and not remember of themselves. The specific which you have
    discovered is not an aid to memory, but to reminiscence, and you give your disciples
    not truth, but only the semblance of truth; they will be hearers of many thing
    and will have learned nothing; they will appear to be omniscient and will generally
    know nothing; they will be tiresome company, having the show of wisdom without
    the reality.\u201D</cite>\r\n\r\nNegation is beautiful if there is some reality
    left after sweeping."
