  body: "It's Pistilli Roman, which hasn't yet been digitized. Phil Martin's <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=UR.109805.0.0\">Didoni</a>
    is a close copy, but the digital version's hairlines are not nearly as thin. \r\n\r\nPhil's
    version was not a straight knock-off. He added a bunch of swash and alternate
    characters. Ironically, Phil's contributions are missing from the URW digitization,
    so what you get is essentially just a knock-off of Pistilli Roman."
