body: "Hi, kind of a type ID request. I'm looking for typefaces that are similar in
  vein to the \"Chocolat\" script part of Hotel Chocolat, but aren't obviously the
  same. It would be very much appreciated if anybody could steer me in the direction
  of some \"nice\" cursive /script typefaces.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n1981\r\n\r\n\t\r\nhttp://typophile.com/files/hc.gif\r\n"
