    it wasn&#39;t ment to be, is the way this type becomes a colour &#40;gray&#41;
    of its own.  <BR>Interesting would to combine this with a text type. In which
    you experiment with the width and the distance between the &#39;lines&#39;.  <BR>You
    could even try to make a family with for example 9 wheights &#40;10% gray, 20%
    gray, etc....&#41; <BR> <BR>Jacques '

    and useful. Splendid. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t see anything wrong with the &#39;4&#39;,
    but I&#39;d  <BR>like to see a &#39;y&#39; with a tail like the &#39;g&#39;s tail.

  body: ' thanks so much for the replies <BR> <BR>Jacques - I don&#39;t believe I
    fully understand what you&#39;re saying - but what I think are your ideas are
    interesting - I&#39;d imagine transposing the &#39;texture&#39; of this font under
    a different / more typical screen font could maybe lead to some surprises. <BR>
    <BR>the font came from a few different ideas, most prevalent was the old DOS boot-up
    screen font; I&#39;m pretty sure that has the same &#39;scanline&#39; look to
    it.  also old fonts that worked w/ dot matrix printers... anyway there&#39;s gotta
    be at least a few fonts like this already in existence... like rodolfo&#39;s ;&#41;
    <BR> <BR>found the limitations in making this font to be interesting though, which
    is pretty much why I made it.. I definitely agree with you stephen about the &#39;y&#39;...
    sticks out like a sore thumb actually <BR> <BR>again thanks very much for your
    comments and ideas.  it means a lot, I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing :D <BR>

    fonts that combine in different colors or something... Wazzat? <BR> <BR>Hrant,
    that &#39;font&#39; was done in fact for print. It <BR>was a set of pseudo-bitmaps
    I designed to use in <BR>a poster. The idea was that odd and even &#34;vertical
    <BR>scanlines&#34; were differently colored - but with some <BR>&#34;pixels&#34;
    out of place according to letter structure <BR>&#40;in the case of the typographica
    banner, &#42;many&#42; <BR>pixels&#41;. This construction principle allowed different
    <BR>shapes to emerge. I think I have an image of the <BR>thing as it was used
    somewhere. If I find it, I&#39;ll <BR>post it. V2000 was a codename &#40;the poster
    was <BR>called &#34;Ver&atilde;o 2000&#34;, which means &#34;Summer 2000&#34;.&#41;'

    One thing I appreciate the most is that while it may qualify as a bitmap font
    by construction, because of it&#39;s color it is very readable as well as legible
    due to the fact that it does have a somewhat humanist bent. Very nice. -- As for
    usage, what about mobile phones or PDAs? '
