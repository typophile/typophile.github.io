  a scan from that great book \"Encyclopaedia of Typefaces\" by Jaspert, Berry & Johnson.\r\n\r\nAs
  you can see from the scan its named \"Robur\", attributed to Deberney & Peignot
  c.1912\r\n\r\nAny help much appreciated\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\nTom\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cc_5937.jpg]"
