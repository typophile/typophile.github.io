  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I am currently working on a project to identify a kind or style of typography that is used for a specific application or has a cultural association. I am working with the use of interlocking or connecting letterforms and scripts that often appear in Italian industrial design but specifically on espresso machines.</p>
<p>I have begun my research and found some interesting information on the history of espresso machines in Italy. I have also looked into some of the books by Louise Fili about Italian typography/scripts. However I am still looking for more information and thought to cast a wider net. I have plenty of examples but am now looking for articles and writing that discuss this topic or topics close to it. I am trying to figure out where this trend comes from. Is it related to Italian futurism? Is it mostly to do with the ease of construction for the metal nameplates?</p>
<p>I did find a foundry called [[http://holidaytype.com|Holiday Type]] that has revived or created typefaces that are reminiscent of the style I am talking about. I am having trouble finding out who is behind their designs though? Does anyone know who is the creator of these fonts? I wrote to Dharma Type, but does anyone know if they are behind the designs? I thought the creator might be of help.</p>
<p>I am also wondering if these kinds of scripts have a specific name or term.</p>
<p>I know this is vague, but I so appreciate any help, resources or insight. I have been doing quite a bit of research but just thought asking a larger and more educated community might help me find some new avenues to explore.</p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks, that is really helpful! I keep hoping I am going to find something that relates this kind of typeface to Italy, but I might be searching for something that does not exist.</p>
<p>Ryoichi Tsunekawa from Dharma Type did write me back and gave me some useful information about his set of fonts, and they were mostly inspired by Italian signage during a vacation he took in Naples.</p>

The Chromeography link on the same page has nice pics too.
&ldquo;chrome scripts&rdquo; and &ldquo;connected scripts&rdquo;  are probably the terms you want to web search for.</div>
