    dedicated pages.\r\nThere is an essay or two, mostly based around his work, I
    would like to find some things about his family or something about what his personality
    was like."

  body: 'Well, there are a few books in my school that i was going through but i couldn''t
    find anything on him. That is why I made this post :) If anyone has read anything
    about him in books, I wanna know what books. I know that the information exists,
    I just wanna know where before I spent 18 hours walking around looking through
    anything and everything. '

  body: "Ask your librarian if the school has access to the <em>Design and Applied
    Arts Index</em>, a database that covers many art and design magazines that are
    not covered in most library databases. The DAAI made my research much easier in
    school and it is growing at very rapid pace. If your school doesn\u2019t offer
    it, find a library that does and request (through the head of the design department)
    that the school get access to this database ASAP. "

  body: "I was just saying it because students these days tend to quickly jump to
    the internet and only the internet. I'm a student myself, and I use the internet
    mainly as a means to start a search for information, and after that extend this
    search into books and magazines (and newspapers). We are actually <em>required</em>
    to use books, and we usually have to quote parts from the books we use so the
    teacher verify it if he wants.\r\n\r\nAlthough, of course, the internet can be
    really good to find information about things that are happening at this very moment."

  body: In addition to Tiffany's Google link (above), which has some useful online
    articles, you can also try looking up Erik Nitsche on Amazon. You will get <a
    href="http://www.amazon.com/s/qid=1236901498/ref=sr_pg_1?ie=UTF8&rs=1000&keywords=Erik%20Nitsche&rh=i%3Astripbooks%2Ck%3AErik%20Nitsche&page=1">a
    list of books</a> in which he is either mentioned or listed as author/contributor.
    But your best bet, as others have already said, is going to the library.

  body: "Thank you folks. I had no luck with the library at school. Mun has a library
    on campus and I've heard it has quite a few more books then my school... \r\nAlrhough,
    I read that Nitsche really didn't talk about his work, so maybe that has something
    to do with the lack of information on the net. But the essay is done and done
    well. \r\nJames, I'm going to check that out first thing in the morning. I would
    love access to that. Thanks again b'y's. :D"
