  body: The first thing that comes to mind is <a href=http://sudtipos.com/fonts2.htm>Sudtipos</a>
    type foundry. They're an Argentinian foundry and have a number of their fonts
    available from Veer.com. Many of their types have both a great Latin feel and
    a certain cool, vintage quality - seems like a good match for your product. A
    ton of their fonts would be a nice match, but the ones that appeal to me are Argenta,
    Candombe, Murga, Plumera, Suave, Sudestada, and Titanes. Although it doesn't especially
    match your look, I want to mention Affair, too - I bought it recently, and I think
    I'm in love (with OpenType alternates, of course)!

  body: "Two other nice ones: <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/pampatype/rayuela/>Rayuela</a>
    by PampaType (interesting in that it's like a straightened italic, in the vein
    of Jeremy Tankard's <a href=http://www.typography.net/type/aspect.htm>Aspect</a>)
    and <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/smeltery/sans-merci/>Sans Merci</a> by
    SMeltery, which, though French, has a certain funky flavor. The M is too out there
    for me, though.\r\n\r\nEdit: Make that <em>three:</em> I forgot about Christian
    Schwartz's <a href=http://www.emigre.com/EF.php?fid=102>Los Feliz</a>. Nice and
    quirky, but might be too familiar feeling if the clothes are sold in L.A."
