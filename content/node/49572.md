body: "An elegant new typeface suitable for setting books and magazines. <a href=\"http://www.typotheque.com/fonts/brioni/\">Brioni</a>
  developed spontaneously from practice with a broad-nib pen, but the result is a
  hybrid of calligraphic influences and subtle manipulation of the stroke terminals.
  Available also as <a href=\"http://www.typotheque.com/fonts/brioni_text/\">Brioni
  Text</a>, a sturdy slab serif for text of all sizes, but especially suitable for
  fine print. A highly functional typeface family that is easy to work with and inviting
  to read. Designed by Nikola Djurek, distributed by <a href=\"http://www.typotheque.com/\">Typotheque.com</a>.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/brioni_text_4096.png]"
