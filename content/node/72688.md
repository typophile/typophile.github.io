  body: "Not Telegrafico, Futura Serie BQ-Medium or Futura Serie BQ-Medium SC are
    very close, not quite on as the R and the M don't quite match, but everything
    else is extraordinarily similar.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/futura-serie-bq/medium-sc/\">Sample</a>\r\n\r\nMust
    be a member of that family.\r\n\r\n[EDIT] I'm thinking Futura Classic Normal was
    right, all the glyphs match as I look at them. [/EDIT]"

  body: "Thanks everyone!\r\nI agree that this would seem to be a Futura variant of
    sorts, with a non-Futural R, and some other bits that look a little, well, odd.
    The proportions seem slightly unusual, maybe that's what kept me thinking it's
    not a Futura. The Futura BQ-Medium SC is a good suggestion though. Much appreciated!"

  body: "Any time. I'd honestly say that the font is too smooth-edged to be Metallophile
    or Tempo, I'm nearly positive it's a somewhat customized version of Futura Classic
    Normal\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/wiescherdesign/futura-classic/normal/\">Sample</a>\r\n\r\nBut
