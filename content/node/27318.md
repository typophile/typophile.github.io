body: Hi, am new here, i wonder what is the best software for rendering images to
  vector lines with the minimum points possible? i design fonts using CorelDRAW then
  i export to EPS for use in FontLab, but now i want to draw glyphs on paper then
  get them in vector format with fine traces? any idea please?

  body: Illustrator's <em>live trace</em> feature does a very good job with the initial
    trace and also allows for experimentation. After using <em>live trace</em> you
    ccould use the <em>simplify path</em> feature which could or could not do what
    you need depending upon your initital design.

  body: "I would not recommend any kind of auto-tracing task for creating the vector-based
    parts of any glyph.\r\n\r\nPerhaps one can make an exception for type designs
    that have an intentionally rough look, such as a dry-brushed script or \"antiqued\"
    letter.\r\n\r\nUltimately if you want the minimum number of points possible then
    you have to hand-digitize them. Items like extrema points (where the direction
    handles extend in absolute vertical or horizontal directions) need to be used
    whenever possible. You're not going to get that sort of thing through auto tracing
    and auto reductions on points."

    relatively new to typedesign (like myself) would be interested in the answer.

    heard about this before, i think in the context of creating new weights through
    mixing (morphing?) a light with a bold cut (simplified). if not because of this,
    why? a little explanation of the reasons and the goals would be nice!"

  body: "When you use extrema points, while also keeping point count at a bare minimum,
    it actually makes it easier to tweak and alter glyphs and stay consistent about
    it.\r\n\r\nUsing extrema points will also give you better results on autohinting
    within FontLab or Fontographer. The generated fonts will be interpreted better
    in Postscript or TrueType standards.\r\n\r\nFont editors will allow you to \"recalculate\"
    a glyph to change point location to the extreme edge of a curve and have direction
    handles pulled to extrema horizontal or vertical directions. But that process,
    like auto-tracing, can be hit and miss. It's better to draw the points in extrema
    when the original glyph is being designed.\r\n\r\nNaturally you're not always
    going to be able to use extrema points. For certain curve shapes you're going
    to need more anchor points to get the kind of shape you want.\r\n\r\nThe best
    drawn fonts all use extrema points whenever possible and use the least amounts
    of points as well. This standard of drawing is one of the easiest traits in telling
    the difference between a professionally digitized typeface versus some low quality
    font available from many free font websites."

    body: "Thanks Mr Henderson, Tiffany and Kesh..\r\nWell, am not that pro but i
      think the extrema points won't work with my fonts as i mostly design Arabic
      fonts: <a href=\"http://hacen.net/fonts\">HacenType</a>, so what i need is to
      find a good way to reveal the original design on paper to a vector shape, i
      tried ScanFont from FontLab with lower trace results.. Even tracing in Illsutrator
      and CorelDRAW ain't that good deal.. I hope if i could find some easy-to-use
      steps for novices on how to improve scaned letters to be digitally mastered."

  body: "Bobby's point about using extrema points where possible should work as well
    for Arabic as well as Latin fonts (and basically any bezier type work), the best
    way to achieve that is to scan your hand rendering at a large resolution and then
    draw over the top.\r\nThis workshop might provide some insight\r\nhttp://www.typeworkshop.com/index.php?id1=type-basics&id2=&id3=&id4=&id5=&idpic=15#pictloader\r\n\r\nTim"

    the digital outline as a tool and draw the letters on the screen. Or after you
    scan them, edit them in a program like FontLab.\r\n\r\nand \"Items like extrema
    points (where the direction handles extend in absolute vertical or horizontal
    directions) need to be used whenever possible.\"\r\n\r\n...if the target is low
    resolution output and hinting is intended to be used. \r\n\r\n"
