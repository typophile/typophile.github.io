body: "Hey everybody,\r\n\r\nI'm quite pleased with the lowercase, caps and figures
  in Expletus-sans so I figured it was time to move on. Here are some of the glyphs
  I've made. Please don't pay to much to much attention to the spacing or kerning.
  Instead I suggest you focus on colour and style. Hope it's not too bad ;-). I also
  included a pdf for print. In this critique section are also Expletus-Sans diacritics
  and Expletus-Sans. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJasper de Waard\r\n\r\nedit: This is the complete
  Character Set for Expletus Sans Basic. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/expletus-sans-cs_5690.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/expletus-sans-cstext_4480.jpg]"

  body: "This is going very well, Jasper. Some small observations:\r\n\r\n<strong>1</strong>.
    Hyphen position is fine for use with uppercases, but somewhat high for lowercases.
    It may also be a bit wider.\r\n\r\n<strong>2</strong>. In Maths, braces are used
    outside brackets and parenthesis. So, they must appear a bit larger (vertically)
    than these to give an \"embracing\" effect and keep they hierarchy clear. Your
    braces does not seem larger than brackets (although having the same height) because
    they resemble the parenthesis curve very much. I believe a less round shape and
    a slight larger height would improve them.\r\n\r\n<strong>3</strong>. Equal position
    is also a bit high.\r\n\r\nQuotes at \"What are inverted, but I guess this is
    because you just included right double quotes at this point."

  body: "Thanks Freiberger. \r\n1. I'll (yet again) use Myriad for the positioning
    of my hyphen, equal and plus. \r\n2. Good to know. I searched the internet for
    a lot of these glyphs, but I gues I missed this. \r\n3. That's a naturl consequenc
    of the hyphen being to high. \r\n\r\nI'll include smart quotes in my sample next
    time."

  body: "So, as you can see, U uploaded two new images of the now completed Charcter
    Set of Expletus Sans Basic. I decided to keep the braces the same, since most
    typefaces I opened in Fontlab had them alligned like Expletus. Instead of lowering
    = + - I used lining numerals instead of oldstyle. If there's anything important
    missing or you see any faults, please comment. Do bear in mind that this only
    the Basic version of Expletus Sans. The later Pro version, will be much more extensive.\r\n\r\nCheers.
    Jasper de Waard"

  body: "I think that when I'm done with the pro version without hebrew, I'll be so
    fed up of Expletus Sans, that I won't want to spend anymore time learning hebrew
    typedesign. I'll probably make a hebrew typeface in the future, but probably not
    Expletus Sans. But thanks for your enthousiasm. Expletus Sans regular + bold will
    be in the Google font directory in 2-3 weeks and Igino Marini from iKern will
    do the spacing and kerning.\r\n\r\nCheers"

  body: Wow. This is the second time someone's asking me where they can get my fonts.
    As brian alread said it will be in the Google font directory in 2-3 weeks free.
    It's a bit hidden but the google font firectory does allow direct download of
    the otf file. I will also make a pro version which will be released later. Thanks
    guys!
