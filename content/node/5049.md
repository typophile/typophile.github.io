  <BR> <BR>Or do you design to fit a particular foundry you desire to be represented

    that I design for her/him, like Nick I design for myself, to try things out, to
    challenge the way we read and speak and to get my ideas out of the system. I sell
    my own stuff, so I don&#39;t have to make my designs fit a certain profile, which

    doing them? Simply to &#60;em&#62;show them off&#60;/em&#62; seems a silly reason.
    <BR> <BR>When you are starting to design a typeface, I&#39;m sure even the slightest
    of intentions is worked into it, whether you are thinking &#34;This would look
    bitchin&#39; on a billboard&#34; or &#34;I&#39;m sure a designer can run this
    at 4 pt and still be legible&#34;. There has to be the slightest of intent to
    appeal to somebody '

  body: I&#39;ll bite Armin . . . <BR> <BR>I design type first for me, second for
    the masses &#40;anybody with a computer and a credit card who likes fonts&#41;.
    I feel completely indulgent in my profession and in the back of my mind I honestly
    do think I can&#39;t wait for other people to see and use these fonts and hope
    they think they are as cool as I do. <BR> <BR>I want my fonts to inspire people.
    <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t care if they use the fonts for personal birthday party invites
    or cereal boxes. I want people to see the fonts in use and feel a connection to
    the fonts and the message being communicated to them. <BR> <BR>I think as an art
    director for many years I felt there was this &#39;ultimate&#39; consumer I was
    designing for - straight up demographics &#40;Female 24-37, Income . . .&#41;.
    Then i tried to get into their heads and invent people to design ads to and it
    left me very empty. <BR> <BR>Once I started making type, I started having more
    satisfaction in my work because I felt, if every designer in the world starts
    using my fonts, in 10 years my porfolio is going to hit the millions. &#40;I&#39;m
    not so concerned about my portfolio these days&#41; <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t need
    to design every ad in the world and honestly have no desire to, there are people
    who are better than me and really love making ads. BUT, if I can make better typefaces
    for designers and consumers to use and see in use, I feel I am enabling better
    communication with my talents instead of working up headlines with a copyrighter
    and doing tons of layouts through the night. <BR> <BR>I recently wrote in an editorial
    piece that I think we&#39;re living in a more typographically aware world than
    say 10 years ago. Mark my words in a few years time don&#39;t be surprised to
    see our intimate type community explode into the mainstream. <BR> <BR>Stuart :D

  body: 'Armin, great question. <BR> <BR>I think the first thing to note here is that
    retail type design is so unlikely to provide a sufficient and steady income to
    most individuals that it does in fact make sense that so many people &#34;indulge&#34;
    in it. Some of those people make their living with custom type work &#40;which
    is generally less rewarding &#34;spiritually&#34;&#41;, or in a totally different
    field. The net result is that the designs are very &#34;divergent&#34; in terms
    of utility: they are unlikely to be best-sellers, but some people will have wet
    dreams &#40;personal joke intentional ;-&#41; over some of them. It&#39;s more
    like Art, and some people &#40;like me&#41; actually have a problem with that,
    since I have to question how that serves other people. Designing to answer some
    funky personal riddle or whatever seems a bit too bourgeois for me.  :-&#41; I
    already have a BMW - I&#39;m bourgeois enough! <BR> <BR>Personally, when I design
    a font &#34;out of the blue&#34; I <i>try</i> to make it something end-users,
    more than designers, <i>need</i> - and simply hope that there are designers out
    there who think the same way, and want to deliver that same kind of typography
    to their &#34;users&#34;, so they end up needing that certain kind of font. I&#39;m
    not claiming that I do this because I&#39;m a noble person or something, it&#39;s
    probably simply due to my nature &#40;which is out of my hands&#41; - I enjoy
    satisfying other people &#40;although maybe only if they&#39;re &#34;in tune&#34;
    with me&#41;. So for example I made the Akhakalak Georgian font because I saw
    that the Georgian script is too wide, and wanted to give people a display face
    that would set narrow, like on bottle labels for their wonderful wines. And when
    I made Nour &#40;Armenian&#41; you could say I targeted even beyond what Armenian
    users think they need, or what they say they want: I targeted what I think Armenian
    typography needs now. And once in a while I run into a designer who &#34;gets
    it&#34; and enthusiastically pays me to get a copy of it. It&#39;s sort of like
    a cultural crusade. <BR> <BR>The other thing that turns me on though is solving
    technical issues with new fonts, like pushing the limits of readability, or fighting
    lo-fi repro. That&#39;s the engineer in me. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: 'Thanks Hrant and Stuart. Those are the kind of things that are intriguing.
    Being a graphic designer, it is very clear for me who I design for: I design for
    my client&#39;s clients but I give them the impression that I&#39;m designing
    for them &#40;the direct clients&#41;. So I basically have two clients, or targets,
    I have to please. However, for type designers it does seem a bit more vague and
    fluctuating from one type designer to the next. <BR> <BR>Do you ever listen to
    graphic designers&#39; opinions on what typefaces they like and why the choose
    one over another? We are a snobbish and bitchy bunch, so I can understand why
    sometimes our opinions could be shunned. <BR> <BR>Do you react to trends? If retro

  body: This is an intriguing question. When I was a student I wanted to design a
    typeface for my senior BFA project. Two different instructors had differing opinions
    about how I should proceed. One suggested I create a hypothetical client or a
    design problem to solve and therefore be better able to measure the success of
    the project. The other instructor took the opposite view, suggesting I design
    it for me and let it be more of a personal expression. <BR> <BR>&#40;I&#39;d encourage
    any design student with the hankering for type to try it out. I&#39;m no type
    designer, but that exercise has made me much more comfortable pushing type around,
    experimenting and questioning the norms.&#41; <BR> <BR>I believe there is room
    for both approaches. If it weren&#39;t for the personal expression we wouldn&#39;t
    have typefaces like <a href="http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/font_frames.tpl?cart=1086330099122010&amp;fontname=Amplitude"
    target="_blank">Amplitude</a> or <a href="http://www.emigre.com/dp/getfontpage.php?PTarWR.html"

    types, but you can&#39;t deny the place commissioned faces have on the typo-landscape.

    their original exclusivity has expired&#41;. The list is endless, and the innovations
    on the utilitarian front are huge. That can&#39;t always be said of more personal
    designs. <BR> <BR>Ahem, now I&#39;ll shutup and let the type designers speak.

  body: I work in advertising during the day and have to adjust my designs to client&#39;s
    needs and wants. At night I design type and I can honestly say that I don&#39;t
    think of a target audience and how to please them, if my design pleases someone,
    it&#39;s fine.  <BR>I&#39;d like to compare it to the music industry, I generally
    feel more for music that&#39;s been made because the artist wanted it that way
    rather than music that has a target audience, the same with movies. You could
    argue that my approach is too artistic, and you&#39;d probably be right, but that&#39;s
    the way I work. I try to move people with my design, influence them and push them
    around, I don&#39;t think I could do that if I gave in to their wants. <BR> <BR>I
    listen to designers opinions, but I only hear these opinion after the font has
    been published. I do, however,sometimes  add characters to fonts if designers
    need a special character, but that&#39;s more like customer service than design.
    <BR> <BR>Whether we like it or not we all react to trends, some designers more
    knowingly than others.

  body: Yes good question. <BR>I can only answer it not in a WHO, but a HOW way. <BR>
    <BR>When I think of designing for an audience, I accept that all I know are my
    own experiences, my own emotions and reactions, my own understanding of history.
    To believe that I was designing for anyone else would; <BR>a&#41; leave me feeling
    unable to judge the success of the work, <BR>b&#41; cause me to try and be someone
    else/pretend to be looking with soemone else&#39;s eyes. I dont thing this is
    possible. <BR> <BR>My career has been the EDUCATION of MY perception and taste,
    which for me, is the diversified understanding and empathy with the arts of the
    world that interest me. Of course I&#39;m open to dilettantism. <BR> <BR>For example,
    if I were to design a typeface for a French newspaper, I would not only educate
    myself about the French language and it&#39;s peculiatities, but also try to connect
    with that part of ME that empathizes with the bits of French culture I&#39;ve
    experienced. <BR> <BR>There is also something in designing a typeface that is
    about the continuation of a craft/art form. Could this be expressed as designing
    for all the typedesigners that have gone before you? It sounds pretentious, but
    I thing there&#39;s something in it.

    <BR>What kind of typefaces people will want to use in around 5 years? I have no
    answer to that, specially because the answer must be different by cultural area.
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not able to imagine that Din will be a so great success, when
    i have see it in its redesigned version on FF catalog years ago. Consider also
    that is not because a typeface is beautiful or whatsoever, that it will be successful.
    There is so many side elements, presence in software bundle, size of the distributor,
    etc. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think that Times or Arial/Helv. success is due to the
    design, just because they are widely available for decennies. <BR> <BR> <BR>When
    designing for retail market, the decisions are purely personal, based on virtual
    problem to resolve. When designing for a client, obviously, I built my answer
    to his brief, needs, that generally he can&#39;t explain with typographical vocabulary.
    <BR> <BR>In booths case, the result still very personal, like a photographer or
    an illustrator style.'

    a neat idea or is looking for a font they haven&#39;t seen. Case in point I&#39;m
    working on an old school tattoo font for the next collection that I wouldn&#39;t

    glad they&#39;ve caught on :D - To answer your question, when I select specimens
    that I plan to flesh out into complete fonts, I very much look at them and try
    to figure out if they have enough commercial marketability to be made or not.
    I also have a visual dictionary of typefaces in my brain which steers me away
    from making something that&#39;s already out there. I think it&#39;s important
    to react only to ones own intuition. <BR> <BR>Stuart :D

    will most likely not see it the same way I do and will have their own ideas about
    how to use it, often in ways I never anticipated. So I try to focus on the type
    itself, how it relates to other typefaces, its formal qualities like texture,
    themes, balance, optical effects, how these things are carried out over a family,
    etc. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s a bit like creating a musical instrument rather than a
    piece of music. Sometimes you have a pretty good idea how it might be used &#40;like

  body: Hrant, not doing formal market research is not the same as ignoring other
    people. <BR> <BR>When developing retail fonts, I work by hunch, as I said. I think
    that&#39;s a better way to connect with other creatives than by market research,
    which is a CAPITALIST EVIL by which I do not intend to be &#34;guided&#34;.

  body: I tend to align myself with Nicks post from the perspective that the &#39;graphic
    designers&#39; of the world are not my target audience. <BR> <BR>As I mentioned
    earlier on, anybody with a computer is my audience and if they&#39;ve become saavy
    enough to educate themselves about typography and fonts enough to look for and
    purchase fonts, why should I spend time developing a product to suit one industry
    when I know people come into typography from all walks of life. <BR> <BR>Education
    vehicles such as scrapbooking and general internet and computer usage have made
    it easier to motivate non-designers to explore our field so I prefer to develop
    a product that is inclusive of my entire audience instead of suiting a very focused
    group. <BR> <BR>Stuart :D

  body: I tend to think that even for an individual designer, the &#34;target audience&#34;
    may vary from one typeface to the next. <BR> <BR>To date, I have almost always
    designed first for myself. I want to be satisfied with what I have made. If it&#39;s
    saleable and Adobe is willing to pick it up, so much the better. But I won&#39;t
    count on it. <BR> <BR>Now, I can easily see me getting into the state of doing
    a first rough prototype of some letters, and showing it around to see if there&#39;s
    much possibility that Adobe would pick it up. If not, I might switch to another
    project, unless I was particularly excited about the one I had just started. <BR>
    <BR>My current type family started because one of Adobe&#39;s product teams complained
    about Adobe&#39;s then-new font bundling policy. We now only bundle fonts that
    Adobe owns 100%. They had wanted Futura, but now they couldn&#39;t have it, and
    we didn&#39;t have any other geometric sans serif they could use. <BR> <BR>That
    got me to thinking that it was interesting that there were no geometric sans faces
    that Adobe owned outright. Although I&#39;ve done a couple of dozen families to
    the prototype stage or beyond over the years, I&#39;d never tried a geometric
    sans serif. So I decided to give it a whirl. <BR> <BR>One of the interesting things
    about type design is that at some point you discover that the typeface has its
    own &#34;voice&#34;; listening intently to that voice is a key part of type design,
    IMO. Certain elements or letters in the typeface may turn out to be the touchstones
    of the work. If you come up with something that does not go with those elements,
    or doesn&#39;t match well with a touchstone letter, no matter how clever or beautiful
    it is, it will have to go. <BR> <BR>Sometimes the voice of the typeface turns
    out to be rather different than what one had in mind when the project started.
    For instance, my intended geometric sans works better than I had expected/intended
    at text sizes, and is neither strictly geometric nor even entirely sans serif,
    as it turns out.&#42; &#40;Though I think it has remained on track in other aspects
    of my self-generated design brief.&#41; <BR> <BR>&#42; I may not be alone in this
    one. I gather that Goudy Sans was the result of a foundry asking Goudy to make
    them a competitor to Futura. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T <BR> <BR>P.S. Typing
    with one hand is hard.

  body: Thomas, was any research done as to whether Adobe users wanted Futura bundled
    with their software, or was it assumed by the product team that Futura was missing,
    or that this niche &#40;geometric sans&#41; should be filled? <BR> <BR>Can you
    give us some idea of the size of the target audience that receives these Adobe
    font bundles? <BR> <BR>

  body: The latter, afaik. Of course, if research is evil, that would be the &#34;right&#34;
    way to do it, no? <BR> <BR>As far as size of audience, it depends on the application.
    Something like Photoshop Album is mass market, Photoshop Elements reaches a huge
    &#34;prosumer&#34; audience, and then the mainstream professional graphics products
    &#40;Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign&#41; reach a smaller but still pretty large
    audience. Probably 95%&#43; of professional graphic designers and DTP production
    folks have at least one major Adobe application. <BR> <BR>In this particular example,
    I think the application whose comments sparked me to start the design was Photoshop
    Album, though I&#39;m not 100% sure. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T

    gaps is certainly research-free, and it appeals to the eclectic in me. But I&#39;m
    not sure whether it&#39;s a good idea for the independent. I would have a stronger
    brand identity if I specialized in a particular genre of type, and left it to
    the larger outfits to be all things to all people. <BR> <BR>Thomas, can you give
    us some idea of the number of people who receive font bundles with their software,

    of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or millions? <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>'

    are likely to work well for small foundries, and don&#39;t make sense for large
    ones. <BR> <BR>Units shipped per year, as a rough approximation, I think it would
    be tens of thousands for a program that is not selling very large numbers, hundreds
    of thousands for a professional graphics app that does very well, and millions
    for a prosumer app that does very well. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T
