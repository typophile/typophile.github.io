  in Porkys, so forgive me if this is in the wrong forum, but I was hoping someone
  could tell me how to replicate the exact effect. I've given it a shot in Photoshop
  using the Outer Glow effect, but I just can't hit the right settings.\r\n\r\nIf
  anyone could help me with a few details (program, settings, etc) it would be greatly
  appreciated!\r\n\r\nAgain, sorry this isn't strictly a Type ID situation.\r\n\r\nAnd,
  thank you!"
