  website since a while ago but this is my first ever post on this forum. I am curently
  working on a type project that requires technical knowledge that I currently lack.
  Maybe some of you guys can enlighten me. \r\n\r\nI'm in the process of creating
  a typeface but I'd like to find a way for the typeface to react to the content.
  \r\n\r\nFor example, the 5th occurences of each letter in a text or sentence will
  have a differently drawn glyph then other letters, so if the user writes this sentence
  : \"Are those shy Eurasian footwear, cowboy chaps, or jolly earthmoving headgear?\"
  the ''a'' from ''chaps'' and the second ''o'' from ''cowboy'' will use a different
  glyph then the stantard one because they appeared at the 5th occurences. \r\n\r\nI
  though something like that could be done with the opentype feature that detect if
  glyphs requires ligatures or not.\r\nI searched  on several others typographic ressources
  over the web and on softwares such as Fontographer or Glyph but I could'nt find
  anything relevant.\r\n\r\nIf anyone knows a way to do something like this or can
  propose a software that could help me produce such a thing that would be really
  awesome. \r\n\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nCharles\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n( please forgive my
  bad grammar, english is not my native language)\r\n"
