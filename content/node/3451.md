body: ' Hello to you all, <BR> <BR>I am a young romanian designer having a huge problem
  and I seem to be lost ... <BR>So, I get straight to the point: some of my major
  clients who went through a rebranding programmme are such large organisations that
  the only way to deal with stationery &#40;esp. Business Cards&#41; was to provide
  an .eps vector template. In order for it to work, it needed a font with Romanian
  characters that aren&#39;t available in most of the good-looking corporateID collateral
  appropriate fonts I have. <BR>In fact, with my last client, a major printhouse,
  I transformed LegacySans and LegacySerif into their corporate fonts, changing the
  name to match the company&#39;s name. Now, the T1 version of LegacySans works only
  in Illustrator and InDesign, &#40;where wheights appear under style&#41;, but not
  in Word or CorelDraw. The font is installed under Win2000, as ATM sees only two
  of the 4 styles. <BR> <BR>but the real problem is with LegacySerif, where, though
  it works equally well in Illustrator, Corel Word and so on, displaying the correct
  characters when addressed with Alt&#43;number, it fails to do so when the RO keyboard
  layout is on ... instead of such characters, I get rectangles. But if I change the
  layout to EN and back to RO, it starts to work out of blue ... hmmm <BR>could you
  please help me ... I really have to deliver the project on time <BR> <BR>thank you,
  <BR> <BR>george // cellsius design '
