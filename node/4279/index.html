  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi, <BR>I'm a student working on a logo for a personal identity project.  I'm attempting a playful, hand-drawn treatment of my name as a logo. Before I move on to using color, I am trying to address a couple of issues. <BR> <BR>First, something seems a little &quot;off&quot; about my letter forms. I cannot seem to put my finger on it, and I was hoping some of the more trained eyes here could help me out.  <BR> <BR>Secondly, I think the logo should be for 'Jason Yates Design&quot; not just &quot;Jason Yates&quot;, as just my name seems a little too personal. I would like to hear some thoughts on that, and if my treatment of the additional line of text is appropriate. <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/33432.gif" alt="personal logo"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Jason, I like the unifying quality that the common stroke has through A, T, and E, but it's easy to see &quot;Yales&quot; instead. Or &quot;Tates&quot; for that matter. <BR> <BR>You might want to further distinguish the Y by making the bowl of the J smaller or perhaps changing to a script-style (right-side spine) Y.  <BR> <BR>Had you considered making the lc &quot;ate&quot; more script-style, with a monocular a whose tail connected to the body of the t rather than the cross? You could connect the A and T at the baseline and the T and E using the cross.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think it makes much more sense to have the &quot;design&quot; as a font, to offset the playfulness of the &quot;Jason Yates&quot;. The former is a craft, the latter is a person, so that makes for a nicely expressed duality. And of the three you have up there, Eurostile is best, although it seems a bit too rigid (and too light). <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Jason &ndash; as a cartoonist, I have the feeling that your logo says cartoonist more than it does designer. Lettering is difficult to get just right and if you don't, you shoot yourself in the foot. Here are a couple of samples of very good lettering in the style you've used, though they are lighter in weight. Get the feeling for the complete alphabet and be careful of hooking letters together unless you can do it in a pleasing way. Witty is even better. I suppose I must say that these examples appear courtesy of the advertisers who commissioned them. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/33466.jpg" alt="baby oil"><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/33467.jpg" alt="Life Savers"></div>
