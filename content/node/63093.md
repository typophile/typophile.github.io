    is \"Photo-Peignot\", rather than 'plain'? Specially drawn for the Photo-Lettering
    house? At a glance, it seems a bit wider than the digital set I have.\r\n\r\nThe
    back cover list sure makes me drool. Must be from childhood memories, as all of
    these fonts were already deemed 'tacky' when I started typesetting. (Admittedly,
    it also could be my age.)"

    There are condensed and expanded widths in most settings. If you look just at
    the <cite>n</cite> width, does it seem wider than the Peignot many of us know
    and love from the titles of <cite>The Mary Tyler Moore Show</cite>?\r\n\r\n\u2014

  body: "Ah yes, I see what you mean: the little scribblings at the left, where the
    center samples are 'normal'.\r\n\r\nYup -- would love to get an OpenType set of
    this, with these other sets as 'size' variants -- or perhaps stylistic sets, or
    titling alternates. Come to think of it, that goes for the entire catalog. When
    is the next 70s revival due?"
