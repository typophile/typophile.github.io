<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Fear is the prospective name for a decorative font: <br><a href=http://www.dazeofourlives.com/fear.gif target=_top>http://www.dazeofourlives.com/fear.gif</a> <br>Obviously it is a work in progress. So far I have only come up with the HAMBURGERFONTS characters, plus "D". (I submitted it to ITC, but it was rejected.) <br>I'm very happy with the basic concept. I've never seen a font where the stroke essentially weaves in and out like this. Hopefully you can see the hand behind this work. It was not produced with a digital filter. <br>I'd be interested in any opinions. <br>Many thanks.</div>

<div class=commentbody> Nifty! In the smaller sizes it comes out great. I think you should make a number of weight and "jitteriness" variants. <br> <br>As for the name, I think maybe it's a bit too plain/descriptive. <br> <br>hhp </div>

<div class=commentbody> This is a cool effect, and the characters are suprisingly legible at all sizes. <br> <br>At risk of offending potential marketers of my own fonts, don't feel too badly about the fact that ITC rejected yours. I find many (not all) of ITC's fonts to be overly sterilized anyway. (As evidence, witness what they did to the Storm Typefoundry's beautiful Biblon typeface, or ITC "Garamond".) <br> <br>I suspect you'd do well with this font on MyFonts.com. <br> <br>I look forward to seeing more of the character set, including lower case characters. <br> <br>David Thometz </div>

<div class=commentbody>Thankyou both for your comments. <br>Here is a "light" version of Fear: <br><a href=http://www.dazeofourlives.com/fearlite.gif target=_top>http://www.dazeofourlives.com/fearlite.gif</a> <br>which WAS produced using a filter. (The Offset Path filter in Illustrator.) It's just for comparison really. The "levels of jitteriness" idea is very interesting. <br> <br>Re: ITC. I totally agree about their generally bland type collection. But they and they alone still pay the designer an upfront royalty for each font they publish. No other font publisher does this. <br>Personally - and this is probably not the right forum to discuss this - I have no idea how anyone except the elite type designers make any money from their craft. Every font is so labor intensive that it just doesn't make economic sense to pursue type design as anything more than a hobby. <br>So for me - if I'm not going to get a $2500 check from ITC in advance of sales - then why bother devoting hundreds of hours for the paltry sums I might get through other outlets? It works out to what - a dollar an hour? I cannot justify spending time on type design when I have bills to pay, etc. <br>Anyhow - sorry for the negative rant.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Martin, <br> <br>Bitstream makes a similar offer. <br> <br>See the PDF available at <br><a href=http://www.bitstream.com/categories/products/nfc/submit_index.html target=_top>http://www.bitstream.com/categories/products/nfc/submit_index.html</a> <br> <br>It's $2000 for exclusive ownership transferred <br>to BT. They seem to accept just about anything, <br>judging by the quality of their recent releases. <br> <br>Stephen</div>

<div class=commentbody>Joe and Stephen! <br>You are too kind. Thanks for the compliments. <br>Daze gets a lot of traffic and I published the first collection in book form last year. <br> <br>The most common comparison people make is Edward Gorey: <br><a href=http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Square/3441/object1.html target=_top>http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Square/3441/object1.html</a> <br> <br>But there is another humorist called Glen Baxter whose work I love. At The New Yorker Cartoon Bank: <br><a href="http://www.cartoonbank.com/search_results.asp?mscssid=CJ6KCUR2S1S92MD000GPBQXDMWKV2US9&s_keywords=&s_artist=baxter&s_caption=&s_id=&s_topic=&s_fromdate=&s_todate=&x=26&y=13" target=_top>http://www.cartoonbank.com/search_results.asp?mscssid=CJ6KCUR2S1S92MD000GPBQXDMWKV2US9&s_keywords=&s_artist=baxter&s_caption=&s_id=&s_topic=&s_fromdate=&s_todate=&x=26&y=13</a> <br> <br> <br>Typographically, I have great fun playing with 19th century types for designs used in Daze of Our Lives material. I really think it was such a rich, inventive and eclectic time for type design. The modern age and minimalism definitely killed a lot of that spirit off. <br>Again, thanks - and spread the good word about Daze for me would you?</div>
