		<div class="commentbody">It looks like wrinkled tinfoil.  I'm not sure if the name &quot;remnant&quot; works, since the majority of the letter is still there.  It's definitely something that can be used as a display, but if you just took an existing typeface and applied filters to it, there may be legal issues.  It's a good start though.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Sorry I haven't gotten back to all of you sooner. I was just reminded by a friend of mine that I had some responses.  <BR>I guess I need to explain my process a little more. To start with I took a typeface, made some alterations, crumpled the paper, took digital pictures of each individual letterform in 3 different light settings. Then I took these images and manipulated them in Streamline. The high contrast and conversion I applied helped erase my letterforms to my goal.  I hope this helps. Also, in response to Eduardo- I actually think the Frothy typeface looks very similar to a fellow student's design-Tetanus. I think it is also posted on here. Both Frothy and Tetnus remind me a lot of Baskerville.  <BR>For legallity purposes, I'm not intending to sell this. Just for personal use and for my class project. Thank you!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi, Beth. <BR> <BR><i>&gt;I actually think the Frothy typeface looks very similar to a <BR>fellow student's design.</i> <BR> <BR>I didn't mean that your Remnant <i>looks</i> similar to Frothy. <BR>I just put those links above just as &quot;reminder&quot;. Taking an existing  <BR>typeface and changing it, it's not as innovative as it may sound. <BR> <BR>Can I ask you a question? Why did you choose Stone Sans to <BR>play with? It was the same typeface used in Frothy. <BR> <BR> <BR><i>&gt;Both Frothy and Tetnus remind me a lot of Baskerville.</i> <BR> <BR>I don't wanna be picky, but how can a modern serif typeface <BR>remind you of a nineties grunge one? ;-) <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Eduardo- I understand you were sharing with me what you thought was similar. I also understand that changing an existing typeface is not so good. What I wanted to do, was to work with it and to create a typeface that appeared unwanted, used, and all that remained was this new design. I didn't realize that I along with the Frothy designer had such a pull to Stone Sans. Just kind of odd I guess. I thought Tetnus looked a bit like Baskerville because I think that is one of the types she used to base her typeface on.  <BR> <BR>On another note, any suggestions on what to use this typeface on? I'm trying to brainstorm for my specimen posters&hellip;&hellip;just looking for open feedback from everyone. I am hoping for a better idea than for a landfill flyer. Thanks!!!</div>
