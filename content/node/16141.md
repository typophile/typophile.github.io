  feel but still ultra hip)\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?"

  body: What feel do you want? Is it techy or avant guarde or romantic maybe serious?
    Can you focus this more.

  body: I would say "High End" since they want to focus on larger clientele. They
    want to have that "Ultra Cool" look but with the molecular/scientific/classy feel.

  body: Okay you are narrowing it down but I have a problem wiht making it both Ultra
    Cool and Scientific. Ultra Cool seems to be grungy (I could be wrong) and Scientific
    seems to be on the Eurostyle feel all lower case (but I could be wrong again).
    I would go another direction all together, I would explore a unique mark that
    was not plugged into a category.

  body: "now you know my stress! I have been racking my brain on how to come up with
    something. Maybe these thoughts will help (I appreciate the discussion by the
    way, this is really helping).\r\n\r\nI wouldn't say grungy for \"Cool\" maybe
    a better word would be \"hip\". They want to use orange as their main accent color.
    This color to me puts them in the \"Dot Com\" arena. They actually are a dot com,
    but they want to move out of that area a little bit while still keeping the edgy
    dot com \"hip\" factor. Throw in a slice of scientific and we have a real Frankenstein
    don't we?"

  body: Beau what we need now is the really cool type designers and "well" designers
    like Tim and Chris to comment. My strength is marketing.

    too cursive for this application but I do see the benefit.\r\n\r\nThanks guys,
    this is great!"
