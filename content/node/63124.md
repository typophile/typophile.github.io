  body: "[Red-faced] OK, my bad, not Futura, but doesn't l.c. 's' in Futura look like
    this S?  Maybe part of what makes THIS A LIE is that the font is mixed in case,
    orientation (flipped E) and source (more than one font). Take the A from a font
    with a flat top.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Ok thanks, I would really like to have a headline font like this one. Clean
    but still a bit playful. Like a DIN, Avant Garde & Futura mix with something extra.
    Any other suggestions?
