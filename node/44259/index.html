  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>As a designer with the <a href=http://www.yaledailynews.com/>Yale Daily News</a>, I had the pleasure last night of designing a terrific article about Matthew Carter&rsquo;s Yale typeface and the University&rsquo;s overall identity, featuring interviews with Carter, Michael Bierut, and others. The article is available here &ndash; <a href="http://www.yaledailynews.com/articles/view/24465">http://www.yaledailynews.com/articles/view/24465</a> &ndash; but the visual aspect of the article on the site is limited. Below I&rsquo;ve posted today&rsquo;s front page, a close-up of the article on the front, and the graphic I made for the inside jump. Critiques are welcome, although at this point obviously it&rsquo;s too late to be changed. Hope you enjoy.</p>

<p>Also see: <a href="http://www.typophile.com/node/29323"><a href="http://www.typophile.com/node/29323">http://www.typophile.com/node/29323</a></a></p>
<p>Yale is blessed to have Matthew Carter as senior critic for their graphic design program. I only wish Harvard had a discernible university-wide graphic identity (other than a colour scheme), let alone a classy bespoke typeface.</p>
<p>Good job overall on the design of the article, and I particularly like the drop cap A, a signature Yale glyph.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad you liked the drop cap; Paul (the reporter) and I discussed starting the article with either an &ldquo;A&rdquo; or &ldquo;R&rdquo; since those are two of the more distinctive glyphs in Yale.</p>

<p>That being said, I still find it to be really fitting for the situation/application and pretty beautiful. I like the flat changes to the previously rounded (earmarks?).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>My school (Rice) has had a really strong push for a consistent identity in the past year or two, but I think we&rsquo;re going about it all wrong. First of all, the official university typeface is Trajan, which is not at all distinctive. Anyone who is printing a Rice-related publication needs to use the official university logo, which is a slightly modified version of &ldquo;RICE&rdquo; spelled out in Trajan. We are not allowed to set the words &ldquo;Rice University&rdquo; or &ldquo;Rice&rdquo; in Trajan ourselves; we have to use the Illustrator file.</p>
<p>I like what is said in that article about thinking of the typeface as a sort of viral marketing for the university; you don&rsquo;t force anyone to use the Yale typeface&ndash;you just strongly encourage. You essentially make it as easy as possible for anyone on the campus to fit the identity system. That&rsquo;s not at all what Rice is doing.</p>
<p>Also (though this is not related to the Yale typeface at all, and I apologize), someone in our Public Affairs department decided that our beautiful 100-year-old crest needed to be updated from [[http://www.danablankenhorn.com/images/2007/04/13/rice_shield_sm2.jpg|this]] to [[http://registrar.rice.edu/images/seal7.gif|this.]] Apparently we need to portray ourselves as an up-and-coming school looking towards the future, as opposed to a well-established, nearly-100-year-old institution that is well-respected throughout the country, despite the fact that <em>that&rsquo;s what we are.</em> Also, the new logo looks terrible when it&rsquo;s printed in grayscale (as most Web 2.0 logos are wont to do).</p>
<p>EDIT: Also, are students allowed to use the typeface for their academic work (the license doesn&rsquo;t make it clear enough)? Because if I went to Yale, I would totally set every paper I write in that typeface.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t even know if there is an official Harvard logo (contrary to what some Hollywood films suggest, there is no big sign saying &ldquo;Harvard University&rdquo; anywhere on campus). There&rsquo;s just a university shield with what I assume is custom lettering. Typeface-wise, it&rsquo;s a real free-for-all between the different schools, the Board of Overseers, different Harvard-related organizations&hellip; I do see Minion a lot, though. The Graduate School of Design I think has their own attempt at an identity system, based on Trade Gothic if I recall correctly.</p>

<p>There are times &ndash; more than a few &ndash; when a slightly compact font is just what you need.</p>
<p>As to the old school rivalries, I remember when JFK got an honorary degree from Yale. He said something like &ldquo;Now I have the best: a Harvard education and a Yale degree.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Brian, thanks for pointing out the Harvard campus images. I&rsquo;ve been starting to catalogue Yale&rsquo;s incredible lettering, the early results of which you can see <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/25535730@N03/>here</a>, so it&rsquo;s very interesting to see how the two compare. Maybe I&rsquo;ll celebrate our inevitable victory at the Game next year by touring Cambridge&rsquo;s lettering in person :-)</p>
