  body: If this comes from The New Yorker it is a custom typeface known as Irvin.
    There are several copies of this, but none are very good. Have a look at <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/genres/elegant_vintage_caps_of_the_20s/?affid=99346">this
    list</a> for similar fonts.

    it's no longer part of the FontFont library, but you'll find it in that list."

  body: I don't think this is all that similar to the New Yorker face. Try searching
    myfonts for "Art deco"!
