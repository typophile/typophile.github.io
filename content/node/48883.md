body: "Hello folks,\r\nseeing all these amazing typefaces here I feel a little intimidated
  posting this, but I would love to hear some advice from more experienced designers.
  My goal is to create a strong headline for the openSUSE Linux distribution. \r\n\r\n[[http://jimmac.musichall.cz/images/blog/5thleg-wip.pdf]]\r\n\r\nThe
  obvious inspiration is Cholla by Sibylle Hagmann. I haven't gotten to the point
  of tackling spacing and kerning. Still only figuring out the glyphs. I'm struggling
  with c,e. Not really happy with Q, W and B. Thanks for all your critique and suggestions."

  body: Two question I forgot. Is it an incredible sin to do the serif for lowecase
    l to make it distincive from the uppercase I? Would it be a similar blasphemy
    to do lowercase numerals (or whatever you call 'minusky' in english) in a sans
    serif font?

    might need to move a little farther away from Cholla before Emigre would be comfortable
    with this as a public release. '

  body: "I've done a few tweaks since I've posted the initial preview. Added lowercase
    numerals and simplified the capitals. \r\n\r\nAs this was meant to be a Cholla
    replacement for future openSUSE community branding materials I don't want to go
    that far away from Cholla look. Feeling similar was one of the goals."

  body: "While I can certainly see the influence, I think there's a enough changes
    that I wouldn't mistaken the two fonts.  Some of the clear differences can be
    seen in the m and the r, where 5th Leg has a semicircle extension and the m has
    smoother humps and flat feet and is a bit stouter.  \r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro
