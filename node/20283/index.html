<p>It is dead easy for the administrators of the site to do this.</p>
<p>I have no idea why I would have to give an explanation, but 
one reason is that I don&rsquo;t want my e-mail address on the files of a site that I don&rsquo;t plan to use.</p>

<p>A couple of months ago, I received an e-mail from a well-known American magazine explaining that their computer had been hacked and that information about tens of thousands of subscribers, including me, had &ldquo;gone missing&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Having decided to discontinue my participation on this site, I just want to know what I have to do to arrange for the deletion of my account.  I have already modified some of it, but my e-mail address remains. I want to know (a) whether the administrators will delete my account and, if not, (b) whether I will be protected from a hack if I change my e-mail address to something erroneous.</p>
<p>If Palantine and you find this funny, that&rsquo;s your business.  You may find it less amusing if you receive an e-mail from typophile, or some other organisation, saying that information about you, which was supposed to be available only to the administrators, has been accessed by persons unknown.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Palatine,</p>
<p>Apparently you are from Ontario, and I gather that Swann is from B.C., so here&rsquo;s the deal.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re making a radio documentary in Newfoundland during the first week of August.  It has been commissioned and will be broadcast in North America on one of the satellite networks.</p>
<p>At the same time, we&rsquo;ll be doing large format (4x5) and  motion picture photography (super 16) that is semi-related to what we are doing in Newfoundland and heavily related to a project that we are doing in New York.  The project includes a book, and may involve people in Newfoundland who make books by hand.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of work to do, especially in the next eight weeks, and I&rsquo;ve come to the conclusion that there are higher priorities than following the discussions on this site.</p>
<p>Right now, on the typographic side, I&rsquo;m concerned about film titles and what type we are going to use for the book.  I am currently involved in discussions about whether the designers of a particular type are going to expand the character set and, if so, at what cost.  These are not the only issues on a project like this. On the sound side alone, there are important decisions to make about what system we are going to use to record ambient sound in stereo (some systems are more mono compatible than others), and what gear we will need to do those recordings in places that can be quite windy/noisy, such as the Strait of Belle Isle and the top of Gros Morne.</p>
<p>If I am a bit surprised on the typographic side, it is in the product available from New York designers (most of it not all that interesting for my purposes) and difficulties trying to communicate with foundries in Vancouver and the Netherlands. These experiences have basically driven me to deal with a European company outside the Netherlands, although, as I mentioned, a deal depends on the time frame that they give me for the production of some additional characters.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m just busy with a lot of stuff. That&rsquo;s all. No disrespect.</p>

<p>There are quite a few designers that post here, among them Johnathon Hoefler of famed Hoefler+Frere Jones (from new York, I think), as well as Nick Shinn of Shinntype, right here in Toronto. I think even Jean-Francois Porchez (jfp?) posted here a few days ago.</p>
<p>So you might try starting your own thread about your project and perhaps get feedback firsthand from designers. Or have you done that already?</p>

<p>As I said, I want my account closed.</p>
<p>Of Hoefler&rsquo;s work, the one type that interested me was Requiem, but as far as I know it is not available in bold face, which I need.</p>
<p>The Porchez faces that are available (not under exclusive contract) and potentially suitable strike me as very French. That isn&rsquo;t a criticism, it&rsquo;s just not what I&rsquo;m looking for. I&rsquo;m not sure whether this impression on my part is the result of having lived in Paris, where his work is fairly ubiquitous (including in my daily newspaper), or whether it is actually based on something inherent in his designs. That said, there is one type of his that is a possibility.</p>
<p>Funny you mention Mr. Shinn.  I&rsquo;d be very interested in seeing a character set by him for book text, but if such a thing exists, I was unable to find it on his web site.</p>
<p>As far as I can see, there aren&rsquo;t that many contemporary designs for book text with full character sets kicking around that are interesting, at least to my taste.</p>

<p>It varies from type face to type face. Of the contemporary book text types that interested me, several were a no-go for one reason or another, whether lack of bold face, small caps, text figures, fractions, a couple of mathematial symbols that I need, etc.</p>
<p>Anyway, I just received an e-mail from the firm that I&rsquo;ve been dealing with. They can do the additional characters that I need in a very reasonable time, so the issue is academic at this point.</p>

<p>As Gerald Lang says, this is a normal request. I don&rsquo;t know what the significance is for prior posts, which would seem to be an issue about this site&rsquo;s sotware, and not something which is, or should be, my concern. As a practical matter, I have been involved in this site for two weeks, and don&rsquo;t recall saying anything, during that period, that is of more than momentary interest.</p>
<p>As for Dan Reynolds&rsquo;s comment, he is factually incorrect about the amount of information about me on the internet, and that is deliberate.</p>
<p>I am amazed that some  people are suggesting that I don&rsquo;t have a right to unsubscribe from this organization, apparently on the basis that they may find it inconvenient.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Fontplayer,</p>
<p>In my case, changing the e-mail address that I used to register on this site is a major hassle. If the owners do a search on that address, after the @ sign, and put www before it, they may realize why.  I work within an organisation, and we use a particular e-mail address format. I have had the same e-mail address for about ten years, and changing it is not a unilateral decision.</p>
<p>If you are encouraging people to register through throw-away accounts, such as yahoo, etc., I can tell you that there are a lot of people who won&rsquo;t take an e-mail from such an account seriously. They want to communicate through the real account.</p>
<p>When I registered on this site I used a real account, and not one I can easily change. Someone who wants to send the message that using a real account on this site is a bad idea should perhaps think a bit about what they are saying.</p>
<p>I will admit that once my account on this site is erased, in accordance with the undertaking that has been given to me, I will never again use my long-term e-mail address to register on a site unless I know, for certain, that I&rsquo;m not going to wind up in a debate like this. I am truly floored.</p>

<p>This morning I received an instant message, or whatever it is called on this site, from a Typophile member. It had to do with his designs, in which I happen to be interested.</p>
<p>I chose to respond by e-mail rather than by instant message. Why?  Because I know that he is legit and I wanted him to know that I am.</p>
<p>That just makes life easier, although I will be the first to admit that $1.99 per month, with the ability to change who you are at will, is for some people attractive.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t want to go there, and I also don&rsquo;t want to be penalised for that.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d really appreciate it if the owners of Typophile would just do what their moderator agreed to do.</p>
<p>If people want to turn this into a major policy debate for this site, that&rsquo;s fine, I&rsquo;d just as soon that it not be done on my dime.</p>
