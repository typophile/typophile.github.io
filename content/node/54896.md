  body: To get those effects you can use what's already in Illustrator - namely the
    Transform (and copy) ability and the Pathfinder tools. Check out Veerle Pieters
    site- http://veerle.duoh.com/ -for tutorials.

  body: You want to look at the Kimbo plug-in for Illustrator (http://members.shaw.ca/spvincent/plugins/default.html)
    or Artlandia SymmetryWorks. Kimbo is reasonably priced and a very useful addition
    to Illustrator. SymmetryWorks is really cool but costs a bit more but then it
    does a lot more.
