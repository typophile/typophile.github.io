body: "Barbieri is a casual sans type family, based on a German lettering style from
  the 1960s. The original hand-drawn alphabet was used in a rather peculiar edition
  of Der Barbier von Bagdad, an opera composed by Peter Cornelius. Our efforts to
  identify the cover designer have been, so far, unsuccessful. As fans of informal
  typography and popular lettering styles, we thought these few thin letters deserved
  a re-incarnation as a complete type family. Andr\xE9s Torresi and Marta S\xE1nchez
  Marco were in charge of the production work.\r\n\r\nNow Barbieri has 6 weights suitable
  for packaging, posters, and music covers. It resembles a certain \u2018Americana\u2019
  spirit, though with a Germanic twist.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.re-type.com/fonts/barbieri.html\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/barbieri-newsletter2_5871.gif]"

    heavy weights contemporary, and the whole range works together.
