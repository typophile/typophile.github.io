body: I'm having trouble installing a new font I've made. The font is numerals and
  certain other characters only - ie non-alphabetic. It generates ok from fontlab
  and shows up in MS applications, but won't show up at all in illustrator, even at
  the bottom of the list where all the non-latin fonts go. I've got other fonts without
  complete character sets (generated at some point in testing before all the glyphs
  are filled) that show up fine in illustrator, and I can't see anything different
  in the settings. Anybody got any ideas where I'm going wrong?

    the correct default glyphs in the right places?\r\nAre all the outlines correct
    (complete, correct direction, no overlaps or bad nodes)?\r\nUnicodes correct?\r\nOT
    Features correct?\r\n"

  body: Fixed now. I think it was a problem with the supported Unicode ranges, as
    there are a lot of currency symbols which had triggered it to say Thai, Armenian,
    Cyrillic etc. supported. Changed it to just Latin and it works ok.
