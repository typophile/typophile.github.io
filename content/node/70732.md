    r, the n''s and the g''s are heavier than the rest of the letters, and all of
    the letters were likely optically distorted in different ways.'

  body: So, what font's been used for the r's, n's and g's? I've seen on The Internet
    that someone spoofed this book title, and I've been wondering what font they used.
    It looks exactly the same to this font, that's why I asked here. But, yeah. Thanks
    for answering, man.

  body: I'm looking at the same lettering on the title page of a UK edition of the
    book. It's Theodore "Dr. Seuss" Geisel's own hand lettering from the early '60s.

  body: Me, too.... I'm really wondering about this font.... it's just gotta be somewhere....
    if only I knew the name.... I'd probably find it in a heartbeat.

  body: I've got a copy of this book (who doesn't?) and, looking closely at the characters,
    I would say this was probably hand drawn, but they saved some time and photostatted
    the repeating letters. It's <em>possible</em> that it was some kind of phototype
    font, but I'm thinking no.

  body: "Hm.\r\n\r\nI think it's a font - I searched \"Beginner Books\" on Google,
    and I saw a few of them with this same exact font. I wonder what it's called,
    though. Hm."

  body: "I think it's quite likely that the publishers had a font made to resemble
    Seuss's lettering, but it's proprietary. I looked for styles with a similar feeling
    and would suggest these as alternatives: <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/elemeno/bella/\">Bella</a>
    by Alex Grecian, <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typetrust/everafter/\">Everafter</a>
    by Silas Dilworth and <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/victory/farmhouse/\">Farmhouse</a>
    by Noah Rothschild. By making them outline letters and then individually positioning
    each letter I think you could produce something that would have a similar look,
    even if it was not identical.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
