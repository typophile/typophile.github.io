  body: I have no problem with EULAs. But whether we're talking about a font or a
    religion, anyone who slaps me the the face with legalisms before I even get in
    the front door, I find offensive.

  body: "This is the dumbest way of going about EULA.\r\n\r\nThose who care about
    following EULAs will search for it before purchasing. Those who don't, will just
    click through this page and get the fonts. There are also those who are oblivious
    to the existence of EULA, but showing them a wall of fine print is a sure way
    to force them to click through without reading. So, essentially, this page is
    useless, but it clearly rubs some people the wrong way.\r\n\r\nWhat would've worked
    better is a summary of EULA in few sentences of human speak + a link or an expandable
    page section with full EULA document."

  body: Presenting the EULA up front seems to me eminently sensible, and I don't see
    anything in asking people to acknowledge the terms of the license they are purchasing
    before they purchase it as 'a slap in the face'. This license is what you are
    choosing to purchase or not, so giving you an explicit choice regarding its terms
    is sensible, and should have been the norm for software licensing from the beginning.

    are large groups of people you're ignoring - like people who don't know what a
    EULA is... But I do agree that a \"human-readable\" version (which however can't
    be binding) is a good idea. This is a great model: https://monokrom.no/page/about_us/licensing_terms\r\n\r\nRelated:

  body: This has nothing to do with inviting someone into your home, or with 'being
    equals'. This is a company offering to sell you something, and what they are offering
    to sell you is <em>that license</em> to use their font software. That is what
    you are considering buying, so asking you to look at it and agree to its terms
    before you pay for it strikes me not only as sensible but what all software vendors
    should be doing. Isn't that better than the common model in which you pay for
    a software license but don't actually see and agree to the license until you go
    to install the software?

    do not see your \"in your face\" inference at all. When all is said and done if
    you find \"getting all the details out of the way\" offensive then go some where
    else. Simple as it gets!"
