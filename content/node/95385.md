body: "Hi everybody,\r\nIs there a Python script that can batch import multiple EPS
  files in Fontlab. Searched all over the internet, and found nothing. I need just
  basic functionality - start from a new empty typeface and import EPS files in sequential
  mode, no encoding just in index mode. Any ideas! Thank you in advance!"

  body: Not sure exactly how your EPS files are set up, but <a href="http://www.fontlab.com/font-converter/scanfont/">ScanFont</a>
    works great for moving art from .ai or .eps files into FontLab. Unfortunately,
    it doesn't work on Mac running Lion or Mountain Lion yet. They do have options
    for those in that boat, though.

      EPS files and none seem to be able to import into the program.
