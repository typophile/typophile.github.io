  about the history of Berthold AG? I'm doing a research project on Berthold and Akzidenz
  Grotesk, and I'm finding plenty of books that refer to Berthold here and there,
  but usually it's only in passing, and tracking down all these little references
  is killing me when it comes to finding useful details. "

  body: "This one might offer a good first overview and its not too expensive:\r\n\r\nGo
    to http://www.zvab.com and search for:\r\nH. Berthold AG 100 jahre\r\n\r\nBut
    of course its in german. Is'nt it better to study the original than a later on
    written english version? Its not to difficult.\r\n\r\nGeorg\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bleisetzer.de\"target=\"_blank\"class=\"link\">Preu\xDFisches

  body: "Thanks for the recommendation. I don't mind using German books, but I'm short
    on time for this project so I was hoping that there would be something in English
    that could get me up to speed quickly. Erik Spiekermann let me know that there's
    nothing in English, so I'll be spending a few days at the library of Congress
    reading this one and \"Das Haus Berthold.\"\r\n"
