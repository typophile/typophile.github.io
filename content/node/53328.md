body: "Many designers love 1001freefonts.com or similar websites to get their hardly
  unique typefaces that will be used by much more than 1001 different designers. I
  do not use these typefaces, not because you can't at times find something good,
  but because I feel like using these fonts is an easy way out. If you want to make
  something look \"evil\" it is very easy to get a grungy, distorted typeface and
  throw it on a dark background and presto! you have your evil look. It takes the
  skill out of designing. I have a few favorite fonts that I use, and as you can probably
  assume, Helvetica is one of them. Wim Crouwel said \"[A typeface] shouldn't have
  a meaning in itself, the meaning is in the content of the text, and not in the typeface,
  and that's why we loved Helvetica very much...\" Using a font with too much \"emotion\"
  can take away from the overall success of a piece (even if a momentary superficial
  point is achieved). Now, I know that not all of these fonts are horrible and some
  briefly distorted fonts can be used to achieve a subtle look, but any designer can
  distort any font to achieve a completely unique texture and a completely unique
  effect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTypography is an art form and a beautiful typeface is something
  very hard to make and the majority of these free font sites pervert this art and
  produce mass amounts of drivel. My point, get a high quality font collection like
  Adobe's Font Folio, find something that stands out to you and if you need a texture
  then make a texture, if you need a word to look shaky, move the letters to achieve
  your look.\r\n\r\n\r\nDon't be a lazy designer. You\u2019ll like your piece much
  more if you don\u2019t skimp."

  body: "i agree with what you wrote about ready made free fonts and about designers'
    lazyness, but i disagree on Wim's opinion. \r\nusualy i love to make my own type
    when making display healines, but i think that good fonts with a clear emotion
    and style are a designer's tool of trade.\r\n\r\ni disagree with the banal use
    of helvetica for every kind of job. this bores the hell out of me, and i really
    think that this is the ultimate designers' lazyness. \r\n\r\nit's like saying:\r\n\"I
    GIVE UP!! from now on its potatoes only!\"\r\nwhile potatoes are good and nutritional,
    they are not sufficient, and a constant use would make you go berzerk and storm
    at the nearest grocery store, trying to lick mustard jars in order to stirr up
    your fading taste senses."

  body: "Agreed. Helvetica should not be used. In fact, I've been partial to Serif
    fonts recently. I think that Sans Serif fonts are chosen by many designers now
    and even limiting yourself to something like that is, well, limiting. \r\n\r\nwww.glennsorrentino.com"

  body: "i did not say helvetica should not be used. it is a good font, well constructed,
    and it's popularity show's it's goodness.\r\nhowever, it should not be used for
    everything."
