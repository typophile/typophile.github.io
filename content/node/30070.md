  body: "I have been looking for this font, and am coming to the belief that this
    is a customization of Avant Garde Gothic. Imagine converting the letters to outlines
    and then moving one half of the letter's points away from the other half. The
    right side of the R gave me this notion. The A looks like the Alternate form of
    the A with an added gap.\r\n\r\nAt least, if I had to re-create this, I would
    try it the way I described.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"
