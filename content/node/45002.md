  YORK, NY -- <a href=\"http://www.oneclub.org/\">The One Club</a> this week will
  recognize the excellence of the Typophile Film Fest 4 titles with a coveted One
  Show Pencil. <a href=\"http://www.punchcut.com\">Punchcut</a> commissioned Brent
  Barson and Eric Gillette for the title design on behalf of Typophile. We could not
  be more pleased for Brent and Eric and the students of their Visual Arts 441 / BYU
  class that participated. The titles opened our Typophile Film Fest 4 to a filled-to-capacity
  audience of 300+ attendees at TypeCon 2007 in Seattle and was shown again to a standing-room-only
  crowd at the Swedish American Hall in San Francisco.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
