  for a couple of projects \u2013 mainly wondering about books, nonfiction if possible.
  Has anyone used it, or seen it used, in such a context and can share some insight
  (and pix :-)? The examples I've seen of it in use are mainly editorial design, or
  more display-oriented.\r\n\r\nSome people appear to think it's too distracting for
  books, but I wonder if that should be true. Of course it looks snazzy up large,
  but it seems to read very crisply to me too. (I'm a new convert in terms of the
  Electra \"g\" \u2013 I used to think it's too distracting, but then I read a couple
  of books set in Electra and have found it really isn't. And Prensa seems to apply
  the same principle to more glyphs, in a way, so I wonder.)\r\n\r\nAlso, what is
  the deal with the \"Book\" weight being lighter than the Regular? I like it in terms
  of the less-strong contrast, but is it a little light?\r\n\r\nCurious for your insights/opinions."

    the rich qualities of letterpress into the bland medium of offset."

  body: "Nina, the \u201CBook\u201D designation is just a weight declaration, not
    a specific recommendation of that particular weight for books, per se. (As far
    as I know, anyway. I never asked Cyrus.)\r\n\r\nFB has historically used Book
    when there\u2019s a big range and something falls between Light and Regular. However,
    the practice is being phased out, because having both a Book and a Regular weight
    can cause problems in InDesign menus. (Fixed for existing families.)\r\n\r\nIf
    you\u2019d like to see a PDF of both in text settings closer to your target, contact
    me offline with some sample text and specs \u2014 line-measure, leading, approx
    size(s) \u2014 and I\u2019ll see what I can set up for you.\r\n\r\n"

    \r\nI thought I've seen families where it's darker than the Regular, too.\r\nKent,
    I'll be happy to contact you offline soon \u2013 thank you.\r\n\r\nNick \u2013
    good food for thought."
