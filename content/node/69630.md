  apexes (A) and vertexes (V) so I could do a reversible fold out book to demonstrate
  them. (Similar to attached picture)\r\n\r\nI have located most of them but am having
  difficulties finding matching As and Vs for the Full Serif and also the Hallowed/Sheared.
  \ All seem to alter on the Vs.\r\n\r\nAny help is very much appreciated.  Thanks
  in advance,\r\n\r\nEdwina"

    most fonts that have a \"hallowed\" apex to the \"A\" have a simple pointed vertex
    in the \"V\", as in most versions of Caslon for instance. Be mindful that such
    details aren't always \"mirrorable\", or so straightforward in type.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    ITC Benguiat also has the \"full serif\"."
