body: "You often read a book and register the information as being true, especially
  when it is less or more the same you have read before about the subject. It gets
  a bit odd when you find out that in different publications things are mixed up and
  each publication seems to add more and more fuzz around the subject. I recently
  bought a used book about Paul Renner, published in 1978 by Philipp Luidl for the
  Typographical Society in Munich, Germany. In that book the well-known typedesigner
  G\xFCnter Gerhard Lange wrote an article about Renner. Lange was at that time the
  art director of H. Berthold type foundry and was seen as one of the most influential
  people in the type design community in Germany. In his article he writes that the
  architect Ferdinand Kramer in 1925 made a drawing of a geometrical sans serif for
  the building department of the city of Frankfurt on which Renner based his Futura.
  On the next page in the same article Lange writes that Renner in 1924 began working
  on the design of Futura. This strange discrepancy in time was the reason that I
  wanted to know more about the widely known Kramer-Grotesk.\r\n\r\nI began reading
  books about Renner and Kramer to straigthen my mind about who really made the first
  design of Futura. Especially because Futura is even today one of the most used typefaces.\r\n\r\nOf
  course the biography by Christopher Burke about Paul Renner (Hyphen Press, 1998)
  was the first to read. The second was an article by Burke about the authorship of
  Futura in Baseline 23 (1997). In this article Burke widens the authorship to the
  design staff of Bauer Type Foundry. Not strange when you look at the complex technical
  production process of a typeface in that period of time but sadly it makes the discussion
  about the authorship not easier. But he also introduces some publications he also
  researched. One is an article (Tiessen, 1969). from the well-known author Hans Peter
  Willberg. Willberg writes that Kramer was a student at the St\xE4del-Schule in Frankfurt
  in 1925 and that it was Kramer who made at that school the first drawings that later
  became Futura. But Kramer was in 1925 already a well-known architect and product
  designer and he was working at the building department of the city of Frankfurt.
  He never attended the St\xE4del-Schule. Renner began with his first drawings for
  Futura in 1924 and at the beginning of 1925 first cuts of the typeface were already
  done by Bauer Type Foundry. So both assertions of Willberg are wrong.\r\n\r\nBut
  the most used peace of evidence in several publications about Kramer-Grotesk is
  a sheet of paper that shows capitals of Futura with some of the characters only
  as outline sketches that are crossed out. Elsewhere on the sheet alternative characters
  are enclosed. [picture 1]\r\n\r\nSo I had to figure out when this sheet of paper
  with sketches was first published and why it was attributed to Kramer. Since most
  of the material of Bauer Type Foundry is supposed to be destroyed during World War
  II I first had to research publications from before this war. One important publication
  is an article by Denis Megaw in Typography 7, published in 1938. On page 34 a couple
  of  drawings are shown that are presented as the first designs of Futura by Renner
  (1924). These are the lower case characters and capitals that are placed on the
  top of the page [picture 2]. Below this two character sets a complete set is shown
  from Futura as published by Bauer in its final form (without the extra alternative
  characters). But the set below was not published by Bauer earlier than 1927 (the
  publication year according to Paul Renner in the Georg-M\xFCller-Book article).
  The sheet of paper with sketches [picture 1] show in black more or less the definitive
  forms of the capitals of Futura while the outline forms are showing his first designs
  from 1924 for the A and K. There is also an invitation card for a lecture dated
  3. July (1925) [picture 3] made with trial cuts of Futura by Bauer. These characters
  and mainly the capitals are in a state between the first designs in the article
  from Megaw and the final ones beneath that. Look for example at the M, N and R.
  The same story is told by a trial setting that was made for the publication Schrift
  by F.H. Ehmke that was published on July 9th 1925 [picture 4]. You have to keep
  in mind that at that time the publication of a book would have taken several months
  from concept to producing, gathering illustations, setting, proofing and printing.
  As described by Paul Renner in the interview \u2018From Georg-M\xFCller book to
  Futura and the Meisterschule; recollections by Paul Renner\u2019 (translated) he
  mentioned even that he showed trials of Futura by Bauer already in february 1925
  during lectures at large printing firms in Cologne and M\xF6nchengladbach. In May
  1925 (around Easter) Renner moves from M\xFCnchen to Frankfurt to teach at Fritz
  Wicherts Frankfurt Art School. At that time he also meets Wicherts friend Ernst
  May who is the head of the building department of the city of Frankfurt. The architect
  Ferdinand Kramer was also working at this department and met Paul Renner around
  that time. Together with Ernst May Renner and Kramer became part of the group that
  worked on the ambitious plans for rebuilding parts of the city of Frankfurt. A lot
  of inspiration for the plans came from the Bauhaus and buildings of the Stijl in
  Holland. One of the examples that was also pubished in the magazine Das Neue Frankfurt
  was De Unie in Rotterdam by Architect Oud. On that building typography is clearly
  part of the architecture. One of the first things May asked from Renner was to deliver
  an architectural typeface that could be used in architecture and for signing on
  shops and small structures like bus stops. I think that the sheet that was delivered
  by Renner to the building department is also the sheet that can be found in the
  Werkkatalog Ferdinand Kramer 1923-1974 by Jochem Jourdan that was published in the
  \u2018Schriftenreihe 3 der Architektenkammer Hessen\u2019 in 1974. [picture 5] In
  this Werkkatalog the design sheet of letterforms is dated 1925 according to Jourdan.
  I think that on this sheet the myth of the Kramer-Grotesk is based and not on the
  sheet that was published later in Baseline (The authorship of Futura by Chistopher
  Burke) and several other publications [picture 1]. This second sheet with drawings
  of capital Futura letters was credited to Kramer simply because it was found in
  his archive. Of course it could also be there because he had taken it from his work
  at the building department. It could be a copy or even the original that Renner
  had delivered at the building department for copying and distributing to letter
  sign firms and architects that worked in Frankfurt. There are some slight differences
  between the characters (for example the J and S) of the trial settings of Bauer
  Type Foundry and the capitals on the Kramer-sheet but that could be a design decision
  by Renner for the architectural purpose of this set of capitals. A publication in
  Das Neue Frankfurt [picture 6] in january 1927 shows the typography of the fassade
  of the hat shop of Ferdinand Kramers parents in Frankfurt using the capitals of
  Futura. This design as well as the design of a second shop fassade on the same page
  is credited to Renner as well as that the name of the typeface (Futura) is also
  mentioned in the caption of the other picture. Some slight alternations to the characters
  can also be caused by sign makers who had to take over the letterforms from the
  drawings of Renner. At that time there were no computers, scanners or even laser
  equipment that could do that. That is also the reason why the model drawings from
  Renner were made on so-called mm-paper with lines that could easely be translated
  to enlargements of the letterforms.\r\n\r\nI think that looking at the timeline
  of the publications and the consistence of the development of the design of Futura
  by Renner there can be no doubt that Kramer-Grotesk is a myth. The only thing that
  remains and is hard to understand is why Ferdinand Kramer did not protest against
  this so-called Kramer-Grotesk that was published in several works like the Bauhaus-Archiv
  publication Ferdinand Kramer Architektur & Design in 1982 when he was alive and
  kicking (although he was at that time 84 years old). Kramer was an architect who
  had a very good reputation in furniture design and architecture and one could say
  that he did not need this credit for Kramer-Grotesk. The capitals of Futura were
  developped in the definitive form in 1925 but the lower case characters still had
  to go a long way to meet the final design. Maybe the development of this lower case
  letters were part of the discussions Renner had with Kramer and it could be that
  the huge transformations of these designs strengthened Kramers idea that he actually
  had been part of the birth of Futura. According to Neumann in his article in Ferdinand
  Kramer from 1991 Kramer did say (gespr\xE4chsweise) that he considered himself as
  one of the \u2018fathers\u2019 of Futura. This is all speculation but I can find
  no other reason why Kramer did not reject the publication of the so-called Kramer
  Grotesk and his role in the design of Futura like stated in the caption on page
  33 in the Bauhaus-Archiv publication [picture 7].\r\n\r\nOne of the publications
  that helped me a lot in this research was the thesis of Charles C. Leonard \u2018Paul
  Renner and Futura: The Effects of Culture, and Social Continuity on the Design of
  Type for Printing\u2019 that he published in 2005/2006. Leonard thoroughly researched
  the drawings shown in Typography 7 as well as the disputed design sheet from \u2018Wie
  eine Buchdruckschrift entsteht\u2019 (How a new printing type is made) of Bauer
  Type Foundry in 1958 [picture 8]. One thing that he presumes falsely is that the
  design sheet (picture 1) from 1958 was a reprint of the publication of Bauer with
  the same name from 1931 [picture 9]. This publication was completely different from
  the one in 1958. Bauer Type Foundry used this first publication to promote the typeface
  Beton from Heinrich Jost that was new at that time. All the illustrations but also
  the text were based on this typeface. In 1958 the text and illustrations had as
  subject Futura that was a longrunner in sales at Bauer. So the design sheet of Futura
  that was published in the 1958 publication was first published in 1958 and never
  before as far as I know. So I think that this sheet was never near Kramer as presumed
  by Christopher Burke in the caption of Baseline and has always been in the archive
  of Bauer Type Foundry being one of the first designs of Renner that he delivered
  to them. In the caption of the 1958 publication of Bauer the design is dated 1925
  but because Renner showed first cuttings during lectures in february 1925 (see above)
  and Burke also writes that first trial cuts by Bauer were done in the winter of
  1924/25 I think that this has to be an earlier design and maybe has to be dated
  to 1924 because the setting trials as published in July 1925 in Ehmckes Schrift
  had already a similar design of the capitals on this sheet.\r\n\r\nDespite the findings
  this story leaves an odd taste in my mouth about the role of Ferdinand Kramer. It
  is hard to believe that a respected architect and designer like him would claim
  something he has not made. But maybe others can look into that and could find an
  explanation for that.\r\n\r\nLiterature:\r\nBauer, Konrad F., Wie eine Buchdruckschrift
