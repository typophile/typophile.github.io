body: I have been shooting some photoes of the old font used by the tram in Copenhagen.
  I am thinking about taking it to the digital level, but want to make sure that it
  does not exist. Does anyone konw anything about this font???

  body: I haven't seen it before, and I think it's great raw material for a grunge
    sans serif. It pleasantly reminds me of <em>'End of Print'</em>-era Newlyn.
