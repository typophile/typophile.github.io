body: This one is giving me a headache cause I think in the back of my mind I have
  seen this exact font someplace before or even had it installed on my system at one
  point. At first I thought it was Octin College Black.. but it's not an exact match..
  can any one help me ID this? Thanks![img:sites/default/files/old-images/FN0P_4241.jpg]

    to this image but different. some random college style lettering.\r\n\r\nJoe"

  body: Cool, thanks guys.. Just that i've seen a few t-shirts being printed now with
    the same typeface, maybe it's just a vector path job rather than an actual font!
    Think i'll stick with Octin College then!
