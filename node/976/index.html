<div class=commentbody>>Adobe is not dumping. I did the math. It's 25c per font per CPU. <br> <br>Dumping is not about per unit calculations. The issue here is a software giant's ruthless marketing practices. <br> <br>Like most foundries, ShinnType has several kinds of volume discount. However, at the Adobe Classics for Education rate, I'd have to sell my complete collection of 108 fonts for around $25. That would smart. <br> <br>Maybe the smart thing for me to do would be to offer educational institutions my entire catalog for free -- a great way to get impressionable young designers hooked on my fonts. <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Many Adobe fonts make their way into every designer's list of standbys simply by virtue of being bundled with Adobe apps. I remember Spiekermann's Officina really taking off in the US when Illustrator 6.0 came out. Both versions were bundled with it, and it started popping up everywhere. <br> <br>I would speculate that the Adobe Type Department has the financial and technical resources it has largely by virtue of other software revenues financing it. I don't know if technologies like OpenType and tools like the FDK could been built and supported by a type-only company. If Emigre or FontShop release their own operating system and design software, I'll be the first to buy them, but I'd guess they would rather focus on type. <br> <br>Adobe has invested heavily in their designs and as such should be allowed to market them however they choose. Blaming Adobe for this or that design school graduate's bad judgment or lack of interest in (or knowledge of) independent type strikes me as blame misplaced. And there is nothing to stop an independent designer from working out a bundling deal with some big software company.</div>

<div class=commentbody>> What business sense does it make to denigrate clients? <br> <br>The more you care about "business sense", the less likely you are to develop rewarding human partisanship among your peers, and the less likely you are to mark your place in culture. That's how humans work - but of course, to each his own. Personally, I think Capitalism is criminal. <br> <br>In the late 80s I used to work as a salesman at Creative Computers (long live the Amiga), and my best moment wasn't when I sold a $13,000 system through an honest laudation of its merits, but when I put a primadonna customer in his place: he was a bit too demanding about returning something, so I became a little rough with him. He challenged "Are you the owner of this business?" My reply was of course: "I would never own a retail store." <br> <br>I have no reason to blame you for accepting work from dinosaurs, but if that makes you complacent about adapting to a changing employment dynamic, you might end up stuck in the cold. <br> <br>> what are you referring to as far as typographic style <br> <br>Too many type designers -and type users- are stuck in the past. <br> <br>Specifically, the 70s style might be described as having among other attributes: pulpy, flowing connections between stems and arches/horizontals; mannered terminals; and a goddam obese x-height. Think ITC.. then banish the sewage from you mind! :-) <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>[off-topic rant] <br>I have to disagree with some of the comments made about graphic design rates. <br> <br>Here in Canada, the standard shop rate is around $150/hour, with the really good places charging a lot more, and freelancers charging somewhat less. But the idea that any yahoo with an Internet connection in Podunk, Lebanon can charge $10/hour or something is ridiculous. It's awfully hard to make *any* profit if you're charging less than $100/hour when you have to pay for: <br> <br>1. Office space (even cheap office space) <br>2. Expensive computers and upgrades (no, bare-bones systems don't cut it in the design business) <br>3. A dozen expensive software packages, which need to be upgraded frequently <br>4. A decent library of fonts <br>5. Lots of unbillable time spent on administration, marketing, and accounting <br>6. Technical costs - broadband Internet, domain names, web development space, email addresses <br>7. Deadbeat clients who disappear or don't pay <br>8. Your own health, dental, and accident insurance <br> <br>On top of that, 95% of all clients with money live in medium-to-large cities, and 95% of them demand face-to-face contact with designers. If you're going to stay in a small town with low rent, you have to settle for the other 5%, and it's awfully hard to get business from someone you've never met. And you still need to courier lots of CD-ROMs and artwork proofs - ruling out a residence in countries remote from your market. <br> <br>So no, you can't charge peanuts and make money in design. Many firms claim to do so, but I guarantee they're using pirated software and fonts, like my old employers, who still went broke (they charged only $60/hour). Ditto for all cheap Bangalore design shops. It's killing the software and design industries in a single blow. <br> <br>[/off-topic rant] <br> <br>So there's not that much of a comparison between graphic designers and strictly type designers. <br> <br>Paul</div>

<div class=commentbody>Well, a freelance type designer really only needs to own a half-decent computer and a copy of Fontlab. Most of the expenses above don't come into it - though I don't doubt that type designers have problems of their own making a living. I've just begun dabbling in it. <br> <br>Paul</div>

<div class=commentbody>Paul, I think your view is seriously skewed. Graphic design isn't just done in places with high cost-of-living, it's done everywhere, and it's very fair to say most non-Western big cities are much cheaper to live in, and not just in terms of renting space, but daily expenses, like goddam pet insurance and other idiocities. I was in Armenia for 9 weeks in 2000, and I paid more per day for my dog's kennel back in the US!! Plus I was talking about type design, which has much lower overhead costs than graphic design in general. <br> <br>It's not impossible to nab clients that are used to paying a lot more to get the same results but would like to save money, either by traveling to the client once in a while, or through a nice website, etc. <br> <br>Clients will gradually require less-and-less physical contact, prepare yourself! <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Hrant said <br> <br>>I have no reason to blame you for <br>>accepting work from dinosaurs, <br>>but if that makes you complacent about <br>>adapting to a changing employment <br>>dynamic, you might end up stuck in the cold. <br> <br> <br>Blame? <br> <br>Well, I personally love the virtual interaction-only customer world. And since 1988 especially (and 300/1200 kbaud modems, ouch!), we've had a lot of great clients in far flung places that I've never met during projects. Or that I only meet eventually at trade shows. <br> <br>What I was saying was that it makes good business sense to be ready to work with clients on their own terms, rather than starting by demanding that they adapt to your terms, or [you] won't work with them. <br> <br>Clients come in all kinds. A designer, or type/special type projects designer, must be ready to accommodate that. <br> <br>That clients are demanding of working with designers in an urban location, say NYC, certainly doesn't make them dinosaurs. <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>>Too many type designers -and type users- <br>>are stuck in the past. <br> <br> <br>Yes, too many designers and art directors are have pigeonholed themselves slavishly using bad choices from the past. <br> <br>Mediocre choices. <br> <br>Choices that whimper and squeak, instead of having a demonstrative tone of voice. <br> <br>Choices that are just plain wrong for both subject matter and for the text itself that the copywriter has entrusted to them to breathe graphic life into. <br> <br>That's the biggest sin in graphic design today. <br> <br>I blame desktop publishing, to a degree, and the limited availability at the outset. <br> <br>Plus, as noted elsewhere (appropriately) the simple dumping of certain fonts and families into the market along with bundling. <br> <br>Application font bundling = bungling. <br> <br>It means that the marketers have run out of competitive ideas. And that the application itself really also ought to be suspect. At least that release version. Bundled fonts are disguises on a bigger problem. <br> <br> <br> <br>>Specifically, the 70s style might <br>>be described as having among other <br>>attributes: pulpy, flowing connections <br>>between stems and arches/horizontals; <br>>mannered terminals; and a goddam <br>>obese x-height. Think ITC.. then banish <br>>the sewage from you mind! :-) <br> <br> <br>Why be closed-minded? <br> <br>We're working in the most creative medium in the world! <br> <br>Well, it's true that some type designers (me, for one) love many of the type attributes (such as those you cite) that were actually 'discovered' in the late 1800s and early 1900s, and then brought to bear again in some great designs of the '60s, '70s and '80s. <br> <br>While you might prefer working in an oldstyle derivation, not everybody does. <br> <br>And for good reason: Putting to work many of the technique lessons learned by not only earlier work like by designers working with Barnhart Brothers & Spindler, American Type Founders, Lanston Monotype and others, can lead to some very powerful, very evocative, very exciting typefaces. <br> <br>Although International Typeface Corporation can be blamed, like any foundry releasing a very aggressive program over time, for putting out some faces of questionable value, they and their various stellar talented employees and licensed artists have to be commended for also doing some phenomenal work. <br> <br>Also, ITC's big claim to fame, though, was its original goal: standardizing availabilities of type families throughout all markets. With the idea being that finally, there would be ideal commonality of availability everywhere. <br> <br>But this wasn't solely about bald greed, or about creating a monopoly. This was about helping the typographer (the trade type shop) clean up its act and to provide better quality resources to designers on the local level. <br> <br>Before ITC, various (mostly metal-setting) shops in various markets basically bought only what the owner happened to like, with rare exception. ITC presented and made very attractive, the concept of buying typefaces on a subscription program, as they released them, to force the availability into each market. <br> <br>With the outstanding work outgrowing from Photo-Lettering, Inc., by Lubalin, Carnase, Stan, Benguiat and so many untold others behind the scenes, Ed Rondthaler and Ed Gottschall, and others there, got it to work. <br> <br>Their literature design and circulation also fueled a massive growth of interest in typography (whether today, one likes the particular styles, or not). <br> <br>And thank goodness for their efforts then. Because just as with the somewhat later development, sell-in (versus bigger pocketed rivals) and acceptance of PostScript itself by Adobe Systems, if that ITC font subscription program failed, I believe that none of us would have had the opportunity to be here today either designing fonts or contributing to this list. <br> <br>Others emulated them, but only after ITC led the charge. <br> <br>(Now, don't get me wrong here. I'm only so-so on ITC. But I think they did a lot for all of us that we should be grateful for. Much of what they did today is forgotten, and they're simply left with this amorphous noose hanging around their neck of dragging typography down with their typefaces. ITC Busorama, one of my favorites, notwithstanding.) <br> <br>Back to x-height and ITC's typefaces: <br> <br>A lot of designers seem to have gratefully, blindly, inherited the view from some know-little pundits in the press during the mid-1980s (yes, that far back, this snowball started rolling) that a 'large' x-height is just out and out bad. Bad concept. Bad design. ('Large' itself as a descriptor being kind of an amoeba. Hard to pin down.) <br> <br>That's just not true. <br> <br>But decision about ideal x-height for a design has to be carefully considered along with all other attributes, naturally. <br> <br>There are a lot of terrific large x-height typefaces, many of mine included. One of the reasons why my TF Habitat has been such a strong seller, consistently, since 1988, has been the intrinsic power provided in large part by its x-height. The balance versus traditional attributes such as the Venetian style traits provides added interest. <br> <br>In TF Habitat's case, the large x-height, and the way I design it on the body (within the em-square height) contribute to its looking large. <br> <br>This is a tremendous advantage that our users can immediately benefit from in their design work. <br> <br>Not only are shapes clear and highly legible due somewhat to the openness provided by the larger-looking x-height. But the faces hold open great legibility in tiny sizes. They usually look about one to two point sizes than they really are. While not setting any wider. <br> <br>Get it? x-height, if played correctly, can contribute to incredibly powerful design. But you just have to learn how to use it. Just as you have to learn how to avoid drawing type too coarsely. Or, how to properly construct a serif so that it doesn't overpower. <br> <br>I have to say, too, that ITC Garamond takes a lot of heat for no reason. True, it might not be a traditionalist's Garamond. That's all well and good. But I believe that Tony Stan really did a watershed body of work in ITC Garamond, and especially in the Condensed. <br> <br>Not because it has been synonymous with Apple Computer for so long. After all, ITC Garamond first came out in 1975-77, as ITC continued to add the Condensed series. <br> <br>Around late 1983, during its corporate identity revamping, I recall Tom Carnase's NYC studio and perhaps Apple's ad agency at the time (BBDO? Or ChiatDay?) chose it for its modernness and rubbery adaptability. <br> <br>It was a great choice for Apple, in its original, photo-headline set form. Really splendid. Nothing in print at the time could touch it. (And at the time, there was a lot of other great print also being done.) <br> <br>It was only later (1986?), when Apple apparently commissioned Bitstream(?) to adapt ITC Garamond to some weird amalgam of normal, semi-condensed and condensed letters, that things started to go haywire, with an apparent in-house version then snaking its way into their print. <br> <br>Stem weights started to modulate out of control. Spacing was generally atrocious. I wondered a lot why no one seemed to care, judging from the typography in the ads. <br> <br>And looking back through a lot of reference regarding the origins of Hamburgefonts, for a different thread here, I was reminded again of the sheer number of very horrid implementations of ITC Garamond out there during the '70s and '80s. Despite, I'm sure, ITC's best efforts at continuity. <br> <br>Look at H. Berthold AG's no-bones-about-it, I'm-going-to-redraw-your-supplied-art-no-matter-what-you-say stance. But at least, they did it pretty well. Others, like Itek, Autologic, and many others, did horrible conversions of ITC font masters. <br> <br>(The baseline for overall comparison, ITC's own specimens, were for the most part typeset on the Alphatype text-setting system, by the way.) <br> <br>So, I, for one, want to say, thank you, Tony Stan. I think you've done a fantastic job. And I'm glad to know you, if only through your work. <br> <br>Whether considered as a poster child of '70s style or simply on its own merits, the original ITC Garamond and Condensed really is amazing. <br> <br> <br> <br>Some advice to newcomers to the type world, and to graphic designers trying to understand the nature of type and how it can relate to your work: <br> <br>Don't blindly listen and parrot the blather about how bad x-heights are, how bad all modern design is, etc. that gets spouted. <br> <br>Step back and study type for yourself. <br> <br>There are quite a few people who are given forums in print and online to speak about type as though they know what they're talking about. And they don't. At all. <br> <br>More than half the time, the editors and writers and others who provide them forums have no real idea either, but have pages to fill on deadline. <br> <br>That creates a real witches' brew of generally very bad advice. <br> <br>And **that** is what really drags typography down. <br> <br>Joe <br> <br></div>

You want them to have bad breath and tiny forearms to be dinosaurs? <br> <br>> Why be closed-minded? <br> <br>How is having ideas about the requirements of cultural <br>progress (as opposed to making money, to buy crap) being closed-minded? <br> <br>> While you might prefer working in an oldstyle derivation, not everybody does. <br> <br>The point is: <br>1) The more you like the 70s or Old-Style or anything else, the less you can mark cultural progress. <br>2) It's good to tame what you like personally - otherwise you're doing much more Art than Craft. <br> <br>> And thank goodness for their efforts then. <br> <br>Yeah, where would we be without ITC Garamond... :-/ <br>One of the worse abominations in our craft. <br> <br>To be fair, the technical/marketing stuff ITC did was great.

Move forward, irrespective of how much nostalgia you harbor. <br> <br>x-Heights: anything close to to 70s x-height is indeed bad, for readability. <br>The reason comes simply from the way humans read: <br><a href=http://www.themicrofoundry.com/ss_read1.html target=_blank>http://www.themicrofoundry.com/ss_read1.html</a> <br>Legibility (versus readability) is a mere shadow of the true functionality of text fonts. <br> <br>And the fact that users admittedly don't realize a large x-height is bad for them is the reason they need us designers in first place! In fact it has been empirically shown that users prefer font sizes somewhat too large for optimal reading. The reason is the difference between deliberative versus immersive reading. <br> <br>Also, it goes without saying that readability is totally unrelated to sales! BTW, throughout your arguments is seems that everything is eventually brought around to the <i>business</i> of type... <br> <br>> While not setting any wider. <br> <br>This is dead false. <br> <br>> Step back and study type for yourself. <br> <br>Study <i>readability</i> first, otherwise you're just playing in the dark. And you'll recede into the crevices of history. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Obviously, the graphic came out of the research, not my own imagination! About five years of research at this point, and still going strong, although with diminishing "returns". I admit I haven't done my own field research (too expensive), but by reading and analyzing probably a hundred empirical and anecdotal pieces of reputable research by now, I've managed to "converge the model" so to speak. BTW, a large part of this has been published in my "Improving the Tool" essay in Gunnar Swanson's "Graphic Design & Reading". Feel free to have a rebuttal published! I always welcome any objective challenge. <br> <br>I have nothing to gain by promoting or striking down obese x-heights - in fact my early Armenian work suffered from such obesity! I did a font for a magazine, and everybody thought it was very legible and handsome, but after about 3 issues there were enough letters from readers complaining of reading strain that we had to change it, and they commissioned me to make a digital version of an old-standby, Aramian, an ugly font by all accounts but with a proven track record of good readability. Back then I had no idea why Aramian worked better, but now I've come to understand how my original was fatally flawed: mostly it was simply the obese x-height. Armenian actually has a greater dependence on extenders than Latin, but Latin still relies on extenders heavily for readability. <br> <br>BTW, I don't expect anybody to automatically take my word for it, but if you're going to counter somebody's theories, you need to do some research of your own! If you don't bother doing that, you just have to trust those who have. <br> <br>-- <br> <br>James, if you're thinking about your own extensive experience with signage, I'd point out a key difference: you don't use the parafovea in that type of reading. Two parallel clues are that: sans fonts work better for signage, but not for for books (I hope you agree); and that signage likes loose letterspacing while books like it tight. <br> <br>Another "mainstream" clue is that all-caps text is harder to read (which I hope everybody accepts). The only real reason for this is that all-UC boumas are far less distinctive. <br> <br>That said, any "conclusion" is always tentative, I admit. If one day I see enough evidence that I'm wrong, I'll have to change my stance. <br> <br>Here's another "mushy conclusion": <br><a href=http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/read_rx.gif target=_blank>http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/read_rx.gif</a> <br> <br>This is what might be called a "qualitative graph": the deeper the level of detail, the more tentative it is. For example, the point where the curve touches the maximum up top, and especially the way the curve changes concavity has to be seen in more abstract terms than for example the fact that it goes up and back down, which is a very reliable piece of theory. <br> <br>In contrast to Readability, here's a graph of Legibility: <br><a href=http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/read_lx.gif target=_blank>http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/read_lx.gif</a> <br>which is actually derived from combining Visibility (simply being able to see something is there) and Decipherability (the ability to map a shape to a meaning irrespective of perception): <br><a href=http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/read_dvx.gif target=_blank>http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/read_dvx.gif</a> <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>It's more than a "review", it's an attempt at extracting usable conclusions, and using them! I don't think the definition of "research" is limited to hooking up tachistoscopes to college students. <br> <br>My graphic is not Proof - I generally avoid using that word anyway. It's a way to convey/visualize what really happens during reading, and even though it's simplified, it helps. <br> <br>True, there is no direct empirical evidence of what's a good x-height - that's way too specific for there to be any money in it, and contemporary academia runs on money invested by corporations who make sure the results are useful to their bottom line. And it would be very difficult to quantify it anyway - instead it's a matter of grasping the bigger picture. <br> <br>There is in fact a lot of "adjacent" empirical evidence (like the fact that all-caps is harder to read even though it's bigger, and that about 2/3-rds of [immersive] reading happens in the parafovea) as well as a lot of anecdotal evidence, like the kind that says serif fonts are better for reading. That's certainly true - even some of the Bauhaus boys had to break down and admit it - but that hasn't been proven either! <br> <br>One telling indication that an x-height can be too large for good readability (just like it can also be too small) is that the optimal x-height varies with point size. But there are many other "clues", and once you have in your head a relatively clear model of how [immersive] reading actually works, almost all these little observations/opinions come together very nicely. <br> <br>-- <br> <br>Keith, I didn't write that stuff, Joe did. (Although "abomination" was mine.) <br> <br>And Sarah was half right. :-) <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

(Although, I never wake up in the morning and say, "Dang it all, I'm designin' me a tall x-height typeface to-day! Yessiree!") <br> <br>And for us (as an example), for the most part, the kind of features/advantages I mentioned are what our customers respond to. Breathlessly.

Why apologize for that? Treating our business as a business has been a good thing, and continues to be. (And again, we all want the economy to get better, right? Businesses being run as businesses, responsibly, will go a long way toward economic recovery.) <br> <br>Let's stop this casting 'business' as an evil ogre. It's merely a classification. Like 'serif'. The type industry would not have survived over the centuries and be here today for all of us to enjoy and be a part of, if not for those who ran their typefounding and typesetting businesses as businesses. <br> <br>If you want to run a type design career as a hobby, well, have fun. <br>(Really. I think you should have fun going about what you do.) <br> <br>But the only thing that matters to me in the midst of a type concept is the proper fleshing out of the design. <br> <br>Of course, unless you spend all your time cloning, or doing randomly selected, open ended 'research', and if you expect to have customers, it's important to create what customers might actually want at some point. Yes? <br> <br> <br> <br>>Yeah, where would we be without ITC Garamond... <br>> :-/ One of the worse abominations in our craft. <br> <br>Too bad. Again, if you haven't seen the original Tony Stan workmanship. <br> <br>Clue: What you see in the MacConnection catalog is an example of how some licensing foundry (or otherwise) got hold of it and screwed it up. Horrid digitizing. Horrid spacing. Not the original. It's not the normal width version, squeezed, either. No idea what it is. <br> <br> <br> <br>>And the fact that users admittedly don't <br>>realize a large x-height is bad for them <br>>is the reason they need us designers in <br>>first place! In fact it has been empirically <br>>shown that users prefer font sizes somewhat <br>>too large for optimal reading. The reason is <br>>the difference between deliberative versus <br>>immersive reading. <br> <br> <br>Is that right??! Well, Shazaam! <br> <br>Now when you say 'users' above, do you mean 'art directors, publication designers, graphic designers'? Or, 'readers'? <br> <br>Just curious. <br> <br> <br> <br>(and later, about one of your own earlier magazine typefaces) <br> <br> <br>>...but after about 3 issues there were <br>>enough letters from readers complaining <br>>of reading strain that we had to change it... <br> <br> <br>Fine. That happens sometimes. Live and learn. As you know, especially in editorial environments, things are often rushed (including creative). <br> <br>There's no need to feel badly (not that you do) for having to tweak things over time. And of course, the other thing worth saying is that, especially in an editorial environment, you're lucky you got feedback you could use to effect change that was right for that kind of publication, that culture, that history, that reader. <br> <br> <br>>Back then I had no idea why Aramian <br>>worked better, but now I've come to <br>>understand how my original was fatally <br>>flawed: mostly it was simply the <br>>obese x-height.

And so, it was launched into as 'art for art's sake' (I'll assume, from your description). And later, with feedback, you had your market research for free (except for the disgruntled readers). Great! <br> <br><b>By the way, that kind of outcome is exactly why upfront, face-to-face meetings are a good thing; often crucial. And cannot be replaced by virtual meetings.</b> Otherwise, designers and clients often learn the hard way, as you, unfortunately, did in that instance. <br> <br>I still don't see how that transplants to a despising of all fonts whose x-heights transcend the lowercase mean line. <br> <br>And what's with the use of 'obese'? Having an x-height above the mean line does not render a typeface 'obese'. <br> <br>Not to split hairlines, but as a vertical measurement, it doesn't seem an x-height can possibly be 'fat', which is what 'obese' means. <br> <br>'Tallish' might be better description, if I may suggest it. (Granted, it lacks sensationalism.) <br> <br>Oh, and unless the design is just plain flawed, a tallish x-height does not (emphatically) impede readability due to an inability to properly provide ascenders and descenders. Ascenders and descenders themselves are a related but separate consideration and must be designed properly. <br> <br> <br>On legibility research: Quote a bibliography of what available empirical research that you're referring to, by date, location and sample size, if you're so inclined, please. <br> <br>And most importantly, list the specific typefaces, by typeface weight and point size. <br> <br>I would think that doing so would be doing your readers a great service. <br> <br>Thanks! <br> <br>Joe <br> <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Hrant wrote <br> <br>>Yeah, and child laborers in sweat shops <br>>are a classification of worker. <br> <br> <br>I abhor child labor, too. But which typefounders, now or past, employ(ed) underage workers? <br> <br>And how does unfair child labor out there in the world apply to running a typefoundry as a business? <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>>What do you know about how humans read, <br>>and where did you learn it? <br> <br>Um, apart from the documented research, about 30 years of drawing typefaces, and about 20 years of successfully selling fonts to hundreds of thousands of customers, nearly world wide. And continually engaging customers and learning from feedback. <br> <br> <br> <br>>You can't rely on readers for precise feedback <br>on subconscious issues. <br> <br>I'm sorry; I thought you had said that readers were (quite consciously) saying, (quote), <br> <br>>>...but after about 3 issues there were <br>>>enough letters from readers complaining <br>>>of reading strain that we had to change it... <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>>The vertical em-space is taken up by: <br>>x-height, ascenders, descenders, <br>>and internal leading. Obviously, <br>>the larger the x-height the less room <br>>left for everything else. Duh. <br> <br> <br>Oh, yes, sorry, I forgot to mention: <b>Duh to infinity.</b> <br> <br> <br> <br>>You're not reading what I'm writing. <br> <br>Yes, I think that I am. To the extent that it's readable. <br> <br> <br> <br>(re providing annotation) <br>>In a discussion group like this?! <br>>For now, please read my essay! <br>>But eventually I'll get more formal, <br>>don't worry. I'm not ready yet. <br> <br> <br>Oh, ok. <br> <br>I guess I'd hoped that you had annotated material (such as your essay) on hand to quote from, with copy and paste. <br> <br> <br> <br>>On Typo-L you recently wrote: <br>>"[My fonts] have that large x-height <br>>that I have become so attached to recently." <br> <br> <br>Wasn't me. I haven't bothered with Typo-L in probably more than a year. <br> <br>And besides, if a type designer says that, so what? <br> <br> <br> <br>>You're completely skewing what I said. ... <br> <br>Oh, ok. <br> <br> <br> <br>>Dear huge x-height boys: <br>>just give it up! Your fonts <br>>are less readable. <br> <br> <br>Sorry. Not likely. <br> <br>There are several kinds of fonts that are less readable: <br> <br>1) Fonts suffering from bad concept; <br>2) Fonts suffering from bad execution; <br>3) Fonts whose weight range is badly selected; <br>4) Fonts whose width doesn't suit the concept; <br>5) Fonts that are a bad selection for their reproduction environment (too light for newsprint); <br>6) Fonts whose point size, leading and weight are wrongly selected for the material and platform (book, ad, etc.) and reader (toddler, young, midage, elderly) where they are being expected to perform. <br> <br>Other than that, x-height itself doesn't injure fonts. <br> <br>Yes, there have been some bad designs out there over the years that also have tallish x-height. <br> <br>Now, it might be possible for a later type designer to see that a different x-height might've better suited the original concept. <br> <br>But the x-height itself would not have been what made it a bad design. <br> <br>By the way, I don't believe that either Jim or myself are "huge x-height boys". I, for one, don't like that pigeonholing. <br> <br>I, for one, design with an open mind. <br> <br>Joe <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Hrant said <br> <br>>? What research is that, exactly? <br> <br>Sorry, I'm not the one widely quoting research here. <br> <br>Nor do I have the time.

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>For the benefit of the group, <br>Mr Ovink was, in Hrant's quoted... <br> <br>>13. "The factor of easy writing, which influenced the forms of the alphabet at the time of the scribes, can have no actual significance any more; we have to reckon with the technical requirements of typography nowadays." From G. W. Ovink, Legibility, Atmosphere-Value and Forms of Printing Types, p. 213. <br> <br> <br>...actually talking about (or perhaps around) the typeface 'Peignot' (1937, A. M. Cassandre, designer), and released through the foundry Deberny et Peignot. <br> <br>As many might recall from writings about it, the foundry Deberny which released it hailed its biform goodness as the second coming of the alphabet. <br> <br>Interestingly, Archie Provan and Alexander Lawson write of Peignot in their 1983 '100 Type Histories, Volume II', that Peignot "actually returned to some of the 6th century uncials". <br> <br>And that "The type was so successful that two other weights were added latter [sic]." <br> <br> <br>A sidebar word of warning: On page 204, Ovink describes the typeface 'Bell' as "fresh, racy and tender; ...". <br> <br>No, I'm not making it up. <br> <br> <br>Pretty obviously from his point of view of the type industry, and since Peignot was released probably 1/4 to midway through his writing his book, Mr Ovink was likely just as dazzled as the rest of the world at the time, by Cassandre's and Deberny's masterworks. <br> <br>(Say what you will about Peignot. Without it, there would be no 'Planet of the Apes' types.) <br> <br>;-) <br> <br>Mr Ovink was noticably roiled that Deberny was hailing it that way, without research to back up that it was the secong coming, saying even that Deberny was "pretending" that Peignot was indeed the only typeface ever to be used again. That all others should be vaporized (my words, to compress it). <br> <br> <br>And so we see that even then, there are those around who would squash type design creativity and its promotion. <br> <br>Now, where would we be today without the landmark promotion of typefaces that Deberny et Peignot heralded? The answer is: much less well off, creatively. <br> <br>Is Peignot a 'text face'? <br> <br>No, of course not. Can it be used for text effectively? Long text? Sure, depending upon how the designer designs with it. <br> <br> <br> <br>Interestingly, reading on to page 214, Mr Ovink continues: <br> <br>"The French are masters in black and white. Perhaps owing to financial reasons, compelling to get maximum profit out of a few types, they reached a high level in the art of "mise-en-page". <br> <br>(He then spends a paragraph reminding everyone that the pinnacle of printing perfection was only to be found in France.) <br> <br>And that the French, with so few types to choose from within their country, naturally turned to color and paper variety to pick up the slack of creative presentation. <br> <br>Ah, the French. And how Mr Ovink understood them. <br> <br>At least by the middle of p. 214, Ovink finally, no doubt grudgingly admits that Charles Peignot, and the firm Deberny & Peignot, did do stellar work on the order (in his words) of Klingspor, Bauer and U.K. Monotype.... <br> <br>>17. "The abilities and the condition of <br>>the reader play an important part; <br>>these differences in reading-skill are <br>>not to be neglected." Ovink, p. 113. <br> <br>Well, duh. <br> <br>More significantly, on p. 113, he says, <br> <br>"The rapid reader needs a small, thin, close and narrow type" [giving the examples Baskerville and Fraktur (!)]", <br> <br>the slow reader needs a large, thick, wide type" [examples cited: Schoolbook Old Style, Bookman, Ionic]. <br> <br> <br>Oh, how to resolve it? How ever will we resolve it? <br> <br> <br> <br>On p. 112, he quotes that another research team he respected, Tinker and Paterson, had tested these faces: <br>Scotch Roman <br>Garamont (yes, Garamont) <br>Antique <br>Bodoni <br>Old Style <br>Caslon Old Style <br>Kabel Lite <br>Cheltenham <br>American Typewriter (not ITC's; an older one) <br>Cloister Black <br> <br>Ovink states there that of all those faces, only the last two produced significant differences [in results]. <br> <br>(!) <br> <br>Anyway, I'd love to see the results of similar tests with more modern faces and (probably more importantly) more modern printing techniques brought to bear. <br> <br>Can you even imagine what their proof cards used to test with must have looked like? Sure, probably crisp for the day, but we would pretty obviously do much better today. Well, as long as it's printed in France, I suppose. <br> <br>Hrant, maybe Matthew Lesko can direct you to a grant to study it. <br> <br>Joe <br> <br> <br> <br> <br></div>

Sorry, but you're quite off base. <br> <br>How in the world could you possibly draw such a conclusion without knowing anything about what human interface and type design ergonomics research I've studied? <br> <br>Too late for what? As with all responsible designers (type designers or not), one's whole career is a living laboratory. <br> <br>But I didn't just stop there, and let projects and client politics and profitability lead me around by the nose. <br> <br>My research started before I ever entered the field. And has continued - er - continually, throughout. <br> <br>And why do you keep repeating that you believe the most important thing to me about typography is making money? <br> <br>Would you please stop that? <br> <br>If it was the most important thing, why then do you think that I would have started Treacyfaces with the concept of solely learning from the past's mistakes, and then seeking to do better? <br> <br>If I were most concerned with money, at the time we incorporated (1984), I could easily have taken an approach like (for example) The Font Company, knocking off everyone in sight in one way or another. <br> <br>Ultimately so top-heavy with me-too faces that they had to close, selling off their so-called inventory in a fire sale. But before that fire sale, wow, wall to wall investor cash. <br> <br>Well, look where such an approach leads. They're long gone. <br> <br>(I've never even used outside investors....) <br> <br>I've always been quite happy eschewing financial gain to pursue furthering the craft first. <br> <br>First and foremost, I love type. <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>>And don't go dissin' Ovink on me - <br>>has was a giant. <br> <br> <br>Why do you assume that I'm (ahem) dissin' Ovink? Because I both quote him verbatim, and then can draw my own conclusions from the presentations? <br> <br>I can't help it if, at that point in his career, he was down on Cassandre, Peignot...and...the French! <br> <br>;-) <br> <br>But seriously: I didn't say that he didn't do a lot of work to assemble his research. I respect him for the very laborious work, and certainly, for his very labored presentations. <br> <br>But really. It was from 1938. <br> <br> <br>Sorry, I don't talk like a statistician. Never have, never will. <br> <br>And you'll never, ever, ever see me citing research notes referencing cuddly beagles. <br> <br>I'm not going to fill my writing (as least as far as a setting like this is concerned) with needless typographic pseudo-laboratory psychobabble. <br> <br>But that doesn't mean, as a responsible designer, that I don't care about factual studies that are in fact meaningful to consider regarding a project. <br> <br>I simply think you're looking at it from too much a bean counter's view. And to get back to the beginning, I think that your pseudo-citing innuendo can be quite dangerous to graduates entering the field. <br> <br>And that is of course why this will most likely not end in agreeing to agree. <br> <br>I respect you for respecting the research and so taking it to heart. <br> <br>I choose instead to read the research, and then simply take the research with a grain of salt. <br> <br>Especially when it comes to designing something new. Especially when much of the research done has been inconclusive. Especially when so much of typography has moved on since the research. (As much as I respect it.) <br> <br>And especially as the research regards display type (of its day). Er, like Peignot! <br> <br> <br> <br>>> Peignot ... Long text? Sure <br> <br>>You're hallucinating. <br>>Make sure to stop anybody who might ask <br>>you set a book for them. <br> <br> <br>I think you really need to open your mind a little. <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>>The argument is much more than over fonts, <br>>it's about how to mark cultural progress, <br>>as opposed to milking nostalgia and <br>>complacency for money. <br> <br> <br>Well, if you say so. <br> <br>It seems to me that from the body of research done, and how leading foundries and their most talented creative directors and artists, punchcutters, phototypesetting filmmakers, digitizers, etc., have learned from it over the 20th century, that quite a lot of 'cultural progress' has indeed been made in type design and manufacturing. <br> <br>And, as has been noted in type and design industry writings many times during the last century, type design developments have tended to well echo human cultural change. <br> <br>Who's milking complacency here? <br> <br>Joe <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Somebody wrote: <br> <br>"My point was simply that Adobe has probably long ago paid for the fonts it is including in the student pack." <br> <br>This is simply not true. Many of these are relatively recent designs. What *is* true is that few or none of them invoke per-unit royalty payments. This was necessary to get the price down to the level that the educational market would buy it. <br> <br>Nick Shinn made some comments about the "ruthless" nature of the pricing of the Type Classics for Learning package at $99/user. I found those comments actually bordering on offensive, but it's probably worth explaining why it exists. <br> <br>The pricing of Type Classics for Learning has little to do with ruthlessness or even direct competition, and a lot to do with the realities of the market: <br> <br>- schools aren't willing to pay much for fonts <br>- schools and their students will use (and pirate) fonts if they don't pay for them <br>- ergo, we are probably better off licensing some fonts cheaply to the schools. We get some money, which is better than none, and they get a legal license, and we promote legitimate licensing over piracy. <br> <br>Personally, Nick, I think it would be perfectly reasonable for you to license your whole set of fonts for $25/user to the education market. It's not like Adobe is magically shutting you out or something. Sure, we've got a bigger set of better-known fonts, but that's sort of the permanent reality for small, newer, independent foundries trying to compete, and not particular to the education market or our pricing of Type Classics. <br> <br>Regards, <br> <br>T</div>

<div class=commentbody>> I feel like we need to keep a list <br> <br>Well, I tried to do that already, in my Fruitful Avoidance thing. But people are either too "polite" or cowardly for their own good. If it's the former, I can't do much, but if it's the latter, please believe Joe: I don't hold grudges. John Hudson for example has gone years abusing me and never saying a single nice thing, but that doesn't prevent me from complimenting him when due. How can this be? Spine. <br> <br>Jared, just be happy <i>I'm</i> not so sensitive. I've been taking most of the insults lately (the fact that they're sugar-coated only serves to make the insulter look worse, in my book), but I keep devoting my time to Typophile. Put into context why different people frequent this place; if you haven't noticed already, to me this isn't a social club - I'm not here to make friends - even though I've made many through online discussion (as well as subsequent physical encounter), and in fact I have to suspect that's <i>due</i> to my character. Realize that most of the people who dislike me don't object too much to my <i>typographic</i> unorthodoxy, they instead fume about my persistent attacks on the rotten core of their society, yes, the one that created discussion groups, ironically! This is what leads them to tune me out - they fail to separate the politics from the type, hence fail to benefit from the latter. But this "politics" is probably the very reason that so many of our members from outside this imperialistic elite like me. Look carefully at the people who object to me vocally - the demographic is obvious (with maybe a religious factor added too), and has only been reinforced here. <br> <br>See the divide, and my role as a mere catalyst. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>>ruthless <br> <br>Thomas, please don't be offended. This is not personal. Large companies are not people, they are not even run by people, but by departments. Being ruthless is "good business", par for the course for marketing departments run by specialists. <br> <br>Ruthless behavior is considered acceptable in large corporations, but not in individuals. <br> <br>At least Adobe doesn't go after other foundries the way it goes after Quark with its long-running "Switch" campaign. <br> <br>As for your argument (is this a company position?) that students and instructors are going to pirate the fonts anyway, so you might as well make a few bucks, now that's terribly cynical and irresponsible. It really pushes the self-fulfilling downward spiral, practically endorsing that kind of behavior. A company in Adobe's dominant position should take the high road, and take its lumps, rather than dragging everyone down. <br> <br>The theory that a cheap license is better than no licence may make some sense when applied to institutional piracy, as it may obviate the need for rogue instructors to use pirate fonts. But it will have no bearing on instructor or student piracy -- ie when they copy fonts from the institution onto their own computers. In fact it would just make more fonts available for them to steal (providing they kow how). <br> <br>Besides, I do not believe that the majority of institutions engage in font piracy. Sure, there are a few wayward instructors, but they are in fact jeopardizing their position and reputation. <br> <br>With its near-monopoly on graphic design software, Adobe is in a position to demand licence audits of educational establishments for applications and fonts. Or if not demand, than offer certification -- what institution would not want to be certified "piracy-free" by Adobe? <br> <br>It's been my experience in dealing with the IT people at a number of local art and design schools that they take abuse of software licensing very seriously, and are constantly finding new ways to discourage it. <br> <br>(An example: in the type design course I teach, I found that students are not able to open up the fonts on the server to inspect their construction -- as I had suggested -- because those fonts had been specially protected from tampering and copying.) <br> <br>We have to preserve the communal perception/value that piracy is an anomaly, moral weakness, and punishable transgression, rather than something everybody does so it's OK. In the education system, there has to be the higher standard that you CAN do the right thing, uncorrupted by the competitive pressure of the bottom line.</div>

That's not a position I would have considered a couple of years ago.

<div class=commentbody>Totally your call on your pricing choices, Nick. Personally, I'd do it, if it were me. <br> <br>Another way of looking at it--and one that came up in our discussion of it--is that the educational institutions need fonts, and simply can't afford and won't pay anything even vaguely resembling our regular prices. We can leave them stuck with whatever is bundled with their applications, or we can choose to offer them something they can afford. In the latter, we make a few bucks, but more importantly we get the students used to the idea of working with higher quality fonts and having a broader typographic palette. We can hope that as they go on to careers as design professionals they will actually buy more fonts, or get their design firms to buy them. <br> <br>The counter-argument that I am guessing is implicit in your comments about ruthless competition is that you think that this kind of pricing drives down the valuation of fonts by the students. This is of course a risk, but they are used to getting 70-80% discounts on other software, so I don't have much worry that they'll consider this the "regular price." <br> <br>Underware did the same "free until you use it for real work" thing for Sauna, as well. I thought it was a pretty cool and daring move. <br> <br>Although many decisions in large corporations are made for large corporate reasons, many of the decisions made by the type department at Adobe are in fact made at our level. This decision was mostly made by Harold Grey, with input from a bunch of other folks. Personally, I supported it, because I thought that having an inexpensive educational font collection was a good thing. I'm not sure I would have priced it quite so low, but the $99 price point was probably the right call. <br> <br>I'm not saying that I agree with every move Adobe has made. There have even been ideas that have come up, which, if realized, would cause my resignation. But it hasn't gotten that far. Remarkably, Adobe has been pretty responsive to employees saying, "I can see how that would make business sense, but I believe it would be unethical and violate our company's core values." <br> <br>I should clarify that many of these things are around people simply not understanding the intellectual property issues around type. It's a matter of ignorance vs. education rather than anyone knowingly suggesting unethical actions. <br> <br>Cheers, <br> <br>T</div>

<div class=commentbody>I think Adobe is in fact better-than-average when it comes to ethics. And it's great to hear that your allegiance to Adobe is dependent on specific decisions that might be unethical. (It would be interesting to find out what those problematic issues were.) <br> <br>The two things that have really bugged me in recent memory (the latter more than the former) are: <br>1) The acquision of fascetious design patents, like on Garamond. <br>2) The axing of MM. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>
