    to be what Bitstream uses, perhaps it refers to the tools used to create/master
    the font?\r\n\r\nSi "

  body: "Heheh.\r\n\r\nI already tried looking for it. I was just curious if it could
    be used to pin-point the version of the font, e.g. if version 4.5 was released
    in 1999, then a file with that version would likely be released in 1999.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    I like how the 4th hit on google for \"mfgpctt\" is now this thread."
