  now available at MyFonts:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/foundry/FontFont/\r\n\r\nObviously
  this is something we're quite proud of as Kevin, John, Jan, Petra and others have
  been working on this for a long time. I personally think that the inclusion of FF
  faces is testament to the increasing quality of not just customer experience but
  type available at MyFonts overall in the past year. WIth our Foundry Review Board
  (myself, Jan Middendorp, Tiffany Wardle, Adam Twardoch, Florian Hardwig), we've
  become far more stringent in terms of the quality of new foundries; we expect to
  see the same sort of editing and selection - a sort of informal curation - happen
  with new releases from established foundries in the near future. These are all parts
  of a new, more robust, selective and ultimately more useful MyFonts, which began
  with our redesign a few years back, and which we think makes us the most complete
  type-buying marketplace in the world.\r\n\r\nI am very proud to be associated with
  this company, as you can probably tell; bringing Fontshop's exclusive FF faces \"into
  the fold\" is a celebration of our growth, and we hope shows that we're on the right
  path."
