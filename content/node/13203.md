body: So, I've got all these kerning pairs set up in TypeTool, but when I output the
  font as Truetype or Type 1, the kerning pairs don't seem to be applied when I use
  the font in any application. Can anyone help me figure out why?

  body: Kerning pairs I hear are a pain in the arse in True Type, actually...I've
    heard that they aren't supported much in True Type format at all. Some pros would
    be able to help you better, but I'd say just focus on metrics.

  body: Hmmm. I just tried typing "AVATAR" in Times New Roman instead, and you appear
    to be correct. I get the same results for Type 1, though. And those are the only
    formats TypeTool exports. Is the whole kerning feature in this program just meant
    to be practice for FontLab?

  body: Aha. Thank you. Microsoft sure does make all those little options hard to
    find, don't they? (I don't use Word very often, but CorelDraw only uses TTF...)

    1 fonts for at least ten years now.

  body: "6. I'm stingy, and I like to hold onto a version that works. It seems to
    me that there comes a point when a company decides that their industry isn't selling
    enough how-to books and training classes, so they rearrange the interface of each
    new upgrade to be as complex, nonsensical, and counterintuitive as possible.\r\n\r\nFor
    raster work, I use and love Paint Shop Pro 5. I tried out 7 once, and found that
    I would be paying to give up the ability to draw a straight line on a flat layer.
    The line tool now makes a new layer containing a vector line each time you use
    it. In fact, everything you do becomes a separate layer until memory runs out.
    So convenient! I wiped it and treasure my 5 disc like gold.\r\n\r\nI once imported
    a book I laid out in CorelDraw 6 into CorelDraw 8 on someone else's computer to
    prepare it for print. Turns out that they defined an RGB equivalent for 100% black
    that's like #050108 or something, to reflect that the fact that 100% of all four
    CMYK is darker. WYSIWYG, you know. Except \"what you get\" is a PDF where all
    the black has turned into a 95% screen. Took me a while to figure out what was
    wrong and what I had to do. I shudder to think what even later versions were like.\r\n\r\nIf
    software companies want any more of my money, they've got to stop breaking their
    product."

  body: v6 for the Mac or PC? v6 for the PC was an utter disaster -- it had a tendency
    to crash JUST as you were trying to save a file, which is pretty inconvenient
    unless you like doing the same work over and over again. However, I do agree that,
    as a rule, Corel has managed to break more things than it has fixed along the
    way. WordPerfect 8 is the last reliable version of that software that they produced,
    and CorelDraw 9 is much better in MANY ways than the subsequent three versions.

  body: Well, it never crashes like that for me, but then, I'm running it on a more
    powerful PC than the ones that existed when it came out, and WinXP is much more
    stable than Win95.

  body: True...it could well be that the fatal combination was v6 and Win 95. After
    my bad experiences with that combination, I never went back to v6 with another
    operating system to see if it behaved any differently. If it works for you, that's
    all that matters.
