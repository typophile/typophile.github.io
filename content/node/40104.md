  on Type & Branding (with a capital \u2018B\u2019) for an MA thesis. \r\n\r\nI have
  a fair knowledge of typography and type design but I am stuck on trying to find
  an angle which isn\u2019t just based on an historical analysis. I need a question
  that opens up the possibility of exploration.\r\n\r\nIf any of you out there have
  any suggestions I would be really grateful.\r\n\r\nI look forward to hearing from
  you.\r\n\r\nMany thanks.\r\n\r\nBrian"

  body: What about the requirement/expectation that a brand has a <em>tone of voice</em>,
    and the way a typeface is chosen specifically to support or even <em>be</em> that
    tone of voice (this may be a little subjective but it certainly doesn't depend
    on the past too much since the corporate typeface business is relatively young
    and thriving(?), the oldest I can think of being London Underground and the 1916+
    Johnston font) chosen for clarity and differentiation in an already busy environment.
    Branding (and associated typography) is just the same but on a much bigger scale;
    i.e. there's a lot of noise that a company must rise above if it even to be considered
    let alone be recognised, then cherished and ultimately advocated. Does a font
    really help or are branding agencies and/or typeface designers pulling a fast
    one? (Not necessarily my view but may stimulate discussion.)

  body: "Thanks for responding Nick. I think that the problem with the concept of
    tone etc. is as you say, quite subjective and I\u2019m concerned that I may end
    up going down the road of type classification which presents a lot of potential
    traps. To kick it out there a bit further, I think that you could argue (as Bruno
    Maag has) that the Roman\u2019s Trajan was the first example of lettering being
    used as a branding tool and onwards and upwards from there.\r\n\r\nI was pottering
    around with the idea of neutrality and sans serif (with a nod to Kai Bernau and
    his recent type face) and how this concept extends into branding in supposed neutral
    zones such as airports etc.\r\n\r\nAnd then there is also the concept of 'white
    writing' or 'transparency' where there is a deliberate attempt not to influence
    tone and we can see examples of this in such things as goverment documents which
    employ 'Type Writer' style fonts.\r\n\r\nDo type faces help to progress brand...Well
    often times I suppose the type design is re-designed but the core elements of
    the brand stay the same no? This may suggest that type design is part of the top
    soil we associate with brand design and not integral to its DNA - or is it? "

  body: "Brian,\r\n\r\nI'm not quite sure what you are trying to do for your thesis,
    but the moment I read Type & Branding my mind went into a few examples:\r\n\r\nApple
    used Garamond for a while, including during the launch of the iMac in all its
    candy colored glory (you know, the ones that said YUM in big Garamond, which legend
    has it was condensed an extra 80% or something like that). You could pinpoint
    an Apple ad instantly through the use of Garamond. Then one day, bam, Myriad!
    A complete 180-degree turn in type and brand association.\r\n\r\nA smaller brand,
    but McSweeney's also uses Garamond until it bleeds.\r\n\r\nVolkswagen and Futura.
    There is a custom Futura version somewhere just for VW. And it goes all the way
    back to the iconic Lemon ad.\r\n\r\nMartha Stewart Living and all of the custom
    H&F-J fonts they use.\r\n\r\nThe examples are many -- you could do a whole chapter
    on Helvetica alone (American Airlines, American Apparel, Parmalat) -- and you
    could do an interesting study of what fonts make recurring appearances in certain
    industries, as well as seeing which typefaces become instantly recognizable and
    associated with a certain brand. Sounds like an interesting challenge. Good luck."

  body: "Brian, Armin -- Helvetica alone is an over-ripe plum for the picking. So
    many companies use Helvetica or a close variant like Akzidenz et al, for their
    logos, and as Nick Shinn has pointed out, the thing has become the de facto voice
    of corporate facism.\r\n\r\nI don't know about \"facist\" connotations, but certainly
    you could say \"blandness\" and \"homogeniality\". Helv is like a dark blue corporate
    suit---thousands of companies are able to differentiate themselves with different
    shades (individual logo designs), yet they are all cut from the same basic cloth.\r\n\r\nThat's
    paradoxical.\r\n\r\nHow can it be? The answer isn't too hard to figure out, but
    an etensive explanation might make fascinating reading.\r\n\r\nThen again I could
    be barking up an ersatz tree with plastic leaves that taste horrible.\r\n\r\nj

  body: "Armin, James,\r\n\r\nThanks for posting. I guess Helvetica could be the most
    topical of all fonts and the most widely recognised. I think also that a backlash
    (in answer to the Gary Hustwits film) would be topical and possibly needed. The
    film seems to pay only meek lip service to the counter argument and concerns itself
    only with Helvetica\u2019s use in lettering. All mentions of Helvetica\u2019s
    success in continuous text are neatly done away with and I would agree with Paul
    Rands view that as body text it\u2019s not great.\r\n\r\nWhat may work about Helvetica
    is that it is construed as \u2018received pronunciation\u2019; a one tone fits
    all approach. More recently are we starting to see foundries produce popular fonts
    with a little more character and personality? The fact that The Guardian\u2019s
    Egyptian face came partially from the teams search for a replacement for Helvetica
    interests me. Was it changing times that inflected the fonts design? A little
    more bite? A little less neutral?\r\n\r\nI think what may be an interesting concept
    is that the recent film serves as the death notice for the popularity of fonts
    like Helvetica. Is modernist, corporate design finally dead? What is the next
    step?\r\n\r\nI basically need to find an edge to this thesis that deals with more
    than just examples of different fonts and their uses within identity design. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s
    tricky because if I had it my way (and perhaps one day I might!) I would write
    a straight thesis on type in branding but I think my supervisor is pushing me
    for something more. I think he\u2019s pushing the idea of \u2018type as product\u2019
    and \u2018brand extension\u2019, translating a type faces core design elements
    into another area  (i.e. a brand of Helvetica soap, nice clean and neutral). \r\n\r\nHe
    gave me Franco Maria Ricci as an example. It's kinda confused me."

  body: What about "Where Type has become Brand and what made it happen" or "Can type
    alone equal brand? The next step for corporate typography..." i.e. is there an
    example of a typeface alone (the letters alone rather than a hackneyed collection
    of the few letters from a logotype like you sometimes get with e.g. Coca-Cola)
    connoting all the brand values of a company. So "The logo is dead...long live
    the font". There have been many relatively recent examples of a logo/marque/visual
    device being used alone without typography; can this situation be reversed so
    that one doesn't need a logo but just a font? (Does the 'global village' with
    its plethora of languages/alphabets/letterforms even allow for that?) or is logo
    everything?

  body: "Yeah. I think you're onto something there Nick if we can hammer it down a
    bit more. If I have you right, you're suggesting that a bespoke type face might
    be as viable in the future as the traditional marque. So this means that the type
    face is doing all the work instead of the logo. I like it.\r\n\r\nQuite recently
    I have been doing research into other areas of design and I came across Naoto
    Fukasawa who has a very interesting approach design.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.businessweek.com/innovate/content/jun2007/id20070629_200809_page_2.htm\r\n\r\nOne
    big issue faced by any large corporation is winning the hearts & minds of people,
    not just consumers but perhaps more importantly the people who help bring a brand
    to life, the employees. Naturally you need employees to live the brand and take
    it in as a way of thinking, so what approach can you take in order to make this
    happen? One possible suggestion would be to create some interplay between the
    brand and the employee/consumer. However, the big question is how can this be
    achieved?\r\n\r\nIs it necessary to break away from rigidity of certain identity
    guidelines? Is it possible to develop an identity that allows employees the ability
    to choose how they would like to see the brand represented? Are there any current
    examples of this now?"

  body: "I don't know if this works withing your scheme of things, or if there's enough
    to make a thesis, but it may be interesting to explore vernacular typographic
    nuances in global brands, particularly in categories where the audiences are predominantly
    external - airlines, tourism, ethnic cuisine, etc.\r\n\r\nOn the one extreme are
    brands where the typography often overtly reflects regional influences.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Thai_6176.jpg].[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Mex_6065.jpg].[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Singapore_5942.jpg].[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Emirates_6590.jpg]\r\n.\r\n\r\nOn
    the other are brands that seek to articulate certain favourable aspects of their
    regional origins by subtle typographic devices, but choose to be, by and large,
    international in expression:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Incredible_India_Logo_4100.jpg].
    [img:sites/default/files/old-images/JAL_mark_6026.jpg]\r\n.\r\n\r\nOne may also
    look at categories where brands of regional origin went through redesigns to shed
    vernacular elements in an effort to gain greater international acceptance. Hankook
    and LG are two brands that did it in their own different ways.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Hankook_5963.jpg].[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lg_logo_6366.jpg]\r\n.\r\nFinally
    there are the international brands that adapt to vernacular typography in local
    markets:\r\n.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Coke_4664.jpg]\r\n.\r\n.\r\n
    \r\n\r\nSo what are the typographic nuances/devices that convey regional flavour?
    How subtle can these interventions be and still communicate effectively? To what
    extent can you go before the 'interestingly exotic' becomes 'uncomfortably foreign'?
    \ How far can typography reflect regional forms and still stay 'on brand'?\r\n\r\nMaybe
    worth a look :)\r\n\r\n"

    that. I will have to give that some thought as it gives a more global perspective
    (something an MA project wouldn\u2019t suffer from). I presume getting type right
    in those cases must be a slow process - little too much and its too kitsch, little
    too subtle and its lost. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m inclined to agree with James though
    that the \u2018next step\u2019 is humanism and it will be interesting to see it
    played out. We are possibly seeing quite a bit of it already with looser styles.
    This may stem from other developments outside of design that appear to be influencing
    our general psyche.\r\n\r\nWill we start to see a move away from machined looking
    design? More freestyle?\r\n\r\nI like the concept behind the Bugatti and the idea
    that the entire car itself represents the marque. No longer will we have the age
    old acid test of \u2018Now take away the logo and see if you can still tell that
    it's blah blah blah\u2019 the brand will be completely represented in itself.\r\n\r\nIs
