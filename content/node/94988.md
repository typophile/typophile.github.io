  body: It's not early. Almost as soon as the 2012 Olympics are over, some efforts
    at publicizing the 2016 Olympics will begin, even if major advertising efforts
    will take place closer to the actual date of the competition - starting at least
    in 2015, so people can book hotel rooms and the like.

  body: "I\u2019m very impressed with this typeface, but not as a work commissioned
    for the Olympics.\r\n\r\nSorry, but the (albeit lovely) bounce of this type design
    really doesn\u2019t re\uFB02ect the discipline and rigor involved in athletic
    training and competition. Although a few sports/games do have elements of freestyle.\r\n\r\nWould
    it not be possible to write a PR release free of bullshit?\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s face
    it, this represents the international tourism clich\xE9 of Brazil, it\u2019s a
    Mardi Gras carnival font.\r\n\r\nJust substitute \u201Cdance\u201D for \u201Csport\u201D
    and \u201Cdancer\u201D for \u201Cathlete\u201D in the PR, and it makes perfect
    sense. That can\u2019t be right, sport isn\u2019t dance."

  body: "Nick, the money comes from the spectators, so the font is for the spectators,
    not the athletes, and watching the Olympics hasn't been about discipline and rigor
    for quite a number of years now. Now it's just a great vacation or a decent staycation;
    I've done the former in Barcelona and the latter in LA, and there was nothing
    strenuous about them! Offhand I can only think of the 24 Hours of Le Mans as being
    strenuous for spectators.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Would it not be possible to write
    a PR release free of bullshit?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe spinners getting this sort
    of thing financed would be out of a job without it. Consider all the \"anchor\"
    and \"upward movement\" BS involved in the selling of the new Turkish Lira symbol
    (which I actually find quite decent of itself). Just go with the flow, and focus
    on the actual font.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    (because it's not an investment, it's just buying stuff) are the consumers, buying
    cable coverage, airfare, t-shirts, etc. That's where the sponsors get the money
    that they spend on the event (and of course they keep a big chunk of it).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I think of the Olympics as an event, and not as a 'local happening'. I guess
    in its purest state the Olympics were once upon a time marketed as being all about
    athletic achievement.  And to me - having spent a lifetime in sport - I feel that
    this go 'round in London is bang on the money.\r\n\r\nEverything about the 2012
    Olympic event is raw to the bone. The sites, the font, the logo, the army, the
    ground to air missile launch sites, the brand police, even the local issue of
    traffic control is raw to the bone, mean, nasty stuff. It all competes in harmony
    with the force an any of the Olympic athletes. \r\n\r\nBrazil 2016 seems to be
    more about a temporal event place - interpretation - disassociated from the Olympic
    competitions brute force energy. Brazil 2016 might just turn out to be a like
    a smoothie you'd buy at the local convenience store. \r\n\r\nn."
