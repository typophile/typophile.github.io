body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am trying to decide on a typeface to use for my own portfolio/identity.
  I'm a pretty big fan of Din, but it seems like it is being a little overused lately.
  I like how it is mildy- techy and mildly-retro feeling, but not over the top, I
  suppose. It feels very what-you-see-is-what-you-get (objective, maybe) while still
  having a bit of distinction. Of note, industries I'm interested in working with
  in the future: design-industry related (architecture, ID, etc), fine-art/gallery,
  editorial/book design/publishing.\r\n\r\nI am looking for other typefaces similar
  to Din: objective, modern, geometic. It would be great if this typeface could work
  well for both headlines and for body type, print and web. I'm putting together a
  web portfolio, resume and business card.\r\n\r\nI'm new to all of this (just finishing
  up my degree) and still trying to figure out what it is that I'm responding to when
  I have a reaction to a typeface - good or bad - and I really like Din. I liked Neutraface
  for a while (but now it feels a little too quirky for my tastes), and Trade Gothic
  has been a staple of mine for sometime. I don't know what all of these have in common.
  \r\n\r\nI appreciate the help!\r\n\r\nErin\r\n"

    to browse if you haven't done so already:\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/alternatives/din_alternatives/\r\n\r\nAnother
    thing that comes to mind \u2013 you might like some stuff at <a href=\"http://lineto.com/The+Fonts/\">Lineto</a>.
    Not cheap, but their stuff is mostly quite current, rather geometric/constructed
    and clean, and probably only overused if you're in Zurich ;-). I've been wanting
    Gravur Condensed for a while, which is sort of DIN-ish: http://lineto.com/The+Fonts/Font+Categories/Text+Fonts/Gravur+Condensed/"

    to me this is a friendlier DIN.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.newlyn.com/fonts/fonts/frank|Frank]].\r\n\r\nThere
    are a lot of good options in the link Nina gave above."

    want all of them (well, maybe not all of them, but enough of them). Also, the
    link to the indentifont site is very helpful.\r\n\r\nThanks so much for the help!"

    Draw, not re-draw\r\n\u2013 From the DIN 1451-2 standard sheets, yes, but not
    from the fonts DIN Mittelschrift and DIN Engschrift (from Adobe/Linotype), not
    from FF DIN or from most other commercially available versions of the DIN typefaces
    or designs that relate to them.\r\n\r\nTo be more precise:\r\nDIN 1451-2 is not
    a \u201Edesign in the public domain\u201C, it is a standard. Anyone may produce
    or design typefaces that relate to the standard."
