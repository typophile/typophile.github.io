  can from this little project. I'm trying to come up with a nice handwritten-script
  logo for myself. I may end up using it, but I'm more interested in learning and
  practice at this point.\r\n\r\nI'm anxious to hear your thoughts! I want to improve
  construction, flow, and consistency if possible (and I'm sure it is).\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nBrendan\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wip_bstrom_a1_5045.jpg]"

  body: Thanks for the helpful thoughts, typerror. I will look for some books. Until
    then, here's another sketch. My goal is to keep posting sketches to this thread
    as a way to keep me regularly attempting letterforms. The "m" is downright awful.

  body: "I was looking at some other lettering, particularly [[http://www.agency26.com/bloggg/milk.png|this]].
    I noticed that in this case, the contrast of the stroke occurs its translation
    on the downstroke. I'm sure I'm failing in my attempts to sound like I know what
    I'm talking about. In any case, I tried to mimic what I observed. The 'b' doesn't
    quite fit.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/raw_wip4a_3582.jpg]"

  body: "Both of Michael Harvey's books are good instructional books on just the sort
    of exercise you are embarking on (drawing letters) except they do not, that I
    remember, deal with \"scripts.\" The techniques, though, are there. Johnston's
    is a good historical resource. \r\n\r\nGo to Myfonts and look at scripts, set
    your name/logo in them, and ponder :-)\r\n\r\nGood luck.\r\nMichael"

    into scripts in general. Hand scripting is like playing the piano it takes lots
    and lots of practice. Of course as a side benefit it''s a really good way to impress
    women ; ) '

  body: "Only use an edged pen if you want edged-pen letterforms. Yours look like
    they want to be a formal connecting script. An edged pen will not help you with
    that.\r\n\r\nDoyald Young's books can give you a major insight into formal script.
    \r\n\r\nYou are killing yourself with this with the r and s. The two most difficult
    letters to draw and harmonize in a script. Most of a formal script can be created
    with 3 or 4 main shapes with exceptions for the r and s. And sometimes the x.
    Draw a set of parallel lines that delineate the angle of the script. Draw an i,
    l, n to match that angle with whatever connecting stroke you desire. Then go on
    to the o. Once you have an o and an l, you are on your way to a d. Cut the top
    off of the d and you have an a. The b will be different. Ultimately it is all
    modular, with variations that give it flavor. \r\n\r\nRemember: nnoonon\r\n\r\nStraight
    stroke, curved stroke, connecting stroke.\r\n\r\nStart there and eventually you
    will be ahead of the game.\r\n\r\nThe uppercase is an entirely different matter.
    But modular just the same.\r\n"
