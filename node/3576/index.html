  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"> Im dealing with an agency at the minute who are producing a custom font for a company I work for. As we are increasingly using fonts cross platform for director and powerpoint presentations I was wondering if I should get them to publish the final version in OpenType format. Which OSs / applications are supported at the minute? I dont need bells and whistles, just that the font will work. <BR> <BR>Also is anybody here using OpenType fonts and found any advantages/disadvantages using them. <BR> <BR>Cheers <BR> <BR>Craig </div>

		<div class="commentbody">There&#39;s a lot of information on OS and app stuff in the OpenType User Guide from Adobe, and our readme. Both can be found at <A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/type/opentype" TARGET="_top">http://www.adobe.com/type/opentype</A>. <BR> <BR>Any other comments I make on the wonderfulness of OpenType are likely to be suspect, given my day job, but I can say that OpenType works on Windows 2000 and XP, and Mac OS X, natively. On Windows 95/98/ME and Mac OS 8.6-9.2, you need ATM Light or Deluxe. But of course, you&#39;d need that for Type 1 fonts as well on those OSes. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T <BR> <BR>Thomas Phinney <BR>Program Mgr., Western Language Fonts <BR>Adobe Systems</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I&#39;m having a lot of problems working with OT and can&#39;t seem to find anyone--Adobe, included--who can give me some answers. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m using ATM Deluxe 4.6x and laying out collateral in Quark 4.x. My machine&#39;s performance is severly impaired using them &#40;printing takes longer, page scrolling is a chore, etc.&#41;. Is there a reason for this? <BR> <BR>My main problem is with the local service bureau not being able to handle the OT formats. I&#39;ve checked with them to ensure they are up-to-date with software versions and all of that; they assure me that they are. They are unable to print to any printer, film output device, whatever.  <BR> <BR>Can anyone here shed any light on this? I&#39;ve read all of the readme&#39;s, pdfs, and official documenation at adobe.com, and looked everywhere else I can for more information. While everyone seems to speak highly of OT here, the design community still seem to be resonating with grumblings. <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance. <BR> <BR>cp  <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">For you info, I have done film output on my usual local printer shop from Indesign 1.5 and 2.0 on Mac 9 and Mac X in last september with OpenType fonts &#40;my own OT done with FL 4.5 win version&#41; -- with no problem at all. The film machine was an Agfa something... What is generally need is a rip with PS 3 &#40;5 to 10  years old now I think... but many services bureaus in France still be on PS 2, hum&#41;. <BR> <BR>Miss to say, that I came with my Powerbook, mainly to avoid to give fonts and control everything, its for the Sabon Next brochure and the Charles Peignot book for ATypI. <BR><a href="http://www.typofonderie.com/atypi/cpbook.html" target="_blank">http://www.typofonderie.com/atypi/cpbook.html</a> <BR> <BR>I never trust a printer when he say that he was up to date. Indeed some are up to date! Thanks for us. <BR> <BR>Good luck.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hmmm... re your problem with OT-Fonts, the problem seems to be with the ouput bureau. The only thing about OT is that SOMETIMES they&#39;ll have to be installed locally, at the machine doing the actual output, not on some server location. But that&#39;s about it. When I bought my first OTs via Fontshop US from Adobe &#40;couldn&#39;t buy them directly, as Adobe doesn&#39;t do business with Non-US-Customers on their homepage, alas, so Fontshop helped me for a small fee&#41;, I got MAC Fonts and even those installed perfectly on my XP-machine.  <BR> <BR>OT, although a very problematic format for developer, as I hear, is wonderful from this users perspective. If you work with InDesign and -- as we do -- on Wintel workstations, youi&#39;ll not only be happy about the MASSIVE plus in typographic efficiency and freedom but </div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>OT, although a very problematic format for developer, as I hear, is wonderful from this users perspective.</i> <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been making pretty much nothing but OT fonts &#40;TT and CFF&#41; for three years now, and find them much <i>less</i> problematic than Type 1 fonts. Simply having a single binary file to maintain and ship &#40;rather than multiple outline, bitmap, metrics files&#41; makes OT development much easier and less time consuming. Even when I&#39;m not making an extended character set or adding OT Layout features to a font, I&#39;ll still output a CFF-OT font in preference to a Type 1 because the file format is tidier, more compact and cross-platform.</div>
