body: "As tips go it's a minor one, but...\r\n\r\nI have come up with a way of working
  through & testing my Calt feature script & keeping track of where I am. I put a
  space in the code and move lines code up or down to indicate if I am done with them
  (depending on the direction I am moving throgh the list).  Happily you can change
  code & recompile with the space there & it doesn't break anything.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/screen.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  don't have 5.0 yet so I can't say if this will work in that version.\r\n\r\nAnybody
  else have practical/process tips to share? \r\n\r\nOr a somehow better ways of doing
  this?"

  body: "That's a handy tip, actually. Sounds good to me. It will work fine in 5.0
    as well (the properties of whitespace in the feature code have to do with the
    Adobe-defined syntax for that code, picked up by Fontlab).\r\n\r\nI often put
    comments at the beginning of a feature to indicate exactly what I still need to
    do with it. Because I'm only doing about 10-15 hours a week on type design, it's
    the only way I can keep track sometimes.\r\n\r\nT"

    for use in feature development in BBEdit or any of the other Mac text editors.

    could probably figure it out, but I don't know if it would be worth my time. I
    was hoping that perhaps some other BBEdit user had done it already and was willing

    all.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.marksimonson.com/otfeature_module.plist.zip\r\n\r\nUnzip
    it if it doesn't happen automatically, quit BBEdit if it's running, and put the
    the file into ~/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/Language Modules/ . (If you
    don't already have a folder named \"Language Modules\" in there, make one.)\r\n\r\nNow
    when you open a .fea file in BBEdit, you should see some basic syntax coloring.
    The colors will depend on your preference settings. Nothing fancy, and some character
    names (like zero) are also feature tags, so they will be highlighted. There is
    probably some way to fix this, but, as I say, this is a quick-and-dirty module.
    If anybody gets ambitious enough to improve it, be my guest. But let me know,
    too."
