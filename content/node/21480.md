  body: The typeface upon which this font was based was, in fact, called <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/bric-a-braque-nf/"
    target="_blank">Cubist</a>. Another possibility, although it's really a de Stijl
    typeface, is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/architectuur-nf/"
    target="_blank">Architectuur</a>.
