  and book-text.\r\nThe idea is that  which is slightly condensed\r\nbut which doesnt
  appear that way. \r\n\r\nI would love to hear some critique and feedback here.\r\nWhat
  do you think I should keep focusing on?\r\nWhat are my biggest mistakes.. and so
  on...\r\nIts still very much work in Progress. \r\n(as you for sure can tell especially
  with upper case)\r\n\r\nPlease take a look at the PDF,\r\n(note;  I didnt kern the

  body: Looks like a cross between Folio and Gill. Try keeping the thick and thins

    the stems aren't all the same thickness?\r\n\r\nToby you're right about the caps,
    in fact they look thinner than the lower case.\r\n\r\nNick Cooke"
