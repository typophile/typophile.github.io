body: I'm not even certain this exists, but I'm seeking a display font that could
  simulate the look of rooftop signs--something that even includes the trusses that
  hold it up. I've attached an image of the Hotel Empire sign as reference. Any help
  is appreciated. Thanks!

    suitable font and drawing the trusses yourself.
