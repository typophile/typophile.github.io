  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi all, <BR> <BR>I am currently trying to make FF ScalaSans available for LaTeX.  To do so, I need to know the encoding vectors of the various fonts.  While all fonts with the standard glyph set have been encoded using Adobe StandardEncoding, the expert set is different.  Therefore, I was trying to get the encoding vector that was used for the expert sets.  I contacted FontFont about this, but they replied that I would have to reconstruct the encoding myself, as it differs among their fonts, and they do not have one single encoding vector available to send me. <BR> <BR>Does anybody happen to have such an encoding table for FF ScalaSans?  I have googled for this, but did not find anything. <BR> <BR>    Thanks a lot, <BR>    Marco</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Marco, <BR> <BR>I assume that you are using fontinstall for the task. If that&#39;s the way, then the easiest way to do is hacking afm files. My suggestion is to hack afm file such that it reflects the true name for each glyph in your font -- at the same location, of course. <BR> <BR>For example, GalliardExpertCC-italic has glyph `ff&#39; encoded at location 86 &#40;`v&#39; in 8r encoding&#41;; in this case, I would hack afm such that at position 86, it says `ff&#39; instead of `v&#39;. <BR> <BR>Usually expert fonts contain less than 256 characters, therefore, you do not need to re-encode the font. You only need to tell TeX&#40;fontinstall&#41; to pull the right character from the right slot which is easy enough by hacking afm files. <BR> <BR>You can always fire up a fonteditor and fix the encoding yourself. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR>Chanop</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks, Stephen and Chanop, for your answers. <BR> <BR>Stephen: I have in the meantime contacted Volker Rosenfelder, and it seems that he is able to help me.  Thanks a lot! <BR> <BR>Chanop: Yes, I am actually planning to use fontinst for this task.  I expect no problem in writing the relevant MTS-files &#40;or even, as you suggested, hacking the AFM files&#41;, as soon as I know what glyph lives where in ScalaSans Expert.  Firing up a font editor to construct that encoding myself is, of course, always an option.  I only thought that other people might already have that information, so that I would not have to redo it myself.  After all, that&#39;s what font encodings are for. :-&#41; <BR> <BR>    Best, <BR>    Marco</div>
