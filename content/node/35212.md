  plastic that are placed into roadside or portable backlit signs. The kind of signage
  where numbers and glyphs sometimes do double duty for missing letters. Need a \"D\"?
  Why not flip and reverse that uppercase \"P\"? Out of the letter \"I\"? No problem!
  That's what 1s are for!\r\n\r\nChances are that some of our members have either
  stolen or rearranged the letters to change the original communication. I'm just
  saying.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm trying to identify and locate a digital version of the
  font:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/apply_within_5293.jpg]\r\n\r\nApologies
  if this question has been asked and answered before. Any help would be much appreciated,
  and I won't think less of you for pointing me to a free font that has horrible kerning
  pairs, slightly misshapen letterforms and only one case. ;)"

    is probably not what you're looking for as it's more stylized, but it has a similar
    flavor ...\r\n\r\nCarved Initials by Gerald Gallo\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/gallofonts/carved-initials/\r\n\r\nAlso,
    Harold Lohner used to have a similar font called Pop Up. It's retired now, but
    if you make a request to Harold he might accommodate:\r\nhttp://www.haroldsfonts.com/retired.html\r\n\r\nThere
    are a few kinda similar chiseled fonts here:\r\nhttp://www.stanford.edu/~rdinner/fonts.html\r\n\r\nHope
    this helps!"

  body: Thanks, malbright. I think I'll almost certainly have to use "Pop Up", which
    Harold Lohner has courteously made available on [[http://www.1001freefonts.com|1001
