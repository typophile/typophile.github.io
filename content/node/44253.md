  body: "You will not find it in FLS. You need to use the Terminal.\r\n\r\nFirst,
    you should place all fonts which you want to test in a folder. Then you open the
    Terminal and type\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>comparefamily -d [a space here]</code>\r\nand
    drag/drop the font folder onto the Terminal so its path will be added to the command.
    Hit return.\r\nFor more options, see the font production and font testing PDFs
    linked from the bottom of <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/20078\" target=\"_blank\">the
    wiki entry</a> (especially p.8 of the font testing PDF).\r\n\r\nBtw, with AFDKO
    you have installed TTX too.&nbsp;&nbsp;;-)\r\nUse it like this:\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>ttx
    [drag/drop font files here]</code>\r\nand hit return.\r\nMore details with\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>ttx
    -h</code>\r\nand with\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>ttx -u</code>\r\n"
