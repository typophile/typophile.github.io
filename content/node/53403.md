    logo sites?

    long as there are executives with nephews who learned how to use inDesign, there
    will be crap like this being printed on uniforms, business materials, signage,
    etc. Nothing new."

  body: "@Nachos: I would generally agree with your point about executives' nephews
    and InDesign. In small companies yes, but a major league sports team. This design
    had to pass through the MLB front office for some kind of approval before it would
    go on any uniform. They may be the New York Mets, but they are still a franchise
    of MLB and as such, have to answer to the mother bird.\r\n\r\nBTW, I've been wondering
    about that stupid pixelation myself. I wanted the graphic to be as large as possible
    but not exceed the limits in terms of file size. I don't work on the web and haven't
    really worked in print for quite a while. I guess it shows. I believe the term
    is mea culpa."
