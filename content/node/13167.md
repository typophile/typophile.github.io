  body: "Sweet.\r\nIs the WU combo a ligature of some kind. What is considered the
    alternate?\r\n\r\nStephen, did you check out my plaka joke?  Does that make me
    a complete loser? I was working on some letters the other day and all the sudden
    I got this toothpaste tag line alteration...\r\n\r\nFight plaka buildup, photocopy
    often !\r\n\r\nYou know, plaque / plaka .  Funny. Well, as long as I make myself

  body: The 'W' and 'TH' lig are in the Alternate font. I am not getting the plaka,
