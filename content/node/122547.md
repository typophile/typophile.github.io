  body: "Don't think you'll have good suggestions. My 2 cent:\r\n- 1: these typefaces
    are rather unique (at least to me) so pretty convinced nothing really approaching
    could be suggested\r\n- 2: free fonts are not very appreciated by forum members.
    Most are type designers or type-business related, some sell their creations so
    suggesting alternative free fonts might sound off-topic\r\n- 3: many free fonts
    are actually rip-off/bad copies/illegal clones and have fooled more than once
    many people from this community so suggesting free alternatives is always kind
    of risky\r\n- 4: asking for free alternatives without specifying context/purpose
    could also be wrongly appreciated, possibly meaning you don't want to pay the
    price for the type designer hard work.\r\nAnyway, here are 2 trusted sources for
    free fonts: [[http://www.google.com/fonts|Google Fonts directory]], [[http://www.fontsquirrel.com|Fontsquirrel]]\r\nGood
    luck!"
