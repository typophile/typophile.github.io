  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello,
I have some business users who desire to display a small, but variable, amount of text as a handwritten font on a web page.  They want the handwritten font sitting on blue baselines.  This would simulate the effect of writing on notebook paper.  Basically, a user enters some text into a field, and the website would display this text as this font style.</p>
<p>See attachment for an example of what the display would look like.</p>
<p>Does such a font with a built-in baseline exist?</p>
<p>Thank you for reading this.</p>
<p>Sincerely,
Stephen</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It&rsquo;s possible to have a font with a &ldquo;baseline&rdquo; as part of the design, but there would be no way to make the baseline a different color than the letters. A character in a font can only have one color applied to it, and it must be for the whole character, not just part of it.</p>
<p>None of this matters because you can get the same effect on a web page using CSS. Make a class something like this:</p>
<p>.baseline { border-bottom: solid 2px #e9f2f9; }</p>
<p>Then you apply this class to the text you want the baseline to appear under.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Mark,
Thanks for your advice.  The problem with the border-bottom is that the business users want to display the font in the web browser to all users.  CSS may only suggest fonts via the font-family property (if the font is not on the person&rsquo;s computer, it will default to a system font), and the font-face CSS property is not supported in all browsers.  I had thought of using sIFR (<a href="http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/sifr/">http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/sifr/</a>) to make sure all users see the font, but I had a tough time positioning the baseline in the Flash container.</p>
<p>If the requirement of &ldquo;end user always see this font regardless of browser&rdquo; was not a requirement, then I could do this in CSS, as you stated.</p>
<p>Thank you again for sharing your experience in this.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It has nothing to do with @font-face. This is an old CSS technique that will work with any text (no matter what font) that can be displayed in a reasonably modern browser (meaning any browser released since the late nineties). The border property works on all kinds of html elements. The rule in my example could just as easily be applied to anything, not just text.</p>
<p>In fact, the little dotted underline that appears when you move your mouse over links on this very page uses the same technique, except it&rsquo;s applied to the &ldquo;a:hover&rdquo; element.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>There are actually two problems with using border-bottom in this case. First is that the descenders might get cut off on some of the less compliant browsers and second is a lack of support for multiple lines of text. If you&rsquo;re looking to use multiple lines of text, you could carefully construct an image to use as a repeating background on a body of text. That way, it will appear where you want it, be a different color than the text and repeat properly. It should also be possible to apply the same methodology to a sIFR implementation (though probably a bit harder).</p>
<p>Of course, you&rsquo;re also trying to use a unique font on the web, so if you are only looking at a small number of these elements, then maybe just use photoshop to construct the text the way you want it to look with the baseline you want and place it on the web as an image.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m sorry that I didn&rsquo;t state this clearly, but there are two requirements.</p>
<ol>
<li>Regardless of what browser you are using, you will see the font.</li>
<li>The font sits on a baseline.</li>
<li>The amount of text is variable and can appear on multiple baselines.</li>
<li>The number of these small written passages varies</li>
</ol>
<p>Mark,
Yes, I know that border-bottom will work on any HTML element.<br>
border-bottom satisfies requirement #2, but not #1 or #3 (as Aaron mentioned).  I was trying to ask if all four requirements could be satisfied.</p>
<p>Aaron,
Thanks for the idea of a background image.  I originally had written off this idea, but I will work out a prototype to see if this will work and satisfy the business.  As for using a pure image consisting of text and baseline, I can&rsquo;t actually use that because of #4.  Since the text is entered by users, we would end up having to create hundreds or thousands of these images.</p>
<p>Bert,
Thanks for the link.  I will look into this.  Not sure if we have the resources to create a photofonts.</p>

<p>say you have this:</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt; Text here &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>You can apply a color and text-decoration:underline property to the p tag and a color property to the span. By doing that, you are actually able to color the underline to any color you want while the text stays black (or white or whatever). Bit of a trick, but might be easier than other options.</p>

Yes, the custom font requirement is a pain in the neck.  Our development environment does not use PHP whatesoever, so PHP is out of the question.  I think my tech lead and I are going to propose either sIFR without the lines or some custom Flash object that reads the text and applies the notebook lines within it.</p>
<p>I really wish font-face was available as well&hellip;sigh.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@Cameron Basically, the issue is that by default PC &amp; Mac (I&rsquo;m ignoring linux for now) ship with a certain set of fonts already installed. While for the most part these fonts different from each other, there are some that overlap. Since webpage rendering is done on user&rsquo;s personal computers and any fonts requested by the website are pulled from a user&rsquo;s personal database, it is important to know which fonts will be accessible no matter who visits the site. So, these overlapping fonts are considered &ldquo;web safe&rdquo; and may be used without concern of someone not having that font.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fonttester.com/web_safe_fonts.html" title="Web Safe Fonts">Here is a list of web safe fonts</a></p>
<p>Oh, and the reason I left out linux is because they ship with a totally different set of fonts and need to download, but I assume if someone is using linux, they know enough to take care of that themselves. You don&rsquo;t know how annoyed I was trying to debug a rendering oddity until I realized that the reporter was on linux and <em>didn&rsquo;t have Tahoma installed.</em> <em>sigh</em></p>

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you both, @aaron &amp; @frode frank, that makes perfect sense. As a matter of fact, I disable all but the necessary system fonts on my Mac while working in InDesign, Illustrator or QuarkXPress so that I don’t mistakenly use system Helvetica or Palatino, for example, while designing for print; my font menus just show the fonts I’ve chosen, from the foundries I want to use. Then I activate the set “removed sys fonts” in Suitcase Fusion when I want to get on line. It takes a little bit more time, but I feel it’s worth it, though I’m sure most people don’t want or need a font manager.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi again,
I see there has been posts here after I had concluded my questions.</p>
<p>To Frode:
I finally tried your URL and understand how your Flash works.  I must have completely misunderstood you the first time.  Your solution mostly likely solves my problem, except the Flash file would have to read text from XML, the database, or JSON.  Basically, the user enters the text on one page, but that text would be displayed on another page (where the Flash component actually resides).  If my business users want to go with the custom Flash route, they would probably find someone through their networks to implement this.  (i.e. I have no control on who they hire or ask to do Flash work.).  At least your demonstration shows a Flash solution is possible.</p>
<p>To Aaron:
Concerning font stacks, did you read this article?
<a href="http://24ways.org/2007/increase-your-font-stacks-with-font-matrix">http://24ways.org/2007/increase-your-font-stacks-with-font-matrix</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Basically, I proposed to the business users these options:</p>
<ol>
<li>sIFR (no baselines)</li>
<li>Web-friendly fonts and use CSS to show the underlines.  However, if the user doesn&rsquo;t have the font installed, it&rsquo;ll default to system fonts.</li>
<li>Custom Flash component (I didn&rsquo;t show them Frode&rsquo;s demonstration.)</li>
</ol>
<p>I have not heard their reply yet.</p>
<p>Thanks again for the assistance and discussion.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I have read a number of articles on Font stacks (though not that one in particular), but what I was referring to was actually the whole Typekit news and associated concerns. Essentially, should typekit or something similar go down, there should be a good backup system in place, ala font stacks. Of course, should EOT or font-face become widely accepted, then font stacks aren&rsquo;t really necessary (but would be good just in case).</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Tangst, you&rsquo;re right about the flash file needing to be given the text via an external source, which adds some additional implementation, though if you have so many little quotes, wouldn&rsquo;t you be using a database anyway? So the php script necessary for grabbing all those quotes would already be in place &amp; you&rsquo;d just have to set up an Amfphp script or something similar.</p>
<p>Also, I think you could probably pull it off on the same page by passing variables into a flash file via JS, but I&rsquo;m not sure how to do that myself and I might just be imagining things!</p>
<p>Anyway, hopefully one of the solutions will work for the client! There aren&rsquo;t any really ideal ones sadly.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Frode: Alas, I work in a large corporation, so I don&rsquo;t get to make the decisions here.  I&rsquo;m freelancing at my employer.  I can mention your email if they ever ask about Flash developers, but I have a feeling they probably have someone who they can hire to do this.  The group I am in happens not to have Flash developer, which is why I ended up asking the question here.</p>
<p>AaronBell: The quotes will be stored in the database, but the site is published as a set of static HTML pages (i.e., it is not .PHP, .ASP, .JSP, etc.).  I&rsquo;m theorizing that there will be Javascript to retrieve the data (via AJAX) and &ldquo;inject&rdquo; it into the Flash component during page load (the quote would be carried in JSON or XML).</p>
<p>I also heard about the Typekit announcement, but I have my own set of objections to that.  I&rsquo;d rather continue to do web-safe fonts, sIFR, or font stacks.  I&rsquo;m really hoping @font-face becomes standard across browsers.  If that happens, then the situation is simply contract and rights negotiation with the font designers and foundries.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still waiting to hear back from the business users on which option they want to go.</p>

<p>Wow, really no PHP? It seems like it would be easier to do with PHP so you don&rsquo;t have to rely on the user to be using javascript or waiting for the JS call to complete for the data to be filled in. I guess I&rsquo;ve been working amongst php for so long it seems strange to not use it, especially when you can just drop the quote directly into SWFobject to be passed into flash as an object or into a place for sIFR.</p>
