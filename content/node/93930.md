  help my identify this font? It's for our wedding invitations from William Arthur.
  They have it listed as T341. I've found Feel script and Shelley Allegro script that
  will work in a pinch but it would be awesome to have a closer match. Thanks a million!!!"

  body: "Couldn't find that \"A\" at Mike Yanega's Script ID guide. Neither in the
    six pages of formal flowing scripts nor the nine pages of elegant scripts. But
    you might look there for something closer to what you're looking for  than the
    overused Shelley Allegro.\r\n\r\n[[http://bowfinprintworks.com/ScriptIDGuide.html]]\r\n\r\nIncidentally,
    I couldn't find T-341 on the William Arthur website. Lots of others, though.\r\n\r\n
