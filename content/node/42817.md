body: "I\u2019m attempting to track down this geometric monoline display face (or
  something similar). Given it\u2019s simplicity, I have a hunch that it\u2019s a
  custom job built from outlines. It\u2019s currently being used by for product branding
  by Zoom, a Japanese music accessory manufacturer.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.zoom.co.jp/english/\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-2_5550.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2310273735_9f4b225591_4004.jpg]\r\n\r\nAny
  help would be appreciated.\r\n\r\ng."
