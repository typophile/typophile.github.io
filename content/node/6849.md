  body: This was probably originally Bookman Swash &#40;digital version possibly available
    as OPTI Bookman Italic Swash from <a href="http://www.castcraft.com">Castcraft</a>,
    but you&#39;ll have to call them as their website&#39;s broken&#41;, and like
    Dana said, it&#39;s not the same as ITC Bookman Italic Swash. The sample was probably
    created sometime in the &#39;70s. It looks like someone tried to trace over it
    in an attempt to reproduce it. <BR> <BR>We&#39;ve seen this one <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/24826.html?1075527026">before</a>.
