  the smaller serif lettering for \"Cardinals.\" Tthe semiserif may be a custom modification
  of some neo-grotesque, and the smaller serif style also perhaps hand-lettered. Either
  way, actual fonts or hand-lettered, though, it would be good to know. Thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Univ-Lousville-g_4687.png]"
