    in only makes the sample larger and fuzzier. Despite that, I do think I have identified
    it:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/search/Formata/fonts/\r\n\r\nI will be more careful
    to read who the poster is in the future....\r\n\r\n"

  body: "kthomps5, I think you were projecting your prior hostile impression you had
    of me, and when I said Can't you zoom in, you thought that it was said in an evil
    and commanding tone.\r\n\r\nIn reality, it was an expression of being surprised
    that you haven't.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't appear fuzzy. Look how nice it looks in riccard0's
    screenshot! So clear.\r\n\r\nIt was so very evil of you to link to a thread illustrating
    my apparent rudeness. If you were so polite, why did you do it? How beautiful.
    It is so intriguing when these things happen.\r\n\r\nThank you so much!\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Thanks,
    Riccardo, but I already located a higher-res version of the book interior (see
    ID above):</blockquote>\r\n\r\nNo, you haven't. Where is it?"

  body: "Sylph, Riccardo's screen shot is still very low-res and full of halo artifacts\u2014not
    sufficient resolution to successfully run through visual recognition software.
    I sought out another reference sample of the book, and ran that to get a match.\r\n\r\nJust
    compare it to my screen caps of Formata to see the difference.\r\n\r\nAnd, no,
    I'm not projecting anything. Your written communication could stand to be less
    terse\u2014I'm not the only person who finds it rude.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
