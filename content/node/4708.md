body: 'Just wondering what the conventions are for date formatting ie. separators,
  and text within brackets. <BR> <BR>For dates which is the conventional way to format
  a date? <BR> <BR>11/05/04, or 11.05.04. If the former is correct, is the latter
  acceptable? <BR> <BR>For brackets my question is in regard to capital letter usage.
  <BR> <BR>Example 1: <BR>&#34;Please forward the information to me by mail &#40;please
  tick&#41;.&#34; <BR> <BR>Should it be &#40;Please tick&#41;? I think the correct
  way is lower case, but I just want to be sure. <BR> <BR>Example 2: <BR>&#34;&#40;One
  complimentary ticket is included upon entry&#41;&#34;. <BR> <BR>I think the correct
  way here is uppercase, again not 100% sure. <BR> <BR>If it&#39;s how I think it
  is, you should only use uppercase for text inside brackets when the information
  within the brackets is a new sentance.'

  body: 'Dates: slashes are used more in the US and UK, periods used more in continental
    Europe &#40;in my experience&#41;. Both are acceptable. You&#39;ve got to watch
    the order though -- US is MM/DD/YY, UK/Europe is DD/MM/YY. More people these days
    are using YYYY at the end because of the awkward zero. <BR> <BR>Brackets: always
    lowercase. New sentences should NOT start within brackets. Parentheses are always
    contained withing a parent sentence. The only exception is if you&#39;re quoting,
    where the speaker is beginning a new sentence &#40;which will obviously be preceded
    by an open quote within the open bracket&#41;. <BR> <BR>R'

  body: 'Re brackets. This is a grammar issue not a typographical one. <BR> <BR>Pace
    Robert Johnston, there is no rule that parens may not contain a whole sentence,
    or for that matter a whole paragraph. The only rule is: if the parens contain
    a full and separate sentence, then they enclose the concluding full stop. &#40;I
    could, if you like, give an example.&#41; If the sentence is not complete, the
    punctuation falls outside the parens &#40;like this&#41;. That remains true even
    if the matter in parenthesis could have been a complete sentence if one chose
    to make it so. <BR> <BR>To this there is one exception: if the brackets contain
    a question or an explanation &#40;do they ever? yes!&#41; then the concluding
    stop falls inside the brackets, even when the sentence in which they are embedded
    remains to be concluded.'

  body: 'My bad, Paul. I&#39;m being overprescriptive and confusing grammar with style.
    <BR> <BR>I should clarify that, while all that you say is right on the button,
    stylistically entire sentences within brackets are to be avoided.  <BR> <BR>Consider:
    <BR> <BR>Nine cases have been identified. &#40;Six were fatal overdoses and three
    were non-fatal overdoses.&#41; <BR> <BR>vs. <BR> <BR>Nine cases have been identified.
    Six were fatal overdoses and three were non-fatal overdoses. <BR> <BR>vs. <BR>
    <BR>Nine cases have been identified &#40;six fatal overdoses and three non-fatal
    overdoses&#41;. <BR> <BR>As far as I&#39;ve been taught, the first one is, as
    you say, grammatically unassailable -- but stylistically wack. It&#39;s effectively
    kind of a tautology to use both brackets and a new sentence. There are, I imagine,
    instances when it&#39;s necessary, but on the whole the less punctuation you can
    get away with the better. <BR> <BR>You&#39;re right on the rules -- I&#39;m right
    on the style. I think. <BR> <BR>R'

  body: I guess as with any point of style there are occasions which justify a departure
    from the norm, but generally speaking I agree.
