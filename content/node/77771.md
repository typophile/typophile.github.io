    [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontdiner/singlesville-script/|Singlesville Script]]
    is fairly close although it doesn't have the loop on o. [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/suitcase/bistro-script/|Bistro
    Script]] and [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/charlesborges/bounce-script/|Bounce
    Script]] have a similar feel in the brush strokes but are a lot more open.
