  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I&rsquo;m feeling a bit stupid but I can&rsquo;t seem to find a version of Scala that contains a true expert collection with which I can make fractions. There seems to be a limited set (1/2, 1/4, 3/4) but not the full set of uppers and lowers. I don&rsquo;t really feel like buying the Open Type collection since I already have Scala. Am I nuts? I looked at Fontshop and myfonts and couldn&rsquo;t find what I want. This will affect whether I use this font for a job.</p>
<p>Seems like a huge oversight.</p>
<p>I am working on a book about the 30s &amp; 40s and originally thought to use either Electra or Joanna, but Joanna&rsquo;s italics are gnarly and neither has an expert set. Scala seemed like a reasonable update of Joanna until I ran into the fraction problem. I&rsquo;d welcome any other suggestions you folks might have for a similar text face that would be appropriate for this era, and has the requisite expert set. Dante?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>That is pretty, thanks for the suggestion. Same problem as Scala or Electra tho with the fractions, as William noted.</p>
<p>I just learned Dwiggins had designed Electra, which I guess I should have known. Right now I&rsquo;m inclined to stick with Electra (which I already own) since I have already invested in a display font for this project. While Electra doesn&rsquo;t have fractions either it does have ligatures, sc, lf/osf, all that stuff.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I know that Stephen and I don&rsquo;t always need them, but in this case I&rsquo;ll be dealing with fractions down to 1/8 so it&rsquo;s kinda important. A lot of fonts don&rsquo;t have the full uppers and lowers but at least have a broader selection of fractions. I&rsquo;m used to the old school where H is 1/2, G is 1/4, I is 3/4, J is 1/8 etc, as in Bembo, Adobe Garamond, Centaur etc. I do think that a comprehensive text face should have at least that.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve mentioned before I work mostly on art books and cookbooks where fractions are really necessary.</p>
<p>Chaparral is nice but no go with the fractions either&hellip; Still leaning towards Electra and creating fractions using style sheets but that is a pain. But at least Electra has LF which make much cleaner fractions than osf.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">You could construct the fractions from the Scala Caps font.
(Advice based on a perusal on my 1990 copy of Scala, which doesn&rsquo;t even have the limited set of three composite fractions; the caps font has no fraction slash, but its basic slash goes below the baseline, so could be used.
Another alternative would be to use Scala with the fractions from a different typeface.</div>

My understanding is that Quark is working on an opentype savvy version but it is not yet ready for primetime. Opentype will certainly make your life easier since you tend to do books needing the full range of typgraphic features. Quark 6 does not do it though.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;ll just second the idea of Dante. A wonderful roman <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and<!-- raw HTML omitted --> italic [it felt very weird here to italicise the &ldquo;and&rdquo; and not the &ldquo;italic&rdquo;!] that I have used with pleasure for past books.</p>
<p>Patty, this may be a completely crazy workaround to propose, but what if you have a small, second doc that remains open, parked on the pasteboard near your cookbook, and in it you have made all your needed fractions from boldface lining figures, reduced to the correct size, proper baseline shifts, your more leaning-over solidus between the two numerals, and a customized amount of tracking between all three elements. Then whenever you need, say &ldquo;1/4 t.&rdquo; you just go over, highlight and copy, then paste into the main document, and go on with what you were doing. Is that too fussy? That way you could use Electra or Dante or whatever you want, and you&rsquo;d end up with fractions that have the numeral size/spacing/color that you most desire. (I find sometimes that the pre-made fractions and nut fractions are not as handsome or readable as ones I can make myself, just as the bullets that ship with many traditional text fonts are about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->twice<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as big as I want them to be, forcing me to reduce point size and do a baseline shift in order to use them. Grrrrr.)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still using Quark 6.5 as my main app, but already own InDesign CS2 and expect to teach myself that rather than moving up to Q7 if I can avoid buying it.</p>
