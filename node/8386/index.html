I didn't check anything else about the site at the time I posted that response. (Baskerville doesn't have to be a commercial font, just like Caslon and Garamond are open for digitization by anyone. Of course if it's a copy of another foundry's rendition of Baskerville, that's a no-no.) <BR> <BR>Most of us here know which fonts are commercial ones that have no business being on a site for free downloads.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Guys, <BR> <BR>Came across this thread after being contacted by Mike Yanega. <BR> <BR>We just added a large batch of what were thought to be all 'in the clear' fonts to Flyerstarter.  <BR> <BR>We have responded to a couple emails from font authors requesting font removals and have fulfilled their wishes immediately.  It was not known that there was a larger volume of fonts that may be commercial. <BR> <BR>As an earlier poster stated, many fonts can be copyrighted but freely distributed, etc. You can appreciate the volume of work necessary to proof thousands of fonts if you are not a full-time Typophile who automatically knows the blatantly commerical fonts.  <BR> <BR>As I responded to Mr. Yanega, we will remove any fonts that someone points out as being commercial or copyright-ambiguous right away. It is of course not in our best interests to host these fonts.  <BR> <BR>We are not a .ru hacker site interested in sporting illicit fonts; our main business is consigning digital art for sale from independent designers, for which we respect and rely on intellectual property laws. <BR> <BR>I, personally, ask that you not inflame any foundries by notifying them of their fonts on Flyerstarter, but would rather ask you to spend the time instead writing me with the fonts that should not be on there - they will be taken down right away. <BR> <BR>Cheers and Happy New Year, <BR>Keith Tuomi <BR><a href="http://www.flyerstarter.com" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.flyerstarter.com">www.flyerstarter.com</a></a></div>

I for one, will try to spend some time looking for 'fonts that shouldn't be there', but you can also eliminate Image Club by searching for 'ICG' in the name; and Bitstream by searching on 'BT'.  <BR> <BR>I can understand how you might have unintentionally gotten in this situation by taking large dumps from 'donors', but you can now see how risky that is, since there are many ways fonts become illegally distributed. I accept that you do not want to contribute to the problem of font piracy, and say thanks for cooperating.</div>
