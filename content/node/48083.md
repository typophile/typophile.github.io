    driven to by that... After all type design has it's good point too. ;-)

  body: "Yeah, this doesn't sound at all to me like a convincing reason :(\r\nAfter
    all, if you don't want to work in the ad world, you could be a politician, a plumber,
    or a pilot? Why \u2013 of all possible careers \u2013 type?\r\n\r\nI love working
    in type because, well, I love type. I love the history, the mechanics, and I love
    the environments in which it is used. I'll even look at *evil* ads if they use
    good type or a new face well. I also love the people in the type community, and
    respect so much of their work. Also, I love to read; I read everything. During
    Michael Twyman's lectures earlier this year in Reading, he used to yell at me
    for trying to read everything in the ephemera samplse on the table instead of
    looking at them properly. Even if I didn't work in type, I'd still look at letters
    and old books all day, trying to doodle their forms properly in a notebook\u2026"
