  body: Maybe I&#39;ll beat Yves to it, but you need to understand that we do not
    help to find free downloads of commercial fonts. That practice deprives the people
    who design and produce these fonts from being able to earn a living from their
    work.  <BR> <BR>Please buy &#40;license&#41; the fonts you want to use.
