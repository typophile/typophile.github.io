  body: "I am sure its a nice book. <em>( <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/18762\"
    target=\"_blank\">There even was a thread about it, on Typophile, recently, including
    that link.</a> :)</em> But, If you are really interested in the book, its new
    and readily available from the publishing house itself, for only 49,80 Euro <em>(
    Approx. 61.45 USD, according to xe.com )</em>, so why should someone pay even
    more on eBay?\r\n\r\n<em> > <a href=\"http://www.typography.de/verlagsverzeichnis/typografie/696-7.html\"
