  and hopefully a few other members. My interest in typography goes back a number
  of years. However, more recently I have spent less and less time engaged in type
  design, and would like that to change! This first entry is basically a big HELLO
  to all existing members of Typophile.\r\n\r\nAll the best, CR41."
