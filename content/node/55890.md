body: "This is a request for help or advise in designing a masthead and/or layout
  for a newsletter. It will be circulate to the staff at an overnight shelter for
  adults who are homeless. I will lay out the goals and values, and what I have so
  far.\r\n\r\nThank you to any who assist with this.\r\n\r\n************************\r\nI
  was recently hired to supervise the staff at an overnight shelter for adults who
  are homeless. The shelter has been in existence for many years, but under different
  management. Our agency took over management of the shelter at the request of the
  agency that had been running it. We have hired all new staff and began three weeks
  ago.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOALS\r\nTraining/developing the staff is one of my primary responsibilities.
  Part of that includes writing an internal newsletter. The goals of the newsletter
  are:\r\n\r\n1. Develop overall teamwork and unity. We have a staff of 25 people.
  Three weeks ago, none of these people had ever met. None of them had ever worked
  in this shelter before. \r\n\r\n2. Develop teamwork/unity across shift and gender
  dividers. We have a men's and women's side to the shelter. However, other than brief
  interactions, the men and women working in the shelter do not work together. It
  will be a constant struggle to not allow the staff to develop into two separate
  staffs \u2014 a women's staff and a men's staff.\r\n\tAdditionally, the evening
  and graveyard shift have only a 30 minute overlap, and have very different responsibilities.
  The weekday and weekend shifts do not meet at all. Because of budget limitations,
  it is doubtful we will get them together other than brief periods during training
  events. Once we are past the first couple of months, it is likely that we will never
  again have everybody together in one room.\r\n\r\n3. Build a spirit of professional
  service. Most of our staff are not used to thinking of themselves as \"professionals.\"
  I want them to realize, and remember they now are social-services professionals.
  This affects their attitude towards their work, their guests, and each other.\r\n\r\n4.
  Provide training through a series of articles we can read and discuss. My time is
  flexible, so I intend to focus on the transition times when two shifts will be together.
  We can talk then, and I can follow that up with individual training with people
  during the course of their shift. The newsletter will let me address issues such
  as: How to keep guest from playing staff against each other, how to recognize drug
  usage, how to de-escalate a hostile situation, identifying and working with various
  mental disorders, etc.\r\n\r\n5. Keep staff members informed about what is happening
  in the shelter, as well as what is happening in the rest of the agency.\r\n\r\n6.
  Help people connect in relationships with other staff members and enjoy working
  together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNAME\r\nTacoma Avenue Shelter\r\nTAS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVALUES\r\nThe
  Agency Core Values are:\r\nCompassion\r\nDiversity\r\nExcellence\r\nJustice\r\nStewardship\r\n\r\nMission
  and Vision Statement excerpts:\r\nloving and compassionate service\r\ndignity of
  the human person\r\nserve and support poor and vulnerable people\r\nprovision of
  quality, integrated services and housing\r\n\r\nAnd, we are serious about these
  values and mission statements. They are real, and being lived out by our staff.\r\n\r\nWe
  have housed over 140 men and 40 women on any given night. We aim to provide a safe
  and relaxing place where everyone is welcome, and anyone can get a good nights sleep.
  However we do not want to simply be a place to sleep. We are also working to identify
  those who want to change their situation, and help them connect with the other community
  resources to reach their goals. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOFTWARE\r\nI will be working in
  Adobe InDesign CS2. This is my own personal software. The rest of the agency uses
  Word. As a Wordperfect/InDesign user, I installed OpenOffice on my own computer
  to be compatible. But the newsletter is my design, and will be done entirely in
  InDesign CS2.\r\n\r\nI have a limited selection of typefaces, and am planning on
  a combo of Adobe Caslon Pro (10.5/13 or 11/13), and Cronos Pro. I recently reversed
  my usual selection, and used the Cronos as the body text, and Caslon for titles,
  and the response was favorable, especially with younger individuals in the same
  age span as most of the intended recipients for this newsletter. The response from
  people was also consistent with the feel I wanted to develop. I want it to be professional,
  yet friendly and informal, with an attitude of excellent service to others. I also
  want something that is not trendy. Unfortunately, my feel for typefaces is not well
  developed at this time.\r\n\r\nI have also used Zapf Chancery Med Italic for drop
  caps etc. I picked Caslon and Cronos because I have used them together before, and
  people responded to the selection. When I laid out a couple of documents in different
  typefaces, most people picked the sample with these two. I don't use bootleg typefaces.
  Additionally, the variety of weights in these two typefaces allows me to find a
  weight that will reproduce well on a copier.\r\n\r\nHowever I am open to suggestions
  based on typefaces that I have (standard sets included with InDesign CS2, WordPerfect
  and a few exceptions. But no bootleg typefaces.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIENCE\r\nI
  started years ago with Pagemaker, after I found brand new copy at a local thrift
  store. I upgraded from Pagemaker to CS2 and love it. I also pastor a small church,
  which combined with the long hours I am putting in to get the shelter started, means
  I have little time to experiment with different designs.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, experimentation
  is the only way I can develop something. It usually takes me a year, and many iterations
  before I reach a design I like, and that works. I have reached the point where I
  can do this faster for text layout etc, but am new to masthead design, and have
  only done a couple of newsletter layouts. Most of my work has been in developing
  teaching/training materials in the church, where we use smaller formats that will
  fit into a book or program. \r\n\r\nI started by using the name and initials of
  the shelter in various combinations. I then played with them, looking at other logos
  and mastheads and trying to copy different techniques. Unfortunately I have had
  only a little time, and haven't found anything that looked good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUDIENCE\r\nMost
  of the staff are 22-35, with another group in their 40s. Half are men, half are
  women. Education ranges from one or two years of college to Bachelors degrees. For
  the most part, they are not used to thinking of themselves as professionals. They
  are caring people who want to make a difference in the world by serving others.
  They need training and direction, but are excited about the changes they have already
  made at the shelter, and are beginning to see just how much they can do as a team.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENT
  (not in order of significance or frequency)\r\nNews articles or updates on what
  is happening at the shelter.\r\nNews articles or updates on what is happening in
  the rest of the agency.\r\nTraining articles.\r\nPossibly a classified section for
  staff members to post notices.\r\nNew policy articles \u2014 We are developing some
  policies as we go.\r\nIdeas and questions for staff to discuss amongst themselves
  and then make recommendations.\r\nDescriptions or stories about different staff
  members.\r\nDescriptions of upcoming workshops or other training opportunities.
  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORMAT\r\nI am looking at a 8.5x11 format and considering an 11x17
  format folded with a letter-sized page in the middle. Page count will vary between
  2-6. The letter-sized format will be used when there are fewer pages. The tabloid-sized
  layout will be used when there are more pages. At this point I am still feeling
  my way along for how many pages we will consistently have.\r\n\r\nIt will be black
  and white only, and needs to be clear and legible when output ranges from 300 to
  1200 dpi lasers. It also needs to remain clean and legible when printed out on a
  copier. And, it should look good in a pdf that is emailed.\r\n\r\nThere will be
  occasional diagrams, charts and illustrations.\r\n\r\nI have used and like grids
  that give me the flexibility to vary column numbers and width to fit the contents,
  and use pull quotes or sidebars. I am looking for something that is consistent,
  but flexible.\r\n\r\n\r\nBetween the long hours of getting the shelter up and running,
  and also pastoring a small church, I am afraid I do not have the flexibility to
  spend a couple of weeks playing with different designs until I find something that
  works. And unfortunately, at my present skill level, that's what it takes me \u2014
  a *lot* of time. I eventually recognize what works, but take forever to come up
  with it on my own.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate any suggestions, design ideas or even
  completed designs for masthead or newsletter layout.\r\n\r\nAnd, the guests we serve
  will appreciate the improved service that comes from a well trained and unified
  staff.\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\nChuck Taylor"

  body: "> why not hire a graphic designer to do it?\r\n\r\nBecause non-profit funding
    is rapidly disappearing. \r\n\r\nAlso, the previous management let things run
    down, and we started out having to buy all new mattresses, sheets, blankets (plus
    donations), repair the building, hire staff before shelter-specific funding was
    available...\r\n\r\nBefore we came, the old mattresses had holes where springs
    protruded, there weren't any sheets on the men's side (and only one sheet per
    guest on the women's side), and only a few blankets.\r\n\r\nWe do not have access
    to the donor list for the previous shelter, so we have to raise all new donors.
    About the only pieces of equipment we inherited are a bunch of metal-frame bunks
    and mattresses we promptly threw out. We need(ed) computers, surveillance cameras,
    TVs, microwaves, soap dispensers, repaired showers, toilet paper dispensers, mops,
    brooms, first aid kits, desks, chairs, tables, shower mats, telephones, filing
    cabinets, locks, lockers for guests, lighting, towels, washcloths, hand sanitizer
    dispensers, copy machine, printers...\r\n\r\nAt this point, a professionally-designed
    newsletter for in-house use is not high on the priority list for funding.\r\n\r\n:-(\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nChuck"
