<p>I had a question that has been bothering me for a good long while.</p>
<p>Have any of you ever encountered a typeface in a film or other work that did not belong in the setting&rsquo;s time period? Especially if it just wasn&rsquo;t invented during the era in the film?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>When Trajan is used on a poster I think you can almost guarantee it&rsquo;s contextually wrong. As I said in an other thread, don&rsquo;t put a glyphic roman typeface on a movie about Egyptian mummies (The Mummy) or on a movie about a 1912 British ship (Titanic).</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really agree with Mark Simonson when he says the title on a movie poster doesn&rsquo;t have to be contextual. Indeed the rules are not as strict as on in-movie typography, but selecting a glyphic roman typeface to represent everything surrounding the RMS Titanic is just ignorant. Other than that, I greatly enjoyed the blog posts.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think Mark Simonson is right. Text on a movie poster, and on the opening titles and closing credits of a movie, should be appropriate aesthetically, emotionally, and evocatively to the content of the movie. But there is no question of anachronism involved, unlike the case of typography on props within the movie.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t a question of the same rule applying, only less strictly. The rule against anachronism does not apply <em>at all</em>, but an entirely different rule applies, although that rule <em>may</em> be best satisfied by a typeface which was available during the period of the events in the movie, since by being associated with the time, it might also be evocative and suggestive of the movie content.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>^ That&rsquo;s an interesting point. In The Artist, for example, it&rsquo;s clear that the typeface used for the opening credits, I think, are supposed to be evocative of the era, but not a perfect representation of that time period.</p>
<p>However, after reading Simonson&rsquo;s article and some of his list, I was struck by how much other glaring anachronistic and misused type was present in The Artist! For such a high profile, critically acclaimed film, I honestly expected more. I don&rsquo;t think the surprised expression has left my brow yet.</p>
<p>I simply do not understand why one would not enlist the help of a professional typographer to make things accurate. Even without, google is more than helpful when it comes to choosing a proper typeface. Just as they research costumes and the like, so, too, should they research typefaces.</p>
<p>But I guess google searches (like dystopias and accurate science) are too hard for some movie-makers to accomplish. Too harsh?</p>

		<div class="commentbody">In my view a font should evoke the style of a period, but I have no problem with the use of appropriate fonts that were designed after the time period. For example, I&rsquo;m using a TV series rather than a movie here, but it&rsquo;s the first thing that comes to mind. In Downton Abby, the classy lettering is Bernhard Modern. Designed more than 20 years after the the series time period begins, it&rsquo;s an expression of the sophisticated tastes of Upstairs at Downton Abby in a way that speaks more clearly to modern viewers than alternative typefaces from the immediate pre Great War period, which might be distracting because they are generally unknown or seem quaint to the modern eye.
BTW Trajan is the Comic Sans of contemporary movies with a historical theme. Some imagination needed here!

<p>You seem to be insinuating this is objectively true. I can&rsquo;t completely agree with that. For some reason we became accustomed to the idea that in-movie typography needs to be contextual while the typography on the movie only needs to be aesthetically pleasing, but that&rsquo;s very different from arguing that this should be the case objectively. There is logic in placing the typography in the movie in the correct time and setting of the movie, but there is also logic in the design of movie posters. A movie poster is a visualization of a mood of the movie and needs to be rationally crafted to communicate exactly that. Arguably the Titanic poster does that, but it&rsquo;s not the most coherent in its message and this could easily be improved with better typography. The typography doesn&rsquo;t necessarily need to be contextually correct in regard to the movie, but it does need to be contextually correct in regard to the mood of the poster, which in turn has a strong relation with the movie. Because, if only aesthetics matter, why not use a magenta background for the poster? Because if magenta is not a prominent color in the movie, the poster doesn&rsquo;t have a clear relationship with the movie. Why would you expect such consistency in color, composition and theme, but not in typography?</p>
<p>John, I think in a roundabout way I said just about the same thing as you. I agree with your distinction, but in practice it will always bother me if it doesn&rsquo;t adhere to my logic. This is why I&rsquo;m not convinced it&rsquo;s an entirely objective matter.</p>

<p>Is that such a mistake though? Aren&rsquo;t typefaces like Caslon used because they read well, rather than being contextually correct to the subject matter? I don&rsquo;t think your analogy necessarily applies.</p>
<p><cite>I don&rsquo;t think that I have such a problem with using typefaces for their aesthetic appeal over historical perfection. It looks really lovely when it&rsquo;s done well.</cite></p>
<p>Definitely. I don&rsquo;t think there is anything necessarily wrong with it as long as it&rsquo;s a conscious choice and it&rsquo;s well done. In most cases things go wrong due to ignorance though. I think every movie should have a knowledgeable typographer in their team to make sure the typographic details make sense.</p>
<p><cite>But costumes, hairstyles, language, and many other things often aren&rsquo;t historically accurate in movies.</cite>
It seems you&rsquo;re using this argument to justify the contextual deviations. I know that costume designers and historians will get just as annoyed and passionate about that as we do about typography. The reason we usually don&rsquo;t notice other inaccuracies is because we&rsquo;re either ignorant on the subject or we&rsquo;re just not passionate about it. Only Neil deGrasse Tyson would have complained about the sky in Titanic being incorrect because he has the knowledge and the passion. Only we would point out all the typographic inaccuracies because we have the knowledge and the passion.</p>
<p><cite>The director is just trying to evoke a time in history, not necessarily be accurate in every detail.</cite></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a generalization. I think it&rsquo;s often the director&rsquo;s objective to do make it as accurate as possible. When someone in Lord of the Rings is wearing a watch, that&rsquo;s an overlooked mistake and it can&rsquo;t be justified by saying the director was just setting a mood so not all details need to be accurate. They do need to be.</p>

<p>Getting costumes historically absolutely correct or using correct fonts is pretty low on most directors list of priorities. But I agree there are occasional exceptions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When someone in Lord of the Rings is wearing a watch</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes but that&rsquo;s a huge error that any audience member might notice. Very different from subtle mistakes that only experts would notice.</p>
<p>Pick a movie you think is very accurate and Google &ldquo;bloopers&rdquo; for it.</p>
<p>I once heard Stanley Kubrick&rsquo;s producer say that directors try to avoid obvious errors, but errors that few will notice generally aren&rsquo;t a concern. Movies aren&rsquo;t reality, he said, but just a rough simulation of reality mixed with fiction.</p>

<p>I remember watching Roots years ago and a female slave had perfectly manicured nails.</p>
<p>I suspect that if we went back in a time machine we&rsquo;d be shocked at how bad many people looked through much of history — missing teeth, pock marks, etc.</p>

<p>In my opinion the topic of type in films is similar to the role of music and real history in &lsquo;historic&rsquo; in films. It should be correct enough that it doesn&rsquo;t jar the average non-specialist movie goer. But film makers are telling stories so a level of suspended belief should be expected and probably encouraged.</p>
<p>The opening battle scene in Gladiator was heavily criticised by historians because the Romans never threw their pilla as they advanced, and lost cohesion in the melee&hellip; but 98.5% of viewers neither knew or cared and probably weren&rsquo;t interested in being educated. In the same way, it probably wouldn&rsquo;t matter if they used Times New Roman for the title rather than Trajan or a custom imitation of some Roman text off a ruin. On the other hand it would probably jar an audience to see &lsquo;Gladiator&rsquo; written in the Star Wars font.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@Martin Silvertant:
<cite>You seem to be insinuating this is objectively true.</cite></p>
<p>Yes. I <em>was</em>.</p>
<p>When one is watching a movie, the ideal is that it should be as if one were viewing <em>the actual events depicted</em>, somehow recorded as they were happening in real life.</p>
<p>So an anachronistic typeface is a continuity failure. And, unlike expecting Hollywood actors to even have their heads shaved, let alone their teeth damaged (hey, but maybe someday we&rsquo;ll be able to do this with CGI), it seems an easily remedied one. I mean, they still will print fake newspapers on laser printers or whatever - setting up stereotype plates with resuscitated Linotype machines and Ludlow machines (doing Bodoni much of the time) is a <em>little</em> too much to expect.</p>
<p>Titles, credits, and even subtitles are the packaging on the box the movie proper came in. When you see a title, you know you&rsquo;re watching a movie - documentaries have titles too, but the title, credits, and subtitles of a documentary <em>aren&rsquo;t part of what&rsquo;s being documented</em>.</p>
<p>So while I&rsquo;m entirely OK with saying that those typefaces ought to &ldquo;belong&rdquo;, if they&rsquo;re anachronistic, we&rsquo;re not seeing something that&rsquo;s in any sense logically impossible. A bad choice of typeface is simply an aesthetic failure, not a failure of the movie to present to the eyes what it pretends to present to the eyes.</p>
<p>However, there is another half to your argument that <em>is</em> valid that I simply skipped over for reasons of space and simplicity in my original post.</p>
<p>People watch <em>stage plays</em> for enjoyment. Even when they&rsquo;re performed by <em>high school students</em>. Thus, while it is an ideal to present to the eyes the actual events a film depicts, it is not a logical requirement of a well-made film that production values be infinite so as to achieve absolute perfection.</p>
<p>Thus, while some fanatical Star Trek fans may disagree with me, one couldn&rsquo;t really expect them to have cloned William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, Nichelle Nichols, James Doohan, George Takei, Walter Koenig, Majel Barrett, Grace Lee Whitney, and any other actors who would have been required, some 20 years or so before making the current series of Star Trek prequels.</p>
<p>So I will agree that historically correct typefaces are not an absolute logical necessity for a successful film, if that was your point.</p>

<p>An example: The map in <em>Master and Commander: Far side of the world</em>. After a disastrous encounter, the Cap&rsquo;n is inspecting an engraved map for a safe haven. As is usual in those times, some details are so fine he needs a magnifiying glass to read the small print.

<p>That&rsquo;s a shame. The art department supplied an ink-jet map and the director didn&rsquo;t know the difference.</p>
<p>Unfortunately a lot of designers these days (especially younger ones) have little knowledge about older printing methods because there&rsquo;s little call for them these days. In fact younger designers seem to know less and less about printing in general since everything is moving to the web and digital media.</p>

(Noah, Darren Aronovsky) Or were they &ldquo;laughing and playing silly games&rdquo; instead of heeding God&rsquo;s call to send two pairs of each of their species to the Ark (not being kosher mammals, who would send seven)? (The Unicorn, Shel Silverstein)</p>
<p>Or perhaps because the dinosaurs were so dangerous, Noah just dropped them off at a remote island before proceeding to Mount Ararat&hellip; one that the Daily Planet helicopter would eventually visit?

<p>Stranger things have happened in movies&hellip;</p>
<p>In &ldquo;Braveheart&rdquo; men wore kilts which weren&rsquo;t worn until 4 centuries later.</p>
<p>In the WWII movie &ldquo;Saving Private Ryan&rdquo; there&rsquo;s a motorcycle not manufactured until 1963.</p>
<p>Westerns often show men&rsquo;s pants with belt loops, which didn&rsquo;t become common until years later (men wore suspenders).</p>
<p>Historical movies typically portray leading men &amp; women who look attractive by today&rsquo;s standards, not what was considered attractive back then (women were often considered attractive with no tan and overweight by today&rsquo;s standards, and men often had shaggy beards).</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s movies showing dinosaurs and cavemen together!</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen the latest Noah movie with Russell Crowe that&rsquo;s getting a lot of attention, but my pastor said he enjoyed it, although it took considerable liberties with the story. But that&rsquo;s true of many Hollywood movies. Those old Cecil B. DeMille movies of Bible stores took great liberties, but were crowd pleasers.</p>

<p>Since thousands of square miles were flooded, and communication methods were primitive, someone living in that area might indeed feel that whole world (from their perspective) was flooded.</p>
