  according to my account info,) student of graphic design, and discoverer of a previously
  unknown love... typography. I've spent the past week trying to find a good internet
  resource for typography, more specifically for a list or library of typefaces and
  their designers.  My aim is to become familiar with the classics, and then the designers
  of my favorite typefaces.  Any post with a link, a book suggestion, or a typographer
  that you know and a listing of fonts they created would be great!\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for your help.\r\n\r\nNewly discovered typophile,\r\nMichael"

    web -- Typophile. Take a look at the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/typowiki\">TypoWiki.</a>
    It contains a lot of useful information in regards to designers and their work,
    book and online resources, etc\u2026"

  body: "Welcome Michael.\r\n\r\nWell, first off I'd like to recommend Typophile's
    very own, ever expanding Typowiki as a resource: http://typophile.com/typowiki
    It's chocked full of useful information on everything type related and maintained
    by the very blood that fuels this forum, our avid Typhophiles.\r\n\r\nJames comes
    off a bit gruff, but he's right. If you have access to a library (hard to imagine,
    but possible) take advantage of it. There are many a resources on type there.
    Also consult your local book emporiums. There are many books on the history of
    typography, including font selections from the past up to the most contemporary.\r\n\r\nFinally,
    check out these online resources and foundries: www.Fontshop.com, www.Myfonts.com,
    www.Adobe.com/type, www.Veer.com and www.identifont.com\r\n\r\nKeep contributing
    to Typophile."

    amazing how many design books just... disappear... from libraries. Most the the
    libs here in Seattle SUCK when it comes to decent design books, let alone anything
    remotely related to type.\r\n\r\nEven our brand-new mega-bucks Central Library
    has a crap selection. Interlibrary loan has a crap selection. \r\n\r\nYour best
    bet is to go down to Half-Priced Books, a used book store near a University, online,
    then Barnes & Nobles/Borders/Amazon. In that order."

    is quite small, and DEFINITELY plagued with book disappearance, but I found a
    few books that had a start to what I'm looking for.  The websites that you've
    all offered have also been phenomenal so extra special thanks for those.\r\nLook
    forward to nerding it up with you guys soon!\r\n\r\nMichael"

    sold there.\r\nAn incredible lion's share of type fonts, especially from cool
    small boutique foundries from around the world, can all be sampled at myfonts.com.
    \r\nStorm Foundry in Prague is especially literate about type history and has
    contributed some stupendous historical revivals and re-thinking of old faces.\r\nBest
    young type designers: DSType and Joshua Darden.\r\nThe biggest single Renaissance
    in type design now is from Hispanic countries: Spain, Portugal especially, and
    all over South America. Most of them are carried on myfonts.com in the foundries
    index. Or just sample all the myfonts.com fonts under each type category, like
    \"Garalde\" or \"Traditional,\" and see the range of what is happening now. Create
    your own custom sample line for global display: when I'm there, I use the phrase
    \"23569MetOpera\" because right off it shows me oldstyle figure fonts and the
    cap M plus lower case e, r, and a, always important indicies of creativity."

    best book I know of on typography is <cite>Art of the Printed Book</cite> published
    by the Pierpont Morgan Library & David R. Godine. This is not a \"how to\" book;
    you will find no rules or easy formulas. And perhaps it is not a beginners book,
    you need an good eye to see through the fashion and technology of the various
    times to the typographic principles demonstrated. But if you continue with an
    interest in typography -- rather than an interest only in the current fashions
    -- I think you will find it valuable."
