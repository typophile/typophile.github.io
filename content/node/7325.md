body: Do you bother with &#39;alternate pages&#39; for the users who don&#39;t have
  Flash?  <BR> <BR>The new Flash MX has the ability to do flash detection but I don&#39;t
  see it being used in the typophile home page. Do any of you Flashers bother?  <BR>

  body: If you&#39;re target audience is graphic design geeks like us, then Flashturbate
    all you want.  <BR> <BR>Otherwise, you need to put it all in the context of your
    usergroup. Flash is rarely an improvement to the overall end-user experience when
    we&#39;re talking your average online consumer, or news site, etc. It can enhance
    the experience of certain types of sites...teen marketing, movie promos, etc.
    <BR> <BR>If you ask yourself the basic question &#39;WHY is a person coming to
    this site?&#39; it usually answers the Flash question. If that doesn&#39;t, then
    look at the accessibility issues &#40;for those with screen readers, PDAs, corporate
    networks that block flash, older browsers, and folks that just hate flash&#41;.
    Is the benefit of the flash outweigh the percentage of lost audiene? <BR> <BR>Like
    Helvetica, Flash is best when used in moderation, IMHO.

  body: 'i&#39;m building mostly 2 versions, because i mostly use xml for the content
    storage. that way it&#39;s quite &#34;easy&#34; to build a non-flash site that
    uses the same data base... and &#40;even more important&#41;: google will index
    the site contents &#40;yes, google does crawl flash content for some weeks now,
    but only uncompressed flash files! and normally everyone makes use of the compression
    export setting&#41;. all this only makes sense if you have content on your page
    of course <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"

  body: yeh that&#39;s what I figured. I can easliy make an animated gif that is similar
    as the flash image but less flashy and a bit bigger. then that will come up when
    there isn&#39;t flash or it is blocked. <BR> <BR>personally if they don&#39;t
    have broadband and they don&#39;t have flash then they aren&#39;t the customer...

  body: I hate flash pages and always use an alternate when I get a chance. They take
    forever to load and they usually don&#39;t provide any additional content.

  body: As for Flash detection, yes, you should always detect for it.  <BR>However,
    I&#39;d argue that the need is becoming less and less &#40;for  <BR>mainstream
    audiences&#41; to build both Flash and non-Flash  <BR>versions. <BR> <BR>I agree
    that Flash is still largely used incorrectly - which doesn&#39;t  <BR>make the
    use of Flash right or wrong. It just means you should <BR>use it for what it does
    best. <BR> <BR>Regarding screen readers and PDAs. This has opened up so  <BR>vastly
    in the last 2 versions of Flash &#40;roughly 2 years&#41; that Jakob  <BR>Nielsen,
    Flash&#39;s one-time nemesis, now fully endorses Flash,  <BR>provided it&#39;s
    built within standard usability guidelines. The list of <BR>improvements include
    standard interface elements &#40;widgets&#41; that <BR>behave like browser widgets
    - drop down menus, pull-downs,  <BR>tab-enabled forms, selectable text &#40;which
    means machine  <BR>readable text&#41;, etc, etc. <BR> <BR>When we recently redesigned
    the fStop home page, we left out  <BR>the Flash gimmicks and built in some smart
    tools that allow the  <BR>fStop admin people to quickly update the content without
    the  <BR>need to either know Flash or use a content-management system  <BR>&#40;CMS&#41;.
    &#40; <a href="http://www.fstopimages.com/" target="_blank">http://www.fstopimages.com/</a>
    &#41; <BR> <BR>When we designed our own site, we deliberately blurred the lines  <BR>between
    Flash content and HTML content so that users cannot  <BR>immediately tell what
    is Flash and what is not. This required  <BR>using a system font &#40;Arial&#41;
    for all body text in and out of Flash,  <BR>but it&#39;s a good compromise that
    provides a seamless look.

  body: Well I decided to detect flash from vers. &#60; 4.0.. if it&#39;s not there
    it goes to an alt page which I change the flash bit with an aminated .gif.  <BR>
    <BR>The Flash image is quicker than the .gif and smaller. <BR> <BR>And I&#39;m
    finding even older Macs that I expect to have no flash had Flash 6 installed so
    it&#39;s in most browsers.

    exists or not shouldn&#39;t be the deciding factor...it should be whether or not
    the end-user wants to use the technology. Borwser detection in all forms only
    detects hardware set up...not end-user preferences, which is what you really want.'

  body: yeah but most users who are designers don&#39;t change anything. If you look
    at most computers the UI is the default set up and colours. I&#39;ve had a 100%
    success on all testers and people who have been targeted so Flash was a success
    and most users don&#39;t even know it&#39;s being used just that it works. <BR>
    <BR>Vidoes and sound files I&#39;ll require Flash otherwise they can&#39;t hear
    or see the clips so tough.

  body: Sure, sure, it all depends on the audience. But once you get into broader
    concepts of usability and accessibility, it is important to differentiate between
    &#39;hardware detection&#39; and &#39;user preferences&#39;.

    product development... <BR> <BR>&#34;Sure, people say they want word processing,
    but what they  <BR>really need is for the app to change all their hyphens to  <BR>bullets
    and add indents whenever they hit return.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#40;I love dissing Office.
    And I love dissing font guys who pose as  <BR>usability pros.&#41;
