  body: "The original Image Club version of Eclat had an alternate face with this
    'r'. It also had a different 'f', 'g', 'k', 'y' and 'z', as well as alternate
    'W' and 'Y' characters. It's not apparent that the version sold at <a href=\"http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/searchresults.htm?st=10&part=IM012&pn=Eclat\">Fonts.com</a>
    still comes with the alternate face.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
