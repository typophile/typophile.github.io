body: "I like Didot and was hoping to have my web designer use it on my website.  My
  one hesitation is because it is such a high contrast font that it doesn't look as
  nice small as it does large.  I came across H&FJ Didot which has \"Optical Sizes'
  which is a concept I really like, but since I am not a graphic designer I don't
  know how big of a difference the \"Optical Sizes\" will really make on a website.
  \ I really only will need at max maybe 8 styles of Didot, but the H&FJ Didot only
  sells theirs in a package of 42 styles (because of the optimized fonts) so it is
  quite a bit pricier than other Didot fonts I have looked at (like Linotype Didot
  on myfonts.com)\r\nI really like Didot, but I know enough about graphic design to
  know I don't know graphic design and that is why I am asking to get a consensus
  of whether it is really worth it to invest the extra couple hundred of dollars to
  get the H&FJ Didot vs Linotype Didot?\r\n\r\nThank you for reading my question :)"

    use (although they say support is coming soon).\r\n\r\nI would consider other
    fonts. Using the advanced search on MyFonts, look for \"Didot\", or \"Didone\"
    or even \"Modern\" and use the additional search criteria \"web font support exists\".
    That should give you start."

  body: "H&FJ is clearly one of the best Didot designs available and I think it is
    worth the extra investment, for print.\r\n\r\nThe whole class is rather difficult
    for web because Didot is intended to be used with the thin horizontal strokes
    remaining for the most part consistent independent of size. This is to say, if
    one tunes their printing to the proper appearance of text as they like it, whatever
    the crossbar of the 10 point H looks like, from there to 100 point and beyond,
    the crossbar of the Didot H, (along with all the serifs, hairlines and etc.) are
    to maintain that apparent thickness. \r\n\r\nThere is a good reason why sans,
    and low contrast fonts in general, are so successful on the web. Despite its pixel-based
    nervous system, and even with the most elaborate size mastering, hinting, media
    queries and voodoo, it'd be hard to supply such an appearance consistently for
    a Didot on the whole web, though maybe one part of the web at a time is enough?
    \r\n\r\nIn the mean time, you might study the web type uses of notorious Didotphiles
    and see what they are doing instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    on screen.\r\nReally, the horizontal serifs need a pixel of its own.\r\nTherefore,
    you need a threshold of 28 pixels (according to WebInk\u2019s Bodoni page) to
    even get those serifs to show \uFB01rmly, and the effect is more like a slab serif
    than the delicate, high-contrast effect of H&F-J\u2019s Didot. "

  body: "How is that possible?\r\nSurely the hairline serifs need a pixel of their
    own, in which case the type ceases to be high contrast below a certain size, or
    else if the hairline is greyed, again, the high contrast effect is lost."

    that and answering the second part. \r\n\r\nI think, the answer for the web is
    \"none\" live, graphics probably work a little better. The reason is low resolution,
    minus hinting. In addition, lighter-than-normal asymmetric rendering by any OS
    would make the quality use of this whole class of types go ppppffffft on the web...\r\n\r\nIssues
    surrounding the CT Collection first raised this discussion, at which time Didot's
