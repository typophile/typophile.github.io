  a London-based designer, art director, and St. Martins School of Art grad, founded
  Club-21 in 1999. Earlier in his career, Morey did a prestigious stint at Peter Saville
  Associates, where he collaborated on designs for Factory Records, New Order, and
  The Ha\xE7ienda. Now an independent design consultant, Morey works with high-profile
  clients such as Arena, Asprey, Diesel, Environ Records, The Face,  Giorgio Armani,
  KesselsKrammer, and Vogue. His latest venture, a publishing company dubbed Editions
  Eklektic, serves as an outlet for personal expression in the form of silkscreen
  prints, greeting cards, and other media. Morey's ongoing interest in pop and urban
  cultures is evident in the Club-21 collection of stencils, dot and square matrix,
  modular, LCD, typewriter, signage, and mechanically produced fonts.\r\n\r\n<strong>External
