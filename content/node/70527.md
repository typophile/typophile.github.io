  Has anyone had better luck?\r\n\r\nD"

    with intergrated LivePen :)"

  body: "I think you nailed it twardoch. I (duh) forgot to scale properly before pasting.
    Scaling really make a big difference.\r\n\r\nUsually I'm not a huge fan of Illustrator's
    simplify tool but it worked well in this instance. It's good to actually know
    that the width tool outlines can be simplified.\r\n\r\nNot bad at all."

  body: "I've just tested it, and it works well. I mean, the shape in Illustrator
    after outlining the stroke (or choosing Object / Expand Appearance) already looks
    quite poorly, but FontLab Studio essentially gets 100% of what Illustrator has.
    I've just tried Illustrator's \"Simplify\" at 97% Curve precision after outlining
    the shape, and then FontLab's Optimize (with some conservative settings), and
    the results are quite nice. \r\n\r\nOf course, keep in mind that it's best to
    maintain 1:1 scale between Illustrator and FontLab Studio, so it's best to work
    in pt units in Illustrator, where 1 pt corresponds to 1 font unit in FLS. But
    this has always been true. \r\n\r\nOne important thing: since version CS4, Illustrator
    has the concept of Artboards, which FontLab Studio knows nothing of. To make FontLab
    Studio understand the placement of the objects, you need to choose View / Rulers
    / Change to Global Rulers before copy-pasting. \r\n\r\nI have just posted an updated

  body: Well, I've tested the Width Tool in Illustrator and I must say I find it atrocious.
    Maybe I'm stupid but I cannot figure out how to prevent Illustrator from putting
    the "first" and the "last" width control points on the "startpoint" of my closed
    outline (i.e. a circle). This is quite ridiculous :)
