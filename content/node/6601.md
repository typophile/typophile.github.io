    Orange Italic. A Typeface that has this &#34;luxury&#34; look &amp; feel, too.

  body: Lars, they are very full of themselves. I bet they go belly up pretty soon.
    In these economic times no client will pony-up that kind of money. The dot com
    times are over. They should do some marketing anaylsis of current typeface pricing
    and make an adjustment to the realities of now. Maybe you can negotiate with them,
    like if you use there type in headlines in a publication they get a credit in
    the cofolon

  body: 'I can&#39;t find the thread right now, but here is the story: Christian Schwartz
    and his colleague produced the Luxury Collection as a satire and joke on the fashion
    industry, and put the price accordingly, not expecting to sell. <BR> <BR>I think
    Schwartz&#39;s work on type is some of the best being done today, and none of
    the rest has this kind of pricing. If you want one of the &#39;luxury&#39; fonts
    or an alternative, I suggest e-mailing Christian Schwartz and asking him, and
    I expect you&#39;ll get a reasonable answer.'

  body: Joke or not, exclusivity of a high quality item can ask for exorbitant prices
    and expect to receive payment. Christian Schwartz does seem to have an impressive
    resume to back up actions that may seem eccentric. I suspect it will take an equally
    eccentric person to purchase such a font package and that even large corporations
    with the pocket change to do that have decision makers with more traditional views
    on spending. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m curious to know if anyone has purchased it yet.
    <BR> <BR>Also, I&#39;m sure if you looked hard enough you could find some resonably
    priced typefaces that are similar.

    <a href="http://www.orangeitalic.com/fonts/luxury.shtml" target="_blank">the answer
    is no</a>. <BR> <BR>They say they think this is because people think the fonts
    don&#39;t really exist. I&#39;d say that the pricing for licensing is just a tad
    out of reach of most clients. It&#39;s a great joke tho and even greater faces!
