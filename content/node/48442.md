  the year.\r\nWe are currently 13\" wide and moving to 11\"\r\nThe newspaper hasn't
  gone through a redesign in 20+ years, so we are going to redesign while going smaller.\r\nWe
  are attempting to find a good combination of fonts to use. We are currently strictly
  Times throughout the paper.\r\nIn our text we use 10 pt with 9.6 leading. We are
  aware this is way too tight. Is there a font that fits more characters on each line
  at a decent price? (We are a small family owned weekly)\r\nOr is there a way to
  manipulate Times so that it is still usable and we take our resources to purchase
  updated Headline/Section front fonts?\r\nDoes anyone have any suggestions on good
  combos of serif and sans serif fonts for headlines a small weekly paper on a budget?
  and also the good text font question.\r\nThanks!!!\r\nB Smith"

    on the right, 8.6/9.6.\r\n\r\nBeing slightly condensed and with a large x-height,
    Worldwide fits more text than Times at the same apparent size, justifies better,
    and no extender collisions. There are also headline versions. <a href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/brown.html\">Brown
    Gothic</a> is the matching sans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The Font Bureau specializes in helping newspaper clients with just this sort
    of thing. Although they sometimes engage in custom solutions, there are also a
    number of off-the-shelf options that they can provide.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontbureau.com/newspaper/fonts/\r\n\r\nI
    realize you're a small paper and on a budget, and the very idea of FB may sound
    too expensive (after all, they deal with all the \"Big Boys\"), but I'd suggest
    that you have someone at least give Harry Parker a call and find out what kind
    of ballpark you might be looking at for a FB fonts solution. At worst, you'd find
    that it's not in your budget. At best, you'd have an experienced partner to help
    you find a great, proven solution fast.\r\n\r\nI also realize that the powers-that-be
    have probably dumped all their available cash into the presses and hardware investments,
    and it's probably too late now, but there really should be some budgetary consideration
    for the ramifications of the narrower web on design and fonts. The narrower web
    isn't going to help cut costs so much if the paper just has to get longer to accommodate
    the old amount of text in Times; nor if the content ends up getting cut noticeably
    because the design can't adapt adequately to the narrower constraints; nor if
    the readership drops off because suddenly the whole thing looks and reads like
    a mess.\r\n\r\nIn the bigger picture, newspaper fonts are a long-term investment.
    The cost of high-quality, well-suited fonts to solve your not-insignificant challenge
    is a drop in the bucket compared to other upfront costs of the transition.\r\n\r\nI'm
    probably preaching to the choir. Good luck with your transition.\r\n\r\n-- Kent.\r\n\r\nP.S.
    Nick's Worldwide and Brown Gothic are also time-tested and excellent options. "

  body: "Brian, fitting more text in the same space (or the same text in a smaller
    space) isn't very hard - you just use a (well-made) font with a bigger x-height*
    and set it at a smaller size. The problem is that you are losing something: readability
    (just try setting a paragraph in Quadraat Headliner). And in fact Times (even
    though it's not a font I generally favor) is quite nicely balanced in terms of
    economy-vs-readability, at least in the point size range that it's comfortable
    with. The problem is: it's overused, it's bland, and has too much stroke contrast**,
    plus if you go smaller than 9 point it can't hold the text.\r\n\r\n* Narrower
    fonts don't necessarily help, and in fact can hurt.\r\nFrom my Daidala interview
    (http://daidala.com/25apr2004.html):\r\n\"The other thing to consider about width
    is economy. We might think that narrowness is economical \u2013 and that\u2019s
    obviously true at the level of single lines \u2013 but a paragraph is not a bunch
    of single lines, it\u2019s a series of lines; a wider font can be set smaller,
    maintaining apparent size, and gaining vertical space in a paragraph. Furthermore,
    a wide & small font is less susceptible to the \u201Cwasting\u201D effect of linebreaks:
    a narrow font that accumulates small amounts of gain per line can have all its
    savings trashed by a linebreak; while a smaller font will save space per line
    no matter the linebreaks. On the other hand, a wider font causes more hyphens
    (in inverse proportion to the column measure), reducing both readability and economy.
    So it depends on a number of factors; but it\u2019s important to remember that
    narrowness isn\u2019t necessarily more economical.\"\r\n\r\n** Which was fine
    in the era of massive ink gain, but no longer.\r\n\r\nIn choosing a font one big
    task is to decide on a suitable apparent size for your paper's text, based on
    various things, not least the average age of your readership. There's a limit
    to how much you can push the juggling act before everything falls to the ground;
    you can't have easy reading AND long articles AND low cost. Typically you can
    get to chose two of those three.\r\n\r\nI could keep writing, but allow me to
    cut to the chase: if FontBureau scares you :-) please do get in touch (hpapazian_at_gmail_dot_com)
    either to discuss the development/modification of a font, or for typographic consultation.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
