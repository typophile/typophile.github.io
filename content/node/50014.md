body: "I'm using Fontlab Studio, wanting to have a handful of glyphs in the edit layer,
  but picking the contours of a particular shape is tricky when they overlap at low
  zoom, and tricky when you can't see the whole contour at high zoom, so what I wanted
  was to change the colour of individual contours in the edit window so I know which
  one I'm picking up and moving...is this possible? The mask layer is just as confusing
  when there's more than one outline in it.\r\n\r\nFor example, when I have a 3 and
  a 5 overlaid on the edit layer, perhaps with other glyphs in the mask layer, can
  I change the 3 to blue outline and the 5 to pink outline so I can see the difference
  when I zoom into the bowl?\r\n\r\nDoes that make sense?!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "It makes sense but I don't think you can do it. You will usually be selecting
    whichever is on top by clicking. What I might try is moving the outline you don't
    want to change by 100 units using command/control arrow and then adjust the outline
    you want to edit. You can then move the other outline back 100 units by command
    arrow again. You can do this very quickly via keyboard.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Thanks, yes, I feared as much. It gets confusing when I have three glyphs
    in the same edit window together!\r\n\r\nI wonder if that will be possible in
    the future releases.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I dont understand why you want to have it like this, but what you could do
    is make Multiple Master font out this. In that case you case have similar behaviour
    with different layers.
