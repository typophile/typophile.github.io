body: "Custom Type for Eclipse, an educational/language software system.\r\n\r\nI
  tried to attach the image, but I kept getting a javascript error, so I've provided
  a link; [[https://forrst-production.s3.amazonaws.com/posts/snaps/116714/mega.png?1320189751|Design
  on Forrst]]\r\n\r\nWhat vibe do you get from this type treatment? The target market
  is incredibly broad, so I was after a minimal, screen ready approach.\r\n\r\n<strong>Note:</strong>
  This has nothing to do with the developer site <cite>eclipse.org</cite>"

  body: The rendering style of the mark is very early 80s-era. As such, it clashes
    with the type. The type, itself is fine, if not perhaps a bit bland for the software
    sector.

  body: Darrel, this is where you've been hiding? Still visit logopond? Fair call
    on the mark, it's only one option to be presented.
