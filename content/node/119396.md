  I wonder if somebody remembers what were the most popular fonts during the nineties
  and the nillies? I guess it was first Times New Roman, followed by Georgia and now
  sans-serif Calibri (but this might be too much inspired by the history of one company:
  Microsoft).\r\nDid someone found some literature about this subject?\r\n"
