  \r\nI havent had the chance to rework the body copy yet... but that will get done
  when i get the chance. Unfortunately we're only allowed to use one side of the flyer
  (even though I really like some of the suggestions to split the flyer over the two
  sides). Further comments and suggestions welcomed!\r\n\r\nP.S - I've noticed some
  of the sperm come out looking rather fuzzy, this is only because of the image compression
  ;-)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHello all,\r\n\r\nI was recently assigned a project in my second
  year Communication Design course and have come up with a decent concept but am looking
  for ways to improve either the design or type or both before handing in finals.
  Below I have included a quick backgrounder on the project and attached the PDF file.
  Thanks for taking the time to look at this everyone\u2026 I really appreciate it!\r\n\r\n<strong>Quick
  Backgrounder</strong>\r\nThis project will address the social impact of graphic
  design and allow you to explore print design as a vehicle of persuasion. You will
  research a social health or environmental issue and develop a strong point of view
  about it. Using words and images you will produce a provocative, visually dynamic
  and persuasive flyer aimed at a specific audience.\r\n\r\nThe topic I decided on
  was <strong>Teenage Pregnancy</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Goal:</strong>\r\nYour objective
  is to make the best use of the vehicle available to persuade the target audience
  to accept your point of view."

  body: "You have two strong messages in 20,000,000:1 and 1:3. However, 20 million
    to one is a difficult concept to produce as an image/and for your audience to
    appreciate, therefore I would look at a 1 in 3 concept. \r\nYour image needs to
    be absolutely clear how a condom works, any ambiguity could confuse, I know that
    most teenagers will know how they work but the ones that don't probably represent
    your chief target audience.\r\nWhat is the size of your flyer?\r\nTim\r\n\r\nPS
    can you close your strong tag"

    number. The three illustrated sperm don't say <strong>huge</strong> to me. \r\n\r\nAnd
    I agree with Tim that the illustrated condom isn't working the way a condom properly
    does.\r\n\r\nCheers, Ken"

  body: "I agree completely with the other two comments. Just multiplying the illustrated
    sperm would help, really...\r\n\r\nBut in addition to that, if you have time,
    I would reconsider the illustration style, especially the default illustrator
    brush outlines. The technique doesn't feel as serious as the problem you're trying
    to address. I know you're going for the teen audience and trying to be casual,
    but I would personally give it another iteration to really nail how menacing the
    sperm look. \r\n\r\n(Take this with a grain of salt, I'm only one year ahead of
    you in school!) Good luck!"

    your right and left" assumes that the viewer is among other people. It is kind
    of awkward.

  body: "Hello everyone, thanks for commenting so quickly! \r\n\r\n<strong>Brampitoyo:</strong>
    \r\nYeah you've got the idea, just an overall critique to do with anything...
    design, type, or communication of the message.\r\n\r\n<strong>timd  & KenBessie
    </strong> \r\nSorry my fault about the strong tags, didn't realize I had left
    one open. Should be fixed now :-) Hmmm I totally agree with your points about
    the image not working to its potential... perhaps by duplicating the sperm, making
    them smaller and more aggressive looking I could create that swarm effect I'm
    looking for. About the condom, I see what you mean it being rather ambiguous with
    the sword and all, but I was hoping to go for a more comical approach. But I think
    as you said it could have more of an impact if the condom was over the egg in
    some fashion protecting it. <strong>timd</strong>, when you talk about changing
    to the 1/3 concept, do you mean redoing the entire design or just choosing to
    use that as my main catch header? Oh and the flyers size is 8.5 x 14 an insert
    into a magazine with no diecuts or folds. \r\n\r\n<strong>mllecait</strong>\r\nHmm
    that\u2019s an idea, do you know of any good sources to get more illustrator bushes?
    Not sure what style I would go with, but it would be interesting to try out a
    few other looks\r\n\r\n<strong>seventy7</strong>\r\nYeah your totally right about
    this, my copy will change before the final. The main concepts that I wanted to
    get across are there in the text, but the copy needs a lot of tweaking and cleaning
    up.\r\n\r\nThanks once again to all who commented! You all had great suggestions
    and I think I have few more ideas to take this flyer to the next level.\r\n"

    suggest the 20 million to one message on the front ('cause its attention-getting),
    and the three to one message on the back ('cause it offers more information)."

  body: "Either you need to improve your current image or think it from another angle,
    my feelings are that you should think about the 3:1 as it speaks to your audience
    personally and that will require a redesign. However, if you want to stick with
    the 20 million headline your illustration should in some way represent that, you
    could represent that in the cartoon style or with an image like <a href=\"http://creative.gettyimages.com/source/classes/FrameSet.aspx?&UQR=ruiykd&pk=4&source=front&lightboxView=1&txtSearch=sperm&selImageType=7&chkLicensed=on&chkRoyaltyFree=on&chkNLM=on\">this</a>
    or a information graphic. The condom, because it doesn't, shouldn't be represented
    as protecting the egg, you could represent it as something catching/blocking the
    sperm. I'm not sure that a cartoon style works to portray a serious subject. As
    it is a magazine insert and less likely to be read by three people at once you
    might need to rewrite the body copy a little.\r\nTim"

  body: "I think the copy and concept aren't overly strong. It's like you've taken
    the statistics and tried to make them interesting with a coloured page ... it
    doesn't work like that. Think OUTSIDE the box - and page, and literal delivery
    of the concept.\r\n\r\nMore specifics: the condom 'defending' the egg doesn't
    really move us forward in terms of social/sexual equality, nor does it in my opinion
    reflect a strong or accurate message of where/why/how condoms should be used and
    viewed by teens. I also don't like the idea of swords anywhere near my sperm.
    Think about your audience.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n----------\r\n<strong>Paul

    side with a cloud of sperm swimming towards it. It could even be a photograph.
    This would be the \"20 Million\" side. On the back, an image of a condom in its
    wrapper with the sperm swimming away from it and the \"Choose Protection\" text.\r\n\r\n

    in this particular project we're only allowed to work with one side (although

    a few of the ideas brought up. I havent had the chance to redo the body copy...
    but let me assure you it will get done sometime this week ;-) The two new comps.

    you thought about the spermcells crashing into echother, like in a highway/autobahn
    accident ("chain collision", or whatever the name is) also, ik think the illustration
    style is a bit dull. how about dropping the outline? and since this is a typo
    forum, how about integrating the typo and illu more?'

  body: "Not sure if this has been said, but with the copy: I read \"20 million\"
    and then \"Sperm, Only one egg... Like the odds?\" Breaking it between the two
    is awkward and confusing -- I don't know how to read the sentence. I think \"sperm\"
    needs to be kept with 20 million for the message to get through first read. Also
    the capitalization indicates that \"Sperm\" is starting a new sentence or thought,
    as does Only, except it comes after a comma... and then the reader gets confused.
    \r\n\r\nTry \"20 million sperm. (Only one egg. Like the odds?)\"\r\nI think having
    the word sperm up there nice and big will grab way more attention.\r\n\r\nK."

    million sperm.\r\n1 egg.\r\nLike the odds?\r\n\r\nOn three separate lines. Use
    a nice condensed sans (that's still friendly enough, of course) and the retrofit
    each line, so \"1 egg\" would have a bigger size than \"20 million sperms\". The
    nice thing about this method is that it'll really highlight your main point.\r\n\r\nVisually,
    I like number 6 if you would further highlight the condom. I can't see the suggested
    \"tip\" very well. It's really clever, though!\r\n\r\nBest of luck!"
