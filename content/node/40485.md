body: I just had an extrodinarily pleasant conversation with Lida Lopes Cardozo. She
  was telling me about David Kindersley's spacing system. Even though she is sending
  me a book about it I thought that I would ask my fellow typophiles their experience
  with it & opinion of it might be.

  body: "I have read the most recent version of the book and there is a long thread
    on it [[http://www.typophile.com/node/19789|here]], during which after initially
    misunderstanding Kindersley's system I understood the basic idea of it. If you
    start reading at about May 9 2006 in the thread, when I started to get it right,
    that might be most helpful to you.\r\n\r\nThere are also links there to previous
    threads. I can tell you more by e-mail, if you are interested. "
