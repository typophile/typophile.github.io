    Alternatives</a> for just such an occasion. Let me know what you think.

  body: 'I guess it depends up the market. But, <a href="http://www.p22.com/ihof/frenzy.html">Frenzy
    Sans</a> and <a href="http://www.p22.com/ihof/peanut.html">Peanut Sans</a> both
    bare some similarity to Papyrus. '

  body: "I really like that Galahad font Tiffany. I must admit I'm a sucker for alternatives
    and the alternative ligatures in there are simply awesome; especially that double
    'g.' I do wish the edges weren't so rough though, but I suppose this IS a \"Papyrus
    Alternative\" thread.\r\n\r\n"

    I've been having difficulties getting it to work in Flash CS3.  It's free though.  Google
    it.

    need an explanation of why this font sucks.\r\n\r\nSorry I don't have any suggestions
    for alternatives. I try to stay as far away from Papyrus as possible."
