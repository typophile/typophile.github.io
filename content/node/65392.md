  body: This might be because you have conflicting postscript names. (See just below

  body: "Thanks frode frank!\r\n\r\nI checked under \"font info\":\r\n\r\nThin: I
    have PS font name like font_name-Thin.\r\nOmbra: I have PS font name like font_name-Ombra.\r\n\r\nIs
    it possible that the problem dipends by the fact that I create Ombra case by Thin
    case???\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\nS"
