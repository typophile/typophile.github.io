    modified:\r\n\r\nhttp://landor.com/#!/work/case-studies/council-on-foreign-relations/\r\n\r\nFutura
    (designed in 1927) comes very close, save for the angle of the stroke terminals
    on the C.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a companion CRF monogram that appears to be based
    on Bernhard Script and/or Baskerville."

  body: '[[http://www.dutchtypelibrary.nl/Nobel_rdrct.html|Dutch Type Library''s version]]
    of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_(typeface)|Nobel]] looks close. I would
    say the [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Nobel/|Font Bureau version]] but the
    N is different. Nobel was released in 1929, just two years after Futura.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/council_4631.jpg]'

  body: "Nobel works for me, Rob, when it comes to the crossbar of the G and other
    details. \r\n\r\nThey appear to have rounded the C, O and G to be closer to perfectly
    circular--more like those same letters in Futura. Landor did say it was customized...."

  body: "Thank you, gentlemen. Considering it could be based on Nobel, then it seems
    they also modified the \"N\", which looks close to Futura.\r\n\r\nWhat is your
    opinion on modifying a font this way, with elements that are clearly typical from
    another font? Personally, I do like the overall result. But for a true typophile,
    wouldn't this approach lack consistency?"

  body: "I agree that the overall result is quite pleasing. As long as it holds together
    visually, I don't mind the Dr. Frankenstein approach--provided the stitches and
    bolts aren't visible.\r\n\r\nToo many times I've tried to help someone ID a logo
    typeface on this forum, and they've expressed disappointment that it wasn't a
    readily available typeface without alterations. Landor always does very subtle
    work (some may call it boring), but making the complex look simple and effortless
    is a real talent.\r\n\r\nBetter than the alternative: http://cuttingedgelogos.tumblr.com/"
