  never intended to do a sans at all.\r\n.\r\nThe story was this: Some years ago I
  teached lettering at HGB Leipzig academy. For writing exercises I needed a specimen
  of the classical Roman Capitalis. Since I didn\u2019t \uFB01nd exactly what I was
  looking for in any book I compiled something myself in Illustrator: 1-inch-height
  skeleton glyphs on the background of a 4-by-4-square grid. It looked nice. And the
  <cite>Kontur-Nachzeichnen</cite>-command is one little step only \u2013 to get an
  outline glyph \u2026  So \u2018why not do this as a font\u2019 became a tempting
  thought. But it was capitals only and I was not in any mood of doing lowercase.
  \r\nThan, it might be four years ago, it happened that a gimmick set of simple demo
  fonts were to file in order to promote the big Eszett newbee a little bit. I recalled
  my Roman skeleton exercise and found it a nice match to utilize an unused capitals-only
  stock for this [[http://www.signographie.de/cms/front_content.php?idart=248|capital-promo
  issue]]. It became a font named Linea which is still available for free (but not
  very useful). \r\n\r\nHowever, since then someone invisible persistently whispered
  \u201Cmache die Schrift!\u201D in my ears. But I still hesitated for a long while
  since I was uncertain about what should decently accompany the capitals on the lc
  positions. When I \uFB01nally started the actual work the idea was to place a kind
  of uncial glyphs there, to try something new. But my energy to spend on it didn\u2019t
  last very long \u2026\r\nAfter more than a year I reconsidered the project, now
  thinking about doing small capitals. It was still a quite \u2018capitalish\u2019
  matter in my eyes. But then I looked aside on the [[http://www.signographie.de/cms/front_content.php?idcat=145|Andron
  project]]. As one of many aspects of that typeface I developed what I call the \u201Ctricameral
  alphabet model\u201D some years ago. This is a typographic system consisting of
  \u201Cthree houses\u201D: uppercase, lowercase and <strong>middlecase</strong> letters.
  And I thought: yes, the <cite>three</cite> of it \u2013 that\u2019s it!\r\n\r\nBy
  the way, I don\u2019t see any \u2018Lapidaria Italic\u2019 up to now. For me this
  is not really belonging to the nature of that kind of typeface. But anyway, it ought
  to become a proper family. The modest set of three weights realized is what may
  be the most useful, I think. \r\nUntil outstanding sales ;-) force me to do so I\u2019ll
  never add a fattish Bold because I don\u2019t like fat type very much. But possibly
  an additional Medium (between Regular and Semibold) and also a Thin (below the Light)
  may be an option some day.\r\nHowever, another option does appeal to me much more:
  making <cite>ornated</cite> versions. Because the face is soo ornamentish \u2026
  ;-)\r\nWhy not. A swashy variant has already been recently dicussed [[http://typophile.com/node/69691|in
  this thread]]. Could be funny! The other idea is to make ornated initials, in a
  rather smart and crisp fashion, perhaps. Sketches already exist \u2026\r\n\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/andreas-stotzner/lapidaria/|\u2013>
