body: "I was recently hired by the American Lung Association of New England to overhaul
  the website for their great new campaign, Own Your Air. Despite being about two
  weeks old, the existing website (as of the time of this post) is quite dated, and
  lucky for me, ALA is unhappy with the results. The firm who designed the current
  site also did the identity (which will also be getting an overhaul), and used Helvetica
  (Swiss, actually) Black for the logo.\r\n\r\nI don't believe Helvetica Black is
  an appropriate style face for a campaign about air quality (well, more than just
  that, but that's the gist). To me, there's nothing <cite>air-like</cite> about Helvetica
  Black whatsoever. It's corporate, cold, bulky, blocky, and other objectionable adjectives
  from the beginning of the alphabet. The target audience is ages 25 to 45. I'm somewhere
  in the middle of this range, and I find its appearance absolutely unappealing. ALA
  wants cutting-edge, fresh, but the project managers (10+ years older than me) aren't
  interested in any of the contemporary typefaces I have proposed.\r\n\r\nThe original
  (Helvetica/Swiss Black):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture-3_3925.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrent
  proposal (Sauna Bold):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture-4_4172.png]\r\n\r\nAs
  appropriate as I feel the example above may be for this project, they want something
  \"bigger,\" \"bolder,\" \"more forceful,\" \"less friendly,\" \"more empowering,\"
  etc. I understand they're looking for something that screams for a call to action
  (empowering people to take control of our air quality), but I also feel it should
  reflect the subject of the call to action itself.\r\n\r\nThey wish to keep it in
  title case, with the period. Other options are not an option.\r\n\r\nPart of me
  says, \"Give 'em what they want,\" but I happen to really believe in this campaign
  and wish to get it right. I also have a great relationship with these guys, and
  would like to maintain it.\r\n\r\nI'm not really sure how to proceed from here (both
  type-wise and politely educating the client any further). What are your thoughts?
  Any advice you may have would be quite appreciated."

    I like Sauna BTW.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.typografski.de/fontboutique/pages/e_free_neoretro.html|Neo
    Retro]], or even something by hand, particularly in the volumetric outline form
    might be interesting.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Based on what you've said, it sounds like the message they are trying to convey
    is, from their perspective, a serious issue (hence, the Helvetica Black, all caps,
    etc). The problem is you have a disagreement about the tone or feel of the design.
    It looks like you would prefer this campaign to have a friendlier feel, which
    they obviously don't agree with. I would have to agree with them when it's an
    issue of health. If you could work the blue in somewhere, and go with a strong
    typeface, other than Helvetica, that might be a good compromise. I would trust
    the client, and try to understand WHY they want these things they are asking for,
    then you can try and meet their objectives with a better design sense. They don't
    know fonts, but they do know that what looks "serious" to them. I have always
    found that the more I try and understand the problem, and the message and intent
    of the project the better the solution will be. Good luck.

  body: "Sauna is pretty playful. Your gradients, color and outline had me thinking
    Orbitz.\r\n\r\nBrowse over at FontShop under \"Condensed Black\", and it should
    turn up things such as:\r\n\r\nAbsara Headline Black\r\nMeta Headline Black\r\nSanuk
    Fat\r\nBau Super\r\nMundo Sans Super\r\nNeo Sans Ultra\r\nand on and on and on
    and on...\r\n\r\nIt should be possible to find a sans that will make both you
    and your client happy. \r\n\r\nSide note: What is the tone and voice of the campaign?
    Is it light and friendly, or more serious? Or is it like most website copy --
    ripped from a powerpoint and devoid of voice? (ahhhhh!) That to say, the success
    of this campaign is riding on the idea, not the font. Your font and design language
    should be appropriate and supportive to the message, not to the concept of \"Air\"
    or anything else.\r\n\r\nIn other words... You can shellac a turd, and it will
    be nice and shiny, but it will still stink. Good for your portfolio, bad for the
    air.\r\n\r\nEdit: Not saying the campaign or your work is a turd  :-) Just checking
    to see if the horse is before the cart."

  body: "Well, I can see why your client is unsatisfied with the website.  It feels
    like the waiting room of the DMV.\r\n\r\nI think that Helvetica is versatile enough
    that it doesn't necessarily have to be corporate and stodgy.  Unfortunately, the
    designer before you has certainly given you evidence to set up against my claim.\r\n\r\nThere
    is an image of a senior citizen in the current site: would this change with your
    redesign?  I've liked all the suggestions made so far for the varieties of type,
    but if the senior citizen audience will remain, it will certainly rule out selections
    like Neo Retro or Sauna Bold.  I don't see senior citizens taking that kind of
    type treatment seriously.  In this case, \"elegant\" and \"authoritative\" certainly
    must play heavily into your design.  \r\n\r\nI'll hold off on any suggestions
    until I hear more about the audience or what else you hope to accomplish given
    the parameters of the project.  I don't want to waste your time with ideas that
    won't help you.\r\n\r\n--\r\nNick Hladek"

    taken. ; ) And the FontShop idea was quite helpful.\r\n\r\nOthers, great advice
    about the \"own\" vs. \"air.\" Thanks.\r\n\r\nNick, DMV! Ha! The senior citizen
    is only one of several \"teasers\" (as they've been calling them). If you revisit
    the site (or click the ALA logo), it will reload to a different teaser (or it
    should, anyway). This site is more for a target audience of 25 to 45 year-olds,
    with a few of resources available for seniors.\r\n\r\nMore comments are encouraged...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    to pick their two favorites. They narrowed it down to Aachen, Vista black, and
    H&FJ Leviathan. Of the people who chose, the one they all had in common was Leviathan.
    Sweet.\r\n\r\nThanks for all your input, everyone."

  body: "> Crap! They changed their minds back to Helvetica Black.\r\n\r\nVery good.\r\n\r\nI
    really don't see why they should be forced to use such a fat, aged and ugly typeface
    like Leviathan. You might talk them into switching to the not so bulky Helvetica
    Heavy, however.\r\n\r\nFor some inspiration on using Helvetica why not take a
    look at some companies, that use it as their corpoarte typeface, like Lufthansa
    for instance (at least they deal with air, too  ;))?\r\nhttp://www.lufthansa.com\r\n\r\nIf
    you have not yet given up on your quest to avoid Helvetica at any price, this
    page with explicit alternatives might be of interest to you:\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fontfeed/archives/helvetica-and-alternatives-to-helvetica/\r\n\r\n"
