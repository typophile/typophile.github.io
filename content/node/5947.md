  installed Adobe&#39;s Creative Suite. While I&#39;m enjoying learning InDesign &#40;over
  time, it will be &#34;bye bye&#34; to Quark after 13 loyal yet increasingly frustrating
  years&#41;. I&#39;ve been using Font Reserve to manage my 10,000 fonts. &#40;Yes,
  I know I need to freeze about two weeks of time to go through and one by one examine
  and dump or preserve each font&#41;  <BR> <BR>BUT here&#39;s the problem: periodically,
  randomly, daily, an Adobe application will abruptly quit. Many hours on tech support,
  and I&#39;m convinced that corrupt fonts are at the heart of the problem. I am running
  Font Doctor to try and diagnose this. It&#39;s been running for about 20 hours straight,
  and is not nearly done fixing ID number conflicts. <BR> <BR>Two part question: Are
  you all experiencing similar crashes in OS 10.3? Do you also find Font Doctor extraordinarily
  slow? Any tips? <BR> <BR>many thanks, <BR>MarTay'

  body: I ran my font library &#40;1600&#43; according to Suitcase&#41; through Font
    Doctor and it took about and hour and half to do all the diagnostics &#40;duplicate
    fonts, font IDs, etc.&#41;. There must be something wrong when it takes 20 hours.
    I don&#39;t have any tips other than regular system maintenance - weekly Cocktail,
    monthly Disk Warrior. I am running 10.3.5 and Adobe CS and the only app that crashes
    is InDesign. Pretty rare though. <BR>GOOD LUCK! <BR>peace
