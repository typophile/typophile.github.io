  body: Mr Bush just try to prove that what Michael Moore tell on its movie is no
    more than the truth. <BR> <BR>Perhaps, after petrol companies, he is now sponsored
    by independent movies distributors? ;-&#41;

  body: Disney, the original distributor who decided against distributing Mr Moore&#39;s
    film, also has a very very large amusement park in Florida that gets rather a
    lot of tax breaks. <BR> <BR>Dubya&#39;s brother, Jeb, is, of course, governor
    of Florida. <BR> <BR>No link of course!

    Disney sent the check every month. However, it&#39;s true that Mr. Eisner warned
    Mr. Moore &#40;or his agent&#41; that he didn&#39;t want to make the movie. <BR>
    <BR>It is true that the deal with Disney was over. But  Mr. Harvey  Weinstein
