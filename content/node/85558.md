body: "Hello everybody,\r\n\r\nI am new to type designing and Fontlab Studio and for
  a while I have been working on my typeface, and now it is time to try to generate
  my font and make it work, I have set some kerning classes but I have problem generating
  my font which would include working kerning. I also get these messages when generating
  font:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n[WARNING] <FONTnew-600> Glyph class @FONTnew-600 redefined
  [/Users/imac/Library/Application Support/FontLab/Studio 5/Features/fontlab.fea 24]\r\n<code>\r\n[NOTE]
  <FONTnew-600> Removing duplicate glyph <itilde> [/Users/imac/Library/Application
  Support/FontLab/Studio 5/Features/fontlab.fea 76]\r\n\r\nThese \"warnings\" and
  \"notes\" are actually pasted 15 more times but with different number at the end
  after \"fontlab.fea\", but didn't want to paste it here since it would be too large
  and awfull :) If it is important I can paste the whole text.\r\n\r\nI assume that
  this happent to lot of people but I have tried searching through the internet and
  through this forum and haven't found a solution and I have a deadline about this
  since it is my bachelor work so if anyone could help I would really appreciate it
  very much!\r\n\r\nThanks in advance"

  body: The numbers at the end of the error messages are line numbers, indicating
    which line of the feature code is causing the error. You can save the code to
    a text file from the dropdown menu in the OpenType panel, then open in a text
    editor and see if the referenced line numbers provide any clues to the errors.
    If your feature code is limited to kerning, you might also try Tools > Kerning
    Assistance to check for overlaps or other oddities, then update the kern feature.

  body: You also might see if "Clean up classes" in FontLab catches any issues (first
    button in Classes panel).

  body: You have the same glyph in more than one kerning pair and FontLab is attempting
    to fix the problem. You need to review your classes and fix the problem.

  body: "Thank you all for your answers I really appreciate it.\r\n\r\nI have found
    that itilde was actually in two classes and delete it which resulted in removing
    the last error but still \"glyph class..\" and I'm dont have idea what does that
    mean.\r\nAs for the gargoyle's suggestion, it didn't give me much clue, thanks
    for the try :) It seems that \"m\" and \"O\" are overlapping, but \"m\" is defined
    in one class that I have only set to kern on the left side and the other to kern
    on the right side (im not sure how is this called, but in the classes panel I
    have checked left box for one class and right box for the second one) so I'm not
    sure how to set the class kerning right than?\r\n\r\nThanks again for your help"

  body: "Apparently the \"Glyph class ... redefined\" error occurs when classes are
    defined both in the Classes panel and in the lower pane of the OpenType panel.
    Google turns up a few old threads with more explanation:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.google.com/search?q=fontlab+warning+%22glyph+class%22"

    warnings, but still my kerning doesn't work in for instance Photoshop CS5? Are
    there some additional options that I need to check so it would work?\r\n\r\nThanks
    again for help everybody!"

  body: You need to limit the kerning to something simple, make that work, and then
    build it up again. Save a copy of your font and delete all of the classes. Then
    start adding them and testing them, <em>one class at a time</em>, until you understand
    how to build working kerning classes. Then go back and fix the original font.
