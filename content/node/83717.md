body: "I've been reading through the various threads (http://typophile.com/node/31762)
  regarding UPM size but I'm struggling to draw my conclusions.\r\n\r\nFollowing these
  threads I tentatively drew a font at 2000 UPM. However when I generate OpenType
  PS I am encountering several issues including the halving of kerning values (or
  nearest possible half) in InDesign.\r\n\r\nAdditional problems:\r\nWhen I reopen
  this file in FontLab the cap height has been capped at 1500 (the actual value is
  1522).\r\nWhen I preview the font the leading is halved.\r\n\r\nI was led to believe
  that it was possible to up the UPM to 2000! Can someone please offer a definitive
  answer?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n"

  body: I have not encountered any of the issues you report, using 2048 for CFF OT
    fonts. The only issues I encountered were a) half height cursor selection colouring
    in older versions of InDesign (a cosmetic problem), and b) problems with scaling
    in some third-party PDF creators (a serious bug, and the reason I regretfully
    went back to 1000 UPM for CFF fonts after that).

    software? Wouldn't it make more sense to just start releasing valid CFF OpenType
    fonts and tell software developers to get their act together and fix their crappy
    code?"

    bugs against software that fails. But in this case my clients wanted to avoid
    the PDF creation bug, because its so bad.'

  body: "I've not done the unthinkable then by upping to 2000?\r\nInterestingly the
    halving in InDesign is only suggested in the panels, not the layout, so a kerning
    value of 100 in FontLab will show as 50 in InDesign type panel but 100 in the
    actual layout\u2026\r\n\r\nI don't want to go back to 1000 as it doesn't suit
    the way I like to draw."

    and tracking in 1/1000 units per em, regardless of the actual UPM of the font
    in use. This is sensible, because it means that spacing is not radically scaled
    when you switch fonts."
