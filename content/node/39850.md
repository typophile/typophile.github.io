  and im looking for a font that does that well. I've never trying mixing upper and
  lower cases so im not sure about the specific best practices when it comes to that.

  body: I recently discovered that H&FJ (in its presentation of <A HREF="http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100003">Cyclone</A>)
    calls this "biform". It may just because I've been working on one of these for
    the past several years, but I think I prefer this term. While "unicase" implies
    a lack, the idea that you only get one case where other typefaces have two, "biform"
    emphasizes the choices made available.

    like a typographic term, while  biform  sounds a bit like it has to do with say,
    polymer technology. Maybe just a matter of familiarity :) "

  body: And, I now realize, there exist unicase fonts with only one form per letter.
    So perhaps "biform unicase" is best considered a subcategory of unicase.

    font with two cases, i.e. big and small letters. This situation exists normally
    with letters such as c, s, x, and o, which have the same form in both cases.\r\n\r\nSo
    really, \"biform\" is a bit of a misnomer, as each letter has only a single form!\r\n\r\nSo
    I propose that this category of typeface, presently termed unicase, by renamed
    UNIFORM or MONOFORM.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Uni1_4917.jpg]\r\n\r\nEunoia
    Unicase (above) is monoform, cased with different sizes--strokes widths optically
    adjusted and kerned between cases. Panoptica Script (below) is monoform, but rendered
    slightly differently between cases as stylistic alternatives.\r\n\r\nUniform is
    probably better, as it implies that the form is unified between cases, whereas
    monoform suggests that there is only one  form, which could also describe a single
    case of titling capitals.\r\n\r\n "

  body: I'm sorry i should have clarified. I'm designing a logo for radiohead's new
    album "In Rainbows". I have a concept that involves having the letters In raised
    above rainbows, and im experimenting with different fonts and cases, for the word
    rainbows, thus far lower case r and a are working quite well but i dont' want
    to use a lower case b because i want the word rainbows to be as contained within
    a rectangular shape as possible.  Here are a couple of loose sketches im working
    on right now.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/in_rainbows_sketches_3473.jpg]

  body: Almost forgot i should probably explain the reasoning behind this design.  The
    basic concept goes like this, the term in rainbows is about how we all chase "rainbows"
    (i.e. our dreams, relationships, goals, etc.) but often times when we reach that
    "rainbow" we see that it is emptiness.  So i thought the best way to express this
    visually was to simply use the in that was already in the word rainbows and raise
    it above the rest of the word thus creating an empty space representing the emptiness
    of the rainbow. Naturally in needs to be the first read so i used the wavy lines
    on the rest of the word (which also resemble the curvature of a rainbow) to fade
    it back. Also the album feels very stripped down and light so visually the lines
    worked to bring about that feeling as well. However i haven't nailed down the
    typography very well and could use any advice you guys might have.

    once is intriguing.\r\nPerhaps if you combine n and b with a common element that
    exists in a quantum state--in either letter, depending on the reader-- that could
    help demonstrate the idea.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/InRb_6453.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n"
