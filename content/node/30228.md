  members of SoTA, the latest issue of [[Interrobang]] is well worth the price of
  admission alone. It is all [[William Addison Dwiggins|Dwigged out]] with terrific
  articles and contributions by [[Tamye Riggs]], [[Jon Coltz]], [[Tiffany Wardle]],
  [[Stephen Coles]], [[Kent Lew]], [[Richard Kegler]], and [[Allan Haley]].\r\nThere
  is plenty of both serious and humorous Dwiggins Nation to keep you reading so come
  get [[sota|SoTAsfied]]! This thing is a keeper!\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    first in full-color. I contributed only production and some design, the main credit
    goes to the others you mentioned. \r\n\r\nLooks like someone needs to update the
    Wiki entry. Wish I had a moment today."

    of it. And Stephen is being his usual humble self as he really was the lead designer
    on this one and I was just the pesky detail person.

  body: "Thanks, everyone, for the kind words. We are really proud of this issue,
    and of the involvement of so many generous and creative people from the type,
    design, and printing history communities.\r\n\r\nIn addition to those Chris listed
    (Stephen, Jon, Tiffany, Kent, Rich, Allan and myself), Paul Shaw, Bruce Kennett,
    and Charles Nix contributed materials. We had tremendous support from the folks
    in the Rare Books and Manuscripts Department at the Boston Public Library and
    contributions from the University of Kentucky Libraries, Chauncey Hawley Griffith
    Papers, Special Collections Department.\r\n\r\nSo many people have been inspired
    by Dwiggins - we only scratched the surface. The type designers with work featured
    in the magazine include Akira Kobayashi, Cyrus Highsmith, Jonathan Hoefler, Sibylle
    Hagmann, Tobias Frere-Jones, Jim Spiece, Thomas Rickner, David Berlow, Rich, Charles,
    and Kent. The Font Bureau, ITC, P22, Linotype, and Monotype Imaging provided additional
    support.\r\n\r\nIt was an incredible experience to delve into the wonderful world
    of Dwiggins. I really fell in love with the man and his work during the process
    of producing the mag and Dwigfest at TypeCon2006.\r\n\r\nAnyone visiting Boston
    should plan to spend time at the BPL - their Dwiggins collection is nothing short
    of amazing.\r\n\r\nWe don't have many copies left of this issue of <em>Interrobang</em>.
    We'll have membership up very very soon, and new members will get this issue while
    supplies last :)\r\n\r\nWe'll be working on a new issue shortly, and welcome ideas
    for themes and article submissions."

    She is awesome, and her type kicks booty. It's only related to Interrobang in
    that we showed an Odile specimen in the mag and my article and Interrobang both
    give love to Dwiggie. Otherwise, it's the story of a girl and her typeface.\r\n\r\nOne
    of our gurutastic board members, Dave Hollingsworth, just sent me a link to test
    the membership registration system. He's doing some behind-the-scenes wizardry
    to hook it up to our TypeCon payment gateway so we don't have to jack with PayPal
    anymore. It's just a couple of days away from launch :)"

    Well done to everyone associated with it. I concur with Tamye - the Boston Public
    Library is an excellent way to spend an afternoon if you are in anyway interested
    in WAD. Thanks again to all for your time and effort :) '
