  body: "Based partly on the g I would classify this as a faux typewriter font. It
    can also be classified as a monoline slab serif. \r\nThe fontmaker may have called
    it something else.\r\nInfo as to source of your image and approximate date would
    help to clarify.\r\nIf it's recent, I trust that someone will recognize it by
    font name.\r\ndon"

  body: "This looks like a typewriter font, except that the letters are not monospaced.
    The only upper case letter (W) is much wider than the other letters. ITC American
    Typewriter is this way but the letter shapes are not the same. Monotype's Typewriter
    Elite has closer shapes, especially for the 'a', with its short tail, but other
    details are not right, like the tail on the 't'. \r\n\r\nMy guess is that the
    Monotype font may have been customized, or else this is not a font I could find
    in my searching.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega\r\n"
