body: Is the Dodgers logo hand lettered? I&#39;m looking for the typeface used, or
  at least a similar one. Someone told me that the old Letraset font Kestrel was the
  font used for the logo, but I can&#39;t seem to find it anywhere... Does anyone
  have any input on this? <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/25248.gif"

  body: I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a font, but there are some fonts like this. Kestrel
    would be similar, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s available in digital format.
    You might also try Leslie Cabarga&#39;s <a href="http://www.flashfonts.com/flashsite/fontspage.htm">Casey</a>.

  body: Another one I suggest to people who want the baseball style swashes is <a
    href="http://www.letterheadfonts.com/contributors/tomkennedy/pilsner.shtml" target="_blank">Letterhead
    Fonts &#34;Pilsner&#34;</a>, which comes with a whole font set of swash shapes
    you can add to the names. &#40;Looks like Casey might have some too. That was
    a new one for me Mark.&#41; <BR> <BR>Letterhead also has one called <a href="http://www.letterheadfonts.com/contributors/tomkennedy/ephemera.shtml"
    target="_blank">Ephemera</a>, with swashes, but the letter style is much older
    and fancier-looking.

  body: I recently purchased Pilsner for use in a magazine layout. The story was about
    minor league baseball, and the font and swashes worked well. They required minor
    manual tweaking, but got me very close to the old-school baseball logo look very
    quickly.
