  Grotesk</strong> is Florian Schick\u2019s personal interpretation of Kaart Antieke
  \u2013 an early 20th century sans serif used by Piet Zwart in his famous, yet never
  officially published essay about modern typography called \u201CVan oude tot nieuwe
  typografie\u201D.\r\n\r\nTrio Grotesk started as a student project for the KABK
  [[http://new.typemedia.org/|Type & Media]] masters course in type design. During
  a visit to the [[http://meermanno.nl/|Meermanno Museum]] in Den Haag Florian discovered
  the only two remaining copies of Piet Zwart\u2019s essay. Being struck by the historical
  value of this booklet, he decided to revive the typeface it was set in instantly.\r\n\r\nFlorian
  enlarged and examined the original 7 point printed typeface in great detail and
  tried to replicate the image of this typeface as faithfully as possible. Certain
  features which are unique to letterpress printing, such as roundings caused by ink
  spread, have been preserved for instance.\r\n\r\nTrio Grotesk comes in three weights,
  sports a Latin extended characterset and includes small caps, seven ranges of figures,
  and numerous arrows, ornaments and dingbats.\r\n\r\nMore info: [[http://www.boldmonday.com/en/triogrotesk/|www.boldmonday.com]]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/triogrotesk-580-02_3678.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/triogrotesk-580-03_5250.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/triogrotesk-580-04_6225.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/triogrotesk-580-05_3634.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/triogrotesk-580-06_4883.png]\r\n\r\n<strong>Bold

    of course, although this is not your average low contrast, slightly condensed,
    clean-shaven corporate sans serif. We released this typeface first of all because
    of its connection to Dutch typographic history. And simply because we love the
    overall design!"

  body: The fit is indeed quite open since it is based on 7 point metal type. The
    generous spacing guarantees that the typeface is still very readable in small
    sizes.

    though, HTML entities work in the input box, so &amp;#64257; (&#64257;), &amp;#64258;
    (&#64258;), &amp;ndash; (&ndash;) and &amp;mdash; (&mdash;) will do as well, though
    slower.

  body: Very nice! I'm not a professional when it comes to type (helaas pindakaas
    haha) but it has certain qualities of a monospaced font. Must've got to do with
    the wide spacing.

  body: "That is the personality of the typeface, and furthermore, it serves a functional
    purpose.\r\n\r\nThe small apertures of /a and /e distinguish their terminal detail
    from that of a frequently adjacent character with similar details and general
    shape: /s.\r\n\r\nIn an extended style such as this, the middle of the /s tends
    to the horizontal, so that there are three characters with a potentially theta-ish
    appearance, /a, /e, and /s.\r\n\r\nThe design of /a and /e disambiguates them
    from /s.\r\n\r\nIt also removes the possibility of a \u201Csuper-counter\u201D
    occurring in the combination of adjacent counters in the e_s and s_a combinations.\r\n\r\nSuch
    almost-closed counters are also found in the Scotch (Modern) genre of serifed
    type.\r\n"

    distinct from an /s/?"
