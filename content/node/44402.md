body: "Hello everyone, \r\n\r\nThis is a logo that I'm working on for my church (translated
  from Romanian as Independent Baptist Church). I\u2019d greatly appreciate your input
  in this design. \r\n\r\nSome additional information: the church is conservative,
  yet friendly. The \u201Ctagline\u201D to go with the logo is \u201CBuilding on the
  Word\u201D (a reference to the Bible, obviously). The font I\u2019m currently using
  is Amerigo BT. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your help. \r\n\r\nDan\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_abib_6310.jpg]"

  body: "The open book part is a nice mark. Have you played with flatter ends on it?\r\n\r\nThe
    serifs on Amerigo are sharp and angular, they don't seem to compliment the open
    book. Since all the letters are connected,my eyes want to see the letters spaced
    a little further apart. I had to read it twice before I actually figured out what
    it said. Something about the N and A forms an M to me"

  body: "Andrew,\r\n\r\nThank you for your comment. Do you think Amerigo is not a
    suitable choice for the logo? If so, what would you recommend? I will try to space
    out the letters a bit and repost the image. It\u2019s interesting that you were
    unable to figure out what it said at first glance. Of course, you don\u2019t know
    the language, but this gives me valuable insight. \r\n\r\nDan"

  body: "Alright, I increased the kerning (I know, not by much...). This is a \"quick
    fix\". \r\n\r\nJonathan, thank you for pointing that also.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_abib_4139.jpg]\r\n\r\nI'd
    say the most important thing in the logo is the open book - I'd like to keep that
    concept. If it creates too many problems around the N and the A next to it, I'd
    rather try to find a different face, than scrap the book idea. "

  body: I'd try one option with more rounded serif, it's hard to judge in my head.
    Have you tried adjusting the curves of the book so that they form the center crossbar
    on the E as well?

  body: Yes, I've tried that, but the curve is too tall and looks odd - also loosing
    the book resemblance. I will try to change the typeface and see how that works.

  body: beautiful logo, nice touch with the slashed text (well, not slashed but an
    open book.  I read it as not just an open book, but openness towards outsiders
    or ideas and people.
