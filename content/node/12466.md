    a deal. It's not like it was a serious news story. A little light entertainment
    in the Arts section. Much nicer than being mentioned in a story about a terrorist

    to the clerk at the local bookstore why I was buying a copy of the paper. Mustn't

  body: "> A little light entertainment in the Arts section.\r\n\r\nOverall, the article
    is just that, and I think John's 'moronic' is way too harsh. It does give the
    idea that an interest in fonts can be quite enjoyable, which is great. \r\n\r\nBut
    these sentences were for me bad journalism:\r\n\r\n\"Graphic designers, who often
    have fonts to sell, can be cranky about where their p's and q's come from, and
    they seem to be getting crankier by the minute. Maybe it's because there is less
    and less demand for original typefaces;\"\r\n\r\nFirst, I would think that actually
    a very small percentage of graphic designers produce and sell fonts. Second, if
    the demand for original typefaces was falling off I think I would have heard about
    it on Typophile. My impression is the opposite. \r\n\r\nThe tone of 'oh those
    whacky people' is standard journalistic fare, and not a serious issue, though
    I think it is shallow. Someone at the New York Times who makes claims about the
    type business should really feel a need to check their facts, which she obviously
    didn't.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n "

    when Paul Krugman does an op-ed piece, usually describing the end of Western Civilization

    well, considering their usual quality, lack of precision and focus on the goofy
    and irrelevant (ban Comic Sans? yawn -- it isn't even fresh filler). Most journalism
    is increasingly characterised by functional ignorance of the topics being reported
    on, supplemented by hasty Internet research -- the result of hiring journalism
    school graduates instead of writers, I suspect --; journalism about type seems
    particularly embarassing to me, but maybe people in other professions feel the
    same way about coverage of their own fields. Having been dumbed-down in 'quotes'
    by a number of journalists over the years, I think I'm entitled to be harsh."

    for an article that is substandard is \"journalism.\"\r\n\r\nI just recently talked
    to a fine journalist who has covered one industry for much of his career, and
    he says he regularly has to explain to serious people that he is not like what
    they see on TV - he actually understands what he writes about. He thinks the big
    problem is that journalism school is the worst preparation for journalism, because
    you come out being ignorant of every subject.\r\n\r\nThis wouldn't be so bad if
    as a rule journalists had humility and were willing to learn, and wanted to learn.

    generally is a really grave problem,  \r\n\r\n"

    Times (and the Times is still the best US paper I know of hands down -- maybe

    article on the furniture fair and cover home design well and often, they have
