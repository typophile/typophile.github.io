  of those round poster display things that I&#39;ve seen in Amsterdam and Paris.  <BR>
  <BR>I haven&#39;t got a clue what the proper name for them is. Does anyone know
  what I mean? <BR> <BR>I need some pictures, as we are going to manufacture a couple
  of these for an exhibition Iam working on. <BR> <BR>Jim <BR>===
