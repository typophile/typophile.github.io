  typefaces? I've been using the modern DIN, so something quite rigid & taut. I've
  been searching, but I imagine your expertise will trump most.\r\n\r\nAny sort of
  help would be brilliant,\r\n\r\nTom"

  body: Dezcom, it's a student project for One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. I was
    hoping the type would mirror what would be used in that sort of institution (a
    hospital), or of a similar epoch.

    \ Probably all caps.  Institutions would be a bit behind the curve so their signage
    would have looked  post war American rather than hip for that time Modernist.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    Cuckoos's nest was staged in a NOT private hospital where the patients were probably
    poor or blue-collar at best. Think along the lines of Trenton NJ instead of upper
    East-side Manhattan.  This was a dismal State Mental Institution with a low budget.
    \ Signs should be worn-looking and degraded.  That being said, Leroy Lettering
    would also be a strong candidate."

  body: "For institutional, I\u2019d take Trade Gothic over Franklin Gothic. Less
    overt personality. \r\n\r\nThe Trade Gothic series was relatively new in the 50s
    & 60s, riding a resurgence of interest in American Gothics after decades of European
    Geometrics in the mainstream, and would possibly have been more widely used than
    Franklin Gothic at that time."

  body: Kent, I don't think a State mental hospital then would have been likely to
    ride the "new".  Perhaps more Government institutional looking would have been
    likely?

  body: Thanks to all of you, I will try out both Trade & Franklin, especially. Because
    the idea is to spark a renewed interest in the novel, Trade might work well.

  body: "I don\u2019t know that it would have been a matter of \u201Criding the new\u201D
    as a matter of availability. \r\n\r\nFranklin Gothic was primarily a handset face,
    from ATF. Monotype did have a version of Franklin Gothic for their machine, I
    believe, but I don\u2019t think it was widely used in that format (could be wrong
    about that). \r\n\r\nLinotype never adapted Franklin Gothic, that I know of. Instead,
    Trade Gothic was Linotype\u2019s response to this general style and would have
    been widely stocked in most Lino shops at that time. \r\n\r\nSo, it becomes partly
    a matter of what technology was likely to have been used for setting printed matter
    for a state mental hospital of that era. I\u2019m betting against handsetting
    or Monotype.\r\n\r\nNow, if one is talking signage, then all bets are off, since
    that would not likely have been type."
