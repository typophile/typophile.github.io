body: "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nThis is a font that I have been working on on and off in the
  last year and I will call it \"Reethi Rah\". I named it after the One&Only Resort
  island Reethi Rah, where my wife and I spent our honeymoon. This place is sheer
  paradise and I started sketching on this font from the first day. \r\nI think this
  has big potential and I want to go all the way with this font. It's the first serif
  font I've made and I did it very intuitive. The font should be optically and emotionally
  balanced. You'll find the details where I fiddled with forms and proportions. \r\n\r\nI'd
  like your expert opinion on this first draft. I think this font will polarise some
  of you people out there. The serifs are kinda extreme and will not be everyones
  darling. In small these serifs work very well and give the font a pleasant warmth
  and softness to it. In large the serifs come out in full strength and show their
  freaky nature. It's a love or hate thing...\r\n\r\nI optimized the proportions for
  setting long reading texts in (art)books, articles, etc. The font has no correct
  spacing and kerning yet. I will do this when I leave the beta stage.\r\n\r\nWhat
  do you think about it? What do you like and what not? But most important is that
  you give me some expert feedback on the proportions, legibility and charisma of
  the font. \r\n\r\nThanx in advance,\r\n\xAEen\xE9"

    'S' need some delicate touches to flow; the bottom serif of 'y' is too blocky;
    the bottom left part of the 'M' stem has a bump, same for the 'q'; '2' looks lighter."

    fact I'm envious... I mean of the font.  :-)\r\n\r\nThis is what PoMo was supposed
    to mature into. Serious mannerism. Very nice the way the serifs do indeed seem
    to have a dual personality, as you claim. And some of your stroke weight distribution
    (like in the \"w\") and termination (like in the \"c\"/\"e\") is genial.\r\n\r\nI'll
    try to find the time to do a full critique (I haven't succeeded in doing that
    lately) but for the time being I'd like to point out the following:\r\n1) Vertical
    proportions: good. Somewhat generous x-height.\r\n2) Nice and darkish.\r\n3) 1
    & 2 combine to make this ideal for ~9 point text... assuming you get the spacing
    right: on the loose side.\r\n4) Trapping: great idea (especially considering your
    color and -presumed- target size) but don't actually put it in until the end.\r\n5)
    The bottom-left link of the \"g\" is too much.\r\n6) Some lc letters could be
    less timid: \"f\" (narrow), \"r\" (why castrated?), \"t\" (blah) and \"x\" (narrow).\r\n7)
    Numerals: \"7\" is a bit too curvy; \"8\" is out of character. And why not hybrid
    nums? They work best overall (even though your x-height is big enough to make
    traditional OS nums OK).\r\n8) UC: \"G\" not working; \"K\" high waist out of
    character; \"N\" not working; \"Q\" lousy - give it a TAIL dude - what is this,
    Minion?!; \"T\" top too symmetrical.\r\n\r\n> I want to go all the way with this
    font.\r\n\r\n> It\u2019s a love or hate thing\u2026\r\n\r\nSounds like a honeymoon
    font for sure. :-)  BTW, definitely use \"optically and emotionally balanced\"
    in your promotional text.\r\n\r\nOh, and if you don't finish this, I'm coming
    after you.\r\nMaldives, Upper Waziristan, doesn't matter - I'll hunt you down.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Thanx for your critique Hrant. I see your most criticism goes out to the
    UC characters. To me, if I'd characterize them, they have a touch of Jugendstil
    in them. The curved legs of the A, M, N, might date it in the early 1910's, right?
    Perhaps this is wat bothers you in an otherwise quite unconventional font?\r\nI
    can totally follow you with your critique, but I guess it is that I'd hate to
    kill my darlings. I kinda like the 7 and 8 because they totally fit to the atmosphere
    and decorational elements on the island. But I see that in the font they're kinda
    out of place. \r\nWould you give the Q a really long tail, and make it dive under
    the neighbour character?\r\n\r\nThe best thing of this font though is that it
    makes me think of my holiday... ;-)\r\n\r\nI'll get back to you later on this.
    I'm very busy lately so progress is slow. \r\n\r\nTHANX,\r\n\xAE"

    body: "Hi Rene,\r\n\r\nThis is a great font, definetely a lot of character! \r\n\r\nIt
      looks like the way the characters are 'drawn' is by nib based pen mainly. Bearing
      this in mind, some of the characters feel a bit off. For instance the legs of
      the K and R, don't have that characteristic 'nib' ending as is present in the
      other letters / nums. \r\n\r\nI played around with your R and gave it a nib-ending.
      \r\n\r\nI think this may be a slightly better fit, the same can be done on the
      K, and maybe on the J / j as well. \r\n\r\nAlso the lower beak of the S / s,
      seem to have a brush type ending, which is not apparent in the other characters.
      Here a nib ending may provide a better fit as well. \r\n\r\nI agree with hrant
      on the 8, the 'crossing' in the center feels a bit blocky, which is a bit out
      of tune with the rest. \r\n\r\nMy comments are based on the reflection of the
      'writing tool' in the final shape of the letters (nib pen, brush etc.). This
      may be a too rigid of a viewpoint, but as I am learning type design myself,
      this forms a good reference.\r\n\r\nBtw, great specimen, I like the text as
      well (I am Dutch as well...).\r\n\r\nSebastian[img:sites/default/files/old-images/R_5521.jpg]"

    structural proportion. BTW, check out these old sketches of mine, for Paphos:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/uca_4192.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ucm_5813.gif]\r\n\r\nYou

    font is still alive.  :-)\r\n\r\nTail of the \"Q\": Dunno, I'm imagining something
    like Baskerville or Electra.\r\n\r\n> It looks like the way the characters are
    \u2018drawn\u2019 is by nib based pen mainly.\r\n\r\nIs that true? (I hope not.)\r\n\r\nBut
    that \"R\" suggestion isn't bad at all.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I did some changes to a few characters (see ReethiRah2.pdf above). One step
    at a time.\r\n\r\nI totally agree with the N and the new one looks also much better.
    Together with this N I also changed the M, because it felt a bit out of tune.
    I'm not sure if I should keep the old or new M, what do you think?\r\n\r\nThe
    new 't' fits like a glove to the rest of the font, so that's a done deal. I'm
    still fiddling with the 'f'. I made one with a small serif in the upper curve,
    and one without. I don't know which one is better. To me the one with the serifs
    feels better, but I like the other one too. On page 6 of the pdf you can see the
    difference. \r\n\r\nSebastian, I like the leg of the R. My only consideration
    would be if it's not to edgy for the font? All serifs are soft and curved and
    this leg is sharp and edgy. But I definitely will give it a spin.\r\n\r\nFor your
    information, I drew this font with a regular pencil. No nibbed pen or any other
    tool. Like I said it's a very intuitive font, so it's even more important to get
    the consistancy in the details right.\r\n\r\nHrant, I'll kill all my darlings
    if it works for the font, but don't ask me to kill my memory of the honeymoon.

  body: "Rene,\r\n\r\nThe new letters indeed look better. For the leg of the R and
    K, I think it may need some massaging of the serif I proposed to make it a bit
    less blocky. \r\n\r\nRegarding the nib-pen confusion, I didn't mean that you drew
    your design with it. I merely was observing the fact that your design had contrast
    to it (O, R etc.) which I linked to a writing tool. Like Venetian / Garalde faces
    such as Bembo, Kuenstler, Garamond etc. have an origin in nib pens.\r\n\r\nSebastian\r\n"

  body: "Old \"M\" for sure. And the new \"N\" is pulled back a little bit too much
    I think. The new \"t\" is nice, but if you can make it exhibit more stroke contrast
    (without making it too wide - the narrowness of the \"t\" is one of its major
    defining attributes) that would be good. For the \"f\", the rightmost one is the
    safest, but you only need it if the middle one is too distracting in text[ure],
    which I don't think it is (thanks to all the other funkiness). Your texture, btw,
    I forgot to mention before, is what's most encouraging about this (which is of
    course what a text font is all about).\r\n\r\nBTW, this just hit me: are you a
    fan of Fleischmann? For one thing this would make a great display companion to
    a Fleischmann for body for anybody who's too afraid of using it for text.\r\n\r\nKilling
    memories: the fact that that's not possible is part of what makes them so much
    better than things like photographs and videos (with the former being especially
    fake to me).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Another update. This time I did the 'Q, N, 7', and some other small things
    you propably won't see.\r\nI think the 'Q' is a mega improvement, so a big THANKS
    goes out to Hrant for seeing that. \r\n\r\nI kept the 'N' as close to the original
    as possible, but optimized the diagonal. Is this enough or should it be even more
    'classical'? I think it should harmonize with the M, that's why I kept the bent
    diagonal. \r\nI tried taking the lower right serif out, but that suddenly reminded
    me of captain Hooks wooden leg. Very strange, so I descided to keep it in and
    just made it smaller for optical proportion.\r\n\r\nI've changed the 'r' before,
    but I just wanted to point it out. It's also much better, so my thumbs up again
    for Hrant. This looks very sweet it the text, and I think it should not have more
    hanging at his nose.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about the serif on the '5'? Inside
    or outside? I see them normally more outside, but I spontaniously put mine inside.
    I feel it's alright there, but what do you think?\r\n\r\nI'm not so sure about
    the '7', because I can't seem to get the contrast right. I will have a closer
    look at it later. Option 3 is the old version. Option 2 is also not bad, but for
    now I'd go for option 1.\r\n\r\nOn to the next level...\r\n\r\n\xAE"
