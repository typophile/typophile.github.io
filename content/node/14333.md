  'grounge', with halftoned background images, and so on. and I chose Gill Bold for
  titles, Gill regular uppercase for subtitles. Now, what do you suggest for the text?
  \ I'd like Mrs Eaves, but if anyone turns up with other alternatives...\r\n\r\nthank
  you very much\r\nmax"

    I'm not sure of their work process with Gill (who died in 1940).\r\n\r\nI don't
    know when it was digitized, but I'm thinking tthat wwe've been selling it for
    years and years.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that we don't promote it because it just has
    two weights at the moment.\r\n\r\n__\r\nwww.typeoff.de"
