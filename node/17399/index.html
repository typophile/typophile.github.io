  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Intuitively it seems to me that readability in moderately contrasting seriffed romans increases along the series vertical axis, oblique axis, variable axis, divergent interior and exterior axes. Would it be ridiculous to suggest that oblique axis spreads letter-differentiating information across a larger portion of the word, away from, as in vertical axis, the top of the vowel height; that variable axis positions differentiating information at different points on letters and so makes them more readily distinguishable, as well as spreading information across the word; and that divergence between the axes of partially or wholly enclosed counters and exterior outlines increases the perceived contrast between black and white themselves, allowing white portions of the word, as in Legato, to unite perceptually? Naturally, divergent interior and exterior axes are not incompatible with variation in either from letter to letter, and in fact in my fiddlings the impression of strength that comes from divergent interior and exterior axes is diminished if those axes and that divergence are too consistent across the alphabet.</p>
<p>I posted this idea to an old thread, then saw it was off-topic; I would love to hear what our readability experts have to say on the matter.</p>

<p>I like your suggestion very much. It isn&rsquo;t ridiculous because it is a long way from being proven or disproven, and also because it is intriguing. Could this help explain why Jenson&rsquo;s highly irregular and variable type is considered so ideal, so satisfying? The letter shapes have a lot of variable stress, alignments, bowl shapes, serifs and apertures that add up to a lot of divergence, not only in the letters (black) but the space as well (white). Surely this is functional and not merely aesthetic.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes - and, ignoring axis for the moment, it is particularly in the lower half of the x-height that most digital romans are insufficiently divergent compared to Jenson&rsquo;s or Griffo&rsquo;s types. Unless it turns out that more attention is payed to the top of the x-height such that small irregularities of rhythm/pattern there are useful, but not further down; even then all information will presumably be preserved to some extent or other.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>George, wonderfully provocative post. I might prefer to replace the term &lsquo;readability&rsquo; here with &lsquo;ease of visual wordform resolution.&rsquo; As I see it, visual wordform resolution is the pivotal perceptual processing event in reading, and depends on cross-letter binding. If one  presumes that too much regularity makes the patternednes of a configuration salient and self-asserting, compromising&ndash;rather than solidifying&ndash;the self-assertion for perception of the configuration&rsquo;s object-like integrity through effective binding, your  sequence is just what one might expect.</p>
<p>This presumption about regularity strikes me as potentially testable.</p>
<p>Your series of contrast-types reads: modern / oldstyle / transitional / postmodern; or: expansion / translation / translation + rotation.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just the old, old story of preventing Figure from disappearing into Ground, isn&rsquo;t it? As, very literally, in the rhythm of prose and poetry (Reuven Tsur constructed a very plausible model of how the brain chunks rhythm, programmed it on a computer, and fed it, if I remember correctly, ten thousand pieces of text. Gratifyingly, the <a href='http://www.ccel.org/m/milton/lost/paradise_lost_1.html'>opening of Paradise Lost</a> came out top in resisting chunking).</p>
<p>I am intrigued by the possibility of testing. It shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard, should it? Indeed the raw materials have almost been assembled in families like Century, though naturally one would prefer to construct a type family for the experiment which was rigorously controlled as to each letter&rsquo;s proportions, spacing, total darkness and contrast.</p>
<p>I think my series reads: 
Modern / Humanist / Baroque / The Best, or
Expansion / Translation / Rotation / Pure Type,
since a much larger number of historical types show divergent axes within single letters than is regularly acknowledged: sticking to what I know best, Griffo&rsquo;s work (his italics especially) and Bembo are examples.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Scientism is bunk.
Reading is primarily a cultural phenomenon, not physiological.
In America, reading became a national obsession starting c.1870. Public education and libraries were instituted, and an explosive growth of popular magazines, newspapers, and dime novels occurred from 1885 thru 1905.
Almost without exception, the text types of the new mass media were moderns (didone), or &ldquo;old styles&rdquo; with vertical stress.
If the modern style is so inimical to reading, why were these types preferred?
The same could be said about sans serifs on the internet.</p>
<p>I would argue that the older forms are favored towards the end of an historical cycle, and divergency has nothing to do with it, other than being a marker of a media&rsquo;s maturity.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Reading is obviously both a cultural phenomenon and a physiological one, at different levels of magnification. Vertical stress types were not preferred from 1870 to 1905, they were the inherited norm. Sans serifs are preferred on the internet partly because the low resolution of screens has a greater impact on seriffed fonts than on sans, partly because of cultural preferences, and partly because the proportion of reading on the internet which is immersive is vanishingly small. What is a historical cycle? And what, really, is scientism? Explanationism?</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><em>&hellip;at different levels of magnification.</em></p>
<p>Physiologically, the process of reading &ndash; saccadic scanning &ndash; is the same for a one word headline as a paragraph of text.</p>
<p><em>Vertical stress types were not preferred from 1870 to 1905, they were the inherited norm.</em></p>
<p>True, but if they had posed any serious problem to the emergence of mass literacy during this period, I suspect that an alternative would have been found. Surely logic would indicate that the boom didn&rsquo;t happen in spite of the type styles that were in use, but <em>because</em> of them.</p>
<p><em>&hellip;the proportion of reading on the internet which is immersive is vanishingly small. </em></p>
<p>That rather begs the question of how much or how deep reading has to be to be considered immersive. Personally, I would consider any average length David Berlow post on Typophile to fit the bill.</p>
<p><em>And what, really, is scientism?</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;The belief that the investigative methods of the physical sciences are applicable or justifiable in all fields of inquiry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Design is a piece of turf fought over by science and art. At the other end of the spectrum from science: &ldquo;The only thing that matters in art is what cannot be explained&rdquo; (Braque).</p>
<p>Braque was contrasting art with literal criticism, but I don&rsquo;t see typography and design as part of this either/or scenario, because it&rsquo;s not a question of whether something may or may not be explained; with design things are best demonstrated, which is a horse of a different colour.</p>

Sorry to be unclear, I meant that reading involved physiological and cultural reception and response at different metaphorical levels of magnification.</p>
<p>The historical evidence is plain that condensed modern faces did not make reading impossible, but logic certainly does not dictate that the boom in reading happened because of these types: I would say that social, economic and literary explanations are more plausible.</p>
<p>And we might as well seek to know and understand what in type design can be known and understood, if, as seems likely, the benefits to type design of this knowledge outweigh the possible drawbacks (like the overweighting of what is known limiting the practical choices of designers to their disadvantage and that of their work).</p>

<p>Logic suggests that all conditions are indispensible to emergent phenomena; synergy created mass literacy and mass media; how could the typefaces involved, which were front and centre in the boom, not be a positive contributing factor?!</p>
<p>Anyway, follow your hunch, it&rsquo;s fascinating stuff.
I designed many of my faces from a similar &ldquo;propositional&rdquo; or theory-driven basis.
The proof of the pudding is in the eating, let&rsquo;s see what kind of face you come up with.</p>
