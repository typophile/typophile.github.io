  types of the early eighteenth-century were extremely popular then, and strongly
  revived in the late nineteenth century, producing many versions.<!--break-->\r\n\r\nSince
  the [[Caslon Foundry]] was in business for a long time, there are many\r\nCaslon
  typefaces. Caslon's designs were markedly different at different sizes (for instance,
  some of his uppercase <strong>C</strong>s had serifs at top and bottom, some only
  at the top); variation in design is not therefore necessarily a sign of \"inauthenticity\".\r\n\r\nCaslon's
  type was popular in every sense. It was popular in the eighteenth century (until
  it was eased out by modern faces in the early 19th). When the fashion of \"old face\"
  revived in the 19th, many in England and America looked to Caslon's type as the
  model. And, at a time when lay people probably knew less about font-names than they
  do now, \"Caslon\" was a name quite a few people did know. George Bernard Shaw,
  for example, absolutely insisted that his work be set in Caslon.\r\n\r\nThis vast
  popularity of Caslon\u2019s types led to a practically endless range of copies,
  among them Caslon 540 from [[ATF|American Type Founders]] in 1902, and Caslon 3,
  a slightly bolder face also from ATF in 1905, which was later modified for use on
  [[Intertype|Intertype]] and [[Linotype|Linotype]] technologies. Both designs have
  the warm, solid, straightforward style that has made Caslon popular for over 200
  years; these Caslons, however, have shorter descenders, and higher contrast, features
  that enable them to hold up better with the faster presses and the new varieties
  of paper \r\nintroduced at the turn-of-the-century.\r\n\r\nAs with [[Garamond]],
  there are not only typefaces which use the Caslon name, but typefaces which are
  Caslon-inspired. Of some importance historically is <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/imprint/\">Imprint</a>,
  which was designed by (English) Monotype in 1913 for use in the (short-lived) <cite>Imprint</cite>
  journal. Because the journal was interested in the \"improvement\" of typography,
  it chose to release its typeface for general use. It took the \"cleaning up\" of
  Caslon's type for modern use a stage further, deliberately increasing x-height,
  reducing the notoriously loose fit of some of Caslon's type, and removing some of
  its archaic character.\r\n\r\n<strong>Discussion:</strong>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/2816\">Caslon's
