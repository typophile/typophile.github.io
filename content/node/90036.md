body: "I always have to think about how to space the caron side of  dcaron/lcaron.
  \r\n\r\nStart with lowercase: do I use a negative sidebearing? In environments with
  no kerning, a negative sidebearing will at least work fine next to lowercase vowels
  and spaces, which it is how dcaron will appear most often. The disadvantage is that
  it will crash into k and some punctuation.\r\n\r\nOn to uppercase: only one word,
  not counting proper nouns, begins with \u010E or \u013D\u2014\u010F\xE1bl\u016Fv.
  So all caps settings seem like a bigger concern, and in such settings it could crash
  into E, I, U, and possibly O depending on the design of the caron and the O. So
  in this case should I go with a positive sidebearing?"

  body: "Comparing this question to an f is erroneous for a variety of reasons. The
    f has a wide range of form depending on the languages and technologies you expect
    to design to. Newspapers with no kerning need one solution- a narrow f. Users
    with access to kerning, ligatures and contextual shapes can use another solutions.
    If the font is just for a language with no clashes between f and diacritic mark
    then even more extravagant shapes are possible. In the case of the dcaron and
    lcaron the range of desirable variation is much much smaller. The f is very big
    and isn't going to be misread as easily as a small mark could be if an overlap
    occurs.\r\n\r\nI suggest that it is nearly always best to err on the side of using
    just space to make your worst case spacing scenario . I say this because it is
    practical - you can kern your way out out. But also because my reading of the
    science on the topic suggest that clashes are worse for reading that gaps are.
    People tolerate gaps really well. The shape of the Caron is relevant too. It is
    tall and thin. It far more susceptible to being misread/unidentified/ignored when
    placed next to an overlapping feature than other kinds of marks would be. \r\n\r\nYou
    might also look at a cross section of fonts you respect.\r\n\r\nYou might also
    ask David B\u0159ezina at Rosetta Type http://rosettatype.com/ .\r\n\r\nWhat about
    some example images so we can see the context as well?"

  body: "Assuming no kerning:\r\n\r\nStatistically, the vast majority of letter combinations
    involving dcaron, lcaron and tcaron are better served by a negative right sidebearing,
    while allowing occasional failure.\r\n\r\nAlso bear in mind words that end with
    dcaron, lcaron and tcaron, being followed by a space or (baseline) punctuation
    mark. Again, negative right sidebearing works better.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Sorry for causing a mess. Sometimes I can't communicate properly and regret
    later.\r\n\r\nI meant that carons are the same type of \"design bug\" as the f.
    So for \"environments with no kerning\" the best way is just to accept the gap,
    as we accept the gap after f. If not (I think of spacing next to the x-height
    letters), half of accents and all ascenders will crash with the caron. That's
    my \"negative sidebearing\".\r\nI guess, nnfn/lcaron/adieresis/n/n in Adobe Caslon
    Pro - the overall rhythm, and specially the rhythm of accents, present themselves
    quiet well ."
