  curious how these effect are made. Can it be done in Illustrator. Can't find any
  tutorials on the internet. \r\n\r\nA few examples:\r\nhttp://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/omg_its_ovg.php\r\nhttp://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/current_lets_its_bold_flag_fly.php\r\n\r\nAny
  help would be very appreciated.\r\nThanks!"

    warp features won't give the results. \r\n\r\nI guess it's done with Envelope
    Distort. The feature seems a little random to me.\r\nOr is it just practise, practise,
    practise?"
