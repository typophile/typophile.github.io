  font called Courier Final Draft. It resembles the old typewriters that were used
  for writing screenplays back in the day. \r\n\r\nWhat's a reasonable price for commissioning
  a font like that? Is there a copyright issue if you commission a font based on an
  existing font family, for example, Courier, in the above example? Thanks in advance."

  body: Courier is a public domain design, but expect to pay between $350 and $24,250
    per weight for a custom (designed from scratch) distressed typewriter font. Price
    will be dependent on designer, their research, character set and number of iterations.
    Price does not include hinting, or expenses (such as purchasing old typewriters
    or trips to the International Typewriter Museum in Oakland, CA.)

    Just one that could have been used on an old typewriter, but to me, that doesn't
    mean 'stressed. After all, \"back in the day\" they new typewriters? \r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: ">With all those distressed type-writer fonts out there, why wouldn't you
    license an existing one?\r\n\r\nWhen screenplays were written with typewriters
    (roughly similar to 12pt Courier font) in \"Hollywood\" format, each page of play
    was roughly equivalent to 1 minute of action, which is why Courier (or Courier
    Final Draft) is still the default font for writing screenplays in this format.
    I think FreeMono would be a pretty good free alternative, but at some point we
    might want to commission a font called Courier X for product X that competes with
    Final Draft to match the competition. I'm just wandering how much that would cost?"

    You\u2019ll also need some more details: technical level, timeframe, character
    set, weights, styles, level of exclusivity etc. OEM licensens are often priced
    as a percentage of the end product retail price. An exclusive design might mean
    a higher one time fee upfront, but on the other hand no running expenses. You
    could also deviate in style within the same widths and metrics as Courier, giving
    your product X a unique voice."

  body: "Pat2, I've been told that if your screenplay is not in Courier, those in
    the movie and TV business won't even look at it. So I think you are stuck with
    something that doesn't look much different. One thing one could do\u2014or I could
    do\u2014is make it more a robust weight than Courier New, without artificial roughness.
    You might ask Nick Shinn whether he could whip you up a monospace version of [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/bodoni-egyptian-pro/regular/|Bodoni
    Egyptian,]] which might look fresh and still pass. "

  body: "David, I know he can't change Courier noticeably. But being more robust can
    be done without changing how it sets or page count. Since it's monospaced, it's
    not exactly rocket science to get it to space *exactly* the same: just set all
    the characters to the same number as Courier. I'm not saying it's a feat of creativity,
    but it might look a little nicer and still be Courier. \r\n\r\nJust checking:
    I see that with my copy of Movie Magic's Screenwriter program there came a special
    \"screenwriter\" version of Courier, which is substantially heavier than New Courier,
    and with higher x-height, and almost the same monospace width\u20141233 instead
    of 1227 (they are both true type fonts.)\r\n\r\nSo it seems that my original suggestion
    was exactly on target. Movie Magic's Screenwriter and Final Draft, which are the
    two most widely used programs for screen play writing I would guess have done
    similar things in producing their own versions of Courier. I could do the same
    for Pat2, who started this thread. \r\n\r\nAnd yes, I've written a screen play.
    Just ask me about it :)  "

  body: "David, height of the caps are not that different, between Courier New and
    Courier Screenwriter, but if you do the same exercise for the lower case, it is
    a lot different, as well as noticeably darker. I think the difference anyone will
    notice when they are side by side. \r\n\r\nYour example of Courier Final Draft
    looks darker in the screen capture in FontLab, but for some reason not in your
    sample. I don't have your \"Courier\" with no other identity on my machine, so
    I can't check the lower case of that or the Final Draft one.  \r\n\r\nThe point
    of my giving the numbers is that the set width is almost identical, but the lower
    case looks a lot bigger and darker. So it is OK as far as the 1 page per minute
    rule. But it looks a lot different on the page, and I think the darker and bigger
    look of Courier Screenwriter is better for use in a screenplay. \r\n \r\nMy understanding
    is that Pat2 has a new screenwriting program and wants to have his own proprietary
    version of Courier for it, rather than buying one from a competitor. So it can't
    be too different and meet the needs, but it can be a little different, and better
    in small ways, and certainly as good as the versions in Final Draft or Movie Magic
    Screenwriter. "
