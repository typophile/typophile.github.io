body: "Hi, I'm setting a newsletter in Minion and it contains a high proportion of
  abbreviations, repeated throughout the text in columns. I started with regular capital
  letters for the abbreviations (such as INGOs, USAID and DFID) but the size of the
  capitals seems to interrupt the smooth reading of the sentences. I tried small caps
  but their size does the same, and looks out of place to my eye in running text.
  \r\nI read somewhere that it was common to use normal caps reduced by 1 point size
  or small caps increased by one point. What are others' preferences here?\r\nI got
  to wondering about Medium caps, but Minion Pro doesn't have them...is this a common
  feature? Even Google didn't turn up much about Medium caps."

    weight and then reduce the normal caps by a point or so. Increasing the weight
    keeps the overall color the same. Use your eye; it will tell you what is right.\r\n\r\n(And
    no, medium caps are not common.)"

  body: "Yes; the colour does go a bit off when the sizes change, but I think that's
    less noticeable than full-size abbreviations jarring the eye.\r\n\r\nNot sure
    I have the medium weight, there was certainly a semibold at work; I'll have to
    check. Thanks.\r\n\r\nI'll consider putting Medium caps in any text fonts I design.
    I'd say they'd be more useful than small caps for certain type styles."

  body: "Yes, that solution works very well. In 11 pt regular, 10pt medium caps worked
    ok for those abbreviations, which were an appropriate size and kept the colour
    almost exactly right.\r\n\r\nI suspect there are no rules on mid caps above what
    fits with a particular typeface? Three questions:\r\n\r\n- Has anyone here ever
    needed/used mid caps? For what?\r\n\r\n- Would it be a benefit to have small AND
    mid caps in a font? Or just small caps of a nice height (more than lowercase x-height)\r\n\r\n-
    Would mid caps be halfway between the height of small and full caps? Or nearer
    full height?\r\n\r\nThanks ;)"

    is one example of a typeface with multiple small cap sizes.\r\n\r\nA number of
    designs also feature petite caps in addition to small caps; in this case, the
    small caps are noticeably larger than lowercase x-height, while the petite caps
    are x-height.\r\n\r\nI can see that different small cap sizes may be preferable
    for different uses the small caps are put into (acronyms in running text, caps
    with small caps, all small caps...), but I generally prefer small caps that are
    significantly larger than x-height."
