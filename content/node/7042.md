  body: ' Eyesaw became Fontomas &#40;fontomas.com&#41;. Just recently, Fontomas &#40;fontomas.com&#41;
    offered a free font every week but if you didn&#39;t go, you missed the free fonts.
    No archives to download. They have collected 52 fonts and are going to be offering
    a compact disc for sale soon. <BR> <BR>they have an archive of eyesaw @ <BR>www.antidot.de/eyesaw/
