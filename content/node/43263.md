  for some of the larger text, e.g. our names. We're doing a jazz/art deco theme with
  a peacock motif throughout and I like Zanzibar for it's movement. I'd like to use
  a font reminiscent of the 1920s era that will be highly legible when letter pressed,
  probably a sans, (and is not too over the top) for additional information on the
  invites. Any suggestions on what would compliment Zanzibar best and still get the
  feel across?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n"

    but are: Verlag, Neutraface, Metro, Proxima Nova viable for you? maybe these are
    too late period for your project?'

  body: "i love all of those! i'm just concerned about the pairing. it's difficult
    to tell without being able to test them out before i buy, and i tend to get overly
    analytic (sometimes to a fault) when it comes to pairing. i love Verlag and Neutraface
    and i think they're clean enough to work. \r\n\r\nthanks for the suggestions!"

  body: "one last questions, if you don't mind...\r\n\r\ni'm looking at Verlag (H
    & F-J are one of my faves), but my problem is condensed or not? Fountain's Zanzibar
    is so open, would it be better complimented by the more open style of Verlag or
    the condensed style, to keep it [Zanzibar] in check so to speak?\r\n\r\nthanks
    again!"

  body: Without being able to test I'd guess you should use the normal width, but
    perhaps you could use the condensed width for details?
