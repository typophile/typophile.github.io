  unicode characters for the different typographic spacings like EN space, EM space,
  thin, thick, mid, hair, etc.\r\n\r\nI was wondering why, I don't really mind adding
  these myself but it's still annoying since my DTP app does not have this layout
  feature.\r\n\r\nSo is it: \r\n-Lazyness?\r\n-Practical reasons?\r\n-Historical reasons?\r\n\r\nI'd
  like your knowledgeable input on that. :) \r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "Since regular old PostScript Type 1 fonts only had one space, and three dahes
    - hyphen, en dash, and em dash - when building OpenType fonts, it was not immediately
    apparent that one could add a dozen space and dash glyphs which already had Unicode
    indices. (At least, that's how it was for me; my last three releases have all
    of the spaces (and dashes) you mention.) There are so many great and sexy glyphs
    one can add to one's fonts, that one might overlook the basic and useful ones.\r\n\r\nSo,
    the answer to you question is probably ignorance due to historical precedent.
    Practically, there is absolutely no problem adding the extra glyphs, and it takes
    mere seconds, so laziness is no excuse."

  body: "Although one could put such things in the font, unless your DTP app is smart
    enough to know that they are spaces, it will treat them all as non-breaking.\r\n\r\nIf
    the DTP app is smart enough to know they're spaces, it's smart enough to just
    use those codepoints as control characters and not require them to be present
    in the font. It's not like they vary from font to font, anyway.\r\n\r\nI disagree
    with Chester's comments - we were well aware that there were these extra spaces,
    and I was arguing for putting them in Adobe OpenType fonts back in the late '90s,
    but I got outvoted for the reasons listed above.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"
