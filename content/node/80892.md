  matter.\r\n\r\nI have amassed a good array of facts, arguments and analogies over
  the years (though I always welcome more). What I\u2019m really looking for are some
  good anecdotes about clients questioning the value of typography and fonts, and
  the dialogue you had with them. Is this a frequent or perennial problem for you?\r\n\r\nTo
  be quoted in the article it would be helpful for me to have your real name, and
  where you are based.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT\r\n"

    design - although things are better than they used to be, thanks in large part
    to more media coverage of the craft.\r\n\r\nOne question before I start formally
    mining my memory: when you say \"clients\", are you excluding retail customers?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    like someone''s secretary threw it together in MS Word. One reason Apple''s stores
    looks so good is the careful and consistent application of Myriad. But Kmart''s
    careless mashup of Helvetica, Gill, News Gothic, and Gotham looks like, well,
    Kmart. '

  body: "I can offer a story that might be colorful enough to possibly be worth including
    in your article - it involves a client waffling on the purchase of fonts. It was
    1992 and I was among a rare breed of designer who had been successfully producing
    non-Latin fonts for the only low-cost video titling platform back then, the Amiga
    computer. One of my almost-clients was the main Iranian television channel in
    Los Angeles; they had been negotiating with me for my set of Arabic/Farsi video
    fonts for months. In November of that year I decided to move to Barcelona, so
    I called up Bahram and said \"You might want to buy the fonts now, since I don't
    know if/when I'm coming back...\" (which was actually true). In two days he came
    up with the $2000 cash; this was after all before the Internet age. In fact along
    with some other clients in the same position, he helped finance my 6-month stay
    in Spain! But then I ended up back in LA, to see my work on TV at any time of
    day* but also to realize that it was becoming more difficult to sell *quality*
    to clients, since many more people -some of them living in countries which much
    lower costs of living- were starting to make fonts...\r\n\r\n* http://themicrofoundry.com/s_multimedia.html\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    cannot not communicate.\r\n\r\nIf a client doesn't care about how they communicate,
    including typographically, then they communicate that they don't care."

  body: "I'm in my early days of freelance working and I always rely on a strong and
    solid typographic basis for my works, this is why most of the time they are rejected
    by clients who prefer something fancy and colourful. And my clients are instutions,
    e.g. Italian Minister for Equal Opportunities, A.C.I. (Azione Cattolica Italiana,
    a catholic-related organisation).\r\nThere's a general urge for something that
    shouts the communication as louder as possible, confusing accessibility and clarity
    with mere visual pollution.\r\nAnd I'm also noticing this is deeply related with
    the client's culture and cultural target.\r\nI think a fine client will give me
    the time to explain why a solid typography is important. And he will eventually
    understand it (or he'd maybe understand me without explaining it all).\r\n"

    as a practical matter I think it's more a factor of 1) picking the right clients
    (companies with reasonable budgets and who realize the importance of good design),
    and 2) developing a good professional relationship with them so they trust your
    recommendations.\r\n\r\n"
