  Incredibles. Not the font in the credits but the one used in the movie: side of
  equipment, buildings, interfaces, etc.  It's a wide square font but I can't find
  any reference to it anywhere online.  Maybe it's just a custom font.  This is the
  best example I could find online. \r\n\r\n[[http://www.tuaw.com/media/2006/02/incrediblesapple.jpg]].\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any leads.\r\n\r\nMatt"
