body: "Hi there, \r\n\r\nI am looking for sources and suggestions on creating a font
  consisting custom icons. It will be for an e-commerce web site. Approx. 30, site
  specific artworks have to be drawn and executed as a webfont. The icon webfont seems
  a clear solution for the developers who think to use the full advantage of a leaner
  CSS. \r\n\r\n I am using Fontforge since I have started to draw my own projects
  with it. But I just can't make any sense on the baseline for artworks. The glyph
  proportions and icon proportions seem to differ greatly. \r\n\r\nAny suggestions
  or threads directing me to a solution are highly appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAyse\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "When looking to hire a web design company to either create a website from
    scratch or to fix up an existing site that you may have, it is important to find
    a reputable one who isn't going to disappear a year down the track. You want to
    hire a web design company that is reliable, professional, has a good track record
    and, most importantly, is going to give you the website that you want. But how
    do you find one?\r\nFirst, do your research. Use a search engine to look for web
    design companies in your area. Ask people you know who have websites what their
    experience was like with their design company. As well as giving you an idea of
    who to ask, speaking to people will also give you a fairly good idea of who to
    steer clear from. Don't pursue companies that are from out of the country or even
    interstate - if you have to go in for a meeting at some stage, the distance makes
    the whole process difficult.\r\n"

  body: "I haven\u2019t seen a thread that deals with this, but here\u2019s my workflow:\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Initial
    symbol sketches.</li>\r\n<li>Get the basic dimensions right in relationship to
    the UPM and the vertical metrics (and the context in which it will be used).</li>\r\n<li>Consider
    the intended size. Symbols needs to be simplified, exaggerated and unitized to
    work at small sizes in low resolution environments. Some \u201Chacking\u201D (and
    by that I mean deviating from a strict pixel grid) is helpful in reducing blur.
    A <a href=\"http://frodehelland.com/icon/\">test page showing a range of sizes</a>
    is helpful in this process.</li>\r\n<li>Study how the various rasterizers interpret
    negative shapes, positive shapes, overshots, diagonals. Keep in mind medium resolution
    displays like Apple\u2019s Retina.</li>\r\n<li>Convert curves to TrueType.</li>\r\n<li>Windows
    dependes on TrueType hinting. In addition to that,  I often find my self correcting
    adjustments done for other platforms (#4) with TrueType hinting. This might be
    the biggest hurdle.</li> (Autohinting does not work well enough for my standards.)\r\n<li>Encoding.
    Encoding an icon as another glyph breaks one of the fundamental rules of the web.
    You should ideally find an equivalent in Unicode, or use the PUA area. What happens
    if someone doesn\u2019t have the font? What will they see then?</li>\r\n<li>Exporting:
    FontSquirrel is helpful in generating correct files, and getting vertical metrics
    right across multiple browsers. If the icon is intended to be displayed large,
    you might want to consider Postscript outlines (go back to #5). FontSquirrel can\u2019t
    handle WOFF\u2019s with Postscript outlines, so then you need to use another tool
    for exporting.</li>\r\n<li>Serving: How heavy are the final files? Too heavy for
    a website? Can I reduce the file size?</li>\r\n</ol>"

  body: "I really appreciated your advice on the workflow Frode! \r\n\r\nThank you
    so much. We did a test page already. I edited the font file saved as .ttf then
    my colleague worked on converting it via fontsquirrel to webfonts then created
    an html sample to display the set. But what struck us were how large pix size
    we need to use for the icons in order to keep the appearance consistent with our
    Photoshop comps. \r\n\r\nImmediately we decided to work in context with our webfonts
    (Proxima Nova Soft) and re-test it with the content blocks from the site.\r\n\r\nI
    will re-iterate and work on the file, applying the steps you recommend.\r\n\r\nThank
    you very much again!\r\n\r\n"
