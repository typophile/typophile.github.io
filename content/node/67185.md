  body: "There's good news and bad news. First, the bad news: These letters are not
    very distinctive ones for the purpose of an ID. The G is almost the only clue,
    if you assume LAS VEGAS is in the same font. The good news is that it would almost
    be hard to tell if you didn't pick the right font from any of a list that would
    be similar for these letters.\r\n\r\nBased on the G, here are five candidates:
    Calibri, Corbel, Frutiger, FF Plus and Stag Sans.\r\n\r\nI started making test
    drives of VENETIAN/PALAZZO to see if any of these drop out, and the first two
    seem potential still. I just don't think this shows enough to rule out much, unless
    the I has serifs.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
