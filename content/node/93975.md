body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\n   I'm working on an auto-kerning tool.  It's free and open
  source.  If you're interested in taking a look, I'd love to hear your feedback.
  \ \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://charlesmchen.github.com/typefacet/topics/autokern/index.html\">TypeFacet
  Autokern Project Pages</a>\r\n\r\n   As a demonstration, I've used Autokern to re-kern
  two popular open source fonts: League Gothic and Linden Hill (both from the League
  of Type).  Here are direct links to before-and-after comparisons:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://charlesmchen.github.com/typefacet/topics/autokern/league_gothic/sample_texts.html\">League
  Gothic</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://charlesmchen.github.com/typefacet/topics/autokern/linden_hill/sample_texts.html\">Linden
  Hill</a>\r\n\r\n   I took the fonts' original kerning as a point of departure when
  configuring Autokern.\r\n\r\n"

    to get the proper dependencies, e.g. libyaml &  pyyaml installed.\r\n\r\n1. Change

    one)\r\n<code>export PYTHONPATH=\"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages:/usr/local/lib/python:$PYTHONPATH\"</code>\r\n\r\n3.
    Install cmake for build systems and libyaml for reading configuration files:\r\n\r\n<code>brew
    install cmake libyaml --universal</code>\r\n\r\n4. Install pip, which is a package
    manager for Python, using easy_install:\r\n\r\n<code>sudo easy_install pip</code>\r\n\r\n5.Install
    PyYaml, the python interface to libyaml:\r\n\r\n<code>sudo pip install pyyaml</code>\r\n\r\n6.

    potentially very usefull for pre- manual spacing. Also potentially good tool for
    primary stages of font development to space glyphs in order to aid the optical
    widths etc of new glyphs and the emerging face. Certainly better than other auto

    the ability to set up non-kerning control pairs. So, for instance, if one assumes
    that the sidebearings of H are correctly set, then there should never be kerning
    between HH, so that distance provides a control value for kerning. For each script,
    the user of the tool should be able to define the control glyphs between which
    no kerning should be applied and which provide the distance model for kerning

    be, e.g. with a sans face, the left side of the 'H' 'B' 'D' 'E' 'F' etc are same(-ish),
    and all the bowls are same-ish, etc etc. Then i can run that .ufo through Typefacet,
    to kern only, and setting parameters to ignore certain pairs and/or glyphs. Like
    you say, by that point i know that e.g. the H-H etc should not be kerned, but
    i do know that e.g. the L-T will, or that an array of lowercase glyphs will need
    kerning to the right side of some uppercase glyphs. Of course this sort of routine
    would be sooo much easier when classes are introduced, and the user can exempt
    e.g. all glyphs in the 'H-left side' class, or kern only 'T' 'W' 'V' against a
    'lowercase left sided bowl' class, i.e. 'c' 'd' 'e' 'o' 'q', or similar. A function
    that defined glyphs (or just left or right bearings of glyphs), or the space between
    certain pairs,  as 'controls' would be very handy. Good point!"

    tools like this one and DTL KernMaster offer parametric controls of the algorithm,

    the person who created the algorithm: a user has to work by trial and error, not
    really understanding how varying different parameters affects outcomes. Type designers
    spacing type don't think in terms of parameters, but of iteratively refining spacing
    and kerning relative to standard distances established by key shapes. Ergo, it
    seems to me that a good autokern tool should try to find a way to make such distances
    a kind of front-end UI to the algorithm parameters."

    in which every glyph is equidistant from its neighbour, at the closest proximity.

    kerning obviously requires high standards, skill, and a lot of work. But the high

    they deliver themselves ;p  Also, i never see the point of individuals just lamely

    trying things out, making mistakes, crossing borders, are all valuable exercises
    (for those who do it, and more so for those who may eventually benefit from it).
    Conversely, trotting about on some high horse is rarely good exercise.  Auto-tools
    can be very usefull and creative parts of a design process, so new tools and new
    methods of automation should allways be encouraged and criticised positively.

    will always rely on your conditioning, I reckon, because everything we do with
    type is relative to models which we learned to interpret. As David Kindersley
    stated in <em>Optical letter spacing</em> (London, 1976 | p.35): \u2018<em>It
    is a commonplace that we see only what we know [\u2026]</em>\u2019.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Elasmosaurus_Cope_Typophile_3593.jpg]\r\n\r\nIn
    the nineteenth century the palaeontologist Edward Drinker Cope reconstructed an
    Elasmosaurus and he erroneously placed the head on the tail (see illustration
    above). The tail turned out to be shorter than the neck and obviously for Cope
    this was an unexpected proportional relationship of the two body parts. \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The

    to the anatomy of the things perceived. In <em>Art and Illusion</em> (Oxford,
    1987 | p.255) Gombrich notes on this phenomenon: \u2018<em>The stimulus patterns
    on the retina are not alone in determining our picture of the visual world. Its

    paleontology, archeology, et cetera, because most knowledge presented is the result
    of reconstructions. Also the technical descriptions on the working methods of
    the early Renaissance punch cutters as described so far, are merely based on nothing
    more than assumptions and projections of the scarce seventeenth- and eighteenth-century
    treatises, like Moxon\u2019s and Fournier\u2019s. \r\n\r\nCharles: \u2018<em>I

    one of Nick\u2019s fonts, probably <em>Pratt Pro</em>, and I will objectively
    test whether arti\uFB01ally spacing and kerning generated in a couple of nanoseconds
    can compete with his manual, intuitive operation, which is performed deep within
    a zone where the designer communes with the spatiality of the typeface. I will

    of kerning.</em>\u2019\r\n\r\nIt will not come as a surprise when I totally disagree
    with this statement. Kerning is a re\uFB01nement of the spacing and the spacing
    comes forth from / is part of the design. \r\n\r\nEvery type design has an optimal
    spacing, which \u2013if the design has been made properly\u2013 results in an
    even stem-interval combined with uniform spaces between and within the letterforms.
    If the type design was originally made for text purposes, the spacing can be made
    somewhat more compact for display purposes, but this will hamper the stem-interval
    a bit (when one looks at Renaissance type, then for instance in Garamont\u2019s
    <em>Parangon Romain</em> the serifs seem to be longer than in the French Master\u2019s
    <em>Gros Canon Romain</em>, so the serifs probably were used as wedges [and as
    indicators for the casters for the setting of the \uFB01xed mould-registers],
    and their lengths were relative to the \u2018point size\u2019).\r\n\r\nTaking
    into account that kerning is relative to the design, I expect that the output
    by <em>Kernus/KernMaster</em> will not differ too much from your \u2018manual\u2019
    kerning. Of course, there can be some discussion about how tight one kerns combinations
    like \u2018Ty\u2019, and perhaps also about the kerning of some punctuation marks,
    but I expect that overall the results of both approaches will be quite similar.\r\n\r\nAt
    the TypoTechnica 2007 conference in Frankfurt Miguel Sousa and I compared the
    kerning of <em>Hypatia</em> with the one that was generated on the \uFB02y by
    <em>KernMaster</em>. Miguel was impressed by the fact that the arti\uFB01cial
    kerning-values came quite close to the ones he generated. (This reminds me of
    the nice duo-presentation we gave at the ATypI conference in Brighton in 2008,
    in which we compared the <em>FontLab Studio</em> / <em>AFDKO</em> based work\uFB02ow
    at Adobe with the <em>FontMaster</em> based work\uFB02ow at DTL \u2013but that

    and unequally balanced glyphs get the 'correct' ratio of side bearing values.
    Other autospacers aren't allways that sensible. It's not the final spacing, and
    i will manually adjust some values, but it's doing a pretty good job, and the
    optical values of 'the usual' kerning pairs look ready for kerning later (auto

  body: "I had a look at it, but briefly, because I quit immediately I came across
    the philosophical proposition that the technocrats are wont to argue: <em>\u2026that\u2019s
    all the brain is: a machine.</em> \r\n\r\nThere are many arguments against this,
    but the one I will mention here is that, from an historiographical perspective,
    culture can be seen to evolve as a progressive dialectic between the tendencies
    of art and science, with whatever the one creates being questioned by the other.
    \r\n\r\nArt says: OK, science, technology and capitalism, you\u2019ve standardized
    and commodi\uFB01ed That, but we decline to use your tools as you intended\u2014so
    suck on This!\r\nAnd Science says: Shape up, you wayward Mess of biology and culture;
    we are on the threshold of discovering your hidden mechanism and Making It Work.\r\n\r\nAnd
    so it goes, so it goes, so it goes, and where it\u2019s going no one knows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    intermediate value for flare serifs, and maybe a higher-than-normal value for
    slab serifs. But I don't know how your code is written to use that variable.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: For slabs you can use "serif" settings, and for flare serifs you can use "sans"
    settings, and play with the "global adjust" value.
