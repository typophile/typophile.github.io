    work.

  body: "I think you are correct Bob. I have been collecting interesting ampersands
    for years and I don't have this one.\r\nBut there are now many well styled fonts
    that would harmonize with this ampersand, so I will keep an open mind.\r\nBTW,
    I like the design. Worth including in an appropriate swashed Roman with similar
    terminals.\r\nDon"

  body: "Unfortunately, when the image is corrected for rotation, skew and perspective
    it looses some of its extravagant swash and is not quite so dramatic\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AmpersandElegantSerifTypophile120272correctedSM_5030.jpg]\r\nBut
    its still a nice design.\r\nDon"

  body: "So, do either of you have a suggestion as to what the base font might be
    (I suspect it's a custom creation, but it has to be based on something)?\r\n\r\nAfter
    editing out the swash, Seravee is the only near match that I could get (and it
    only comes somewhat close):\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/stawix/seravee/"
