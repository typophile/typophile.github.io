  My old logo was good but I felt it didn't represent me and my brother properly so
  I've re-designed a completely new one.\r\n\r\nI wanted something simple, to the
  point and typographic. There are two people involved with the portfolio and the
  split in the middle O represents this. I've kerned it as best I could but sometimes
  you just need fresh eyes to make sure every things proper and my brains numb from
  thinking of ways I could improve it.\r\n\r\nhttp://masonio.com/temp/masonio.jpg\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your help!"

  body: "I like the idea of the two \"half-names\" meeting in the \"O\" \u2013 a whole
    made up of two halves, very fitting. And it looks yummy. But \u2013and maybe this
    is just me\u2013 conceptually I find the \"cracked\" \"O\" a bit disturbing. It
    can easily read as a perfect whole (that circular \"O\") being broken/split, and
    not quite fitting together.\r\n\r\nHave you tried other treatments without the
    offset in the \"O\", but with different treatments of the two \"halves\"? Like,
    dunno, having \"MAS + half an O\" black on white, and the other half of the wordmark
    reversed out of black? Or maybe try using two different fonts (for your different
    personalities) that would however smoothly \"fuse\" in the \"O\"? Like maybe a
    sans and a slab that share the same proportions.\r\nThat way the \"O\" could become
    an image for your common, shared \"focus\", rather than the fault line between
    two slightly incompatible parts.\r\n\r\nJust my $.02. I don't think it <em>doesn't</em>
    work \u2013 I just wonder if it's the solution that best communicates what you
    need it to communicate."

    shape to the split 'O' I also took Altaria's advice to try something different,
    so I added something more \"ying/yang.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://www.masonio.com/temp/logolargeword.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\nwww.masonio.com\r\nwww.behance.net/lucapaulina\r\nwww.twitter.com/masonio"

  body: "A couple of thoughts. \r\n\r\nHave you tried cutting the O at a different
    angle to match what's already in the letters ? I mean this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/masonio_4582.png]\r\n\r\nThe
    ying/yang version is very nice too, I'd try hollowing out the red part instead
    of painting it differently, see if that's any good. Or even removing it altogether,
    the O should still remain legible."

    thing (see <a href=\"http://www.logodesignlove.com/images/simple-logos/mother-and-child-logo.gif\">here</a>),
    but I don't think that has to be a problem. In any case it's much more \xABone
    whole\xBB now, rather than two halves.\r\nI'd maybe try making the ampersand a
    bit larger and/or bolder, so that it works even better doubling as the counterspace."

    icon set for my new site. I''ve kerned the letters out a tad, you can see the
    logo on the brand new Masonio website www.masonio.com the website is around 90%
    done with a few tweaks left to do like the about page, your the first guys to
    see it though :) With the website were trying to bring the qualities of print
    to a clean and simple web design.'

    to be of clean, simple and print qualities. The gradient immediately takes me
    away from any sort of association with printed matter. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, all
    the multicolored text elements (especially the twitter section), pictures, and
    subheads grab for my attention. Your hierarchy of elements on the page needs to
    be explored further.\r\n\r\nYou're not far off, but you're not quite there yet

  body: "It's a lot clearer \u2014 I like it.\r\n\r\nI see a few things that might
    benefit from some tweaking:\r\n\r\n-the body text for each of the posts is red
    . . . all of the text everywhere is red. It might work better if the body text
    was a grey, or whatever one of your secondary colors is, to set it apart further
    from the headline.\r\n \r\n-that twitter section is a bit heavy. I don't really
    want to go over and read through that chunk of text. I would put only the most
    recent 'tweet' over there and then let people click through to your twitter page
    if they'd like to read more. Either that, or give each post more white space.\r\n
    \r\n-Something about the logo has been bothering me, and I think it's because
    of the drop shadow you have on it. What would it look like without that?\r\n\r\n\r\n-\r\npenn"
