  aesthetic standpoint, the ogonek seems less like a grafted on diacritic and more
  like the kind of thing that requires integration into a modified glyph. I'm working
  on a full set of central European diacritics, and the ogonek is giving me headaches.<!--break-->\r\n\r\nSince
  the ogonek is connected to its parent glyph (rather than keeping its distance like
  most other diacritics), does the design and size of the ogonek remain consistent
  between characters, or should it and its, um, host character be tweaked a bit to
  better fit the differences between, say, an \"<strong>E</strong>\" and a \"<strong>u</strong>\"?"
