<div class=commentbody>The holy trinity of black-red-and white jst seems like too easy of a solution to me. I think that there is too much associated with that combination, especially amoung designers (who would be your target audience as a seller of type, no?). <br> <br>The colors, with the beautiful intricate forms of your drawings/letters, just cry out "goth" to me. Not that there is anything wrong with that, mind you. It just seems that you will be more likely to speaking to a different audience. <br> <br>Its always hard for me to settle on the right color combinations, so I really can't offer any great advice. A professor of mine once told me that all the color combinations that we need can be found in nature. Another told me once to work with three colors, two of which should be close to each other in hue and value, and then the third could be a compliment or a split-compliment.</div>

I love that color combo, but for you i think black,green & yellow might be great or black, white and green. i suggest green cuz i think the vines would look great in green against the black. </div>

<div class=commentbody>It's beautiful. I favor this color scheme (Although, I think this design would work successfully with many other colors)...My initial reaction was that this is a European designer with Asian influence. If that perception is shared by many others, then it offers a lot of breadth. <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Really nice look - very classy. Just the dragon (wyvern?) makes it too close to Storm's stuff. As for the colors, try this: make the red a burgundy (add a touch of blue), and give the white a sepia tint. Hey, wait a second, those are <i>my</i> foundry's colors! :-/ <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I love the design, but tend to agree that the colour scheme needs resolving. The current colour scheme does cause tension, but just experiment some more and possibly post us some more results. I tend to react badly to red on black.

<div class=commentbody>totally agree with scott. colors spoke "asian" to me as well. one thing about the red. maybe it should be brighter and little less cyan. looks like you are around pantone 201 ... maybe try something like 1805 or 1807? this is beautiful, i'm only suggesting.

<div class=commentbody>I love the split-stroke typeface, which I presume is one of your own. Design looks great, it's a very indulgent and lush look, which is certainly complemented by the dramatic colour choice. <br> <br>Have you considered replacing the white with a metallic foil for business cards? A gold or silver foil would further heighten the impact of the design and visually offset the complex tracery of either design. <br> <br>PS</div>

<div class=commentbody>They are both just fantastic. I love the colour scheme. I have two comments though. <br>The truncated paws and hand holding a torch <br>looks a bit like cut out tapestry. It feels <br>like something's missing to me. I would get <br>rid of it and replace it with the floral pattern. <br>On the second logo, the dragon is beautifully merged with the K. Just superb work.

<div class=commentbody>I really like the intricate way you have woven everything together. Detail seems to be a lost art. <br> <br>I think another solution to your color issue might be limiting where you use the red. Use the red as the extra punch and not the main show. Looks good though!</div>

<div class=commentbody>The design is gorgeous, but will all of those little filigrees survive at actual business card size? <br> <br>This would make an incredible poster for sure. <br> <br>When I looked at the reds, they looked like a gradation from a dark blood red, to a more vibrant red. I assume this is an optical illusion, but I like the effect, regardless. <br> <br>I'd also recommend trying some variations, such as a striking sky blue, or a rich, mossy green with the same value as the red. The red/black/white combination is one of my favorites too, but I could see a 'goth' interpretation of what you currently have (even though I didn't take it that way). Perhaps a nice, rich rust color would give a wrought-iron feel to the scroll-work. Could be nice.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I also saw tonal variation as a result of line weight, an effect which might be magnified at small sizes. <br> <br>Another idea which would look very elegant (but perhaps a bit too subdued) is to emboss/deboss the graphic area and apply glossy spot varnish to those areas. Especially if you use a nicely textured stock, it could turn out very nice.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Very sophisticated and elegant- my favourite thing about it is the way the ornament weaves through the typography with such grace- it is poetic. I haven't seen that degree of finesse and craft in a typographic solution in a long time. Deboss, emboss only if you can find a printer that can match the finesse and intricacy of your design.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Wow-wee! Thanks for all the super+ feedback! I'll answer <br>a few questions first: <br> <br>The images are indeed stock, from the Pepin Press book <br>called "Signs & Symbols." I didn't reply for so long because <br>I was awaitng confirmation on whether I could legally use <br>the images. As it turns out, I can. However, it was always <br>my intention to modify them. <br> <br>I agree about the paw holding <br>the torch, it looked off from the beginning. I love all the <br>suggestions about ebossing, foil stamping etc. When I get <br>the squids together I shall investigate this seriously. At the <br>moment, I will have to gang up on another print job, which <br>is one colour, a black purple. See the attached image for <br>colour and new filigree. The rest of the type is Jenson Pro, <br>which I found tucked away inside Indy CS. Is it too much? <br> <br>As for the dragonbirdthing, I have been playing with the <br>idea of paying a subtle homage to our native bird, the <br>Kiwi. It is a flightless endangered beauty and the de <br>facto icon for New Zealand, pretty much why we get <br>called kiwi's. So here it is on my logotype. Does it work <br>any better? I am in the middle of vectorising the thing. <br>Quite tricky. The split-stroke type is my own. Hopefully <br>released one day as well. Thanks for all the feedback. <br> <br>Regards, kris. <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/34966.gif alt> <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/34967.gif alt></div>

<div class=commentbody>kris your work is very elegant. As for the colours i would recommend to make the combination it suits you best and don't get confused with afterthoughts like "will it communicate with everybody?", since your work and taste already is not concerning "everybody". <br> <br>Personaly i prefer the black-red-white variation mainly for the reason that the "KLIM" is not messing with the pattern (as i think it happens in the last two variations). <br> <br>Also i think you sould "liberate" the "Type & Graphic Design" and "Mobile..." lines from the block. The compination with the leaves doesn't work as it does with the "KLIM". Further i believe you should avoid the "stop" of the block that puts a "wall" in front of the leaves. I would advise you to put the lines in an order that follows the rythm of the leaves as the typography is not foreign to the nature but it is inspired from it. <br> <br>thanx for the nice design and hope that the dotted line around the card it is not the croping line and it will be print. <br> <br>christos</div>

Can't decide which one I like best between the dark and light versions. <br> <br>I agree with Christos and would take your title and mobile numbers out of the block, maybe on border somewhere and using the lighter shade of the dark so as not to distract attention from the center. It will be dithered though. <br> <br>The bird on the other hand has morphed into some kind of weird gryphon. It doesn't remind me a kiwi for sure with those huge wings. I think you should either stick with the dragon theme or go with the softer more lyre bird look. In that case the wings seem too predatory. I'm nit picking of course. Great stuff. <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I prefer the darker version. But agree that the mobile number and also the top text is compramising the design. <br> <br>The text is optically squaring off the design, detracting from the elegance. Because the vines force the eye straight into your name. A memorable name. <br> <br>Title and mobile # should not compete with your name. In this example anyway. <br> <br>Love it! <br> <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>It doesn't look like clip art to me. One of the things that make graphic designers great, especially in our day, is their ability to apply and arrange "existing" elements in ways that convey specific messages. I used to be radically opposed to using stock imagery, but I have changed my position after seeing such imagery masterfully manipulated in successful designs. I say, as long as you do something to make it your own, it's OK. <br> <br>Aloha! <br>Scott</div>

I wish I could tell you something useful to change, but really... this is the best thing I've seen in the typophile design forum, ever. <br> <br>The red/black/white combo is not a problem, in my mind. It becomes what the designer makes of it, if the design is strong enough, which yours definitely is. <br> <br>And it's not "goth" until you either add some blackletter or a picture of a pale woman with tuberculosis looking like she's about to faint. <br> <br>The gryphon is a traditional heraldic beast associated with printers. </div>

<div class=commentbody>I would suggest (for an eventual future reprint) to try using a black stock with aopaque white and the red overprinted (or maybe both colors foil stamped would be even better). I did a business card once that relayed on a large mass of black similar to yours, and I found that the black printed on white stock was never rich enough. Also, the type dosen't feel the same when it is simply a hole in an ink-covered page. <br> <br>This is a beautiful project and I hope that you will have the chance to print it with an outstanding printer!</div>

<div class=commentbody>Foil on black works well, but best to do a test first. I think foil would be best for this situation as it is extremly opaque. <br> <br>I was wondering about the trapping issue related to the white and red inks as well when I wrote the post. If the red were spread out things would probably work. The black should cover up a slight overflow of the red. If someone knows a lot about trapping (certainly not me) I hope that they could sound in on this. <br> <br>A really excellent printer could probably do it kiss-fit, but those printers are few and far between.
