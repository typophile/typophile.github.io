body: "Here's my latest project for myself. I saw [[Morris Fuller Benton|Benton]]'s
  Sterling and loved it and wanted to do a custom digitization, tweaking some things
  that I didn't like so much. So far all I have are the Capitals. In digitizing, I
  wated to try my hand at that fascinating [[M-formula|faceting]] stuff. Eventually
  I'd like to expand this to a range of weights and optical sizes, but it's kind of
  slow going thus far. Anyhow, have a look. Let me know what you think so far.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/howardpdh042806_4222.gif]"

  body: "At first glance, it looks quite promising.  I wonder if the faceting has
    been applied consistantly enough? The curve of the P is smoothe but the serifs
    are chunked.\r\nThe F, V, and T also seem a bit too wide.  You might also look
    at the lower horizontal of the P, it seems to join too straight compared to top.\r\n\r\nI
    will give it a longer look later.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    \ Perhaps something more in the vein of Jenson or a hand-tooled look would lend
    itself to it?\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: I think it has promise too. I wonder if you should exaggerate the facets to
    begin with (text weight) and slowly diminish them (display) to better understand
    what effect they are having. Either way, if you are going to facet exaggerating
    them would be more fun.
