body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI am laying out a book for a client and in the templates I received,
  I found that a tracking of -2 (Quark) had been applied to the body text (12 on 15pt
  Congress Sans).\r\n\r\nNow, the client insists that this is proper, but I usually
  never use tracking, as this messes up the careful spacing of the original font designer.\r\n\r\nAny
  opinions? Should I use the tracking or better not?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: It depends if the spacing was good in the first place. -2 would be virtually
    invisible.

  body: A tracking of -2 in Quark is 1%, so it shouldn't be very noticeable. If the
    client is insisting on it, then just leave it be.
