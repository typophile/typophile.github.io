body: "international typographic style:\r\nthis is the design period i did research
  on last semester. i really enjoyed it because of the objective and visual characteristics
  that this period had. the objective for clarity won praise throughout the world,
  hence its name (international), and remained a major typographical style and force
  for nearly 2 decades, and still influences artists today. the visual characteristics
  that i enjoy from this design period are the use of san-serif type in a flush-left
  & ragged-right configurations, objective photography and copy that presented visual
  and verbal information, and a mathematical grid.\r\n\r\nphotography and the modern
  movement:\r\nas a lover of photography, and a photo taking fiend, i truly find inspiration
  from this design period. in modern movements, photography plans right along with
  the concerns of point, line, plane, shape, and texture. playing off of light and
  shadows became the objects in alot of the art work, as well as photos that were
  zoomed into, taken from extreme angles, and photos whose exposure was tweaked. i
  love photography, and this period is right up my alley.\r\n\r\nthe modern movement
  in america; after the war:\r\ni find it very interesting how all the work that was
  done in this design period is all very industrially structured, and i was surprised
  by how colorful the designs are. the painted art pieces were the american army's
  institutional advertising campaign that united fine art, and a simple copy line
  with the cca's (container corporation of america) logo. these advertising campaigns
  were instituted to allude to a bauhaus ideal: the union or art with life. "
