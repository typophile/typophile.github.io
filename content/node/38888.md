  body: "There are some resources on Adrian right here on Typophile, but they are
    mostly type related. Maybe these links will lead you to his studies of forms and
    counterforms. [[http://www.typophile.com/node/12118|Adrian Frutiger]].\r\n\r\nAlso
    this book is in the thread [[http://www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=P0388|Forms
    and Conterforms]]"

  body: Jennie, Adrian Frutiger received the SOTA Typography Award 2 years ago. I'm
    wondering if you might find some photos of his work from the presentation given
    at TypeCon over at the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/typecon/">TypeCon
    Flickr Group</a>.
