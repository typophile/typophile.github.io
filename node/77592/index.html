  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi all, I'm new to the site and have to say I'm totally in love with it.  I've decided to produce a new identity package for myself as it's been about two years since I put together the current one, and it is no longer a fair demonstration of my skills.  The upper font is my own creation, and in branding myself I felt it was a good idea to start with something I've created and move on from there.  Critique away, tear it apart, just keep in mind, I'm a noob to font creation and typography.</div>

I like the design; it's very clever.  If the "g" was viewed by itself I don't think anyone would know it's a bulb, but teamed up with the company name I think it works.

It would be more consistent, though, if the blue "g" was the same orientation in both uses. And in the lower one the company name looks too small relative to the icon.

I passed around a printed version of the blue logo to some friends without the company name and asked them what they saw in it, their response every time was either a light bulb or a number nine.  I'll tweak it some more and see what I come up with.</div>

Some of them probably knew your company name was Brightbulb, so that may have influenced their recognition of it, but perhaps it's more recognizable than I first thought. In any event I think it works. 

And I like the fact that it's not a traditional-looking lightbulb, which I think has been overused as a symbol of creativity. Your approach is fresh.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks, that's pretty much exactly what I was going for.  I've heard before that because light bulbs are so outdated and overused I should completely change the name.  I considered doing just that, but it seemed like such challenge to come up with something new, I felt it was better to just work with what I had.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Try flipping the blue mark upside-down, as a bulb would hang from the ceiling. Then you'd get a 'b' for "brightbulb".
