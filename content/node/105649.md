body: I am looking for a specimen of the Typeface Neue Haas-Grotesk/Helvetica circa
  1968 designed by Hans Neuburg and Nelly Rudin. I need to have high resolution scans
  of the medium/halbfett cut to pursue a personal project on the original Helvetica.  thank
  you in advance[img:sites/default/files/old-images/helvetica_1968_specimen_3636.jpg]
