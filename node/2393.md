body: Hi Everyone. My name is Raja and I have been designing for almost 2 years now.
  I picked up Photoshop 2 years ago and have been using it ever since. I am now trying
  to come to grips with Illustrator as I learn that it is the standard for logo creation.
  <BR> <BR>I received an anonymous email from someone that suggested I could really
  improve my work by having it critiqued here. Having browsed the threads, I am quite
  impressed by the knowledge, talent, experience, and willingness to help of members
  here, that I agree with that person. Anyway, I have temp page up that displays some
  of my logos, what I would like to know is, that if you had to reduce the number
  of logos to approximately 15, to display in your new portfolio, which are some that
  you definitely would remove, and also, which ones would you think should really
  be shocased in your portfolio? <BR> <BR>Any other comments or suggestions are also
  welcome &#40;I know I have a lot to learn when it comes to type&#41; <BR> <BR>Thanks!   <a

    <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll give you a Top 9 and 9 more to get rid of.  <BR>Maybe that helps.
    Just one person&#39;s opinion. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>TOP 9, in no particular order: <BR> <BR>1. Studio

    critiques, but <BR>overall, I&#39;d say you have some good instincts and <BR>a
    good sense of what it takes to craft memorable logos. <BR> <BR>Your use of counters
    will take you far, as long <BR>as you don&#39;t force it. <BR> <BR>There are a
    few instances where the logo could&#39;ve <BR>been helped by a more distinctive
    type treatment. <BR> <BR>&#40;harvey lawncare or select consultants for example&#41;
    <BR> <BR>and some instances where better art would&#39;ve helped. <BR>&#40;angry

    can only help you as <BR>progress as a logo designer. <BR> <BR>there are a lot

  body: 'Good range of work, some really good stuff, some poor and deriatrive, smacking
    of stuff you&#39;d find in an old Graphis book. While most is very solid, it feels
    as if you&#39;ve ripped of stuff from some 80s and 90s anthologies... with some
    exceptions they just don&#39;t feel contemporary. &#40;Maybe because you did them
    some years back???&#41; Still, for what they are they&#39;re pretty sound.  <BR>
    <BR>That said, your work shows a wide range and a very nice sense of graphical
    abstraction, even a strong hint of more simplicity and reduction and s olid eye
    for classic-american logo-style and composition.  Maybe you should broaden your
    range and develop an eye for a more modern approach to brand-identity and for
    more ideographic solutions. That, plus a step away from too classic a typographie,
    a step towards more contemporary fonts, would be nice. <BR> <BR>What I liked:  <BR>Balance

    makes me realize a bad trend in design: Logos for everyone and their dog. I think
    a logogramm once was something for a global company, a major brand that has to
    be recognized internationally or so big that you needed a constructed identity
    to communicate to the masses who you are. Nowadays every small bakery seems to
    have a more or less individual '

    page of the logos that didn&#39;t make the cut. The designs that seem banal from
    a designer&#39;s perspective are also the sort of designs the suits with the big
    money insist on asking for, and it doesn&#39;t hurt to show that if someone is
    looking for a clich

  body: Thanks all for taking the time to have a look and offer comments. Everything
    I read is still sinking in. I&#39;m still a bit humbled after being nosey and
    checking your profiles <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>BJ Harvey, thanks for your shortlist and the
    nice comment. I agree with your top nine to get rid of. However, I feel, at this
    early stage, I need to show some cheesy, cliche designs. The majority of my clientele
    is made up of really small businesses such as teens starting up a &#39;web design
    firm&#39;, local ma and pa&#40;that don&#39;t even have a website&#41;, relatives
    and logo design contest holders. The Norah Jones gig was the result of me just
    simply emailing her and proposing this idea, her management led me on for a bit
    and then never got back to me. Regarding type, I&#39;m just learning how intricate
    and beautiful it is. I started out &#40;2 years ago&#41; designing web pages.
    I found that there was too much you could do, it was overwhelming to start out
    the design process. I started to focus on smaller desgins, banner ads, buttons
    etc. I then fell in love with the challenge of logo designing. One square inch
    to say more than what an entire website could say. Typography is the next level
    IMO. I have no education in design or art, so I may sound absurd. <BR> <BR>HD
    Schellnack, thanks for commenting. I havn&#39;t been designing logos for as long
    as you may think. I havn&#39;t ever worked for someone else or a design firm either.
    A lot of times I&#39;m asked to mimic another design, I hate it, but I do it.
    Since I don&#39;t have enough confidence to raise my design rate, I practically
    take every job and give &#39;em what they want. I know this can open up a whole
    design ethics debate, but I have to do things to make ends meet, for now anyway.
    There are only a couple of designs that are in use that were sort of &#39;ripped&#39;.
    If there are others, then something must be embedded in my subconscious from something
    I have seen before. Other than that, when I have the ball in my court, I stay
    100% original. You are so right about broadening my style to something more modern.
    I just find it hard to be crafty or clever or apply some dichotomy when keeping
    inline with a modern style? I have never really been asked to create a brand.
    &#40;I had to google a lot of the terminology used by you guys.&#41; I agree totaly
    with your off-thread comment and Rodolfo Capeto&#39;s comment. <BR> <BR>Kevin
    Pease, an ambigramist, thanks! I really enjoyed your work. Your right about the
    suits, even though in my case they are known as the track suits, shot callers
    nonetheless, albeit on a deifferent field in my case. Not proud of the K@ logo,
    so, I&#39;m going to remove it, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find another to link to
    though <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"
    BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>Hrant H Papazian, thank you as well. I think Enlargel could
    penetrate into first place if it was made bigger? <BR> <BR>Daniel Poindexter,
    I can burn HostProject and CashGo &#40;ironically the same client&#41; but I&#39;m
    still working on Fitness Wave , it&#39;s progressed since then, AND it&#39;s my
    ex-girlfreind starting up her own fitness club, that one has sentimental value
    for me, for a little while anyway<IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> I even display the first logo I ever designed in my portfolio
    for sentimental reasons. <BR> <BR>Thanks again everyone, I know when I browse
    forums, I tend to not comment when I could have, just being lazy or something.
    This is very appreciated. <BR> <BR>-Relative Rookie
