  york city. it's about as super cheesy as you would expect with a glitzy skyline
  in the background and a big lady liberty....she needs help on choosing a font that
  says 'New York City' literally...and figuratively...\r\n\r\nright now they have
  some awful script font that feels very reminiscent of some early 90's late night
  talk show (especially with all the purple and green). i can hear the saxophones
  in the background already...\r\n\r\nso i need some advice to help her out in picking
  something that says new york city glitz and glamour but not too cheesy and not so
  over the top...maybe something a little more sophisticated like \"The New Yorker\"
  magazine title logo. any help would be appreciated\r\n\r\nw|m"

    remember that being a Bold Grotesque with "light bulbs" in them. Corny, but that's
    what we're looking for here, right?

  body: "Interesting project in stained glass.\r\n\r\nIf it's a collectible, then
    I would focus on target market's preconceived imagery of NYC.\r\n\r\nI humbly
    suggest looking at retro scripts and display designs associated with \"The Great
    White Way\" (no, this is not a racial comment but a reference to the glitzy theatre
    district of NYC).\r\n\r\nFor scripts, look at Kaufmann, Murray Hill and Park Avenue.\r\nFor
    marquee dispay designs look at Binner, Broadway and Rialto.\r\n\r\nAll of these
    are not \"too over the top\" and can be rendered on stained glass without much
    difficulty.\r\n\r\nHope this helps.\r\n\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nYes,

  body: "thanks guys. i was looking at grand central last night and was really thinking
    it would be the best suggestion. (turned out it wasnt, as they are leaning more
    toward the 'retro scripted' look i think) gotham was my second choice but i realized
    it's too representative of how i 'typographically' perceive new york city. my
    typographic perception probably isnt what they are looking for as they are going
    more for the playful and less for the typographically intelligent. gotham is just
    too smart for this piece. \r\n\r\nthe theatre references might be right on the
    mark as well. "

    \"Fonts in Use\" section.\r\n\r\nIt's divided into several sub-categories, alphabetically
    by typeface, by usage, etc.\r\n\r\nOddly enough, you'll find several instances
    of Broadway used for exterior signage in NYC, and one for a retro Art Deco site.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/7-2106-7/byalphabet.html\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/7-1508-7/posterssignpostingcalendars.html\r\n\r\nYour
