  body: That&#39;s pretty interesting, the lettering under the symbol. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve
    never dabbled in such lettering, the kind of stretching of a caricatured Chinese
    calligraphic brushstroke around the latin letterform. <BR> <BR>Of course, there&#39;s
    been, at least during the latter part of the 20th century, a broad range of such
    type styles. Generally used for lower-class &#40;for lack of better english at
    the moment&#41; settings. <BR> <BR>Such lettering has always struck me &#40;as
    an omnicient observer&#41; as a negative caricature. The way the old &#39;Charlie
    Chan&#39; movie character seems to strike so many people today. <BR> <BR>Can any
    Chinese here comment as to how that lettering concept &#40;not its mediocre-looking
    execution&#41; affects you? <BR> <BR>Is it an acceptable caricature? Or is it
    just benign? <BR> <BR>Is it appropriate for such a logo, regardless of who the
    logo might be targeted to? <BR> <BR>Thanks! <BR> <BR>Joe <BR> <BR>

  body: I think the much more interesting and relevant thing is that the logo is also
    a word. The lettering below is &#34;just there&#34; - it isn&#39;t the memorable
    component that will be &#34;burned into people&#39;s consciousness&#34; as the
    article says. <BR> <BR>I guess it makes sense that a logography is better than
    an alphabet for logos! <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    <BR>I&#39;m not Chinese, but as Japanese writing systems are basically derived
    from Chinese, I think I can comment on this. :-&#41; <BR>Well, I don&#39;t appreciate
    the concept of Chinese brushstroke style applied to Latin letterfoms. I think
    of it as a caricature too. The worst thing is that, very often, Chinese/Japanese
    people use this kind of lettering themselves. It&#39;s like &#34;self-caricature&#34;...
    :-/ <BR>This Beijing-2008 lettering is quite acceptable though. The execution,
    I mean. <BR> <BR> <BR>Hrant: <BR>&#62;it makes sense that a logography is better

    that I think I&#39;m not getting what you meant here. ;-&#41; <BR>Anyway, I don&#39;t
    like this Beijing-2008 logo. The lettering is better. I think the &#34;metaphor&#34;
    is too obvious here. There&#39;s no subtlety. The original Chinese ideogram is
    almost unrecognizable. And, in my humble opinion, it could be better executed.'

    <BR> <BR>&#62; I think I&#39;m not getting what you meant here. <BR> <BR>Since
    an alphabet sequences phonetic codes to make a sound that&#39;s a word, the results
    aren&#39;t &#34;elemental&#34; in the way of a logography. <BR> <BR>&#62; The
    original Chinese ideogram is almost unrecognizable. <BR> <BR>Is it possible that
    it&#39;s not a character used in Kanji &#40;Chinese loan to Japanese&#41;, or
    maybe it looks different in Kanji? My computer bag has four Chinese characters
    on it, and I once asked a Chinese, a Japanese and a Korean person to read them
    to me. The Japanese and Korean only got 3 right. <BR> <BR>Try your hand at it!

    away with it if they had done the red part better, but there is no way in hell
    they could&#39;ve gotten away with the chop suey lettering. <BR> <BR>I always
    thought it was only the non-Chinese who would use such Chinese take-out font in
    association with all things Oriental &#40;Chinese, Japanese, Asian, etc&#41; I
    had always put it down to a lack of understanding of the Chinese culture on the
    part of the designers. <BR> <BR>But as I come across more of such designs done
    by Chinese themselves or commissioned by Chinese, I think it has less to do with
    understanding the Chinese culture than understanding design. <BR> <BR>&#62; Can
    any Chinese here comment as to how that lettering concept &#40;not its mediocre-looking

    that the &#34;clients&#34; are Chinese themselves... <BR> <BR>It can&#39;t say
    it&#39;s the brush strokes that broke the lettering, and made it a caricature.
    Because I have <a href="http://www.srt.com.sg/03/html/Productions/forbidden_city.html">here</a>
    a good example of brush stroke lettering. Also used for a Chinese-related subject.

    <BR>when i first read hrant&#39;s post, about the &#34;bastardisation of greek
    language&#34;, i didnt really understand what he meant &#40;i am greek btw, or
    hellenic if you prefer the term&#41; <BR>i saw the light a few minutes later,
    you are probably speaking about the change in our language. We moved from the
    polytonical&#40;many tones&#41; to the monitonical&#40;one tone&#41; system in
    the 1970&#39;s. Let me give a lecture. <BR> <BR>After the greek revolution in
    1821, the newly founded country had to determine it&#39;s ethnicity. So, apart
    from the religion &#40;orthodox&#41;, they came up with a language that was neither
    like ancient greek, nor like the one ppl were speaking back then, but a pompous
    mix of both. This mixture was named &#34;katharevousa&#34; &#40;&#34;pure/clean/clear
    language&#34;&#41; and it was declared official language of Greece. Now, ancient
    greeks only had uppercase letters and had no problems in pronounciation &#40;they
    knew it by heart&#41;&#40;first texts in greek are dated around 1200 b.c.&#41;.
    However, after alexander the great &#40;who conquered, in today&#39;s terms, pretty
    much the whole of greece, egypt, turkey, iraq, iran and went all the way to india
    and that was around 320 b.c.&#41;, the language had to be simplified. I think
    they started developing lowercase around then too. Anyway, to ensure that everybody
    got the pronounciation right, they made 3 different tones and 2 other symbols
    &#40;the exact translation would be spirits - nothing to do with demonology though&#41;
    <BR>One tone to signify that you had to heighten your voice in that syllable,
    another meant that you had to lower your voice, a third meant that the toned vowel
    had to be pronounced twice. <BR>The other 2 symbols had to do with the pronounciation
    of the first letter, if there would be a thick or thin sound of an &#34;h&#34;
    to it &#40;&#34;hercules&#34;, &#34;hypnopaedia&#34;, &#34;hellas&#34; and many
    other h- words are taken from greek and the special &#34;spirit&#34; for a thick
    &#34;h&#34; sound has been replaced by the &#34;h&#34; letter&#41;. These symbols
    also had a use in spelling correctly when creating compound words. <BR>However,
    all this signs no longer serve a cause, because the ancient way of pronouncing
    has been long forgotten &#40;even the byzantines didnt know it&#41;... They only
    served as a helping hand &#40;or not?&#41; in learning and spelling correctly.
    The whole katharevousa thing created a gap between simple folks and writers/official
    texts etc.&#40;they didnt understand it&#41;. They thought that the only way to
    enrich the current language was to fill it with unusable ancient terms - big mistake.
    It was like you had to use 2 different languages, one for everyday speaking and
    the other for writing officially. It was replaced by modern greek once the army
    dictatorship was over, in 1975. Ever since the official language is &#34;modern&#34;
    greek, which has no &#34;spirits&#34; and only one tone, that shows which syllable
    has to be heightened. Oh, and we still use a lot of ancient words &#34;as is&#34;,
    without having to use the weird forms of &#34;katharevousa&#34;. So i really don&#39;t
    know what that &#34;correction process&#34; you are talking about is.'

    unfortunately there are many spelling issues when writing in greeklish - the letters
    are different, sound different etc  <BR>for example we have three letters that
    sound like &#34;i&#34; &#40;they kinda look like i,h,y&#41; however many a times
    they do get replaced by just &#34;i&#34;, so the language really loses it&#39;s

    the ancient way of writing the caps changing to more fixed characters after the

    alphabet dad. Greeks copied most of Phoenicians&#39; letters back in 1500 - 1300
    b.c. or something &#40;adding a lot of characters, especially vowels - the phoenicians
    had none&#41;, and then the romans adapted a special form of the greek alphabet
    which was used in north greece i think, and naturally added some characters, making
    the arithmetic difference... 24 letters in greek, 26 in latin. <BR> <BR>&#40;just
    to clear something up, the phoenicians were an ancient tribe of traders. they
    lived around Israel-Palestine-Jordania&#41; <BR> <BR>i think i&#39;ll stop being

  body: 'Perhaps we need a new Greek type thread? <BR> <BR>The change in fashion of
    Greek type design to which Hrant refers is not intrinsically related to either
    the change from polytonic to monotonic &#40;never complete&#41; or the longer
    history of language change. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Greek graphic designers
    and publishers wanted types that were &#39;modern&#39; and which looked as much
    as possible like the popular Latin types of the time. Linotype, who had a virtual
    monopoly on typesetting systems in Greece, duly provided Greek designs of bestselling
    families like Helvetica, Baskerville and New Century Schoolbook. In all these
    designs, drawn by Matthew Carter, a deliberate effort was made to introduce as
    many Latin forms as possible, and to attach serifs wherever possible &#40;Matthew
    jokes that he was surprised the Greek clients didn&#39;t ask for serifs on Helvetica&#41;.
    The proportions of the letters in these designs derive directly from the Latin
    &#40;themselves constrained by the unit measurements of previous typesetting systems&#41;,
    rather than being tailored to the Greek alphabet and the frequency of letter combinations
    in typical Greek texts. Wherever possible, Greek letters were formed simply by
    adding to, subtracting from or rotating Latin forms; the Helvetica Greek lowercase
    sigma, for example, is simply a latin o with a stick coming out the side. To be
    fair to Matthew and his colleagues at Linotype, who now acknowledge that these
    designs are neither attractive in themselves nor authentically Greek, it is necessary
    to state again that this is what the Greek market wanted. <BR> <BR>In 2001, when
    Linotype asked me to work with them to develop a large &#39;core font&#39; version
    of Helvetica supporting multiple scripts. I suggested that we redesign the Cyrillic
    and Greek from scratch, rather than using Matthew&#39;s 1970s version. Linotype
    deserve a round of applause for agreeing to this and paying for the design of
    a new, more authentic Greek rather than using what they already had. It&#39;s
    still Helvetica, of course, so there is only so much one can do in the way of
    beauty and readability, but I think this comparison illustrates the difference
    in approach to Greek type design as it has changed over the past thirty years:

    <BR> <BR>That was just plain nuts. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>In trying to figure out

    I&#39;ve arrived at the theory that pride in one&#39;s own culture motivates creativity
    in it, but even if it&#39;s justified it inhibits good design in other cultures.

    <BR>It came down to a question of what works: the upsilon desperately needs the
    entry stroke and the curved right side. I could have carried this over to the
    psi, but I didn&#39;t want the whole design becoming too cursive: I wanted to
    maintain some of the rigidity that is a hallmark of Helvetica. The psi works okay
    with the straight sides, and is a much less common letter than upsilon, so I think
    it can afford to carry the rigidity.'

    sigma is for sure one stroked without reversal , and the way to draw it is to
    start making the circle from the highest point at the top and when you finish
    it to draw the horizontal line, all in one stroke &#40;if you start by making
    the line first, you&#39;ll eventually end up making the alternative version&#41;.
