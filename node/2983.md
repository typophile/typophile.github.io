  body: I love Carnase&#39;s calligraphy work. Thanks for the link, Mark, <BR>I didn&#39;t
    know he had a site up. <BR> <BR>BTW, are my eyes bad, or is the Saks Fifth Avenue
    logo poorly  <BR>kerned? I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a Flash rendering issue. I
    ask only  <BR>because I hope I haven&#39;t been looking at my own kerning work
    in  <BR>the wrong way.

  body: The kerning looks off on the Saks site too. Although, the kerning is a secondary
    problem now that it has been stacked and squooshed into that space like a sausage
    into a casing.

  body: There are different philosophies when it comes to spacing, but the FT does
    seem too tight relative to the others. Looks okay to me otherwise. I can imagine
    they must have gone around and around on that.

  body: <i>&#34;Not only that, the bottom of the U is cut off.&#34;</i> <BR> <BR>This
    happened on a project I worked on, a limited-quantity corporate-sponsored wrapper
    for Fortune Magazine. When the Illustrator eps of the Fortune logo was opened
    in Photoshop  the bottoms of the &#34;O&#34; and &#34;U&#34; were cut off. It
    is interesting to see that the same thing happened <a href="%20http://www.carnase.com/flash.html"
    target="_blank"> here</a>, &#40;look in the portfolio section&#41; to the man
    who designed the logo.  <BR> <BR>&#40;OK, is there a way to link to the Fortune
    page? That url is the same as the home page.&#41;

  body: <i>OK, is there a way to link to the Fortune page?</i> <BR> <BR>No. That&#39;s
    one of the drawbacks of doing a website entirely with Flash. Looks cool, but certain
    web things like bookmarking, search, etc. don&#39;t work.

  body: By the way, if you happen to see this within an hour after you posted, you
    might want to click on the little &#34;edit&#34; icon in the upper right hand
    corner of your post and fix your link to Carnase&#39;s site. Looks like you typed
    a space just before the &#34;http...&#34; &#40;After an hour, you can no longer
    go back and edit your post.&#41;

  body: OK, you&#39;ve confused this print designer, just as I was basking in my first
    cleanlink. Does the link work for you? It does for me. <BR> <BR> I went into the
    edit mode, as suggested but  now there is &#34;20%&#34; before the url. I don&#39;t
    see an extra space. Help.

  body: '&#34;%20&#34; is the code for a space character in a URL. Literal space characters
    aren&#39;t allowed in URLs. When you typed the link, you must have put a space
    before the URL. When you posted the message, the space was automatically converted
    to the code &#40;%20&#41;. <BR> <BR>In any case, it&#39;s a good idea to test
    links on the preview screen before hitting the &#34;Post this Message&#34; button. '

  body: 'Mark, I did test my link in the preview, and it worked for me then and it
    works for me now. What I have discovered, though, is that my browser will compensate
    for that extra space. I manually typed in a space and the url and after a very
    short time the space disappeared and the site came up. I will be more careful
    the next time around. BTW, I wondered what that little letter icon was for. Thanks. '
