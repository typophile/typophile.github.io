  anything seriously wrong with these?  The firm is sort of a free-form writing/design
  support operation, configured as a consultancy simply for flexibility.  The home

    about that.

    body: "The \"C\" overlap was an attempt to make the whole thing a little more
      interesting and also to tie \"Creek\" to \"Wolfe\" without losing the single
      defining \"W\" which I really like.  Possibly not as good an idea as I had thought.\r\n\r\nThanks
      for your input,\r\nholzgrafe"

  body: "Welcome in here and thanks for posting.\r\nI think your logo looks like it
    could very well represent the kind of firm you are describing.\r\n  \r\nIs there
    any reason for the \"C\" to overlap the \"W\"? I ask because the curve on the
    \"c\" that tangent the line in the \"W\" do not look to good. If it's not important
    for the design I'd recommend fixing that. Should be easy to fix if you decide
    so."

    the O to recreate the work \"Wolfe\" and increase legibility.\r\n\r\nThat's it!\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------:\r\nJean
