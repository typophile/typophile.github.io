  paving centre, somewhere in the world beginning with g. Have to keep a lid on this
  one, till we launch. I have attached two logo designs, the first, my chosen one.
  The second, the client suggested this idea.\r\n\r\nLet me know your thoughts, which
  works best, if any!\r\n\r\nb"

  body: I read the first one as "goc." Helvetica seems like a non-statement; but of
    course you can't pin the entire identity on the logo. It took me a minute to see
    that you were trying to represent stacked stones with the letterforms. Are you
    going for a modern, clean, feel for the overall identity?

  body: '#1 reads as goc. #2 as gpc but is really ungraceful to my eye. Both call
    to mind Paul Rand''s old [[http://www.logoblog.org/wp-images/paulrand/abc-logo-old.jpg|ABC
    network logo]].'

  body: "goc is what it reads, but when you know it stands for g***** paving centre
    (which will accompany the logo) one will work out the logo then. the modern clean
    look is what i'm hoping to achieve, their will be an earthy/ stony feel to the
    colour  scheme - which adds to the stone services which they provide.\r\n\r\nthe
    gpc (with the obvious descender on the 'p') is quite ugly to the eye. so i hope
    to push the 'goc' which may turn out to be a quirky nickname for the company.. "

  body: "> one will work out the logo then.\r\n\r\nI don't think it can work like
    that.\r\nBetter to have a non-textual logo then.\r\n\r\nJust because your client's
    suggestion was no good doesn't make\r\nyour original suggestion good... Look at
    what the client had to\r\nwork with for inspiration! :-/\r\n\r\nAlso, \"modern
    clean\" isn't what it used to be.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nFrankly this all sounds like
    the typical case of a graphic artist (second word chosen with intent...) making
    a final decision, and showing it off simply hoping that people will cheer, and
    when they don't, ignoring the problem. I do hope I'm wrong though.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Who's the audience? If business, this could work, though I agree that the
    'goc' reading is an issue. If it's for consumers, I don't think this really hits
    the mark.

    to push it further to solve the problem correctly. the problem has not been ignored!\r\n\r\nthe

    here, and that's why I have to have a unwavering dedication to the creative problem
    solving process in order to make sure I get the results I need!\r\n\r\nbefore
    I start a project I go through a cycle kind of like this.\r\n\r\nStrategy, Concept,
    Development, Review, Production.\r\n\r\nStragegy would be knowing you need to
    make a logo, and also knowing what you need to communicate with it.  If you could
    use your logo to communicate 3 words, what would those words be?  How can either
    font choice, layout r imagery help communicate those words?\r\n\r\nConcept would
    be yur sketches, development your computer roughs, review is what you're asking
    for here - a critique of your work, and then production is the final.\r\n\r\nin
    order that we can better help critique your work, can you tell us more about your
    strategy please?"

    building a new yard which will house all their products in several different styles.
    they will be dealing with the general public plus private contractors. i am working
    closely with the landscape designer over the project. he is hoping for a strong
    mark that has a feel of paving whilst keeping it modern.\r\n\r\n\r\ni think the
    client wants to run with the gpc overlapping. "
