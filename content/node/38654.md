  my own type sampler.\r\nSo far I have just used OS X Font Book to manage my fonts,
  but are currently planning to invest in a more professinal FontManager.\r\nAny good
  advise on that subject matter??\r\nMaybe one where you can create PDF files with
  previews of your font collection.\r\n\r\nThanx In Advance"
