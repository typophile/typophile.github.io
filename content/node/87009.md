  article\r\nhttp://www.fastcodesign.com/1665318/the-8-worst-fonts-in-the-world\r\nand
  was upset that he can't see the great merits of the\r\n2012 Olympics font (I do
  NOT mean the logo) but he\r\nhas added insult to injury by using an extremely poor\r\nand
  inaccurate rendering of the font for the sample.\r\nI have a PDF of the font I could
  provide him with,\r\nalthough that certainly wouldn't help his case...\r\n\r\nBTW
  Garfield's email in his bio there is shown as\r\ndummy@email.com... I didn't bother
  trying that.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    A million times as many eyeballs as the book.\r\n- Much easier to fix.\r\n\r\nI
    also pointed Fast Company to this thread.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: The whole article is full of errors. His text is based on generic considerations
    with tons of adjectives and comparisons, but rare arguments. Accuracy is sacrified
    in the name of entertaining text.

  body: "But at least the images should be correct so people can make\r\nup their
    own minds. The rendering he's showing is like a\r\ncubist interpretation of the
    font! It's entirely misleading.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: If Mr Garfield really knew anything about type he would be a. penniless, and
    b. contributing to typophile threads (these are somewhat related). He wouldn't
    be a hugely successful writer. ;-)
