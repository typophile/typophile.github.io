body: "This is my first attempt at tackling a modern font.  It is a somewhat restrained
  display font, and modeled after modern serif typefaces like Didot and Didona.  I
  felt that I would learn more from generating a less decorative font and save the
  creativity for once I grasp the basics.  \r\n\r\n\r\nBefore I bring them into fontlab
  for metrics and kerning, I need to revise the characters.  Some look quite ugly,
  and I have not paid as much attention to counterform as I should have.  I also have
  some other inquires regarding the font:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>1).</strong>
  What characters seem off?  From what I can see, the B, Q, S, g, q, r, &, and * need
  work.  2, 3, 5, and 8 are also imbalanced and need better stroke widths.  Did I
  miss anything?\r\n\r\n<strong>2).</strong> I did not do heavy research into other
  modern serif fonts and I am aware that this is my first typeface.  Is this something
  I should see completely as an exercise? \r\n\r\n<strong>3).</strong> Based on my
  research, the modern serif font is primarily a headline font.  How can I optimize/redo
  what I have in order make it effective at its purpose?\r\n\r\n<strong>4).</strong>
  What are the common pitfalls of creating a typeface that I should be aware of?  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n
  \r\nAny pointers/advice would be extremely helpful.  Thanks!"

  body: I elevated the bar of the A to remain consistent with the other bars, but
    I see now how it is too high.  Agree completely with the P and the Q.
