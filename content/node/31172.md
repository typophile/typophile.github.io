body: "Hi all;\r\n\r\nI'm a product designer going for another degree in graphic/communication
  design. Forgive me if I'm slightly behind the curve -- I'm trying to learn a lot
  at once and am taking it all very seriously. Although I've been working with type/graphics
  for years I am now trying to be more rigorous about my choices. \r\n\r\nI'm working
  on a logo and graphic standards for a small NYC branding firm who does projects
  from very hip to very square (art to corporate). I keep coming back to Sackers Roman
  as a foundation for their logo/ID work. I think it's a beautiful typeface and the
  company does have a sort of eclectic/vintage-meets-modern/cool vibe about them.
  \r\n\r\nMy question is whether there are other typefaces which are not quite so
  'old fashioned' as Sackers -- perhaps a newer typeface that would be more appropriate
  for titling and larger text/words/logo. Or are people of the opinion (and I know
  there are many) that there's a basic elegance to the old faces that trancends the
  vintage signifiers. Bottom line is that I just don't want to be too 'costumey' if
  you know what I mean.\r\n\r\nSecond question, is if I do use Sackers Heavy Roman,
  what is a good companion face for body text? I am imagining something like Trade,
  although again, I wonder if the Sackers/Trade thing is going to make everything
  feel to 'vintage'?\r\nAny thoughts would be appreciated. And please be gentle, I've
  been beaten to a pulp over on DPReview forums for posting as a novice.\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks.\r\nRem."

    I've actually recently paired it with Mrs. Eaves and that is a beautiful combo.\r\n\r\nBeaten
    to a pulp? That isn't right."

      one of the faces I have on my list. I love the Priori family too, although I
      think it might be a bit much to do a Priori Serif / San Serif combo. \r\n\r\nJust
      incidentally, can someone articulate what makes Mrs. Eaves such a lovely face?"

    the italic, but also recognize it's limitations as a text font, due to it's small

  body: Sackers heavy roman as headline text (ie, as in the title of a paragraph -
    set 20pt)-- is it bad form to use another serif font on the same page as body
    copy or a smaller headline? In other words, is Sackers Roman so distinctive that
    it sort of ruins the chance for any other serifs to live on the same page?
