  body: "HA! I looked at the pictures before looking at your name and was like \"Hmm,
    this strangely reminds me of Travis Stearns\". Too funny.\r\nGlad to see you're
    joining the bunch. Welcome.\r\n\r\nI don't know what you think, but I would give
    a little more space between \"RA\" in paradise to compensate for the leg of the
    R. The S is quite interesting as well.\r\n\r\nThese pieces seem a little hard
    to critique without knowing what you're going for though."
