  body: I don&#39;t have the book - but I know that Robin Kinross does. <BR>I think
    you should buy it, then send me copies of the juicy bits.  :-&#62; <BR> <BR>In
    terms of illustrations, the one plate with all the lc glyphs &#40;except the &#34;g&#34;
    - tellingly, since it&#39;s so hard to fit on a grid&#41; is pretty easy to find
    in books - it&#39;s not &#34;complete&#34; though. There&#39;s also a plate of
    the italic in something Smeijers once published, I think. Then I&#39;m having
    this vision of all the UC glyphs in the RdR on facing pages, but I can&#39;t remember
    where I saw that. Sorry. <BR> <BR>Digitizing the RdR would be a great project
    - it&#39;s shocking that there hasn&#39;t been one yet. You might contact the
    Imprimerie Nationale of France for leads, and maybe informal &#34;permission&#34;
    as well. But if they say &#34;no&#34; do it anyway - tell them it belongs to the
    &#34;patrimoine humaine&#34;, not them.  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>hhp

    <BR>It&#39;s impressive that you know Latin though. What kind of accent do you
    have?  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll be missing Prague, unfortunately. Damn shame,
    since it&#39;s my second favorite city in the world &#40;after Barcelona&#41;.
    But if we ever figure out what I&#39;d like to have from the RdR book, I would
    like to make you copies from something I have that you need. Hey, I have a lot
    of stuff about old French type design... in French.  :-&#62; <BR> <BR>-- <BR>
    <BR>BTW, I&#39;ve been looking, and that plate I mentioned can be found in Friedel
    et alia&#39;s &#34;Typography&#34; encyclopedia, under Grandjean &#40;p 254&#41;.
    He even shows a setting of the italic, which is not easy to find. But where I
    saw the <i>plate</i> of the italic still escapes me. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: 'The RdR committee&#39;s engravings &#40;I mistakenly wrote &#34;drawings&#34;
    before&#41; were simply too precise. Without a pantograph it would have been impossible
    to get high fidelity. And then there was the issue of optical scaling you mention:
    it was something Grandjean implemented of course&#42;, but either the committee
    didn&#39;t understand its need &#40;only one of its members had any idea of type&#41;
    or they created the &#34;spirit&#34; and expected Grandjean to &#34;distill&#34;
    it in the smaller sizes &#40;which is not unreasonable&#41;. The way Grandjean
    totally dumped the engraved italic however was not a matter of accuracy though,
    but of taste and practicality. <BR> <BR>&#42; Some people say that -because of
    the &#34;physicality of scale&#34;- the pre-pantographic designers didn&#39;t
    really see optical scaling the way we do, they &#34;just did it&#34;, making each
    size look &#34;correct&#34;. Some however were more sloppy than others - Caslon
    for example was just wanton in terms of consistency &#40;although the variance
    in the italic &#34;Q&#34; is genial&#41;. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>Dan, a question:
    would you make a literal revival, or a mild adaptation? I think if you want this
    to be more than of historical interest, if you want people to use it to give their
    setting the RdR &#34;air&#34; but in a versatile manner, you should take some
    small-to-medium liberties with it. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: 'Dan, over the weekend I did something I should have done much earlier: check
    the wonderful Imprimerie Nationale specimen book of 1990, which shows the bulk
    of their metal collection in great depth and detail. <BR> <BR>First of all, there&#39;s
    a font called Jaugeon &#40;in 12 sizes from 6 to 20&#41; which is basically a
    very close rendering of the original engraved plates, done in the beginning of
    the 20th century. To me it&#39;s very attractive, and actually has a nice dark
    color. The italic is NOT the one shown in the plates&#42; &#40;it doesn&#39;t
    have all those serifs&#41;, but it&#39;s much more rigid and regular than Grandjean&#39;s
    cut. And the italic has some strange features, like a somewhat blackletter-style
    &#34;k&#34;, and get this, it has those short lefthand spikes on the ascenders
    on the &#34;h&#34; and &#34;k&#34; as well as the &#34;el&#34;, not that even
    the &#34;el&#34; needs the spike&#42;&#42; in the italic, since it was there to
    differentiate the lc roman &#34;el&#34; from the cap roman &#34;I&#34;, but in
    the italic that problem is gone! Very strange. <BR> <BR>&#42; And I guess this
    means the RdR had <i>three</i> italics... <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42; BTW, I realize now
    that the claim that Grandjean incorporated the spike of the &#34;el&#34; is bogus,
    since the source engravings have it. <BR> <BR>Then there&#39;s the Grandjean font,
    which was made two centuries earlier, so it seems to be considered the &#34;official&#34;
    RdR font, but besides being too light I think, it&#39;s not nearly as pure, and
    some characters &#40;like the &#34;f&#34; and especially &#34;?&#34;&#41; are
    really malformed. Also, the caps are <i>way</i> too dark, and -as we discussed-
    the italics are very organic and cursive, really way out of character with the
    Roman. The Grandjean however was available in much greater a range, with 19 sizes
    from 7 to 64 &#40;the Jaugeon has no real display cuts&#41; as well as titling
    initials &#40;16 sizes from 12 to 120&#41;. <BR> <BR>In terms of doing a revival,
    I guess you might do one of Jaugeon, but you would really need some kind of IN
    consent there. Or better yet might be doing a revival directly from the plates,
    including the slanted-roman italics. According to what Patrick has shown me there
    has been a metal of that in the past, but certainly no digital. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: This is good info, thank you. I still haven&#39;t gotten my copy of the recent
    Lyon exhibition catalogue from Vendome, and I&#39;ve just come back from a brief
    trip to Vienna, so I haven&#39;t had time to scour the libraries in Frankfurt

    enjoying perusing those low quality examples. <BR> <BR>My gut feeling is to go
    for as close of a revival as is possible first. I can always do something more
    interpretive later. I like the slanted-Roman Italic alot, and will probably work
    on that first, instead of any other oblique/italic option. It is becoming more
    common though to design more than one variety of italic for a single Roman...
    so there will always be room for more. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#42;This is Germany, so
