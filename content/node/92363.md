  closet thing to Minus Front Fontlab has is Delete Intersection. Which sometimes
  works like Minus Front, and sometimes doesn't.  In this pic I have drawn a crude
  shape on top of the t's ascender with the intent of only using it to chop away at
  the t.  Both the shapes are highlighted in red in the first pic. Most vector programs
  have a Minus Front feature which would simply trim the area of overlap and the entire
  object on top.  When I tired Delete Intersection in the example here, however, the
  result was a separate shape for the overlap, and a separate shape for the outline
  of both object. I have the combined outline shape selected and it appears in red
  in the second pic."

  body: "FontLab\u2019s Merge Contours works fine, but the Intersection operations
    really bite. Personally, I prefer CorelDraw's straightforward approach: Weld (merge
    or union), Trim (delete intersection or minus front/back) and Intersection (get),
    all with the options of leaving or deleting the source and target objects.\r\n\r\nConsequently,
    in CorelDraw, if you selected Trim/Delete Source/Delete Target, what you would
    end up with is the just the upright in your example, properly \u201Cminused.\u201D
    As it is, you will need to use the Wand Tool to select your trim source and cut
    or delete it, then use the tool to select the intersection and delete it, then
    select all and use Merge Contours to clean up any mess let behind."

    and direct it so that the glyph is reversed out of it. With black as white and
    white as black, Merge Contours will then do what you want.

    actually worked right would be even better."
