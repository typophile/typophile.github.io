body: 'Hi guys,  <BR> <BR>I incountered a very annoying error in InDesign. I created
  a layered font called Kryptonite. It exists out of 3 layers that on top of eachother
  form a font that resembles the logo I ones created for a client.  <BR>The correct
  order in which the have to be stapled is: A &#40;Blue&#41;, B &#40;Green&#41; and
  C &#40;White&#41;. <BR> <BR>In QuarkXpress &#40;yak&#41; the fonts are perfect,
  but in InDesign &#40;jummy&#41; it seems like the baselines are shift. The font
  doesn&#39;t fit anymore.  <BR>I checked in FOG but everything is consistent. Has
  anyone had this error too? I know it&#39;s a problem that you don&#39;t encounter
  unless you use a font like this, but perhaps someone knows. <BR> <BR>In this image
  you can see what happens. The upper one is Quark and the lower one InDesign. <BR>
  <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/38482.jpg" alt="Kryptonite
  error"> <BR> <BR>Please help, because I spent a whole lot of time getting this font
  to fit properly. <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Ren'

    kerning and traking of that logo.

  body: Kent is on the right track, but I think it will work better if you set the
    First Baseline Offset to &#34;Leading&#34;. Also, make sure the leading is the
    same for all three text boxes. <BR> <BR>BTW, I wouldn&#39;t call this an error
    so much as an inconvenient default setting. Quark has a similar setting &#40;I
    seem to recall&#41; which used to default to the same thing. They must have changed
    it at some point, or perhaps your Quark default setting is different.

    Man, is that inside information. Now it works beautifully. Thanks Kent. <BR> <BR>&#62;
    but I think it will work better if you set the First Baseline Offset to &#34;Leading&#34;.
    <BR> <BR>Not really. This will put the text much deeper in the text box, so it
    looks &#39;wrong&#39; to me. The option from Kent &#39;looks&#39; better. I don&#39;t
    know whether it&#39;s also effectively better. <BR> <BR>&#62; I would make the
    logo as a whole identity, in Illustrator.  <BR> <BR>Alessandro, it is already
    a logo, I made a font out of it afterwords.  <BR> <BR>Thanks guys for the great
    help. <BR> <BR>'
