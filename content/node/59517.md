  of typefaces only inches towards becoming halfway decent. I do actually buy my software
  and fonts, and find it often financially prohibitive to purchase anything new or
  exciting that comes out. \r\n\r\nSo, for a freelancer like myself, who is not rolling
  in it, what is the best way to accumulate great fonts? Do you bill clients for them,
  and if so, how do you brace them for a couple-hundred in expenses for a typeface?\r\n\r\nCurious,\r\n\r\n-C"

    printing, web hosting, or any other third party expense. Clients have no problem
    seeing the value of these other things, so a line item about fonts in your estimate
    should not raise any eyebrows. If it does, you have an opportunity to educate
    your client. Find a price that works for them and then find a font that fits their
    price. Around $200 gives you lots of options for a 4 weight family. Depending
    on what kind of job you're doing, don't forget to include a license for you, and
    for them (if they need it).\r\n\r\nAlternatively, just pad your estimate by the
    amount you need for the fonts. Problem with this is that you can be tempted to
    pocket the extra yourself and use Myriad! Haha."

    projects that entail no other third-party expenses to speak of (and no custom
    fonts or anything that's obviously \"special\", like for other languages/scripts
    or something). Also, if the fonts don't feature on the estimate, I don't usually
    get the \"but I paid for the fonts, I should have them\" line, which is also nice.

    in this for the fonts.  :-)"
