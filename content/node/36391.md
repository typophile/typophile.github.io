body: "I am building an InDesign template for our newspaper and for some reason every
  time I draw a text frame the Character Style defaults to my Body Copy Sans Serif
  Bold style. I want the default set as [none] so I don't have to turn off a Character
  Style every time I draw a frame. I can't figure out why this is happening. I know
  it's something simple. Adobe Help is no help.\r\n\r\nI can find in the Text Frames
  dialogue box where to set the default for Paragraph Styles, but not Character Styles.
  \r\n\r\nCan someone help me? Thanks."

    forums</a> on Adobe's site?

    the default. The next text block you draw should have that as a default. At least
    it seems to be that way in InDesign CS. '

  body: "As an addendum to that, in InDesign, if you want to change any default for
    *new documents* (as opposed to the current document), then change the setting
    when you have no documents open. All new documents will then have the current
    setting.\r\n\r\nI remember I once opened InDesign to use the glyph palette to
    look at Wingdings or Zapf Dingbats for something. I did it with no docs open,
    not remembering that selecting a font in the glyph palette also selects it for
    purposes of setting text. SO my next couple of new documents started out in dingbats!
    I soon realized what I'd done and changed it back....\r\n\r\nT"
