  body: You want to display base 10 numerals as base 12 glyphs? You do understand
    that this doesn't affect the base character encoding, right? Wouldn't it make
    more sense to do base conversion at the character level?

  body: "I want to make use of the automatic page number sequence in indesign but
    I want to display them in a base-12 system by adding two number symbols. Until
    now my main concern wasn\u2019t the encoding. Is there a better way? All help
    sincerely appreciated."

  body: Hmm. The best way for your purposes would be an InDesign script that would
    apply base 12 automatic page numbering instead of the usual base 10. To be honest,
    I've no idea how easy or difficult that would be.
