  body: "All I know is that third one is by my favorite designer Fabien Barral. Even
    if it didn't have his name on it, he has one of the most recognizable styles around
    right now. Absolutely love his work. I highly recommend everyone looking in to
    some of his projects for inspiration.\r\n\r\n\r\nKris Todd\r\nGraphic Designer\r\nwww.kasinkris.com\r\nTwitter:

  body: "Fabian Barral was kind enough to pass on the name of this quirky and confident,
    squarish display font with the oddly balanced counters seen above. At some point
    in time, he encountered it on dafont \u2013 and indeed it is <em>priceless</em>
    \u2013 but officially it\u2019s free for non-commercial use.\r\n\r\nWe can find
    it now strutting about the sunny shores of its home, [[http://www.cape-arcona.com/|Cape
    Arcona]], where it responds promptly to the name [[http://www.cape-arcona.com/start.php?link=strongman&typo=2|CA
    Strongman]] by flexing and winking on cue.\r\n\r\nEnjoy, and many thanks Mr. Barral!"
