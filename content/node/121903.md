body: "I hope this is working...\r\n\r\nI am looking for the font used in this badge.
  It is used on the headset of a 1953 Vespa. It is the same font as used on the face
  plate of the matching speedometer, so finding the correct font is important for
  a restoration i am going through. I spent a few evenings trying to find it, but
  i don't have a font-fetish, and am probably looking at the wrong resources.\r\n\r\nIn
  this picture, it is the upside down 'chilometri ora'\r\nhttp://i1204.photobucket.com/albums/bb413/dimitri123456789/Vespa%20VM1T%201953/IMG_3654.jpg\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for your time and help!\r\n\r\nDimitri\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/imageklein_4641.jpg]"

    you may find interesting [[http://www.houseind.com/fonts/neutraface|Neutraface]]
    and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/latinotype/uomo|Uomo]]. The main difficulty
    would probably the /S. Rotating/mirroring and playing around with the /5?

  body: "Thanks for the input! \r\n\r\nBoth are similar but have some differences.
    The Uomo looks like the typeface used for Vietnamese reproductions of the speedo
    dial. The character M is a different style (the M bothers me in the repro parts).\r\n\r\nThe
    Neutraface comes close (not perfect) and i think i can get it right with some
    tweaking. Not cheap to type not even 10 words though :-)"
