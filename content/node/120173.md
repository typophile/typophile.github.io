    the other hand, you could start with a condensed (or a combination of condensed
    and non-condensed) high-contrast sans like Radiant and recreate the quirkiest
    letters."

    to be Swedish for _SPRING EXHIBITION IN THE NATIONAL MUSEUM CONSTANT ART WORKS_

    can even imaging an exhibition room having multiple copies (sculptures, paintings)
    of the same artwork at different construction stages.\r\nEven better: The \"last-stage\"
    artwork could be such  that you can jump again to the first one and continue in
    circles :)"
