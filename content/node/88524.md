body: "Hello, \r\nI'm looking for a script / program that can generate a Black version
  of Light, or vice versa.\r\nThe script should 'simply' generate an approximate version,
  so I have something concrete to work on.\r\nI am well aware that it might become
  a problem - I have tried in Fontlab, but the result is not good, since the inner
  shapes of the letters quickly becomes too small.\r\n\r\nThanks & Merry Christmas
  to you all!"

  body: "The appx version will typically not be any better than what Fontlab can come
    up with: awful! \r\n\r\nIf you are up for some manual labour, I suggest you try
    your hands at KLTF's Transformer script. With it you lock any number of nodes,
    select the ones you want to move and the script takes care of the interpolation.
    You have to do it glyph by glyph, but it's very helpful to get the stem weight
    vs. notan weight right. "

  body: 'Quick guide: Lock all left edges, move all right edges. This will help keep
    the black/white rythm balanced. I guess you can figure out the vertical direction
    yourself. It''s more dependent on type style: e.g. you have to consider if you
    want to increase contrast or not, which in a grotesque might make sense, but not
    so much in a geometric face.'
