  publication I'm designing for them is mainly text based but illustrated with a lot
  of infographics. I have to use Helvetica,  so want a contemporary serif which will
  contrast. The publication needs to be elegant, sophisticated, and intelligent but
  not so severe that it's dull - so maybe something a bit quirky?\r\n\r\nAny thoughts
  or suggestions?\r\n\r\np.s. also colour has to be mainly orange/black to reflect
  their ID"
