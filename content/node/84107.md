body: "Hi All, \r\n\r\nFirst let me confess that I'm approaching this from a web perspective
  so some of my terminology might not be correct for you. I wanted to see what other
  people and hopefully people from a more print orientated background thought of this.\r\n\r\nI'm
  trying to make the text align to a baseline grid. I think I understand the principle
  of vertical rhythm where the main text must return to the rhythm following deviations.
  I'm doing this by setting up a baseline of 18px and using a line-height of 18px.
  I'm ignoring spacing between headings and paragraphs for this example.\r\n\r\nThe
  main body text is 12/18. \r\n\r\nHeadings are 24/36 so the line-height is a multiple
  of the baseline. \r\n\r\nThat works fine but to my eye, the line-height is too large
  for the heading - this is especially apparent when there are only 2 lines of heading.
  To me the line height should be somewhere in between 18 and 36. I could use a line
  height of 27 but that means that the following text is no longer on the rhythm,
  its shifted by half of the baseline. \r\n\r\nOne solution would be to add a margin
  of 9px so that the space taken up by the heading is still a multiple of 18 (27+9=36).
  The problem with that if the heading goes over two lines I\u2019d get  (27x2)54
  + 9 = 63. I won't ever know for sure how many lines the headline will take up.\r\n\r\n<strong>In
  Summary:</strong>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/line-height_6587.jpg]\r\n\r\nIf
  I use multiples of the baseline some of my headings will have line heights that
  are too large.\r\nIf I use line heights that seem reasonable I lose my baseline
  grid meaning that if I have two columns the text won't line up.\r\n\r\nDoes that
  make sense or am I totally misunderstanding this? Maybe this is something that print
  designers come up against all the time and make decisions based on a per project
  basis. Maybe its just my personal preference that doesn't like the 36px line height.\r\n\r\nAny
  thoughts or pointers would be well appreciated.\r\n"

    Add to that browse and type discrepancies and I''d suggest staying sane and go

  body: "Hi Riccard0 - Were you trying to post a link? I don't think it is showing
    up. I'd be very interested in your solution.\r\n\r\nI think the situation is similar
    to here: http://typophile.com/node/83763\r\n\r\nMathmatically it is possible -
    but with print you know exactly how many lines each heading is going to take up
    so you can adjust them based on that knowledge. Presumably until the client asks
    for a longer headline! That must take ages to re-calculate things!\r\n\r\nAs for
    browser consistencies, I've found that if you stick to pixels it all works out
    very well. Using ems is also fine but IE8 and IE9 (not below) messes up with line-height
    and ems. I've started to set my font size in ems and line-height in pixels meaning
    that IE users can still resize their text but the line-height won't grow with
    it. Its a fairly decent compromise."

  body: Perhaps - but similar in the way you have dealt with headlines that go over
    2 lines. I think with your example its all about the size of the heading. - Thanks
    for posting the link. The layout was very inspiring!

  body: "Hmmmm - hope this doesn't annoy anyone by me dragging this one up again but
    I keep coming across this. Perhaps there is no fix for this on the web but I'd
    like to know what print designers do in the situation.\r\n\r\nI understand that
    you set the line-height/leading so that it is in multiples of the baseline. But
    for my example that's too large. \r\n\r\nWhat would print designers do in this
    situation? Ignore that the line-height looks a bit odd for the sake of the vertical
    rhythm or change it and try and shift things so that they return to the rhythm?\r\n"

  body: You could write a small script to automatically adjust the margins when necessary.
    There is no concept of baseline rythm on the web, so efforts to do so will often
    include some kind of hack.

  body: "The typical reason for a baseline grid in print is to keep the type in adjacent
    columns aligned horizontally. Eyeball your blocks of type as you see fit and then
    adjust the spacing between paragraphs/sections to then accomodate the grid.\r\n\r\nOn
    the web this is much more difficult as you don't have the same control over rendering
    as you do in a DTP app. "

  body: "Thanks for the replies!\r\n\r\n\r\nAluminium - thanks for that. That's kind
    of what I was getting when I wanted to know if print designers sort of shift things
    around because they know things won't change once it has been sent to the printers.
    It MUST be very annoying though when I client adds extra text at the last minute
    that just nudges everything out!\r\n\r\nI do think that although its difficult
    on the web its not impossible. Definitely fine if you know that the text is static.
    You can see this at http://typophile.com/node/84256 (you might need to scroll
    the image I uploaded to see the right column). This is a screenshot that looks
    consistent across browser. Luckily for this the font is condensed and the line
    height works in multiples.\r\n\r\nFrode frank - This is an idea I started to play
    around with. There is probably a way of working out the height of the element,
    and working out if that means it has gone over an even or odd number of lines.
    Margin/padding could then be used depending on whether its odd or even to make
    up the overall height to be a multiple of the line height.\r\n\r\nSeems to be
    a bit of a sledgehammer approach but this is an issue I keep coming across so
    would love this to work. If I get any further I'll post here.\r\n\r\nThanks again\r\n"
