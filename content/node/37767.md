  body: "\r\nThanks for all the prompt and helpful responses, everyone! (I had the
    same idea about mousse and fling, but they just didn't work for my application.)
    Not a problem, I've gone another route, but I appreciate the reminder about Jim's
    work. I'd forgotten just how prolific that guy is! Thanks again.\r\n"
