    the gravestone is from 1833? I mean, even if the first date of death was of that
    year, they might have replaced the gravestone later when addition ppl were added,
    e.g. 1923/24 would sound more reasonable for me (though I'm not an expert in American
    grave lettering, it seems me way to grotesque for early 19th century)."
