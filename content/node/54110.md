body: "First off, let me say I am no designer. I quite suck at it. And, by the end
  of all this, I'd most likely have to hire a designer. \r\n\r\nBut you see... my
  issue is that I seem to pick sucky designers that need to be told every step of
  the way what to do.  I do realize this is probably because I can't afford top-notch
  and so I reap what I sow.  \r\n\r\nBut I thought I'd give this wonderful forum a
  shot ... to glean ideas and feedback to see what direction I should take this logo.\r\n\r\nThe
  concept is based on the Victory Gardens of the WWII era.  [[http://images.google.com/images?q=victory+garden+posters&btnG=Search+Images&um=1&hl=en&sa=2]]
  except instead of VICTORY, I am using FREEDOM.\r\n\r\nHere is a very rough idea.
  \r\n\r\nI haven't yet found the fonts that \"spoke\" to me.  Something that says
  garden / dirty / modern, etc.  I would like to evoke the feeling of the old victory
  gardens but take it into modern times.\r\n\r\nOne of the marks would be this fist
  holding a garden trowel.  But how to integrate the two?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    The bottom type is more what you want.\r\n\r\nAs for the placement of the garden
    trowel...you can separate the two words (on same line) with it in the middle,
    have in \"grow\" out of the word garden or you can have that as the main image
    inside a circle and have the type work around the image.\r\n\r\nThose are just
    a few suggestions...\r\n\r\nWhat exactly do you mean by: <em>\"I would like to
    evoke the feeling of the old victory gardens...\"</em>\r\n\r\nJonE."

    it.\r\ncheck http://www.csaimages.com for visual style.\r\nas for the typography,
    it looks cheap in its current state.\r\ntrying exploring the Futura family.\r\n\r\nI
