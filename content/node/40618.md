  On a font with a full set of accented latin glyphs, and the circumflex in the glyph
  window: From the outline layer, (ahem) move the origin or left side bearing, (I
  know no one is likely to do this intentionally, but pretend you've done it by accident).
  Undo this move. Do your accented characters using circumflex still show bad positioning?
  \r\n\r\nThanks if you try & let me know. \r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n"

    beta version. A similar thing happens if you perform the same action on a base
    glyph: then the accents on all composites involving that base will be affected.'

  body: "John, thanks. I take it this has migrated along into 5.0.4 then. \r\n\r\nDez,
    I installed 5.0.1 months ago, thought I'd just smoothly transition, found this.
    Being too busy for a ''layers for dummies'' lecture, I 'upgraded' back to 4.5.
    \r\n\r\nI was looking again to see if I missed a preference, or some other obvious
    fault of my own when I noticed a destructive derivative of this seemingly senseless
    UI change.\r\n\r\nCheers."
