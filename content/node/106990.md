  font. Most seem pretty terrible for the task of writing/reading 3-4 paragraphs,
  but I'd still like to give it a good shot.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions for a web font
  that looks handwritten/scripty and remains somewhat usable for medium-form writing
  and reading?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "One approach is to use a font that mimics the type of handwriting that was
    taught in schools -- but is now being dropped because of the attitude that in
    the age of keyboarding \"nobody writes by hand!\" Other options are to use a font
    that avoids too much variation in the flow of the lower case letters. Webfonts
    should be available for most of the fonts listed below.\r\nSo you might try: \r\n*
    Tim Ryan's School Script from Monotype\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/school-script/\r\n*
    Monoline Script from Monotype -- very regular appearance\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/monoline-script-mt/\r\n*
    Jack Edmondson's Wisdom Script and Yellow Design Studio's variation as \r\nThirsty
    Script -- use the light weight\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/yellow-design/thirsty-script/\r\n*Martin
    Wait's William Lucas\r\nhttp://www.fonts.com/font/itc/williamlucas\r\n* Robert
    Hunter Middleton's Coronet\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/search/coronet/fonts/\r\nDon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
