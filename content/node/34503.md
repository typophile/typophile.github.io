  body: "Nice to see you here again, Chris!\r\n\r\nI got a second-hand HP LaserJet
    4000 a couple of days ago and I've been trying it out by printing pop song lyrics
    with the fonts I have, so it's interesting to see this thread.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/loving_memory_5154.jpg]\r\nFrom
    the song <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woZ7MRjue7U\">\"Loving Memory\"</a>
    by Jaurim. Fonts used: K\xFCnstler Script, <a href=\"https://www.sandoll.co.kr/SandollWeb/shop/product_down_read.asp?idx=229\">Chuksaryunum
    (\uCC99\uC0AC\uB95C\uC74C)</a>.\r\nTranslation:\r\nAh, this heart is dulled by
    the pain of longing\r\nAh, the memories of a love that will not return\r\nAh,
    loneliness is as cold as winter rain\r\nAh, this heart cries, soaked in rain"
