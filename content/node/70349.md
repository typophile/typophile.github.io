  Cyrillic\r\n\r\nDavid Brezina's successful type family Skolar has been expanded
  with a full Cyrillic character set. It supports 32 languages using Cyrillic script,
  besides most of the Slavic languages, many Asian and non-Slavic languages are covered
  too. It also supports Serbian italic alternates and \u201Cnew\u201D Bulgarian stylistics.
  Skolar Cyrillic has been designed as a close complement to Latin with the help of
  the experienced designer and consultant Alexandra Korolkova, and it has already
  earned its first awards at Modern Cyrillic 2009 and Granshan 2009.\r\n\r\nread more

    I'm not sure, but I think they talk about Cyrillic small caps on page 10 in the
    pdf. Though, you probably see it. See also from pages 12 and more. It's seems
    it's a mix with lower case."
