  body: I think SkyNews is big enough to afford its own custom  <BR>designed corporate
    logo... Thirstype&#39;s <a href="http://www.thirstype.com/font_orbit.html" target="_blank">
    Orbit</a> is similar  <BR>in style, but you&#39;ll probably have trouble finding
    a  <BR>unicase font.

  body: Yves, why not have a disclaimer on the title of this forum that states if
    its a logo, its probably custom. We see this often.

  body: Dan why have the disclaimer? Even if it&#39;s custom, this  <BR>very thread
    proves we can help by pointing to near-matches  <BR>or similar faces. This is
    not about us getting perfect scores  <BR>by IDing as many as possible faces under
    two minutes, the  <BR>sole purpose of this board is to help people out, methinks.

  body: Glad to hear you reinforce that idea. That&#39;s why I&#39;m here. Very often
    in this field, close is plenty good enough. Especially if you have to hold the
    two side by side to notice the differences -- most folks don&#39;t have eyes that
    are tuned for the details you guys spot!

  body: 'I think that&#39;s a typeface. Here&#39;s why: <BR>Compare the S. On the
    left it looks like a capital form, on the right it looks lowercase. At the very
    least there is no reason that they should be different in a custom logo of this
    genre. The K is definitely capital. I don&#39;t think we&#39;re looking at a custom
    unicase logo, but two weights of a font scaled to acheive the purpose. <BR> <BR>They
    wouldn&#39;t be the first company who could afford better but chose not to. <BR>
    <BR>For all that guessing you&#39;d think I&#39;d hazard a guess on the font?
    <BR>I have no idea :-&#41; <BR> <BR>Randy &#40;Apex came to mind, but it&#39;s
    not that&#41;'

  body: Yves, I don&#39;t mean stop helping but just inform people that most logos
    are custom. Too many people want an exact match. It just a thought

  body: I just came across <a href="http://thetvroom.com/area-c/tvfonts/section-front.shtml"
    target="_blank"> this site</a>, which has &#34;Skyward&#34; fonts made to mimic.
    <BR>The original font is attributed to X&amp;Y Design, the only links for which
    I <BR>could find related to furniture design. <BR> <BR>Note that Skyward Regular
    has a lc e and n which, if blown up to match <BR>the size of the other &#40;uc&#41;
    letters, has about the right weight. PC only &#40;again&#41;. <BR>
