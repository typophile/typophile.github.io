body: "Web fonts are in everyone\u2019s mouth. While the browser makers and the type
  industry agrees on a common standard for HTML font embedding (will it be .eot or
  .ttf/.otf with some special tables? \u2014 we shall see,) FontLab is offering a
  more immediate solution. \r\n\r\nWeb designers have used the Flash-based \u201CsIFR\u201D
  font replacement technique for a few years now to enhance their web pages with custom
  fonts of their choice. It is not perfect but works better than saving text as images:
  it at least allows searchability and copy-paste, plus it performs well on mobile
  devices that don\u2019t support Flash. \r\n\r\nFontLab\u2019s new product <strong>[[http://www.fontlab.com/photofont/webready/|Photofont
  WebReady]]</strong> is compatible with sIFR 2 but goes beyond its capabilities.
  It can create dynamic web headlines using not only OpenType and TrueType fonts but
  also using the Photofont font format. Photofont WebReady can also create bitmap-based
  dynamic web headlines from any OpenType and TrueType fonts, allowing a customized
  text appearance on the web while preventing extraction of font outlines out of Flash
  files. \r\n\r\nDeveloped by FontLab, Photofont brings the beauty of full-color bitmap
  fonts (with alpha transparency) to print and web. After BitFonter (a bitmap font
  editor that can create photofonts) and Photofont Start (a plugin that allows using
  photofonts in Adobe Photoshop), Photofont WebReady is the next product in the Photofont
  line. Plugins that allow using photofonts in Adobe InDesign and QuarkXPress are
  under development. \r\n\r\nPhotofont WebReady retails at US$79.95. For more information
  visit the Photofont WebReady product page at [[http://www.fontlab.com/photofont/webready/]]
  and the Photofont technology page at [[http://www.photofont.com/]]. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam

  body: I'm curious to know what other foundries think about this technology. I'd
    assume it is viewed as embedding still and so not allowed by most foundries and
    their EULAs.

  body: "As far as I can tell, many foundries do not disallow font embedding in Flash
    files \u2014 or they are not specific about it. Photofont WebReady uses Flash
    as the container of the font. \r\n\r\nHowever, I must say that we have explicitly
    taken a \"protective\" approach. Outline fonts (OpenType, TrueType) will be converted
    into outline-based Flash containers only if the font allows editable embedding.
    This was my reasoning because the functionality of the application is to create
    Flash font containers that allow rendering of arbitrary choice from outside of
    the Flash container. So this sort of embedding is \"editable\". \r\n\r\nSince
    the bitmaps generated by a font are not subject to the same copyright protection
    as outlines (which are considered to be font software), my reasoning was that
    if the font's embedding permission disallow editable embedding, Photofont WebReady
    will still allow to embed the bitmaps of the font. However, if the font disallows
    embedding completely, Photofont WebReady will also disallow it (even for bitmaps).
    \r\n\r\nOf course, Photofont WebReady still does provide a link to the Copyright
    string and the EULA of the font right on the first screen \u2014 so the user can
    consult the details. \r\n\r\nThere are a few sIFR-compatible font converters out
    there, but as far as I know, none of them respects the font vendors' rights to
    the same extent as Photofont WebReady. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam\r\n"
