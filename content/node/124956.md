    use OpenType features for setting the marks (tashkeel) positions the only way
    I know is to use Microsoft's free VOLT software. \r\nHere is an excellent booklet
    freely downloadable from khtt.org  explaining how to use it for Arabic.\r\nhttp://www.google.co.jp/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=4&ved=0CDkQFjAD&url=http%3A%2F%2Fkhtt.net%2Fattachment%2F31760&ei=Yus-VbuCMMStmAWmpIH4AQ&usg=AFQjCNFXisf60n0iIGhjnDxwJcrN9F8qSA&sig2=eqgs69NLvdV29kuktA2aXA&bvm=bv.91665533,d.dGY\r\nIt
    is not easy to learn at first, but if you ask questions you get answers. Are you
    using Fontlab?  \r\n\r\nIn your red example you changed the locations of the marks.
    In Volt that is done in the Marks feature. However in the case of the dammatan
    you also changed the mark shape. For that you need to crete a substitution feature.
    and then to specify in the Mark on Mark  mkmk feature.\r\n\r\n\r\nGood luck."
