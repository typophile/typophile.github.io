body: With finally a weekend to myself away from Atlanta and all its distractions,
  I have just started delving into the documentation and tutorials for the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/fonts/OSXTools.html">Apple
  Font Tools</a>. I&#39;m building MIF files for simple ligatures and elaborate contextual
  state tables, and choking on error after error. I&#39;m losing my hair. I seem to
  be missing a LOCA table and have no idea how to build it. <BR> <BR>Has anyone here
  used these new XML-based tools to build at least one functioning AAT font? If so,
  please do share your thoughts and experiences.
