body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI was just wondering... perhaps a bit early... what you think
  about my new letter e (my first self made letter e that is). A few months ago I
  worked quite a lot with the cooper, tyke and sauna typefaces and found myself drawing
  this e last week in the train.\r\n\r\nI used the little serif of the e to make the
  serifs of the other letters quickly in illustrator, but I was just wondering what
  you think of this e. =)))\r\n\r\nHmz.. knowing what other people post here I know
  this is not much... but I was just wondering if this would make a happy little alphabet
  that is worth pursuing further...\r\n\r\nThanks (as always) for your feedback! =)\r\n\r\nAve
  a nice day!"

  body: hmz... Is it really that bad or should i have made up a nicer story to go
    with the e to get some replies?

  body: "It's hard to tell the character of the alphabet from only a few letters,
    how the strokes vary and what the specific features of the font might be...maybe
    try a few more letters, then it will be easier to give suggestions.\r\nIt looks
    like it might be suitable for cartoony computer games...was that the idea?"

  body: It makes me think of chocolate cookies with jellowy stuff on them..it could
    be fun for a small cake shop, especially if you keep the weird blurby character
    of it.

  body: "Hi... sorry for the extremely late reply.\r\nI haven't had time to work on
    it for a long time. So no updates for now. I thought I'd receive emails when people
    would reply, so I haven't checked this post anymore since I didn't get any updates
    in my mail.\r\nBut it's nice to see that some people did reply to the post.\r\n\r\nVery
    much appreciated.\r\nBendy I was just randomly drawing while sitting in the train
    to work and this letter was what I ended up with when I reached the last station.
    I didn't have any idea what to use it for (still don't)... I just thought that
    if I'd start drawing and making my own alphabet it would be a good learning curve
    to type design.\r\n\r\nThanks Fl\xF6sser! Perhaps someday I will finish it and
    you never know... Maybe someday it might be used on something (although the company
    would have to be a \"good\" company... with good people and friendly animals and
    all that... I like those sorts of companies) =)\r\n\r\nanyway... sorry for the
    late reply.. and tnx for taking the time to write something about my e =)\r\n\r\nbye!
    \r\n\r\ndav2."
