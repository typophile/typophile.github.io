  body: It comes from a Haig Whiskey label that we're working on in Illustrator. At
    the moment all we've been sent are paths that's why it's sharp and clean. We would
    love to be able to make it editable but it's sounding less likely.

  body: Can't find a match. Curiosity now. How did you get such a big and clean sample?
    Is it from a PDF? Sometimes, it is also (very) helpful to give some details on
    sample like its origin, the brand is linked to... Actually anything could help
    to dig the case...
