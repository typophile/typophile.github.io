  in love with typography. I'm not sure why it took me so long - but I figure it's
  better late than never. As a result, I've started to carefully select and purchase
  a few typefaces that have caught my eye.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm wondering is - how to recommend
  really mastering a typeface (is that possible?).  What I mean is, if you have a
  typeface like HF&J Requiem - what are the best ways to educate yourself to fully
  maximize it's potential?\r\n\r\nI've thought about gathering different images that
  use Requiem - but I'm not quite sure how to go about this. Is there a resource available
  for this that I'm not aware of? I'd love to see how other designers have used it
  - what works... what doesn't... what fonts can potentially be paired with it.  What
  types of applications it could be used for?\r\n\r\nRequiem is just one example.
  \ There are about five typefaces that I'd like to take this focus on.\r\n\r\nAny
  thoughts or suggestions would be deeply appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nJason"

    in one (or more) typeface you like and try to reproduce it.

  body: "Here are four different and valid ways to study typefaces. \r\n\r\nOne is,
    if they are popular, to look at them in many different uses, and see when you
    think them well and badly used, and try to analyze why they work and don't in
    the different settings.  \r\n\r\nA second is to set them, side by side, in the
    same setting. And then vary them to see which looks best in what setting.\r\n\r\nThird,
    open them up in a font editor, and paste the outlines of one over the other, to
    see the differences that are responsible for the different looks en masse. Also
    look at the way the spacing is handled differently. \r\n\r\nFourth, read books
    on type. Letters of Credit, by Walter Tracy, is a \"must read\". Another favorite
    of mine is Fonts and Logos by Doyald Young. There are many others. \r\n\r\nIf
    you do these, often, you a certified typomaniac. Welcome to the crowd! "

    (I just make the stuff) I myself\r\ncan't be too helpful in terms of how to leverage
    particular fonts, but\r\nwhat I would offer is what might be the single most useful
    \"big secret\"\r\nof typefaces: a font's color (meaning weight), spacing and vertical\r\nproportions*
    are intertwined (which means they have to be balanced**)\r\nand where a font lies
    on this spectrum determines its ideal point size.\r\n\r\n* Mostly the relative
    size of its x-height.\r\n\r\n** This is why -contrary to what some will have you
    believe- some\r\nfonts are better than others, and some fonts are just plain lousy.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "While there may not be set pieces, like scored music which may be performed
    with specific instruments, it\u2019s nonetheless possible to execute the classic
    layout formats of various genres, in combinations of different typefaces.\r\n\r\nBut
    where can you do this with a real purpose?\r\n\r\nWhy not start a web site at
    which to carry out your exploration, and document it?\r\n\r\nAs a type designer,
    I certainly get to know the types I\u2019m designing (if they\u2019re retail and
    I\u2019m working from scratch, not commissioned for a specific project which acts
    as a testing ground), by making specimen banners for MyFonts, and PDF specimen
    \u201Cbooks\u201D, some with <em>faux</em> specimens of ads, posters, packaging
    &c. But you would have the advantage of being able to mix several faces in one
    piece, rather than just use one typeface at a time, which is the norm for type
    specimens \r\n\r\nEmigre has produced specimens which involve combinations of
    their fonts -- most notably starting with <em>Emigre</em> magazine twenty years
    ago. And Typotheque has sample layouts, an advanced form of type tester harking
    back to some of the old Linotype manuals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    been doing that a bit but having some trouble finding 'examples'.  I am still
    not very good at identifying typefaces.  is there a resource somewhere that allows
    you see examples of one particular typeface in action?  For example, how would
    one best go about finding examples of Requiem (or any other well-known typeface
    for that matter)?? \r\n\r\n@William  thanks for these tips... but again, same
    question.  What's a good way to find the typeface in different uses???  \r\n\r\n@dunwich
    \  the journey begins... ;)\r\n\r\n@hrant  deep stuff.. gotta chew on that for

    \ I actually just started a 365 project where I'm laying out quotations on photos
    every day for an entire year.  I just hit the 30 day mark and I've learned a ton

    to going into book stores, looking at magazines, newspapers, ads, web sites, etc.,
    you can check out http://fontsinuse.com/.\r\n\r\nAlso in addition to experimenting
    on your own, you can follow discussions on Typophile. But do check out the work
    of those posting, and see if you like it, and take that into account in assessing
    their comments. Also you can ask specific questions about specific faces\u2014that
    is likely to get more useful responses, I think. "

    I work with a wide variety of them every day. Spending my time slipping font after
    font into the appropriate mental slot never struck me as an effective use of my
    time. \r\nQuite the opposite, actually, I'd rather not know - easier for me to
    focus on what the thing IS rather than on what it's called and how it's categorized.\r\n\r\nI
    once learned what a lachrymal was, by accident, and it took me a week of real
    effort to finally forget. (No joke.)\r\n\r\nBut if you're interested in how typefaces
    look and work together inside web pages, I recommend the outfit I'm currently
    associated with: Konstellations. If fonts in the context of web design are of

    the subscription price some kind of impenetrable barrier.)\r\n\r\nHere's a look

  body: "A nice exercise we did in school:\r\n\r\nPrint out 5 arbitrary glyphs from
    a given typeface. Examine these glyphs closely. Then try and draw some of the
    missing glyphs (without referencing the font file on your computer).\r\n\r\nThis
    helps you understand the structure of the typeface, and it's quite fun to see
    how different (and often awkward) your solution is compared to the original.\r\n\r\nHopefully
    this will help you understand how the design of the typeface lends itself to certain
    settings. \r\n\r\nAnd if you have the scratch: go to www.typecamp.org"
