body: "Hello everybody,\r\n\r\nI'm working on Sensato Black (see critique section
  > sans) and I've read a couple of times that the overshoot in darker weights should
  be larger. When I open up some fonts in Fontlab, it seems that the overshoot is
  only made larger at the top, not the bottom. I don't see why. I see that darker
  weights appear to have a smaller x-height, but it seems much more logical to me
  to just increase the x-height instead of the overhoot (at the top only?) I would
  like to know how some typedesigners handle this issue and if you know any webpages,
  books or just knowledge about this, please do share it. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nJasper

  body: My guess that it is more important to establish an even baseline when mixing
    different weights than obtaining evenness on the x-height, though ideally one
    would aim for both.

  body: "In heavier fonts the distance of the overshoot usually needs to increase
    to proportionally increase the surface area of the overshoot to the surface area
    the letter gains from its extra weight. \r\n\r\n<cite>When I open up some fonts
    in Fontlab, it seems that the overshoot is only made larger at the top, not the
    bottom.</cite>\r\n\r\nWhat fonts are you looking at? I have rarely seen type designed
    that way.\r\n\r\n<cite>I see that darker weights appear to have a smaller x-height,

    as weight increases to keep the letters from filling in. This requires a matching
    increase in overshoot distance in addition to the increase that comes with weight.
    Rarely a font is drawn with a consistent x-height, but that\u2019s a special challenge
    for special designs. "

  body: I go by two factors; the width of round characters, and weight of the hairlines.

  body: "Thanks alot Nina! That's a very useful thread. I decided to go Slimbach's
    way. That is, only increased x-height, not ascenders. The 'increase in overshoot
    only at the top' I mentioned earlier, was in Myriad. What I saw as an increased
    x-height, not increased overshoot. \r\n\r\nCheers, Jasper"

  body: "Interestingly, Slimbach in heavier weights nowadays favors decreasing cap
    height instead of increasing x-height. Or at least, he did a few years ago.\r\n\r\nFor
    some reason this bothered me; IIRC I *think* I kept cap height constant in Hypatia
    Sans and increased the x-height instead.\r\n\r\nT"
