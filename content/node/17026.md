  as you can prolly see). Im in the process of finding suitable typography that will
  work well with illustration. \r\nSince Im not knowledgeable when it comes to this
  subject, I could you some help.\r\nIm looking for font that is used in pulp-horror
  comics/literature, the one that you see on the picture is House Industries Voodoo
  house.\r\nThanks for help,\r\n\r\nL.\r\n"
