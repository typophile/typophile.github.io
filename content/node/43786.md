  body: "There are a number of search techniques you might employ:\r\n\r\n<ol> <li>Google
    \"Disco font\" or something similar.</li> \r\n<li>Use the search engine at various
    font distributors. Fonts are catalogued at these establishments by \"keyword\"
    metadata, and it's likely that the word \"disco\" would be one such keyword for
    the types you show.</li>\r\n<li>If it is indeed type you are interested in, and
    not just fonts, you can get a lot more inventive with your search terms.</li>\r\n<li>To
    be really different, search offline.</li>\r\n<li>Make your own. If you have vector
    drawing skills, this sort of thing is much easier to do now than back in the day
    with pen and ink.</li></ol>\r\n"

    first pic!  It's an early 80's jazz funk comp - one of the first to be pressed
    as a continuous mix record.  \"Check Out The Groove\" by Bobby Thurston is one
    of my favourites...ok,  I'll shut up now.\r\n\r\nJH"

  body: Thanks JazzHustler for the music tip. I just posted on the reason I was looking
    for disco type in the first place. I'm working on this Xanadu type piece. It's
    slow going, so if anyone gets and chance I would love to hear your thoughts. Thanks.
