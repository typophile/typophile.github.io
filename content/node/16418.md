  insane for fonts since I was in my early teens (many, many moons ago), long before
  computer based font tools...\r\n\r\nIn any case, I'm looking for a book that someone
  out there might have of know where can be obtained... I have Volume Two of D. B.
  Updike's \"Printing Types; Their history, forms, and use, a study in survivals\",
  second edition, 1937. I'd like volume one as well.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n"

    on abebooks revealed several good candidates for you, starting around the $20
    price. I have both volumes and can recommend them.
