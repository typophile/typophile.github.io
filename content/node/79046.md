  Does anyone knows a good site or book were I can find it? Any info about the Souvenir
  typeface is welcome too.\r\n\r\nThank a lot and greetings\r\n\r\n"

    find it in ads in mass-circulation magazines from that era, eg Playboy.\r\nIt
    was based on an early 20th century font \"Eastern Souvenir\""

  body: "Prior to Ed's revival, the original Souvenir had been used in the 1960s,
    for instance in the title of an article in Playboy (yes, I have a large collection--a
    marvelous repository of specimens of Madison Avenue's \"Creative Revolution\",
    not to mention airbrushing technique:-)\r\n\r\nWas that original early 20th century
    Souvenir ever rendered as phototype before the ITC version?"
