  body: Dan - If it&#39;s any consolation, 50 of those authors have only written <BR>one
    article, and many haven&#39;t written at all. So if you want to be <BR>truly special,
    please write for us some more. ;&#41;  <BR> <BR>We certainly welcome your voice!

  body: Well, I&#39;ll keep my eyes open so that I can join this exclusive group of
    50. Do your authors just write articles, and post them for your approval, or do
    they run their ideas by you first? Thank you again.

  body: Thanks for the pics, LORP. But David&#39;s wife&#39;s name is Mona. Veronica
    is my wife&#39;s name, which might be the source of the confusion. <BR> <BR>T
