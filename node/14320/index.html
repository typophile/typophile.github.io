Well I use both PC and Mac at work, and jumping over to Mac gives me a sensation of slamming my fingers in a door because of how the mouse pointer responds.

If anybody relates to what I'm talking about, well here's a brand new fix that doesn't require USB Overdrive.

		<div class="commentbody">Chris, I didn't say that Mac users were morons, but it appears that that's the assumption Jobs and Wozniak made when they opted for a one-button mouse (they looked at several other alternatives).

The best tool is the one that works for you. I do most of my work on PCs, and the Mac's lack of right-clickability bugs me (yes, I know about control+click, but it slows me down). PC programs also generally have a lot more keyboard shortcuts built in, which I also appreciate. But that's just me...</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Being a convert from PCs to Macs I always preferred (and still do) the right click mouse on a PC. I started to like Macs more, but given that my iMac won't start anymore, Macs include virtually no troubleshooting manuals, no diagrams detailing how to do simple tasks (like adding RAM) and offer very little MANUAL commands in the event of system failure, I'm getting a bit fed up with Apple's sleekness. Style means jack if the device doesn't function properly. I'm sure at the very least the new mouse will "look cool".</div>

Fortunately, I haven't had any trouble with the interface, but iTunes is another story.  Once I found out all it was good for was clicking on glossy buttons, I had to open its system files and delete them with extreme pregidous.  It wouldn't allow me to export mp3s from the iPod!  Useless! (theft protection? give me a break.)

So, bluntly, there's no way in Hell I would buy an iComputer.

Or its silly, silly iMouse.</div>

Try this (there are other software apps that do the same thing a little searching should find them) I haven't used it and since I am Mac based I am unlikely to, so I can make no claims for it. Still it might calm you down :)

I'm also going to stick with a single button mouse, I tried a 5 function mouse on a pad for a while but found that most of the buttons only worked intermittently and did different things in different software.

		<div class="commentbody">This thread is all over the place but for what it's worth, I know someone who bought one and this is what he had to say:

<em>Well so far it's been just trying to say something new about what is essentially just a mouse.

Ran the installer which required 152mb of space?!! Mighty is not the word.
Restarted and set up the preferences to use the scroll ball as Expose--> Show desktop and the side buttons to Expose-->Show all windows

The scroll ball is quite springy in that pressing down. I was expecting it to be quite rigid but any amount of force will press it down into it's hole. I would wonder about the durability of this as it does seem mounted on a soft spring. The side buttons do require a good squeeze between the thumb and ringfinger. The sound they emit is very quiet though the scroll ball sound is very realistic

I have put up the tacking speed on everything to it's highest as I like a fast mouse. The right click action is identical to the action I use on the intellimouse.
Been using it in Photoshop/Preview in place of the usual spacebar action to move around the document and it works well though a bit jerkier.It means a quicker workflow in some instances.

The short cord is actually good for powerbook users as I use it on the right with the cord plugged in on the left hand side. It definitely would be awkard plugging it into a g5 under the desk and using it that way.

All in all a good mouse for creative work but I'll have to road test it a bit more.</em>

My mouse is designed by <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/mouseandkeyboard/productdetails.aspx?pid=027">Philip S+arck</a>, and looks like it just came in from Alpha Centauri. I only bought it because my old Logitech mouse died and this was the only one in the shop that night with similar functionality (I don't trust wireless mice). But it turns out to be a really excellent mouse, and I'm enjoying using it.</div>

Maybe he's thinking "let's not make this one eat batteries."

Bluetooth is a nightmare. One of the worst examples of Engineering By Committee. Someone just wrote a Linux program that lets you break into the Bluetooth Audio channel used by new luxury cars for their speakerphone function and yell at the driver. "Hey you in the Crackura! Pull your head out of (etc.)"

So the Mighty Mouse is multiple button yet it isn't. This is ultimately a concession by Apple. The first thing I do when I get a Mac is hook up a four-button PC trackball. I'll see if this new one is better than discrete buttons.</div>
