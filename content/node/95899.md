body: Anybody know with any certainty where startpoints should be located? Does it
  matter? All I've found through experimentation is that it seems better to have the
  startpoint at a corner rather than on a curve.

    is good practice because on a curve you have to ensure smoothness manually.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Somebody here (was it Miguel?) said that for historical reasons you should
    aim to place them so that the previous section (leading into the endpoint) is
    a straight line, where possible.

  body: I'm not sure which old font format preferred things that way, or whether wholly
    curved glyphs posed problems, but I think it's safe to conclude it's not an issue
    for applications these days. FontLab, however, does sometimes do funny things
    to start points between curves, so I try to put them at the end of straight sections
    when possible. I'd be interested to hear others' methods.

  body: Yeah, for some reason Fontlab seems to treat a start point on a curve as two
    points, which isn't a problem until you try interpolating between two glyphs where
    the start point is on a curve in one and not the other. Having said that, I'm
    struggling to get blend fonts to work very well at all, even when all points,
    start points and start point order are compatible.

    Eddie Blendera.\r\n\r\nSometimes when I couldn't stand it anymore, I'd copy one
    blendend to the background, then copy the other blendend to the foreground, and
    bash one blendend into the shape of the other from the same friggin contour. That
    always works."

  body: One very weird thing about blend fonts is it seems to make a difference which
    master you put in which box. Blend thin with black yields different results from
    blend black with thin!
