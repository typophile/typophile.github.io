  I saw it on a 1950-retro sign in a restaurant, advertising beverages. The &#34;S&#34;
  was the same, but the &#34;E&#34; was similar to Stadion. <BR> <BR>Any thoughts?'

    Heavy</a>? It&#39;s a close match, but not quite. <BR> <BR>Red Rooster <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/phosphate-rr/solid/testdrive.html?s=INSOMNIA&amp;p=72">Phosphate
    Black</a> has the same vintage feel, but the &#39;S&#39; isn&#39;t as compressed.

    Black</a> is a bit looser than you&#39;re probably looking for. <BR> <BR>

  body: '&#62;<i>What about Font Bureau&#39;s Berlin Sans?</i> <BR> <BR>Ooh, that&#39;s
    nice. The <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/berlin-sans/berlinsans-demi/testdrive.html?s=INSOMNIA&amp;p=96">demi
    bold</a> has the right weight and feel, and would work for spacing. But there&#39;s
    in the uprights and angled stems. The original is probably much more geometric
    given that it&#39;s signage.'

  body: Thanks all for the suggestions! Mostra is very close, and I have been playing
    with it. <BR> <BR>Berlin Sans is a nice font - but I agree with Grant in that
    it&#39;s not geometric enough. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m probably going use a combination
    of Mostra and Stadion, with some hand-drawn modifications. <BR> <BR>Thanks again
    everyone!
