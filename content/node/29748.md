    and Cyrillic versions, and <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/48344/helveticaworld-family.html?DSESSID=&PHPSESSID=a04b0657aaf1e74cf0314ee8b3f82f6c>Helvetica\u2122

  body: "I realize I'm coming into this very late, but for future reference, buying
    the fonts directly from Dynacomware is <em>much</em> cheaper than from Linotype,
    at $25 a pop.  They're one of the cheapest type foundries for East Asian stuff
    (if not <em>the</em> cheapest), and they offer packs of fonts at a further huge
    discount as well.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dynalab.com/Products/Wheretobuy/DynaComwareGlobal/tabid/645/language/en-US/Default.aspx\r\n\r\nNote
    that for Japanese, Morisawa's Medium Gothic BBB was actually packaged with Helvetica
    for a long time.  They have since replaced it with a proprietary face in the OpenType
    version of the font (Helvetica was seen as having glyphs that were a wee bit too
    small and heavy), but it's still very close to Helvetica aside from the <em>a</em>
    (has a cut-off tail like in Arial or the heavier weights of Helvetica, but otherwise
    it resembles Helvetica's <em>a</em> more than Arial's), the <em>g</em> (double-story),
    the <em>r</em> (the top is a little shorter), and the <em>y</em> (the tail curves
    a little differently).\r\n\r\nHere's a comparison of the two versions:\r\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Gothic_BBB_sample.png"
