body: "Greetings!\r\n\r\nI'm no expert, but I suspect this may be a printer's typeface
  that is not available as a digital font, but I'll be glad if I'm wrong about that.\r\n\r\nThe
  sample is from my partner's African teaching certificate. It's from Zambia, 1995.\r\n\r\nI
  really like the O and C forms, and the R is interesting as well.\r\n\r\nThe attached
  letters F, O and R are what I uploaded to \"What The Font\". The closest\r\nmatch
  I could identify was Storm Hercules, which seems to be identical with some letters\r\nbut
  slightly different with others (the tail of the R, and lacking the straight downward\r\ninside-part
  of the curves on the C and O - sorry I don't know the correct typographic terms).\r\n\r\nThis
  is my first post and I'm really looking forward to being impressed by all you typo
  experts...\r\n\r\n"

    have a very similar feel.

    and yes, they are both similar in feel, I agree, but there are differences.\r\n\r\nStorm
    Hercules is still the closest match I've seen, so far."

  body: "Thanks Lex and Florian. I have looked closely at your suggestions and I think
    Lex's Monotype Bodoni Bold is the winner as it seems to be a 99.5% match. \r\n\r\nAll
    letters match exactly, with the exception of the O and C which, at 34 point, are
    1mm narrower than those in my sample (slightly 'condensed' is the term, I think?).\r\n\r\nIt
    seems strange to me that two fonts would be identical in all but two letters,
    but that appears to be the case. (Incidentally, 24/26 = 92.3% match). Then again,
    I don't actually have the whole alphabet in my original, for comparison.\r\n\r\nBy
    the way, I can't seem to find that curly apostrophe anywhere...\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    thanks again, guys.\r\n\r\nTypo46"
