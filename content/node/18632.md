  and hoped to get feedback, but maybe it is kind of a corporate font and they won't
  pass the info out.\r\n\r\ni really want to know the name of this font:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.avenuea-razorfish.com/whatWeDo.htm\r\n\r\nthey
  use it for the navigation-buttons....\r\n\r\nmost of the pixelfonts i found are
  either only upper case, or to small in general.\r\n\r\nplease give me advice, or
  can you name a font which is similar?\r\n(pay attention to the 'a' which is like
  a futura 'a').\r\n\r\nalso, it has a <strong>BOLD</strong>  style.\r\n\r\nthank
  you so much!!!!\r\na."
