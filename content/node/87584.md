  from 5 February for the academic year 2011/12 I would like to apply for a three-month
  internship.\r\n\r\nI\_am currently pursuing\_my\_master's\_degree at the\_\xC9cole
  Estienne, Paris\_France.\_My second semester is going to be the study abroad semester.
  \r\nI have graduated\_with\_a\_Bachelor\u2019s\_degree of Arts\_from the National
  Institute of Fine Arts in Tetuan, Morocco.\_\L\L\r\n\r\nI am always\_inspired by
  different cultures and backgrounds. I\u2019m a native Arabic speaker that is to
  say, I have a firm knowledge of Arabic typography design and I'm also open to Latin
  typography because I live and study in France.\r\n\r\nSo if anybody has some good
  ideas on how I could get such an internship or if anybody is looking for somebody
  to do an internship, please let me know... \r\n\r\nthanx, \r\nRedone"
