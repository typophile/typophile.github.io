body: I'm designing my first font in illustrator which I will then take into Fontlab.
  The problem is I have given the font an 'inner outline'? and I now can't figure
  out how I did it.  It is all fill no stroke and is grouped into the top and bottom
  sections and their black outlines. The only things I remember doing are outline
  stroke, compound path and group ungroup. Here is the 'A'...Any illustrator gurus
  who can help? [img:sites/default/files/old-images/A_4521.jpg]

  body: it looks like I've used stroke but when I go inside the group it has no stroke
    only fill...I specifically got rid of the stroke so I could take it over to Fontlab...Once
    I figure it out I'm definitely writing it down! And I don't think I've used offset
    path before...thanks for the suggestions...
