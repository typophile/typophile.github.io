body: "I am creating a wordmark for a brand called \"Invisible Mothers\".\r\n\r\nI
  would like your opinions / critiques on which one you think works best, or if you
  have any suggestions on a font I should use.\r\n\r\nBackground:\r\nInvisible Mothers
  is a movement to help make mothers more visible in society. We often take Mothers
  for granted, so we will focus on the importance of mothers by launching a campaign
  to support these initiatives.\r\n\r\nHere are some samples I've created from different
  fonts:"

    and for an organization focused on mothers they don't seem feminine. And I don't
    care for the linking of the \"i\" and the \"t\" because it creates a focal point
    that's not interesting or meaningful. \r\n\r\nSorry to be so negative, but that's
    my first impression looking at them.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I agree with JamesM. It is a quite boring logo - nothing you haven't seen
    before. \r\nIf it was me, who was designing this ID/logo I would probably suggest
    something a little humorous. When i first saw this post I immidiatly thought of
    \"The invisble mothers\" as a group of superheroes very much like \"The Incredibles\".
    I would defentletly try to create something kind of superhero alike. "

  body: The name begs for incorporating a mother / motherly love / etc. reference
    into the neg space of the type. Ligatures look forced.

  body: "The phrase \"Invisible Mothers\" seems a little depressing to me. Like saying
    \"Forgotten Mom\" or \"Insignificant Mothers\". Seems to be reinforcing a negative
    to me.  Doesn't seem like it's a positive theme in the wordmark relating your
    message. Seems like \"Appreciated Mothers\", \"Visible Mom\" or \"Important Mothers\"
    is more along the theme you're wanting to promote...\r\n\r\nFor a font, maybe
    the newly released \"Cantoni\" would work:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/debi-sementelli/cantoni/

  body: None of them look particularly motherly. I think you need a more feminine
    or softer font.

  body: "If the point is to make mothers more visible, then why \"invisible\"? \r\n\r\nNone
    of the logo's is inspiring, actually they make me think of an ordinary movie or
    reality show.\r\n\r\nMy suggestions: \r\n\r\n- Don't \"stack\" the words on two
    lines, with same width, that looks too rigid. Let the words follow each other;\r\n-
    Stay away from predictable wishy-washy handwritten typefaces, unless it's masterfully
    well-done;\r\n- Try a font like the Aubade logo [[http://www.aubade.com/]]. It
    has a sense of style, with a feminine twist.\r\n- Maybe try to accentuate \"invisible\"
    (if the word makes sense to the brand) by leaving out certain elements of the
    word, a letter or the dots. Not sure this will work.\r\n- Maybe accentuate the
    \"o\". Phonetically, it's the name's \"centre of gravity\". Due to the round shape
    it is a more \"friendly\" letter. Try creating something within the \"o\", initials
    or whatever. An element being contained in a circle could communicate \"protection\"
    or belonging\"."

    time ago.
