  degree that I'm beginning to wonder if designers throw it in there just to boost
  sale. \r\n\r\nI just spotted <a href=\"http://www.typetrust.com/font/leituradisplay\">this</a>
  (the \"sp\"), and it doesn't make any sence to me. Especially since the l and i
  in \"uplift\" so obivously crash on the third line.\r\n\r\nArgh!"

    excessive [ ; ) ], but if it improves the reading experience, why not?\r\n\r\nProblem
    with the current flock of fonts with lots of ligs is that typesetters/designers
    don\u2019t stick with the rules, eg they use too much (pos or neg) tracking, which
    means that the (stationary) ligs stand out and distract. Of course typedesigners
    could program the OT\u2019s to change back to single characters in these cases,
    but I think that\u2019s a last resort\u2026\r\n\r\n. . .\r\nBert Vanderveen BNO"

    now. But that\u2019s not a bad thing; it gives us something to compare the good
    ones to, and some good ideas are certain to bubble up. And anyway, they\u2019re
    optional."
