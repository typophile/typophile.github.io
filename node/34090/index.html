  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi,

I'm looking for the ideal typeface to put my name - Benjamin Knight - in. I started by looking at the usual suspects... Helvetica and Univers and Futura etc. Heldustry wasn't bad. But they just don't look right. It might be that the particular combination of letters in my name just doesn't look good. Any help is much appreciated.

It'll be on letterheads and business cards etc etc. But also on - interlaced - tv screens... so best not to go thinner than medium weight, lest it disappear between pixels. Sans serif is probably better, but I could be talked round. I want something that looks reasonably slick and masculine; sort of the Michael Mann of typefaces.

Any ideas?

Thanks in advance,

Benjamin.</div>

BTW Benjamin, more than Trajan what I'm really suggesting is that "KN" metaligature*. If you like it, when you arrive at what font you'd like to use, I could easily make a glyph like that in that font (and being a type designer I would make it balanced and polished, which is harder than it might seem, except for the most modular of fonts). Cost: US$50.

		<div class="commentbody">The word MNEMONIC allows the quite satisfactory ligature og NE. Hrant's KN ligature is not bad at all. I wonder whether Benjamin Knight likes it.
Ligatures and 'nested' letters were used by Roman and Romanesque lettercutters to save space. Now we reinvent them and use them as design features. A clever student of mine, Massimiliano Frangi, found several in the Milan Cemetry. Here is one (EM, with a flipped E) from a relief Latin inscription that seems quite osé and probably dates back to the 1930s. How do you put images into this discussion?

This works very well. I think it is a step ahead of Hrant's interesting idea. What is needed now is a client called Mnemonic!

		<div class="commentbody">Firstly, a huge thank you to everyone who has posted; very cool. The idea that i, j and K suggest something italic is exactly the kind of design nous I was looking for. But would you advise the same if I went all uppercase?

Of the fonts suggested I like Sanuk the most. Maple is too cartoony for me. Malaga is nice too. Not sure it's been cracked yet though.

The whole metaligature discussion is really interesting, not sure if it works for this application though; I just saw a K at first and thought you'd missed out the N. Of course - like any illusion - once you've seen it you can't go back, but the fact that it took me a few seconds means it's probably not right for the tv screen instance I mention in my original post... it'll only be up there for a limited time.

But I was beginning to think about playing with the letters in some way... adapting them... beginning to think that there might not be a pure 'font solution'.

Thanks again for all your input. I'll keep working on it.

Benjamin.</div>

Always a good idea - in fact some people think a logo isn't one
if you can just type it up. Just don't go as far as the following!  :-)

As for the "mnemonic" exercise, I love the mental (optical?) gymnastics that these kinds of ligatures provoke.

Benjamin, have fun with it. There just aren't enough opportunities to be one's own client.
