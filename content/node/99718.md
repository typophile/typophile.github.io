  website</a> (including an all-new shop system) as well as our newest release, <a
  href=\"http://grillitype.com/typefaces/pressura\">GT Pressura</a>.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gt-pressura-font-6_4112.png]\r\n\r\n<a
  href=\"http://www.grillitype.com/typefaces/pressura\">GT Pressura</a>\r\nDesigned
  by <a href=\"http://www.moire.ch\">Moir\xE9</a>\r\n\r\nInspired by type stamped
  on shipping boxes, GT Pressura uses the visual effect of ink spreading under pressure
  as a stylistic device. The condensed sans serif alludes to a scientific background
  but with its rounded corners shows a soft and friendly side in larger sizes. With
  proportional and monospaced variants it is able to hit a wide range of notes whenever
  needed.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gt-pressura-font-6_5650.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Die-Totale-Aufklaerung-dta_cover_3465.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Keith-Tyson_4190.jpg]"
