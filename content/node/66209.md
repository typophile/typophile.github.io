  WhatTheFont and more than a few Google queries (I've tried searching the forum boards,
  but I get a missing page error every time that I do).\r\n\r\nThe first is the slab
  serif from the headline in the \"End of the Air War\" article on page 102 (in case
  you have a copy to consult)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wiredheadline_3730.gif]\r\n\r\nThe
  second is the body text from the same article (and what looks like most of the body
  from the rest of the magazine).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wired2010body_4354.gif]\r\n\r\nThanks
  so much!\r\n-JD"

    normal text size) or it's way too light (if it's set small).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
