  Racing . com. It seems close to Rockwell/Lubalin Graph but no cigars. If anyone
  knows this I would appreciate it.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1010290_468254476598321_1090575678_n_3754.jpg]'

  body: Thank you very much fvilanakis. How did you get it to find it with "Find my
    Font" it wouldn't work for me because of the perspective in the photo????

  body: "There is no need for external photo editors, Find my Font contains an interactive
    perspective correction tool, especially for these cases (it's the tool marked
    with \"ABC\").\r\nYou hold down the shift key to move the 4 corners of the tool
    to appropriate position, check the \"Fix Perspective\" checkbox [x] and click
    on [OK] button - that's all.\r\nYou get a perspective-corrected copy of the selected
    image and you can then select the letters you wish as usual. See the image bellow:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fmf-perspective_5437.jpg]\r\n"
