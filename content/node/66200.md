body: "I'm looking for some suggestions on a (somewhat) techy typeface suitable for
  an identity.\r\n\r\nI've been considering Klavika and Relato Sans, but I find the
  former a bit to rigdid and the latter might be unsuitable because I recently used
  it for a related firm. I'm not set on a sans serif. \r\n\r\nI've been toying around
  with the uppercase R in Relato (it has a straight \"crossbar\"-ish part of the bowl,
  similar to Auto) for the word mark, lining it's bowl up with other crossbars. I'm
  not sure if I'll follow through on that idea, but nevertheless I'd love some suggestions
  on typefaces with similarily constructed R's."

  body: Not stupid at all, Nina. Just logo/tagline - perhaps some other display use.
