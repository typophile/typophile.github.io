body: "Hello all,\r\n\r\nI'm one of those dreaded \"Graphic Designers\" who lacks
  an extensive background in typography. I try to tend to my type as well as I'm able,
  but I'm sure I've done some things that would shock and awe. That being said, I
  take my type as seriously as I can, and I like to refer to the experts whenever
  possible.\r\n\r\nI've got a particularly high profile client, who's looking for
  a wordmark, and I'm looking for a suitable typeface to accompany it. The budget
  is quite large, so I'm looking for as close a match as I can get. I'm looking for
  a serif typeface with a 19th century feel (preferably something designed recently)
  that pays particular attention to the upper and lower case Gs. I'm looking for something
  elegant, but that doesn't alienate. A typeface that looks good in a suit, but has
  been known to lounge in a t-shirt and jeans.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n-J."

    I may suggest it to the client."

  body: "> I\u2019m one of those dreaded \u201CGraphic Designers\u201D who ...\r\n\r\nIf
    you're here, then you're not.  :-)\r\n\r\nI thought your brief, although interesting,
    was a tough\r\ncall with that \"G\"/\"g\" requirement, but Andrade actually\r\nseems
    a great match! The thing is, if you think that \"G\"\r\nis not distinctive enough,
    I think I can safely say that\r\nyou won't find exactly what you're looking for,
    basically\r\nbecause it's very hard to find a funky UC \"G\" in a reserved\r\ndesign
    like you'd like...\r\n\r\nBut here's an idea: find a font that's as close a match
    as\r\nyou can find but without a funky \"G\", and get a designer\r\n-preferably
    the original one- to funketize it for you.\r\nOr actually, since it's for a logo
    and not text, you can\r\njust funketize it yourself! Just show us your work-in-\r\nprogress
    so we can tear it apart first.  ;-)\r\n\r\nOr what about this (from another current
    thread actually)?\r\nhttp://www.optimo.ch/pages/departement/index.php?id_categorie=1&id_font=9\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for your replies all. The art director agrees that Andrade is currently
    our best choice, perhaps borrowing a flourish from the ligatures to embellish
    the uppercase G. Quite an improvement from some of our original choices. We're
    going to be running it by the client to see what they think. Since you're all
    interested, I'll be sure to let you know where it goes.\r\n\r\nP.S. I wish myfonts.com
    gave you the option of kerning \u2014 or at least tracking \u2014 previews."
