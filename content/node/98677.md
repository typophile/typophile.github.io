  I would post it on here to see if anyone can help out. An interesting serif, indeed.
  Thanks in advance! \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/seriftext_5280.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typetest2_4740.jpg]"

  body: I inspected a <a href="http://dmy-berlin.com/downloads/festival_2012/DMY12-programm-web.pdf">PDF</a>
    in which the font is embedded. It proves to be a custom-made typeface called DMYMono;
    there is also a proportionally spaced version called DMYSerif. Both are probably
    not available to the general public and might have been designed or commissioned
    by <a href="http://www.xplicit.de/frameladen.html?1st_news/1st_news.html~xplicit">xplicit</a>.
