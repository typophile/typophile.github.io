  (DAAP) at the University of Cincinnati and was approached by my boss, the head librarian,
  who asked me to identify the font used in an email she received. She thought that
  I would be interested in the hunt because I am a graphic design student. However,
  I have exhausted my resources and cannot figure it out. Any help would be greatly
  appreciated. \r\nThank you. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/whatfont_5758]"

  body: "The Ghostscript fonts are open-source, I think, either GPL or AFPL. The AFPL
    does not allow commercial distribution, so as long as you don't sell the fonts,
    be it separate or bundled with other products/services, you should be in the clear.\r\n\r\nMind,
    you can use them to print books or magazines and sell <em>them</em>, no prob.
    Hacking on them is OK, too. The Arkandis Digital Foundry has produced a style
    kit for Classico, Garamond #8 and Palladio that gives you small caps and OS numbers.
    With this kit, you are getting close to semi-pro."
