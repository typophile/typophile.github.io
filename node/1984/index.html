<div class=commentbody>Hi Graham. <br> <br>I assume some of the unorthodoxy you are metioning is the absence of certain ball terminals. Some unorthodoxy is good. I think you've got some other issues though, mainly stroke modulation and color issues. <br> <br>Caps: <br>Seems like all of the thicks in your round letters could be thicker (they are all light) In the first line, check the CO vs the INRP etc. <br> <br>Your bracketed serifs are making dark spots. Thin them out a bit. Check the Z vs the Y <br> <br>G needs weight on the right side. <br> <br>LowerCase: <br>Again, rounds need more weight. Check out how dark the stem of the p is vs the round. Check all the rounds pqdbaeg etc. <br> <br>t: The weight gets too light too early as you move into the tail. <br> <br>g: Needs weight in the tail. <br> <br>Overall. It's ok if you don't want the ball terminals, but it leaves you with a problem. The ends of your letters are really weak. For example the sS should be as dark as the other letters. They aren't though. I suppose you could really thicken up the spine and leave off the terminals, but that's why they were put there in the first place. I guess what I'm getting at is: You must solve that problem. Maybe in an unorthodox way</div>

<div class=commentbody>Forgot to mention, as I was browsing around tonight I came across a similar idea at Peter Bilak's website: Didot Sans. It's under: type -> unpublished -> didot sans <br> <br><a href=http://www.peterb.sk/ target=_blank>http://www.peterb.sk/</a> <br> <br>He's done some funky things to try and compensate for color. Check out the E and F! Interesting, but in my opinion ugly. Maybe that's why it's unpublished :-) <br> <br>Randy</div>

<div class=commentbody>This is looking much more polished, although it's been "tamed" as well. It's like a calm, neutral serif face - uncommon. It feels like something in the spirit of Bookman, with an affinity for journalism. <br> <br>The glyphs that stand out: <br>- "J": needs a full curl. <br>- "g": needs to be more rigid. <br>- "&": very cool, but out of character. <br>- "7": very nice. <br> <br>Also, you need to decide if this is a text face or a display face. For the former I'd make it a bit darker and lengthen the ascenders; for the latter it's fine as it is. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Excellent suggestions from Hrant. I really enjoy the 'g', but <br>he's right - it's not for this face. <br> <br>No proper quotes? The comma sets a good shape. <br>Your lc 's' is upside-down. <br> <br>Keep it as display type. There is room for headline serifs.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Quotes look good. You still need a standard ampersand. <br>I think what Hrant meant by the 'J' is illustrated in <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/century-751/century-751/charmap.html target=_blank>Primer</a>. <br>Take a look at <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/century-751/century-751/mac-t1/140473/character/0073/CP4/1/ target=_blank>Primer's 's'</a> too. Yours looks wrong because <br>it's too top-heavy. Try shortening the top stroke so it doesn't <br>extend to the width of the belly. Good 'g'.</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>The "J" is better, but I'd make it narrower, and it does need some kind of terminal. A ball terminal (like in Primer) is one option, and for that I'd look at your "f" - although that's more of a "teardrop" terminal*. You could also try a serif (like in your "S") for a terminal. <br> <br>* Now I'm thinking maybe your "f" needs a ball terminal instead. <br> <br>The ampersand in your main character set is OK to me. <br> <br>The new "g" is almost there: it just needs to move the stroke weight in its tail to either the bottom or -more unconventionally- to the right. (And I'd avoid the common practice of putting weight in the horizontal part of the join.) <br> <br>The eszet seems too dynamic - try making that curvy part less curvy. <br>And to me a texty eszet benefits from an abrupt shift where the top curve starts going in. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I liked the first one better. Of course there are some rough <br>edges, but it has an original spirit. I think some of the <br>coolest stuff comes from people who are trying to figure <br>out what letters are 'supposed' to look like. Once they figure <br>it out, it looks like everything else. I think that's what <br>happened here. I think the super short serifs and miniature <br>ball terminals are great. However, I agree that the terminals <br>on C and the S from the first version need something.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanx for the remarks, and the first version is still there on my system. I will fix that one up as is sometime. I do agree with your view that this constant change to suit others opinions ends up (sometimes) changing a font too much. The idea that someone has can end up being blanded out of existance. Yes it is nice to have a good looking font, but you do need to retain the originality. This fonts changes, and suggestions, have so far been helpful, and in no way 'bland' it out. <br> <br>That said The attached is some of the changes made (and I am happy to make these changes, as the suggestions have been helpful) <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/23136.gif alt> <br> <br> <br></div>
