  body: It's definitely possible to look to key letters or specific earmarks to help
    identify typefaces. This method is probably the most common. It's the basis for
    <em>Rookledge's International Typefinder</em> (1983). For me it's almost always
    an overall impression or "gestalt" that I look for. It's like recognizing a face
    of or a voice, the way you can recognize someone you know even if they are in
    disguise. The drawback of my method is I can't identify any typefaces I don't
    know. One thing I can say is "I" and "O" are almost no help at all. :-)

  body: "I agree with Mark. When you attain that kind of perception, sometimes you
    can identify a face just by its color. Like knowing exactly if Times New Roman
    is on the page. I don't know if anyone could identify a typeface mainly due to
    its proportion \u2013 that'd be amazing.\r\n\r\nYou can go with a, c, n, o, g,
    r, k, f. But mostly it's the italic that gives away the answer."

  body: I think it differs per typeface. It depends on what letters characterise that
    specific typeface. But generally these will be letters like a, g, e, k, f, R,
    G, etc.

  body: "The lowercase g is certainly the most variable form from one typeface to
    another and probably gives the most clue to identification, but apart from stroke
    weight it can have very little relation to the rest of a typeface. \r\n\r\nOne
    lowercase h can look much like any other, but it has the detailed features of
    serifs and straight and arcing strokes that are replicated throughout much of
    the rest of the alphabet, and thus one can make a well reasoned guess at what
    the rest of a typeface might look like based on the h much more than you could
    with a g.\r\n\r\nSo, if one were to compare this to evidence gathering on a person,
    a g would be equivalent to a typeface's fingerprint, while the h would be like
    finding its skull."

  body: "I find lowercase y is the first letter I look at. Very distinctive in Minion,
    Centaur, Bembo Italic, Bliss and Perpetua. After that I probably go to lowercase
    t, which is distinctive in Arial, Gill Sans, Helvetica, Palatino, Scala, Georgia
    and, again, Minion. Lowercase g gives away Goudy Old Style, Meta, Baskerville
    and Perpetua Italic. Capital R is quite good for distinguishing sans and also
    sticks out a long way in Bembo and Trajan.\r\n\r\nWhile Times New Roman is \"obvious\",
    I struggle to find letters which give it away. Maybe the weird stress on the lowercase
    e or the not-very-italic-ness of the italic z."

    needed to distinguish the Monotype and Linotype versions of the typeface. I find
    that the uppercase L differentiates Times from many serif typefaces. Given what
    makes it \"obvious\", lowercase letters like b, that give away its x-height and
    its oblique stress, are perhaps the best bet; except for the capital Q, which
    it shares with some sizes of Caslon and several other typefaces, it indeed has
    no eccentric letter forms."
