  about to develop a new magazine. The Magazine is to be called \"Frizon\" and should
  present articles concerning law and crime. I want to use two different fonts in
  the magazine to start with. The magazine is thought to be liberal and rethinking.
  I would be glad if anyone here could help me to figure out two good fonts to use
  for the occasion. "
