body: "I'm designing a biz card and just had a question concerning the address block.
  The client has a PO Box and my question is; Is it correct to set 'PO' in small caps
  <em>and</em> set the word 'box' with a capital 'B' or should I set the entire word
  in small caps. Also, when setting an e-mail address on a biz card, is it necessary
  to type 'e-mail' in front of it? Is it something that is obvious or will it be confused
  with a web address? I personally would like to do without the 'e-mail' title for
  simplicity's sake. \r\n\r\nWelcome any and all input you may have. Thanks in advance.\r\n\r\nIM "

    po box question depends on context, styles, weights, overall block layout, \r\nany
    other uses of smallcaps ? does it stand out ? how many pieces of contact info
    need to appear, etc.\r\n\r\ni try to keep some sort of rhythm to the whole thing,
    with consistent weights,\r\nprefixes, labels (or not) so it all holds together.
    \r\n\r\ni prefer to leave off the word \"e-mail\" as it's usually self explanatory,
    \r\nas are phone numbers, but on occaision you have a list of several contact
    options:\r\n\r\noffice:  \r\ncell:  \r\nfax: \r\ne-mail:   \r\n\r\nin which case
    consistency suggests giving them all the same status, but you've got to balance
    simpicity with clarity. if one piece of info stands out as odd from the rest,
    there's probably a better way."

    So in this case, small caps PO, u&lc Box works.\r\n\r\nAs to business cards, simplicity
    is best. The less text you have, the easier it is to find what you are looking
    for without wading through it. People look at business cards specifically to find
    your email address, so they probably can identify it at first sight without a
    label."

  body: "Thanks everyone. This is just the right input I needed.\r\n\r\n<em>the po
    box question depends on context, styles, weights, overall block layout, any other
    uses of smallcaps?</em>\r\n\r\nThe reason I'm using small caps is because I'm
    using oldstyle numerals for the PO Box numbers, zip codes and telephone numbers
    to help with readabilty (the type is set in Freight Sans 8pt and it's a tightly
    spaced font).\r\n\r\n<em>Use small caps if the letters are meant to be read as
    letters, not as words. So in this case, small caps PO, u&lc Box works.</em>\r\n\r\nI
    Agree. I'll go with my original plan.\r\n\r\nThis is how the address reads (PO
    and PA will be set in small caps and all numbers will be oldstyle figures, I even
    chose that PO Box specificaly becuase the '6' ascends, the '9' descends and the
    '8' ascends making it easier to read at small sizes).\r\n\r\npo Box 1698\r\nReading,
    pa 19603\r\n\r\n<em>People look at business cards specifically to find your email
    address, so they probably can identify it at first sight without a label.</em>\r\n\r\nYeah
    you're right.\r\n\r\nThanks everyone, appreciate it.\r\n\r\nIM\r\n\r\n"

    thought of that, but I just felt it didn't work as well. I like the mixed settings

  body: But seriously, if he is planning to use oldstyle figures, the small caps will
    work as well. Even if for display, correct? If I remember correctly the old guys
    way back in the day used small caps/letterspaced uppercase for many things. There's
    nothing wrong with that in this case, is there?

  body: "Nothing <em>per vim</em> is wrong as long as the address on the business
    card can be used. My interpretation is based on the fact that an address will
    be made up of a selection of numerals and words and each word will be in title
    case. So to introduce another level, especially at the beginning of a line, might
    affect the harmony of the setting, more significantly it might also affect the
    usability of the card, while not gaining anything.\r\n\r\nTim"
