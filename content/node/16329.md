  note the slightly cracke-open _c_ and _e_\r\n\r\nI appreciate the aggresive banality,

  body: "W mag could easily have commissioned a custom font - have you ever seen it
    anywhere else?\r\n\r\n(of course it is IMPOSSIBLE to google this because \"W\"
    and \"magazine\" and \"font\" give you almost 2 million hits. I just read that
    it is also impossible to google the band The The for much the same reason)\r\n\r\nJoshua
    Darden and Matius Gerardo Grieck have designed custom fonts for W but I'm not
    sure if this is one of either of theirs."

    type designer, some of whose work is available from Elsner + Flake. A brief poke
    around the E+F site was hugely unhelpful, so I can't find his name.\r\n\r\nHopefully
    this is a helpful start?"
