body: "im converting fonts over from post script to OTF and am having trouble when
  enabling them via ATM. When theyre in post script format the styles seem to fall
  under their parent type face (ie: univers selected in an app would have 55,65 etc
  under the style catagory). Now when i convert them to OTF each style becomes its
  own font family (ie: Univers 55, Univers 66 acting as 2 different fonts with only
  1 style being normal/plain). How do i go about converting them to OTF while keeping
  the font names and styles intact? or how do i solve this problem?\r\n\r\nThanks
  for the help!"
