  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I know that for some languages, there are specific rules as to when a ligature should be used. In German for instance it is said that ligatures should not be used for compounds or where a word&rsquo;s stem and its prefix are connected. A common example would be the word &ldquo;Auflauf&rdquo;: no fl-ligature because it is a compound from &ldquo;auf&rdquo; and &ldquo;lauf&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are quite a few typefaces that would just look stupid if one wouldn&rsquo;t use the ligatures as the spacing is set up in a way that assumes that whenever a ligature could be used it will be used - try to look at &ldquo;Auflauf&rdquo; in Minion-Itallic without the fl-ligature.</p>
<p>My personal assumption would be to just do away with the guideline that says to not use the ligature and use whatever looks best. Manually adjusting the kerning so that the characters do not clash looks even worst (at least in my experiments). How are others handling these situations?</p>

<p>It not about looks! It&rsquo;s about reading. Most Germans would read &ldquo;Au-flauf&rdquo; if you set it with a ligature. 
You are right, there are typefaces which create a huge gap if you don&rsquo;t use the ligature. But that doesn&rsquo;t change the rules. From the standpoint of the type designer it would be a good idea to include a language-specific fl-glyph or even better: a contextual (shorter) f.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks Ralf,. The discussion in the thread you pointed to was quite interesting.</p>
<p>My personal conclusion would be that the rule should be considered in the context of the type face to which it is being applied. There will be cases where the rule works just fine and where an adjustment of spacing yields good results. In other cases, not using ligatures may produce really ugly collisions (and thus negatively impact legibility) and (or) adjusted spacing may produce large gaps  (which again would deter legibility). In such cases I&rsquo;d say using the ligature and breaking the rule (or guideline) might be the lesser evil.</p>

<p>I think you should consider it again. The problem of no dictionary support for ligatures in German language leads to the strategy of avoiding the usage of ligatures at all.</p>
<p>BTW: Ligatures are no solution for fixing wrong designed or spaced base glyphs. This flaw makes a lot of fonts unuseable for good German typography.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Andreas,
I agree that avoiding ligatures completely could be an unfortunate consequence of not having the correct ligatures for German in the first place. There were multiple issues that prevented us from just &ldquo;doing it right&rdquo; for German, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complexities around determining the correct solution for script faces or faces with many ligatures. Would some ligatures be considered part of the design and be wrong if disabled?</li>
<li>Lack of dictionary support. We don&rsquo;t have data to work from.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, I think that maybe some mechanism similar to adding custom words or custom hyphenation points to the user dictionaries could be considered here.</p>
<p>In the mean time, you can insert a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;non-joiner&rdquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->U+200C<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) between components. Not a great solution, but you can use find change and replace &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->auflage<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; with &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->auf^jlage<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; in this particular example. Menu: Type &gt; Insert Special Character &gt; Other.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The technical possibilities aside, the fact remains that there are type faces, which are incompatible with the rules for ligature use in some languages (German in this case).</p>
<p>I would argue, that this incompatibility does only exist in type face that are designed in a way where ligatures imply too strong a connection of the individual characters they are representing. After all, there is no implied semantic in a standard ligature related to the word of which it is a part. Thus, if we accept what is implied by this rule, namely that ligatures that connect characters very strongly imply additional semantic, this would mean that such type face, as beautiful as they may be (e.g. Garamond) are in some way flawed. At least if you follow the reasoning behind the German ligature rules.</p>
<p>Of course, typography like language is part of cultural development and thus is is perfectly acceptable that typographers of different languages arrived at different conclusions concerning the question of how much semantic a standard ligature carries. It would also very much depend on the type-faces they looked at in order to form that conclusion. Nevertheless, now that typography is a much more globalized thing, it may indeed be time to re-evaluate such conclusions.</p>
<p>If you accept that a ligature implies semantic relationship, you can also find english examples that may be a problem. Examples I could come up with in short time are &ldquo;elflike&rdquo; and &ldquo;selfless&rdquo; (in Garamond Premiere):</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/liga_5602.jpg]</p>
<p>Thus whenever a type face&rsquo;s ligatures make german &ldquo;auflegen&rdquo; &ldquo;au flegen&rdquo; or &ldquo;aufl egen&rdquo; they also make &ldquo;selfless&rdquo; into &ldquo;sel fless&rdquo; or &ldquo;selfl ess&rdquo;. Thus, you would have to conclude that such a type face isn&rsquo;t fully usable in either language.</p>
<p>I personally think the people that made the typefaces had a better understanding of how the characters and ligatures are perceived than the people that came up with the rules for ligature use (this is an assumption). Hence if in doubt, I&rsquo;d rather trust the type.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The worst typographic (actually: type design) sin I know and hate is, when the basic design of the font has a narrow f <!-- raw HTML omitted -->per se<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that would not collide with either i or l, and type designers fill the MacRoman&rsquo;s fi/fl ligature slots with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->connected<!-- raw HTML omitted --> glyphs. ACK!</p>
<p>This is a perversion of the idea of ligatures where collision is remodelled. Here, naturally, if you don&rsquo;t want to leave the encoding slot empty, just use a glyph composite of f and i, as if they would follow each other when set normally.</p>
<p>These forcedly connected f-i ligatures have usually an upper arc of the f which is -naturally- way to wide for the design idea of the whole alphabet and strikes the eye immediately. An other mistake is, though this happens with &ldquo;legitimate&rdquo; ligatures as well is when the stems of the f and the i the ligature do not fit the overall rythm of the font.</p>

<p>To speak from my experience, I think the opposite is true: fl/fi ligatures are switched on by default (in InDesign, that is). And people are lazy. Therefore, most of the time we’ll end up with ligatures for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->all<!-- raw HTML omitted --> instances, whether correct or not.</p>
<p>Ralf said: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Most Germans would read “Au-flauf” if you set it with a ligature.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I’m skeptic. Yes, it’s a problem. And yes, it’s not very nice. On the other hand, people are not stupid machines. I’ve read texts with incorrect ligatures without having serious difficulties. Admittedly, sometimes I get stuck. But I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->always<!-- raw HTML omitted --> get stuck and have to read the line again when the typesetter wanted to do it overly correct and added (too much) extra white-space, like in Lars’ example #3.</p>
<p>The solution is having a ‘short f’, be it by default or as an alternate.</p>
<p>And: there will always be ambiguous words, like be-inhalten [to contain] — bein-halten [to hold a leg], or the notorious Röſchenhof—Röschenhof. Or would you use a diaeresis for ‘beïnhalten’ and a long s for the latter? ;-)

<p>I always thought that the rule is that you don&rsquo;t make a ligature with two letters between which you are allowed to hyphenate.  For instance, if I look at the German wiktionary <a href="http://de.wiktionary.org/wiki/Auflauf">http://de.wiktionary.org/wiki/Auflauf</a>, I see:</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/auflauf_5982.jpg]</p>
<p>and there is hyphenation between Auf and lauf. It seems to me the data is readily available. Am I mistaken?</p>

<p>What about homographs, though, like &ldquo;beinhalten.&rdquo; That would probably be very difficult to code for.</p>
<p>But then don&rsquo;t hyphenation engines have to compensate for homographs somehow?</p>

<p>Michel, I’m afraid it’s not as easy as that. 
You don’t use a ligature across <!-- raw HTML omitted -->morpheme<!-- raw HTML omitted --> borders.</p>
<p>In a word like ‘treffen’ [to meet, to hit], you are allowed to hyphenate between the ‘f’s, but there may be a ligature, too.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>A heuristic that could potentially work would be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get the hyphen points for a word. e.g.  auf-lauf tref-fen</li>
<li>For each hyphen point, see if the letters before the break &amp; the letters after the break constitute legal words (the spelling dictionary would be used here). e.g. &lsquo;auf&rsquo;+&lsquo;lauf&rsquo;, &lsquo;tref&rsquo;+&lsquo;fen</li>
<li>If both parts are legal words, then assume that there shouldn&rsquo;t be a ligature there.</li>

		<div class="commentbody">Given all that has been said in this and previous discussions, and especially Florian&rsquo;s comment:
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->fl/fi ligatures are switched on by default (in InDesign, that is). And people are lazy. Therefore, most of the time we’ll end up with ligatures for all instances, whether correct or not<!-- raw HTML omitted -->,
the suggested use of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->non-joiner<!-- raw HTML omitted --> character looks like a good solution: Apply ligatures globally, and manually deal with the few cases where no ligatures are desired.
