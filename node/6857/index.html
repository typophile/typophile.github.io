		<div class="commentbody">OK, here's an amateur disagreeing.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Times New Roman is a great text face. Like Caslon, Baskerville or Garamond it will not wear out its welcome. It is just often wrongly used. For example on American letter size paper it, as a very condensed face, produces lines that are way longer than ideal. According to Bringhurst, the ideal is around 66 characters per line, and Times at 12 pt on letter paper with one inch margins is way longer than this. Courier is actually better on such a long line.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Minion is a Garamond with large x-height and also quite condensed, which is perhaps why it is so useful and used. Is it too condensed?

		<div class="commentbody">JFP, you beautifully describe Minion. Thanks! Your observation that Slimbach's ambition was to be usable where Times is usable is insightful.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I didn't mean to say that Minion was a copy of Garamond, only that Garamond seems to be its point of departure; it has calligraphic touches and opens up the a and e, etc. But there is still a noticable resemblence to Slimbach's Adobe Garamond - a more beautiful face, but not as adaptable. 'Myfonts' classifies Minion as 'Garald', which I guess is the term I should have used.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As you are the designer of very impressive Sabon Next, I would love to hear what you think are the strengths and weaknesses of Minion! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hrant, of course Courier is not a text face. It is a typewriter face, but I find it telling that it is still widely used on letter sized paper. I much prefer the European A4 paper, which is narrower; but even it is wide. I would be interested whether Courier is still used in Europe for legal work, etc. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think there is a gap for some enterprising designer to do a better very wide face for correspondence on letter or A4 paper.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">55 to 65 characters per line is the result of readability studies from the 60s and 70s, but also of the work from Jan Tschichold before that and even before the old Italian typesetters did it right intuitively. It has been proven that, because we read not single letters but by jumping in saccades over the printed page, that too short lines and too long lines are obstacles for the reader. Although this depends strongly on the content (a lexicon could have shorter lines as you're not reading a longer line but scan for information, a letter could have longer lines because it is shorter than a book text and &ndash; sometimes &ndash; more personally involving) and proportion of the medium itself, the basic rule applies to letter-sized and A4-publications as well, which is why on a standard letter page I almost never use the full width but try to proportionally find a good place for 55 to 75 cpl :-).  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And yes, Courier is, if the margins are chosen correctly, pretty much exactly 55 to 65 characters per line on A4 in 12 pt. It's not a highly accurate prophecy of the printed page, though, as Courier and such are monospaced and a proportional typeface will behave a bit differently &ndash; but I think all in all it's a solid enough guess to work practically. But of course you can achieve the very same effect these days with any other proportional font by just modifying the size margins accordingly &ndash; it's nicer to read and you can actually use a proportional font (the text will, of course STILL flow differntly in Quark and InDesign, but at a Word-Document using the same typeface and the same characters per line should be just as accurate, if not even moreso than the Courirer-technique.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Courier, these days, is best use ironically and, of course, it's perfect if you want to make a letter look as if written by some kind of bureaucracy &ndash; people actually read a letter printed in such a shabby Courier-Font more intensely asthey suspect/expect that it's official :-).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">joseph, i agree overall. helvetica is not really meant to perform as a text face though i've seen it done well in lighter book weights. over all it's a great workhorse though because it walks the line between text face and display face. this makes it great for setting headers as well as moderate amounts of copy.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my point here though is that there is a classicism in the realm of design that is so often over looked or missed. this happens when people so easily drop something because it's not cool anymore. the beauty of helvetica is that it's already been not cool for such a long time. so much so that it's become an ambiguous part of the world and it's communication. there's a lot to be said for a typeface that has worked itself so deep into the fabric of communication that it goes unnoticed. saying helvetica is overrated is like saying bread is overrated.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I don't think I agree with you there, Jay. To the best of my knowledge, Helvetica has never really been so uncool. Yes, people stopped using it for a bit in the 90s, but now it is as cool as ever! It is back as the most trendy typeface. IMO, Helvetica is loaded with meaning, as the de facto Swiss modernist typeface. If you need something classic and somewhat invisible and neutral, Univers is a better choice, I think, not Helvetica. Semantically, I think, Helvetica conveys a yuppie lifestyle. We see it a lot in Vancouver, because it's a yuppie city! It's trendy! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Helvetica is not really suitable for setting continuous text at all. The letters were designed so that they wouldn't cohere well together - they are so individual and self-contained. The forms are terribly homogenous, making word recognition rather tough. Helvetica is simply not a good everyday workhorse. There are too many jobs that it won't do well in. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think serif types are more invisible to the average reader. They don't notice it as much. If you use a sans, then they immediate associate it with 'modern'.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">keith, helvetica was designed in the mid 1950's it is the predecessor to typefaces like adrian frutiger's univers. it was an attempt to create something to compete in europe with akzidenz grotesk. it was the typeface to end all typefaces in the 1960's and 70's then it fell out of use in the 80's because it was so popular. only to come back into use in the late 1990's because of the post modern aesthetic. now with the revival of modernism it has maintained a foothold with young designers because it is such a call back to institutional design of the past. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->as far as it's robust use there are many older and wiser typographers then you or i that would disagree with you. the fact is that it has been used to set copy countless times. i agree with you that it's not the best text face out there but it's got a pretty damn good track record for a san serif. and that's not really open for debate.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think the very reason why Helvetica was so popular was because it had a hell lot more attitude than the humble Univers, which was a contemporary essentially (they're just a few years off). It wasn't something to compete with Akzidens Grotesk as such, but a 'new and improved' version of it (with all the nice bits stripped out). In a way, Univers could have been as popular as Helvetica if it was only a functional universal typeface that designers were after. But IMO, it wasn't like that. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Is Helvetica robust? Of course not. There are a lot more robust typefaces than it. The counters are not very open, therefore it's prone to confusion. Sadly, they are used a lot for directional signage (e.g. Vancouver street signs) and it's not the best choice, functionally speaking. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A typeface with a good track record doesn't mean that it's necessarily an inherently good typeface. It just sold well and it was just one of the few that was available on most typesetting machines. Letraset also made a lot of Helveticas (I have a whole drawerful under my desk right now). It was a default font on the Mac. So it's never the sheer goodness of a typeface that makes it popular. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; to compare kievit to helvetica is a bad comparison it's like comparing &gt; optima to futura. one is ultra humanist while the other is ultra &gt; geometric. it's like apples and oranges. you may like oranges better &gt; but they don't compare well out side of your bias. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Really? I don't think so somehow. Kievit is a much 'better' typeface for reading of any long continuous text than Helvetica, because of its humanist forms - the letters flow into each other effortlessly. So, when you have a criteria established (say, compare Kievit and Helvetica for the setting of the contiouous text for an entire book) then of course the result is obvious.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">helvetica is much more popular then universe because it is a better typeface. i love adrian frutiger and he's a great type designer but univers falls short. it just looks awkward. it ,as well as helvetica, were reaching for the same thing and helvetica just did a better job of achieving it. like i said before i think this is apparent in it's track record and wide usage. granted i can jive with the whole &quot;80% of the world likes brittney spears but that doesn't mean she's good, thing&quot; but i just don't think that pertains here and i'm amazed that anyone would even go there. i mean for god sakes we are talking about helvetica here aren't we. it's kind of like saying the beatles suck because the never played heavy metal. but yet heavy metal owes everything to the beatles. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is helvetica robust? yes. the counters are as open as i've seen in a long time. i'm not sure what cut or weight you're looking at, but damn it's pretty open in there. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->like i said before comparing a lineal humanist to a lineal geometric is drastic and you'd have to be stupid in the head to think that a geometric face sets better for running copy then a humanist face but that's not my point. my point is and has been that helvetica is a great all around face it sets better then any other face we've talked about for display and does a pretty bang up job at setting moderate amounts of text in book weight.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">If Helvetica is popular, then it hasn't disappeared into the subconscious of the populous. &mdash; Helvetica is decent enough for annual reports and brochures, but not for books. &mdash; Let us all dust off our copies of Stanley Morison's &quot;First Principles of Typography&quot; (I know you have a copy, admit it!) &mdash; People were (are) often confused about what Mr. Morison was talking about. He himself had to clarify, years later, that he was indeed talking about typography for books. &mdash; I think that it is important to qualify and clarify &quot;what kinds of typography&quot;.  &mdash; I have to agree with Keith (and Hrant). Helvetica isn't good for long setting of type. Now. I also think that Jay would agree with that. I'm trying to read between the lines here. Helvetica is not a good read. I'd go bonkers. Doing research on the use of space in typography yielded some very painful reads when I started to cover the swiss time period. M</div>

		<div class="commentbody">helvetica's counters are much more open than either gill sans or myriad. look inside the a and e. this is in part due to the fact that helvetica has such a robust x-height. helvetica is also much more metric lending itself toward a more open letterform. as far as univers is concerned it looks to be very close to helvetica's openness (which is what i would have guessed) i'd call it a draw. but even here you can tell how much more proportional and nice helvetica is.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Again I think we are talking about two different things. The measured openings of the shown letters are much larger for Gill (Myriad) than they are for Helvetica (Univers). However, the lc a (Hel) is pinched and so appears less open that does the Univers. The modulation in the Univers characters (as Keith pointed out) humanize the shapes. Myriad is just plain open. Gill, well, I have a personal soft spot for Gill. Yes, it is a quirky little face and yes the lc a is somewhat odd (as is the g), but it does have modulation (humanist) in it's favor.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">no in fact readability becomes subjective too in ways. if you had been brought up reading san serif you would prefer it to serifs. the germans for instance used to read in black letter not roman and became very accustom to it. the fact is that the human mind is adaptable and over a brief period of time it can learn to read any style of type fluidly. readability is only slightly less of a weak argument to subjectivity because it takes a bit longer to change patterns we are already accustomed to. any one born from the 1950's on has come across a fair amount of both serif and san serif type as text and can handle themselves quite well in both arenas. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and as far as saying there is no such thing as a typeface that can walk the line between display and text&hellip; please. you probably also believe that a chair can't be stood on but only sat on. that's pretty limiting and dry.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think you're both right, in a way. If it is legibility you're after, then Tschichold still is the right source to go to. If you typeset a book, you cannot do any better than with the rules he came up with as they're based on the experience of the hundreds of years of printing and setting books since the Renaissance. And Fraktur has gone down the drain because it is LESS readable, sorry &ndash; the oh so distinctive letterforms are a pain in the arse, frankly, they're TOO inividual and different and thus went away (well&hellip; that and that Hitler dude finally found out that his effing glorious new German letters actually were based on a Jewish calligraphic form (Schwabacher Judenletter) and thus went back to the classic Roman form in the 40s).  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->However, type is also about conveying and expressing or even evoking emotion, and here is where Tschichold, Morris and many other traditionalists fail us when we're trying to get the job done. Surprising the reader, shoking him, evoking an emotional response is exactly the contrary of what typography in Tschicholdian sense was all about. Instead of being a neutral faceless conveyor belt that doesn't react or interpret or even interact and play with the text he's given, we're suddenly in a very different arena of intuitive and emotional exploration&hellip; in the world of the Fleckhausen and Weingart and, yes, David Carson and all those before and after him.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So while Typography in the narrow sense is a craft that ONLY is concerned with legibility, these days I'd opt for deciding what the ACTUAL JOB is &ndash; conveying information or emotion &ndash; and thus decide if legibility is my main concern or just maybe something else. And there still is a world of differnece between the pro who breaks the rules but still obviously does so with purpose and a guy like Carson, who doesn't know the rules but was so gifted that for a time it didn't really matter much at all and finally those guys who don't know the rules and aren't gifted either and who hurt our eyes with bad flyers and leaflets and posters and CD Covers&hellip;  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->:-)</div>

But there's an interesting line between feeling comfortable with something in the short term, versus benefiting from a change in the long term. What I'm saying is that getting used to blackletter might help eventually - in a similar way that learning FontLab is a good idea even for long-time Fontographer users. And really, for the blackletter revival that I have in mind, all you'd need is an open mind. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; Whether the argument that distinctive letterforms actually enhance legibility might be argued as well <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Well, you can't doubt that information is conveyed through contrast (difference). On the other hand, a given glyph can indeed be too &quot;distinctive&quot;, and it's very interesting -and fruitful- to consider how these opposing forces balance. My own stance is this: as long as a glyph doesn't distract you into saccading to it from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->another<!-- raw HTML omitted --> line, or regressing to it after you've already read past it, it's fine. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; Functionality &hellip; isn't everything. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Agreed 100%. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But I'm totally opposed to the &quot;there is no bad type&quot; relativism. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jay, I would ask you to please: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1) Calm down. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2) Open your eyes to the hypercomplexity of human nature. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; no one cares about typography anyway <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is essentially true. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Graphic design in general. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">In response to HD and Tiffany I must say that it truely is about the expression and the concept in communication. Does the typography fit the message?  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have questioned the importance of what we read. If what you are reading is interesting to you, I have no doubt that you will be able to read it. I used to read really cheap paperback imprints of classic novels. Was the typography good? No, but I was interested in the content, and that was enough. As was stated earlier its the message (the reading of it), not the typography that dictates readability.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->On the relativism note, I think that to say relativism isn't a valid form of critique, even in relation to history is to deny all valid philisophical thought of the last half century. More importantly it denies the nature of design and communication in the modern world. Nobody wants to limit our communication options to the Bible (in blackletter) the way it was before relativistic thought. Relativism has given us the power to value certain things above others. A privilage we all obviously cherish. The key to relativism is to know when it is a valid approach to criticism, and when a more concrete and formal approach works better. But then it would be a good idea for anyone to learn how to approach critique in an intelligent and informed way.</div>

Shouldn't I take the time to apply what I know and understand? &mdash; Yeah, craftmanship, what a novel idea. &mdash; John. You're right.

		<div class="commentbody">We ALWAYS care because we are designers/typographers. Why have text at all if we don't expect anyone to read it? Craftsmanship is the heart of graphic design and typography. Whatever happened to it? I expect every bit of text that I design to be read. Yes, there are times when text is just 'art' or 'illustration', but more often than not we use text because there's something we need to communicate. And I know I have to make every effort to making it 1. legible and/or readable; 2. typographically correct; 3. reproduces well technically; 4. appropriate for its purpose; 5. inviting to read; 6. visually pleasing, etc, etc. Not in any particular order. If we don't even care if some text is going to be read or not, then we're not doing our job properly. I 'design' a Microsoft Word template the same way I design a book. There's no difference except maybe the context of use and the limitations of the software. I pay attention to details no matter how trivial the task might be. That makes me a designer (though I admit I'm more of a typographer than a 'cool' graphic designer&hellip; :-P )</div>

The thing is, I just don't feel comfortable with the Bain &amp; Shaw explanation. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Unless I'm missing something (and I might well be, as I have only the comments in this thread and the results of some late night googling to go on), the Bain &amp; Shaw argument just doesn't ring true - it seems so unlikely. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What they appear to be saying is that in order to communicate with people who were not used to blackletter, the nazis dropped the use of blackletter, not only for documents intended for foreign populations, but so completely that they had to make up a lie about  blackletter being jewish in origin (a lie that could only make them look foolish given the fact that they had previously promoted blackletter). <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(continued&hellip;) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Now in many cases, documents intended for foreign populations would have had to be translated to the local language anyway, so why not just drop blackletter for documents which were not in German. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This act would have been far more practical, could have been easily explained from the nazi point of view (inferior foreigners not capable of comprehending superior german letterforms) and wouldn't have required the nazis to pretend to admit to have been fooled into adopting a part of jewish culture. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Bain &amp; Shaw explanation, then, will need to come up with some pretty compelling evidence to convince anyone that the extraordinary events they describe did actually happen.

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;&gt;You are making all these arguments without having read the book <!-- raw HTML omitted -->True, but I've been very open about that, and the arguments I've made have been in the form of questions raised. The way the position offered by Willberg in Bain &amp; Shaw's volume was presented in earlier posts it seemed to me that either something was not being said (which is why I've ordered the book - so I can see the arguments for myself) or that the position was dubious. Now, remember, other posts in this thread mentioned an alternative explanation, and I would like to know more about that. I can't be satisfied that I have any idea of the truth of the matter unless I have at least given both sides a fair hearing. Part of that process is to question everything and consider the answers. You can rest assured that if I ever manage to find some research that goes against Willberg's view, I will be equally questioning and dubious about that.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;&gt;What is this? The Bain and Shaw book is not a study attempting a popular understanding <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You have read my comment out of context. This was part of a small aside to Hrant suggesting that a revival of blackletter may be helped along by its role in an interesting historical situation. If, as you suggest, this was not the case, then so be it. I never suggested that it should concern Bain &amp; Shaw whether or not the truth was intereting to a wider audience, and I would never suggest that one should twist the truth to make it interesting.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>
