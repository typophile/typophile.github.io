    the G is very like Futura but that extended flat R and the chiselled caps heads
    on the A's definitely aren't futura.....\r\nAny ideas!\r\nLook forward to hearing
    from you detectives!\r\nThanks.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/numriser0002_4701.jpg]"

  body: "Kevin said \"Milton Demibold and Melbourne Serial appear to be the same typeface.\"\r\nTrue,
    and both are perhaps based on a font designed by Tony Geddes in 1968 and produced
    by Monotype as Musketeer [img:sites/default/files/old-images/MusketeerExtraBoldAsBOYARDS_4294.gif]
    \ http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/musketeer/\r\nDoes anyone have more information
    on the provenance of this design?\r\nDon"

    have similar proportions on the B and R? Bellini and Progreso could also be precursors,
    and date from the same general period.\r\n\r\nAnd they all derive from hand-lettered
    poster design from the turn of the century (c. 1900)...."

  body: "True enough Kevin. I would also include the P22 PanAm font which is based
    on lettering for the PanAm games of circa 1900.\r\nActually my question was focused
    on the Tony Geddes design of 1968 and whether it was created from scratch influenced
    by sources such as you mentioned, or whether there was an actual alphabet before
    then, perhaps as a font or perhaps as a published lettering alphabet.\r\nPerhaps
    there is someone reading this post who has some information?\r\nDon"
