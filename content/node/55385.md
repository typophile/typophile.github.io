  Veer offer are across the board. MyFonts offers a fair 65% by default, while others
  go down to 35%, and possibly lower.\r\n\r\nShort-term self-interest would dictate
  that a designer or foundry should get onto as many sites as possible, at whatever
  royalty rate they offer. But, this would seem to be bad strategy for the type designer
  community in the long-term, because a type site that offers designers/foundries
  a higher royalty ends up at a financial and competitive disadvantage to a site that
  offers less. This is because they make far less money per sale. So, in the long
  run, the type sites offering designers and foundries the lower rates, are the ones
  who will survive and thrive, thereby undermining designers and foundries.\r\n\r\nOver
  time, designers and foundries accepting lower rate therefore undermine their own
  financial self-interest, and that of the entire type designing community, by putting
  those offering them the highest royalties out of business, as higher-earning type
  sites are able to pay for the advertising and technology to grow their business
  at the expense of others.\r\n\r\nSo, my question is: do people agree? and do type
  sites offering lower royalties have any justification at all for their lower royalties
  other than pure economic selfishness? Do they offer anything that a site offering
  a higher royalty does not? And if indeed, accepting lower royalties is bad for designers
  and foundries, should designers and foundries band together to protect their interests?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    than what the basic rate offers. For instance, if I sell through MyFonts I get
    a higher royalty than Fontshop, but if I sell through Fontshop I get the benefit
    of Fontshop\u2019s international direct sale, international sales partnerships
    and the benefits of Fontshop\u2019s international marketing. And some vendors
    might pay a lower royalty on their direct sales, but a much higher royalty on
    fonts re-sold through a third party. Finally, when working with a foundry that
    pays a lower royalty, one can often get help testing and finishing production
    on the font\u2014specialized labor that their staff may do much more efficiently
    than a single designer working alone."

    not all of us are old farts with decades of experience. When starting out it\u2019s
    easy to miss design details, get diacritics wrong, miscalculate OS/2 and HHEA
    values, botch the naming, and so on. In my mind it\u2019s worth giving up some
    money to have help from someone who knows what he is doing. That allows a designer
    to build a good reputation from the start, as opposed to being that guy who has
    to fix his fonts and post an updates every other time a customer finds problems.
    Were your first fonts perfect?"

    Puckett, if you don't know how to do all of that stuff you list, why not hire
    someone to advise you on it, or do it for you. Is that work worth giving away
    50 or more percent on the royalties of the design?\r\n\r\nYes its easy to miss
    details when your new to this, but hammering away at it until you get it right
    does give you the experience to maybe do it a little better the next time. It
    is a process you know.\r\n\r\nMy fonts did not start out perfect, nor are they
    perfect today, not with \"best practices\" changing as new applications get released.\r\n\r\nFor
    my clients, I've looked at and fixed many others designers work over the years,
    and trust me, font quality and design reputation have nothing to do with one another.
    So don't be so afraid of updates, fonts are software, and all that software stuff
    has to get updated now and again.\r\n\r\nI went the foundry route when I started,
    and release several designs through ITC. What a laugh riot that has been these
    last 15 years or so. Those 20% royalties (up from the 10% ITC used to pay) really
    add up to a revenue stream that just about feeds my cats. When you see 95 cents
    as your take on an individual font sale, you quickly realize that your well-being
    is far down the list of whoever is selling your work.\r\n\r\nSelling licensing
    exclusively, on my own, pays me a respectable income, I know where every font
    goes, I have a personal relationship with most of the people who license my fonts,
    which allows me to be flexible and respond to their needs. Like adding additional
    glyphs, or allowing them to do things prohibited by our EULA. \r\n\r\nI guess
    I'm different than most type designers in that I like doing business. Drawing
    type and making fonts is great, but so is negotiating a large enterprise license.
    And when that large enterprise license gets sold, I get the money. (my lawyer
    gets some as well).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    royalty percentage that distinguish distributors. Beyond marketing and promotion,
    each retailer has a different audience, sales/support staff, reputation, and policy
    for accepting and presenting fonts.
