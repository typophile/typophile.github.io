body: Greetings <BR>This is for a conference focusing on women&#39;s political issues
  scheduled for Boston to coincide with the Democratic nominating convention.  <BR>The
  information I received from the client was basically asking for something professional
  but not super traditional -- a tiny bit edgy is okay with them. The magenta is a
  color they asked for &#40;the other color they like is a really lemon-y yellow,
  close to process yellow, which makes me think of a bedspread my sister had in 1977&#41;.
  <BR>These are a couple of ideas I put together to get started. Fonts used are Akzidenz
  and Hitchcock &#40;clumsily modified&#41;. <BR> <BR>Does anyone have advice or suggestions
  on the design? Thanks in advance, I value your opinions.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/37478.jpg"

  body: Quite different in character. I think the top design conveys the title better
    and would be taken more seriously &#40;if that&#39;s a factor&#41;. The &#34;A-star&#34;
    is a great concept, but the awkward star-point that is created is bothering me.
    I think I&#39;d rather just see the star-point creating the &#34;A&#34; rather
    than awkwardly joining with it. Nice designs. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott

  body: I like your designs. One thing though, the hand in the second design looks
    quite masculine. It also has a Black Panthers feel to it. Which might be just
    fine depending upon how &#34;revolutionary&#34; the women are and what political
    issues they are representing. <BR> <BR>Not knowing the applications for the logo
    it&#39;s hard to say for sure, however I think your choice of magenta &#40;over
    yellow&#41; is a safe one. If the logo is being printed small, on a brochure for
    example, the yellow could get lost.

  body: 'The top logo says: Stability. The bottom logo says: Radicals. What is the
    groups&#39; makeup? Are they a DAR group empowering womans rights?'

  body: Does the bottom one need the fist? I think the type is interesting on its
    own.

  body: The left seems more credible as a potential political logotype. The right
    isn&#39;t as powerful to me, and doesn&#39;t uplift my spirit as much as the left.
    The left shows direction. The fist seems to cliche. The lowercase e seems awkward
    and whimpy. Take a look at other Grotesque faces&#40;maybe Helvetica&#41; I like
    Scott&#39;s suggestion about the point of the star making the A, seems like a
    good idea.  <BR> <BR>A good political logo in my mind would be one that tries
    to appeal to the swing voters not the already established far left or far right.
    <BR> <BR>If the pink is a necessity, then you meed some strength to contrast the
    femininity.
