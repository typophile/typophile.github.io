    And nowadays the Turkish nation is not that terribly poor and desperate as you
    might want to suggest. As a matter of fact, Turkey is a rather successful nation
    with a growing population. So far so good.\r\n\r\nBut all this is rather not at
    stake here. The presented \u201Cdesign\u201D is based on a mental mistake (like
    it was with the official Euro sign) and therefore it will undergo substantial
    transformation or it will vanish.\r\nThe mistake is that the proposed glyph is
    meant \u201Cto look like a piece of design\u201D, rather than to look like a natural
    currency character.\r\n\r\nPride or prejustice, that is the question.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    you can always go and furnish 20A4 with any glyph you like. \r\nTo my knowlegde
    there are only two countries with Lira left today, Turkey and Syria. But for Syria
    as an Arabic writing country the slot 20A4 is of no interest. So in fact, the

    Istanbul seems to be pretty modest. But the timing\r\nstill has to click just
    right.\r\n\r\nAndreas, national pride can be quite important... but mostly\r\nfor
    endangered peoples. In the hands of dominant people it's\r\nsadly mostly used
    to get the populace to behave contrary to\r\nits own good, as happened during
    WWI.\r\n\r\n> therefore it will undergo substantial\r\n> transformation or it
    will vanish.\r\n\r\nWhat's \"substantial\"? That's not what I feel happened\r\nto
    the Euro. What we see in type is clearly a rendering\r\nof the original idea.
    It really doesn't matter that the\r\noriginal idea was intended* to be implemented
    strictly.\r\nAnd that actually has its place too, like as decoration\r\non buildings.
    In fact it's better to start with something\r\nformal and let people deviate;
    the other way is hopeless.\r\n\r\n* Which I'm not sure was the case. There's a\r\ndifference
    between what politicians say versus\r\nwhat they think should happen. And if they
    had\r\nsaid \"this is just a suggestion of how it should\r\nlook\" <em>then</em>
    we might have seen some substantial\r\nchanges (and you don't want too much deviation).\r\n\r\n>
    you can always go and furnish 20A4 with any glyph you like\r\n\r\nOverloading
    that slot would only confuse. That's almost\r\nas bad as re-using the sputnik
    (the generic currency slot).\r\n\r\n> Syria as an Arabic writing country the slot
    20A4 is of no interest\r\n\r\nThat's an over-simplification - you could be writing
    about\r\nthe Syrian currency in a Latinate language. And if I'm not\r\nmistaken
    the Syrian currency notes have an English side.\r\n\r\n> Is there any political
    message in this official announcement\r\n\r\nExplicitly: unlikely. Implicitly:
    definitely. :-)\r\nAlthough it's possible that the Armenian Dram's recent\r\nincorporation
    into Unicode was a trigger, something like\r\nthis would never get off the ground
    unless there was a\r\npolitical message. And the only message that seems to\r\nmake
    sense here is \"we don't really need Europe\"; and\r\nin that context the new
    mark pretty much <em>had</em> to have\r\na non-Latin skew.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    if John's concern about the <em>inclination of the bars</em> is valid (and I agree

    offensive (even though you didn't intend it as such). Nationalism permeates everything

    I have to take issue with the first half of Kent's post. Yes, formal harmony in
    a set of glyphs is important, but I personally always strive for a character to
    be itself and basing the TL too closely to existing structures risks shortchanging
    it (pardon the pun). Also, most currency marks are derived from alphabetic structures,
    but <em>all</em> currency marks end up abutted to numerals... So maybe we need
    to think in terms of [diverging from?] the numerals, which for example traditionally
    have thick horizontals.\r\n\r\nAlso, as much as I admire Craig's inventive -and

      (reasonably enough) said that it was too early to know how typographers would

      a harmonized glyph (like the one based on Craig's that I used in my proposal).

    to the Y.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I don\u2019t think the starting point for the lower
    curve should be so much a turned P. Since the official spec derives from the quarter
    circle, I think you need to look at the \u201Ccircular\u201D elements in a face,
    primarily the O \u2014 which naturally leads to the D, which is already a half
    rounded form with a straight left stem. So, I think the lower curve could probably
    derive from general pattern of the D</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI think a <em>turned</em>
    P -- sic, actually inverted -- would be very wrong. What I did for the Cambria
    signs was to take the lower right portion of the P bowl and modify it to flow
    into the serif construction of the bottom of the 'L' stem, i.e. actually making
    it <em>less</em> round. I think making it more of an arc of a circle is a mistake
    unless the design of the typeface already includes such forms in some way. Kent
    suggests referencing the D instead of the P, but in my types the D and the P usually
    reference each other, and the P is proportionally a better match for the Turkish
    lira sign.\r\n\r\nWhat I think is important is that the arrangement of stroke
    modulation in the sign should reflect that of the rest of the typeface, in order
    to maintain a sense of stability -- surely desirable for a currency --, and that
    it makes sense to make use of the same construction as used elsewhere in the design
    in similar situations of transition from horizontal to vertical bowl segments.
    Because of the bars extending to the right, I also think it is important to keep
    the terminal of the upturn quite simple and not too high, with a good amount of
    clearance between it and the bars without the latter being placed too high on
    the stem. What I did in Cambria is to optically centre the crossing of the two
    bars on the vertical stem, and to roughly align the top of the upturn with where
    the lower bar emerges on the left side of the stem. This seems to me to be the
    sort of handy rule that suggests a general model.\r\n\r\nThere will, of course,
    be plenty of room for more flamboyant designs, as there is for any glyph, especially
    in display types, but what is needed at this point is a kind of 'basic construction
    model' that can be applied to as wide a range of styles of type as possible and
    produce harmonious results that fit well with the other glyphs, especially the
    numerals. This is the approach that various people took to the euro symbol when
    it was instroduced:notably Linotype, who had the largest library of fonts in the
    target market that needed updating, and who produced a euro symbol design guide
    that we found produced suitable results for all but an idiosyncratic handful of
    the 500 fonts that we were hired to extend. Indeed, so good was Linotype's basic
    construction model for the euro symbol that Adam was able to semi-automate the
    production of new euro symbol glyphs from elements of existing glyphs, which I
    had only to fine tune. To me it simply makes sense that the best way to ensure
    that a new sign harmonises with an existing design is to reference the construction
    of like-elements in that design. It also accords with my belief that once one
    has established a core set of glyphs with characteristic shapes and constructions,
    the rest of a typeface should mostly design itself, and my job is careful refinement
    of proportions and spacing, not endlessly wondering what shape something should
    be."

    sake here's some dissent on that point:\r\n\r\n1) The glyph retains sufficient
    \"L-ness\" regardless of the serif treatment there. What that bilateral serif
    may do most is not lend \"L-ness\" but lend \"capital-ness\" to the glyph, but
    there is no pressing reason to associate the lira symbol with the majuscules,

    visual room for the rising crossbars, which the original proposal specifies as
    longer on the right and higher than many of the serif-topped proposals have them.\r\n\r\n3)
    Settling on the top first may be constraining options as we work out the problems
    of the other parts of the glyph. The truncated thick stroke at the end of the
    curve in the John Hudson design perhaps needs some terminal, such as you might
    find on a /G/, but the busyness of the glyph kept him from using serifs there.
    Could a different solution on top make serifs possible? If there's no serif on
    the right side of the stem at the top, the crossbars can be higher and a G-like
    serif can have more room. At the same time, a unilateral serif means just less
    ink overall, and less visual clutter with the crossbars right of the stem. And
    if it is an angled serif on the left, being closer to parallel with the crossbars
    should also make the glyph less busy. (Though I suppose that angle might vary
    with the angle [if any] of the ascender serifs in the typeface?)"

    introducing the symbol, it has all the marks of a post facto interpretation of
    a design that is clearly based around an uppercase L, a lowercase t -- more on
    that below --, and the conventions of other major currency symbols. And this is
    what it is important to remember: it is a currency symbol among currency symbols,
    not a pictogram of an anchor. The whole point of the exercise is for the Turks
    to have a symbol for their currency that takes its place among the other internationally
    recognised currency symbols, so we'd be doing them a disservice if we adopted
    an approach that makes the sign visually out of synch with other currency symbols
    and risks exoticisation. As far as I'm concerned, the anchor notion is something
    to be completely ignored, along with any other external shape correspondences;
    hence I am neither seeking to make the upturn look like a gondola prow nor fussed
    if it turns out to suggest that, any more than I care if my uppercase A reminds
    someone of a Swiss ski chalet. I'm designing a sign within a writing system according
    to the construction of the other signs in that system and the particular typeface
    design. As Gill might say at this juncture: a currency symbol is a thing, not
    a picture of a thing.\r\n\r\nHrant:\r\n<blockquote>I'm not opposed to a full double

    or busyness at the top of the symbol, but then I also didn't place the bars as
    high as in the official logo sign. Why not? Because that's not the convention
    of most currency symbols, and I didn't want to make the Turkish lira sign unnecessarily
    distinct in this regard (although I consider the higher bars a valid alternative
    that should be considered relative to the shape and size of the upturn terminal,
    as in Craig's lachrymal example).\r\n\r\nI favoured a double serif at the top
    because, with few exceptions, <a href=\"http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U20A0.pdf\">currency
    symbols</a> are based on uppercase letters, and the other Cambria currency symbols
    follow this pattern. Once again, I think it makes sense to follow what one has
    already done in the other currency symbols in a typeface, in e.g. the yen symbol.
    Now, that said, it should be obvious that if one has deliberately crafted currency
    symbols that utilise terminals referencing lowercase forms, maybe for use with
    oldstyle numerals, then it would make sense to apply the same approach to the
    Turkish lira sign. In other words, the shape of serifs to be used is not part
    of a basic construction model, but a design-specific determinant of the general
    approach to currency symbol design.\r\n_____\r\n\r\nMost of the discussion so
    far has focused on the relationship of this symbol to the uppercase L, with some
    reference to the anchor notion. It may be helpful to consider that the sign also
    resembles a lowercase t, and this is presumably intentional. This is why I think
    Craig's 'elephant in the room' is potentially a legitimate variant, although I
    think it would benefit from longer and slanted bars."

  body: "So I did some thinking, and some rough sketching, and came up with:\r\n-
    Three ways to do the top.\r\n- Four \"essential\" terminal styles.\r\n- Seven
    ways to handle the critical bottom-left.\r\n- Two ways to modulate the bottom.\r\n-
    And two ways to connect the bottom to the terminal.\r\n\r\nTo narrow down the
    permutations, here are ideas I'm getting comfortable with:\r\n- The glyph should
    be a cross between caps and numerals.\r\n- The best place to make it look like
    a capital is the top.\r\n- The best place to make it belong with the numerals
    is the terminal.\r\n- The bottom-left must have a singularity, probably a serif
    (but not a [closed] loop).\r\n- The bottom \"stroke\" should be thin (assuming
    contrast), not least because I'm a fan of \"rationalist\" stroke contrast in the
    numerals anyway.\r\n- Attaching an up-curving form immediately at the bottom of
    the stem is no good.\r\n- The structure should be able to accommodate narrowness.\r\n\r\nI'm
    starting to see two overall strategies to combine everything:\r\n- Very conservative,
    where I'm ending up with something like what John first showed, and Kent just
    showed. Although it's solid, it also feels like a lost opportunity.\r\n- Something
    akin to Craig's \"rocker bottom\" version, but less flamboyant (and with capital
    serifs up top). I think curving the bottom might be the key ingredient to making
    this click.\r\n\r\nIf this all sounds too detached from the making of glyphs,
    sorry, this is how I roll. But now I <em>am</em> ready to make glyphs.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    For one thing I don't know how half an anchor is less \"decadent\" than one-third
