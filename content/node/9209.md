body: Hey folks.  Ive gathered some images of fonts i&#39;d like to id.  Ive searched
  the archives for the first one but couldn&#39;t find it. Im aware the first two
  are probably modifications of exhisting fonts, can anyone tell me of which ones?
  &#40;Im looking for the script font in the second image&#41; The third looks like
  custom, but is there something similar available? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/65161.gif"

    target="_blank">PL Davison Americana</a> <BR> <BR>I can identify the location
    of the bottom photo as Monument Valley <BR>from the southern part of my home state
    of Utah. But you didn&#39;t ask. <BR>I don&#39;t think that spaceship observatory
    is there. That&#39;s fake.

  body: Purpose is a great script. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it was from  <BR>Letterhead
    Fonts. They have impressed me more than once <BR>with their ornate fonts of americana.

  body: 10000 Hz Legend seems really simple to draw &#40;even for some <BR>talented
    hack like me&#41;, so if you&#39;re not setting too much text  <BR>you&#39;ll
    probably be more satisfied with your own rendition of the  <BR>script using Illie&#39;s
    straight pen tool.

    for &#34;SEARCH&#34; in the second image?  I like that font a lot.  Thanks!

    target="_blank">Cachet Bold</a> is rather close. &#40;MyFonts shows it, but you
    would have to get it from Fonts.com or FontHaus&#41;
