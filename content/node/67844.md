  find any fitting version of it, am blind/stupid or it really doesn't exist?\r\n\r\nI
  guess the python 2.3 version for v10.3 isn't the right one for me, right? \r\nAnd
  only the MacPython 2.3 works with FontLab, right?\r\n\r\nCould anybody help me,
  please!?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n;>"

    I recommend installing the xcode suite ( http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode/
    ) for your os version. It seemed to iron out a lot of kinks on my 10.6 machine
    to do with font development. Good luck!"

    get a bit freaky with command line (terminal) stuff, but I'm fairly sure xcode
    is what makes all the lights and bells switch on.\r\n\r\nPython should already
    be running as standard however (just in case you've been looking in vain for a
    button...like i did), xcode will just let you tweak and compile things if you
    need to."
