body: "I found this font Polygraph (http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/pintassilgo/polygraph/)
  at Myfonts which I really liked, only thing is I would love having a similarly styled
  font without the extra lines and twists, and more straight forward tall condensed
  sans serif with a hand drawn feel to it. It ain't that hard to do it myself, but....\r\nHope
  anyone can help:)"
