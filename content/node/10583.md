body: i posted a thrad yesterday, but i don&#39;t think i was very clear in what i
  set out to do. <BR> <BR>i want to design a typeface for people who suffer from dyslexia.
  i have been researching dyslexia and the problems dyslexic&#39;s face when reading.
  <BR> <BR>here is where you guys come in. i was wondering if anyone could help me
  in my research and contribute in terms of what makes a typeface legible for for
  dyslexic&#39;s. i have visited read regular&#39;s web pae but i think i need more
  standard info on type design itself. <BR> <BR>please help... thanks.

  body: I am no expert on these matters, but I suffer from a very mild form of dyslexia
    myself, and can tell you that lowercase b and p are my biggest problem &#40;not
    so with uppercase B and P&#41;...for what that&#39;s worth.

  body: '&#62; hi nick, <BR> <BR>That&#39;s because most typefaces use symetry in
    the characters. I know that this is one of the main reasons that dyslexic&#39;s
    have trouble with modern typefaces.'

    <BR> <BR>... is another possibility. I&#39;m having trouble navigating on their
    site right now, but they designed a family of typefaces for the visually impaired.
    Not the same as Dyslexia, I know, but a similar problem. <BR> <BR>There might
    have been a thread here on typophile about dyslexia; I seem to remember reading
    something about it. The key issue was creating dis-uniformity &#40;ie, changing
    d,b,q,p so they weren&#39;t reflections of each other&#41; without ruining the
    &#34;color&#34; of the face. <BR> <BR>try a search on typophile. I&#39;ve never
    been able to get the regular search to work; click on the &#34;advanced search&#34;
    link. <BR> <BR>Jay

  body: '&#62; Hi sally, thanks very much for the pdf-it&#39;s going to be of great
    use to my research. Maybe we can exchange typefaces when I complete my project.
    Also I was wondering if you might be able to give me some advice about Reading?
    I&#39;m very interested in the course and am seriously considering applying there-if
    there&#39;s anything regarding grade requirements and preferred design background
    you can let me know, I&#39;d be even more grateful! Cheers. <BR> <BR>Leigh'

  body: 'Hello Leigh,  <BR> <BR>I applaud your impulse to assist the dyslexic. Reading&#39;s
    typography program is an excellent place to further your typographic studies.  <BR>
    <BR>My general feeling, after viewing the samples from the Read Regular campaign,
    is that the field of dyslexia is not lacking in caring, observant people who wish
    to improve the environment of dyslexics. What is in short supply is deep typographic
    expertise, the sort which is accompanied by an ability to understand and refine
    shapes, proportions, details, and spacing of a typeface to have real impact on
    the ambiguity issues dyslexics face. Please do avail yourself of any and all typographic
    resources you can find. But I strongly urge you to advance your typographic awareness
    before attempting to solve this highly specialized and typographically demanding
    problem.  <BR> <BR>Specifically, I suggest you make it a challenge to yourself
    to investigate the unfortunate misconception that different letters in a typeface
    are exactly symmetrical. To determine this, you might start with those typefaces
    which have already proven to foster comfortable, extended reading: Caslon, Garamond,
    Dante, Bembo, Hoefler Text, etc. Why not begin with typefaces that ordinary readers
    already prefer? Surely there is something in general reading comprehension that
    favors differentiation of letter shapes.... Note that the symmetry attributed
    is simply not present. In these typefaces, it&#39;s only the most basic skeleton
    of the letters b and d that are ambiguous. Will reducing them to those skeletons
    somehow reduce ambiguity?... <BR> <BR>What about Sans Serif faces? Why have they
    been seen as less suitable for extended reading &#40;they have&#41;? Are there
    more and less ambiguous Sans Serif typefaces &#40;compare Helvetica and Legacy
    Sans, for example&#41;? Are the least ambiguous Sans faces more or less ambiguous
    than the least ambiguous serif faces?... How about for extended reading?  <BR>
    <BR>Can you assess the ambiguity of various existing typefaces to find the essential
    features of letterforms that ensure differentiation? Would maximizing those features
    &#40;tails, counter shapes, serifs, ascenders, etc.&#41; result in leaps in the
    reading comfort and comprehension of dyselxics? It requires testing, refining
    and testing again, with dyslexics, to determine which features are truly helpful
    and which are simply assumed by designers or by academics to be necessary. Throw
    out established assumptions! <BR> <BR>Are specialists in comprehension, dyslexia
    and learning able to grasp these concepts? Sally Castle&#39;s excellent report
    suggests not! Perhaps this area demands more attention.... <BR> <BR>Sally&#39;s
    test results are inconclusive. There should be more complete, thorough, and typographically
    sophisticated testing between various typefaces before issues like this can be
    resolved, and this may require resources. Can you devote several years to collecting
    data on reading preferences, either in control groups or among the dyslexic?  <BR>
    <BR>Which are useful, meaningful typefaces to compare? Clue: Helvetica and Comic
    Sans are not on the short list.... <BR> <BR>Perhaps the ideal typeface for dyslexics
    is under your nose. Do not discount this possibility. Conversely, the ideal typeface
    for dyslexics might actually be much less conservative, less simplified, and more
    fluid and expressive than anyone has yet attempted in a text typeface &#40;that&#39;s
    TEXT typeface&#41;. The Greek lowercase is highly differentiated and each letterform
    is distinct. Can this quality be borrowed from Greek to help reduce ambiguity?  <BR>
    <BR>I propose that it is typographers and typeface designers whose input is needed
    at this point to discover the most benefit for dyslexic readers. Apply your attention
    to this area, and no doubt you will find unexpected insight, while advancing typographic
    research. In the best of worlds, you may discover typefaces that not only foster
    reading among dyslexics, but improve the reading environment for all.  <BR> <BR>Best
    of luck, <BR> <BR>Carl Crossgrove'
