  body: Depending on length of text and subject matter, maybe something like Pill
    Gothic (http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/betatype/pill-gothic/) could work. Or, in
    any case, something monolinear, geometric, with strong diagonals in the joints
    of |b|, |d|, |h|, |n|, etc.

  body: "Thank you for replying riccard0\r\n\r\nThe Minimum typeface was used for
    the logo, the sans serif typeface i'm looking to buy is just going to be used
    for the address of the company and to spell out the name of the company next to
    the actual logo. \r\n\r\nsome other suggestions than Pill Gothic anyone (don't
    quite like it to be honest) :-D\r\n"

  body: Then maybe a geometric sans with circle-like |O|, set in all caps, could work.
