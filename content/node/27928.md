  body: "The lettering of tough to identify newspaper namplates is almost all custom
    drawn, especially the blacklettered examples.\r\n\r\nWhat about <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/11625/agincourtplain-font.html\">Agincourt</a>,
    or <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/89949/mariageregular-font.html\">Mariage</a>?
    Neither are exact matches, but I doubt that there is an exact match."

  body: "It's funny that Linotype changed the name of 'Linotext' to 'Mariage'. I wonder
    when that name change was done. Any idea Dan?\r\n\r\nAs their writep mentions,
    it has been known by a 'plethora of names', but <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/wedding-text/\">'Wedding
    Text'</a> is probably the best known, and is the original name of the Morris Fuller
    Benton typeface from 1901.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Linotext's name has NOT been changed. We have two typefaces based off of
    Wedding Text, Mariage and Linotext.\r\n\r\nHere is the link to Linotext:\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/948/linotext-family.html\r\n\r\nLinotext
    is a slightly lighter font than Mariage, which feels like a slightly darker digitization
    to me. I recommeded Mariage in this case only because its slightly greater dense-ness
    seems closer to the Syndey Morning Herald's nameplate than Linotext does."

  body: As a side note, Linotype has been distributing "Linotext" since about 1926.
    I don't know where Mariage came from, or in what year or format it first entered
    the Linotype Library.

    condensed, but I jumped to the wrong conclusion that it was the same font with
    a new name.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    digitizer uses different masters for their designs\u2026 Wedding Text may have
    had differences depending on its various point sizes."
