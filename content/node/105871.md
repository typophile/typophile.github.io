  is an image of the Diablo 3 World Map \"Sanctuary\" I've had a hard time trying
  to identify it. I've used many online tools to try and identify it and no luck.
  Letters that stand out to me are the W,V,T, and U. I wasn't sure how to classify
  it. It looks part script part serif. Please help me identify what font it is."
