    DIN</a>. They forgot to kern the tabluar numerals. From what I read, it sounds

    anything distinctive about the other letters. I guess I'm saying who could tell
    the difference if you used DIN? (The numerals are also consistent with DIN.) It's
    as good a guess as any, I'd say.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
