  body: "<cite>Q4: Did the profession, compared to former days, change? If yes, how
    and what makes you see that in practice?</cite>\r\n\r\nYes, we got computers,
    which meant that the subspecialties of graphic design such as typesetting and
    mechanical production got absorbed into the job of \"graphic designer\". The old
    ways required you to sketch and conceive of your design in advance of committing
    to it. The computer is more intuitive and process-oriented; you can tweak and
    massage a design until it feels right and fits your parameters. I wouldn't go
    back, but I'm glad I learned the old methods.\r\n\r\n<cite>Q5: Nowadays everyone\u2019s
    in the possession of photo editing software, word-art, dtp-software. Users think
    they are designers fast, although they have no or little knowledge of the design
    process. Do you see something of that \u2018anyone is a designer principle\u2019
    in, for example the way your clients brief you or give you freedom?</cite>\r\n\r\nEveryone
    thought they were designers before the computer too. The biggest difference I
    find is that now they think you can work much faster, and expect things to happen
    in the blink of an eye.\r\n\r\n<cite>Q8: Can anyone (in the possession of a computer)
    become a graphic designer / call himself a (graphic) designer?</cite>\r\n\r\nAnyone
    can become a graphic designer and call him/herself that. Not everyone can become
    a good graphic designer.\r\n\r\n<cite>Q9: Do you call yourself graphic designer?
    If no, what do you call yourself / what term do you use?</cite>\r\n\r\nYup."

    most (if not all) countries require brain surgeons to get licensed, so no, they
    can't. \r\n\r\nNot so with graphic designers."

    interior design and architecture, graphic design is not a regulated profession."
