body: "<dl>\r\n<dt>1. I'm a typography noob\r\n \r\n<dd>This is pretty much a hobby
  for me, although I'd like to incorporate it into what I do for a living. As I'm
  planning on going into technical writing, it's inevitable that I'll have to have
  typographic skills at some point. Perhaps the provided style guides will be out
  of date. Perhaps there will be no style guides.\r\n\r\n<dt>2. I'm overwhelmed at
  all there is to learn about this\r\n\r\n<dd>I understand the basics of font selection,
  but if you then gave me 100 fonts to pick from, I could probably pick a broad category
  of fonts.  After that I'd be a little lost. What really makes one geometric sanserif
  'better' or 'more suitable' than another?  Should I use Avenir, Colbet, Century
  Gothic, Futura? Why, and when? I get brief inspirations for projects and ideas when
  I see a new font, but my overall lack of experience pretty quickly derails anything
  I try.\r\n\r\n<dt>3. I don't have a third item.\r\n<dd> This info is just here to
  give a quick overview about me. I'm here to learn and any help or instruction I
  can get would be great. I also already have the generic reccomended typography books,
  'thinking with type' and 'elements of typographic style' which I'm working through.
  The latter, while full of info, tends to assume a bit of prior knowledge.\r\n</dl>"

  body: 'Re: 2, if advice is warranted. Having come from a similar position about
    a year ago, I can tell you that if you keep looking at type, you will start to
    get better at distinguishing the peculiar feel of each typeface. I remember that
    I once couldn''t see the differences between Helvetica and Arial or Galliard and
    Adobe Garamond (not to imply that the relationship between them is equivalent),
    but now it''s clear as day. I''d recommend looking through a particular designer''s
    oeuvre (such as Christian Schwartz, Jeremy Tankard, or Xavier Dupre) as a way
    to improve your ability to pick up on how good type communicates.'

    from Bliss. Now I can. \r\n\r\nEducation is always available. But learning takes
    time. Keep Posting on Typophile and you'll glean so much valuable information.
    If you have a doubt about a choice, post here and see what others have to say.
    You'll find that many other people have been or are in the boat as you.\r\n\r\nWelcome

  body: "Thanks!\r\n\r\nTaking hints from posts here and from other forums, I went
    and deleted most of the fonts I'd installed. I came across a coreldraw 5 cd, and
    a thousand or so quaintly named look-a like fonts sounded like a good idea at
    the time... \r\nThen I went back and only added ones I really wanted, where I
    was already aware of the original source.  They don't quite match up with their
    \"inspirations\", but it's better than too many or no interesting fonts. \r\nOr
    maybe that's a bad idea, getting used to versions with different overall sizes
    and perhaps inferior kerning?"

  body: "Hi there:\r\n\r\nI think Bitstream fonts came with Corel. These are supposed
    to be very good. Metrics (kernings etc) should be evaluated on a case by case
    basis.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/browse/foundry/bitstream/?sort=name\r\n\r\nBrowse
    this list on Myfonts and if you recognize any of them its time to undelete or
    reinstall those fonts.\r\n\r\nMikey :-)"
