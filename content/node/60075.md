  The website is pixelsift.com. There isn't anything there right now (I'm looking
  to settle on a logo to move forward with the site design) but I would like to put
  my portfolio together. The website is meant to promote my work as a freelance web
  developer/designer and I prefer a clean, professional look.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logos_4865.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nAny
  comments or criticisms would be appreciated. The logos in the right column differ
  subtly from those in the left in that the pixels have slightly rounded corners.
  What do you think?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDavid"

  body: I like the overall look that you have going, nice job. One thing I might try
    would be to close up the spacing between the two words. As it is now, part of
    me wants to read it as two separate words rather than a single name if that makes
    sense.

  body: "Thanks for the input. I didn't notice it before but I agree. I tightened
    up the spacing and now it's more of a logotype identifying my company as an entity
    rather than being \"read\" as *noun* *verb*\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture3_5927.png]"

  body: Agree with Bert on that.  Not sure what the box/colors add to your concept,
    except make this look like FontShop. Consider a version that becomes more pixelated,
    perhaps it becomes more pixelated top to bottom? Also, the pixel grid is not really
    a grid, which is making the curves look strange. On one hand smoother, but at
    small size/ low resolution, it looks odd to me. Maybe if they were dots it would
    be less noticeable?
