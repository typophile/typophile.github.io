body: "Since I got such excellent advices last time with my O \u2013 I feel I must
  ask this aswell. This is also some kind of optical trick to pull I believe, and
  maybe related (?). Is this also some variant of the \"bone effect\"?\r\n\r\nPlease,
  look where the arrow is in this picture. It seems that the stroke is not straight
  where the arrow is, there is a little irritating circular (I wish my english was
  more technical) inside-moving \"thing\" that almost makes it look like I have put
  a point there, and moved it inside towards left.\r\n\r\nSee it?\r\n\r\nThe points
  are placed as you can see, is there a better way of placing the points for a more
  straight \"ending\" that later on transforms into the little serif. I want the stroke
  to look 100% straight and end with this little serif at the bottom.\r\n\r\nWhat
  would you do to make this perfect?\r\n\r\nI thought that these triangular points
  would be best suited since it puts the handle in the exact angle based on the other
  point above, but this doesnt look good!\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/anothertrickyone_6139.png]"

    almost like there is an inward dip in the curve as things are now. Maybe you should
    show the whole glyph though.

  body: "You might also move the lower left point on the base line slightly to the
    right because it affects the illusion on the other side of the stroke.  Correcting
    for illusions seen at small sizes while looking at large sizes can be tricky.
    Hang in there! Fighting frustration is all part of the learning process--but a
    tall cool beer helps sometimes :-)\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Goran,\r\n\r\nType design consists of repeated changes, fixes, refinements.
    If you have a clear idea in your head of the shapes you want, then I suggest you
    experiment. If something doesn't look right, slide the points around. Add points.
    Subtract points. Change the relationship of the control points. Eventually you
    will discover what bezier outlines can do, and you will also discover how to control
    them to get the effects you want. Do not cling to a previous outline; there's
    no savings, economy or thrift in that. Put old outlines in the background and
    try again. In FontLab Studio 5 you can even leave points selected in the background
    so you can see what you did before. "

    I do is an experiment. But sometimes, I want to take the fastlane into learning,
    then all these useful tips here on Typophile are perfect.\r\n\r\n;-)"
