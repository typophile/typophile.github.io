  this font I saw in a presentation Stefan Sagmeister gave. These are just screen
  captures \u2013 the bottom two are definitely distorted (perspective) and the top
  one looks like it may be as well (slightly squished vertically). Did a little searching
  online for anyone talking about this font, but didn't see anything."
