    after all, and no longer the campaign. \r\n\r\nIf I'm not mistaken, they would
    have needed a special license for embedding Gotham in a publicly published PDF.
    Kinda doubt the government (or this particular designer) ponied up for such a
    license."

    would have castrated me.

    most cases, yes.\r\n\r\nbut it does eliminate the ambiguity which arises\r\nwhen
