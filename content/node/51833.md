    useful as graphic tools. They manage to produce text in a very complex visual
    styles. But the text produced by these tools have no portability. The fonts are
    encoded for the application functionality and are not at all Unicode compliant.\r\nI
    have not tried these because they don't work on my Mac. But I viewed some of their
    work and they are quite impressive.\r\nBut I personally wait for Tom Milo to popularize
    his engine so that we could produce Arabic text as pleasant but Unicode compliant.\r\nThe
    Persian page essentially has the same approach as the English page. They have
    a variety of tools and variety of fonts, including fonts that are encoded in a
    way to be used with Applications that don't support rtl.\r\nI am a very Unicode
    guy and very much against these kind of workaround.\r\nHowever, until Tom makes
    the move, there is an OpenType Unicode Persian Nasta'liq font in beta version
    -very buggy- which worth to look at because as far as the character design goes,
    it is wonderful. Before you encounter a bug, you can see how beautiful this font
    can be.\r\nhttp://www.scict.ir/Portal/File/ShowFile.aspx?ID=bea5ca36-1fdf-41d4-8818-c1a4f9c71081\r\n"

  body: "This font face has a very complex and - so far - sad story.\r\nIt was originated
    in one of those special 'graphic' tools that Aziz mentioned. The character design
    is by one of the masters of the field, although I saw his name somewhere a while
    back, but now I can't find a trace of it anywhere. This may be a part of the story
    of the conflict that has been aparently developped around the development of the
    Unicode version of this font face.\r\nIt was commissioned by the Islamic regim
    of Iran. The government English site has no information about this project.\r\nhttp://www.scict.ir/Portal/Home/Default.aspx?CategoryID=3245b8ee-53dd-44ec-a3bb-1a264fea36a2\r\nThe
    Persian site has a little. It was first budgeted for 190 M Rls and what you see
    is the result of that commission! Now the developper is asking for more to fix
    the bugs and apparently 70 M Rls is approved or in the process of approval. This
    is mainly a technical side conflict. The original designer is faded in the turmoil,
    as it always happens with Arabic fonts. I am told the bug free version was already
    prepared when the developper delivered this to the government!\r\nThis is the
    government Persian page, announcing this font:\r\nhttp://www.scict.ir/Portal/Home/ShowPage.aspx?Object=News&CategoryID=72ec3b79-8eb2-40bf-8308-4888712e594a&LayoutID=44f4f30f-84f9-48ff-a3a6-7c5be4da31c4&ID=f2bccb28-f5ec-4457-a2eb-f5346f016c07\r\nAnd
    it is all written with Tahoma!\r\n\r\n"

    will silence All\r\n\r\nWell, I hope not the Iranian taxpayers! But you most probably
    are right!\r\n\r\nBut my main concern about this complex fonts is somewhere else.
    They are just too complex to be made.\r\nAs a user, if I don't like the shape
    of A in Times, I choose Arial, Helvetica something else and if none of them is
    satisfactory, somewhere someone will be able to produce a font with an A shaped
    to my satisfaction. The effort involved is comparatively minimal.\r\nAs a user,
    I will have exactly the same approach to a Nasta'liq font or a complex Naskh font.
    If I see a dot not positioned to my liking, I simply won't use the font, oblivious
    to the fact that how much effort was involved in producing such font.\r\n\r\nSo
    to me, the issue is not simply the fisabilty. It can be done with GPOS. It is
    whether the effort involved is reasonalbe or not. This is the issue that I'm hoping
    Tom Milo's engine answer. Arabic font making should be technically reasonabley
    easy, so that the real designers don't sink in the complexity of the task. Otherwise,
    why not sticking with GPOS of OpenType and screw the designers as usual?!"
