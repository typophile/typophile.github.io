    week and isolated the type to the words I was looking for during the search last
    week, but to no avail. Your leads to Diamante are wonderful. \r\n\r\nAny thoughts
    on the second image showing \"Kues\"? \r\n\r\nThank you!"

    one of the designers in charge of this identity at [[http://www.theinfantree.com/work/hunger-n-thirst|The
    Infantree]] has a type work on his dribbble called '[[http://dribbble.com/shots/986127-Absolute-Finest-Type|Absolute
    Finest Type]] which looks pretty close to the one for 'HUNGER N THIRST'. For what
    it's worth, if I have to recreate it, I'd probably start with some font like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/diamante|Diamante
    EF]] adding those latin (triangle) serifs.\r\nMore 'Diamante': [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/solotype/five-star-final|Five

  body: Not sure if this is the one, but [[http://www.parachute.gr/typefaces/allfonts/regal-swash-pro|Regal
    Swash Pro]] from Parachute is very close to your Kues sample. While I don't see
    the exact matching alternates in the glyph set (I didn't examine it too closely)
    the general style including some specific points do match. It may be the one,
    with some additional customisation for the logo.

    to directly ask [[https://www.behance.net/gallery/The-Logo-Volume-II/13601081|Yossi
    Belkin]] (and if he answer, drop the answer here :). To me, it feels "custom from
    a commercial typeface" (meaning "not drawn from scratch"). Reminds me of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/caslon/semibold-italic/glyphs.html#glyphs/511579/346|Caslon
