  body: "When I see letters that look like nothing I've ever seen -- and maybe should
    never have existed -- like the 'C' in CLOVER, I can't help thinking that some
    font editing has been done. My next thought is 'if I had to duplicate this without
    tracing, how would I do it?'\r\n\r\nIn this case, I think I'd start with a Century
    or a Caslon, then 'squoosh' it and then replace, or re-work, the serifs. \r\n\r\nIn
    other words, I think it's custom(ized).\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: I agree. The C looks bizzarely contorted. I doubt that there is a font that
    came that way.
