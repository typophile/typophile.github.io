body: "Hello typophiles,\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a sans font that would look between
  a humanist font and a gothic/grotesk font. Serious and elegant.\r\n\r\nFor example,
  FF Meta is too humanist for my purpose and Helvetica Neue is too cold.\r\n\r\nIt's
  for a stationary so it should be legible in small sizes, but it should also work
  for body text. In addition, this font should be *slightly* condensed in its regular
  shape (like Meta or Frutiger).\r\n\r\nFrutiger seems like the right choice right
  now, but I'd like to test with a font a tad less humanist.\r\n\r\nBy the way, please
  do not suggest any fonts that only come in 200 euros + bundles (DTL, I'm thinking
  about you). As beautiful as they may be, we're a small design studio and we can't
  afford them !\r\n\r\nThank you for your help !"

    could be described as a grotesqued Meta. It sets beautifully in small and body
    text sizes.

      Stephen, do you think FF Milo Regular, all caps, in 7pt would be legible on

  body: Regular is the weight I'd choose, and -- lucky you -- you can <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/freefonts">try
    it for free</a>. The thing was built to go that small, so you'd do fine with any
    of the weights. By the way, if you can afford the extra dough, get the OT version.
    Will save you a ton of small caps, figures and glyph changing time in Adobe CS.
