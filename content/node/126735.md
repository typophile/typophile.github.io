  hope you guys can help identify this typeface: \r\nPretty sure it's a calligraphic
  one but I can't seem to pinpoint exactly.\r\n\r\nNeed to know the typeface used
  for \"1898\" the \"1\" seems to be unique to this.. IT's not palatino nor garamond.
  I figured movies usually use default / standard typefaces \r\nHope you can help!\r\nThanks
  in advance!"
