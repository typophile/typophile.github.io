  an old raster. It has come down to either finding the font or hand-retracing the
  text, which I have little desire to do.\r\n\r\nPerhaps someone out there knows what
  this is, or at least something close enough.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_raster_pmo_4066.jpg]"

    I can't find anything with its same features in one font. Font Mesa has the best
    collection of these Western styles, and I would suggest a blend of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/miss-scarlett/|Miss
    Scarlett Plain]] and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/cowboy-western/|Cowboy
    Western]] would give you a more professional looking Western font with most of
    these features.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
