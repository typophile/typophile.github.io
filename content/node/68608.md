  body: "It seems that the letterforms in [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/garagefonts/district_family_ot/?&sample_text=GROUND%20MAPLES&update=0|District
    Thin]] are pretty similar. I guess it could be further thinned by adding negative
    (white) stroke. The shapes also are close to [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/font_bureau/interstate_thin_ot/?&sample_text=GROUND%20MAPLES&update=0|Interstate
    Thin]], which is closer to the weight here. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
