  D\xFCrer)</em>\r\n\r\nGermany's most famous painter of the Renaissance era. Lived
  in Nuremberg, but traveled at least once to Venice.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his painting,
  D\xFCrer was very interested in the proportions of the human body, perspective,
  and letterforms. He tried to develop a system to discover the geometric building
  blocks of the Roman alphabet (both the classical Roman uppercase letters, and the
  lowercase [[Textura]] letters (a variety of [[Blackletter]]).\r\n\r\nWhile his books
  on letterforms are beautiful, they were not influential in the course of typographic
  development. D\xFCrer, however, did play an enormous role in the development of
  European typography: together with [[Johann Neudoerffer the Elder]], he worked at
  the court of Holy Roman Emperor [[Maximilian I]] to create the [[Fraktur]] style
  of type (another [[Blackletter]] variety), in 1517."
