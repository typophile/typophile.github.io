  designed on here so you you might be able to help.  I need to create a texture similar
  to what's show in the background on this image: \r\n\r\nhttp://ollymoss.com/art/panic.gif\r\n\r\nSo
  the question: Do you have any good idea to make the texture or do you know any good
  keywords to use when searchign for it?"

    can make it in photoshop but it is much easier to buy. \r\nIf your going the creation
    route look at getting a leather texture, then using  a variety of different filter
    in PS, maybe the  mosaic filter for starters with a few different  adjustment
    layers.\r\nMartin"
