  body: This is likely customed designed, like the logos for most major corporations.
    As for a close alternative, I&#39;m not sure. Perhaps another typophile can suggest
    something based on the logo that&#39;s been unobliqued and recompressed. That
    may be a good starting point. I hope this help somwhat. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/48652.gif"

    target="_blank">Rockwell Extra Bold</a> would be the sort of starting point James
    suggested. The letterforms are fairly close, and a little outline editing of serif
    shapes and stroke intersections on the R could finish the job.
