  body: "first of all, Blaktur is not a [[faq free|free font]], and cannont just be
    passed around from user to user.\r\n\r\nsecondly, flash embedding may not be allowed
    by House's [[EULA]].\r\n\r\ndoing anything might mean one of 2 things: licensing
    the font yourself or choosing a new typeface."
