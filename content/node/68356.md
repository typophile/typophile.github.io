  body: "I think that it is Futura but that those title cards are not from 1924. According
    to Christopher Burke\u2019s biography of Renner production of trial cuts began
    in the winter of 1924/25, but the trial was of the regular weight. The proofs
    Burke shows for the bold are dated 1927. One of the following is probably likely:
    film historians have dated the film based on the title card, which is not actually
    the date of the film, or it was filmed in 1924 but the title cards were added
    later."
