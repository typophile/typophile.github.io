  I partly post this to see if anybody can take a crack at what typeface this is based
  on, most likely hand done. But I was wondering if anyone can give me some insight
  about these screens. I bought them in a junk shop, apparently they had been there
  a long time. The ink is still on them. At first I had guessed it was used by sign
  painters, but it seems impractical for individual letters to have a screen that
  big. Why would someone need a complete alphabet like this?\r\n\r\n*Note the % and
  ! as well as the extra s,t,e. They are about 4.5 feet wide and 2 feet tall. The
  letters are approximately 10 inches high. Thanks"

  body: Good question. I bet you a pound to a bucket that this is a hand lettered
    set. Also there is no room to swing a squegee on these frames - barely room for
    a clean pull, if you know what I mean. Nice Q. Can't think of a practical application
    - I expect something will turn up.

  body: "One possibility, suggested by the extra S, T and E: someone was making movable
    letters for a sign board. I have a few sets of these, along with a nifty backlit
    sign. The letters are a gothic style (something like yours), and they're printed
    on heavy, white plastic cards. You make up the words letter by letter, sliding
    the cards into a slot on the front of the sign. I got the whole deal for a few
    bucks at a yard sale. It even included a box of dingbats, arrows and punctuation.
    Couldn't afford NOT to get it! (Now guests in my living room amuse themselves
    by making absurd messages.) Just one possibility.\r\n\r\nSkylar"

  body: Thanks for the feedback. Skyfein, I thought about the moveable letters before
    also, and that makes the most sense to me. Now that I think about it more, the
    inclusion of the ! and the % but not any other glyphs seems important. Stores
    advertising sales and other events would definitely use 50% off, and SALE! Although
    there aren't any numbers. Makes the most sense though. Thanks.
