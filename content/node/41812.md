  most identify with the parks and river in the area so I tried using a leaf to represent
  the nature. It's a mixed residential type ares, with quite a bit of over development
  in high rise apartments in the 80's. \r\n\r\nThis is a quick sketch of the idea
  I was going for. \r\n\r\nComments appreciated.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/new-1_4420.jpg]"

  body: Even with two elements your designs tend to feel busy. Top right and middle
    are the only ones I could see working as a general-purpose mark, but neither one
    really gets the point of water across, right now they seem more like radio waves.

  body: "The first issue is definitely complication.  There's no real center or focus
    to the logo with the buildings, leaf and water.  That doesn't mean there can't
    be a focus, but right now they are three separate elements that aren't working
    together.\r\n\r\nThe second issue, and more important to me, is that none of the
    sketches are unique enough to serve as an identifier for your community.  Any
    leafy suburb with a creek could use those logos.  Maybe you should try combining
    those pieces with something typographic, like the K or a KL monogram that would
    be more unique to your town."

  body: 'I agree with many of the other postings. It''s too complicated looking. It
    is also too generic looking. Where are you? What is unique to your community?
    Perhaps use a leaf that comes from a native tree, or an architectural element
    from your town. I would also recommend that you start working with your type element
    at this early design stage. Try to get the type and image to work together. '

    like some sort of river delta, and consolidate the buildings into a Frasier-style
    skyline.

  body: I just meant to give your drawing more character by using an oak, maple, sycamore
    or whatever leaf instead of something that looks like generic clip art. If the
    residents most closely identify with the park and river focus on those elements
    and forgo the buildings. Draw on the community's strengths not it's weakness.

  body: "If there no trees to speak of in this area...  By all means don't put one
    in the logo.  It will ring as a falsehood, and compromise the brand.  But since
    you say that \"the residents most identify with the parks and river in the area
    so I tried using a leaf to represent the nature\", then leave the computer and
    go take a walk.  Collect leaves.  Post pencil/pen/watercolor sketches, and then
    return to the computer when you've refined your idea.   If the logo is inspired
    by the community, then it will ring far truer.\r\n\r\nGood luck!"

    uses the maple leaf. Personally I think that's as generic as what I have going
    here.\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't think I ever said there were no trees, just not one specific
    kind that can be pinned down as this suburbs tree.\r\nI've been to the parks in
    question, I live next door, and have done sketches in the park of different things,
    this is one of the sketches. Based on White Elm, Hackberry, Manitoba Maple and
    Linden in the area. Thanks for the suggestion though. \r\n"

    half of 8.\r\n\r\nIn general, the elements are working against each other, as
    if they were rigid and could only be superimposed over each other at different
    scales. Use your drawing skills to combine the leaf with the water in a unified
    shape. Consider that in a way the buildings are repeating the land/earth part
    of the equation already represented by the leaf. Simplify."

    along the more i feel like the leaf is inhibiting the idea. although in the lower

    cutting it off at the lower right edge seems weird. there's a nice sense of containment
