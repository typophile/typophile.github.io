  awesome sign shop marketeer.\r\n\r\nBy-the-way, are those quotation marks? And if
  so, is that they're correct usage? I noticed that the ones used on the building
  are not in the same location (at the top of the word(s)), as on the front wheel
  cover.\r\n\r\nAnd perhaps some entrepreneur somewhere might just seize the initiative
  and produce a modern version of those wheel covers. I imagine at the very least
  there might be a nice niche market for cyclist delivery services... \r\n\r\n"

  body: "<cite>are those quotation marks? And if so, is that [their] correct usage?</cite>\r\n\r\nThey
    are quotation marks. Their usage is a bit, we could say, \u201Ccreative\u201D,
    especially on the wheel. In this case, at that time quotation marks were used
    to shown the wordmark/shop name (Alla Lettera), as opposed to the name of the
    owner (Antonino) and the type of shop/goods (insegne).\r\nSpeaking of creative
    typography on the wheels, the address, which reads \u201CCorso Reg. Margh.\u201D,
    stands for \u201CCorso Regina Margherita\u201D (which one could roughly translate
    as \u201CQueen Margaret Avenue\u201D.\r\n\r\nOne last bit of trivia: \u201Calla
    lettera\u201D could be translated both as \u201Cat the letter\u201D (as in French,
    \u201Cchez\u201D), and as \u201Cto the letter\u201D (as in \u201Cliterally\u201D,
    \u201Cverbatim\u201D)."
