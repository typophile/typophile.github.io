  body: Do you really mean &#34;daily&#34;? Or is it &#34;monthly&#34;. What is the
    subject matter? Science? health? <BR> <BR>Auto is a fun typeface, but Underware&#39;s
    Dolly &#40;for text&#41; and Sauna &#40;for heads&#41; with Bello thrown in for
    good measure.

  body: Every day except weekends. General information oriented to kids. Like a regular
    newspaper but in 8 pages and with a lot of illustrations and graphics. Thanks

  body: Sorry for making you clarify what you&#39;d already made clear. Auto could
    really be fun as your sans. You might also consider Cafeteria and Asphalt from
    Font Bureau. For a serif you could use Underware&#39;s Dolly. Font Bureau&#39;s
    Prensa could be good or Farnham. Do you have a budget?

  body: I ain&#39;t got a budget because I don&#39;t even have money to start the
    project. I tested FB Relay &#40;I love his comic look&#41; and Prensa, but I can&#39;t
    afford the prices of Fontbureau. Very good selection, but I&#39;m sure I need
    something more serious than Asphalt.
