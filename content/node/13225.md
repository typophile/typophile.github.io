  day. Typewriters are dedicated writing machines, whereas computers do many different
  things.  I was wondering what kind of software autors use, more specificaly if there
  is some kind of software that lends itself particularly well to actual writing with
  a keyboard.  This is basically a question of interface. I was thinking of a few
  ways of creatng an interface that is suited to writing.\r\n\r\n- Chris"

    About the only extras I like to have are some simple formatting options (style,
    font, tabs), search and replace, and basic spell checking. Being able to paste
    in a graphic is handy sometimes. Everything else just gets in the way. The one
    I like best right now is TextEdit (comes with OS X), but I have used TexEdit (great
    shareware app) a lot, too."

  body: "I like writing on paper, too. If I had some kind of magic paper with undo,
    cut and paste, and spell checking, that would be ideal. It would have to look
    and feel just like pen and paper. Electronic tablets and styluses don't feel right
    to me (so far). Too slippery, too disconnected, and handwriting recognition is
    too unreliable..\r\n\r\nI used typewriters when I was young (thank goodness I
    learned how to type), but they were not very conducive to writing for me. I loved
    the tactile qualities, though."

    quite alot, especially because you can change it to do just what you want. Plus,
    since it's a Java program, it looks and works the same on my Mac, PC and Sun machines.
    \r\n\r\n<cite>Arachnophilia is a good example of open software design -- a design
    the user can change in the field to meet requirements the programmer (me) cannot
    possibly think of himself, including new requirements that do not exist at the
    time of development. By the way, Arachnophilia is a descendant of my classic best-seller
    \"Apple Writer,\" an early word processor for the Apple II that also was field-extendable
    by way of a macro language (in an era when macro languages were virtually unheard
    of</cite>"
