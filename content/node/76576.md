body: "I can\u2019t identify the subline sans from the Upper Austrian newspaper \xBBOber\xF6sterreichische
  Nachrichten.\xAB They are using ITC Slimbach for their Headlines and Lucida Bright
  for the copy (!) so I am assuming that the subline typeface isn\u2019t a custom
  one. But I can\u2019t put my finger on it. \r\n\r\nThe R with the gap is quite distinctive
  and the N with the angled corners, but \u2026 well\_\u2026 I don't know the typeface.
  \r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any helpful reader. \r\n\r\nUPDATE: Could it be Syntax
  with a (custom/alternative) R?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ooen_4271.jpg]"
