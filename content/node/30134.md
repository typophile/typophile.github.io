  press release I received used the phrase \"animated fonts\" over a half-dozen times,
  yet from what I can see these fonts are not actually animated (and how would that
  work, anyway? Multiple faces with slight differences, or a built-in randomizer ala
  Kosmik?).\r\n\r\nCan anyone shed light? They seem to be simply some nicely-drawn
  faces based on animation lettering, but are certainly not \"animated\" by any stretch
  of the imagination, at least not given any definition I've ever heard. Does that
  industry call their lettering \"animated fonts\" even when the lettering is not
  actually animated?\r\n\r\nHere's the actual press release:\r\n\r\n\r\nHOUSE INDUSTRIES
  INTRODUCES \"BURBANK\" COLLECTION OF ANIMATED FONTS\r\n\r\n(YORKLYN, DE) December
  18, 2006 \u2014 In a tribute to the golden age of animation, House Industries is
  introducing Burbank, a versatile new collection of 20 animated fonts. The collection
  will be available January 1, 2007.\r\n\r\nThe collection features Burbank Big, in
  three widths and four weights, and Burbank Small, in four weights of both Roman
  and italic. Designed for mixing and matching, Burbank offers a nearly endless array
  of combinations. \r\n\r\n\u201CUntil now, animated typefaces were drawn as single,
  stand-alone display fonts. They rarely had relatives or a supporting cast,\u201D
  says Burbank designer Tal Leming, who was inspired by the versatility of his favorite
  cartoon characters and the hand-lettered titles of classic animation. \r\n\r\nOften
  stymied by the lack of typographic options for his own graphic design projects that
  called for animated fonts in display and text weights, Leming set to work nearly
  a decade ago to create the Burbank \u201Csuper family\u201D of typefaces. The collection
  features hand hewn fonts from big to small, wide to condensed, light to black and
  nearly everything in between. \r\n\r\n\u201CDesigners need a coordinated, animated
  font family like this. I know that I sure did,\u201D Leming says.\r\n\r\nHouse Industries
  is offering the entire Burbank collection of 20 fonts for $299, including a free
  T-shirt. Or you can purchase the display and text sets separately, for $199 each.
  Burbank Big features the 12 display fonts (condensed, regular and wide in light,
  medium, bold and black weights). Burbank Small includes eight fonts total, four
  Roman and four italic, for use in text sizes.\r\n\r\nOrder online at www.houseindustries.com

  body: Although on second thought, it could also mean there is a bit of Opentype
    goodness happening which gives us an alternate which changes spacing from the
    baseline so it seems a tad more organic in words with two of the same character
    ... or somesuch like that.

    mention anything like that.\r\n\r\nIt would be pretty cool if that was the case,
    though. They throw the word around as if it were a technical descriptor rather
    than simply an aesthetic term, so I'm not sure they mean variance from the baseline,
    although certainly the face does have a nice bit of movement in that respect.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\njlt

  body: "Tal gives us a little more information:\r\n\r\n<ol>\"Uh oh. Looks like the
    'animated' term is confusing people. It just means, like you said, that the fonts
    are bouncy. The display fonts do have two versions of almost every alphanumeric
    character and some OpenType code that inserts them as needed to prevent similar
    forms from occurring in a specified range. But, most of the bounce is controlled
    by the structure of the letterforms themselves. The baselines are systematically
    shifted to ensure proper bounce. The OpenType feature is insurance so to speak.\"</ol>"

  body: Ken Barber has used the word animated before when he was speaking about this
    style of lettering. I don't think it was an error, more a misunderstand. I just
    think we live in a day and age when it is technically possible to "animate" the
    letters using OT technology and programming wizardry.

  body: "Sorry for being so late to respond to this thread. I've been kerning...\r\n\r\n<cite><strong>It\u2019s
    simply an error in the PR copywriter\u2019s judgement.</strong></cite>\r\n\r\nThe
    error is mine. House has been using the \"animated\" term for years to describe
    bouncy typefaces. And, the term has historical precedent. For example, pages 38-40
    of the Photo Lettering Inc. <cite>Alphabet Thesaurus Volume I</cite> (1960) are
    referred to as the \"Animated Gothics\" section. Thus, I thought I'd be safe with
    the term. The confusion probably comes from the fact that we're not hiding that
    my love for classic <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_animation\">character
    animation</a> was a huge source of inspiration for this family. Animated fonts.
    Animated movies. <em>Animatedly animated animation.</em> I simply ran out of terms
    to describe it all. Oh well. Hopefully people will like the fonts.\r\n\r\nAs for
    the questions about the OpenType features and bounce, here's what is going on
    in the fonts:\r\n\r\nBurbank has been meticulously drawn to ensure that all settings
    have an evenly distributed bounce without resorting to any fancy OpenType features.
    This works 97% of the time, but occasionally it needs a helping hand. For example,
    here's a setting showing only the base (non-alternate) letterforms:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/burbank_alt_off_5806.png]\r\n\r\nI
    think it looks pretty good, but the duplicate T letterforms bother me. Being the
    perfectionist that I am, I had to do something about this. So I drew subtly different
    alternates for (nearly) the whole range of alphanumeric characters for every member
    of Burbank Big. The fonts contain OpenType code that inserts these alternates
    only when needed to alleviate Repetitive Structure Syndrome. The result looks
    like this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/burbank_alt_on_4644.png]\r\n\r\nOverlaying
    the examples shows this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/burbank_alt_overlay_5586.png]\r\n\r\nThe
    alternate <strong>E</strong> is inserted because the <strong>L</strong> has a
    similar structure to the <strong>E</strong>, the alternate <strong>T</strong>
    is inserted to eliminate the duplicate form and the rest of the letterforms are
    the base forms. The OpenType code is used <em>only</em> as a fallback for times
    when the base forms don't do enough work on their own. This isn't as flashy as
    <a href=\"http://talleming.com/pages/work/programming/openType/edInterlock/index.html\">Ed-Interlock</a>,
    <a href=\"http://talleming.com/pages/work/programming/openType/randomization/index.html\">Local
    Gothic</a> or <a href=\"http://houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=536&subpage=lux_features\">Luxury
    Text-Italic</a>, but it gets the job done."

    the inside story. Don't sweat the copy, it'll incite a few support calls, but
    I'm sure it won't hurt sales a bit.
