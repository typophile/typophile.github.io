  wonder if there is anyone here to enlighten me. Since Helvetica was implemented
  in 1989 as the official typeface for the system, how well is it faring now? Does
  it still have to compete with the mosaic tiled lettering of old or any other old
  enamel signed remnants of the past, or is it fairly well implemented and governed
  now that it's a much more coherent system? \r\n\r\nThanks, all contribution and
  discussion on the matter welcome."

  body: 'Hi jmontalbano, why would you say that, do you think it adds to the character
    of the city? Plus IRT, IND and BMT are all non-existent companies now. Isn''t
    it a bit contradictory to not have a coherent system since New York''s grid system
    is so rigid. Although please correct me as I must reiterate I have never been
    there and my knowledge of it is very shallow. '

    is completely overhauled (which will never happen) those long-dead transport companies
    still influence the way stations and signage look and feel.\r\n\r\nIf you want
    to examine a completely coherent US system look at the Washington DC Metro. Designed
    and implemented as a single system, it does work well, although it is a bit dark
    in places."

    an organized street grid, but The Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens do not.

  body: 'Ah ok, that''s interesting insight jmontalbano (or James, it may seem?).
    I guess it''s hard to grasp without going there myself, as from what I understand
    of already reading russell''s Paul Shaw suggestion: the majority of signage conforms
    with Helvetica Medium set in white on black, so how can there still be the IRT/IND/BMT
    influence, unless you mean other old signage like the mosaic tiles?'

  body: "Vicke,\r\nI live in the Washington DC area.  The city was an overall plan
    designed from scratch and so was the Metro (subway system).  New York was a pioneering
    city that took on the task \"after-the-fact\" and dealt with unimaginable differences
    of opinion and perspective.  While the DC Metro is wonderful, it is nowhere near
    as convenient as the NYC Subway. The answer \"you can't get there from here\"
    is often heard when asking for metro directions in DC.  NYC Subway may be old
    and take some learning but you can always \"get there\". Because of its history,
    updates to signage is more complicated than it would be here in DC for example.
    The saving grace of NYC is its people. Contrary to what you may have heard about
    Big Apple coldness, the people who live here gladly help you with directions.
    Also, The NYC Police are always around and are very good at directions."

    lived and worked in DC for three months and have to say being used to European
    cities, I find, although DC is almost all regards totally untypical for the US
    (east-coast, city-planning, building heights), already here the negative effects
    of sprawl are plainly obvious. I loved my DC experience, but hated the public
    transport there. Maybe part of it was the bad exchange rate and the price increase
    for the Metro right when I arrived ;) . (That brings me to the question: how do
    you punctuate and use parenthesis in combination with emoticons?)\r\n\r\nEuropean
    cities are just much more condensed, in a comfortable way however, as size-maximizing
    is not the ultimate goal over here. \r\n\r\nIn contrast to that, I have to say
    I absolutely love New York!"
