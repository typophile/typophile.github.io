  is, I've already checked some like \"Circa\", \"Area\", some specifications about
  it;\r\n\r\nThe lowercase \"a\" is mostly circular \r\n\r\nThe lowercase \"l\" (L)
  is a straight line\r\n\r\nThe lowercase \"p\"  is mostly circular and extends below
  the line\r\n\r\nI've attached the font below, any help would be greatly appreciated."
