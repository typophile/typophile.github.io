body: "Myself and an associate are jointly designing a wide sans-serif display typeface
  and are looking for some information on standard character sets and advice on how
  we should proceed with the design.\r\n\r\nWe started this project with the fashion
  industry in mind and designed an entire uppercase glyph set with an emphasis on
  elegance. We discussed the design direction for the lowercase and feel that it would
  detract from the typeface's overall elegance.\r\n\r\nIf we were to proceed without
  lowercase glyphs, would it create a stumbling block for us if we decided to try
  to sell the fonts through a foundry or reseller? Do you think the lack of a lowercase
  would put the foundries and/or potential customers off from accepting or purchasing
  the fonts? We've also decided against small caps and other text-related character
  sets (tabular/lining figures, etc.) as we don't intend this typeface to ever be
  used to set text.\r\n\r\nCan anyone point us in the right direction of a standard
  character set for a display-only typeface (if one even exists)?\r\n\r\nIf the answer
  is that we should definitely proceed with a lowercase, are there any examples of
  wide, sans-serif lowercase glyphs that could be considered elegant?\r\n"

    buy plenty of all-caps display type, and foundries sell plenty. Myfonts doesn\u2019t
    seem to have any qualms.\r\n\r\n<cite>Can anyone point us in the right direction

    for one of the <a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2008/08/extended_latin.html\">>Adobe
    Latin character sets</a> and drop all the unnecessary math characters and ligatures. "

    search for \"standard character set display typeface\"... It just might turn up
    the character sets that different foundries use. Maybe."

    know how smart it would be to not include some of those things. Basically, if
    you want to <em>sell</em> the typeface, it's not really important what <em>you</em>
    would or wouldn't use it for, but what other people can do with it.\r\n\r\nBut
    it's of course your choice. Caps-only typefaces aren't that uncommon. "

  body: All Caps is fine I think. You should put duplicates of the uppercase letters
    into the lowercase slots of the font, not leave them blank. Leaving out letters
    (as opposed to mathematical symbols &c.) wouldn't be a good idea because people
    in non-English speaking countries may need display faces too :)
