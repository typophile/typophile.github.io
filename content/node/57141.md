body: "Has anyone else noticed the beautiful blackletter typeface that is used in
  the New York Times Style Magazine? It is the best blackletter typeface I've come
  across in a long time but I can't figure out what the name of it is, if its for
  sale, or if it was created specifically for the magazine. The only things I've uncovered
  is that the T logo itself was designed by Matthew Carter. I thought that maybe Carter
  designed the accompanying blackletter typeface as well but I've not been able to
  track it down. I have actually e-mailed the New York Times asking about the name
  of the typeface, but of course they haven't answered back. Any clues, suggestions,
  answers would be helpful. Thanks. \r\n\r\n-Mariel\r\n\r\nLink to T Magazine: [[http://www.nytimes.com/indexes/2009/04/19/style/t/index.html#pageName=homem]]"

  body: Yes, that typeface was indeed designed by Matthew Carter. The font name is
    <em>FrakturSix-NYT</em>, which is ironic because the style of the blackletter
    is actually Textur[a] (Gothic), not Fraktur.
