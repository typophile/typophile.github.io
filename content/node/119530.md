body: "If I generate an OTF font, and I have a glyph created for onehalf, will \"1
  slash 2\" automatically be replaced by onehalf, or do I need to build a feature
  for it?\r\n\r\nTried building a feature, but an \"aborting because of errors\" error:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nfeature
  frac {\r\nlookup frac1 {\r\n    sub one slash 2 by onehalf;\r\n} frac1;\r\nlookup
  frac1;\r\n} frac;\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nAlso, what is the easiest way to code for all
  \"(number) slash (number)\" to change into nut fractions?  I'd like this to work
  up into the thousands (333/1028 for example).  Creating a \"sub\" line of code for
  every possible fraction is obviously impractical."
