body: "I'm trying to find out what a couple of fonts are... I've got some close, but
  not dead-on.\r\n\r\nFirst, looks alot like Adobe Birch, but isn't... so many \"western\"
  display faces I can't keep track:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wick3_6231.jpg]\r\n\r\nSecond,
  the main font from the \"Wicked\" poster - I think it's hand done, but looks a lot
  like a simpler Ravenscroft.\r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure the smaller font is Oxford, thought
  it's a little klunky here.\r\n\r\nThanks."
