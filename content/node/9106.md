  anyone know of any typeface that can be recommended for use? <BR>I&#39;d appreciate
  any feedback you have. <BR>Thanks!

  body: I kind of doubt Photo-Lettering is still around but they specialized in psychedelic
    type &#40;when it was &#34;in,&#34; or most likely, shortly thereafter&#41; and
    just about anything else that was popular during the photofilm years. They did
    go digital. I have a number of their fonts, mostly dated from the early 1990s.
    I recall some free fonts that imitate the psychedelic period. You can probably
    pick this stuff up somewhere if you look around seriously enough.

  body: Elsa, I&#39;m serious. <BR>Mojo has a good pedigree, Wilson via Parkinson,
    but it&#39;s only type. All the best psychedelic posters were hand lettered, escaping
    the rigid shackles of conformity, flowing free from the inner recesses of the
    artists mind, liberated by hallucinogens and really long Jerry Garcia guitar solos.

  body: Nick is right.  We did everything by hand in those days.  It wasn&#39;t so
    much that we were &#34;groovy and doin&#39; our thing.&#34;  There wasn&#39;t
    much choice.  There were no computers and the normal way of working was to draw
    everything.  Type was indicated by drawing it. You only had type set after the
    job was approved and ready for production.  There were nowhere-near the type choices
    we have currently.  Brush and paint, pen and ink, exacto knife and rubylith were
    the skills we practiced.  Today, tools of the trade are software programs and
    type choices are broad and very cheap.  You can digitally manipulate anything
    in a snap now.  In the 60&#39;s what you may perceive as type manipulation was
    actually drawn, Photostatted, cut&amp;pasted, retouched film-neg&#39;d, opaqued
    and stripped with colors hand registered on a light box.  We sent a man to the
    Moon then but designers were strictly low-tech. <BR> <BR>ChrisL

  body: '&#62;Would a bluegrass band from the 60&#39;s have a psychedelic album cover?&#60;
    <BR> <BR>No, not very likely.  The 60&#39;s had a rather broad range of design.  It
    was much more eclectic than some people assume.  You had everything from Ben Shahn,
    Herb Luballin, Seymoor Schwast more illustative style in contrast to the modernist
    AG Helvetica International style.  There was also, in advertising, what I used
    to call &#34;The Typeface of the Month Club&#34; style&#34; where a typeface would
    become &#34;in&#34; and be overused for everything &#40;Cooper Black had a longer
    stay than most.&#41; and then die a quick death in disdain.  Psychedelic was actually
    not all that popular beyond the acid rock youth.  Peter Max posters had a fling
    in the late 60&#39;s but most truly psychadelic stuff was done by hand by college
    students. <BR>A bluegrass band would have had more of a straightforward homegrown
    look.  Maybe with hand written title or something more country looking--anything
    from Clarendon caps to a wooden type look.'
