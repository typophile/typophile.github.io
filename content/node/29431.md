  body: "Check out \"Bembo's Zoo\" - a book and a site:\r\nhttp://www.bemboszoo.com/\r\n\r\nAlso
    see traditional Arabic calligraphy, which sometimes uses long -and legible- phrases
    (often from the Qur'aan) to form pictures of various things (including animals).
    The book \"Arabic Script\" by Gabriel Mandel Khan  has great examples.\r\n\r\nLastly,
    our Chris Lozos has a penchant for making pictures (such as his own face) out
    of letters.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Also of note are designs with repeating letters (usually in a circular arrangement)
    to form patterns, arguably the most famous being Licko's Hypnopaedia:\r\nhttp://emigre.com/EF.php?fid=98\r\n\r\nAnd
    then there's a site that dynamically renders snowflakes (although with 8 sides
    instead of 6) out of phrases that the user types in:\r\nhttp://www.typeflake.com/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
