  someone who would like his personal correspondence to have a some style. I'm looking
  for a high-quality serif and am an admirer of Ensched\xE9 Font Foundry fonts like
  Collis and Trinit\xE9 and DTL fonts like Albertina. The problem with these, as many
  of you know, is that they are priced in the stratosphere, way out of the price range
  of the casual user like me.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for something with a similar no-nonsense,
  high-quality look but priced no higher than around $300.00 for the family.  So far,
  I've seen a few things I like such as <a href=\"http://www.underware.nl/site2/index.php3?id1=dolly&id2=overview\">Dolly</a>
  [Underware], <a href=\"http://www.suitcasetype.com/page.php?lmut=en&section=font&font=dederon%20Serif%20Std%20OT\">Dederon
  Serif</a> [Suitcase Type Foundry], and especially <a href=\"http://www.stormtype.com/andulka.html\">Andulka
  Pro</a> [StormType Foundry] but I'd like to make sure I'm not overlooking anything
  before I part with my pennies.\r\n\r\nAny others that should be on my radar?\r\n\r\nDRR\r\n"

  body: "Well, so many kinds of serifs to choose from . . .\r\n\r\nYou won't go wrong
    with StormType. Check out their Open Library collection. John Baskerville and
    Andulka Pro are very well done. Their Open Library seems reasonably priced and
    contains everything you'll ever need.\r\n\r\nScala (and Scala Sans) from FontFont
    (designed by Martin majoor) is one of the most versatile font families out there.
    The serif is warm, inviting, and eminently readable.\r\n\r\nFF Quadraat and Quadraat
    Sans were desgined by Fred Smeijers, a designer for Enschede (I think), and it
    is available from FontFont. Another Dutch masterpiece that seems affordable.\r\n\r\nTo
    be honest, I'm more impressed with StormType and FontFont wares than those offered
    by Enschede or DTL. \r\n\r\nIn fact, here's a list of my top 12 favourite serifs
    (in no particular order.) You're bound to find something you like here:\r\n\r\nScala
    (FontFont)\r\nJoanna MT std. (Adobe)\r\nAndulka (StormType)\r\nPalatino LT std.
    (Adobe)\r\nNexus (FontFont)\r\nParango (FontFont)\r\nDante MT std. (Adobe)\r\nJohn
    Baskerville (StormType)\r\nJannon (StormType)\r\nQuadraat (FontFont)\r\nWarnock
    Pro (Adobe)\r\nRegent II (StormType)\r\n\r\nHonourable mention (exceedingly beautiful
    and well-crafted, but a bit overwhelming for long tracts of text):\r\n\r\nRequiem
    (Hoefler & Frere-Jones)\r\nRialto (DF Type)"

  body: I haven't heard an official statement, but I assume TEFF feels their fonts
    are priced what they are worth. Like The Foundry of UK, they are seeking a certain
    segment of the market. Think Mercedes vs. Chevrolet.

  body: "I have the Enschede's specimen and sample for Collis which is a very unique
    typeface: It is very good looking and a workhorse face which comes with such refinements
    as a complementary font with specially accendet caps for tight leading.\r\n\r\nVery
    few condensed faces do good jobs in extended settings, but Collis is the only
    of this kind which I know to be excelent. If I had a chance I would buy it.\r\n\r\nH\xE9ctor"

  body: "The fonts I listed are all of superb quality, make no mistake, and are generally
    aknowledged as such by the typeface community. Although they are not cheap, they
    are quite comparable to TEFF faces both in breadth of application and letterform
    quality. The real difference is, is that they are more affordable.  \r\n\r\nThe
    work that went into StormType's John Baskerville, for instance, easily rivals
    the most extensive (and expensive) TEFF font family. Scala (along with its sans
    partner) is another example: you'd be hard=pressed to find a more legible, versatile
    typeface that is still interesting without being distracting.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying
    you shouldn't own Trinite or Renard (the latter of which is probably their only
    face, aside from Lexicon, that is comfortable to read in long tracts of text),
    but rather that TEFF prices their fonts with a particular market in mind, and
    not necessarily according to how much work/effort went into producing it. It is
    neither right or wrong, just a way of doing business.   "

    DTL actually took on re-drawing Albertina for digital release, so that version
    might be considered more definitive. I've heard some say the earlier digital Albertina
    was too thin and washed-out, so it might please the letterpress hardliners. \r\n\r\nThe
    TEFF faces I'd really like to be able to afford are Lexicon and Trinit\xE9. They
    perform so amazingly in text. "

  body: 'Update: I have discovered that Monotype and DTL collaborated on the digital
    revivals of both Albertina and Haarlemmer. Frank Blokland oversaw both projects.
    Both were originally developed by Monotype, and DTL did the production, so that
    would explain their release by both companies. Both are considered definitive,
    as Blokland was able to return to the designers'' original drawings, which were
    considerably altered to fit Monotype''s unit system when produced originally. '

  body: 'Following this thread, I would just like to add a general recommendation
    for Undeware''s Dolly, an excellent text font, and one which is not overly expensive.
    If one is looking for a very inexpensive text font, why not try http://www.stormtype.com/free.html,
    and test their Lido. I echo the general feeling that TEFF fonts are incredibly
    expensive, however it really is a case of market strategy. I believe for example
    that Cambridge University Press bought licenses for Trinty: in the right hands,
    this will surely enhance the quality of their typesetting. However for small and/or
    independent design studios, it is almost impossible to offer one''s self such
    luxuries.  Might anyone know whether MT Haarlemmer will be available from philsfonts
    or similar vendors ? '
