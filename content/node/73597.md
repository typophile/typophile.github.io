  body: "@luminum / @Steven Acres\r\nRespects to you two.  I have a different faith
    and express it on the fonts removing the k/K shape at design and coder (html/javascript)
    fonts.  Posting a few website addresses on this forum's threads I suppose has
    caused some impolite emotion.  It's also because it's new to you.  I thought I
    would share it with the forum.  Using an involvement website does not mean I have
    to surrender to another stranger trying to act as if they are the government.
    \ I respect your talents and expertise.  I am a netizen and I am not a scholar.
    \ Also I am not trying to sell fonts or software at a monetary profit from my
    participation here.  Thus as I am from a different 'school' especially including
    racial and religious origin there could be some bias and weasel name calling.
    \ I won't report you to the Police because you are innocent I feel at this time
    due to your conditioning.  Though I had to report today someone elsewhere on the
    net because they calculatedly insulted me and my faith.\r\n\r\nIt's getting late,
    so I will close this post.  \r\n\r\nBest Wishes.\r\n"

    dreamt last night, don't like Special K, got evicted from a K-Mart, or otherwise)

  body: I managed to wade through most of the content on the Kalphabet website. So
    far as I can gather, the argument is that the shape of the letter K is psychically
    disturbing on account of its relationship to a particular pattern of three rivers
    in India and their association with ritual suicide, and that this shape plants
    suicidal ideas in the mind. Leaving side the fact that if one were unaware of
    the association between this shape and the confluence of the Indian rivers and,
    in turn, their association with suicide, one would have no basis for forming such
    ideas -- and leaving aside the fact that this ritual suicide is framed in positive
    terms by texts cited on the Kalphabet website --, it seems to me that the claim
    that the K shape prompts suicidal thoughts is empirically testable.

  body: "John & Dave: well said!\r\n\r\nIt implies this is not a typographical problem
    but a mere psychological one, and therefore discussing it has no place on a typophile's
    hangout. There may be online support groups where you can find a sympathetic ear
    (<a href=\"http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_phobia_is_the_fear_of_letters\">WikiAnswers</a>,
    on 'What phobia is the fear of letters?', categorizes this question under \"Mental
    Health, Medical Terminology\").\r\n\r\nPerhaps it would be different if the as
    yet anonymous o.p. could point out specific typefaces that trigger his suicidal
    tendencies. ITC Kabel and Futura, for instance, have pointy K's. Arnold Boecklin,
    on the other hand, is much more easier on the eye, no sharp edge anywhere. It's
    kind of overgeneralizing to state \"I don't like <em>any</em> of them.\""
