  so that he can get more open space in counters to address his design issue. I've
  recommended him to explore Fontographer. Is there any other software which can do
  this job automatically since he is a graphic design student and can not draw typeface
  from scratch.\r\nThanks."

    of the same color as the background and kern it tighter.
