  appears on the back of a cover for an online game (drakensang.de). My job is to
  replace that text with the translated version. However the text in the layer was
  rasterized, so there is no way to find out what typeface was used. I get a feeling
  of deja vu when I look at it, but can't quite find a match.\r\n\r\nThe quality is
  rubbish, but unfortunately this is how it is in the original file.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance, \r\nKit.\r\n\r\n"
