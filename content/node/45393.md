body: "Hi -\r\n\r\nI've used Font Explorer for a few years now without issue. But
  suddenly, If I go to activate my type, for example. Gotham, Gotham Italic, Gotham
  Light... They all show up as \"gotham\" in Font Explorer. So in a list it looks
  like\r\n\r\nGotham\r\nGotham\r\nGotham\r\nGotham\r\n\r\nThen the style column on
  the far right, it simply says regular. The font files are all named according to
  the correct style of the typeface, but for whatever reason when they are n Font
  Explorer, they come up as the same thing. When I actually activate all of them,
  I do not get a conflict, but in my software they only come up as Gotham regular.
  \r\nI've just upgraded my mac to 10.5.2. But I don't know if this problem was around
  before that. \r\n\r\nHas anybody else ran into anything like this before?\r\n\r\nThank
  you!\r\n"

    A couple of keystrokes in Fontlab and I'm taken care of. Thank you for the direction.\r\n\r\nRoger"

    but have exacly the same problem as you described in the beginning of the thread.
    \r\n\r\nWeird + annoying.\r\n\r\nGot directions?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!"
