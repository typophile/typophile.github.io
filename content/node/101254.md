  its proper license, will this license allow me to use it for indefinitely time or
  could the license change in some time without giving me a notice. Note that i\xB4m
  talking about licenses with no warning about changes in the future. Thanks..."

  body: "In my experience (which is relatively limited) and bearing in mind that I
    am not a lawyer, you are usually bound by the license at the time you acquired
    it. With this in mind there is a distinct advantage to keeping a record of any
    purchases along with a copy of the license at the time of purchase. Seeing how
    the third party IP represented by the Adobe Font Folio has evolved over time it
    has been interesting (okay, from my point of view :-) to see how the support documentation
    for licensing has evolved with it.\r\n\r\nA similar approach could be taken with
    open source fonts as licensing and types of license are subject to change. This
    could be particularly important where a license has changed from, for example,
    the [[http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0|Apache License, version 2.0]]
    to the [[http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL|SIL Open
    Font License, version 1.1]], the former permitting commercial sale of the fonts
    where the latter does not."
