  in the Latin-1 layout and I have a question about the Icelandic eth. \r\n\r\nVertically,
  the character has two parts, the bowl below and the crossed ascender. \r\n\r\nAs
  the resolution descends and there are not enough pixels, is it better to lower the
  height of the bowl and give additional pixels to the ascender, or is it better to
  let the ascender just become a blob of undistinguished but fairly unique pixels
  so the bowl can remain at the x-height, from an Icelandic point of view? \r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for any insights. "

    ascender rise. The UC accents do that after all.\r\n\r\nBTW, one way to \"lower\"
    the bowl is to keep the top at the x-line but make the bowl more teardrop-shaped,
    like here:\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/ohbendy/5462601945\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    also what I do when things get tight.\r\n\r\nThere are some other glyphs where
    there is a precedent for this kind of technique, eg Cyrillic \u0431 and \u0444.\r\nIt's
    also common practice for \"g\" in many sans faces (raising the bowl above the
    baseline to accommodate the extender business)."
