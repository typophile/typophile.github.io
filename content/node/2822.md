  design company I work for. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/24775.gif"
  alt=""> <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve decided to go with a very simple text treatment  and Clarendon
  Light seems very appropriate for the word as well as the target market. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve
  tried to slightly modify the type face in the second and third renditions but I&#39;m
  always a little nervous about tampering with something like that. <BR> <BR>Anyway,
  please have at it! Let me know if what I&#39;ve done works or if anyone has any
  other suggestions. I would be happy to hear them. <BR> <BR>Cheers!

  body: I like the &#34;g&#34; idea, it would help the word sit on the baseline if
    it had a monocular G, plus it would through something cool into a typeface that
    is super hot right now.  <BR> <BR>Aaron

    for the word, but I am partial to Clarendon, having used it for my own logotype:

    <BR> <BR>What is the target market? <BR> <BR>The &#34;a&#34; in version 3 is a
    nice form, but I don&#39;t see how it relates to the rest of the type. If you
    pursued that letterform, you&#39;d have to work the other letters also. It&#39;ll
    take some work, but I think you can make some nice, unique logotype. <BR> <BR>Aloha!

  body: I was typing while others were posting. <BR> <BR>I like that &#34;g&#34; idea.
    I even like that &#34;g-r&#34; ligature. The &#34;g-r&#34; might even serve well
    as an element to carry through other promo pieces. <BR> <BR>graphic design <BR>make
