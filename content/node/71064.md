  World of Harry Potter at Universal Islands of Adventure. I was flipping through
  her photos, when I saw this:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/28204_1486185117068_1307109917_31331518_12137_n_5876.jpg]\r\n\r\nNow,
  I know that the wizards have previously established themselves to not be great graphic
  designers (see [[http://www.typophile.com/node/47828|this thread]]), so I can excuse
  the mismatched alignments in the fares table. But you would think that without access
  to digital technology the wizarding world would provide some sanctuary from that
  oh-so-ubiquitous Arial. But no, even in the wizarding world it appears that Arial
  manages to make its presence felt."

    cities could be, but it's too small to tell.

  body: The R just means it's not Helvetica. This looks like an older gothic. The
    O and D are wide and circular, L is narrower, and the waist of the Y is much higher.

  body: I have always enjoyed the type treatments in the movies. The wizarding world
    is wild and chaotic, so their papers reflect that. Why should they be properly
    designed? I doubt there are any designers in the wizarding world. If I could teleport
    and create fire with a wand, I don't think I'd be a designer, either. :)

  body: The hard kerning (e.g. of "AY" and "AT") works against the vintage feel to
    my eye.

    part of every wizard's education.\r\nSo some wizards are drawn to specialize in
    that more literary, and sometimes even typographic aspect of their world (just
    as some muggles are in our world) -- and devise kerning spells such as the one
    above."
