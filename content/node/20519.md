  body: This isn't a "true" Garamond, I think it's the Jean Jannon roman or a later
    Garamond mistakely based on the Jannon roman. As this is metal, I think it might
    be difficult to find an exact match. However, Simoncini Garamond is close and
    Frantisek Storm's Jannon is a nice Jannon revival worth looking at.

    italic 'z' is quite Goudy-esque, but his Garamont for Lanston Monotype doesn't
    have that 'w' either. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Mike, you're right. Frantisek Storm's <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/jannon/">Jannon</a>
    has this italic <cite>w</cite> and would be an excellent digital subsitute.

  body: 'I haven''t seen a Garamond with such wiggy proportions (see a, s, e, c).
    Goudy''s drawings are much more like the Jannons that were misattributed. Also,
    that was for Monotype. This is set with a Linotype or equivalent non-kerning system.
    Look at j, z, y, r and especially the telltale smashed f. Looks like Andreas found
    it. '

    5) are lousy.

  body: "The Typoart Garamond is one of the finest reincarnations of this theme. But
    you look on a \"italic\" for a linotype matirce - so the italic has to be on the
    same width like the roman. If you read some technical papers about the width limitation,
    the pro and cons of the linotype versus the monotype system, you will find out,
    monotype designs can be made more \"true\" (in case of histrical designs) than
    linotype matrices. There was a different version for monotype matrices too. The
    handsetting version from 14 or 16pt and above is a beauty. Since this book is
    a Romanian thing from the 1960ies, its obviously, they would use a \"eastern\"
    matrice since the hard western money was an issue everytime.\r\n\r\nOne thing
    I like on this Garamond is the kalligraphic and uneven look of the serifs. In
    these digital days lots of historical designs coming with cloned, equalized, hard
    edged serifs and steams. Its easier and faster to develop and look more crisp
    on screen but... the soul is gone. :-)\r\n\r\n--<a href=\"http://www.astype.de\"
