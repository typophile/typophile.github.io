		<div class="commentbody">Miles, very nice - although you should know that I have a weakness for narrow, rigid designs. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It's hard to make significant suggestions to something of such high professional finish (noting for example the slight taper in the lc &quot;v&quot;'s thin arm), so I'll go into &quot;super-picky&quot; mode - which does however mean that my suggestions might hold [even] less water than usual. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The lc Letterforms: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I like the strong square terminals. And the vertical proportions seem to be well matched to the narrowness. Maybe the descenders could be a bit shorter. The half-serifs seem to be completely flat, as opposed to the full-serifs, which have a slight concavity. Maybe go flat for all. Also, I think either the &quot;a&quot; and &quot;u&quot; foot serifs should be flat, or the &quot;d&quot;'s should turn up instead. The &quot;a&quot; is very classy. The &quot;e&quot; might benefit from a stronger top-right curve, and the strong terminal seems to be closing things up too much. The &quot;g&quot; is one of the best bicameral forms that I've ever seen - very elegant - maybe a bit too humanist here? The ear could be stronger. The dots on the &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot; (and maybe even the period) are really too sharp, but I don't know what would work here - maybe rounding the corners a bit. I like strong tails, so the &quot;j&quot; is somewhat of a turn-off (although it contrasts nicely with the &quot;y&quot;). The &quot;k&quot; doesn't seem to fit just right: it's too busy at the base (you might consider giving it the staggered arm structure that the UC has), and the upper arm's flare on the left seems too humanist here. On the other hand, the &quot;k&quot; you have is a very classy form, which does go with the overall feeling - so if you keep it as is, you might want to make the UC &quot;K&quot; have similar armature (not that I think that type of consistency is critical). The &quot;m&quot; might not need to be so narrow. The &quot;r&quot; might benefit from a stronger beak, and maybe a longer righthand foot serif to go along. The &quot;s&quot; is amazing - like a beautiful boa. The &quot;t&quot; initially bothered me, but now I like it a lot. I think the &quot;x&quot;'s lower-left arm being pulled in like that is unbalancing it. The &quot;y&quot; is superb - my attempt at a &quot;y&quot; of that structure for Patria was a fiasco. The &quot;z&quot; is class. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The UC letterforms: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Very solid, without being brutal. The &quot;B&quot; -always a challenge- is masterful. The &quot;G&quot; might benefit from a double-serif. The &quot;J&quot; was bothering me, but now it's fine. The &quot;M&quot; has a problem with being too frail and open. You probably want to control its width in this design, but I really think the middle part has to go lower. The &quot;P&quot; is classy, but a bit recessive. The &quot;Q&quot; -which I should probably reserve judgment on until I see it in text- is a sharp attempt (noting the modulation of the body at the bottom-right), and I guess you want to keep it above the baseline, but I'm not sure you can get away without bringing part of the tail inside. The &quot;R&quot; is killer. The &quot;S&quot; seems to be leaning rightward. The &quot;T&quot; is nice and narrow, but the &quot;V&quot; maybe too narrow. The &quot;W&quot; has a milder version of the &quot;M&quot;'s problem, and it also seems to be skewed left on the inside. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The numerals really work, man. The &quot;5&quot; is amazing. Just the &quot;4&quot; is a bit too shy for me. The &quot;fl&quot; seems a bit tight, and I worry about its strong corner (top-right). The BP seems to be leaning rightward. The &quot;@&quot; is surprisingly nice. Have you thought of making the asterisk upside-down (to draw more attention)? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The spacing is probably not finished, but it seems a hair to loose to me (especially in the rounds). And the blank space character relatively too narrow. Nice quote, btw. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think the single italics idea is really great, but I have to see a working upright one before I'm convinced of that aspect of it. The closest (viable) thing I've seen is Majoor's Seria, and assuming it actually works in context, it still has a slant (which actually varies, between about 1-2 degrees). A couple of *nearly* upright italics (~4 degrees) that do work are Gill's Joanna and Unger's Flora. G Noordzij might have made something, but I'd be surprised if it's non-calligraphic enough to work for text. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Your point about the one weight is interesting. I think it might have great validity for large settings, but for subheads and such it might backfire. One place where multiple weights definitely help is when you're mixing different sizes together but want to maintain color (like in simulating smallcaps). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Overall, great stuff - no surprise. I hope the client deserves the high craftsmanship. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>

I'd love to see it applied in the italics (conventional italics -besides being too fluid- also have a paucity of serifs), but if Miles will be sharing it between the serif and the sans then that's probably a no-go.

		<div class="commentbody">In Fellow Designer's defense: Melior was the first thing I thought of as soon as I saw this design. It really is too close. I don't normally like to chime in with negative criticism here, but seeing as FD has started I thought I should speak up. If you look at the &quot;weak&quot; letters - meaning the ones that attract the eye for the wrong reasons - like the M, W and Q, it looks to me like the designer has chosen to alter the Melior originals but made amateurish design choices. The lc is more consistent, but when you look at the similarities to Melior, particularly at the tell-tale junction of the thick and thin strokes of the y, and of the myriad similarities in the curves and bowl/counter shapes of the g then what else can you conclude?  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Melior is a widely used font, but I don't think it is so widely used as to result in it's letter shapes melting into the general unconsciousness of designers by osmosis in the way that a font like, say, Microgramma/Eurostyle has done. You can almost forgive people for perpetually coming out with &quot;new&quot; designs which look like that. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Paying tribute to an earlier designer is one thing - and if you're going to, then surely you have to acknowledge it - but this seems to me like a blatant squeeze of Melior with insufficient alteration to differentiate it to be able to, in good conscience, call it something original.</div>

This is exactly the point of this forum.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I contacted Miles Newlyn directly to get his work up on typophile a few weeks ago. He is one of my own favorite designers in the field.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For anyone not familiar with the work of Miles Newlyn, he has 2 typefaces distributed through Emigre, which is as far as I know the hardest distributor to get work accepted by in the industry, their fonts are all completely original designs, innovative, contemporary and of the highest standards, so I would say it is safe to say that Verona is completely original. I think it is important to consider the end user. It is a corporate client and I think there is a good chance they used to use something similar to Melior and just wanted something similar. Well that would make the challenge to design exactly that, a type face that is something similar and  original at the same time. I doubt they would be satisfied with spending $1000's of dollars for a couple of tweaks here and there.    <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think it is valid to ask if a design is original or if it is a modified existing design.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I am still working on Unicratica (which I posted last month) there are signature elements from other sans faces in it but this is intentional, as the design as a whole is supposed to be a hybrid of my favorite sans faces, drawn from scratch.   <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I would suggest that when a designer places a post it is stated when the design is a revival or a modification as to avoid the speculation of plagarism.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">While Melior was the first thing that entered my mind when I saw Verona as well, both Fellow Designer and Stephen Coles have made some pretty serious allegations. It may not be necessary for a food critic to know how to cook, but it is still the burden of one making charges like these to supply some evidence of proof of the charges, and &quot;they look similar&quot; isn't enough to meet the charges. If so, the designer of Apple Garamond may have some explaining to do as well. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fellow designer makes the allegation that Miles started with Melior and altered it &ndash; a very serious charge. Stephen charges that Verona and Melior &quot;have some exact points and curves&quot; in common. Are you sure, Stephen? Were to somehow able to compare the two, point by point? If so, please show the evidence as you make the charge, and we will be able to see for ourselves. Otherwise, it is a baseless, and purely circumstantial on appearance, allegation. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As an established professional designer, Miles deserves at very least the presumption of innocence on this one until proof can be supplied otherwise.

The subtleties in Melior's terminals and serifs have been replaced wholesale with a straight-edged and smoother-curved aesthetic, which though artfully done, it has to be said that this is far easier to do than designing new and different curved terminals.

		<div class="commentbody">Hey fellas.

		<div class="commentbody">Stephen: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I agree with the vast majority of your last post, and I think it puts the discussion in the proper context. I'm not sure this is a particularly creative design, nor do I think that it is necessarily particulalry ethical, especially considering that it does derive so much from a font while that font's designer/estate still holds a copyright, and to date we still haven't seen any attribution. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But I also think that if the two fonts were laid transparently one on top of the other, the points and curves would not match precisely. (Check the bowl of the lc &quot;b&quot; and the structure of uc &quot;H&quot;.) Technicality? Absolutely. *Should* it be legal to do? I'm not sure, but probably not, even for non-retail work, as I suspect that the original designer (Hermann Zapf) will see no compensation for this extremely close use of his work. But in taking this approach, as far as I can tell, Mr. Newlyn hasn't done anything different than was done in the design of Adobe Garamond or the design of a custom version of any existing font for a magazine, television network, or any business. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I still stand by my criticism that the original critiques made allegations that were careless and unsubstantiated. As the discussion has worn on, those critiques have become more refined, and that has been my intent in making my posts.

		<div class="commentbody">I must apologise to all contributors. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm only able to get to the web perhaps twice a week for the pleasure of surfing and forums like typophile. If I'd have been able to get back here sooner I'd have been able to stop a lot of people's time being wasted. I was under the impression that the sans/serif etc. forums were a discussion about the aesthetic merits typography, not the issues of originality. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'll put a much clearer intro to my posting for Modena on in the sans forum soon. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So here's the background: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Some years back I was asked to produce a logotype based on Melior. The job never went ahead and I decided to develop the few letters into a typeface. This was called Torino, and after finding that that name had been used for another typeface (a condensed serif, must have been at the back of my mind), I named it after another Italian city, Verona. In not nameing the typeface Melior____ or ___Melior I had obviously considered the design to some degree not Melior at this point, and that has been the discussion here. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The design had been sitting on the hard drive for some years and I'd forgotten about it. When I was approached by the client for which Verona is now intended, I remembered the design, and to my eye it immediately fitted their requirements. Only minor though important changes were made to Torino in aligning some design features with the sans I was also developing for the same client.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In posting Verona here, a far greater number of helpful suggestions have been made than I'd hoped for, and I'm certainly respectful of the focus that it has brought to the source of the design, Melior has some truly wonderful features and I've long been a fan of the super-elipse. I also looked at Century, Renault, Monanti and Marconi whilst drawing Verona. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Those are the details that come to mind at present, I bet there's something important that I've missed. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm certainly don't feel worthy of the kind of defense my name has received above, I'm a type designer that works very much as part of a design team, and in that sense I'm not the kind of self sustaining artist that many of my heroes are; Tankard, Licko, Barnbrook, Blockland(both)to name but a few. The thing is, it's a huge and very confident step to say &quot;I'm a type designer, and I'll have my own studio and do my own thing, and I hope people will buy it.&quot; I did that in the early ninties, and the typeface's that came out were pretty abstract, not the sort of designs that I can make a living from. Having said that, those designs and designs of that ilk (Lee Schulz's work I'm in awe of) are my passion.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In what seems great number of years I've been modifying existing designs for clients simply because very few of them have an understanding of the time it takes to do a new design, and throughout this I've either arranged the proper licence myself, or have had to pester brand managers in countries that have much 'softer' attitudes to licensing to get the proper licence. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Type design is a relatively anonymous art at the best of times, and anyone involved in the creation of new expressions through the letterform deserves credit, those contributors that have raised Melior here are doing exactly that.I doubt we'll ever get to the wonderful copyright/credit model that photographers seem to have maintained.</div>

The only thing some people might ask is: Should Zapf have been asked for permission (even though Melior is paid for)? To me the answer is a clear &quot;no&quot;: that sort of thing can hurt type design more than it can help. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BTW, I'm a huge fan of Schulz too: I think his work is a tantalizing glimpse into the future. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BTBTW, if the italics will be shared, it might be nice to have a name for it.

I just have a weakness for culinary ones!  :-) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Let me rephrase it: A food critic doesn't need to be a master chef. But you know, even that's flawed: haute cuisine is like display typography - it doesn't cover sustenence: the world of text.

		<div class="commentbody">New 2 this site. I'm a graphic design student. LOL. Two people in class mentioned this site. I will never waste a large batch of my time making fonts. I must say that I don't know what all the commocean is about. It was my understanding that fonts are not allowed to be copyrighted so I don't understand a mention of copyrights expiring. I've heard of Zapf. His dingbats are on every Mac computer. So. Do you think Melior does not look like 100 other fonts. Who did HE copy. This is not an original font. We can trace/scan fonts from sites. What legally can they do. Everybody I know screen shots stuff from the typeviewers then does minor clean up. We are students. We are not getting paid for our work. When we get out in the real world we will probably do the same unless our employer has a lot of money sitting around. Well also there are a lot of font disks floating around campus. I don't know of a single student who buys fonts. So if Melior is copied then so what. Is Zapf going to turn over in his grave. These are letters of the alphabet and there is nothing original about them.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">To coin a cliché: I feel like we need some closure here. This was one of the most interesting discussions I've seen at Typophile. On the one hand I feel vindicated by Miles' revelations about the direct link to Melior - although he is still short on the technical details of his work - but on the other hand I realize it's a  serious charge if you accuse a designer of wholesale &quot;borrowing&quot; of another designer's specific bezier curves and points and it shouldn't be made lightly.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don't think, however that we should automatically get down on our hands and knees if and when a *name* designer happens to speak up here. The Typophile forums are not like a fan club where, if a celebrity makes an appearance then everyone lines up to get their autograph and basks in the glory of their brief attention; it's more like (I'd hope) a place of learning and interaction that experienced practitioners might frequent and be subject to interesting and sometimes difficult questions from the students. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Back to Verona: From his words, Miles is clearly revisiting the design but it is not a revival but a reinterpretation. His integrity shows in the work itself (but we could do with a sample text setting at 12 point, don't you think) and in the fact that he came here to discuss the work. Unfortunately, I don't think the hard core font rip-off artists are likely to frequent Typophile, except perhaps for trolling, and so it's unlikely their &quot;work&quot; will be put under the Typophile microsope in the same fashion.</div>

I think it takes a lot of gall to make any recommendations to Miles without first admitting that you incorrectly assumed the worst about his character, using that assumption to make a public attack. Please apologize before you preach. He has been atypically (for a type designer) gracious and humble in not lashing back. Stephen made the same mistake as you (a mistake I myself have made a number of times in the past - like when I once incorrectly accused ParaType of plagiarism - but I apologized pronto), but at least he has the sense to keep quiet. But I guess being anonymous has its advantages&hellip; On the other hand, I'd start using a new pseudonym now, since this one has been tainted. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Martin: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Since rip-offs and shoddy corporate beahavior are commonplace these days, one might be excused for assuming that Melior/Zapf got short-changed. But we should all express relief that this was a case where the original got its full due. On the other hand, I totally agree that celebrity is no excuse for special treatment here. In fact, I try to give celebrities a harder time. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>
