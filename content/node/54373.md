  body: "Normally, when I look at book covers from a far (at bookstore racks, for
    example), I focus on the visual/image/logo first. As I get closer, my eyes definitely
    scans from top-left to bottom-right.\r\n\r\nYou could try putting the book's title
    below the logo, IMHO.\r\nWithout aligning it to the image's curve.\r\n\r\nYour
    logo's outmost outline is bolder than the book title.\r\nI found that a bit distracting.\r\nTry
    blurring your eye while looking at your attached image. :)"
