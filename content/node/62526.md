body: "Hello all,\r\n\r\nI recently came across a serif font that contained a special
  ligature for 'the'. \r\nIf I remember correctly it was a display cut from a larger
  family, but I am not 100% on that.\r\n\r\nGrateful for any pointers.\r\n\r\nSeb"

  body: "Okay, I guess this was a bit to obscure.\r\n\r\nHaving thought about it a
    little more, it wasn't actually a regular ligature.  \r\nThe font has some pre-set
    words, like Bello or Brothers.\r\n\r\nThanks again.  "

  body: "Thanks Kermit, but that's unfortunately not it.\r\n\r\nThe actual font is
    more along the lines of Felix Titling and the pre-set words looked like a connected
    italic or even script. "

  body: "[[http://origin.myfonts.com/s/aw/original/45/0/23097.pdf|Sursum (sample pdf
    linked]] has a THE ligature, although it does not look like an italic, so I assume
    that's not what you meant.\r\n\r\n\r\n--- Tamas Ferencz ---"

  body: Thank you Tamas. Sursum is not the font I am thinking of, but very nice nonetheless.
    So thanks for the tip.
