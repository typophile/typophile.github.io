    guess it's Trade Gothic Extended Bold.  I like the aspect ratio but I want something
    bolder and slightly more rounded.\r\n\r\nThanks for responding!"

    than this, you're getting into <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/creative_alliance/vag_rounded_std_complete_vp/\">VAG</a>
    and <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/itc/frankfurter_std_virtual/\">Frankfurter</a>
    territory.\r\n\r\nOr perhaps you mean \"rounded corners\", in which case <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/paratype/magistral_extra_bold_ot/\">Magistral</a>
    or <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fontfont/ff_max_ot_black/\">FF
    Max</a> may fit the bill.\r\n\r\nBut either way, there's nothing good that is
    rounded, heavy, <em>and</em> this wide."

    can modify that in Photoshop (blur then high contrast) or Illustrator (expanding)."
