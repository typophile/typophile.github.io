		<div class="commentbody">Arlo is dead on about the S. I think you could add a little more overshoot to the N. The middle horizontal stroke of e is really bugging me; it’s the combination of it hanging so low and being so long that it draws attention from th other letters. Also, I think the curves on P are a little too tight to fit with the O, try rounding it out some more.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Really excellent advice all around. I need some objective and fresh eyes. I have looked at it for too long.

The 'S' was bothering me a bit but I was not sure if it was just me. Arlo: what do you mean by 'open up the spine'?
The terminals on the 'S' I really like being at 30's - especially since it feeds into the 'E' on the lower terminal. 

James: I was afraid that raising the middle stroke on the 'E' would look like it was almost centered, but not quite. It also has to work with the 'P' which I would not want to raise the top any more (sorry for the lack of type terminology). You are spot on about the loop in the 'P' though.
The 'N' is a bit narrow I agree.

Any more crit welcome.</div>

If you look at the inside left curve at the top of the S and the inside right curve at the bottom, they don't feel circular. If you open up those counter spaces it will bring the S to a more comfortable place in relationship to the O and P.</div>

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/eyesopennew_3531.jpg]


I have shortened the crossbar on the 'E' to make it less noticeable. The 'S' has been reworked to make it more circular and so has the 'P'. Finally, I have extended to 'N' to give it more visual symmetry.

As always, your input and advice would be appreciated.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Neutraface is awesome and obviously was the starting point for this. I do not own Neutra though so this is all hand drawn. Because of this it is even more geometric with less minor modifications than Neutra which has to work as a complete typeface and not just a logotype. I needed higher crossbars - but not centered. I needed a perfectly circular 'O' and a bigger 'P' that looks more like the 'O'. The 'S' is also a little too closed in Nuetra AND - I got no cash to buy expensive type :)

Futura was never a consideration - but the first face I thought of when I thought of this.

I really want this to work and not because I will not buy Neutraface - it's not quite right for what I want. I have given it a lot of consideration.

My biggest worry is that like what you say Hofe and Kris - I have in some way drawn a 'bad' logotype. I don't want to spend endless time working on a logotype which people will look at and say "why didn't you just buy Neutraface?"</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Don't give in to Neutraface. although it's a beautiful face, nothing beats hand lettered type. Keep working it until you have something unique. I would try adding the slightest bit of stress to your strokes. that will move it away from the pure geometry of Futura and Neutra  and give it a bit more handcrafted feel. But keep it subtle you don't want to end up with Optima.

		<div class="commentbody">Still working on it Lance. I got a little distracted as I started to work on concepts for web. I will definitely upload revisions when complete (next week).

I would still love anyone's two cents on this (good or bad). I understand that to some of you this may seem like re-inventing the wheel, but I would still like to hear that if that is all. Even better would be any ideas on issues with the letterforms.

Right now I see some issues with the optical width of the top and bottom strokes on the 'S'. 

Many thanks,
