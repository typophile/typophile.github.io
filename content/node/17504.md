body: "Howdy,\r\n\r\nWe're working on logotype for a new cafe/wine bar.  We're attempting
  to capture a design direction conveying \"traditional modern\";  clean and simple
  made comfortable, inviting, and accessible.  We're not wanting to rehash the old,
  but also don't want to be starkly modern, chic, or swanky.  The architectural design
  and materials palette (dark woods, white marble, zinc, copper, white tile, hand-rubbed
  plaster, etc.) is a nod to neighborhood establishments of the 1920s/30s that were
  spare and minimal by function, but were also inviting and convivial by nature and
  necessity:  apothecary, butcher shop, green grocer.  From a graphic imagery perspective,
  I look to the international modernist movements of the early 1920s -  early 1930s
  (namely De Stijl and Constructivist, specifically pre-Bauhaus) as inspirations.\r\n\r\nWith
  that background, attached is where we've arrived with the logotype.  At minimal,
  I feel the stroke on the \"N\" is too heavy, but am anxious to have your esteemed
  feedback/critique on all aspects.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nChristopher"

  body: Nice references. Your lettering reminded me of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/futura-display/">Futura
    Display</a>. You might take a few more cues from it, however keep the rounded
    corners. I really like the direction. I wonder if the tagline is not realistically
    too small.

  body: "I like the treatment as well; it's geometric but not too cold. I do agree
    with you about the N.\r\n\r\nThe R feels a bit black too, and the Bs maybe a bit
    too much like 8s; widening them might help."

  body: "Overall, I like it, but the execution has problems all over.\r\n\r\nThe design
    of the characters seems a little wonky throughout. The corners are inconsistent,
    some verticals aren't actually 90 degree verticals, and some of the characters
    don't sit on the same baseline. Your curves generally need work on their transitions
    from curved to straight as well. There are distinct points where they meet the
    straights, which are distracting. I recommend rounding them a bit more. The 'N'
    needs to be reworked completely.\r\n\r\nIf this oddness is intentional, then you
    need to push it further and make it look intentional. If it isn't, you should
    do a lot of cleanup and consistency checking. But, as I said, it's a good start."

  body: "Thanks for the feedback.  Agree with the execution inconsistencies (definitely
    not intentional or desirable).  We\u2019ll clean up.\r\n\r\nWe thinned out the
    strokes and reworked the N and the I.  Not sure I like the overall result.  Kinda
    seems to have lost some of its distinctiveness.  Now going back to previous stroke
    thickness and elongating the barrels on the Bs and Rs as per pica  pushers recommendation
    and reworking the N and I in a variety of ways.\r\n\r\nTagline grew, but without
    any rhyme or reason, going to try to give it some symmetry to colored portion
    of the logotype.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll post a rework.\r\n\r\nThanks all for your input."
