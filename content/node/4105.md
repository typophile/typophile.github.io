body: Hi, can anyone tell me what fonts are used on the Ben and Jerry&#39;s ID? I&#39;m
  not particularly looking for an exact match, just similar looking chunky fonts.
  In particular - the main logo&#39;s slab font with that gorgeous ampersand.  <BR>
  <BR><a href="http://www.benjerry.com/" target="_blank">http://www.benjerry.com/</a>
  <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance.

It was <a href="http://benjerry.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/benjerry.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_sid=RZDhQ18h&amp;p_lva=&amp;p_faqid=128&amp;p_created=947278222&amp;p_sp=cF9zcmNoPTEmcF9ncmlkc29ydD0mcF9yb3dfY250PTEmcF9zZWFyY2hfdGV4dD1mb250JnBfc2VhcmNoX3R5cGU9MyZwX2NhdF9sdmwxPX5hbnl_JnBfc29ydF9ieT1kZmx0JnBfcGFnZT0x&amp;p_li="

    the more successful examples of a proprietary typeface design.

    days.. This thread made me check out the stuff on your website, there&#39;s that
    &#34;Kate Walker&#34; cover you did.. I can&#39;t for the life of me remember
    the name of the typeface you used for that, it&#39;s been troubling me for three
    days now.. What is it?
