body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI am developing a new logo for my  [[http://www.designbits.de|web
  design business]]. I am using the font Frutiger (my all-time favourite) but I'm
  not quite happy with it. I would like to put more emphasis on the \"d\" and \"b\",
  and I wonder if there's another font that's better up for the job. What I have in
  mind is a font with rounded \"d\"s and \"b\"s, i.e. without any serifs, so both
  letters look more like swooshs rather than letters. Can anybody suggest what font
  to use or maybe come up with a better idea on how to make a good logo out of this
  term? Thanks for any input...\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_db2_3648.png]"

    you mean 'b' and 'd' being one shape, instead of a bowl attached to the stem,
    there are several sans serifs that have this. For example [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_dax/|FF
    Dax]]. But that's just one example. I'm sure others can list more. :)"

    alot of quick ideas always helps for logos.

    logo apart? I was thinking about turning the dot on the i into some kind of box
    to make the link to "bits". But that doesn't look that good... It makes the logo
    too complicated. What else could I do?

    there's nothing really wrong with it either. \r\n\r\nPersonally, I've found that
    with your own logo, you can't strive for perfection. It's best to strive for 'sufficiently
    adequate' and let it be, as if you don't, you'll forever be focused on your logo
    to the detriment of getting everything else up and running. Kind of the cobbler's
    kid's syndrome.\r\n\r\nSo, what you have is fine. Maybe let it rest and spend
    some time working on the ancillary branding elements like your web site layout
    and stationery and the like. Perhaps you'll find that extra bit of 'aha!' in those
    elements instead.\r\n"

    type isn\u2019t visually centred horizontally, on the other hand the palette is
    attractive. I think that logos should not necessarily try to represent the qualities
    or skills of a company too obviously, in this arena (web design companies) I would
    suggest that a simple well-drawn logo does set it apart from those that have had
    a batch of filters thrown at it. I am not a fan of Frutiger, although I would
    find it hard to define the reasons for my dislike but taking your post as a start
    I would loosen all the kerning and then work on the positioning in the panel.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "I have to say I agree with Aluminium that it's OK. My own take on it is that
    it reminded me straightaway of <a href=\"http://www.simplebits.com/\">simplebits</a>.
    I think it's more the name than the execution, although the fonts are quite similar.
    Although the name is friendly, so I think the all lowercase wordmark supports
    this and gives a friendly feel.\r\n\r\nDon't overwork it for the sake of it, you
    could have a minimal wordmark, but use another part of the branding to make it
    stand out - think about use of colour.\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying, but if it's
    for a web design company, it'll be used online predominently. That reason alone
    is enough to keep it simple because being used small at 72dpi makes the logo work
    hard.\r\n\r\nSi"

  body: "I also agree with Duckworth on the 'simplebits' similiarity. That was my
    first reaction as well. But, that said, it's likely just because simplebits is
    well known in that small world of pro web designers, so it's likely not a huge
    issue.\r\n\r\nI like Roberts small-capping of the 'BITS' part, though the line
    seems arbitrary and unnecessary. Like Duckworth says, no need to overwork it (though
    I admit that's hard to do when working on your own logo...it's like an itch that
    just can't be scratched...)\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hello everybody,\r\n\r\nThanks for all your input. I saw some of your posts
    too late, so some of your ideas haven't been implemented yet. I fully agree with
    Aluminium in that making a logo for oneself is one of the hardest things to do.
    I've designed a few logos already and found every single one them about 10 times
    easier than this one (the one for my own business) !\r\n\r\nThose of you who spotted
    some similarities with SimpleBits are right too. In fact I'm a huge fan of Dan
    Cederholm and visit his site regularly (I even bought his book \"Bulletproof Web
    Design\" which is a great read by the way). Anyway, I wasn't aware that my surfing
    behaviour would have such an impact on the design of my new logo!!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/designbits_5801.png]\r\n\r\nIn
    my new design I decided to add a box containing the letters d and b to make the
    logo even more recognisable. However, I feel that there isn't enough linkage between
    the box and the type. Can anybody suggest ways on how to link those two elements
    more tightly? I have already applied a subtle background shadow to both elements
    but this alone won't do the trick...\r\n\r\nAlso, why are some people suggesting
    to increase the kerning? That will make all letters wider, won't it? Not only
    the \"it\" bit... Also, how can I \"visually center the type\"?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The dice looks more like a projection than a perspective drawing, the bottom
    left and right corners of the hexagon need to move up shortening the left and
    right sides. \r\n\r\nKerning is used to achieve an apparently equal space between
    characters, one way of seeing this is to squint at the image on a printout (upsidedown
    can help to stop the characters being apparent as characters) currently you will
    see a darker area under the crossbar of the t, \u2018it\u2019 especially, in the
    open counter of \u2018n\u2019 and slightly in the area where the open counters
    of the \u2018e\u2019 and \u2018s\u2019 meet; because of your admiration for Frutiger
    you probably don\u2019t want to alter the characters to alter that, although it
    can be done, I would approach the kerning in two ways; taking the \u2018gnb\u2019
    spacing as optimum and trying to make the spaces similar or the \u2018it\u2019
    or a combination of the two.\r\n\r\nBy \u2018visually centred\u2019 I meant that
    where there is a curve on the \u2018d\u2019 there is a relatively straight side
    on the \u2018s\u2019 so although it might be mathematically centred it should
    shift a touch to the left to appear centred.\r\n\r\nTim"
