  at <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/42914.html?1092687773">my
  new place of employment</a>. At present there is a load of free &#34;fonts&#34;,
  conflicts, broken families and to make matters worse, most of them are catagorised
  alphabetically! Urrgh. So I have devised a new method of catagorisation for the
  mess. Bear in mind that the others using the fonts aren&#39;t really typographically
  aware and &#34;real&#34; classifications would probably make it worse. <BR> <BR>sans

  body: I really like the &#34;Rubbish&#34; selections.  I use a similar but shorter
    &#40;perhaps only American slang&#41; term for fonts I must keep around even if
    they suck.  These are my &#34;Crap&#34; fonts :-&#41;
