  is TxN?\r\n\r\nFor example, StormType sells Baskerville Ten, Baskerville Ten S.Caps,
  and TxN, as part of the Baskerville Ten family. At first I thought it was some sort
  of modified small txt version of the font, but Baskerville Ten is already designed
  for use at small sizes, so it might be something else.  \r\n\r\n"

    and I really can't find a TxN reference on the site. Can you find links?"

    have purchased Storm's JBW set, and I was just wondering the same thing. You can't
    see any difference between the TxN face and the text face in any type software....I
    suppose you wouldn't notice it until you set numerals. And I don't know of any
    other foundry that uses the 'TxN' designation..."
