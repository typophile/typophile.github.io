  about Cars so the Serif should not be to sweet :)\r\nIt's published in several languages:\r\nGerman\r\nEnglish\r\nFrench\r\nItalian\r\nSpanish\r\nPortuguese\r\n+
  Russian\r\n\r\n(also in Japanese, Chinese and Korean, but this is another problem
  but don't hold back)\r\n\r\nCan anyone recommend a good latin+cyrillic serif?\r\nI
  liked Arnhem and Albertina but don't know if they work.\r\n\r\nI would be very happy
  if anyone could help!!\r\n\r\n\r\n"
