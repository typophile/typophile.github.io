  body: 'so, we can&#39;t try to start again here! John Hudson posted a question on
    the chat: Do we need to speak the language to design a good font or something
    like that? <BR> <BR>I think so in some way. As we dream our letterforms in word
    of our own language, I&#39;m pretty sure we don&#39;t see letters in same way,
    for their proportion and so on. <BR> <BR>This remind me a personal experience.
    When I have designed Bienvenue, I never realised that the a is pretty narrow,
    because the combination of it started with teh word France Telecom, and naturally
    the fitting was good until, couple months later, I realised that it was too narrow.
    I dreamed too much of the a in a context.'

  body: '{Changing my torn-up clothes...} <BR> <BR>JF, it&#39;s great to see &#34;linguistic
    sensitivity&#34;! <BR> <BR>In your nice page with the illustrations there are
    some interesting things about letterform width with respect to language. I also
    wonder about two other things: <BR> <BR>1&#41; Variations in vertical proportions.
    <BR>2&#41; Variations in spacing. <BR> <BR>For #1, I would point out your figure
    #5, and note that German relies more on extenders than either French or English.
    Does that mean German needs a smaller x-height? Especially when you also consider
    that German words are longer &#40;and a smaller x-height would allow for less
    overall width of words&#41;? This can also be considered for Latinate languages
    that use a lot of accents - which is one reason Bilak&#39;s Eureka has a small
    x-height. <BR> <BR>For #2, I would point to your figure #2, and note that German
    seems to have more x-height verticals in proportion to rounds - does that affect
    &#34;default&#34; spacing? <BR> <BR>&#40;Man, I&#39;m actually glad I didn&#39;t
    have to type that over 20 lines in a chat room...&#41; <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: Start with German versus French. In 1997, I realized that German use more
    variety/various letterforms than French. More ascenders glyphs in various combinaisons,
    when french use most of the time similar letters, with in some respect, more descenders,
    in fact very flat language physically speaking. So, German type need to be more
    straight, more regular to control all the letters togethers. The various forms
    achieve the rhythm, when in French, the same typeface can quicky be very boring,
    because French is naturally too flat

  body: 'Re: Image #5. Now that I see it, it&#39;s obvious. <BR> <BR>The left column
    shows the freqency of characters without extenders &#40;ascenders&#41; and the
    right column shows the frequency of ascenders for each language shown. &#40;The
    first row is English, the second row is French, and third, row is German.&#41;
    <BR> <BR>French and German seem to differ the most. English and German seem very
    similar.'

  body: Hrant, I don&#39;t think Greman should have smaller xheight? Why you want
    to emphasis ascenders? i will do the reverse, because there is so much, its not
    necessary to &#34;destroy&#34; more the regularity. <BR> <BR>German is lively
    in the forms used, when french is flat in the forms used. <BR> <BR>So, typefaces
    need to be designed in reverse. Lively for french, flat for german.

  body: 'My question was a little more precise than JFP&#39;s summary. I know from
    experience that it is possible to design good typefaces for <i>scripts</i> that
    one cannot read. But I&#39;m wondering how far, within a script, a designer can
    go to addressing the particular nuances of the ways individual languages use that
    script? <BR> <BR>Ironically, I see in JFP&#39;s illustrations the beginnings of
    an analytical, empirical approach to the question. Look, they seem to say, you
    can collect data, you can observe different frequencies of different kinds of
    letters in different languages, you can measure &#40;optically if not mathematically&#41;
    the impact of these frequencies on text. And you can do all this without knowing
    how to speak any of the languages. <BR> <BR>[Of course, this ignores all the purely
    cultural aspects of typography: the things that make French books look French
    even when they contain English texts.]'

    English/Us typefaces too round: too much emphasis on round forms. very large bdpq,
    o compared to n,m etc. <BR> <BR>Nathalie, the classification is built in fonction
    of their various main forms. To try to discern some rules in regard of the language
    used. ok? <BR> <BR>Its not very scientific, its just a way to show something for

    ascenders? <BR> <BR>To improve readability? <BR> <BR>But after what Joe pointed
    out, I might instead ask: does French need a larger x-height? But this contradicts
    Mandel&#39;s statement that culturally authentic French type must have a small
    x-height. What do you think of that? <BR> <BR>Also, what about making room for
    accents? <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>&#62; you can collect data, you can .... <BR> <BR>Exactly!
    Wonderful stuff. Although it might be too deterministic to be &#34;true science&#34;,
    it&#39;s a very powerful sort of tool, not least because its <i>visible</i>. <BR>

  body: John, You right, but in context of non-latin versus latin if you see what
    i mean. <BR> <BR>Your analyse of how we can use these elements of comparison is
    pretty sensible. <BR> <BR>But, I think theses differences are built by designers
    without noticing what they do. <BR> <BR>I imagine Zafp designing a new family.
    He dream as all of us dream letterforms in our language, we saw words in our brain
    composed in an imaginary new and perfect letterforms &#40;another story when we
    try to put on screen the perfect imaginary forms... hum&#41;

  body: Xheight is difficult question Hrant. I don&#39;t thinks its a key thing. no?
    <BR> <BR>In French, perhaps interesting, but more important the various widths,
    what i try to show with the only &#34;french font&#34; I have at the time. Perhaps
    its more obvious with Sabon Next? The image 5 show that French require strong
    difference between round letters &#40;o...&#41; and straight letters &#40;n...&#41;.
    because they are combined all the time in left side. <BR> <BR>On this aspect,
    English is little similar. When German require nothing in particular as the natural
    difference between small letters and ascenders do the job &#40;they naturally
    enough different?&#41; <BR> <BR>The result is a combination of many factors, no?

    images. <BR>just compare palatino and LM livre in german. Palatino rhythm seems
    more better for german, the emphasis seems natural. Not LM Livre, e and c are
    too narrow and don&#39;t bring enough light. <BR>'

  body: '<i>I think theses differences are built by designers without noticing what
    they do</i>  <BR>  <BR>Right, but recognising this is the first step to noticing
    and controlling what you do. I&#39;m sure, if one only ever <i>looks at</i> one
    language in print, that is all you will ever imagine. But I think it is enough
    to look, not necessarily to be able to read, at a diversity of languages in order
    to begin to appreciate the differences and to respond to them.  <BR>  <BR>An interesting
    thought: if a client came to me and said &#39;I want you to design a typeface,
    and it will only ever be used to print text in German&#39;, what would I do differently?  I
    think I would begin by going and looking closely at a lot of German text, so the
    approach to designing for individual languages is quite similar to designing for
    different scripts.  <BR>  <BR>Of course, most of the time, we&#39;re not designing
    for individual languages, but in the reasonable belief that a typeface is going
    to be used for multiple languages. This is even more the case these days, with
    Unicode and OpenType encouraging extension of Latin script typefaces for central
    Europe, Turkey, Africa, Vietnam, etc.  <BR>  <BR>So here&#39;s a question: do
    type designers try to make &#39;neutral&#39; multilingual fonts, try to compromise
    to accomodate the features of different languages, or do type designers each have
    a kind of personal platonic language in their heads for which they instinctively
    design?  <BR>  <BR>Oddly, if I have such a language in my head, for which I instinctively
    design, I&#39;m not sure that it is English. Maybe Latin.'
