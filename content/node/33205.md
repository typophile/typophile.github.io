body: im interrested in making lo-fi handdrawn fonts.  i've already drawn out large
  alphabets for many typefaces, each letter approximately the size of an 8.5 x 11"
  sheet of paper, scanned them in, and vectorized them in adobe illustrator.  is there
  any quick conversion available to turn these files into a fonts?  is it possible
  to cut and paste into a font program?  i know nothing of typographic software, what
  is available, what is possible.  any leads in the right direction would be gold
  to me, so thank you all in advance.  if it matters, i'm running mac os x (10.4.9)

  body: Get "Logo, Font & Lettering Bible" by Leslie Cabarga (Barnes and Noble usually
    has it) It tells you how to do it in Fontographer or get "Learn FontLab Fast"
    also by Leslie. Fontographer and Fontlab can be found at Fontlab.com. Typetool
    also from Fontlab is sort of a Fontlab light and so they have a solution for every
    price range.

    if not always completely satisfying."

  body: ScanFont works pretty good for this sort of thing. It can read in an EPS file
    and output a FontLab- or FontTool-compatible .VFB file. Which means you also need
    a copy of FontLab or FontTool to work with it.

  body: Scanfont for Mac imports your scan directly into FontLab - does a pretty good
    job of tracing into vectors. Scanfont to Fontlab is my standard way of working.

  body: "If I were in your situation, I would look at TypeTool from Fontlab:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/typetool/\r\n\r\nIt's
    only $99 and the interface is nearly identical to FontLab. Here is the feature
    comparison:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontlab.com/fontlab-products/compare/\r\n\r\nSince
    you already have the letters in Illustrator as vectors, I would just paste them
    into whatever program you choose to go with. Otherwise, ScanFont is only $99 more.\r\n\r\nLearn
    Fontlab Fast is worth getting. I will help you get up to speed quickly, and much
    of the content applies to TypeTool."
