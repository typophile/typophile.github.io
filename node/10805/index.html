<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>A few days ago, in the midst of another thread, Hrant posed a 'pop quiz' question (what was Beatrice Warde's mother's maiden name?). This gave me an idea for a new thread, one that might perhaps run for a while. This is a pop quiz thread. Here are the rules: <br> <br>1. The winner of a quiz poses the next question. <br> <br>2. The winner of a quiz is the first person to answer the current question correctly. <br> <br>3. The person who poses the question should declare the winner according to these rules within 1 hour (exceptions will be made in the event that the person who posed the question is asleep). <br> <br>4. After the winner has been declared, there will be a 1 hour grace period during which time the answer may be challenged by anyone who believes that both the person who posed the question and the person who answered it are wrong; the winner may not pose a new question during this hour, or until any resulting challenge has been resolved. <br> <br>5. If the challenger can offer convincing evidence that he or she is correct, the challenger is declared the winner and may pose the next question; the person who posed the question and declared the incorrect answer correct is barred from winning any of the next three questions regardless of whether he or she correctly answers them. <br> <br>6. If the challenger is proven to be incorrect, the original declaration stands and the winner poses the next question; in this event the disgraced challenger is barred from winning any of the next three questions regardless of whether he or she correctly answers them. <br> <br>7. Other rules may be invented by the quizmaster (that's me) as the need arises. <br> <br>8. In the event of inconclusive disputes (e.g. if a challenger proves the original winner to be incorrect but is also found to be incorrect), the quizmaster (that's me again) reserves the right to declare the quiz null and to pose a new question or invite a previous winner to pose a new question. <br> <br>9. In order to reduce the likelihood that the same group of individuals will keep winning, due to their shared obsessions with particular typographic esoterica, no new question may be of a similar theme to the immediately previous question (e.g. if one question is about an obscure operating detail of Monotype keyboarding, the next question must be of a non-technical nature). <br> <br>10. People who don't like the quizmaster's rules (that's my rules) should start their own pop quiz threads; this is called the Democracy of Bandwidth. <br> <br>11. If Gerald Lange objects that this is subverting a serious typographic discussion forum for 'entertainment', he should consider that the quality of questions is in the hands of the people who pose and answer them, and that if all goes well we might learn some interesting facts (in any case, it's got to be better than the very silly 'six degrees' threads) <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0> <br> <br>As this was my idea, and because I successfully answered Hrant's pop quiz re. Mrs Lamberton (okay, so I checked my answer with Shelley Gruendler before I posted it), I will pose the first question. This one is about an obscure operating detail of Monotype keyboarding: <br> <br> <br>HOW FAR DID THE PAPER RIBBON ADVANCE EACH TIME A KEY WAS PRESSED AND DEPRESSED ON THE BANCROFT DESIGN (POST-1899) MONOTYPE KEYBOARD?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Tiffany, my suspicion is that the ribbon actually carried encoded data of the text stream, not images of the type. This ribbon was fed into another machine that set a given font using the data. Right? So there was some fixed metric (or Imperial - more fitting these days...) amount the ribbon moved for each character, and I suspect that happened upon the <i>release</i> of the key (the pressing only serving to punch the ribbon, not move it). <br> <br>BJ, John isn't discouraging guessing, he's disallowing its admission. <br>Of course, I do know the answer, I'm just playing along... ;-> <br> <br>On the other hand, we do need a rule that says what happens if nobody gets it (and after how much time). <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Hrant is correct about the mechanism: the ribbon recorded data in a pattern of punched holes at regular intervals. I'm pretty sure he's also correct that the ribbon advanced when the key was depressed, but I'm not 100% sure which is why I worded the question to avoid that issue. <br> <br>BJ, I do encourage guessing, but not the admission of guessing. Wouldn't you rather guess the answer and have everyone think 'Wow! Who knew BJ was so knowledgeable about Monotype keyboard operation?' <br> <br>The question remains live: just what was that regular interval between hole patterns on the ribbon?</div>

<div class=commentbody>I spoke too soon... <br> <br>WE HAVE A WINNER: <br> <br>Rodolfo has the correct answer: 1/8 inch <br> <br>Well done. <br> <br>I expect there are numerous sources for this information. I found it last night in Bapurao S. Naik's <i>Typography of Devanagari</i> (Bombay, 1965). I believe the 1/8 inch advance was standard to all Monotype machines, but phrased the question the way I did because I'm not sure that it was so on the very earliest machines. The machines that Bancroft designed in 1899 became the model for all subsequent machines. <br> <br>Unless there is a challenge to this answer within the next hour, Rodolfo may pose the next question on any subject except technical operation of hot metal composing machines.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Ha! Cool. <br> <br>Are you challenging me, Hrant? Don't be a sore <br>loser, respect the hanging chads of my monotype <br>ribbon. You have 48 hours to comply, or... <br> <br>Hmm, asking a good question is more difficult <br>than answering one. Well, I'll ask something <br>about the modern movement, that's what interests <br>me more. I'm not sure if this is too easy, so <br>I'm subdividing the question in parts. If this is <br>against the rules, the quizmaster may rephrase <br>it as he sees fit. <br> <br>At the height of the Swiss typographic movement <br>there was a magazine that embodied its spirit, <br>its editors being so rigorous that someone once <br>dubbed them the 'death squad'. What was this <br>magazine - or rather, since it was a trilingual <br>magazine, what was its name in each of the <br>languages -, who were its editors, and for how <br>long did it run? (Well, this last item is not really <br>fundamental). <br> <br>Bonus question: in which typeface was the <br>masthead of the magazine set?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Ha... that would be <i>too</i> easy, Hrant. <br>Wrong. <br> <br>Remember that the magazine you're referring <br>to, TM, being a trade magazine, embraced all <br>aspects of the typographic/editorial trade, <br>not only what we now call the "Swiss movement". <br>When this was in its heyday, it would be, of <br>course, the gist of TM, but TM wasn't, say, <br>the movement's "standard-bearer". <br> <br>I should add that the magazine I'm talking about <br>is no longer in circulation.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Vetsch would be in a different time frame. <br> <br>But chara Matha got it! Congrats Matha! <br>One major glitch: it was not "Le nouvel art graphique" <br>(you're cheating!) but "Graphisme actuel": <br>Neue Grafik, New Graphic Design, Graphisme actuel. <br> <br>Two minor glitches: it started in September 1958 <br>(it may have ended in '65, I'm not sure, but there <br>were 18 issues indeed.) and it was Neuburg, not <br>Neuberg: Josef M&uuml;ller-Brockmann, Hans Neuburg, <br>Carlo Vivarelli and Richard Paul Lohse, the death <br>squad. <br> <br>Now, you still owe me the masthead's typeface <br>(very easy one, it was mentioned in another <br>thread in this forum very recently).</div>
