body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm brand new to the forums, please excuse any posting errors until
  I learn the ropes.\r\n\r\nUsing Fontlab Studio 5 in OSX 10.4.11 I have made a OpenType
  font to be used in phonetic English lessons. \r\nThe font I have made has quite
  a few 'multiple character' glyphs - for example the English word \"ARE\" appears
  as a single glyph with a carat above the three to signify that it is a single character.
  The above character is comprised of the three letters \"A R E\".\r\nHave I violated
  some fontmaking law by having three characters grouped like this ?\r\n\r\nMy problem
  is that this \"ARE\" character is being cut off on its right side after printing.
  Two other 'multiple character\" glyphs of similar width suffer the same effect.\r\nI
  am 'fairly' competent with FontLab Studio, I have manually set the right margin
  for this glyph so that the width is around 1500.\r\n\r\nI cannot find any entry
  for width in the \"Font Info\" in regard to Open Type fonts.\r\n\r\nThe DTP program
  I am using is PageStream for OSX Beta 18 which seems to be sensitive to Open Type
  fonts yet it does display and print 60 of the 75 characters I have created in this
  font.\r\nI have about 2,000 lessons I created in OS9 Pagestream to print and am
  only being held up by this 'cutting off' printing problem\r\n\r\nAny advice, suggestions
  welcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
