  body: "Thanks for the repy. I've looked through Dafont, but i'll look again.\r\n\r\nI
    don't think the second one is \"Rock It!\" because the \"c\" and \"e\" aren't
    anywhere close to the same. And the markings look different too. But it is similar.\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    Nevermind I was looking at \"Rock It! DELUXE\"instead of the normal Rock It!"
