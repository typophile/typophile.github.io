  and a friend of mine are doing the following research:\r\n\r\nWe're working on a
  project about the relations between communication and homossexuality. More specifically,
  the way homossexuality/bissexuality was present, revealed or treated by Western
  Culture media along History. We're searching for images/videos which could possibly
  illustrate those different periods and the different society/political/cultural
  reactions towards homossexuality (acceptance, condemnation, or tolerance). This
  image research has a focus on magazines, books, campaigns, movies, documentaries,
  products, publications and other media which had in the past and has nowadays an
  influence on the public perception about this topic. We're looking not only for
  mainstream media but also media more directed to the gay community, to analyze/compare
  inside-community and global perceptions.\r\n\r\nIf anybody can help us with some
  resources, we appreciate.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot"
