  body: Eww. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s even good enough for T-26. Looks  <BR>like
    someone took parts of letters and mashed them  <BR>together in a lame freeware
    grunge attempt &#40;which means it  <BR>might be hard to find&#41;. The &#39;s&#39;
    is just upside-down.

  body: It&#39;s a T-26 alright. Pterra. I like it, personally. Reminds me of some
    of the type Margo Chase designs. You can buy it at  MyFonts.com &#40;<a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/pterra/"

    luck.
