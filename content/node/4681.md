  sans but I would be intersted to hear your thoughts. <BR> <BR>thanks <BR>s

  body: Strange that this has gone unaddressed. <BR> <BR>I think you need something
    pretty and rigid - not a common combination. Maybe Today Sans? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Seria Sans sounds like a good choice. Sebastian by Frantisek Storm might also
    work.

  body: Thanks for your input guys <BR> <BR>I think I am going to stick with seria
    sans &#40;which seems to work pretty well to my eye&#41; if for no other reason
    than I don&#39;t have the other two fonts suggested. <BR> <BR>Unfortunately this
    client could not afford to buy a face I don&#39;t already have - otherwise I would
    use the excuse to get Sebastian! <BR> <BR>thanks again <BR>s
