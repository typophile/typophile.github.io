  ID Pop Quiz.</li>\r\n<li>Try to identify the typeface. To win, you need to name
  both the typeface and the weight.</li>\r\n<li>Show off your knowledge by casually
  mentioning additional trivia, like who designed it, when and by whom was it (first)
  published, and other cool stuff to impress your fellow Typophiles with.</li>\r\n<li>The
  winner produces a new challenge -- a complete glyph, black on white background,
  presented in a 288 x 288 pixel square, including a R204G000B00 1 pixel border.</li>\r\n<li>The
  person who posts a challenge can't win the next game.</li></ul>\r\nIn case of any
  disputes, I will act as judge, jury and avenging angel of wrath.\r\n\r\nIf you think
  this is a little too difficult, maybe try the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/entry_level\">Entry

  body: "Yes, Nina, 1000\u2030 correct! Sorry Craig, you\u2019re too late \u2026\r\nIt
    is <a href=\"http://www.lucasfonts.com/case-studies/calibri-consolas/\">Consolas</a>,
    \u2018the de facto successor of the ubiquitous Courier\u2019. The second glyph
    is a long s (\u017F), as you might have guessed. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s
    a frequent need for that character in <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/41253\">programming</a>,
    but \u2018all six Western typefaces in the [<a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/typography/ClearTypeInfo.mspx\">ClearType</a>]
    collection were to be developed [\u2026] with the same robust glyph set for all\u2019
    \u2014 <a href=\"http://www.lucasfonts.com/case-studies/calibri-consolas/\">LucasFonts</a>.
    \r\n\r\nDid you know that Consolas comes with a number of alternates for some
    lowercase characters? There are no less than four variations on the \u2018r\u2019
    \u2013 per style, that is. Switching those alternative forms on can change the
    look of the typeface quite dramatically \u2013 which reminded me of Hypatia Sans,
    and Nick Shinn\u2019s <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/33619\">thoughts about
    its manifold faces</a>. Alas, unlike Hypatia Sans, Consolas\u2019 alternates aren\u2019t
    organized via stylistic subsets, thus toggling them is more difficult.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/consolas_3799.png]\r\n\r\nNow
    it\u2019s your turn, Nina!"

    I didn't know that, although I guess something like that is bound to happen when
    Luc(as) 'Gazillions Of Weights' de Groot is limited to four styles only. ;-)  That
    alternate 'r' in your lower line is pretty, uh, expressive for Consolas!\r\n\r\nLooking

    \u201C<cite>The Droid family of fonts was designed by Ascender\u2019s Steve Matteson
    beginning in the fall of 2006. The goal was to provide optimal quality and reading

    an operating system for mobile devices. Android was developed by Google and was
    released under open source license \u2013 consequently, fonts were also licensed
    under the same open source license. They are free, but I think there is a more
    important implication that fonts can be used in web design in their native form
    (\u201Craw\u201D) in non-IE browsers.\r\n\r\nThey also display good on Windows,
