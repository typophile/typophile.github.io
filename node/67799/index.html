  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi! :)</p>
<p>Here is my first approach on type design. It&rsquo;s a friendy sans serif font with slightly rounded corners, large x-height and wide lettershapes. It&rsquo;s name says it all – designed to be used for body copy in magazines in around 10 point size.</p>
<p>Because it is supposed to be used in print, it lacks of proper hinting (autohinting only actually), so tons of hinting errors may occur. Sorry for that. I hope I can improve hinting as soon as I find some advice how to hint a font properly. See (or even better print) the pdf for a better view on Brevier Ten.</p>
<p>Brevier Ten features some OpenType functionalities like ligatures, discretional ligatures, contextual replacements, lining and old style numbers, caps, historical forms and ISO-Latin 1-3 Glyphs.</p>
<p>Dan Reynolds helped me allready A LOT with the process of designing this font, so thank you very much, Dan. :)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really looking forward to read your thoughts, critique and suggestions on this! So fire at will. ;)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi David,
First of all, I like it, especially the ligatures.</p>
<p>Maybe the bottom curve of /e/ needs some redrawing, it isn&rsquo;t flowing nicely.
/w/ and /W/ are a bit wide.
Flag of /r/ could be a bit bolder.
/m/ could be more narrow.
Not sure about the rounded corners on /E/, /F/ and /L/. Somehow they don&rsquo;t fit in.
Color of /C/ is too light.
Emphasise the bowl on /D/, /P/, /R/.
/s/ leans a bit backward.</p>

<p>thanks for your kind words and your feedback. One question regarding that: What exactly do you mean with &ldquo;Emphasise the bowl on D, P, R&rdquo;?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m rechecking and tweaking the design a bit now. Round corners from E, F and L stay in the font, however. I think they match the overall round-ish feeling of the font. Edged alternates are implemented for those who dislike them.</p>
<p>In addition I started working on a bold version. I&rsquo;ll post an update as soon as it is complete.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s you perogative to keep the design as you make it of course. Perhaps make a few more characters with rounded corners&hellip;? As you say, you&rsquo;ll make alternates. How about two fonts in one family, one with rounded corners (all the caps) and one with straight corners? Just a thought&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi David, I&rsquo;m really not <em>such</em> an expert but here are some thoughts. Take with a grain of salt, or two :-)
I think this is already quite nice! The texture is good and it reads nicely, even in small sizes. Nice degree of character too. I hope you have the patience to spend some more time ironing out the little wrinkles (zooming in reveals the curves still need work).</p>
<p>Especially the lowercase reminds me a bit of <a href="http://typophile.com/node/65841">Ben&rsquo;s work</a>, in terms of its slightly gummy friendliness. One thing I&rsquo;m not sure about are the rounded corners on straight ascenders and descenders. That seems potentially gimmicky. I love what that «curvy corner» does on the descender of the &ldquo;j&rdquo;: there it quite successfully hints at a curve that isn&rsquo;t actually there. Same in the &ldquo;q&rdquo; maybe (where I&rsquo;d actually put it the other way round). But in the &ldquo;h&rdquo; etc, it&rsquo;s not supposed to be a curve – the rounding just seems to be «decoration»? Thing is, people may see it as a «curve» there as well – and then it can make the letters look a little backslanted. 
But maybe that&rsquo;s just me.
Also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of the straight-to-curve transitions, especially on «inside» contours, are bumpy and jarring, like in the &ldquo;u&rdquo;.
– &ldquo;t&rdquo; seems a little unhappy. Maybe needs a more stable foot? And/or make it [more] off-vertical.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m not sure the shape of the &ldquo;a&rdquo; is different enough from the &ldquo;o&rdquo;.
– Diacritics: Why is the tilde cut vertically, not perpendicular to the stroke, as with other diacritics (see the caron)? Also, I think the ring is too small.</li>
</ul>
<p>Caps: I enjoy the technoid rounding. But the lowercase feels more coherent; I&rsquo;m not quite sure all caps speak the same (stylistic) language yet. The &ldquo;B&rdquo; for example is bumpy and a bit strange in terms of how it flares its strokes, while other caps are very straight and rigid (like the &ldquo;E&rdquo;). The &ldquo;G&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t yet sure where it&rsquo;s going either. &ldquo;W&rdquo; is wide. &ldquo;J&rdquo; is cool, but I&rsquo;m not sure that corner works in the context of your soft, curvy caps. Maybe there <em>is</em> a coherent system in all this, I&rsquo;m just not really seeing it right now. :-<br>
Also:</p>
<ul>
<li>I like the &ldquo;R&rdquo; a lot, but something with the contrast isn&rsquo;t right – its right side seems much heavier than the stem?</li>
<li>The &ldquo;M&rdquo; has quite unconventional stress too, is this intentional?</li>
<li>Bottom-left of the &ldquo;U&rdquo; (and others) are bumpy, see above.</li>
</ul>
<p>Smallcaps: I really dig the rounded slightly-stressed flavor.</p>
<ul>
<li>Are they the exact same height as the lowercase? You <em>can</em> make them taller – trust your eye. To me they now look possibly too small.</li>
<li>Widths and spacing might need a little more work.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;d make the smallcap &ldquo;G&rdquo; a bit narrower, and possibly lower its crossbar (and maybe make it a bit longer).</li>
<li>Smallcap &ldquo;Q&rdquo; might benefit from a stronger tail.</li>
</ul>
<p>Numerals are very cool!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Wow altaira, thank you very much for your detailed feedback! I read it like the 5th time and I really enjoy your view on the design! :)</p>
<p>Some questions/thoughts on your input:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You are absolutly right with the &ldquo;curvy corner&rdquo; thing going on with all the descenders and ascenders. It&rsquo;s more an decorative feature. I now think about dropping it and making all the ascenders plain like the &ldquo;I&rdquo; but keeping the curvy corner on &ldquo;j&rdquo; and maybe even bring it to &ldquo;J&rdquo;, however I fear &ldquo;J&rdquo; would not be distinctive enough then.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ll check contrast of &ldquo;R&rdquo;. All curves are ca 10 Units heavier than the verticals for optical compensation. Maybe the &ldquo;foot&rdquo; of &ldquo;R&rdquo; is optically too heavy, even if its the exact same width than all similiar diagonals. And even the width of the vertical stem in this case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;M&rdquo; differs in width of the stem from all other capitals, indeed. Mainly because I had serious color/texture problems with &ldquo;M&rdquo; and &ldquo;N&rdquo;. So I made their vertical stems 20 units smaller than all other vertical stems to get it brighter. And I pulled the outer stems in a slight diagonal position get more whitespace on the inside of &ldquo;M&rdquo;. You are right, thats a really bad solution, since it&rsquo;s the only character with &ldquo;semi diagonal&rdquo; stems. I will try to redraw them from scratch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The straight-to-curve transitions … I have problems to see which are bumpy and which are not but I am sure that is because I am such an beginner. :) I will review all the transitions. Do you have a hint how I can draw them smother?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are perfectly right on &ldquo;B&rdquo;. I will redraw it from cratch. :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;J&rdquo; has a unique descender indeed. One of those &ldquo;happy little incidents&rdquo; i liked and kept. ;) There is no coherent system in that, so it is not your fault. :) I will think about what to do there. Thanks again for your detailed feedback here! :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Smallcaps are exactly the same height as the lowercase. Thats one of the &ldquo;coherent ideas&rdquo; in this font. A lot of aligning heights are shared by different features. Like the height of diacritics is also the cap height. Maybe that is too much here. I am not sure about that.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Again thank you for your feedback. :)</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Just this quickly, I&rsquo;m struggling for time… 
Lining things up is certainly a very human impulse. :-) One thing about type design though is that – especially in text type, and very especially in text type for smallish sizes –, there&rsquo;s much less of a point in actually lining stuff up mathematically. It has to look/feel/work right, and for example small caps often look too small when they&rsquo;re exactly as tall as the x-height. 
In such cases, I&rsquo;d say quickly trying out 2 or 3 different sizes and trying to see what looks and feels better is much superior, as a method, to lining things up and then trusting it <em>needs</em> to «look right», well, because it «is right». :-)
You&rsquo;d need to, of course, mix words in smallcaps into running text to see how well it works. BTW, regarding your sample, I&rsquo;d strongly advise for ragged-right text setting (also linksbündig/Flattersatz für den Lauftext), otherwise it is near impossible to see how the spacing and texture of the font really is.
Cheers!</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for droping by Nina. (:</p>
<p>You convinced me. I will do tests with height of small caps as soon as I get into near of an laser printer. You are absolutly right. Mathematics are most often not the best solution to pick when designing a typeface (curves seem thinner, crossed lines broken, overshoot, etc.). I just wasn&rsquo;t aware of that optical effect (small caps looking smaller than aimed for). I have to admit I spend much more time in the lowercase characters than the small caps. Shame on me. ;)</p>
<p>Thanks a bunch for your advice about alignment of the specimen. I spend so much time in FontLab and I tend to mess everything up because I am not patient enough with actually setting it in InDesign. I just forgot (how could I?) that justified text brake up the wordspace.</p>
