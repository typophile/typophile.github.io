  body: Possibly hand-drawn, the 2 /G look different. Reminds me a bit of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/harry-pro|Harry
    Pro]]. Part of /R and /G, the rest could be approximate with [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/Futura|Futura]].
    Funny because design of these 2 letters look quite different from the rest, borrowed
    from elsewhere? May be from [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/Blippo|Blippo]] or
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/pump|Pump]]? Even if it's very different, I like
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hvdfonts/niveau-grotesk|Niveau Grotesk]].
