    and made specifically for coarse newsprint screens. \r\nLooking for more choices
    than the tried and true list: \r\nCentury, times, Excelsior, Ionic, Paragon, Corona,

    more since most are printed on Web Offset these days?"

  body: It is important to note that while Gerard Unger's typefaces were designed
    for use in printing for the news he designed for the new technology. Or in other
    words, the fact that the paper and printing process had improved drastically and
    could now print crisp sharp lines and shapes.

  body: "Miss Tiffany you are right about that in the cases of Gulliver and Capitolium
    News. Swift however can bear quite a beating, and i would claim that it survives
    bad printing better than the 'old workhorses' like Ionic No 5 or the other Scotch
    Roman news-print typefaces contemporary to Ionic. I mean \u2013 just look at the
    example above. As a matter of fact I don't get why these ancient faces are still
    in use? Familiarity?"

    so the design probably took into account the poorer printing qualities.'
