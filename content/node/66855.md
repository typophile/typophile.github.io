  Journalism and I'm doing a bit of research on behalf of my school before our visit
  to TypoBerlin. We do have three days before TypoBerlin where we'd like to visit
  some relevant studios in Berlin and I wondered if you have some ideas? \r\n\r\nWe
  have though about MetaDesign, EdenSpiekermann, Node Berlin and the Vitra museum,
  but any ideas would be very helpful.\r\n\r\nThank you very much in advance,\r\nJulian
  Hansen\r\n"
