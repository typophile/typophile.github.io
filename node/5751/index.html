		<div class="commentbody">Nick, Hrant, Thomas and Gerald all in the same place. It's one  <BR>big happy love fest. I sat by Nick during the entertaining, but  <BR>tediously long Linotype awards (seven honorable mentions for  <BR>crying out loud). You'll be glad to know that Nick speaks his  <BR>mind in person as much as he does online. (Kudos Nick for  <BR>being true to your brand. =) Jared and I are deejaying the  <BR>Saturday night party. I can't wait to see Nick kick it to some  <BR>house jams. <BR> <BR>I took the Ultrafonts class, Designing Type for Mobile Devices. It  <BR>was co-hosted by Ultrafonts cohort, Hrant. I had no idea he was  <BR>working with Ultrafonts, but it's not at all surprising. Their  <BR>presentation was great, very hands on. I've never met Hrant in  <BR>person. He was as helpful as he usually is in the critique forum. <BR> <BR>I'm having a great, great time. For me, TypeCon is as much about <BR>people as it is about type and that's the way it should be. It was  <BR>great to finally connect a face with Randy Jones and to see Grant  <BR>Hutchinson and his classic Chuck Taylors. <BR> <BR>Regarding the <a href="" target="_blank">Linotype awards</a>. There were a couple scripts <BR>that are really great. But the one that blew me away was not  <BR>type, but symbols. The husband and wife collaboration of Karin  <BR>and Peter Huschka, he an advertising art director and she a  <BR>textile designer yielded <a href="" target="_blank">Picture Yourself</a> with some truly <BR>great forms that are interchangable, meant to be layered and  <BR>formed into patterns. The black and white samples don't do it  <BR>justice. Imagine it in bamboo and celery greens, layered and  <BR>overlayed. Great. <BR> <BR>A word about Interrobang. It's much improved over last year's.  <BR>Nice job Stewf. (Proof that paper matters!)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">For better or worse, for me meatspace is much more docile than online fora. I got along with almost everybody - credit to <i>them</i> mostly. It was a really great conference - quite possibly the best ever I've been to - although it'll take weeks to see it objectively - as with anything so heady. It was great to be back. Special thanks to Tamye. <BR> <BR>BTW, Miles, TC98 was special, wasn't it*. The giddy &quot;exploring the unknown&quot; delight is gone now, but in terms of value and pure rockin' fun 2004 rules bigtime, and apparently it gets better every year. Helsinki or New York&hellip; Now that's an open question. <BR> <BR>* And talking to Stuart it's clear that feeling is pervasive - something magical happened back then. And maybe it was my imagination, but whenever two of us from the Old School (like Brian, Allen, Richard, James, Simon) eyed each other in SF we had this certain knowing, quiet smile. Bob was there too. But I guess this conference will generate its own nostalgia as well. <BR> <BR>BTW, thanks to Jared and Joe (duh), Typophile was like a subcurrent running through the entire conference: most blind intros referenced this place, even particular threads! Major symbiosis. Or mutual parasitism.  ;-) <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, I felt similarly about last year's conference which was my first. Maybe the first TypeCon&ndash;whichever one it was&ndash;will always have a special quality that can't be repeated. <BR> <BR>As far as meatspace vs. online goes, when you talk to someone in person, you have much less opportunity to be misunderstood because you not only get the words, you also get body language, facial expression, tone of voice, etc., and it's much harder to forget another person's humanity when they're standing right in front of you. <BR> <BR>I think a good portion of what passes as debate online simply comes down to the difficulty of communicating through such a limited medium as text. They touched on this a bit in the Underware Typeradio presentation.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I just wanna say how great of an experience my first TypeCon was. It was truly amazing and so much more than I could have expected and I'm now 100% sure that I'm doing the right thing with going back to school to study type. The best part was meeting so many people &ndash; now I can hear your voices narrating when I read your posts. <BR> <BR>Much respect to eveyone involved with puting on the show.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">After having such a great time in Minneapolis, I was really upset having to miss this year's event. I may be a mere type fan and not a type designer, but nobody seemed to care. There I was having lunch with Mark Simonson or playing hearts with Steven Coles or signing Dave Farey's programme&hellip; just a bunch of font-geeks hanging out and talking about their passion without having to explain that, yes, someone actually has to design all those little letters they read every day. <BR> <BR>I can't miss two years in a row. See you in 2005.</div>
