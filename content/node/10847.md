  body: Hmm. Andrea declares Rodolfo the winner but then Rodolfo challenges his own
    answer within the allowed hour, but his challenge is based on information provided
    by Andrea when she was declaring him the winner. Is it any wonder the rules have
    nothing to say to such convoluted circumstances! <BR> <BR>I believe the only correct
    answer to Andrea&#39;s question is <i>From Russia with Love</i>, since this film
    predates <i>Goldfinger</i> and is the only one in which the actual titles of the
    film are projected onto the body of a <i>dancing</i> woman. So Andrea was wrong
    to declare Rodolfo the winner. <BR> <BR>Andrea is hereby requested to pose another
    question, on a different theme, within the next 12 hours. Thank you.

    more than others. Name the 5 and give their function. <BR> <BR>Cheers. <BR> <BR>ps:

    <BR>In the 1980s, a certain prize winning, English language author wanted large
    sections of his first novel set in different colours to capture the rhythm of
    the singing voice. Unfortunately, his publisher refused so he came up with a new
    system. <BR> <BR>Who was the author? <BR>What was the novel? <BR>What was his
