body: "dear friends! it's about my very new type: Seaside, contrast sans-serif.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/seaside_poster00_3687.jpg]\r\n\r\nit
  shares proportions and basic shapes with [[http://use.type.org.ua/tagged/osnova|Osnova]],
  so they will plays well together.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/seaside_poster01_6232.png]\r\n\r\nnow
  it covers only western latin charset, but more features, faces and languages will
  be added soon, i hope.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/seaside_charset_display_4168.png]\r\n\r\nplease
  look closer:  [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/andrijtype/seaside/|Seaside@myfonts]]"
