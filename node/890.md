body: Can someone tell me what this font is.  Sorry about the poor image.  My scanner
  isn&#39;t working, so I tried to &#34;recreate&#34; what the font looks like.  It
  appears to be a modification of Garamond.  The ascenders and descenders are also
  longer than usual.  Thank you for your help! <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/14037.jpg"

    it for me and post it today.
