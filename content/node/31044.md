body: "Hi kids\r\nWhile I was researching post-war reconstruction in the British magazine
  Architectural Review I\u2019ve found the following articles by [[Nicolete Gray]].\r\nI
  thought I post the references (and the first lines) here in case someone is looking
  for them but has no time to go through all editions like I did. I hope you find
  it both useful and enjoyable. Gorgeous photos accompany the articles and I think
  it\u2019s worth having a look if this is your cup of tea. I could only take photocopies
  ( no scans) but let me know if you need further details and I shall oblige.\r\n\r\n\r\n<cite>1953
  November / vol.114 / number 683</cite>\r\nTHEORY OF CLASSICAL: Much of that heritage
  comes to us from the last century, when sign-writers and publicists, driven forward
  by the inexorable pressures of Victorian commerce, broke into new fields and devised
  new and original forms.\r\n\r\n<cite>1954 April </cite>\r\nNot found yet.\r\n\r\n<cite>1954
  June / vol.115 / number 690</cite>\r\nEGYPTIANS: Their suitability to contemporary
  architecture. Undoubtedly, the Egyptian is the best architectural letter that has
  so far been invented. And, indeed, it was probably invented as an architectural
  letter. J.Callingham, the author of some of the first signwriters\u2019 manuals,
  writing in 1871, mentions it originated by signwriters at the end of the 18th century,
  and later copied by typographers.\r\n\r\n<cite>1954 August</cite>\r\nNot found yet.\r\n\r\n<cite>1954
  October</cite>\r\nNot found yet.\r\n\r\n<cite>1955 April / vol.117 / number 700</cite>\r\nMODERN
  FACE AND FAT FACE [sorry didn\u2019t find the article yet]\r\n\r\n<cite>1955 December
  / vol.118/ number 708</cite>\r\nLETTERING: MINUSCULE. Lower case, little letters
  or minuscule-what shall we call them? For undoubtedly they are important in public
  lettering, not for monumental purposes, but as a possible and suitable alternative
  for a multitude of ephemeral and unpretentious uses.\r\n\r\n<cite>1956 August /
  vol. 120 / number 715</cite>\r\nALPHABET: If we have rejected the theory that an
  alphabet based on the Trajan column lettering is the end-all of monumental lettering,
  if beyond that we have decided that the theory of classical lettering formulated
  at the Renaissance covers a part only of the possibilities of lettering as an art,
  what then is the nature of that art? By what criteria can we judge it? How can we
  tell what is good and what bad, what legitimate and what, if anything, illegitimate,
  or when indeed a letter is a letter?\r\n\r\n<cite>1957 April / vol.121 / number
  725</cite>\r\nSTREET LETTERING: Without doubt the first consideration in the designing
  of street lettering should be to insure that it fulfils its purpose; that it should
  be immediately legible. But, since it is a necessary adjunct to every town street-and
  indeed most streets are insufficiently labelled-it is also of importance that it
  should be an ornament to its locality, a pleasure to the inhabitant as well as a
  convenience to strangers.\r\n\r\n<cite>1957 October </cite>\r\nNot found yet.\r\n\r\n<cite>1958
  July / vol.124 / number 738 </cite>\r\nMATERIAL AND DESIGN: Until the invention
  of printing, the dominating factors in letter-design were the tool employed and
  the surface on which it worked. The trail of brush on papyrus, the slant of the
  quill on vellum, the bite of stylus or chisel in wax or stone, these circumscribed
  the forms and indicated the directions of experiment. Lead type and paper extended
  the range, but the manual skill of the punch cutter was limited by the slowly-improving
  quality of type-metal, and cultural snobbery, however high-minded its motivation,
  retained the forms of humanistic minuscule, Trajanic capitals, Fraktur and chancery
  script in the alien materials of print.\r\n\r\n<cite>1959 April / vol.125/ number
  747</cite>\r\nEXPRESSIONISM IN LETTERING: A piece of lettering is not just an abstract
  design. The design is conditioned not only by the material from which it is made,
  and the purpose for which it is made, but also by the idea in the mind of the designer,
  which can never be purely formal because he must be aware at least of the meaning
  of the words which he is inscribing.\r\n\r\n<cite>1959 May /vol.125/ number 748</cite>\r\nTHE
  MODERN MOVEMENT: We have in previous articles surveyed many different sorts of lettering,
  different types and different ideas and uses, but the problem which arose in the
  very beginning still remains to be answered; which of the traditional styles of
  lettering are best adapted to the modern style in architecture or does it demand
  a new or exclusive letter of its own?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    Gray in 'Letter Letter' and then in 'A history of Lettering' and was hoping she
    was still around to talk to. So I went to look her up online. Sadly she died in
    1997. Apparently she is one of the first people to specifically shoot photos of
    letters while on vacation. \r\n\r\nWhich of these articles was most interesting

    Lettering is mind blowing as it is so in tune with the spirit of the magazine
    and the Townscape methodology (the art of juxtapositions in the built environment)
    so fashionable in the mid 50s/60s in England. She describes how certain name plates
    add something to the character of the place, giving it continuity, unity and individuality.
    She provides wonderful examples (Bath, Cambridge, Venice) and analyses the differences
    and\u2026boy, she can write. Nothing is left out, legibility, proportions, purpose,
    contrasts, material, lighting. Modern Movement is brilliant; I love Macintosh
    lettering and you can really see how it was integrated in the building. I could
    go on forever but if you are interested in the relationship between lettering
    and architecture, this is a must. I have to thank Prof. Morley for introducing
    me to N.Gray, I admit I was in the dark. Far from being a scholar Chris! Lol!
    Now, gentlewoman\u2026I like that!"

    took pictures. If you would like to see pictures from that walk I'm sure there

    <em>XIX Century Ornamented Types and Title Pages</em>, which I miraculously found
    at my local public library. Nicolete Gray's refreshing admiration for the slab
    serifs and fat faces of the Industrial Revolution is a great corrective to the
    view that only book types are to be admired and considered \"good\".\r\n\r\nIf
    you haven't yet seen it, the book Eben mentions, <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/History-Lettering-Creative-Experiment-Identity/dp/0879236124/sr=1-1/qid=1170312571/ref=sr_1_1/104-9672182-5386346?ie=UTF8&s=books\"

    my hand April, August, and October 1954, and April 1955! The articles look wonderful
    and are rich in photographic examples.\r\n\r\nOctober 1957 is missing, so can't
    help you there -- it looks as if my father subscribed up to December 1955 and
    then left off until January 1960.\r\n\r\nThe bindings are quite fragile, as you
    no doubt discovered when you were making your photocopies, but I think I may be
    able to lay one page of the spread down on my flatbed and allow the rest of the
    mag to hang in space vertically so as not to break anything.\r\n\r\nNow the bad
    news: I am leaving tomorrow morning for 10 days. So in late Feb or early March
    I can scan these and send them to you. I can also upgrade your current photocopied
    examples of June 1954, and April and December 1955 since I have those as well.
    \r\n\r\nA more general question: since this is post-1927 material (at least 1927
    is the magic number in the U.S.) then does copyright prevent me from making these
    available for public reading, say on Typophile site somewhere? I'm never sure
    about these things."

    worries Bruce, there's no hurry. Every day I discover more material even here
    in Brazil. The main library at the FAU USP (architecture and Urbanism university
    of S. Paulo) is excellent, it's just a matter of time. Don't do anything that
    will damage the magazines and always wear gloves! \r\n\r\nYesterday I received
    an authorization by email from the AR editorial staff to reproduce part of an
    article on the SP university's periodical. They say they only need me to print
    a credit line line \"First published in AR month/year and reproduced courtesy
    of The Architectural Review\" because it's for academic purposes, maybe for Typophile
    is the same? I don't know. Probably. In any case they asked me to confirm that
    I would do that and I have the email printed just in case.\r\nAnd Happy Valentine
