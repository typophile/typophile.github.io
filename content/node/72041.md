    does not match all rules and exceptions. (Nevertheless it is a cool feature.)\r\n\r\nI

    > Keyboard Shortcuts, then select the list of keys for the panels. There is a
    list of shortcuts named Characters:OpenType. And there is a possibility to add
    a keyboard shortcut for historical variants of glyphs. You can't access this feature
    through menu, only via keyboard. An easier way to access the feature is to use
    free plugin Keyboard Shortcuts by DTP Tools (http://www.dtptools.com/product.asp?id=ksin)

    that's very clever, but perhaps it's best to include this \"historical\" feature
    as a Stylistic Set, although that would still be no guarantee it wouldn't be misused
    by unsuspecting Germans.\r\n\r\nAnyone who wanted to use it \"seriously\" would

    it presents, which is pretty standard, IMO, for English.\r\n\r\nIt's true that

    is correct, because the first part of the word does not end in a s.)\r\n\r\nA

    it was present in typefaces that were imported to Poland, typesetters adopted
    the glyph to be used as the graphic representation of the Polish \u201Cnasal e\u201D.
    The other nasalized vowel (\u201Cnasal a\u201D) was represented as an \u201Ca\u201D
    with a thin, simple stroke \u2014 which did not at all look like the \u201Cogonek\u201D

    is present in the font, you don\u2019t have the problem with the big space, as

    with regard to the \u017F-ligatures, although it would not require much efforts
    to create them, if the f-ligatures are already present. In most fonts \u017F and
    f are almost identically with regard to the shape. If you have a \u017F followed
    by a \u017Ft-ligature in the German word \"gewu\u017F\u017Ft\", this looks very
    ugly and inconsequent in many typefaces. Either no ligature or an \u017F\u017Ft-ligature
    or the Eszett (\xDF). Is it somehow contradictory to make use of the longs and
    to follow the reformed German orthographic rules?\r\n\r\nI assume, that there
    are no or almost no German words, in which you could use a \u017F\u017Fb-ligature,
    but the \u017F\u017Ft-ligature could be used very often in German (in contradiction
    to the fft-ligature). And it would not cost the typedesigner much efforts to add
    all these \u017F-ligatures to fonts.\r\n\r\n(I just had a look on the features
    of [the genial] Williams Caslon. The font contains a horizontally shortened alternate
    f. [More fonts should contain a shortened f! Typedesigners forget the accented
    letters, that are used in combination with the f, too often.] I don\u2019t know,
    whether it also contains a shortened \u017F, but it should.)\r\n\r\nSomehow I
