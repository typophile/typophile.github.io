body: "I thought this might be of interest to some, even though it's not necessarily
  Type-centric (though there are definitely some interesting posters in the collection
  with hand-made typefaces).\r\n\r\nI recently came across the WPA poster library
  at the libary of congress:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21111931/\r\n\r\nThis
  is the poster that caught my eye:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wpa1_teeth_4256.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnyways,
  I put a bit of a write up here:\r\n\r\nhttp://brokesnob.wordpress.com/2007/09/21/diy-wpa-art-prints/\r\n\r\nand
  included a PDF of a version of said poster that I re-traced as vector art for those
  that'd like it for your bathroom too. ;o)"
