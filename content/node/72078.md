  outside Madison Square Garden. All of the reporters seem to be in the same place
  and I couldn't help but notice the lettering on the awning behind them (pictured).\r\n\r\nAt
  first glance I thought this to be ITC Blair or Sackers Gothic Heavy but the G doesn't
  match up. Anybody have any idea whether this is actually a typeface or just a modification
  of one of the others?\r\n\r\nCheers."
