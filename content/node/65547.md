body: "Hey guys,\r\nI'd like to ask for some input. I'm designing the cover of an
  indie mag and have gone with Kursivschrift for the masthead. So I've put it to the
  paper size as it's in the jpg attached, basically just the font type for now. I'd
  like to know if the spacings between the letters are alright, or basically any input
  that you guys might have.\r\n\r\nThe mag is targeted for women aged 20-35, into
  the indie fashion and arts scene. Keywords that may describe are feminine, whimsical,
  pastel, artsy, illustrative.\r\n\r\nI appreciate any thoughts on it. Thanks so much
  in advance.\r\n\r\nRiz"

    the left? It sticks out a little.\r\nAnd I know it's the font but maybe try customize
    the t so that it won't touch the y? Then you have to make shorter endings for
    both the t and the l."

  body: "Thanks Lasko.\r\n\r\nI have cleaned it up a bit and tried to shorten the
    tail of the t to mirror the l, so here are before/after with/without tail touching.
    Looking at those two, I think I already have a preference, but which would have
    more votes? Let me know what you think. Thanks!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.stylmagazine.com/Cover%20test%20v21.jpg\r\nhttp://www.stylmagazine.com/Cover%20test%20v22.jpg"

  body: "I like the linked version too.\r\nI might try pushing the title's /l/ a hair
    to the right. \r\nIn the subtitle, I see relatively larger spacing between d and
    i, and between t and y, than the other letter combinations. (ind ie st yle)\r\nWould
    you consider dropping the ligatures, or maybe particularly the /in/ ligature?
    My opinion is that it muddies up the text at that size. Conceptually they work
    but visually I'm not sure."

  body: 'Try these: use a lower case S on the flag (it is not a masthead, that is
    something else entirely). I think the resulting shape might be more attractive.
    Also, try a sans on the subtitle: it will provide some contrast, and I find that
    the fancy ligatures in that detract from the main title.'

    agree that it works better without the fancy ligatures. The lower case 's' also
    looks attractive, but I find that it makes the overall visual less strong. I think
    I would stick to a higher case 'S' and decide between serif or sans. What do you
    think?"

  body: Funny, after looking at all the iterations of this and agreeing with some
    as stylish modifications, I kind of lean back toward the original, but with alteration
    of the ligature in the subtitle. I think your first impulse/vision was close.
    I also think the lower case S makes it seem a little too precious.

  body: "Kursivschrift is a great choice. Considering the context, I would make the
    \"s\" lc (which might give [more] reason to make the subhead all-caps - see below).
    However without a tall cap \"S\" the heights of \"t\" and \"el\" become more sensitive;
    I might make them [optically] equal.\r\n\r\nThe cupped terminals should be sheared
    flat (possibly at an angle, but still flat); the cupping there is actually intended
    for lo-fi rendering (it keeps the ends sharp-looking).\r\n\r\nThe \"t\" isn't
    asserting itself enough; I'm not sure how to improve it though.\r\n\r\nThe \"yl\"
    gap should be increased.\r\n\r\nThe subhead font: None of the fonts you've tried
    so far do it for me. I think it should either be a dark, contrasty sans, or a
    wide monoline. Especially if you choose the latter I think all-caps might work
    best.\r\n\r\nBTW, there an elephant in this room: what's the mag's text font?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    all, the cups are removed from the head, and \"yl\" gap increased, though I will
    keep the S a high case. So then I went to try several other types for the sub.
    The first is the same as previous, for comparisons sake. Second is a little playful
    perhaps to better suggest \"indie style\". Third would be to try wide monoline
    in all caps. Fourth is the same as first, trying in all caps.\r\n\r\nThe mag's
    text is to be primarily [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/lido-stf/|Lido STF]]
    by Storm. I thought perhaps I should try that font for the sub, hence the fifth.\r\n\r\nWhat

    43 is nice but maybe a bit cold/technical; 44 and 45 might work but are a bit
    noncommittal and blah. I think I'd personally go in the general direction of 43
    (wide and monoline and sans seems good), but try to make it just a hint warmer
    (but not as generic as the Helvetica). Hm\u2026 maybe something like Ezzo. Or
    maybe Paralucent (which might be more stylish), or Zeppelin (if you want more
    width)?"
