  blogs about Helvetica and would love some help with my latest uni assignment please...\r\n\r\nI
  am working on a research paper about Max Miedinger (life, influences etc) and the
  design of Helvetica.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know of any good reference links they could
  direct me to?\r\n\r\nAlso do you know when the movie may be coming down under to
  Sydney?\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\n\r\nBec"

  body: "It is my understanding that not a lot is known about the development of Helvetica\u2019s
    design other than what Gary tracked down for the film. Until the film came out
    there was even still some debate as to whether or not or not Helvetica was based
    on Akzidenz-Grotesk (it was). Also in the film, Matthew Carter\u2014who knew Miedinger\u2014states
    that not much is really known about what was going on while Helvetica was being
    designed. It might be a good idea for you to write about a typeface that has a
    better-known history than Helvetica."

    celebrating its 25th anniversary, is every bit as original a design as Helvetica,
    and more up-to-date, so perhaps more relevant to the 21st century.\r\nUnless your
    course is design history, why not investigate a contemporary typeface?"

    looking our for it. \r\n\r\nI was considering researching Arial. Good idea Nick,
    I maybe able to find more on a more contemporary typeface.\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "We're working with the AGDA to set up several screenings in Australian cities,
    these will happen in October and November.\r\n\r\nAnd there's plenty of information
    about Helvetica's development, some of which is featured in the film, but a lot
    more of which had to be left out if the film due to editing constraints. And Alfred
    Hoffmann of Haas is compiling a new book with Lars M\xFCller about the Helvetica
    story, utilizing all the archival material Hoffmann has. No word on when that
    book will be published, but I'm assuming 2008.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.lars-mueller-publishers.com/e/publishers/programm.php\r\n\r\n"
