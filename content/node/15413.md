  that looks close to calligraphy handwriting. Nothing too hectic, something legible.
  I've recently designed my brother's wedding invitations, and I'm going to be printing
  the inner and outer envelopes. So it needs to look good as an address (and something
  the post office can read!).\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nJason"
