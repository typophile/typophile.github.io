body: "Hi everyone, \r\nI'm in awe of the the accumulated typography skill, knowledge
  and taste assembled on this board, so I'm asking sorta nervously for you to critique
  a design.\r\n\r\nI'm entering a competition to desgn a logo for a nearby neighborhood's
  summer festival. Here is the challenge, as it appeared in my email:\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\"White
  Center's \"Jubilee Days\" is looking to update its identity for 2009 to more reflect
  its community. White Center is the most diverse community in the greater Seattle
  area, having 80 cultures, speaking 50 different languages. I would like to see that
  spoken to in the logo.\r\n\r\nWhat is needed on the logo-\r\n Name: White Center
  Jubilee Days\r\n Theme: Living the dream\r\n Date: July 19th & 20th 2009\r\n\r\nThe
  logo will be used on T-shirts, banners, buttons, and all related printed material.\r\n\r\nI
  am accepting black and white roughs to start with. I will then select 3 finalists
  and ask for full color versions.\r\n\r\nAs an artist myself I realize the amount
  for work that goes into creating an identity....\"\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nWhite
  Center is anything but White, as the man says. The present community leadership
  is looking to turn the gritty and tough identity into friendly international pride.\r\n\r\nThe
  theme \"Living the dream\" refers to Martin Luther King's \"I have a dream\" speech.
  It sure is not the \"American Dream,\" as this hood has probably the lowest per
  capita income in the area.\r\n\r\nBelow are some previous Jubilee logos - to give
  you an idea how truly bad were the graphics before someone realized this kind of
  thing wouldn't improve their image.   \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/JD-buttons-s_6206.jpg]\r\nLooks
  like generic Balloon and Brush Script, doesn't it?\r\n\r\nHere is my black and white
  design:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jubilee-logo-solo_4626.gif]\r\nHere
  is how it might look on a tee shirt:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jubilee-logo-bw-tee_5752.gif]\r\n\r\nI
  wanted to represent typographically the many cultures in this area, especially Thai,
  Cambodian, Vietnamese, Latino, Pacific Islander, Native American, and Arabic as
  well as African-American.\r\n\r\nI felt the type needed to be \"foreign-looking\"
  and eccentric, yet still quite legible at a distance and to someone who has learned
  English as a second language. \r\n\r\nCritique away...\r\n\r\n1.The image in the
  center represents a Native American \"sky basket\" bronze sculpture on a tall pole
  at the gateway to this hood, just dedicated last year. \r\n\r\n2. The words \"White
  Center\" and the date are in a font identified only as \"Dingaling Bold\" in my
  folder. I have no idea where it came from or its true identity - please help me
  out here. Obviously I tweaked the font to make the \"Thai\" circles, but the W is
  the original W, although it resembles a Russian \"sha\". Because the phrase has
  no descenders, I thought an arch would be attractive.\r\n\r\n3. The Words \"Jubilee
  Days\" are in Nick's font \"Yo Quiero Taquitos,\" but I reversed the descender on
  the Y to resemble a Cambodian character. \r\n\r\n4. The words \"Living the Dream\"
  are in a font called \"Jive Talk\".\r\n\r\nTHANKS in advance!! "

    surmise:\r\n\r\n1. The design sucks so bad you don't know where to start, and
    don't wanna hurt my feelings by telling me to delete it and start from scratch\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n\r\n2.
    The design is so brilliant no one can add a single suggestion for improvement,
    and y'all are jealous\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n3. My choice of fonts offends your professional
    sensibilities\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\nI don't know.\r\n\r\n~ Dina\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Too much going on, including too many different fonts. And inconsistent style
    of graphics. Scale way back.

  body: "Or we're digesting what we're seeing before we start critiquing... :-)\r\n\r\nFirst
    thought: Not enough unity. Community, although we often celebrate our differences
    and diversity, is ultimately about being united. The design right now just isn't
    communicating that, it's too disparate and not unified enough. And the flower
    and sun graphics look too clip-arty. If they're going to be integral to the design,
    integrate them. The text should be more unified and they shouldn't be 3 different
    typefaces. Anyway that's my first thoughts. I'll have more suggestions later as
    time permits.\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for the feedback so far.\r\n\r\nBut don't forget the director wants
    to see cultural diversity reflected in the design.\r\n\r\nI'll see what it looks
    like if I start with the same font for the top two lines - although with international
    alterations. "

  body: I would suggest taking one or maybe two font families and use it throughout
    the design (using different weights to create rhythm and differentiation). But
    feel free to add little tweaks to the letter shapes that suggest the diverse cultural
    influences of the community. Also the tagline "Living the dream" needs to be integrated
    with the rest of the design. Right now its it's own separate design and competes
    for attention in a distracting manner. Perhaps the words "White Center" and "Jubilee
    Days" should form a circle around the tagline which would help incorporate the
    tagline into the design.

  body: "Here is my second draft. Now there are only two fonts. \r\n\r\nThe hibiscus
    flowers and sun are repositioned to flow into the design better. The sun is a
    Native American sun, and the flowers symbolize the native Hawaiian and Samoan
    communities, a big part of the festival. They would recognize that. \r\n\r\nFeedback
    is appreciated. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jubilee-logo-2nd-draft_5509.gif]"

    loved the painterly underscore for \"Living the Dream,\" but you are right, it
    did compete with the rest of the design. \r\n\r\nBreaking up \"Jubilee Days\"
    in to two lines makes it a more pleasing shape, I feel. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "The dots, flower and sun are all really distracting to me.  You have some
    pretty intricate letter forms and pictures all competing for attention.  \r\n\r\nJust
    because it has to convey a multi cultural feel, doesn't mean it has to be cluttered.
    \ Strong designs are usually very simple, with a clear message."

    direction.\r\nThe circle ornament does not flow smoothly off the W.\r\nI'd capitalize
    July.\r\n\"Living the Dream\" looks like its letters are arranged at only three
    different angles - I'd try to make it arc more gradually like \"White Center.\""

  body: "You know, it has mentioned that you should limit the number of faces. Looks
    like you have dismissed this very good piece of advice because, possibly, you
    may feel that the type is the only way to do this.\r\n\r\nIf I were you, I would
    rework this with one or two faces, possibly with differing weights of the same,
    and include icons that signify the different cultural backgrounds.\r\n\r\nAs it
    is, the ONLY reference I see to any nationality is the Jubilee Days have a Mexican?
    feel. You may be assuming that your perceptions about the type and icons are reading
    to other people. This may not be the case."

  body: "eliason: thanks for the feedback. \"Living the Dream\" looks like an irregular
    arc, I suppose, because of the \"g\" descender and the original font's uneven
    baseline. I will try to smooth it out, using a curve as a guide.\r\n\r\nJupiterboy:
    I have not dismissed the advice. I did eliminate one typeface. Now I have \"Yo
    Quiero Taquitos\" as the base for the first three phrases, though I added the
    international details.\r\n\r\nI did use a different font for the numbers because
    the numbers in YQT were extremely square and didn't seem to go with the letters.
    I wanted the zeros to be perfectly circular, to \"thai\" in with the circles in
    the lettering. \r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nYou asked, where are the international references?
    They are listed below. I see these forms on signage every time I walk around White
    Center. \r\n\r\n1.The circles in the type are from Thai lettering. \r\n\r\n2.
    The reversed curl and sharp angle on the y's descender in \"Days\" resembles Cambodian
    lettering. \r\n\r\n3. A (Spanish) tilde instead of a dash in \"19-20\". \r\n\r\n4.
    The stripes and zigzags as well as the decorative ends on \"Jubilee Days\" are
    Mexican or Guatemalan.  \r\n\r\n5. The dots over \"i\" are turned into lozenge
    shapes reminiscent of the diamonds in Arabic lettering. Anyway they are \"foreign,\"
    not English.\r\n\r\n6. The hibiscus flower which some of you disliked is a symbol
    of the Samoan and Hawaiian cultures. That is iconic for them.\r\n\r\n7. The sun
    is a Native American shape - this is the way it's stylized by tribes in the Pacific
    northwest.\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \r\n\r\nIf I have to explain all that, maybe it isn't
    working. But I think the people in this hood will recognize those things.\r\n\r\nThe
    challenge for me is to incorporate these details into English type so they say
    \"charmingly foreign and eccentric\" - but still very legible. That is why it
    helps so much to have fresh pairs of eyes critiqueing the lettering. \r\n\r\nThanks
    for the feedback, it's helping."
