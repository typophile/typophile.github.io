  outsider for some time and must confess that this is by far the best Typograpy related
  site on the interweb. Kudos to the creator(s) and members!\r\n\r\nSo... my first
  post comes in the form of a request for help. I'm struggling to find a not-so-popular
  font that is similar to Century Gothic and Avant Garde (both having an 'a' shaped
  the way most people would normally handwrite it, e.g. circle with stick to the right
  (Apologies for my lack of correct terminology))\r\n\r\nThe typeface will be used
  for body copy, so it would need to have a large variety of weights and of course,
  be easy to read in large chunks of text. I would also prefer if the font was slightly
  condensed (not as wide as Century Gothic).\r\n\r\nTo add, I'm also not a fan of
  Avant Garde's 's' being so squooshed.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nKoodoz  "

  body: "A single bowl sans appropriate for body copy is a tough find. But I agree
    with dezcom's suggestion of Proxima as a good choice, with Futura as another route.
    Though a true condensed face would be tough at full line lengths.\r\n\r\nStephen
    Coles <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/34546\">lays the single-storey a
    smack down in this Typophile thread</a>, giving plenty of options. Also, check

    It's less geometric, but could be nice."

    [[http://www.dafont.com/lane.font|Lane Narrow]]. I'm not sure the tapered tops
    and tails are complimentary.\r\n\r\nI've also had a look at Super Grotesk C which
    is the best I can find, but it's still not spot on.\r\n\r\nFutura is ok... but
    also, not a perfect candidate.\r\n\r\nMaybe I'm being too fussy :( "

  body: "Koodoz,\r\n\r\nI suggest you exercise caution when pairing headline and body
    faces that are very similar, but not identical. Typically, your headline and body
    faces should either be of the same family or contrast in a pleasing manner. This
    is why sans headlines are often paired with serif text.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I hope
    you find what you're looking for. I wouldn't worry about the 'a' style not matching
    unless you're actually trying to convince the reader they're the same type family.
    Frankly, Lane matches the structure of grotesques like <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=helvetica&btnG.x=0&btnG.y=0&site=d\">Helvetica</a>
    more than geometrics like Avant Garde. It's possible you're losing the forest
    for the trees in matching type.\r\n\r\nOne quick note: Lane is a free font. The
    others we're recommending are not. Just something to keep in mind for your budget."
