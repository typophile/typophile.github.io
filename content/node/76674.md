    The Green & Black's logo is something else, modified for the logo: perhaps TF
    Arrow (Treacyfaces)?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    'Green & Black's' typeface is...? it does look modified though.\r\n\r\n(btw sorry
    for posting in wrong section, I was in a rush)"

  body: If it is any help, Green & Black's chocolate has been around since the early
    '90s and I'm pretty sure they've always had this logo, which would rule out any
    fonts designed since then.
