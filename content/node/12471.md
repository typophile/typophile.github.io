  through word of mouth (in addition to working at firms). But I've recently moved
  to LA and I want to do my own work full-time.\r\n\r\nEasy enough, set up a website,\r\n\r\nhttp://whoisdan.com/\r\n\r\nBut
  how do you get the clients?\r\n\r\nThoughts? Opinions? Criticism?"

    I've also got a slight word of mouth going from college friends. Other than that,
    I've called and emailed a bunch of local joints.\r\n\r\nNobody here has any more

    - but how about advertising? Direct mail pieces could target specific audiences,
    and if you wanna go real low budget, the US post office has a service that allows
    you to place an image on a glossy postcard. They print and mail em for you - the
    quality isn't the greatest, but you can flood the neiborhood for faily cheap.\r\n\r\ngood
    luck to you!\r\n\r\nCheers!"

    resume to design firms, actually. That could be a good option.\r\n\r\nAlso\r\n\r\nI
    just talked with a barter company (http://ctebarter.com/). Does anybody work with
    a barter company? I barely know what one is, but it sounded like it could be a
    pretty nice option as well. But that's because the salesman didn't discuss any
    downsides..."

  body: "well, it sounds like you're looking for a low cost way to get going (much
    like I was when I was in LA). here's a few techniques: get to know local businesses,
    join an <i>active</i> chamber of commerce (eg City of Industry, Long Beach, LA),
    make contact with every agency and studio you can find, and pass out lots of business
    cards. oh yeah, and never stop making phone calls -- you never know who you're
    going to find.\r\n\r\nand a few other thoughts: I found Craig's list tends toward
    the low-ballers of the world. then again, I haven't looked in a while. CreativeHotlist
    might be a good spot for getting in touch with other agencies or corporate contract
    jobs. and AIGA LA might prove to be a strong resource (I hate designer socials,
    so I didn't try).\r\n\r\nbest of luck to you. your work is quite good, and the
    writing on your site should win over any sensible business person."

    have found that some of our best clients have come from the strangest places.\r\n\r\n2.
    I assume that you're a designer first and a businessman second. Most of the people
    you deal with will probably be business people first. This means that:\r\n\r\n100%
    of your clients will be honest, likeable individuals when you discuss their initial
    requirements.\r\n\r\n40% of your clients will need two or three reminders before
    they remember to pay up.\r\n\r\n25% of your clients will have a book keeper or
    accountant who goes on holiday for three weeks whenever you submit an invoice.\r\n\r\nOne
    or two of your clients will just refuse to pay.\r\n(If the legal system in the
    US is anything like it is here in the UK, don't waste your time chasing debts.
    Either write the debts off, or hire someone big & scary)"

  body: "\r\nDan,\r\n\r\nCongrads on going out on your own in a new city. big challenge.\r\n\r\nAll
    the advice is good - most of it can be summed up as make lots of noise and eventually
    momentum will begin to work in your favor.\r\n\r\nCan I suggest that you take
    a little more strategic approach?\r\n\r\nSit down and figure out what your position
    in your marketplace should be - based on who you are, capabilities, where you
    succeed, what kinds of clients are you successful with and what do these clients
    look for in a design firm - that is for starters.\r\n\r\nAnyway, figure out what
    you can deliver on and who is an ideal fit. That fit needs to include who is able
    to appreciate your value and is willing to pay for it. Once you have a profile
    of the ideal client start researching your market to identify actual companies
    that fit your target. Create a database of these potential clients - call them,
    ask for who buys your type of service there - get name, title and phone number.
    no need to talk to them yet, just get info at this point.\r\n\r\nOK - now that
    you have an idea of your perfect client, a list of potential perfect clients and
    some free time on your hands ... begin to work out what value these clients are
    looking for - NOT what you have to offer, but what value they want. (If this does
    not click, get some books out on value oriented marketing etc.) Figure out that
    value - it may be different for each one or all the same. You gotta figure it
    out. if it is different for each, you may have been too broad in identifying your
    target. Keep it tight for starters - you can always broaden once you have some
    success under your belt.\r\n\r\nNow, you have your value identified, create a
    message around that value - tell them how you offer the value they want. this
    is your mantra. hammer it home. Any contact you have with them should communicate
    this value - phone calls, direct mail .etc.\r\n\r\nYou have a number of references
    here on self promotion and marketing, so I will not go through a step-by-step
    on that. The key here is:\r\n\r\nIdentify your target based on fit\r\nIdentify
    the value your target wants\r\nCreate messaging around that value\r\n\r\nMarch
    out your marketing machine. Unleash your campaign - and don't just rely on a one-off
    effort. Soften them up with a post card, make a phone call, get a portfolio review,
    send off a white paper that you wrote (make sure it is value oriented!) and book
    orders, baby!!!\r\n\r\nAlso, key - I am begging you not to sell on price. You
    live by price you die by price. No need to step on their neck and take advantage
    - that is wrong and bad business. but, charge a fair rate and get paid for the
    value you offer.\r\n\r\nGasp ... one last thing, I do not agree regarding earlier
    comments about business people not wanting to pay and 25% of them screwing you
    over. That may be someone else's experience, but it is like marriage and divorce
    - rarely is it just one side's fault. I *rarely* have a client that does not pay
    - rarely. We work with great people and we do great work. We deliver and they
    pay. Everyone is happy. Out of a million in sales this year I am out about $1,200
    and that is because the company went under. Not bad odds if you ask me.\r\n\r\nOk,
    enough outta me - all the best Dan!\r\n\r\n--\r\nMike"
