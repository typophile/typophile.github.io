    a variety of cuts for text and display.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/lucida-sans/\">Lucida</a>
    started life as a print face so it can do double duty, onscreen and off.\r\n\r\n"

    the same as Lucida Sans/usable for print work?"

  body: Sorry, Tim, but I've never compared the two. The "Grande" in the name might
    suggest it was created for print display work, a la Big Caslon, but I'm just speculatin'
    at this point.

  body: "'Grande' is refering to the gigantic character set it comes with. Its basically
    covers all of unicode. Cyrillic, Turkish, CE ete. I think it ways specially hinted
    too. But still no OSF or small caps though. \r\n\r\nOut of all the interface sans
    available- Lucida is good for both print and on screen. Whereas Verdana/Tahoma
    are readable on screen but horriable in print... and in my opinion look like inspired
    by Lucida.\r\n\r\nMikey"

  body: 'Grande: I believe it''s the same also. Unfortunately no italics on the os
    screen version. Not a big fan of the printed look myself. It is a mater of taste.
    I think technically it''s good.'

    you can complement Georgia (or a similar Scotch Roman) with Weidemanns Corporate
