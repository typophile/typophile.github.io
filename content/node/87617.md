  body: 'It''s probably hand-done lettering based on Changeling. In addition to the
    A and J, the height of the middle of R is different. '

  body: It sure doesn't look like *hand*-lettering. But people can tweak fonts for
    logos, in varying degrees. I certainly have, myself.

  body: '"Hand-done" was a poor, misleading word; I just meant built from scratch
    in an illustrator program or the like. The straight lines and relatively simple
    curves of Changeling make it a likely candidate for such reconstitution. Of course
    it could be tweaked from the real font too as you say. But the changes to A (not
    just width, but height of crossbar) and R are definitely changes for the worse
    IMO, and strike me as unsubtle mistakes in copying rather than conscious tweaks
    of Mark''s typeface.'

    to differentiate between modifying an existing font and doing something from scratch
    (whether the latter is on a computer or not).\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
