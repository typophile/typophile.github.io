  body: The latest re-design at <a href="http://www.rd.com/">Reader's Digest</a> uses
    a customized version of Joshua Darden's <a href=http://www.dardenstudio.com/typefaces/freight_sans"">Freight
    Sans</a> for the logo. Makes sense that they would use other versions of Freight
    for the headlines.
