  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi all.  <BR>  <BR> I've just been commisioned to write an article about font design, and more specifically 'Making money from your fonts'.  <BR>  <BR> I was wondering if anyone out there had experience of this - either selling their fonts, or using their 'free' fonts as promotional tools that have led to other work. I will  probably  be looking to speak to a couple of people for the article, show off their work maybe, print their URL, etc. In it's own way, the article would be a nice way to promote your font design work maybe?  <BR>  <BR> Anyway, if you have time to email over the next couple of days, it would be really good to hear from you guys&hellip; Thanks! <BR>  <BR><a href="mailto:badgerbadger@badgerbadger.freeserve.co.uk"><a href="mailto:badgerbadger@badgerbadger.freeserve.co.uk">badgerbadger@badgerbadger.freeserve.co.uk</a></a> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Your topic is incredibly broad. It might be a better idea to let us know what research you've already done, what kind of audience will be reading your article and what holes you need filled to complete your article.  <BR> <BR>Most folks are here to assist each other in font design and might not see assisting a journalist as the most effective use of their time and effort.  You might do better narrowing your query down to a specific question and see if you get any responses you'll want to follow up through e-mail exchanges. <BR> <BR>Kristin <BR>who spent 10 years writing for newspapers&hellip;.before she got over it! <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Okay, some clarification. It's not for Computer Arts, but the sister magazine, Computer Arts Projects. They asked me to do this yesterday and I have until Tuesday (5 days) so it's a pretty tight deadline.  <BR> <BR>&quot;It might be a better idea to let us know what research you've already done, what kind of audience will be reading your article and what holes you need filled to complete your article.&quot; <BR> <BR>Well I have several sites I'll be quoting, looking at, discussing etc. And the article will be quite practical based, to do with promotion of work, etc. The audience is the design community basically (computer arts readers) - not necessarily just typographers though, but designers who are looking to experiment, get into font design and would maybe like some advice/reassurance that it will be worth their while.  <BR>  <BR>&quot;Most folks are here to assist each other in font design and might not see assisting a journalist as the most effective use of their time and effort.&quot; <BR> <BR>This is a great opportunity for people to promote their work, their site, etc as the mag is the biggest selling of it's kind (as far as I understand). We would of course credit you, and maybe even show some images of your work.  <BR> <BR>The main article is going to be about promoting your fonts, selling them online, selling them through your own site, etc - not about technical font design at all - more theory based. So, it would be great to hear from anyone who has tried, or who has made money from font design. So that could be directly selling fonts, or having a 'donation' button on your site, or using your font design as a promotional tool. If you have any anecdotes that are relevant, that would be great - people like to hear that kind of practical stuff based on real experiences. So if that's you, feel free to email me and then I'll send some more specific questions.  <BR> <BR>Hope that clarifies things a bit. Thanks.</div>
