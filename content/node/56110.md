  then I found out it was from DaFont.\r\n\r\nI still like it, but would you guys
  use it?\r\n\r\nWould it be bad to use it?\r\n\r\nThanks."

    use it because I have moved on\r\nand am able to buy pro-fonts. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGuerrizmo+Design\r\nNo

  body: "There are some decent pro fonts on dafonts. Look each font over and judge
    each on its own  merit. Also, look over the description. Some of the fonts are
    free for personal use only; others are available for commercial use. Some of the
    listings also have links to the designer/ foundry website which is cool. Some
    of the fonts available from dafonts are only available there. Pro versions are
    still best.\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n[[http://www.thefontry.com|<em>...from

    all free Larabie Fonts and most free Typodermic Fonts on Dafont are at least 1
    version of out date, some are 4 versions out of date.'

    think more highly of a designer who uses good free fonts than I would of a designer
    who actually pays for bad retail fonts."

    turn water into wine with free fonts.\r\nI admire people who give high quality
    fonts away it says allot\r\nabout them. I will give my first font away simply
    because I do\r\nnot rely on them for income. My income comes from graphic design,\r\nphotography,
