body: "How do all --\r\n\r\nI read recently in Mathew Carter's interview in the New
  Yorker, that once he has a character set scratched out, he does about 40 pages of
  print-outs for observation and to adjust any discrepencies he finds (whilst also
  feeling like hanging himself, apparently!?).\r\n\r\nI'm designing a headline font
  and am doing the usual kind of prints -- pangrams of uc/lc -- mixed sets -- mixed
  with numerals -- the various sizes I see it being used at -- and a cobbled mix of
  the special characters used in context. Basically I've no idea how anyone else makes
  their test pages and am just curious as to whether there could be a better way.
  And I print no-where near 40 pages, but again this is just display. I did some searches
  and couldnt find any literature on this. Would be nice to put together a master
  indesign doc I could use."

    some clues/insights.

    on his <a href="http://www.logofontandlettering.com/kernking.html" target="_blank"><em>Logo,
    Font and Lettering Bible</em> website</a>, in case you'd like to check it out.

  body: The problem with so many test documents available is that they don't have
    dummy CE text in them! How am I supposed to test all of my Pro accents?

  body: "For testing <emph>all</emph> digraphs, rather than the majority of those
    that will appear in western languages, try the <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/9339\">random
    all-digraph psuedotext</a>. But I wouldn't rely on it too heavily, because its
    letter distribution makes it look quite different from real text. Its main benefit
    is probably to find oddball kern problems such as 'qj'.\r\n\r\nMore immediately
    useful, I think, would be a text devoid of kern pairs, but still representing
    all letters and most high-frequency digraphs. That would let you focus on getting
    the side bearings right before diving in too deeply to tweaking the individual
    kern pairs - having lots of kerns to make up for poor basic fit is the classic
    mark of an amateur type release, and was certainly a problem in my first couple
    of tries in spacing my ATF Century Catalogue (see <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/10317\">IKern
    vs Adobe InDesign&#39;s optical kerning</a> and <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/10191\">bouma
    of space craft</a> for a more discussion from around that time)."
