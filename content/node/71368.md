body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nCan you suggest a Greek font that matches Charter font?  I'm
  typesetting math book, and the problems is that in formulas the sharp form of <em>v</em>
  in italic is easily mixed with Greek <em>\u03BD</em>.  \r\n\r\nThank you in advance,\r\n\r\nVadim\r\n\r\n(And
  some off-topic: many links from this site to the site of Greek Font Society should
  be changed from .org to .gr)"

    includes the Greek characters for mathematical formulas; it comes installed with
    texlive2009 (and MacTeX). \r\n\r\nEdit... but I am afraid that does not solve
    your problem; here are <em>v</em> and nu\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/vnu_6366.jpg]"

  body: "Maybe I should add that I think the problem comes from the mathematical italic
    small v (which needs not be identical to the italic small letter v of the text
    font). I doubt you could find a Greek letter nu that would cause problem with
    the following italic v (from URW Garamond) \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/vplusnusquared_3416.jpg]"

  body: "Thank you, Michel.  \r\n\r\nThe problem with Math Design fonts is exactly
    my case.  So I was looking for the Greek font with more clear difference in shape,
    like, say, Garamond Premier where the descending stroke in nu is thinner than
    ascending one.\r\n\r\nBut I like your suggestion even more, so I will look for
    the way to add alternate form of v to the Charter font instead."
