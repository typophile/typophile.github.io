  me to the punch! I've been investigating upright and sanserif scripts for a while,
  but these guys have already done it. i've tried to convince Mark Simonson to do
  a fully connecting version of <a href="http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/coquette.html">Coquette</a>,
  but don't think i sold him. Oh well, will still give it a go someday to make a full-fledged
  font similar to what the If You Could guys have already done.

    Mark couldn't pull it off, I just think it would cease to be Coquette.)\r\n\r\nI
    think the first challenge is simply doing an upright italic. I think of Veronika
    Burian's <a href=\"http://www.type-together.com/ampl_font.php?idpuente=13\">Bree</a>
    (although not technically an italic it feels like a sans-script) and Sibylle Hagman's
    <a href=\"http://www.vllg.com/Kontour/Odile/mudTyper+Weights/\">Odile</a> has
    an upright italic."

  body: I haven't forgotten about your suggestion, Paul. I don't think it's a bad
    idea, though it may need a different name, as Tiffany suggests. I may yet do it.
    I also have some other plans to enlarge the Coquette family, but I don't know
    how soon I will be able to show anything. Hopefully yet this year.

  body: "I think the example Paul linked to from \"If You Could\" is an entirely different
    thing than any of the other examples mentioned above. It is much more a grotesk
    being itself yet connected and has no caligraphic feel. Instead it has quite a
    lovely spacial relationship in figure ground--therefore it seems a whole new breed.
    I rather like it and hope Paul or whomsoever would pursue it.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: chris is right, i'd like to do something quite literally like what If You
    Cold has done with the word 'make.' of course i would want to do stylistic sets
    that added in more cursive elements in the lower case and upper. i haven't got
    past the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pauldhunt/sets/72157604469560514/">investigation
    stage</a>, and the closest things i have to sketches would be my experiments with
    <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pauldhunt/2102146814/">Not Gill Sans</a>.
    I would like to try do something similar to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pauldhunt/2346630291/in/set-72157604469560514/">Tempo's
    Swash Caps</a> just to round it out. Still, this is all just floating around in
    the ether for a few more years, most likely...

  body: I think one reason it works in this instance, in the example is because it
    is a logotype. It seems somehow style appropriate. I can't picture, really, a
    whole typeface. I guess I'm intrigued. Paul, bring it!
