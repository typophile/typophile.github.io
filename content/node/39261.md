    something like Private Limited or Incorporated?\r\n\r\nIf yes, does it need to
    be part of the logo?"

    is how swedes pronounce the english word NICE. And the caron is in there when
    we looked at the right phonetics for the english word Nice.\r\n\r\n\r\n@writingdesigning\r\n\r\nyes
    it is that Private Limited or Incorporated... it means that it introduced on the
    stockmarket. Maybe I don't need it. But the client want it there I think... need
    to talk to them ... then I get back.\r\n\r\n\r\nThnx a lot 4 comments :-)\r\n\r\n\r\n//\r\n//

  body: "A freestanding caron isn't part of any phonetic transcription system I'm
    aware of--what is it supposed to mean?  Assuming you are using the International
    Phonetic Alphabet (since the other symbols are IPA symbols), if the caron is supposed
    to represent primary stress (my guess), you should use Unicode 02C8 (modifier
    letter vertical line: [\u02C8najs]) instead.  If the caron is supposed to represent
    rising intonation (as in, \"Nice?\"), it belongs over the 'a': [n\u01CEjs].\r\n\r\nOtherwise
    I like the logo.  I like the Aktiebolag, but it could be interesting to see an
    AB version too.  And I like the colors; will the orange look very different in
    print than on screen?\r\n\r\nLycka till med logotypen!"
