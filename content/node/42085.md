  body: "Adriano, this one has me stumped. I checked Ale Paul's scripts, and Jason
    Walcott's (both at Veer), because I thought this might fit their work, but I found
    nothing that matched. This 'S' seems familiar, but I have dropped so far behind
    in the new Script font releases that I can't recall where I saw it.\r\n\r\nHave
    you seen it used anywhere else? \r\n\r\nI hope someone recognizes it, or I stumble
    across it somewhere. (It wasn't in the Script Font ID Guide places I would have
    put it, if I had collected it already.)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
