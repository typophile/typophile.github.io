    The type treatment is interesting because it\u2019s more reminiscent of something
    you might see in a TV ad than a film. Typography in film is typically an afterthought,
    which might explain frequent abuse of faces like Arial. Speaking of which, it
    was bugging me throughout my entire viewing of District 9, an otherwise wonderful
    film.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/d9_6434.png]"

    well and managed to keep it fresh throughout the film.\r\n\r\n"

    really drove me nuts what when Abrams had the production people use Neutraface
    in <em>Star Trek</em>, and the idiots did it with no kerning. Thankfully we have
    Harry Potter around to give us great type."

  body: Does anyone have an idea who was responsible for the type in Zombieland? I've
    already asked around (Zoic Studio, CIS Vancouver) but no leads so far. :^/
