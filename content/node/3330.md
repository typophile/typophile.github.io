  body: What&#39;s the text about? How long is it? Who&#39;s going to be reading it?
    <BR> <BR>Text is meant to be read, so choosing a font is a lot more than a formal
    exercise of pairing with a display face choice <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: '&#60;font class=&#34;dontLookLikeCrap&#34;&#62;&#60;font class=&#34;dontLookLikeCrap&#34;&#62;Actually
    it is just a spread with Wayne Gretzky quote: <BR> <BR>&#34;You miss 100 percent
    of the shots you don&#39;t take&#34;, <BR>where &#34;You miss 100&#34; set in
    Machine as illustration &#40;kind of ny rangers hokey jersey&#41; on a left side
    and the rest of the quote in small type on the right. So I am trying to find a
    good pair for machine. <BR> <BR>Thank you&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/font&#62;'
