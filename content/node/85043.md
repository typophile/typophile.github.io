  have been very passionate about: how culture affects design, more specifically typography.
  I would really appreciate any feedback from my fellow Typophile's. Thank you!\r\n\r\nnikkivillagomez.wordpress.com"

  body: "I strongly recommend turning the body copy black instead of grey. Other than
    that, looks good. Once the body is black, you may wish to revisit the large side
    numbers in grey as well. How hard to read grey type became a design trend I\u2019ll
    never know."

    with you, black is a much easier read than grey. Thank you so much for your advise! '

  body: "For on-screen reading, 100% contrast (black on white) is actually a bit harsh.
    I think it's OK as-is. Maybe go with an 80% black (dark gray). \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Good start. Hope to see it become a reference on design, culture and typography.
    I subscribed to follow it.\r\n\r\nBTW, dark gray over white produces a better
    anti-alias effect than black over white in text size (at least on all Windows
    versions I used). But for the titles black would produce a more robust view."

  body: Thanks Igor for your feedback! and for subscribing! I've had this concept
    in my head for almost 7 years now so having it become reality has been validating.
