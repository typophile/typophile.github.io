  body: can you post a bigger scan ... looks like it could be Franklin Gothic, but
    can&#39;t tell for sure <BR>because some of the key letters are closing up.

  body: I think you&#39;re right about Franklin Gothic BJ. The K, Q, G, R, g, C, y,
    M &amp; J are all consistent with that typeface. It could be the condensed face
    too.

  body: Unfortunately no, I can&#39;t post a bigger size scan, as I haven&#39;t got
    a scanner. :/ I had this scan made some time ago, for some other purpose, yet,
    checking the original TIFF file, it manages to be some bit bigger, and clearer,
    so I made a new GIF of it, hopefully that helps somehow? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/27804.gif"

  body: Also, I do have the original printed source of the sample pictures, which
    by the way is from 1994, so, if there&#39;s just any additional answer I can give
    to any question regarding any detail of the font that may be helpful in any way...
    <BR> <BR>And to the font, yes, I had also thought of Franklin Gothic, initially,
    as the letters do appear to match... &#40;Franklin Gothic Demi? I don&#39;t think
    it must be Franklin Gothic Condensed, as the detail of the dots on the &#34;
