  Many of those have simple and clean forms or either cartoonish and elegant swashes.
  Overall it's quite challenging to identify what font has been used in one particular
  logo.\r\n\r\nThis is one beaty which i noticed couple of days ago? Can anyone help,
  what font this might be?\r\n\r\nThanks[img:sites/default/files/old-images/alberta_font_4904.jpg]"
