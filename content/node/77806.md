body: I'm looking for some assistance in identifying or suggesting a close approximation
  of the "Peacock" lettering on the attached image. I believe it's art deco, however
  there is so much going on I'm not sure. The P is pretty intense. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/peacock_3770.jpg]

  body: "It's a style from few decades earlier than art deco, however I think the
    design is slightly more recent. The full image can be seen [[http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_l7FSCh667AA/TEXyPwZK-GI/AAAAAAAAAck/SUlVnrDmTLk/s1600/073.JPG|here]].
    The frame looks art nouveau but the lettering is a more traditional style from
    around 1900. Have a look at [[www.letterheadfonts.com|Letterhead Fonts]] for similar
    styles.\r\n"
