  body: Interesting, I was just thinking a few months ago about doing a masters in
    psychology that would be related to typography &#40;though it&#39;s not always
    obvious to find someone who can coach you in this type of project&#41;. I decided
    to get more experience and come back later if the interest was still strongly
    present. <BR> <BR>What&#39;s the s-Font list if you don&#39;t mind my asking?
    I could use some more of that stuff =&#41; <BR> <BR>Em
