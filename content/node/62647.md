  got a close enough Pantone match for imprinting the yellow on a charcoal gray stock,
  since it's a dark stock metallic inks work best. Anyone know if there's a decently
  close match? Doesn't have to be the exact shade, just a bright yellow in a similar
  hue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/clint_card_6477.jpg]"
