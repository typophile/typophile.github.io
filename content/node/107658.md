    renderrers get pretty slow as the number of the lookups in the font increases,
    so one solution might be to try to decrease the number of the lookups as possiple."

    or even things like MS Word, to rule out issues specefic to that application?

  body: "The problem might be due to cursive attachment among all letters. Higher
    the number of cursive attachment letters, slower will be the font.\r\n\r\nYou
    may test it. Just remove the cursive attachment lookups from the project and then
    test the font in the software. Though it will disturb the whole font and letter
    shaping but I am suggesting it just for testing purpose to confirm that the slowness
    is created by cursive lookups.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nZ.A"

  body: "How many rules do you have in your font?\r\n\r\nYou may try to group your
    mutually exclusive rules by prefixing the group of rules with some tag. e.g. if
    you have 5 rules\r\n\r\nrule1 \r\nrule2\r\nrule3\r\nrule4\r\nrule5\r\n\r\nand
    you know if rule1 is fired then there is no need to check the other rules. You
    may prefix these rules (name these in VOLT) like \r\n\r\ngroup1\\rule1\r\ngroup1\\rule2\r\ngroup1\\rule3\r\ngroup1\\rule4\r\ngroup1\\rule5\r\n\r\nI
    am unable to find the documentation but you may see sample font for reference.
