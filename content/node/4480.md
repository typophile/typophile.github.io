  work on paper for once. I&#39;ve been meaning to play with cursive contextual alternates
  for a little while. The good news: no kerning! The bad news: getting all the connectors
  just right. I&#39;m not sure if this works yet; I&#39;m still against handwriting
  fonts in general, but they&#39;re definitely cooler with some alternates mixed in,
  and with the connectors done right. I think to do it right I would need to mix in
  a bunch more alternates, but it&#39;s a start, and I like where it&#39;s going so
  far. The letters are pretty low res; my scsi scanner won&#39;t work with the powerbook,

    have everything, but it&#39;s a bunch. I didn&#39;t intend to go this far with
    this one. I was just working on ideas on how to work the connectors with opentype.
    At any rate, I&#39;ve manually added a little bit more resolution to most of the
    letters. It will take quite a bit more before I&#39;m happy with the digitization.
    I need to get a scanner &#40;I recently gave my old scsii beast to a thrift store&#41;.
    My 3MP CoolPix isn&#39;t cutting it here. It still doesn&#39;t seem random enough.
    I am working out some more fancy OT stuff to randomize the letters. For example,
    the ll ligature seems to repeat too often. I might mix some of the alternate l&#39;s
    in there somehow. The ff combination also seems repetitive. Maybe it&#39;s just
    becuase I&#39;ve been looking at it too long. The reality is that the font will
    probably never be used for more than one sentence anyway, now that I think about
    it. <BR> <BR>One question for the OT techies out there: at what point to OT instructions
    start to bog down the software. I would like to do some contextual stuff to make
    sure that no two letters are ever the same within three characters or so. It will
    take a lot of instructions to really get it right. I haven&#39;t noticed any slow
    down yet, but it seems like if it had to parse a couple hundred lines of code
    for every character it would really start to bog down the host software. <BR>

  body: 'Tiff: I have been trying to work out a double f solution. I&#39;m not quite
    satisfied with what I&#39;ve got. You are one step ahead of me on the non-connected
    characters. I&#39;m working on a set of leading strokes that can attach to the
    first letter in a word, as well as a set of characters sans connecter. There are
    certain characters that work well without a following connector: an occasional
    x or t--s&#39;s can be nice too. If I do get around to adding the unconnected
    series, I&#39;ll tie the left connecterless to the right connecterless with OT.
    <BR> <BR>I have been thinking about some more ink spatter and I&#39;ve settled
    on using &#34;spatter alternates.&#34; Since the current implementation of OT
    doesn&#39;t allow for inserted characters, I&#39;ll have to attach the spatters
    to different characters. What I&#39;m doing so far is placing the spatters so
    that they will end up to the far left or right of the spatter alternate &#40;or
    even show up on another line&#41;. This way, the spatters will be connected to
    random characters. The trick is planning the spatters so they look good where
    they happen to land. <BR> <BR>Of course, I&#39;m still adding more alternate caps.
    I&#39;ve got three different SC sets. I&#39;m starting to resign myself to the
    fact that I can&#39;t get the randomness perfect with OT. The typographer will
    have to add a few alternates here and there to polish it off, but at least they&#39;ll
    have plenty to choose from. &#40;See the small caps in the last sample: I&#39;ve
    added alternates by hand.&#41;'

    The l jumped out straight away. <BR> <BR>Be careful of making your outlines too
    detailed. I don&#39;t think they are bad now. Maybe a little smoother so it&#39;s
    not quite so toothy when it&#39;s 400pt. But I wouldn&#39;t give the outlines
    any more nodes. <BR> <BR>A set of fancy signoffs could be fun, Sincerely, With

  body: 'It&#39;s not true randomness. The OT code looks something like this: <BR>
    <BR>@random_set_1 = [a d g j l m n o c]; <BR>@random_set_2 = [k e i n p q t v
    z]; <BR>@letter = [a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]; <BR>@letter_alt

    <BR>  sub @random_set_2 @letter @letter&#39; by @letter_alt2; <BR>} calt; <BR>
    <BR>If you put in enough of these ugly hacks it starts to appear random. You would
    also want to make sure that no two letters were ever the same right next to each
    other. There are only so many of those that happen regularly in English, so I
    have added specific substitution rules for each of those cases &#40;ee ff gg ll
    mm nn oo, etc.&#41; Also notice that I have placed an @letter between the @random
    character. This makes the pattern even more difficult to spot. You might notice
    the funky h after every t, but you wouldn&#39;t notice the funky h after t-anycharacter,
    &#40;unless you were freaking crazy&#41;. <BR> <BR>In the case of this font, the
    fact that there are a different set of characters to connect to the o b v w also
    helps the font appear more random. The randomness feature above needs to be adjusted
    to get the connectors right for this one, which makes it more complicated. To
    be honest, I haven&#39;t completely figured it out.'

    and watch a brand new high-quality type library unfold inside less than five years.
    You are truly talented. Your designs just keep getting better and better. <BR>
    <BR>I worked with Erik van Blokland &#40;Letterror&#41; a few years ago on something
    similar for the OT implementation of his Kosmik design. Every glyph &#40;including
    accents and punctuation!&#41; had three variants. We overloaded the Contextual
    Alternates feature to simulate ideal flipping behavior as best we could. But as
    you widen the &#34;search radius&#34; the feature code grows geometrically in
    size. We learned yet another way to crash InDesign. <BR> <BR>I am hoping that
    the good folks at Adobe and MS will do the necessary programming to add true flipping
    capability to their layout engines and support the RAND feature, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/features_pt.htm#rand">described
    here</a> in the OT spec. Then Contextual Alternates can be freed up to do its
    real job in fonts &#40;like yours&#41; where you do have truly contextual alternates
    like your loopy d. &#40;&#34;pendant&#34;&#41; <BR> <BR>It would not hurt for
    a font developer like yourself to drop a line to the Powers That Be at Adobe and
    second these requests to the InDesign/CoolType programming teams. Especially with
    one of these PDF samples of your font in action.
