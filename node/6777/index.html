		<div class="commentbody">It's sad that such a beautiful typeface has become so overused. But just as some people say &quot;cliches are cliches because they're true&quot; (which may itself be a cliche!) so perhaps Trajan is used simply because it's so pretty. Oh, and for the sake of completeness and because it may help, and here's a couple of threads that deals with Schneidler.

		<div class="commentbody"><b>Face it, it's a cliche.</b> <BR> <BR>You're right.  And this is not just  a cliche, but also sad. <BR> <BR>Title design, poster etc - is done by you. Graphic deigners. Design  firms, freelance designers etc. <BR> <BR>e.g: <BR> <BR>* The title &quot;Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights&quot; - by Jill Bell (great artwork, and I'm sure you know her). <BR> <BR>* Tim Girvin (Strategic Branding &amp; Design) designed more than 400 titles - The Lord of The Ring, The Matrix, Apocalypse Now, Sleepy Hollow, Tombstone, Unforgiven&hellip;. <BR>And he's really a Great designer. <BR> <BR>* Mike Salisbury Communications - I'm sure you know about his work. Hey, your friend, Leslie Cabarga, wrote a great book - &quot;Logo, font &amp; Lettering Bible&quot;  (see page 50) <BR> <BR> <BR>Maybe there's a need to do more and more work in-house; and just to work with  few designers, lettering artists, etc.  <BR> <BR>So thank you for this thread.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; Maybe there's a need to do more and more work in-house; and just to work with few designers, lettering artists, etc <BR> <BR>Blame the designer??? I wouldn't exactly call Hollywood a hotbed of innovation. They keep cranking out the same movies with the same posters because they're afraid to try something different. <BR> <BR>I just read that Jude Law is going to be in 6 movies between now and the end of the year. Now he is as beautiful a guy as Trajan is a font, but I am gonna be mighty sick of his face  too in 3 months. <BR> <BR>I've used Trajan plenty too. When you present it to a client along with a bunch of other ideas, they just love it. It is a beautiful font. But you have to know when you use it that every graphic designer is gonna look at it and go &quot;oh, Trajan. How original.&quot; <BR> <BR>And we still have not ID'd the font in the sample (which is not Trajan or Schneidler/Shango)</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hey, Typophilics &ndash; this is an old thread, <a href="http://www.typophile.com/node/6777">http://www.typophile.com/node/6777</a>, but it&rsquo;s funny because I just found it. I was looking for something else, and this came up. To the nature of the font, it&rsquo;s not Trajan &ndash; it&rsquo;s a customized Girvin titling font; surely, it&rsquo;s based on 1st century epigraphy, but not on Twombly&rsquo;s Trajan. Trust me, I&rsquo;ve had so many of my logotype renderings converted into Trajan solutions by agencies, it&rsquo;s a joke.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working as a designer for motion picture marketing since 1978-79, and Apocalypse Now, Francis Coppola. And what happens is that you create solutions that are endlessly juried and judged by either the directors, the studio leadership, the talent, whomever is involved in the proposition &ndash; and toned down. The art fullness, diminished. So, doing a rendering of the Last Samurai, or Lord of the Rings, Gladiator &ndash; The Ghost and the Darkness &ndash; or Lemony Snicket&rsquo;s A Series of Unfortunate Events, each of these treatments is entirely customized &ndash; tuned and built by hand. And if there&rsquo;s an agency conversion, the customized solutions move to easily built imitation solutions by the agencies, and&hellip;the work is gone.</p>
<p>More here on that: <a href="http://www.girvin.com/portfolio/identity/matrix/matrix.php">http://www.girvin.com/portfolio/identity/matrix/matrix.php</a>, or here: <a href="http://www.girvin.com/portfolio/identity/beowulf/beowulf.php">http://www.girvin.com/portfolio/identity/beowulf/beowulf.php</a>. Or this notation on process: <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/stories/2006/05/08/story8.html">http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/stories/2006/05/08/story8.html</a>. I&rsquo;m not touting, I&rsquo;m talking. <a href="http://blog.girvin.com/?p=997">http://blog.girvin.com/?p=997</a>, or: <a href="http://blog.girvin.com/?p=712">http://blog.girvin.com/?p=712</a></p>
<p>Nuff said, as they say in the comics.</p>
<p>I started working on Lemony Snicket as a production designer for Count Olaf&rsquo;s eyes &ndash; which then became part of the logo, then from there, building out the fonts and related work to create the master &ndash; for a committee and client team of 15.</p>
<p>Rough, but done.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks Tim for bringing this post back to life.  I remember reading a list in a &ldquo;Print&rdquo; column years ago, written by a design God of the moment. It was about things that were great and things that sucked in design.  Top of his list for the sucky was &ldquo;any movie poster.&rdquo; That was at least 10 years ago and those unfortunate words come to mind every time I see one.  And while it&rsquo;s not always true (think Juno and Little Miss Sunshine for refreshing departures) I&rsquo;ve tended to agree with him most of the time.</p>
<p>I had to double check to make sure it was actually you posting, for as I was reading the earlier entries I knew that they were talking about some of your work. What the &ldquo;movie voiceover guy&rdquo; (as he is actually known) is to trailers, you&rsquo;ve been to movie logos. And just as others try to imitate him, you&rsquo;ve created a look that the industry feels the need to bastardize and perpetuate.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t aware of the scope of your film work and the quite successful niche you&rsquo;ve created until a few years back when I came across your name and remembered you for all the fantastic hand drawn logos and type treatments that were all over the design and type annuals back in the day. That was a rare gift of beauty and wit you showed us.  Would love to see more of that again.  Throw away that computer.</p>
<p>cheers

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Patrick, sweet, your comments &ndash; thanks for your generosity of spirit. I claim nothing, really. Simply that the idea of creating a logo for a film is like creating an identity for something else &ndash; except that, perhaps, it gets a little more out there. The exposures are bigger, and perhaps even in some instances, international.</p>
<p>But the real telling is in the telling itself. Any motion picture identity treatment is about telling the story in a kind of compressed concretion of space. The motion picture logo can be, literally, the first thing that comes into play. It&rsquo;s the teaser for what&rsquo;s to come. Then, finally, months, if not nearly a year later, the film logo is the last thing out, that tiny little space ad that you see. Last week!</p>
<p>Iron man, I&rsquo;d attest, will be in play much longer.</p>
<p>More on that, later &ndash; except for now, there&rsquo;s this: <a href="http://blog.girvin.com/?p=768">http://blog.girvin.com/?p=768</a></p>
<p>Thanks, Patrick &ndash; more soon.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>thanks, Tiffany,</p>
<p>coming from you, too (two), it&rsquo;s nice to be here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d been on the typophile link, years, nay decades ago, before is was even online, I&rsquo;m sure. And then somehow in the biziness of things, I drifted away to other things.</p>
<p>glad to be back into the heart of it.</p>
