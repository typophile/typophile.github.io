  body: "I was just about to upload another (bigger/sharper) image for the subtitle
    but you are right \u2014 it seems like Orator is the used font.\r\nAs for the
    headline you were pretty much on point, too. It is indeed Bickham Script Regular
    and The Sans Bold Caps for the second part.\r\nThank you so much for your fast
    and kind help.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nMilan"
