    them in a back-up folder and didn't erase them for good nothing bad can happen
    - you can always reinstall any that you might need in the future. If you didn't
    make a back up it's kind of like throwing your car-keys in the ocean because of
    gas prices. Sure you can get the use of the car back, it will just be more painful.

    setting browser defaults to ignore web page specificed fonts. \r\n\r\nCheers,
    Si \r\n"

    laugh, or have you tried it? What was your experience like? Fonts like Tahoma
    and Microsoft Sans Serif are required for many applications UI, removing them
    is a bit silly. \r\n\r\nCheers, Si"
