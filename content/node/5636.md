    chunk of archives &#40;September 23th &#39;03 - June 1st &#39;04  <BR>that inexplicably
    turned inaccessible a few weeks ago... <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif"

  body: There&#39;s another post in the Build folder. My question for Jean-Claude
    is, official for what? S.W.A.T. the movie? Some particular police department?
    Can you post a sample?

    target="_blank">answer</a> from the archives. It&#39;s deals with the movie titles.

  body: James, how did you access the buried archives? The whole stat  <BR>building
    process for the Type ID Leader Board grinded to a halt  <BR>when those archives
    went AWOL, and I&#39;d sure like to be able to  <BR>access them again.
