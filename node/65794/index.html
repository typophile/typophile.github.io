		<div class="commentbody">It might make sense to say something more informative than "I like the way the screen looks".

Saying that "this new design let users find what they wanted 10% faster" is certainly useful, and if the point is to make the screens work better, while leaving the aesthetics to one designer recognized as competent - because aesthetics are subjective, there's no point debating <em>those</em> in committee - this approach may not be all that bad.

But it's an approach to keep things tightly focused for an organization that is busy and has chiefly utilitarian goals. This would not be the way to effectively decide on a new look for Avatar II - because here the meeting would be one of creative designers... not of computer programmers providing amateur creative input.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'm all for collecting data whenever possible and using it to inform design wherever possible. But statements such as "The experimentation on the site shows that his design performed 10% better" sound like hog-wash. No doubt it's taken out of context, but as it stands in the article, it begs the question "10% better than what on what metric!?". 

In this particular situation (without the proper context of course), a statement like "I like the way the screen looks" is actually more informative. At least I know that someone likes what's there. I suppose I'm just disgruntled with the amount of jargon and meaningless word salad I hear on a daily basis.

It's much like people saying something is "value added" without explaining where the value has been added. As though uttering the phrase actually adds value in some mysterious way. Similarly, the uttering of a vague statistic doesn't imbue that statistic with meaning or utility.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I suppose it depends on the kind of meeting as well—is it internal within a design department, or is it an external presentation to a group who's natural habitat is money, metrics and quantifiability? 

Sounds a bit like a naive desire from unsteady leadership to impose a mathematical level of order and clarity on a discipline that requires a strong coherent aesthetic vision, even in the most user-driven testing environments. 

Of course, I've never really thought of Google as a thought-leader or haven of design excellence or process-driven innovator when it comes to design—at least not at the level of groups like Tim Brown's IDEO. 

In generating excellent, ambitious ideas, Google is a fish in water—but at the level of design execution (or even really user-interface development) I've always thought of google as still having a bit of a vestigial "engineer's aesthetic."</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Art and science are not in conflict. They are complimentary.

Websites like Google and Amazon are in unique position to quickly measure their own success. Google wants people to select the website that will likely have what the user is looking for and Amazon wants people to buy things. Both can try different designs for very short periods of time to see if people click on a link at a higher rate or buy more things respectively.

In order to try different designs, someone had to design the new design. Design didn’t go away. The experimentation on the site measures whether the new design has a higher click rate or buy rate than the previous design. And the story doesn’t end there, because new design ideas are still needed to keep improving the click rate and buy rate.

		<div class="commentbody">I don't see ‘science’ as involved in this situation at all. It is a matter of art and utility, which may be either complimentary or in conflict in any given situation. Art and utility are often complimentary because humans value art -- by which I mean the extra-utile component of things -- and respond positively to it, enhancing the utility of a thing by making more people want to engage with it. Art and utility will be in conflict, however, if a design that people find more attractive aesthetically actually functions less well than another, less attractive design.

There is also the matter of branding to consider, because while a company may generally favour utility over art when they are in conflict, this may be moderated if the better functioning design is inconsistent with or undermines an established visual identity in which the company has invested.</div>

this is exactly what you should be concerned with. Sure there shouldn't be a debate over it (probably diversionary tactics by colleague to change something else), but consideration over such matters means that you care about what you are doing.
