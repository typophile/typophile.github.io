  used MS Comic Sans for the photo descriptions.\r\nI don't want to design the new
  panels much different from the existing ones, but I refuse to use MS comic Sans.\r\nIs
  there any similar font, very close to Comic Sans but a little bit more formal?\r\nA
  font that the client may not notice the difference at a glance.\r\n\r\nI found Chalkboard
  to be very close to Comic Sans, but it is still to informal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank
  you.\r\n\r\n\r\njrsilva"

    sure you can have both. Either it's going to be close to Comic Sans OR it will
    be a bit more formal.\r\n\r\nFor something that's handwritten, I like Mark Simonson's
    Felt Tip family:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/felttiproman.html\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Uau!!\r\n\r\nI was away for a few days and now I'm back I see so many tips.\r\nThank's
    to all.\r\n\r\nI may not explain myself clear.\r\nI'm not looking for an informal
    font, or for a kiddie look.\r\nI'm trying to silently change the panel exhibits
    from Comic Sans to a more serious font.\r\nThe earlier designer before me used
    Comic Sans and the client accepted.\r\nBut now that I'm designing new panels and
    material for the exhibit I would like to evolute to a bit more serious font.\r\nIf
    I radically change the font the font, the client may not like.\r\n\r\nFrom all
    your suggestion, FF Duper OT Bold may be the one that is more close to what I
    look for (if there exists...).\r\nFor now I decided to use Chalkboard, that is
    very close to Comic Sans, but the ascenders and stems are not so curvy."
