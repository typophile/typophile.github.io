    thinking, has now failed to post a question within the required 12 hour period.
    So I hereby invoke rule No.15 and pose the new question myself. <BR> <BR>NEW QUESTION:
    <BR> <BR>The Psalter was one of the most frequently printed books in the early
    centuries of printing, with numerous editions being published in Hebrew, Greek
    and Latin. In what script and in what language was the first non-Hebrew/Greek/Latin
    edition printed, and in what year?'

  body: The Genoa Psalter was printed in 1516 by Pier Paolo Porro. It was a polyglot
    edition and covered &#40;as well as Hebrew, Latin, Greek&#41; Arabic and Aramaic
    &#40;or Syriac&#41;. <BR> <BR>There&#39;s also an Ethiopic version from the fifteenth
    century, but I guess that doesn&#39;t count since it&#39;s not printed.

  body: '&#40;ALMOST&#41; A WINNER: <BR> <BR>Nathan has half of it. The first non-Hebrew/Greek/Latin
    Psalter was indeed the <i>Psalterium David et Cantica aliqua</i>, printed by Marcellus
    Silber from Regensburg for Johannes Potken in 1513. <BR> <BR>I also asked in what
    <i>language</i> the edition was printed: the script is generally known as Ethiopic,
    but this term is not really accurate for the language. I hereby declare Nathan
    the winner for his correct identification of the edition and script, but he&#39;s
    not allowed to post a question until someone &#40;anyone&#41; correctly identifies
    the language &#40;I&#39;ll accept any of three possible spellings&#41;. <BR> <BR>Here,

  body: Ge&#39;ez is correct. Note that the &#39; is properly a reversed &#40;mirrored&#41;
    apostrophe or left half ring signifying a voiced pharyngeal fricative. <BR> <BR>Ge&#39;ez
    is the ancient language in which the scriptures of the Ethiopic Orthodox Church
    are written. Amharic is the majority language spoken in modern Ethiopia, it is
    descended from Ge&#39;ez but quite different from it. <BR> <BR>Take it away Nathan...

    post it &#40;provided the provisions of Rule 4 don&#39;t knock me out&#41; before
    I leave school tonight, but I don&#39;t have an internet connection at home. So
    I&#39;ll be back online tomorrow morning before I teach. Sorry if this poses an
    undue wait for a ruling...

  body: Don&#39;t go citing rules at the quizmaster, Hrant. Rule 4 clearly states
    that the winner must wait one hour, during which time the answer may be challenged,
    from the time that he or she is <i>declared</i> the winner. I declared Nathan
    the winner at 1:08 pm. The additional requirement that someone had to provide
    the correct term for the language of the Ge&#39;ez Psalter was a post-declaro
    application of Johannine privilege. So there!
