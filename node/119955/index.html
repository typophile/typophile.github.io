  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Having a baby is a joyous occasion, and if you know someone who is having a child you may want to get them something special for their child. One of the best ways to do this is by purchasing <a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/content/1hzc99/likes?_notoolbar&_nospa=true">bridesmaid gifts</a> for them. After all, these gifts are meant to last a lifetime, and they&rsquo;ll be something the new mother will cherish. Below are just a few of the wooden gifts you may want to think about for the new baby on the way.<p><p></p>
<p>Engraved Letters - Engraved letters are something that can commemorate the baby&rsquo;s name through a simple wall hanging or a piece to sit on their dresser. This is a simple gift, but it will look great no matter how the nursery is decorated.<p><p></p>
<p>Height Chart - Children grow fast - faster than you want them to. However, many mothers love to chart their growth so they, and their child, can see how fast they&rsquo;re growing. A personalized height chart is something that they can mark their height on every year, and it can be taken with them if they move to a new home.<p><p></p>
<p>Toy Chest - For something extra special, you may want to consider a personalized toy chest. You can add the child&rsquo;s name onto the chest and they can keep it in their room to help organize their favorite toys. This is one gift parents and loved ones have been giving the children in their family for years, and it&rsquo;s sure to be a special gift the new mother is going to love.<p><p></p>
<p>Children&rsquo;s Swing - These swings can be hung outside, and engraved with the child&rsquo;s name. Every child loves being able to swing, so this is a gift they&rsquo;ll be sure to use over and over again.<p><p></p>
<p>Personalized Coat Hanger - Keeping the winter coats up and out of the way is important, and the child will love hanging their coat up if they have a wooden peg with their name or initial on it where they can hang their own coat.<p><p></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for personalised wooden gifts, you&rsquo;ll find that there&rsquo;s many different options available. You&rsquo;ll be able to choose from personalised wooden baby gifts, Christening gifts, or an array of other gifts the new mother or her baby are sure to adore. When it comes to these kinds of gifts, the timeless style will ensure they&rsquo;re a gift anyone will love. To find a wooden gift for the special soon-to-be mother in your life, you may want to take a look at stores like Make Me Something Special so you can have the gift personalized and make it that much more special and unique.<p><p></p>
