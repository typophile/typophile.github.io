body: "from Michael Adkins...\r\n\r\nJust wondering if I could get some feedback on
  this new font. First: this font isn't trying to take itself too serious. It is a
  condensed tribute to the classic 1940s Captain America covers. Second: It fits in
  fine when bold, fill-up-the-space lettering is called for, and it works great for
  signage when you're trying to cram everything into a tight space (DOT numbers and
  GVW's come to mind.) In all other venues, its usability remains to be seen. \r\n\r\nReally,
  it's a work of passion, so the question of overall functionality also remains to
  be seen. Still, people are downloading the freebie at a hot pace, so there may be
  life for it beyond the funny books and sign shops. Thoughts?\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fontry_american_cap_520_3928.png]\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n[[http://www.fontspace.com/the-fontry/american-captain#

  body: Oh, it is in the zip file, allright, but EULAs that cannot be perused until
    after unwrapping or downloading might be declared completely null and void by
    courts of law. In fact, I think it did happen in the UK a bunch of years back.
