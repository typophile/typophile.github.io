  body: Tough one! According to the Flash file the font used is &#34;Distinctive Tanqueray&#34;,
    so I&#39;m guessing this is custom.. Couldn&#39;t find anything else about it.
    Tanqueray is a <a href="http://www.diageo.com">Diageo</a> Brand, so they probably
    do all their stuff inhouse. Sorry. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif"
