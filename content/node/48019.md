  body: No font was used, it was custom made like most signs of that era, but you
    can find a few "<a href="http://www.typophile.com/node/12892">wild west" fonts</a>
    of a similar style. <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/urw/old_towne_no_536_ot_std/?sample_text=FRONTIER&sample_size=96">Old
    Towne</a> may be the closest.
