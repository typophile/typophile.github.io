  For instance, the EOT character (ASCII 4) would would be inserted as a symbol when
  I type cntrl + D.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nI have drawn the glyph in FontLab studio, but
  when I generate the font, the EOT character is not present.\r\n\r\nCould some kind
  soul explain how I can achieve this, or point me to a decent resource that I might
  try to understand the problem?\r\n\r\nThank you"
