body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nIn FontLab Studio 5.0.4, in the metrics window, has anyone yet
  discovered a way to kern without seeing the kerning line between glyphs? Reason
  I ask is that I find the line visually interferes with my perception of the kerning
  pair, and it's tedious to constantly deselect the pair (for perception) then re-select
  in order to move to the next glyph pair.\r\n\r\nThanks, Wayne Thompson"

    line.\r\n\r\nI usually have ten characters in the Kerning Window at one time\u2014e.g.,
    AABACADAEA\u2014so I can type and tab in rapid succession through nine pairs.
    Sometimes, my original guesstimates are off, but it only takes going through a
    few of these strings to get the hang of guessing more or less correctly.\r\n\r\nIf
    I get it wrong, I just continue through the text string to the end, and tab back
    to the trouble spot to tweak. Hence, no lines and a brisker pace."

  body: "Hey thanks, that's really helpful. \r\n\r\nBtw, what's your approach to viewing
    size while kerning? e.g. In Fontlab's Metrics window, I tend to view the type
    big (128pt) so I can accurately judge spaces, but I sometimes wonder whether it's
    better to kern at sizes closer to reading size since that is the intended end-use
    of this typeface..."

  body: ATF, you can't kern at small sizes in the metrics window, because the coarse
    pixel grid of the screen won't display many kern values and will round others
    in misleading ways. The larger the type, the closer to native resolution (UPM),
    the fewer rounding problems and the less distortion. If you want to see the kerning
    at smaller sizes, back away from your screen.

    is a re\uFB01nement <strong>relative</strong> to the spacing, irrespective whether
    the typeface is meant for larger or smaller point sizes. This automatically implies
    that kerning can be de\uFB01ned at the highest (read: most convenient) resolution.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nFEB"

  body: "Eliason, thanks for your suggestion but all it does is turn on/off the small
    blue horizontal lines beneath each pair. Not to worry, Nick's suggestion to kern
    in strings is proving most useful. Thanks too, John and Frank... I was worried
    that my habit of checking text strings at large sizes might be skewing my perception
    of the spacing that is required at reading sizes... but you have put my mind at
    ease\r\n\r\nWayne"
