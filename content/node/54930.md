  really poor results. For example, doing a search with\r\n<code>site:typophile.com
  flash player text engine</code>\r\nonly returns *one* result -- this one http://typophile.com/node/29359?page=8
  -- which is actually quite inaccurate. I was obviously expecting more results, and
  at least this page (http://typophile.com/node/45368) on the list.\r\n\r\nIs anyone
  been having a similar experience? Is this a Google glitch or a Typophile issue?"

    Google does try to index Flash, to some extent) Hint: try navigating Typophile
    without having Flash Player installed (or using Flash Block).'

  body: Typophile is built on Drupal. I think the only Flash content is the homepage,
    the header, and the sidebar. So Google shouldn't have any problems indexing the
    pages. In any case, I've used this search pattern many times in the past and it
    worked well then.

    I was trying to find printer recommendations in the archives today, and what Google
    finds is\u2026 dire. Also, the Google Cache links are unreliable at best, and
    it seems to find outdated forum listings rather than actual threads.\r\nSo what's
    up with Typophile's own search engine \u2013 did it work better in the past?"

    but as far as I can tell, there's no HTML link on the home page to the forums,
    which could be a hindrance to google getting in with any regularity.\r\n\r\nIt
    might also help to make the thread titles H1 tags instead of H2."

    to the forum, which have 60 links, and hundreds on the general discussions page.
    I guess if the spider doesnt come often enough it will miss some pages with hundreds
    of links to chose from and only one flash link pointing in.\r\n\r\nJust speculation..."

    for quite a while now, Typophile users have been using Google to search for Typophile
    threads, since it was working better than Typophile's search engine. Grant Hutchinson

    favelet or without) used to work like charm and brought up all relevant entries,
    no matter if they were added only half an hour ago or dating back to 2003.\r\n\r\nRecently,
    all I usually get is links to paged listings, like some user\u2019s tracking pages.\r\nAlso,
    hits are listed with nothing but their non-speaking url, i.e. without title or
    description.\r\nIn my opinion, feed entries (urls containing \u2018crss\u2019)
    shouldn\u2019t be indexed. I want the real thing, not the feed of it.\r\n\r\nJust
    2 examples for queries that have delivered a couple of dozens hits before, and
    now hardly a single useful one. At least one of them actually has a Wiki entry
    (which can\u2019t be found):\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=site:typophile.com%20unica\">Unica</a>
    [<a href=\"http://florian.hardwig.com/public/typophile/google-unica.png\">my results</a>]\r\n\r\n<a
    href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=site:typophile.com%20featured%20face\">Featured
    Face</a> [<a href=\"http://florian.hardwig.com/public/typophile/google-ff.png\">my
    results</a>]\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it seems Typophile has no proper 404 page, at
    least not for URLs of this scheme: <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/nonsense\">http://www.typophile.com/node/<em>nonsense</em></a>.
    That link would take me to a wild potpourri of random posts and blog entries.\r\n"

  body: "It is surprising that advertising people do not know nor care that the simpler
    the html stuff of a website, the more hits will result.\r\n\r\nI looked at the
    html internals of this \"Is anyone else getting poor results...\" thread, and
    it became clear for me why the Google results are so poor. For instance, this
    tiny thread alone has 30 picture links, a big css file, several php files, several
    js files and other stuff. Google's crawler would need too many seconds to evaluate
    this tiny thread, considering that Google tries to evaluate all websites of the
    entire world. The consequence is that Google simply skips many websites.\r\n\r\nThe
    simpler the html stuff, the better for the Google crawler. For instance, my website
    has the simplest html imaginable (no css, no php, no js, etc.). The web design
    looks drab drab drab, but the hits are huge huge huge.\r\n\r\nTaking into consideration
    that my website deals with the rarest topics imaginable (e.g. the ancient Sanskrit
    language, which is studied by only very few people worldwide), the download hits
    for these very specialized files at my website are enormeous. In February, so
    far, for instance the pdf file cdrfonts.pdf was downloaded 1056 times, the txt
    file unicode.txt was download 817 times, and the \"Sanskrit 2003\" font sans2003.zip
    was downloaded 813 times. All this only at the www.sanskritweb.NET site (I also
    run  www.sanskritweb.DE and www.sanskritweb.ORG as mirrow sites with separate
    download statistics).\r\n\r\nSo, if you want to have many hits at the Typophile
    site brought about by Google search, then simplify the html stuff as much as possible
    so that it is easy for Google to evaluate your site."

    true... in this case I don't think so. Because it used to work without any problems
    whatsoever. But all of a sudden it doesn't anymore. So the problem must lie elsewhere.
    There might be more than one reason, but the way this site is coded hasn't changed
    much lately, so I doubt that plays a role."
