  hope one of you lovely people might be able to help me with.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering
  if there is a term for when the first word, or multiple words, in typeset paragraph
  are set in a different font. I'm thinking like a drop cap, but rather than just
  the first letter, the whole word.\r\n\r\nAny help gratefully received.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nDan\r\n"

  body: It's called a <em>run-in</em> which uses small caps.

  body: Perhaps others could correct me on this but a <em>run-in</em> is a group or
    entire first-line of words of a paragraph that are set in small caps. Whether
    that term becomes void by using a different face, well, I wouldn't think so (as
    long as you're using small caps). Then again, I'm not sure why you would want
    to do that.

  body: "I don't know of a single term(s) to specify this. You need to spell it out,
    as in\r\n\r\n\"First line sets in 14-point full caps.\"\r\n\r\nOr whatever the
    specific details. \r\n\r\nIn books before the 19th century, you sometimes saw
    chapter openings where the first line would be set in, say, 16 point, the next
    in 15 point, then next in 14 point, etc.,\r\n\r\nShowing off how many fonts one
    had, I suppose. Embellishment always depends on what you have to hand, and the
    climate. If it's hot outside & minimal clothing is in order, you paint your face.
    If you need a lot of clothing to stay warm, embroidery works just fine."

  body: "SIDE HEAD is a term I\u2019ve seen used for this, and used myself.\r\n\r\nThese
    days, small caps isn\u2019t a different font, so perhaps one should say <em>a
    different style</em>, because that\u2019s how the effect is generally handled,
    not with a different font\u2014although I am quite partial to Bold U&lc side heads."

  body: "Nick, I wouldn't term this a side head -- unless it is self-contained. A
    lot of time, C-level heads are run in, text to follow after a space, often am
    em-space.\r\n\r\nI sometimes use a first-few-words in a *something* setting following
    a spacebreak. It is always awkward when a spacebreak falls at the foot or head
    of a page, and if it is just a blank line with no ornament, you need to signal
    it somehow.\r\n\r\nWhen this is done, or with the \"lead-in\" example above, the
    text designer has to mark the words to be so set. And then sometimes argue it
    out with an editor, who may have different ideas... If it is an entire first line,
    as can be used with a chapter opening, you can leave it to the typesetter.\r\n\r\nBut
    I still don't know of a technical term that covers all instances of the technique."

    several lines deep, like a drop cap? (That's what I thought the OP meant.) This
    is something that InDesign makes far easier than it should be, considering how
    rarely it's a good design idea.\r\n\r\nIs there a traditional name for that?"

  body: "I sometimes use a bold sans serif font on the lead-in to a paragraph of regular
    serifed text. Usually the lead-in is a single phrase, like \u201CI sometime use\u201D.
    Sometimes I use a larger size than the normal text size if the phrase merits it
    and if the typographical context is such that the reader can benefit from a strong
    cue to where the actual text begins. The bold visual cue captures the eye and
    draws it in. The dutch word for these kind of cueing device is <em>blikvanger</em>.
    \r\n\r\nSmall caps are also good, especially after an initial drop-cap. \r\n\r\nI
    try to break the lead-ins off according to sense, so if the first sentence started
    \u201CUsually the lead-in is a single phrase,\u201D I wouldn\u2019t end the lead-in
    after the word \u201Cthe,\u201D but after \u201Clead-in,\u201D or after \u201CUsually.\u201D"

    H. Slater\u2014is dogmatically insistent on so many things, I felt sure he would
    have the last word on this.\r\n\r\nIn his chapter on Bookwork he deals at length
    with almost every imaginable circumstance and even, \"so that every statement
    made hereafter should be based on something tangible\", details that his remarks
    refer specifically to a \". . . demy 8vo volume with a measure of 22 picas wide
    by 40 picas deep set in 10pt old style solid.\" Mr Slater is insistent that chapter
    numbers, for example, should be in \"caps of text or one size larger roman numerals\"
    and that this \". . . rarely changes, except in a schoolbook for young children
    when a display letter might be used. . . always capital and same body as text.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough
    he uses the <em>faded pink flamingo</em> in his own book he completely fails to
    inform the compositor as to the rights and wrongs of its use or even to name it.\r\n\r\nMr
    Slater sir, you disappoint me."
