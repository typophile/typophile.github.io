  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>The fastidiously authentic Garamond Premier departs from its model in one noticeable respect. For while the details, shapes, and proportions of individual letters are extremely faithful to the originals, their proportions relative to one another are not&ndash;especially with regards to x-height.</p>
<p>For instance, in Garamond&rsquo;s type the top of the bowl of the &ldquo;d&rdquo; is much lower than the top of the &ldquo;u&rdquo; or &ldquo;g&rdquo;. The same feature is apparent in other old styles, such as Jenson&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Revivals of the early 20th century repeated this trait, e.g. ATF&rsquo;s, and some played it up&ndash;Goudy&rsquo;s Garamont, of course. Robert Slimbach&rsquo;s revival, while containing a similar degree of micro-detail and variability of detail (compared with, say, ITC Garamond) is much more uniform in x-height.</p>
<p>This feature of metal-era old style type design may relate to the imprecision of letterpress printing. For even in the best examples, there is an element of &ldquo;bounce&rdquo;, in which the letters are not precisely aligned vertically. By varying the vertical dimensions of different x-height characters, bounce is camouflaged; at least, that&rsquo;s my theory.</p>
<p>By the same token, digital type, with its great precision of placement, coupled with the constraint of vertical alignment zones required by hinting procedures, favours a uniformity of x-height.</p>
<p>The situation raises a number of questions:</p>
<ol><li>To what extent is the varying x-height of the original old style types an integral part of the design?</li>
<li>Does it have any reading benefits?</li>
<li>Was it done for the reading benefits, to camouflage bounce, for some other reason, or a combination of reasons?</li>
<li>When a revival emulates certain qualities of a previous technology -- as almost all do, where does the redesigner draw the line?</li>
<li>Would there be any merit in taking things a step further and using Contextual Alternates to simulate a degree of bounce, and at the same time incorporate significant irregularity of characters' vertical dimensions?</ol></div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Wow. Nick, it is thrilling that you have brought this up, as it has been very much on my mind the past few months concerning something having to do with linotype (metal) composition, but closely related to what you describe above. Within the past few weeks I have spoken about this both with Miss Tiffany and with Matthew Carter. Interestingly enough, in his reply Matthew <em>also</em> suggested using Contextual Alternates. I was referring to this as &ldquo;baseline jump&rdquo; rather than bounce, but I think the effect for the reader is very much the same as what you are saying about the type from the Old Gang. Here&rsquo;s an extract of what I sent to Matthew:</p>
<p>&ldquo;[While doing research for the Dwiggins biography I&rsquo;m writing] I&rsquo;ve been reading a lot of the Knopf and LEC books that Dwiggins designed, reading them all the way through, and of course many of those are set in Caledonia, Electra, and a couple in other types. In most of these, the compositon is extremely welcoming and easy to read. In addition to the differences in warmth compared to digital versions, the other thing I keep noticing is that the mats fall down into the line in faintly-different vertical positions before they get sent over for casting. The more worn the mats, the more likely this is to happen. The result is a tiny discrepancy in baseline alignment from letter to letter, which to my eye adds variety and warmth as the line progresses. I&rsquo;m wondering if there is some way I can do this (and I am talking tiny tiny variations here) in making an alphabet that mimics this behavior of real linotype composition. After reading so many of these books over the past year, I have really become convinced that this subtle drift is actually an <em>asset</em> of linotype composition, and by its more precise nature, the inexorable perfection of digital type makes it too perfect, too relentless.&rdquo;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>And in answer to your particular questions.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>[To what extent is the varying x-height of the original old style types an integral part of the design?] It seems to me that the Old Gang very consciously made each size just right for its optical presence on the sheet (I&rsquo;m thinking of the dramatic differences in Janson from 10- to 12-pt, for example). Maybe they were so astonishingly good at what they did, using nothing but simple hand tools (and did they even have crude magnifiers in the 1400s?), that the slight differences in size from character to character <em>were</em> just as intentional.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Does it have any reading benefits?] Based on my experience with perhaps 30 books in the past few months, I say absolutely yes! Hence my musings in the quoted text of my previous post. These were set in linotype, but I think the effect is very similar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Done for reading benefits, camouflage bounce, other, combination?] Can&rsquo;t comment on their intentions. Results very compelling, however.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[When a revival emulates. . . where . . . draw the line?]
Yowza. Here&rsquo;s the crux of it all. I just made another comment over on the &ldquo;setting poetry in Electra&rdquo; thread because I think many digital versions of classic types are too emaciated looking. If you look there you&rsquo;ll see a sample of digital and metal Electra (12-pt) side by side. I would welcome the &ldquo;imitation&rdquo; of ink squeeze in digitally-composed and offset-printed books in these faces as I think it would improve their readability.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As a book designer rather than a type designer, for me it is all about the content of the text, how readable it is, and how much the type helps to convey the spirit of what the author is saying, far more than the fetching upswing of a particular glyph. <em>Apart from foundry specimen pages, these letters never exist outside the context of each other!</em></p>
<p>Therefore, the more readable and accessible we can make these &ldquo;revivals&rdquo; in the range of 10- to 12-point, the better. And in the case of treasured favorites of mine like digital Bembo, Electra, and Caledonia, the digitals have never begun to approach the warmth and readability of the metal. Therefore I have used them a lot in metal but rarely in digital. Is it too simplistic of me to think that this warmth could be easily attained?</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>[Would there be any merit in . . .  Contextual Alternates?] I don&rsquo;t understand the implementation of the technology, but it certainly seems appealing to me.</li>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Nick, as you know, I talked about this in my talk at TypeCon 2006 on my Caslon revival in progress.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, in my experimentation I found that variation at the x-height can be good if there is systematic reason for it. For example both Adobe Garamond (I don&rsquo;t have Premier yet) and my Caslon&ndash;and the original Caslon, though not with full consistency&ndash;have the stems at x height ( of nmr etc) going higher than the overshoot height of the o.</p>
<p>Also the cross bar of the t and f can be lower than the top of the x.</p>
<p>If there is some visual reason in the design why the d overshoot should be less than the o and b, sure go for it. But that kind of stuff didn&rsquo;t work for me. (Italics are another story.)</p>
<p>Such variation can look junky, and less readable, which is what I found when I tried more variation, without a strict visual logic to it.</p>
<p>For example, Bruce, I do not think that the jumpy baseline of the worn Linotype machines is responsible for the warmth of some of the metal types. After experimenting with it, I became convinced that it is a false trail. Of course that is just one person&rsquo;s opinion, but I have actually tried it, though not extensively.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>where does the redesigner draw the line?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no general answer to that question. What to adopt and what to change is a creative decision that depends on the designer&rsquo;s goals, analysis of the problem, and aesthetic and craft sense. That&rsquo;s why superb revivals like Slimbach&rsquo;s Garamonds and Jenson are not so common.</p>

<p><em>I have actually tried it</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about doing that for a while &ndash; varying several kinds of letterpress artefact with contextual alternates &ndash; and will maybe get round to it in a few years time, given the present backlog.</p>
<p>Bruce, the way contextual alternates would do that is by the page layout application choosing from a number of alternate versions of the same character, each time the text calls for that character. While there is no true &ldquo;random&rdquo; function in, say, InDesign, for doing that, there are ways of simulating the effect by coding in the font. Adam Twardoch and Tal Leming have done OT randomization. And of course the classic Beowulf by LettError, with custom coding.</p>

<p>Oh, Ok. Yes, it was in the slides as well as the talk. Because of the huge variation in all aspects of the original Caslon, as well as Linotype&rsquo;s 1923 Caslon&ndash;my other main inspiration&ndash;the issue of x-height variation is has been one of the issues I have focused on. There are three or four other key issues, as well as of course the thousands of decisions in actually drawing the glyphs.</p>
<p>As one of my inspirations has been the Lino version I specifically looked at the issue of baseline bounce. I had raised it here some years ago on typophile in discussion with Kent Lew. But I have not tested it extensively, or try to build it in systematically, as you are thinking of trying out. I just tried it on a few characters, and it looked worse to me as far as readability, so I abandoned that path as a false trail, and explored other ways of getting the warmth of metal Caslon.</p>
<p>Ps. Because Garamond was so brilliant and also (unlike Caslon) precise, I think the presumption should be that he had a reason for making the d&rsquo;s arch lower, if that is indeed the case. (You have to look out for damaged type etc.) I would guess that if one can&rsquo;t figure out the reason for such variation, then it probably isn&rsquo;t a good idea to encorporate it in a typeface. And if one can figure out the reason, it may still be a bad idea. Even the greats mess up now and then.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Not being a metal type expert and so on you all should take this with a grain of salt (of course) but I think that small variations in type do add up to a richer more compelling page if they are within the a sweet spot or range of movement or whatever the variation may be.</p>
<p>Psudo random movement maybe be good within that range - up to a point. But looking at <a href=http://www.talleming.com/pages/work/programming/openType/edInterlock/index.html> Tal Leming&rsquo;s work with Ed interlock </a> ( check it out! ) suggest again to me that deliberate combinations will be better still.</p>
<p>It would be a hell of a lot of work to do for a Garamond ( or Caslon ) revival. And the consideration of the variations would be far more subtle to consider than the ones available in ed interlock but I think the principle is the same - deliberate creation of well observed variation is a good idea for text faces.</p>
<p>In some ways this is of course just a reiteration of the claim/speculation I have been making related to Notan and idea that special variation made by creating letter combination specific alteration of some forms and special fitting for pairs and tripples in typographic text faces is the ideal.  I don&rsquo;t see why some degree of bounce aught to be excluded from the set of options within that variation!</p>
<p>Tal&rsquo;s scripts actually go far past pairs &amp; tripples. I hope I get to to talk to him to ask him about this.</p>

<p>The serif on the d can be lifted or smaller in comparison to the bhkl, also so as not to crowd with the bowl. It could be that Garamond lowered the d&rsquo;s bowl for the same reason, but maybe Slimbach thought it was a bad idea because of the break of x-height uniformity.</p>
<p>What font has a p bowl raised off the baseline? I don&rsquo;t know about that. In an old-style p the foot serif is relatively flat, unlike the triangular serif at the top of the d, so there isn&rsquo;t the crowding problem.</p>

<p>Some of Fleishmans typefaces have that. But he also has lowered bowls, and probably to make the ascenders appear larger becaise they are a bit short compared to garamond. maybe the inner space is large enough in bowls to not have to make them so big, they are round with a stroke, lots of space inside so readers will know it is a b for instance.</p>

<p>I do it a lot. Well, OK, maybe not off the baseline, but raised on to it with no overshoot. Here&rsquo;s something current.
It&rsquo;s necessary because things get a bit tight in the bottom half of the p, compared to the top of the d, say, as the descender is shorter than the ascender, and the serif is wider and on both sides.
The inconsistency of the &ldquo;overshoot&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t matter, as the presence of the descender makes that irrelevant.

<p>Bill: How is that Caslon of yours coming along?</p>
<p>Nick &amp; Bruce: Do you both think that subtle variation in a digital typeface to emulate letterpress will be entirely beneficial? Perhaps we are being overly sentimental, I would like to know if &ldquo;Joe Bloggs&rdquo; finds the warmth of letterpress baseline variation as inviting as I. The ink-spread &amp; weight of letterpress type was effectively my inspiration for Feijoa.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>2 humble cents from a neophyte:</p>
<p>The slight variations in the text do, I think, make a difference, particularly when reading poetry; &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; digital text is so efficient and easy to read that, at once, it lulls the reader to sleep and encourages skimming.  The slight variations (of all kinds) in metal - whether intentional or by happenstance or whatever - have the effect of slowing the reader down.  And whereas digitally-based fonts seem like counters holding/standing for content, the original metal impressions somehow close the gap between content/meaning &amp; typeface.  A least, this is so for me.</p>
<p>Is this just sentimentality?  NO!  Perhaps.  Okay..a little&hellip;<em>grin</em></p>
<p>@ William:  thank you for recommending Bringhurst; received it this morning and I&rsquo;ve been devouring it every since.  Gorgeous book, that.</p>
<p>Also, I saw your thoughts on Electra (metal vs. digital) in a 2003 archive <a href="http://typophile.com/node/10699">http://typophile.com/node/10699</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;The amazing thing about the metal Electra is that it seems so disciplined and free of quirks, yet is full of dynamism and vigor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To my way of thinking, and IMHO, this is as good a definition of poetry that I&rsquo;ve seen.</p>
<p>There is indeed a magical tension in the original Electra.   Cheers to all!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m not necessarily opposed to either &ldquo;bounce&rdquo; or the possibility of having some letters that behave slightly differently with regards to x-height or baseline (with some reason, anyway). But at first thought I tend to doubt that those variations were made specifically to conceal bounce; adding a second source of variation simply accentuates the variation (though it may mask the source).</p>
