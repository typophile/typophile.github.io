    are so low resolution its hard to really tell.

    was wondering, for the benefit of those of us ignorant in such matters, but who
    are very eager to learn, would you mind elaborating on your finding? What exactly
    do you mean, and how did you figure it out?\r\n\r\nIf it's too time-consuming,
    no worries. It's just a skill that I for one would like to start developing.\r\n\r\nCheers."

  body: "I'm really no expert, Malbright! I'm just very much in love with type and
    are trying to learn more about it every day and must say that this site is one
    of the best places to do that...\r\n\r\nI'll let you in on a little font-ID secret:
    One way to find out what fonts are in use is to find a PDF containing it, or information
    about it. In this case I found a PDF on the <a href=\"http://www.gourmet-works.com/\">Gourmet-Works
    site</a> containing the logo. After opening it in Acrobat and realizing that the
    logo was outlined and there were no font information to be found I opened it in
    Illustrator to study the curves. There I saw the strange overlap in the the lc
    m. I don't really know for sure that this is custom but based my guess on this
    little detail. I haven't seen this kind of curve joint in a character before..."
