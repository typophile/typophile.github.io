  body: "This is not bad for a second typeface. I would round or soften the corners
    more of the lowercase glyphs, to make it fit better with the rest of your design.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck! :)\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nMartijn van Berkel"

  body: Intriguing. I suggest connecting the tail of the Q the other way around, because
    it's just slightly G-ish this way.

  body: "Hi, thanks for the comments! \r\n\r\nI have started reworking the face to
    make the lowercase glyphs more round. The inspiration for the typeface came from
    brutalist and structuralist buildings and I used it in one of my projects. I'm
    also working on the other glyphs as well.\r\n\r\nI tried the Q idea and it looks
    much better!\r\n\r\nThanks!"
