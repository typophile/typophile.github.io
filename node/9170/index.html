		<div class="commentbody">hanif <BR> <BR>You might take a look at Monotype Pastonchi (available from Monotype Imaging). When the metal version was released the promotional book that was issued (printed, with specimen showings, by Giovanni Mardersteig) indicated that it was a complete rethinking of what constituted a renaissance face (based on hand written forms rather than printer's type, which at the time was also based on hand written forms). The Monotype metal version was released relatively late in the scheme of things so it never got its proper due. The digital version released by Monotype Typography in the late 90s is quite an exact replication of the metal version. It is quite an interesting and unique face.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nick <BR> <BR>Pastonchi is not a latter-day version of anything. It was effort on the part of Francesco Pastonchi and Eduardo Cotti to convey the letterforms of the Italian tradition in the fifteenth century. It was released by the Lanston Monotype Corporation, London about 1927. At least that is the date that is to be found on a printed specimen included in the printing of the Mardersteig book. The digital version was released by Monotype Typography in beta form in 1997. Does that make it a John Williams? <BR> <BR>The dates you give for Bembo, Jenson, Poliphilus are dates that are associated with the original printed specimens from which the early twentieth century metal versions of these faces were based. Since most digital typefaces did not exist before the mid-1980s how then do we find Beethoven?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Tiffany <BR> <BR>Pastonchi is not any less a revival than Bembo and Poliphilus are themselves tributes. In all three cases the typefaces are based on letterforms of the period. To say that Bembo or Poliphilus are exact copies of faces that existed in the 15th century is erroneous. They are simply reconstructions, as well as was Pastonchi. <BR> <BR>That Pastonchi did not fare as well as Bembo or Poliphilus has less to do with its pedigree than its late release, in 1928, and the much larger event that was forthcoming, that being the Great Depression. <BR> <BR>One can actually track the release or lack of release of foundry designs by the ups and downs of the back to back recessions that lasted from 1929 up to 1941, resolved only with the preparations for World War.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">That isn't what I was saying. I agree that none of them are exact. But, I believe that the latter three are closer than is your suggestion of Pastonchi. I also know that this is all subjective. It is simply my opinion that Pastonchi, and Brioso for that matter, are less close to what might be called an accurate revival of the 1500-era garamond-style type. Pastonchi reminds me a bit of Perpetua for that matter.</div>
