  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>The Double Acute accent, or Hungarumlaut, is a character that practically only occurs in the Hungarian language. Months back I posted a thread about it, because I feel there&rsquo;s a basic problem with the way the glyphs /ő/ and /ű/ are normally drawn, based on what I percieve to be a set of faulty guidelines for how to draw it. Not sure it matters immensely, but this site is for detail fanatics, isn&rsquo;t it? :D</p>
<p>The [[http://diacritics.typo.cz/index.php?id=24|Diacritics Project]] claims, in line with how most faces are drawn, that the double acute is meant to be <!-- raw HTML omitted -->optically centred<!-- raw HTML omitted --> over the character. Quite a common practice is also to set the accents <!-- raw HTML omitted -->tight<!-- raw HTML omitted --> next to each other, see for instance in [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/proxima-nova/thin/characters.html|Proxima Nova]]. I percieve both these aspects as &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; - I admit from the start - because the diacritic is used as a &ldquo;long&rdquo; version of the umlaut, and should therefore as far as possible be <!-- raw HTML omitted -->spaced apart<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as much as a diaresis, and also (because it&rsquo;s &ldquo;rooted&rdquo; in the umlaut) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->lean significantly to the right<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not<!-- raw HTML omitted --> optically centred but right of optical centre.</p>
<p>I was on holiday in Hungary recently and took the opportunity to photograph some signs around town with double acutes on them. I decided to focus mainly on lettering, because this I think gives a good impression of how people &ldquo;instinctually&rdquo; draw the glyphs. But let me start with a stickerier tale of two /ő/s:</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Budapesty-4030_5784.jpg]</p>
<p>Now, this is clearly not lettering, but I think it reflects the dilemma quite well: In the top row, the sign maker has put the diacritics off the stickers as originally intended in the typeface, close to each other and optically centred; in the bottom row their feel for the writing has slippd in and they&rsquo;ve spaced the diacritics wider than intended and put them futher right. I saw plenty of other examples of this &ldquo;mis-stickering&rdquo;:</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Budapesty-4031_4901.jpg]</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Budapesty-4029_5562.jpg]</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Budapesty-4032_5807.jpg]</p>
<p>The last one is tight but still &ldquo;too far right&rdquo; by convention.</p>
<p>Most extreme right-misstickering I saw all trip:</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Budapesty-2571_5378.jpg]</p>
<p>Thing is. When taking pictures of signs my original impression of what was &ldquo;right&rdquo; or &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; got several more complications. To be fair, there are examples of several kinds below - pure lettering examples, some draughtsman&rsquo;s lettering, some engraved, some digital, some hand-painted:</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Budapesty-4025_4009.jpg]</p>
<p>Traditional Budapest street signage. BIG accents, right-leaning.</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Budapesty-4027_5960.jpg]</p>
<p>Sort of a counterexample, but still clearly derived from and related to umlaut - low, flat, centred.</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Budapesty-4026_3884.jpg]</p>
<p>Another sort of counterexample, but again clearly related to umlaut in shape and placement as before. This one is actually left of optical centre!</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Budapesty-3796_4439.jpg]</p>
<p>Some fuck-off accents right there!</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Budapesty-4028_6451.jpg]</p>
<p>Sort of centred, but <!-- raw HTML omitted -->very<!-- raw HTML omitted --> widely spaced apart.</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Budapesty-3427_5966.jpg]</p>
<p>I realise it&rsquo;s script, but look how far right it goes compared to convetion! It also introduces <!-- raw HTML omitted -->another<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (still, I want to point out, umlaut-derived and related) variation I saw quite a bit on the hungarumlaut theme:</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Budapesty-3487_5249.jpg]</p>
<p>Long, tall, vertical lines for accents. The idea is similar to how they&rsquo;re drawn in hungarian handwriting.</p>
<p>(I also had this great example of DIN-Engschrift-like draughtsman&rsquo;s lettering with entirely vertical lines for accents, which I think worked quite well. Seem to have lost it in my directory though, can&rsquo;t seem to find it alas.)</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Budapesty-3959_3784.jpg]</p>
<p>Off a gravestone. Mostly still the &ldquo;enlongated style&rdquo; - very relatable to the umlaut!</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Budapesty-3960_6077.jpg]</p>
<p>Part of a memorial wall in the cemetary. Right-leaner.</p>
<hr>
<p>So. What do you think? If I&rsquo;ve learned anything it is to clearly relate the double acute to the umlaut. Am I right in thinking that?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Some typefaces shown here didn&rsquo;t have right diacritrics or didn&rsquo;t have diacritics at all. So they were added - as you can see on pictures 2,3,4,9,12 - later. This situation: misstickering, adding accents reflecting handwriting (or just imaginary ones), is typical for small &ldquo;adveritsing&rdquo; business in probably all postcommunistic countries.</p>
<p>For me, the best examples are: the first row of 1, then 6,7,8.</p>

<p>But don&rsquo;t you think the fact that people (in adveritising, graphic designers, signmakers, draugthsmen, shopkeepers) are putting the diacritics instinctually in a different place is interesting?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It always is interesting and sometimes - refreshing.
But it&rsquo;s contemporary type designers, who dictate the rules (or the typefaces dictate rules to the type designers), and vernacular solutions wouldn&rsquo;t work well in a font.</p>
<p>(Many Poles, including me, write a- and eogonek with the tail turned leftwards, what is opposite to the norm, but I can&rsquo;t imagine the use of such form in [even a script] typeface - that would cause both readability- and typedesign-specific problems.)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>To a certain extent, I guess. Though considering the number of Hungarian type designers today (we&rsquo;re not talking Kis Miklós here) it&rsquo;s worth remembering that the vast majority of typefaces are designed by people who don&rsquo;t read or use Hungarian.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m trying to suggest here is that Hungarians who do read the language largely see contemporary design practice as &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; - in feel, if nothing else - compared to how they understand the symbol to be. It would be interesting to do a survey among typography-aware Hungarians but this is as close as I&rsquo;ve got right now, that and my own instinct. :)</p>
<p>What problems would arise typographically - besides I guess kerning ones - from spacing out the accents more loosely and allowing a slight rightward overhang?</p>

<p>Which makes sense. After all, your examples show typographic/lettering work not of average native speakers but of designers (more or less). Gravestones are particularly interesting in this respect, and I would be curious to see more of them. And similar collections for other languages too &hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Personally, I think that &ldquo;we&rdquo; (I mean people using acutes), prefer when they lean a bit more to the right from the optical axis, because this kind of accent has a strong &ldquo;vector&rdquo;. When the stroke leans to the right, it seems to refer to the inside part of a given, not preceding, letter.</div>
