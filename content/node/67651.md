    comes to mind. It\u2019s from Paul van der Laan who helped with Kievit. Can you
    talk about the reasons why FF Kievit won't work for you?"

    is another, slightly more broad-pen-flavoured option. The family spans 9 weights,
    and also the italics have a double-storey \u2018g\u2019.   There\u2019s a <a href=\"http://www.hubertjocham.de/item.php/type/sans/SafranPro/\">Pro
    version</a> with small caps and extended language support.\r\nBut Stephen\u2019s
    right: without knowing why FF Kievit is out of the question, it\u2019s impossible
    to come up with suitable alternatives for you."

  body: "Thank you, Stephen. Thank you, Florian.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t really know wether
    or not Kievit will work. I guess it will. I\u2019m looking for a sans serif (with
    no or at least modest modulation) that is neutral and clear. It has to serve two
    purposes: (a and most of all) to work well as a headline typeface together with
    FF Scala (, Minion and Albertina) as body text typeface; (b) to work as a body
    text typeface as well (good legibility).\r\n\r\nI\u2019m just a non-professional,
    and I\u2019m just interested in typography for my own purposes (typesetting scientific
    texts). Hence, I like to be sure, that I\u2019ve chosen the \u203Aright\u2039
    font, before I purchase a license."
