  body: this is most likely a logotype... but the lowercase reminds me of Sinaloa
    and their might even be a little Revue in there as well.

  body: hmm i see the sinaloa in terms of the outer shape but not so much the revue.
    i could have sworn i've seen this font somewhere else....

  body: At a freelance gig today (it was my last day there), while looking for something
    else, I saw a font called <strong>Disco</strong> that is very close to the SOLARIS
    title -- except for the capital A, which had a rounded top... I hate to say this,
    but I was scrambling to finish a project and didn't have time to see who the manufacturer
    was... Now I am at home and haven't been able to find it via Google...  :-(

    Bloc Sculpture</a> and the O and the R like Monotypes <a href=\"http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=205270\">Braggadocio</a>.
    In this genre I also like to suggest Ole S\xF8ndergaard and Morten Rostgaard Olsens
    nice, simple and quite new font <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontpartners/fp_palina/\">Palina</a>..."

  body: 'Hey... <a href="http://typophile.com/node/34443"><strong>In this other thread
    the font Disco is mentioned</strong></a>... Apparently it is really called <a
    href="http://www.buyfonts.com/value_for_money/outland.htm"><strong>Outland</strong></a>...
    or maybe that is just a cheaper version of it... Can''t tell. Pretty similar to
    the font used for Solaris above. '
