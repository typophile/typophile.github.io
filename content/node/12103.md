body: "<strong>[[Indices]]: [[Foundries]]: Jukebox</strong>\r\n\r\nJukebox is a vibrant
  collection of script and display faces inspired by the designs of the 20th century,
  particularly the '50s and '60s. Drawing from the artistic and cinematic influences
  of his native Hollywood and the golden age of sign painting, designer [[Jason Walcott]]
  tries to capture the glamour and spirit of this era in his type designs. This library
  maintains an arguably American feel.\r\n\r\nThe Jukebox foundry (formerly known
  as JAW Fonts) was acquired by [[Veer]] in 2003 - <a href=\"http://www.veer.com/about/pressroom/releases/veer_pr_jbaquis_release.aspx\">Press
  Release</a>. The Jukebox library is distributed exclusively by Veer in North America."
