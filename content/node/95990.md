  body: "Sorry, don't know this type. A few similars though: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/madtype/mercado/|Mercado]]
    (global design very close, some cuts off and totally different /1) and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/gautier/colonel/|Colonel]]
    (right /1, right cuts but overall design looks different, mainly for /S), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dimitrelima/0arame/|Arame]]
    (part of the /S, looks too techy), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/double-dagger/|Double
    Dagger]]\r\nThe easiest way would probably be to directly ask designer/agency
    in charge of this design."
