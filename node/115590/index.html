  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello

Yesterday I released <a href="http://www.comicneue.com">www.comicneue.com</a>. Last night it was trending worldwide on Twitter, was featured on the front page of Mashable, Reddit, Hacker News, The Verge, everything! It has been downloaded well over 10,000 times in the last 24 hours, and there are an average rate of 800  people viewing the site at any one time.

I created the font in TypeTool, the cut down version of Font Lab. It was a two year side-project and I put a hell of a lot of work into it, but it needs a final polish from someone far more experienced than I am.

My name is Craig Rozynski. I've been working as a graphic designer for 15 years. 7 of those as a freelancer. I know how to run a project and you'll be in good hands. I am looking for someone to:

1) Improve the kerning overall, and
2) Optimise the appearance of the font on Windows.
3) Perform an overall quality check.

If you're interested in collaborating on this now world-famous (!) font with me. Please send me an email at craig at craigrozynski.com with a cost (or request for  more information if you're unsure), a turn around time, and any other relevant details.

Thanks! 
Craig Rozynski

We all have work from early on in our careers that we'd rather forget. Imagine if that work was was still being paraded around the world twenty years later?

I have absolutely no ill will toward Vincent. The response to comicneue.com has been almost all positive, although it has caused some ill-willed @ replies towards him on Twitter, which is a shame.

Perhaps I'm a little over-ambitious, but I would like to see Comic Neue become a redeemed version of Comic Sans. It needs a little more work, but the world (the online one at least) has shown overwhelmingly over the last two days that the interest is there. I just need a professional typographer to help turn it into a viable option for libraries and foundries like Typekit to take onboard.

Who is going to help me? It's paid work!</div>

Sure, Apple knocked off CS, but at least they changed the name.
Your derivative work is piggy-backing on the Comic Sans design and its name, which AFAIK is a registered trademark. Aren’t you concerned at the prospect of legal action?

You're probably right, but anyone can be sued for any reason. And even if the judge tosses out the case, it's a giant hassle and you'd probably have to hire a lawyer.</div>

Its hilarious.... the world is getting over chicken pox, it hardly needs chicken pox condensed or chicken pox light, much less chicken pox light condensed. I like the original strength chickenpox myself. This looks dull and watered down. </div>
