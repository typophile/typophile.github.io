  body: Gotham appears to me only as a very good ready-to-go option but I don't think
    it's the one. I comes very close for all letters except /a but I assume it would
    be not so hard to customize it. A geometric sans like ITC [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/avant-garde-gothic|Avant-Garde
    Gothic]] Demi-Bold may work for everything but /a (plus a slight edition on /P).
    /a is something completely different reminding me of the approach of [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/frutiger|Frutiger]]'s
    one. Something like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/neue-frutiger|Neue
    Frutiger]] or [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/free-set|FreeSet]] could
    work. My best option here would probably be [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/avenir|Avenir]]
    which combines the geometry of AVG and a double storey /a close to Polaroid.

  body: "I stand corrected, Ryuk (obviously, my eyes aren\u2019t what they used to
    be).\r\n\r\nTo add to your list of options, I\u2019ll add Basic Commercial:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/basic-commercial-lt/\r\n\r\nWith
    a bit of widening and flattening of the letterforms, and editing the |a|, it comes
    awfully close."

    you can download a vector version of the logo from brands of the world http://www.brandsoftheworld.com/logo/polaroid-3
    You should not use the logo for anything else without obtaining the express permission
