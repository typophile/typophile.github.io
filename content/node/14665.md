    the problem is that none of them aid me in the process of designing a typeface
    and I do not know which books does just that. I am looking for some tips and tricks
    and the basic rules. Could you point out some specific?\r\n\r\nThomas"

  body: The Briem site is good, also look on Google for Chank. Some might not like
    him, but he is there and has been. A good book, among many, is "Designing Typefaces"
    by David Earls, more history than how-to, but best of all are the interviews with
    designers. The Bringhurst book never leaves my sight, nor does Tracy's "Letters
    of Credit." Also good is "Typographically Speaking The Art of Matthew Carter"
    by Margaret Re, with essays by Johanna Drucker and James Mosley. Also very good
    is "Goudy's Type Designs" with text by Goudy. Goudy's commentary is very interesting
    and often amusing.

    of print but can be found in digital form on the net. If you'd rather take the
    non piracy approach, some members had copies for sale.\r\n\r\nMost of the information
    in the book is not specific to Fontographer and it covers the correct drawing
    of outlines from a technical perspective particularly well. Opinions as to its
    usefulness were mixed among typophile members, but I found it contained some very
    interesting information that I had not found in other books on the subject."

  body: the green text means there's a link to a wiki entry/wiki stub. The wiki is
    kinda buggy at this point in time, that's why you're getting "Access Denied."
    Hopefully that's all cleared up sometime soon.
