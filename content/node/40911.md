  body: "Judging from the propeller-powered Lockheed Constellation airliner, this
    ad is from the early 50's, well before digital fonts as we know them, and maybe
    even ahead of most film type. The very open C and S don't seem common in type
    samples I see from that era, so my inclination is to think it's custom lettering
    and probably not a commercial typeface.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
