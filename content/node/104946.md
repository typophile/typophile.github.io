  alternate), and then fiddled with it a bit, and now it looks like this. What do
  you think? (Sorry, I had to make new discussion to attach the pdf.)"

  body: "Hi Tomi,\r\n\r\nnot much to say about it. I think it looks great. I just
    think that the German Eszett has got an \"old school\" look. I would cut off the
    bar. And make the upper bowl a little bit wider and the lower bowl a little bit
    narrower.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nSteven\r\n\r\n"

    \ The g is more squiggly than the other characters and that is not required to
    tell it from the other letters.\r\n\r\n2.  The top story and bottom story look
    like they were drawn by different methods.\r\n\r\n3.   If someone cares about
    1 and 2, then they can use the other g.  \r\n\r\nQuestion: what problem is the
    double-story g solving?  "

  body: "I very much like the bold version and would use it in my projects. The uppercase
    G and B bolds are quite shy: the upper part doesn't reach out very much. I wonder
    what it would look like to type uppercase words beginning with G or B, like GUNNING
    or BOLD.\r\n\r\nNice. Robust."
