  discussions on Typophile for some time. I would like to submit for criticism this
  logo that I am developing. The client is a sort of web based \"job agency\" for
  companies.\r\n\r\n<em>Invenio</em> is Latin for \"I find\".\r\n\r\nAll comments
  and suggestions are welcome.\r\n\r\nYours,\r\nM\xE5ns\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sketch1_invenio_5238.gif]"

    think.\r\n\r\nYou're using the letter 'v' to make a compass, I believe you'd have
    better luck using a compass to make the letter 'v'.\r\n\r\ntry focusing on making
    a solid compass shape and substituting the 'v' for the southern pint of the shape,
    see if that helps!"

  body: "Hi. I think the 2nd example in caps works the best.  Maybe as a suggestion
    you could make a version with a less bold font, to see how that works out. Also
    in the 2nd version, is the V point the actual V of the font?  Maybe if it is you
    could look at making the compass something less like the V and more like a compass
    point.  I think as long as the point looks something 'like' a V then you would
    get away with it not matching the font as such.  Did that make sense?  Like the
    idea though.\r\n\r\nJH"

  body: "Agreed... the second one. Perhaps there is a way to make the box stand out
    more if that's what you're going for. Maybe use the color for the box not the
    star shape. My eyes see the star more than the box. Or if the box was black and
    the color was on the rest of the text? I don't care for the two colors you've
    used so far. Not on screen at least. \r\n\r\nI do like the bold more than I think
    I'd like something lighter in weight. "

    seems to be wanting something to go in it..maybe find some kind of iconic  art
    that conveys what the company is about... as is, the "compass" seems to overwhelm
    everything else.'

  body: "Thanks for all comments, it's greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nIt seems the all-caps
    version is the favourite. I agree the compass tend to take over the whole thing;
    below I am trying a lighter approach. The box is meaningless, though I rather
    liked the star-shape in the negative space. I have got rid of both in the versions
    below.\r\n\r\n@iffy: are the new colors better, you think?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sketch2_invenio_6255.gif]"

  body: "definite improvement all round I'd say.  Glad that most people went with
    the caps version. My favourite is the first one, as the compass points are a little
    more stylised.  You've probably tried it already, but does it work making the
    four points slightly bigger?  It doesn't matter in the first version, although
    if you were to go with the other versions, making the points a bit bigger might
    work to harmonise the lettering to the point.\r\n\r\nGood work.\r\n\r\nJH"

    the text and the star. The first one in the above picture is the one :)

    polished. \r\n\r\nI really like the shape of that v with the blocky letters. The
    narrow and tallness of it compliments the rest better than the shorter v does
    in the other options."

  body: Mans, why don't you drop the multiple V's and just have one, which rotates
    like the needle on a compass - pointing at the users cursor location on the web
    page... if it's a web based company you aren't limited to the constraints of print
    and static explanations of your idea. Just a thought...

  body: "jazzhustler, you're right: it is indeed a company and they will want stationery.
    Also I think a single, rotating V would be a little too playful for this particular
    customer (before the trademark is well established, at least), not to mention
    reducing the readability of the logo.\r\n\r\nI think I'll present the topmost
    version in the second image and see what he says.\r\n\r\n/M\xE5ns"
