  new stuff.\r\n\r\nI started creating Arabic font and I need all knowledge you are
  willing to share :)\r\n\r\nI created design for each letter in every form and imported
  them in Fontlab Studio 5.1.\r\nI still need to define final, initial and medial
  form through OpenType features (and ofcourse mark positioning).\r\nI don't know
  what to type, what code, so if you know some good 'instructions' for this please
  let me know :)\r\n\r\nAleksandra"

  body: "Hi \r\nDefining the features and lookups is a very technical and time-consuming
    job.\r\nAs far as I know the only free example for VOLT was made by SIL for Sheherazade
    font - but it did not work for me, and I had to ask an Arab professional.\r\nThere
    is an excellent booklet pdf that may be helpful to you:\r\nhttp://www.khtt.net/page/31753/en\r\nI
    think you have to join http://www.khtt.net/ to access this.\r\nGood luck\r\nVladimir"
