  body: "This is similar to a font called Bubba Love, which used to be sold by the
    Creative Alliance (Agfa). I think it was an old T-26 font. I think it still exists
    on the web, but probably at sites we would rather not aim you towards. Another
    similar font is Acolyte (formerly Temerity) by Brian Sooy.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    I have that House General collection and have used that font on spice labels I
    made for customers.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
