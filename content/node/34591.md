  to tell you what the titles of the fonts you see daily are.\r\n\r\nI found this
  on a record album cover, but its been in my head forever....\r\n\r\nhttp://i18.ebayimg.com/06/i/000/a5/2a/743d_1.JPG\r\n\r\nwould
  anyone be able to tell me what this font is called, and where i can download it?\r\n\r\ncheers!\r\n-dan"

    I'd recommend purchasing <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/urw/davida_initials_ot_std/\"
    target=\"_blank\">Davida Initials</a> since the upper- and lower-case are the
    same in the other versions.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: Probably, but your best bet is to look for it bundled. It is an old and popular
    font. It comes with some programs which you might even have, like Canvas 7.

  body: "> <em>Is there anywhere i can download it for free?</em>\r\n\r\nThis is a
    commercial font, so you're supposed to purchase a license if you want to use it.
    If you really want <em>that</em> specific font, I think it's only fair that you
    buy it. If you feel this font is not worth your money, then just use any old freeware
    font from DaFont."
