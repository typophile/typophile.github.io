body: "Hello Typophiles,\r\n\r\nCan you please help me in my search for a couple of
  Simplified Chinese language fonts called STXiHei and  STXiHei BOLD.  Apparently
  they were shipped with some versions of Windows, but am having trouble pinning down
  a location where they can be purchased. \r\n\r\nOne of our customers requires the
  fonts for their document composition system.  PCTT is the desired format.\r\n\r\nLook
  forward to hearing from you.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nNeil"
