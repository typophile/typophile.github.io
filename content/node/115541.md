  body: "I agree Joe, that Busorama is a match for the base font, although they may
    have used the URW version http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/busorama/ Note that
    the URW version has a capital A with a straight lhs -- as in the logo -- while
    in the ITC version both upper and lower case A have a curved lhs. [URW has the
    lowercase A with the curved lhs.]\r\nDon"
