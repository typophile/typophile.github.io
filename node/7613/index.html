<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I was hired to create a Corp.ID (logo design, business card, envelope, A4 blank) for a company, which specializes in car sales "automobile sales". <br> <br>The client wants a fresh and stylish look (but not abstract / more or less illustrative). The name of the company "Shik" in translation means chic/elegant. <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/53223.jpg alt=auto> <br>I would love to hear your critique and advices. <br> <br>P.S Any advices on the font choice are welcome.

<div class=commentbody>1) What kind of cars? <br>2) What kind of [potential] buyers? <br>3) How do Bulgarians feel about Arabs, or Turks? I ask because of the certain Middle Eastern flavor of that font.

<div class=commentbody>To Hrant : <br>>> What kind of cars? <br>&lt;&lt; All kind of cars. <br> <br>>> What kind of [potential] buyers? <br>&lt;&lt; Ranging from a penniless guy looking for a jalopy to a tycoon looking for a Porshe. <br> <br>>> How do Bulgarians feel about Arabs, or Turks? <br>&lt;&lt; Not so great, because of the turkish slavery on Bulgaria. It lasted for 5 centuries. Nevertheless, nowadays people are more broad-minded than they were for example 1-2 centuries before. It seems that the contemporary spirit of the bulgarians is trying to mingle with every single culture it come across. This creates an amalgam(mixture) of cultures, which in my humble opinion is not a good thing. Everybody is trying to copy the East or the West and not care about "us" and "here". <br>If I have to answer the question directly - No, there is no prejudice about the arabs and sometimes they are even thought as a good thing. (if we don't stem from historical point of view of course ;) <br> <br>>> Especially since it sounds like "sheikh"! :-/ <br>&lt;&lt; You are right about that. However, in Bulgarian the word "sheikh" is pronounced somewhat differently than the word "shik". In fact, the word "shik" in phonetical point of view is composited of only 3 phonemes ("sh" - diphthong, "i" and "k"). <br> <br>>> If it were Russia I'd say stay away from that style for sure (I still remember the way the people on the plane from Moscow to Novosibirsk were looking at me. <br>&lt;&lt; <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0> Don't mind them. They always gawk at strangers. (Beware stranger ;)) <br> <br>To Tanya : <br> <br>>> hmmm...spooky car. <br>&lt;&lt; Is it the color(black) that creates the spooky sensation? I didn't want to entangle in complex illustration. <br> <br>>> It's looking quite eastern to me. some kind of asian or indian thing going on definately. <br>&lt;&lt; I feel the same thing. It was not intentional, but after I am here maybe we can comment on the eastern look. <br> <br>>> ...has me thinking japan <br>&lt;&lt; I have to admit that the circular elements on the business card are quite japanese ;) <br> <br>>>...has me thinking Arab <br>&lt;&lt; It seems are though I have created a Corp.ID for an Arabic company. ;) <br> <br>To Scott : <br> <br>>> ..."cute" rather than chic. <br>&lt;&lt; The word "chic" in my language have a multiple meaning and is often perceived as the word "cute" with a slight tint of extravagant. <br> <br>>> I'm not sure about repeating it on both sides of the bizcard. <br>&lt;&lt; I'm not sure, either. <br> <br>>> Is there a reason you didn't layout out the letterhead in that same fashion? <br>&lt;&lt; It was a requirement for the envelope design - (to center the logotype) <br> <br>p.s Some propositions on fonts that look chic are welcomed ;)</div>

<div class=commentbody>All kinds of cars, all kinds of customers? You'll be very hard-pressed to find a non-generic solution that treats all those extremes equally. <br> <br>> Could this logotype (more accentuated on the <br>> type) extract the company from being mostly <br>> unknown to being well-known (speaking in <br>> local terms)? <br> <br>If you mean very quickly, then I think only by being highly controversial - and that's assuming you believe that "there is no bad publicity". <br> <br>For a chic font, preferably with an automotive theme, see if you can find a narrow, classical design that's a bit oblique. Maybe Eras? <br> <br>hhp</div>

<div class=commentbody>To Daniel : As I have said it is not a big company and the only target are bulgarians. Here the situation is not so uptight. <br> Of course, you are right about the racisim in Europe. As a matter of fact, two weeks ago I spoke about racism at the UNICA international student's conference, which was held in Amsterdam. My point is that racism may not be the issue I want you to comment on. <br> <br>P.S Please comment on the font choice. I think that this would be helpful and surely I appreciate your critique. <br> <br>To Hrant : Thanks for the advice. I will try Eras and possible think of something more controversial as a logo symbol (the only problem is that the client doesn't want abstract symbols). <br> <br>Salute</div>

<div class=commentbody>I agree that a wordmark instead of a wordmark/symbol would be a "safer" and more successful approach. <br> <br>In regards to what you have posted, I would suggest bleeding the red bar off the bottom of the page on the letterhead for more consistency throughout the pieces. <br> <br>Also, the circles on the business card do not work, in my opinion.

<div class=commentbody>I think getting rid of an "explicit" car is smart, for the reasons Tiffany mentioned. But it would be nice to have <i>something</i>, not just some letters. So try to think of something that any car has, and will have for the forseeable future. No, I don't mean cupholders.

<div class=commentbody>The car works a lot better when showing just a bit of it. <br> <br>Looks nice...though that envelope may be a pain to produce with the bleed like that. Also, maybe mail is different over there, but shouldn't the center be reserved for the recipient address?</div>

<div class=commentbody>I like the blue tones better than the red. Would recommend better domain name (a .com) and professional email account (not a free hotmail account) . I think the car looks like it sitting there in the corner lurking like a predator. The car, although already small, seems to draw as much attention as the name. The car would maybe look better in same blue as logo type.</div>

<div class=commentbody>just because the client says he likes the type doesn't mean <br>it's finalized. I think the type needs a lot of work still, and you <br>shouldn't be so satisfied just yet. <br> <br>the bottom of the letterhead isn't handled very nicely. <br>it's blocky and weighed down. it's also forced into a tiny <br>space. i would move it up a centimeter or 2. also, <br>the horizontal bars going right across the page are so generic. <br>there's no unique quality to them. i've seen that done <br>a thousand times. you could maybe just put the bars bleeding <br>off the bottom edge, like the business card does. also, the <br>repetition of the car twice is not very clean. <br> <br>and why not just center the logo at the top? it looks good <br>that way on the business card. <br> <br>... <br> <br>each element is too different from each other. <br>the hairline on the business card stops before reaching <br>the edge. that could happen on the letterhead too. <br>look at all the pieces together (above) and notice how the spacing <br>of each object or text block from a paper edge is different <br>every instance it's used. the logo, for example, looks best with <br>a certain amount of negative space around it. i don't think <br>you should ever cram the logo somewhere or put other objects <br>too close to it. <i>(back of business card)</i></div>

<div class=commentbody>Galin, I hope your client has plenty of money because the only way you will get the black on the envelope to work properly is to print and then convert into envelopes. Alot more expensive. Same holds true for your bleeds on the letterhead and business cards. Also when cutting the business cards with the knock out type so close to the edge you will have alot of waste and the overs will cost alot once again. I would suggest showing your designs to a printer and maybe get some feedback on how to make them work with in a resonable budget.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Also talk to the postmaster, or the equivalent. <br>I know in he states the USPS doesn't like anything on the bottom of the envelope on the right third of it, it's where the barcode goes.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thank you for your posts. I have made some adjustments of the bleeding and followed the loren's main advices. This is the result, which is in a different color. Although, I plan to use the blue. <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/53516.jpg alt=.> <br>P.S To loren : The client really liked the font and uttered explicitly that he wanted it to be the same way. <br>P.s.s please don't even mention the vibrancy of the white (front side of the Bizcard). ;)</div>
