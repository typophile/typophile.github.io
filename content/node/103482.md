  design competition held each year since 2008, the Granshan 2013 non-Latin conference
  will travel to Southeast Asia for its second incarnation:\r\nhttp://www.granshan.com/\r\n\r\nOrganized
  by Typographische Gesellschaft M\xFCnchen (tgm) and its partners*, the core of the
  event is comprised of four days at the end of July featuring workshops, presentations,
  exhibitions and a symposium. With presenters and attendees from all corners of the
  world, Granshan is the only conference focused on non-Latin typefaces. As such,
  it has itself become a focal point of this rapidly growing and maturing field.\r\n\r\n*
  http://www.granshan.com/en/good-ideas-strong-partners\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nCOMPETITION:\r\n\r\nNow
  in its 6th year, the increasingly prestigious Granshan competition has added Chinese
  to the list of writing systems the jury is qualified to judge.\r\nhttp://www.granshan.org/\r\n\r\nOrganized
  by the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Armenia along with Typographische
  Gesellschaft M\xFCnchen, the competition entry fee is a modest 20 Euro, and a grand
  prize of 1000 Euro will be awarded. The deadline for entry is the 20th of September.\r\n\r\nhhp"

    I've been there before (it was an amazing experience) but then I was only absorbing,

    so it shouldn't be a deal-breaker. I'll let you know when I know more, but you

    Lars Harmsen (Slanted Magazine), Gerry Leonidas and Karen Huang (Manic Design,
    Singapore).\r\n\r\nOne thing I'm excited about is that -for the first time- I'm
    going to take a workshop (in fact, two). They have some great ones:\r\nhttp://www.granshan.com/en/workshops\r\n\r\nBTW

    do. Just got to try and find a working battery for my laptop. Easier said than

    I wear shorts and tshirts everyday, but I'm guessing that would be frowned upon."

    sure you can find sockets - just make sure you have the right adapter. Are you
    taking a workshop that requires a computer?\r\n\r\nDress-code wise:\r\n1) Don't
    worry about it, especially if you're not a presenter.\r\n2) Remember that Bangkok
    is the world's hottest city (counting nights).  :-)\r\n3) Thailand has the best
    short-sleeve buttoned shirts in the world (silk). Buy one or two when you get
    there.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    plugs are already in use.\r\n\r\nI used to carry an extension cord too, because
    hotel rooms often had sockets in inconvenient spots, like behind the TV cabinet.
    Fortunately many hotels these days have added some in better spots, like on the
    base of the desk lamp."

    but there are cheaper flights to Bangkok from just about every South East Asian
    city than there are from Samui. I'd get a train but I'm pressed for time both
    in and out. It's going to be a flying visit ('scuse the pun!)"
