  Fedra which I intend to  <BR>use for body copy on future collateral. difference
  between top and bottom is &#34;T&#34; . I did 2-4 versions of just about all the

    working - try a form like two &#34;U&#34;s. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: The &#39;E&#39; looks slightly backslanted, and it lacks the <BR>&#39;flair&#39;
    you have in &#39;R&#39; and &#39;K&#39;, for example. I prefer <BR>the bottom
    &#39;T&#39; too. And I agree that &#39;W&#39; looks out of <BR>place.
