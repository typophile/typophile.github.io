  body: "The closest I found was Alternate Gothic No.2 http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/alternate-gothic-lt/\r\nThe
    Q seems to match the image, unlike Trade Gothic Bold Condensed No. 20, which has
    a tail that extends into the bowl, but the G has a spur like Trade Gothic Bold
    Condensed No. 20. If you replace the G with a C and tack on the cross bar from
    G, you should have a font that could replicate the image.\r\nDon"
