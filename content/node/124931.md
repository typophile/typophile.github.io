  \u201CFuture Relic 01\u201D (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwAucixwlxc&spfreload=10
  at 0:50) so that you could see it easier. The video was published December 16th,
  2013. I'm not very font-savy, so the farthest I got with my research is that it
  looks kind of like the San Marco font, which brought me to the conclusion that it
  was some kind of modern blackletter font. Your help would be really appreciated!"
