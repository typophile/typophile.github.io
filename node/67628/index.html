<p><a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bukacake/vasy-molo/">http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bukacake/vasy-molo/</a></p>
<p>I would be happy to get any comments from all of you, because I didn&rsquo;t had much feedback from typographers.</p>
<p>Anyway, when I made it, I didn&rsquo;t tought it would be accepted on MyFonts, so when I saw people was buying it, I started to think about a full charachter set and redesigning all glyphs to make them work better each others. I&rsquo;m also working on the kerning, hinting and all things that needs to be done to make it more &lsquo;professionnal&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Thanks by advance,</p>
<p>Bernard.</p>
<p>Edit :</p>
<p>Sorry for bumping guys, but I think my post should be in this place rather than in Release, as it&rsquo;s still a work in progress, and I&rsquo;d be very glad to get any comment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not here to tell you &ldquo;Yo Dude, buy my font!&rdquo;.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><P>Before we begin thinking the GHD IV Styler is following the same trend as video & DVD players, lets take just show just a few major differences. Firstly, the GHD IV Styler has almost nothing realistic competition. The GHD IV styler is widely regarded for a consumer and high end (hairdressers) while the number 1 hair styling tool.Secondly, as techniology developes the money necessary production reduces thus retail prices reduce. Well my answer suggestions that GHD haven’t handed over, any reduction in production costs with the retailer (salon owners). In fact cost prices have gone up resulting from <a href="http://www.louisvuittonpursebag.com/"><strong>louis vuitton bags</strong></a>  a surge in the RRP. Here we are at in the event the GHD MK1 to <a href="http://www.coachfactoryoutleti.org/"><strong>coach factory outlet</strong></a>  Mk3 were discounted one of the a RRP of ??99, the actual MK4 GHD styler provides a RRP of ??119.</P><P></P><P>Exactly what continues to be lowering the retail prices? The result we have found simple. Online competition, with online retailer endeavoring to out do eath other ghd hair straightener for being the lowest priced website for GHD IV Styler . I personally, work at a hairdressing salon <a href="http://www.coachoutletonlinepicke.com/"><strong>coach outlet online</strong></a>  and i know which price range of GHD IV Styler. Despite that these web based stores receive massive discounts on there products, they could still merely be making between <a href="http://www.coachoutletonline-bag.com/"><strong>coach outlet online</strong></a>  ??6-8 a hard and fast and perhaps any loss. I possed this with a senior GHD worker from a GHD event in the year. Her response, was which she believed, people were with their company as loss leaders to operate individuals to there sites. In the hope they retain the prospect for <a href="http://www.buyscoachoutletonline.net/"><strong>coach outlet online</strong></a>  future purchases of hair & bath and body goods.I cannot really buy into this theory.Lots of individuals will for sure invest in a straightners without additional shampoos and styling products. So, i’m not really really sure the way this works, in the form of long-term business strategy. The very first thing for several though, would be that the consumer might be gaining from these reduced prices. </P><P></P><P>In order <a href="http://www.coachpurseoutletss.net/"><strong>cheap coach purses</strong></a>  to find out about GHD and locate the ideal price on GHD hair straighteners, <a href="http://www.cheapcoachbagusas.com/"><strong>cheap coach purses</strong></a>  then visit our website GHD IV Styler Stockists.Stories about Britney Spears and her hair disasters are not uncommon, but was damage to britney’s hair just before the infamous shaving incident caused buy faulty, broken or damaged ghd hair straighteners? Faulty ghd’s usually are not all that uncommon and so they can on occasions over-heat and cause terminal damage to curly hair. Maybe Britney must have used a ghd repair service, there are a couple companies these days which can participate in a ghd repair shop with regard to ??19.95 likely the biggest ghd repair company in england and wales is Ion Originals Ltd. they run websites that include www.ghdrepair.co.uk It is advisable to get those ghd’s inspected they were eradicated or become faulty.Common ghd faults include: sparking, buzzing, intermittent power, cable faults & over-heating. </P><P></P></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Bernard,
Not sure why nobody else is saying anything – just wanted to peek in and say I really like this. I agree it might benefit from a little more polish here and there, but it&rsquo;s a very cool idea for a font, and seems quite nicely executed too. 
(BTW, Motion/Experimental? I&rsquo;d have put it in the «Display» category.)</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thank you very much for your comment. I&rsquo;m always wondering if that idea is a good one.</p>
<p>Do you think making a complete &ldquo;basic latin&rdquo; set would be useful for this kind of font ?
As it can&rsquo;t be used for something else than headlines, I&rsquo;m wondering if spending my time making it is a good thing or if It&rsquo;d better for me to get a beer and start watching TV ?</p>
<p>For the forum, I&rsquo;m a bit confused. As nobody was saying anything when I posted it in the Release section, I&rsquo;ve reposted it in Critique/Display, then I saw &ldquo;Experimental&rdquo;, so I thought it&rsquo;d be better here. But I can move it back to Display if it&rsquo;s more appropriated.</p>

Seriously though – I didn&rsquo;t previously realize you don&rsquo;t have Basic Latin. My first language is German, and without Ä, Ö and Ü I can&rsquo;t even set all headlines that I might need to. :-\  So yes, I think making basic diacritics for this font should be a good idea – and a cool little challenge, actually. I could imagine you can come up with some pretty cool solutions.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Elegant and legible, especially for something like this. One thing that bothered me about the original was the counter of the Q, so I&rsquo;m glad to see you&rsquo;ve already changed it for the better. Numerals, currency, braces are great.</p>
<p>Asterisk and daggers lack twist. I would have expected them to be all outward loops.
Exclamation could be wider.
Bottom half of Yen symbol should probably be a vertical rectangle.
Ampersand seems rigid. I&rsquo;d try trading the two little loops in the upper right for one big diagonal loop.
For @, I recommend starting over and not basing it on the A. I can see a big spiral with the inner end connected to the outer end.</p>

On some points I&rsquo;m just thinking &ldquo;How the fuck can I make it right ?&rdquo; But isn&rsquo;t it the game?</p>
<p>@eliason I tried such variation, but I wasn&rsquo;t very good-looking to my eyes, so I left it.
I can make it again and show you when I&rsquo;ll publish an updated version.</p>
<p>@ Yeah, the @ has been throwed up like this, so I agree that I surely needs a deeper reflexion.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>This is a really innovative take on a display font. I like it lots. Not only is it very different but it&rsquo;s also legible. Complete it and put it out there. I&rsquo;m sure it will get used. Very nice indeed.</p>
<p>About your variations: I think the only one that&rsquo;s actually working is the middle one. Filled shapes with negative outlines. But you may as well forget about the other two. If anyone wanted to get the effect of the first variation, they can do it with the original outlined font, and the last one doesn&rsquo;t look good and has some legibility problems.</p>
<p>About some shapes:</p>
<p>/H/ is not good. It doesn&rsquo;t resemble H. When I see it in alphabet I know it&rsquo;s an H, but if I&rsquo;d see in in text I&rsquo;d have problem recognising it. All the others are.</p>
<p>/!/ exclamation mark should be heavier. Considerably.</p>
<p>/%/ should be changed. I suppose it wouldn&rsquo;t be bad to try to overlap circled with the straight</p>
<p>/@/ although similar to how reg.trademark and copyright are done I suppose it&rsquo;s not a good solution. Although it makes me think who would want to write their email address using this display font (stupid of me&hellip; who would want to use Comic Sans in formal papers either?! We can see that many = this means you have to make @ recognisable).</p>
