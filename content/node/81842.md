  body: "This is similar to House Brush from their Sign Painter set, but I think it
    comes instead from a collection of Brush Scripts that was sold by Tiger Direct
    in the mid-90's. It was called the Expresiv Brush collection, I think. It was
    not a very well done collection, because the lettering was poorly done, but many
    fonts were based on old film scripts. Photo-Lettering had hundreds of brush-drawn
    styles, most of which were never digitized. You can see small samples in the Solotype
    Catalog published by Dover Books.\r\n\r\nWhile looking for this I noticed that
    Scriptorama Markdown (Veer) and Coffee Service (Canada Type) are also fairly similar.\r\n\r\n-
