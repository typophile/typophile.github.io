body: Hello all, <BR> <BR>I love the type used in this logo. Can anyone tell me what
  it is, or if not, something similar. Is this a custom font? Thank you for your time
  and help. <BR> <BR>- Chad<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/26035.jpg"

    target="_blank"> Ecco thread</a>. I think it&#39;s custom,  <BR>but what about
    Fabrizio Schiavi&#39;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fsd/monica/" target="_blank">
    Monica</a>?

  body: Hello, <BR> <BR>Fabio and Yves, thank you both for your amazing help. I now
    know who designed this logo, but unfortunately DM doesn&#39;t sell any similar
    fonts. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif" ALT=":-&#40;"
    BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>BTW - I like the look of Monica, but have to pass on Crisafulli.
    <BR> <BR>Thank you again! <BR> <BR>-Chad
