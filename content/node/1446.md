  gorgeous but running it through what the font yielded no results. I hope it&#39;s
  not custom. I&#39;d really appreciate any help you can offer.  <BR> <BR>It&#39;s

  body: Thanks Brandon. It does look that way. Your help was much appreciated. The
    strange thing is I bought Berkely Oldstyle many years ago. I don&#39;t know why
    it looked so unfamiliar. Thanks Again!

  body: It&#39;s got the right g and e, but other letters are wrong, like the u and
    y. I think this could be a possible hybrid with a few Berkeley Old Style letters
    mixed in with something else like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/spectrum/"
    target="_blank">&#34;Spectrum&#34;</a>. I looked at other Goudy designs, and <a
    href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/deepdene/" target="_blank">&#34;Deepdene&#34;</a>
    is closer in many respects, but not exactly right either.

  body: Wow! In my euphoria, the details escaped me. Good eyes, both of you! I think
    Birka is a better fit. Would I be premature in thanking you again?

    The ones who usually post here can get it from a fragment, which I am awestruck
    by.  <BR> <BR>I was interested in this sample because it has the slanted e, but
    has a different feel from Goudy&#39;s faces or from Jenson. On the linotype site,
    the designer says his influence was Garamond... '

  body: Another thing I find remarkable is that ITC Berkeley Oldstyle and Birka look
    so similar &#40;the lowercase es the uppercase Fs&#41; but don&#39;t share any
    cross influence, at least not according to the designer. He says he designed Birka
    from stratch, and like William mentioned, his influence was Garamond, and it took
    him over a year to draw. ITC Berekeley was derived from Goudy&#39;s design of
    Californian, which is an immediately recognizable influence. Things that make
    you go Hmmmmm ... <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: 'To me, Birka and Berkeley Old Style are significantly different. Even though
    the designer of Berkeley Old Style made it less ideosyncractic than its source,
    it still is stamped with the Goudy style. &#40;I actually like it better as a
    text face than Californian FB, which is truer to Goudy&#39;s California Old Style&#41;.
    Birka doesn&#39;t have the Goudy feel. If you look at the handling of the serifs
    and the thick-thin transitions, I think you will see the difference. '

  body: 'It has been my observation, and it&#39;s just my personal feeling, that many
    of Franko Luin&#39;s designs seem to have other inspirations. Some of them might
    be improvements, but I can&#39;t help from having the feeling that in general
    they are the sort of copies that metal type foundries often used to make so that
    they could offer a similar design to that of their competitors. I admit I haven&#39;t
    studied this too closely, in his case, but I have often looked at one of  his
    designs when I thought it was similar to something else I knew. One reason this
    impression is enhanced is the large number of his designs, and the strange fact
    that you don&#39;t hear his name mentioned when foremost type designers are being
    discussed. The other reason is that the more original they look &#40;to me&#41;,
    the less attractive they are. I know there are many ways you can explain this
    very subjective observation, so maybe you should just say I&#39;m not a huge Franko
    Luin fan. '

  body: 'Hmm. Luin has done his &#39;Classico&#39; versions of Caslon, Garamond, etc.
    I wonder also what others think of these vs rivals, if anyone has studied them.  <BR>
    <BR>The Birka does have elegance, at least at display size. I don&#39;t know if
    I have seen it as a text type - where Berkeley I have seen being used very nicely. '
