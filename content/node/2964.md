body: 'I have been looking at the relationship between a serif capital B and a serif
  capital E.  I noticed that in some faces, the waist of the B is higher than the
  central arm of the E. Why is this? It mostly happens in Venetian and Old Roman typefaces
  &#40;i.e., Monotype Centaur, Adobe Garamond&#41; that have an almost circular capital
  O and oldstyle proporations. Perhaps it&#39;s easier to keep the lobes of the B
  circular  when differences between the top and bottom are a little more exagerrated..
  but why not then just adjust the E as well? Does that make the bottom of the E too
  light? Or is it just a matter of personal preference? '

    divergence desired. <BR> <BR>There is a different &#34;dynamic&#34; in the two
    letters, though: <BR>In the &#34;B&#34; the width of the glyph is proportional
    to the lopsidedness of the two bowls: the smaller the top, the more the bottom
    can extend to the right &#40;without looking stretched&#41;. And in the &#34;E&#34;
    the height of the waist is limited by the &#34;empty look&#34; you mention. <BR>

    the inscription on Trajan&#39;s Column, Geoffroy Tory&#39;s Champfleury and the
    work of Albrecht Durer.
