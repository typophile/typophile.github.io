body: I've been working on this for not to long, and I'm wondering what you all think
  about it. Cooks Junior will be a new local PBS program with targeted at parents
  with recipes that parents can do with their kids, with connections to chemistry,
  math, ect. I've been thinking about the speach bubble motif, which granted, is extremely
  overused, but tried to make it cleaner but still playfull witht the colorblock for
  the "junior" text. I've so far chosen Gotham for "COOKS" and I'm not sure whether
  to use either Mrs Eaves or Base 9 for the "junior" text. Which set up do you prefer?
  also, any other type suggestions would be appreciated

  body: "Looks good! Here are a couple of things I noticed:\r\n\r\n1. I'd try A but
    putting \"cooks\" in lower case and junior in caps (leave it as is). That way,
    you give some kind of \"power\" to the word junior (making the kids part more
    important and making them feel important - even if the show is aimed at the parents).
    Actually, its kind of the opposite of the clich\xE9 (junior in lowercase, bla
    bla bla), It could give something interesting.\r\n\r\n2. Less space between cooks
    and junior and less space in the black bubble, around the type.\r\n\r\n3. The
    little curvy thing on the bubble doesn't look \"cartoonish\" enough. Maybe you
    can simplify in by reducing the curve and getting rid of that pointy tip (slightly
    rounded tip could work)\r\n\r\n4. The colors work, but I think that the desired
    effect may be lost as you have an odd number of letters. I would try different
    tints of green without repeating the same swatch.\r\n\r\n5. Tighten up the kerning
    between \"OR\" in JUNIOR (and between \"KS\" in cooks if you leave it in caps)\r\n\r\nI
    like the fonts you chose for option A.\r\n\r\nKeep it up!\r\n\r\n"
