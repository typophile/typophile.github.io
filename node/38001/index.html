  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>This has nothing to do with typography of course&hellip; But I post this question here because, as I recall, there is a prolific Typophile here with Armenian heritage, and I am seeking information.</p>
<p>I find this whole &ldquo;Vote on the Armenian Genocide/Turkey being really angry about it&rdquo; issue to be fascinating. What I don&rsquo;t understand is, why are there questions about this piece of history? Is there any documentation on the subject? It is so crazy and scary when there is a state-sponsored attempt to revise/cover-up history&hellip; But I don&rsquo;t know much at all about this subject. Can the truth be revealed?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The Armenian Genocide needs to be viewed in the context of the increasing instability of the Ottoman Empire. This doesn&rsquo;t in any way excuse what was done, but it explains the ferocity of the Ottoman response to Armenian independence activities. The Ottomans had already lost several areas of the Balkans and other territories, and were terrified of losing territory so close to home.</p>
<p>The continuing question around the Armenian Genocide needs to be viewed in the context of Turkey being a member of Nato, the only Muslim country allied with Israel, and a potential member of the European Union. The first two factors have allowed Turkey to dodge the question. It remains to be seen whether the third factor will force them to confront it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for the links. OK, I did some reading on the subject. John, you&rsquo;re completely right. Whether or not this was ACTUALLY genocide, is not really the point. Clearly, something &ldquo;genocidal&rdquo; occurred. Whether or not it is recognized as &ldquo;official genocide&rdquo;, at this point, is completely political. Which, I assume, must enrage Armenians.</p>
<p>At first I thought, how interesting! There must be some crazy mystery surrounding the history of the Armenian genocide! But really, it&rsquo;s just a lobbying fight. In addition, what has recognition of one genocide over another really done for the world? It seems to keep happening in one form or another&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->why are there questions about this piece of history?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Turkey’s strategically important location makes it important to people who want unrestricted overflight rights when they decide to bomb or invade Middle-Eastern nations. The Bush administration has been leaning on the EU to admit Turkey in return for said overflight rights, along with the Turks not invading Kurdistan, and there are some camps in Washington that are quite paranoid about the possibility of the Turkish government being replaced by an Islamist regime. So any major embarrassment of the Turks and/or their  government is a big political problem.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In addition, what has recognition of one genocide over another really done for the world?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Having other nations openly declare a nation to have committed a genocide is pretty embarrassing. And the Turkish government probably fears that once the Armenian genocide being condemned as a genocide around the world will draw more attention to the violent oppression of Kurds living in Turkey, and make comparisons between the two.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Genocide is genocide when it&rsquo;s politically expedient to call it same. What happened to the Armenians, what happened in Rwanda, what is happening in Darfur are all genocide, but the victims lack a powerful constituency. Almost as many gypsies as Jews were exterminated by the Nazis, but the extermination of the gypsies&ndash;lacking the influence of the World Zionist Organization, whose goal of founding a modern Jewish state were achieved as a result of the Nazi atrocities&ndash;is largely forgotten, or at least seldom mentioned, when genocide is discussed. On the other hand, Americans tend to overlook the fact that their European forebears eradicated a number of the native inhabitants of the North and South continents either intentionally (by warfare with vastly superior technology) or unintentionally (by the introduction of disease) that dwarfs any and all of the aforementioned genocides by several orders of magnitude. But, I suppose, genocide can serve a purpose: Jews have a State of Israel, and Native Americans have casinos.</p>
<p>If we move to the present day, James Puckett is entirely correct: Armenia then and Kurdistan now present serious problems for the Turks. This situation is aggravated in light of the present quagmire in Iraq&ndash;which is essentially an abstraction created by British colonialism, lacking any inherent homogeneity. What Great Britain called &ldquo;India&rdquo; (also an abstraction) devolved into two, and then three (India, Pakistan and Bangladesh), separate countries after the British adbication; what Great Britain called &ldquo;Iraq&rdquo; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ought<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to devolve into three separate countries (basically East Iran, West Syria and Kurdistan), but Turkey won&rsquo;t countenance such a reasonable solution, because it would require them to cede the Western Kurdish territories to the newly created Kurdistan, and turf is what it&rsquo;s all about&hellip;</p>
