<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I'm designing a mock ad for icecream as part of an entrance exam. My writing spelling and punctuation will be taken into account. I was wondering if i can have some suggestion on how to set the type correctly.
Here it is:
Not since the addition of chocolate to milk has there been such a seemingly unusual, yet tasty, combination.
Now my question is: are the use of commas correct in this sentence or do you use em dashes instead?
Thanx in advance
Mister M</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Commas seem fine to me, but I'd wonder about the use of the word "seemingly". Surely this says the combination <em>seems</em> to be unusual and tasty (but implies that it may actually not be)?
Not that that's a type issue at all, of course.

<div class=commentbody>The commas would be more acceptable than em dashes (in the UK at least) but em dashes could be used as they would draw more attention to the word tasty.

<div class=commentbody>thanks a bunch guys.
DTW in response to the use of the word 'seemingly'.The ad is suppose to promote a new flavor. I chose a combo of vanilla and Lucky Charms. Weird combo but tasty. I thought back to a time were someone might have experimented with adding chocolate to milk. And like most things new, they are often met with ridicule and skepticism. Imagine someone coming up to you with a 'new' spin on something you drank for years with no additives. Just pure milk. Some might say it looks like 'dirty milk'. But as time went on people loved it. i thought i could use that same story with this ad. But maybe if it's too vague i would definately welcome suggestion.
Tim i think i will use em dashes. I really want to enphasize the word tatsty. Maybe even italicize the word.</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I would write it like this:
<strong>Not since the addition of chocolate to milk has there
been such an unusual yet tasty combination.</strong>
The #1 rule when writing ad copy is to keep it simple. The same applies, or should apply to all kinds of writing, eg:
Good writing is simple and easy to understand.
You don't need to say any more. Adding words to that sentance or trying to be more specific---or clever---would only complicate it and make it bad writing. Stick to the point. Most attempts to be clever produce self-conscious "writerly" prose. A staggering number of internet users exhibit this trait, trying to mimic what they think is the scholarly authorative tone of professional writers. It's a plague. Blog owners are the worst afflicted.
Keeping it simple includes a simple approach to punctuation. Where possible leave out commas. I understand why you put those commas where you put them---they seem like they should be there when you analyse the sentance structure. But they don't really need to be there. Inexperienced writers tend to add commas when reading back what they've written at a slow, analytical speed. The falacy is that people reading your text don't read at that speed; they read as fast as possible because they've left the oven on at home and need to catch the 5:17PM bus.
"Seemingly" is best left out for 3 very good reasons. 1) It complicates the sentance. 2) Ad copy can't be ambiguous. The product either is an unusual yet tasty combination, or it isn't. No two ways about it. To convince readers and make them absorb the message you must be decisive. 3) "Seemingly" adds another word to the count. A slogan has to be breif.
<em>em dashes could be used as they would draw more attention to the word tasty.</em>
Depends. Being a big user of the em dash I often recommend them in favour of commas. Will this be set in a text font using text setting conventions, or in display type using display typography?
<strong>Not since the addition of chocolate to milk has there
been such an unusual---yet tasty---combination.</strong>
That is more effective, but you end up hanging on "combination". Here's the solution:
<strong>Not since the addition of chocolate to milk has there
been such an unusual---yet tasty combination.</strong>
An alternative is to use color and size---make "tasty" bigger & louder, sans em dashes.

You could also spice up the writing to give it context and make it less technical, more colloqial. <em>Who</em> added milk to chocolate?
<strong>Not since they added chocolate to milk has there
been such an unusual---yet tasty combination.</strong>
The ubiquitous, ever-present, anonymous "they".
What else could you do? Bung an ellipsis on the end to add a sense of mystery & intrigue, the air of inuendo. There's more to this icy-cream ;-) than the ad reveals, but if you don't buy one you'll never find out. Good ad copy is always ambiguous in some way. What you don't say is as important, sometimes more important than what you do say.
<strong>Not since they added chocolate to milk has there
been such an unusual---yet tasty combination...</strong>
Can I ask what kind of course you're taking the exam for? Design or advertising? Something else?
Edit: Ivan, you posted your response just before I posted mine :^)

Yes, but advertising has to overcome that, and usually does by being positive. "seemingly" leaves room for doubt.

<div class=commentbody><em>The commas would be more acceptable than em dashes (in the UK at least)...</em>
Acceptable to who, and in what kind of publication? In a technical paper maybe. In a magazine article or newspaper em dashes are less used than commas by editors. In a novel em dashes are widely used and accepted by readers.
Ad copy writers do whatever they like, because they can, and consumers don't take advertising copy seriously, if they notice it at all. Confounding Marshall Macluhan, the medium is not the message---the message is the message.
Advertising---gone today...gone tomorrow.

<div class=commentbody><strong>Unusual</strong> and <strong>tasty</strong> aren't necessarily mutually exclusive; rather than wrestle with a subordinate clause and how—or if—it should be separated, why not simply say <strong>… a surprisingly tasty combination</strong>?

<div class=commentbody>Neither "unusual" or "tasty" really cut it. They're not the kind of descriptive words used in real ads.
Get jiggy with it. Be provocative:
delicious
irresistable
mouth-watering
scrumptious

I know---they make it sound like every other ad for confectionary. Consult Roget's Thesaurus for more alternatives.

<div class=commentbody>All reminds me of <em>“The greatest thing since sliced bread”</em>, maybe it's just <strong>since</strong> that reminds me of that. How about <em>“The tastiest* combination since chocolate was added to milk”</em>, a classic, even clichéed, form of copywriting.
I meant to add to an earlier post about clauses that the em dash is very rarely used in the UK, generally a thin space en dash thin space would replace an em.

While we're at it, though, perhaps adding vanilla to cereal (and milk) is too similar to adding chocolate to milk for the comparison to hit home; the comparison is really between chocolate and vanilla. How about "The envy of chocolate milk" or "Chocolate is obsolete"?</div>

<div class=commentbody>I LOVE THIS!. Thanks, all of you. James you make perfect sense. I guess I didn't think about it in the sense you described it. Judging by your in-depth analysis I suck at copywriting. But that's ok I never thought I could ever be one. Design has always been my strong point. But belive me, I have learned so much about what it takes for effective copywriting from your response. This is a mock ad for an ice cream brand and new flavor. Writing, spelling and punctuation will be evaluated so I wanted to make sure things where perfect.
Miss Tiffany you're right about the use of the word unusual i'll change that.
How about this?
Not since they added chocolate to milk has there been such a suprisingly delicious combination...

<div class=commentbody><em>Wow this is an incredible amount of over-analysis isn’t it.</em>
Yep. Very similar to what goes on on Typophile Critique and Design threads: designers and typophiles nitpicking and going into minute detail about the design of letters and layouts.
<em>I meant to add to an earlier post about clauses that the em dash is very rarely used in the UK, generally a thin space en dash thin space would replace an em.</em>
I'll take your word for it. Its been a long time since I was in England.
<em>Judging by your in-depth analysis I suck at copywriting.</em>
Naw, you needn't be that cynical :^) Lets just say you're inexperienced. You can't expect to be good at if you don't have a natural bent for it.
<em>Jiggy</em>
tounge-tingling
soul-tingling
mind-tingling
mind-blowing
<em>not since the addition of milk to chocolate</em>
I still think "the addition of" is too technical and literal (as opposed to literary) for an ad.
not since;
milk was added to chocolate (the simplest version, most copy writers would use it)
milk got it on with chocolate
milk got jiggy with chocolate ‹--- ding! ding! ding!
milk ran into chocolate
milk ran away with chocolate
the dish ran away with the spoon
milk encountered chocolate ‹--- ding! ding! ding! ding! ding!
milk married chocolate
milk bumped into chocolate ‹--- ding! ding! ding!
milk met chocolate
Harry met Sally
<em>Not since the dish ran away with the spoon.</em> Seriously, this could be used to sell soup, pudding, yoghurt, canned peaches...any kind of food eaten with or without a dish and spoon.
Inspirational words and metaphoric literary devices do better job of capturing the imagination and involving us emotionally. The dish running away with the spoon creates a nostalgic mental image, a handy, instantly familiar backdrop for a food product.
All the best with your career Mister M
