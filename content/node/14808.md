body: "hello all!  i'm a newbie and have spent hours and hours searching for the fonts
  for my wedding invitations on myfonts.com and came up with the following ones i
  love:\r\nscript - Inspiration ROB  (like best cuz it's funky and more casual)\r\nrest
  of invite - garden party or cataneo light  OR\r\nscript - p22 Ruthie\r\nrest of
  invite - locarno light\r\n\r\nmy questions are these: will those fonts work in a
  smaller size? say 14 to 16?  do you have any other suggestions for good fonts that
  won't cost me an arm n leg and that will print nicely?  also, does the P22 mean
  anything on the font name - like it prints best or only at 22 pt?   \r\nthank you
  so much for your help!! have a great week!  karen\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: 'P22 is the foundry name: it has nothing to do with what sizes it will print
    best at. Most of the invitations we do in our print shop are set no smaller than
    16 point, with 20-24 pt. being most common. Maybe it''s because older recipients
    have poorer eyesight (and are more likely to have bigger bank accounts = better
    gifts).'

    Script</a> highly enough!\r\n\r\nIt's also an opentype font that pushes it's glyph

    sister's wedding invitation</a> in Ministry Script and she loved it. I splurged
    on the type cuz its part of my present to her and i just wanted an excuse to purchase
    it. but if you're looking for something a little easier on your invitations budget,
    it looks like <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=rob+leuschke\">Rob
    Leuschke</a> designs are what you're looking for. If you like the Minsitry Sript
    suggestion, take a look at some more stuff by <a href=\"http://www.sudtipos.com/fonts2.htm\">Sudtipos</a>.
    I just love their scripts. If I ever get married, I'm gonna use <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/plumero-script/\">Plumero
    Script</a> on my invites.\r\n...oh and [[p22]] fonts should work at any size,
    if they don't email me directly! ;^D"

    of fine details. I just made <a href="http://www.itsmyinternet.com/wedding_invitation.jpg">
    my invitations </a>in <a href="http://www.p22.com/sherwoodtype/avocetset.html">P22

  body: 'thank you one and all for your suggestions!  i really appreciate your helpfulness.  i''ve
    narrowed it down to between two "types" of invites and am still working on the
    font situation.  it looks like the smallest they''ll need to go w/b 16 pt (but
    that''s from using bradley hand from word, so not sure what the actual font will
    need to print at to make it fit).  must say i do LOVE the ministry script but
    think it''s a bit formal for what we''ll be doing (not much formal or traditional
    about this wedding!) :D  thanks again!  '

    should post it even if you don''t have time, I for one am curious on how your
    unformal non-traditional invitation will turn out. '
