  I don't know if it's a result of web resolution or what, but the type looks like
  it has sharp counters, with curves on the outside, it caught my attention. Any guesses?\r\n\r\nBest

  body: Feed me garlic and call me stinky, but from looking at their website, too,

  body: I didn't even think to look and see if they had a website. Maybe the effect
