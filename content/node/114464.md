  sketched and vectorized: 314\r\n\r\nThe 314 logo is for an art studio out of Portland,
  located in a heavy industrial area of the city. The stencil letterings were inspired
  from the local trains which cross right in front of the studio. \r\n\r\nI feel that
  the \"3\" needs some editing but im not so sure? The letter is 4 units tall x 4
  units wide.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/314 Option Showcase_5339.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nSG"
