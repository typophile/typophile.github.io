  be Electra, or perhaps Fairfield? I think at least one of them is Electra. I'd appreciate
  any help. \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_1141_5594.JPG]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_1143_3438.JPG]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_1145_5721.JPG]"
