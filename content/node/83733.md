  Futura font. Our client is planning to sell the products in Asia, so I'm trying
  to find alternate fonts to use in Japanese, Korean, Chinese, and Vietnamese that
  match the look of Futura. It would be really helpful if anyone can help me with
  some advice or suggestion of where to go to.\r\nThanks a lot.\r\nTran\r\n"

  body: "Refer to the following thread for Korean:\r\n\r\n[[http://typophile.com/node/70367]]\r\n\r\nI
    must warn you that the best candidate for a Korean Futura, \uC724\uCCB4 (Yoon-che),
    is currently available only as part of a multi-font package worth almost a thousand
    US dollars.\r\n\r\nI think you should first decide what to do about Vietnamese.
    It looks like Futura might never have been extended for Vietnamese, at least from
    a cursory web search, so that poses a problem.\r\n\r\nIn the end, it might be
    easiest and cheapest to settle for neutral sans-serif designs for the required
    scripts instead of trying too hard to emulate Futura's harsh geometry."
