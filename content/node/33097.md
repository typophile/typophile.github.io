body: "Can any of you type geeks give me an example, or several examples, of a <em>good</em>
  type superfamily with the primary design serif (better Old-Style) and the companion
  design slab-serif. <!--break-->I only know of two such superfamilies: Erik Spiekermann's
  and Christian Schwartz's <a href=\"http://christianschwartz.com/dbnews.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">DB
  Serif / DB News</a>, or Jean-Fran\xE7ois Porchez's <a href=\"http://www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/view/LeMondeLivre\"
  target=\"_blank\">Le Monde Livre</a> / <a href=\"http://www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/view/LeMondeCourrier\"
  target=\"_blank\">Le Monde Courrier</a>. I know there are more styles to either
  family, but I am primarily interested in the serif/slab-serif relationship. I suspect
  there should be more similar designs out there. Thank you in advance."

    sizes it will work anywhere."

      are the primary ones in their respective superfamilies. I find the FF Nexus
      example quite relevant. Thanks a lot."

    to Lucida's (Regular/Bright) and Lucida Fax's, or Lucida Typewriter's."

  body: I wouldn't call TheAntiqua the "primary" style either tho since it's much
    newer. I don't even have it yet.
