  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>I know this is the OS X forums, but I trust you with most things so I thought I&rsquo;d ask about my most recent catastrophe.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t go into the nasty details, but at this point in time I find myself unable to copy files from my second internal drive. I&rsquo;ve tried Apple&rsquo;s Disk Utility and it won&rsquo;t perform the repair. I&rsquo;ve tried starting up from DiskWarrior and it won&rsquo;t run either &ndash; DW stops when it is on step 5 (directory). I&rsquo;m going to go back to the office and try running Disk Utility from the TIger startup CD later.</p>
<p>I was talking to a friend last night who said it is likely the main area &ndash; don&rsquo;t recall what he called it &ndash; has been damaged. He loaned me an external drive to try and copy to it.</p>
<p>If the drive ist kaputt, I am kaputt. Why are lessons learned only after you have to learn them? If I can get the files that is my worry. I will buy another drive if this one is beyond repair. All projects, fonts and itunes are on this drive. Boy. I&rsquo;m scared. Suggestions?</p>
</div>

<p><a href="http://discussions.apple.com/index.jspa">http://discussions.apple.com/index.jspa</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure which topic area would be most appropriate in your case, but I&rsquo;ve had good luck there. It has replaced MacFixit as my resource of first resort when I have Mac troubles.</p>
<p>(I had a drive completely fail last summer. Luckily, it was mostly used for sporadic backups, but it was a wake-up call for me. I now have an automatic system in place that backs up my most-used drives daily, archives weekly. Word to the wise.)</p>

What a dreadful Christmas dilemma! 
I have had good luck with DiskWarrior in the past.  If this fails, there are places that can often recover data from a failed drive.  Do you live near an Apple store? My daughter had her kaput drive data salvaged by an Apple tech.  There are other places besides Apple that do the same.  If you can remove your drive and bring/ship it to one of them they may be your salvation.</p>
<p>Best of luck to you,</p>

<p>Repair vs. Verify : try first the verify  option - check for and report problem. Very important: you don&rsquo;t want always  to fix the problems, since by doing so may cause more problems!!!</p>
<blockquote>

<p>usually when DW stops on step 5 there&rsquo;s a little message : &ldquo;speed inhibited by disk malfunction&rdquo;   - did you see that?</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s  no doubt  that you have corrupted file(s).  the directory  is the main component that  First Aid  checks; and the directory contains the info where every file is located.</p>

<p>well, I won&rsquo;t say that since your aim is to fix the problem. However, this is good idea to back up the files.</p>

<p>When Disk First Aid reports that the thread for a file is missing and it cannot repair it, this means that it is unable to reconcile the entry for the file in the directory (catalog B-tree) with the location of the file on the volume. This indication can be triggered by the following:
The file in question may have become damaged and cannot be repaired.
The catalog B-tree may have become damaged and cannot be repaired.
An earlier version of Disk First Aid (which cannot repair volumes currently in use as the startup disk) is being used to try to repair the startup volume. Try booting from another volume such as a System Install CD, and run Disk First Aid from the CD.</p>

<p>Not to confuse:</p>
<p>OLD CPU &ndash;&gt; NEW CPU = All hell broke loose on OS9 drive, but OSX drive was happy.
NEW CPU &ndash;&gt; OLD CPU = Could copy. Proceeeded to move all files to a 3rd computer.</p>

<p>While your problem seems to be resolved, I thought I would share a relevant personal story. My PowerBook 12&quot; died a few months ago while still under warranty, so I took it to the Apple Store. I couldn&rsquo;t get to the files on it, no matter what I tried, and neither Disk Utility nor Disk Warrior would allow me to start the computer.</p>
<p>The clever bloke at the Apple Store was able to mount my PB as a FireWire disk and through Terminal he was able to pull files off of the hard drive and copy them into the hard drive of the host computer.</p>
<p>So. When Disk Utility and Disk Warrior fails, go and find yourself who&rsquo;s handy in Terminal.</p>

<p>David, I&rsquo;m copying all my files back to my newly erased secondary drive. If all is well then I can actually start working again. If not, I might have to reinstall the system. If I didn&rsquo;t use classic &ndash; every blue moon or so &ndash; then I&rsquo;d not need to reinstall anything. I also have to tell FontExplorer where the fonts are and iTunes where the music is &hellip; other than that all is good &hellip; so far.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Mounting the drive over firewire is neither drastic, nor does it (in my experience) require Terminal.
You just string the firewire cable between two macs, unplug all your other firewire doodads and geegaws, make sure the functioning mac is already on, then boot the bad mac while holding down your &lsquo;T&rsquo; key. It should mount on the good mac as a drive, and you can access files just as you would any other mounted drive.
It&rsquo;s saved my bacon a couple times, and is far from a last resort&ndash;it&rsquo;s one of the first things I do.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">David, to answer your question: There was a bad block on the hard disk, which was obviously there for a long time, but which was not a problem until I installed Tiger from scratch. In this situation, the only way to get to the files on the hard disk were using Terminal. (Trust me Matomatic, the PB would NOT mount, so only through Terminal could the supergeek at the Apple Store get to the contents.)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">We had a cat a long time ago that had a jones for computer cables. We just got a new cat recently (after my daughter pressured us for about two years). So far, he does not seem very interested in computer cables (unless you dangle them in front of him). I have mixed feelings about having a cat in the house. He can be fun to have around, but it&rsquo;s not unlike having a squirrel living in your house.</div>
