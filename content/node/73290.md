  fcce. I think their home page describes best what they do. http://www.fcce.tv/FrmShowConents.aspx?mid=1\r\nThey
  wanted a logo that looks modern, professional, businesslike, international, but
  also a bit trendy. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fcce4_4529.jpg]"

  body: "Definitely better than their existing logo.\r\n\r\nMy one concern is that
    the 'f' doesn't read as an 'f' but as a long 's'. This could pose a problem, especially
    since this is an international company.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: My original logo for this company was with a normal f, but I like this. I'll
    wait what they have to say about it. It's their choice now. Their existing logo
    is crap, so it's not very hard to top that.

  body: I like the type for fcce but the I think that the type for distribution, production
    and brandevents is a little too plain. Expected something more interesting when
    the fcce bit looks like it does. Otherwise it's very nice.

  body: Thanks for your comment. The type for distribution, production and brandevents
    is much smaller, but still has to be legible when the logo is scaled down.

  body: "Why is 'brandevents' one word? What's the grey bracket thing? \r\n\r\nThe
    long 'f' is nice, but it reads a little too close to the 'c' at first glance without
    the right bit of the crossbar, and, yes, close to a long 's.'"

  body: It's a dutch company and they wanted brandevents to be one word. Don't ask
    me why. The grey bracket thing as a very abstract tv screen. I really can't figure
    out how you can see a long s in this. The ony s I can find would have a massive
    tail, so I don't think anybody would actually read this as an s. Please tell me
    if I'm wrong.

  body: "It probably wouldn't be a problem for non typophiles. The long s isn't just
    a decorative s that is long, it's an actual character. http://www.creativepro.com/blog/typetalk-get-know-long-s\r\n\r\nThe
    grey bracket isn't working for me. It doesn't really work with the type the way
    you currently have it. I'd explore more options . . . more sketching."

  body: "yeah, but long s's are hardly used anymore. Are they? Being a non-typography
    guy I really don't think you have anything to worry about. \r\n\r\nI actually
    like the tv frame, but was wondering if the 'fcce' might benefit if it followed
    the perpective of the frame. it might give it a bit more depth? Otherwise it does
    look a bit awkward. "

    I lost the match, so this topic is over.

    you didn't know why \"your\" client wanted \"brand events\" to be one word. \r\n\r\nPlease,
    please stop doing design contests. I'm actually begging you. I don't have the
    energy to engage in this never-ending battle today, so please read [[http://typophile.com/node/58639|this
    thread about the evils of logo contests]] or [[http://typophile.com/node/2167|this
    one]], and consider the HUGELY damaging effects your participation in logo contests
    has on other graphic designers and the quality and value of design work.\r\n\r\n"

    on your own anyway, feel free to use the contests as a way to exercise your design
    brain without posting your work. \r\n\r\nFeel free to post it here for crit too,
    that way you get experience and feedback without supplying free work to companies
    that don't deserve it :)"

    a non-profit/charity and volunteer your design services. That will give you a
    much more realistic experience of working as a designer, and, you'll genuinely
    build your portfolio in a philanthropic way that will truly impress potential
    employers. "

  body: Thanks guys, but for now I'm just going to focus on my typefaces. I feel I
    have more talent for typedesign than logodesign. I might follow your advise in
    a few weeks. I'm not going to Logomatch anymore. That's for sure.
