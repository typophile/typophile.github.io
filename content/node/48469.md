body: "I recently purchased P22's new type specimen book and have been enjoying \"reading\"
  it! Yes READING! The chosen text for each sample is both informative and enjoyable.
  The visuals are fun as you might expect from Mr Kegler, et al but the writing brings
  back fond memories of the typebooks of old.\r\nThe book is also very helpful to
  those not familiar with the P22 web site and makes shopping for type much easier
  than trying to navigate the web site unaided.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.p22.com/products/specimenbook.html\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: 'Thanks for the report Bert. This is in many ways an experiment (using a third
    party print-on-demand printer/delivery system), so it is good to hear any reports
    of issues. "Perfect" binding is not something I would normally want to use, but
    options are limited for this type of thing. If the book does fall apart, send
    it to me and I will get you a fresh one. Please email me offlist. '

    I would rather have something in print than just a PDF even if the binding is
