  to measure success. In short what this means to me is that I have to provide my
  supervisor with the criteria by which he is to measure my personal success, as well
  as suggestions on how to measure the success of our unit as a whole.\r\n\r\nSo I'm
  wondering how you all are measured or evaluated in your jobs. What elements are
  taken into consideration? It would be most useful for me to hear from people who
  hold editing/proofreading and page layout positions. Obviously, certain factors
  will be company-specific (ensuring that the success is in line with company goals),
  but what else? Is your performance evaluated based on how correct the publications
  are? How many typos slip by? What about measuring success at being creative? \r\n\r\nAny
  input would be appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nKristina\r\n\r\n "

    who did a 3-1/2 hours of interviewing and testing at DR&A in Berkeley for a position
    for, if I remember right, supervising the work of two copy editors on three magazines.
    He told me that the test was like the math problems of old, i.e., a scenario is
    given whereby such and such person purchases a certain number of items, etc.,
    and the proofing test involved finding numerous repeated items such as too many
    or too few spaces between words and sentences, numbers that should have been spelled
    out, Romans that should have been Italics and vice versa, and misspelled words.
    Apparently $40K was too much to ask.\r\nI am not sure if this was the place but

    my job year after year, so I would imagine that if I sucked then I wouldn't get

    time for a job that should be done more quickly, I am even more annoyed if I take
    more time and the result still sucks. I worry that sometimes jobs I would like
    to (and need to) be giving more attention to suffer because of other more pressing
    (but ultimately less important) jobs that monopolise time. \r\n\r\nMy employer
    probably mostly emphasises time = money and likes to see things done efficiently
    but she also appreciates that good design/typesetting/editing takes time and is
    not overbearing about the former but gently (thank God) reminding of my real world

    usually matches my own tastes.\r\nhope this helps\r\n\r\n--N"

    I'm not working on contract; I'm unionized and permanent. \"Measuring excellence\"
    is part of the university's new 5 year plan.\r\n\r\nFor sure the measurements
    can't be like those for data entry, which is precisely why I was having difficulty.
    However, I quite appreciate my supervisor's point: if I don't provide the guidelines
    by which to assess my success, someone else will, and it may be along the lines
    of x number of mistakes gets me canned. \r\n\r\nI've included below what I came
    up with. Thanks for the input, and of course, I'd be happy to hear comments...
    I have a feeling this will be a work in progress. \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nK.\r\n\r\nMeasuring
    my success\r\n\r\nOn message\r\nDo I edit and design with an eye to clarity, accuracy
    and unity of message? Are my designs consistent with University branding and visually
    compelling for the target audience? \r\n\r\nAre my designs clear and readable?
    Do they contribute to or hinder the reader\u2019s ability to find answers and
    information? Does the publication\u2019s design/language fit its intended purpose?\r\n\r\nAre
    my writing, editing and designs up to the standard of excellence the University
    wishes to project?\r\n\r\nAccuracy\r\nDo my publications contain errors and typos?
    How many? What (if any) impact do my errors have, financially or otherwise? Have
    I done my best to ensure accuracy? \r\n\r\nAdaptability and responsiveness\r\nAm
    I flexible and able to adapt to new/changing technology, methods, and target audiences
    as required, and within reason? Do I set reasonable limits?\r\n\r\nDo I use creativity
    in solving problems? \r\n\r\nDo I strive to improve? Do I improve? Does my work
    address/correct issues raised with previous publications? Do I correct my mistakes
    and take steps to ensure similar errors do not recur?\r\n\r\nOverall contribution\r\nHow
    am I to work with? Am I flexible (again, within reason) with regards to work schedules
    and tasks? Do I assist the team or do I hinder? Do I set necessary limits? Do
    I contribute to the unit\u2019s success?\r\n\r\n\r\nMeasurement tools (Keeping
    in mind that opinions will vary.)\r\n\r\n1-End user surveys: recruiters, students,
    counsellors, graduates, applicants, professors, etc...\r\n\r\n2-Feedback from
    telephone services, or other front-line services about ease of use, clarity or
    other questions and comments resulting from the publication\u2019s language/presentation.\r\n\r\n3-Casual
    feedback from other areas. \r\n\r\n4-Feedback from peer competition events. (I
    believe K. was submitting the faculty booklets in an award competition of some
    kind. This kind of response can tell us how we measure up against our peers, whether
    others in the industry think we\u2019re doing a good job or not.)\r\n\r\n5-Self
    and peer evaluations.\r\n\r\n6-Checking admission statistics against the unit\u2019s
    target areas for adjustments to be made in the future. (What has or has not had
    an impact, where do we direct our efforts?)\r\n"

  body: "Might be a little verbose -- I'd be tempted to turn \"contribute to or hinder\"
    into simply \"contribute to\" -- but certainly a good start.\r\n\r\nThe \"Are
    my writing, editing and designs up to the standard of excellence the University
    wishes to project?\" makes me a little nervous, though: if there's an extensive
    style manual that is rigourously adhered to, fine, but if there isn't, it become
    a pretty amorphous concept.\r\n\r\nI'd also want to see something in there that
    also mentions cost-effectiveness: for example, you find a way to do a great piece
    by creatively imposing it to print one side one colour and the second side four,
    instead of both sides four, and save a ton of money in the process.  Doesn't hurt
    to qualify being able to improve the bottom line.\r\n\r\nAs someone once remarked
    to me, \"The person wanting this job done will want you to do it fast, right,
    and cheap.  Always tell them they can only have two.\"  Might as well get credit
    if you can get close to three....  ;-)\r\n\r\nFWIW, I don't envy you having to
    do this: I know it's the backlash from Enron, but trying to wring \"accountability\"
    from intellectual and creative processes seems to frequently result in a lot of
    BS.  That's not to say that there shouldn't be some way to objectively measure
    the difference between two employees, but all this palaver about \"excellence\"
    simply strikes me as the latest management fad proposed by someone else with a
    book to flog.  \r\n\r\nAnyone else remember TQM?\r\n\r\nLinda"

    you're right about including something to do with costs. Even though I won't be
    designing anything in colour, keeping the page count down and still maintaining
    readability and appeal is good.\r\n\r\nFunny, my editing prof said something similar

    yes, it's difficult to translate \"customers like my work\" into a dollar value
    for our next budget. It comes down to the work we do justifying the budget we
    receive (or poverty thereof). I'd like to think (but would probably be dreaming)
    that if we demonstrate clearly enough that we do have an impact on all those good
    things like enrolment, we would get more money to play with. \r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks

    is entirely correct: measuring success depends entirely upon setting goals and
    achieving them. Goals, according to standard MBA-buzzword-BS criteria, must be...\r\n<ul><li>\r\nspecific;</li>\r\n<li>measurable;
    and</li>\r\n<li>attainable.</li></ul>\r\nEach project is different; each project
    has different goals. Ideally, the person who hands you the project should draw
    up his or her OWN list of goals, and your success should be measured against how
    well you do or don't achieve THOSE goals. If you don't have a clear idea of what
    you're supposed to accomplish in the first place, you shouldn't be held accountable
    if the end product doesn't meet (or <em>exceed</em>, to continue the buzzword-BS
    argument) the requisitioner's expectations.\r\n\r\nOf course, this approach requires
    extra work from the people who want work from you, and it requires that their
    goals meet the criteria listed above. Chances are, even if you were to institute
    this regimen, you would have a difficult time getting complete, accurate and realistic
    information from your internal clients...which is why I said, at first, that it
    sounds like MBA-buzzword-BS to me...lofty, commendable, proactive, but basically
    marketing hype, and nothing else.\r\n\r\n"
