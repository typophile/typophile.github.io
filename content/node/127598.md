  body: 'After browsing through some fonts the lettering seems more or less like a
    spinoff of Garamond Italic with a heavy stylistic change. Letters a and k are
    the most distinguishable. Downstroke of k is thinning, and the letter "a" alnost
    looks as it had an inflection point at the top of the curve. '
