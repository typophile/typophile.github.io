body: "Hello, \r\nI'm currently designing a photography magazine geared towards women.
  I'm trying to finalize the typeface I'll use for the body copy and I'm looking for
  some advice before I commit to anything. Right now I have the copy set in Cochin
  8.5pt. I'm set on using a serif and I love the look of this, but I'm a little concerned
  with the readability. I'm not averse to spending some money on a quality font that
  can be used throughout the magazine, I like the look of Mercury and even Sentinel
  (H&FJ), but wanted to get some opinions before I purchase anything.\r\n\r\nAs always,
  thanks for the help!\r\nSarah"

  body: 'The slight squareness of the new <a href=http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/IbisText/>Ibis
    Text</a> might complement the photographic subject well. It''s also surprisingly
    comfortable with being elegant or even feminine, especially in the italics. '

  body: Cochin has huge capital letters and a small x-height, making it less than
    optimal for body copy.

  body: "That's what I was thinking about Cochin. I do like Ibis Text but I don't
    think it's right for this project.\r\n\r\nThe copy looks good in Caslon, so readable,
    but I think I just want something a little different. What do you think about
    Sentinel? Maybe I'm just looking for an excuse to get it, I've been admiring it
    for awhile..."

  body: Sentinel didn't work for me, caps were too wide and distracting. In fact,
    the whole design is rather wide. I couldn't fit enough characters per line. Make
    sure you get HFJ to send you a PDF sample if you're serious since you have to
    buy the whole family.

  body: Starbucks uses Sentinel on much of its collateral - so if you want to see
    it in use go for a java. They couple it with some nice sans serifs. Caecilia is
    a nice slab serif similar. Coupled with newjunebook?
