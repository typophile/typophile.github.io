  body: Thank you very much! So you think there is really no font where these letters
    (W and A) are already integrated?

  body: "I think that if such a font existed, the similarity to Avant Garde will be
    so great that it should be considered a clone.\r\nI checked also the alternative
    characters in both Av.G. Bold / Av.G. Bold Italic and there is no /A or /W like
    that, so I assume the designer has modified the Av.G. Bold.\r\n"

  body: Thanks Ryuk, I had a different setting (on Myfonts) when I inspected the alternates
    of Avant-Garde and wasn't able to see them ;)

  body: Actually, I noticed the same on various MF glyphs pages I visited today. 'No
    sample available'. Then I switched the 'Display mode' from 'Smart-sorted graphic'
    to 'Straight glyph dump' and shazam! Glyphs were back!

  body: W and A are indeed alternate characters in AvantGarde - can be found with
    glyph palette in InDesign, CharacterViewer in Mac etc.
