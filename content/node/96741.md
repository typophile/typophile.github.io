body: Any information on this would be brilliant. As far as I am aware it is from
  the cover of a book about Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, published within or shortly after
  the active period of the artist (the early part of the last century). Everyone is
  charmed by the A. If this is a full alphabet it would be fantastic to see a complete
  sample as I am hoping to redraw for a client. Many thanks.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gaudier_brzeska_ezra_pound_4033.jpg]

    from this sample.  Especially if you only need caps and no punctuation.\r\n"

  body: "Thanks all.\r\n\r\nI started drawing this earlier. It is very simple in proportion.
    I am trying to settle on the weight, which varies with the impression of each
    name. I quite like how things have softened up as well - filed corners?\r\n\r\nHrant,
    sounds interesting, care to expand?"

  body: "There is the <strong>main Type ID board</strong>, where you post ID requests:\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/typeid\r\n\r\nWhen
    an ID is solved, a moderator moves it to the <strong>Solved boards</strong>:\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/typeid/solved\r\n\r\nSometimes,
    people accidentally post there requests on the Solved boards instead of the main
    Type ID board. It\u2019s actually a very common mistake. Especially for new users.
    When someone is looking to identify a typeface for someone they go to the main
    ID board to review posts. They do not go to the Solved boards. If you post a request
    on the Solved board, it is unlikely that anyone will ever see it, and you won\u2019t
    get any help.\r\n\r\nLong/short, if you want someone to identify a typeface for
    you, <strong>don\u2019t post on the Solved boards, post on the main Type ID board</strong>.\r\n\r\nDoes
    this clarify?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    are very similar - some suggestion that there was a trend for this c. 1880. Can
    anyone shed any light on this. Nick Curtis perhaps?\r\n\r\nThanks all."
