    you would understand them better to. <BR> <BR>Me gusta mucho, creo que la &#34;e&#34;
    se ve muy contaminada con el gesto terminal pero me gusta. En cuanto a la g, yo
    dejaria el ojo de abajo abierto. <BR> <BR>Me gustan mucho tu &#34;f&#34;, la ligadura
    &#34;st&#34; y &#34;tz&#34; y la &#34;j&#34;. <BR> <BR>tambien encuentro que la
    &#34;b&#34; y la &#34;d&#34; se ven contra la corriente de tu tipografia, fijate
    en como se ve la &#34;d&#34; entre las dos &#34;a&#34;. <BR> <BR>el terminal de
    abajo de la &#34;s&#34; lo har&#39;ia mas extenso. <BR> <BR>me gusta mucho tu

  body: I agree that the &#39;e&#39; is decorated too much. The &#39;e&#39; would
    look better if it were a bit simpler, like the &#39;c&#39; but with the stroke
    extended to close it.

  body: If the name Quetzalcoatl is taken, you can always call <BR>it Tezcatlipoca.
    <BR>[In Aztec mythology, Tezcatlipoca &#40;the smoking mirror&#41; <BR>was the
    cunning devil-god who, by cheating, defeated  <BR>and sent into exile the great
    and ancient Toltec god, <BR>Quetzalcoatl &#40;the plumed serpent&#41;.]

  body: 'Mauro, there are some very nice things happening in this design. A few comments:
    <BR> <BR>The g might be a little weak, but it is hard to tell without seeing it
    in the middle of a word. Certainly, it looks weak at the beginning of a word.
    <BR> <BR>The j is too heavy. <BR> <BR>As others have noted, the e is probably
    too ornate. More to the point, the flourish is actually out-of-style with the
    rest of the letters, which are very direct and gestural. <BR> <BR>The t may be
    a problem because it is so similar to the l. Try making it shorter? It looks good
    in the tz ligature, but not so good next to the l at the end of Quetzalcoatl.'

  body: 'Oh, I mistook your g for a q when I first looked at the new samples &#40;I
    wasn&#39;t reading the words, just scanning for letters: I know Wyoming isn&#39;t
    spelled with a q&#41;. So, that&#39;s a problem: your g and q are <i>much</i>
    too similar. <BR> <BR>The weight of the j is very much improved over the first
    sample you sent last month. <BR> <BR>The shortened t is definitely an improvement.
    Can we see a sample in which it appears next to l, e.g. &#39;Quetzalcoatl&#39;?'

  body: 'I would make the top part of the t even just a little bit shorter. Not too
    much, but just enough to really distinguish it from the ascender of the l very
    clearly. <BR> <BR>The g is a real problem. I don&#39;t think you can make that
    left side so weak: not along the whole length at least. Try keeping the narrowing
    on the lower right, but strengthen the stroke again as it comes through the lower
    left. The transition you probably need is similar to what you have in the c. Also,
    you might try a version with a hook descender, but without the complete loop.
    <BR> <BR>By the way, the recent change to the y is excellent: exactly what I would
    have recommended.'
