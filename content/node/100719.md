body: "Greetings!\r\n\r\nIf you have any experience using Peter Mohr's Fayon, I'd
  like to hear your comments on the face: what you liked, what you didn't, what difficulties
  you faced while implementing it, what problems it solved, what was the typographic
  colour like (too dark/too light). Also, if you could mention what kind of project
  it was implemented in, that would be most appreciated.\r\n\r\nI'm loving it so far
  for the fresh character it imparts. To my <strong>personal liking</strong>, it makes
  blocks of text a tiny bit dark, but maybe it's just me. Let's see what other users
  of Fayon have to say.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nRG"
