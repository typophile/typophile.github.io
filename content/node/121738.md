  used for the book \"The Narrow Road to the Deep North\" by Richard Flanagan. It's
  got Colophon's \"Value Sans\" type of feel, but its definitely a different typeface.\r\n\r\nHere's
  an image:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NarrowRoad_5936.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!"

  body: I must say, that's a particularly handsome spur serif. Albert Boton is an
    underrated figure in type history!
