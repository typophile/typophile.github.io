  Adobe Creative CS2 components, especially InDesign, Illustrator and Photoshop. He's
  a young web/print designer with a very basic knowledge of these powerful tools.\r\n\r\nFor
  InDesign I have no doubts: \"Real World Adobe InDesign CS2\" is the standard reference.\r\n\r\nSo
  what books should I suggest for the other two applications?\r\n\r\nMany thanks."

    for all the apps than any book. And at $20/month, it costs less than most books
    as well.

  body: "have you ever looked at the helpfiles of adobe? They are the best I've seen
    so far for computer programs, as they are very detailed and sometimes even explain
    some background knowledge (color seperation, etc.).\r\nThey definitely go further
    than explaining to somebody who already knows about it in theory, how he can achieve
    this with the specific adobe program.\r\nSo for Adobe-apps, I never needed an
    extra book so far."

  body: Is your friend interested in Photo retouching? If so I recomend "Photoshop
    Lab Color" by Dan Mergulis. I also recommend the NAPP (National Association of
    Photoshop Professionals). They have a bimonthly magazine thats okay. www.photoshopuser.com

    my friend has not a fast internet connection and the CDs are not so cheap.\r\n\r\n@sebilar:
    Adobe Help is a great resource... but many users are simply paper-addict.\r\n\r\n@Dan
    Weaver: very useful resources..."
