body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nOne of my students asked me this question last week and I did
  not quite know the answer. Maybe you can help?\r\n\r\n<cite>If I work for a company
  purely as a freelancer, do I still own the copyright for my work? Assuming the company
  paid for the freelance services, how do their rights compare to that of the freelancer?<cite>\r\n\r\nI'm
  in the UK, in case you wonder. Also, we assume that the freelancer never waived
  any of his rights in a special contract.\r\n\r\nMany, many thanks in advance.\r\n\r\nMax"

    go?\r\n\r\nAre they allowed to use the design at will and profit from it indefinitely,
    or do they actually have to ask the freelancer before they use it or even pay
    a share if his design is used for a different, much bigger job in the future?"

  body: </i>Many companies will have a freelance contract that will specify ownership
    of design and materials (files). For book publishing companies, they general buy
    all rights to the design, and require copies of all files used in the creation.

  body: "It's good to see how this works in other parts of the world.\r\n\r\nIn the
    US we use the term \"Work for Hire.\" All copyrights remain with the creator unless
    a contract, which specifically states that the work is for hire and/or the copyrights
    are to be transferred, is agreed to by both parties. "

  body: "A proper freelancer will have his own contracts and policies. If you work
    for a company without defining terms, you're probably tacitly agreeing to whatever
    they wish. The creator certainly still has copyright, but if you try to limit
    a client's usage rights after the fact, they might well want their money back.\r\n\r\nNote
    that the UK doesn't have an official copyright registry, so if you ever have to
    prove in court that you are the creator of a work, supplying the evidence is all
    up to you."

  body: "Many thanks for the replies. I guess it is really a grey area, where copyright
    is really more of a powerless sword in the client-freelancer relationship. \r\nI
    mean, what is the point of having copyright, if the client asked for his money
    back as soon as the freelancer restricts any usage?\r\n\r\nCerulean, there is
    a company in the UK who register copyright: http://www.dulyregistered.co.uk/"
