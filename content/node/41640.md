  that mean there will be six more weeks of winter boot shopping?  ;-)"

    coming. Given we have had less than .1\" of snow this winter here in the apple
    and that it's supposed to go up into the 50s and 60s later this week I'd say my
    prediction is looking good... The little rat in Pennsylvania saw his shadow, but
    come on, who ya gonna believe?\r\n\r\nChris: Low-fat food, huh. I think today
    I'll indulge.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fab_3800.jpg]\r\n\r\nand
    how nice that the French president chose to tie the knot with a supermodel on
    my special day...\r\n"
