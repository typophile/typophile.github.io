  I am designing an invitation for a gala for a museum. I just started doing some
  research, and thought this site would be a great resource to tap into. I have attached
  a link. \r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ncmaritime.org/exhibits/Knights.htm\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    Now that I think about it, this is one of the few if not the only time that you
    can get away with using Papyrus. Yeah, do it."

    length recently.

  body: "I'm brainstorming ideas for a logo for the Gala event. Words are Night of
    the Black Flag Gala. Trying to figure out how to blend rough with formal. Nights
    of the Blag Flag (Rough), Gala (pirate formal). Gambling will be a part of the
    event, legal of course. Picturing elements to use, old map to as background, boat,
    treasure chest shimmering with gold, flag of course with skull and crossed swords
    as some items to use with this piece. It will be a long piece. I'm at home, but
    I'm thinking the spec's are close to 17\"x 6 vertical with three folding panels.
    A pirate party! Attire\u2014bliack-tie okay, casual dressy, okay. Just wondering
    what aaarrrgh would look like in papyrus. Not enough meat perhaps.\r\n"

    jacket \u2013 this is exactly why I am not allowed to brainstorm.\r\n"
