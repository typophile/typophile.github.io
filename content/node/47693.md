  body: "It's hard to tell with the low resolution, but it looks like \u2206 from
    the Greek alphabet has been used to replace the \u0414 in Cyrillic Times, in imitation
    of the archaic triangular form of that letter, for a pyramid-power effect."

    -> \u0414.\u0414. \u0414a\u0431\u0438\u045B. Even the last letter is replaced
    by \u2206."

    not \u0414. \u0414. \u0414a\u0431\u0438\u045B (Dabi\u0107). I can only assume
    \u0414\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0434 was chosen because of that extra pyramid-power
    \u0434."

    website, which consists of wearing a special energy-alignment pendant around your
    neck. I suppose the intriguing question is whether Karadzi\u0107 believed this
    stuff or simply saw it as another way to manipulate and exploit the gullible."

    discoverer, tested him and he scored extremely high (over 100% whatever that may
    mean). Apparantly he is a crack at finding water and energy disturbances, and
    attained the highest rank of general after five days\u2019 training.\r\nAnd his
    neighbours loved the guy: very polite and friendly.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\nBert Vanderveen
