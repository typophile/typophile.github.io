  a typeface that I love in it's title as well as the credits seen here, but haven't
  been able to fully identify the type. The closest to date that I can find is Hawthorn,
  [[http://www.fonts.com/FindFonts/detail.htm?pid=436018]] yet it's not quite there
  if you look at the capital \"R\" and \"P\" among others, and plus the weight seems
  off. Any ideas from you pros would be super, thanks!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/81c7ea731eb3bc2d887b964e52c5de2a_5763.161434.jpeg]"

  body: ^I think Bernase is as close as you'll get. It looks exactly the same! Except
    for the /R/ as Florian menions. I prefer the Bernase /R/ anyways.

    as well as alternate a's (three of them) and an alternate 'y'. This is shown in
    the Phil's Photo \"Homage to the Alphabet\" book from 1985.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    are exactly the same as the extended film type version of ITC Bernase Roman, with
    its alternates.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    we didnt't quite nail it back then, I thought I would see if this version has
    been digitized since then. It turns out from the help of others that indeed we
    are getting the match after all these years as now solved, very cool.\r\n\r\nThanks
    to all of you. So to be clear, this is not available as a font, correct?"

    for \u2018Hell House\u2019</a>. Chances are a certain question came up before.\r\nYes,
    I agree it paid off that you posted this a second time.\r\nNo, as far as I know,
    ITC Bernase is not available as digital font.\r\n"

  body: "Actually, ITC Bernase was digitized in the old Image Club Letterpress collections
    from the mid-1990's (which I have). However, the sample in the catalog from that
    collection does not show the alternate letters, so the G has a higher chin, the
    R doesn't have the tapered leg, and the 'a' is single storey. I will open the
    font to see if the alternates are included at all, and report back to you.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Here is pretty much the entire glyph set. You can see that none of the alternates
    were included. Too bad, but maybe Hawthorn or Romana letters could be substituted.(Notice
    the oe glyph seems to have no kerning offset). Grant Hutchinson said there were
    many fonts they dropped as not being up to modern standards. This apparently was
    one of them.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BernaseRomICGSample_3905.gif]"
