  body: Bringhurst is referring to such work as the Vox system. Catherine Dixon gave
    a very good talk about it at St Bride in 2002. <a href="http://www.stbride.org/friends/conference/twentiethcenturygraphiccommunication/TypefaceClassification.html">Typeface

  body: "<em>The Panose system describes fonts with numbers. Whether it makes it more
    scientific is arguable.</em>\r\n\r\nThe purpose of Panose is to map similarities
    of weight, width and other proportions, along with some stylistic details, between
    different fonts. Insofar as it does this based upon precise measurement of these
    features, calculation of proportional ratios, etc. it is objective and methodical
    (i.e. what people tend to call 'scientific'). Of course, the goal of Panose was
    font matching and substitution: a way of coming up with the 'best fit' font if
    the original font in a document were missing. So it works -- assuming font developers
    accurately recorded the Panose data, which most did <em>not</em> -- within that
    conceptual and practical framework. It isn't a classification system per se, and
    the numbers won't necessarily tell you what you want to know about a typeface,
    but it should tell you what other types are similar in certain ways.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,
    like most type description or classification schemes, it breaks down completely
    beyond the Latin script."

  body: "There are some expectations about type classification which assume that a
    scientific method would produce accurate identification of type specimens.\r\n\r\nBut
    the distinction must be made between classification and identification, and between
    typographic images and fonts.\r\n\r\nTrying to identify a typeface from a specimen
    of a few letters, using a classification system, won't get you very far without
    expert knowledge. But the same could be said for trying to identify an animal
    from its tracks--there's a lot of missing information."

  body: "It seems the the moment you have a classification system is the moment the
    arguments begin as to what fits where. There are always faces that don't fit the
    scheme exactly and the time and energy it takes to agree to disagree on which
    pigeon hole to select far outweighs the value of the system. This hardly seems
    scientific to me but I am not a scientist. As long as we don't take the persuit
    too seriously, there is some basic value in general categorization just for the
    sake of description. If you have the argumentative mindset, you might like dueling
    intellectual arguments over categories but you really have to enjoy that sort
    of thing.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    might be worth pondering in relation to type. Here's an interesting article: [[http://www.shirky.com/writings/ontology_overrated.html|Ontology
    is Overrated]]\r\nShirky's observation about the Balkans and Asia made me think
    of Vox's categories of Garaldes and sans-serifs. Seems like Shirky identifies
    some of the same types of pitfalls that Dixon did. But following his lead in envisioning
    a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folksonomy|folksonomy]] of type looks like a
    very different kind of solution than Dixon seems to be proposing. (The link to
    the pdf with more details in the Dixon article seems to be broken, so I'm a bit
    mystified about what her solution actually is)"

  body: "Back at the top...\"Rigorously scientific descriptions and classifications
    of typefaces are certainly possible...\" says RB, but if one asks for a rigorous
    scientific description and classification of <em>a</em> typeface...what would
    that be? The periodic table of typographic elements, <em>Elements of a Type's
    Style</em> has not yet been written, and even it was, without it's companion volumes,
    <em>Elements of a Type's Use</em>, and <em>Elements of a Type's Output</em>, what
    do you know?\r\n\r\nPanose, e.g. asketh, and I slightly paraphrase: What number
    (from 0 to 9) would best describe the X-height, (i.e. the relative height of lowercase
    characters, presumably to the uppercase;) <em>and</em> the treatment of uppercase
    glyphs with diacritical marks. That's one number, like it's a toothbrush <em>and</em>
    a stun gun. John Hudson points out that Panose breaks down \"completely\" beyond
    the Latin script. It breaks down partially before it finishes the Latin type circa
    1994...and in classification theory, partial breakdown and complete breakdown
    can be hard to distinguish, I think.\r\n\r\nDez says, \"It seems the moment you
    have a classification system [...] the arguments begin as to what fits where.\"\r\nMy
    experience is quite different. Conflicts occur naturally in the formation of classification
    systems that, by the nature of what they are trying to classify, cannot be complete
    or fully described, variety in the characters themselves making rigorous scientific
    description impossible. Nevertheless, once the system is completely argued out
    \u2014 what fits where, is over, the arguing stops, and the ignoring begins. ;)\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n"

  body: "Type varies across numerous distinguishable dimensions. The most important
    of these are contrast and construction. These alone make classification possible
    and useful. If you are insensitive or not attuned to types of contrast or to patterns
    of construction you loose your grip on form and your sense of where to go. The
    effort to categorize alone can be enriching, because it forces attention to distinguishable
    dimensions. So this has a pedagogical benefit. Without it the 'kinship domain'
    of type is almost unsurveyable, and it becomes difficult to get yourself oriented
    or locate oneself within it. \r\n\r\nThe danger is that a scheme that codes for
    too-few dimensions or gives pre-eminence to subordinate dimensions blinds one
    to the relevance of important others.\r\n\r\nClassification or filling-in a niche
    is not a destination, just a servicable and sometimes fertile strategy or heuristic. "
