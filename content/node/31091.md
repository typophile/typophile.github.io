body: "Hi There!\r\nI am searching for this font. Look like some kind of OCR Font.
  Like a mixture of OCR-A and OCR-B. OCA-A because of the round edges on some characters.
  OCR-B because of it's \xBBnormal\xAB character-forms. Maybe a custom-made Mix?\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas? Thanks in Advance,\r\nJuergen"

  body: It appears to be patterned after old Leroy template lettering. There are a
    couple digital versions that I am aware of but, unfortunately, they simulate a
    somewhat shaky hand using the template, and are not as clean as the sample shown.
