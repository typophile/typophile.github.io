  our search for this condensed typeface. It very close to Suomi Type Foundries 'Titillation.'
  However, there are a few notable differences: being the 'R' and 'S' There's also
  a noticeable difference in the narrowness.\r\n\r\nBig thanks in advance.\r\n\r\nF//W\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Tokyo_3553.jpg]"
