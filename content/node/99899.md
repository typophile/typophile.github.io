  Dubai, majoring in graphic design. However I have a strong liking towards type design
  and I was wondering if anyone could recommend good type design firms to intern at.
  \r\n\r\nI was and still am working on a typeface that I created for my senior project.
  \r\n\r\nThe typeface that I am working on is based on the Devanagri script however
  is an adaptation to the latin typeface futura. I have worked independently on the
  typeface teaching myself how letterforms work. I was determine to get my basics
  right and therefore flew out to India for 5 days where an Indian type designer (
  Prof. Mahendra Patel)  guided me as I had no faculty member on campus or in Dubai
  to help me understand the script and build my sensitivity towards letterforms. \r\n\r\nI
  want to make my typeface part of reality. I need a lot more experience and if I
  get the chance to be exposed to the felid will help me develop my skill a lot more.
  \r\n\r\n As of now this is my most important project and it is based on type design
  and it is one field I want to pursue.  \r\n\r\nI have attached an image of what
  my typeface looks like. \r\n\r\nI graduate in May and just gaining some experience
  in the world of type would be a great opportunity for me. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen

    actually being serious - it's clear you're dedicated to type design, plus it seems
    you've nicely resisted the urge to make a highly Latinized typeface (a big temptation
    when dealing with something like Futura).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I'm going to second Hrant's suggestion that a more formal education setting
    will benefit you more than an internship, and the MA at Reading would be your
    best option in terms of the Indic expertise of faculty members and the extensive
    non-Latin archive. You might also look into their two-week Type Design Intensive
    summer programme as a taster.\r\n\r\nWith regard to your Devanagari design, I
    think it displays a number of problems with letter proportions and weight displacements.
    While you would likely learn some things about curve quality and technical processes
    in an internship, you'd be unlikely to get training of specific relevance to Devanagari."

    body: "Hi John \r\n\r\nThank for the reply =) \r\n\r\nI know im mile stones away
      from perfection however if i got so far all by myself I feel like I have it
      in me to do this right. Im aware that my the script is heavy and does look off.
      I am fixing it again. \r\n\r\nWill definitely take a look at the the summer
      courses available at Reading. But im not only looking at Devanagri only I want
      to learn about both. Maybe some sort of bi-lingual course. Im still pretty confused
      as what different aspects are there in type design.  Thats why Im so into getting
      an internship. \r\n\r\nHowever thank you for the reply was helpful =) "

  body: "Oh boy. Can't ignore a direct question...\r\n\r\nI think the most gracious
    way I can put it is this: if you want to quickly become qualified to make fonts
    in their style then the KABK program seems to work like magic. It's just that
    to me personally that sort of goal in life seems too formulaic; if you're young
    and influentiable you might never be able to get out of that groove... I prefer
    a more ideologically \"errant\" educational style, one that doesn't assume one
    year is enough. That style seems to be present at Reading - I regularly hear how
    the teachers try very hard not to direct the students <em>too</em> much, and you
    can see it in the eclectic set of fonts that come out of their program. I guess
    I value the process more than the results, because to me a <em>student</em> is
    supposed to have new worlds opened up for him, as opposed to merely making nice
    things. Another thing I value is non-Latin design, and KABK is pretty weak in
    that area, at least compared to Reading.\r\n\r\nCaveat: Except for a guest lecture
    I gave at Reading last year my only real exposure to their program or the one
    at KABK has been through observation of the resultant fonts, but also many years
    of discussion with their respective teachers and students.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    body: "Hi hhp \r\n\r\nThank you so much for the reply. Was definitely not zoning
      out a MA in type design. I just wanted to experience the field for a bit as
      I graduate in May. My professor did suggest Reading and KABK.  Not sure as to
      which one to apply to. However I was told that KABK was more hands on than Reading.
      As in Reading is much more theory based. \r\n\r\nI feel jumping straight into
      my masters straight after undergrad is a bit. I could be wrong cause I've been
      told its always better to get some sort of exposure before you go ahead with
      your masters. \r\n\r\nI really appreciate the help ! =) "
