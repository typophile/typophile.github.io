body: Sorry if this has popped up in the list before, but I couldn&#39;t find it in
  the archives. Does anyone know a place where to see the &#39;catch me if you can&#39;
  title sequence in quicktime format? I&#39;d love to see it over and over again.
  The Nexus boys &#40;<a href="http://www.nexuslondon.com/main.html" target="_blank">http://www.nexuslondon.com/main.html</a>&#41;
  created the brilliant sequence that has a definite Saul Bass ring to it without
  being a rip off. On their site it has been embedded in the whole flash design and
  besides it&#39;s very small. It deserves more than that!
