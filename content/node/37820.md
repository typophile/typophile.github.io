  body: I seem to recall seeing something similar (if not identical) in the 70s, but
    not since...which simply means I haven't seen a digital version (one might well
    exist). I have the feeling the typeface was designed for use as decorative initials,
    and not for the use illustrated in your link. Still, I kinda like the idea of
    the font, if not its particular execution...

  body: "Just my 2 \xF6re, but this gotta be available digitally somewhere (my bet
    is on a cheapish PC font collection/Corel Draw...) as I have simply seen too many
    hairdressers/beauticians abuse it for vinyl lettering. "

    somewhere, a light googling didn't bring any obvious results."

  body: "I received an e-mail about this typeface today, showing a different photo
    of the same lettering, and wondered if anyone, particularly Mike F., or Angel,
    \ might know of a digital version by another name? I have seen this in Rookledge,
    but can't recall if I have ever seen it on the web.\r\n\r\nThe person who wrote
    to me said he saw it in an old Spanish Mecanorma catalog, but it was an incomplete
    showing.\r\n\r\nThanks for any help.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
