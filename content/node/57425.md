  post...\r\n\r\nI've just designed a logo for a company and I'm putting together
  a CD with all different versions they may need - is there anything I'm missing from
  this list;\r\n\r\n- CMYK logo: colour and mono (inverted versions in both)\r\n-
  RGB logo: colour and mono (inverted versions in both)\r\n- jpegs, eps'\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!"

  body: Because you're providing rasterized formats, it might be a good idea to provide
    the logo in a range of specific sizes.

    white space measure uses the little squares as a measure for white space. It is
    so cool. No complex calculations. Writing a standards manual can get complicated
    real quite. Basic usage guidelines are good, but don't create a standards manual
    unless you charged for it.\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n[[http://www.thefontry.com|<em>...from

  body: "Wow, thanks for all your responses, and quality ones at that! I never thought
    to include PMS specs, to be honest, I never use them, but I will include. Which
    'book' do you refer to? I imagine Pantone process uncoated is standard?\r\n\r\nI
    will convert text to outlines, but how do you convert strokes to objects? I've
    always wondered how to avoid scaling stroke issues, but didnt know there was a
    successful solution. And thanks for reminding me to include versions without shading!\r\n\r\nAs
    for providing rasterised version, I thought EPS' were vector based? Maybe not.
    Is it best then to include the vectored logo as a pdf? Good point on providing
    rasterized logos at different sizes.\r\n\r\nAs for providing any guidelines, I
    didn't plan on doing anything too lengthy because the client isn't matching my
    original quote for the job so I don't intend to bend over backwards for them.
    I was going to include basic colour, font, information, etc...\r\n\r\nThanks again
    for your replies! I feel like I've learnt a lot in the space of a few minutes!

    the file names/formats so the user can understand: "logoc.tif" would be color,

    how to use/not use the logo.'

  body: "PMS uncoated for print media (generally) and PMS coated for signs, banners,
    vehicle graphics, etc. \r\n\r\nIn the sign industry, even though 4 color printing
    is reliable, you might always be faced with a situation which calls for routed
    letters, or graphics that must be cut on the plotter. Routers and plotters only
    see vectors.\r\n\r\n<em>I thought EPS\u2019 were vector based? </em>\r\n\r\nAn
    eps file can have embedded bitmaps. And, since your logo may have to cross platforms,
    sometimes fountain fills are converted to ugly bitmaps in some software conversions.\r\n\r\n<em>Is
    it best then to include the vectored logo as a pdf?</em>\r\n\r\nPDFs cross platforms
    and software boundries best with the least problems.\r\n\r\n<em>...but how do
    you convert strokes to objects?</em>\r\n\r\nThat depends on your software. Illustrator
    has a feature under path, I think, outline stroke.\r\n\r\nI also can't stress
    enough, test all formats and make everything backwards compatible. Not everyone
    has the software budget they would like to have. Some of us would like to have
    a software budget.\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n[[http://www.thefontry.com|<em>...from

  body: "Re: usage guidelines; yes, I did mean something brief. Having been on the
    receiving end of corporate standards manuals in the past, the bigger and more
    detailed they are, the less likely they are to be followed. A one- or two-page
    list of basic dos and don'ts should suffice. \r\n\r\nIf you do want to specify
    a minimum amount of space round the logo, it may be worth&shy;while actually including
    that space in the files you create, so that any awkward so-and-so who wants to
    break the guidelines will have to resort to a \"sin of commission\" (intentionally
    cropping the image) rather than the merely ignorant \"sin of omission\" (just
    sticking another logo or some text right next to  it).\r\n_______________________________________________\r\nEver
