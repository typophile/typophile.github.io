body: "It's been more than a year since I introduced myself to this forum, so I must
  say again that I'm not a font designer, but a programmer that is interested in fonts,
  more specifically in open type fonts. I've been playing with the  arial.ttf font
  in the last few days, and by parsing the file I was surprised with some apparent
  inconsistencies, as I summarized in the attached file.\r\n\r\nThe figure on this
  file is very simple. They represent just a small number (3) of the  ligatures substitutions
  extant in the \"ccmp\" feature, for default language system, for the \"arab\" script,
  on the font arial.ttf .\r\n\r\nThe hexadecimal numbers on the right are glyph ID's
  associated with the Unicode numbers for each glyph on the left. The leftmost glyph
  is the one that should replace the two on the right.\r\n\r\nThe problem that I see
  with these ligatures is that, when I type them in MS Word, nothing happens, i.e.,
  no replacement can be seen for the two glyphs, with the one on the left.\r\n\r\nI
  also would appreciate to learn how to insert a figure in this box, for I tried hard
  to no avail.\r\n\r\nThanks for your patience.\r\n"

    ligature support for Arabic script in Windows apps is entirely independent of
    the kind of ligature support you refer to in Word 2010, which was the first version
    of Word to support ligatures for Latin script. Arabic ligatures support is provided
    directly by the Uniscribe Arabic shaping engine, and has been available to Windows
    apps for many, many years.]"

  body: "This demonstrates the correct formation of the ligatures for the combination
    of shadda (the above, w-like sign) and the below vowels that, when in sequence
    with shadda form ligatures above the letter. They are the best illustration of
    ligature formation, because when not ligated with shadda the vowels sit underneath
    the letters, so the difference between ligation and non-ligation is really obvious.
    The second, left-most example illustrates the middle of the three mark ligations
    in your original illustration: U+0651 U+064D (the marks can be entered in either
    order).\r\n\r\nI believe the reason you were not seeing the ligatures forming
    in your own test is that you had failed to enter a letter before the marks. What
    you are seeing as a result is a sequence with dotted circle inserted, which the
    Uniscribe shaping engine is applying because it detects what it considers a script-level
    error, i.e. an Arabic mark without a preceding letter."

      insight. It's been a great help for me, since I'm just a beginner in this matter.\r\n\r\nIf
      I understood you correctly, the marks U0651 U064C didn't work as they should
      because another letter was missing before them. I went back to Word and insert

      I must point out that all Ligature Substitutions in the arial.ttf font file,
      for the 'ccmp' feature in the 'arab' script replace 2 mark glyphs, by another
      glyph (which also seems to be a mark glyph, as shown on the attached file)."

  body: Glyphs are categorised in the font GDEF table. Glyphs need to be classified
    as marks in order to be positioned with GPOS anchor attachments, and can then
    be processed or skipped in other lookups. So, for example, marks may be skipped
    in letter ligation lookups. [It is possible to skip all marks, or to skip a particular
    collection of marks, although for compatibility with current software this requires
    the collections to be mutually exclusive.] Ligatures are also classified as such
    in the GDEF table, and are assigned a number of 'components' equal to the number
    of underlying characters. GPOS mark attachment can then be assigned per component
    so one can associate combining marks with letters within a ligature and position
    them correctly. [This runs into problems if a single ligature may represent variable
    numbers of underlying characters, but that doesn't occur in real world situations
    very often.]

    body: "John Hudson\r\n\r\nThis was great. A lot of information in just one paragraph.
      I'm really thankful for your help.\r\n\r\nBut I'm still pondering about my original
      question. There's no doubt in my mind (you just proved it) that my Word is working
      correctly. Why then, the substitutions shown on the figure attached are not
      taking place, specially after we consider the fact that these substitutions
      are prescribed by the <strong>very first lookup</strong> in the font Lookup
      List Table ?\r\n\r\nI have one hypothesis and I ask for your judgement on this
      :\r\n\r\n1) As I said before, all the substitutions we're talking about come
      from the 'ccmp' feature which refers to a lookup table, which is the first one,
      to be applied, on the font.\r\n\r\n2) The OpenType client, in this case MS Word,
      has the option of not using a specific feature, as stated [[http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/chapter2.htm|here]]
      under <strong>Features and Lookups</strong> : <cite>Features define the functionality
      of an OpenType Layout font and they are named to convey meaning to the text-processing
      client. Consider a feature named \u201Cliga\u201D to create ligatures. Because
      of its name, the client knows what the feature does and can decide whether to
      apply it.</cite>\r\n\r\n3) So my hypothesis is that MS Word is not applying
      the feature 'ccmp' for the 'arab' script with its default language, for some
      unknown reason. Maybe they had to change the order of the lookups in a new version
      of the font, and had to abandon this feature. But they had to keep it in the
      font file, in order to maintain its validation for old users, which I believe
      is the unique purpose of the 'sfnt' file format.\r\n\r\n4) To test this hypothesis
      I'll have to study all the other features in the font and see how they behave.
      The problem is that I'm doing this \"by hand\", which means, I'm parsing the
      file manually, by looking at its contents with a binary editor. And this is
      very time consuming and boring, as you can imagine. \r\n\r\n5)Do you know of
      any software that could show me these OpenType font tables in a straightforward
      manner ?\r\n\r\nAgain, I thank you in advance, for your priceless help.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "What is happening in your original test is that the Uniscribe shaping engine
    is intervening in a way that breaks the glyph input string for the ccmp lookups
    because it considers the text string to be invalid because the marks are not preceded
    by a letter.\r\n\r\nThe dotted circle that you see is not part of the mark glyph
    in the font, it is dynamically inserted by Uniscribe as a generic base for combining
    marks that do not have a valid base before them. In this case Uniscribe is treating
    each mark in a sequence not preceded by a letter as invalid, not just the first
    mark in the sequence. So what you end up with in the glyph string (logical order)
    is\r\n\r\n<code>| dotted circle | mark 1 | dotted circle | mark 2 |</code>\r\n\r\nSo
    the ccmp ligation of the two marks is not occurring because there is a dotted
    circle glyph between them in the glyph string.\r\n\r\nIn effect, Uniscribe is
    performing a kind of spellchecking, and inserting the dotted circle to provide
    visual indication that it thinks there is something wrong with the text. Don't
    get me started on how stupid it is to perform spellchecking operations at a script
    shaping level, but that's what Microsoft do.\r\n\r\n<em>5)Do you know of any software
    that could show me these OpenType font tables in a straightforward manner ?</em>\r\n\r\nDTL
    OTMaster would be my tool of choice. I'm not sure whether the free, 'Light' version
