  body: "Don't know what to answer exactly to your request because, part of this spurless
    /a, the rest looks very generic and neutral. You could even start with Myriad
    or Frutiger. [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/abadi-mt/|Abadi]] is also used
    for their corporate identity.\r\nHere is a list of sans with spurless /a compiled
    by the great team at Typecache: http://typecache.com/font-clusters/04/\r\nI like
    from their list: [[http://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/karbon/|Karbon]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/preusstype/phoenica/|Phoenica]]\r\n"
