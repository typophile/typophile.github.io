    some words. :)

  body: "Yes, some words would be nice. :]\r\n\r\nJust looking at the alphabet though,
    some things do stand out to me.\r\n\r\n- /v/ and /u/ may need more differentiation\r\n-
    the strokes could remain thin when curves meet stems (for example, in /h/)\r\n-
    it kind of feels as though /s/ ought to have those big ball terminals...\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    I'd hardly call myself even at the level of novice, so take my words with a grain
    of salt!"

  body: The short t is unusual but it may work. One thing you could try is to make
    the crossbar longer, to give the letter more presence since it's so small.

    \"sitting\" too."
