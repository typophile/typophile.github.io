  as the axis.

  body: Here is a <a href="http://betatype.com/aloe/aloe.pdf">pdf</a>. Does anyone
    else get server time-outs every time they try to post an image?

  body: I think the &#34;full serif&#34; version is wonderful. But the sans is mundane,
    and the &#34;stubby serif&#34; cut isn&#39;t working at all it seems... :-&#40;  I
    think interpolating serifs <i>can</i> work &#40;look at Penumbra&#41;, but it
    might be easier with flaring &#40;as opposed to stubby&#41; serifs. <BR> <BR>I
    love the angled serif cuts in the &#34;full serif&#34; version! It seems that
    they&#39;re helping avoid that dreaded &#34;backslant syndrome&#34; that fully
    upright half-serif designs have - nothing short of a small breakthrough on your
    part. And the caps are really singing. It&#39;s like a butch Avance. <BR> <BR>&#40;More
    soon...&#41; <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: 'OK, some concrete suggestions for the &#34;full serif&#34; cut: <BR> <BR>Overall:
    <BR>Shorten descenders. <BR>Caps slightly too dark. <BR>Work on spacing. <BR>Make
    a Black weight. <BR> <BR>lc: <BR>a: too wide. <BR>b: Make the spur the delicate
    kind. <BR>f: longer foot serif; shift bar right; smoothen ascender. <BR>g: narrower
    head; stronger ear; I don&#39;t get that trap. <BR>k: not sure about that upkick
    thing. <BR>o: too dark. <BR>q: give it a delicate ear. <BR>r: longer foot serif.
    <BR>t: shift bar right. <BR> <BR>UC: <BR>A: a bit too wide; left diagonal too
    dark. <BR>D: make wider. <BR>G: needs work. <BR>J: needs work. <BR>L: too wide.
    <BR>Q: I don&#39;t get that trap. <BR>S: a bit too wide. <BR>X: too wide. <BR>
    <BR>numerals: the 4 looks wrong. <BR> <BR>Keep it up! <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: 'In your bold serif version: W is too dark, DEFL are a bit too dark, OQT are
    a bit too light. <BR> <BR>The light weights are fine, except for the wide S.'

  body: your font its incredible, but i really think you have to try to draw better.
    <BR>your curves are broken and dirty. The geometry dont lie when say us where
    you have to put the vector points. <BR> <BR>but your face with a fine draw can
    be a excellent font
