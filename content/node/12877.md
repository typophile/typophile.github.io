body: "Hello there, this is my first post.\r\n\r\nMy scan is from a German Cookbook
  (Die K\xFCche Indonesiens).\r\nIt's set in two characteristic fonts (two, I believe)
  that play together very well (and with the theme \"Indonesia\", also) and look simply
  gorgeous.\r\nCan you help me?\r\n\r\nBy the way, I am one of the \"lurkers\" Hrant
  has addressed recently.\r\nIt's not that I feel I was lurking around the Typophile
  boards, it's more like I'm interested in typography, not professionally though,
  and the best place to learn something is where the \"professionals\" discuss, ie
  here. An amateur like me isn't exactly capable of establishing a well-founded point
  in your highly sophisticated discussions, that's why I'm not participating.\r\nBut
  I do enjoy reading them very much. Thanks."

  body: As a matter of fact, the Type ID Board is a perfect jumping-on point, as the
    discussions here are often light-hearted and entry-level. Once you feel at ease,
    you can consider moving up to General Discussions, maybe by starting off with
    a question you might have. I can guarantee you it will be a lot more interesting
    and rewarding once you start participating.

    body: "Thank you for your replies.\r\n\r\nAnd I'd love to find out about that
      other font, too.\r\nIt's an interesting font, with lots of detail and quite
      a few peculiarities (my scan is bad, the print looks very nice).\r\n\r\nI must
      say, I do like it and I think as a font for an Indonesian Cookbook it's a perfect
      fit! Plus it goes well with the Veljovic body text.\r\n\r\nI've uploaded another
      scan. Ideas?\r\n\r\nPS. Is it not possible to upload images in new comments?"

    something [[Rudolf Koch]]-esque."
