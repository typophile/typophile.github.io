  at signs when i'm out, i take pics of as many as i can. i often don't see what the
  product or message is in ads as i just notice the letters...\r\n\r\ni love type
  specimen books. i can and will talk fonts and/or design for hours. \r\n\r\nso basically,
  while this would be fine if i was with a bunch of like-minded people, it's caused
  some strain on my relationship.\r\n\r\nmy girl has stuck with me for a year so far,
  and most of the time she's a good sport about it, but sometimes my passion for type
  just gets too much for her.\r\n\r\nso basically i'm asking, has anyone else had
  this or simialr issues with their significant other just not being into type?\r\n\r\nand
  how do you deal with it?\r\n\r\nthanks!"

    my typophilia, leading to things like a Typecon vacation or me getting Superpolator
    for Christmas.

  body: heehee, don't get me wrong, my girl supports my passion, she just gets bored
    of type-talk very quickly... but as a typically obsessed type lover it's something
    i can't help but talk about... it's a pickle...

  body: "I think there is a limit to how much you can \"talk shop\" with anyone who
    does not do that activity.  It's just courtesy to know when you're starting to
    bore them, and that depends on the other person's level of interest and knowledge.
    It's not an issue peculiar to type. \r\n\r\nWhat is different about type is that
    fewer people understand the passion for it, compared to those who understand a
    passion for architecture or music. That's one of the reasons why we need Typophile!"

  body: "My husband is pretty understaning and doesn't roll his eyes too much when
    I stop to  take yet another photo of an interesting sign, he even points potential
    ones out occasionally, but I try not to go on too much. I also try not to say
    it aloud every time I recognise a font somewhere\u2026\r\nSometimes I can't help
    myself and go on about something for ages, like this shopping center in Helsinki,
    they used Coquette for their Christmas ads in 2007 and in 2008 it was a mixture
    of last years' ads and new ones set in Avant Garde Gothic (that hurt). I try to
    limit my rants, though."
