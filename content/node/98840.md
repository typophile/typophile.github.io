body: I'm looking for a script similar to Adios Script for a christmas project I'm
  working on. I'd like to set a phrase to be made into a polymer plate by boxcar press
  and then use it with a homemade letterpress. So nothing with crazy thin strokes.
  I realize 100 dollars for a typeface is not usually expensive but when you're just
  starting out it's a lot of money to be spending on a typeface for a side project.
  Can anyone suggest something similar that's more in the $10-40 range? Thank you!

  body: I don't know how close to Adios Script you want, but in terms of a very good
    script font with not too fine hairlines, I am very enthusiastic about Laura Worthington's
    <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/laura-worthington/hummingbird/">Hummingbird</a>.
