  body: "First, search Typophile. Use Google, as it will produce more results.\r\n\r\nSecond,
    post images. It's kind of asking a lot to make us go get them ourselves.\r\n\r\nThird,
    it's usually more convenient for future reference if you post the requests individually.\r\n\r\nJust
    a thought."

  body: Bob, I completely agree with Michael. Next time at least put in the effort
    to post images for us to look at if you want us to put in the effort to identify
    those typefaces for you.
