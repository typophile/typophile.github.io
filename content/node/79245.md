  body: I'm afraid it's probably hand-drawn, look at the slightly differing /a/ glyphs.
    I'm sure people here will help you look for alternative though.

    you. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.acidfonts.com/typeface/lambrettista.htm\r\nhttps://www.chank.com/shop/detail/4/fonts/2/parkway/\r\n\r\nNeither
    of these are perfect matches, but maybe close enough.\r\nThese aren't of the greatest
    quality, either - but If you're willing to do some fine-tuning yourself, you can
    get them to look pretty nice. \r\n\r\nCheers!"
