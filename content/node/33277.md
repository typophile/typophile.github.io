body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI'm making a logo for a rock band called Rock Fuel. It's not
  going as smoothly as I thought it would. It's actually pretty difficult.\r\n\r\nI've
  picked out three basic sketches from all my wierd attempts. I used Helvetica in
  number 2 and 3 just because I don't have to think about the type, just about how
  to edit it and possible symbols. Wilhelm Klingspor Gotish is the type that think
  fits best to the namne Rock Fuel at the moment.\r\n<!--break-->\r\n\r\n1 \r\nHere
  I first picked a type that I thought would be suitable and then tried some variations
  with and without symbols. This is the one that I feel most confident that could
  end up as a nice logo, or some version of it. I just haven't come that far with
  it yet.\r\n\r\n2 \r\nThis is just a test with an old gaspump and how it could fit
  together with a text.\r\n\r\n3 a and b\r\nJust tried some variations of how I could
  have it just as text and no symbols. Used Helvetica again, it would ofcourse be
  some other type, I guess I pick Helvetica because it's comfortable to work with.\r\n\r\n\r\nAny
  and all feedback welcome, thanks.\r\n\r\nPeter"

    though the blackletter form of 'r' is correct, you'll probably want to cheat it
    to look more like a conventional 'r', or even capitalize \"Rock\".\r\n\r\n2 -
    Maybe put the fuel tank before \"ROCK FUEL\" or even find a way to integrate it
    into the 'R'.\r\n\r\n3a/b - I like 3b the best out of all of the options. It definitely
    has that spray-painted, MTV Punk'd vibe to it. Was there any reasoning behind
    flipping the 'e'? It looks kind of arbitrary to me. I'd explore this version further.\r\n\r\n

  body: "1 does indeed read as 'cock fuel', which is quite funny in itself, but probably
    not what they want. You could always try to chop off the bottom stroke. But apart
    from that, I think no.1 is at the moment the best one. Though the blackletter
    is probably a bit clich\xE9 for a rock band.\r\n\r\nI'm not really feeling the
    grunge distressed effect on the type of the other ones. I don't think that alone
    can make a logo. But I have something against those distressed things in general,
    hehe.\r\nAnd you defenitely want to lose Helvetica. ;)\r\n\r\nYou could try to
    integrate that fuelpump into the shield of the blackletter logo, instead of the
    thing (what is it?) it has in it now, to let it contrast with the lettershapes.
    That could give it a nice spin.\r\n"

    I was experimenting with a type that looked a little like the one on the Greater

    to take a look at the three versions I made. They liked the pick and star idea
    in version one and the gas pump and general idea in version two. They thought
    version three was too much punk so I'm scrapping that. \r\n\r\nYesterday  I made
    a combination of version one and two. Inspired by the vintage gas cans. I put
    the gas pump inside the pick, I think I'll tweak that some more though. Gonna
    see if I can come up with something else as well. I like the black/red/yellow
    theme, maybe add some dirt and stuff.\r\n\r\nJust give me your two cents worth
    on the this version. In the bottom one I added a text that would be a album name.

    itself, or a Jerry can with a spout.\r\n\r\nI don't get the typeface choice. It
    says neither \"Rock\" nor \"Fuel\" to me. This would be a great opportunity to
    use an old-timey sign painter style script. Check out <a href=\"http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=23\"

    hint of numbers/gauges on the front. Or maybe terminate the red outline on one
    side with a spigot.\r\n\r\nSome other thoughts (that may or may not work):\r\n\r\n
    - Try double/tripling the size of the pick in relation to the type.\r\n - Put
    the type on a curve\r\n - I like the slam serif version...maybe emphasize the

    had type with very stiff and long serifs, looked odd on some but very good on

    the Slab Serifs of the type and eliminate the 1 point on each giving the serifs
    a 45 degree point. So instead you have angled serifs which will compliment the
    mark and give more of a "ROCK" feel. Just something to consider. I think it's
    FANATSTIC so far. Like Litera said "Thumbs up" ha ha.
