body: Rather interesting typeface with a significant R used on this Deutsche Grammophon
  cover. I thought it could have been drawn by Gareth Hague. Does any of you know
  the name of the typeface?

  body: Interesting with that cuspy "U" too. I don't know what it is (sorry) but I'll
    be curious too. FWIW those "M"s <em>could</em> be flipped "W"s.
