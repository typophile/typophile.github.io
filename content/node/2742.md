body: I posted this on another thread about sketches, I think this spot is a better
  fit. <BR> <BR>These are a few initial directions of an identity system for a truck
  decaling company in NJ. Pretty much they travel the NJ/NY/PA area putting gigantic
  decals on trucks like FedEx &#40;I worked for them and after staring at that logo
  for entire summer I no longer see the ingenuity of the &#34;hidden&#34; arrow&#41;
  and other big names. It&#39;s tedious work, blowtorches are involved, and it&#39;s
  blue collar. So that&#39;s the background.  <BR> <BR>I am of course interested in
  receiving feedback on my work. As most who post their work on these forums, I am
  very open to criticism. <BR> <BR>I only have two jpgs of pencil sketches. My Illustrator
  sketches are in the preliminary stages. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/24323.jpg"

  body: Thanks Hrant.  <BR> <BR>Yeah, the V with horns didn&#39;t work. I had that
    idea but the sketch looked bad. It was worth a shot. I do live in Chicago... <BR>
    <BR>What do you think about the spacing between letters? I even kerned while viewing
    it upside down... I&#39;m nervous about the &#34;A L&#34; space and the horizontal
    position of &#34;DECAL&#34;. That appendage on the E is stupid. Oops. <BR> <BR>The
    typeface is some random one that I spent a long time fixing to look like that.
    I may as well have started from scratch. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/24331.gif"

  body: Here&#39;s another cheezeball idea I had. Since it&#39;s a decal-putter-upper
    company, I tried out a direction where that&#39;s incorporated into the design.
    Get it, the &#34;V&#34; is a sticker? I kinda like it, but I feel like I&#39;ve

  body: I redrew the helmet to be a head on from slightly above. The logo is now a
    square. I&#39;m not sure about the leading now, nor am I completely comfortable
    with the distance between the type and the sides. I think I&#39;m creating some
    spacing problems by using an exact square. Then again, I can always redraw the
    helmet to help me out. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/24338.gif"

  body: I&#39;d suggest going back to the rotated-helmet concept, but having the higher
    horn on the left.  I would also encourage you to really think about the helmet&#39;s
    shape, and how it would silhouette; I feel like the horns are strangely skewed
    in your initial drawings. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d definitely round the tips of the horns
    as you did in your most recent image; it makes them more &#34;hornlike&#34;, and
    takes the egde off the counterchanging.

  body: I concur with Hrant regarding the angled view of the helmet, and more specifically
    with Shreyas&#39; direction of &#34;having the higher horn on the left&#34;, or
    rather the red horn in the white area &#40;whichever side it ends up being on&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>Have you explored any solutions &#34;outside of the box&#34;, but within
    the same direction as this concept? Maybe there&#39;s no red frame outlining the
    red area and the type, and red type is to the right of the mark. Perhaps try framing
    the graphic mark only, then positionig the type somewhere outside of the rectangle.
    Try creating a random red and white/negative space checker pattern &#40;not a
    square board&#41; and incorporating the elements &#40;graphic and type&#41; into
    a portion of that pattern. Just some ideas

  body: I agree with Drew. I&#39;d love to see you develop the peeling sticker logo
    idea a bit more. Could be really great, if you balance the strong/ bold design
    with just a little wit. Though, I suppose it could be seen as peeling <i>off</i>,
    rather than being applied. <BR> <BR>I also agree with Hrant. The angled helmet&#39;s
    much more interesting. Personally, I like the one set in the V maybe with some
    centered type. It&#39;s bold and simple but not boring. The strong V makes up
    for the less impactful shape. &#40;also taking a refined helmet into account&#41;
    <BR> <BR>Of course, this is posted after the weekend, so you&#39;ve probably moved
    on. Oh well, 2 cents in.

    tomorrow. Awesome feedback, guys. I too think the applied V could work if I get
    it right...We&#39;ll see.

  body: I didn&#39;t have much time to work on this, but here&#39;s a little update.
    <BR> <BR>I changed the helmet. It looks better, but it&#39;s not great. I messed
    around with the pos/neg ideas on the computer, results aren&#39;t as good as I&#39;d
    hoped. I&#39;m thinking about combining the peeling-off V with the pos/neg idea.
    Who knows. <BR> <BR>I played around with type/object positioning, but it&#39;s
    not there yet. Any objections to my type choice? Any suggestions? I don&#39;t
    think it looks right if it&#39;s not in white with a red backing. <BR> <BR><img
    src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/24482.gif" alt="lots of logos">
    <BR> <BR>As I previewed this gif I thought of extending the red rectangle all
    the way left to back up the type, then change the type to white. That could go
    somewhere.

    to see your last idea &#40;extend red rectangle left and knock out text to white&#41;

    type treatment to dominate the visual field. <BR> <BR> -t

  body: I think the helment is strong, but the pos/neg stuff weakens it. <BR> <BR>I
    like the all-dark helmet. What if the V was in the helmet, rather than the other
    way around? Perhaps like a V applied on the helmet? &#40;It&#39;s a bit sports-ish,
    though.&#41; <BR> <BR>I&#39;m going to throw another idea out there, because it&#39;s
    gnawing at my brain now. What if you gave the helmet a nose guard &#40;<a href="http://www.northerner.com/large_images/scg-s52b.jpg">example</a>&#41;,
    but in the shape of the counterform of the V or a V itself? Then you might be
    able to use that straight-on view from before.

  body: 'Hi Daniel, <BR> <BR>Just put two and two together with your ID thread. I
    was thinking this was Schwabesque. <BR> <BR>A side note about viking helmets:
    <a href="http://elfwood.lysator.liu.se/loth/l/u/luiro/vikinghelmet_01_copy.jpg.html">no
    horns</a> <BR>But you probably want to keep them for recognition since the myth
    is more recognized than the original. I think you can add some more details and
    still be simple enough. Perhaps some rivet highlights? Mabe the eye/nose mask?
    Maybe not? <BR> <BR>I&#39;d also try non-horizontal type treatments. Circle, with
    VIKING between the horns and DECAL below? Maybe a simple U shape below the helm?
    <BR> <BR>Whoops, just got another idea. Second to the viking helmet in recognizability
    is the viking longship. I think that might make a more compelling image.  <BR>

    suggestion. <BR> <BR>The Viking Ship is the logo for Viking Books. It&#39;s a
    good logo I think, I haven&#39;t seen it in a long time and I haven&#39;t searched
    for it online. <BR> <BR>My brother wants me to use the pos/neg idea with an actual
    viking dude, maybe with a sword or something. We&#39;ll see if that ever happens.
    As of now I need to  get some feedback from the client. Thanks for the recommendations.

    you need the reversed square in there...it&#39;s almost too much. Maybe try one
    with just the white helmet? <BR> <BR>The peeling V is also actually quite nice,
    though it may seem more like it&#39;s &#39;falling off&#39; rather than &#39;being
    applied&#39;. Ie, it may look like a shoddy decal that&#39;s coming off. Still,
    I like it.
