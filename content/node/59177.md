  body: Hi Nate. The closest I've been able to find is <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/ephemera/journalistic/?testdrive=dock%3Dfalse%26size%3D72%26w%3D720%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3DCentral%2520Queensland%2520News%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dot.liga%26seed%3D29"><u>Journalistic</u></a>.
    Will keep looking, though.
