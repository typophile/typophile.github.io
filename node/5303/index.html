<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>So what's the story on the chunky book-face phenomenon of late? I'm noticing more and more faces that abandon the perfect symmetry that seems to have become the standard (like 'Loreto' [ <a href=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/loreto_post1-34991.pdf target=_blank>http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/loreto_post1-34991.pdf</a> ], and 'Quetzal' [ <a href=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/6757.html?1077083089 target=_blank>http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/6757.html?1077083089</a> ]). <br> <br>What's the theory, that obviously jointed contours and asymmetry mimic the imperfections that ink can lay on paper even when the typeface is near-perfect in its symmetry? (Seems like a good-enough reason.) <br> <br>I'll revert to my Lamarckian views on letterform recognition for a moment... Have people gotten used to the [accidental, or at least naturally occuring] roughness of letterforms? And could it be that now they accept these types of contours as the norm and crave them?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hmm, my dictionary says that 'chunk' is a 'thick piece' or a 'corpulent animal'. <br>So, I guess 'chunky' typefaces are more about weight and proportions, not asymmetry and roughness. Also, I see that most 'chunky' faces have wedge serifs. <br> <br>Personally, I think some of these 'chunky' typefaces are too dark. That's my only complaint about them. Of course, some fonts like digital Electra, are too light. But Avance, on the other hand, it's too dark (serifs are too big). <br>Smeijers' typefaces (Quadraat, Renard, Arnhem) are well-balanced, I think (I've read books set in Renard and Arnhem FWIW). He usually makes thick stems but the serifs aren't so big or heavy. <br> <br>This is a interesting topic. I'd like to hear more opinions. <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>By 'chunky', are we meaning that Dwiggins-y thing where what should be a curve becomes a vertex? Like <a href="http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/font_frames.tpl?cart=10878958366508148&fontname=Prensa">Prensa</a> for example? <br> <br>This is related to what Hrant has been calling the Fauve style, yes? Derived equally from Dwiggins and Czech modernist faces? <br> <br>I really like all this stuff -- it seems to me to point toward a real possibility for freshness in book setting. I'd like to know more about where it's coming from, too, and to see some more of these great <a href=http://just.letterror.com/ltrwiki/AlessandroColizzi_2fAfstudeerProject>Czech faces</a>. <br> <br>(nb this article also references Dwiggins -- haven't had time to read it this morning; maybe some clues here?) <br> <br>R</div>

<div class=commentbody><i>>You may not be aware but there is a very bad American beer (I drank it in my youth) called "Pabst Blue Ribbon". Your font looks nothing like it, you will be happy to know :-) </i> <br> <br>Chris -- I'm sure Gerald's comment was not a mere coincidence. Goudy's Pabst Oldstyle typeface was in fact originally based on lettering that he did for advertisements for the Pabst Brewing Company in the late 1890s or early 1900s. Goudy was later asked to develop a typeface based on this lettering style, which was eventually cut and cast by ATF in 1902. <br> <br>-- K. <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Funny you should write in, Kent--I almost included Whitman in my list of examples (because, and forgive me if I'm wrong at all, it seems some glyphs have what I at first called "chunky" features. I'll now call them "clunky" [but this is not at all bad, as the dictionary may imply]). <br> <br>I apologize for using chunky, Eduardo. For me, the word has come to imply more than just thickness and weight; it now alludes to objects that are chunk-like in their appearance (tear off a chunk of something and look at the break, it's not clean, but "chunk-like"). <br> <br>The interior contour of lowercase 'h' in Kent Lew's Whitman is "chunk-like" in its appearance.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I believe that maybe the "clunkiness" you refer to is an attempt to add life to digital type. Some think digital types are overly homogenized and monotonous--especially compared to the subtle varieties in a letterpressed page. Whitman is surprisingly simple (in some ways) and angular at larger sizes, but at text sizes the angles blend with the curves and it becomes a very readable font. This is true of the roman and italic. <br> <br>I think Scala and Tyfa may fall into this category as well. (was Tyfa first designed for letterpress?) <br> <br>Also, I know I've at least read about it on Typophile, the Dwiggins experimental newspaper font (which is mentioned on the Quetzal post and in Mr. Johnson's Czech link above) does have these qualities. I have a Fine Print issue with a sample, I'll have to post it when I get a chance. Again, at small sizes, these features become more subliminal, right? <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Kent, <br> <br>I assumed Chris knew Goudy designed Pabst Col. Fred Pabst of Pabst Brewing Company. <br> <br>On the other hand many others would not. <br> <br>But Kent, I am having trouble with the essence of the question in this thread. I have developed a theory but am not sure it applies in this case. <br> <br>For instance, would they call this chunky? <a href=http://lanstontype.com/Jenson.html target=_blank>http://lanstontype.com/Jenson.html</a> <br> <br>Or Pabst. Pabst is obviously a less serious face, meaning it is for display, where Jenson could be both. But there has been mention of false inking. For me Pabst is somewhat playful on "false inking", as if Goudy was making fun of bad presswork. Although, as we know it probably has nothing to do with that, Goudy cut it in hot metal. It is merely playful, nothing serious, nothing that would sound the drums from the "inkist camp". They would blush to use Pabst as an example. After all it makes them look ridiculous. <br> <br>Also I get confused when anyone speaks of "too bold", or "too light". Non of this makes sense unless in context of a specific use. Some faces simply are light, or are bold. Using the word "too" would have value in historical work, in other words if a face was light and the revival was much darker, you could consider it "too bold". Otherwise it really does not have "too" much meaning. <br> <br>Or does it? Which is where my theory may apply.</div>

<div class=commentbody>This "digital type" theory is old news. Sturdy (as opposed to Chunky") typefaces such as Scala and Charter were produced in the early days of digital, to deal with the exigencies of the new process, in particular 300 dpi laser printers. Adobe Garamond also addressed the issue. <br> <br>A similar problem existed in the phototype era: the hairlines of types such as Galliard and ITC Garamond were prone to disappear during the production process. <br> <br>You can even go back to the early 20th century, and look at the problem printers had with using the same font on both uncoated and coated paper (where fine details were hard to keep right in big print runs) -- and the need for convergence in that era produced the uber-chunky Cheltenham. <br> <br>So, this is an ongoing technical engagement with "druk". <br> <br>Digitally, we have been through the rough early days, emerging into digital mastery -- with extreme high-res typography (admittedly, planar lithography can never achieve the palpability of letterpress, or the density of toner, but its resolution is superior). <br> <br>So, I would say that the present vogue for chunky type, if there is such a trend, is a reaction against the recent high-res phenomenon of typographers spec'ing tiny, ultra-light/ultra-fine type on smooth coated stock, a communal indulgence to "push it" to a limit that was previously unattainable. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Nick, <br> <br>I didn't think of types like Charter, and Oranda as well, being built to withstand typical laser printing. But I guess I'm referring to the more crisp, geometric quality some of these types have (I may be missing the point of this thread entirely). Adobe Warnock is another example of what I'm thinking of--sharp angles and points mixed with curves as opposed to a type with no straight lines such as Hoefler Text or your own Walburn.

<div class=commentbody><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/39015.jpg alt=chelt> <br> <br>>Cheltenham was a "retro-fashion statement", not a "production solution". <br> <br>Cheltenham was too innovative a design to be retro. On reflection, perhaps I overstated by saying that the need for convergence (one typeface for many printing situations) produced its design: rather, convergence made it hugely popular, because with its sturdiness it would hold up under abuse, and yet with its precisely drawn features, it had a neatness that worked in many different media, and sizes right up to display. <br> <br>Yes, its chunkyness gave it appeal to the "Arts and Crafts" set, but its appeal was more widespread than that, and in fact it co-existed with the major trend of expressively rendered retro faces of the early 20thC, typified by Goudy's work, Kennerley, Garamont, Goudy Old Style, etc. <br> <br>Ultimately, I agree with you on cognitive dissonance -- the best designs are created intuitively, and we seek to rationalize them afterwards. That is the case with Cheltenham, which exists on its own terms. <br> <br>In this sample, taken from an ad in "New Idea" women's magazine, September 1905, you can see that display-size Cheltenham has a mechanically drafted precision quite at odds with the Arts & Crafts ideal. At text size, its heft holds up against the rule at right (about 2 pt.). </div>

<div class=commentbody>OK Nick, <br> <br>I heard you laughing at my typo. Now I am going for the jugular. <br> <br><b>This weasel dies</b> <br> <br><i>Yes, its chunkyness gave it appeal to the "Arts and Crafts" set, but its appeal was more widespread than that, and in fact it co-existed with the major trend of expressively rendered retro faces of the early 20thC, typified by Goudy's work, Kennerley, Garamont, Goudy Old Style, etc.</i> <br> <br></div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I'm going to try to respond to what I think the original point was meant to get at. I think the terms "chunky," "clunky," and even Nick's "sturdy" are misleading. They imply a quality of weight and a stubbiness that, while often present in some of the examples cited, is not necessarily inherent in the kind of unexpected geometry that I think is the primary characteristic. <br> <br>I think that what A. Scott was referring to is what I have called a "digital vernacular" -- a quality of simplified and often unexpected geometry being applied in otherwise traditional forms. From my perspective this trend traces back through faces like Downer's Vendetta (1997) and Majoor's Scala (1991) to van Blokland's Proforma (1988) and Carter's Charter (1987) and ultimately to Unger's Swift (1985). Pre-digital influences include Dwiggins's experiments on the one hand and the Czech "school" (Menhart, Preissig foremost, Tyfa also) on the other. <br> <br>It strikes me that there are two threads of motivation in these precedents -- one technical and the other aesthetic. The early digital faces I cited were, as Nick pointed out, to a large extent confronting technical constraints, and their simplified geometry comes from efforts to create robustness in the face of coarse resolutions, as well as to conserve memory. The character that comes through is influenced strongly by the problems set before the designers. <br> <br>The other thread is an aesthetic one. The Czech designers were essentially operating within the general "expressionist" zeitgeist. The willfully coarse finish of Menhart and Preissig comes from a desire to infuse energy into traditional letterforms while at the same time stripping them of any excess typographic baggage. <br> <br>Dwiggins, in his own way, was also motivated primarily by aesthetic concerns. His experiments in what he called the "M-formula" were foremost an attempt to infuse a certain "snap" and "action" to the letterforms. His newsface efforts also professed to combat certain optical/technical constraints as well. But I think primarily he was exploring a type aesthetic that was influenced by his own cultural milieu -- Art Deco and Cubism, among others. This aesthetic is seen more overtly in his stencilled ornament and illustration. <br> <br>Nowadays, the technical constraints facing Unger and Carter are largely overcome (at least in print), and yet Swift and Charter still seem fresh and vital. The continued exploration of this formal territory in contemporary designs seems primarily for aesthetic effect. <br> <br>Speaking for myself, there is a fascination with taking seemingly inexpressive, reductive elements -- straight lines and simple curve segments -- and carefully combining them to create an unexpected grace or an organic tension. The yin/yang of the geometric vs. the organic is an ages-old formal dichotomy that can be found interspersed throughout the history of visual culture. The trend that we see in some contemporary type designs is just another expression of that exploration. <br> <br>I use the term "digital vernacular" because this kind of expression seems to embody an inherently digital aesthetic: there is a sense of "truth to the material" that is appealing. I say <i>"seems to"</i> because strictly speaking, of course, this isn't true at all -- there is nothing about beziers that lends them more to straight lines or simple curves; in fact, the wonderful inventiveness of bezier curves is exactly the opposite, that they can be so complex and supple. <br> <br>Similarly, there is nothing inherent in the woodcut medium that demands the rough, coarse cuts of the Expressionist work of Kirchner as opposed to the fine detail of engravings by Bewick, for example. And yet the raw woodcuts seem to evince a greater "truth to the material." [But now, I've wandered far afield.] <br> <br>Anyway, those are some of my reflections on the matter. <br> <br>-- K. <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I agree (ack) with Gerald G. about Cheltenham being redolent of the arts & crafts aesthetic - not of the Jenson influence in type, but of the furniture and architecture. The tall, narrow, rectangular look is very much the same. <br> <br>As to the popularity of Cheltenham, which Hector finds inexplicable, I think it is due to its filling a niche. It is narrow, dark, with tall ascenders and chunky, square serifs. This makes it quite readable at medium size in newspaper ads and article headlines. <br> <br>It does work well in the New York Times as a titling face for articles. Matthew Carter recently tweaked it for the NYT. It would be interesting to see a comparison of the old and new - maybe he fixed some of the awkwardness that Hector objects to. Part of the awkwardness I suspect is in what also makes it work well in some specific situations: the narrowness, darkness, tall extenders, and chunky serifs. </div>

I am also a fan of Whitman - now I understand better why. <br> <br>I think some of the confusion in this thread about 'chunkiness' is that both paths - exploration of the angular/geometric and of heavier weights with sturdier serifs - have been pursued in digital type. </div>

<div class=commentbody>I recently used Cheltenham for signage in Eudora Welty's mother's garden--at larger sizes I found it quite graceful, especially the italic. I had to noodle with it more in the printed materials--the spacing and leading were tricky. It is quite different from anything else I've used, it's kind of a "chubby" type... How's that? <br> <br>Further proof of aesthetic features born from technical necessity is Amplitude. The traps aren't needed, but they've become desirable. And Kent, I really am interested by your take on the "truth in materials" because it's usually associated with an "unfinished" quality (coarse cuts in a wood print, visible strokes in a painting, loose lines in a drawing...). I use the word "unfinished" for lack of a better word--I would never call a Van Gogh unfinished. But could this same quality be applied to type?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Chiming in with my graphic designer (as opposed to type designer) perspective: <br> <br>I was under the impression that a lot of these newer, sturdier faces were/are a reaction to the anemic digitizing of metal type that used the metal rather than the printed form as the basis for the digital design. These new faces were never metal, so they are designed through-and-through with the final product in mind by type designers who want to achieve the sturdier forms of earlier type. For a while, I didn't like these newer sturdier faces because I held some of the thinner digital versions as the standard of judgement without realizing some of the history. Now I've warmed to them completely and lust after beauties like Whitman. <br> <br>I don't have any scans of old typesetting to back this up with here, but this is my impression. Am I over-simplifying things with this mindset?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Gerald, Kent, <br> <br>I have admitted that Cheltenham has Arts & Crafts characteristics, in its heft, and perhaps in its proportions (by "tall" I presume you mean a small x-height), but the mechanical qualities of its drafting are at odds with the dominant feature of Arts & Crafts/Revivalist type design of the early 20thC, which is its hand-made quality, which is essentially anti-mass production. <br> <br>Certainly, there were formal qualities in Arts & Crafts era design in architecture and design (such as simplicity and geometric pattern -- eg in Macintosh, Wright), which was proto -Deco, -Modern, and -Moderne, but in graphics, typography and type design the movement was resolutely old-world, and as I said, expressive of the hand in its execution. Again, Goudy's types, and Benton faces such as his Garamond and Cloister, and Cooper's Black -- these are the defining, most used faces of that era, and they bear no trace of the ruler, set square, or compass: Cheltenham is very different from these. And Century. <br> <br>But enough of Cheltenham. I'd rather discuss the present day. We do tend to lapse into kicking the old chestnuts around, don't we? In the post where I mentioned Cheltenham, I gave equal space to phototype, but no-one wants to talk about that. ITC Garamond is persona non grata! <br> <br>Chris, you are right in your observation about "anemic digitizing", many type designers (including myself) wrestled with this in the early days of digital type. But "anemic phototype" was also a problem -- as an art director in the '70s and '80s, I found that the funkiness of old metal type and hand-lettering (which I saw in old books and magazines) was something sorely missing in the slick smoothness of commercial typography. <br> <br>So really, this is an endless phenomenon, the battle of art against commercial slickness -- it is what propelled Morris into type design, among others. <br> <br>Hector, I agree with you that Cheltenham lacks subtlety in execution. This can be a virtue in a typeface: it will accomodate sloppy printing, and will not embarrass typographers who use it without much skill. There are many faces like this. <br> <br>Personally (with the precedent and advice of Oz), I have designed typefaces that could have been slicker and smoother, but some judicious awkwardness adds character. But no, I don't like Cheltenham, although I did use it for an ad once, and it worked well. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Nick, <br> <br>That is the result of your observation flaw about the "Arts & Crafts Movement". Stress the "Movement". <br> <br>Morris said, "keep nothing in your house that is not usable, or that you do not consider beautiful". He did not dictate beauty. He left room as big as a mansion for other artisans to participate. <br> <br>Take a look at Tiffany glass.

<div class=commentbody>Gerald, <br> <br>You should look at the typeface with your own eyes, rather than through the lens of monolithic, conventional, histories based on fine books. (With which I am well aware, you don't have to "educate" me, thank you.) I prefer to look at magazines, by the way. <br> <br>Matt McGrew suggest that there were many contributors to the Cheltenham design, including Goodhue, Kimball, Benton, and Phinney. <br> <br>Even if all these were ardent Morrisonians, with every intention of producing an "Arts & Crafts" typeface, does that mean that the finished product will end up worthy of such a pedigree? <br> <br>No, with original designs (more so than for revivals/copies), things don't always turn out as originally intended. One can set out to produce a work that will have a particular appeal, and people will take to it for a quite different reason. <br> <br>Did these folks consider themselves to be part of an Arts & Crafts movement? had the category even been invented? Were they open to other influences? Of course -- yet history distills and simplifies. <br> <br>Yes, the shift was away from the 19th century modern faces, but these persisted well into the 1920s, and other new (in 1890s) faces such as Century built on that Modern tradition. While a revival of that era, it should be pointed out that Bodoni was not an A&C old style. <br> <br>Take a look at Cheltenham. It is novel. It has, as you said, the look of having been drawn with an architect's tools. I agree. And this is my point: it has a structural modernity of finish quite different to the mainstream of "revival era" faces, with their expressive, hand-drawn detailing. <br> <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I agree wholeheartedly with almost everything Nick just said. <br> <br>From my study of them, I am fairly sure that Benton and paricularly Phinney did not particularly consider themselves part of the Arts & Crafts movement per se, but they were both responsible for the mainstreaming and commercializing of it, getting it into the mass media of the time. <br> <br>J.W. Phinney in particular saw something that was clearly prime for mass-market popularity, and was got ATF to be the first (AFAIK) big foundry to really jump on what would become the bandwagon, directing knockoffs, revivals, and stuff inspired by older models. The part of A&C he saw value in was turning back to historical models for type. The auteur-like private press and careful craftsmanship part of A&C, well, I don't know if that was such a big concern to him. Perhaps it was just irrelevant, insofar as ATF was solely a retail foundry and not really a printer/publisher (its glorious specimen books notwithstanding). So they just made the type, and what folks did with it was up to them. But certainly supplying people who were part of the A&C movement could have been only a tiny part of ATF's sales. <br> <br>BTW, when ATF knocked off Morris, they didn't just do a straight knockoff, but "fixed" some of the letters in ways that make me cringe a little. Although the general character is still present, some of the more interesting details have been eliminated. Reminds me a little of ITC's revivals of the 70s. <br> <br>Sorry if I'm taking this off topic. The 1880s-1920s has long been my favorite period in type design. <br> <br>Cheers, <br> <br>T</div>

<div class=commentbody>Sorry William, no slight intended -- I read a whole bunch of posts (Gerald & Kent's were longest) and didn't check back when I was writing mine. <br> <br>>you didn't address the point that Cheltenham looks like other aspects of the arts and crafts movement - mission furniture and architectural decoration. <br> <br>Yes I did, but I'll take another stab at it. <br> <br>You're right to say that Cheltenham has something in common with, and may have been inspired, by the crude craftsmanship of A&C furniture. But one also finds the forms you mention in the engineering and industrial machinery of that era. The G has always struck me as being very nautical, the bottom right feature suggesting a capstan, or the prow of a Dreadnaught. <br> <br>To me the effect of Cheltenham, and the systematic way it was used in the high tech mass media of the day (see the ad sample in my earlier post), takes it into a completely different realm. And this is what Thomas mentioned too, that the A&C forms were exploited and integrated into a non-craftsman milieu. Really, once the face was developed by a team of foundry engineers such as Morris Benton (wearing lab coats, not smocks, I suspect) for mass production, that's when it stopped being A&C.</div>

<div class=commentbody>BTW, from our Post-modern perspective, it may seem that the A&C movement, preceding 20thC modernism, and harkening back to guild days, was retro. But many aspects of it were forward-looking. Progressive socialism was a feature of the movement. Morris was some kinda feminist, and he and Jane Morris pioneered sensible clothes (especially progressive for women of the time). The holes we put them pigeons in now, are not the same as was around back then. <br> <br>One sees a similar dichotomy in the origin of the sans, early 19thC -- some would say (me) a feature of early industrial modernism, others (Mosley, the Nymph and the grot), a neo-classical phenom. Why not both, or perhaps of some historical significance yet to be invented?!</div>

<div class=commentbody>>crude craftsmanship of A&C furniture <br> <br>I don't this this is quite accurate. Some of it was extremely well made, and looks like new a hundred years later. But they do have a heavy, sometimes even crude look to the designs. The heavy, sturdy, square and simple forms seem to derive from an certain aesthetic: they go for it even at the cost of looking clumsy or ungainly. At its best, in the right setting, it really has charm -like Cheltenham? <br> <br>>takes it into a completely different realm <br> <br>Good point. Like mass produced mission furniture, it is no longer in the retro, personal craft realm, which Morris seems to have had as an ideology, if I get it right. It just takes the aesthetic and goes somewhere else with it. From ideology and innovation to style to fad - how many times has that happened! <br> <br> </div>

<div class=commentbody>Tomas and others. <br> <br>I realize that many do not understand the "Arts & Crafts Movement". Some mistaking, obviously, that there was some intended look, rather than, and intended philosophy. <br> <br>The "Arts & Crafts Movement" seems to lead many into thinking that it is about some French painter sitting by the river in Paris foisting off his painting of posies so he can wax his moustache and charm some floosie out of her knickers. <br> <br>William Morris was an "Art Manufacturer". This was what the movement was about. It was to improve the state of man, to enrich peoples lives by ornament. To make their homes, their cities, their books, their beds a nicer place for all to live. Never forget that you are speaking of a "Manufacturing Movement". William Morris was not a tear jerking, poverty ridden painter, living in a hovel with coal miners from Newcastle. <br> <br>Bless their hearts. <br> <br>ATF; I am not sure you not aware of all manifestations of that company, all the participants that that company was made up of.

To make their homes, their cities, their books, their beds a nicer place for all to live. <br> <br>Gerald, That's not quite right.

For instance, Morris & Co did not use machine printing of wallpaper in their factory for two reasons: because the quality was poor, and because it alienated the workers. Subsequently he allowed machine printing of some patterns, to produce affordable versions of his designs for the lower classes. <br> <br>At Roycroft, a hard core commune stuck to its guns. They were the ones who were surrounded. <br> <br>The broad ideals of the Arts & Crafts movement influenced the socialist structure of the modern state, especially in Northern Europe. But so did the altruism of enlightened industrialists from Wedgwood on. <br> <br>Nothing is neat and tidy, everything overlaps. <br> <br>Now, how about some samples of contemporary chunky book faces, please?!</div>

<div class=commentbody>Bye bye Gerald. Sweet dreams. <br> <br>Nathan, that chunky font works OK with DIN (although I'm not so sure they suit Monteverdi). <br> <br>But the metrics aren't quite right. It's over-kerned -- the closing up between v, w, and round letters is excessive. Also, when there are two rounds together (eg "pe" in period, it's also too much of a hot spot. Is it just over-zealous kerning, or are the kind of metrics that work for high contrast serifed types not appropriate for chunky types?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yes, that's Swift in the Monteverdi liner notes. Nick is right in his critiques of the spacing; those are weak points. <br> <br>You actually won't find many examples of these sorts of types in books. Book designers are notoriously conservative. You will periodically see Scala (like in the new <i>Chicago Manual of Style, 15th ed.</i>, as Nathan mentioned earlier). I have seen Vendetta used now and then -- I think it was used in Bernd Heinrich's <i>Winter World: The Ingenuity of Animal Survival</i> [Ecco, 2003], for example. <br> <br>The latest issue of SoTA's <i>Interrobang</i> newsletter is set primarily in Downer's Sermone (formerly known as Simona), which qualifies in this category. An interesting showing. I like the italic a lot, but am still ambivalent about the Roman 'a' and Rotis-like 'c' and 'e'. <br> <br>There are two small garden books in a series recently published by Harry N Abrams, each profiling a different genus of flower -- <i>Daffodil</i> and <i>Rose</i> (both by Wachsberger and James) -- which use Eureka throughout. <br> <br>Whitman has shown up in a couple books that I know of: <i>Extreme Simplicity</i> [Chelsea Green Publishing, 2002] and <i>A Guide to Family History Resources at the Minnesota Historical Society</i> [MnHS Press, 2004]. I've got a couple titles in production right now that will be out later this year in which I'm using Whitman. <br> <br>Nathan, I wouldn't have included Perpetua in this category myself. And Electra is perhaps prototypical of the style but, in my mind, doesn't really belong to the "chunky bookface" category that I think A. Scott had in mind when beginning this thread. <br> <br>-- K.</div>

<div class=commentbody><i>>And Kent, I really am interested by your take on the "truth in materials" because it's usually associated with an "unfinished" quality (coarse cuts in a wood print, visible strokes in a painting, loose lines in a drawing...). I use the word "unfinished" for lack of a better word--I would never call a Van Gogh unfinished. But could this same quality be applied to type?</i> <br> <br>Well, I think this is part of the current appeal of the "digital vernacular." There is a sense of immediacy in the forms, a sense of seeing the "raw materials" or being closer to the process, in some cases. <br> <br>This notion was part of the philosophical underpinnings of many modern movements in visual art, beginning perhaps with the Impressionists and culminating in the Abstract Expressionists (think Pollock and DeKooning) and Color-Field painters (Morris Louis, Helen Frankenthaler, Paul Jenkins). <br> <br>The Bauhaus had a strong "materials" ethic, which had a profound influence on architecture and graphic design. I am not surprised to see this theme appear in contemporary type design. <br> <br>But, as I alluded to earlier, in many cases this is really a charade. In a digital medium, "truth to material" becomes a nebulous thing. When Bezier curves can easily be made to represent smooth, supple, and complex forms, why should simple geometric forms seem more "true" to the medium? <br> <br>I'm not sure why coarseness and unrefined characteristics are viewed as somehow more integral to the nature of a material. But there it is. And the modern era has often explored the dichotomy between the coarse and the refined, between the raw material and the conceptual idea. <br> <br>It seems to be a perennial fascination. <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Kent, I agree that the intent and effect of Meridien is one of great sharpness, but no matter how sharp the original font artwork in phototype, it would always be softened during the production process, being reproduced several times before the image wound up on paper. <br> <br>So a sharp Postscript point, being lasered from a digital file direct-to-plate, maintains a sharper impression. <br> <br>Metal type was capable of producing extremely sharp images, perhaps sharper than PostScript, because of the 3D impression, but the sharpness was not at the pointed tip of details, but along the edge of the impression.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Also, Meridien's pointed serifs are wedge shaped, whereas Beaufort's have a concave bracket, ergo sharper. That's not something that was feasible in previous technologies, due to its extreme delicacy. Although I could be wrong. Is Treacy's Arrow a revival?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Nick, <br> <br>This is just a small point, no need to elaborate. <br> <br><i>Kent, I agree that the intent and effect of Meridien is one of great sharpness, but no matter how sharp the original font artwork in phototype, it would always be softened during the production process, being reproduced several times before the image wound up on paper. <br> <br>So a sharp Postscript point, being lasered from a digital file direct-to-plate, maintains a sharper impression.</i> <br> <br>Laser output has its questions. Not that it affects sharpness. (I am speaking of high res). But certainly weight. For example Caslon 337 output on a Variatyper had considerable more weight, and was closer to original, than output from a Linotype. <br> <br>Perhaps, one was a white printer, the other a black printer. <br> <br>An early question for laser engines manufacturers: Is the outline "part of the type image", or is the outline "the container"? <br> <br>You may think the answer is obvious, but it is not to a laser engine. One engine has to remove the outline, the other has to include it. Still the results are not identical. Some engineers do not take these things into account, most of them are "not typographers". <br> <br>That question means more than you would like at small point sizes. Particularly with characters that had counters such as a,& b. <br> <br>We worked with some early "laser engine manufacturers". Also with NEC. It is so many years ago but I think at that time Canon ruled the world. There is certainly a considerable difference between a "white printer" and a "black printer". <br> <br>Sharpness is DPI territory, however there is room for error, room for electronic interpretation. The same is true converting Postscript fonts into True Type fonts, there is "loss". Theoretically Ikarus would convert more accurately into TrueType than would Postscript. <br> <br>All said and done, we do not live in a perfect world. <br> <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>This is what I meant by "PostScript sharpness", showing the construction of the serifs in Beaufort. <br>The curve is, as Gerald has mentioned "what you get" with PostScript -- I didn't judge its shape to be particularly attractive or not, the main thing was to make the serif as sharp as possible, as simply as possible, and that would make it "true to materials". <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/39300.gif alt=beaufs></div>

<div class=commentbody>We are not addressing output at this point. Simple sharpness. Photocomp was equal, at this stage. Hand cut punches could easily equal sharpness. Mathematical no. <br> <br>A fast question. Which side of the outline do you consider defines the design?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Photocomp could perhaps equal PostScript sharpness, if done with a fine hair brush. But then the image would have to be reproduced several times -- to font master, to font (filmstrip), to galley, to film, to plate, losing definition at avery step. <br> <br>Hand cut punch could perhaps equal this sharpness, but then such a (3D) image would have to be copied to make a mould, then copied again to make the font, and each copy results in a loss of definition. <br> <br>With digital type, the sharpness of the point is as sharp as the resolution of the output device. <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/39316.jpg alt=fall1> <br>The title type here is 120pt, but that's not really relevant -- what is, is that the screen is 175 line, which you can't see at normal reading distance, so that gives an indication of how sharp the type image is. <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/39317.jpg alt=fall2></div>

<div class=commentbody>Nick, thanks for the instructive Beaufort examples. (Is that cover one of your designs?) <br> <br>Gerald, I don't think Nick's saying that there is no loss in current production technologies. Clearly there are still opportunities for loss at any point along the way. <br> <br>I believe the point is that the degree of loss is less today than previously in history. You would be hard pressed to get such a sharp serif and maintain it in previous prepress processes -- possible perhaps(?) but quite exceptional. <br> <br>Whereas, by comparison, current digital processes seem to possess remarkable sharpness as a notable result. Is this necessarily a good thing? I don't know. But it does open a technical area for designers to explore further than before. <br> <br>But, Nick, this sharpness is not so much unique to Postscript and beziers as it is a confluence of various technical developments. The same degradation that happens to Meridien in the process of photofilm to exposed film to composite to plate, etc., can happen in digital depending upon the rasterizing engine, film to plate v. direct, press type, paper, etc. <br> <br>-- K. <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Gerald, Kent, yes, that's one of my book cover designs. <br>(It's hard to come by samples from others using Beaufort, which is one of my least popular designs -- although Marc Oxborrow did send some a while ago.) <br> <br>I wouldn't call it Arts & Crafts, it's more of a neo-classical design, simple, symmetrical. I usually do up to a dozen different treatments for this publisher, in lots of different genres, send him a PDF which he prints out, and wraps them round "dummies", and puts them on a bookstore shelf to see which has most kick from across the store. So his choices do tend to favor the sure-footed, heavy-handed. But I figure some sophistication can be added to a simple layout if everything is sized and positioned "just so". Display type and a careful color scheme help too. <br> <br>H</div>

<div class=commentbody>Nick, <br> <br>Which side of the line do you consider to be the type design? <br> <br>I hate to say this Nick, but I think you are confusing yourself. What I see as your fresh personal style, you see as something unique to modern day tools. Please do not under-estimate yourself. <br> <br>These are good illustrations, but I am not sure they make the point. It might, but I don't know. I hate to go forensic on you but I would first need to know several things. <br> <br>(1.) Bernhard Modern: Was it intended to have sharp points? No intention, no comparison? See my point. Like puns? <br> <br>(2.) If so, is the problem on the master, or is the problem with over inking, over impression, or what? <br> <br>(3.) How many impressions have been pulled from this type. Is this the first? Not likely. <br> <br>A more scientific study would be to ask Gerald Lange to make a polymer of the digital type then have him pull a proof on paper that would approximate the quality of paper, impression of the Bernhard specimen. <br> <br>Comparisons should always be fair. <br> <br>Intention is the underpinnings of failure or success, otherwise it is an accident, even if it works, or even works better. It is still an accident. The bar for a determination based on this example is too obscure to conclude</div>

<div class=commentbody><i>>So it's almost infinitely sharp. The practical sharpness is determined by the resolution of the production process</i> <br> <br>Postscript is certainly capable of theoretically infinite sharpness. But, as you say, the practical sharpness is determined by the resolution of the process. <br> <br>Consider this: at 2540 dpi resolution, the smallest discrete increment is .00039". The Linotype machining process (as just one example) was capable of tolerances as fine as .00025". <br> <br>Metal is a complex and marvelous material. Sharp points are certainly possible, if desired -- one might even say as sharp as a knife's edge. Now, printing this might be another matter. And printing it over and over, yet another. Type metal is certainly prone to wear. <br> <br>So, we find ourselves confronted with theoretical sharpness vs. practical sharpness. <br> <br>But, yes, I understand your point (so to speak) that Postscript's theoretical sharpness is unprecedented. I'm not convinced that it is a particularly fruitful arena of exploration beyond what you've done with Beaufort. But it has been interesting to contemplate. <br> <br>And now we find ourselves quite far afield from "chunky book faces." <br> <br>-- K. <br></div>

The Linotype machining process (as just one example) was capable of tolerances as fine as .00025".</i> <br> <br>Few people will know just how fine .00025" is. Trust me, it is really fine. Lanston specs are, .00010 which is even finer. Linotype and Lanston did not share "unit standards" which is "possibly why", but another discussion, not to mention speculative on my part. <br> <br>In other words, digital 2540 dpi is like "my dear dead grandmother's washboard". <br> <br>Where as increments for hot metal "machine setting" punches <a href=http://lanstontype.com/Punch.html target=_blank>http://lanstontype.com/Punch.html</a> <br> were astounding. Attention should be paid to the quotation marks. <br> <br>The "increments on the gauge" were so fine you could "not" read them without the aid of the built in "powerful microscope". <br> <br>This gauge, although not huge, could "not be moved" because it would alter the temperature of the materials the gauge was made of. The gauge and punches sat at "same room temperature" before the final testing. The National Research Council initially dismissed my claims of accuracy until they visited the plant. The height-to-paper matrix grinding machine was an optical marvel as well. I learned a great deal about optics when I was learning to cut punches. An interesting point, they had to pour 6 tons of molten glass to get 1 ounce of optical quality glass. Not only that, but the chemistry of the glass was made specifically for this gauge. The final trick was to "find that ounce of glass" within </div>
