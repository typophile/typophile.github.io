body: "I've got an interesting design project I've been asked to take on, and which
  I'd like to share with you all. It's for a zine to be published at <a href=\"http://gordon.edu\">Gordon
  College</a>, where I graduated from last year, and whose student newspaper I previously
  redesigned (with your <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/736\">much</a> <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/977\">appreciated</a>
  help -- though like me you may be wounded to know that the current editorship was
  using Verdana for the text last I saw). \r\n\r\n<strong>Background</strong> - Gordon
  is a generally hostile environment for LGBT people, due to its conservative Christian
  policies and culture. Most students (even some of the queer and questioning ones)
  feel that to be gay is sinful, and the administrators have in the past booted students
  even for pretty tame expressions of same-sex attraction, so virtually no one is
  out to more than their close friends. That may be slowly changing, but for now and
  the foreseeable future it's a rough place to be. \r\n\r\n<strong>Project</strong>
  - Amid this environment, there are usually a few progressive students trying to
  be a voice for change, and in that spirit two current students I know are trying
  to collect anonymous, personal stories from queer or questioning Gordonites and
  publish them together in a booklet. There will be about a dozen pieces, of various
  lengths. They've asked me to design it. It's a little daunting, which is why I'm
  seeking advice from the big boys and girls. \r\n\r\nI think this will be a milestone
  event, since it will be printed in fairly large numbers, and be probably the biggest
  act of public self-expression by queer students at Gordon ever, so I really really
  want to make it look really good.\r\n\r\nSo I'm trying to choose the fonts, and
  figure out what kind of feel would be most appropriate. To me it seems it should
  look personal, a little warm, even with a hint of humor, but still dignified and
  understated. Insofar as it's a student project, and more like a magazine than a
  newspaper, and ultimately about *L*O*V*E*, the display could be a little bold, and
  if space permits I'll probably make a couple illustrations (high contrast images
  of people perhaps). But these are people's personal stories, a few of them rather
  painful, so the display and illustrations shouldn't be exuberant to the point of
  irreverence.\r\n\r\nThe only fonts definitely on the shortlist so far are <a href=\"https://www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/families-79-comenia-text\">Comenia</a>
  for text and <a href=\"http://www.t26.com/fonts/Pelso\">Pelso</a> for display, and
  I'm definitely still looking. Bello seems too out there, but for some reason I'm
  exploring going some distance in that direction. I might be thinking of <a href=\"http://www.fountain.nu/catalogue/ericsans.asp\">Eric
  Sans</a> for display if I hadn't already used it for another project at Gordon last
  year. And it's a touch too informal perhaps, but I'd be considering <a href=\"http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=242924\">Charter</a>
  for text if that wasn't the school paper's font (pre-Verdana anyway). \r\n\r\nOh,
  and we have a small budget so I'm hoping to stay under $200."

    cold, awkward.... Can you get a nicer face for display? Maybe find another organic
    face in Storm''s catalog. Charter is very neutral and businesslike. Not at all
    bad for text (9 point in print), maybe something like Miller Display as headline
    face.'

  body: "Thanks!\r\n\r\n<strong>Updates: </strong>(1) many of the articles may not
    have headings, just numbers, set like book chapter numbers. Having <strong>nice
    figures</strong> thus becomes key. (2) The title is likely to be <strong>Know</strong>,
    so a display that would look attractive on that word (probably all caps or all
    lc) is important also.\r\n\r\nStorm: I do like <a href=\"http://www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/families-23-john-sans\">John
    Sans</a>, particular the White and Heavy, though I'm not sure I like the 1 glyph.
    <a href=\"http://www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/families-42-sebastian\">Sebastian</a>
    is also nice, maybe even for the text.\r\n\r\nI also like <a href=\"http://www.emtype.net/relato_1.html\">Relato</a>
    for text, and for display: <a href=\"http://www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/view/ParisinePlusPTF\">Parisine

    \ (maybe also <a href=\"\">Gotham Rounded</a>), and maybe <a href=\"http://www.psyops.com/html/spec_oxtail.html\">Oxtail</a>.\r\n\r\nI
    think I'm looking for something less reserved than Miller. As for Pelso, I think
    you may be right, but I also did see a beautiful setting of a similar style of
    font recently in <em><a href=\"http://www.cyberpresse.ca/section/CPPRESSE\">La
    Presse</a></em>... perhaps I'll take another look at it and compare it  to Pelso
    more closely.\r\n"

    I just deleted it :)"

  body: i always prefer reading serifed type, but i suppose that Sebastian has a personal
    quality that several of your other choices above didn't seem to have (to me).
    i would think that you would want something personal to go with the tone of the
    stories you're presenting. and of course Dear Sarah is lovely as a display font
    and even works well at large sizes.

  body: "Yes, I'd like to use Sebastian because I'm intrigued by it, and feel it could
    almost work. But I agree it may not be the most readable at 24 pages.\r\n\r\nI
    still like Comenia, but wish I could find something with a similar feel to compare
    it to (being a choice maximizer rather than satisficer). Does anything come to
    mind?\r\n\r\n(Re: the other choices above, yes, I think I have reasonably OK taste
    given enough time, but my quick judgment is perhaps less good :)"

    conventional than I originally hoped for, but nice, and perhaps a setting that
    doesn't draw too much attention to itself is best here anyway.\r\n\r\nI'll post
    some images, etc. later on..."

  body: "So here's <a href=\"\">a copy</a> of the first \"beta\"-level draft. I'd
    love to hear any feedback on the design before it's finalized. [Update: link taken
    down after project finalized.]\r\n\r\nKnown issues: \r\n-- Minor design and typo
    fixes needed\r\n-- E.g. Need to ligature-ize some of the pull quotes (wasn't able
    to get it to consistently join up the letters automatically)\r\n-- The cover is
    a basic concept, not very fine-tuned yet -- suggestions welcome. For one thing,
    I'm trying to get the pink eye-catching without being an eyesore. (Though failing
    a hard proof from the printer, something we probably don't have time for, I'm
    not sure how finely I can control the outcome.)\r\n-- There may also be a similar
    image on the back cover, no text, possibly <a href=\"http://clipart.com/en/close-up?o=4095884&memlevel=A&a=a&q=whisper%20boy%20girl&k_mode=all&s=1&e=17&show=&c=&cid=&findincat=&g=&cc=&page=&k_exc=&pubid=\">this

  body: "Oh, and I recently found out that (probably at the design of the main editors)
    this booklet will be coming at an auspicious time -- two days prior, Gordon will
    be <a href=\"http://www.soulforce.org/equalityride\">visited by Soulforce</a>,
    and from what they tell me the campus is totally wigging out with anxiety/anticipation
    (depending on whom)...\r\n\r\nMore on the cover: I'm having trouble with the type
    because (1) Comenia seems to fit with the image, but in itself seems too plain
    as a display and (2) Dear Sarah vice-versa."
