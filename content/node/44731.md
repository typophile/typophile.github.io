  I made a geometric sanserif typeface, for which I created 3 posters. I wanted to
  use typofoto as it was a technique widely used in the 1920's, the 'time' of geometric
  typefaces. After reading LetterLetter I also wanted to imitate the look of the first
  specimens from the 18th century. I used photo-etching, made plates, printed and
  used photoshop to layer them. I wonder if I achieved the right effect and ask for
  some help - I would like to make it look more 'nowadays', but don't really know
  how to do that. Any comments?\r\n\r\nPosters are on these links:\r\n\r\n[[http://i225.photobucket.com/albums/dd64/playground15/pero.gif|poster1]]\r\n\r\n[[http://i225.photobucket.com/albums/dd64/playground15/cherry-1.gif|poster2]]\r\n\r\n[[http://i225.photobucket.com/albums/dd64/playground15/creation.gif|poster3]]\r\n"
