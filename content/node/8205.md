body: I want to start a collection of information on type design. It can be anything
  from papers written by designers, type specimens in PDF form, helpful books I can
  purchase, anything relevant to  type design.  <BR> <BR>     I will soon be without
  internet access. Sadly, this will mean that I will no longer regularly visit this
  site, if at all, and I would like to collect as much information I can take with
  me so I can continue my growth as a graphic designer and my growth to becoming a
  REAL typographer &#40; I&#39;ve come to realize that I&#39;m far from calling myself
  this and to do so now would only insult those who are real typographers&#41;. <BR>
  <BR>     So if it&#39;s not too much trouble, I would really appreciate the help
  from my fellow typophiles. <BR> <BR>Thank You <BR>IM
