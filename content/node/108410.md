  body: nice! i was looking for horizontal-extended though. I may have to just rock
    out with a extended slab serif and add the decor to the face....was kind of hoping
    to stumble across a face that had those characteristics. thanks for the link.

  body: '@Donshottype thanks man!! those are some cool references. I''m beginning
    to think that a thin, extended/expanded tuscan face is going to be the holy grail
    of my searches :P or I may have to pull out fontographer and create something.
    thanks a mil for the references though!'
