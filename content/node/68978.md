  body: The first "Q" is best, and after quick look, the "a needs work. Overall very
    good indeed.

  body: "As usual, an excellent work from TypeTogether. Some small observations:\r\n\r\n1.
    bottom part of g seems a bit rigid and large. It could be narrower.\r\n\r\n2.
    ordinal in numero sign seems to be a zero, but it would be a superscript |o| because
    N\xBA abbreviates the word <strong>N</strong>umer<strong>o</strong>.\r\n\r\n3.
    section has a nice and original design, but I guess it would be considered too
    fancy or not easily recognizable in Law texts, where it is largely used."

  body: "I just saw this.\r\nVery cool of you to do this!\r\nHow open are you to critiques?\r\n\r\nFWIW,
    in Armenian \"Abril\":\r\n1) Is the name of the month (no big surprise).\r\n2)
    Means \"to live\", a lyrical contrast to the Armenian Genocide which we commemorate
    on April 24.\r\n3) What I long wanted to name a daughter, but when the time came
    my wife objected.  :-/\r\n\r\nThen there's Victoria Abril, a fabulous actor.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
