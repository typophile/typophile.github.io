  have drawn the alphabet in illustrator.\r\n\r\nThe intention is to learn fontographer
  (very quickly) to allow us to use the typeface for the project.\r\n\r\nThe question
  is then, how difficult is fontographer to get going without any help or time to
  understand the ins and outs of the program. I realise this is in some respects a
  silly question. I just need someone to be honest with me with regards to whether
  this is going to work out. I've got about a week before something goes to print.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nMarc"

    even need to set the kerning etc. I just need to press a letter on my keyboard
    and for that letter to appear on screen! \r\n\r\nMarc"

  body: "I have jumped into fontographer and managed the basics, a tip \u2013 when
    transferring the glyphs from illustrator to fontographer is to have a box of the
    same size around each character (probably based on cap M with ascender and descender
    heights and slightly larger), otherwise fontographer will scale each character,
    remember to delete the boxes after importing. Good luck, I\u2019m sure that more
    qualified users will be able to help with most problems, especially in the Build
    forum.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: If the initial item going to press doesn't require a lot of text using this
    font (a couple of short lines, maybe), you could just place the Illustrator images
    of the necessary letters in your layout and kern by shifting their boxes. Of course
    you'll still want to make a proper font of it, but this might be a quickie method
    to meet your press deadline for the moment.
