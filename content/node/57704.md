  larger poster <a href=\"http://www.lewisbullock.com/PosterPreview.jpg\">here</a>
  for detail of cross-stiches in all characters.\r\n\r\nThis is my first typeface,
  started in February as part of a university project.\r\n\r\nIt's purely playful
  and teamed with a experimental specimen book that expands the traditional idea of
  typesetting witty text quotes or pangrams, to include an entire story with illustrations
  about the typeface. This typeface is the visual representation of the character
  Ina within the story.\r\n\r\nLooking for any critique and tips on Opentype as I'd
  like to include a few ligatures in the future.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\np.s. I have
  a Flickr set with a few photos of development <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/doubleyoudoubleyoudot/sets/72157615005997770/\">here</a>"

    set soon as hand-in is Friday. Eep!\r\n\r\np.s. It isn't actually handpicked/stitched
    (if that's what you meant?), I just typed the font over a fabric background :)"
