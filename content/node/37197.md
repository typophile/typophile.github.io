body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI am happy to announce the first public version of my Font Remix
  Tools for FontLab.\r\nIf you have an MM font with a weight axis these tools allow
  you to generate true small caps, tabular figures or even true condensed versions
  in a single step with an easy to use dialogue.\r\nThe Remix Tools come with an installer
  so you do not need any FL scripting knowledge to get them to work.\r\n\r\nMore info
  and download at:\r\n<a href=\"http://justanotherfoundry.com/tools/RMX\">http://justanotherfoundry.com/tools/RMX</a>\r\n\r\nSorry
  for crossposting if you have already read this.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\nTim"

  body: "Difficult to make a comparison there. As far as I know, Superpolator improves
    interpolation and the like but does not aim at changing individual glyph shapes.
    It is a different tool for different tasks.\r\n\r\nThe Remix Tools essentially
    allow to scale glyphs while avoiding the nasty side effects that mess up stroke
    characteristics. This may not sound very exciting at first but it saves a great
    deal of time."

    diagonals. I notice that manual features and H (for clarity I understand).\r\n\r\nThank

    as to which of the windows/pallettes has the focus. It may be worth clicking on
    the respective window (Font Window for Scaler and Monospacer; Glyph Window for
    the Tuner) once more before running the macro in order to make sure that window
    really has the focus."

  body: "Terrance:\r\n<cite>Do you make a separate font for SC, alternates, etc.,
    or do you use OpenType coding?</cite>\r\n\r\nNowadays these things would typically
    be implemented as OpenType features. If you use \"add suffix\" in the RMX Scaler
    this automatically generates the new glyphs such as small caps as copies in the
    same font.\r\n\r\nIn case you know that the application you use the fonts in does
    not support the necessary OpenType feature you may still want to use the \"old-fashioned\"
    system of putting the small caps or alternates into a separate font. \r\n\r\nAdam

  body: "Malcolm, do you mean the Ek module of the Ikarus system? The interesting
    thing is that the underlying system is radically different. Ikarus \"knows\" what
    stems are, and therefore preserves them. RMX has, to put it bluntly, not much
    idea what stems are. The whole power comes from the designed bold. One system
    cannot do without special hints, the other one needs a bold.\r\n \r\nI made a
    comparison between the results of the Ek module and the RMX tools.\r\n \r\nThis
    is the unscaled version, which I show here so you can see which of the differences
    in the condensed stem from the slightly different input shapes:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Leipziger_regular_5226.gif]\r\n\r\ntop:
    Ikarus, bottom: OpenType\r\n \r\n\r\nThis one is automatically condensed:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Leipziger_condensed_5741.gif]\r\n\r\ntop:
    Ikarus, bottom: Font Remix Tools\r\n\r\n \r\nThe results are surprisingly similar.
    However, I believe the results of the Remix Tools are better because the horizontal
    proportions are not chosen by an intelligent program but are influenced by the
    rhythm of black and white found in the manually designed bold. I like the overall
    rhythm of the RMX version better, although the g is somewhat too narrow. With
    the help of the RMX Tuner it is very easy to quickly and intuitively adjust the
    width of individual letters, though."
