body: Hi All, I just discovereed this forum recently, I love it!  <BR> <BR>I started
  this font a while back, later discovered it was  too thin/weak for screen use. Looks
  acceptable printed out but no smaller than 24pts. <BR> <BR>I want to improve it,
  thinking of making it bolder for starters and making upppercase and numbers. Its
  based on the chinese Sung-Ti typeface &#40;last 4 characters in attachment&#41;
  <BR> <BR>I&#39;d love some advice and critique.  <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>Thanks!

  body: It&#39;s a very nice start. The letters that stand out to me as far as needing
    improvement are the &#34;x&#34; and &#34;v&#34;. The x is too fussy and the v
    is not strong enough in form &#40;too &#34;u&#34; like&#41;. <BR> <BR>Also, overall,
    you may want to incorporate more of the original lettering&#39;s weight modulation
    and curves.  <BR> <BR>Otherwise, looks cool. It&#39;s a lot more elegant than
    some imitation chinese/japanese fonts that try too hard to look like their ancestors.

  body: Thanks Matthew, I feel the same way about the x. I&#39;ll take your advice
    on the v, weight modulation and curves. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m also thinking of adding
    some extra strokes to the letters, so as to make it feel more like chinese. <BR>
    <BR>Thanks again! &#40;in mandarin thats Sie-sie ni&#41; =&#41; <BR>
