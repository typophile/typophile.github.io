  inspired by \"moroccan mosaic green\", the roman laurel wreath and the arab union
  flag. I used live trace on a photoshop image, so it's really ugly when zooming in.
  And I'm not good at all using the pen in illustrator. \r\n\r\nIs it possible that
  you could help me with the vector graphic? I will send you the .AI and a symbolic
  sum of money if you decide to help me.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about the font and
  the tracking/kerning?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any help."

    instead of asking someone for the help. That will help you for the long run. Just
    try it yourself and you will find comfort in few days. And if you are not a designer,
    its better to hire someone.\r\n\r\nI found \"Guedira\" too tight and big compared
    to that symbol."

  body: "How will that wreath look when it is reduced to fit on a business card logo?
    Still recognizable as such? A company I worked for (not a design place) used a
    circuit board pattern as roots of a tree. \r\n\r\nIt looked great when the tree
    was 18 inches tall, as it probably was in the original presentation, but it looked
    like a blob on the business cards, envelopes, and letterhead. Even on the web
    pages, which is a sin for a tech company.\r\n\r\nMy point: Be careful about using
    complex elements in your design."

  body: "Honestly, I think it's a bit tight. And the wreath is...disconnected? Yea,
    it's doesn't match up with it at all. It seems like you just threw it on for the
    hell of it. \r\nIncrease the tracking just a small bit on Guedira...actually...try
    just increasing the kerning between the G and u.\r\nI think that may make it just
    a bit easier to read.\r\n\r\nHave you tried a more stylized wreath? That wreath
    is too generic...and I'm not totally sure, but I think I saw a similar wreath
    in a business card gallery book I have...\r\nI'm not too sure what to do about
    the wreath though...it just feels too thrown on to me...\r\nAh...could be just
    me, anyone else think so?\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTrying

  body: "OK Fernando, get ready because I'm known for not being extremely nice when
    criticizing.\r\n\r\nMy personal opinion is that this logo is very poor. The juxtaposition
    of two similar G's side by side is making my eyes bleed. I read gguedira. The
    typeface is way too tightly spaced, it's the kind of type you shouldn't play too
    much with. Also, if it is, as I think I understand, a logo for a graphic designer,
    it is really pretentious, with the wrath imagery and the Garamond and everything...
    Especially now that I can realize how good you are with vector, I think that to
    show off with such a logo is like shooting yourself in the foot. \r\n\r\nMy advice,
    if you are even remotely interested in it: either go extreme in the traditional
    / baroque / napoleonian imagery, in order to express a safety distance / second
    degree (center the symbol above the name, compose in heavy fraktur, etc), or go
    safe and humble and give up the wrath and serif, think modern and simple.\r\n\r\nI
    hope i didnt discourage you,\r\n\r\ndr"
