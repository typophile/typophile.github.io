  body: Ooooh yes. Thorn is commonly preceded or followed by just about any common
    consonants used in the Icelandic language. Eth is somewhat more limited in the
    consonants it usually follows, but not by much.

  body: "I had a bit more time to check on the constraints on the consonants that
    can precede eth. In modern Icelandic, by far the consonant that most frequently
    precedes eth is \"r\", as \"r\xF0\" is a very common combination. You also find
    \"f\" and \"g\" in front of eth in some words, but other consonants seem to be
    rare.\r\n\r\nIn Old Norse, you find many more different consonants preceding eth.
    I just checked a single Old Norse text, the <em>[[http://www.heimskringla.no/wiki/Gylfaginning|Gylfaginning]]</em>,
    and came up with the following in addition to \"r\xF0\", \"f\xF0\", and \"g\xF0\":\r\n\r\n\"k\xF0\"
    as in \"\xFE\xF6k\xF0\"\r\n\"l\xF0\" as in \"dval\xF0ist\"\r\n\"m\xF0\" as in
    \"\xF3s\xE6m\xF0\"\r\n\"n\xF0\" as in \"leyn\xF0\"\r\n\"p\xF0\" as in \"steyp\xF0ist\"\r\n\r\nThe
    eth is usually replaced in modern Icelandic spelling for these words.\r\n\r\nI
    also checked the text of <em>[[http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Beowulf|Beowulf]]</em>
    and found 100+ instances of \"r\xF0\" as well as:\r\n\r\n\"c\xF0\" as in \"brec\xF0a\"\r\n\"f\xF0\"
    as in \"Gif\xF0um\"\r\n\"g\xF0\" as in \"m\xE6g\xF0\"\r\n\"h\xF0\" as in \"f\u01E3h\xF0\"\r\na
    text fragment containing \"l\xF0\"\r\n\"m\xF0\" as in \"nym\xF0e\"\r\n\"n\xF0\"
    as in \"c\u0113n\xF0u\"\r\n\r\nAlso, don't forget that in all these languages
    (modern Icelandic, Old Norse, and Old English) \"y\" is a vowel and that it also
    commonly precedes eth."

  body: "In the modern languages, the thing is that AFAIK both Icelandic and Faroese
    (which also uses the eth and thorn) can form compound words; so assuming eths
    and thorns can occur at the start & end of words, it's probably hard to limit
    the possible combinations. Yes, even the dreaded \"f\xF0\" exists :-)"

  body: In modern Icelandic, eth does not commonly occur at the beginning of a word,
    which is why I needed to do research about possible consonant+eth combinations.
    Otherwise, as Nina suggested, because many words begin or end with thorn and many
    words end with eth, these kinds of combinations are quite common.

    with consonants. I was a little confused by what I saw in some existing designs
    and since I don\u2019t know the first thing it seemed best to ask."
