		<div class="commentbody">I agree with most of John Hudson say, as usual in fact, and others too. Its good also that this kind of discussion can happen inside ATypI, and outside ATypI. The main problem for us is that ATypI is somewhat democratic organisation, and its not because one board member or simple member have a good idea, suggestion &ndash; that this idea, view, suggestion can be accepted by all the association and used. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->With the experience of how the association worked over the year, everything take time, and strong dedication. I will say that the association is clearly very open, not as AGI for example (I hope to don't do mistake on this comparison in similar area?) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Just take as example that I am member from 10 years now, ok, far&hellip;, but 10 years ago, I know nobody at all on Type scene, and less than 4 years after, they trusted enough me to propose to organise an annual conference, pffuf, and  then I was elected to the board. What I mean, its like that for many people on the board and member these days. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I truly remember Jason Smith (<!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.fontsmith.com">www.fontsmith.com</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->) in 1998, looklike another new young guy on the scene when I meet him in 1998. This year, he wanted to participate more, and he was elected on the board too. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ATypI seems to work like United Nation in some way (Maxime Zhukov surely know better than me UN), without the money (I don't say that UN is rich as MS). More in a sens that anybody is accepted to some limit, the limit who let ATypI survive (yes, its our main question behind all my comments these days). Any idea take long long time to be achieved. Example, the new website&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This new website story started in Copenhagen (2001) after several years where website was discussed with not real effect. Some of us came to the idea to try to make it more open and democratic, less centralised. So, the website seems a good idea to give more power to the members, a tool who help people to share information, to post news and so on, as Typophile, typographi.ca who do it perfectly from a while now. Etc. So, rather than just an exchange of ideas during board meeting, at Copenhagen, then 1 year more for more discussion &ndash; I proposed to set up a group of people to discuss with concrete proposal for it and comeback to the 2nd board at the end of Copenhagen conference. The idea was accepted, great, and the board decided that the new web site will became a major issue to which we need to spend some money. Ok, good. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Months and months after, nothing really happened, all are in various places on the world, so&hellip; difficult &ndash; but in last May, I offered my small place in Malakoff, for a board meeting in Paris (ok, surbubs of it), and Mark Barrat came with some proposals, tools, plan to run it, etc. Then, the money became problematic at ATypI, at the same time, so the early idea to paid some people for this huge huge, work disappeared suddenly. :-( <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But Mark Barrat was a a good guy, and he take over the complete job rather than to follow an outside guy paid by ATypI under his direction. No more money, ok, Mark Barrat done it himself. He was so great. Always positive. And now, we have a new tool, a great free tool done a dedicate member. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What I try to explain is how ATypI work, as any associations, I pretty sure Sota, a great new local US association, have some difficulties too, but they are at who seems a more small level, and they bring news ideas, less cost, etc. They achieved something who is already an institution now I think. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, perhaps, in the future, ATypI membership will be tailored country by country, guy by guy? Who know? The guyd who want this solution, need to work harder to make it reality, came to ATypI, be board member, discuss, came with plans, reliable plans, that anybody need to accept because its seems very good, and then, the democracy will do it as he suggested couple of years, couple of months before. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Any action, in association, particularly Worldwide one need time, dedication. You can</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yves asks: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->what is the current demographic of ATypI?<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have asked the ATypI secretariat to provide this information, since I want to run some numbers. I have a sampling of GNI per capita information for a number of countries in which I know ATypI has members (see below), but would like to extend my analysis to an accurate picture of the association. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->GNI per capita is not a perfect unadjusted indicator for this purpose, but it is probably the best we have. There are, of course, obvious problems, especially when looking at countries with very large populations of mainly poor people (e.g. India); anyone who is likely to be a member of ATypI is obviously making very much more money than most of the population, so the GNI per capita figure is too low an indicator. There's not much one can do about this; the indicator could be adjusted by the country's poverty rate, but too many nations do not publish statistics on the latter. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I believe the greatest concentrations of ATypI members are in Western Europe and the USA, which is also where its activities have tradtitionally taken place. This is mainly due to the historical circumstances of the industry that originally gave birth to the association. Since that industry no longer exists, it is time for the association to find ways to extend its activities into other parts of the world. I believe that the membership needs to drive this; that is, we need to foster membership internationally <!-- raw HTML omitted -->before<!-- raw HTML omitted --> we can extend activity beyond Europe and North America. It would be great to see an ATypI conference take place in South America, or in Asia, but we need to develop the membership in these places first. Since there are people in countries like Argentina that desperately want to belong to the association, it would be foolish indeed for ATypI not to consider how this might be facilitated. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sampling of GNI per capita (WB Atlas method) for some countries in which ATypI has members or in which individuals have expressed interest in membership: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Argentina 6,960 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Canada 21,340 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Czech Republic 5,270 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->France 22,690 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Germany 23,700 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->India 460 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Israel 16,710 (for 2000) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Italy 19,470 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Japan 35,990 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lebanon 4,010 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Netherlands 24,040 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Poland 4,240 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Russia 1,750 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Spain 14,860 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->USA 34,870 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->United Kingdom 24,230 <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->[All figures 2001 unless noted.

Belonging to a professional association is often a legal requirement (especially for doctors, lawyers, etc.); obviously this is not the case with ATypI, but I would still not classify membership as a luxury. Being able to spend my money on truffles while my colleagues in other countries are struggling to feed their families is a luxury. Being able to financially support and take an active role in an association such as ATypI is something closer to a privilege, especially if one can, through that association, do anything at all to help one's less fortunate colleagues.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">random thought: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Alot of associations have no problems freely inviting aspiring and influencials just as University's hand out degrees, doctrines ect. to celebrity figures simply to have them on the alumni.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Why not just have a test, an essay, interview (ok not that cheesy) but some manner of attesting how valuable the applicant would be to the Org, and a  fee/score ratio. Higher the score, cheaper the fee. Then you rid yourself of racial/demographic problems and can easily attain the brightest.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Obviously the brightest have had to spend tons already on education. Let the dabblers, beginners, and socialites pay the big fee, if they want to pay less - they have to prove themselves, what they've learned, accomplished and can offer to the Org.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Then you'll truely have an Elitist org, in a good way&hellip;of the Mensa genre. Isin't that the point anyway, I'm sure money wasn't the in the bizplan for ATypI <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">just to clarify my thought. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It seems the underlying issue here isin't the value of the ATypI membership&hellip;but the member's value to ATypI <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Should be based on the brain, not demographics or a base fee at all.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->They don't hand out diplomas simply for paying your way. Which seems to be the sort of accrediation ATypI sponsors. See, I could buy one for the 6yr old I look after, would ATypI benefit or be useful with a conference seating children? get my drift?

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant its easy: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ATypI has a Board does it not? Either way. They (or they form a Evaluation board) grade the tests. The tests are sent to realiable diplomatic co-ordinators a.k.a&hellip;a University in the area, community center, police/ gov. station ect. to be completed in the company of said reliable person then returned to ATypI offices for grading. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My suggestion also works to prove how valuable ATypI is as an organization. The goal of the Org should be to keep profits down to 0. Otherwise, ATypI isin't providing much of a resource is it? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I.E. ATypI produces a typography dictionary. How valuable is that to a beginner = very$. How valuable is that to Hrant = $0. So they pay membership according to how valuable ATypI is to them and vice-versa. ATypI benefits and keeps its resources top-notch because it has top-notch participating members (who wouldn't produce a typography dictionary) again because it was cheap to get them because they are experts and ATypI recognizes that. If ATypI is making a profit its because they only have&hellip;umm&hellip; stupid members perpetuating stupid resources that they aren't studying very well. If ATypI works on a 0 budget, its priceless. Perpetuating priceless information to stimulate priceless people. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->With a Board, also comes the Annual Report of which has that budget and revenue line. ATypI becomes accountable to its members. If they see profits are too high maybe they'd cancel that membership <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In the end either way ATypI GETS Elitist and should aim to BE Elitist. Elitist isin't a bad thing. If they need extra cash for any reason then they should solicit the socialites, beginners and wotnot in order to re-fuel the bank AND its membership porfolio (considering it should need to enrich the laymen and turn them into experts at some point) o.k. that's enough, back to my beer. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Perhaps the anglo-centric attitude of AtypI is another indication of cultural elitism (as opposed to professional elitism, which can be a good thing).  If it's going to be &quot;international&quot;, perhaps it should be more accessible to other languages, cultures, and income brackets.  If not, just call it the Anglo-Elite Typographic Association. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->From what I've seen on the Internet, Latin Americans could be making great contributions to typography.
