  some research and I have found some resources, but I am unsure of their quality.\r\nBasically
  what I am looking is to see variations of the \"ch\" low-consonant, and also to
  see different designs of quality thai fonts.\r\n\r\nI know that my computer uses
  Thonburi, (as a system font for thai?)\r\nbut are they other thai system fonts on
  a Mac?\r\nAre there any big OT fonts that include THAI characters?\r\nDoes anyone
  know of good THAI font or thai foundries?\r\n\r\nThanks for any comments or thoughts
  you ay have.\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nGio."

  body: "Gio,\r\n\r\nLinotype offers two Thai typefaces, both in OpenType format,
    and each with a Regular and Bold weight. These typefaces were only recently upgraded
    to OpenType format and re-released. In the digital photocomposition days of about
    two decades past, these fonts were used by all sorts of Thai publications. I suspect
    that Thai readers are still quite familiar with them.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/256569/sukothai-family.html\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/256576/sirichana-family.html\r\n\r\nBy
    clicking on one of the fonts, you can surf along to a glyph map, and examine each
    letter in some degree of detail (like <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/256572/sukothairegular-charactermap.html\">this</a>.
    If you know the Unicode value for the ch, it shouldn't be too difficult to spot.\r\n\r\nIt
    is my understanding that Adobe InDesign CS3 supports Thai OT fonts now, although
    I don't know if the software can offer correct hyphenation or spell check. Linotype's
    Thai OT fonts probably work as well as any others in basic Microsoft apps, too."

  body: "I did a pitch for monsoon wines who are  a thai wine company a while ago
    to help them launch into the UK market and we managed to find 2 thai fonts that
    were free I think one was called 2006_iannnnnnISO and the other was sefer_ah which
    both worked on macs\r\n\r\nI still have the sefer one if you want me to email
    it over.  We had no idea about thai type so I ended up spending a few days with
    my head in various thai design books which was interesting.  Ive attached the
    design that was intended to go on the inside of the wine box that you open up
    for you \r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://img.photobucket.com/albums/v57/lazcook/Insideofboxartwork_webready.jpg"

  body: "Try googling BehaviourGroup.com, a Bangkok-based company; I came across a
    pdf font sample sheet last year that showed a bunch of their recent Thai fonts,
    some of which were very nice, some of which were traditional shapes and some more
    modern, including pixel fonts. Sorry I can't remember the link :)\r\nI'd be interested
    to see what other members here come up with!"
