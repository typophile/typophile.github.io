  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a graphic design university student going into my final year and have chosen to do my dissertation on the use of typography in architecture.</p>
<p>Most of the resources on this topic focus on signage or wayfinding systems, but I would like to look at buildings where typography is much more integral to the overall design; this could be as part of the actual building (such as the wales millennium centre) or separate but in a way that really adds to the overall impact of the design.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m struggling to find good examples of this, especially in the UK where I stand a better chance of being able to talk to architects/typographers involved in the project – I&rsquo;m appealing for suggestions please! I know there are a couple of other posts in this forum related to this and I&rsquo;ve already checked the references out. REally helpful but I jsut need more examples really</p>
<p>Any suggestions of buildings that use typogrpahy or related resources would really be appreciated, thanks!</p>

It is a clear concrete building with a glass surface. And in this glass there are hundreds and thousands of little signatures »lentoskunstmuseum« seen, which give the glass structure a translucent feeling. At the empty spaces the word LENTOS is formed. At night the glass is highlighted with different coloured lamps, so the building is shining violet, green and red (if I remember the colours correctly)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>wow, thanks everyone! This is all really useful stuff. It brings up some interesting questions that I&rsquo;ve been trying to work out myself too e.g. where does the line come between type that is truly integrated with the building and type that is just an addition? At first I thought I&rsquo;d just assume that if the type is &lsquo;part of the building&rsquo; e.g. carved into it, then it&rsquo;s integrated, but I think it&rsquo;s more complex than that – loads of old buildings have engraved letters that don&rsquo;t really make much impact on the design and then you&rsquo;ll find a building that has type effectively as a sign stuck onto it, such as Fukutake House suggested by satya, but the type is much more integral to the overall design. Any thoughts?</p>
<p>If people are interested here are some of the best examples I&rsquo;ve found so far:
OXO tower, Wales Millennium Centre, TVAM building in Camden, Milan Polytechnic College, Graduate House of Toronto University, ESISAR school of engineering in France, South African Constitutional Court. I&rsquo;ve also happened across some mentions of Fortunato Depero who seemed to be part of a futurist movement and designed structures/buildings that were entirely type for advertising purposes, but I haven&rsquo;t been able to find much information on him. Does anyone know anything about him?</p>
<p>The Steingruber Alphabet suggestion is really interesting – I&rsquo;ll definitely be looking into this more! As for Nicolete Gray, I agree; she is definitely the main source of writing on this subject. I&rsquo;ve found her book Lettering on Buildings, which I think includes most of the articles Iore mentions, as well as Alan Bartram&rsquo;s Lettering in Architecture and Jock Kinneir&rsquo;s Words and Buildings. A few other books are slightly related but those are the best I&rsquo;ve found so far. Does anyone know of any more recent books on the subject? The most recent of these is 1980 and using typography and architecture has become a lot more common in the last few years I think?</p>
<p>Sorry for the length of this post!</p>

<p>And you want exteriors, not interiors, right? If not, you could look at the Toronto subway, about which I have written a word or two.</p>
<p>Right off the top of my head I can think of buildings in Toronto with let’s call them extruding or protruding metal letters that are clearly intended to be “architectural.” One set of such letters is, of course, in Arial.</p>
<p>If you want a literal building-as-sign as comparison, Google the BMW building by the DVP on Sunlight Park in Toronto.</p>
<p>I could go on. Hit me up directly for more.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><cite>OK, Megmog, you want current or recent stuff only, right, not historical?</cite>
Yep that&rsquo;s right, I&rsquo;ll look into the historical stuff as background but I really want to concentrate on more recent developments, see if there are any trends emerging etc. I&rsquo;ve got the books you talk about in your blog so found it pretty interesting!</p>
<p><cite>And you want exteriors, not interiors, right?</cite>
Again, I might look at a couple of interiors as sort of background, but I am definitely concentrating on exterior. Most of the interior uses of typography in buildings that I&rsquo;ve found are just wayfinding systems on a larger scale, which is a whole other topic that an undergraduate dissertation doesn&rsquo;t really have the word count for!</p>
<p>In the pics I found for the BMW building in Toronto it used images but not typography, and I really need to look at <strong>typography</strong> in architecture. Like with the interiors/exteriors I need to focus otherwise it&rsquo;ll be too big a topic if I start looking at general graphics on buildings too.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help Joe.</p>

<a href="http://www.adobe.com/designcenter/thinktank/livingskins/">http://www.adobe.com/designcenter/thinktank/livingskins/</a></p>
<p>In his article are some sophisticated thoughts about the <cite>role</cite> of type in architecture but he does not go into detail about the actual typography. And he is right because his thoughts are independent of the typographic details.</p>
<p>I also thought about writing my dissertation about typography and architecture and found that this is the main problem: Some people treat the architectural role of type while (rightly) ignoring the details. Others, like those who write about lettering, care about the actual letter shapes but not (or only superficially) about the architectural context. At least, I haven&rsquo;t found anything.</p>
<p>If you manage to actually <cite>connect</cite> both on a sophisticated level that would be ground breaking and very impressive as far as I am concerned.</p>

<p>Another thing that is quite interesting in terms of &lsquo;bad examples&rsquo; is looking at buildings that have changed their use since the type was originally done. There&rsquo;s a department store in Reading that still has &lsquo;Heelas&rsquo;, its old name, embedded in the brick. It&rsquo;s an argument against using typography that is more integral to the building perhaps, although in a way it&rsquo;s quite interesting as it shows the building&rsquo;s history&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi megmog,</p>
<p>I have just started my MPhil/PhD by project at the Department of Architecture of the Royal College of Arts and my topic is exactly the same as yours. I call it &lsquo;Typotecture: typographic elements applied to architectural design&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I started carrying out research on it while I was doing my undergraduate studies in Greece (5 years ago). At that period, I tried to define typotecture, record and analyse its history with emphasis to contemporary examples (using many of the ones listed above) and evaluate it. At the RCA, my intention is to develop it further, especially in practice using current digital tools (scripting, 3d modeling, rapid prototyping).</p>
<p>In my opinion, one of the &lsquo;good examples&rsquo; of typotecture - maybe the best - is the Marion Cultural Centre in Australia (last picture), where the boundaries between typography and architecture become blurred. It is one of the few cases where a visitor trying to read the name (semantics) of the building ends up reading the structure of it.</p>
<p>As you have already noticed, the information for this subject is limited and fragmentated, but this should be a reason for you to continue and not be frustrated!</p>
<p>Keep up the research!!!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be in touch!</p>

<p>Reminds me also of the monolithic Arsenal letters at the Emirates Stadium at Ashburton Grove used as a meeting point and creates a sense of welcome.

<p>The Hackney Empire extension is a great one as the block letters seem to float in the air in front of the south elevation as you view from Mare Street.

<p>It&rsquo;s striking, but I question the decision to make the motto read only horizontally, with the rows offset at random, so that all you can see on the vertical towers from any vantage point is gibberish. I would have used a one-step pattern like so:
<code>
NONPLUSULTRA
ONPLUSULTRAN
NPLUSULTRANO
PLUSULTRANON
LUSULTRANONP
USULTRANONPL
SULTRANONPLU
ULTRANONPLUS
LTRANONPLUSU
TRANONPLUSUL
RANONPLUSULT
ANONPLUSULTR

		<div class="commentbody"><p><em>&hellip;the relationship of lettering and building.</em></p>
<p>Nicolette Grey makes many architectural allusions in <em>Nineteenth Century Ornamented Typefaces</em>, comparing the type design trends in different decades of the 19th century with contemporary trends in architecture. She benchmarks type design against architecture, more so than art, literature or music.
Her book is in fact a history of 19th century english type design in general, not just ornamental types. As a cultural analysis of the plastic values of type style, I know of no better work.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi,</p>
<p>My name is Patirck Neuschafer and i am Multimedia Design student of the American University of Sharjah, in the UAE.</p>
<p>I have been always interested in interdisciplinary work and especially in integrating typography with architecture, i am right now righting an research paper on typography and architecture where i am asking: whether pillars in architecture can become more than just structure, whether typography could influence by using its letter forms to enhance the overall meaning of a building. Giving more than just applying ornaments on the external shell.</p>
<p>It would be very nice if any one could help me out, especially to get sources for my research paper that would help me to argue this point. I need not only websites for references also books, articles journals, existing works and examples architects.</p>
<p>I believe this new Typotecture as described earlier is a brake through in design and architecture, giving a new level of branding to it.</p>
<p>Thanks&hellip;.</p>
