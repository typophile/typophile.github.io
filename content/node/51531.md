  script font in particular [[http://www.johnlewis.com/jl_assets/catalogue/08_xmas_giftbook.jpg|cover
  thumbnail]] - sorry this image is so small - I will scan my hardcopy if I get a
  chance.\r\n\r\nIt has a similar retro feel to coquette by Mark Simonson\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any help from UK based typophiles.\r\n"

  body: I think Dan is right. Though probably the <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/type_o_tones/memimas_bold/?sample_text=Christmas%20&sample_size=96">Bold</a>
    weight.
