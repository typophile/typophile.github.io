body: ' Right, I recently started with Flash, so my knowledge of it leaves much to
  be desired. <BR> <BR>because regular anti-aliased fonts don&#39;t give the right
  feel to the design, I turned my head towards pixelfonts, but also those I found
  far from being my choice.  <BR> <BR>The only solution that I found satisfying was
  using html text Verdana. <BR> <BR>&#91;insert laughter and possible insults&#93;
  <BR> <BR>right, is there a pixelfont which comes incredibly close to the html/anti
  aliased version of Verdana at font size=&#34;2&#34; ? <BR> <BR>Thanks for your patience

    <BR>I wish there were. It would help the HTML and  <BR>Flash elements of a site/page
    integrate better. '
