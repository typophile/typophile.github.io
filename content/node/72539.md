body: "Dear readers,\r\n\r\ni am wondering how to best handle case sensitive punctuation
  (opentype CASE feature) and kerning of these characters with uppercase letters.
  Depending on the vertical position of the character (let's say \"{\"), the horizontal
  kerning has to change too to make everything look well alligned.\r\n\r\nI can imagine
  of these solutions (working with fontlab 5):\r\n\r\n- kern as if CASE was always
  applied (looks ugly if the user just types with capslock)\r\n\r\n- kern as if CASE
  was never applied (often looks bad just when it should actually look good)\r\n\r\n-
  fiddle with the horizontal pos values in CASE feature - but it would mean to change
  them for every possible combination manually - lots of work ...)\r\n\r\n- make duplicates
  (or even design special) \"{.case\" variants, just do substitutions in CASE feature,
  and do kerning with these variants instead of the lowercase ones. This would work,
  but doubles glyphs and is quite \"not as it was meant\". \r\n\r\n\r\nso what do
  you think is best practice for this?\r\n\r\ntanks for your input\r\nSebastian"

    kern all CASE punctuation with all Capital forms and numerals.\r\n\r\nSet up pairs
    when you can."

  body: So you create special .case puctuation glyphs for that (or at least create
    a copy of the normal ones)?

  body: I have additional glyphs for punctuation to uppercase and small caps. Petite
    caps uses the same normal punctuation. In most cases these glyphs are copy of
    normal ones, just vertically repositioned and with different spacing. Sometimes
    the glyph is also a bit edited to match UC and SC height. Using proper spacing
    may avoid the need to special kerning in most glyphs.

  body: "Yeah, .case glyphs that are just repositioned vertically and like Igor said,
    depending on the type style maybe edited even more.\r\n\r\nThen I have a separate
    kerning text file that has all punctuation forms replaced with, say /parenleft.cap
    hyphen.cap etc.\r\n\r\nIt's easy to do just using Find/Replace in a text editor
    and doesn't take long to get through the kerning for the case feature"

  body: "I make alternate punctuation characters, e.g. \"parenleft.case\".\r\n\r\nBut
    I try not to overdo it, and now put a lot less kerning in fonts than I used to.\r\nFor
    instance, if you kern a raised hyphen with capitals, PART-TIME will look like
    shit, because there will be a huge space between R and T, and the two T arms will
    be bumping, with the hyphen jammed up underneath them. \r\n\r\nThe side bearings
    of a hyphen are part of the character."

  body: "so let's go boost glyph count by creating .case variants :)\r\nand if i have
    to create copies anyway, i can also adjust shapes if it doesn't fit perfect.\r\n\r\nthanks
    for the input.\r\n"

    for caps is not a problem, but what do I do to activate case sensitive forms?

  body: You can add the case sensitive punctuation to classes with small caps and
    use those for the c2sc or smcp features. I don't typically create them for ALL
    cap setting, but then I don't generally work on text fonts.

    .case punctuation to go with a case feature. I got some advise at TypeDrawers.\r\n\r\nWhy
    don't you include them for all the caps setting?"

  body: My Caps are typically not designed for all cap settings. If I did general
    text fonts that would be more logical to include them. I might have done that
    in one font DeSoto. I added small caps to some upright script fonts like Baghadeer
    and Raniscript.

    of Baghadeer be raised though?\r\n\r\nPerhaps you can help me. Nick mentioned
    on TypeDrawers that I should make classes for the default and alternative glyphs
    and implement the following:\r\nsub @case_default by @case_alts ;\r\n\r\nI made
    the classes but I don't know where to implement that line. I thought I would ask
    here as well, as the sooner I know how to implement this the better."

  body: "If you are using the case feature to sub a lower positioned punctuation mark
    with a higher punctuation mark then you can add this directly into the case feature.
    Be sure the order and count of each class is an exact match. Otherwise you'll
    get some puzzling results. I'm not sure how the case feature is supported in Adobe
    apps. It's not listed as a feature. You might consider using it with some sort
    of contextual substitution.\r\n\r\nYou could do something like: \r\nsub @Caps
    @case_default' by @case_alts;"

  body: It's activated in Adobe apps when you choose the "All Caps" OpenType style
    from the pop-up menu in the corner of the Character palette. Also, the normal
    "All Caps" option (Command-Shift-K/Ctrl-Shift-K or "TT" toolbar button) in InDesign
    activates it.
