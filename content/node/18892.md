  body: Wow, I never made that connection, funny. I don't see why a record company
    called "apple corps" is threatened by "apple computer" even though apple now has
    itunes, they are merely selling music, not producing it themselves, and really
    there isn't any competition between the two companies (that I can see). The lawsuit
    is really about the use of the word "apple" which seems generic enough that no
    one company can "own" it. It will be interesting to see how this turns out.

  body: iTunes has a very limited catalog of Beatles music, doesn't even scratch the
    surface. But still, isn't there a difference between producing music and selling
    music? So, apple corps wants to stop apple computer from selling music, but apple
    corps would receive royalties from every song sold, just as they would from any
    other retailer. The dispute is over the word "apple" which is ridiculous to me.
    Nobody could have forseen the internet becoming the source of music distribution
    that it has become back in the 70's. WIth 3 million songs being sold daily that
    is a great channel for bands and artists to sell their music, and make an income.

    as a recording label, they just manage the business of royalties on old music
    from the Beatles era.  Apple Computer is not cutting into their slice of the pie
    or taking their customers or giving the impression that they represent the Beatles
    estate. It makes me wonder if this is a PR move to keep the old record label name
    alive. Today's young record buying clientele may not even know about Apple Records
    without the law suit pushing it into the news.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    Computer wanted the hip and joyful image of the Beatles to rub off on them, and
    paid for it, with the explicit caveat that they wouldn't use it in the music business.
    \r\n\r\nIronically, that deal turned out to be a major source of income for the
    Beatles. But then the Beatles were ripped off by their own business partners back
    in the day. Now, so many years later Apple Computer is in the music business.
    There isn't a lot of logic in it, but a contract is a contract. If they want to
    change it they should re-negotiate it. \r\n\r\n"

    feel for you, Apple. I imagine your products wouldn't be so prohibitively expensive
    if you didn't slip up and get slammed every few years by Apple Records, a company
    whose business used to be producing Beatles albums, but is now chiefly in the
    business of leeching your profits with litigation every time you do something
    even remotely related to music. I think it's unfair.\r\n\r\nSo I have a perfect
    solution for you. <em>Change the name of your company</em> and then you'll be
    able to do whatever you want. To some, this would seem like a rash thing to have
    to do when one has been in business for a long time... but I don't think that's
    a problem in this case. Just going out on a limb here, but try this on for size:
    Macintosh Computers. Not only is it a trademark you already own, but it's a brand
    that's been on <em>practically every one of your products for the past twenty
    years.</em> I think the transition would be pretty smooth, don't you?"
