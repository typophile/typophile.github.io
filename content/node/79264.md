  body: The client wants something vibrant and playful as it is only a boutique style
    hotel. I was brief with this info and just thinking a step forward in case they
    plan to expand then a re-brand wouldn't be necessary at all. Unfortunately, they
    did not consider it and what really broke my heart is when I saw the direction
    they're going to.
