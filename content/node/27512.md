body: I have been using the Bitstream Clarendon for almost 8 years, and the Adobe
  version here and there. But lately I haven't been satisfied with either. It is a
  very useful font, but the numbers in particular are clunky and dark, and the Adobe
  version is very sterile looking. Is there a better version of Clarendon that is
  perhaps more expertly drawn and has better stroke contrast, I guess sort of a display
  version? Are there any alternatives which show improvement to the original design
  without modernizing it, or is there a version acknowledged to be closest to the
  original in digital form?

    too for display.\r\n\r\nOranda can work in a similar way, although it is not a
    stand-in."

  body: Belizio is exactly what I am looking for, with the italics and everything.
    I wish it had small caps and text figures, but that wouldn't really be in the
    spirit of the design. Is Haas Clarendon available digitally?
