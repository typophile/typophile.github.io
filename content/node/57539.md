  for is if there is a term for the type design feature where certain numbers, most
  commonly 3,4,5,6,7,8 and 9, extends below the baseline or above the mean line whereas
  0, 1 and 2 stays the same size as lowercase letters? Such as in the examples in
  the attachment.\r\n\r\nIf anyone could recommend some (or a whole slew) of fonts
  with that design feature, either serif or sans serif fonts, I'd be most happy. Thanks!"

  body: "I think you're looking for Oldstyle numerals. Most professional fonts should
    have them, especially serif fonts (if you have Adobe software, you'll probably
    have at least a Garamond Premier/Adobe Garamond, Myriad, Arno, Caslon, Chaparral,
    Constantia, Consolas, Georgia (cool, didn't know that one!), Jenson, Minion...).
    Those are just from a quick scroll-through. Personally I'm quite fond of Garamond,
    Jenson, Arno, and Myriad.\r\n\r\nA more experienced type-nerd could give you more
    specialized recommendations."

  body: Bethany is right. Most text fonts contain oldstyle and lining figures. So
    I would first look for the typeface that is right for your project. <a href="http://fontfeed.com/archives/figuring-it-out-osf-lf-and-tf-explained/">More
