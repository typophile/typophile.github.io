body: "From time to time the question for suitable places for education in disciplines
  of the lettering arts arises \u2026 As for Europe, there is a rather limited choice.
  Therefore, I thought it might be worth mentioning what I came across just recently.\r\n\r\nI
  had the pleasure to meet Lieve Cornil who runs the <strong>European Lettering Institute</strong>
  in Brugge (Belgium). For those looking for graphical education this new school is
  certainly worth consideration. An emphasis is laid on the thorough development of
  \ graphical skills based primarily on manual training. Writing and other lettering
  practices are main subjects which are taught to small student groups by five professionals.\r\n\r\n\u2013>
