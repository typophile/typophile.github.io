    font, but the J is different and some more small differences.\r\nBut it looks
    quite like it :)"

  body: "Thanks that's a quite a nice group of fonts that are similar to that of the
    Tarantino trailer!\r\nBut still it isn't the font that they used maybe it is custom
    made for the movie. I like the the font because it is bit rough especially in
    size differences. :-)"

  body: Anyone know the font used in the opening and end credits? i can't find a visual
    reference anywhere. it's not like anything used in previous collateral. i really
    liked it. reminds me of a house font. of course that's assuming it wasn't custom
    made for the film.
