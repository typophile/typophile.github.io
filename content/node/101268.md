  question), and this may have been discussed in a previous thread\u2026\r\n ~~~~\r\nOver
  dinner with an (ex)photographer friend of mine we got to talking about the various
  pricing models of stock photography companies \u2014 <em>that existed at the time
  he got out of the industry c 2004</em> \u2014 and one of them was to the effect
  of \u201Cevery time a customer wanted to use this photograph, the original photographer
  got a little bit of money.\u201D\r\n\r\n<strong>Questions</strong>:\r\n1. Does such
  a pricing model exist for typefaces companies?\r\n2. What other pricing models are
  there? (not including web fonts)?\r\n3. Who uses which model(s)?\r\n\r\nWith this
  info, it should be fairly simple to create an informative matrix.\r\n\r\nThis is
  just out of personal interest. Not for research, professional, &c."

    to use most fonts we license, the original type designer gets a little bit of
    money, or more.\r\n\r\nMany type licensing companies also follow this \"royalty\"
    model for print and web fonts. \r\n\r\nThere is another model where the type licensing
    company owns the font without royalties to any designer.\r\n\r\nThe model in use
    depends on the font, in some type licensing companies, while others only license
    fonts without designer royalties involved. "
