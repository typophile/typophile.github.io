  students to use specific fonts or type settings (hurray!).\r\n\r\nThe font I'm using
  (Equity, licensed) looks great when printed and on screen, however it includes small
  caps but not small caps italics.\r\n\r\nI wanted to set my headings in small caps,
  but I have a problem:\r\nSome of my headings include the names of books, which are
  supposed to be italicized. Do you think it would be best to either: not italicize
  the book titles when included in headings\r\nor\r\nnot use small caps (so book titles
  in headings can be italicized) ?\r\n\r\nHere's an example of one of my headings
  (using all caps): THE INTERPRETATION OF <em>BOOK TITLE</em>"

  body: "The italization of the book titles might have priority over font choice,
    because this is a part of the overall typographic system for the text.\r\nThese
    are your options:\r\n\u2022 set the titles in normal Italics instead\r\n\u2022
    abandon small capitals for the headings\r\n\u2022 order italic small capitals
    font from the font producer."

  body: "If you\u2019re using all small caps for the headings, you could consider
    using all caps instead.\r\nI usually tend to avoid using italic inside roman headings.
    In a case like this I would probably set the book titles between brackets."

  body: Is it a horrible practice to pair semibold all-caps with a downsized bold
    all-caps to fake the small caps? I've done it for the title on a CD cover once
    some years ago. In this case I wouldn't recommend it, but I guess it could be
    a solution if you really need to set text in small caps and italic.

  body: "One might object because you can't retain the proportions though. Downsized
    all-caps are more condensed than small-caps, are they not?\r\n\r\nAnyway, it's
    not the most elegant solution if you need to apply this to a lot of titles. I
    would rather go for one of the options Andreas alluded to."

  body: "Either go with a font that has italic small caps (I'm surprised Equity doesn't),
    or use u&lc for the headings, or fake it, as Martin described.\r\n\r\nRegardless
    of whether the font has italic small caps, I think using small caps for headings
    of significant length, or headings that contain titles, is visually questionable.
    I would save the small caps for elsewhere and do headings u&lc."
