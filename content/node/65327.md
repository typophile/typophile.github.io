body: "hi all,\r\n\r\nI wanted share with you a project I've put quite a bit of effort
  into, especially lately. I've got my furniture design studio, The Office for Lost
  Objects\u2122, featured on Kickstarter.com, a crowdfunding site for creatives.\r\n\r\nAs
  part of the Kickstarter initiative, I commissioned some artwork which resulted in
  a limited edition series of four posters. They're archival quality Giclee prints
  (20\"x30\") on heavyweight 100% cotton Somerset Velvet (images below). They're available
  now, along with a few other items, only through Kickstarter.\r\n\r\n[[http://tiny.cc/olo|The
  Office for Lost Ojbects\u2122 x Kickstarter]]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OLO_Candy_01_TP_6628.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OLO_Candy_02_TP_6487.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OLO_Candy_03_TP_4285.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nI
  hope you will take a look, and consider supporting me. \r\n\r\nthanks!\r\nJarrod\r\n"
