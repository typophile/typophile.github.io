body: "Hi,\r\nI am turning my fonts into opentype PS and was wondering if I should
  set my encoding to MacRoman as described in \"learn Fontlab fast\" Is that the proper
  way a font should be set up? Any insight and additional info that anyone may have
  would be very helpful.\r\n\r\n:)\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n-Charles Borges de Oliveira\r\n\r\n"

    would need or is it because of compatiblity issues?\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\n\r\n-Charles\r\n"

  body: "For OpenType PS fonts, the actual encoding that is selected in FontLab Studio
    has no importance. It is only used as an overview for the character repertoire.
    So MacRoman is the necessary minimum for the glyphset that your font should include.
