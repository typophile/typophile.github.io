    best bet for free fonts still is Typophile\u2019s [[FAQ Free Fonts]]."

  body: "The site used to be pretty useful, but since it started including dubious
    clones like <a href=\"http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Sapir\">Sapir</a>*, to
    name but one example, I can\u2019t buy the \u201Chand-picked, high-quality, commercial-use\u201D
    claim anymore.\r\n\r\n*) The blurb states \u201CSapir was designed as a stop gap,
    while waiting for better, professionally designed fonts for linguiustics. But
    Sapir is different in that it combines the International Phonetic Alphabet with
    symbols for syntax and phonology.\u201D\r\n\r\nThis is lame. No design involved.
    It\u2019s just a bad clone of <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-stone-sans/stone-sans-medium/characters.htm\">Stone
    Sans</a> by [[Sumner Stone]]. And there <strong>is</strong> an <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-stone-sans/phonetic-ipa/characters.html\">IPA
    version of Stone Sans</a>.\r\n\r\nI hope Fontsquirrel gets rid off all the cheesy
    stuff."

    look at Sapir? Here are the glyphs: (<a href=\"http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~boyer/typophile/SapirSans.pdf\"><strong>pdf</strong></a>
    172K). The \"phonetic\" characters that were added don't match and the font is
    not unicode encoded. Look at the \"cedilla\" ! And that is \"hand picked\" and
    \"high quality\"... "
