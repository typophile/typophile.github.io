  font for it. it's from an industrial brochure and seems to be straight from the
  CAD software.\r\n\r\nit also reminds me a lot of a face used often in japanese video
  games (though this one is much more crude in its vector paths), if anyone knows
  of that either.\r\n\r\npeep the attached gif or take a look at the source pdf below...\r\nhttp://www.europeanthermodynamics.com/Fans&Blowers/Act-RX/arx4010.pdf\r\n\r\nmucho
  thankerz,\r\njaan"

  body: "It does seem like something very similar with something that came with some
    older (and maybe even recent) versions of Autocad.\r\nI used it many years ago.
    Look.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Italic-AC_6465.gif]"
