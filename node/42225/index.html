<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>OK, I've read with attention some Mac vs. PC posts here.
Dont want to add any other discution about it.
My question is:
Want to buy a PC laptop for graphic design/type design/multimedia development.
So I use photoshop/freehand (perhaps upgrad to illustrator...)/flash/premiere/dreamweaver.
What do "Typophile" pros use?
Brand and model...Pros and againt
Thanks in advance
Thanks

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Second, a general comment: brand and model are interesting, but key specs are at least as important. For example, I have a Lenovo ("IBM") ThinkPad T61P. But how I got that configured (screen size/resolution, memory, hard drive size) is a lot more relevant.
Generally, I recommend that you get 2 GB of RAM. Regular 32-bit Windows can't address more than 3 GB, and any less than 2 GB is a false economy for performance. If your budget is tight, you're better off getting a slower processor but still getting 2 GB of RAM. For whatever model you pick, you probably want the biggest hard drive you can reasonably afford before the prices start escalating crazily.
Related to screen size, a host of related questions: Will you be using an external monitor for most of your serious work, or will you be relying on the built-in LCD screen of the laptop most of the time? Do you have good eyesight and a high tolerance for small stuff on screen? How much What format of outlines are you likely to mainly be working on? (Which is implicitly looking for "what em square size are you likely to be working with in your type design work?")
Cheers,
T</div>

<div class=commentbody>If I understand it right you want to know what we use regardless of whether it's PC or Mac. I use a Macbook Pro 15.4" base model. 15.4 inches is getting on the big side and isn't quite as portable as I would like it to be. Whatever computer you get though, consider it an investment.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I find that the build quality of lesser known, and cheaper, brands is only so-so. People are still lugging around their old Powerbooks because they are built more tank-like, so I suggest that in addition to the specs, you also look for decent build quality.
Compared to other graphics applications, font production is fairly low in resource consumption. But Thomas' recommendations above still apply if you value your time and your sanity :)
Also, Freehand is dead.</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Over the years, I've used Sony laptops (definitely <em>not</em> recommended), Toshiba laptops (pretty good, but I had repetetive trouble with hard drives), and a Panasonic 'Toughbook' (a nice lightweight travel machine, but a bit slow). But by far the best computers I have bought have been from Dell. I have one large Dell Inspiron 9100 laptop that I've used as my main machine for the past three and a half years, and recently bought the small Dell XPS 1330 to use as a travel machine. I particularly like the customisability of Dell computers: I maximised the RAM and got the fastest CPU option for the XPS 1330, and it is blisteringly fast compared to my older Dell.
Thomas, as I understand it, 32-bit Windows only provides applications with a 3GB flat virtual address space, but kernel components will address a separate gigabyte. So 4GB is the actual limit (which is what I got in my XPS, and I hope I didn't waste money on an unused gigabyte of RAM!). But in order to provide access to the full 3GB, either the computer manufacturer or administrator needs to set the /3GB flag in the boot.ini (in pre-Vista versions of Windows)
http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms791558.aspx
or the IncreaseUserVA in BCDEdit (Windows Vista)
http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa906211.aspx
If you are buying a computer with more than 3GB of RAM, you may reasonably expect the manufacturer to set this, but you can ask them to confirm this.

doesnt really matter, like in life: size doesn't matter so much

<div class=commentbody>With any laptop, my experience is it that the extended warranty is a good investment. Dell has been good for me, but I heard they moved tech support to India, and my friend says sometimes they are hard to understand. Fortunately at my company, if your Dell laptop acts up, our contract is set so someone will come fix it in a day.
If for some reason you decide to get a Mac that can boot WIndows, everyone I know says the Applecare is a good investment.</div>

2- I will buy a PC. Not mac.
3- I know that the screen size/resolution, memory, hard drive size ar important factors that I will not forgett

<div class=commentbody>I've owned/used the following brands:
Apple: 1 great laptop. 1 decent one that crapped out after 2 years.
Dell: 1 that crapped out more than once
Toshiba: Crapped out after about two years.
Sony: Has never 'fully' crapped out, but has been on disability since day one with clicking hard drives, dead WiFi and batteries that die every 6 months.
So, uh...hmm...I don't think it matters. I'd suggest going cheap and just plan on upgrading every couple of years.
All that said, everyone seems to love their Lenovos (what used to be IBM laptops)

<div class=commentbody>Also, FYI, I assume you wanting a PC = you want to run windows. The MacBook Pro was rated as one of the fastest (if not fastest) laptop for running Vista. So, if performance is a priority, you might want to add that to your list. Alas, I appears you live outside the US, and, as such, I know Apple hardware can be significantly more expensive.</div>

Macromedia made Freehand multipage because they didn't have a pagination option. Adobe does with InDesign. AI is primarily for vector illustrations, and I don't see it becoming multi page (although perhaps a two or four page option would be nice to be able to keep front and back, or packaging options in a single file.</div>

They want you to buy InDesign. ;o)
Freehand was a really great multi-purpose tool. Had it gotten the care and attention it needed several versions back, it might have been an excellent page layout application in addition to a fine illustration tool.
I do miss Freehand.
Alas, it's dead. In fact, it's been on life support for quite a while, even when it was still in Macromedia's hands.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I use freehand for more than 13 years. It was Aldus at the time...I think
I always draw my company labels and boxes in freehand. It was great to have a file with mutiple pages. One for original other converted to paths to production, other in cmyk for other prints, and special the file with another blueprint page with regular information printed to be send in Fax or to print a copy to be sign, etc.
The fact that I could develop a logo in a page then duplicate in the same file several "directions" and print them all as independent page with the need to open extra files (and the time consuming...) are things that were with me.
Of course today I can di that with Indesign...but 12 years ago I could do it with freehand...and still do:-)

I recommend going to the Dell website, selecting a base model of the size you want, and then going through the customisation options to get the specs you want. If screen resolution is important to you, keep an eye out for the 1920x1200 screen options.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Antonio,
Though it isn't the same thing, you might like the "layers" function in Illustrator; each layer can be turned off, locked, set to print or not print, act as template, or whatever; then you can discard certain layers and save the file as a different version. I think "export visible layers" would make things easy. That might do some of what Freehand did for you. Layers are absolutely essential to working with map data.

<div class=commentbody>I switched to PC a few years ago (because I am a reactionary, OK?), so I say this not as an apple fangirl: don't go Dell for a laptop!!! Everyone I know with a Dell laptop has had it fall apart in a couple of years, and it's better to remove your eyes with a spoon than talk with their tech support. Also, it takes an awful lot to get rid of all the bloatware that comes with their computers. Spend the extra money on something with good hardware and tech support (HP? IBM? I dunno).
Right now I work exclusively on a silent PC desktop built by my boyfriend - it works like a charm, was under $1000 (including the 22" monitor), and had no bloatware. Unfortunately, that helps not at all for laptops.
Good luck!</div>

As darrel stated I dont live in US. I'm Portuguese. So here apple computers are very expensive not only to buy but also in support...
For example:
MacBook Pro 2.4GHz Intel Core 2 Duo 15 inch costs in US $2,499.00. In Portugal costs 3,532.89 !!!!!!!!! With this money I could fly to New york buy the computer and come back and probably still save some money :-)
Beth (against) and other (in favor) spoke for Dell. Dell computers are hard to find here also.
The easy and economic are HP, Sony, Acer, Asus, Fujitsu Siemens and Toshiba.

I have to check wich models have 1920x1200 screen option.

My current laptop is a Titanium Powerbook 667 and it runs very well with nary a squeak of a problem. And I know that I am not the only one who hangs on to their Powerbooks. I have never heard of a PC laptop that will be reliable and in use some seven years down the track. I fully expect mine will last for another two years, bringing it to nine years old.</div>

You did ask "what do the pros use?" One of the reasons the pros have Macs is because it helps them hike their rates. Put yourself in the shoes of a client - two designers are pitching for a job - one's charging $90 an hour and toting a four year old HP notebook, the other's charging $120 an hour and has a spanking new Mac Book Air - which would you pick? </div>

I've heard such things. But I've been using my big Dell for three and a half years without any problems, and the couple of times I needed to call tech support the service was excellent. Now, I did pay extra for a business support account, and I did choose a high-end model with the best component options. Perhaps this makes a difference.</div>

<div class=commentbody>You mentioned ASUS. They're actually quite good because they supply the parts to a lot of the "branded" laptops. Quality hardware.
In fact, if you do a little digging, a lot of the big time laptops are really re-branded something or another.
For instance, Alienware machines are in reality just a few doodads and whatsits and glowing-eyed alien cases added onto other company's hardware. Start comparing specs and Googling/newegg-ing/researching, and eventually you can find the source of the base computer.
If you can find it, many times you can save money due to the "brand" discount. Of course, you're taking a humongous risk because tech support will be non-existent or Japanese :)</div>

<div class=commentbody>"one’s charging $90 an hour and toting a four year old HP notebook, the other’s charging $120 an hour and has a spanking new Mac Book Air - which would you pick?"
Sii, if I liked them equally, I'd pick the one without the Apple premium.
If I could afford a new, awesome, Mac, I'd get one - but it would be in <em>spite</em> of it being a status symbol. My focus is on usability and communication - if a client wants me to have a trendy haircut, designer jeans, and a MacBook, it's just not gonna work out. This may also be why I can't afford a brand new Mac. ;)</div>

I wouldn't choose a designer from is computer. I prefer his work ;-)
Found this here in Portugal. Anyone has experiences with this brand?

<div class=commentbody>I was not aware Packard Bell was still in business. I have heard their hardware has a bad reputation, but that is not based on personal experience. They used to have a cute logo with a head, but it appears that they don't use it anymore.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I sold Packard Bell computers for a time when they were still available in Canada. They had a horrid return rate. Also a disaster for service.
That doesn't mean that they haven't cleaned up their act in the last 15 years.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I'm very happy with my PC notebook. It's an HP nc4010. I bought it used on eBay. These are the commercial line of notebook; think of it as a wholly different company from HP's consumer line notebooks. I've had it for nearly four years. Support is handled over the internet and mine came with a three-year warranty, standard. If you're looking for current models of these, just shop around. I believe the nc line is still going. If so, those are built the best.</div>

<div class=commentbody>António:
So, based on your reply about screens and monitors, the other key thing I'd say is that you have the same screen need I do: at least 1200 vertical pixels of resolution to be able to do type design work efficiently right on your laptop. You can get a standard-ratio screen at 1600 x 1200, or a wide-screen at 1920 x 1200. But this factor alone will likely significantly narrow your choices - which is probably helpful.
John Hudson and others are correct about RAM on PCs. I'm not saying that more than 2 GB is completely wasted, just that the biggest functional jump and bang for the buck is going from 1 GB to 2 GB. If you make heavy use of Premiere, maybe even 4 GB would be useful.
Cheers,
T</div>

<div class=commentbody>They make plenty of Dells and stuff now with the same quad-core processors that the Mac Pros use (although they use two), but in agreement with the second post, worry about the ram as well. 2gigs is fantastic. Maybe more if you're doing motion (also, a better graphics card would help). I know you don't want a mac, but my suggestions would be to look at the specs on the new mac pro, and find a PC with the same. It'd probably be about a grand less just to get rid of the apple logo.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I currently use a IBM/Lenovo Thinkpad R60 with 2ghz Core2 Duo, 2GB RAM, 7200rpm hard drive, 1400×1050px screen (a compromise between space and size), Windows XP. When working local, it's placed in a docking station, connected to a normal keyboard, mouse, large screen, scanner, external hard drive, etc.
I use it 70% local, and 30% mobile. If you are more mobile, you might want a T-series model, but the other series are quite ok as well.
Thinkpads are expensive, but much more affordable today, and they are robust, don't look like pseudo wannabe "design", but are streamlined for real usability.</div>
