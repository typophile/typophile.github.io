  body: Sports Logo = Custom <BR> <BR>They make real money on merchandise with logos
    on it. Therefore they can spend money to make it proprietary &#40;TM&#41;

  body: It sure is Nick, I took this photo at 7th ave at 108th Street going up the
    stairs to the Great Hill. Sorry to say by the end of the week it will all be gone.
    These gates are already gone.

  body: Back to the Mariners font. Yes, it&#39;s custom, as Dan said, but if you want
    to imitate it &#40;non-commercially, of course&#41;, look for Latin Serif fonts,
    like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/quadrat/spike/incised/testdrive.html?s=MARINERS&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Spike Incised</a>.

    target="_blank"> Latin</a> looks a lot like the older logo seen <a href="http://www.prizes1.com/Seattle%20Mariners%20Baseball%20Player%20Bear.jpg"
    target="_blank">here</a>.  If you add a stroke to it, it would really resemble
    the new logo in your sample.

  body: Dan - is that one of your pinhole pix? Either way it&#39;s a nice one. I&#39;ll
    miss those gates too. Sounds like you covered more of the park than I did.
