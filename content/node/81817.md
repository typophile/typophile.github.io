    font. I have a feeling this is a characteristic style of an artist from pre-digital

  body: In a way it reminds me of the classic typeface [[http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_F_uR4keiAgM/S8KmAzJTHmI/AAAAAAAAAws/MjzGzxivKsI/s1600/book-2.jpg|Bifur]],
    which had a [[http://www.haroldsfonts.com/bifur.html|Solid variant]], in which
    only the solid lines were visible. Bifur is more robust than the sample above,
    of course.
