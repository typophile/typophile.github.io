  body: Thanks everyone! <BR> <BR>Opinions about this faced used for the logotype
    of a heli tours company? Looks a little dangerous&#40;?&#41; and dated imo. Thoughts?
    <BR> <BR>Anyone know what year Dick Jensen actually designed the face?

  body: 1972 according to my trusted FontBook, that&#39;s probably why  <BR>the logo
    looks so dated, though there are exceptions because  <BR>of the resurgence of
    70s and 80s style typography.

  body: Thanks Yves. <BR> <BR>Yes, it definately reeks 70s/80s to me. Do you know
    of a more modern face which might serve to freshen up the logotype without turning
    the corporate ID on its head?
