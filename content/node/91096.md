  on the left side of the page. I apologize, for some reason it is not letting me
  attach any images and they do not have their logo on their personal webpage.\r\n\r\nI
  can't seem to identify this font. Similar to Baskerville, but not quite. The logo
  is about 5 years old. Any help is appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
