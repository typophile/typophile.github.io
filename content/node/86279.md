body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI've started to work in a new medium-sized design studio. When
  I came here all of the 4 designers before me had a few font collections based on
  a same collection. I mean they were given a font folder and then they added their
  own font's later. When I came to here I had to copy all the folders and merge them
  into one (because I was given a new computer) And when I check the fonts it the
  file it just looks like a disaster! postscripts, opentypes, truetypes they are all
  mixed up! Since I was a mac user I was prefer to choose OpenType when buying one.
  And also because of that I never intended to learn what was the technical difference.
  But now I got tons of unorganized mixed pile of fonts to use but I'm always uncortable
  when something important like this kept unorganized. so here are my questions;\r\n\r\n-
  First of all what is the best font manager program? Suitcase Fusion 3 or Fontexplorer
  X ? The studio have both licenses so the I can choose between those two. Or if you
  can advice a better one I can buy it for myself.\r\n\r\n- Will there be any corruption
  (in kerns or anything) if I convert all the fonts to opentype with a software Font
  XChange?\r\n\r\n- Most of the fonts in the collection is weirdly ungrouped in the
  management programs. I mean for example Bell Gothic has 3 families for bold regular
  and roman. And inside them their italic and regular format. But I mean come on,
  they're all Bell Gothic why are they separate families? What could have happened
  to the fonts? And how can I rearrange them in to same family tree like they supposed
  to be.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for sparing time. Oh btw english is not my naive language,
  excuse me if I've made grammar mistakes :("

    within families will get screwed up and every font will be its own family. Your
    kerning will probably be ok if you actually have good kerning files for the Postscript
    fonts to begin with. And the Truetype fonts should be left alone.\r\n\r\n<cite>Sounds
    like a case of pirated fonts.</cite>\r\n\r\nMy thoughts exactly. Start by cutting
    the entire firm down to the fonts the business has receipts for and delete everything
    else. Synchronize everyone on one small set of legit fonts, buy more as needed,
    and manage all fonts from one server instead of spreading them around.\r\n\r\nIf
    you don\u2019t nail this down now it will bite you on the ass later. Either a
    big job will get screwed up because of problems with the crazy font collection
    or somebody will notice an unlicensed font in a job and you or your client will
    get a bill, or worse, served with legal papers."

  body: "I would heap all those fonts into one folder (preferably on a separate standalone
    disk-dribe) and when a job comes around where you need a font, search that for
    the best option (pref a late version OT, Pro or Extended) and copy that to your
    workstation. That will also give you occasion to check whether it is a legally
    acquired font.\r\n\r\nTo make things easier you could make in inventory of all
    the stuff you have in the form of an automatically made specimen book. There is
    s/w to help you do that.\r\n\r\nDo NOT do your own conversions to OT. Lots of
    problems in practice, eg missing euro-signs, etc."

  body: "<cite>Sounds like a case of pirated fonts.</cite>\r\n\r\nI've asked around
    and some of them are like you guys said were pirated -_- And most of the others
    were got corrupted when they were localizing or something else. I actually stopped
    listening when I've heard they someone was <em>fiddling</em> with the original
    fonts. I'll have a talk with the studio director to legalize fonts. I prefer not
    to work rather then designing with pirated stuff. \r\n\r\nThanks everyone!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "There is A LOT to learn from working with only a few carefully selected fonts,
    as opposed to the usual scrolling-through-font-list-design. Get familiar with
    the historical classifications, what ideas informed the type designer and why
    a particular face works better in a particular situation, and you\u2019ll start
    understanding what exactly you should look for when that next project needs 6
    pt. text typeset on uncoated paper printed on an outdated laserjet from the late
    eighties. Furthermore, you\u2019ll start <em>designing</em> \u2014 not just copying
    the latest trend.\r\n\r\n(That last part is not necessarily intended for you :)"

  body: "frode frank said it better than I could. I wouldn't worry about what font
    manager to use too much, or even if you need one. Personally, I use Suitcase Fusion
    3 and keep a couple different Libraries. A 'Library' in that app is like switching
    to a completely different set of preferences. So, I have a 'Junk' library with
    unlicensed/dodgy fonts that I might occasionally refer back to to handle old projects
    or something. This is a giant list of fonts--unusable for commercial design work.
    I also have a 'Production' library, which is the fonts I'm likely to use on a
    day-to-day basis. Its still more fonts than I want active all the time, and I
    like Suitcase's features for organizing them. \r\n\r\nDisclaimer: I don't work
    for Extensis, but I used to. "

    I never got the chance -I mean guts- to ask something like this to her before.
    I think I''ll ask this detail to you; are there any specific typeface''s that
    I can exercise designing? I always hated scrolling a huge font list back in the
    school. '
