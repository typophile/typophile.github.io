    Sadly enough, it doesnt seem to work for me. You are quite randomly mixing upper

  body: "Only the M and E work. Notice that in both cases you have a pretty conventional
    version of the letter in the edges of the post-it outlines. Not in any of the
    others though. The \"b\" doesn't work in context, because everything else looks
    uppercase, so it hits me as an \"L\" if anything. And the very first letter (the
    \"R\") is too vague.\r\n\r\nNeat experiment, though-- the problem seems to be
    in trying to make some of the letterforms with only two rectangles. That will
    make it almost impossible to distinguish, say, P and F. Then again, context does
    help -- but that means that you'll need text to be custom for each case, or else
    multiple glyphs for certain letters."

    then. I have recognized it just because you said that there is written something.

    always a good thing. Well, most of the time.

  body: "I don't think I would have read anything if I hadn't been trying. In other
    words, you have to want to analyze this for a moment longer -- to have your aha
    moment -- or else you'll just see a pile of notes. And this, as Miss Tiffany said,
    can be a good thing.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think that if something doesn't somehow
    hold your attention and compel you to find the hidden image/message, you'll just
    move on. So, as I see it, the problem to be solved here is how to get people to
    stop a second longer and decipher the visual puzzle.\r\n\r\nPerhaps by adding
    a whole bunch of notes to the background and somehow making these stand out --
    by giving them a slightly different colour, or making it seem as if they're on
    a plane closer to the viewer, or whatever."
