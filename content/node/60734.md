body: "saw this on AIGA, and thought it was impressive, great photography and interesting
  type. Take the time to let it load. I wish though that they didnt do the journey
  of images using automatic scrolling. It would be so much better to be able to navigate
  by image, I find the scrolling annoying.\r\n\r\narticle on AIGA\r\nhttp://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/band-on-the-run-an-interview-with-jose-cabaco\r\n\r\nSite\r\nhttp://www.orbasquara.com/\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Wow, great link. Thanks for posting!\r\n\r\nMust say I disagree re the scrolling
    \u2013 I find it does a tremendous job to get the \"on the road\"/\"on the bus\"
    feeling across (and it's certainly gutsy). Driving not flying \u2013 not jumping
    from link to link, but letting the images move by. Park your mouse somewhere on
    the right, lean back and forget time :-)"

  body: 'I hear ya, tried that, but it somehow leaves me feeling a little dizzy, somwhat
    like I suppose I would feel after such a roadtrip :-o I still would love to be
    able to view the images (they are so good) in a linear book like format with smooth
    navigation but not scrolling. '
