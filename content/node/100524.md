  body: "Switch? What for??\r\n\r\nI think I wasn't understood... in my screen capture
    the ampersands stand between 4 different text strings:\r\n\r\nHOH*HOH\r\nHHH*HHH\r\nOOO*ooo\r\nXHX*xox\r\n\r\nIn
    the FL metrics window, whenever you select a glyph from the Kerning or Metrics
    Table, it will appear between those 4 text strings in the position where the *
    is.\r\n\r\nMy question is, how can I edit those text strings, even add a few ones?
    For example one line with cyrillic characters?"

    your new text, or click on the Options button to change or add options for the
    preview box, or to point it to an external text file that contains your text strings.
    Then you can select your appropriate base string and drag glyphs from the Font
    window and drop them into the Metrics window where you want them to appear.\r\n"

  body: "From the manual:\r\n<blockquote>You can customize the context by editing
    the Metrics.txt file located in the Application user data/Data folder.</blockquote>\r\nAlthough
    it doesn't go into any detail on the syntax used in the file, or how to add new
    contexts for different languages. From what I can tell, the actual strings are
    composed using glyph names preceded by a slash, with the @ character representing
    the selected glyph, and \\n (<em>backslash</em> n) for a newline."
