body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI'm curious if my workflow/method for constructing accent italic
  characters is the correct method.\r\n\r\nI have the glyphs in there correct places
  and the use Glyphs > Create Glyghs to create the accented glyphs, which will be
  a composite of the two seperate glyphs. This works fine but the accent is always
  far over on the left. I then go through all the accent glyphs and move the accents
  over to the right.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to create the accent glyphs so the accents
  will be placed in the correct position, or somewhere close.\r\n\r\n"

    need to manually optically place it in the right spot. Especially since the optical
    middle of characters differ.

    a good start, but I was wondering is there a macro I could use to do this action
    on a group of glyph windows selected.\r\n\r\nI realize I will need to optically
    place the accents but I just wanted something I could quickly use to get a general
    idea so I could text the accents.\r\n\r\nRr"

    the letters, and one in each accent, and then FontLab will generate the composites
    so the anchors coincide. '
