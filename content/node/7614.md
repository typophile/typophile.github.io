body: I like Verdana on the screen. It&#39;s a great face. But is Verdana really acceptable
  in print?

  body: Good question, although &#34;acceptable&#34; is very ambiguous and variable
    of course. Many people don&#39;t like Verdana&#39;s outlines. I think it was a
    &#34;progressive&#34; choice in the late 90s, but maybe now either has no flavor
    or the wrong flavor. But as always, it depends! <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: I have yet to see Verdana used well off line.  <BR> <BR>It is too wide for
    a &#34;regular&#34; sans-serif. &#40;By &#34;regular&#34; meaning that it is not
    an extended version&#41;. So it wastes a lot of space. Characters like a, e, j,
    I, J look very odd when printed. Some of the nuances that translate so well on
    screen become, well, nuisances. <BR> <BR>Unlike its serifed sibling, Georgia,
    Verdana should stick to HTML.

    point sizes everything clogs up, especially if it&#39;s being copied or faxed.

  body: 'I&#39;ve used it once or twice for heads. I knew I was on shaky ground, but
    I try to be open-minded about fonts. Almost every last one of them has it&#39;s
    moment of perfect utility. I once saw someone make perfect use of Courier in a
    credit card ad. So I doubt it&#39;s written in stone: Thou Shalt Not Use Verdana
    Except on the Internets. The nice thing about working with it is that you&#39;ll
    know instantly if it belongs in your printed design or not. Usually not. <BR>
    <BR>But every now &amp; then...'
