  kind of poster like it was used in the movie \"The Spirit\". I already found out
  that the \"My city screams\"-letters are some kind of Swiss-font, but I really struggle
  with the logo. I got the bad thought that it's a custom logo and no real font is
  existing of it. \r\n\r\nThis is the poster:\r\nhttp://www.impawards.com/2008/spirit_ver5_xlg.html\r\n\r\nAnyone
  maybe got an idea if my thought is correct or does know a similar font like that
  one please?\r\n\r\nHelp would be greatly appreciated.\r\nThank you very much in
  advance"

  body: I believe that it's a (rather poor) custom job, loosely based on Helvetica
    Extra Compressed; however, the R and M have been radically altered, and the spine
    of the S has been rendered rather poorly (way too thick)...

    someone has done a fan-font out of it."

  body: Thank you. Well yes, there is existing an fan-font of Sin City, so I hoped
    that something also existed from that one. :)
