  also some types or ornaments. How to make a beer has a visual better taste? <BR>I
  think everyone has an opinion of beer right? So take a sip. <BR>Best wishes. <BR>Helder

    your favorite beer label <BR> <BR>I think a beer label is one important thing,
    but its role in the bottle/can as a whole is an even more important thing. Take
    Suntory for example: not a remarkable label, but in the context of the can -an
    accurately modeled miniature keg- it&#39;s wonderful. <BR> <BR>One of my most
    memorable labels was of a beer from Congo, called &#34;Ngok&#34;. It has a nasty
    alligator on it - made me feel like I was lost in a jungle having my last beer
    &#40;which made it taste much better than it really was&#41;. Another nice label
    was La Ballena &#40;from Puerto Vallarta&#41;, where the label was shaped like
    a whale - and that beer only came in oversized bottles. <BR> <BR>BTW, there&#39;s
    a wonderful book you should get: <BR>&#34;Labels of Distinction - Microbrewery
    Label Design&#34; by S Drate and T Olejar. <BR>I bought it because one day I will
