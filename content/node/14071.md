  body: "I think the Precious Moments logo is custom lettering, but it is very close
    to a free font called <a href=\"http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/westwind/index.htm\"
    target=\"new\">Ziggy Zoe</a>, which was designed by West Wind Fonts, and is now
    found at typOasis.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
