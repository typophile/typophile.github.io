  website</a></strong> and I noticed when I hovered my cursor over the page, a light
  grey semi-transparent horizontal bar appeared. A feature I have not seen before.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m
  fairly confidant it\u2019s there to assist users with reading differences. Akin
  to how you used to use a ruler to help you read when you were learning.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s
  still novel to me, but I think I like it. Then again, my vision isn\u2019t that
  good, and I like big, easy to read type.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone:\r\na) know how this
  feature technically implemented? (css, html 5, Flash &c)\r\nb) have any thoughts
  or feelings about it?"

    sources to peer reviewed studies which support this, or is this anecdotal and
    from your own experience (which I am confidant is far more significant than my
    own). I have yet* to come across anything published.\r\n\r\nDiemand-Yauman, C.,
    Oppenheimer, D. M. & Vaughan, E. B. (2010). Fortune favours the bold (and the
    italicized): Effects of disfluency on educational outcomes. <em>Cognition, 118(1)</em>,
    111\u2013115.\r\n\r\nBut this sample population for Diemand-Yauman et al. (1020)
    were not readers with learning differences. Experiment 2 did have 222 subjects
    (Ss) however, so it\u2019s possible there were a few Ss in there who did have
    learning differences but fell within their inclusion criteria of academic performance,
    or did not report any learning differences.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response!\r\n\r\n*
    Please excuse my crap seizure-medicated memory. I may have in fact read something
    and don\u2019t recall.\r\nhttp://readthetype.com/literature/"

    contrast also helps people with scoptic sensitivity syndrome. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotopic_sensitivity_syndrome#Scotopic_sensitivity_syndrome_Symptoms\r\n\r\nThe
    idea was to have a happy medium, because with contrast too low, and its obviously
    useless for everyone, but contrast too high would be difficult to read for some.
    \r\n\r\nThe bar and the highlighting paragraphs are there to help keep focus on
    what you are reading. The highlighted paragraph is the current paragraph you are
    reading, and you can use the bar for the line. It's a similar concept to using
    an index card or bookmark for reading line by line. \r\n\r\nhttp://beelinereader.com
    accomplishes something similar using text gradients, which I also use personally.\r\n\r\nObviously,
    there is personal experience in the mix too: I experimented quite a bit with colors
    and reading in college, but never mentioned anything openly about it until I realized
    others had similar issues and methods for dealing with them."

  body: "What I would prefer, instead of a moving bar of shading, would simply be
    to statically alter the background color for alternating lines of text.\r\n\r\nSome
    computer printout paper used to do this. So I could alternate between blue printing
    on a yellow background (said to be \"optimum\" for legibility in one ancient study
    - but this was for highway signage, not reading) and blue printing on a light
    green background.\r\n\r\nMaybe orange instead of yellow to have reduced contrast.\r\n\r\nBut
    apparently even JavaScript doesn't let you do that; all the results I found for
    alternating lines were for tables, not text in paragraphs."

    offered a low contrast mode."
