body: Hello. <BR> <BR>Is there anyone who has information about Normunds Hartmanis,
  Lithuanian typograph? <BR> <BR>I have just bought a book from the year 1957 about
  the swedish iron company LKAB. The typeface used in the headlines and on the cover
  of the book is made by Normunds Hartmanis.  <BR>&#40;I dont have the name of the
  typeface.&#41; <BR> <BR>Is he a wellknown graphic designer? <BR>Are there any books
  about his work? <BR>Would it be possible to find examples of typefaces that he constructed?
  <BR>  <BR>Best regards <BR>Magdalena, Sweden

    get better feedback.
