  anybody know what this thin half-stroke around the outside of these letters is called?
  Is there a term for referring to it? I see this treatment compiled in a lot of work
  that you might consider vintage/classic. I wanted to know if creating this effect
  is easy or something the designer would customize themselves (drawing each stroke)?
  I know of a similar technique but it doesn't render the same way as the specimens
  i see on aged labels, etc. I'm perfectly fine with treating the type letter by letter
  but, if there's another way, I'd like to learn.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: Satya's right, but in many cases, some careful duplication will do the trick.
    Yves outlines it nicely in <a href="http://fontfeed.com/archives/engraved-festive-type/">this
    tutorial</a>.

  body: Maybe John Downer or Charles Borges could elaborate, but I think it's a common
    shading technique for signpainters. It goes way back and you'd likely see lots
    of samples in old showcard lettering books.
