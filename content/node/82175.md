body: "Am seeking the correct name or names of the Garamond type style shown on page
  102 of: Encyclopedia of Typefaces, by Jasper, Berry & Johnson, paperback edition
  of 1990, with red cover.  The listing at the bottom is: Simoncini Garamond. I have
  researched the\r\nMonotype books, Rookledge book, Mac McGrew's book Identifont,
  and other on-line sources. \r\nThe show is of: capitals, small capitals and oldstyle
  figures, in roman and italic, no lowercase letters.\r\nAnother interesting features
  is the capital \"J\", it terminates at baseline, does not swing below baseline as
  most Garamond lowercase\r\n\"J\" letters. The tail of the letter \"Q\" gives a hint
  of a foundry Monotype sorts or alternate setting.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have an answer
  to the name of the above mention type style?\r\n\r\nI have checked the errata in
  the front section, No listing.\r\n\r\nThank you,  Gary Barsch."

    you say it's labeled Simoncini Garamond? Which BTW is a Jannon, not a Garamond
    (even though in post-rationalizations of it that I've read they try very hard
    to cover that up).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
