  anyone tried this before? im looking to learn from previous works so i dont make
  similar, if any, mistakes.\r\n\r\n\r\nalso, any recommendations on technical graphology
  books is appreciated. lots of relationship analysis chaff out there!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nregards\r\nmike"

    the bit that seems to be begging the question. Applying the 'rules' of graphology
    as a typographic system in an experimental way shouldn't presuppose a result ('personality')."

    thread</a>. There I had linked to a <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/539\">spot-on
    definiton of graphology</a> by John Butler.\r\n\r\nAs I see that you also are
    <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/43331\">looking for reverse italics</a>,
    I presume that you want to assign different typographic voices to different parts
    of your text, possibly roles in a drama? That sounds interesting \u2013 if my
    guess is right. But where does the g-word come into play?\r\n\r\nF"

    It stands to reason, that if our personality is expressed in our writing then
    the reverse might also be exploitable, that personality problems can be corrected
    by changing our handwriting.'

    a graphological markup language and yes, in graphology, a left slant tendency
    shows emotion and reserve hence me looking for a reverse italic.\r\n\r\ni REALLY
    dont want to skew the type to the left- i might just handdraw the whole thing."

    graphology isn't *a* system - it's a bunch of competing and substantially contradictory
    systems. You'd have to pick one, first.\r\n\r\nOf course, what's the *point* of
    trying to apply it to typography as a theoretical framework? Unless your audience
    is familiar with the theories of the particular graphology system you've used
    as your basis, it won't enhance your communication to the audience in any way.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "If you are looking for graphology as a concept (or several), you best start
    with visiting a library that holds a lot of books from around 1880 to 1930, which
    is as far as I can see the period of time that most of the standard literature
    was first published. \r\nIf your interest is more on a markup system to transcribe
    manuscripts (correct me if I\u2019m wrong when reading <cite>im attempting a graphological
    markup language</cite> in this direction), you\u2019d better start with existing
    ones, <a href=\"http://www.tei-c.org/\">TEI</a> might suffice for a start. "
