body: I've installed Fontforge on both a G5 (10.4) and Intel (10.5.5) and I've also
  installed the appropriate Spiro package on both. It works on the G5 machine, but
  Fontforge doesn't seem to recognize the Spiro extension on the Intel. Does anyone
  know why this would be. I use the Intel machine the most and it would be nice to
  have everything work correctly on it. There are several other things that don't
  seem to work on the Intel machine (key commands, add extrema, etc.), but I can work
  around those right now. Thanks in advance.

  body: "Please bring up your issues on the fontforge-devel mailing list. That way
    George will get to fixing your issues for the next package release which happens
    almost monthly (probably also issuing a patch if you want to build from source),
    or tell you what you're doing wrong, or tell you that he can't reproduce your
    problem and needs more information.\r\n\r\nAre you running the most recent build
    of FontForge? Did you install libSpiro before FontForge? If not, you may have
    to re-run the FontForge installation again. It's OK to do this with the installer
    the same version already installed.\r\n\r\nThere are also some [[http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/source-build.html#Dependencies|dependencies
    in FontForge]] provided by Fink (notably a library which makes Mac menu shortcuts
    work again, others to enable different image imports to your background layer,
    and more) which you'll have to install if you haven't already, as well as the
    Apple Developer Tools, so that Fink can properly update. This will occupy a big
    chunk of your hard disk (1-3 Gb), but on a new machine it's not so huge percentage
    wise."

  body: I look into the mailing list; I thought I tried to join it once but I didn't
    get a response. I'm pretty sure I'm running the most recent build (9/27/008) for
    both operating systems, but I will double check (can't just now). I will try to
    install libspiro first and then re-install FontForge when I get the chance. I
    have Fink and I used Fink Commander to install the dependencies listed on the
    FF website that I could find there. I'm new to UNIX so installing other packages
    that aren't on Fink is a little alien to me. I have some more to learn. I don't
    have the Apple Developer Tools Installed yet; I will do that too. Thanks.

  body: "This is all something I had to do with the latest build too.\r\nPrevious
    builds used a masking method to make the command key function as the control key
    for the purpose of menu shortcuts. This worked but I figure it wasn't a clean
    programming style so it was changed. The new version, however, requires an extra
    library that's not part of Apple's X11 by default, but is provided by Fink. You
    also have to toggle the \"Enable keyboard shortcuts under X11\" item in the X11
    preferences to Off.\r\n\r\nI do notice that, even after all this, the command
    key does not activate keyboard shortcuts in dialog windows that don't have menu
    bars, but the control key combos do work."
