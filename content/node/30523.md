body: "Hello Everybody, my name is Alin and i'm new here...  and this is my first
  shot at a distinct serif & text block typeface .. its by far not finnished with
  letters missing in lowercase and almost no uppercase yet. I intend to make it a
  full font with italics weights and swashes... \r\n\r\nOne problem i have with it
  is that i wanted it to look distinctive to some very small extent from other fonts
  (its not top priority - i think its better to finnish it properly). My question
  is .. how do you find it ? if it would be finnished would it be ok as a font ? \r\n\r\nP.S.
  The reason i'm asking is because i've recently discovered it looks very much like
  Italia - which kinda made me sad :)) \r\n\r\nThank you for your time .. much love
  to the typophile forums - itsa great place :D\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/test_4846.jpg]"

  body: "I typed a lengthy reply, but got a server error. Can't be bothered with retyping
    it that long again, sorry.\r\n\r\nWhat I said in short:\r\nYour serifs might be
    a bit too slanted. With the a, b, g, etc. it's fine, but on the f and j and similar
    characters, it looks awkward.\r\nThe u, h and n are too wide (m is better). Bottom
    serif on v is a bit heavy. \r\nSince all your characters have differences in stroke
    width, your o, c and e should have that as well."

  body: "okay so here are the main letters lower and uppercase. i've tried to correct
    what Quincunx said - \r\n\r\ni've tried to temper the serifs on j,f,y but also
    provided with alternate versions at the bottom...\r\n\r\ni've added differences
    in stroke to o c and e but they might be too weak ... \r\ni'll continue working
    on them but here's the update:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/001_3769.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/01_5032.jpg]\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Ah, thats looking nice. \r\nI think the lc 'k' bottom could use a bit more
    subtlety. It somehow looks that the right shoulder of the 'm' is higher then the
    left one. The alternative 'j', 'f' and 'y' are fine in my opinion, although the
    serif on the normal 'y' does work. Maybe a similar treatment might work on the
    other two as well? I'm also not sure about the slanted crossbars on the 't' and
    'f', but then again it might be a characteristic feature too. The difference in
    strokewidth on the 'e' and 'o' are indeed not very noticable.\r\nThe uppercase;
    Same prob with the 'J' as with the lc. The terminal of the 'K' is better then
    on the 'k'. The lower stroke of the 'L' might be a bit wide, that could cause
    a large gap when text is set with the typeface. The 'S' is a bit wide. \r\nNo
    serifs on the bottom of the 'V' and 'W'? (might not need it, but it does stand
    out). The shift of the strokes in the 'X' might be a bit exaggerated, at least
    on this size. Also on the top, the counter becomes a bit small. But I like the
    style of your uppercase, although I do think it does not exactly match the style
    of the lowercase. Lowercase is very geometric, your uppercase is not.\r\n\r\nAll
    in all it's starting to take shape, keep it up."
