  (http://www.typonine.com/fonts/font-library/marlene/), that has a large family which
  includes stencil cuts. I am working on an online magazine layout and would like
  to implement the stencil version as a hover effect for links.\r\n\r\nThe foundry
  selling it should therefore be able to host the type (have a web version).\r\n\r\nThank
  you!"

  body: Do you need webfonts that are hosted by the foundry? You have probably seen
    that Marlene Stencil is available as a webfont, but Typonine is not going to host
    the files for you, as far as I understand.
