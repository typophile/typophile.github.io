  body: Interesting. I never paid much attention to the signs when I was in Berlin;
    I just sort of assumed they were standardized after I read about the DIN typeface.
    I take it DIN was only used on stuff like freeway signage?

  body: "Mark, thanks for this compilation. There are even more, I can assure you!\r\n\r\nYes,
    both #1 and #2 are the East Berlin style. #3 is the former West Berlin style that
    now has spread to the Eastern parts aswell. It is the <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/hardwig/2439882179/\">most
    common one</a>, coming in a number of flavours. #4 is the same, just (untypically)
    scaled down so that the long name fits in.\r\n\r\n#8 is at <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/52362783@N00/3777298143/\">Bahnhof
    Schlesisches Tor</a> in Kreuzberg, most likely a relic, or an exception.\r\n\r\nI
    don\u2019t know if there is a rule when to use blackletter (#11\u201314; I doubt
    it), but those signs pop up all over the city, <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/hardwig/2159499218/\">in
    all kinds of substyles</a>. #12 is in Tiergarten. I\u2019d say #13/14 is the most
    common blackletter style on Berlin street signs."

  body: "From <a href=\"http://www.fontfont.com/cgi-bin/showfont.pl?id=12224&aid=2\">FontFont.com
    on FF City Street Type</a>:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>For decades two different signage
    systems divided East and West Berlin. The West used a sans serif dating back to
    the 30s, while the East preferred a technically-tinted sans face from the 50s.
    Ole Sch\xE4fer and Verena Gerlach based their designs on the street signs themselves
    rather than the sketches from which the signs were made. This resulted in there
    being two versions for the East and a single version for the West. The FontFont
    character set includes many characters that would never be found on a street sign
    so Sch\xE4fer and Gerlach designed the missing letters, punctuation and symbols.
    They also designed special headline fonts for both East and West available in
    three weights: Regular, Medium and Bold. In addition, they created lining figures
    and, for the expert sets, a series of arrows and other useful symbols.</blockquote>"

  body: "Kris, if I recall correctly, I heard Verena mention in a lecture that the
    West Berlin signs (3 and 4) are  a design that predates the war. The letters used
    are from a specific version of the Erbar typeface. [I don't know if that means
    \"custom\" in the same sense that it would today.]\r\n\r\nI assume that today,
    the signs are made with a digital font (because some signs in the city look artificially
    compressed, and also because, as Florian mentions, they scale the letters down
    sometimes, like in number 4). But, it could be done without a font, of course."

    but it must be very loosely so. And from what I saw, not many of the signs seemed
    digital. They looked to be hand-painted & adjusted to accommodate longer names.
    I might be totally incorrect, however.\r\n\r\n--K"

    related thread on Flickr</a>:\r\n\r\nOne has to keep in mind that those signs
    are subject to constant renovation and replacement \u2013 and have been for decades.
    There is no sole source font, but rather a fuzzy model that every manufacturer
    innovates upon. Just compare the other letters, \u2018s\u2019, \u2018r\u2019,
    \u2018a\u2019 \u2026 none of them is congruent to those on the other sign. Some
    newer signs (neither of these) show a noticeable reworked version of the typeface;
    cleaner, a tad narrower, and less geometric.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nAs far as I know,
    FSI was involved in that reworked version, which can be <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/offshore/4404142671/\">seen
    here</a> \u2013 the extent of modification becomes evident when comparing the
    \u2018y\u2019 to the <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/brouk_pytlik/62518541/\">one
    in the old version</a>.\r\n\r\nIf there ever were sketches, I am pretty sure they
    are gone now. Verena would know. You can find some more information about FF City
    Street Type in <a href=\"http://www.atypi.org/30_past_conferences/06_Lisbon/presentations/verenaGerlach.pdf\">this

    of Berlin projects (he has an office there) and did the signage for the underground
    system. He is about as much a type guru as there is in my opinion. \r\n\r\nI am
    not sure however that Berliners find this to be a bad thing, it is not something
    that needs \"solving\" as you suggest, for many. Berlin is a unique city with
    lots of culture and cultures and I think many probably embrace the mish mash of
    various styles of signage rather than long for a uniformity of style. There are
    certainly a lot of good arguments for developing a consistency, but it would take
    some of the charm of Berlin away I think. "
