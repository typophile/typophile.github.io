  body: "Goudy Italic and Goudy Swash for the top, I believe. The weight looks in
    between the weights offered by the sample below, you may want to look around.
    It also could be due to this being desktop/digital.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/goudy-wtc/goudy-swash-wtc-t-regular-italic/glyphs.html\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I second Joe's diagnosis - but note that the swash 'U' was used rather than
    the 'V'. That definitely works.\r\n\r\nI live only a few miles away from Vashon.
    I hit it as a ferry stop on the way to Fontleroy often, but haven't explored the
    island itself for years. I'll have to remedy that soon ..."

    it was an alt character. Interesting '
