    just resurrected from the dead, while FontLabStudio constantly evolves.\r\n\r\ndepending
    on your needs you might also consider buying TypeTool (think of it as FontLab
    Limited Edition) and upgrading to FLabS later.\r\n"

    And it\u2019s not hard to learn. When I started to use FontLab I used the book

  body: "Setting all the usual FL-is-better arguments aside, I will say that they
    are similar in concept, but very different in implementation and details. I often
    draw an analogy between Fog/FL and Quark/InDesign. Both have their strengths and
    weaknesses. But switching from one to the other requires a certain amount of shifting
    mental gears, which can take focus away from designing. \r\n\r\nThat said, I found
    learning initially in Fog to be relatively easier than learning FL for some reason
    (and that was coming to FL from Fog, where I already had an understanding of the
    concepts). But if you're planning on doing this at all professionally (or even
    semi-professionally) then you're probably better off just learning FL than starting
    in Fog and later trying to retrain your habits into FL.\r\n\r\n-- K."

  body: "I also started with FontLab. The basic problem with Fog is that it [[http://www.fontlab.com/fontlab-products/compare/|lacks
    features to deal with open type]], and so is out of date in this respect.   \r\n\r\nThose
    who know Fog refer to features that are better executed in Fog. Either they are
    more intuitive or just work better. The FL folks seem to concede this, and now
    that they own Fog, from what Adam has written recently here they are going to
    integrate at least one better feature of Fog into FL in the next version, and
    I would guess more than that. \r\n\r\nIt doesn't look like they are going give
    open type features to Fog, but I don't know. "

    @ typcon. The on line info for the session said I'd need a full or demo version
    of TypeTool and Fontographer but Fontgrapher isn't availabe as a demo for PCs
    at this time, \r\n\r\nIn the end it turned out that it should have read FontLab
    instead of Fontographer. \r\n\r\nThanks everyone for the info\r\n\r\n\r\n> Lakeway

    whose books we set prepare their manuscripts on PCs. Now if only the publishers
    didn't mess things up by converting the authors documents to Mac -- particularly
    older versions of the Mac OS that didn't support Unicode . . .\r\n\r\nSee, for
    example, http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=766664\r\n\r\nBut so
    what if Mac has a small market share? As long as it does it's job  & doesn't get
    in the way of people doing work, the platform/OS shouldn't matter."
