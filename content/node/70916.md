  body: "You may be right Mark, but their weights aren't even consistent.\r\n\r\nThe
    closest numerals I have found are in <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/gable-antique-condensed-sg/\">Gable
    Antique Condensed</a>, from Spiece Graphics. Notice how much better these numbers
    match each other.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
