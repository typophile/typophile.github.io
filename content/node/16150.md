body: "According to Shinntype, this font is not for sale, which I find rather disappointing,
  since at first glance it looks like an incredibly warm and readable face. Its connection
  with Mordecai Richler and his works makes it even more desirable. As a Canadian
  (former Montrealer, now Torontonian), it would be nice to use a quality face that
  carries with it some historical and cultural meaning.\r\n\r\nSo, Mr. Shinn, will
  this ever be released? Is there any way one can purchase this font? "

    will give me plenty of time to prepare full multi-language support and OpenType
    features, complete with Mayan hieroglyphs for full dimensional translation."
