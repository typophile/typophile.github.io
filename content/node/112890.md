  - 9]] is out now. It includes an article on Readability by Peter Enneson and myself.
  We are delighted to be in such good company: Articles by Gerard Unger, Eric Kindel,
  James Mosley, Paul Luna, Titus Nemeth, and Maurice G\xF6ldner. \r\n\r\nOur article
  is the completion of work on the history of 'readability' that I first gave at TypeCon,
  and discussed further here: http://typophile.com/node/83684.\r\n\r\nThe core of
  the story is that the concept of 'readability' as ease of reading continuous text
  was developed by scientist Matthew Luckiesh in research done in the late '30s in
  collaboration with Linotype. Luckiesh found that the difficulty of reading text
  could be measured by the increase in blink rate over time. At the time, this was
  contested by researcher Miles Tinker, and an acrimonious dispute ensued. The upshot
  was that Luckiesh's concept lived on in typography, but his name was lost. In experimental
  psychology it was largely forgotten. However, a fatigue researcher, John Stern,
  reviewed the dispute in the '90s, and concluded that Luckiesh was largely right
  all along \r\n\r\nWhat is new in this complete version is first, we found that Harry
  Gage at Linotype was an important collaborator, without whom the most important
  results wouldn't have been discovered. Second, we report at the end on current research
  that seem to reinforce the importance of blink rate. It turns out that during blinks
  the whole visual system is briefly shut down Our hypothesis is that this allows
  for refreshment of chemicals that the nerves in the brain need to do the visual
  processing. This would explain why when type is less easy to read, increased blinking
  is an understandable compensation. \r\n\r\nThe important thing for typography is
  that Luckiesh was able to discriminate some effects that nobody else has done, especially
  the fact that bold type is less readable, even though it can be read at nearly the
  same speed.   \r\n\r\n"
