    third parties.

    for one second.\r\n\r\nI just hate working with committees and if you, Richard,
    are going to pit one against the other then I agree with James and Nick. To be
    precise you become a pain in the ass customer.\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: "my apologies, i meant i have a designer to work with me on the WEBSITE, not
    the logo, I forgot to include that, have been climbing all day and my grey matter
    is running on empty.\r\n\r\nI do not have a logo/brand designer as of yet, the
    developer specialises in web design, and does not have the time to design a logo,
    so i`m in the process of finding a suitable candidate.\r\n\r\nJust wished to get
    some advice from members on here, to see there initial thoughts/suggestions,\r\n\r\nforgive
    me for the initial confusion,\r\n\r\nRichard"

  body: I was really happy how that turned out, the adelto website should be launching
    soon and the blog is going really well, alot of organic search results coming
    in, and some really interesting and unique range of products on offer. Hopefully
    will go from strength to strength!
