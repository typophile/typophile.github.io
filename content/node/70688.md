  am setting my journal (yes, I am such a design geek that I write my journal in InDesign)
  so I would like it to be as well-set as possible. \r\n\r\nThe first looks overtly
  incorrect. Should I simply reduce the tracking of the comma so it is under the h
  or even further toward the t? The second example looks more correct, but I'm still
  not sure if it looks just right.\r\n\r\nOpinions?"

  body: Oops, I didn't see your second post. I prefer the superscript "th" instead
    of just "4th." I can't remember, but I believe Bringhurst also said it was preferable...
    although I could be imagining that.

  body: "I usually do superscript, actually. I just don't go with the program's defaults,
    because it always looks bad. And with yours, I would definitely put the comma
    after the ordinal (if you do it) as it looks weird having that glob of characters
    together.\r\n\r\nI prefer to write my journal by hand, anyways."

  body: "In a personal journal you can do whatever you want, of course. \r\n\r\nBut
    as a frame of reference: In formal writing, one would not generally use the ordinal
    form in a sentence like your inline example above. When a date is written out
    like that, it is usually expressed as a cardinal number, even if it might get
    read or pronounced informally as an ordinal. "

  body: "Personally, I think that superscript looks bad with hanging or text numerals.
    It causes the line to jump around and is distracting. \r\n\r\nIn the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_indicator|Wikipedia
    article on ordinal indicators]] it claims that superscript was a Victorian practice
    in English, under the influence of French. I am wondering whether this style came
    in with the adoption of lining figures. With lining figures, it works, though
    I don't really see it as an advantage. With old style figures, as I said, it seems
    to me ugly and distracting.  "
