body: I belong to another forum that I found to be very helpful but interested in
  what people on here have to say about any sites to purchase software from that you
  found to be good deals etc.  I was refered to this one site which is <a href="http://www.academicsuperstore.com"
  target="_blank">www.academicsuperstore.com</a>, which has awesome prices for students
  and teachers, but what happens if your not either?  Well, if anyone can help me
  out when it comes to purchasing software like Illustrator 10, InDesign, or Quark,
  possibly Flash and Dreamweaver for a good deal, please please let me know.  Thank
  you.
