    think one of blackletter scripts might fit your need. Probably other typophiles
    would help you identify the typeface.\r\n\r\nBTW, the typeface on the window reminds
    me of <a href=\"http://www.pentagram.com/en/new/2009/03/new-work-the-oak-room.php\">the
    Oark Room and Oak Bar</a> logo by Pentagram.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/oak_oldLogos_sm_6505.jpg]\r\n\r\nJamesZ"
