body: "There is an amazing book about dealing with illness and loss, \u201CThe Year
  of Magical Thinking\u201D by Joan Didion, Vintage Books.  In it she talks about
  how western culture has forgotten the rules by which we mourn.  We used to have
  rigid codes for the passage through grief into morning and then return to everyday
  life (this process was allowed to take well over a year, sometimes two).  We no
  longer have a prescribed method for mourning so every one of us is left on our own.
  \ Some mourn with grace, others less gracefully.\r\n\r\nWhen my mother died last
  year my uncle, her brother, asked me if I would like to take care of the bereavement
  acknowledgment cards.  My mom's family is in the funeral business and ordinarily
  the funeral home would take care of this. But, my business is engraving for social
  stationery, so, he asked if I wanted to take care of this particular detail.\r\n\r\nEngraving
  for social stationery encompasses the written form for all great transitions in
  life.  Birth announcements, christening/confirmation/bar and bat mitzvah invitations,
  wedding announcements and note cards acknowledging a person\u2019s death are all
  part of the ritual correspondences in today\u2019s society.\r\n\r\nIn the American
  tradition, bereavement acknowledgement cards are simple text, elaborations such
  as personal monograms are unusual.  Although not proper, something in me wanted
  my mother\u2019s card to hold her personal mark, so I decided to use her monogram.
  \ \r\n \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cFk_4357.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nAbove is
  my mother's original monogram engraved on the occasion of her marriage to my dad
  in 1951. (For complete documentation and timeline go to http://www.nancysharoncollinsstationer.com/2005/timetable.)
  \ Notice the initials, \u201CC\u201D for Charlotte, her given name, the prominent
  \u201CF\u201D in center is her married name, Feldman, and the final \u201CK\u201D
  is her maiden name. *\r\n\r\nIn about 1990 I asked to borrow the monogram die then
  proceeded to lose it.  By then I had been working with a hand engraver who said
  he could replicate it from the printed note, above. However, in the forty years
  since the original die had been engraved the physical acumen for such fine engraving
  had all but gone from commercial engravers.  This willing fellow was simply not
  up to the task and delivered a much less refined engraving for my mother's initials.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cFk_4594.redo.jpg]\r\n\r\nIf
  you compare this brilliantly colored rendition to the delicacy of the original monogram
  (top) you will see how course the new die was.  The original was made up of four
  tapering, paralleling lines.  The new one has none of the refinement inherent in
  engraving, it was just a course reproduction.  So I commissioned a third using a
  simpler engraving style I thought the craftsman could do:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cFk_redone_4658.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nMonograms
  are like logos or an automobile marque only it is for a private individual.  A monogram
  must immediately convey the very \"it\" or soul of a person.  A really good mongram
  will serve a person the whole of their life\u2013monograms made prior to marriage
  are still suitable for an individual's use after they wed, especially to intimates
  and immediate family.  The married woman's monogram (above) is used for correspondence
  to a wider scope of family friends and relatives, it represents the couple but is
  written in first person and signed by the wife.  In a complete bridal suite there
  will also be note cards appropriate for more formal use and less intimate circumstances:\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cFk_NF_6646.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nBelow
  are the bereavement acknowledgment cards engraved for the occasion of my mother\u2019s
  funeral:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cFk_3486.bereavement.jpg]\r\n\r\nNow
  that I look at my mother's beautiful monogram in stark black engraved on such a
  pale background I fear it looks less like what I had imagined. It is her monogram,
  nontheless, and these stark colors are appropriate to cards for the acknowledgment
  of bereavement.  The difficulty, I guess, is not the cards but that her death is
  still not anything that I could ever have imagination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*
  In 2001 I did a survey of society stationery shops across the country to find out
  trends in women\u2019s married names.  At that time about seventy five percent of
  women who married dropped their middle name, replacing it with their maiden name.
  \ (My mother, who had been Charlotte Beth Kaufman before marriage, became Charlotte
  Kaufman Feldman when wed.)  This statistic is probably not the same today."

  body: Nancy that was very touching and informational. When i think of monograms
    I do not think of them being a person's soul because now a days people use monograms
    for anything. Monograms tend to look the same to me but maybe that's because people
    do not want to take time to create a different type of monogram. I can tell by
    your mother's monogram that a lot of passion went into it. I just wished other
    people felt the same passion.

  body: I had no idea people did not think that a monogram could be personal, it is
    the whole idea behind them.  Historically it has been okay for one to be so abstract
    as to be non-readable.  But beautiful (or cool) nontheless.

    but not so much with the glow on the website:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fifty_5326.jpg]"

  body: I agree it's not as nice with the glow... if it just had a radial white-sand
    gradient it would be more clean, and suit much better to the design... it's really
    nice...
