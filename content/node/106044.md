body: "Hello everybody. \r\n\r\nI recently started to get into web typography and
  until now things look a little chaotic. I guess my biggest concern is how the fonts
  render on screen in different browsers, different os etc. Since I start all my design
  as illu or ps mockups it is crucial for me to know what the font will look like
  from this early stage. I guess the worst scenario here would be that when you run
  the live version of the font you realize that it looks different than the one you
  used in your mockup.  Since the desktop and the web fonts are essentially two different
  files would it be possible that are inconsistencies in thinks like x height weight
  etc? I found this plugin by extensis which enables you to preview webink fonts inside
  ps but i guess even that uses photoshops built in rendering algorithm. So has anyone
  come up with a solution to this problem. I'd be glad to hear any ideas ont the subject.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your time."
