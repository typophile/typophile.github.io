  university project. This is my first time making a font, so I would be very happy
  if you could give me some feedback. It`s a sans serif for headlines, and still with
  no name (taking suggestions). The kerning and metrics aren`t done yet. I recommend
  the PDF for better view.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot! [img:sites/default/files/old-images/especimen_teste_2_4427.jpg]"

  body: "David, this is great stuff! You obviously have great talent for type design,
    my compliments (as one amateur to another).\r\n\r\nA few remarks:\r\n/m/ looks
    a little too wide\r\n/S/ and /s/ look a little too wide and tilted to the left\r\nupper
    bowl of /S/ and /s/ could be narrower (looks upsidedown)\r\n/N/ could use more
    contrast (make verticals narrower and diagonal fatter)\r\n\r\nYou say this is
    for headlines so I understand is quite bold, but I'd really like to see a regular
    version! Can't wait for the numerals either!\r\n\r\nKeep going! "

  body: "This is really really charming. I like the slight assymetry to the counters
    and the caps are very strong. A few little things:\r\nThe /a/ counter seems a
    little squarish when compared to the /q/ and /d/. \r\nThe /z/ is heavier than
    the other lowercase letters, maybe thin the diagonal?\r\nThere seems to be some
    inconsistency in your corners, some are rounded like the bottom most corners of
    the /c/ and /e/ and whereas most end in points.\r\nI agree with Jean Paul that
    the /s/ and /S/ are top heavy and lean to the left.\r\n\r\nDespite that nitpicking,
    it's a very good design and I'm interested in seeing how it develops.\r\n\r\njrl"

  body: "Thanks a lot for the comments Jean Paul and Doc! Really aprecciate it. \r\n\r\nI`ll
    make some changes today based on your comments and send again so you see if it`s
    better.\r\n\r\nPaul, I plan on doing a regular and light weight, and maybe a text
    version as well.\r\n\r\nThanks again, and good day to you!"

  body: "What a strong first go.\r\n\r\nThe P calls rather a lot of attention to itself.
    It may be a \"murder your darlings\" situation. If you won't close it, maybe at
    least it shouldn't taper quite so much.\r\n\r\nThe diagonal of capital Z is also
    a bit heavy."

  body: "This is really funky, lowercase is especially charming. \r\n\r\nQ has just
    poked me in the eye \u2014 its tail. \r\nSs is falling backwards a bit.\r\nu may
    benefit from a couple of units narrowing.\r\nEar of g is singing a different tune
    (angle of terminal).\r\nWord space looks a bit narrow.\r\nR may be too narrow.
    Bowl could be larger.\r\nCounter of A could have a higher apex to avoid dark spot.\r\nCrossbar
    of F is usually a notch lower than on E.\r\nContrast on stems of U could balance
    more.\r\nHead of t looks dark.\r\nAcute accents need better positioning. a needs
    further left, u further right.\r\n\r\nIs this a bold/semibold weight?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    I see:\r\nIMO vwxz could use a bit more funkyness. Try curving them a bit (more).\r\ne
    seems too wide\r\nc also too wide\r\no too small\r\n\r\nHope this helps. Good
    luck."
