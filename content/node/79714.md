body: "hey, i am looking for a sans and a serif that go well together in a CV.\r\n\r\nin
  http://typophile.com/node/31800 , there is a pic of a great CV, and I designed mine
  accordingly. but I do not own freight, nor do I own any other font package that
  includes a sans and a serif designed to go together.\r\n\r\nI tried Avenir for headlines
  with minion pro for body which was nice, but now I am looking for other possibilities.\r\n\r\nArial
  Narrow with Baskerville? I know I am supposed to despise Arial, but it is combined
  like this in a pages template (apple software...)\r\n\r\nMyriad with Garamond (both
  Adobe, both Apple typefaces)? I don't like Myriad in a CV, it is too... soft?\r\n\r\nWhat
  do you think?\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your opinion in advance, this is my first post
  ever!"

  body: However, it's easier (not better!!!) if you use a sans and a serif that come
    from the same superfamily. Quadraat, Centro, Karmina, Relato, are my favorites.

  body: 'Hey, a word of design advice: merely talking about possibilities before you''ve
    attempted to flush out ideas as part of your process is not as effective as you
    might think. Create some pairs you think might work well together, put them on
    a page with other pairings, and heck, if nothing really strikes your fancy do
    some sketches and create your own faces to better match what effect you have in
    mind. It''s a lot like thumbnailing tons of ideas and picking out the few that
    are potential winners. Just asking other designers what works better before you''ve
    actually attempted anything doesn''t allow you, as designer, to see things as
    they appear to you and then draw from your intuition and experiences. You can''t
    learn and grow without jumping into the fire and figuring out for yourself what
    works and what doesn''t.'
