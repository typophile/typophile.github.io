  him. He makes hip hop/R&B beats. I always have a problem designing for people I
  know on a personal level, I tend to over think about what direction to go because
  I know them and I want to blow their minds. Attach are a few layout of the same
  type treatment. Let me know how that looks and see what way to go. By the way the
  name of his company is REDTHM (rhythm) I know he uses RED in it. should I use \"RED\"(color)
  in the logo or keep it neutral? Holla at yo boi,,. I am also attaching an icon and
  T-Shirt I designed for him.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/redthm_logo_6116.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/redthm_icon_4888.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/redthm_tshirt_5569.jpg]"

  body: I don't believe "red" has to be in red, especially since it will visually
    break the word into two words red & thm (or sort of words). The box around the
    logotype bothers me on the smaller scale versions (paired with the drum head skull
    and the veggies) the negative space above and to the right of the "m" is distracting.
    maybe it needs to be optically centered and not actually centered. The drum head
    skull guy is cute and I like him. But is cute the look that best suits your friend's
    work? The style looks like "Hello Kitty" goes goth/urban. Admittedly I'm old and
    this may be stereotypical, but usually when people are pairing a skull with music
    they're going for an edgier look. Not to say that's what you should do - certainly
    going along with the trend just for trends sake is not what I'm suggesting. I'm
    just asking is this style appropriate for your friend? And I'm afraid I just don't
    get the stippled drawing of the beats. The drawing goes so against the other style
    you were creating. If I saw that alone I would think it is for an organic farmer
    and instead of being called green thumb the company is redthm (red thumb - that
    their hands are stained by manually picking their beats). That drawing, especially
    on the brown has a '70's folk music sensibility. And the "I heart beats" shirt
    makes me think you love the English Beat. Why wasn't it "I heart redthm"? The
    different styles are all over the place, are you trying to show your friend's
    eclectic style? If that's the case I still think what you have so far doesn't
    accomplish your goal. Don't try to blow your friend's mind. Try to nail who he
    is, and what he does, in your logo. Accomplish that and you will blow his mind.

  body: "Thanks for your input. I am going for the hip urban Los Angeles feel. I guess
    I will just show this to him and wait to get a better understanding of what he
    wants. He's an urban outfitters knuckle head, so I thought of going in an urban
    sheik type of look. \r\n\r\nElias Tercero!"

  body: "First off, I LOVE the tape t-shirt. It reminds me of a t-shirt design I did
    a couple years ago for an \"old-school\" MTV-themed event.\r\n\r\nAs for the redthm
    logo, I understand the difficulty of doing an L.A. urban feel because it has to
    be funky and chic at the same time (I suppose that would be called \"funky fresh?\")
    I'm a big Urban Outfitters fan, so I can definitely see where you're going with
    it. I would try going even funkier. The wordmark is kinda blah for a hiphop artist
    that wants to distinguish himself from the rest of the scene. Of course I'm an
    east coast hiphop scenester, so my perception is a little different.\r\n\r\nThis
    is a real tough one... I'll probably post again once I sleep on it."

  body: "I got redthm?\r\n\r\nI like the first mark the best, but the letter spacing
    seems off.  I'd say - avoid red."
