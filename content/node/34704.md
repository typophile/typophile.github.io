  body: "Since the heavy pirating of fonts occur, I would rather stick to my graphic
    design projects.\r\nSome of the fonts fonts that I have been involved in producing
    are Handel Gothic, Yagi, Buxom, Roberta, Corporate etc. and most of the art nouveau
    revivals. My company was called Facsimile Fonts. URW is the biggest offender of
    pirating my fonts."

    or maybe just that I personally can't get enough of, is the history of type!

    might have a Cyrillic version, but they don't.
