  geometric sans serif they were using in the title sequence. It looks a lot like
  Neutraface 2 to me, but appears more extended (particularly the W and the S). Any
  ideas? \r\n\r\n[[http://title-sequence.tumblr.com/image/81284171693]]\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    hard to identify it. A way would be to directly ask [[http://www.behance.net/gallery/Snowpiercer-title-sequence/15689859|Sangdon
