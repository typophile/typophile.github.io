body: "Looking for some suggestions... We're working on an exhibit where the use of
  type, primarily on a large scale, is used within the space. Architects are already
  producing final drawings for the buildings we are working with, and we would like
  to incorporate interesting typographic elements on the buildings and inside the
  actual exhibit. Could be engravings, projections, wrought iron letters, etc. Just
  thought I'd mine this resource to see if anyone knew of folks doing interesting
  work in this area. One possible example we thought of is <a href=\"http://images.google.com/images?q=jenny+holzer&hl=en&lr=&sa=N&tab=ii&oi=imagest\">Jenny
  Holzer</a>.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n"

    I went through some classic books regarding this subject:\r\n\r\nAlan Bartram,
    Lettering in Architecture (1975)\r\nNicolete Grey, \"Lettering on Buildings\"
    (1960)\r\nLe Corbusier, \"Le Modulor\" (1954) {note that Le Corbusier in the beginning
    of the book describes typography as architecture}\r\n\r\nsome essays by Umberto

  body: I also am looking at a simalar topic for my major project. I am looking at
    when type becomes art and the cross-pollination of other design disciplines with
    typography. Enviromental graphics is a great area to look at with the ideas of
    type in spaces , Vince Frost has some really interesting work which has some relation
    to these topics.
