  any release of this typeface that comes with titling alternates or a dedicated all-caps
  titling style? How would you usually use it for all-caps titling?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nThomas

    Neue</a>, and it is Linotype's (although you can also purchase it at fonts.com
    and MyFonts.com).\r\n\r\nI don't know of any titling alternates for this family...
    This may not be the answer you are seeking, but if you feel that it needs some
    tracking in an all-caps setting, then you will have to do the tracking yourself.
    At most, if you are working in Illustrator or in InDesign, you could try using
    the Optical Kerning option to see if more letterspacing is created that way...
    But that usually happens with smaller point sizes. Sorry.  :-)"
