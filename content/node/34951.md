  occasion that we find truly moving type in public. Part of me loves this fact, as
  the discovery and appreciation of great type is a special treat. Another part of
  me gets impatient that not enough people (designers and general public alike) care
  about good typography, which, of course, means that there are poor design choices
  being made regularly, and published  nonetheless!\r\n\r\nAlas, my (our) obsession
  with type brings with it a curse: scrutiny of absolutely everything that uses letters.
  How many of us can read something without considering the appropriateness of the
  choices of typeface, proportion, kerning, leading, et cetera?\r\n\r\nFor better
  or worse, this is something we all must deal with on a day-to-day basis as typophiles.
  I'm curious to know how others handle this issue.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nRay"

    instance), I like to counter it by whistling as though I am tone-deaf. This requires
    abusing interval relationships, as well as pitch. \r\n\r\nI don't know why this
    helps, but I get a tremendous kick out of it. It isn't always easy for me, so
    it has the feel of an exercise. I sometimes wonder what someone in the next aisle
    might think if they overheard, but I figure that it should make them feel good
    about their own abilities.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I can think of no corollary application
    to your dilemma."

  body: "\"How many of us can read something without considering the [type]\"\r\n\r\nA
    good question. I read almost everything without considering the type. It is only
    when I am being paid to do so, or, if there is \"something wrong\" in something
    I'm obliged or attracted to reading that I do consider it. It did, however, take
    me no short time and it was incomplete until I'd made a decidedly type-sparse
    environment. From the refrigerator to approximately 6 miles in all directions,
    superfluous type is rare. \r\n\r\nThis is not to say that there are not incredibly
    dense areas of type in the home/office, but they are kept at bay and hardly ever
    left in the right-reading position. As this is the point of view a type of a designer-with-an-outlet,
    it may be different from that of a non-type designing typophile \u2014 i.e. I
    can say to myself, \"Well that looks bad\", when I trip over something bad from
    a print ad to an OS.  \"Poor thing.\" But then I can put it to rest by making
    sure whatever I saw wrong \"out there\" is right in the font , fonts, or composition
    in progress.\r\n\r\nGraphic designing typophiles must get similar satisfaction
    each time they don't do something bad they remember seeing done, don\u2019t they?
    If they don't I think they should. \r\n\r\nCheers\r\n"
