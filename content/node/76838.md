body: "A bit of shameless self-promotion: I\u2019ve just written a small <strong>extension
  for Google Chrome for Mac OS X</strong> that can aid Mac users to select webfonts
  that work well on Windows. It\u2019s called <strong>Crisp Text</strong> and installs
  a button in Google Chrome that allows the user to toggle the text rendering on any
  web page between unhinted antialiased (the Mac default display) and hinted black-and-white
  (which is what Windows users will see with smoothing turned off).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Crisp-Text_6075.png]\r\n\r\nIt
  works well with webfonts, so you can navigate to any webfont-offering service that
  uses live webfont previews and check the screen quality in the crudest of all environments
  (black-and-white aliased).\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a one-click install at the <strong><a
  href=\"https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/ifijlgjpdgojmjphpleniimbgbkbpedo\">Google
  Chrome extensions</a></strong> page (visit the link with Google Chrome, then click
  on Install). \r\n\r\nAfter installation, you'll see a small icon: \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/icon-16_5372.png]
  \r\nnext to the Chrome address bar. Clicking on it will turn font antialiasing off
  and on again. The extension is not perfect (you need to click twice on the button
  sometimes, and you need to activate the black-and-white rendering on every page),
  but it works well. \r\n\r\nIt only works on Google Chrome for Mac OS X. Windows
  users should use the system-wide font antialiasing switch (in Control Panel / Display).
  \r\n\r\nEnjoy,\r\nAdam"

    default when you turn off the anti-aliasing? (I believe OS X ignores hinting data
    entirely.) Just two questions that popped up. I'm liking this a lot, despite the
    step back \u2014 at least I don't have an excuse not to check anymore, and for
    my own font development, it's a lot easier to check the hinting like this."

  body: "David, \r\n\r\nI'm only exposing what's in the OS. No magic :) \r\n\r\nRob,
    \r\n\r\nthe black-and-white rendering does indeed use hinting to its full extent.
    It's switching to the \"old\" Apple TrueType rasterizer. Verdana and Georgia render
    pretty much identically to what they look like on Windows. There may be minimal
    differences due to some potential differences in how Apple and Microsoft treats
    some instructions, but really really minimal. \r\n\r\nActually, I was rather surprised
    that the CSS -webkit-font-smoothing:none property (which my tool simply applies
    to the \"body\" element of the HTML page -- there is no magic involved) works,
    and what results it delivers. I did not know that hinted TrueType display is possible
    in modern Cocoa apps, but well -- it seems that it works. \r\n\r\nAs I explained
    in the Typographica thread, I do not consider the tool an \"ultimate solution\",
    more a little helper that helps the lazy Mac user who does not own a Windows license
    to get a peek at what Windows rendering with ClearType disabled might look like.
    \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam\r\n"

  body: "Thanks, Adam. I also didn't think Cocoa apps would even parse the hinting
    data. Very nice in any case \u2014 it's not an \u201Cultimate tool\u201D, sure,
    but it makes the threshold for preliminary checking of hinting a fair bit lower."

    in \"Appearance\" with a range from 4 to 12. \r\n\r\nCheck and see if Lucida Grande
    anti-aliases still with your tool. "

    find printing to a PDF and viewing the font in that helpful, too. That isn't native
