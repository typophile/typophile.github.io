  of what fonts I used on my business card. I am in the process of recreating my business
  card so I can get it printed again in the future, but I need the font from the following
  picture. Thanks a bunch in advance!\r\n\r\nNote that I did edit the typeface a little,
  but the essence is still there."

  body: Thanks for the offer, but I already have it designed. (that is also kind of
    what I do in the business) I just need to recreate it and to do so I need that
    font. And once again, thanks for the font suggestions, but they aren't it.

    foundries). Would you recall anything about where you got your fonts, such as
    if you often downloaded them from free font sites? This could help with ideas
    about where to search.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: It is possible I downloaded it from a free site but the only clue I can think
    of would be that I would just browse them and download ones I liked. Well, that's
    not much of a clue, but yeah, that's how it worked. However, I don't think I downloaded
    that one. I think it either came with OS X or possibly an Adobe program (or another
    program for that matter) that I installed. The problem here though is that I have
    most of that stuff installed and it's not in there.

    can cross that search off. I''m pretty sure it isn''t part of Corel or the old
    Freehand bundle either. '

  body: "I've done some hard thinking and I think I might have remembered something...
    I'm pretty sure it's a free font I downloaded now. To help narrow it down, it
    would have been one of the first results in a google search for free fonts and
    more specifically, mac fonts. To help further, I would also bet that it's in the
    beginning of the alphabet for its name. The couple times I've gone to those font
    sites I would look through the first few letters of the alphabet and then get
    bored and do something else. However, it's also possible that it could be further
    in and just shown in a gallery or something also.\r\n\r\nAny help would be great!
    thanks!"
