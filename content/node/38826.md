body: "On the current topic of handling of fonts on the Web (via \"@font-face\" or
  .eot files), I have made a blog post and launched two related surveys (one of Web
  designers, one of font vendors).\r\n\r\nThe survey for font vendors is here:\r\nhttp://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=I9LYBFmggGJ8SCTU0u3CtQ_3d_3d\r\n\r\nThe
  survey for Web designers/producers is here:\r\nhttp://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=wyFVRRqnxAmTypkzThJOkA_3d_3d\r\n\r\nMy
  blog post is here:\r\nhttp://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2007/11/web_fonts_1.html\r\n\r\nComments
  welcome, and I hope all the font licensors represented here take the survey, as
  well as the Web designers.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
