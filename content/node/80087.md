body: "Hey Guys,\r\n\r\nI am doing on a project helping low vision children, as they
  have difficulties in reading the current fonts. I've done researched and survey,
  I've found out that there are certain rules while selecting fonts for them for reading
  or when creating fonts for them. I need your critique and feedbacks in helping me
  to improve it better. \r\n\r\nThe fonts are created with the following rules:\r\n-
  round edges\r\n- sans serif\r\n- fixed width\r\n- fixed height\r\n- bold stroke\r\n\r\nI
  currently have 3 versions of the font and is working on the 4th version now.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for you help, appreicated it.\r\n"
