<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi all. <br> <br>I just finished reading the transcript from the recent live crit. Almost needed color coding to follow all the conversation threads! More of these live crits are in order. <br> <br>One question in the chat that I wished I'd been involved with was "when to approach a distributor with you design?" Generally it seemed the response was: when you have something fairly "together" people will work with you to noodle and polish. <br> <br>I was recently in Ed Benguit</div>
<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>For example: <br> <br>Here is one of my cap/display efforts from the class. Sent off to ITC per the above. The reply was very positive, and(but?) included the following suggestions: <br> <br>1.Create a lower case <br>2. Enlarge to 3-6 weights <br>3. Add italics <br>4. Consider a condensed weight <br>5 (Where's the yen? :-) <br> <br>So perhaps hamburgefonts won't cut it, but the rest of the response indicated an excitement about the work so far, encouraging to a first timer. When and what do you send? <br> <br>Randy <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4102/5198.gif alt=submission></div>

<div class=commentbody>Once upon a time, oh, about anytime before 1986, ITC was the only decision you would have as a type designer. <br> <br>How quickly that has been forgotten. ITC was as hated as MS is today. Fortunately, they got caught with their pants down when DTP whizzed through. <br> <br>And fortunately, they recovered, and got humble.</div>

<div class=commentbody>ITC is just a subdivision of Agfa Monotype.

<div class=commentbody>How did you decide on ITC? <br> <br>Given Ed's history at ITC and the fact that the work was designed on his watch, it was a natural to submit there.

<div class=commentbody>To all of you successful, filthy rich typographers out there (and I'm hoping for a response?), <br> <br>When you submit a design for review: <br>1). How complete was it when you first sent it? <br>2). How complete was it when you got accepted? <br>3). What did you send that got accepted? (Full character set? Example as you see it used? PDF? Print outs? Totally finished font files? etc.) <br> <br>This info would be really helpful. Being new to the whole thing, I'm wondering how it works. I suspect at the highest levels there is reputation and personal connections that get you in the door. What about everyone else. <br> <br>Regards, <br>Randy</div>

<div class=commentbody>When I worked at HTF, we would receive submissions from designers who have already blown out their typeface into sixteen weights, complete with italics. And we would look at these and see (I should say, Jonathan would see) some basic letterform design issues in the core weight. At that late stage, to suggest a revision would demand design changes to several dozen fonts, and the work that would entail would seem prohibitive. <br> <br>So I'm with Ed Benguiat on this one. </div>

<div class=commentbody>The first time I submited (as described) a typeface it was longtime ago, probably Angie, my first one to FF. In fact, I just send the a basic character set (suh panels done for Morisawa, it was in 1990). But this was before I start to design with computers. They don't have done any comments, I just decided how many weights, etc. <br> <br>Then, i submited Anisette to FB circa 1995/96, there, they asked for hamburgefonstiv and some others trials if you have, such weights, etc. <br> <br>Then, they reviewed it and ask for corrections, etc. <br> <br>Now, its my own boss who decide if he accept my designs, generally he is quite cool with me and we have same feelings on letterforms. <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>This is truly a powerful thread. I'm like Randy, very new to the game. It would be nice to see this info compiled into a handy PDF document for people like us to use as research. <br> <br>I believe the best answer I've recieved so far from anyone is this. Don't sell your first fonts, hand them out for free. By doing this you will get a lot more people downloading your font. By doing this you will find out if your font is truly perfect. Are all the contours closed? Are there kerning pairs that you didn't account for? Guaranteed that someone in the world will find something wrong. You also can get a name for yourself and start to generate a little traffic through your web site. Develop a fan base of sorts. <br> <br>Anyways, that's my two cents. I'd like to think that some of my early fonts could start generating cash, but I have a long road ahead of me (much like any starting typographer). If you look at type web sites almost everyone has a free font for download. Chank told me this once: All my free fonts are either very old fonts, or fonts I don't wish to continue on creating glyphs. I think that's a good piece of advice. Get as many of these buggers under your arms. Once you decide your path then take the good ones from the bad ones. <br> <br>Did I go too far off the original subject? <br> <br>t1m</div>

<div class=commentbody>Tim, I would have to, by instinct, disagree with you on a couple of things. <br> <br>First, I would not want to use my market to test my designs. They should ( my designs ) be perfected before they are released. It would seem an unfortunate situation that the first impression of your foundry or type face would be riddled with issues. I would give your market more credit. The name you get for yourself might not be good with incomplete efforts. <br> <br>Second, "Get as many of these buggers under your arms.". I would rather have one design of top quality than ten of half of the first. In other words, quality not quantity. I believe Bringhurst could be referenced for a much more eloquent version of this statement. As a painter, I totally agree with Picasso</div>

<div class=commentbody>Randy, <br> <br>Please don't be mad at me. I have kind of moved, in my own way, this topic to "Release". <br> <br>"Release" not "Build". <br> <br>I hope I am not out of line here. But as Tim said, this <i>is</i> a powerful thread. My hopes are, despite it's irony, that it will get even more attention there. Also, I really want to see that "Build" area built. It is a really great area of discussion that seems to me under used.

<div class=commentbody>> interpolation <br> <br>Since the computer can't guess what you want, it needs <i>two</i> fonts (like a Light and a Bold) to create more weights automatically*. Fog can do interpolation, but it seems FontLab's is better, not least because you can <i>extrapolate</i> too, and can often interpolate adequately between totally different fonts! <br> <br>* You can also create lighter/darker weights from a single font, but that's not interpolation, and it generally requires a lot of clean-up, as well as adjustments (like making the thins thinner/thicker). <br> <br>hhp <br></div>
