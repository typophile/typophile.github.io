body: "Hi\r\n\r\nI am in the process of building a website setted in Museo [[http://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/museo.html]]
  .\r\n\r\nI will embed the font with @font-face so no need for sifr and the likes.\r\n\r\nI
  have a couple of questions for you experts : )\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I am looking
  for a good companion italic for the font (it misses one), what do you think of museo
  slab http://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/museoslab.html ? Could it fit?\r\n\r\nSecond,
  do you think Museo can be a good font for body text or is it best to limit its use
  to titels and short bursts of text?\r\n\r\nThird, in case you think the font is
  not suited for body text, could be museo sans [[http://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/museosans.html]]
  \ a decent one?\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "The lighter weights of Museo are excellent body types, you just have to find
    creative ways to handle the lack of an italic. I found that using Fontin provides
    a nice contrast to Museo and it\u2019s more interesting than just being obvious
    and using the old regular/italic standbys. "

  body: "Thanks for your reply.\r\n\r\nSorry but I am not native english language
    speaker, could you explain the meaning of  \"old regular/italic standbys\" ?\r\n\r\nAnd,
    \ if i don't ask for too much ; ) what you think about using the italic from Museo
    Slab?\r\n\r\ng."

    couple of days away.
