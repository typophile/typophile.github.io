  body: Almost certainly hand drawn. I worked on a book on Lucy and the closest I
    could find &#40;at the time&#41; was <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/coronet-rr/bold/testdrive.html?s=I%2BLove%2BLucy&amp;p=60"
    target="_blank">Coronet Bold.</a> But there are a lot more fonts out there now.

  body: I have been looking at &#34;I Love Lucy&#34; sites on the web and I have seen
    at least three different representations of the show title. Remember that this
    show was on TV originally in 1951, about 35 years before digital fonts. Most of
    the marketing since then has been using whatever they could find that was similar.
    For example, one product that I saw had a type style that looked a lot like <a
    href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/kaufmann/bold/testdrive.html?s=I%20Love%20Lucy&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Kaufmann</a>, which was a metal type from 1936 that has been digitized.
    That one at least is believable as a possible model for the show&#39;s lettering.
    <BR> <BR>What does the one you want to match look like? Please post an image.
