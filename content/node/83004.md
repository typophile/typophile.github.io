  in L.A. Noire, the game has some lovely use of typefaces scattered around the city
  but this one stands out.\r\n\r\nhttp://media.multiplayer.it/thumbs/images/2011/05/16/la_noire_screenshot_363_jpg_640x360_upscale_watermark-small_q85.jpg\r\nhttp://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110518224142/lanoire/images/9/96/UponReflection.jpg\r\nhttp://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110520194017/lanoire/images/0/06/TheGoldenButterfly.jpg\r\n\r\nIt's
  slightly extruded.\r\n\r\nI thought it maybe Knockout, or Trade Gothic Condensed.
  \ But I'm not entirely confident...\r\n\r\nAny help appreciated!"
