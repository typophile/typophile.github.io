  & main conference) and am really looking forward to attending. Of course, between
  transport, accommodation and entrance fee, it gets a bit expensive...\r\n\r\nSo,
  I was wondering if there are any other folk planning on going who would be interested
  / willing in splitting a room for the duration of the conference. \r\n\r\nFeel free
  to contact me or leave a comment!\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n"
