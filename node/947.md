  body: I know! How cruel is that? It actually would have been under 2 minutes had
    the image shown up right away and I hadn&#39;t spent time clicking the link over
    and over... Still, this ID has come up before. As Hrant says, &#34;Come on, Trajan?&#34;
    <BR> <BR>By the way, I think the overall leader, at least for 2003, must be Yves.
    2002 is probably close between Yves and Stewf. But I haven&#39;t counted &#39;em
    up.

  body: haha! Actually I had talked with Tamye about helping plan some special events
    for TypeCon 2004.... and I was thinking of an ID game sponsored by Typophile.
    Perhaps we should work out the details here as a group, then take it to TypeCon?

  body: If it ends up as a restricted group of participants, maybe the Typophile speed
    chart &#40;or a combination of speed and success numbers&#41; should determine
    the &#34;panelists&#34;? That might help boost Typophile membership too. Even
    more, I mean. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    about six months ago. It would involve a bunch of things, including Type IDs.

    I think I&#39;d make a decent panelist, but you won&#39;t find me on the speed
    charts because I&#39;m hampered by an incredibly slow modem. <BR> <BR>Would a
    live ID contest be &#34;open book&#34;? And in what form -- online access? Specimens
    and catalogs at hand? <BR> <BR>I think a &#34;closed book&#34; contest might separate
    the geeks from the googlers. <BR> <BR>-- K.

    I think it should be done with paper and pencil and no computer. In the long run
    it isn&#39;t the link to the font that matters, it is the name. Ok, well, that&#39;s
    my opinion. '

    And I realize now that he&#39;s right: it would in fact skew the results to the
    affluent&#42;. On the other hand, if it could be made to benefit Typophile &#40;through
    a closed selection from paying members&#41;, then that might be justifiable. <BR>
    <BR>&#42; This, even though people who can&#39;t afford a fast connection are
    unlikely to show up at TC2004 anyway... <BR> <BR>BTW, Tiffany, you want us to
    <i>draw</i> the font to be identified?!  ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'
