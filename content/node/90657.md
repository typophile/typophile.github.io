  body: "You could use either Microsoft VOLT or FL 5.1 and with the latter you have
    to change the kern code, because fontlab doesn't generate kern for right to left
    scripts yet. but with VOLT it's pretty straight forward, just generate the font
    in fontlab and import it in VOLT. there is adobe arabic VOLT file that could demonstrate
    how it works:\r\n\r\nhttp://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2007/06/adobe_arabic_sa.html"
