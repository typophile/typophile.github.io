  body: 'Pretty nice! A useful design for titling - could work great in a newspaper.
    <BR> <BR>- The &#34;f&#34; could be less shy. <BR>- The &#34;g&#34; is too calligraphic;
    and I&#39;d make its ear Goudy-style. <BR>- Both the lc and -especially- the UC
    &#34;k&#34;/&#34;K&#34; are unhappy. <BR>- The &#34;r&#34; is too sharp. <BR>-
    The &#34;L&#34; seems too narrow. <BR>- Nice &#34;Q&#34;. I might disconnect the
    far left of the cross-stroke from the left body curve. <BR>- The ascending &#34;4&#34;
    isn&#39;t working. The numerals are great overall though. <BR>- The acute, grave
    and tilde seem a hair too strong. <BR>- I&#39;d flatten the UC accents. <BR>-
    I might make the exclamation and question marks stronger. <BR>- The curly braces
    could be more interesting. <BR> <BR>Spacing: I think your overall letterspacing
    is good, but the word space too small. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: Yes, nice work! <BR> <BR>-E and F seems too narrow &#40;or maybe it&#39;s
    the G that is too wide?&#41;; <BR>-x could be slightly narrower; <BR>-the 2 looks
    weak, thicken its horizontal stroke; <BR>-the figures seem too thin. <BR> <BR>Somehow
    this reminds of ITC Garamond and Lucida Bright, but I also see a certain influence
    from Sumner Stone. <BR>

  body: 'Nice quick improvements! <BR>- I&#39;d make the tail connector &#40;the thick
    diagonal stroke&#41; on the &#34;g&#34; slightly heavier on the bottom-right than
    the top-left. Look at Binney &amp; Ronaldson #2 &#40;AKA Oxford, AKA Monticello&#41;
    for a really good model for that structure of &#34;g&#34;. Or Patria&#39;s for
    a more pronounced difference between the two ends. <BR>- I think the gaps in &#34;B&#34;,
    &#34;P&#34; and &#34;R&#34; need to be bigger. <BR>- The counters of the &#34;N&#34;
    are imbalanced. <BR>- I prefer the top numerals, although that lower &#34;5&#34;
    is killer. <BR>- The blank space is a perfect size now. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: 'Hi, <BR>I had a quick glance: <BR> <BR>- &#39;a&#39;: the left vertical extremepoint
    on the bowl should be lower. <BR>- &#39;c&#39; and &#39;e&#39;: although I like
    their form, I get the impression that they tend to fall to the left. Maybe a little
    more wheight in the lower left part. <BR>- &#39;o&#39;: the rightside is perfect,
    the leftside isnt as good. I would have a look at this. <BR>-&#39;s&#39; and &#39;S&#39;:
    The middlepart should be a little higher. Although I like the imbalance which
    occurs between both white innerforms, I think this doesnt fit with the rest of
    the characters. <BR>-&#39;A&#39;: right stem should be lighter. <BR>-&#39;B&#39;:
    bowls should be fatter. <BR>-&#39;D&#39;: Bowl should be lighter. <BR>-&#39;5&#39;
    &#40;top&#41;: horizontal streak should be longer. <BR>- Eurosign: why did you
    make a sign which is conform the &#39;official&#39; rules ? Be creative. For example
    you made a slanted serif, which is the only one in the whole font. <BR>- I like
    your lower five as well. Why didnt you use a similar form for your questionmark
    ? <BR> <BR>This a very nice typeface ! <BR> <BR>regards, <BR>--Jacques'
