    have to post that sometime. A ''letter'' is an old American school thing when
    you have played s high school sport at the highest level they gave you a certificate
    and a felt letter like a ''D'' for Dedham high. When I graduated I got 2 letters
    one in ''soccer'' and one in ''baseball'' but all we got was some bad certificate
    and a tshirt and a light jacket for 2 sports, '
