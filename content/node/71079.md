    Windows were. \r\n\r\nBut this is a tired, old, silly debate.\r\n\r\nIf and when
    the day comes that a magic hole is found in OSX requiring us all to fork over
    $40 to Mr. Norton, so be it, but it's hardly a valid point to be dwelling on while
    writing one's anti-apple manifesto. \r\n\r\nTo get the discussion back on track,
    I like where Apple is going in shying away from Flash. I'm not going to miss it.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    I'd like them to also realize that as they push for open web standards, they really
    shouldn't be doing silly things like requiring Safari. Granted, I'm sure they
    know what they're doing and it's that their main demographic really just doesn't
    care. They are mainly focusing on the iOS these days and I can sort of concede
    that WebKit and Safari will be the primary presentation layer technologies being
    used.  \r\n\r\nGiven that HP/Palm's WebOS is also heading down that path, that
    might be the one to keep an eye on. "

    excels in so many categories that HTML5 can't even begin to touch right now. Hulu
    put it well:\r\n\r\n<em>We continue to monitor developments on HTML5, but as of
    now it doesn't yet meet all of our customers' needs. Our player doesn't just simply
    stream video, it must also secure the content, handle reporting for our advertisers,
    render the video using a high performance codec to ensure premium visual quality,
    communicate back with the server to determine how long to buffer and what bitrate
    to stream, and dozens of other things that aren't necessarily visible to the end
    user.</em>\r\n\r\nAnd Apple knows that 90% of MacOS users don't know all this,
    and they so easily brainwash tons of people to think that HTML5 is the savior
    (again, not specifically you... just a lot of people I've talked to on the subject.)
    Granted, it will be an excellent addition to web standards, but there's no reason
    to say it's completely better than Flash.\r\n\r\nAnd as for paying $40 for Norton...
    nobody I know who owns a PC has anything like that on their computer. Only moms

    who works at Adobe (but is not an official representative) I don't really see
    it that way. It just so happens that for a long time Flash was a better way to
    do certain things that were not possible with HTML. HTML5 will likely do a great
    many of those same things and some of them it will do better. But some of them
    it will do worse. And it is likely that there are some things that HTML5 + CSS3
    will not do that Flash can do without loads of additional work. (hyphenation anyone?)
    It's Apple's choice what to support with their products, but I am of the opinion
    that their customers would be better served if they had the option of running
    Flash content if they choose. My only regret is that Android is not as mature
    and fully intuitive as iOS or I would fully be on that bandwagon. *sigh*"

    not comparable. If this is anybody\u2019s fault, than it\u2019s Macromedia\u2019s.\r\n\r\nBy
    the way, they also stopped LiveMotion, which I had purchased (2nd hand) and which
    was much more intuitive than Flash. (I purchased it, when I already did know,
    that they were going to stop the development. But I directly felt home in LiveMotion.)
    Discontinuing the development of their own software is more in the responsibility
    of Adobe. I don\u2019t know, if you are right with the price. It\u2019s not only
    dependent from the costs of the development, but also from the number of sold
    licenses. And with regard to the protection of the software, Adobe is generous.
    I assume, that Photoshop is illegally used on 90% of all computers, on which it
    is installed. Maybe that\u2019s Adobe\u2019s way, to make people addicted and
    to get their monopoly position. (Microsoft follows the same politics: Let the
    Chinese use Windows illegally and in ten years they have no alternative anymore.)
    But at least Adobe does not tell dishonest shit about moral values.\r\n\r\nImageReady
    also was great. Adobe should not have stopped the development."
