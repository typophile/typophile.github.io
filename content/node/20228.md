    showing is much much more legible\r\nthan the other way around. You see this pointed
    out\r\nin many typography books.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Paul Kohlers claimed that the right half of both upper and lowercase Latin
    type contained the most salient cues, and showed that text with the right half
    available was more legible than text with the left half available.\r\n \r\nKohlers
    also looked at removing the top and bottom half of text, and found that lowercase
    was more legible when the top half was available and that uppercase was more legible
    when the bottom half was available.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that each letter has it\u2019s
    unique identification cues, and that these studies demonstrate the most frequent
    location for these cues, but don\u2019t limit the possibility that the unique
    identification cue for a lowercase letter may be in the lower left quadrant. \r\n\r\nCheers,

  body: This may have something to do with the cursive writing on which the lower
    case letter shapes are based. The letter forms evolved, to some degree, to facilitate
    efficient joining. The lower left quadrant is the part of the letter which is
    least involved in joining with its neighbours.

  body: "> each letter has it\u2019s unique identification cues\r\n\r\nAlfred Kallir,
    in his fascinating and unique \"Sign and Design\",\r\ncalls these cues the letters'
    \"acrocratic\" features. I used to use\r\nthat term, but thanks to Peter I realized
    I should really grasp\r\nthe concept of cues much better before using a term for
    them.\r\n\r\nAlso, there's the venerable grunge font \"You Can Read Me\"*\r\nwhich
    tries to leverage this sort of thing:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-you-can-read-me/\r\n\r\n*
    Which was originally called the more tentative, and I\r\nfeel more honest \"Can
    You Read Me?\" back when it was\r\nreleased as a Fuse Font.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
