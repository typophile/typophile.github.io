    my mind I was really thinking of <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/fb-nobel/nobel-bold/\">FontBureau's
    Nobel</a>\r\n\r\nand 2 looks like it could be the Nobel light from FB with the
    M from Futura light and N of DTL Nobel light with a slight stroke added to FB
    Nobel and Futura.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture11_5030.png]"
