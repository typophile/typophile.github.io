  which has 72 fonts for $284. The catch is it is only in postscript. I have lots
  of postscript fonts but usually buy open type now. Will there be a problem in the
  future with using postscript fonts? I don't have $432 for the open type bundle or
  I would go that way.\r\n\r\nSharon\r\n\r\nI realize this is a dumb question but......."

  body: "Really no cheap packages available for John Sans in open type. I think I'll
    have to pick another font. Would Freight sans be similar in feel to John Sans?
    It isn't offered in open type, though, just postscript and true type. Or The Sans?
    I want something like John Sans. Maybe Storm has an easy payment plan.\r\n\r\nI
    think John Sans is reasonably priced. I just wish it had more package options.\r\n\r\nSharon"

  body: I'd email Storm to see if they will be releasing in OT soon. I was given an
    update (this was a few years ago) free when he released the fonts in OT.

  body: Thanks, Tiffany. John Sans is offered in OT already. There just aren't any
    small packages. The postscript package I wanted is offered in OT, but it's quite
    a bit more. I guess I'll just have to decide on a few weights and pay full price.

  body: "Thanks so much, Tiffany. I love Parisine but I need more weights. I think
    I'll just buy a few of John Sans from My Fonts so I can avoid the euro prices.
    I hate to sound so cheap.\r\n\r\nMy favorite foundry right now is [[http://www.vllg.com/|Vllg]].
    I can get the National family with 24 fonts for $250. I love their catalog and
    I love their prices and their service is wonderful.\r\n\r\nThanks again for responding,
    Tiffany. \r\n\r\nSharon"
