  particular font or b) the applications of the font\r\nMy font is Perpetua \r\nI
  would like to know in general when would you use this font or how you generally
  view this font\r\nAny ideas much appreciated"

    i always view it as a forgotten font-- i mean i dont think about it that much
    and for me is never chosen first for anything '

  body: "Upon further research I realize what a historic font Perpetua really is.\r\nIt's
    classic, elegant, light, recognizably British, versatile, serene and subtle...\r\nI'm
    kind of glad that I'm doing Perpetua for my animatic.\r\nI was thinking of incorporating
    Gill's line drawings into my animatic if I was to focus on the creative attributes
    of the font.\r\nBut now this project seems like a lot of fun.\r\nThank you for
    all your help "

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/avisad_5153.jpg]\r\n\r\nThis is a full
    page ad (8 1/8\" x 10 7/8\") that ran in magazines like Playboy in the late 1960s,
    art directed by Helmut Krone, written by Paula Green. \"No. 1\" (Hertz) is never
    mentioned. It was kinda ballsy to set the entire ad in Perpetua Bold, 18 or 24
    pt text. But the effect is nonetheless very literate and classy -- no clutter
    such as logos and other branding.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Unknown_4807.jpeg]"

  body: "This is gold. \r\nIf my project was to be marked on research alone I think
    I would be set. It's interesting to see Perpetua set as the only font for the
    advert. Just proves its versatility I guess"
