  body: Thanks, Jan. I'm wondering what CS3 standard or readily available fonts I
    have might be substituted for it, considering I won't be buying this font. bookman
    is the only thing that comes to mind.

  body: "Well, both fonts are slab serifs. Bookman isn\u2019t. I don\u2019t know what
    fonts come with CS3, but if you want to substitute the ones in the sample it should
    be slab serifs like maybe Serifa for <em>ready set</em>."

  body: First substitue for <em>Crack!</em> that comes to my mind (condensed slab
    with ball terminals) is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/clarendon/">Clarendon
    Condensed from Bitstream</a>.
