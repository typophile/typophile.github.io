body: "Hey everyone.\r\n\r\nMy communication design course at art university wants
  every student to create a booklet which is supposed to accompany an ad campaign
  for a chosen subject. Each and everyone of us needs to present our work early next
  year.\r\n\r\nI have NO idea for an effective ad campaign (newspapers) yet... ;-)
  However... I thought - why not start with my booklet then, as I did some profound
  research concerning my topic.\r\n\r\nI like the typefaces which were created for
  the relaunch of the UKs daily \"The Guardian\" a lot. I would have loved to choose
  them for lead-ins and headlines in my presentation as well. Another typeface I love
  (and which was also awarded by the TDC) is \"Greta\". However, due to Christmas
  and other heavy expenses and my life as a poor design student, ;-) I had to settle
  for Lucida Std which I found on my Mac and thought of it as a good alternative for
  headlines and bigger sized lead-ins...\r\n\r\nI think about combining it with one
  of the following typefaces (for continuous text):\r\nBliss Pro, Vista Sans or Dax...
  I've attached a screen shot of those three, with Vista Sans being my favorite at
  the moment, for the simple reason that I feel it might be more readable (in small
  print) although it's \"f\" and \"l\" collide for example.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think
  - I feel the two typefaces might go well together, I'm no type specialist, so I
  might be completely wrong as well - that's why I ask you guys :-)\r\n\r\nThanks
  a lot & happy new year,\r\nJan\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture3_4119.png]"

    It's a [[ligature]]. You can turn it <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/emigre/vista_sans_book/?sample_text=fl%C3%BCchtet&sample_size=14&acs_p=1&acs_pt=24&acs=1\">off</a>
    if you don't like the effect."
