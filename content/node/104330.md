  body: "1970, the era of photo-composition lettering. The closest available design
    is from Letraset, Compacta Bold Outline, designed by Fred Lambert for Letraset
    in 1963-5:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CompactaBoldOutline_5902.jpg]\r\nIt
    has been published by Eisner + Flake as <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/elsnerflake/compacta_bold_outline_ot/\">Compacta
    Bold Outline OT</a>.\r\nThere was also a Compacta Outline which was slightly narrower
    & with lighter lines. AFAIK no digital version, but I stand to be informed.\r\nDon"
