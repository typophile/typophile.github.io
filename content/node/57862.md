  design or visualize something but so far my finding have not been quite what I m
  looking for, I was wondering if anyone here of the top of the head would know one?\r\n\r\nThanks

  body: "You think of book, or theory quotes?Maybe you should narrow your search,
    general visualization is maybe too abstract. What do you want to visualize?\r\n\r\nNow
    that I think about it, In 2 years currently doing BA in design, there was no general
    formula on how to visualize something - answer was research, research, research.
    \r\n\r\nProbably ton of books were written on this subject."

  body: "@ James, YES! Why didn't I think of that?\r\n\r\n@ Ravel, its not that I
    m having trouble visulising this particular piece of work, I have but it was difficult
    to do it in the end, well do it in a different and hopefully more interesting
    way, so I was looking for a quote to insert into it to compliment it as I went
    around in a less then usual way. \r\n\r\nTo be more clear, I built the LHC out
    of house hold goods. So I have a photograph of it, and I want quote to put into
    that's about how hard it can be to visulise/design something, hope thats more
    clear?\r\n\r\nThe four that I have that sort of work are\r\n\r\n\"\"Visualize
    this thing that you want, see it, feel it, believe in it. Make your mental blue
    print, and begin to build.\"\r\n- Robert Collier\"\r\n\r\n\"Incredibly complex
    systems turn out to be governed by few and very easily comprehensible rules, where
    the complexity is totally invisible until the system is examined as a whole\"\r\n\r\n\"We
    favor the simple expression of the complex thought. We are for the large shape
    because it has the impact of the unequivocal\"\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes we needed no
    words at all, but merely shared the flow of imagery in our two minds\"\r\n\r\nThanks
    alot"
