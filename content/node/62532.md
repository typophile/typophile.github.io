body: "I have used @font-face in a web page using BPdots-Squares (from backpacker.gr)
  and noticed something weird. The typeface is OTF and has a set of stylistic alternates
  for several greek characters (using ss01, salt, tilt and liga open type features
  to generate them). So, the weird thing is that while various browsers (namely, IE,
  Opera, Chrome and Safari) ignore the stylistic alternates (as it was expected),
  Mozilla doesn't (as shown in the example below):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/explorer_3951.png]Explorer\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/chrome_5891.png]Chrome\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mozilla_4736.png]Mozilla
  (as you can see characters \u03BC, \u03C1, \u03C6, \u03B8, \u03B2 and \u03B3 are
  different - all of them are characters that belong to the stylistic alternates set)\r\n\r\nCan
  anyone explain why this might be happening?"

    by a certain glyph), the will do so in any OT savvy program. Firefox is the only
    browser that support OT as far as I know.'
