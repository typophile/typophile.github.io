body: implicit is a east coast based house dj, when speaking to him about how he saw
  his work, he expressed himself alot about being part constructor/scientist .. being
  very focussed about his precision and skill in his mixing <BR>i wanted to convey
  his love of a&#41; simplicity and the meeting between scientific &#40;metaphoricly
  math/ simplicity in combination of forms&#41; and music &#40;flow/change&#41; <BR>

  body: ' Christian - distinctive and clever considering the name and the genre, house
    music. To me, it seems okay that the &#39;i&#39; stems are not there because of
    the nature of the client and his work. <BR> <BR>Maybe it wouldn&#39;t work for
    a dot com or something, but it seems appropriate for the genre. <BR> <BR>also
    enjoyable is seeing the process. <BR>what did implicit say about the logo? <BR>

    i couldn&#39;t work on the cd cover for which the logo was created, due to bad
