body: If you're going to tattoo a pangram on your leg, probably a good idea to proofread
  and make sure it has all the letters! [[http://carnetdhonneur.blogspot.com/2009/06/fox-tatoo.html|D'oh!]]

    tattoo anyway.

  body: "I'm dreaming of <em>Heiz\xF6lr\xFCcksto\xDFabd\xE4mpfung</em> all the way
    down my spine. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, maybe <em>The quick brown fox jumped
    over the lazy dog</em> is actually a deep, subtly philosophical hint at the inevitable
    passing of time. \r\nMaybe."

  body: "I've seen it too. I've even seen \"sleeping\" added before \"dog\" to get
    the s in, instead of making the verb \"jumps.\"* The expectation of past tense
    in animal stories is strong, I guess.\r\n\r\n*or pluralizing \"dogs,\" which is
    what this tattoo victim should probably do. Unless he's going for the subtle philosophical
    commentary thing."
