body: "Happy new year and Hi everybody!\r\n\r\nI'm working on my personal type foundry
  Logo. My foundry is called typesuisse, but I'll keep the .ch in the logo, because
  the whole thing is based as a website. I did a few sketches and I came up with this
  Idea.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Typophile_3942.jpg]\r\n\r\nI started
  with the Letter T and combined it with a (swiss) cross. The cross T monogram will
  be used as Icon. Then I continued with the rest of the letters, trying to keep the
  thickness of the Monogram. As you can see, I got two different version. A has the
  simple shape of the grid I used and in B I tried to change the letter E and S, so
  it looks not like a laying capitol M and N. \r\n\r\nI would appreciate if you could
  give me feedback.\r\n\r\nCheers! "

  body: I definitely am drawn to Option B more, because it seems to look more locked
    into its own space, whereas Option A feels more like a quick sketch that could
    slide around, if that makes sense. I don't know if the T feels totally integrated
    yet, just because I don't see the relationship of that curve to anything else
    in the word.

  body: "Christian, i like where this is going.\r\n\r\nsome thoughts:\r\n\r\nit seems
    like there's a square dynamic competing with a diagonal dynamic.\r\n\r\nthe y-p
    are basic square forms \u2014 is it possible to make them match the E-S a bit
    more?\r\n\r\nmaybe the y and p are okay, but the 't' doesn't fit in (rounded connector
    between horiz. and vertical stem)\r\ndid you try the swiss cross by itself?\r\n\r\nalso,
    the crossbar on the 't' feels too thick, and heavy on the left.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I think the first version will work more successfully at small sizes. Whereas
    the second, specifically the S shapes and the serifs, will become too small a
    detail and too thin at small sizes. The SS pair seems too loose to me. I'd be
    curious about BJ's comments, but wonder if, again, to get them to be square the
    S becomes too thin?

  body: "Thanks for the reply!\r\n\r\nHere is another option, with the swiss cross
    as you mentioned bjharvey and the Y & P with diagonals.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Typophile_4643.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnd
    another option with different S's and tighter kerning\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Typophile_6535.jpg]\r\n__________________________________________________\r\nFischers

  body: "You'll have to be careful with the Y not to look as a V. I was also thinking
    of the swiss cross to use instead of a full T, but I was thinking of it to lift
    it up to line it up as if it was a T (just as if you would remove the bottom curve
    from the T and leave the cross lifted).\r\n\r\nOtherwise I'm leaning more toward
    C version compared to A nd D. You could also give some stem slant on letter \"c\"
    in CH. And maybe even on the right side of U but with backward slant to close
    it a bit and make it a bit less squarish and rigid."

  body: "I like the concept a lot. As soon as I saw the \"t\" I said, \"Hey, it's
    the Swiss cross!\" haha\r\n\r\nI'm still undecided which version I like the best.
    But with versions B & C, the E's looks somewhat like the Greek sigma, so I started
    seeing Greek characters, which are obviously not Swiss-like."

  body: I'm liking D due to the slightly more contrast between the S and E. I agree
    about the curve on the 't' though...it doesn't quite blend with the rest. Can
    you get away with using a sharp corner on the 't' as well?

  body: "Hello\r\n\r\nhere is an update with the cross lined up to the top and more
    black space (contrast). Thanx for all your input, I might have to rethink the
    lettershapes afterall, esspecially \xABS\xBB and \xABE\xBB. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Typophile_4934.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Typophile_6323.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
    will leave this concept for a while and start to come up with more ideas. I'm
    not happy with it yet. If you have some ideas feel free to tell me. \r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n__________________________________________________\r\nFischers

  body: F and G versions have too thin strokes. The cross now looks like a plus and
    doesn't associate with switzerland anymore. I'd only the y in the E version and
    stop.

    of your logo and call it quits... with BW version at least. And start on colours...
