  body: "I think this was done by adding white stroke to 'erode' the serifs and thinner
    strokes. This sample I have attached was made with Monotype Bodoni, and didn't
    eliminate the places where the curves joined the stems, but those could be edited
    out. They probably used a different baseline font, but you can see how it works.\r\n\r\n-
