  well, I'm not a font designer by profession so I'm posting it here if anyone wants
  to have a go at it. For future reference, I hereby relinquish all rights to it.\r\n\r\nIt's
  all angles, so I'm tentatively calling it Angul (feel free to rename). The inspiration
  was: I've been handwriting a lot of numbers in cramped spaces at work, and my 3
  has come to look like a backwards uppercase Sigma, so I went from there and got
  a whole alphanumeric set.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/angul_3984.jpg]\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nYawar\r\n"

    just a quick & dirty job using a rather small grid (5x8 essentially).\r\nThat
    said, (tri)angular scripts are a pretty common constrain feature. Either out of
    necessity (see runes: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runic_alphabet) or design choiche
    (see Def Leppard: http://www.metal-rules.com/zine/images/stories/concerts/2008%20SWEDENROCK/logo/def_leppard_logo.jpg)."

    and Tolkien's Elvish script, but had no idea there were so many others.\r\n\r\n@riccard0:
    Wow, that was fast! Did you use something like FontForge or a specialised system
    (or both)? I have some interesting tweaks I'd like to try....\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nYawar\r\n"

    sitting around gathering dust in the flat file somewhere.
