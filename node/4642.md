body: Hello all. First post here. Great place you guys have here. <BR> <BR>This is
  a masthead Im working on for my new site. We are a design and application development
  company, just starting out. This is quite simple and I would like to keep it as
  simple as possible. <BR> <BR>Could anyone give me some suggestions on how to improve
  it. Colors, kerning, face, etc. <BR> <BR>Thank you <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/35320.gif"

  body: Sorry, but this doesn&#39;t really have anything to do with anything, other
    than I thought of it when I read your post. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.pulsemanagement.com/"
    target="_blank">http://www.pulsemanagement.com/</a> <BR> <BR>Your logo concept
    is very clean, but I&#39;m not &#34;feeling&#34; anything. I think that the word
    &#34;pulse&#34; requires a design that pulls in the viewer and makes them feel
    something within

  body: You also need a tagline or something to explain pulse, being its brand new.
    People don&#39;t get it unless you smack them between the eyes. For all I know
    pulse could be a walk-in clinic.

  body: are you playing off of the tounge? If so, I&#39;d make the colon blue as well.
    <BR> <BR>If not, then loose the colon, &#39;cause I just see a tounge sticking
    out :p <BR> <BR>;o&#41;

  body: Excellent sugestions, thank you. Its great to be able to have new sets of
    eyes on this. Its odd, I didnt even think of the tongue sticking out, that should
    have been the first thing to strike me. :p <BR> <BR>I will revise it and post
    some of the ideas. <BR> <BR>Any thoughts on the relation of the face &#40;Neutraface&#41;
    to the type of biz? I purchased this font because I thought it was really beautiful
    and clean, but I am definately not married to it for this logo.

  body: Neutraface is a great choice. How many weights did you purchase? Its a very
    good face for a design business.

    big close up of a cropped face &#40;w/&#34;hairy nostrils and chipped teeth&#34;&#41;
    in b&amp;w, and a postcard palm tree in color. WOW! Did I forget to mention the
    heart monitor.

    I really like the idea of rhythm and beat.

  body: hey Dave... i agree with the folks here... i really don&#39;t know by looking
    at the logo what its about... what the company is about... i really like the typeface
    and the nice soft blues u have used.. maybe trying to push the idea of Pulse a
    bit ?.. as u are playing with colours here... how bout tryin to show pulse with
    colours ? ... for some reason everytime i look at the logo i feel that the 2 dots
    are not placed properly and are too much at the bottom relating to the form of
    the letter &#34;P&#34;  how bout tryin to make them a bit smaller and takin them
    up by 1-2 points ? ... good luck

  body: Thank you everyone for taking a look and letting me know what you think, I
    truly appreciate the time and effort. <BR> <BR>Ive been think about somehow trying
    to get acoss with the logo, that we are a design/application company.  Im at a
    loss. Im trying to keep it a simple as possible, using only elements of type in
    the logo. <BR> <BR>Do you think it necessary to have a tagline for instance. If
    you saw IBM logo for the first time ever, would you know that that were about
    computers and related technology? This is what is stumping me on this one.  <BR>
    <BR>On one hand, of course, I would love to be able to get the idea across instantly.
    On the other, I think that the site and related print materials will do the job.
    <BR> <BR>Opinions much appreciated. <BR> <BR>Here are a few variations. <BR> <BR><img

  body: hey again Dave... with these ones when i look at them i think of some music
    company or any company relating to sound...  also try using the letter &#34;L&#34;
    with the blue instead of having &#34;P&#34; as blue coz it might show &#34;pulse&#34;
    with colours... but  i dont think it would be a solution to your problem because
    it will lay too much attention on the &#34;L&#34; when u want to emphasize on
    &#34;P&#34; .. but a suggestion anyways... laters !

  body: 'I do not see why the logo needs in any way to &#34;enact&#34; a pulse. It
    says pulse already, to anyone who can read. Anyone who does not &#34;get&#34;
    pulse from the word &#34;pulse&#34; is missing something pretty basic. I suspect
    that most attempts to embody some sort of pulsing in the logo will either &#40;a&#41;
    be so obvious they look ghastly &#40;the heart monitor&#41; or &#40;b&#41; be
    so subtle they are irrelevant or &#40;c&#41; introduce unwarranted associations
    &#40;as I think the &#34;musical&#34; logos do&#41;. <BR> <BR>Nor can I see, with
    respect, why one has to get <i>design</i> from the logo. The logo will not be
    used in a vacuum, and presumably it will be obvious from what is around it that
    design is what it is about. <BR> <BR>It seems to me to be perfectly credible and
    indeed creditable that the logo, rather than saying <i>design</i> tells people
    who already know that they are dealing with a design company <i>what sort</i>
    of design they can expect: what its aesthetic tendency is. If the original logo
    does that, then I&#39;d stick with the original. <BR> <BR>The associations I&#39;d
    get from the original are: spare, clean &#40;super clean&#41;, perhaps a little
    bland, conservative &#40;in a modernist sense&#41;, understated, heavily typographical.
    This is the sort of design I&#39;d want for the annual report of a pharmaceutical
    company, not for a rock album cover. <BR> <BR>If those are the right associations,
    then the logo is working. If they&#39;re not then &#40;for me&#41; it&#39;s not.
    For instance, if you wanted to project playfulness, or political commitment, or
    a sense of being at the bleeding edge, the logo does not do that for me.'
