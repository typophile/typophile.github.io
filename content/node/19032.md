  probably don't need to explain this in this forum, but the form of the insignia
  is derived from the letters a, j & r. It is vaguely reminiscent of a keyhole or
  archway, although I don't expect most people to notice that. Both are appropriate
  to the business. Which is weakest? Which is strongest? TIY."

  body: "5 and 6 are weakest in my opinion, the icon looks like blood drops that probably
    are not what a house buyer is looking for in a house design.\r\nI like the icon
    shape in 2 and 3, but 3 (which I think the strongest) needs to have the relationship
    between icon and type sorted. I would also look at an alternative to the full
    stop, either have a space or possibly a rule dividing the words e.g. atelier|jr.
    On the uppercase A versions I think you need to tighten up the kerning on At.\r\nTim"

  body: "I think Tim brings up a good point - maybe experiment with a dividing device
    rather than a full stop. I had a look a few hours ago but didn't have time to
    post - I assumed on my first impression that this was web-based (.jr), having
    briefly skimmed the page. I'm afraid I can't really make head nor tail of the
    'arch' graphic; I think you're trying too hard with it. Because of the form of
    the graphic, I half-read it as a letterform because at the moment it's competing
    with the letterforms, and the shape it has gives the impression of a letterform
    - therefore at the moment: 1) looks a bit like ratelier.jr, 2) looks like satelier.jr,
    3) fatelier.jr and 4) patelier.jr\r\n\r\nSo, the big question is: how to resolve
    it so it 'works'?\r\nI like the name, the divider could be a colon instead of
    a full stop, so it would give some meaning to the divider - it would suggest that
    atelier comprises jr, which seems to work (atelier:jr).\r\n\r\nIf you really don't
    want to lose the arch, I'd divorce it from the type so it doesn't get in the way;
    making it a strong symbol which sits away from the type would be one route (maybe
    put it in a box); another route would be to lose the arch and concentrate on a
    wordmark logo. I like the face you've picked, it looks rigid and strong (charcterisitcs
    desirable in a house!) and I don't think it would look too plain - you could play
    around with the divider to stop it looking too plain. The unusual suffix of 'jr'
    to the word already gives it a distinctive feel. Just don't make it too 'website
    URL' looking!\r\n\r\nHope this helps!\r\n\r\nSi"

  body: "I agree with the first statements, particularly that at present I instantly
    associate this with a URL due to the .jr. The semi-colon or vertical bar are two
    interesting alternatives to explore, unfortunately I don\u2019t feel the icon
    works as a divider at present. \r\n\r\nI feel the icon's in #3, and #4 are the
    strongest. I personally like the hook on #4. I also feel that the icon needs to
    be moved away form the type and treated differently at this stage, because I also
    tried to read it as a letter at first glance. \r\n\r\nThere are kerning issues
    between AT and also JR. Overall, this is a robust feeling logo, with a bold colour
    palate which will no doubt insist on attention!\r\n\r\nBest.\r\n-nic"

  body: I suggest one use your mark separtely for your business name and as suggested
    change the color so it doesn't look like dripping blood. I would also look at
    making some of the edges of the mark sharper, more archetectural. Your business
    name can stand alone.

  body: "Okay,\r\nNobody here liked the versions where the mark divides the words.
    I can't help it. I still like it! Colour-wise, the red is just a placeholder.
    I envision changing it from time to time, but I will stay away from blood red.
    (At least until we achieve such a high level of recognition that such confusion
    is impossible.   ...I kid, I kid.)\r\n\r\nI did futz with the kerning and changed
    to pure magenta for the time being.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/atelier_9.gif]\r\n<br
    /><br />\r\n\r\nIf I could, I would definitely register atelier.jr, but alas,
    there's no such TLD\r\nThanks all!"

  body: "Position and colour of the mark aside, I'm afraid that your kerning is too
    tight, if you take the spaces around the e of ier (because it is a  round character
    surrounded by verticals and cannot go much tighter) as the base, then the spaces
    between other letters should reflect the amount of white space around the e rather
    than have an equal space measured on the two closest points of the letters. I
    think you should loosen the space between At, li, and jr and tighten el, these
    should be only slight adjustments.\r\nTim"
