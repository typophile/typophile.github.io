    Feldman</a>, but maybe someone beefed up the strokes, or else Mr Feldman has a
    better version of the font now, but you can see the shapes of the letters match.\r\n\r\n-

  body: Hmm.. It doesn't surprise me that Skatey,the original user of this font,would
    do that. She's all about perfection in her graphics,and seeing as how some of
    the letters are skinny,and some are not,she'd definitely have made the strokes
    more defined. Anyways,I found the font name. Thank you for your help.
