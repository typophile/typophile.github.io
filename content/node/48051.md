  past the typical look of 7-segment display systems. Example of typical 7 segment
  display attached:\r\n\r\nThis may be a case where the technology necessitates a
  very limited range of style, but I was hoping to find some example of this display
  format being pushed past it's familiar ubiquitous look. It seems the only variations
  out there are whether the whole character is vertical or oblique and the thickness
  of the stems.\r\n\r\nI have looked in the FSI Font Book, but even the similar typefaces
  there (LCD, Quartz) offer nothing new stylistcally and are not even consistent with
  the segment limitations. (meaning because they are designed to only mimic real segemeted
  displays.. they do not actually limit themselves to the same restriction for all
  characters)\r\n\r\nThis is for a project that is using an actual LCD segmented display
  so I can't do any cheating. Any insight, ideas, or links would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    rounded or meeting at different angles. That's pretty much the extent of the evolution
    I've seen.\r\n\r\nDoes it have to be limited to seven segments? A 14-segment display
    could show a larger range of stylistic variation, both in the segment design and
    in the glyphs:\r\n\r\nhttp://media.maxim-ic.com/images/appnotes/3975/3975Fig04.jpg\r\n"

    but I noticed that the new C4 car from citroen has a text caracters that seems
    to be an evolution about that (as you are looking for).\r\n[[http://www.citroen.co.uk/new-cars/citroen-c4-hatchback/media-gallery/picture-gallery/interior/|Here

  body: "Thanks to those who have responded. The citroen dash display is interesting
    but it uses more than 7 segments. I think the fact is that these characters look
    the way the do for a reason (inherent limitation of only using 7-segments). \r\n\r\nStill
    the examples provided give me some food for thought. \r\n"

    say that the project involves an actual seven segment display. Given that the
    segments are what they are, have you considered playing with the speed and sequence
    in which the various segments are lit up? You'd have to construct your own driver
    circuit instead of using an off-the-shelf BCD decoder/driver (that's easy to do)
    and interface it to some kind of sequencer -- your computer, for example. You
    might get some interesting visual artifacts."

  body: Doh. (Smacks self on head, brings inner geek to heel.) You were probably talking
    about laying out a seven segment font on paper or in something like FontLab, not
    powering up a physical display. Oh well, it was a nice gedanken experiment. Maybe
    I'll try it sometime.

    as mine from a post last year. I did a forum search before posting but somehow
    missed that one. There are some interesting concepts shown there utilizing a 6
    segment system, which add a whole lot of style but limit legibility in my opinion
    due to lack of familiarity.\r\n\r\nI have pretty much resigned myself to the established
    style but am enjoying the feedback nonetheless. "
