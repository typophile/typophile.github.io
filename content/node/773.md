  is a PDF of the design, with the title page and two facing pages - they need to
  be viewed facing to get the idea of how the design works.  <BR> <BR>I have picked
  up the dark red of the quote in the side heads. These are a size smaller, bold subhead
  weight - picking up on an idea of Bringhurst. I think it looks OK on screen; will
  it balance in print?  <BR> <BR>Suggestions on layout of the title page are also
  welcome. <BR> <BR>Thanks to you pros for indulging an amateur on this one.'

    little you have is nice. <BR> <BR>One thing I would think about however, is are
    you going to have red all throughout the book?  If you can keep it black you can
    cut down on printing costs. <BR> <BR>Little thing I noticed, kinda annoying, that
    &#34;g&#34; in &#34;sayings&#34;.  I&#39;d replace it with the &#34;g&#34; in
    &#34;sages&#34;.  It just looks kinda ugly to me. <BR> <BR>Otherwise, I like it.  I
    love how you&#39;re using fleurons in there as well.  You don&#39;t see them anymore,
    and it&#39;s nice to every so often.

  body: 'Thanks for your ideas. <BR> <BR>On the two g&#39;s in the title: I thought
    it somehow balanced better, but I guess it is distracting. I was also thinking
    about shortening the tail on the y for a better fit.  <BR> <BR>Spacing on title
    page: Thanks Hrant, I will take all of your suggestions. I was worried about the
    balance of the deliberate assymetry of the title vs the symmetrical page layout.
    Glad you like it.  <BR> <BR>Spacing of quote P2: I didn&#39;t proof it enough.
    There is an extra word space between &#39;is&#39; and &#39;admirable&#39; that
    I didn&#39;t catch. The Poetica is set 17/18. I will try to turn on the &#39;Optical
    Spacing&#39; in InDesign &#40;which this is set in&#41;, and see if this helps.    <BR>
    <BR>Spacing of Hebrew. On this page I didn&#39;t center it vertically properly
    - it is too close to the block text. I will fix this. But now I am thinking I
    should also reduce the leading on the Hebrew. I had it 14pt, like the text. I
    did the Hebrew very small, to be like a caption to the large English quote, so
    it wouldn&#39;t compete visually. <BR> <BR>Jacques, the text is set 11/14. Because
    Minion has a large x-height and is condensed, the current leading looked better
    to me than tighter. Any other views? <BR> <BR>The block quote with the fleuron
    is set in 10/13. I did the indent the same at the paragraph indent for uniformity
    - I will try indenting it more, but I&#39;m afraid it will be too much variation
    on a set of pages with a lot going on visually. <BR> <BR>David, the plan of the
    book is that, except for introduction and appendices, it is all sets of facing
    pages like the current p 2-3. The idea is that people sitting around a table can
    discuss the saying without flipping pages back and forth - everything is there.  <BR>
    <BR>The text blocks are aligned with the baseline grid, though the discussion
    guide blocks only have a half space &#40;7 points&#41; between them - which puts
    alternate blocks back on the grid. I thought the openness of the discussion guide
    bit bottom right somehow balanced the openness of the English &amp; Hebrew quotes
    top left.  <BR> <BR>On the red. David, you are the only one so far against the
    saying being in red. Why do you think it won&#39;t work? I am concerned that so
    much text in red might make it less readable, but on screen it seemes to me to
    work. I was inspired by some gorgeous books by &amp; about Jan van Krimpen. These
    were very classical in lay out, with plenty of use of a strong red, and they looked
    great. Because I am dealing with a classical text, I thought this suited the matter.  <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;ll post more in a few minutes. More comments welcome!         <BR> <BR> '

  body: 'I am concerned about the cost of the red, as it is not a forgone conclusion
    that the publisher will spring for the extra money. I do think it makes the look
    distinctive and adds a lot, providing it turns out readable and balanced in print.
    Also it helps in picking up the quote in the side heads. The text itself is very
    concisely written, and has a lot of information, so the less intimidating I can
    make the page the better. <BR> <BR>From previous experience, I know that many
    presses can print two colors in one pass, so that black and a spot color is much
    less expensive than four color process printing.  <BR> <BR>Is the red ink itself
    expensive? Or is this just a matter of how many signatures it appears in? <BR>The
    whole book will be less than 200 pages.  <BR> <BR>On the single quotes, I&#39;m
    American but did graduate school in England. The reason I went for the British
    convention on single quotes first is to save space and get a cleaner page. There
    are, because of the nature of the project, a lot of references, and I didn&#39;t
    want the page littered with double quotes.  <BR> <BR> <BR>On the layout of the
    quotes in Poetica. For three or at most four lines, I centered everything. For
    more lines I used different approaches, with almost every quote having a custom
    layout. I will post another example, if there is continuing discussion.  <BR>
    <BR>&#39;Fun with fleurons&#39;. Dwiggins I believe went wild with these, especially
    on title pages, and I&#39;ve always liked them. I tried to not overdo it. '

    I&#39;m on a real machine...&#42;wink&#42;...I can now see it just fine.  <BR>
    <BR>The red is very beautiful. I personal think you could go a bit more red &#40;less
    black&#41;. On the title page, while I appreciate having the word &#39;heart&#39;
    in red, I think it seems a little distracting. Maybe the title is all black and
    the subtitle is red &#40;would you say the subtitle is almost more important?&#41;,
    and then the sub-subtitle is red also. so the pacing would be black-red-black-red-black?
    I would stick with one &#39;g&#39; as well. The line spacing &#40;or lack there
    of&#41; in title, the way you have it grouped, could you achieve this with the
    subtitle as well? <BR> <BR>Cost. Plan your sigs, and then you can have a touch
    of color in some places. If they have to run your book on a bigger press, color
    shouldn&#39;t double the price, but it will add to it. <BR> <BR>It might not be
    appropriate, and I don&#39;t know about it, but what if the Hebrew were in red
    and not the english. Speaking of your second page shown? and if you do have more
    color maybe your contintue with the mini-sections in the chapter and your dingbats?

  body: 'Tiffany, thanks, I will try your suggestions and variations on them. Because
    most readers of the book will have little Hebrew, I don&#39;t want to emphasize
    it, with red or size. As it is, it is a reference for those who can understand
    some of it. <BR> <BR>Because 80% of the book will be like these facing pages,
    there is no way I can confine the red to just one or two signatures. I will just
    have to hope the publisher will spring for it, or do all black.  <BR> <BR>One
    concern I have is that offset might not have the density of ink as letter press,
    and might make the red look weak. The great examples of van Krimpen that I saw
    I think were done on a letter press. Is this a concern, or does offset make no
    difference on this?    <BR> <BR>Hrant, blackletter I think has Christian or German
    connotations to American Jews, neither of which is appropriate to this project.It
    is interesting the Goudy, the most American of type designers, thought blackletter
    is the most beautiful form.  <BR> <BR>Also I really like Poetica. Of all Bringhurst&#39;s

  body: 'David, as I know a lot more about philosophy than design, I would rather
    have your design analysis - such as why you think the red is not good - than your
    philosophy.   <BR> <BR>Philosophically, your segregation of art and design is
    simplistic, and doesn&#39;t hold up to examination. By beautifying an object -
    a religious object or sacred quotation - you convey the message that it is a treasure.
    This is a traditional concept in Judaism - called hidur ha-mitzvot - as well as
    in other religions. Illuminated manuscripts are part of that tradition. In the
    case of this design, beautification of the sacred texts suits the design purpose.
    Both Poetica and the red help the design if they succeed in beautifying, even
    at the cost of making you read the quotation more slowly and repeatedly. Beauty
    gives the message, &#39;Turn it and turn it, because all is in it&#39; - the last
    saying in Pirkei Avot.  '

    color is much less expensive than four color process printing.  <BR>Is the red
    ink itself expensive? <BR> <BR>From my limited experience on presses, this is
    also a function of the size of the run. Because &#40;depending on the press/printer&#41;
    you&#39;ll have to pay for a &#34;change-over&#34; to ink your spot red on the
    magenta head. For smaller runs this can sometimes add to the cost and hassle.  <BR>
    <BR>Typically, red ink is more expensive than black. &#40;A quick search for Van
    Son Oil Base shows Pantone mixing reds to be about twice as much as black.&#41;
    There&#39;s that, and there&#39;s also the mixing fee - some presses charge quite
    a bit just to mix the spot color you want.  <BR> <BR>But I really do like the
    red &#40;it&#39;s not my money after all ;-&#41; And I agree with Hrant about
    that block quote &#40;p.3&#41; with the fleuron needing to be indented more. And
    with M. Le Bailly about the word spacing being too large in spots. Right off hand,

    I have thought a lot about my audience and I as a designer certainly know the
    wishes of one of my clients, namely the writer, who is also me. Your new series
    of excellent questions also presumes that I have not thought about them. I do
    find your presumption of my thoughtlessness annoying. Generalized questions are
    of not much help to me; the specific suggestions of other posters have been very
    helpful, and I appreciate them and will try them out.  <BR> <BR>There will be
    a second phase of this design, when I again discuss with the publisher - whom
    I have consulted and who has already specified the general size - the final specifications.
    The more I know going in, the better case I can make for what I want - the red,
    sewn signatures, good quality uncoated paper, quality soft binding.  <BR> <BR>I
    am looking here for ideas to improve the design, and to acquire more knowledge
    to make my case. The key here to justifying a classic and &#39;quality&#39; look
    is that Pirkei Avot is a classic with numerous editions and commentaries.Design
    is important in re-issuing a classic, even if it has a lot of new material. I&#39;d
    like to think that my commentary and guide will make it stand out, but I also
    want the design to make it stand out, so that the quality message of the design
    will visibly promise the same for the contents. Then the &#40;I hope small&#41;
    additional production costs will pay off in more sales for the publisher.  <BR>
    <BR>&#62;the first paragraph under &#34;Discussion Guide&#34; &#40;p.3&#41; seems
    alternately too loose, then too cramped. <BR> <BR>Thanks to Jacques and Nathan
    for pointing this out. I must admit I didn&#39;t catch it. I specified the h &amp;
    j parameters in InDesign following an example in Felici&#39;s book &#39;The Complete
    Manual of Typography&#39;. His example was also in Minion, but in a narrower column.
    I will try different settings and see what happens. Will I have to also get in
    there and adjust paragraphs by hand? <BR> <BR>  <BR>'

  body: I&#39;ve found that InDesign cuts down on a <i>lot</i> of hand tweaking -
    though not necessarily all of it. Are you using Glyph Scaling in H&amp;Js? In
    theory I hate it - but if you set it at 98/100/102, it works wonders. You might
    also tweak the &#34;hyphenation vs. spacing&#34; slider. Generally, setting it
    on the second or third hash makes for pretty decent spacing results - although
    at the expense of more hyphens obviously. Hope this helps. <BR> <BR>Cheers.

    of the publisher, and worked for a long time on the design with the audience in
    mind. When I submit the current design there will be a final round of decisions
    on binding, paper, etc. I may well have to change some features of the design.
    And I will shortly be sending the printer a sample for comments. Because I am
    the author as well as designer, the normal relationship of publisher and designer
    doesn&#39;t apply here.   <BR> <BR>The design I posted was as good an answer as
    I have to what I know of the publisher&#39;s wishes, and I know there will be

    is a revised version encorporating some of the ideas.  <BR> <BR>TITLE PAGE:  <BR>To
    follow Hrant&#39;s suggestion to make &#39;of the&#39; bolder in the title, I
    used Minion semi-bold with the larger Poetica. The letter forms are very similar,
    though Poetica is narrower with a smaller x-height. I think it is an improvement,
    but I&#39;m still not sure if there is a better solution. &#40;The best solution
    would be to get Bringhurst to do the title in his calligraphy!&#41; <BR> <BR>In
    response to Tiffany&#39;s suggestions on the use of red, I took away the reddened
    &#39;heart&#39; which I concluded is annoying. Reddening the subtitle made it
    compete with the title too much. I tried Tiffany&#39;s idea of adding more red
    for balance by reddening the fleuron. Do you think it works? <BR> <BR>I tried
    to kern the small caps at the bottom, but I&#39;m not sure if I did a very good
    job. I started with everything tracked at 50 wider, and adjusted from there. Is
    there a better way to approach kerning caps? <BR> <BR>FACING PAGES: <BR>1. This
    time I tried the InDesign &#39;optical&#39; option on automatically kerning the
    quotation in Poetica, rather than using the &#39;metric&#39; option, as in the
    earlier post. I think it is better; any views/experience from others?  <BR> <BR>2.
    As I wrote above, using the hyphenation slider as Nathan suggested was a great
    help in fixing the bad spacing pointed out by Jacques. &#40;I also found and eliminated
    some double spaces left behind from revisions.&#41; On my new pages 4 and 5 you
    can compare the effects of the slider at 2 &#40;page 4&#41; and at 3 &#40;page
    5, as well as 2 &amp; 3&#41;. I think maybe 2 is better in spite of the extra
    hyphens.   <BR> <BR>3. The formatting of the block quotes needed fixing. I have
    tried several options. Somehow, in trying hundreds of variations on the basic
    design of the facing pages, I neglected working on the block quotes. I am grateful
    to Hrant for catching it. <BR> <BR>I concluded first of all that after the block
    quote I should probably start the new paragraph flush left. I think this was one
    of the problems. The option of a further indent is on p. 5. The option of cutting
    the fleuron is on p. 4.  <BR> <BR>My reasoning behind my currently prefered solution,
    p. 3 this. The option of the further indent, suggested by Hrant and on p. 5 is
    best for contrast with the adjacent paragraphs. But in the overall scheme of the
    facing pages it cuts up the page too much. Already the quotes top left and discussion
    guide lower right break the grid. So to minimize the break with the grid, on p.
    3 I have formatted the block quote 10/14 with no space before and after, and no
    right indent. There are many other options, but at the moment this is the best
    I could come up with. What do you think? <BR> <BR>4. Use of Red. An important
    feature of the design problem which is not on this set of facing pages is that
    there are 76 other sets of facing pages, with varying lengths of quotations and
    discussion guides. On this page, there is no red on the right, which would be
    good for balance. In some others the side heads do appear on the right. I also
    did try red fleurons, but it gave the pages measles. In the end I decided that
    on the facing pages I would only use the red for the main quotation, and the pick
    up lines of the same quotation in the side heads. Even though it is a bit unbalanced
    on one set of facing pages, the whole book repeats the pattern, and it provides
    a strong marker as guide for the reader. <BR> <BR>To David, sorry for overreacting
    to what seemed to me high handed remarks. Frankly, I think maybe both of us were
    suffering from what, following Hrant, we might call &#39;ASCII-itis&#39;. <BR>
    <BR>Here are answers to some of your earlier questions. As far as the binding,
    most of the publisher&#39;s books do, as is typical, have bindings that eat 1/4&#34;
    from the inner margin of both pages. My layout reflects this. If the publisher&#39;s
    final decision is different, I will change it. <BR> <BR>My page block is a pica
    narrower and longer than 6&#34; x 9&#34;. &#40;=35 x 55 picas&#41;. The text block
    is little taller than Golden proportions. I am following Bringhurst in the idea
    that generally the narrower rather than wider proportions give a more classical
    look, which I what I am trying for here. The deeper text block I think still balances
    up because of the open space at the top left and bottom right of the facing pages.  <BR>
    <BR>As to the question of whether this is a text book or monograph or what, I
    thought a long time about that and decided that it was a guide book -a kind of
    sui generus as a classic text with commentary and discussion guide. The design
    has the red as resonance with illuminated text, and the textbook element of discussion
    guide  <BR>also.  <BR> <BR>There are many editions in Engligh of Avot with commentaries.
    The designs vary from ok to awful. You can compare them to this to have a very
    good idea of the design challenge.  <BR> <BR>As to why van Krimpen used red. The
    book I saw was a showcase for his Romulus. As it has a classical beauty, he was
    also showing classical design -very much his taste - in the book, and making the
    most of the traditionally available and classical look black, red and ivory paper.
    Dreyfus&#39;s book on van Krimpen does the same.           <BR> <BR>'

    hardly see it used&#41; suits the english, its pretty anemic and unlike the english
    style-wise. Is that intentional? you said that becuase many readers dont know
    hebrew, you dont want to over-emphasize the hebrew qoutes. Even so, maybe a diffrent
    font will look better. Perheps one with less contrast, because this font makes
    the text look funny. I&#39;d suggest Narkisim, it would look fantastic with Minion
    Italic. Another option is Rolit, which is very calligraphic, and will look nice
    &amp; gentle on the modern Minion. Im thinking of a font by Yaredna, but i cant
    remember its name, that would look good too. I can check it out if youre interested.

    <BR> <BR>As to the Hebrew typeface, I have never been satisfied with it, and was
    settling for just being discrete.  <BR> <BR>My problem is that I am using the
    English/Hebrew program Davkawriter, which has its own coding system and limited
    typeface options. The face you see is Guttman Hadar. Earlier I used Davka&#39;s
    David, which looks more modern, but was a bit bold relative to the Minion.  <BR>
    <BR>I would be delighted to get something better, if I can get it into InDesign.
    In an earlier conversation on using Hebrew fonts, John Hudson recommended using
    InDesign ME, which I guess will use all the fonts you use in Israel. He said that
    regular InDesign will not do right-to-left text and nekudot. Davkawriter does
    have a functionality of pasting Hebrew into English programs, switching the direction
    and placing nekudot correctly. That is what I am using currently.  <BR> <BR>I
    don&#39;t know whether Dagesh, the other English/Hebrew program used widely here
    can use the regular Hebrew fonts. If there is another Hebrew font that will work
    a lot better, I will also check on the cost of upgrade to InDesign ME, now that
    I have InDesign anyway.  <BR> <BR>In any case, if you can give me URLs to look

    <BR>&#62;the InDesign &#39;optical&#39; option ... any views/experience from others?  <BR>
    <BR>On the occassions I&#39;ve used InDesign&#39;s optical spacing, I&#39;ve found

    What is your experience with it. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m a sucker for optical margin
    alignment. My feeling is that, whenever I&#39;m in a situation where I have a
    lot of hyphens &#40;to optimize my spacing&#41; and punctuation &#40;it seems
    that the nature of this text is to have quotation marks&#41;, I use optical alignment.
    I find the dimples less disturbing than the divots. You can also optimize for
    a smaller type size to overhang less.  <BR> <BR>I lent my Bringhurst &#40;stupid!
    stupid!&#41;, but looking at Felici I think the sidebars may have had some influence
    on not using optical alignment. IIRC, Bringhurst utilizes the sidebar quite a
    bit as well. Perhaps overhanging would&#39;ve made the gutter too raggedy. <BR>
    <BR>Two other things: &#40;1&#41; I think that I like the block quote on page

    vowels &#40;used only exceptionally, but I need them for my text&#41; are I believe
    the reason that old Windows couldn&#39;t handle Hebrew natively. The new Windows
    I believe allows more &#39;bits&#39; per character.  <BR> <BR>The Word and Wordpad
    capabilities I don&#39;t believe help with InDesign, though. My understanding
    now is that to get Hebrew into it the only option is the pasting from the special
    programs, or InDesign-ME.

    <BR> <BR>There was a thing on the Adobe Typography forums and they concluded too
    that without being able to convert the text from right to left that you would
    need the ME version of InDesign to use it...which sucks.  I mean, if they go through
    the trouble to make InDesign Unicode compatible, it shouldn&#39;t be too hard
    to add other language features.

    <BR>AFAIK, the fact that Notepad supports RTL text and Hebrew &#40;and other non-Latin
    scripts&#41; has to do with the Uniscribe DLL. Despite the fact that Uniscribe
    is in 2000 and XP, not every app can use it. I&#39;m sure John Hudson, Hrant,
    et al are more informed than I... <BR> <BR>&#62;And did you know, that Arial,

    <BR>I don&#39;t know about TNR and CS, but MS Arial Unicode is around 25MB - it
    has glyphs for most codepoints in the Unicode spec. I believe Tahoma is also like
    this. In a way it&#39;s not all that surprising since Microsoft&#39;s OpenType

    niceties. <BR> <BR>Although I have a feeling &#40;I haven&#39;t looked at all

    <BR> <BR>Here are the changes: <BR> <BR>Title page: I used the semibold italic
    subhead weight of Minion for &#39;of the&#39; in the title. This seems to balance
    the best of the options. <BR> <BR>I reduced the size of the title and took away
    the bold on the author info; these looked too bold when I printed them out.  <BR>
    <BR>I tried using the optical spacing and then tracking 50 the small caps at the
    bottom. Then I just changed the tracking on a couple of them. Do they look even
    now? <BR> <BR>p 2. <BR>As a test I changed the Hebrew font to David. I like it
    better as a font and it is, as Itay says, more readable as Hebrew. But it is a
    little bold to my eye in relation to the Minion. I might try to see if I can get
    a bargain on InDesign ME, and try other fonts. Short of that, I am inclined to
    stick with the old font &#40;Hadar&#41; for balance. What do you all think as
    far a balance? <BR> <BR>I saw somewhere in looking at Hebrew fonts on an Israeli
    site one called Poeta. Ok, a little too obvious as a match to Poetica, but it
    did actually seem to harmonize with Poetica. Do you know what I am refering to
    Itay? <BR> <BR>I put the thin space around the dashes on p. 2. Is this better
    than word spaces? Bringhurst recommends word spaces - I guess to avoid confusion
    with a hyphen - but I like Nathan&#39;s suggestion to use thin spaces instead.
    What do you all think? <BR> <BR>p. 3. The 10/14 block quote in the last post looked
    a little bare to me, so I tightened it to 10/13 &#40;vs the 11/14 of the main
    text&#41;, and added an extra 2 points top and bottom. This puts the next paragraph
    on the baseline grid. Both Bringhurst and Felici recommend at least a half space
    above and below block quotes, but to me this flows better, as I have so much other
    stuff that breaks the grid.  <BR>   <BR>Thanks again to all for the help. <BR>'

    put the hypenation slider at 3, rather than two, as I thought the spacing is still
    ok, and there are significantly fewer broken words. <BR> <BR>Following Nathan&#39;s
    suggestion, I also did the &#39;optical&#39; margins, which hang the punctuation
    out in the margin. This makes less of a difference to my eyes than I thought it
    would. What do you all think? <BR> <BR>&#62;I really like that new hebrew font.
    It&#39;s more contrasty than the others. Sets it apart from the Poetica and Minion
    more I think.  <BR> <BR>I think David is a better font in itself, but the being
    more set apart from Poetica and Minion is what I don&#39;t like.  <BR> <BR>Here
    is my reasoning, which may be wrong. According to the chief designer at a web
    firm my son worked at, you shouldn&#39;t have more than three basic elements on
    a screen &#40;= set of facing pages here&#41;. Otherwise the reader gets confused.
    My three elements are:  <BR>1. the quote in large size Poetica,  <BR>2. the commentary
    in Minion, and  <BR>3. the discussion guide in Minion &amp; Minion italic, with
    1/2 line leading between items. <BR> <BR>To make the Hebrew not a competing item,
    but clearly subordinate, I set it small as a kind of caption to the large quote
    in red, and tried to have it harmonize with the text below.  <BR> <BR>About setting
    the Hebrew centered: I didn&#39;t do this because many of the quotes have many
    lines, both English and Hebrew, and these are not centered in the English, but
    treated differently.  <BR> <BR>Now that I think of it, I could center the last
    Hebrew line of the short quotes, which have the English centered. I will work
    on this and post a sample of the two different models.  <BR> <BR>As Itay understands
    the Hebrew &#40;as do I&#41;, I would be interested in his design views on the
    font and alignment. Note that I also start the next line with small caps, partly
    to balance the white space at the left of the last Hebrew line. <BR>'

  body: Web design and print design are very different things.  In web design, if
    you want more than the basic fonts that everyone has on their computers, you have
    to make them into bitmaps; so a lot of people don&#39;t do it, which leaves you
    with like one serif font and a handful of sans serif fonts to play with. <BR>
    <BR>In print, however, it&#39;s generally not a good idea to mix two serif or
    two sans serif fonts together unless they really contrast with each other.  Since
    you&#39;re using the Poetica and the hebrew in conjunction with each other, you&#39;ll
    want to keep them visually separate, which I think this new font, David?, does
    quite well.  It&#39;s less calligraphic than the other you used, and makes a nice
    companion for the Poetica. <BR> <BR>If you&#39;re worried about it interfering
    with the Minion, try bringing the margins for the quotes in more than the margins
    for the body text, also give the body text more space after the quotes, maybe
    add a line or something to separate them from each other as well. <BR> <BR>David
    and Poetica really work well together.  And I think that maybe it would be worth
    even finding a new font for the body text to keep the combination. <BR> <BR>---
    <BR> <BR>As far as centring the hebrew quotes goes, could you post a page with
    a larger quote in hebrew? <BR> <BR>Maybe it&#39;s just because it&#39;s a short
    quote that&#39;s throwing me off.

    <BR> <BR>I agree with you that the screen is a radically diffrent medium for typography.
    I just thought that the &#39;rule of three&#39; seemed to apply to print also,
    as it is more about the psychology of information design than typography.  <BR>
    <BR>That is why I am keen to keep the Hebrew clearly as a subordinate &#39;reference&#39;
    rather than a headline. The lighter Hadar typeface and the normal &#40;right&#41;
    alignment of the last line seems to do that. <BR> <BR>If Itay &#40;or David H.&#41;
    check in, I&#39;d be curious about their views, as they read Hebrew. Hrant, does
    the title page, revised trying to follow your suggestions, work for you now?  <BR>
    <BR>Nathan, does the optical margins work for you? Actually, it has really grown
    on me. The punction hanging in the margin is not so noticable, and it seems to
    help even out the text.  <BR> <BR>Thanks again to all. I think the design has
    a polish now that it didn&#39;t before!   '

    flush left? <BR> <BR>Also, visually, I&#39;m still liking David as a better compliment
    for the Poetica.  You have three &#34;serifed&#34; fonts working together and
    it sort of becomes very blended. <BR> <BR>Also, what I said earlier about adding
    more space between the quotes and the body text...I think, especially if you&#39;re
    going to have long quotes like the new one that you definitely need to do that.  The
    new quote has some nice space separating it from the body text, but I think it
    needs a little more. <BR> <BR>One thing that I&#39;m thinking too, now that I
    see the new large quote...I&#39;m wondering what it would look like if you made
    the text smaller, like the size of the body text maybe even smaller, and then
    putting it in a text box that&#39;s only a couple inches wide.  Long quotes like
    that are kind of awkward, especially if you have ones that are even longer.  If
    they&#39;re always at the top of the page, they can be a kind of embellishment
    at the smaller size that isn&#39;t as over powering as they would be at the larger
    size.

    <BR> <BR>All have the Hebrew in Hadar a point size larger than before, and have
    more space around the Hebrew, as recommended by David and Chris respectively.  <BR>
    <BR>Because my English quote has to start at the top of the page consistently,
    and the English text stay on the grid, the vertical space around the Hebrew quote
    was my &#39;fudge factor&#39;. But I realize from Chris&#39; critique that I can&#39;t
    really push it too tight and look OK. I hope it looks better now. <BR> <BR>Page
    2 has centered English, Right aligned Hebrew.  <BR>Page 3 has centered English,
    centered Hebrew.  <BR>Page 4 has left aligned English, centered on the longest
    line &#40;recommended by Bringhurst for poetry&#41;, and right aligned Hebrew.  <BR>
    <BR>I am starting to think that page 4, which follows the layout I already have
    for the long quotes, would be best. It would unite the style of the whole book
    more also. I do shift the middle line slightly to the right, so the swash capitals
    visually align. I have to do this kind of adjustment basically in all the quotes.
    <BR> <BR>What do you think, should I go with p. 4 as the model? <BR> <BR>As to
    the Hebrew, the basic problem is that I am stuck for the moment with the Davka
    faces &#40;which are not bad, but limited&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Chris, to respond to
    an earlier question of yours, I can&#39;t really change the Minion, because no
    other italic really goes with Poetica. I end up with two italics on the same set
    of pages, which looked bad when I tried it. On the Hebrew, as I explained I don&#39;t
    really have a lot of flexibility to go with Israeli fonts at the moment because
    of the cost of InDesign ME.  <BR> <BR>&#40;Incidentally, although I like the award-winning
    Falafil at Avantype, I really don&#39;t like the &#39;Casablanca.&#39; My eye
    may be misleading me on this, but it looks to me like it is trying to imitate
    some other script than Hebrew, like &#39;chop suey&#39; fonts in English.&#41;     <BR>   '

    Not a smaller size like I said. Overhanging 10 point type optimized for 30 points

    <BR>To me it is too calligraphic, or as Nathan put it &#39;mannered&#39;, in text
    size. At the small size I find Minion a lot more readable. At a larger size and
    the right project it would be wonderful. <BR> <BR>On the size of the Poetica,
    when it is significantly smaller it doesn&#39;t have the lusciousness of the large
    size in red, which I like the look of. The longer quotes don&#39;t look so good,
    but I think making the long quotes smaller size and leaving the short ones big
    will look odd. And making the short ones small too will detract from the beauty
    of the book. So the all large size seems to me the best compromise.    <BR> <BR>I
    don&#39;t really have a problem with the Poetica/Minion combination, which I think
    is very strong. On fonts, my only problem is with the Hebrew, which I haven&#39;t
    found a solution for that I am really happy with. <BR> <BR>Aside from the Hebrew
    font question, I feel like all the other issues are now resolved: Title page,
    alignment of the shorter quotes, size and vertical alignment of the Hebrew, format
    of block quotes, and optimal setting of the text using InDesign. Thanks again
    to all! You&#39;ve helped an amateur typophile bring this design up to a professional

  body: On the nikud, Hrant has it right. The vowelling is basically for learners.
    Hebrew is normally written without vowels. In Israel the nikud are basically only
    used for dictionaries and beginning readers. Also having nikud are the prayer
    book and editions of Torah for study &#40;not the actual Torah scroll, which is
    calligraphy without nikud&#41;. This is so Jews who don&#39;t know Hebrew well
    can phonetically read the prayers and Torah - even without understanding.   <BR>
    <BR>There will be a great variation in the Hebrew of my readers. If there is an
    English speaking Jewish discussion group, the group leader may understand the
    text fully or partially, and others less to varying degrees. Most are likely to
    be helped by the nikud, so nikud is &#40;are?&#41; really essential. Christian
    readers will not generally be able to read the Hebrew at all, though a few clergy
    do have some Hebrew and probably will be helped by nikud. I do hope, perhaps unrealistically,
    there will be many Christian readers, as the immediate basis of Jesus&#39; ethics
    was the ethics of Hillel in Pirkei Avot, and not the &#34;Old Testament.&#34;
    <BR> <BR>As for doing nikud &#39;lightly&#39;, just to remove ambiguities, this
    only works for those who really know Hebrew well - Israelis like Itay and David.
    For those of us who are bumbling and stumbling in Hebrew, we need all the help
    we can get.  <BR> <BR>Incidentally, text of Pirkei Avot was traditionally printed
    in full in the Prayer Book, with nikud. Thus, lucky for me, you can get the text
    vowelled on CD ROMs. Putting in nikud is a nightmare.  <BR> <BR>&#62;I wish everything
    would have built-in right to left support allready. This issue is a constant pain
