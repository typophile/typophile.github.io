body: "I've been reading and searching a lot on how to optimize the inner- and counter
  forms in a font for legibility. I found some material, but this is mostly an explaination
  of the matter and not an explaination of <strong>h\xF3w it works</strong>. \r\nWhat
  I would like to know are the 'does-and-dont's', the 'never-worked-for-me's', the
  'my-tip-is-better' and the 'look-at-this'.\r\nI do what I can and feel that optimizing
  the inner closed forms for itself helps a great deal in the balance of the font.
  But I never corrected my curves for enhancing legibility. So it's hard for me to
  judge from my own fonts if the are display or text fonts. Perhaps most of them are
  a bit of both.\r\nI'm currently working on my newest font called 'Reethi Rah' and
  this should be a text font. I would like to start in the right way with my proportions
  and not correct this when it's almost ready. \r\n\r\nIs there anyone that optimizes
  his fonts this way and could shed some light on the practical details? \r\n\r\nThanx,\r\n\xAEen\xE9"

  body: "Rene,\r\nThat is a tough one to quantify into a procedure.  There are differing
    opinions on what constitutes legibility and different solutions. I don't think
    in the end that there is a recipe agreed upon. It is hard work trying then testing
    then changing then testing again. The size also matters. A type ballanced for
    10pt has different needs than one ballanced for 14pt.  My not-very-helpful suggestion
    is that you just have to fight with it long enough to train yourself to see differences
    and tinker to make it work.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: There are also numerous threads on typophile that get into this question.
    I suggest you search for them; read them. After that you may have a more specific
    question or questions that you want to ask. Right now your question is pretty
    broad. It's hard to know where to start. What Chris was getting at - that the
    conetxt of use is crucial to defining what to do is bang on. You might want to
    decide a bit more about how you think the face would be used & at what size and
    actually try it out in that way - before you start adjusting.

  body: 'One tidbit: Look at Gill Sans Extra Bold, and Gill Sans Display Extra Bold.
    Note the awkwardness of the counters of the "text" version, when enlarged. The
    huge variation of stroke weights in Gill Extra bold are there to provide adequate
    legibility at small sizes. That''s something you don''t do in a display face.
    Look at other robust text faces (Serif too), for more things like this. This is
    just an extreme example of optical compensation for legibility. '

  body: I think his question is a little more specific, and I'd be curious to hear
    new thoughts. But, you are right, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&client=safari&rls=en&q=legibility+research+site%3Atypophile.com&btnG=Search">there
    are several threads that probably touch on this topic.</a>
