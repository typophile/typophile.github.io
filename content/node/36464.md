body: "Hello everyone, \r\n\r\nI\u2019m brand new to the forum but in need of some
  help! (I posted this in the design section but was kindly referred here)\r\n\r\nI
  designed my own business card while I was still at university, and was pleased with
  it at the time, but it is beginning to show it\u2019s age!\r\n\r\nThe card consisted
  of a rendered 3d letter \u201Ce\u201D with a black background. On the right side
  of the card, I wrote my name and details in white with Magneto for my font. Have
  a look below. It\u2019s just not doing it for me. I am a video editor/3d animator
  living in London. I want to convey a modern, smooth image, without being too \u201Cout-there\u201D
  for the average person that I might give my card to. I am still generally happy
  with this background image, but I welcome any and all advice in regards to colours,
  layout, font (ESPECIALLY font), etc.\r\n\r\nI humbly thank you in advance for taking
  the time to help me!\r\n\r\n~Erven\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BusCard_help_4232.jpg]"

    small sizes.\r\n\r\nBecause you do 3D animation, I think that the 3D render on
    the card might be a good idea, especially if you're going with a CMYK card. If
    you're keeping it, you might want to keep at least your name set in Magneto. I
    don't know if the vector version is necessary, and I might put the dots above
    and below the 'E' in \"Erven\" instead.\r\n\r\nPlay around with it and post your
    progress.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    3d image AND very interesting typeface). \r\n\r\nThe coloured 3d logo is a strong
    image, therefore you should leave ample space around it, and set the text in a
    neutral typeface. (Could be Linotype Univers, Bliss, or something just as simple.\r\n\r\nTry
    to make a vertical as well as a horizontal version - and post it ... (a little
    larger, please)."

  body: "I like chuckgroth's horizontal, cropped version. Cropping was an improvement.\r\n\r\nIf
    I should take it from there, i would try:\r\n\r\n01\r\nScale down the 3d image
    approx 15%, so that (a) the uppermost edge of the 3d image not reaches the top
    edge of the card, and (b)the southwest corner of the card just shows a tiny bit
    of background (ie: you should be able to see the roundness of the 3d image down
    in this corner)\r\n\r\n02\r\nWrite all the text in the same size, which should
    be fairly small (ie the size of the email address or a bit larger)\r\n\r\n03\r\nLose
    the idea of having flush right type 'mirror' the right edge of 3d image ... make
    it flush left instead, and use the 15-odd % scaling of the image and the downsizing
    of the type to get ample space between the two elements\r\n\r\n04\r\nWrite all
    the text without emphasizing with small caps or blank lines ... you only got three
    lines - no need to diffenrentiate anything, people can easily navigate through
    the information ... and the more minimalistic the type, the more exclusive it
    gets. (And the more 'boring' the type, the more interesting the 3d image. This
    is my main point: let the image steal the scene!\r\n\r\n05\r\nJust to pursue this
    line of thought, you COULD try to change the colour of the type to light grey
    ... 15-20 % black or something\r\n\r\n06\r\nNo matter if the type is grey or white
    - if you scale it down like I suggested, remember to give a few units of space
    between all letters\r\n\r\n07\r\nIn the same line of thought: you COULD try to
    write everything with lowercase ...\r\n\r\n08\r\nBTW - how is the card going to
    be produced? Colour printer? Or offset printing ... this may influence some of
    the choices you make ... eg the colouring of the type\r\n\r\n09\r\nYes, I guess
    I am a minimalist ... ;.)\r\n\r\n"

    the back side blank on a business card - so i would try to put all the type on
    the front (making the univers condensed was a right move imho) and then scale
    it down a little bit more if necessary. see how it looks. if it looks bad, then
    put it on the back side, but then i would certainly not place it right in the
    middle, rather i would place it nearer to the bottom edge - and definitely in
    a smaller point size.\r\n\r\nif you place all the text on the front side, ie four
    lines, then you could try emphasizing the first line, your nane, by writing it
    in univers condensed bold (and the three remaining lines in univers condensed
    regular)"

  body: much better. I might suggest reducing the leading between your name and and

    you suffer somewhat from 'horror vacui' - i mean you let the type get almost as
    big as it can, and you go right up to top edge and right down to the bottom as
    well ... it's as if you want to stretch whatever there is on a page, so that it
    can fill it completely ...\r\nhow about scaling down the type to, say, 80-85 percent
    ... and then placing it 5 mm from right edge and 5 mm from bottom edge - without
    the blank lines.\r\n\r\n02\r\nwhat happened to @ in your e-mail adress ... couldn't
    you condense that, too?\r\n\r\n03\r\ni don't think the telephone symbol goes well
    with univers - couldn't you just write 'P'?\r\n(actually, you don't need anything
    ... just as you don't need a symbol or a letter for the e-mail address or the
    web)\r\n\r\n04\r\non the front side: i would like the type to be scaled down here

    close to the logo)"
