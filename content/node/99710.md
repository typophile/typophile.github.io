  with ID of the typefaces used here? Especially the \"Zandar\" bit. It looks at least
  altered or possibly custom? \r\n\r\nA link to where I can buy it would be awesome. "

  body: '<em>Instruction Manual</em> looks like Kaufman Script. <em>ZANDAR</em> might
    be Friz Quadrata with the crossbar on the <strong>A</strong> manually extended
    on the left, and the whole word outlined, shadowed, and warped on an arc. '

  body: "Thanks Mojo,\r\n\r\n Friz Quadrata seems close though the verticals are straight
    on it, these have a \"pucker\" effect leading into their serifs which I really
    like. If you know any other fonts that do that I'd love to know! \r\n\r\nThanks
    again,\r\n-Travis"
