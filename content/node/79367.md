body: Why is it not feasible to use shadows in corporate wordmark logos? Please give
  me some solid arguments over this. This is for a very no-nonsense, not funky corporate
  company.

    was over saturated with bad logo with shadow. Especially back in the 90's when
    amateurs just add drop shadow over an image and call it a logo. So if you can
    pull it off without looking like crap go right ahead.\r\n\r\nthe wonderful Nick

  body: '@jwchen Thanks. I dont think it works at all for this Logo. But since the
    client seems to feel it looks good, dont want it to come off as if it is only
    a matter of personal taste. The logo is such that I can invert it to white on
    a dark background and Black on light one. So does not really make sense to have
    a shadow.'

  body: "My approach would be to ask what the shadow adds. In logo design especially,
    every element needs to convey something about the company and its values. Does
    a shadow really speak to the company's customers? Why does the client want a shadow?
    \r\n\r\nAll too often shadows are put in only to say 'look we can add text effects!',
    which is far too amateur and self-conscious for a corporate logo. Of course there
    are times when a shadow is relevant, but unless depth, light/shadow and/or 3-d
    are important parts of what a company does, I would suggest it's purposeless."

  body: "You don't see drop shadows all that often in professional corporate logos,
    but they are used occasionally. Google's logo is one example (although they tend
    towards a more freewheeling style anyway).  \r\n\r\nA shadow, like any graphic
    technique, can be either appropriate or inappropriate depending on the situation.
    It can be a reference to the client's business, and it can also be used just to
    make the logo pop off the background and give it a bit more zip. \r\n\r\nOne reason
    pros tend to stay away from shadows on logos is that they don't reproduce well
    in certain situations, like on a Xerox or fax, and if the logo is reversed out
    the shadow becomes white and looks weird. So even if your client insists on a
    shadow you'll probably want to prepare an alternate non-shadow version for situations
    like that.\r\n"

  body: "Your client may also be telling you that they think your design lacks pizzaz,
    and needs sexing up.\r\nBut that may well be their subjective insecurity speaking\u2014they
    want the logo to be spectacularly awesome, immediately, all by itself.\r\nWe know
    logos don't work like that\u2014they are part of an identity system that must
    be durable, and their effect in brand building is cumulative. \r\nSo make sure
    that you have done adequate presentations (with rationale and bullshit) showing
    the logo mocked up \"in action\" in various kinds of media, explaining this to
    them.\r\nAlso make sure that your presentations are slick, big, colorful and in
    person\u2014turn on the salesmanship. It's a necessary evil.\r\nYou may not have
    to go quite this far\u2026\r\nhttp://www.wuala.com/Luzius/Documents/Information/pepsi_gravitational_field.pdf"
