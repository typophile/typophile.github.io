  <BR> <BR>Documents May Be Forgeries <BR>09.10.2004 <BR> <BR>Serious questions have
  been raised about the authenticity of four documents that CBS News said it had obtained
  from the personal files of Bush&#39;s former squadron commander in the Texas Air
  National Guard. We are removing reference to them in our Feb. 8 article on the &#34;Texans
  for Truth&#34; ad until these questions are settled to our satisfaction. <BR> <BR>
  <BR>The four memos were purportedly written by Lt. Col. Jerry B. Killian, dated'

    proportional spacing. There were also typewriters available after 1966 that had
    superscripted th&#39;s, nd&#39;s, and st&#39;s.  <BR> <BR>These typewriters would
    have been available to the Texas ANG. <BR> <BR>Also, as has been pointed in numerous
    places, Killian&#39;s wife and son&#39;s denunciations don&#39;t really mean that
    much as neither worked with the guy. Folks who DID work with the guy haven&#39;t
    denounced the documents, and according to CBS have confirmed that they were consistent.  <BR>
    <BR>Furthermore, if you look at the military documents put out by Bush&#39;s campaign
    last February, many of them do have superscripted th&#39;s. <BR> <BR>My point:
    I don&#39;t know if these documents were forged or not, but if they were, the
    article above doesn&#39;t convincingly demonstrate that. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;

    at &#62; face value anymore, and it seems like factcheck.org has done just &#62;
    that. I think fairly highly of them, but a lot of what they put out &#62; this
    morning can be dismissed. Which is not to say that they aren&#39;t &#62; forgeries,
    just that the case against them isn&#39;t as strong as is being &#62; suggested.'

    You know the one really good thing that would come out of Bush winning a second
    term? All that utter bullshit in Europe about them liking Americans but simply
    having a problem with the government would hopefully collapse&#42;. Gimme a fukking
    break from that escapist, apologetic feel-good coping mechanism. All that crap
    about Americans being treated well when they go to France might finally be put
    in context: what friggin&#39; kind of Americans go to France in the first place
    - the rifle-toting, pickup-truck driving retards who would vote for a bigoted
    doorknob?! The closest they&#39;d ever get to Europe is those faux-themed tourist

    leave Typophile for type, typography, design and communication. I&#39;m continually
    offended that you continue to bring it up. Not all of us share your desire to
    just get rid of Bush even if it means putting a two-faced/two-minded political
    puppet cum mannequin in the White House.

    not the urban/metro areas. As far as I am concerned we should think about creating
    secular states for NY, SF, LA and so on. <BR> <BR>More seriously though, the first
    election wasn&#39;t exactly win by majority, in fact it was &#39;selection&#39;
    not election. If he wins this election than we got nothing to defend ourselves
    with. <BR> <BR>And from my recent jaunt in mexico with and italian and a frenchman
    they agree that this would be how the world would begin to see us. The first four
    years weren&#39;t really our fault. <BR> <BR>That all said, I have never been
    treated kindly in France.'

  body: Except for that last post by Hrant, it seems to me that type, typography,
    design and communication is at the very center of this debate about the memos.
    I&#39;ve seen so much on the internet that is just plain wrong &#40;like the suggestion
    that the Times typeface didn&#39;t exist in 1972 - which the majority of folks
    in this community KNOW to be wrong&#41;. There&#39;s no question to me that the
    typophile community has something to say about this matter and that it&#39;s relevant
    to the interests of this site.  <BR> <BR>And calling Kerry a &#34;two-faced/two-minded
    political puppet cum mannequin,&#34; feels like a provocation which I won&#39;t
    step up to fight against because that WOULD be very off topic.

    just like, it seems, everyone else does. If it is ok to generalize about Bush
    then it must be ok to generalize about Kerry as well. <BR> <BR>Sorry. I snapped.
    It has been a long week.
