  body: "I for one don't have a problem with another sans. just looked over yours
    briefly, two things caught my eye:\r\n\r\nlc d\r\nthe lower left part feels a
    bit odd on close inspection, should be a tad smoother/the curve feels a tad too
    sharp IMO.\r\n\r\nlc k\r\nthe rounding feels odd, too quirky/too fancy, i think
    a straight lc k without any roundings would serve you better.\r\n\r\njust my tuppence
    though."

  body: coop, esp. the roman, that problem seems to be reduced in the italic due to
    it's slant.

  body: I liked the curved leg of the lc k, but I didn't see that design applied to
    any of the other characters so I would go with franz's idea of a straight leg,
    either that or maybe look at applying that to some other characters? Overall this
    seems like a very solid typefamily here, but is missing that 'something" that
    makes it unique, and it could just be a little touch to some of the characters.
    Keep in mind I am not a type designer, I'm a graphic designer. I think you have
    the basis of what could be an excellent type family, like I said it seems like
    it's missing something...

  body: "Chris,\r\n\r\nThanks for the input, I like the lc k as well but I do see
    what you mean about it being on it's own. I did think about using it on other
    characters but I didn't want to shoehorn it in so I could keep the lc k.\r\n\r\nI'll
    post further updates.\r\n\r\nsc."
