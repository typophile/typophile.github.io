  regularity of its appearance and the lack of any depth. but, the software changes
  quite quickly and since i guess it's a cakewalk for you i'm asking...\r\n\r\ni'm
  looking for a software (win) that helps me create or alter new or existing fonts.
  Is there any (good) freeware? any demo versions?\r\n\r\nthanks in advance, and enjoy
  your day!\r\n\r\nChriggy"

    it for Windows (or Mac) at fontlab.com

  body: "If price is your concern (as I imagine from you asking for freeware), there's
    a few budget options:\r\n- <a href=\"url=http://www.cr8.netfirms.com/typelight.html\">Typelight</a>
    is a super simple freeware font editor, that will let you do all the basics.\r\n-<a
    href=\"http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/\">FontForge</a> is an open source font
    editor, from what I understand, has quite a lot of features, but is also not straightforward
    to install on windows.\r\n-<a href=\"http://www.cr8.netfirms.com/type.html#header\">Type
    2.2</a> is typelight older brother, with loads more features. You can buy it for
    \u20AC46.00 EUR (approx US $65)\r\n-<a href=\"http://www.high-logic.com/fontcreator.html\">FontCreator
    </a>is another shareware editor, you can buy a home/professional licence for $79/$149\r\n-And
    finally, <a href=\"http://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/typetool/\">Typetool</a>
    is Fontlab's younger brother, with less features but still a quite robust font
    editor. It's $99\r\n\r\n"

  body: "It's too bad that the FontLab people don't make a demo of Fontographer 4.7
    for Mac.\r\n\r\nIt's really a much cleaner, and intuitive (easy to understand)
    interface. I used it professionally for over two decades, and do not see the great
    advantage of FontLab, besides the fact the industry now expects it to be ones
    primary tool.\r\n\r\nI really hope the FontLab people develop it into a 5th version
    (Fontographer 5) and add basic OpenType support and better integration with Adobe
    Illustrator (one used to simply option-cut and option-paste from each other).\r\n\r\nEven
    if they jacked up the price to FontLab's level, I'd pay it, like thousands of
    others who prefer Fontographer to FontLab.\r\n\r\n(Don't get me wrong: FontLab
    has some really great sophisticated features, so the pros would need both.)"

    FontLab discussion was three years ago, things really haven't changed on the higher
    end. FontLab bought Fontographer (their biggest threat), and made it run under
    System 10. Wow. Great. Will they dare to take it further?\r\n\r\nIf the FontLab
    people addressed all the concerns people expressed are lacking currently in Fog
    (as it's known), it would be their flagship, and FontLab would be reserved for
    us type geeks.\r\n\r\nIf they sat with their Excel speadsheet, they would see
    that with a higher priced Fog 5, they'd have their cake and eat it too. And Adam
    would have twice as much to do!"

  body: "<cite>Why did Adobe let it go?</cite>\r\n\r\nThe same reason Macromedia stopped
    working on it: the market for pro font software is minuscule. It\u2019s not easy
    to turn a profit on font software\u2014especially when your coders are in NorCal
    and Seattle. Leaving it to smaller, more agile firms is really better for all
    involved."

  body: "> FontLab bought Fontographer \r\n> (their biggest threat)\r\n\r\nI never
    considered Fontographer being a threat for FontLab simply because Macromedia stopped
    doing any work on it (including marketing) in 1996. When I was looking for my
    first tool for type design in 1997, I had some experience with Fontographer but
    I felt it was on its dying verge, so I decided to buy FontLab (version 3.0 at
    that point). I ended up being hired by the company seven years later, and all
    that time I did not see much movement on Fontographer, and I actually gave up
    on it. \r\n\r\nIt was Macromedia that approached FontLab with the idea that we
    should buy Fontographer off them before they merge with Adobe. In fact, we were
    quite surprised by this. I think Macromedia felt that within Adobe Fontographer
    will follow the fate of FontStudio and FontChameleon (all tools thaken over by
    Adobe and removed from the market). Font editors is just too small a market for
    a giant for Adobe, and was also too small for Macromedia when the company grew
    rapidly due to the enormous success of Flash. \r\n\r\nSo please be assured that
    we did not consider Fontographer a \"threat\". But of course we did see a value
    in acquiring it: we wanted to learn from the best practices of the application,
    have access to some of the best algorithms, and reconnect with the existing customers.
    \r\n\r\nAnd yes, we do have plans to continue Fontographer, but it's too early
    for me to talk about it publicly. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam Twardoch\r\nproduct
    and marketing manager\r\nFontlab Ltd.\r\n"

    Mac System X compatible and Windows Vista compatible (some day soon), but making
    it adopt some of FontLab's advanced features within its easy to learn and use,
    intuitive interface.\r\n\r\nIf you like FontLab's massive feature list and complex
    interface, buy it.\r\n\r\nIf you prefer Fontographer's interface, and would enjoy
    some of FontLab' features, buy it (now for almost the same price as FontLab) instead.
    :)\r\n\r\nBuy both for a discount.\r\n\r\nJust give Fontographer the features
    to be a good front end for MS Volt.\r\n\r\nThat's my wish list."
