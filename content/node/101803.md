    \r\nNick, I thought they were. They had a problem with vertical metrics in Word
    before, I fixed it, and they were happy ... until now, months later. So maybe
    David is right and it is a Windows-vs-Mac issue. I'll look into it. Thanks for
    your input, both of you."

  body: "I have a similar problem.\r\nNearly always, when I BOLD some Arial text in
    Microsoft Word, the text jumps a point or two higher than the baseline.  I am
    using Word 2007 with Windows XP Professional. Our IT man, who uses Word 2010 on
    Windows 7, has the same problem using Arial text in Word.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/screen-grab_4877.gif]\r\nI'd
    prefer not to switch to another font, because Arial has a nice high x-height and
    is very easy to read. Can you advise?"

    is easy to read). Arial is also ugly, and too pedestrian. Switch as soon as you
