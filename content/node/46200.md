  know what looks good and what doesn't.\r\n\r\nBasically, the place where I live
  has a residents group (?!) and I am interested in designing a new logo for them,
  not that they have on e now.\r\n\r\nIt's a very rural area, and the logo will have
  to reflect that (the current 'symbol' is a Lapwing). As much as I would like, it
  can't be too abstract.\r\n\r\nSo, has anyone any ideas for a logo concept?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nTed"

    designer to do this project, although you may want to consider it if it's worth
    it to the residents' group.\r\n\r\nGive us some more information:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>What
    kind of residents' group?</li>\r\n<li>Who are members of the residents' group?
    \ Give us some demographic information about the group.</li>\r\n<li>What is the
    purpose of the residents' group?  What do they do?</li>\r\n<li>Could we see the
    current logo?</li>\r\n<li>What would you like to achieve with the logo?  What
    does the current logo lack that would require a redesign?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nLet's
    start there.  If you're willing to learn, then I'm sure people will be willing
    to help you.\r\n\r\nYours,\r\nNick\r\n\r\n--\r\nNick Hladek"

  body: "Thanks for the reply!\r\n\r\n- The group was formed when our local council
    announced that they planned to quarry on fields very near the marsh/common where
    we live.  Every year or so we get together and do events (garden openings etc.)
    to raise money to fight the quarrying.\r\n\r\n- Members are in the older half
    of life (40+), and are all friendly people (to use demographic terms :P), all
    married etc.\r\n\r\n- There isn't really a logo now, apart from an image (http://www.rspb.org.uk/Images/lapwing_300_tcm9-139973.jpg)
    with text underneath (NUTFIELD MARSH RESIDENTS GROUP)\r\n\r\n- The logo would
    appear on signs and promotional pieces etc. It doesn't exactly need to be memorable
    as such, just a nice mark that isn't too modern or fussy.\r\n\r\nHope that is
    enough to get started. :)"

    blanks when it comes to thinking one up. Good job I'm not a designer, eh?

  body: "Hello again Ted,\r\n\r\nI would encourage you to research logos of conservation
    groups and find ones that you like.  Then post links to them so that we can see
    what you like, and then offer advice on how you can develop your own idea.  Be
    warned, however: if you want help with a logo design, then you will have to learn
    to be an \"ideas person.\"  We can't help you if you're unable to come up with
    an idea that can be criticized and shaped by others' opinions.  Like I said before,
    by demonstrating a willingness to learn, people may be able to offer advice and
    direction on how you can gain the skills and perspectives to design your own logo.\r\n\r\nI'm
    getting a sense, however, that when you say, \"Help with Logo Design,\" you may
    actually mean that you want other people to come up with an idea for a logo and
    implement it for you.  In this case, you're effectively asking us to design a
    logo for you for free.  If you want pro bono work for your organization, then
    just come out and ask for it.  Notice, however, that people get paid for design
    work, and if you are not willing to hire a designer, then you must be willing
    to accept that there may or may not be people who are willing to do work for you
    for free.\r\n\r\nOnce you've clarified your intentions and what you're willing
    and/or able to contribute to the development of your organization's logo, then
    this will help us in how we can respond to your needs and expectations.\r\n\r\nYours,\r\nNick\r\n\r\n--\r\nNick

  body: "Let us also know how you propose to design the logo - as in what software
    you intend to use.  If you've done any kind of design work before,  then you'll
    probably have some type of graphics package.  I have to agree with Nick though;
    you need to be more transparent about what you actually want to get out of posting
    on these forums.\r\n\r\nJH"

    this site for a while. :) I can see you don't really understand my situation,
    so I will have a go myself.

    to rip it, but it may give you a place to start. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/lapwing_6622.gif]
