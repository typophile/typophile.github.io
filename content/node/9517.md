  body: It&#39;s tempting to give the standard response -- 90% of all logos are custom
    lettering/fonts -- but in this case, Japanese type design is so little known in
    the West, that I wouldn&#39;t stake much on that statement &#40;even though it
    still seems likely to me&#41;. <BR> <BR>When P22 had the <a href="http://www.p22.com/pavilion/"
    target="_blank">Font Pavilion</a> collections of Japanese typefaces, I was amazed
    at the variety of unfamiliar Latin alphabets that were included among all the
    Japanese character fonts. Now, as you see, most of the collections are sold out,
    but you can still look at samples of the fonts.
