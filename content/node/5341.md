  paper might be from the same era, I&#39;m not sure. Anyone recognize the typeface?

  body: The only book I have with any visibility into 50&#39;s typefaces is the Jaspert
    &#39;Encyclopaedia of Type Faces&#39; and I couldn&#39;t find this in the sans
    serif types. Sorry.

  body: Same here. I think this is an old metal face that never made it to North America.
    Perhaps someone with better European specimen books is reading this.
