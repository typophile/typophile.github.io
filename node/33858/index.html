<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hello again,
I'm making a logo for a company that imports and sells hearing aids, they sell other hearing equipment also but their main focus are hearing aids. The name Danalink comes from Denmark (Dana) from where they import their porducts and "link" as a ink between Denmark and Finalnd, where the company is based. Target group is elderly people from 60 years old and upwards.
They wanted a simple and humanist logo.
The sketches I've made so far are mainly my thoughts around a symbol. haven't thought much about the color or type yet, although DIN looks pretty nice.
I'm kinda stuck on the shape of a hearing aid and soundwaves at the moment. Any more ideas or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
That's their old logo http://danalink.tulilla.fi/palkit/bsi/Danalink_logo_harmaalla.gif a friend pointed out that it kinda looks like a smiling penis :)
Peter
<strong>EDIT:</strong> made another version</div>
<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>How bout if the soundwave slowly turn into a stylized ear, like an outline with some subtle details showing the earlobe. You might want to consider using bold DIN to make it easier to read or track out Danalink.
It's a nice start, lets see some more ideas.

The DIN that I have don't go any bolder than that. I'll see if I can find another version, or change some settings in illustrator, I'll change some font setting in illustartor and see if i can get a bolder version.</div>

True, but it'll be facing the wrong way.
I think the symbol 5 in your sketch already sufficiently resembles an ear -- maybe even more if further tweaked.
In any case, you need to adjust the kerning of the letters, it looks terrible right now.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I'm going to send three of the six versions to the client, they want a progress report of sorts. I'm gonna send versions of 2, 3 and 4 for them to look at.
That logo that Scott posted of Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary is a cool concept. I started thinking that maybe I should make something with an element that makes sound instead of an ear, hearing aid or sound waves.
Maybe water and wind. A three that has some leaves that blows away. That would be more humanist. Right now I feel that what I made is a little too cold and technical.

<div class=commentbody>7 weeks since my last update.
This is what happens when you try and hold 5 jobs simultaneously.
I think I got my color palette at least.
Scrapped the sound waves. Now theres a D evolving to an ear. The little D also serves as the inner ear where the small plastic part of the hearing aid goes. I think it's a fairly solid idea that the client will like. Having some problems with the symbol, doesn't look right and I can't see why at the moment, been staring at this version for a while now.
Found a type that I really like, Bliss.
I like it to have this effect depending on where you look you'll either see a D or an ear.
Feedback always welcome.

<div class=commentbody>I really like this.
The swooshes, especially the orange one, get a little thin in the southeast corner. Otherwise, I think it works very well. Somehow the 'l' looks a little dark, but this could just be caused by the small size of the graphic. Maybe open up the kerning by a pixel or two between 'al'.

<div class=commentbody>I like it a lot. But the ear ending doesn't seem right. It just ends.
Both of your arcs are thinner in the middle of the arc (south east)... Maybe correct that. It's more visible with the orange one that the yellow one.
I like the font a lot. "l" does seem a bit darker but I wouldn't change kerning. I'd rather change the letter "l" itself to be just a straight line. Because you have a strange word looking like Danal-ink...</div>

<div class=commentbody>thanks,
One of the reasons I picked Bliss is because of the l. The same kind of l that you find in DIN but the rest of the letters are softer. I haven't actually kerned this yet manually, going to do that later and try to increase the space between the a and the l. I think that l gives it a more humanist touch then a straight one.
The ear needs work. Started thinking that maybe it should have a straighter line from the top to the D, going to try that and see how it looks.
Also maybe adding a rounder shape to the end of the yellow line. So it would resemble an ear a little more and not end so abruptly.
Going to fix the arches.
Also going to try and add a gradient to the ear.

<div class=commentbody>So now I have to versions.
Right now I like number 1 the most. They wanted a more modern version then the old one and I think that 2 is too static.
Made some changes in the type.
I'm going to remove the shadow on the ear. make the bottom part of the biggest swoosh rounder, like in 1. Try some gradients and strokes and see if I can keep the 3D feel without the shadow.

<div class=commentbody>The bottom one has some improvements to the previous version but it doesn't work for me. The #1 looks nice, but it has too much dimension. I'd make the inner ear "D" the same slant as the italics in type. The distance between the lines is too big.</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I'm particular to the last set of redos. I like #2 over #1. I think when you "laid the ear down" for the more dimensional version, you lost a lot of the characteristics that make it seem "ear like". Such as the "lobe" at the bottom and the more recognizable shape of an ear.
I'll agree, that red mark could be seen as an infection. How bout changing it to purple to compliment the purple used in the word mark.
<cite>I’d make the inner ear “D” the same slant as the italics in type.</cite> Robert is on to something there as well. Repetition never hurts a design, and if line angles are consistent they'll amplify instead of compete.
All in all, it's a major improvement over the original comps.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I think 1 is too obvious. I sent the latest version to some people and 3 out of 4 saw an ear.
I think I'll put more effort into the dimensional version. Change the red and make some other tweaks.

<div class=commentbody>Maybe lower the dimension a little bit more...
I can see you adjusted the slant, nut since the curve of the inner ear is different to "D" they don't complement the slant. You'll have to either change that a bit and in the end visually adjust the match.
About the colours. You can put purple as Asvetic suggested or change to something else. But if you'll choose something else, you'll probably have to change type colour too.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Maybe you could put some sort of a lobe onto the end of the orange and yellow swipe? I'm afraid I can't further that idea, but you're right... It just sort of ends abruptly without something there.
What if you put the whole thing in a rectangle with rounded corners or something? Make it a stamp, almost, instead of a mark. That way it'll be more self-contained and easier to use as a graphic.

<div class=commentbody>Ok some more changes.
One problem that I have now is that the two lines melt together when you go really small. Then it looses it's original shape but I'm thinking that at such a small size it doesn't really matter anyway. It will be ok at use for a website and it will probably pass on a business card as well.
I think I will show this version to the client. Kinda nervous because this is the first logo I'm actually getting paid for.
Feedback appreciated.
