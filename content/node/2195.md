  a while &#40;was this site down?&#41;, I kept getting error messages. <BR>Yes, it
  was great meeting you in Rome, even if I realized who you were only on the last
  day &#40;I did make a fool of myself a couple of times asking people I thought may
  be you &#34;Er, excuse me, are you Hrant?&#34;, but your pic on the aTypI booklet
  was a little misleading, I guess&#41;. <BR>:-&#41; <BR>I just realized there is
  a whole thread on post-aTypI going on this server. Let me catch up a little and
  I&#39;ll add more posts. Was Tiffany there too? Oh no, I&#39;m sorry I missed her.
  <BR>Ciao all. '

    ugly&#41; so I just used the one good photo I had, from &#39;86... <BR> <BR>hhp '
