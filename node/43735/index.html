<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>This logo is a relaunch attempt. It was voted favorite from five sketches I put up on our hobby music myspace page. Surprisedly, it's the most straightforward idea I came up with, containing none of the nice little twists I now buried with the other sketches.
Taking it from here ... can anyone suggest a good font type for the name?
The biggest challenge is that it should match the music (here's the [[http://www.myspace.com/antillmusic|myspace page]]). The current font is a modified Blackoak but it reminds me more of a retroish rock band with country elements. Something a little more modern which translates the individual character would be nice. In the music club beats are layered with processed samples of the instruments plus my lazy vocals ;)
Also, the type should look good in a complex, detailed variant (see 1) which we could use on a t-shirt, a reduced variant (see 2) for use on the website and finally a very reduced variant (see 3) for small flexprinting on a cap. Even in scenario 3 it should be legible.
What do you think? General logo suggestions are welcome, too, since I'm still working on the sketch. Once everything's looking ok I'll concentrate on color, kerning etc.

<div class=commentbody>I think most of us were immediately frightened off by the fact that you were taking advice from a myspace poll. Also, typophile was 404 for quite a while earlier this week.
I'll give you my impression of what you've got so far.
Overall, it's way too detailed, and the mix of photographic elements with (what looks like) pencil lines doesn't achieve rugged or grunge - it just looks sloppy. The third version is headed in the right direction, but it's far from complete.
I think (?) your spikes are meant to be a platform, but the way it looks now, it's really more of a violent-looking star. I'd scrap the four "spikes" on the bottom and replace them with a mirror image of the top three spikes (which, btw, I would redraw to center the middle spike, and/or exaggerate the angles for drama.)
Repeat after me; simple is GOOD. Simple is memorable, and simple will save you money. I suggest spending some time looking at vector art (icons and logos) and find some microphone art you like to inspire your rendering. (but stay away from gradients - $$$) Of your three versions, none will scale down AND up and still look like a microphone. The last one is looking ... well, naughty.
In short, I think the silence on this thread is collectively saying; "The font is the least of your worries." Sorry if this seemed harsh, but it's honest. I hope it helps.

<div class=commentbody>Hi Alaskan,
ok, 'Simple is Good'. Thank you for your critique and suggestions.
Simplifying the starlike structure at the bottom and seeking inspiration in vector based art for the complex grille will be my next go.
The grille appears to be the most incompatible portion in regard to flexprint. This should - at least - solve the technical shortcomings ;)
Regarding aesthetics, I like the violent appearance of 'the star'. People who record in studios will identify it as a classic microphone shock mount. Others will take it as a star. Exaggerating this structure is a good suggestion. Also, I don't mind the phallic qualities of the design, it's not for streamlined corporate purposes so that's ok.
Too bad, I would have loved to integrate a font I'm confident with but I guess I'll have to take care of that in step two.
No worries about the 'harshness' of your feedback. I've posted here to learn, not for pats on my back. It was a lot milder than I expected and inspirational.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Listening to their music, I'd go for a brush script style font, like the style <a href=http://sudtipos.com/home target=_blank>Sudtipos</a> specializes in. Something nice and fat like Calgary Script or Milk Script. Then I would draw an illustration to match the type.
