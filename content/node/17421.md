body: "<strong>I got a postcard the other day from some friends who had been to Albania.
  They wondered if they could design the albanian ligatures for a typeface I've been
  working on, and if not, why. The answer is partly because it has already been launched
  and secondly I know nothing about these ligatures (or <cite><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digraph_%28orthography%29\">digraphs</a></cite>?).
  I looked them up on <a href=\"http://diacritics.typo.cz/index.php?id=34\">Diacritics</a>
  and <a href=\"http://www.decodeunicode.org/\">decodeunicode</a>, and yes, there
  they were, but no indication they were to be designed specifically as an <cite>\uFB01</cite>
  or <cite>\uFB02</cite>. Have any of You seen more unique solutions to this? Would
  it be interesting to add special ligatures as alternatives, or is it simply not
  a good idea? Are there any Albanians on this board? <cite>Tungjatjeta?</cite></strong>\r\n\r\n\u0192"
