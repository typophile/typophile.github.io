  box. \r\n2. the \"o\" still red, even after I closed the contours.\r\n3. some glyphs
  need to be typed twice to appear in preview (see image).\r\n4. in preview the \"5\"
  appears instead of the \"@\".\r\n\r\n"

    is a metrics problem, you have to kern them together\r\ncheck for kerning tuts.
    \ \r\n\r\n2. the \u201Co\u201D still red, even after I closed the contours.\r\n\r\nthat
    i dont know... once it writes fine why to bother.. i mean it is your first font.\r\n\r\n3.
    some glyphs need to be typed twice to appear in preview (see image).\r\nsome glyphs
    like \"@\" show you the glyph you are currently working on, on the preview window,
    what i want to say is that some letters written in the preview have also a certain
    function... and you have to write them twice so as they show as a regular preview.\r\n\r\n4.
    in preview the \u201C5\u201D appears instead of the \u201C@\u201D.\r\n\r\nit is
    what i said before. \"@\" = at    so it shows you the glyph you are curently working
    \"at\" ;)"

  body: "IF the \"o\" was turned red to indicate an open contour when you first generated
    the font, and you have corrected the problem, you will have to manually change
    the red indicator by selecting the glyph and choosing \"Mark\" from the contextual
    menu (right click or control click on a mac with a one button mouse) and selecting
    \"None\" from that menu.\r\n\r\nThe red indicator can also mean an incorrect Unicode
    assignment, but that red warning looks different than the one in your example.\r\n\r\nSlash
    and backslash always have to be typed twice, since typing them once is a prelude
    to other actions in FontLab.\r\n\r\nJames"

  body: "<cite>1. gaps between glyph boxes, though I snapped the metrics to each box.</cite>\r\n\r\nIf
    you mean the thin line between boxes: No kerning required, better make boxes a
    little wider than the sidebearings, say 5 units more to each side. In the Metrics
    Panel you can check that each left & right sidebearing is -5.\r\nIt may be that
    in some apps still a white line appears on screen, but in print it should be ok."

  body: "Here are some recommendation from Microsoft regarding the thin line between
    boxes. \r\n\r\n\"When designing connecting glyphs to avoid pixel dropout caused
    by rounding, it is necessary to provide for a minimum of a 70 font unit overlap
    when a 2048 em square (recommended value) is used for TrueType outlines. The amount
    of 70 units will allow for at least the width of the character to be maintained
    during the rasterization process at all PPEM sizes.\"\r\n\r\nref: http://www.microsoft.com/typography/CursiveScriptGuidelines.mspx\r\n\r\n\r\nBest

    Illustrator the glyph boxes are of equal size 90x140 (see the transform palette,
    first image) but after importing in FontLab the \"g\" is smaller than the \"n\".
    thus after importing the \"n\" fits to the metrics - the \"g\" failed.\r\n\r\nwhat
    happened and how to solve this problem?\r\n\r\nhere are the \"n\" and the \"g\"
