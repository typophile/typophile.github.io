  the best way is to use Composite Type0 Fonts, i.e. CID-keyed fonts, either with
  TrueType or PS fonts.\r\n\r\nMy question is, may I just drop, i.e. simply not copy,
  certain tables from original font to the PDF while embedding? In other words, PDF
  specs says, one only needs \"head\", \"hhea\", \"loca\", \"maxp\", \"cvt\", \"prep\",
  \"glyf\", \"hmtx\", \"fpgm\" - if I type a text in PDF using just glyph indexes
  (Type0) - is the font going to work even if I drop all the other tables, including
  \"cmap\", \"GLYF\", \"GPOS\", ..? Sane for TrueType and CFF? Of course I update
  its checksum and Offset Table and Table Record entries accordingly."

  body: "Each font embedded inside of a PDF consists of two \"parts\": a font dictionary
    and a font program. \r\n\r\nMy understanding is \u2014 but this is just me reading
    the spec \u2014 that in general, PDF allows the following font dictionaries and
    programs (Program Key / Program Subtype / Dictionary Subtype): \r\n<ul>\r\n<li><code>FontFile/\u2014/Type1</code>:
    name-keyed Type 1 font, uncompressed (PDF 1.0)\r\n</li><li><code>FontFile/\u2014/MMType1</code>:
    name-keyed Multiple Master font, uncompressed (PDF 1.0)\r\n</li><li><code>FontFile2/\u2014/TrueType</code>:
    GID-keyed TrueType font (PDF 1.1)\r\n</li><li><code>FontFile3/Type1C/Type1</code>:
    name-keyed Type 1-based CFF font (PDF 1.2)\r\n</li><li><code>FontFile3/Type1C/MMType1</code>:
    name-keyed Multiple Master-based CFF font (PDF 1.2)\r\n</li><li><code>FontFile2/\u2014/CIDFontType2</code>:
    CID-keyed TrueType-based font (PDF 1.3)\r\n</li><li><code>FontFile3/CIDFontType0C/CIDFontType0</code>:
    CID-keyed Type 1-based CFF font (PDF 1.3)\r\n</li><li><code>FontFile3/OpenType/Type1</code>:
    name-keyed Type 1-based CFF font with OpenType tables (PDF 1.6)\r\n</li><li><code>FontFile3/OpenType/CIDFontType0</code>:
    CID-keyed Type 1-based CFF font with OpenType tables (PDF 1.6)\r\n</li><li><code>FontFile3/OpenType/TrueType</code>:
    GID-keyed TrueType font with OpenType tables (PDF 1.6)\r\n</li><li><code>FontFile3/OpenType/CIDFontType2</code>:
    CID-keyed TrueType-based font with OpenType tables (PDF 1.6)\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nMost
    font types should also include <code>/ToUnicode</code> and <code>/CMap</code>
    structures. <code>CIDFontType2</code> font should also include a <code>/CIDToGIDMap</code>
    structure. <code>FontFile3/OpenType</code> font types should instead include the
    OpenType <code>\"cmap\"</code> table. \r\n\r\n<ul><li>Type 1 fonts are typically
    converted into a CFF structure, either name-keyed or CID-keyed. \r\n</li><li>OpenType
    TT (.ttf) and TrueType fonts are typically represented as a TrueType structure,
    either without conversion (GID-keyed) or converted into a CID-keyed form. \r\n</li><li>For
    OpenType PS (.otf) fonts, there is a substantial difference: older PDF formats
    (from 1.2) only allowed the embedding of the CFF structure that is part of the
    OpenType font, without the additional OpenType tables. PDF 1.6 allows embedding
    of entire OpenType PS (.otf) fonts, with the <code>\"CFF \" table as well as other
    tables (<code>\"cmap\"</code> etc., but also <code>\"GSUB\"</code>, <code>\"GPOS\"</code>
    etc.). This latter form can also be used to embed OpenType TT (.ttf) fonts.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nSo,
    for PDF 1.2 and above, you can embed Type 1 and OpenType PS (.otf) fonts as font
    dictionaries in the name-keyed CFF format or in the CID-keyed <code>CIDFontType0</code>
    CFF format, and in addition as font programs in the <code>FontFile3/Type1C</code>
    name-keyed CFF format or in the <code>FontFile3/CIDFontType0C</code> CID-keyed
    CFF format. For PDF 1.6 and above, you can also embed the entire OpenType PS (.otf)
    fonts as <code>FontFile3/OpenType</code> programs. \r\n\r\nAnalogously, for PDF
    1.2 and above, you can embed OpenType TT (.ttf) and TrueType fonts as font dictionaries
    in the GID-keyed TrueType form or the CID-keyed <code>CIDFontType2</code> form,
    and in addition as form programs in the <code>FontFile2</code> GID-based or CID-based
    TrueType-based form. For PDF 1.6 and above, you can also embed the entire OpenType
    TT (.ttf) fonts as <code>FontFile2/OpenType</code> fonts. \r\n\r\nThe choice which
    format to choose is basically: which minimal PDF format you want to support. The
    easiest thing to do would be to go with <code>FontFile3/OpenType programs, but
    that only gives you support for PDF 1.6 and above, which is pretty recent. For
    older PDF formats (1.2 and above would be most sensible), you should deal with
    the whole mess of various formats available. \r\n\r\nI would say that the most
    sensible thing would be to always try to use the simplest format available. For
    example, if the font is a non-CJK OpenType PS (.otf) for or a Type 1 font, I'd
    embed it as <code>FontFile3/Type1C/Type1</code> (which is PDF 1.2), or perhaps
    as <code>FontFile3/CIDFontType0C/CIDFontType0</code> (which is PDF 1.3). If the
    font is an OpenType TT (.ttf) or TrueType font, I'd embed it as <code>FontFile2/\u2014/TrueType</code>
    (which is PDF 1.1) or perhaps as <code>FontFile2/\u2014/CIDFontType2</code> (which
    is PDF 1.3). \r\n\r\nSorry, I wish it all were simpler :) \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Ps. Please note that all of my recommendations apply to non-CJK fonts. For
    CJK (Chinese/Japanese/Korean) fonts, you'll be best to always embed them as CID-based
    fonts, but you'll need to make sure that the appropriate standard /CMap is selected
    whenever possible, to avoid duplication of data. \r\n\r\nYet another issue I haven't
    mentioned is subsetting. Embedding fonts as FontFile3/OpenType/* or FontFile2/\u2014/TrueType
    makes sense mostly if you're embedding entire fonts. Otherwise, especially for
    FontFile3/OpenType/*, subsetting is quite challenging. Again, in this case, using
    CID-based fonts (FontFile3/CIDFontType0C/CIDFontType0 and FontFile2/\u2014/CIDFontType2)
    may be the easiest \u2014 and these are probably the two formats you should \"get
    right\" first. \r\n\r\nRemember that between FontFile3/CIDFontType0C/CIDFontType0
    and FontFile2/\u2014/CIDFontType2 there is a *fundamental* difference: FontFile3/CIDFontType0C/CIDFontType0
    basically embeds just the \"CFF\" portion of the font, without any other tables.
    On top of that, a /ToUnicode CMap is recommended. \r\n\r\nFontFile2/\u2014/CIDFontType2
    embeds the *entire* sfnt font structure (some tables may be removed, but they
    also may be kept), and then you need to add a /CIDToGIDMap \"Identity\" structure
    and also a /ToUnicode CMap that basically duplicates the TrueType font's \"cmap\"
    table. At least this is how I understand it. \r\n\r\nAt least this is how I understand
    it :)"

  body: "Hey Adam,\r\n\r\nthanks a lot for the very detailed answer.\r\n\r\nAs I said
    above, I'm targeting PDF 1.3 so full OTF is unfortunately not an option.\r\n\r\nI
    read the specs more-or-less in similar way, except for a few details:\r\n\r\n/ToUnicode
    - is there only to support copy-and-paste of the text from PDF but is not really
    needed for font program to work\r\n\r\n/CIDToGIDMap - this is especially confusing,
    since its requirement varies from spec version to version. The very last version
    says, it's optional\r\n\r\n/CMap - the most important field for this topic - I
    was thinking that I could write \"/Encoding/Identity-H\" and \"/Ordering (Identity)\"
    basically saying that I will be setting the text not in Unicode code points but
    in the form of position indexes of the glyphs in font program. For example, to
    write \"ABC\" I wont write \"ABC\" or \"\\x61\\x62\\x63\" or (whatever the notation
    is), but \"\\1\\2\\3\\\" if \"a\" was the first glyph in the font, \"b\" the second,
    ... In such way /CMap is not needed, as well. But I'm not sure I understood the
    specs well.\r\n\r\nTo rephrase my question, if I have OTF font which I want to
    embed in PDF 1.3, is it ok to drop all but the above mentioned tables, effectively
    converting OTF to, say, TTF and hence making it suitable for embedding in PDF
    1.3? Do the above tables depend on other tables or not? If I use, say, just plain
    Latin 1, I find the glyph indexes in font's cmap, right? And everything needed
    for the glyphs to draw is in \"glyf\" table... And if I use, say, ligatures I
    somehow query the font and search for the indexes again, so for \"fi\" I will
    write \"\\73456\", instead of \"\\66\\69\", am I right? So no other tables should
    be needed?\r\n\r\nIt all seems to me rather complicated (off-topic: *), the most
    simple way out, in my eyes, is to use \"FontFile2/-/CIDFontType2\" and \"FontFile3/CIDFontType0C/CIDFontType0\"
    but I'm not sure how to prepare a font file for embedding so it remains intact...\r\n\r\n*
    is there even small chance that one day there will be widespread support for XML
    fonts? Or completely new, non-legacy font format?"

  body: "Tuom, \r\n\r\n> What do you mean by this? \"Required Tables\" + \"CFF\"?\r\n\r\nNo,
    the story goes like this: at the beginning, there was Type 1, and the CID-keyed
    Type 1-based fonts. Then Adobe invented the CFF structure to represent both these
    font types in a compressed font. And when OpenType was developed by Microsoft
    as TrueType Open, Adobe thought that the easiest way to put PostScript glyph descriptions
    inside of an OpenType font (i.e. an \"sfnt\" structure) is to put the entire CFF
    structure as a new table named \"CFF \" (with a trailing space). \r\n\r\nSo we
    have two basic structures: \r\n* the CFF structure which is a compressed form
    of any PostScript font, and basically only lives inside of PDF files\r\n* the
    sfnt structure which is used in TrueType and OpenType fonts, where the glyphs
    are stored as a \"glyf\" table (for TrueType-based fonts) and as a \"CFF \" table
    (for PostScript-based fonts). This structure can live inside of a PDF file, and
    then it has Adobe's PDF requirements as to which tables are necessary, or it can
    live as a standalone desktop font (with the .ttf or .otf file extension), and
    is then subject to the OpenType spec's requirements. The tables required by the
    PDF spec and the tables required by the OpenType spec are not the same requirements.
    \r\n\r\n<strong>TrueType</strong>-based fonts: <code>FontFile2/\u2014/TrueType</code>,
    <code>FontFile2/\u2014/CIDFontType2</code>, <code>FontFile3/OpenType/TrueType</code>
    and <code>FontFile3/OpenType/CIDFontType2</code> all contain the <strong>sfnt
    structure with a \"glyf\" table</code>, and additional tables.  \r\n\r\n<strong>PostScript</strong>-based
    fonts: <code>FontFile3/Type1C/Type1</code> and <code>FontFile3/CIDFontType0C/CIDFontType0</code>
    only contain the <strong>\"bare\" CFF structure</strong>, not the sfnt structure.
    So there is no way to put \"other tables\" there, because the concept of \"tables\"
    applies to the sfnt structure. On the other hand, <code>FontFile3/OpenType/Type1</code>
    and <code>FontFile3/OpenType/CIDFontType0</code> all contain the <strong>sfnt
    structure with a \"CFF \" table</strong>, and additional tables. The \"CFF \"
    table is identical to the CFF structure, but wrapped inside of the sfnt structure
    which allows room for other tables. \r\n\r\nAgain: the PDF spec lists the \"required\"
    tables within that structure (separately for those with a \"glyf\" table and for
    those with the \"CFF \" table), but this is not the same list of tables as the
    tables required when the sfnt structure is a standalone desktop font with the
    .ttf or .otf file extension (then it is subject to OpenType spec's requirements).\r\n\r\nAs
    for your other questions, it's a bit beyond my expertise, but I've alerted some
    Adobe people to have a look at this thread, so hopefully they can tune in in the
    coming days. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam\r\n"

  body: "As Adam pointed out, font embedding in PDF is somewhat (or extraordinarily,
    depending on your point of view) complex, which is why we developed libraries
    to do this work.\r\n\r\nI can make a couple of comments.\r\n\r\n/CIDToGIDMap is
    useful only for CID-keyed fonts, and its purpose is to map CIDs (used by /ToUnicode)
    to GIDs in the embedded font.\r\n\r\nOne should never embed an entire CID-keyed
    font, due to size. For example, even if the user specifies that 100% of the glyphs
    in a font are to be embedded, the font-embedding functions of our PDF libraries
    will subset, including only the glyphs for the characters that are referenced
    in the document, then embed. This is for reasons of practicality. Name-keyed fonts,
    of course, will have all of their glyphs embedded if the user specifies 100%.\r\n\r\nWith
    regard to computing StemV, I think that it'd simply be taken from the /StdVW value
    of the embedded font's hint dictionary."
