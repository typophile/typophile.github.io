body: "Hey there, I just realised that the anchors I placed in my Fontlab file are
  now all gone. I am livid. Should I be? I can't seem to 'paste special' the anchors
  from an older version of the vfb. Suggestions please \u2013 any scripts that can
  copy anchors?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\nClaus"
