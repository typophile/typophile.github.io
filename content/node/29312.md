  body: "It all depends on the volume you'll be printing, along with what you hpoe
    for as far as unit cost and sale price, and what you want the end result to look
    like. Embroidery is another option.\r\n\r\nMost even slightly developed areas
    will have a screen printing shop, often specializing in T-shirts, and they can
    outsource work that is beyond their on-location capacity.\r\n\r\nIf you're doing
    a very limited run (less than 20), a thermal transfer print might be ideal. The
    transfer material its self is costly, but on a per unit basis, it may be cheaper
    than the set-up charges for a silkscreen, unless you intend to print a couple
    dozen or more."
