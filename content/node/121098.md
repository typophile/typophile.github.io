  body: "Hello, Nick.\r\n\r\nIn general the font is ok, although I suppose it is designated
    for several countries whose alphabet is based on the cyrillic one. Knowing only
    the Russian alphabet, I was wondering which letters are after the capital \u0429
    and which are the last 3 uppercase letters?\r\nIf after the capital \u0429 is
    \u042A, then it was quite difficult to recognize it, for me personally. Because
    its shape looks more to \u0411, which is a quite readable letter in your font.
    But when you meet the \u042A (after seeing \u0411) it is a bit confusing. Also,
    it doesn't look like \u042C. Shouldn't the design of these 2 letters (\u042C and
    \u042A) be quite similar ? Maybe other users have a different opinion...\r\nBy
    the way, for which purposes the font is being designed? It takes some effort for
    me to read the lowercase part.\r\n"

  body: "Hi Tatiana, thanks for your feedback. Yes, the letter after the capital \u0429
    is \u042A. I have now based the shapes of \u042A and \u042C on the \u0411 as you
    said that was the most readable:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Cyrb's_6220.png]\r\nAre
    these better?\r\n\r\nIt would be a great help if you could paste a paragraph containing
    all Russian Cyrillic characters (if that's possible) if you post again, then you
    would be able to see how characters look in the context of words. \r\n\r\nSomebody
    else said \"Very odd \u041F, \u0433, \u043D, \u044C, \u044A & I don't really like
    \u041B, \u044B, \u0443. The Serbian letters are incorrect. Because it's a script,
    it must either have Serbian cursive alternates for \u0433, \u043F, \u0442, \u0448
    or have no Serbian glyphs at all, just not to confuse people.\"\r\n\r\nShould
    the \u041F and \u041B have a crossbar at the top between the two vertical stems?
    I've looked through many handwriting samples and all that I have seen are shown
    without.\r\n\r\nThis is going to be used for advertising. Thanks for your help."

    \u041B - just fine. It is a matter of taste. Why you do not like it?\r\n3.4. \u044B,
    \u0443 ... yeah, but since it is a script font, why don't you make several versions
    of letters and they could be used randomly within the text. That is to say, in
    a paragraph you could have 2 different \u044B or \u0443 and thus you reinforce
    the meaning of a script font. \r\n3.5. Cannot express my opinion about Serbian,

    You will regain your sight :) \r\nJan is right concerning the letters \u043D +
    \u043F. Although \u043F seems quite ok for me, \u043D is indeed difficult to recognize.\r\nAnd
    Maxim gave you a good example of a script font. \r\nNow, you said earlier, that
    \ the purpose of your font is to be used in advertisement. Is it about one word
    or few, or a whole paragraph? If it's about the last one, than I have to say that
    it is quite difficult to read a passage set with your font. It is like a mature
    hand is learning to write... Which actually, is you, trying to write in Russian.
    And because its not your native language, of course, it is more difficult than
    for a native one. Maxim's script is flowing and the letters do not disturb my
    brain from reading the paragraphs. \r\n\r\nReferring to your font:\r\n1. What
    if your characters would be designed with the same or almost the same x-height?
    Maybe, the reading would be easier than. It depends on your final goal: what you
    are trying to achieve?\r\n2. When the height is different between the left and
    right part of the same character, the reading becomes even more difficult. Take
    a look at the following 2 words, \u0443\u0437\u043D\u0430\u043B +\u0443\u043B\u044B\u0431\u043A\u0443,
    how the characters are displayed. \r\nBut if you could manage a similar height
    of characters (nr.1), maybe nr. 2 could be avoided... Again, it depends on how
    many words will be displayed on the advertisement.\r\nAnd by the way, what \"character\"
    would you like to give to your font? \r\nSimilar font was designed by Parachute,
    http://www.parachute.gr/typefaces/allfonts/libera-pro#Cyrillic\r\ncheck all 3
    languages: Russian, Greek, Latin.\r\nYou see, the height of letters is different,
    and even the hight of left+right parts of characters varies sometimes. Of course,
    you are not going to read whole passages set with this font, but in Greece it
    became extremely popular in ad sector. It is widely used for packages. Even, during
    local elections, the banners were displayed with Libera. "

  body: "Dear Nick,\r\nsorry for not being able to catch up with the comments. It
    is because of lack of time, not interest!\r\nHere are some of my comments, at
    the first sight:\r\n1. The font has been upgraded!!! Very nice:)\r\n2. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/screen-capture-14_4508.jpg]\r\n\u043B
    is too open at its upper part. JanekZ's draw shows it better what I mean. \r\n3.
    [img:sites/default/files/old-images/screen-capture-9_3801.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/screen-capture-10_3662.jpg]\r\nDuring
    the reading is a bit confusing meeting the couple of letters \u0438\u0448, \u0438\u0449.
    I was trying to understand when one letter ends and another begins (1st image).
    Nontheless, in the second image, the things are not so bad. So, see what you can
    do, if you want to change something.\r\n4. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/screen-capture-13_5067.jpg]\r\nThe
    transition from \u0435 to \u0433 is to rough.\r\n5. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/screen-capture-12_5769.jpg]\r\nThis
    \"tviordyi znak\" - \u044A seems now foreign among all letters.\r\nThe upper left
    horizontal line could be simplified.\r\nI will try to sneak in again during the
    following days.\r\nGood luck:)\r\n"
