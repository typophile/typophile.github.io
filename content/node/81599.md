body: "Hello everybody,\r\nwell\u2026 I'd like to ask for any feedbacks and/or suggestions
  about the first font I\u2019m publishing.\r\nAt the basis I\u2019m a web&graphic
  designer but I\u2019d like to work in type-design too. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ve called
  my font Radical Display: it is an uppercase-only font family inspired on european
  typographic tendencies of the first half of 20th century.\r\nIt looks rational,
  geometric and blocky. However, it is based on optical proportions.\r\nThis font
  face is designed to be used for headlines, visual identities or short sentences.\r\nLighter
  faces provide a more contemporary and design look&feel, while the bolder ones look
  definitely retro.  \r\n\r\nHere below a little demo:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/demo_4716.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve
  also created a micro site to show it, add more informations and permit its download
  <a href=\"http://typography.synthview.com\" target=\"_blank\">typography.synthview.com</a>.\r\n\r\nI
  plan to complete this font by a series of condensed versions afterwards. \r\n\r\nThank
  you in advance.\r\nJan"

    But \"radical\" it ain't, sorry... Which doesn't mean you <em>have</em> to change
    the name; but you might come up with something more evocative.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    \u201CRadical\u201D. In fact, from a design standpoint I would depart further
    from those typefaces if you want it to have its own identity. The geometric direction
    you're headed with the figures might be the way to go. Just don't get too Avant
    Garde about it."

    refers to in his <a href="http://imprint.printmag.com/type/gotham-and-moderne-sans-serifs/">piece</a>
    on "moderne" architectural lettering. It will reinforce what I assume is some
    European (not strictly American) influence.

    chosen \u201Cradical\u201D just because\r\n1. I like the word :) it makes people
    talk :) and it doesn't seem to be already taken for a font.\r\n2. I had more in
    mind the <em>radical</em> choice to have blocky, solid, geometrical shapes + all-caps
    only. A choice that was radical in the 30s of course, as the italian <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurism\"
    target=\"_blank\">futurist</a> movement was (but don't want to cite futurism for
    font naming to avoid any link to fascism).\r\nI know very well my final design
    isn't \"radical\" at all in 2010, it's not the scope.\r\nThe version shown here
    is the wider one (so more round and closer to Gotham); I'm working on condensed
    versions that look closer to the link Stephan kindly posted. In fact I've an type-photo
    project ongoing too. \r\n\r\n@Hrant: <em>Titling</em> sounds much better, thank
    you!"
