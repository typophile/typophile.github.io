  in advance!\r\n\r\nhttp://logopond.com/members/profile/showcase/61825"

    make it look a bit stronger in that colour.\r\n\r\nThe type suits the theme."

  body: Fun! Think third one works best as main logo, but it would be nice to have
    the chicken picture used elsewhere as a secondary mark. Its tail looks like its
    foot?

    agree, the the C in front does need to be bigger and maybe bolder.\r\n\r\nBendy:
    ahh i didn't see that about the tail! \r\n\r\nI'll be reposting the revised version
    soon! Thanks again!"

  body: "I would go with Number one.\r\nThe plectrum-bodied chicken image is strong,
    original (AFAIK), and cute, and the illustration style and lettering go well together,
    and suit the name.\r\nI actually don't mind the way you've interpreted Duffy Script.\r\nBut
    the Initial C needs to be bigger, so that it doesn't look like ducky's, and rotated\u2014C's
    that have the bottom terminal stronger than the top look too much like G's. And
    the baseline needn't be so firmly indicated; sure, for stability it may be more
    apparent than the median (top of the x-height), but as the median is bounced,
    then it is wrong to have the baseline dead straight. Similarly, the height of
    the ascenders could be slightly different, just as the shape of their loop is
    different. \r\n\r\nNumber two, with two ideas, dilutes the branding.\r\n\r\nNumber
    three is a bit thin and weak, especially in light colour.\r\nThe claw-as-apostrophe
    is a poor metaphor\u2014it's not the right shape for an apostrophe and the claw
    mark is not particularly chicken-ish, so the concept is forced and too obviously
    clever."

  body: "Hi Mr. Shinn! It's an honor to get a critique from you!! Definitely inspired
    by your wonderful creation! I hope you didn't mind me modifying it a bit for this
    project. :)\r\n\r\nThe design is still currently in the works.. Everyone's feedback
    has been very helpful in the revision process. I'll be going with a different
    font, though. Someone has pointed out that it looked similar to the logo of another
    local restaurant, so sadly.. i guess that's the end of that.. Does anyone have
    any suggestions? \r\n\r\nThanks!!!"
