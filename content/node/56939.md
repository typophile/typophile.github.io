body: "In the Adobe Myriad CAD font discussion, John Hudson brought up the following
  point about some custom commissioned fonts: \"I\u2019ve no idea what happened to
  the fonts, but presumably IBM owns them, whether they realise it or not.\"\r\n\r\nWith
  all of these financial institutions, tech companies, etc., going under, I assume
  that quite a few custom typefaces are going to hit the wastebin.\r\n\r\nI think
  it would be interesting to try to make a list of all of the commissioned typefaces
  that have been abandoned and/or forgotten, and perhaps find a way to revert them
  back to their designers or even open source them. (GASP!)\r\n\r\n Any thoughts?"

  body: I wonder what the legal side of that is if you design something and this happens.
    If your contract states what happens that is one thing, but if you have no clause
    regarding the question... Certainly it seem like the designer should be given
    back the rights but that doesn't mean that that is how the legal system works.
    Also if the company has debts that IP might be seen as an asset. The easy thing
    might be to buy it even if it is for a low or nominal cost.

  body: "@Sii\r\nIf you're a person who relies upon new commissions for work, I can
    see your viewpoint making sense. Gotta keep the supply/demand ratio in your favor.\r\n\r\nBut
    as a type lover, for the love of the fonts, wouldn't you at least like to see
    some of the more elegant typefaces reach the public?\r\n\r\nAlso, as Eben discussed,
    it would be nice if the designer had an option to make an additional return on
    their design."

    as we've found, between the bankruptcy court and the bankrupt's vendors. I would
    say the odds of anything good 'hitting the waste bin\" as being pretty slim and
    anything good staying there as extra thin compressed. :)\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n"
