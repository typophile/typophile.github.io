  body: "Nice idea! Maybe tone down the weight of the inset 't' in the uppercase 's'?
    \r\nKerning also looks a little awkward in places, the 'typ' for example looks
    loose in comparison to the other letters, maybe allow them to touch?\r\n\r\nSuperb
    idea though :)"

  body: "'typ' looks much more comfortable. Might be worth making the whited out 't'
    in the cap 'S' more like the swiss cross by making both stroke widths the same?\r\n\r\n"

  body: Uhm. I can shake off an image of a (Christian) cross in S. Definitely a nice
    monogram idea though.

  body: It is the proportion of the cross that pushes it towards the christian look.  Make
    the top stem the same length as the lower and horizontal bars to give it that
    perfect Swiss 3 by 3 grid.  If that is not enough, try moving the cross right
    a small amount so you just get the beginning of the lower stroke terminal of the
    cross cutting into the lower S curve.

  body: 'I don''t believe it will hinder the legibility if you follow Dezcoms suggestions.
    You may have to bring the ''cross/t'' down in size a little to work successfully. '
