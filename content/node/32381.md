body: "Hi All,\r\nThis one is escaping me at the moment.  It shares many characteristics
  of Univers--the only differences I'm noticing off hand are the condensation of certain
  letters (like the E), the legs of the K not meeting at a point, and an overall more
  roundedness.  The source of this scan is from 1972:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pharaohs-label_5568.jpg]\r\n\r\n"

  body: Not sure you'll find a digital typeface to match this exactly. Futura Bold
    will get close except for that G. Gotham is also a nice geometric sans but doesn't
    have the condensed E or similar K.

    body: "Thanks--I was scared that that was going to be the sad truth.\r\nIt's so
      unfortunate how many good-looking typefaces got lost or changed drastically
      when design went digital.  I would think there would be enough demand for some
      true-to-form digitization of these old school letterpress / letraset / etc.
      typefaces and variations for a foundry to take on the task.\r\n\r\nThere's another
      font on here I would've sworn is Futura at first glance, yet it has a 1 and
      a more similar to Avenir.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pharaohs-label2_4638.jpg]"

  body: "A lot of the classic sans faces had their 'equivalents' \u2014 produced by
    competing foundries. Slight variations, sometimes requested by a specific market,
    were introduced during this process of 'adaptation', eg different lc a and numeral
    1."
