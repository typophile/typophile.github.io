  I'm currently doing which uses Georgia. I opened the site in Internet Explorer 7.0
  and noticed that my font of choice (Georgia) was slaughtered. Has anyone encountered
  this problem or maybe know a good alternate, it really looks bad. Man do I dislike
  IE.\r\n"

    MS spend on typography, they sure didn't invest enough in anti-aliasing......

    if you have ClearType turned off in your display properties. '

  body: "Thanks everyone for the posts. Ralf, there is only one css declaration for
    the header and no\r\n\"ie specific\" declarations. As you can tell the font on
    the IE rendering has to drop down a line while in the firefox rendering does not.
    This just seems like a drastic change when 2 browsers render the same font."

    browsers handle HTML and CSS declarations differently, haven't you? \r\nCheck
    your CSS! It seems to trigger the bold style in IE, but of course you can overwrite
    this standard behaviour, even in IE. "

  body: Hey Ralf, just got to thinking. I know different browsers interpret attributes
    differently. There is no weight attribute in my stylesheet so I dont see why IE
    is interpreting it as bold as opposed to firefox as regular. That is why i thought
    the font was "slaughtered" because it renders in a entirely different weight.
    I'm not sure if this is appropriate to post in this forum, sorry if it is.

  body: haha, just figured it out guys sorry for the confusion. the <.h1.> attribute
    automatically carries a bold weight in IE7. Sorry for all the fuss.

  body: "*whimper* Microsoft and their half-hearted attempt at compliance or parity
    with their competitors leaves me as a designer heartbroken, lonely and sad.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft
    in my opinion doesn't hit a lot of the targets even they set for themselves, which
    seems like poor-performance, even by their own measures, and using competitive
    measures they are behind the market, while also being the most costly, and also
    the most used.\r\n\r\nHow does this happen?\r\n\r\nI wish that you could design
    websites with the same power and flexibility of PDFs (easily embedded fonts, dynamic,
    portable).  I don't mean using flash either.  I mean an entirely self-contained
    dynamic document format, and let RIA's use code and live out of the browser like
    Adobe AIR is trying.\r\n\r\nI think the web and the web applications need to separate
    ways, to both leave the browser and allow the designer/developer to have the utmost
    control, and not rely on another person's shoddy implementation of what 'ought
    to be'\r\n\r\nMy only recommendation for you is, if you wish to maintain the highest
    order of parity between your site out of Internet Explorer and in IE, you need
    to manually account for the differences using a seperate IE-only CSS file, and
    only load that upon browser check.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot Microsoft!"
