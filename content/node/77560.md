  havent been able to find anyone who can identify. I used the whatthefont generators
  etc but they never got the font right. On the site where I found the font it is
  called \"GG-Regular\", but when I search this font it doesnt come up, so I think
  this is just what they decided to call it.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\nJames "

    seems to come close."
