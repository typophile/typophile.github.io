  rounds of concepts that showed various plays on saws/horses, incorporating an actual
  saw horse into the letter 'w' or 'm' etc. \r\n\r\nThey ultimately liked this one
  the most because its like a saw blade and blades of grass (which they love), and
  nods to the company's creative + simple approach to web projects. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/grasshorse2_4480.png]"

    they're facing down.\r\n\r\nI also think the blades look a bit cheaply done \u2014
    like you spent 10 minutes with the pen tool. Try working with more blade shapes
    to create a friendlier, more thought-out look.\r\n\r\npenn"

  body: "Consider using Fakir for the type if you're going to keep the sawblades like
    that. :->\r\n\r\nSeriously: Think about the white too. There's some funky stuff
    going on in the negative space, and a lot of it looks accidental. That probably
    helps the impression that there doesn't seem to be much conscious interaction/interconnection
    between the two elements, and that the type is just sitting there on top of the
    blades.\r\nMaybe consider overlapping, too, to hurt the type less? :-)"

  body: What if you had some of the "cuts" placed strategically to make the whole
    thing more legible? Like have them curve into the negative spaces of the letterforms,
    particularly between the A and W or S and E. Right now it looks like you made
    the grass blades separately and placed them on top of the text instead of drawing
    them into the text. Does that make any sense?

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sh_logo_new3_b_5957.png]\r\n\r\nRevisited
    the concept with the client. They liked the 'grassy' logo, but we all felt it
    was too far removed from both the word association w/ 'sawhorse' and from their
    actual business -- building simple, no-frills web applications from scratch.\r\n\r\nThis
    concept won them over because it references d.i.y. construction, coding, and a
    rough gesture of a sawhorse."

  body: And the bar cuts through it as well (hints of "sawing" through things). Nice.
    This is a stronger concept and better executed as well.
