body: "Hey guys.  My sister asked me to do her wedding invitations, but I am not so
  sure I should have told her yes.\r\n\r\nShe didn't like any of the script fonts
  I suggested, and instead chose <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/sloop/scriptthree/\">
  Sloop </a>.\r\n\r\nNow I am having trouble finding a font that I think looks good
  next to Sloop for the body of the invitation (only their names are in sloop).  I'm
  looking for a classy serrif.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nKent"

  body: yes, gill's stuff often works well with scripts... aries or joanna would also
    look good... of course, gill sans light would look lovely if you're prepared to
    go for a sans!
