  body: Just wait until the Russians find you. I get dozens of &#34;cheap trips to
    the Baltics&#34; offers daily, but I&#39;d have to leave from St. Petersburg.
    If only I&#39;d help that nice widow get her millions back, I could afford it...

    I had, to send my bank account information so they can deposit millions of dollars
    into it.

  body: I always fell terrible about those poor ex-Nigerian oil ministers, and those
    ex-bureaucrats from South Africa. <BR> <BR>Seriously though, my spam mail is significantly
    less interesting than it was a few years ago. Maybe I just have better filters
    now. I used to enjoy getting ads for penis AND breast enlargements on the same
    day.

  body: The newest scam here is Idenity thief where they send you an urgent email
    informing you if you don&#39;t fill out a new form you will have your accounts
    terminated. I get these from my people claiming there from my IP, Banks &#40;even
    ones I don&#39;t have accounts with&#41;, Insurance you name it. All will be well
    once you give them your bank account information and credit card information.

    into a <a href="http://www.eciad.ca/~evensz/woodtype.pdf" target="_blank">little
    project</a> and created an old wood type poster out of the texts.

    otherwise. <BR> <BR>That said, nicely done!'

    Porn Too&#41;&#34;  <BR>variety. Spam to stop spam? How silly can they get? <BR>
    <BR>Seriously, my worries will soon be over when I&#39;ll have moved to <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/"
    target="_blank"> Thunderbird</a>,  <BR>which has an incredibly efficient spam
    filter, the best available. <BR> <BR>Zara, now <i>that</i> is a wikkid piece.
    What a brilliant idea to turn that garbage into  <BR>such a great typographic
    composition.

  body: No, Raph, I&#39;m saying that the text, as used, is generic. I get dozens
    of these e-mails, and they all use variations of the same text. Presumably they
    are not all from the same person, so unless someone were to come forward and say
    &#39;I wrote the originals on which all these are based&#39;, I think these texts
    have long since ceased to be anyone&#39;s intellectual property. Intellectual
    property needs to be defended, and if it is not it ends up in the public domain
    before its time. <BR> <BR><i>[Should I be reading in a smiley the second time?]</i>

    and check for false positives regularly, but ever since my provider merged with
    another provider recently, the amount has dropped to a few a day, down from over
    a hundred. Rather boring, really. <BR> <BR>My favorite riff on spam is <a href="http://www.spamusement.com/"

  body: I get lots of Russian and Japanese spam, which I don&#39;t mind so much as
    the English spam because I get to look at some of the more &#39;exotic&#39; fonts
    on my system. I&#39;ve received a couple of Arabic spams over the years, which
    was nice, and a handful of Hebrew spams which are boring because they don&#39;t
    include Biblical cantillation marks. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m still waiting for a spam
    in Devanagari or one of the other Indic scripts.
