    like something a Shee'a splinter group would have had as a logo. But if the client
    likes it... Maybe you should talk to him and see if his views are so discordant
    with yours that you'd lose too much* sleep over doing the job.\r\n\r\n* Losing
    <em>some</em> sleep always comes with the territory.\r\n\r\nBTW falconry is big
    in some Arab countries, but not so much in Lebanon. It's like how flamenco is
    <em>not</em> big in Catalonia.\r\n\r\nJoe is right about the complex richness
    and even deep contradictions in Lebanon*, and I also share his unease with depicting
    \"anti-personnel\" weapons**, but his expressions of religious discrimination
    make me cringe. You'd think he's from Texarkana, not the UN's \"most multicultural
    city\"... Unlike Joe, I was there, and speaking as an Armenian -the first nation
    to adopt Christianity- I would say that -lacking more insight into the particular
    person- you should have no qualms about working for a Muslim, especially ones
    from Lebanon. They tend to be some of the most tolerant people you'll ever meet.***
    During those 17 years we Armenians always had the biggest problems with <em>Christians</em>:
    we refused to take sides so they tried to dominate us, coming in to San'a and
    Bourj Hammoud, killing a large number of our people. In contrast, except for a
    couple of weeks during which a Muslim splinter group started murdering prominent
    Armenians (they were shut down pronto by fellow Muslims) we were always treated
    with the highest respect by Muslims. Something else worth remembering is that
    the Jewish people had their Golden Age during Spain's Muslim era. Joe's stance
    is as jingoistic as an extremist Muslim calling for Christians to be avoided.\r\n\r\n*
    Like how many Lebanese Christians actually want to believe they're French.  :-/\r\n\r\n**
    Hunting is OK in my book, as long as you use the results.\r\n\r\n*** Except for
    the sad, long-standing Shee'a versus Sunni animosity.\r\n\r\nBTW, I also don't
    buy that tattoos are un-Islamic. As with any other aspect of any religion, it's
    always open to individual interpretation. That's what makes us human.\r\n\r\nOne
    other thing Neil: you know you can't mirror something with writing on it, don't
    you?  :-)\r\n\r\n<blockquote>You would never be using a \u201Cfont\u201D for tattoos

    bad results; we've seen that in the Industrial Revolution and to a lesser extent
    in the Great Depression.\r\n\r\nBut in the period from 1948 to 1968 or so, the
    Western world made capitalism work, as even the United States was not afraid to
    participate in the economy with tax money to moderate the problems unfettered
    capitalism can lead to.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the countries calling themselves
    \"socialist\", however much they were pledged to high ideals, were, in practice
    brutal totalitarian regimes not much different from Nazi Germany.\r\n\r\nThe fact
    that people are able to keep what they earn from working, and they can save some
    of it and put it to productive use - earning money from use or rental of tools
    or housing they own - is not a bad thing. For the government to be the only employer
    and the only landlord is what is bad, because while the ballot box is the basis
    of freedom, it's a slender reed for keeping governments honest - politicians don't
    always keep their campaign promises in democracies, and there can be particularly
    egregious cases of that. So there need to be other centers of power in a society
    - religion is one of them, and private wealth another.\r\n\r\nWe don't live in

    to the original poster's question:\r\n\r\nThere is no brave youth except Ali,
    and there is no sword which renders service except Zulfiqar.\r\n\r\nI suspect,
    though, that in Arabic, this type of construction has an idiomatic meaning not
    found in English; that what is really meant would be conveyed by the paraphrase:\r\n\r\nThere
    is no brave youth like Ali, and there is no sword which renders service like Zulfiqar.\r\n\r\n...
    in order to convey the meaning that Ali is the bravest of youths without the flat
    statement that absolutely no other brave youths exist.\r\n\r\nThe Wikipedia article
    also notes that Ali was the first male follower of Muhammad, and even exhibits
    an ambigram in which the two names transform into one another by being turned
    upside down.\r\n\r\nThis explains Muhammad Ali.\r\n\r\nThe article also supplies
    information pertinent to the original query, although the answer appears to me
    to finally end up as ambiguous. While it's a motto that a jihadist might well
    revere, it's also one that apparently resonates pretty broadly through the mainstream
    Muslim world in legitimate contexts as well."

    way as Christians and Jews are, who believe there is no God but Y-h-v-h.\r\n\r\nChristians
    acknowledge Jews as \"people of the book\" in somewhat the same way that Muslims
    acknowledge Christians and Jews, as Islam teaches that Jesus and Moses and Abraham
    and others were actual prophets sent by God.\r\n\r\nThe historical decision by
    the Mughals and associated regimes to extend eligibility for \"dhimmi\" status
    to Hindus is not necessarily in line with the main stream of Islamic jurisprudence;
    I believe, based on my limited understanding of the matter, that those in the
    Middle East who subscribe to a conservative interpretation of Shari'a would hold
    that Hindus should properly have been given the choice of conversion or death
    (or at least slavery) like other pagans (i.e. sub-Saharan Africans).\r\n\r\nGiven
    the conditions of life as a \"protected person\" under Muslim rule, as experienced
    in the present day by Coptic Christians in Egypt, for example, or by members of
    religious minorities in Pakistan, Islam doesn't seem particularly tolerant if
    you judge it by the standards of modern industrial societies. Like the U. S. with
    its First Amendment, and founded by people fleeing religious intolerance in Britain.\r\n\r\nCompare
    what we are now to the Muslim world, after we've been shocked to the core by the
    Holocaust into a thorough rejection of inequality in all its forms, and they come
    off badly.\r\n\r\nCompare Europe in the Middle Ages to the Muslim world in the
    Middle Ages, though, and the Muslim world denied Jews full equality - treating
    them a lot like blacks under segregation - while the Christian world massacred
    them with regularity.\r\n\r\nFrom some Muslim perspectives, even in the modern
    era the Islamic world comes off favorably - since the Holocaust happened in the
    West, and what do you mean it doesn't count? But given the effort and sacrifices
    made by the United States, Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand in fighting
    the Axis in World War II, and what France, Poland, Norway, Belgium, Holland, Czechoslovakia,
    and others suffered under Nazi occupation, what do you mean the misdeeds of the
    Nazis are <em>our</em> fault?\r\n\r\nI think the moral argument is a futile one
    here; both sides can make a case, and all that is generated is hot air.\r\n\r\nI
    see this issue in coldly practical terms instead. The United States has an immense
    industrial base and advanced military technologies. It got away with Negro slavery
    precisely because nobody in Africa had the Bomb in the 1776-1865 period.\r\n\r\nAfter
    September 11, 2001, everything happening in the Islamic world is under intense
    scrutiny. The wisest policy for any regime wishing to continue in existence at
    this time is to distance itself as much as possible from terrorism - and doing
    so basically includes stuff like full legal equality for non-Muslims, non-belligerency
    towards Israel, total cooperation with the United States in its global hunt for
    terrorists.\r\n\r\nThis has nothing to do with what's fair. Those who have the
    power to act in order to protect themselves and their loved ones from deadly violence
    will do so. Those who do not must simply politely ask, and count on our innate
    sense of fairness and benevolence to produce a positive response, that the U.S.
    watch where it is having its drones fire their weapons.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand,
    watching Barack Obama withdraw the U.S. from Afghanistan, maybe I'm being too
    (optimistic/pessimistic) in thinking that there is no way that the U.S. will ever
    stop stomping on the whole Islamic world until the last violent extremist there
    is wiped out.\r\n\r\nI put \"optimistic/pessimistic\" in brackets there because
    I both do want a decisive victory over terrorism, and no harm to come to the blameless
    people who make up the overwhelming majority of the world's Muslims. I think both
    goals can be achieved if more cooperation is forthcoming."

    are foolish. There is no reason for others to share in that foolishness. But it's
    never easy for anyone to look at their own conduct and recognize their own failings.
    Therefore, the strong, who have the luxury of acting as they will, may neglect
    this. But the weak cannot afford to do likewise."

    the historic corollary of a perpetual war state. Add the risk of nuclear war,
    and the question begs: why do we tolerate this?\r\n"
