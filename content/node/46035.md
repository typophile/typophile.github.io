body: "Hey, i just compleated a self negotiated brief i did.. i just felt like coming
  up with a pure typographical poster for a l=kind of front cover for the guardian
  newspaper... i know it wouldnt be used as a front cover!.. just fun really as i'm
  quite obsessed with making things out of linocutting.. like the linocut animations
  i have done..\r\n\r\nanyway i am wanting to send a print of this (a bit bigger then
  A0) poster to the guardian. I dont know if they would like it, but i want to send
  it, but on the website it says i think that they do not like receiving artworks..
  so yea i dont think i can send it? what can i do? i dont even know if they would
  like it..\r\n\r\ncheers\r\n\r\nmy flickr that shows the carving itself is http://www.flickr.com/photos/markandrewwebber/sets/72157603892334695/

  body: If they say on the website that they don't want to receive artwork, I guess
    sending it would be a shame of that nice print. But if you have more than one
    print, I guess you don't lose much by sending it anyway! :)
