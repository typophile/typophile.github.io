  to a book job I'm doing; I've installed them successfully in the ColorSync folder
  in my library. Beyond that, I'm not sure how to use them. How do I use them in InDesign
  CS4, and when exporting to pdf (Acrobat Pro v8)? How will I know that it's worked?
  Any help appreciated."

  body: If you use output to a profiled PDF then you should place all images as RGB
    (to ensure maximum colour-gamut). Text, vector art and other elements can be in
    CMYK. Now generate the PDF and choose PDF/X-1a:2001 as the PDF preset. In the
    'Output' pane under 'Colour' and 'Colour Conversion' choose 'Convert to Destination
    (Preserve Numbers)'. In 'Destination' just below, you choose the ICC profile that
    was supplied to you. Press 'Export'.

    just to make sure, I don't have to adjust the individual images themselves? The
    pdf output will apply the correct adjustment?\r\n\r\nAppreciate your help."

  body: "Yes, for greyscale images just place them as usual in InDesign, but do check
    in Acrobat Pro if they are still greyscale (only on the black plate) in the PDF.
    If they are converted to profiled CMYK then you and the printer will have big
    problems making them a neutral grey.\r\n\r\nI presume you have set the Creative
    Suite 'Colour Settings' in Bridge so that they are synchronized across your applications?\r\nIf
    you are in the US, then choose the 'North America Prepress 2' setting.\r\n\r\nYour
    images certainly don't adjust themselves. What a profiled PDF generation does
    is translate your RGB images into the optimal representation for the given printwork.
    This translation \"dictionary\" is the ICC profile itself. The printed piece will
    look as close as possible (given the limitations of process printing and paper
    stock) to how your RGB images look on an accurately calibrated monitor.\r\n\r\nYou
    must have a calibrated monitor to adjust each image in Photoshop. In OS X the
    manual calibration works well enough, but only if you turn on expert options.
    In Photoshop you work on your profiled RGB images and choose 'Proof Colours' under
    the 'View' menu as intermediate and final checks.\r\n\r\nRemember \u2013 this
    is the executive summery \u2013 there are many ways to bork this workflow, and
    only a few ways to get it right."

  body: "Good job Claus.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, getting good results converting the
    data in your image to the colorspace represented by the printer's ICC profile
    carries the assumption that the colorspace you work in accurately characterizes
    what you see. That's why your monitor must be calibrated. Over time, you can learn
    to work off a monitor, but it is best to make internal proof prints. We prefer
    ink jet, but a laser printer will work. It too must be profiled. A laser printer
    needs to be profiled daily, inkjets seem to hold up for quite a while, at least
    for grayscale.\r\n\r\nIt is best to have several profiles for your proofing printer,
    one to simulate uncoated stock, one for coated stock. Esp. for \"grayscale\" (rarer
    to find color to print on an uncoated sheet, though it happens). You will be stunned
    to see how low the dynamic range is with uncoated papers (i.e., what happens to
    the blacks).\r\n\r\nViewing conditions for the proofs are critical. Most printers
    use a strong, 5,200 K light. No reader uses such a light. Incandescent light is
    about half that. Both color temperature and intensity strongly affect how an image
    looks. I think it pays to check under both conditions and compromise. I prefer
    to work with a 3,200 K LED-lamp if limited to one source. Movable, to vary intensity.\r\n\r\nIt
    is uncommon for a printer to have/offer an ICC profile for halftone work, esp.
    for an uncoated sheet. We usually wind up having to create them by having the
    printer run our test grid, then measuring what happens on that press proof. But
    if done carefully, this technique should give you a pretty good profile for a
    specific sheet at a specific printer (but maybe not for a sheetfed versus web
    press at the printer). A good printer should be able to hold less than +/- 5%
    across time. If you take care, you can get pretty amazing halftones on an uncoated
    sheet; obviously better still with a coated sheet -- almost double the dynamic
    range.\r\n\r\nBe very careful about the colorspace when bringing B&W images into
    InDesign."
