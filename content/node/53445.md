body: Sometimes when I run the Adobe auto-hinter Fontlab macros all of the curve points
  in my font become corner points. Is my install of the FDK screwed up, or is this
  a known problem? If so, do I work around it by copying the old outlines back into
  the font?

    be presented with the dialog shown below. Make sure that the option \"Allow changes
    to glyph outline\" is unchecked.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/autohint_5632.png]\r\n\r\nIf
    the issue persists send me some files and we'll look into it. Thanks."
