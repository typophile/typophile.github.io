  the oddity of the tittles on uppercase that i'm interested in. A typeface like PDU

  body: "You could look for typefaces which support Turkish, specifically Latin Capital
    Letter I with Dot Above Unicode: U+0130 (\u0130), used to differentiate capital

    close (though it\u2019s dotted capital |I| has a dot that isn\u2019t as wide as

  body: I've seen a few DIN-ish typefaces with a similar |R| (but I don't have time
    now to hunt them down to check for Turkish support).
