body: "I'm looking for the (name of the) font that consists of dots and these shapes,
  I believe the English word would be cone or halter, simmilar to the elements of
  a bycicle chain.\r\nWhere the lower case 't' would look something like in my terrible
  scetch.\r\nThanks in advance!"

  body: Nebulae comes close, thanks, but it is more regular, more mathematic, with
    all elements at the same size. I will try Nebulae and see if a site comes up with
    'similar fonts'.
