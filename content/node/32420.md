  probably would have already found the answer to my question. It also doesn't appear
  to be in the Fontlab 4.6 manual.\r\n\r\nCan anyone show me an example of proper
  implementation of the [[numr]] and [[dnom]] OpenType features? I can get the frac
  feature to do basic substitutions for the standard set of fractions, but it seems
  that the frac feature can call the numr and dnom features, but I haven't seen anywhere
  a specific example of how to make that work. I'd be most grateful for some insight
  into that mysterious process.\r\n\r\nBelow is the code I'm currently using to get
  the [[frac]] feature to work, in case it gives you some idea where I'm at.\r\n\r\nfeature
  frac {\r\n  sub [one one.lnum] [slash fraction] [two two.lnum] by onehalf;\r\n  sub
  [one one.lnum] [slash fraction] [four four.lnum] by onequarter;\r\n  sub [one one.lnum]
  [slash fraction] [three three.lnum] by onethird;\r\n  sub [one one.lnum] [slash
  fraction] [eight eight.lnum] by oneeighth;\r\n  sub [two two.lnum] [slash fraction]
  [three three.lnum] by twothirds;\r\n  sub [three three.lnum] [slash fraction] [four
  four.lnum] by threequarters;\r\n  sub [three three.lnum] [slash fraction] [eight
  eight.lnum] by threeeighths;\r\n  sub [five five.lnum] [slash fraction] [eight eight.lnum]
  by fiveeighths;\r\n  sub [seven seven.lnum] [slash fraction] [eight eight.lnum]

  body: "Hi Andrew. I'm a little confused by your message. I don't think you want
    to try to call 'numr' and 'dnom' with 'frac' -- at least for simple, prebuilt
    fractions like in your example. Your code seems fine for what you're trying to
    do.\r\n\r\nIt can be useful to \"call\" the 'numr' feature in 'frac' with arbitrary
    fractions. This is an example of what I mean:\r\n\r\n<code>feature frac {\r\n
    \ lookup NUMR;  \r\n  sub [@SLASH @FIG_DENOMINATOR] @FIG_NUMERATOR' by @FIG_DENOMINATOR;\r\n}
    frac;</code>\r\n\r\nThe 'numr' and 'dnom' features are starting to look unnecessary,
    since there is usually little reason to create numerators or denominators without
    creating a whole fraction -- which is what 'frac' does all by itself. So I recommend
    putting 'numr' and 'dnom' in fonts, but not consider them components or \"sub-features\"
    of 'frac'."

  body: "<em>but it seems that the frac feature can call the numr and dnom features</em>\r\n\r\nThe
    official feature descriptions are a bit confusing in this regard. When Adobe first
    registered the frac, numr and dnom features, they had this idea that frac would
    'call' the other two features. And this combination of features would allow for
    arbitrary fractions. As I understand it, the idea was that the application or
    layout engine would perform the feature calls to the numr and dnom features, based
    on a character level analysis (numerals before the slash get the numr feature
    applied to them, numerals after the slash get the denominator feature applied
    to them). But no one had got around to implementing this in a layout engine by
    the time I came along with a scheme building arbitrary fractions contextually,
    directly within the frac feature. Which is what pretty much everyone has been
    doing ever since.\r\n\r\nI believe Adobe make the arbitrary fraction code available
    with the FDK."

    I recall that in the demo of Quark 7, the fraction feature was ignored, and the
    fractions built on the fly from numr, fraction character, and dnom. At least that
    was my understanding, and I assumed it was done for backwards-compatability of
    older files."

    numerator figures in \"numr\" and digits by denominator figures in \"dnom\". The

    some lookups that were also used in numr or dnom. \r\n\r\nA."

  body: It can be. In many fonts, the percent sign does not match the look of the
    fractions. Even if it does match, I don't think it needs to be included in the
    frac feature. If a user wants a percent sign, it's right there on the keyboard.
    I can't imagine someone going to the trouble to type zero slash zero, select it,
    and then apply the Fraction feature, just to get a percent sign. If they are using
    0/0 as a fraction, that would be semantically different from the percent sign
    anyway, and the Fraction feature would still work on it just like any other arbitrary
    combination.

  body: "No problem. As I mentioned, I think I cribbed it partly from Adobe's code.\r\n\r\nNote
    that if you have other pre-built fractions, you can add those in as well in the
    first section.\r\n\r\nAlso, Bendy, you mention the idea of using liga for the
    pre-built fractions. That would be a bad idea. Ligatures are usually on by default,
    so the fraction sequence would be converted indiscriminately. Thus, if the user
    typed \"9/11/2001\" they would get \"9/1\xBD001\". :-0"

    both cases, the drawback is the same: indiscriminately applying the feature to
    strings that should not be touched. In case of Tal's suggestion, this drawback
    is easily addressed by adding a few \"ignore\" statements which make sure that
    dates and other strings following the pattern slash--digit(s)--slash are left
    intact. Btw, the free style of FF Dagny shows that FontShop has adopted Tal's
    approach including a safety belt like I mentioned, so obviously they consider
    this approach as safe enough, like I do too.\r\n\r\nAs to the second part, it
    is not necessary to deal with prebuilt fractions in frac. These exist for legacy
    reasons, so add them to the font but then leave them alone. A frac feature can
    compose a \xBD from numerator-one plus fraction-slash plus denominator-two, the
    same way it would compose any other arbitrary fraction."
