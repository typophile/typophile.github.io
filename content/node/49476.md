  body: "I have consulted Hitchcock's Benton Types. What do you want to know about
    it? \r\nPatricia Cost is the authority on Benton's life and will be publishing
    a book on her research. She interviewed his daughters and has a lot of personal
    information about him. My research was into his type designs, not his life. I
    wanted to know why he has remained relatively obscure and what made him tick as
    a designer. The ATypeI presentation was necessarily condensed from the dissertation
    I did at Reading, but it included some research done post-Reading. If you'd like
    more information you can contact me offline."
