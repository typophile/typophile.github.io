  NYC.\r\nAs a part of my studies I have started the research process for my thesis,
  and clearly convinced that I wanted this to deal with Type I have come to a point
  were OpenType has crossed by.\r\n \r\nFor this matter I've tried to read as much
  information on the web and in all the blogs about this subject, (typophile, typographica,
  typotheque and typblography) to get to a point where I would like to ask for opinions
  and advice from all of you (typographers, type designers and graphic designers)
  about your opinions and expectations regarding OpenType.\r\n\r\nSome generic questions
  that come to my mind are:\r\n- Is OpenType going to become the standard format in
  the near future putting apart TrueType and PostScript fonts?\r\n- Will OpenType
  allow for better typographical usage from general users?\r\n- Will the internet
  benefit from the use of OpenType?\r\n- Will most common applications become OpenType
  savvy?\r\n\r\nA more precise question that I have is about the possibilities that
  OpenType encoding can allow.\r\nTaking Amy Papaelias great thesis project as starting
  point, ( http://www.typetalkfonts.com/typetalk_demo.html  &  http://typographi.com/001007.php
  ) I have been wondering how far can we take the encoding of OpenType fonts. Any
  thoughts?\r\n\r\nI'd kindly appreciate anyone's opinions, comments or suggestions
  for future readings, directing me to other posting or to any other related materials.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nGiovanni

  body: "I think you need to do a good deal of background reading about the OpenType
    format. It is pretty crucial to understand and use the terminology of the technology
    in a consistent and accurate way. For instance, your phrase 'OpenType encoding'
    is problematic and doesn't obviously relate to anything in the format or in OT
    Layout (and understanding the distinction between the file format and the layout
    handling is also crucial).\r\n\r\nI recommend starting with the material on the
    MS Typography website.\r\n\r\n<em>Is OpenType going to become the standard format
    in the near future putting apart TrueType and PostScript fonts?</em>\r\n\r\nAn
    OpenType font <em>is</em> a TrueType font insofar as it shares the same sfnt table
    structure as other flavours of TrueType. What practically distinguishes the OpenType
    format from TrueType is the <em>optional</em> presence of OpenType Layout tables
    and/or a CFF PostScript outline table. [The format distinction between TT and
    OT is the presece of a 'dsig' table, but this isn't a very practical distinction
    for most users.]\r\n\r\n<em>Will OpenType allow for better typographical usage
    from general users?</em>\r\n\r\nIn many cases, it will effectively enforce better
    typographic usage by improving the default behaviour. So, for example, one can
    expect standard ligatures and contextual alternates to be on by default. Likewise,
    when users select a smallcaps function, there will be a better chance that they
    will get true smallcap glyphs, rather than scaled uppercase letters.\r\n\r\n<em>Will
    the internet benefit from the use of OpenType?</em>\r\n\r\nIt already does for
    the millions of people who access websites in e.g. Arabic, Hindi, Thai, etc. Smart
    font layout is required for the correct shaping of many of the world's writing
    systems. It is important to understand the degree to which the typographic niceties
    that most English-language typographers associate with OpenType are riding on
    the back of software internationalisation and complex script support.\r\n\r\n<em>Will
    most common applications become OpenType savvy?</em>\r\n\r\nYes. In many cases,
    they will become so through system level libraries and services. For instance,
    my browser and e-mail software are already OT savvy when it comes to the complex
    scripts that I work with on a daily basis, and that is simply through utilising
    capabilities that the operating system makes available. As the operating systems
    expose more typographic features, these too will become widely available.\r\n\r\nThe
    biggest problems cases for OpenType adoption are large and very popular programs
    like MS Word, which have a massive legacy code base and backwards compatibility
    commitments. New applications have it easier."

    put aside completely. I predict/guess that OpenType will gain slowly but surely.
    But It could be a long time before it dominates. 10 years or more.\r\n\r\n<cite>Will
    OpenType allow for better typographical usage from general users?<cite>\r\n\r\nNo.
    Good use of type is always going to be a deliberate act bourne of sensitivity
    insight and knowledge. Asking this is like asking if highway medians will make
    people better drivers. Of course not. But the medians make accidents less likely
    and less bad (mostly) when they do happen. So it might seem like you have better
    drivers with medians in place. If the end result is less carnage then that's great.
    Of course accidents still happen and Opentype will not prevent all Typographic
    accidents."

    for customization, but my question is: to what end? What do you hope is the outcome
    of your research? \r\n\r\nI suggest you focus your efforts on both learning more
    about OpenType and also, thinking about the \"to what end\" question...In my case,
    I probably would have never come up with the idea of visualizing linguistic behaviors
    in a font if I had not been serendipitously studying sociolinguistics...\r\n\r\nfeel

  body: "I wrote a piece about OT for Graphic Exchange in 2002. \"Big Thing\" (it's
    in PDF at my site). Phil Baines had something in Eye at the same time. \r\n\r\nI
    think OT is about to break, now, for many reasons.\r\n\r\nFirst will be support
    from Quark 7, still a big force in the graphics industry, despite routine vilification
    at Typophile.\r\n\r\nSecond is \"push\" from type designers enthralled by its
    possibilities. These are folk who started off as grunge mac artists and have followed
    a career trajectory that's become increasingly professional. Their creative output
    is engaging with OT.\r\n\r\nThree is the role of trans-national corporations and
    their support from MS and Adobe -- if you're launching a product in the EU and
    packaging requires Greek (presently a member) and Cyrillic (Ukraine on the wait
    list) blurb, it's no longer good enough just to have optional CE fonts. MS (ClearType
    upcoming) and Adobe (Minion etc.) are really pushing the market by bundling fonts
    with massive language support -- other foundries will have to do likewise -- Peter
    Bilak's Fedra at Typotheque is off and running, and many others (myself included)
    have similar projects under development.\r\n\r\nFour is the penetration of OT
    support in Adobe apps -- they've been plugging away at this and InDesign is now
    well established, and the GaramondPro registration offer is a nice idea, putting
    a premium on the OT format. I should also mention that distributors like Myfonts
    are doing their bit to explain and promote, with their system of icons to indicate
    feature support. \r\n\r\nFive: third time lucky -- after GX and Multiple Master,
    it's about time for a new font format that sticks.\r\n\r\nI could go on, but it
    seems to me that OT is well established, and proceeding on many fronts. The fact
    that it hasn't yet been a huge immediate \"killer app\" is a testament to the
    serious nature of the format -- Unicode and what we once called \"Expert\" typographic
    features. "

    putting apart TrueType and PostScript fonts?</cite>\r\n\r\nBesides agreeing with
    earlier comments, I'd like to point out that there is a big difference between
    three things in terms of what constitutes \"the standard format\":\r\n<ul><li>The
    installed base of fonts, what people have available to work with. Because fonts
    last virtually forever, the installed base will remain overwhelmingly non OpenType
    for a long time.\r\n<li>Which of the fonts they have available people choose to
    actually use. OpenType will do pretty well here, at least among professional designers
    and graphic artists.\r\n<li>What fonts people buy. I think that by the end of
    2006, if not sooner, OpenType fonts will be the majority of fonts being sold.</ul>\r\n\r\n<cite>Will
    OpenType allow for better typographical usage from general users? Will the internet
    benefit from the use of OpenType?</cite>\r\n\r\nI agree with John's comments on
    these issues. Eben is right insofar as the difference won't be overwhelming, but
    it should be noticeable.\r\n\r\n<cite>Will most common applications become OpenType
    savvy?</cite>\r\n\r\nIf \"most common applications\" comprises Microsoft Office,
    key Apple applications, Adobe/Macromedia applications, and QuarkXPress, then the
    answer is clearly \"yes.\" But I think it may be a very long time before your
    average accounting software becomes OpenType savvy.\r\n\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
