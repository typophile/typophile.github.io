  was doing a small poster for a class. What would be appropriate to replicate the
  feel of the typefaces used here?\r\nOther advice for typefaces of similar feel is
  welcome, it's on a sonata by him.\r\n\r\nLike as the waves make towards the pebbled
  shore,\r\n\r\nSo do our minutes hasten to their end,\r\n\r\nEach changing place
  with that which goes before\r\n\r\nIn sequent toil all forwards do contend.\r\n\r\nNativity,
  once in the main of light,\r\n\r\nCrawls to maturity, wherewith, being crowned,\r\n\r\nCrooked
  eclipses 'gainst his glory fight\r\n\r\nAnd Time that gave, doth now his gift confound.\r\n\r\nTime
  doth transfix the flourish set on youth,\r\n\r\nAnd delves the parallels in beauty's
  brow,\r\n\r\nFeeds on the rarities of natures truth,\r\n\r\nAnd nothing stands but
  for his scythe to mow;\r\n\r\nAnd yet, to times, in hope, my verse shall stand,\r\n\r\nPraising
  thy worth, despite his cruel hand. \r\n"

    Marini]], has the same worn down feel and they're free to use!\r\n\r\nOr if you
    have \"some\" money to spare, take a look at the smooth, professional Fell Types
    by the [[http://www.dutchtypelibrary.nl/Fell_rdrct.html|Dutch Type Library]]."
