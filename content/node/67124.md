body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI'm looking at buying a good, versatile serif text/book typeface.
  As my budget is rather limited at the moment I'm looking for a typeface that is
  not to expensive, yet has all the essentials (bold, italic, small caps, old style
  numerals etc) for setting extended text. Would be nice if you had some good pointers
  for me, as the choice is so overwhelming it's hard to know where to start.\r\n\r\nOn
  a related subject: Is there a package of typefaces at a budget price that covers
  a nice range of typefaces, serif, sans, display etc? Unfortunately I'm not a student
  anymore, so that door is closed... :-(\r\n\r\nThanks for your help!"

    that level of service from any company, never mind a digital type foundry. \r\n\r\nEach
    letter along with my little gifts (one was a limited edition letterpress broadside
    and the other was a limited edition letterpress bookmark) arrived on TypeCulture
    letterhead, signed by Mark Jamra personally, with friendly (and different) notes
    each time.\r\n\r\nThe broadside came in a TypeCulture cardboard protective sleeve,
    and I keep both items in it. \r\n\r\nOver the past few years I've made numerous
    font purchases - everywhere from StormType, to Fountain, to Village (though the
    folks at Village were very pleasant to deal with.) TypeCulture stands out in my
    mind as a unique experience.\r\n\r\nOh yeah, and their fonts are great, too.  ;)\r\n\r\n"

    I would love to see a book printed in it though, should be good. Calluna is a

    it's a great typeface; I could even send a copy of a book, if you're interested
    and don't mind reading Italian. If you're after a font package, instead, let me
    suggest you Storm Type Foundry \"Storm Open Library 2.1\", which features great
    revivals of historical fonts like Jannon, Walbaum and Baskerville and some interesting
    contemporary typefaces for the price of just a single family."
