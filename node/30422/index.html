  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi all you typelovers.

Well i'm having a strange problem.
At work we used to work with the .ttf Parisine (from Porchez).
I bought last year the .otf version and from this day on i'm having strange problems.
There i go:

First, i'm working on a 2ghz Core Duo Intel iMac with Mac OSX.4.8.
I removed the .ttf Parisine, so there is just one Parisine active and this is the .otf

What happens is that, let's say i worked on a catalogue, text is set in Parisine .otf, everything's fine...
Then the next day, i open up my document to continue and the text is full of ligatures that i did not want and were not there befor.
Everywhere the ct and st ligatures and on top of this all the dubble o's like in "books" are replaced by a ? in a square.
Hmm does anybody had this befor?
Even if i select all the text and uncheck the ligature option in the characters palette nothing changes.
Sometimes i just close the document and Indesign and just reopen it and everything is fine again but that works like 1/20.

Also i'm not the only one having this problem here at work.

Where can this come from? 

Thanks a lot for any help,

Gilles</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Oki i found following post at Adobes' someone having the same problem as i do:
https://www.adobeforums.com/cgi-bin/webx/.3bc26a5b

And here same problem but no clue:
http://www.listsearch.com/InDesignTalk.lasso?tab1=search&tab2=detail&skip=1&uid=116027

I use Fontbook but as for now i copied the Parisine otf files to 
library/application support/adobe/fonts
rebooted indesign and my document is fine again.

I don't know if this will help permanently or just till the next reboot so i'm always happy to get some hint on what may cause this ligature problem.

Thanks</div>

Search your harddrive for files named: AdobeFntXX.lst

Throw these files away and restart your computer.

If you are still having problems, you might want to contact M. Porchez directly; this might be an issue which he is familiar with, and if it isn't, I'm sure that he would like to know about your experiences.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Village is doing a good suggestion to contact us directly.

But, the main problem I see behind this cache problem, is that Mr "Butter" is not on our list of client for Parisine PTF (OpenType version).

So, we perhaps don't fill out correctly our databases of sales, on this case, it can be good if Mr "Butter" can help on that.

Then, we will be happy to sorted out the problem, what ever it is.

PS. We never sell any TrueType versions of any retail fonts, so Parisine in TTF is a stranger for us…</div>
