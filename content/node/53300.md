    interesting. \r\nI really like it. Maybe they'll adapt it into their official
    logo. I think the current word mark is highly outdated."

  body: It looks like the Windows logo got hit by a truck. What was so bad about the
    original G?

    replaced -- that one only lasted a few months, and justly so.\r\n\r\nI don't think
    this should be incorporated into the wordmark: the wordmark's simplicity is part
    of what makes Google googley!"

  body: "I agree with mr: it's much better than the one it just replaced... that lowercase
    g looked so forlorn on a white background...\r\n\r\nBut I've only noticed the
    new one on Google Maps and Google News, so far. Maybe they are rolling it out
    a little at a time.\r\n\r\n<em>I wanted somebody to bring that up but I didn\u2019t
    think others would find it interesting.</em>\r\n\r\nThis is Typophile. Somebody
    here is bound to find it interesting. :-)"

    all borrowed from Super Mario World :p

  body: YouTube tweaks the favicon too. It's just small change, tho. It was started
