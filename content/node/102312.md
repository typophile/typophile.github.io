  having to do with Japanese abacus and mental arithmetic practice.\r\nIf you google
  \"flash anzan\" (that is, a rather intense form of mental arithmetic practice),
  you will likely see this font used for the numbers.\r\nI chose this for my sample
  because it contains all ten digits. The character that looks like a solidus is really
  the digit 1 (one). I believe that commas, decimal points, and symbols for basic
  arithmetic exist for this font, but as far as I know, it contains no characters
  beyond this.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/japanese_math_font_4381.png]"
