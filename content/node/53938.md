  after digging a bit I saw it was used on an Incredible String Band album:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/scriptyserif-1970s_4624.jpg]\r\n\r\nAlso
  reminiscent of...I don't know...vintage romance novels? title cards for seventies
  chick flicks?\r\n\r\nAny help on ID'ing this or any similar typeface would be sweet.
  thanks!"
