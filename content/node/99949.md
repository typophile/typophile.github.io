  body: "well, i would hope. i understand the concerns but in some cases, how would
    one know that there IS an \"authentic\" version if it can't be found? aside from
    having a lifetime of experience and a font history, some of us look and learn
    through daily experience. if there's some input on how we can positively i.d knockoffs,
    please let me know.\r\n\r\nonly in the most extreme \"can't find it\" cases do
    i look on dafont and other sites. i try to stick with identifont, what the font,
    and whatfontis. the latter seems to be the one more likely to kick out  a \"fake\"
    so i usually take their results and search identifont for similars.\r\n\r\nfor
    some i.d. cases doing a google on the actual subject will lead to the info. perhaps
    finding a pdf from the customer or a better sample that can be more readily used
    for researching."

  body: "Well, this isn't a court of law, but what about: Beyond a reasonable doubt?
    \ :-)\r\n\r\nActually, what am I saying? There's an admission right there:\r\n\"\r\nKingthings
    Frontwards\r\nDaft font based on Times New Roman\r\n\"\r\n\r\nNow, swiping the
    outlines of <em>Times</em> doesn't really warrant making a big stink (just a small
    one) but what I worry about is that once you go down that path, it's unlikely
    you'll stop. And then I look at Serifique for example, and I worry more.\r\n\r\nAll
    I'm saying is: be careful what kind of behavior you indirectly -often unwittingly-
    promote by recommending certain fonts (and designers). When somebody helps you
    figure out that your recommendation might be tainted, keep an open mind about
    it - and err on the side of caution.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\"I claim no copyright
    to this font\"</blockquote>\r\n\r\nOh, that makes it all OK then...\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nWhen
    I made Trajic notRoman* from the actual outlines of Trajan, and publicized it,
    I got dozens of emails wanting to pay money for it. I said no to each and every
    one.\r\n\r\n* http://themicrofoundry.com/ss_trajic.html\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    on the origins of a font. I know you are on a personal crusade, but perhaps your
    time is better spent not visiting this section of Typophile?\r\n\r\nI realize
    that I am only feeding your insufferable nature with this post.\r\n\r\ntm"

  body: "The ID forum is part of Typophile. It's not about me.\r\n\r\nIn turn I would
    actually recommend the opposite to you: spend more time on Typophile's other sections,
    hopefully developing an appreciation for what's really valuable.\r\n\r\nThis might
    however be another opportunity to reiterate this suggestion: since many people
    regularly IDing type don't want to be bothered by ethical considerations, and
    since they virtually never look anywhere except the ID section*, let's somehow
    implement a full and formal separation. If we do that I can guarantee you'll never
    need to suffer my presence again.\r\n\r\n* You can tell because when an ID request
    is placed elsewhere it gets virtually zero response.\r\n\r\nJust to be clear:
    I don't think anybody should get worked up trying to change other individuals;
    but <em>everbody</em> should be concerned with promoting the integrity of a place
    they spend a lot of time frequenting, thinking about the consequences of their
    actions as opposed to simply IDing fonts blindly.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    deemed \"not good enough\" there will be a complaint. and if i don't link at all
    there will be a complaint."

  body: "Jan is entirely correct, on all counts. But of course one's \"best judgement\"
    is -hopefully- in a constant state of refinement: if somebody makes you aware
    of a negative aspect of something, it's both wise and kind to adapt to that reality.\r\n\r\nMerely
    IDing type <em>for its own sake</em> ignores the critical context of the people
    making the things you're IDing. With the \"fun blinders\" on you often end up
    helping/hurting the wrong people.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
