    similar so it's hard to figure out what would be in between...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    \u201Cthe layout of Univers Bold\u201D is supposed to mean.  Silly me."

  body: "Sorry, my English is very bad, I don't know how to exprime myself well! :)\r\n\r\nWe
    make school books and games and our first goal is for people with learning problems.
    Habitually, we use Comic Sans MS for kids books, not a good font but near of kids
    writing. We want to find a font more serious for adults. We use only Bold fonts
    because teachers need to photocopy some pages. \r\n\r\nWe like the letters of
    Mentone, the letters are geometric, near of letters we learn at school, so easy
    to read. Sometimes the G or the F are special in some fonts, but it's not good
    for us. We also like AvantGarde, but the text is too compact with it. \r\n\r\nFor
    Mentone, the space between the words and the sentences is too near. For the space,
    we prefer Univers. Each word is far from each other, we can easily fond a word
    in the text. \r\n\r\nMaybe I have to reformulate my question: I need a font with
    geometric or very simple letters, easy to read in bold and small size, a lot of
    space between each words and good space between each sentence.\r\n\r\nSo, with
    all the fonts, it's hard to find one good. Maybe you have suggestions. Or maybe
    we want something that is not existing :)."

    You can always adjust the spacing yourself (software permitting).\r\n\r\nUsing
    a bold font will not help in photocopying, and may actually become harder to read
    than a normal font as the weight of the strokes increases.\r\n\r\nI also would
    not limit myself to sans serif fonts, even for people with reading difficulties."

    spending more time/money modifying it!\r\n\r\nAvant Garde: Beware, super low readability!\r\n\r\nYou
    might look at the Sassoon fonts. But: handwriting varies between countries.\r\n\r\nA
    good layout program can vary the wordspace independently. But you could also ask
    the designer of Mentone (who actually used to hang out here, but couldn't stand
    yours truly so he left) if he'd be willing to make you a special version (assuming
    his EULA does not allow modification - if it does, <em>and</em> he's not willing
    to do it for you, then somebody like me could do it for a small fee).\r\n\r\nLastly,
    if you have the budget, you can get <em>exactly</em> the font you need, custom-made.

    a special font, so I will try the tip to ajust the space in the program.
