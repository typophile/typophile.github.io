  <BR> <BR> <BR>Any ideas? <BR> <BR>I would like to see how they went about &#34;Stylizing&#34;
  this to look as if it is letterpressed. It&#39;s hard to see fom the scan, but the
  original has just the slightest bit of debossing look to it. <BR> <BR>Good stuff.
  BTW, this is an ad from REALSIMPLE magazine. <BR>hildebrant. <BR> <BR>

  body: The typeface is Caslon Antique and I think the typeface is made to look as
    if it&#39;s been done on an old letterpress.  I tried playing with Illustrator
    effects and the closest effect was one of the glow things. Photoshop probably
    has more ways to do it, and I stopped messing about when I felt I wasn&#39;t getting
    closer. The sample is straight Caslon Antique &#40;no effects&#41;<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/17094.gif"

  body: It looks like the M from the Initials done by William Morris. The first sample
    I found of this was a Japanese &#39;shareware&#39; link, I&#39;d rather not use.
    David Nalle of <a href="http://www.ragnarokpress.com/artype/morris/" target="_blank">Scriptorium</a>
    also has that design among his Ornate Initials, as you can see.

    for future reference.&#41;

  body: The sample is indeed very similar to Caslon Antique, but it&#39;s noticeably
    different in several places, enough to make me suspect that it&#39;s actually
    a free knockoff of Caslon Antique. Sure enough, there&#39;s apparently a Corel
    font called &#34;Casablanca Antique.&#34; The name makes absolutely no sense,
    and I don&#39;t have a PC so I can&#39;t check it, but I&#39;d be willing to bet
    a dollar -- sight unseen -- that Casablanca Antique&#39;s your font, not Caslon
    Antique.

    A perfect match. <BR> <BR>But then so are, I believe, the <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dsgnhaus/caslon-antique/caslon-antique/testdrive.html?s=Honoring%2BCaslon&amp;p=72"
    target="_blank"> FontHaus</a> and <a href="http://www.philsfonts.com/detail.html?sku=PF00001301P2"

    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>Chesh I hope you don&#39;t mind but the ID stays
    what it is,  <BR>as we&#39;re talking free knockoffs here. You okay with that?
    <BR>But kudos anyway for your inquisitive mind and keen eye.

  body: I disagree about the Fonthaus and Phil&#39;s Fonts versions, which, to me,
    look different even from each other. <BR> <BR>And Yves, that&#39;s cool with me.
    You know Americans are more interested in the dollar than in being right. ;&#41;

  body: I agree that all the versions of Caslon Antique we have seen have had some
    slight variations from one another.  Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but isn&#39;t
    there some variation within the sample we were given too? If I understood the
    &#39;distressed stamp&#39; effect, it involves using some noise to disrupt some
    of the font outline, or else this sample is truly not made from a font. &#40;Caslon
    Antique exists as a metal type, I believe.&#41; <BR> <BR>It seems unecessary to
    quibble about exactly which of the &#39;Caslon Antique&#39;  &#40;by any other
    name it comes out to the same thing&#41; versions could have been used. I think
    the person who asked the question was satisfied long ago. BTW, we have yet to
    see an actual sample of the one that is supposed to be the exact match, and the
    person who made that statement has been corrected about his opinion that the FontHaus
    and Phil&#39;s Fonts versions are identical too. <BR> <BR>Can we just move on?
    I&#39;m an American, and I&#39;m interested in being right &#40;as my wife can
    tell you&#41;, but I think we&#39;ve answered the question we were asked.  <BR>
    <BR>Peace.

    not going for the easy way out. I consider this  <BR>thread solved.
