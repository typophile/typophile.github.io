body: I&#39;ve been lurking here for over a year and posting for a little less than
  that, and I&#39;ve got to say I&#39;ve learned quite a bit from just watching the
  discussions here, and am constantly impressed by some of the work posted here...
  and even when there are arguments, those are almost always handled in such a respectful
  manner that makes certain design boards seem like a war zone &#40;BJ and Hildebrant
  know what I&#39;m talking about&#41;. <BR> <BR>I think it&#39;s about time Typophile
  had its own appreciation thread - as a &#40;sort of&#41; newbie, I&#39;d like to
  thank all you guys and girls for making this board so great.

  body: 'Amen. <BR> <BR>Typophile is indespensible on two levels: <BR>1. Type education.
    Amazing knowledge, resources, critiques, encouragement, ID skills, new designs,
    old masters. I&#39;m sponging it up everytime I browse. <BR>2. Meeting other people
    with font neurosis. I don&#39;t know how many folks who contribute to typophile
    are freelancers or self-employed, but it seems like quite a few '

  body: I feel so thankful to the typophile community because of their open and helpful
    disposal. I could not have found such a good guidance and support, specially belonging
    to a country with no type culture. I hope I can make significative contributions
    to this community soon.

    like I can read the pulse of the craft, and even if that&#39;s only partly true
    it&#39;s worth a lot. Plus all the selfless effort people put into it keeps me
    optimistic! <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    this is the single most notable thing, and I haven&#39;t totally figured it out
    yet. Could it be just a matter of having provided for a graphical medium &#40;like
    in the critiques&#41;? How much of Typophile&#39;s value is visual, and how much
    of it is conceptual/textual? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: 'Re: replacing the type lists. <BR> <BR>I think it&#39;s mostly a matter of
    focus. An email list is like one endless thread &#40;like the shoutbox&#41;. It
    can be useful and people can interact, but a forum is much more scalable. Instead
    of one conversation -- that might limit an audience or dilute a topic -- there
    are many conversations. So it can accommodate a more diverse audience who may
    be more selective about what they want to read and/or post.'

  body: That&#39;s the way I see it, too. On the lists, you had to sift  <BR>through
    every single message. It was like having only one  <BR>channel. Here, it&#39;s
    like cable tv. If there&#39;s an area you just  <BR>aren&#39;t interested in,
    you can easily ignore it and concentrate  <BR>on the areas you <i>are</i> interested
    in. I mostly hang out  <BR>in certain forums here, but sampling others often.
    If it gets  <BR>interesing, you can always just jump in. It&#39;s all very  <BR>convenient.
    Having the ability to easily view graphics helps  <BR>a lot, too.
