body: "I'm searching for some kind of training in Sydney on drawing letters. Whether
  that's a workshop/course, a book or some website, I don't know. I know it's sort
  of all about practice, but my drawing technique has fallen behind since I'd stopped
  drawing for a while now, and I guess I want to get in the routine of practicing,
  but I don't know where to start. Can anyone direct me?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nP"
