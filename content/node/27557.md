  Specimen pool</a> there is now a Flickr group for pictures of fonts in use: http://www.flickr.com/groups/fonts-in-use/pool/\r\n\r\nThe
  best thing about it is that it is not only usable within Flickr, but the image pool
  can also be used by any website that supports RSS inclusion. A foundry website could
  use the pool to collect images of their fonts in use; Typophile.com could use it
  to add images of fonts to the wiki articles and so on and so forth.\r\n\r\nSee examples
  of the dynamic RSS inclusion at Typografie.info <a href=\"http://www.typografie.info/typowiki/index.php?title=ClearviewHwy\">here</a>
  or <a href=\"http://www.typografie.info/typowiki/index.php?title=Trajan_%28Schrift%29\">here</a>.\r\n\r\nAnd
  feel free to add your images of fonts in use!\r\n\r\nRalf "
