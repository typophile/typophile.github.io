  laying out a book for a client, the body text of the text will be 'Korinna' http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-korinna/,
  now between all the chapters there will be excerpts from a journal/diary, and the
  client wants a handwriting font that's legible, now I know there are alot of handwriting
  fonts out there but I need something really professional and nice, and also it should
  have a regular font + italic.\r\n\r\nThanx for all your help until now\r\n\r\nSruly"

  body: "There are very few handwriting fonts with both upright and italic versions.
    If you need italic for emphasis, I suggest using a bolder weight instead. Here
    are a variety of <a href=\"http://fontfeed.com/archives/contemporary-handwriting-fonts/\">professional
    handwriting fonts</a>, many of which have multiple weights.\r\n\r\nIt may be too
    late to make a change, but I don't think Karinna is a wise choice for body text.
    It's far too idiosyncratic and will distract readers. If you can tell me a little
    more about the book, I could offer some appropriate alternatives."

  body: "Thanx stephen for your info. The book will be about a girl that has cerebral
    palsy but her brain is very sharp etc. and it's not too late because I didn't
    start the typesetting process yet. Why do u say that korinna won't be such a good
    choice, if I recall I saw quite a few books with this typeface? what font would
    u suggest?\r\n\r\nAlso I saw the link that you provided about the script lettering,
    so what would you suggest for a font? but remember there MUST be italics too.\r\n\r\nThanx
    for your help\r\nSruly"
