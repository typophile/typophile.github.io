  body: "IMO This is excellent work. I wish i could help you with a little constructive
    criticism but i am still lost for words. May be you could add single guillemets
    if you haven't done that allready. Per haps you could try out a little more prominent
    cedilla, but that's peanuts.\r\n\r\nbest regards"

  body: "Good show. I would only say the numeral 2 is narrow and lacking in grace.\r\nAnd
    you'll want to generally improve accent placement; acute is too far to the left
    in most cases. Shape of circumflex and caron may be too shallow."

  body: "Hi 37DMK and cerulean, many thnks for your feedback.\r\nI'm now posting a
    new pdf, (hadn't seen the question of nr 2), [[www.satori.pt/clientes/boosterspecimen.pdf
    ]] i think now can see how the font is working.\r\nI would like some help in designing
    the other weights, im using Glyphs, and i would like to try a bolder weight, and
    use a similar filter to \"expand stroke\", to see how much thickness i want.\r\nThe
    offset path in Glyphsapp, creates me a grey area outside the shape, someone could
    me help with this matter. \r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance"

  body: "Hi Satori,\r\n\r\nnice font! I think the {m} could be a bit narrower, it's
    very light at the moment.\r\n\r\nI know your problem; Glyphs is by far my favorite
    font editor, but it has some shortcomings in path-expansion functionality. I've
    gone as far as exporting my open-path font from Glyphs to FontForge, manually
    re-opening all the paths, using the Expand Stroke function, and exporting the
    shapes back to Glyphs."

  body: "Hello Satori\r\nI am truly sorry that it took me so long to get back at your
    thread. I never used glyphs before, but i have seen a picture of how to make font-weights
    in typography class so i was looking all over the internet to find that same picture.
    No luck. \u2013 then i decided to make one of my own. Basically i wanted to point
    out how you can create several thicknesses without braking the capital height
    or the baseline or having the x-height jumping around too much.\r\n\r\ni hope
    that helps (to me it was a great help to see how other people solved that problem):\r\n\r\n<a
