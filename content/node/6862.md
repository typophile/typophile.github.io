  body: 'On a general note: I quite like it. <BR> <BR>Haven&#39;t got much time right
    now, but please do check the setting of your body copy: there&#39;s some nasty
    gaps in the lines of text. I&#39;m posting an image to show you what I mean. <BR>
    <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/4989.gif" alt="This
    is what I mean"> <BR> <BR>The easiest way would be to ditch QuarkXPress and lay-out
    the piece in InDesign. ;&#41; <BR> <BR>The choice of type is sound, but I&#39;m
    wondering if the illustration doesn&#39;t refer to Japanese manga a bit too much.
    I don&#39;t know what the Brits think of this? Anyone?'

  body: 'Please don&#39;t let me misunderstood: the ilustration does rock, but I was
    just wondering how much it was influenced by manga, and that&#39;s why I asked
    a second opinion by our Brit colleagues. <BR> <BR>Anyways, your comment was way
    past your bedtime, Stephen. I really do cherish my 9 hours of impunity. Wouldn&#39;t
