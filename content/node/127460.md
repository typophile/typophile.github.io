body: "Hello! First post, and I hope its one you can sink your teeth into a little
  bit. (For context, this is for the sake of a design... I am not just looking for
  something to use).\r\n\r\nI have been unable to find examples of a STRESSED SERIF
  typeface (or many typefaces at all) that include a squared capital A with tapered
  legs. I don't just mean a flat point, I mean a small crossbar at the top. (images
  attached) Maybe I am Googling the wrong terminology or something, but Identifont
  also offered nothing useful. A square-top 4 or a square-bottom V would be similarly
  interesting/useful.\r\n\r\n1) Do you know of any digitized fonts that include such
  a glyph?\r\n2) If not digitized, any nice examples in the wild? I would kill for
  one elegant reference point.\r\n3) In general, any tips about designing that glyph
  so it doesn't feel like a brick? \r\n\r\nAll input is much appreciated!\r\n\r\n"

  body: If I remember correctly, some older versions of Linux Libertine had this kind
    of A, at least in the smallcaps. I have not checked if it still exists in the
    latest version. Not even sure if LL counts as a stressed-serif face.

    that flat-top 'A' \u2013 in the small-caps, as I thought. The '4' is a tad unusual,
    too, with a curved diagonal."
