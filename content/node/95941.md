body: "Hello Typophiles,\r\nI noticed some days ago Fontsite Inc. released a font
  using a name already used by another typographer I know. Looking further, we realised
  the Fontsite\u2019s font is a copy of Excoffon\u2019s Mistral (!)\r\nIn the meantime
  Fontsite slightly changed the font name and re-edited here \r\nhttp://www.fontspring.com/fonts/fontsite/malacca\r\nLooking
  deeper in the list of proposed fonts http://www.fontspring.com/search?q=fontsite+inc\r\nis
  seems most of them are copies.\r\nOr I am wrong?"

    Cavanaugh's justification for the FontSite fonts</a> says a lot:\r\n\r\n<cite>You
    have to keep in mind that holding a copyright does not preclude one from entering
    into licensing and distribution arrangements as many companies did with URW.</cite>\r\n\r\nSean
    firmly maintains that he has been granted a distribution license to many URW/ATF/Softmaker
    fonts when he was employed by SoftMaker/ATF.  And I remember buying his book when
    I graduated college in the mid nineties that included many of these fonts in the
    jacket CD. He's been distributing them for a long time.\r\n\r\nHave you considered
    contacting FontSite and asking directly?"

    the first one the same (Mistral > Malaga > Malacca ; Opus > Optima etc).\r\n"

  body: I'm not sure what you mean. Looks like Malaga was the name Softmaker gave
    it's version of Mistral. Perhaps FontSite needed to differentiate from them.

    in this case, and as I didn't find fonsite listed on fontshop nor myfonts, I wondered
    what\u2019s going on ;-)"
