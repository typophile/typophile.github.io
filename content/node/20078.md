  Font Development Kit for OpenType (AFDKO) is a freely-distributed set of libraries
  and [[Python]] bindings by [[Adobe]] for working with [[OpenType]] fonts. Available
  for Windows and Mac OS. Comes with a suite of command-line tools, and is also used
  by [[FontLab]] and [[TypeTool]], among others, for supporting some of OpenType's
  more sophisticated features.\r\n\r\n<strong>URL</strong>\r\nhttp://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/\r\n\r\n<strong>Presentation
  at Robothon'09</strong>\r\nhttp://blip.tv/file/1908888\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n<strong>INSTALLATION</strong>\r\n<em>Both
  the command-line tools and the FontLab macros are self-contained and run independently
  of each other.</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>AFDKO command-line tools</strong> <em>on Mac
  OS X</em>\r\n<strong><code>1.</code></strong> Download and decompress the AFDKO
  package.\r\n<strong><code>2.</code></strong> You should now have a folder named
  'FDK'. Move it to where you want.\r\n<strong><code>3.</code></strong> Open a Terminal
  window (Terminal is located in <code>/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app</code>)\r\n<strong><code>4.</code></strong>
  Open the 'FDK' folder and locate the file named 'FinishInstallOSX'\r\n<strong><code>5.</code></strong>
  Select the 'FinishInstallOSX' file, drag & drop it on the Terminal window, and press
  the 'Return' key.\r\nIf FinishInstallOSX complains that it does not have permission
  to make the changes, type 'sudo ' (no quotes and keep the final space) before doing
  step&nbsp;5. This command will prompt you for the system administrator password,
  which will allow FinishInstallOSX to complete its work.\r\n<strong><code>6.</code></strong>
  Close the Terminal window (Command+W).\r\n\r\nIf all went well the FDK should now
  be ready to run. To test it, do the following:\r\n<strong><code>A.</code></strong>
  Open a Terminal window.\r\n<strong><code>B.</code></strong> Type 'autohint -h' (no
  quotes) and hit 'Return'. This should give you the Help information about the Autohint
  tool.\r\n\r\nIf you get an '<code>OSError: [Errno 17] File exists</code>', go to
  <code>/Users/(your_username)/bin</code>, delete the symbolic link named 'FDK', and
  run FinishInstallOSX again.\r\n\r\nIf you get a message saying '<code>-bash: autohint:
  command not found</code>', do the following additional steps:\r\n<strong><code>+1.</code></strong>
  Open a new Terminal window and type <code>pico .profile</code>\r\n<strong><code>+2.</code></strong>
  You should now have the '.profile' file opened in pico, and see some lines that
  look like this: <code>PATH=${PATH}:\"/Users/your_username/bin/\"</code>\r\n<strong><code>+3.</code></strong>
  Select those lines, copy them, and close the file (Ctrl+X).\r\n<strong><code>+4.</code></strong>
  Type <code>pico .bash_profile</code>\r\n<strong><code>+5.</code></strong> Paste
  the lines copied in step +3.\r\n<strong><code>+6.</code></strong> Close the file
  (Ctrl+X), answering \u201CY\u201D to save the changes.\r\n<strong><code>+7.</code></strong>
  Close the Terminal window.\r\n<strong><code>+8.</code></strong> Open a new Terminal
  window. Typing 'autohint -h' should now work, as well as all the other AFDKO command
  line tools.\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n<strong>AFDKO
  FontLab macros</strong> <em>on Mac OS X</em>\r\n<strong><code>0.</code></strong>
  Quit FontLab, in case it is running.\r\n<strong><code>1.</code></strong> Locate
  the 'Macros' folder in your FontLab installation. The path to it should be something
  like\r\n<code>/Users/(your_username)/Library/Application&nbsp;Support/FontLab/Studio&nbsp;5/Macros</code>\r\nIf
  there is no 'Macros' folder, create one on that location.\r\n<strong><code>2.</code></strong>
  Download and decompress the AFDKO package.\r\n<strong><code>3.</code></strong> You
  should now have a folder named 'FDK'.\r\n<strong><code>4.</code></strong> Open a
  Terminal window (Terminal is located in <code>/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app</code>),
  and type 'cd ' (no quotes and keep the final space).\r\n<strong><code>5.</code></strong>
  Select the 'FDK' folder, drag & drop it on the Terminal window, and press the 'Return'
  key.\r\n<strong><code>6.</code></strong> Type 'cd Tools/FontLab' (no quotes) and
  hit 'Return'.\r\n<strong><code>7.</code></strong> Still in the Terminal window,
  type 'python installFontLabMacros.py ' (no quotes and keep the final space).\r\n<strong><code>8.</code></strong>
  Select the 'Macros' folder from step 1, drag & drop it on the Terminal window, and
  press the 'Return' key.\r\n\r\nIf all went well, you should see a bunch of lines
  in the Terminal window that start with '<code>Copied:</code>'. The AFDKO FontLab
  macros are now installed, and the 'FDK' folder can be deleted.\r\n\r\nIf you get
  lines that say '<code>Failed to copy file (...) IOError: [Errno 13] Permission denied:
  (...)</code>', it's because the AFDKO FontLab macros were previously installed.
  To install them again you'll need to remove the old files.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n<strong>AFDKO
  command-line tools</strong> <em>on Windows XP</em>\r\n<strong><code>1.</code></strong>
  Download and decompress the AFDKO package.\r\n<strong><code>2.</code></strong> You
  should now have a folder named 'FDK'. Move it to where you want (e.g. <code>C:\\FDK</code>).
  <em>In case you put the FDK folder inside another folder, make sure that the folder
  name does *not* have spaces. Therefore, don't put it inside the 'Program Files'
  folder, for example.</em>\r\n<strong><code>3.</code></strong> Open the 'FDK' folder,
  proceed to the 'Tools' folder and continue to the 'win' folder. The Address field
  should contain something like '<code>C:\\FDK\\Tools\\win</code>' (assuming the 'FDK'
  folder was moved to the location suggested in step 2).\r\n<strong><code>4.</code></strong>
  Select and copy the contents of the Address field.\r\n<strong><code>5.</code></strong>
  Open the Control Panel (Start Menu > Settings > Control Panel)\r\n<strong><code>6.</code></strong>
  Locate 'System' and open it. You should now have a new window named 'System Properties'.\r\n<strong><code>7.</code></strong>
  Select the tab named 'Advanced'.\r\n<strong><code>8.</code></strong> Press the 'Environment
  Variables' button.\r\n<strong><code>9.</code></strong> In the 'User variables for
  <em>your_username</em>' field, scroll down until you see one entry named 'PATH'
  (or 'Path' or 'path'). If you find one, go to step&nbsp;A1, otherwise go to step&nbsp;B1.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><code>A1.</code></strong>
  Select the entry named 'PATH' and click on the 'Edit' button below that area. You
  should now have a new window named 'Edit User Variable'.\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><code>A2.</code></strong>
  Select the 'Variable value' field and move the cursor all the way to the end, i.e.
  all the way to the right. (Beware that the contents of the 'Variable value' might
  be too long and appear trimmed)\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><code>A3.</code></strong>
  Once at the end, type a semicolon (;) and paste-in the contents from step&nbsp;4.\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><code>A4.</code></strong>
  Click on the 'OK' button.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><code>B1.</code></strong>
  Click on the 'New' button (top one). You should now have a new window named 'New
  User Variable'.\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><code>B2.</code></strong> In the 'Variable
  name' field, type 'PATH'. (no quotes)\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><code>B3.</code></strong>
  In the 'Variable value' filed, paste-in the contents from step&nbsp;4.\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><code>B4.</code></strong>
  Click on the 'OK' button.\r\n\r\n<strong><code>10.</code></strong> Click on the
  'OK' button again. ('Environment Variables' window)\r\n<strong><code>11.</code></strong>
  Click on the 'OK' button once more. ('System Properties' window)\r\n\r\nIf all went
  well the FDK should now be ready to run. To test it, do the following:\r\n<strong><code>A.</code></strong>
  Open a Command Prompt window. (Start Menu > Run... > cmd.exe)\r\n<strong><code>B.</code></strong>
  Type 'autohint -h' (no quotes) and hit 'Return'. This should give you the Help information
  about the Autohint tool.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n<strong>AFDKO
  FontLab macros</strong> <em>on Windows XP</em>\r\n<em>You must have Python installed
  before you proceed. For information on how to install Python, go to the <a href=\"http://www.fontlab.com/python/\">FontLab
  Python page</a>.</em>\r\n<strong><code>0.</code></strong> Quit FontLab, in case
  it is running.\r\n<strong><code>1.</code></strong> Locate the 'Macros' folder in
  your FontLab installation. The path to it should look something like\r\n<code>C:\\Documents
  and Settings\\your_username\\My&nbsp;Documents\\FontLab\\Studio5\\Macros</code>\r\nIf
  there is no 'Macros' folder, create one on that location.\r\n<strong><code>2.</code></strong>
  Download and decompress the AFDKO package.\r\n<strong><code>3.</code></strong> You
  should now have a folder named 'FDK'.\r\n<strong><code>4.</code></strong> Open a
  Command Prompt window (Start Menu > Run... > cmd.exe), and type 'cd ' (no quotes
  and keep the final space).\r\n<strong><code>5.</code></strong> Select the 'FDK'
  folder, drag & drop it on the Command Prompt window, and press the 'Return' key.\r\n<strong><code>6.</code></strong>
  Type 'cd Tools/FontLab' (no quotes) and hit 'Return'.\r\n<strong><code>7.</code></strong>
  Still in the Command Prompt window, type 'python installFontLabMacros.py ' (no quotes
  and keep the final space).\r\n<strong><code>8.</code></strong> Select the 'Macros'
  folder from step 1, drag & drop it on the Command Prompt window, and press the 'Return'
  key.\r\n\r\nIf all went well, you should see a bunch of lines in the Command Prompt
  window that start with '<code>Copied:</code>'. The AFDKO FontLab macros are now
  installed, and the 'FDK' folder can be deleted.\r\n\r\nOn step 7, if you have Python
  installed but still get a message that says '<code>'python' is not recognized as
  an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.</code>', locate
  the folder where Python is installed, and add that folder's path to the 'PATH' User
  Variable.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n<strong>Related
