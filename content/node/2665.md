  body: I have always loved the crane logo though I never cared for the placement
    of the JAL in it. The 2 newest seem so homogenized and the 1950s...well the 1950s
    one I just don&#39;t know what to say. <BR> <BR>Jon

    is behind the redesign &#40;as well as the previous brand they did in 1989&#41;.  <BR>More

    <BR>&#34;Landor&#39;s Solution <BR>The new JAL mark reaches dynamically to the
    sky. It is derived from the motif of a rising sun, one of the best known icons
    of Japan. The mark is drawn in a modern way, is reflected in the red sun on the
    tail of the aircraft, and is set on a creamy parchment colored background reminiscent
    of handmade Japanese paper.&#34;'

  body: Alex, That justification for the mark by Landor sounds like so much hog wash.
    I agree with Tanya, just because you can make a good gradient, that isn&#39;t
    enough of a reason to use one.

    design outfit needs a Hogwashing Department to make their high fees seem worth
    it. And I believe Landor&#39;s people could host an entire conference on the fine
    art of porcine lavage. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: 'God, what a load of crap-o-la. I think the 50s logo, while a bit militaristic
    somehow &#40;and a bit Enterprise-y also, still looks best. Simple and straightforward.
    The crane is nice, reminds me too much of the basic idea behind the Lufthansa
    logo, which is better executed. The new logo looks terrible, like a twisted piece
    of sweets &#40;we have a kind of laquorice here that looks similar&#41;.  <BR>
    <BR>And gradients aren&#39;t only a major technical problem they also look like
    s&#42;&#42;&#42;. It&#39;s the return of the 80s Corel Draw look, ladies and gentlemen... '

  body: Daniel, I completly agree with you and Tanya, I just posted the Landor reference
    because I always find it interesting how companies &#34;explain&#34; their design
    to the client/general public. I think it happens so often nowadays and the explanations
    are usually so vague that you could apply them to just about anything. My problem
    is that they&#39;re trying to elevate this design to some other realm, I mean,
    &#34;...derived from the motif of the rising sun...The mark is drawn in a modern
    way...,&#34; are they serious? Like HD said, it looks like a candy cane.

  body: 'The rising sun symbol was an empire symbol and its not something that the
    Japanese should be proud of &#40;Naking anyone&#41;. I digress, I met one of the
    designers of the Japanese Zero when I was 15, his name was Dr.Akira Okya he was
    born on one of the most northern islands of Japan and the people from this Island
    tend to be very tall, he was 6&#39;7&#34; or 6&#39;9&#34;. One of the requirements
    of a designer of that period was they had to try out their own inventions. So
    he was stuffed into the back of a Zero and taken on its maiden voyage. He said
    it was the scarest ride of his life. '

  body: I loved that old crane logo. My Mom lifted a spoon from an in-flight meal
    back in the 70&#39;s and I, in turn, lifted it from her house when I moved out.
    Just for that old logo. Classy!
