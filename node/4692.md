  body: The font is Parchment. Copyright shows PhotoLettering, Type Solutions and
    Microsoft. I doubt that you can buy it anywhere by itself. It came bundled with
    <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/font.asp?FID=132&amp;FNAME=Parchment&amp;FVER=1.05"
    target="_blank"> these older Microsoft applications</a>. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/35541.gif"
