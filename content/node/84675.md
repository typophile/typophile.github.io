body: "(Hopefully I've posted this in the right section...)\r\n\r\nI'm putting together
  a website, and I thought I'd give using the @font-face feature a whirl, to allow
  me to embed some non-standard typefaces. My initial efforts to get this working
  are using ITC American Typewriter, font-squirrelled for a cross-compatible webkit,
  and embedded in my website, as instructed, thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n@font-face {\r\n  font-family:
  'AmericanTypewriterBold';\r\n  src: url('fonts/americantypewriterstd-bold-webfont.eot');\r\n
  \ src: url('fonts/americantypewriterstd-bold-webfont.eot?iefix') format('eot'),\r\n
  \      \t url('fonts/americantypewriterstd-bold-webfont.woff') format('woff'),\r\n
  \        url('fonts/americantypewriterstd-bold-webfont.ttf') format('truetype'),\r\n
  \        url('fonts/americantypewriterstd-bold-webfont.svg#webfont') format('svg');\r\n
  \   font-weight: bold;\r\n    font-style: normal;\r\n}\r\n\r\nI works. But. It looks
  pretty shitty. I've also tried using it on a different face (clarendon, which I
  don't think is licensed to be used with @font-face, but I'm just at the point of
  playing rather than finalising anything at the moment...), which looks a bit better,
  but American Typewriter looks especially bad/different to how it should... Apart
  from being a bit unclean, it renders heavier and tracks closer together than it
  should. Oddly though it renders really nicely on my iphone, in spite of looking
  rubbish in chrome/safari on my macbook.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions and/or advice on
  the subject? Many thanks!\r\n\r\n"

  body: Okay, so licensing issues aside (which admittedly I've not looked hard enough
    into the implications of yet), what's the difference between the webfont that
    you have linked to on fonts.com and the webfonts that I've embedded using the
    @font-face function? Even looking at the preview render on fonts.com it's not
    as smooth as the iphone render of my embedded typewriter webkit, and certainly
    not as smooth as the display in Illustrator or similar... Anyone able to provide
    any background on discrepancies between browser/output/etc?

  body: "Different combinations of browsers and OS and font settings (font format,
    font smoothing settings and hinting information) produce very different results.
    \r\n\r\nIn short:\r\n\r\nFor body copy to look good (sharp, readable) across browsers
    you need a well hinted (see end of paragraph) font with truetype curves. The worst
    environment is typically Win XP with default settings and non-IE browsers: extremely
    few fonts hold up here. Most web font services serve truetype curves, but the
    hinting quality (code helping to interpret curves as pixels on screen) varies
    wildly. In this case the good ones are far between because hinting is such a time
    consuming task.\r\n\r\nFor headlines to look good (smooth) across browsers, you
    need a web font with postscript curves and in some cases good postscript hinting.
    These are not commonly available yet, but Typekit has begun serving them for at
    least some fonts. Again, Windows is a causing trouble and doesn't support the
    use of postscript curves until IE9, so you'll need a font with truetype curves
    (.eot)  as a backup, and it will look jagged! This backup should also have some
    light y-direction hinting (too specific for you, but this is for example the level
    of hinting typically served by Fontshop)."

  body: "Thanks! I think I just about understand most of that...\r\n\r\nSo in short:\r\n\r\n*
    Webfonts are still a bit hit and miss whatever your approach, due to different
    browsers/operating systems/combinations of both...\r\n\r\n* At this point in time
    there is no completely failsafe method of getting your font to appear perfectly
    on all systems..?"

  body: "Correct. With a little work you can get decent headlines in most cases. With
    a lot of work you can get decent text in most cases, but what constitutes decent
    text is not the same in all environments. And if \"most cases\" is acceptable
    to you is another discussion altogether.\r\n\r\nFor now this work needs to be
    done by the type designer. In the future, we'll most likely have better rendering
    engines that take care of the problem.\r\n\r\nThere are some good webfonts out
    there, you just have to look for them!"
