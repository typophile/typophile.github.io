  pairs and the information is compiled into the OpenType kern feature\u2026 and you
  happen to copy and paste a non key glyph over a glyph that is marked with the red
  'key glyph' mark\u2026 does anything actually change?\r\n\r\nI imagine nothing would
  change being that all the kerning and class information is already compiled but
  I'm still curious about this. I'd hate to 'update kern feature' and re-compile and
  have things change\u2026 It doesn't look like there's a quick way to re-tag a key
  glyph after it changes either\u2026 any thoughts?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nMike"

  body: "Mike, \r\n\r\nin FontLab Studio 5, to make sure nothing changes, you should
    have a \"kern\" feature generated in the OpenType panel, and also all the classes
    imported into the lower-right part of the OpenType panel (using <em>Import FontLab
    Classes</em> from the OpenType panel flyout menu). Only then you can dump or freely
    rearrange your classes in the Classes panel. \r\n\r\nOf course once you've imported
    the classes into the OpenType panel (i.e. converted them from the FontLab syntax
    into AFDKO syntax), in Preferences / General Options / Unicode and OpenType, disable
    <em>Add all glyph classes to OpenType feature definition code</em>, and in Preferences
    / Generating OpenType & TrueType / Kerning, disable <em>Generate OpenType kern
    feature if it is undefined or outdated</em>. "

    really only occur when moving on from my finished 'master' so to speak and working
    on other weights/variants, cutting/pasting and sorting through things where I
    worry some unwanted change could occur)"
