body: "I'm currently designing a product catalog that contains a lot of tables. I'm
  curious if anyone has any thoughts on how fractions should be vertically aligned
  within a table. I've always tended to gravitate towards right-justification for
  numerals, but I'm wondering if it might be more effective/look better to align fractions
  to the slash.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Depending on the typeface you're using, there may be specifically-designed
    fractions, which may solve the alignment issue - if you're using an OpenType,
    it may be worth a hunt through the glyphs.\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, there's nothing
    in Bringhurst or Hart's about aligning fractions against the solidus, however
    Hart's does have a useful section on tables that discusses when to align numerals
    against the column heading or also with the final digit or decimal point (when
    the data is related or not). Using that rule of aligning decimal points, it could
    be reasoned that the same would apply with aligning against the solidus in large
    numbers (no pun intended) of fractions, preserving the vertical flow.\r\n\r\nHope
    that helps."

  body: "thanks for your help JDL - much appreciated. Bringhurst was (and tends to
    always be) my first reference. going to have to get a hold of Hunt's book. could
    I get a title for that?\r\n\r\nI attached an image of one of the tables I've constructed
    - perhaps this will help visualize what my words can't. \r\n\r\nI am using the
    fraction formatting specific to the typeface. maybe the larger issue is how to
    align the five sub-columns within the \"DIMENSIONS\" column (the three dimensions
    and the two \"x\" that go between them). as you can see, some of the figures really
    vary in length, which makes it really challenging to develop any sort of alignment
    parameters for controlling these variables.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TABLE_4019.jpg]\r\n\r\nthanks

  body: "In the absence of a visible decimal point, align the ones place. In most
    situations this will allow you to align the solidus as well, but you can't count
    on that if you get a big numerator like 15/16.\r\n\r\nIt is all about organizing
    information so that it can be quickly understood. If someone is looking through
    a big list for parts that are 10\" long or longer, numbers that have been pushed
    a whole figure width to the left will be unwelcome distractions."

    the first \"at a glance\" categorization that is most relevant to the reader is
    between figures that are integers and those that are part of fractions. \r\nThe
    way you have it now is like flush righting 1.3 and 1.03\r\n\r\nAlso, you should

    detail: I'm impressed that you aren't using dumb quotes for inch marks, but what
    you have look more like Hungarian umlauts than inch marks. Are there proper inch

    be more space before the dash?"

    right about the space before the dash. That dimension refers to the thread size
    on the hub of these wheels. This format is apparently the standard for the industry.

    As Nick suspected, you've got the Hungarian umlaut. Probably your best bet in

    for tools companies, which contained tables like this with fractions and inch
    marks. That gave me an appreciation for this kind of \"technical\" typography.\r\n\r\nIt's
    not the sort of thing that gets much respect in the design community, but it's
    the real deal.\r\n\r\nBased on that experience as a typographer, I've been putting
    a Fractions feature in all my fonts since OpenType, but have only put proper inch
    marks in the Modern Suite fonts. Frankly, it doesn't seem worth the effort\u2014primarily
    because they're so hard to locate in the glyph palette that I doubt people would
    use them. For serifed fonts, it's easier to get them from the Symbol font. \r\n\r\nI
    did briefly entertain the idea of rendering all my dumb quotes (quotedbl) angled,
    so they would perform both as inch marks, and as an admonition to typographers
    to set proper curly quotes\u2014but realized that wouldn't be very user-friendly."
