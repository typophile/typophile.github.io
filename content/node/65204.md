body: "i felt silly when asked to ID this, but it just doesn't match up to very much
  as far as i've found. The hook on the J could be custom, but the whole logo/type
  is handled so generically that i didn't believe that.\r\n\r\nName: \"Jiffi Stop\"\r\n\r\n-hook
  on the uppercase J (maybe custom)\r\n-short tops on the lowercase f\r\n-inside of
  uppercase O not perfectly circular\r\n-uppercase T elements totally vertical (before
  skew/ital)\r\n\r\nany ideas? (Thanks in advance!)\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jiffi_4045.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jiffi2_3482.jpg]\r\n\r\n(this
  just smacks of something pretty obvious to you pros, but im in the dark :\\)"

  body: "I'm thinking it's probably a font, rather than a completely custom job. A
    custom job would never have passed up on the opportunity for an FFI ligature!
    \ It is likely, however, that the letters got a few tweaks along the logo design
    path.\r\n\r\nBeton is very close. <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/families/geometric_slabserif_712_extra_bold/\">Geometric
    Slabserif 712 from Bitstream</a> is another close one, but I have yet to find
    an oblique.\r\n\r\nIf you'll indulge the diversion, here are a few products that
    didn't pass up the chance to class up their act by sneaking in a 3-letter ligature.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jiffylube_5466.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Jiffy_Pop_3577.jpg]"
