body: 'Hello, <BR> <BR>Well, please don&#39;t look for what I previously posted, I
  have learnt alot since then, and my typeface has made many developments. This is
  my first typeface. I won&#39;t go into where it came from because it has made such
  a drastic evolution that almost nothing of the original design remains. In fact,
  absolutely nothing. <BR> <BR>It has never really had any direction; I have just
  based it on some classical proportions and adapted to suit. I can see that I am
  having alot of problems with weightings &#40;largely due to its mono-weight sans-serif
  beginnings&#41;, but what of the general &#34;look&#34; of the face? Is there anything
  that really sticks out? <BR> <BR>It&#39;s sort of a semi-serif-nearing-some-kind-of-optima-type-look
  at the moment. <BR> <BR>... <BR>Well, go for it I guess. <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR> <BR>-

  body: The S feels a little off balance. Perhaps the bottom half needs to widen out
    a little more. And the A thins out a little on the top. Look at it&#39;s peak
    compared to the middle of the W.

  body: I don&#39;t think the lower bowl of B works well -- the way the upper one
    intrudes makes me shiver... <BR>The D is somehow obese, compared to the rest <BR>G&#39;s
    hook could be lower <BR>M&#39;s upper connections are too heavy <BR>R is a bit
    unbalanced, looks like it&#39;s stooping <BR>Y makes me wonder why the stem on
    baseline has no &#39;flares&#39; <BR>Hope this helps -- nice classic looking typeface!
