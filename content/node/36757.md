body: "This is the very first design for a business card for my friend who wants to
  start her own PR thing. I don't have other designs yet but I hope to develop different
  directions soon. There weren't very many specs to go from. She is elegant, likes
  pink and has a certain sophistication about her that I wanted to deliver through
  the design. I created the \"flourish\" out of an F and by adding to its curves.
  The little \"*\" is for the shine in the tagline. If just this design is too insufficient
  to critique, let me know. \r\n\r\nI am also attaching my intention for the logo
  even though we never actually talked about creating one. She mostly wants a little
  BC for self promotion and I may not be the one doing the website.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "\r\nSomehow this feels a little too \"in the moment\" for a PR firm. From
    what I know about PR (admittedly not much), trust and stability might be as important
    to some clients as \"making a splash\" is for others. \r\n\r\nI'd increase the
    font size for contact info, put a physical address on the card, and balance your
    white space so it all feels grounded on the paper. \r\n\r\nFor a new business,
    I would even go so far as to list 2 or 3 of their key services on one side (this
    is especially helpful the morning after a party, when the recipient is sorting
    through 50 cards and trying to place names to faces). \r\n\r\nI also worry that
    the light green and fuchsia might not have enough contrast for a logo with such
    thin lines. \r\n\r\nAs for the identity, the script of the logo and the italic
    of the name feel like they are coming from two aesthetic sensibilities which are
    just different enough to be disconcerting. Look at the details of the italic (ball
    terminals, strong contrast between vertical vs. horizontal strokes) and the script
    (more gradual changes in stroke width, no ball terminals, based on calligraphy).
    \r\n\r\nI would think again about how you can convey elegance and sophistication.
    It doesn't necessarily mean scripty fonts. You have other variables to speak with,
    including spacing, color choice, paper choice, etc. \r\n\r\nhope that helps."

  body: Like the simplicity in your stationary. I'm not so sure you would want to
    list your services on a card, you may want to back it up with some other form
    of marketing. The color choice and font is very light and airy, which I like,
    but feel they don't come across as a PR company. I see more of a specialty boutique
    store. I think it's the color for that makes me feel that way. Anyway, great start.

  body: "I agree but disagree with Chris. I'm in PR, and yes, the logo should reflect
    trust and professionalism, but with the changing industry, it also has to reflect
    change and modernity to show it is will be able to take their clients into the
    future. \r\n\r\nThat said, I like the logo. Maybe a little <em>too</em< feminine
    for my tastes, but still reflects the trend in design: chic, clean, fun yet sophisticated.
    But I do agree with hola, I would have assumed it was a boutique store (as opposed
    to a boutique agency; which is what the company is, I'm sure).\r\n\r\nWhat would
    it look like without the asterisk?\r\n\r\nNice direction.\r\n\r\n-Scott"

  body: The image you've posted is too small and too fuzzy (over-anti-aliased, or
    just the wrong algorithm for downsampling?), the details aren't nearly clearly
    enough to see.

  body: "after a long hiatus... (I was in a boat in the backwaters of kerala)!\r\n\r\nI
    appreciate all the comments. I saw one too many badly done PR designs too and
    I wanted this one to own the personality of the person handing you the card. She
    happens to love* it. oops. but that can happen with bad designs too which I don't
    think this one is. but maybe not exactly cohesive enough (is what I pick up from
    chris's comments).\r\n\r\nthe comment about the boutique store is very intriguing
    to me because this PR firm/person could exude that sort of exclusive, dainty feel.\r\n\r\nI
    am still itching to do a completely fresh, new, maybe even more modern (less flourishy)
    design. \r\n\r\nI am also curious about sch2525's comments in terms of showing
    change and modernity and \"maybe a little too...\" ??? elaborate on that maybe?\r\n\r\ndid
    everyone have problems viewing the image? "

  body: I don't have any "problem viewing the images" -- I see them exactly the way
    I'm supposed to. The problem is with the images themselves -- they're too small
    and too fuzzy, as I've said.
