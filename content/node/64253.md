  for a bistro. Should have a clean line, more of a serious tone but still got to
  have some warm feeling. The food is served in an elegant way but is not too pricy.
  \ \r\nIf it\u2019s that not clear - M should remind lightly the pomegranate flower

  body: The font is too austere. A pomegranate is sweet, juicy, and complex, and even
    the <em>word</em> "pomegranate" is lush and extravagant. I would go for a more
    fluid, decorative look.

    much.\r\nI would try to play with the elements that stick out (P and g)."

  body: The top version of 11:47PM version is perfectly legible. It is almost as perfect
    as the word mark could go in my opinion, simple and organic twist on a letter
    that makes the whole word unique and memorable. Really good.

  body: "it feels more approachablethan the posting on 14.Nov.2009 2.52pm, in comparison
    a bit more informal and relaxed .\r\nI would like to see the type take on the
    volume of a pomegranate\u2014with the \"r\" at the center of the word the other
    letterforms could naturally conform to the round shape, that's if you don't mind
    it coming across more playful.\r\nNice work:)"

  body: The relative size of P looks OK, but I think it looked better in a lighter
    weight. Also 'e' appears to be slanted less from other letters.

  body: "The color looks accurate if you are trying to match the skin, but it's the
    inside that's edible and more about the fruit.\r\n\r\nI prefer the weight in the
    previous posting. The counter in the letters, especially in the \"a\" are too
    narrow. Also there's some letter spacing problems; \"ate\" and \"meg\" areas.\r\n\r\nI
    really like both directions.\r\nLooking back at your first posting, i wonder how
    it would look if you made the \"a\" and \"e\" large lowercase letterforms, (matching
    the x height of the capitals) so that it keeps the roundness within the logotype\u2014without
    having to make the logotype conform to the shape.\r\nMD"

- body: "I agree with epsilicon, the lighter weight is better. \r\n\r\nThe color looks
    fine; the skin of a pomegranate and it's seeds (anardana) inside are both dark
    red, so I'm not sure what \"marcdavid\" is talking about? I'd also disagree with
    his kerning advice -- the \u201Cate\u201D and \u201Cmeg\u201D look fine, but the
    \"r\" could use a little air on either side...but that would depend on which weight
    you settle on, of course.\r\n\r\nOverall, I think it's finally working. I looked
    over all your drafts, and this last concept is by far the best. I'd be careful
    with the pillow embossing, however; you don't want to veer into the chain-restaurant/Chili's
    look. \r\n\r\nNice work - obsessing pays off!\r\n"

  body: "It feels too tight to me -- especially the space around 'r'. Now you have
    some awkward negative space between 'e' and 'g'. I'd suggest to levae the whitespace
    between 'e' and 'g' the way it is and space out the rest to balance it.\r\n\r\nFurthermore
    I'm not sure about the details added to 'r'. It will propably get lost at smaller
    sizes.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the current version feels very nice and the whole process
    is really enjoyable."
