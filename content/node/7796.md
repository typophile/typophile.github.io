body: In a recent search to find something better than Courier New for programming,
  I came upon this thread... <BR> <BR><a href="http://typographi.com/000744.php" target="_blank">http://typographi.com/000744.php</a>
  <BR> <BR>I tried some 40 odd fonts and found that I like Bitstream Vera Mono at
  9pt very much. However, I would like to modify the font in a few ways, just slightly.
  I found very little free or cheap tools to do so. I found one called Softy... <BR>
  <BR><a href="http://users.breathe.com/l-emmett/" target="_blank">http://users.breathe.com/l-emmett/</a>
  <BR> <BR>Using Softy I turned Vera Mono 9pt into a bitmap font so I could easily
  edit it. This is great! However, I noticed that on my &#40;Windows&#41; box TT fonts
  are nicely anti-aliased while bitmap fonts are not. Softy only does B&amp;W. I tried
  the FONmaker demo and the bitmap fonts it created were not anti-aliased either.
  <BR> <BR>Is it possible to rasterize TT fonts into anti-aliased bitmaps fonts? What
  program would allow me to do this conversion? What can I use to easily modify the
  bitmap font? <BR> <BR>I&#39;m only really planning to modify this one font for my
  programming, since I stare at it some 10 hours a day. I have little artist skill
  and highly doubt I will be doing anything else with fonts. Because of this, I don&#39;t
  really want to spend $100&#43; for a program that does what I need plus much more.
  I think $30-$40 is reasonable for what I want. I would pay someone if they could
  help! However, I would like to be able to edit the grayscale font myself, so I don&#39;t
  have to keep bugging someone for any small changes I may want down the road.

    <BR>Delivering hand-made grayscale fonts is a tricky business - I know because
    I tried for over six years! Then Ultrafonts came on the scene and made it possible
    - I&#39;ll explain below. But first the reasons why it&#39;s so tricky: the FON
    format doesn&#39;t support grayscale &#40;it also doesn&#39;t support extended
    encodings BTW&#41;, and while the TT format is supposed to allow embedded grayscale
    bitmaps &#40;for which you can use BitFonter - not a cheap program though&#41;
    I could never get it to actually work. And then there&#39;s the Mac side, which
    no longer supports any bitmap formats of any kind... <BR> <BR>So in the end the
    only robust way of delivering hand-made grayscale fonts is to make pixelfonts:
    outline fonts that have funny blocky patterns that render out the desired grays
    at the right pixel locations when used at a certain size. And making these fonts
    is no picnic; you can try to do it yourself, but I&#39;d advise against it. Much
    better would be to sign up as a developer at Ultrafonts.com, which is what I did.
    They have a converter that takes a filled Photoshop template and spits out a grayscale
    TT pixelfont, but as a result you have to share any sales profits with them. You
    might not be interested in more than just using the end result yourself, but know
    that they would expect a finished font that can be sold retail. Alternatively
    you might talk them into a no-strings-attached per-conversion fee; but I doubt
    it will be $40... <BR> <BR>If you&#39;re not dead-set on doing your own design,
    here&#39;s another idea: as you know I&#39;m considering making a monospaced version
    of Mana. If you can wait let&#39;s say a couple of months, and you&#39;re willing
    to pay me the $40 to speed up the development, I&#39;ll make you a Manamono-13
    Bold, and you can start coding in high style. <BR> <BR>hhp'

    Strange that something that seems so simple is such a hack! I&#39;m in contact
    with UltraFonts and we&#39;ll see how that goes soon, I would like to see how
    my font looks anti-aliased. I am pretty happy with how it has turned out. I&#39;ve
    done a lot of hand tuning, touching most of the characters. <BR> <BR>I might google
    on embedding bitmap fonts into TT, just for kicks. <BR> <BR>I do like Mana 13,
    but 13 would be too large for me. I think Mana Mono 11 would be great though!
    I need both a regular and a bold version, as my editor bolds certain parts of
    the code for me. However, I do like the flexibility of being able to edit a font
    anytime I please. <BR> <BR>If you&#39;d like, you can find my font here... <BR>

    I met with Norm Megill of <a href="http://www.metamath.org/">Metamath</a> fame
    recently. He has done a rather impressive bitmap math font for his project, but
    has been thinking along the lines of a hand-built grayscale font &#40;likely delivered
    through one PNG file for each glyph&#41;. He may well be willing to do it himself,
    but could probably use some guidance re tools and the like. Or, if someone wanted
    to help draw, that would be even better.'
