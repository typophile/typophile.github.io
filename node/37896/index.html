I remember the prof telling a story about the section of the book where Bringhurst talks about different fonts, and how there was a font he didn't like so he left it out. 

Is that true? What font was it?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Actually, Uncle Stinky has an entry in the very rare suppressed version 1.9 of <em>The Elements of Typographic Style,</em> almost no copies of which are known to have survived. I've seen one, unbound copy but wasn't allowed to open it, and so far as I know not even Robert has a copy. It is worth a small fortune. Robert didn't write the Uncle Stinky entry, of course. Rumour has it it that the entry was inserted by a disgruntled typesetter at Hartley & Marks who quit the firm around the same time. The error was discovered at the printer's, only after the book had been printed and the individual signatures sewn. Thankfully, the covers had not been glued on yet, so only the last three signatures needed to be pulped and reprinted.

The moral of the story is something about proofreading, I guess.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Disgruntled typesetters indeed. There are disgruntled proofreaders also.

I once worked as night-shift proofreader in a magazine printing plant. We also set type there. All was on very fast schedules all the time. A disgruntled day-shift reader made his exit one day after working on an article about Central America for a travel magazine.

This guy marked for the word "banana" to be inserted in the text at random spots. The resulting modified sentences made no sense at all. The proof went back to the Linotype VIP guys, who never bothered to read anything more than the reader's marks. Nothing odd at all about multiple insertions of "banana" in an article about Central America, right? Not when platemakers are breathing down your neck.

The insertions got made, the proof went back to the same disgruntled proofreader. He marked "OK TO PLATE" on the proof, punched out, got his stuff from his locker, and walked out. That was Friday. All hell broke loose Monday when the publisher saw his magazine, and the proofreader was not seen again in that city, as far as I know. 

The proofreader was not I.
