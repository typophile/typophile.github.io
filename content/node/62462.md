body: I have a client who wish to use a specific ornament from a book dated back to
  1920 as his mark in his logo. My question is if I can just simply use this straight
  out of the book as my client wishes, or can I tell him that I will have to design
  a unique ornament inspired by the one in the book? I obviously prefer to design
  a unique mark!

  body: Well, if you design a unique mark, there will be no copyfight issues (I know
    there is a typo there, but I like it). An 89 year old mark should be out of copyright,
    but one can never be sure ... isn't Little House on the Prairie (the book) still
    under copyright.

    If you scan a tearsheet from a book that was almost certainly printed letterpress,
    it''s going to look a little rough. '

    make a unique mark as a first suggestion hehe. As well as redraw the original
    mark, and present this as a second suggestion.\r\n\r\nThanks guys!"
