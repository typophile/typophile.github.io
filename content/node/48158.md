  face is used in all the printable material from MALBA, Museo de Arte Latinoamericano
  de Buenos Aires. The webpage is http://www.malba.org.ar/ , althoug I think it's
  not the same face used there. \r\nI think its FF Scala Sans but I'm not sure. \r\nIf's
  that the case, it would be really helpful if you could recommend me any similar
  free font.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot,"
