  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi,

I would like to know what you think and what I should do.

I bought the font "Arno Pro" from Adobe (Designer is Robert Slimbach). And I think, that the german quotes are wrong (see the attachment). What do you think?

I wrote to Adobe Support, an they said, they can see only a little discrepance and they think everything is fine. I wrote back, that I don´t think this is right - I´m waiting for the answer since almost 2 months! I didn´t find the "type department" by Adobe, so I couldn´t ask them. 

Thanks for support.
Greetings

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Florian,

this came up before: <a href="http://typophile.com/node/47417">Problem with Double Quotes in Arno Pro</a>.
Miguel Sousa from Adobe chimed in, so the Type Department is aware of this bug for 15 months now. I don’t know if there is an update available yet.

It’s really a pity, since it renders Arno almost useless for German typesetting: The »guillemets« are too extravagant (or ‘historically authentic’), and the „Anführungszeichen“ don’t harmonise.

You wrote „german quotes"; they are also „polish quotes". Yet more (40+ mln) speakers. Looks like Adobe is not interested in european market.
What are your customer rights? This product (font in that case) is simply useless.

Thanks for your support! I already doubted that I´m right. 

Yes, it is really too bad. I bought the font 3 months ago - so, Adobe didn´t fixed it in 12 months! Is it so difficult? I don´t belive it! It´s so a good font (in my opinion) - and it is well paid. 

I use the "guillemets" - but it´s not what I really want. 

Well - what to do? Maybe I call Adobe once again.

That's certainly not the answer that the Type department would give you, since we're aware of the bug and have fixed it already in version 1.012 (dated 8 December 2008) as you can read on the [[http://store1.adobe.com/type/browser/html/readmes/ArnoProReadMe.html|font's Release Notes]].

Since you licensed the fonts 3 months ago, I don't understand why you got an old version, but I'll try to find out. Meanwhile, I'll contact you directly to resolve your problem. Sorry again for the inconvenience.</div>

As for modification, this is only possible for the pros here in this forum, I wouldn't know how. Anyhow, my complain was that vendors could be deal the “updating” issue with more responsibility.

Although the bug was fixed after ten months, the reason might be, that the bug lately was reported. And if somebody does not reply, this does not necessarily mean, that you are ignored. In this case I simply would ask a second time. I never had such a request to Adobe, but somehow I doubt, that they intentionally ignore their customers. At least this does not coincide with my notion of Adobe. (But I admit, that I am an Adobe junkie, since they have got me hooked on Photoshop 5.) And in contradiction to most if not all other foundries, Adobe publishes release notes of their fonts, which is commendable. Additionally there are a few people active on this forum, that work for Adobe and that probably recognize bug reports, if they are posted here.

But generally I agree with you with regard to update information: Licensees should be informed per mail, if a font is updated.

Edited: I just see, that someone wrote, that the bug was reported 15 months before the fix. This would be definetely too long, especially because it was a heavy bug in my opinion.</div>
