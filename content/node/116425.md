  \r\ninto digital typefaces?\r\nAs a reminder, here's the list of these XVI/XVII
  th century scripts: \r\n<em>Ronde, B\xE2tarde, Coul\xE9e</em>.\r\nDo the designers
  of the typefaces change their names for commercial purpose?\r\n\r\nAll I can find
  is <em>ATFrenchScript</em> which is a <em>Ronde</em>.\r\nIt originated from <strong>Stephenson
  Blake</strong> back in 1905.\r\n"

  body: "I can make a pretty good guess as to the scripts you mention, but it would
    help a lot if you could post an image of your example of each script. Believe
    it or not, variation exists.\r\nAs for name changes, I assure you that makers
    of digital versions of old typefaces often change the names because somebody else
    owns a the name, or because they believe a different name works for them for any
    of a multitude of reasons.\r\nDon"
