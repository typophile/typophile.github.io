    posted that  <BR>I was previously unaware of. And no one ever really says  <BR>much
    about Zs. I thought it might be interesting to see  <BR>what people like about
    Z. I have a z in my name and have  <BR>never found a good way to use it. <BR>
    <BR>In my view,  a lot of free design assistance happens around  <BR>here, particularly
    in the Design section of Typophile. Topics  <BR>such as <i> What serif faces go
    with Interstate?, Suggestions  <BR>for book typeface, Wine &amp; typefaces</i>
    all seem to be asking  <BR>about the same sort of question as mine and all seem

  body: 'Gerald, <BR> <BR>I agree with you on your choice of Z. It certainly would
    be interesting on <i>certain</i> wine labels. In France, though, people would
    automatically assume it was German/Alsacien wine. In the US, this is probably
    not the case. <BR> <BR>And Sean &#40;Sean Michael?&#41;, <BR> <BR>I had approximately
    the same reaction to your first post as Gerald. This year, though, I&#39;m giving
    people the benefit of the doubt and in your case it&#39;s paid off. <BR> <BR>Unfortunately,
    you gave the impression that you hadn&#39;t done any research yourself and wanted
    other people to do your work for you. Even worse, perhaps, you also gave the impression
    that you don&#39;t know much about what you are doing.   <BR> <BR>I think, your
    second post cleared most of this up. That said, I think you have a point about
    the amount of people looking for free advice in here. <BR> <BR>Good luck in your
    project and don&#39;t forget to let us know when you&#39;ve come up with something.

  body: i don&#39;t think anybody here is looking for other&#39;s to do their work
    for them. they are looking for advice, inspiration, and education, which every
    single designer does by the way. be it when talking with their colleges, flipping
    through a magazine, or reading a book. i always believed this board was about
    the exchange of ideas which may eventually be put to use. but i guess design is
    a business, and a copetitive one at that and in this culture everything comes
    at a cost.

    are we talking about Courier, the typewriter-like font that is included as a default
    face on pretty much every computer ever made? The &#34;z&#34; you posted isn&#39;t
    a glyph in that Courier, as far as I can find. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/courier/courier/mac-t1/24623/character/007A/CP4/"

    <BR> <BR>The &#34;z&#34; you posted looks closer to Hellenic Wide. Courier&#39;s
    &#34;z&#34; is much squarer. <BR> <BR>Many of the &#34;z&#34;s in The Hoefler
    Type Foundry&#39;s Proteus Project fonts are quite beautiful, especially the italics.

  body: Anonymous <BR> <BR>Despite Stephen&#39;s admonition, I think this is an interesting
    exchange about something not often discussed here.  <BR> <BR>It&#39;s not just
    that design is a business, which it most definitely is, and a very competitive
    one. &#34;Cost&#34; is not specific to our culture but has been around ever since
    the idea of the &#34;marketplace&#34; and the beginning of &#34;culture.&#34;
    <BR> <BR>But, let&#39;s say Sean liked the Goudy Thirty alt Z and used it in his
    client&#39;s piece. Yeah, he gets the money. But more importantly, he gets the
    credit for the design. And based on this, he may even pull in other work, undeservedly,
    in this regard. I doubt he&#39;d actually feel good about that. <BR> <BR>There
    isn&#39;t anything new under the sun, and yes, ideas and inspiration generally
    come from our exposure to the work of our peers. But there is a bit of a difference
    in how this is working here. Its one thing to show a piece and humbly ask for
    a critique, its another to ask others to contribute to your work and then take
    credit for it. I&#39;m sure Sean understands this based on his recent post.  <BR>
    <BR>I certainly am inspired by the work of others and will drawn upon what I find
    useful, but quite frankly, I would never ask someone for design advice as I don&#39;t
    know how I could then say the piece was my own work &#40;for better or worse&#41;.
    And this has got nothing to do with money.

  body: '&#62; he gets the credit for the design <BR> <BR>Not necessarily. Although
    it&#39;s not reasonable to give public/explicit/formal credit for every bit of
    inspiration a designer unavoidably gets, ethically it&#39;s expected of anybody
    who benefits beyond a certain threshold to state his debt, and there&#39;s no
    reason to assume Sean wouldn&#39;t do the right thing. To me asking isn&#39;t
    so bad - but pretending you didn&#39;t ask is indeed a big problem. <BR> <BR>And
    if somebody wants to actually share any resultant &#34;wealth&#34; that would
    be even more commendable. Maybe a small donation to Typophile? For example, my
    own membership payment here has little to do with getting yet another cool t-shirt.
