body: "I am really struggling with the kerning on this logo and this is the best I
  have been able to do. I would appreciate any help or suggestions to get the spacing
  perfect optically. I think I got the rino part of Marino. The M seems a little off
  from the a, but closing it up really messes the whole thing, so I just wanted to
  see if it was all in my head or not. Also, is the Gr part of Greg looking off to
  anyone. \r\n\r\nPS: I have not done much fine tuned logo work so I dont have much
  experience to count on. Any pointers are very appreciated.\r\n\r\nAmrita"

  body: Gr is way too tight.  "rino" indeed looks really good, but then "Mar" and
    "reg" look too tight in comparison (though they are consistent between themselves).
