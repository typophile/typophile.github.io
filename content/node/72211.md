  body: I would recommend hiring a professional designer to assist with the typography
    and spacing. I would also try to find a tattoo artist able to follow precise specifications,
    and follow up with references to customers who received similar work.

    the spacing \"PAS\" and \"SAGE\" could use some work (PA and SA combinations too
    tight), also to my eye the italic Q and S's looks distorted - is this the true
    italic? \r\n\r\n"

    font is not a good one, i'll check the points tonight.\r\n\r\nI will certainly
    play with the diagonal too !\r\n\r\nYou haven't tell me if you like the idea,

    It's as if the designer has a block of text and thinks \"I've got to jazz this
    up somehow . . . I know! I'll put a line through it!\" Is there a reason for the

    not having regrets about a tattoo like yours later.\r\n\r\nAnd with regard to
    the 45\xB0 line, I absolutely agree with Penn."

  body: "<cite>IMO, the diagonal line will date quickly, but the layout and type choice

    the quote, too.) \r\n\r\nJust be aware that it <em>is</em> tempting fate/life
    to get large, light, geometric letters tattooed on a uh, morphable area of the
    body. It makes for a very nice texture; but make sure you're comfortable with
    the fact that even if you don't gain weight, it won't always look like it does
    in your nice mockups but will sag and wrinkle. Skin gets old and looser, and tattoos
    get lighter and blurrier. If you're fine with that, good.\r\nThat said, I would
    consider making the name bigger, and/or looser (in terms of spacing). In the layout
    it looks good in terms of proportion, but it might just be too small/dense/detailed
    for skin.\r\nAlso, please get a tattoo artist who really knows what they're doing."

  body: "I don't think a geometric typeface is a good choice on this part of the body.
    Keep in mind that your belly will change over the years, it's kind of unavoidable.
    And a distorted Futura will look horrible. Plus, it's really, very hard to make
    perfect rounds with such thin lines on skin, and there is always a possibility
    for the ink to spread a little... Consider choosing a typeface that will aesthetically
    handle this kind of problem. Also, the quote says that wise people are also a
    little crazy - imho, Futura is really not the best choice for the idea. At last,
    the line seem pointless and 80's, and the name of the author is, again imho, useless.\r\n\r\n...

  body: "I've been pondering about getting a type tattoo for a while as well and I'd
    just like to point out that tattooing isn't a very exact art-form. The little
    details that make the letterform can easily disappear, no matter how experienced
    and/or talented the tattoo artist might be. Skin stretches and while the letters
    might look good with your arm in a certain position, it will probably look (very)
    warped when you move around. Also the above mentioned blurring of tattoos may
    cause problems, especially with such thin lines.\r\n\r\nType tattoos can be cool,
    but it's important to keep in mind that tattoo artists are not typographers and
    skin isn't a piece of paper. A tattoo can never be a perfect copy of your design
    and vector-sharp edges will blur with time. When I was designing my own tattoo,
    I had some unrealistic expectations on how the result should turn out. After talking
    to various tattoo artists, I came to accept the fact that I can't have complete
    control over the tattooing process. One of the studios I visited actually had
    a sign on the front door stating that they won't make tattoos for graphic designers
    \u2013 I don't know exactly why, but I think it has something to do with the fact
    that perfectionists and control-freaks are notoriously hard to work with ;)\r\n\r\nJust
    my two cent's worth."

    front. I'd also increase the pt. size of the name as it could easily turn to an
    unreadable blob at that size, weight and tracking.\r\n\r\n<em>penn</em>"
