body: Looking for some feedback on this logo I designed for a photo restoration business
  I am starting.  I wanted something with a retro/vintage feel, without being too
  kitschy. I think I have succeeded at that here, but I am looking for some outside
  opinion. Thanks.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mod_pf_logo_5680.png]

  body: I'd say that having a lens in the logo implies a photography business, i.e.
    something to do with actual cameras and picture taking. It's a cleverly constructed
    mark though, I like it a lot.
