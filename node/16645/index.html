I've done all of the usual searches and gone through my own and my studios rather well-stocked type library and have come up empty handed. Notice the odd double-storey "a" and square dot on the "i?" Can anyone offer suggestions? Any help is very much appreciated.

		<div class="commentbody">Exactly. With maybe a very small dash of Bell Gothic thrown in for good measure. I'm looking through Veer right now but not finding anything. I get the feeling that someone also horizontally scaled the font in; the "u" "r" "t" and "o" seem unnaturally narrow.

Great forums and site, btw. This place will be a daily visit.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks, Chester. I'm leaning towards a hacked version of Myriad Pro myself but there are so many little "almost there" things about this logo's specific type that are nagging at me. Just tiny little elements of lots of other modern san serif faces. I'll keep hunting and play a bit in Illustrator to see if I can match it somewhat.

Thanks for the help. Keep me posted if you stumble across anything else.

Regards, David

PS. Wasn't there a program back in the early 1990s that did what you mentioned earlier ... merged two typefaces to create a new one? I'm getting old and forgetting such things.

PPS. I see what you mean about Corbel but the "o" is the wrong shape. Maybe Corbel + Dax + Myriad? :-)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Just about any font software will let you "blend" fonts. Which is how I - and many of my collegues - start interim weights of typefaces. If you blend a couple of existing fonts, you can get some very interesting fonts, but the results usually look mangled, but not like the sample you have posted. This was purposefully cut'n'pasted, either by a graphic designer or an amateur type designer.</div>

a _ the bottom right corner was completely cut up and altered.

		<div class="commentbody">I agree on the "t" and "u". It also seems to share some characteristics with Frutiger Bold Condensed of all things. I may be on a wild goose hunt here but maybe the "a" comes from another font altogther. The bowl of the "a" is just all wrong compared to the rest of the letters (to these old eyes, any way).

I have Fontographer from way back (1997?) but haven't yet updated to the new OSX version. Soon, perhaps.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Got it! It is indeed Frutiger Bold Condensed, ever so slightly tweaked. I'm just working in Illustrator here and it matches with only a very few odd little modifications ... the main one being the "a".

		<div class="commentbody">I agree as well.  It looked like a bastardized version of Frutiger to me, too. It was the vertical end to the top storey of the a that did it for me; Myriad's a would have had a forward-leaning angle.
