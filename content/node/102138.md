  kind and give me a feed back to my former work and may be a short explanation to
  you opinion.\r\n\r\nThank you very much in advance."

  body: "Let me start by saying that I'm not an expert. I like the font. I see a few
    areas that trouble me...\r\n\r\nThe upper case \"S\" seems visually too wide compared
    to the rest of the character set. And, for some reason I can't fathom, it looks
    like it is tilted slightly.\r\n\r\nThe lowercase \"w\" the negative space in the
    center seems too open compared to the negative spaces to the left and right. It
    almost looks like two \"v's\" moved together.\r\n\r\nIn the current usage of the
    \"#\" symbol, the glyph is the same height and baseline as the \"l\" or \"X.\"
    As hashtags, they take up about the same space as other uppercase glyphs.\r\n\r\nJust
    for aesthetics, the dollar sign should take up approximately the same space as
    a zero or eight glyph.\r\n\r\nJust my opinion and it is worth what you paid for
    it."

  body: "Yes thanks a lot phrostbyte64.\r\n\r\nI am glad that you see similar flaws
    in it as i do, i\u2019ve been correcting the shapes you\u2019ve mentioned many
    times, so i think i\u2019ve lost a bit of my objectivity about it. Currently i
    am still working on the font, so i will upload another version, after may be one
    or two more critics.\r\n\r\nbest regards"

  body: "\r\nIt seems to me that all diagonals bars are too heavy (K, k, V etc.) and
    the t is too tall (it should be not as tall as the l) The B is corriged optically
    but not the E, F, H. The x and y are weird maybe because of kind f inktraps you've
    made... For the rest I agree with James. I don't know if it's help but good luck
    anyway"

  body: "Looks nice overall, a few potentially awkward areas, though.\r\n\r\n/X, /x
    look very odd... you've staggered the upper-left-to-lower-right diagonal, which
    is something I've never seen before.  Usual practice is to stagger the other diagonal,
    due to the way the eye moves while reading.  IMHO the amount of offset is also
    rather extreme, at least for the lowercase /x.\r\n\r\nNot sure that /a isn't a
    tad on the wide side.  Agree with others about /S and /w though.\r\n\r\nFinally
    there's something that bothers me about the /k... I think the diagonals look a
    bit top-heavy.  Maybe extending the lower leg (or bringing in the top one) a bit,
    and/or lowering the junction just a touch, would be worth trying."

  body: "Wow! Thanks guys. Those are a lot of great inputs.\r\n@ Matthieu Cannavo:\r\nYou\u2019re
    right, i was experimenting with the sizes of the diagonal bars. I figured to make
    them bigger, because they would have been a lot too thin at first. But i probably
    over did it. I did not even realise the E, F and H middle bars are on the geometrical
    middle and not how supposed to be a little higher =) i made that by accident just
    pushing the E bar up and down until i thought it was right. I corrected the B
    too, because if B and E are supposed to be about at the same hight, it\u2019s
    probably better to find something in between, the F would look a bit weird otherwise.\r\n@
    altsan:\r\nI knew there was something fishy about the X characters, i must have
    accidentally mixed up the left and the right side (i\u2019m a bit of a legasthenic)
    and started it off the wrong way never realising why things look weird. I\u2019ll
    have a look at the k.\r\n\r\nNow i have to work on it for a while until i\u2019ll
    upload another version. You are a real help. All of you.\r\nbest regards"

  body: "Perhaps the most obvious problem is found in /y/. The junction of its diagonals
    is faa(...)aar too high. Make them join near the baseline.\r\n\r\nYou should definitely
    make the overshoot at the bottom of /a/ more prominent.\r\n\r\nI really dig the
    inverted trapezoid tittles, and how they match the idea you came up with for the
    terminals of /T/, /E/, etc., but they don't pair well with the angled cuts of
    diagonal stems IMO. I would suggest that you first try out 'normal' cuts and then
    consider if it is worth to diverge from conventional.\r\n\r\nCut /t/'s hair. It's
    starting to look like Marge Simpson.\r\n\r\nFix the width of /w/, /S/ and /r/.
    You will never see a /r/ grow that far to the right. The width of the tabular
    figures forces shapes to be more squarish than the other characters.\r\n\r\nYou
    <em>could</em> make ink-traps for /V/, /W/, /M/, /G/ and alike. Do as you think
    is best. Overall I think you've done a good job regularizing the weight (...with
    the exception of /4/, which appears to be darker than for instance its neighbors;
    the diagonal stroke of /Q/ is also too heavy).\r\n\r\n/j/ is the only character
    that creases at the bottom.\r\n\r\nNice /\xDF/!\r\n\r\n/S/ and /s/ look stretched
    partly because the cuts are not perpendicular to the strokes.\r\n\r\nSorry that
    almost all of my observations are negative. But hey, critique is ment to be useful,
    not flattering ;-)"

  body: "@ LexLuengas:\r\nThat\u2019s fine with me. After all i asked for it. I\u2019ve
    tried with non angled cuts in my first two fonts, which i don\u2019t consider
    worth talking about. This time i went with the angled cuts because i was curious
    how it would work out and i liked the combination but i also respect your opinion.
    The junction of the lower case y is indeed a bit high, but i haven\u2019t seen
    that before so i only changed it a bit and not the whole way down to the baseline,
    i just did what felt right. And i want to add, that i don\u2019t think that constructive
    criticism is negative. Not at all it is a very important part of progress.\r\n\r\nI
    had a look at all of the suggested changes and i truly appreciate that you guys
    have taken your the time to have a close look. The result of my further work you
    see down below. I am sure that i will not satisfy all of you, because i think
    that is neither possible, nor necessary. In the end i must admit i am a lot more
    pleased with the result than before, so thanks again. And i\u2019ll come back
    and post the bold (i\u2019ve started working on).\r\n\r\nbest regards\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/alpha
