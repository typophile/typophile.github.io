  i have been over at adobe forums and all I got was told I was posting in the wrong
  forum (which I was not...)\r\n\r\nMy paragraphs are behaving in a very strange way
  in InDesign CS2. I have hyphenation OFF and they break erratically, not even at
  the end of the line sometimes... \r\n\r\nThe text has not been imported normally,
  I have copied it from a pdf.\r\nI am using a basic paragraph style with up to seven
  character styles. I am also using a LOT of m\u2014space and n\u2014spaces, multiply
  characters and indesign small caps (not font based). I have a hunch these are causing
  the problems but cannot figure out an answer... Any ideas greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat
  I have tried...\r\n1. opening the files in CS3, no change\r\n2. copying text into
  Text Editor, making it plain Text then back to Rich text, no change...\r\nwhen i
  copy the text from my ID doc into basic textEdit characters are lost\r\n50\xD775cm
  becomes 0\xD775cm\r\nc189ba becomes 189ba\r\n3. changed fonts, same thing happens\r\n4.
  obviously adobe single line composer is active \r\n\r\nwhich, leads me to believe
  i am doing something terrifically wrong in inDesign, ie, it is not the font or the
  text...\r\nbut i know, deep down inside, that i am doing something wrong myself...\r\n\r\ni
  have posted a sample file, with a screen shot of what it looks like on my screen,
  fonts are irrelevant as they all mess up...\r\n\r\nmany thanks to anyone who cares
  to have a look!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    text from a pdf.\r\nAs much as I know there are no soft returns\r\nin a pdf, which
    means if you copy the text\r\nit Indesign will see each line as a separate\r\nparagraph.
    Have you turned on the\r\nhidden characters in Indesign?\r\n\r\nHope this helps..."

  body: "Hi Kuga,\r\n\r\nYou will have to excuse the ID poster for making you think
    you were in the wrong forum. I think he spends too much time in the Photoshop
    forum :-)\r\n\r\nTurn on Invisible characters, as Agostini suggested. That way
    you will see (prediction!) that there is nothing wrong with the line breaks; the
    text consists of a lot of short, paragraph return ending lines.\r\n\r\nThe reason
    that you can copy it into TextEdit and RTF all you want and still get not what
    you want is that the lines in the PDF are broken there just the same. A PDF <em>may</em>
    be aware of line endings, but they usually are not. So if you copy text out of
    it, you get paragraph returns at the end of every single line. (Sometimes lines
    are concatenated anyway, but not in a reliable way, it's just Acrobat doing guesswork.)
    TextEdit is not aware the paragraphs should run together and leaves the line endings
    as they are. Trying RTF does the same, as does virtually every piece of software,
    unless you <em>tell</em> it that the lines should be concatenated. (Some common
    word processors, and all programmers' editors can do that.)\r\n\r\nYou can select
    the entire text and replace paragraph returns with a space. No need for GREP fancyness
    -- just enter \"^p\" in the regular \"Find Text\" box, and replace with a single
    space. Be sure to choose to replace in \"Selection\" only, so it won't mess up
    your entire document."

  body: "A-ha! (So far for my predictions ... ;-)\r\n\r\nThis is Adobe's (patented?)
    Paragraph Composer at work. Rather than filling up every line until it reaches
    the end, it tries to average spacing and line lengths all over the paragraph.
    It runs into problems if you want total control over a paragraph's line endings
    (and the em spaces probably don't help either).\r\n\r\nUsing the Paragraph Panel,
    you can switch to the Single Line Composer, which <em>does</em> work as you expect.
    In addition, if you want certain phrases not to be split, you can select the entire
    phrase and apply No Break from the Character Panel's tiny menu."

    not resolved\r\ni think there was a little overlap with my previous post and your

    replacing the n spaces with two spaces and 3 for the m spaces does work... i feel
    like now that they are the sole problem, no questions...\r\n\r\nhowever, maybe
    i am being pedantic...  this will work with spaces\r\nbut I have just discovered
    (and clearly fallen in love with (but not as much as the elipses... hahaha)) the
    n+m spaces...\r\nbut what use are they if they simply mess up the paragraph, and
    i have to go back to using multiple spaces?\r\n\r\ni have enormous respect for
    the complexity of ID that is far far far beyond my comprehension and something
    like n spaces should not really cause such a problem?"
