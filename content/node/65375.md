  \r\n\r\nAs I understand, it's a convention in certain countries to put the title
  top-to-bottom (Wikipedia: \"In the United States, the United Kingdom and Scandinavia,
  titles are usually written top-to-bottom, and this practice is reflected in an industry
  standard;[18] when the book is placed on a table with the front cover upwards, the
  title is correctly oriented left-to-right on the spine. In most of continental Europe,
  the general convention is to print titles bottom-to-top on the spine.\"). \r\n\r\nWell,
  I got my answer there, but I am actually wondering about the reason for putting
  the title the opposite way, because I am from Croatia, so books that I do do not
  fit in the countries mentioned above. I know that most things in book design and
  typography have some justification in history of type and bookmaking, so if anyone
  has an answer to this one, I would really appreciate it.\r\n\r\nThank you very much!"

    of the title if the book is placed on a table versus the graphic design convention
    that says that, if a text is placed vertically, it should read from the bottom.\r\nIf
    you need to set a book spine I think you should look for book similar to the one
    you need to set and see what solution they adopt. Then deciding accordingly."

    graphic novels seem to handle these conventions remarkably loosely. Much back-and-forth-head-tilting
    there :-)"

  body: "Bottom to top in Russia\r\n\r\nOne explanation I've heard, was that a book
    placed on the table with the front cover up, can be easily identified from the
    cover itself, while the one laying face-down can only be told by the spine.\r\n\r\nThis
    explanation seems rather sketchy, as back when the convention was established
    , most books didn't carry writing on the covers, and the spine was a primary identifier.\r\n_____________________________________________\r\nPersonal

    along a vertical axis as opposed to horizontal? Nineteenth century, I believe.
    I''ll bet there was a lot of variation regardless of geography. Here is a hypothesis:
    Well-known bookbinders in big cities set the standards for the region.'

  body: "Re to the original question: this can be a cultural matter. Anyway, FWIW,
    Jorge de Buen in his <em>Manual de dise\xF1o editorial</em> states that bottom-to-top
    is more legible than the other way around. He includes the following example:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lomos_4511.jpg]\r\n\r\nCertainly
    I can read better the bottom-to-top text than the other one, but it can be just
    me. Fortunately, you can always put the book upside down in your bookcase.\r\n\r\n\u2014
    \u2014 \u2014\r\n\r\nAs for the CD matter: at least in this case you usually have
    two \u201Cspines\u201D so you can put both versions. :P"

  body: "Hmmm! Perhaps there is a browser problem. I'm seeing it with Mozilla and
    Chrome, but haven't checked with IE. This is too bad! :(\r\nI sent you the text
    on the mail, np!\r\n\r\nFor other people with the same problem - I am posting
    here my hypothesis in a nutshell - if you want to see the rationale or some supporting
    data, you have to check my page with Mozilla or Chrome browsers (and perhaps others
    will also do the job).\r\n\r\n\"...This string of reasoning leads to the simplistic
    conclusion that in Great Britain and USA (plus the Netherlands) people read more
    pragmatic books \u2013 textbooks, science, manuals, guides, encyclopedias, how-to
    books. On the Continent people read more literature. Pragmatic books are read
    in a problem-oriented way, with more sources at a time; literature is read in
    a content-oriented way, one book at a time. In the first case it is more important
    to be able to read the spine text when the book is in a pile with others, face
    up. In the second \u2013 it is more important for the spine text to enable book
    recognition in all positions \u2013 alone...\"\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nNikolay"
