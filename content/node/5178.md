  body: Mark, how different is MS Sans Serif from Tahoma? Visually comparing my XP
    desktop with the Win 95 screenshots on Marcin Wichary&#39;s wonderful <a href="http://www.aci.com.pl/mwichary/guidebook/">GUIdebook</a>
    site, the two look very similar.

  body: 'At screen resolution, they are pretty similar. However, MS Sans Serif is
    bitmap only. I think Tahoma replaced it when they decided to go with an outline
    font.  <BR> <BR>Tahoma was created by Matthew Carter &#40;who, as we all know,
    also did Verdana, which is very similar&#41;. I imagine Microsoft wanted to keep
    it fairly similar to MS Sans Serif and that may be why they look similar. '

  body: Hah, that&#39;s funny. That page&#39;s comparison clearly shows Tahoma&#39;s
    superiority.

  body: 'MS Sans Serif was eventually made into an outline font as well. I think it
    first appeared as an OpenType font with Windows 2000, and is titled &#34;Microsoft
    Sans Serif&#34; &#40;no abbreviation&#41;. The old bitmap MS Sans Serif is named
    sserife.fon on my system. The outline version is named micross.ttf. <BR> <BR>I
    think Tahoma made its debut with Office 97, at least that&#39;s when I first recall
    seeing it. '

  body: Thanks fot your input. In the end I decided to go with Tahoma. Disabling aliasing
    makes it virtually identical to the original systemfont MS Sans...
