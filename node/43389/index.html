  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Greetings everyone,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently taking my first typography class and part of our project is to conduct an interview with typographers which we will then present in class. Being more on the graphic side of art, typography is fairly new to me. However, after getting infected with my professor&rsquo;s enthusiasm (she even made us watch Helvetica while on her Helvetica T-shirt)I&rsquo;m starting to take a deeper interest on the subject.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s anyone out there willing to extend his or her wisdom to an eager student, please post a reply and a way for me to contact you. In the meantime, I&rsquo;ll be thinking about the questions and exploring the rest of the site. Thank you for your time!</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the suggestion, Miss Tiffany. I&rsquo;ve thought about that too but the idea of just dropping questions and collecting them later makes me feel like I don&rsquo;t really care about the interview or the person I&rsquo;m interviewing. Kinda like a survey. I want it to be a little more dynamic and interactive. :)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Just one thing: 
Be aware that people generally distinguish between typographers (people who use type) and type designers (people who design the typefaces themselves). You will find plenty of both here on Typophile.
Interview questions to typographers might be different from those to type designers. Which exactly is your task – an interview about typography or about type design?</div>

<p>Someone actually said that to me at the office recently. It was hard to not laugh.</p>
<p>Anyway, Biinge, I would recommend researching a type designer you find especially interesting, find his contact information (it’s usually on a web site somewhere) and request and interview. In my experience most type designers don’t get pestered by students too often and are happy to help. You’ll get a much more interesting interview this way because you can write your questions based on that designers body of work.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Hello everyone! Thanks for the help and advice. We were supposed to pick a font that we really like and try to get a hold of the designer for the interview. I love Scriptina font and tried (unsuccessfully) searching for Fred Nader but it led me to an old thread here basically saying there&rsquo;s no way to reach him. But what&rsquo;s more important about that particular thread is that it gave me an idea that there will be more substance to my project if I spent time talking to more than one person about typography/typographers/type designing. I&rsquo;m kind of in the dark here since I have not the slightest idea as to how broad this subject truly is. I didn&rsquo;t even know there&rsquo;s a culture and counter-culture for Helvetica :P</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Mister Segalini, I need the interview for my Typography class presentation. But yes, I want to pursue a career in design and right now I&rsquo;m a student majoring in Fine Arts: Advertising. We basically have to do an interview with a (master) typographer and deliver it to class. My professor said we should pick a font and try to get a hold of the artist. My favorite font is Scriptina and after some research, it turned out (I hope I&rsquo;m not speaking taboo here) that the designer Frederick &ldquo;Apostrophe&rdquo; Nader was quite a controversial guy in the design scene. I&rsquo;m actually digging through old web archives trying to find out as much about Mr. Nader and it dawned on me that the majority of my class would present a standard interview so I might as well do something different by talking about, say, font piracy and such as opposed to generic questions like &ldquo;When did you start designing type?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Who were your influences?&rdquo; etc etc.</p>
<p>The reason I started a thread here was I was looking for voluntary help as it&rsquo;s quite hard to get replies from designers which is understandable. I appreciate everyone&rsquo;s help by the way. :)</p>
