  hanging around, especially on electro and dance merchandise like clubbing posters,
  albums, etc. \r\nI saw this one from a dance compilation of remixes called Sound
  Machine by One Love. Also, it'd be really sweet if anyone could identify the \"One
  Love\" font... sorta reminds me of Daft Punk.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/onelovesoundmachine_6151.jpg]\r\n\r\nEDIT:
  I forgot to post the picture first time around.. but it's weird, I had to use the
  Insert image link, I tried to attach it but every time I pressed attach then submit,
  it never showed up o.O"
