  body: David. <BR>how is it going? <BR>I still have yet to apply for Fabrica and
    time is running out...i gotta get on the ball. <BR> <BR>the &#39;2&#39; looks
    to be exactly the same but the top right accent on the &#39;7&#39; character is
    a little different but i will take your recomendation and use &#34;What the Font&#34;.
    <BR>Thanks, i hope all is well with. <BR> <BR>best.

  body: <i>Well.. I think I am fine.. Thank you.. And, Yea, you really should apply
    for Fabrica.. Do so.. <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/bigsmile.gif"
    border=0></i> <BR> <BR>Youre right about the &#39;7&#39;, being different, but
    there are many slightly different versions of &#39;Fette Fraktur&#39;, available..
    <i>&#40; Or maybe I was completely wrong and just didnt realise it.. &#41;</i>

  body: Well, it isn&#39;t that big of a deal...they look all too similar to turn
    down.  I will purchase Fette Fraktur. <BR> <BR>Yeah i don&#39;t know if you remember
    me, i bought &#39;PlayR&#39; from you a while back and we talked about Fabrica
    in the process.
