  is based in San Diego.\r\n\r\nI took a typographic/lettering approach. The title
  is supposed to look malevolent, dark, menacing. within the letters, there are scared
  teens' faces in there.\r\n\r\ni'd love to hear what you guys have to say about this.
  any suggestions on improvements?\r\nThanks.\r\n"

    to read.\r\nYou might want to try to tone it down a bit. How about a black background
    with red and white type?"

  body: "I think you need to work on the legibility of the lettering a little bit.
    Of course it's meant to be messy but especially the /U/ is nearly invisibly mixed
    into the rest of it - Figuring it out was almost like a puzzle.\r\n\r\nAlso, what's
    with the extreme leading and the full stop in the tagline?"

    i made the lettering more legible, i changed the color, so it doesn't look like
    some kind of murder scene.\r\nHow is the subtitle and author type? i was actually
    having a hard time setting this, i didn't want to do a  totally symmetrical centered
    layout."

  body: "blackquartz, You did not specify how this book is being marketed and sold.
    For books that will not be in bookstores, but will be marketed through the internet
    and sold on Amazon or on the author's site, different rules apply. For these books
    the main point of the cover is to look good as a postage-stamp-and-a-half sized
    image on Amazon or on the website of anyone who will recommend the book. How the
    book cover looks as a book is secondary. This is a little bit sad, but that's
    the current reality. Here are some tips:\r\nhttp://www.thebookdesigner.com/2010/06/top-8-cover-design-tips-for-self-publishers/"

    going to market it. \r\nI think he just wants the cover to look decent in real
    life."
