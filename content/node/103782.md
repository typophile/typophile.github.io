  body: Like this... what? Cut? Because I don't believe it's a font more a custom
    logo made with cut parts of letters. You start with any generic sans of your choice
    ([[http://www.myfonts.com/searchavenir|Avenir]] or [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/myriad|Myriad]]
    which looks quite close in your case), you set alternatively baseline shift to
    -x pt/+x pt and then you apply a mask to isolate the central part, virtually removing
    the unwanted parts.
