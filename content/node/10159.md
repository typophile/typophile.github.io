    target="_blank"> Beta Sans</a>, but nope. This one is rounder. Looks like it could&#39;ve
    been something by Hans Reichel. <BR> <BR>Maybe it&#39;s an announcement for a
    new yet-to-be-released <a href="http://www.fontfont.com/new_release.html" target="_blank">
    FontFont</a>? <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"

    from?

    target="_blank"> Jeremy Tankard</a> designed for the updated logo of -the now
    defunct- Sabena Airlines, though that was obviously a very bold version. See in
    the <i>Design</i> section under <i>Sabena</i>. <BR> <BR>BTW The FontFont remark
    was meant to be a joke, as the chopped off bit of text made for a typical FontFont
    name: FF TheBea. Maybe a Luc&#40;as&#41; de Groot design, the feminine equivalent
    to FF TheSans, TheSerif and TheMix? <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    &#34;Off the beaten path.&#34; Which, coincidentally, is what the font in question
    likely is.'

    light"> <BR> <BR>Linotype calls it Veto, Berthold calls it Evo. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s
    close enough to the first sample that I would wager that British Airways magazine
    commissioned it as a display weight. <BR> <BR>I believe the British music mag
    Q used Evo for a while, too...

  body: 'It occurred to me that since it was spotted being used by British Airways,
    it might be a proprietary face used solely by them. Through a little sleuthing
    I found out that there is a proprietary face that was developed for British Airways
    called Mylius. The sample seen <a href="http://www.agfamonotype.com/custom/ba.asp">here</a>
    isn&#39;t close to the font in question, but supposedly there is a sans as well;
    unfortunately, I couldn&#39;t find any more information about the font or any
    more samples of it. <BR> <BR>Caveat: the font was adopted ten years ago &#40;I
    think&#41;; BA may have changed direction since then.'
