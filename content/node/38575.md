body: "Hi everyone,\r\nI have been going nuts trying to find out what typeface was
  used in Life magazine. Both in its avatar between 1883 and 1936 and later on from
  1936 to 2007. Trade Gothic looks close for the logo but it came about in 1948- while
  the red-white logo came about in 1936. So am very confused!\r\nAlso, would like
  to know what did they use for the text inside? Pre-1936, it looks like some serif
  type while the more contemporary issues seem to have a sans-serif font. \r\nDoes
  anyone have a issue of the Life maagazine from 2005-07? I have never seen one and
  was wondering what the layout is like.\r\n\r\nThanks for you help guys- I hope you
  can crack this in time! \r\n"

    first</a>.\r\nThen, logos or nameplates (I guess that is what you call an avatar)
    often are customly designed, and especially in pre-digital time there hasn\u2019t
    necessarily have to be a font.\r\n\r\nFor the body text \u2013 do you have a sample?
    Are you lookng for something special? I guess they have used some faces over the
    years."

  body: "Thanks guys- you are superb! And fast!\r\nI had seen those forums but on
    searching, I could never find it again!\r\nHowever, it is the following logos
    and text I wanted to ask about- they are from late 1800s and early 1900s. This
    is the earlier version of Life when it was illustration based and this logo is
    the older \"avatar\"! I use avatar a lot mainly because it is a multi faceted
    Indian word and I am from India originally! ;)\r\n\r\nAny ideas if the logo was
    hand drawn or set in type? The text is some serif based typeface- caslon?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/oldLife_3813.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/old_logo_4294.jpg]"

  body: oh, sorry for the quality of the images- I took it off from a microfilm so
    thats why it is crappy- and I did not resize it any further as it was getting
    heavily pixelated.

  body: "The text face in the first sample is what was generically called \"old style\".
    Most foundries had some version of this (sort of like Times Roman nowadays). There
    are some digital versions of this style: <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/binny-old-style-mt/\">Binny
    Old Style</a>, <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/old-style-mt/\">Monotype
    Old Style</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/old-style-7/\">Linotype
    Old Style No. 7</a>.\r\n\r\n\"HIGHBROW NUMBER\" appears to be an old ATF face
    called Post Oldstyle No. 2. I don't know of a digital version. The price and date
    text on the right side is <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/cheltenham/\">Cheltenham
    Old Style</a>.\r\n\r\nThe logo is definitely custom-drawn. This was very common
    back then due to the fact that metal typefaces were very limited in terms of available
    size and styles. "

    the sunday life magazine that was published till earlier this year? I need to
    see what kind of a grid they used for the layout- unfortunately, I haven't seen
    any of these versions."

  body: Wow, I don't know where you might find those. Earlier issues, from when it
    was a regular magazine, would probably be available at libraries in the U.S. The
    Sunday newspaper supplement incarnation has probably all ended up in recycling
    bins.

    NUMBER' (based upon the Saturday Evening Post's logotype from the 20's).
