  a german student of communications-design studying for one year in Barcelona. And
  here I have a great typography-work to do. \r\n\r\nI want to work out a book about
  slab serif-fonts. History, characteristics, interviews, examples of usage, etc.\r\nBut
  it seems as if there is no information out there. \r\n\r\nIt's a great topic and
  I learned to love slabs, but it's still very dificult to find usable texts, discussions,
  or examples (with background information).\r\n\r\nNaturally I found something in
  the web and in books buts it's still very little. \r\n\r\nDoes anybody know any
  writings, links or books that could help me? Somebody knows detailed history facts
  and examples, or has written something he would like to show me?\r\nDoesn't matter
  if it's english, german or spanish, ever piece is very welcome.\r\n\r\nI found nice
  information about the IBM-logo, have two interview-partners, and found other stuff,
  but there must be more.\r\nWhere is a detailed story about a font in particular,
  where are nice-to-know- and funny things? why I cannot find who made the serif-kodak-logos
  or all the others?\r\nwhere are the experts?\r\n\r\nIt would be really great if
  I would receive some hints out of this lively forum.\r\nThanks to all of you.\r\n\r\n\r\nGreetings,\r\n\r\nRobin"

      here. And its my best material until now. \r\n\r\nMaybe someone has different
      opinion about something written there?\r\nWhere do a serif begin to be slab
      in your thoughts?\r\n\r\nOr someone knows additional history facts. Or just
      has some goodies for my work (pics etc)\r\n\r\nWork goes on.\r\n\r\nRobin\r\n"

  body: "Barcelona, eh? Lucky hund.\r\n\r\nYou might say that the seeds for the slab
    serif (like those of\r\nso many other features in type) were planted with the
    RdR.\r\n\r\n> Where do a serif begin to be slab in your thoughts?\r\n\r\nWhen
    its top edge is [nearly] flat. (And the bottom one too I guess.)\r\nOtherwise
    it's a wedge serif (pointed or sheared). A special case of\r\nthe slab serif though
    is when it's very thin, in which case I think\r\nit's better to call it hairline.
    But of course grays abound.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    body: "s\xED, definitly lucky, you know the reasons hrant\r\n\r\nthank you all
      so much for your help. more of this, typophile!\r\n\r\nthats interesting what
      you comment, hrant. I never would have thought in the RdR. The edge is flat
      but the edges are rounded there, no? Like the serifs seem not that long there,
      it forms nearly an wedge serif. But I Haven't found a good image to look nearer.\r\n\r\nThe
      second one is even more interesting. I heard definitions, and it was mine too,
      that the serifs nearly has to be as bold as the main stroke (optically). If
      not, Bodoni would be slab, but Lino Letter and The Serif wouldn't.\r\nIn Germany
      \ Slabs are called \"serifenbetonte Linear-Antiqua\". That means that their
      serifs\r\nare stressed, what normaly means that they have to be big.\r\nWhat
      do you think?\r\n\r\nAnd thanks to for your Hairline opinion. Now fits to this
      discussion about the definition of slabs. (that hopefully will go on with even
      more people)\r\n\r\nMuchas gracias y/und Dankesch\xF6n.\r\nand sorry for my
      english if I really did such mistakes as I think.\r\n\r\nrobin"

  body: "> The edge is flat but the edges are rounded there, no?\r\n\r\nThe RdR has
    adnate serifs, yes. But I think the key concept\r\nbehind the slab serif is its
    <cite>separation</cite> from the stem, and\r\nto me it seems this is the archetypical
    RdR logic, to treat\r\nletterform elements as things that exist independently
    (as\r\nopposed to arising from a continous flow [of a marking tool]),\r\nelements
    that come together and fuse. But in fact I'm merely\r\nguessing that there is
    a connection there.\r\n\r\nAnother possibility (although typographic chronology
    might\r\nrefute this) is that slabs came about as a result of wanting to\r\ntack
    on serifs to sans forms.\r\n\r\n> the serifs nearly has to be as bold as the main
    stroke\r\n\r\nCertainly the typical slab is pretty thick. But \"looking ahead\"\r\nterminologically
    I worry about what to call the non-thick ones!  :-/\r\nSo to me it seems best
    to call them all slabs, but some \"thick\"\r\nand some \"thin\" (and some \"hairline\",
    but for that without\r\nneeding to also have \"slab\" in there).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
