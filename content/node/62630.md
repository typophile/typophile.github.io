body: Can anyone identify the font used in the logo on this matchbook? The closest
  I've been able to get is Shardee, but it's not quite right. If the font is one that's
  not available, is there one with a similar feel? Thanks![img:sites/default/files/old-images/MatchPack_5784.jpg]

  body: I'm impressed by the type-identifying skills on this site, and surprised that
    no one has come up with the old-timey font on the Vis-a-pac Co. matchbook. Identifont
    suggested Linotype Coronet. Again, close but not quite the same. Anyone have any
    better ideas? Thanks in advance. - Caroline

  body: If you squint real hard, the thinnest parts of the first <strong>a</strong>
    look thinner than the corresponding parts of the second <strong>a</strong>. So,
    probably hand-drawn, but Coronet or Nuptial Script should get you in the ballpark.

  body: You're right about the "a"s - I didn't notice that. Nuptial Script is a good
    suggestion. Thanks!
