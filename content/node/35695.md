  body: "It is hard to tell for sure with that separated sample, but I think it is
    CAC Lasko Condensed. It might have other names. I'll add to this if I fond more:\r\n\r\nCloser
    reading says it is an American Greetings font. Which would seem to be a sort of
    commercial font, so I am removing the link. The name will get you back there if
    necessary."
