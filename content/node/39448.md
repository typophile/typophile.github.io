  body: First thing I thought of was H&FJ's <a href="http://typography.com/fonts/font_styles.php?productLineID=100023">Shades</a>
    series, but it's none of those. Nor is it <a href="http://www.veer.com/partner/link.aspx?i=1048&c=4&p=products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000296">PowerStation</a>.

    to draw prismatic type</a> over at Letterhead Fonts. Doesn't AA use some hand-drawn
    stuff too?
