  body: "There are books that contain beautiful examples, such as John Dreyfus's book
    on Van Krimpen, as well as material by Van Krimpen himself. You will probably
    have to go to a research library to get examples of the original letter press
    version. \r\n\r\nThe promised revival by [[http://www.dutchtypelibrary.nl/|Dutch
    Type Library]] has been going on for a long time, and they have an impressive
    PDF of it on their site, including some optical sizes. However, they don't seem
    to have released it. I have no idea why. \r\n\r\nIn the original metal it was
    one of the most beautiful types ever. As has been commented on by an number of
    observers, the sloped roman was a failure in that it is rather bland and flat.
    The evaluation by Walter Tracy in \"Letters of Credit\" is fascinating, a must-read
    if you are interested in Van Krimpen's work. The associated formal script type,
    Canceresca Bastarda, was also really beautiful. \r\n\r\nI think that it would
    be much more usable if DTL would create a proper companion italic, based on structurally
    similar designs of Van Krimpen (such as the Haarlemmer, which they have already
    done). \r\n\r\nI would suggest e-mailing DTL. Let us know what you find out. \r\n\r\nOnce
    in a while Frank Blokland comes on Typophile, so maybe he'll comment.  "

  body: "thanx for the dutch library. i was on that site before and was discouraged
    by the language, but i found that pdf and it will be of great help. i don't think
    i'll be mailing them because my focus will be on the original thirties romulus
    type and it's history.\r\n\r\ni saw a couple of books by and on van krimpen, but
    sadly there are no libraries in my country that have books like that. i tried
    finding some chapters on the web (earlier i found some gerrit noordzij on the
    net) but no luck.\r\n\r\ni found a neat van krimpen bio by years if someone's
    interested: [[http://www.amethystvisions.com/portfolio/jvk_booklet_final.pdf]]\r\n\r\nif
    anyone knows a recognizable logotype in romulus, that would be very useful too."
