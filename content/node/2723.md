  for a few months. I&#39;ve been having a crack at my first &#39;serious&#39; typeface.
  My plan was to create two basic weights for use as a book face - regular and bold.
  Peculiarly I started creating a bold weight first &#40;don&#39;t ask me why&#41;,
  and at this point have only designed the lowercase. I have a great deal to learn
  and no doubt have made many mistakes - I&#39;d appreciate your help putting me on
  the straight and narrow.  <BR> <BR>many thanks<!--attachment: book_first-24190.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*16.6*lowercase+%2d+bold*book_first%2epdf

  body: In order to be used in books, at those point sizes used, don&#39;t you think
    you need more modulation? Typefaces with monoline character shapes general start
    to blend when they get to be too small. <BR> <BR>My 2 bits.

    to be honest. Perhaps it does need more modulation though.

  body: 'Well, it&#39;s not totally monoline, but it&#39;s not a book face either.
    The extenders are generous enough to play a positive role in readability, but
    it&#39;s still a sans &#40;with narrow, constructed forms to boot&#41;, so I wouldn&#39;t
    set too much text in it. Display? Definitely. <BR> <BR>&#62; Peculiarly I started
    creating a bold weight first &#40;don&#39;t ask me why&#41; <BR> <BR>I tend to
    draw dakish glyphs to begin a design too - I guess it what appeals to you, plus
    the fact that drawing large glyphs is display-centric: you have to tame your aesthetic
    preferences in order to draw a text face [large]. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: hmmm... bugger - I had thought I had curbed my aesthetic preferences sufficiently.
    So what we&#39;re looking at is that I should be creating wider letterforms with
    more modulation in order to get on track with a book face? thankyou both for your
    time

    Extremely well done in fact. The proportions are good. The color is even. Your
    sense of optical width vs. actual width is great. You&#39;ve taken time to put
    in alot of the subtleties. <BR> <BR>First we gotta define what we mean by book
    face. I bet you don&#39;t mean you plan to set A Tale of Two Cities in this font.
    Nor &#40;judging from the thread title&#41; did you mean that this is intended
    specifically for use in children&#39;s books. I&#39;m guessing you meant that
    you can use this font for short passages of text. Or even more generally, not
    just a display face.  <BR> <BR>I think you&#39;ve done that. If want it to work
    better below 12pt you probably want to consider a bit more width, and perhaps
    a bit more modulation. As a side note: I&#39;m tempted to say this looks very
    much like many existing fonts. But really, who cares? This is a place to start,
    and it looks nice. Press on. <BR> <BR>Randy'

    Maybe it&#39;s just a matter of being cautious &#40;anal?&#41; with terms: to
    me &#34;book face&#34; means a font that can be used to set a book without causing
    rejection &#40;conscious or subconscious&#41; on the part of the reader before
    the book finishes! I tend to have a narrow definition of &#34;book face&#34; &#40;although
    in some ways it&#39;s actually much broader than usual - like in &#34;allowing&#34;
    unorthodox structures&#41;: it needs serifs, and the color and width have to be
    within a certain range. Plus it all has to correspond - like a darkish font works
    better small which means the x-height has to be bigger, the forms looser and wider,
    etc. <BR> <BR>You shouldn&#39;t abandon this design, not at all! It&#39;s already
    nice and firm. Just move it towards more display usage - which still means some
    people will use it for short text - which is fine - usage is out of our hands
    anyway. Practically this might mean things like making the terminals of the &#34;a&#34;,
    &#34;c&#34; and &#34;s&#34; congruent, making the &#34;k&#34; more elemental,
    etc. <BR> <BR>As for pulling it away from existing designs, one interesting place
    you could do that is in the caps. I&#39;ve recommended this before to others:
    look at uncial structures if you really want to make a convincing innovation in
    caps that are conformant to the lc - conventionally they&#39;re like two separate
    creatures. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: You&#39;re both right in raising questions over my use of the term &#39;book
    face&#39;. You&#39;re right randy, I don&#39;t intend on using it to set A Tale
    of Two cities - I had in mind much short blocks of text <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> What would be a better description if it is not exclusively
    for display or setting short passages? I realised from the outset that its width
    could inhibit readability at small sizes but had in mind that it would save space
    and hoped to find a healthy balance. I think now looking back, as you said Hrant,
    I was paying too much attention to my aesthetic preferences with regards to the
    modulation.  <BR> <BR>I agree randy - it does look like a lot of existing fonts.
    Like you say, it&#39;s a place to start - I didn&#39;t set out to make an original
    contribution to type design with it. How could I if I couldn&#39;t get something
    like this down properly? Hopefully I&#39;ll be able to one day. <BR> <BR>I really
    like the idea of referencing uncial structures as an innovative alternative to
    standard caps. I think for this project I&#39;ll keep orthodox caps but I will
    certainly not forget that idea. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not all that familiar with the
    your terminology when you suggest making the K more &#39;elemental&#39;. I think
    I&#39;m on same hymn sheet but it&#39;s best to clarify <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
