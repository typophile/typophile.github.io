    an old American typeface, but the URW version has the 'g' ear going the wrong
    way. So I pointed you to the Ascender version.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "For your capital R sketch, it's hard to decide how close to your sketch you
    want the font to be. There is a whole spectrum of variations from very simple
    to rather ornate that could resemble that general shape. You could check various
    parts of my Script Font ID Guide, especially parts 7, 8 and 13, but almost any
    part could have a few fonts with similar R shapes. I picked three different styles
    just as examples: Rob Leuschke's <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typesetit/oh-ley/\">Oh
    Ley</a> for a fun, casual interpretation; the handwriting font <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/miss-le-gatees/\">Miss
    Le Gatees</a>, from Sudtipos, and the wildly elaborate display script <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/affair/\">Affair</a>,
    also from Sudtipos, which has many alternates.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
