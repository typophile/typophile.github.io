    a sitting on a chair pretending to be a CAPITAL :)\r\n\r\nAs for the numbers:
    I think the 9 and the 6 are not quite there yet. The 6 looks like an 8 with a
    bit missing. Maybe you can use a bit more angular approach, like the P or the
    D. \r\n\r\nKeep it up!\r\n\r\ncheerio Queneau"

  body: "Hello again Queneau,\r\n\r\nFont Archeology, nice words :). Yes, I would
    like to revive these Old Romanian typefaces.\r\n\r\nBeside these historic types
    I do have some sketches of my own for other typefaces trying to bring them in
    the new and modern trend and keeping the old tradition. They will have to wait
    for now.\r\n\r\nYou are right about the numbers and also about the A for which
    indeed I had the same feeling.\r\n\r\nI\u0163ll be back with these corrections.\r\n\r\nThank
    you very much for your comments."

  body: "I would have the same comment about the number 6 and 9 they look out of the
    typeface. Look at the O, P, Q it could be helpfull to draw the latter. There also
    something interesting to start with the C and the G. You could work on the 3 too.
    Keep going.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9 "

    one of the variants would be better?"

  body: "I think the second row is better, it's certainly an improvement. But I think
    they still need some work, as they still look a bit 'unsure', especially the 9
    and 6. Try to experiment with the size and shape of the bowls. As for the 3, though
    I like the 3 in the first row better, the second one fits better with the rest.
    Maybe you can take the bowl of the 1st one, and make the top side more 'edgy',
    it's just too rounded now. Just keep at it!\r\n\r\nHope this helps.\r\n\r\ncheerio

  body: "I have adjusted them.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2 numere corecturi_5602.jpg]\r\nThese
    is the last update.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/3 numere corecturi_6633.jpg]\r\nAnd
    these are the testings I have done.\r\nOut of them I think the best are chosen
    above.\r\n\r\nI feel them more closer together (same family, unity).\r\nNow I
    think the number 4 has too little space inside.\r\nMaybe I'll adjust that too.\r\nNumber
    8 is also a bit strange. Maybe I'll try something for it too.\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\nThank
    you very much Queneau."

    font I'm having a hard time thinking how to improve it. \r\nW looks very plain.
    What about a chunky slab serif on the middle apex?"

  body: "@Bendy\r\n\r\nThanks for your comment.\r\nW is not a regular letter for romanian
    so it is sort of artificially created and added. Maybe some vertical flip of would
    have been more appropriate. \r\nI don't know if a serif, even a slab one, would
    be suited.\r\nI will try it and post it here.\r\n\r\nThanks again."
