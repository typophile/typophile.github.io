body: Hello everyone! I am an extreme newbie, so please forgive my total ignorance.
  I'm a graphic designer who is just starting to experiment with font design for fun.
  I'm using TypeTool 3 and I have a question about codepages. How does one go about
  deciding what codepage to build a font in? TypeTool defaults to 'MS Windows 1252
  Western' but I don't understand how or why I would choose that codepage over say
  'Latin 2' (of course, Cyrillic, Greek, Turkish, etc codepages have an obvious use).
  Like I said, I'm sure the answer is obvious - thank you so much for your help!

    more of a tool to subset the full Unicode range down to something fathomable.\r\n\r\nFor
    a basic western Latin font, I suggest switching among several encodings to form
    a character set that is a superset of Latin 1 (iso 8859-1), Latin 0 (iso 8859-15),
    MacRoman and Windows Latin (MS Windows 1252 Western). I use FontForge so the menu
    labels are slightly different, but I think they correspond.\r\n\r\nThere are certain
    glyph slots that need to be filled for Windows and maybe other OSs for a font
    to be recognized as valid, and I am reasonably sure that the above superset covers
    those (and much more, perhaps too much). I'll have to pore through some references
    to confirm. I should have this committed to memory but that doesn't work as well
    as it used to.\r\n\r\nAside from that, other encodings include glyphs for various
    language support extensions, but even they relate more to legacy teletype systems
    rather than real language requirements."

    that I said.
