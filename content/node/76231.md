    posting this.\r\n\r\nAs the assignment are to be handed in tomorrow at 10 (in
    about 10 hours), I thought that the quicker I got a post up here, the better chances
    would be for getting some less obvious knowledge.\r\n\r\nBut thanks anyways.\r\n\r\n\r\n-quite
    an interesting font really...\r\n\r\n\r\nJ."

    posting to the General Discussions area. BTW, Friday nights generally tend to
    be rather quiet.
