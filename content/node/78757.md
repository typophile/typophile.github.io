  body: "It seems close to the italic of <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/modern-extended/\">Modern
    Extended</a> or even <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/de-vinne/\">De
    Vinne</a>, but as more of a display version with finer terminals. To me this suggests
    a customized version that started as one of these, or perhaps someone else's version
    of one of these fonts, or a font based on Century that was designed for display
    purposes.\r\n\r\nI looked at Bodoni's and Didot's but the top serif of the 'l'
    was never bracketed like this one.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
