  body: "James, I recently did a project with MS specifying a glyph set for a pan-African
    UI font (much of the work based on research I originally did for them in 1998).
    I've got reasonably good data for about 200 African languages (mostly in paper
    form); from this research and from discussions on software Africanisation forums
    I've long since come to the conclusion that trying to target specific language
    coverage is a bad idea unless the number of languages is small. OpenType GPOS
    mark positioning makes it relatively easy to target the majority of African languages
    without needing to compile data about individual languages, which is difficult
    to come by.\r\n\r\nNote that some diacritic letters needed for African alphabets
    are not individually encoded in Unicode: they rely on combining mark characters.
    These can be handled using GSUB in the ccmp feature, but it is much more flexible
    to handle them with GPOS mark positioning.\r\n\r\nI gave a presentation on Latin
    glyphs for African fonts as part of a workshop with MS and Diane Collier at TypeCon
    in Buffalo (other presentations dealt with indigenous African writing systems).
    I've uploaded my slides to \r\n\r\nhttp://www.tiro.com/John/African%20Presentation.pdf\r\n\r\nI
    don't know how useful they are without commentary, but feel free to contact me
    if you have questions."

  body: PS. The various 'standard' pan-African alphabets shown in the early slides
    are mainly of historical interest, since none have been adopted as shown here,
    although the Africa Institute alphabet forms the basis of the majority of modern
    African orthographies.

  body: "I think some of the orthographies are still in flux. I remember back in the
    early 1990s when a book designer needed some Pan-Nigerian characters. Zapf had
    made a font for Pan Nigerian, but the designer want to use something different.\r\n\r\nSomebody
    with some official connections got involved in all this, and I was told that when
    a unified Pan Nigerian character set was first proposed, some people wanted a
    dot under characters (e,i,o, & s, I believe); others wanted a bar below. A compromise
    was reached, whereby a bar with rounded corners was used -- it could also be thought
    of as an extended dot. Anyway, I made the characters up with that mark.\r\n\r\nLast
    year we set a book which had some Pan Nigerian, and at first, the author wanted
    those old marks, but in proof changed to wanting the dots, as shown at \r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-Nigerian_Alphabet\r\n\r\nFWIW\r\n\r\n"

  body: "John, that was a very interesting capital eh, eth?  I noticed that from the
    Wiki page on the African Reference Alphabet, there are two letters each with the
    same Icelandic capital form, but with different minuscules. In the table you have,
    there are two different capital forms.  Is this from lack of distinction in modern
    fonts, or that no one language uses both letters so no need to distinguish, or
    lack of support by the language users? \r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea

  body: "The Niamey African Reference Alphabet has a number of problems, and so far
    as I can tell it was never widely adopted. In particular, I've not seen the lowercase
    eth form used in any African texts, so I think this introduction -- and the innovative
    uppercase form to distinguish it from the barred D -- was a non-starter. The display
    in the chart on the Wikipedia page shows a Croatian-style barred lowercase d instead
    of an eth as in the original Niamey document, adding to the confusion. In all
    the African orthographies I researched, the \u0189 was the uppercase of \u0256.\r\n\r\nIf
    you look at <a href=\"http://www.bisharat.net/Documents/Niamey78annex.htm\">Don
    Osborne's page on the Niamey alphabet</a>, you'll see that the French language
    version of the report did not show any uppercase letters. One of the books I consulted
    in my research in 1998 was <em>A thesaurus of African languages</em> by Mann and
    Dalby, the (English language) text of which is set in all lowercase letters. It
    presents a revised African Reference Alphabet that incorporates new letters proposed
    by the authors, including the inverted v as an a vowel variant.\r\n\r\n"
