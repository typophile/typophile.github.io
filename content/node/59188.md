body: "Dear Typophiles,\r\n\r\nI'm creating a calendar as a table in InDesign and
  would like the cells of the header column (months) to have rounded corners on the
  left side. Is this possible or should I create the header column as a separate set
  of aligned boxes (not part of the table)?\r\n\r\nThanks,"

    Rounded Box and Table.  I had to do something similar but with triangles.  If
    any variations happen within the table... man... everything needs adjusting.  :T\r\n\r\nbest

  body: Yup, I did it with external boxes rounded on one side, then some of the rows
    had to change height and I had to rearrange all the boxes...I wonder if there'll
    be more options for cells in future releases.

  body: I have inserted a box inside a cell (and a bar code inside that). It works
    ok as long as the cells stay the same size.
