  body: "This could turn out to be very useful. I especially like the way there are
    references at the foot of the page.\r\n\r\nI was plotting stem weight graphs recently,
    from large type families (including Soho, Apex, Guardian, Unit), and found that,
    instead of the weight differences increasing more in the blacker weights, the
    difference dropped off again, making an s-shaped curve with smaller differences
    at the extremes and larger steps between the weights around the middle. I supposed
    that this because the optical effect is bigger in the extreme weights: hairlines
    are noticeably different of course with only a few units added to stems, and presumably
    the same applies to hairline counters in the fattest weights. In the middle of
    a family, a couple of units will neither increase the stem weight nor decrease
    the counter sizes enough to warrant the inclusion of a new weight. \r\n\r\nThis
    suggests to me that there are very divergent models of how the weight can be added,
    and wonder if there are any other references about this, or whether other models
    can be included in the calculator.\r\n\r\nI wonder if a preview function would
    be especially neat, using a live multi-master to generate instances? (Though that
    may be horrible to put together!)"

  body: "So I figured to field-test this thing. Ernestine* doesn't have a lot of weights
    (only 4) but the exact determination of those four weights was a result of an
    unusual degree of back-and-forth refinement between three different parties (Nina,
    FSI and myself) so I think it makes for a decent test case.\r\n\r\n* http://ernestinefont.com/\r\n\r\nMy
    suspicion that this algorithm is not complex enough -even within a text range-
    was confirmed; weights work largely in pairs, something not incorporated into
    this algorithm. One would need to use this algorithm in a more sophisticated way,
    possibly by running two parallel weight ranges that somehow intermesh. I did however
    manage to come up with a <em>progression</em> that nicely yields Ernestine's numbers:\r\n\r\nI
    put 53 (the Light) and 120 (the Bold) and 4 steps. The \"25%\" column came up
    with a Regular stem value (74) that matched, however the value for the Demi was
    way too light. So I ran it again from 74 to 120, but again with 4 steps (not 3)
    and then the \"Luc(as) Style\" column had the correct third value (the second
    interpolated one) which is 102.\r\n\r\nI believe I can reuse this progression
    to emulate the nice weight distribution of Ernestine in the future, but how to
    extend it to a face with more than 4 weights?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    \r\n\u221A(53 \xD7 102) = 73,53 (rounded to 74)\r\n\r\nThe one that is not progressive,
    is your last one (120). \r\nAnd that's totally OK. As it's a (subjective/personal/what

    light enough, or that your bold is not bold enough, or whatever... And at the
    end, it's a matter of (personal preference/what looks best to your eye/what work
    best in a certain situation or medium may not work in another different situation
    or medium) as there is not perfect solutions that can please all people in all
    different situations in all different mediums.\r\n\r\nThis little tool is not

    for version3, is something like this:\r\nFirst Column: Equal Steps\r\nLast Column:
    Progressive Steps\r\nAnd only one column in the middle, with a \"slider\" that
    you can use to move form 1% to 99% (replacing the 25%, 50% and 75% columns) so
    you can really explore all the space between Equal Steps and Luc(as) theory.\r\n\r\nWhy
    the slider?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/grafico1_5579.png]\r\nThe first

    space\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/grafico3_5426.png]\r\nIn the
    next version, the Slider, will allow you to explore ALL the intermediate space
    (green area). Basically, because the best options may be at 66%, 72%, 82% or whatever
    other value (depending on how big or how small is the Thin-Black difference)."

    a graph showing aggregated data. All data is aligned on step 4, the regular weight,

    relatively lighter middle weights (when in fact I think they're preferring relatively
    heavier dark weights). I've added a trend line in black (following the median

    the extremes. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/graph1_6051.jpg]\r\n\r\nHopefully

    the equations are not fitted. What I've done for each family, is to show the real
    weight distribution compared to Equal Steps and Lucas Steps calculated specifically
    for each family, in order <strong>to focus on the curve shape</strong>. So that
    it can be isolated of the number of steps, or of the Black-Thin difference.\r\n\r\nThe
    result shows a lot of different approaches, but overall I think that it's starting
    to show a general S-shape trend: \r\n- Stay near Lucas values in the Thinnest
    weights.\r\n- Move closer to 50% for the middle weights.\r\n- Move closer to Equal
    Steps in the bolder weights.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are notable exceptions:\r\n-
    Soho: Inverted S-shape (Thinner weights close to Equal steps, Medium close to
    50%, Black close to Lucas).\r\n- Myriad: Really big steps from Thin to Medium,
    Really short steps form Medium to Black.\r\n- Apex, Freight, Stag: Short steps
    first, then a big jump, then short steps again.\r\n\r\nWe both agree that more
    data will help. But the number of weights should not be of much importance, as
    the formula has to work well with any number of steps, font 3 to \u221E\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The reason I think the number of weights is important is simply to show more
    of the curve (there's less data at weights 1 and 9 on my graph). Families with
    9 or more weights will get into the really bold bolds and the really thin hairlines,
    and so reveal whether the progression curves upward or downward at those extremes.
    It's entirely possible all three models (equal steps, Luc(as) and the s-shaped
    curve) are correct, just concerned with different weight ranges, looking at the
    curve with different levels of zoom if you like.\r\n\r\nSoho is a strange thing.
    I would almost want to exclude that ultrablack from analysis for being such an
    outlier, with stems about 80 units wider than the median for any other fattest
    weight. It could even have been designed independently. Myriad is definitely interesting,
    as it seems to contradict all three theories by adding larger steps in the middle
    of the family. Those other three have the big jump exactly at the regular weight,
    either to the next weight down or the next weight up. As Hrant pointed out, those
    adjacent weights are not designed to be used together, which must factor in to
    the weight progression."
