body: '&#34;Cassandre continued designing until his suicide in 1968, shortly after
  the rejection of a futuristic and innovative typefont by a German publisher &#40;the
  rejection letter lay open on Cassandre&#39;s desk when his body was discovered&#41;.&#34;
  <BR> <BR>What was this type design?'

    target="_blank">this</a> which has me talking about it again and Hrant mentioning
    Metop &#40;which was originally called Cassandre and posthumously name Metop,
    I believe&#41;. <BR> <BR>I found <a href="http://blogia.com/visiondetunel/index.php?idarticulo=200411251"
    target="_blank">this</a> talking about the same thing. &#40;Search for &#34;metop&#34;&#41;

  body: Yeah, that. <BR>Peignot was a success, so not a good occasion to kill yourself.
    <BR> <BR>BTW, an hour or two after his suicide I was born.  :-&#62; <BR>I guess
    the Big Guy ;-&#41; wanted continuity in the alphabet reform effort &#40;that&#39;s
    what Peignot really is&#41; - it&#39;s just a shame his <i>talent</i> didn&#39;t
    make the trip from Germany to Lebanon that night... <BR> <BR>hhp
