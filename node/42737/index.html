		<div class="commentbody"><P>Before we begin thinking the GHD IV Styler is following the same trend as video & DVD players, lets take just show just a few major differences. Firstly, the GHD IV Styler has almost nothing realistic competition. The GHD IV styler is widely regarded for a consumer and high end (hairdressers) while the number 1 hair styling tool.Secondly, as techniology developes the money necessary production reduces thus retail prices reduce. Well my answer suggestions that GHD haven’t handed over, any reduction in production costs with the retailer (salon owners). In fact cost prices have gone up resulting from <a href="http://www.louisvuittonpursebag.com/"><strong>louis vuitton bags</strong></a>  a surge in the RRP. Here we are at in the event the GHD MK1 to <a href="http://www.coachfactoryoutleti.org/"><strong>coach factory outlet</strong></a>  Mk3 were discounted one of the a RRP of ??99, the actual MK4 GHD styler provides a RRP of ??119.</P><P></P><P>Exactly what continues to be lowering the retail prices? The result we have found simple. Online competition, with online retailer endeavoring to out do eath other ghd hair straightener for being the lowest priced website for GHD IV Styler . I personally, work at a hairdressing salon <a href="http://www.coachoutletonlinepicke.com/"><strong>coach outlet online</strong></a>  and i know which price range of GHD IV Styler. Despite that these web based stores receive massive discounts on there products, they could still merely be making between <a href="http://www.coachoutletonline-bag.com/"><strong>coach outlet online</strong></a>  ??6-8 a hard and fast and perhaps any loss. I possed this with a senior GHD worker from a GHD event in the year. Her response, was which she believed, people were with their company as loss leaders to operate individuals to there sites. In the hope they retain the prospect for <a href="http://www.buyscoachoutletonline.net/"><strong>coach outlet online</strong></a>  future purchases of hair & bath and body goods.I cannot really buy into this theory.Lots of individuals will for sure invest in a straightners without additional shampoos and styling products. So, i’m not really really sure the way this works, in the form of long-term business strategy. The very first thing for several though, would be that the consumer might be gaining from these reduced prices. </P><P></P><P>In order <a href="http://www.coachpurseoutletss.net/"><strong>cheap coach purses</strong></a>  to find out about GHD and locate the ideal price on GHD hair straighteners, <a href="http://www.cheapcoachbagusas.com/"><strong>cheap coach purses</strong></a>  then visit our website GHD IV Styler Stockists.Stories about Britney Spears and her hair disasters are not uncommon, but was damage to britney’s hair just before the infamous shaving incident caused buy faulty, broken or damaged ghd hair straighteners? Faulty ghd’s usually are not all that uncommon and so they can on occasions over-heat and cause terminal damage to curly hair. Maybe Britney must have used a ghd repair service, there are a couple companies these days which can participate in a ghd repair shop with regard to ??19.95 likely the biggest ghd repair company in england and wales is Ion Originals Ltd. they run websites that include www.ghdrepair.co.uk It is advisable to get those ghd’s inspected they were eradicated or become faulty.Common ghd faults include: sparking, buzzing, intermittent power, cable faults & over-heating. </P><P></P></div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I disagree. This topic has come up before, ever since the update last summer which has caused edited posts to drop to the bottom and therefore out of context.</p>
<p>It was a long tradition on the Type ID board for people to post a quick ID and then go back in and add the link. The edit feature was very important there.</p>
<p>I often reread my posts and edit for spelling, grammar and clarity. I only (now) do this when there isn&rsquo;t another post after mine, but there have been MANY times when I&rsquo;ve wished I could change or add something and have refrained for fear of the thread not making sense.</p>
<p>Additionally there have been times when I&rsquo;ve said something in the heat of the moment and later regretted it. In those cases where I edit for content, I always indicate that I have done so.</p>
<p>My suggestion would be to allow the edit feature as before, where the comment remains in its proper order in the thread, but for there to be a way for readers to know that the comment has been edited.</p>

<p>Dux; I guess the moral of the story is you should cut and paste a quote from the message you&rsquo;re responding to in your own message. Unfortunately that will make the threads longer than they&rsquo;d need to be.
But you&rsquo;re right, otherwise someone who doesn&rsquo;t agree with you could edit their comment after you&rsquo;ve replied and completely change the meaning of your response.</p>

<p>Mods should always reserve the right to edit an offending post. That&rsquo;s not the issue here. The issue is that people can fundamentally change an entire conversation unfairly. I&rsquo;ve seen it done, MANY times, here on Typophile.</p>
<p>Being able to edit spelling and grammar errors is one thing, materially changing the intent and content of a post is another. A time element sounds like the best idea to me. You have 24 hours to edit your post. After that? You go down in cache as the stupidest jerk face ever.</p>

<p>And if that happens to be 2.3 seconds after you make your own post?</p>
<p>It’s so easy to miss a typo or a left-out word while typing that it should always be possible to come back to correct your misfortunes, whether someone else has posted since or not. Imposing a time limit (24 hours works quite well on most board I’ve frequented that have time limits) is a good compromise. If you haven’t caught your typo within 24 hours, chances are no one else has, either; and your options for attempting to alter the outlook of the thread for posterity are limited.</p>
<p>And naturally all edits should be visible. The most efficient way I’ve seen of doing this is the Wikipedia-style way of displaying edits. In it, a string of text will be automatically inserted into the post, along the lines of, “Last edited on Wed 23 July 2007 by Poster. Edited 5 times in total. <a href="#">View post history.</a>”</p>
<p>With this system, not only can all viewers see when the post was last edited and by whom, but if they so wish, they can also view an entire threaded display of previous versions of the post, with typos, vitriol, broken HTML, and whatever gems may be lurking in the hidden shadows quite intact. It makes it impossible to completely alter the way a thread looks for posterity, since the original remarks will always be visible. It also forces the poster to consider that previous actions are visible when editing, so turning, “You are such a moron” into, “I’ve always really liked you” doesn’t work. Instead, one would have to find other workarounds, such as, “Heat-of-the-moment personal attack removed with apologies”.</p>

<p>Your example of the client is a fine example of why one would want to change a past thread. However, it seems as if that would be something that an admin could do upon request fairly easily/willingly.</p>

<p>Aluminum, you make a very good point. If I edit a post I make it a point to add &ldquo;[EDIT]&rdquo; before the amendment, but you&rsquo;re right&hellip; I hadn&rsquo;t really thought of that. Some of the responses to <a href="http://www.designobserver.com/archives/030925.html">a recent Design Observer post by Steve Heller, asking for people to start using their real names when commenting</a>, seems to bear this out.</p>

<p>Thanks Patty. I have no idea why I don&rsquo;t use that, as it&rsquo;s right next to the &ldquo;Post comment&rdquo; button.
Perhaps because &ldquo;Preview comment&rdquo; is grammatically ambiguous?
I&rsquo;ve read it many times, but it&rsquo;s never meant anything to me (software interfaces can have that effect).
Maybe it&rsquo;s the redundancy of the word &ldquo;comment&rdquo; that I find offensive?
I&rsquo;m not sure whether I&rsquo;ll use it, though, it&rsquo;s more exciting not to.</p>
<p>And even so, the Preview doesn&rsquo;t show one&rsquo;s comment <em>in situ,</em> so it lacks that page-layout reality.</p>

<p>See my previous post. It&rsquo;s not an issue of editing&hellip;but allowing indefinite editing.</p>
<p>John: I don&rsquo;t think anyone is saying get rid of the editing feature&hellip;rather, just put a limit on it&hellip;give people x hours/days/weeks to make their edit. (dux&rsquo;s 24 hours seems like a fine suggestion). If one can&rsquo;t properly form/edit their thoughts in a period of hours or days, then they probably never will. ;0)</p>
<p>Any &lsquo;emergency&rsquo; edits after that fact (which should be few and far between) could then just go through the admins.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t really that revolutionary of an idea&hellip;most boards that do allow editing also put the time limit feature in.</p>

<p>i still don&rsquo;t see what the problem is with edits. it&rsquo;s a great feature to be able to rethink a bit, just like in real life !  typophile is great all around. if punchcut could just fix the edit feature to keep posts in their original place in the thread.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Good edit functions allow a few minutes' window to correct any mistakes, slightly alter tone, etc., but even as good as they are they most likely won&rsquo;t ever be the perfect solution for every user who uses the edit feature. People edit for different reasons. Because most edit to correct small mistakes, the system should accommodate this use adequately. Some do more; much more. But as has been discussed, it&rsquo;s not realistic to expect the forum to document every move you make. I don&rsquo;t want my discussion muddied up with frequent notes of changes in the text. If there are notes that contain potentially important information, (e.g. The comment originally read: &hellip;) they should exist hierarchically lower than the text. For most edits, the appropriate level for explanatory notation is none, invisible.</div>

<p>If this was in response to the scenario I suggested (which works at another forum I frequent), I might have made myself unclear. There is only ever one line of “Last edited by XXX at XX:XX PM” text, which contains a link that has to be actively clicked. This then brings up a pop-up window that contains previous versions of the post, in reverse chronological order.</p>
<p>This line of text including link is placed (at that forum) below the post, i.e., where the “Edit” and “Reply” links are as it is now under our own posts.</p>
