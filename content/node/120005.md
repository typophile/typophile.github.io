body: Futuristic (if you're living in 1984 and looking forward to the robotic revolution
  of the year 2000) heavy sans serif, which, unfortunately, I have been looking at
  for over four years on political signs all over Wisconsin. Notable is the uppercase
  lowercase e. The original signs read "I Stand With Scott Walker" and I made this
  mock-up from a low-res jpg...now I have requests to make a sticker and more and
  I would like to re-create using real vector-based typography. Thanks for your help.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/I-stand-with-walker-crop_5940.jpg]

    There are other versions of Handel Gothic by other foundries, but some use as
    standard some glyphs that are stylistic alternates in this version (such as the
    k)."
