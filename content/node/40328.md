  Arboghast was born in Melbourne, Australia, in 1963, and spent part of his childhood
  in England. He briefly attended the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology but
  found the academic focus too stifling even for pretend consideration.\r\n\r\nJames
  has worked as a photographer, art director, graphic designer, audio engineer, publicist
  and creative consultant. He is presently a freelance advertising creative specializing
  in copy writing and brand development. \"Combining a permanent interest in monumental
  sculpture with written forms and semantics, I'm a philosophical artist who finds
  typography an ideal medium for the expression of abstract ideas.\"\r\n\r\nSince
  2003 he has designed 11 retail typefaces and 4 proprietary typefaces, receiving
  commissions from major players in U.K. videogames industry and a specialty motion
  picture post-production house. Retailing under the &nbsp;s e n t i n e l&nbsp; t
  y p e&nbsp; brand, James' early type designs reflect a deeply-felt passion for blackletters,
  the gothic even-width principle, and fractured letterforms. Recent designs cover
  a wider range of styles. His original contributions to typeface design include the
  \"super-modular\" phonetic character shaping of Rhodaelian, and the variable structure
  and shape contrast of the unreleased Angel of the Odd.\r\n\r\n<strong>Retail fonts</strong>\r\nAmity\r\nDeLouisville\r\nEuphonia\r\nGanymede\r\nJellybrush\r\nMaus\r\nMidnight
