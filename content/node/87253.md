  months now, I've run into a situation numerous times where the beginning paragraph
  of a new chapter begins with a quotation mark. With a drop cap paragraph style assigned,
  the automatic styling is assigned to the quotation mark which, frankly, looks awful.\r\n\r\nOn
  to the question\u2026 Is there an accepted normal practice in this situation? I've
  been adding drop cap styling to the following character, so as the quotation mark
  and the first letter are \"the drop cap\". However, recently, I noticed that some
  books seem to remove the opening quote altogether, leaving just the first letter
  set as a drop cap.\r\n\r\nAny and all help is much appreciated."

    mark (so that the fist letter will vertically aligned regardless of the presenxe
    of quotations)."
