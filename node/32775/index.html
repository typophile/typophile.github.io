Does anyone here still use one?

Earlier this morning I was on another site identifying a typeface. I suggested a base font and implied that the designer may have used their <em>rapidograph</em> to achieve the handtailored "S."

I received a polite thank you - and something that stopped me dead in my tracks...
"Thanks Heron, out of curiosity, what’s a rapidograph?"

Just had to share.</div>

The one that used to be white plastic is from my set which is about 15-20 years old and the sleek black beauty comes from a set which is about 35-40 years old.

The ruling pen line is 10 time cleaner than any Rapidograph can do. It takes some time to get used to but it sure is easier to clean :-)

Tiff,
There was no such invention as a Ghetto Blaster when I was in design school. You had to plug in your old Victrolla and play 45s and 78s one song at a time. It sure was cool when Bill Haley's "Rock Around the Clock" came out!

For most Illustrators the combined costs of a cheap mac Mac, Wacom tablet, and Photoshop are less than what they would spend on markers, paper, and shipping costs in a year or two. And working digitally lets them accept a lot more commissions. 

Markers still seem to be huge in fashion design, tho. </div>

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">I worked for quite a few years making architectural drawings, so I have additional experience with technical pens beyond the uses we all remember in making mechanicals and such. As the resident pen-fetishist in every architectural office where I worked, I was often consulted about how to get this-or-that 00 or 000 pen working again, even when they were parked in the humidified carousels that Koh-i-Noor sold. Far more often, the draftspeople had left their pens out overnight or over the weekend and they'd seized up solid as a fossil. Pretty hard to get that tiny wire to move freely ever again once that has happened. 

Well folks, here's the answer and it is SO simple: at the end of the day -- <em>every single day without exception</em> -- just take the pens apart and dribble the ink back into the bottle from the reservoir. Do a quick but attentive rinse of the moving parts in the pen "nib," dab dry with a tissue, and put the pen back together. This way the pen gets stored dry and you never have to worry: next time you need to make some lines in a hurry, just gas it up and it'll behave like a brand-new pen. Not that important to do with anything fatter than a "0" (.35mm) but for the skinnier sizes you will always save time and aggravation by doing this.

Right here in the studio I still have (and occasionally use) sets of these from Koh-i-Noor Rapidograph, Rotring, and Staedtler, in addition to my Brause and H&B dip pens. I gave away my Graphos set to an enthusiastic student many years ago. 

I also have kept the Rotring compass and Ulano swivel knife setup that I used to cut all the original letters for a type that Michael Neugebauer designed for a local Salzburg architect back in 1977 (it later became Litera http://www.linotype.com/89893/litera-family.html)   but I have never used it since for making letters. As a few other old codgers will remember, it is a very tedious process to cut letters completely by hand on Rubylith! </div>

I never did get on with swivel knives, always developed a mind of their own when I used one (although the guy on the Ulano stand at trade shows who did Mickey Mouses [mice?] was very good).

My weapon of choice was a length of 3-4mm stainless steel rod, ground and sharpened. Held vertically and rotated in the fingers as required, you could get most of the way round a circle without changing grip or dislocating your elbow/wrist.

I still use a couple (not as sharp as they need to be for cutting) to weed plotter-cut self-adhesive vinyl and Ruby every day.</div>

I can remember trying to draw lines for a mechanical that had to be out the door - yesterday.... my pen was clogged and of course, I shook it up and hit it onto my right index finger -- but ooops, the cap wasn't on it, and to this day I have a little circular tattoo. I remembering going up to Ballantine Books right after and being told I had paid my dues :)

Meanwhile - mili, I was cleaning up my office last month (first time in 4 years...) and I came across a set of French Curves. Remember how we use to cherish them and not let anyone touch them for fear they didn't know how to use an exactoblade with them?

And I'm not familiar with Greenfilm, but I had my days with Rubylith -- all over negatives for draw downs (remember those) and of course, fixing typositor fonts when I couldn't find the proper marking pen for it and needed it NOW...</div>

She noticed the numerous bits of rubylith stuck about its edges and knew imediatly that it was my old light box from the mid-70s when we had worked together. I guess the mess I left that thing in was just as good as a DNA trail :-)

Unfortunately I didn't get to hand letter when I was working in comics. We were using Illustrator by then.

Nothing I hated more than some idiot using the drawing side of my ruler for cutting - and of course caught it a bit and so ended up ruining a perfectly smooth surface for good.

Oh, I don't have a Rapidograph tattoo, but the tip of my left index finger has slightly thinner skin on the thumb side thanks to a over enthusiastic use of a Stanley knife and a slipping metal ruler while cutting thick cardboard.</div>

One of my students, many years ago, managed to stab herself in the thigh while trying to cut matboard and smoke a cigarette at the same time. Only later did the Surgeon General determine that smoking was bad for your health! (He made no mention of Stanley knives though :-)

		<div class="commentbody">In art college (Limerick 1976–1981 the most wonderful place in the world) I was standing behind a door in the graphics department holding a scalpel when someone pushed open the door with venom causing me to stab myself in the thigh. But so sharp was the blade that it didn't even bleed.
As regards Rotrings I have old Rotring Variants and Micronorms which I love and use and a Rotring 600 fountain pen which is a thing of beauty. Certainly beats drawing in Adobe Illustrator with that dead computer line (although I use both)
