    Red Hat, which is metrically compatible with Helvetica.

  body: There's also URW's [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimbus_Sans#Nimbus_Sans_L|Nimbus
    Sans L]], which pretty much is Helvetica. A subset of it was released under a
    free licence to be included with Ghostscript. There are numerous (legal) derivatives
    floating around the web, e.g. [[http://www.gnu.org/software/freefont/|GNU FreeFont]].

    looking for. It is virtually impossible to tell FreeSans from Helvetica.\r\n\r\nThanx
    again"
