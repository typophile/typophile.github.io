  into my report for my final year \r\nat university, the topic I\u2019m most interested
  to write\r\nabout is word recognition & typography. I think \r\nthere could a really
  angle with the new turns in type\r\nwith alot more of the \"experimental\" typefaces
  \r\nbeing ultra-bold, nearly illegible & in alot of cases\r\nlacking a proper family
  with no lowercase also\r\ncompared to say Gill, Helvetica, Futura etc.\r\n\r\nIn
  my first year I read a interesting article\r\non \"The science of word recognition\"
  in Eye 52, I\u2019ve \r\ngone back to that article and found Kevin \r\nLarson's
  paper to be of real interest, the only thing\r\nI\u2019m struggling with now is
  finding the right \r\nliterature to reference from.\r\n\r\nAny help on this would
  be great, I\u2019m still on\r\nthe hunt now and not giving up.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nMat\r\n"

    thing to do is start with a good paper (like Larson's), go to the end of the document
    where the references section is, and find other articles that you think sound
    relevant. I'm sure your library will be able to help you conduct database searches.
    After a while, certain names start to become familiar and the process becomes
    significantly easier. This is a fun and rewarding process."

  body: "Hi, this is a reposting of an email that I wrote on the ATypI list:\r\nHere
    are 10 recent letter and word recognition projects that I find interesting:\r\n\r\nSheedy,
    J.E., Subbaram, M.V., Zimmerman, A.B., & Hayes, J.R. (2005). Text Legibility and
    the Letter Superiority Effect. Human Factors, 47(4), 797\u2013815.\r\n\tLetter
    superiority: It is easier to recognize letters in isolation than in the context;
    likely related to crowding. 6 fonts were tested with a threshold size methodology.
    Sheedy\u2019s lab has expanded this method to look at 12 legible text faces of
    different styles.\r\n\r\nChaparro, B.S., Shaikh, A.D., Chaparro, A. (2006). The
    Legibility of ClearType Fonts. Proceedings the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society,
    San Francisco. \r\nhttp://www.surl.org/usabilitynews/81/legibility.asp\r\nhttp://www.surl.org/usabilitynews/92/legibility.asp\r\n\tThe
    first paper linked to here uses a time threshold measure to find the most confusable
    glyphsin the ClearType fonts, Verdana, and TNR. They also developed a visualization
    called a sunflower plot. The full paper with more data is going to be published
    in the Information Design Journal in May of this year. The second linked paper
    expands that method to 20 legible text faces of different styles to understand
    the letter features that reduce confusions. A full paper on this topic is being
    written.\r\n\r\nSofie Beier (2009). Typeface Legibility: Towards defining familiarity.
    Ph.D. dissertation. The Royal College of Art.\r\n\tThe first half of this dissertation
    is concerned with testing the legibility of alternate letterforms in three newly
    created text typefaces. The first half of the dissertation has been turned into
    a journal paper and has been accepted by the Information Design Journal. It\u2019s
    expected to be published later this year. (It just came out) http://www.benjamins.com/cgi-bin/t_bookview.cgi?bookid=IDJ%2018%3A2\r\n\r\nPelli,

    the minimum threshold size to recognize lowercase text and minimum threshold size
    to recognize uppercase text (Arial). When read at twice the minimum threshold
    size, readers read the uppercase text faster than the lowercase text.\r\n\r\nChangizi,

    evolved not to match the performance of the hand, but to match what the eye was

    16 (8), 1022-1058.\r\n\tWe are faster at recognizing words if we know what font
    to expect than if we don\u2019t know what font to expect. This was first demonstrated
    in the 80s by Sanocki.\r\n\r\nATypI 2009 talk: \u201CDon\u2019t we have enough
    fonts\u201D\r\nhttp://www.chi2008.org/altchisystem/submissions/submission_hazlettr_0.pdf\r\n\tAt
    ATypI I talked about some data demonstrating that people are faster at recognizing
    words if the meaning of the word matched the personality of the font. Many people
    are familiar with the Stroop effect where incongruency between word and color
    makes it harder to name the word/color. The same seems to be true of other characteristics
    of the word. The above paper was submitted to a conference, but not accepted.
    We\u2019re doing more studies currently to get it ready for a future journal article.\r\n\r\nCheers,

    later on.\r\n\r\nThanks again for links to some of the papers, I have been looking
    for couple of the ones you have posted here, and really struggling!\r\n\r\nHi
    Nick, I do spend my time studying and practising design but also this is an area
    that interests me a lot, and we are required to submit a report on a subject within
    design of our choice. Having read an extract of\r\nKevin\u2019s paper in Eye It\u2019s
    always stuck in my head when looking at type, the shape that certain typefaces
    make, especially the contrast of some of the modern typefaces compared to some
    of the more accepted, legible faces.\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam, I have also looked into
    that thread, a great discussion going on there! It will be good for looking at
    some faces that exclusively contain uppercase in my report.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMat.\r\n\r\n"

    there are many factors to consider when designing something, and readability is
    just one of them. Otherwise we could just keep a few easy-to-read typefaces and
    throw the rest away.  :)\r\n"
