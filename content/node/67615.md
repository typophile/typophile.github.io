body: Any thoughts? I can identify a lot of close-but-no-cigar gothics. The K and
  almost-closed C are sticking points.

  body: "Pretty close to [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/franklin-gothic/|Franklin
    Gothic Condensed]], which would have been available for a long time -- even before
    digital fonts.\r\n\r\nMany foundries have had versions of it, with various weights
    and widths, so a little tweaking of one of those attributes would likely get a
    very close resemblance to your sample.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: It looks like it could be an old film font by Lettering Incorporated called
    American Gothic (not to be confused with another font called American Gothic,
    which was based on Copperplate, but with lowercase). Pretty sure there is no digital
    version of the LI font.
