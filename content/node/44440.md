  body: Stangehands, as Paul has mentioned this is not the place to be asking for
    free downloads of commercial fonts. If you absolutely need free fonts there are
    some legitimately free fonts available through the <a href="http://typophile.com/node/14652?">FAQ
    Free Fonts</a>.

  body: You know, maybe strangehands just doesn't know any better. I didn't understand
    font distribution as little as a couple of years ago, and I might have been stupid
    enough to ask that question here. Don't be so quick to condemn. Explain politely
    (as Miss Tiffany did), so that we don't lose another potential fontie to the club
    of exclusivity.

    sorry, also no-one said anything about my spelling of Typophile (it was a slip
    of the key)\r\n\r\nOk now can anyone tell me what Audi forum I can go to, I want
    to ask for a free Audi A3. I guess if you don't ask you don't get.\r\nps. full
    size, working, preferably brand new, not really into ex demos. In NZ so I will
    need right hand side driving configuration.\r\n\r\n@DrDoc: You didn't understand
    font distribution? Yeh I used to be a stocktaker, I used to take a lot of stock.
