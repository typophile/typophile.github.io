  this typeface :\r\n\r\nCheck the example below\r\n\r\n. . . . .\r\n\r\nI'm guessing
  it may be custom / But wanted to ask if anyone has seen a similar typeface to this
  /\r\nwith the odd serifs and interesting swash italic capitals . . . ? ? ? \r\n\r\nAny
  hints ?\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks All ."
