body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI have a question regarding the OpenType feature \"Contextual
  Alternates\". Is it correct that this is activated by default in programs such as
  Apple Pages '09, Apple Keynote '09, MS PowerPoint:mac 2008, etc. but in others such
  as MS Word:mac 2008 not?\r\n\r\nHow can I de-activate the behavior in some software
  as the above to avoid that the letters are displayed differently across different
  programs? I would like to de-activate Contextual Alternates to show the standard
  letters ...\r\n\r\nMany thanks for any support or ideas,\r\n\r\nPhilip"
