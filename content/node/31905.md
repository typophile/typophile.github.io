  beneath some scripted typography? Sorry for the poor explanation so I've added a
  (dodgy) sketch of the type of thing I mean \t<a href=\"http://typophile.com/files/example_4.jpg\">-example.</a>\r\n\r\nAlso,
  where are the best places for me to find these?\r\n\r\nI can't remember what they
  are or where I found them which is frustrating me!\r\n\r\nThanks"
