  body: No instant ID unfortunately. Reminds me of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/radiant/"
    target="_blank"> Radiant</a>  <BR>or <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/britannic/"
    target="_blank"> Britannic</a>, but wider, with more abrupt contrast and  <BR>different
    terminals.

  body: No not-so-instant ID either. It&#39;s not <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/ultramodern-classic-sg/">Ultramodern
    Classic</a>, but it has elements of it. It&#39;s kind of like a cross between
    Yves&#39; id and mine. Believe it or not, I looked at every damn font in MyFonts&#39;
    Decorative and Display category &#40;all 1792 fonts&#41; figuring it must be in
    there, just not keyworded very well. But it wasn&#39;t. Sorry!
