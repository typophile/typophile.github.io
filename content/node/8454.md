body: Hi,  <BR> <BR>This is a corporate logo design I am doing for the &#34;Progressive
  Dyers and Bleachers Association of West Bengal&#34;.The corporate group is an association
  of corporates from the hosiery industry involved in dying and bleaching of cotton
  cloth in the factories.  <BR> <BR>I took the shape of the initials and used the
  form of &#34;PDBA&#34; to form the shape on the left which is there to represent
  the rollers in the dying machines.  <BR> <BR>The problem is that, the client likes
  the logo but, he wants the letters to be readable in the same format. Also, I am
  not sure about horizontal lines at the bottom enclosing &#34;Of West Bengal&#34;.  <BR>
  <BR>I would appreciate any kind of help or feedback.  <BR> <BR>Thank you <BR> <BR><img

  body: 'Ritesh, I like the concept of the rollers. The way the letters work is too
    good to pass up. The execution does need refinement&#40;as you noted&#41;. <BR>
    <BR>First off, the overlapping forms should probably be more related to their
    forms, so: the ascender of the d should overlap the bowl of the p, which should
    overlap the bowl of the d. The ascender of the b should overlap the bowl of the
    d and the bowl of the a should overlap the line descending from the b. Some of
    this you&#39;ve done already, but the lines that define the letters should probably
    stay more intact. Have you tried to remove any line portion that is not part of
    a letter? It might help a bit. <BR> <BR>The rules enclosing &#34;of West Bengal&#34;
    don&#39;t do anything for me either. <BR> <BR>Does the client want to change the
    condensed letters to large, open ones like the &#34;pdba&#34;? If so, it could
    get very long/confusing to read.'

  body: Chris, thanks for the feedback. Here I made changes to the logo. Removed the
    horizontal rules&#40;i think it goes better now&#41;, made changes to the overlapping,
    and in the 2nd one, removed the extra lines just to show u how it looks &#40;I
    had tried that earlier but it doesn&#39;t really work because of the abrupt breaks&#41;.
    The client is quite happy with the letter forms because I had done another one
    with the similar font as the emblem but it was too stretched and also the thickness
    of the lines didn&#39;t match. <BR> <BR>I still don&#39;t think the letterforms
    in the emblem are readable. That is the only thing the client wants to be changed.
    <BR> <BR>Would appreciate any feedback. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/57145.jpg"

  body: Ritesh, it would be nice if the lower case a in association was the same as
    the roller. Like an Avant Guarde lowercase a. I don&#39;t know if that face has
    an alternate glyph

  body: Hi Ritesh  <BR> <BR>I think your concept is brilliant, but the result  <BR>is
    less strong than it could.  <BR> <BR>First of all i believe a logo should first
    be  <BR>explored in B/W. Of course this is a personal  <BR>view, but i think by
    this way you start solving  <BR>problems that will come up later. <BR>So, instead
    of overlapping the forms i would  <BR>trim them darely, but of course long before
    that  <BR>the letters become illegible. <BR> <BR>Also i don&#39;t agree &#40;both
    aestheticaly and &#34;technicaly&#34;&#41;  <BR>with such a tight composition.
    <BR> <BR>Aesthetically I think it gives a messy and &#34;unsafe&#34;  <BR>feeling
    which hides the beauty of your concept;  <BR>i would loosen up the composition
    by letting  <BR>space between the elements and instead  <BR>of aligning everything
    let the sign to stand out. <BR> <BR>&#34;Technicaly&#34; i believe it is hard
    to read  <BR>such a tight lettering...and about lettering,  <BR>why don&#39;t
    you use Avant Garde or something &#34;round&#34;  <BR>that would remind the letters
    that your sign  <BR>is supposed to be made of? <BR> <BR>Was i too naggy? Din&#39;t
    mean to be... <BR>so, this is my view and hope i was helpfull.  <BR> <BR>Have
    a nice and creative day, christos

  body: Ritesh, did you explore taking pdba in a horizontal format? It might read
    easier. Also look at staggering pdba baseline, like the p could be higher than
    the base line of the d etc. Just some playful ideas. I like the colors.

  body: The rollers and belts in the dying machines don&#39;t actually overlap, do
    they? I would think that they&#39;d butt up against each other, that is, if they
    even touch. If this is correct, then it might help to solve some of the legibility
    issues with the acronym. It might even allow you to explore doing a monochromatic
    acronym. For example, you could create the belts in a screened back version of
    whatever color you choose to work with, then have full opacity where the letterforms
    are. This would eliminate the abrupt breaks. <BR> <BR>The typeface doesn&#39;t
    seem appropriate. There is no relationship between it and the letterforms of the
    acronym. I&#39;m not suggesting that you jump to Avant Garde, but there should
    be something that ties them together and I&#39;m just not seeing it yet. <BR>
    <BR>As others have said, your concept is great. Looking further into this identity,
    some photographic imagery &#40;screened or not&#41; of a dying machine &#40;maybe
    focusing in on the rollers&#41; might be a nice supporting element. <BR> <BR>Aloha!

  body: Hey fellas, <BR>Thanks for the feedbak. I had a talk to the client and the
    client liked the concept and the logos and having given the below 2 choices he
    picked the 2nd one. <BR> <BR>Christos, I posted this logo after those initial
    developing stages of B/W. When the client approved the idea and the design, then
    he gave me the green light for putting in the colours. I have done a lot more
    work on it than you are seeing here and no Christos you were not being too naggy,
    in fact I appreciate your feedback. <BR> <BR>Daniel, I did explore the horizontal
    line up of the PDBA, trust me its harder than it seems. Thanks for your comments
    though. <BR> <BR>Scott, the idea was to take the basic structural shape of the
    rollers and use it in the emblem and not to mimic the exact form of the rollers.
    Also, I had to integrate the form of the letters &#34;pdba&#34; into the logo.
    At first the client was being fussy about legibility of the letters but now he
    seems to be alright with it.Thanks for the comments Scott.. appreciate it! <BR>
    <BR> <BR>Guys I still think that the logo here on the right side is giving away
    too much blank space in the last 2 lines of the title &#34;Of West Bengal&#34;,
    I tried fixing the kerning and all but some how I end up liking the way it is
    right now better than the other ones that i try out. Any ideas how to fix that
    part ? <BR> <BR>Thank u all <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/57171.jpg"

  body: I think a logo that echos toxic fumes would be more apporpriate. &#40;I kid!&#41;
    <BR> <BR>To be serious, the concept is nice. The excution, as other&#39;s have
    stated, seems to need some work. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d suggest pushing the stems of
    the letters to the outside edge of the &#39;rollers&#39; so they become more easily
    recognizable ad individual letter forms. <BR> <BR>As for the type...you need more
    white space. It&#39;s way too heavy at the moment, which, combined with the amount
    of text, make it rather laborious to read through at a glance. Perhaps use a smaller
    face &#40;smallcaps?&#41; with more leading between the lines and perhaps a bit
    of letterspacing.

  body: Hi Ritesh  <BR> <BR>I think the usage of caps or small caps  <BR>would solve
    two problems; first, you have no  <BR>descenders and ascenders to mess as you
    go  <BR>for tight lining, and second you can have  <BR>better legibility in smaller
    sizes. <BR> <BR>From your last two versions undoubtly  <BR>I prefer the right
    one. It looks much  <BR>better constructed with &#34;of west bengal&#34;  <BR>next
    to the sign. <BR> <BR>Have a good day, christos
