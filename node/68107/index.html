  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Well basically I am not referring to myself  but to my mom. I am not yet married and still single at this time but I am looking to have my own family in the future. My mom has no work and he's just an at home mom taking care of me and my father. But when my my father left us he is the only one now who's been taking care of me. I don't want my mom to work since he's age is not suitable anymore to work anyhow. I just want her to stay at home and enjoy even if she has no work.

Others may not be in favor of a stay at home mom but I don't care about them. I do care about my mom and I want her to enjoy life and I am the one who's been working for the both of us. He finance my education until I graduate my education Degree even if she's at home spending she's little pension to finance my school needs. And now that I already graduated,this is now the time that I'll take care of everything. i want to help her in anyways. She's been the only one who's been there for me all this time since I have no siblings. But even if I don't have I didn't feel empty of not having a siblings.

I'm very grateful that I have a loving,caring and generous mom like her.

I'm sure others also has a mom just like my mom. Just check out my site for further info.
