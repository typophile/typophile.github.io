  body: Although some of the repeating letters look close I think it is hand done
    - but skillfully.

  body: "As an experiment I rounded Meet Me in Brooklyn while trying to respect the
    general average of the outlines [img:sites/default/files/old-images/MeetMeInBrooklynRoundedInUse_4591.jpg]\r\nSome
    letters, like _O_ ended up being close to _AVOCADO ON_, while others while having
    a similar thick and thin character, were different in emphasis.\r\nIn my opinion
    _AVOCADO ON_ was hand lettered using a casual thick and thin technique and the
    similarities are due to convergent evolution on similar shapes that the lettering
    artist of this sign and the fontmaker of Meet Me in Brooklyn considered effective
    in catching a casual unstructured and spontaneous mood.\r\nA rounded version of
    Meet Me in Brooklyn would be very suitable as a source for making a full alphabet
    in the general style of _AVOCADO ON_. \r\nThis type of font works well when the
    letters are angled slightly. A good trick is to angle the letters one way for
    the upper case and in the opposite direction for the lower case. \r\nGenerate
    a couple of extra fonts with the letters at different sizes and a some variation
    in detail. For output, mix the fonts and cases, and you are about as close to
    informal lettering as you can get within the limits of digital font making.\r\nDon"
