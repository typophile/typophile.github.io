  body: The closest I can come up with in terms of character shape  for the top one
    is Letraset <a href="http://www.veer.com/results.asp?Image=LFT1054600">Fine Hand</a>,
    although the sample is bolder and more slanted. Adobe&#39;s <a href="http://www.veer.com/results.asp?Image=ADT0002937">Caflisch
    Script</a> has similar mannerisms too.

  body: This is the same question as <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/20471.html?1068835344"
    target="_blank">another thread</a>. I think the answer IS Fine Hand, as I answered
    there.

  body: Grant, Fine Hand is <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script08Pg2.html"
    target="_blank">here</a> in the Script Guide &#40;next to the bottom on the right&#41;.
    The shape of the letters is identical. Thickness and slope are mere touches of
    buttons in Illustrator, but the letterforms are what make the case to me.

  body: What I see is that your spacing/tracking is tighter and your letters have
    not been scanned and enlarged, from who knows what medium. Will you concede that
    the shapes and proportions of the letters are the same? Look at the counters in
    the a and e, and the angles of the connectors. Even the spur on the top of the
    a is the same. It almost looks to me like the sample was done on an inkjet and
    there was some spreading of the ink that blurred some of the edge details, like
    the top of the t&#39;s.

  body: 'Yes, I concede to your skilful observation. <BR> <BR>Although I think I beat
    you out on the ID, because my mention of Fine Hand is two minutes prior to your
    post. Not that it&#39;s a competition or anything...   <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>I still think the source image has been squooshed
    and skewed and had various characters scaled different amounts. That would explain
    why I saw a difference in the amount of slant in the characters, among other things.
    <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s Fine Hand overlaid on top of the sample, having various destructive

  body: If you just artificially bold &#40;yechh&#41; Fine Hand &#40;try it in <BR>a
    simple text editor&#41;, you get something quite like the <BR>sample image.

    a good word for it.
