  body: "Saying \"non-Latin\" is like saying \"I have a problem with a non-Adobe application\".
    Cyrillic, Greek, Hebrew, Arabic, Devanagari, Thai, Chinese etc. are all \"non-Latin\",
    but I somehow hardly believe that what you describe is happening for all those
    writing systems. \r\n\r\nPlease be more specific: what language/writing system,
    what operating system, what browser, what version of Illustrator. \r\n\r\nA.\r\n"

    all of those writing systems.  But at the moment our main concern is Hebrew, Arabic.
    \r\n\r\nThere's no problem to copy and paste into InDesign ME CS3, Mellel  (v.1.9),
    TextEdit.  \r\n\r\nIllustrator CS2; Safari, Mac 10.4\r\n\r\n"

    think that you'll be able to do Right-to-Left text in Illustrator unless you get
    into ME-ness. \r\n\r\nAside from Hebrew and Arabic, lots of non-latin writing
    systems will do just fine in Illustrator. At least the L to R ones. Not all of
    them, but a lot of them."

  body: "David, \r\n\r\nyou mean, it happens with Cyrillic? Show me. \r\n\r\nOf course,
    Arabic and Hebrew are both bidirectional scripts and Illustrator CS2 does not
    support bidirectional text, just left-to-right. As with InDesign, you need the
    Middle Eastern versions of Illustrator and Photoshop if you want this support.
    \r\n\r\nA."
