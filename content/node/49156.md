  would you suggest for an upscale women's lifestyle magazine in south florida, who's
  demographic is 45 to 73 years old?\r\n \r\nlooking for a few typefaces that would
  work well together for body copy, subheads, headline and captions.\r\n\r\nat the
  moment we are using didot and futura.\r\n\r\nlooking for something fresher.\r\n\r\ni
  would truly appreciate any suggestion\r\n\r\nanderson\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I'd suggest Thesis by lucasfonts. http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=thesis&x=22&y=12\r\n\r\nA
    beautiful mix of Sans, Serif and Slab Serif fonts. Very Modern and heavy. The
    majority of Florida's retired folks will enough the courtly thickness of these
    fonts, especially at a nice and large point size of 12pts or higher."

    a look to [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/type-together/bree|Bree]] from TypeTogether,
    and fonts of that sort, which can be found easily on fontshop.com.\r\n\r\ni stand
    with Asvetic, though, Thesis is a great font for that purpose."
