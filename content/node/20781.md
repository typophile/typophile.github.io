  body: The letters AARDA are from a 1970s font called Harry. There is at least one
    digital version with a different name, the the name escapes me.

    the logo?  I know it's small, I'm sure I can find something close but I need to
    use this logo on a lot of different materials so I'd like to get it right straight
    out of the gate.\r\n\r\nThank you very very much!"
