  mother-in-law was elected to the school board in 2002 and they used this logo for
  much of the campaign materials. \r\n\r\nNow it's time to get the re-election going,
  so I'd like to make an improved logo for the effort. Here's what I've done so far:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2006logo.gif]\r\n\r\nBlue
  and yellow are the preferred colors. I started with PTF's Costa, since I've already
  got it and it seems friendly and approachable. Clarendon's also been suggested,
  but I can't really tell which one is the best. Linotype's spacing looks more consistent,
  the EF version bothers me for some reason. \r\n\r\nYou've probably all seen the
  hideous local election signs around town, now's your chance to help make at least
  one of them in one little town a little better. Thanks for any advice you have to
  offer.\r\n"

    Make the slogan reflect that there has been positive change over her tenure.\r\n\r\nAs
    for the new look its nice but the letter spacing is loose, maybe you like it that
    way.\r\n"

  body: I would use the small caps instead of italic. I'd also tighten the spacing
    a bit overall. I might experiment with a different way to incorporate the yellow
    as well.

  body: "Thanks for the comments. We're working on the slogan, your suggestion about
    her positive contributions is well taken.\r\n\r\nI did tighten the spacing a little,
    especially the N-a, but I have to agree it's still pretty loose. After a little
    fiddling, I'm convinced a little tighter will be a big improvement. \r\n\r\nAny
    suggestions for a suitable small cap? All I have in SC is Latienne, and it doesn't
    really go very well. "

  body: "Costa's own small caps, possibly the regular weight, would be my suggestion.
    If you stick with the italic and present copy for the slogan you might make it
    a little larger, the f is slightly too far to the right to visually align with
    the T.\r\nTry the tiniest bit of kerning on the om of Thomas and similarly on
    the an of Nancy, just a gnat's. As for the colour, I don't know what standard
    the printing is like on this but you should consider that if the two colours crash
    you might get a green halo, I would look at a more intense colour in a thinner
    block and either align it on the right or extend it a bit further.\r\nTim"

  body: "Great call on the color crash, Tim. It was enough to convince a color change:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2006nancylogo_5603.gif]\r\n\r\nHowever,
    I think I over kerned. The \"ma\" in Thomas looks wide now since the \"cy\" in
    Nancy and the \"ho\" in Thomas are a bit too close. Also, the \"Re-elect\" is
    now a requirement, and I'm not sure I'm happy with the placement. \r\n\r\nThe
    small caps for the slogan have not been manually kerned. the \"ov\" in governing
    and the whole word \"our\" seem funky."

  body: "Kerning might be too much but the final size should be taken into account
    too, if this is for a large(ish) size (above 80mm, 2 1/2 inches or so wide) I
    would think that it will be fine, much smaller and the strap and Re-elect will
    be too small. I share your concern on the \"ho\" but the \"ma\" is, to my eyes,
    good although I might close \"as\" a touch. I'm not really familiar with this
    kind of work but shouldn't Re-elect be more prominent, the positioning is a problem
    though. In the strapline \"OV\", \"FO\" are a touch too tight and \"ER\", \"OU\"
    too loose and I would make the \"NIN\" evenly spaced between the verticals and
    ignore the spur on the righthand N (for the purpose of kerning).\r\nTim"

  body: "Coming along well Mica. \r\nThe spacing in the Th in Thomas needs to better
    match the rest of the name. There is a big hole under the T.  This may require
    a ligature or an adjustment of the crossbar length.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "I like where re-elect sits, its just that the spacing between the line and
    \"nancy\" should be the same as the one between \"re-elect\" and \"nancy\". You
    can make a cut-out in the line for the \"y\" and adjust the space for the slogan
    accordingly.\r\n\r\n"
