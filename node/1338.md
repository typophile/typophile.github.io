body: Special thanks to Mike Yanega, Bowfin Printworks for connecting me to this site
  and helping me identify one of my fonts. He didn&#39;t know what my son&#39;s hockey
  team logo font was and thought it might be a custom font, but I thought I&#39;d
  post it in hopes that someone might know what it is. It&#39;s from a semi-professional
  league that was active in the 80s and the original type information has been lost.
  They&#39;ve been hand pasting the logo from bits and pieces but now need to make
  some changes and would prefer to figure out how to do it digially. Thanks to anyone
  who can help. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/16497.jpg"
