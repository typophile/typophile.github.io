  in time to see Futura and News Gothic pulling their furious friend away. Avenir
  and Century Gothic were a few feet away helping their beaten friend to his feet.
  I think it started over the amorous intentions of a young designer. Another day
  and time the outcome may have been different because they are both stunningly strong
  fighters, but it was obvious that there was bad blood and that Trade Gothic had
  just kicked Gotham\u2019s ass. \r\n"
