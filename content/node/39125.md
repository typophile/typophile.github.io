  Sans]] however I would like to know exactly how editable the typeface is. More specifically,
  I require the ability to outline the type in order to send it to print. Is this
  an option when I purchase? (TrueType, OpenType etc.) Or is it up to the foundry
  to enable/disable this option. \r\n\r\nBasically I want to use this typeface at
  a number of printers, so I would like to use the outline method to embed it into
  the document, unless you guys know of a better way?\r\n\r\nHope you guys can fill
  me in...\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nBen"

    change the font and resave it or give the typeface away (to the printer). \r\nI
    think the way you work is legal.\r\n\r\nPieter"

    a font at all anymore and therefore not covered by the EULA. You are doing nothing
    that reverse-engineers or modifies the font software.\r\n\r\nBruno Maag\r\n"

  body: "This is an interesting question. It would seem to me that outlining the fonts
    would slow the file down. Why not just embed them?\r\n\r\nItem f in their EULA
    seems to allow for this. \r\n\r\n\"f. Licensee may embed the fonts in electronic
    documents provided to Licensee's authorized service bureaus or printers, provided
    that Licensee ensures that said service bureaus or printers agree to delete or
    return the electronic documents at the conclusion of rendering services to Licensee.\"\r\n\r\n[Removed
    this sentence because it was stupid.]"
