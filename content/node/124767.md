  already posted this image on a few different forums but I got no response, sadly.
  I really need it for a project I'm working on right now.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FD

    this is from a fire engine.\r\n\r\nThis derives from actual hand-painted signage.
    Even today, when the lettering is a decal (rather than hand-painted), most are
    derived from hand-painted alphabets/templates, and not all have equivalents in
    the digital type world.\r\n\r\nClosest typeface I could find is Flange:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/flange-bq/\r\n\r\nSimilar,
    though the legs of the |R|s are straight, not curved, and the serifs are more
    pronounced:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ortizlopez/ol-signpainter-titling/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/parkinson/modesto/"

    body: '@kthomps5 , This has been really helpful! Thank you. Modesto is kind of
      far from it. The two other fonts are close though. I''ve also had another suggestion
      from another forum. They said it could be <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/beaufort/">Beaufort</a>
      which is pretty close as well. I appreciate you guys''s help. Thank you!'
