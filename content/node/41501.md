  in the moive \"Into the wild\" - \r\n\"FAIRBANKS CITY TRANSIT SYSTEM\"\r\n\r\nI
  tried the usual websites (MyFonts, Identfont) - but I am not happy with the results:\r\n\r\nSolpera,
  Signature, LT Brewery - Details are wrong. (And it's hard to see.) I am very interested
  in your input. Thank you - sorry if this is a FAQ that didn't show up in my search.\r\n\r\nExample
  of the movie poster (found with google-image search):\r\n[[http://everettruess.files.wordpress.com/2007/10/into_the_wild_movie_poster.jpg]]\r\n"

  body: Would suppose that this was hand-lettered. Especially if it's authentic and
    not some stage dress.

  body: I read the book not too long ago... There is an authentic, abandoned old bus
    at the site of the actual events. If that's the real thing in the poster, I'm
    with Ken.

  body: "I started it, so here is the best match in my option, if somebody is looking
    for a start point:\r\n\r\nMixtra Sansserif (Semi Bold) with different C, S and
    T letters.\r\n\r\n(Mixtra is a family designed by Bo Berndal in 2006. The bus
    maybe is a streamliner from around 1940)\r\n\r\nThanks to Ken and Ricardo.\r\n\r\n"

    you with 100 percent certainty that the lettering is hand done. You can see the
    brush marks up close.\r\n\r\nI know this is a super old thread but I still felt
    I should throw my 2 cents in there."
