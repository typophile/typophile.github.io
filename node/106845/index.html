  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I&rsquo;m designing for a take out Soul Food place, but with a healthier twist. 
The restaurant will have  a graffiti wall, so there&rsquo;s an &lsquo;urban&rsquo; element to it (I hate that word!)</p>
<p>I could use some advice on:</p>
<ol>
<li>A font that could serve as a logo/wordmark</li>
<li>Some supporting faces for menus and such.</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to steer clear of anything too cliche (and offensive).</p>
<p>Any help is much appreciated.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>There are some contradictions here: comfort food vs healthful; traditional down-home southern vs urbanly hip. And of course, a takeout should be friendly and maybe a little loud, or at least noticeable. And maybe there should be a nod to the graffiti. But nothing that might be offensive or a cliché. That&rsquo;s a lot for a font.</p>
<p>If &ldquo;Soul Food&rdquo; is part of the name of the restaurant, then everyone probably understands the menu. How about Winco? It&rsquo;s solid and reliable (like soul food) and somewhat friendly (not corporate) and a little bit hip and has a clean (healthful) look?

<p>Or are you looking for something hipper?

<p>Or something bolder and neon-y for a takeout shop? Can you give a hint about what direction you are leaning?.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi, 
Thanks for this. So the physical location the client has in mind, is that this is going to be next to a basketball court, plus we&rsquo;ll have a wall of graffiti as mentioned before.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to try to outdo graffiti style stuff. We can&rsquo;t go too hip hop. I&rsquo;d like a nod to it, but w/o seeming like a poser (even though I used to write graffiti in the 80&rsquo;s!).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Soul Food, so the menu will be familiar, but with some slight variations.</p>
<p>I do like winco, and it might find it&rsquo;s way as a supportive typeface if not a primary. Perhaps with a treatment behind it, or an outline, it might get loud in the right way.</p>
<p>The place will be called &lsquo;soul sammich&rsquo; so I&rsquo;m going to try mixing a bold &lsquo;soul&rsquo; face, perhaps with a script. Maybe because the word &lsquo;sammich&rsquo; is non standard, a script could be used for &lsquo;soul&rsquo; perhaps like a graffiti style script w/o overreaching.</p>
<p>Does that paint a clearer pic of the place? Any feedback helps, so thanks&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Soul Sammich. I like it.</p>
<p>Want to see some good examples? Come to Memphis and I&rsquo;ll drive you around. No offense intended to the other posters, but Hipster-script, hipster anything it is not. There&rsquo;s an inherent lack of stylish pretension in soul food. For the most part the hipness of all good soul food graphics is going to be hand-lettering and not typography. There&rsquo;s more soul in works by hand. When typography is used at soul food places, at least around the South, it&rsquo;s usually bad vernacular sign shop slop, which sometimes actually has it&rsquo;s own quirky charm, but most often is just plain lame and ugly. The best menus that set the mood are also done by hand.</p>
<p>We had a great soul sammich here called the Soul Burger, served at an ancient South Memphis whorehouse, now just a funky bar, called Ernestine &amp; Hazel&rsquo;s. Unfortunately the owner killed himself a few weeks ago in the upstairs bar, which is allegedly  haunted. The new management says they&rsquo;ll continue unchanged, but we&rsquo;ll have to wait and see.</p>
<p>I think you should maybe look for a few fonts for inspiration, but mainly stick with putting some funk in your pens and laying some ink on paper. (And stay away from haunted whorehouses.)</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a fun project, enjoy it.
