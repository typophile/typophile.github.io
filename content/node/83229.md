body: "Alcal\xE1 is based on the document \u201CBiblia poliglota complutense\u201D,
  aka Bible polyglotte d'Alcal\xE1.\r\nIt was the first edition of a complete polyglot
  Bible, as well as the first printed version of New Testament in Greek, the Seventy
  and Targoum Onkelos. Conceived between 1502 and 1517, it was thought, financed and
  largely by cardinal Francisco Gimenez de Cisneros.\r\nThe first drawings go back
  to 1995. A second version was started in 2011 in order to answer the ordering of
  a publisher to compose a Bible based on the translation revised of J. N. Darby in
  French and Madagascan. Drawings are optimized for uses in small sizes.\r\nAlcal\xE1
  is developped in three cuts: roman, italic and bold. With Titling capitals and figures
  (roman), Small capitals (roman and bold), lining figures, old style figures, superior
  figures (roman, italic and bold), specific ligatures (italic), superior letters
  (roman, italic and bold).\r\nhttp://www.editions205.fr[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Alcala-205_Typophile_5970.jpg]"
