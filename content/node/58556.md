body: I was down memory lane earlier looking at those old Letraset catalogues that
  showcased that company's transfer lettering. What font were they using for their
  own logo? I suspect it's maybe just a slightly customized Helvetica but would like
  to know for sure.

    Bold. I admit others eyes are sharper for fine details, but I couldn't tell the
    difference between their logo lettering and that typeface.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "On a letter 'e' in Helvetica the terminals are flat, on the Letraset 'e'
    they're at a slight angle, the same with the terminala on the letter 'a' and 's'.
    \r\n\r\nIt's the same kind of small difference you see between some letters in
    Arial v Helvetica, but the logo isn't Arial (that has a far different letter 't')"

  body: "This is the old display version of Helvetica, derived from the larger sizes
    of the original metal foundry type. Most digital Helveticas are descended from
    Linotype's version, which was designed for 18-point and smaller (machine setting).
    URW's Nimbus Sans Bold D (D=display) is about as close as you can get in a digital
    font.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.urw.de/cgi-bin1/dalcgi/source/schnellsuche.htd?searchchar=nimbus+sans"

  body: Mark, I had a good look at Nimbus and can't see a case where the terminals
    of the 's', 'a' and 'e' match the Letraset logo. Earlier I asked over at WTF and
    was referred back to your answer. What I don't want to do is make a big deal of
    this, because it isn't. I just want to sate my curiosity

  body: I did say, "close as you can get in a digital font". It's quite possible that
    Letraset altered it somewhat when they did their "cut" of Helvetica for transfer
    lettering. However, they credit the source as Haas. Looking at an old Letraset
    catalog, the "e" in their Helvetica does have that slight tilt, whereas the "e"
    in the Helvetica shown in a metal foundry type catalog has it perfectly horizontal,
    or nearly so. While Nimbus Sans Bold D is an accurate digital version of the original
    Haas foundry cut, it looks like the Letraset "cut" of Helvetica may be a lost
    typeface.
