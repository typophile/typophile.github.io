    post updated for 'ARROGANT', still searching for 'BUTCHER' but I guess with a

    Antiqua]] Wide/Extra Wide Bold/Extra Bold but it'd need a bit of customization.

    pointing directly to the complete glyph set of Diamond and you'd see the /R they
    used specifically for this identity. 'Regular' /R is 2nd line 6th position (blue
    circle), the used one is the one after, 2nd line 7th position (red circle) and
    should be available as stylistic alternate through OpenType features.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/02_4656.png]"
