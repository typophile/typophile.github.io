  body: "To Frutiger: \r\n\r\n1. How is your approach to a sans different from to
    a serif? Do different standards apply? You said you are a 'sans mensch', in contrast
    to Hermann Zapf. What does a 'sans mensch' have to particularly sensitive to?\r\n\r\n2.
    In your interview posted on the Linotype site, you gave standards for ideal weight
    of strokes for a text face, and ideal letter spacing. Do you have any second thoughts
    about these? Have your views on these changed over time? Generally, what have
    you changed your mind about as regards letter design during your career?\r\n\r\n3.
    You said that \"activating the whites\" is important in your approach to design.
    Could you explain what you are looking for when you look at the whites, and how
    this makes a difference to a design? Could you give some examples of glyph or
    designs that you think are hurt by lack of attention to whites? Ones that are
    particularly good?\r\n\r\n4. Finally what is your view of the many designs that
    have been influenced by Frutiger, the typeface? "

    If it was never finished, nor digitized - how did it reached India? Please tell
