  its name?\r\n\r\nHave a look at the lower case \"L\" and the lower case \"A\". Does
  that ring a bell?\r\n\r\nThe (poor) scan is from a Phaidon Press book. Published
  in 1998, the book design was done by Stephen Wolstenholme.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font_1b_6247.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for giving me information on the font!"
