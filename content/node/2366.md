body: Hello. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m creating a Estonian avation information webpage called
  &#39;Tallie&#39; &#40;the title might change&#41;, which offers information about
  international civilian and mil aircraft, texts about history, info about local companies
  and so on. <BR> <BR>Anyway, at first I was thinking about a logotype with similar
  motive to Boeing&#39;s logotype, but when developing one I got another idea- a logotype
  that symbolises the middle window of a commercial aircraft, which has a view to
  the wing. Here is the first version of it. <BR> <BR>Feedback about comosition, typography
  and logotype is welcome. <BR>I will probably post the more Boeing-like motive later.

    belongs to the typo, which makes me read Atallie or Ntallie.  <BR> <BR>Other than
    that, perhaps a less overused typeface would be nice, just for fun&#39;s sake.
    Apart from that, the letters could do with a bit of manual kerning, especially

  body: Thanks for the nice feedback. <BR> <BR>Actually I&#39;m having double thoughts
    about this symbol, because it relates more to the commercial aircrafts than military
    ones, and that is not right because of the information database&#39;s content.
    Since I didn&#39;t make the &#34;wing&#34; that recognisable, it also works as
    a silhouette of rear wing. I don&#39;t know if this double meaning is good or
    not. Well, triple meaning, since it really works as runaway too! <BR> <BR>Concept
    definitely needs more work and luckily I have you guys <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    the window in amazement that we are actually flying. But I love to travel.  <BR>
    <BR>I would say if your rounded the ends of the wing a bit, it might be a little
    more &#34;wing-like&#34;. Also, the type seems too big for this size of a mark.
    It might also be too bold.

  body: The type is still visually too bit. I think the reason is &#40;1&#41; the
    type is darker than the mark, &#40;2&#41; the thinnest space in mark is thinner
    than the type. Yes, that is a matter of opinion, but I think you will find that
    going one weight down will help. I might also consider aligment. Should it be
    a the &#34;visual&#34; bottom of the mark? Or, should it line up with the &#34;actual&#34;
    bottom of the mark?

  body: Going one weight down is difficult because I think there is no medium extended
    version of Swiss 721. But I will try out the regular extended version or make
    the text even smaller. Text&#39;s Blue will be lighter next time too. <BR> <BR>I
    like the horis. alignment because it makes it more easy to use the logo tight
    spaces &#40;web banners for instance&#41;, although I need to bring the mark down
    a bit anyhow &#40;I didn&#39;t notice the mark&#39;s hovering effect before&#41;.
    But am-s suggestion is also nice, I will try out that too.

  body: the first one is too tricky, and there isnt&#39; enoug deliniation between
    mark and type. The second one is nice because now you have created a sort of automatic
    hierarchy. The thrid one the type, and I&#39;ll admit it might be me, is still
    too big for that placement.

  body: 5{t a great name...&#34;Magnus&#34;, that is. I just got an identity job for
    a company using that title. <BR> <BR>The first design reads as a runway because
    the &#34;t&#34; looks like it is traveling on it...that&#39;s just the way the
    positioning of the &#34;t&#34; in relation to the runway, I mean wing, I mean
    rear wing...I give up. <BR> <BR>I really like the concept of the window view of
    the wing, but I don&#39;t know that I would&#39;ve seen it had you not included
    the description. Have you thought of any ways to make it more obvious? The most
    apparent visual seems to be the rear wing. At least that&#39;s what I&#39;m seeing.
    <BR> <BR>I agree with Tiffany 100%. The type is relatively heavy. Find some method
    to balance the type and mark &#40;color, mass, positioning, or some combination,
    or whatever&#41;. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott

    POV in the logo, this can&#39;t be the seat of the pilot. But that doesn&#39;t
    fit the meaning of the information centre very well. <BR> <BR>What shall I do,

    and make it less obviously any of the above. Make a mark that resembles all of
    the above, but isn&#39;t necessarily any of them. <BR> <BR>...and no, this isn&#39;t
    to taunt you.

    see the mark as a tail fin or runway and a passanger might recognise the view
