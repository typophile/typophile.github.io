  I find it difficult to make sure that the correct fonts are activated, especially
  since I have multiple versions of various fonts. I'm wondering if FontAgent Pro
  or Font XPlorer are better? What do you all prefer and recommend?\r\n\r\nI'm running
  Snow Leopard. Thanks!"

  body: I don't like any of them. I am a type designer who is constantly dumping old
    versions and testing new ones so I have to stay barebones and just use Font Book.
    If you are a graphic designer, you will have different issues.

  body: "Thanks for your replies. \r\n\r\nTo be more specific, I am a graphic designer
    and my main concern is keeping client's fonts organized in order to be certain
    that I am using the correct font for the project (since I have multiple versions
    of fonts with the same name). I also want to be able to meticulously classify
    and categorize my fonts. I've downloaded FontAgent and am playing around with
    it, but I'd be curious to hear what works for others. "

  body: "I'm pretty happy with X-Fonter from Black Sun. I think it's $35.\r\n\r\nI
    have too many fonts to install, so I keep them in a folder in my documents, divided
    into many sub-folders. The X-fonter reads, previews, compares, installs and uninstalls
    quickly. It also displays special effects, but I have not much need for that.\r\n\r\nAwhile
    back The Font Thing was my favorite and had superior comparison abilities. But
    it can't read Open Type and I don't think it was ever updated to do so.  "
