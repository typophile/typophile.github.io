    Garamond, have you considered a different cut of Garamond? Here is an abbreviated
    list I found: http://paulstonier.wordpress.com/2008/02/04/the-many-cuts-of-garamond/'

  body: "Well, thanks for the link to blog and I'd add that Garamond Premier Pro,
    the opentype family released in 2006, is amazing.Adobe Garamond and Stempel Garamond
    are quite nice as well as you can see in that article.\r\n\r\nBut, I think to
    answer you question in a way that you were intending. I'd suggest Adobe Caslon
    or Jenson, Caslon has better readability. Jenson has some beautiful lines. However,
    I always get drawn back to Garamond. It just has so much character (no pun intended\u2026
    well ok, maybe a little bit)."
