    than a Victorian display face.

  body: "At least he isn't looking for [[http://new.myfonts.com/search/Papyrus/fonts/|Papyrus]].\r\n\r\nI've
    seen [[http://new.myfonts.com/search/Davida/fonts/|Davida]], which appears to
    be available from a number of foundries, used before where a Mexican-American
    atmosphere is being suggested.\r\n\r\nSomething between Blackletter and Davida
    is a tall order, but perhaps, ironically enough, the face from Letraset called
    [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/victorian/|Victorian]] might fill the
    bill.\r\n\r\nThe querent is searching for information, not aesthetic judgment.\r\n\r\nOf
    course, there's also [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/dtptypes/pretorian-dt/|Pretorian]]
    and even [[http://new.myfonts.com/search/Hobo/fonts/|Hobo]] ([[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/profonts/roberta/|Roberta]],
    which also appears on that results page, might be of interest) that he might consider.\r\n\r\nBesides
    Roberta, for something new, that isn't overused, there's [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/durham-abbey-nf/|Durham
    Abbey]]; while that is pretty clearly Victorian, given the right context it could
    still work for the querent's purpose.\r\n\r\nOf course, authenticity isn't a bad
    thing, either. I'm not sure how much authenticity there is in these suggestions
    from MyFonts:\r\n\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/scriptorium/quetzal/|Quetzal]],\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/jonahfonts/yacqui/|Yacqui]],
    or\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/larabie/xolto/|Xolto]]...\r\n\r\nHere are
    a few more ideas:\r\n\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/dime-box-wbw/|Dime
    Box NF]],\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/larabie/kirsty/|Kirsty]], or...\r\n\r\nNo,
    neither [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/supper-club/|Supper Club JNL]]
    nor [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/unovis/|Unovis]] is what I'm thinking
    of, but there might be something similar but less extreme that would do.\r\n\r\nAh,
    it took a while to find an example; [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/iron-type-sg/|Iron
    Type SG]] was what I was thinking of. There was also [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/northernblock/mekon/|Mekon]],
    but while it had the right weight, it didn't seem to have the right spirit.\r\n\r\nAh,
    I finally persuaded MyFonts to show me what I was looking for: [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/eagle/|Eagle]].\r\n\r\nMaybe
    [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/outras/alegria/|Alegria]]?\r\n\r\nAlso, [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/bremen/|Bremen]]
    might do in a pinch."

    was merely pointing out that Davida is not an indigenously-informed design.\r\nWhat
    is a 1960s neo-Victorian type -- Brit pop art?\r\nI believe it connects with the
    foppish Carnaby St fashions, eg the Beatles with a kind of garish 19th century
    style military/band uniform and strange facial hair, Sgt Pepper. I had one of
    those jackets with the high collar, 4 or five buttons at the front, and double-vented
    at the back. The Kinks had that look in 65.\r\n"

  body: "Well, [[http://www.317x.com/albums/b/bajamarimbaband/card.html|Victorian]]
    (here stretched vertically on this album cover) is not authentic either, and yet
    a major record label found it suitable to convey the appropriate mood for an LP
    of music in a Mexican style.\r\n\r\nIt may be I was too harsh, but as Papyrus
    demonstrates, a face can be used to fit the intended mood of something even when
    not obviously authentic. Apparently the original poster is looking for something
    that can be related to Mexico's indigenous or part-indigenous peoples."
