  be the hardest thing for everyone, and I'm really feeling that. I've attached two
  file with a few variations I've done. I wanted to keep things simple, hence them
  all being text only, but if anyone has a striking idea I'd love to hear it. I'm
  kind of stumped. My initials aren't the easiest letterforms to combine.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any input!\r\n\r\nOh, and the Feel Script one was just for fun, but I thought
  I would include it anyway."

  body: "The script version is the nicest of all of them. \r\n\r\nSome suggestions:\r\n\u2022
    Try redrawing the flourishes to they balance out better (maybe even are the same
    on both sides)\r\n\u2022 The starting point of the 'f' should begin within the
    vertical (i.e. the little hairline on the left could be eliminated)\r\n\u2022
    There's some unresolved space where the two letters join\r\n\r\nWhy was it \"just
    for fun\"?  Does it not really reflect you?  If it doesn't, then kill it.  If
    you're into doing a monogram, then it should generally reflect the style of your
    work. Can you give us any more direction on why you tried these things?"

  body: "Thanks for all the input jonsel!\r\n\r\nThe Feel Script was for fun mostly
    because I hadn't even considered using something like that, though I do agree
    that the result is nicer than I achieved with any other so far. It does reflect
    me in some way (though not entirely), but I don't know if I'll ever feel completely
    at one with what I come up with because I am all over the place with what I do.\r\n\r\nGenerally
    I decided that I'd like to keep the monogram lowercase and keep it simple. As
    for the font choice, I really just went through my installed fonts looking for
    letterforms that I saw could combine nicely with a little bit of work. I spent
    a long time redrawing a Bodoni lowercase a and f together thinking it would look
    great, but in the end it just didn't look balanced or make much sense."

    to work, but this link should get you right to the image.
