    persecution in a desparately poor country to start with was pitiable. There was
    a long debate over whether Israel should accept them as Jews, as they claimed
    to be, and give them the right of return. In a humanitarian decision, Israel finally
    decided to accept them. The right thing. That&#39;s the reason.  <BR> <BR> <BR>  <BR>

    The Israeli &#34;right of return&#34; is not racist at all, quite the contrary:
    it will use people of any color as cannon fodder in this war. In the same way
    that racism is on the decline in the US... because it&#39;s bad for business.

    </i> <BR> <BR>Er, no, it shows that they&#39;re really spooked about the Fence,
    and with good reason. Attacks within Israel have been Arafat&#39;s biggest bargaining
    chip: they brought the weary Israelis to the negotiating table at Oslo to offer
    land in return for peace. Arafat promised peace, but never delivered, and the
    Israelis didn&#39;t deliver the land -- because neither side trusts the other
    --, so there has been a violent stalemate for the past two years. The Fence changes
    the whole equation, because if Palestinian militants can&#39;t launch attacks
    within Israel anymore, then Arafat has nothing left to negotiate with. The Palestinian
    Authority is justifiably worried, and the idea of &#39;pushing for a one-state
    solution&#39; just shows how desperate they are. On what basis are they going
    to push? Blowing up civilians in Israel is the only card in their hand, the offer
    of peace their only negotiating tool. If Israel makes it impossible for Palestinian
    militants to operate within Israel, Arafat will be left sitting outside the fence
    with a lot of angry Hamas members on his hands, probably wishing that he&#39;d
    cracked down on them like he promised to do at the Oslo peace talks. <BR> <BR>And
    I write this in full sympathy for the ordinary Palestinian people who, once again,
    will be the victims of both Israeli policy <i>and their own corrupt and strategically-blind
    leadership.</i>'

    <BR> <BR>What do you make of this? <BR> <BR>Firstly William says that Israel is
    not a racist state. Then I make clear point. Cornered, William abandons previous
    position. Catching breath he gears his loyalties to soft and heavenly explanation
    spewing guilt upon all others as to why the Jewish peoples have come by  <i>ethnoism</i>
    and <i>religious discrimination</i> honestly. Here William quotes and writes <BR>
    <BR><i>&#39;Kol Yisrael arevim zeh le zeh&#39; &#39;All Israel are responsible

    <i>Ethnoism</i> and <i>Religious Discrimination</i> of the Jewish peoples, but
    I hope not. In otherwords it may harder to be sympathetic as William has suggested.
    In fact if there is truth to this I am very offended. I think lots of us will
    be very offended.  <BR> <BR>Excerpt from  the ultra-orthodox newspaper Hamodia
    <i>The sacred book Zohar has taught us that Israel is linked to rationalism.&#42;
    Thus, the great distance between the Jew and the Gentile is such that it can only
    be compared to the distance between animals and humans. Rabbi Loew Yehuda of Prague
    has spoken at length of this fundamental difference in his Lord of Israel, in
    Chapter 14, where he indicates that the great difference between the Jew and the
    Gentile is such that it can only be compared to the distance between animals and
    humans. Our rabbis have also said, You are humans; Gentiles are not humans.</i>
    <BR> <BR>Hamodia Newspaper, are they anti-semitic, or are they very evil racist?

    ignoring the true function of The Fence - its protective role is secondary - its
    true role is to draw borders and make it much harder to dismantle the illegal
    settlements in the future. The UN cartographers have seen what&#39;s really going
    on, and once Israel is judged to be an apartheid state by the international court,
    hopefully some international sanctions will kick in. The sanctions won&#39;t be

    enough to finally cause the Israeli populace to cross over to the light. <BR>

    Fence: I was looking at the Fence in terms of its impact on the strategy of the
    Palestinian Authority. <BR> <BR> <BR>Gerald, Arafat&#39;s authority is widely
    recognised as corrupt by Palestinian political commentators. New political organisations
    have formed specifically to challenge Arafat and his cronies on anti-corruption
    platforms. As for the Nobel Peace prize, Arafat was given the peace prize for
    saying that he would put an end to terrorist attacks and commit to a peaceful
    solution: but he has not actually done these things. <BR> <BR>I have nothing to
    say about Hamodia. As noted earlier in this discussion, there are fanatical extremists
    on both sides. What you quote from Hamodia to back up your comments about &#39;the
    profound Ethnoism and Religious Discrimination of the Jewish peoples&#39; are
    not opinions held by any Jews who I know. <BR> <BR>The Jews are peoples &#40;several
    ethnicities, multiple cultures, numerous languages&#41; with a religion, and they
    look after each other because they&#39;ve noted, over the centuries, that very
    few other people want to look after them. And now they have a country to which
    any Jew can go and be free from persecution by non-Jews. That was the whole idea
    behind the UN creation of Israel back in 1948, remember? And if the Arabs had
    accepted the UN partition then, the Palestinians would have had their own state
    for the past 55 years -- one very much larger than anything they can seriously
    hope to gain now --, and Jews and Arabs could have spent half a century building
    mutual prosperity instead of killing each other. Instead, we have Hamas militants
    dedicated to turning all of Israel into an Islamist theocracy, a corrupt secular
    Palestinian Authority that is either unwilling or incapable of implementing what
    it promises at the negotiating table, a self-professed war criminal running Israel,
    Arab states that maintain their Palestinian brothers and sisters in misery to
    keep them as a thorn in Israel&#39;s side, and people spouting antisemitic hatred
    on the Internet to question the very basis for the existence of Israel. In all
    of this, only one thing is perfectly clear to me: the reasons for the existence
    of Israel are as valid today as they were when the concentration camps were liberated.'

    I did no such thing. Judaism is not a race.  <BR> <BR>This is not to say that
    there are not bigots and idiots who are Jews, both in the past and in the present.
    The ultra-orthodox are a very small minority, regarded by Israelis generally as

    Klan or Louis Farakan and saying that represents the opinion of Americans as a
    whole. <BR> <BR>Gerald, are you so blinded by bigotry you can&#39;t understand
    the simplist point? The point of Jews being responsible for one another is not
    that they shouldn&#39;t care for anyone else. On the contrary the most often repeated
    commandment in the Torah is to love the stranger - &#39;ger&#39;, the resident
    foreigner - for we were strangers in the land of Egypt.   <BR> <BR>The point is
    that that your first responsibility is to those near to you before those far away.
    Hence the special responsibility to help the Ethiopian Falasha Mura. Jews are
    in fact some of the biggest supporters of non-Jewish charities in America, which
    is indicative of the Jewish committment to bettering the world. <BR> <BR>Now you
    add to your numerous anti-semitic links a link to some sentimental art picturing

    I believe many Jews would question the application of the adjective &#39;sacred&#39;
    to the Zohar, except insofar as it is a book that concerns itself with sacred
    things. The Zohar is certainly not scriptural: it is a Kabbalistic text, and Kabbalism
    is a post-diaspora adjunct to Judaism, culturally and intellectually important
    but not central or even necessary to the Jewish religion. And of course, you shouldn&#39;t
    assume that Hamodia&#39;s interpretation of the Zohar in any way reflects mainstream
    Jewish thought. <BR> <BR>By the way, Gerald, where did you find that quote? Perhaps

    of the occupation of Gaza and the West Bank gave Palestinians the &#39;duty&#39;
    &#40;your word&#41; to kill Israeli Jews. Don&#39;t you remember that? That&#39;s
    not my idea of peace. As for antisemitism, I call it as I see it. If you don&#39;t
    want people to think you are an antisemite, be more careful how you express yourself.
    As I said at the beginning of this discussion, there is an established and insidious
    discourse of antisemitism that is easily evoked even when one doesn&#39;t intend
    to. Since antisemtitism is a contributing factor to war in the Middle East, it
    seems to me that anyone who is genuinely interested in peace should be careful
    in what he says. <BR> <BR>Have I, at any point in this discussion, expressed anything
    other than a wish for peace in the Middle East? Have I expressed anything other
    than sympathy for the plight of the Palestinian people? -- victims of the Israeli
    military, victims of fanatical hate-mongering settlers, victims of their own corrupt
    leadership, victims of fanatical hate-mongering Hamas militants, victims of the
    self-serving governments of their Arab &#39;brothers&#39;.

    was expressing UN documented and published views on such matters. Legal opinions.
    You knew that I audited law at several universities but I am not on the UN payroll.
    The UN site will illuminate the problems dealing with the state of Israel especially
    concerning Human Rights issues. Common law makes the inhabitants of an occupied
    nation incapable of terrorism. Such common law predates by centuries the formation
    of the UN itself. They have duty to defend themselves with whatever is available
    to them. You should appreciate, that for the most part, Palestinians deadly soldiers
    are merely young children throwing stones. Families holding up cardboard signs
    in peaceful protest. So much for Jewish bravery. <BR> <BR>Exceptions are no excuse.
    It is the occupiers duty to respect the civilians as clearly stated by UN precedence.
    To avoid with extreme caution endangerment of the civilian population. After  all
    the occupiers chose to occupy. Dangers come with that package. As you have noticed
    in Iraq. <BR> <BR><i>Have I, at any point in this discussion, expressed anything

    yes, you have mention the plight of the Palestinians. I  admit that, also that
    you consider Sharon to be a  Terrorist and a War Criminal. Usually however in

  body: Gerald, the UN says that the inhabitants of illegally occupied territories
    have a right to defend themselves and to resist occupation. I don&#39;t have a
    problem with that. I do not think, however, that blowing up busloads of children,
    or civilians standing in line at nightclubs, going to the market or in eating
    restaurants constitutes either defence or legitimate resistance. These are acts
    of aggression, and we should also pay attention to the stated aims of the people
    carrying out these attacks. Hamas, for instance, is dedicated to the destruction
    of Israel, not to an independent, parallel Palestinian state or to resistance
    in the occupied territories. When Palestinian militants shoot at IDF troops in
    Nablus, Jenin, etc., that too is tragic -- not least for the Palestinian civilians
    in the middle --, but it may be legitimately described as resisting the occupation.
    Going into Israeli cities and murdering civilians is something else. This is a
    classic case of two wrongs not even remotely making a right. <BR> <BR>Your mention
    of Gandhi has me thinking... Gandhi and his followers ended 200 years of British
    rule in India with <i>non-violent</i> resistance.&#42; After 55 years of alternating
    open warfare, guerilla warfare and terrorism, the Palestinians are in a worse
    situation than when they started. Maybe they should try non-violence for a change?
    <BR> <BR> <BR>&#42; Of course, Gandhi&#39;s campaign didn&#39;t result in <i>peace.</i>
    It resulted in partition, massive sectarian violence, the murder of hundreds of
    thousands of people on a scale that makes the West Bank and Gaza look pacific,
    the massacre of thousands in the Indian annexation of Hyderabad, half a century
    of intermittent wars between India and Pakistan, etc. But I suppose we can agree
    that his heart was in the right place.

    as saying that individual Jews are &#34;bad people&#34;&#41; is not racism at
    all - it&#39;s just a personal critical judgment borne of observation and a desire

    The sin of many members of the Israeli government is that they do not care about
    the Palestinians: they do not care whether they live or die and so hold their
    lives cheaply. This is a very bad thing. But genocide requires this &#39;intent

    policy, was not sanctioned by the Israeli state, is not permitted by Israeli law,

  body: '<i>But are you saying this was an accident? </i> <BR> <BR>No, I&#39;m saying
    that it was a war crime, perpetrated by the Phalangist militia, which Ariel Sharon,
    as Israeli Defence Minister in command of IDF forces controlling West Beirut,
    had a duty to prevent. If you read the report of the <a href="http://www.us-israel.org/jsource/History/kahan.html">Kahan
    Commission</a> on the massacres at Sabra and Shatila, I think you will get a good
    impression of that lack of care to which I referred above. Sharon allowed the
    massacres to happen because he did not care enough about the Palestinians in the
    camps to consider their safety in permitting the revenge-hungry Phalangists into
    the camps. As the commission wrote in its final report: <BR> <BR><i>It is our
    view that responsibility is to be imputed to the Minister of Defense for having
    disregarded the danger of acts of vengeance and bloodshed by the Phalangists against
    the population of the refugee camps, and having failed to take this danger into
    account when he decided to have the Phalangists enter the camps. In addition,
    responsibility is to be imputed to the Minister of Defense for not ordering appropriate
    measures for preventing or reducing the danger of massacre as a condition for
    the Phalangists&#39; entry into the camps. These blunders constitute the non-fulfillment
    of a duty with which the Defense Minister was charged.</i> <BR> <BR>I certainly
    think the Phalangist militia had genocidal intent, and that as the competent controlling
    military force in West Beirut at the time, the Israelis had a responsibility to
    be aware of that intent and to prevent it from being acted on. Their failure does
    not imply that they shared that genocidal intent, only that they did not do their
    duty. The Kahan Commission, in insisting that &#39;indirect responsibility&#39;
    be considered, makes the case based on the Jews&#39; own experience as victims
    of massacres and atrocities: <BR> <BR><i>The Jewish public&#39;s stand has always
    been that the responsibility for such deeds falls not only on those who rioted
    and committed the atrocities, but also on those who were responsible for safety
    and public order, who could have prevented the disturbances and did not fulfill
    their obligations in this respect.</i>'

    in what we call &#34;&#39;ashwaa&#39;i&#34; style&#42;. They did have the major

    Israel was physically at the gates of the Palestinian refugee camps on that day,
    and gave an explicit OK to the Chrisitians to go in and carry out the pogroms&#42;.
    Israel wasn&#39;t merely &#34;resposible to prevent it&#34;, it was complicit
    in it, somewhat similar to the way the US is complicit in the oppression of the
    Palestinians by donating military equipment to Israel. <BR> <BR>&#42; To avenge
    the assasination of Basheer Jmayyel - although it was never clear who did that
    - it could have been Israel in fact, since Israel is probably responsible for
    about 50% of the ~250 car bombs that went off during those 17 years. The other
    50% was divided among a dozen or so parties. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    <BR>Yes, it was to this I referred. My point was that they controlled that area
    immediately adjacent to the camps &#40;three sides of Sabra, the fourth being
    held by the Phalangists&#41;. And yes, the Israelis explicitly gave the okay for
    the Phalangists to go into the camps, but it is not at all evident that they did
    so with the intent that the Phalangists would massacre the inhabitants, including
    women and children. This simply is not established. What the Kahan Commission
    found was that the Israeli politicians, military and intelligence commanders had
    not factored the likelihood of the massacre into their planning, which was both
    stupid and negligent of them considering the long and terrible history of tit-for-tat
    factional massacres during the Lebanese civil war. Of course, the question of
    whether there was more than negligence involved would only be answered to general
    satisfaction in a trial, which is why I say this should have been done. I think,
    having read the long report, that the Kahan Commission seems to have done a very
    thorough job, and the importance of the testimony of medical personnel from the
    Gaza Hospital -- witnesses not sympathetic to Israel -- should not be overlooked.
    However, without a trial by an unimpeachably disinterested body, there are always
    going to be suggestions that more than negligence was involved. Which is why I
    think such a trial should have taken place. Of course, there will always be some
    people who will not accept any explanation, however well established by evidence,
    except the one that they have decided in their own minds must be true.

    <BR>That doesn&#39;t make any sense. As they were &#39;mostly victims&#39;, they
    have an understandable &#39;obsession&#39; with persecution. Many of the Armenians
    I&#39;ve met have the same obsession, and it is perfectly understandable. Historically,
    antisemitism comes and goes in waves, and I think you would need to be incredibly
    shortsighted and amnesiac to think that a lull in antisemitic sentiment was likely
    to last for very long. The idea that the Jews create antisemitism is one of the
    sickest antisemitic inversions of all. Given the immense monstrosity of the holocaust,
    I&#39;m saddened that it has only taken three generations for people like you
    to start saying that it should be forgiven and, apparently, forgotten, or at least
    played down. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve said this before and will say it again: it is possible
    to oppose Israel&#39;s policies and actions toward the Palestinians, to sympathise
    with the plight of the Palestinian people and to seek to help them, while never
    once needing to discriminate against <i>Jews</i> &#40;many of whom also oppose
    those policies and share your sympathy for the Palestinians&#41; or ascribe racially,
    ethnically or religiously determined characteristics to a group of people, blaming
    them <i>en masse</i> for the problems of this world. Antisemitism is a choice
    of the antisemite. You can always say no to hatred. <BR> <BR>Hrant, earlier in
    this thread you said the oppressed, not the oppressors, say when &#39;enough is
    enough&#39;. I think you&#39;re right. But there is always the risk that, when
    the oppressed rise up and fight back, they will in turn oppress others. The Jews
    said &#39;enough is enough&#39; on April 19, 1943, and their determination against
    the invading Arab armies in 1948 and throughout the long conflict in the Middle
    East is an expression of that &#39;enough is enough&#39;. I&#39;m not saying this
    to <i>excuse</i> anything that the Israeli government and the IDF have done to
    Palestinians in the occupied territories, but I think it is important for everyone
    who cares about the outcome of this conflict to understand why Israel has become
    the country that it has. Without understanding, there can be no lasting peace:
    understanding is the beginning of sympathy, from which sacrifice and compromise
    may flow. The Israeli leadership and their army have been brutalised by their
    experience, which is a tragedy for them as well as for the Palestinians. Some
    years ago, Ariel Sharon stated publicly that he would do anything, commit any
    crime, to defend the state of Israel against its enemies. That is a despicable,
    extemely dangerous position to take, but I think even that needs to be understood
    -- never excused, but understood. Indeed, the more horrible something is, the
    more desperately we need to try to understand it. To know why and how Israel became
    brutalised -- how that &#39;enough is enough&#39; in the Warsaw Ghetto translates
    into tanks rolling into Nablus, armed settlers staking a claim on Palestinian
    land, and the theft of water from the occupied territories -- is important: it
    suggestes the possibility of de-brutalisation. <BR> <BR>Last year, Archimandrite
    Emile Shoufani of the Greek-Melkite church in Galilee led a group of Israeli Arabs
    -- Moslems and Christians -- along with a group of Arabs from France, on a visit
    to the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camps. The initiative came in for some heavy criticism
    from some Palestinians commentators, some of whom basically said that the Jews
    didn&#39;t deserve to be understood, and there were legitimate concerns about
    how the visit could be used by Israeli propaganda&#42;, but I think the itent
    of the visit is one of the few positive signs to come out the Middle East in the
    past couple of years. As Fr Shoufani -- an ethnic Palestinian -- explained&#34;
    &#39;It is a trip to get to know a place in which the Jewish people lived a reality
    that has not been understood, and on which many of their reactions today depend.&#39;
    Fr Shoufani is the recipient of the 2003 UNESCO &#39;Education for peace&#39;

    important than who&#39;s to blame is the pragmatic question of how to get out
    of this mess. If you want people not to hate you, treat them fairly. Just because
    you weren&#39;t treated fairly at one time doesn&#39;t make it a good idea to
    turn the tables now. During WWII the Jews were powerless. They made it a point
    to harness the alliance &#40;putting it mildy here...&#41; of the superpower that
    was most likely to last longer, and now they&#39;ve become extremely powerful:
    they don&#39;t need to hold on to Palestine to stay secure and prosperous within
    their own broders, but they choose this heartless occupation instead. Not because
    they&#39;re imperliasts, but simply because they&#39;re deluded with persecution
    syndrome. With power comes responsability - not the priviledge to beat down those
    already on the ground. <BR> <BR>BTW, the difference between the Holocaust and
    the Armenian Genocide is huge: we didn&#39;t just lose lives, we lost our <i>ancestral
    land</i>. Furthermore, no reparations -not even an admission- has been made of
    the latter. Even so, Armenians seem much more willing to live as part of the World.
    Why isn&#39;t there rampant anti-Armenian sentiment around the world?  Simple:
    we&#39;re oppressed more than we&#39;re oppressing. And instead of asking me why
    I&#39;m playing down the Holocaust &#40;which I&#39;m not - I&#39;m simply saying
    that the way out of this is for Jews to stop thinking that it&#39;s &#34;them
    or everybody else&#34;&#41;, ask why the Jewish lobby in the US plays down the
    Armenian Genocide. <BR> <BR>&#62; blaming them en masse <BR> <BR>Like I&#39;ve
    said, to me people are responsible for more than their own actions. They are also
    responsible for the actions of people they want to protect &#40;ie their race&#41;.
    It&#39;s sort of like the Chinese saying that you&#39;re responsible for the actions
    of a person who&#39;s life you&#39;ve saved. Again, it&#39;s not a matter of blame,
    but one of compromise: if a given Jew wants Israel to thrive, he must make an
    effort to beat back the warmongers and fundamentailsts. Jews are all tied together
    deep down, just like Armenian and or any other people - don&#39;t overestimate
    the importance of the individual &#40;that&#39;s in fact a classic Western flaw&#41;
    . Behavior is contagious, especially among people who feel close. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
    all for understanding, but I&#39;m also for correcting problems by encouraging

    have cared less about Armenians living in other countries. The Holocaust, on the

    socially and economically assimilated in the world, and yet they were targeted.

    why they are not convinced. I sincerely hope that you are right, and that this
    is a possibility that the Israelis may become convinced of. But surely you can
    understand, given the history, why they consider their borders to be very insecure.
    Tragically, if the Palestinians and other Arabs really do want Israel to exist
    &#39;secure and prosperous&#39; within its borders, sending suicide bombers into
    Israel is just about the worst possible thing to be doing. How are you going to
    convince people that they are safe and can trust you if you keep trying to kill
    them? So far, the most obvious direct result of the second intifada is that the
    Israelis elected Ariel Sharon as Prime Minister: people don&#39;t elect a ruthless

  body: '<i>...the key ingredient in terrorism is a highly oppressed group of people.</i>
    <BR> <BR>That is a major ingredient in the terrorism in Israel and the occupied
    territories. I don&#39;t think you can say it is the key ingredient of terrorism
    in general, which may also stem from fanaticism, fundamentalism, tribalism, and
    other phenomena of human existence. Among other things, terrorism is often employed
    as a strategy of proxy warfare. Last I checked, the Saudi royal family was not
    a highly oppressed group of people, but there is evidence of their financial and
    material support for terrorist organisations. <BR> <BR>Those terminological debates
    aside, I broadly agree with you. The key to peace is to treat people well; the
    guarantee of peace is mutual prosperity. I think this has to come from sympathy
    which, as I wrote above, begins with understanding. This has to come from both
    sides and, of course, there are very many people on both sides who seek this,
    despite the policies of their leaders and those who claim to protect them. <BR>
    <BR> <BR>Gerald, whether you use the term &#39;suicide bomber&#39; &#40;which
    is a description of their tactic&#41; or &#39;freedom fighter&#39; &#40;which
    <i>may</i> be a description of their motivation &#40;if they&#39;re from Hamas,
    I prefer to accept their own explanation of their motivation: &#39;obliteration&#39;
    of Israel&#41;&#41;, what seems clear is that the strategy is doing the Palestinian
    people no good at all. As I noted above, the only obvious result to date is the
    election of Ariel Sharon as Prime Minister of Israel. <BR> <BR>By the way, you
    never responded to my suggestion, above, that the Palestinians might try Gandhian
    non-violent resistance, which you were the first to mention. <BR> <BR><i>Recent
    polls show that over 97% of Americans believe intifada to mean holy war.</i> <BR>
    <BR>What polls? This is sadly typical, and I&#39;ll bear it in mind when I use
    this word in future. Rest assured that I know what the word means, and do not
    use it with propandistic intent. <BR> <BR>Mind you, a bunch of Middle East Studies
    academics have been running around since the WTC attack trying to convince people
    that <i>jihad</i> does not mean holy war, so people are understandably confused.'

  body: John, you still need physical bodies willing to die for terrorism to work
    well. Money doesn&#39;t create those - in fact its absense does. For example there
    are far fewer Catalan terrorists than Basque ones because poverty is much lower
    among the former. I&#39;m not saying everybody has to be equally rich &#40;materially&#41;,
    but when the distribution is seen as unfair you get war. This is in fact the main
    reason to stop globalization. We&#39;re basically buying those DVD gadgets and
    monster SUVs at the price of the blood of others - indirectly, but still. <BR>
    <BR>Also, terrorism works better against democratic countries&#42;, and you could
    even say it&#39;s more justifiable &#40;or less unjustifiable - depending on how
    one likes to look at it&#41; against democratic countries, since people vote to
    kill the enemy. The internal conflict now welling up in earnest among Israeli
    Jews themselves is a sign that the greatest thing the warmongers and fundamentalists
    should fear&#42;&#42; isn&#39;t some desparate Palestinian teenagers, but civil
    war, or possibly a police state followed by a coup d&#39;etat. It&#39;s time to
    let go. <BR> <BR>&#42; I mean in the long run. I think that in the case of Israel
    for example the election of a criminal as head of state is just a matter of things
    having to get worse before they get better. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42; Or maybe it&#39;s
    their greatest hope?  :-/ <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    things with you, but I think it is better, for the sake of my blood pressure if
    nothing else, if I stop visiting this thread after Gerald&#39;s latest hateful

  body: John, <BR> <BR><i>...the death of Christ is not only irrational</i>  <BR>
    <BR>A resurrection is irrational. <BR> <BR>On your other concerns. Firstly I am
    not familiar with the Bible, that does not make me anti-semite. I know you think
    that I am listening to kooks. <i>Believe me I am!</i>  I have never read the bible.
    I cant&#39; hold the <i>nose of disbelief</i> long enough. Instead I am made to
    suffer through the many faces and manifestations of would be dragon slayers and
    beasts in the name of religion. Which in my opinion, is all of them. <BR> <BR>Including
    mind readers John. <BR> <BR>I have merely been reading some of the discourse on
    the latest movie. It is one of the areas of contention. Sorry for reading the
    movie reviews. <BR> <BR>I do not see how anyone could believe that there was any
    such thing as a resurrection. Then again you guys believe in Santa Clause and
    the Easter Bunny. In any event, I never intend to read the Bible. Recitals from
    the locusts of <i>many holy roller cults</i> is all I can take. <BR> <BR>What
    I have noticed about religious people when they want to talk about religion, they
    are not interested in dialogue. They merely want you to listen to their fairy
    tale. <BR> <BR>Which goes like this. <BR> <BR>----------- <BR><i>&#39;The reason
    my Father loves me is that I lay down my life--only to take it up again. No-one
    takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay
    it down and authority to take it up again. This command I received from my Father.&#39;
    John 10:17-18 </i> <BR>--------- <BR> <BR>What doe that mean? Try this, it means
    nothing to me! <BR> <BR>This addresses no issue. Particularly a large zero for
    a <i>non  believer.</i> If you read it you will find the same. It is a bunch of
    gobbly gook. <BR> <BR>I have given you a mistaken impression about my beliefs
    on religion. <BR> <BR>Firstly the Mysterious Pooh Bah was a real person. He was
    the <i>de facto</i> consular for the entire planet. He merely did good work for
    the citizens of Jerusalem. He was like me, he did not care if they were a Jew,
    a Christian or a Muslim. It did not matter which religion they came from. He was
    a humanitarian.  So please do not think I get down on my knees and pray to him.
    It would make no difference if I had a free trip to Spain when I was dead or not.
    Or did you miss that inconsistency? <BR> <BR>In other words John, formal religion
    is a crock and you know it. Also if you visit the concept of the <i>&#34;virgin&#34;</i>
    Mary, it merely meant she was a young woman. Such as in virgin olives, us Italians
    do not <i>verify the hymen</i> of the olive to determine if it is sacred enough
    to eat. <BR> <BR>The religious <i>&#34;corporations&#34;</i> are sexual perverts,
    all have bizarre understanding of the reproductive process. All preach perversions
    of natural human functions not to mention the irrefutable Catholic predisposition
    towards little boys. <BR> <BR>You understand where that is going. <BR> <BR>I have
    said that freedom of religion is sacred. However I have never said that I find
    &#34;anything sacred in religion itself&#34;. In sum total, religion for the most
    part, <i>makes mockery out of common sense, folly out of wisdom, its biggest victim
    is morality herself.</i> Should we list the wars, count the dead. For that matter
    the Protestant Printers. <BR> <BR>If there should be anything sacred it would
    be that which has <i>relieved</i> the most pain in this world. <BR> <BR><i>&#34;A
    mother&#39;s kiss&#34;.</i> <BR> <BR>If I were to believe in killing I would hold
    the view than anyone praying should be shot on site. Religion is roots of  murder
    &#40;war&#41;. Followers are their accomplice, at least but more often than not,
    <i>they do the dirty work.</i> <BR> <BR>I am anti-religious but that still does
    not make me anti-semite. I am all inclusive. So no, they are &#34;not special&#34;
    just one of many. No better or worse than Christians. <BR> <BR><i>Beware of goblins,
    religion is koo koo. Religions are outdated &#34;Life Insurance Corporations.</i>
    <BR> <BR>So now I have taken you this far I am sure you have concluded that I
    am not spiritual which would be incorrect. I just do not believe in the <i>super-natural</i>.
    Sorry but I like to plant my feet on the soil. <BR> <BR>Back to you original accusation.
    <BR> <BR>I know you have met my son Luke, I do not know if you have met my other
    son. My other son is the closest to me. I write him more often than any other
    person. We are very close. <BR> <BR>His name, <i>Jordan Friedman</i>, his mother
    is Jewish. He was in the process of becoming a Rabbi when he fell in love. &#40;remember
    the natural&#41; From him I have two grand daughters. <BR> <BR>Nice try, no cigar!
    <BR> <BR>Please do not apologize <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> I am tired of that. <BR> <BR>Sorry no witches or hobba
    gobblins for you to burn today. Maybe you could <i>sacrifice a virgin instead.</i>
