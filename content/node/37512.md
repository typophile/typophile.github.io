body: "So I've just ran into a predicament.\r\nI'm placing a block of text into a
  booklet, in a template that was used in previous booklets (where I've seen some
  fractional inconsistencies in text sizes from booklet to booklet), and everything
  is working so great.  The paragraphs of text on the first page are magically ending
  at the bottom of the page using the maximum number of lines allowed, but I run into
  a problem with the 2nd, final page of this copy.  The last paragraph ends at the
  bottom line, but there still needs to be author credits below, placed a line-spacing
  below the last paragraph.  I certainly don't want this one-line credit to be on
  the following page all alone and crying for company, so I am faced with some decisions.\r\n\r\nWhat
  would you do?\r\na)edit the copy (and make it 2 lines shorter (which is very difficult
  since it's such a short body of copy)?\r\nb)change the point size of the type by
  fractions (making it a slightly different size than the rest of the type used in
  the booklet)?\r\nc)pose this question on typophile.com?\r\nd)something that I'm
  not thinking of at the moment?\r\n\r\nIn desperate need of advice,\r\n-David"

    now and then. In this case changing the pointsize of that last line sounds like
    a viable solution, especially because of the nature of the line. But sometimes
    I ask if the writer can cut the copy if it really doesn't work out."

  body: "If it isn't critical that the type size and leading be precisely the same
    in each booklet, you could simply reduce the point size and/or leading slightly
    for both pages of copy (you don't want to adjust just part of it in this manner).
    Not knowing the design, I can't say whether it would be better to let the first
    page run a couple of lines short, or whether a couple of lines of the first paragraph
    on the second page should go to the bottom of the first page.\r\n\r\nEditing to
    shorten by two lines is hard with brief copy, though if you have a couple of paragraphs
    where there are only a couple of words on the last line, you can probably edit
    those paragraphs sufficiently to eliminate the last lines."

  body: "Yeah I think changing the point size was the best route. Since this was only
    2 pages of copy, I reduced the point size of the text on the last page by .4pt
    (7->6.6), keeping the line spacing the same, and it looks A-OK.\r\n\r\nI did initially
    try to edit out a few filler words, and while I didn't butcher this fellow's essay
    nor find anything to delete, I discovered a few grammatical errors that I will
    never be thanked for correcting.\r\n\r\nThanks for the 2nd opinion!  I don't feel
    as guilty doing what I did.\r\n\r\nRight on.  I'm working too late (again).\r\n\r\nBlack

    type size for both pages equally wouldn't resolve in such a nice ending of paragraphs
    as they are.  Since page one ends right at the end of a paragraph, the size adjusting
    would need to be more severe, since a fractional change would end up not bringing
    the next paragraph up from the proceeding page, but just creating the dead space
    that would naturally be between the paragraphs had it been a larger text box,
    and I'm already pushing it by moving the type below 7pt.\r\n\r\nOne question though:
    \ Do you hold leading or type size to be more sacred?  My opinion is that having
    the same number of lines, and having the lines line up with one another is most
    important, as it would be the most noticable adjustment and can potentially throw
    everything else off-kilter."

    thought of adjusting the tracking on this.  That may be even less noticeable than
    a .4pt size reduction.  I think adding or reducing lines would intrude with the

    an extra page for half a paragraph.\r\n\r\nAgain, thanks.  All your responses

  body: I find the measure too wide for comfortable reading on the first page of text.
    I realize this formatting is probably carved in stone with this series, but it's
    something to consider if you're designing a new one from scratch. Generally around
    60 characters per line should be the maximum, though with very generous leading
    you can increase that a bit. Your character count is over 100. The eye has to
    make too many hops to get across, and then has trouble efficiently picking out
    the beginning of the next line.

    \ I myself, patting self on shoulder, try to keep my words-per-line average somewhere
    around 8-13.  Luckily this is the only page with a text block that wide.  I can
    try to propose 8pt type with an overall line-spacing of 11.25pt (I think that
    just might be able to line up if the lines are in multiples of 4).\r\n\r\nJust
    out of curiosity, and not to throw too many topics around in one thread, but what
    do you lot think about MrsEaves at such a small size, or even in general?  I don't
    know if it's just me, but the x-height seems to be a bit too low for small point
    sizes."

    there are other versions that would do better for that), but for purposes that
    suit it, I think it's great, and it seems to work here. Mrs. Eaves doesn't have
    high contrast or exceptionally thin strokes, and it has generous letter spacing,
    so it survives small point sizes better than many typefaces. As long as you give
    it plenty of leading, the small x-height is not a drawback.\r\n\r\nBy the way,
    the pdf I downloaded shows a slanted roman rather than the true italic on the
    last page for \"The Outskirts of Deep City.\" Is it supposed to be that way, or
    is it a pdf problem?"
