  characters? Are measurements made of just the characters themselves, or does the
  measurement measure the sidebearings? Does one just measure the numbers of characters-per-pica
  and compare that? Or is this just one of those things that a researcher does however
  he or she feels is appropriate?\r\n\r\nAnd has anyone ever seen a script that can
  just flow through a font and calculate the average width of alphanumeric characters?"

  body: "For Mac PS Type 1 fonts, the same data is in the AFM file (also a text file).
    \r\n\r\nAfter some header information, the metrics information begins with \"StartCharMetrics.\"
    The information for each character takes this format:\r\n\r\nC 65 ; WX 642 ; N
    A ; B 2 0 640 651 ;\r\n\r\nFirst is the character ID number (C), then the width
    (WX), then the character name (N), then the coordinates for the bounding box (B).
    The bounding box measures the four extreme points of the glyph -- left, bottom,
    right, top.\r\n\r\nIn this example, character number 65 has an advance width of
    642 and is the letter A. The left sidebearing is 2; it sits on the baseline, 0;
    the actual width of the glyph is 638 units (rightmost point, 640, minus the leftmost,
    2); the height is 651 units. By subtracting the rightmost coordinate from the
    advance width, you get the right sidebearing of 2.\r\n\r\nWhether these measurements
    are a useful standard for comparison or not is a different question.\r\n\r\n--

    per pica that were once supplied by each type manufacturer with the font, but
    no longer seem to be. (Of course since fonts are no longer sold in a one size
    basis, the pica might not be the ideal measurement anymore. But even if the cpp
    of 10 or 12 point was given, it would provide comparison.)\r\n\r\nBut I don't
    know how they calculated the cpp. Was it based on the whole alphabet, or some
    standard of commonly used letters?"
