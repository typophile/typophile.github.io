  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I liked the unusual uncial script used for Talisa Stark&rsquo;s letter in the most recent Game of Thrones episode:</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6i6oGTFzUVE/UZBFQbkhKPI/AAAAAAAADG4/mjdGcb5qE2Q/s1600/From+the+Set+-+Talisa%27s+Letter.jpg">http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6i6oGTFzUVE/UZBFQbkhKPI/AAAAAAAADG4/mjdGcb5qE2Q/s1600/From+the+Set+-+Talisa%27s+Letter.jpg</a></p>
<p>So I decided to make a font out of it:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cinga.ch/type/volantene.png">http://www.cinga.ch/type/volantene.png</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to put it up on MyFonts as soon as possible&hellip;  probably I won&rsquo;t make it until the next episode airs, but still. I figure I&rsquo;ll offer it for free, since it&rsquo;s really more of a fan service than anything serious. That will also free me from the obligation to fill in all the annoying symbols and special characters.  ;o) I&rsquo;ve always wanted to release a font for free to attract some attention to my foundry, and this seems like a good PR opportunity.</p>
<p>If you see something that needs changing, do tell me, but make it quick.  I expect to submit it within a day. I know the {B} is out of character, I&rsquo;ll definitely change that.</p>

In the latter case, if you&rsquo;d list them here, I could do something about them and leave a better impression in the first place.  ;o)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m toying with the idea of pricing the font at $5, and putting up a password-protected sale that gives you the font for free if you say &ldquo;hello&rdquo; in Valyrian (which, frankly, is just a google away). That way, the target audience (Game of Thrones fans) are not discouraged by a credit card hurdle, while I might still make some money off the font later when the sale is over.  ;o)  Do you think that&rsquo;s too complicated?</p>
<p>The base price of $5 should also clearly state that this is not the same kind of product as my $25 fonts.</p>
<p>PS: I updated the link above. The new {B} is much nicer.</p>

<ul>
<li>You started this very recently.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;re not a type design god. :-)  Even though you know I like your work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus you plan on releasing this today. Considering you&rsquo;ve spent more time on your commercial releases (even though you <em>are</em> very fast) it just seems to make sense that this would probably be not as well-made, hence a poor reflection on what paying customers get. What I&rsquo;m getting at is that even a free font shouldn&rsquo;t be too rushed.</p>
<p>Free-versus-minimal_price: I used to think charging a nominal amount makes sense, but then I realized it&rsquo;s counter to the purpose of maximum-exposure. As for a &ldquo;Game of Thrones&rdquo; mini-barrier, I think that makes sense for a free font, but for a paid one it does seem like too much.</p>
<blockquote>The base price of $5 should also clearly state that this is not the same kind of product as my $25 fonts.</blockquote>
<p>I think many people (in the realm of free/very_cheap fonts) don&rsquo;t pay that kind of attention. :-/  Just say it in the initial MyFonts description (which many free-font people won&rsquo;t even read though, but them you don&rsquo;t need to worry about impressing, since they very rarely buy anything - you just need them to expose your work through usage).</p>
<p>All that said, doing very steep introductory discounts does seem to be the go-to strategy on MyFonts:

Not quite sure I understand you right. Do you agree the mini-barrier is appropriate if the result is a free font (while is isn't free by default)?</div>

I&rsquo;m not sure what you mean by narrowing {T} at the bottom, but I made the whole letter narrower; does that address the issue? I also noticed {A N M} were too dark; fixed.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/OITNAO_6650.png" alt=""></p>
<p>As for {X x}, I rather like them the way they are&hellip; sure, they&rsquo;re extra-special, but I tried more normal designs at first (including descenders on the lc), and they failed spectacularly. Maybe I just went at it the wrong way. Do you have an example of the shape you would suggest?</p>
<p>The font is 100% drawn on screen with Glyphs. I don&rsquo;t own a broad-nib pen.</p>
<p>@ Hrant: I don&rsquo;t worry about zombies downloading my font; I rather worry about people wanting my font and ending up discouraged by the barrier. Something easy to know is just fine then.</p>

It&rsquo;s obviously an entirely different style, but my [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/teeline/ambicase-fatface/regular/glyphs/506647/314|swash X from Ambicase Fatface]] might have been in the back of my head when suggesting an X with extenders.</div>
