  body: "@ Sobocan: As you probably speak English as a second language, in the spirit
    of typographic education, note the difference between the terms [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typography|typography]]
    and [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Font|font]]. I believe the word you were looking
    for was \"<em>Who know which <strong>font</strong></em>\u2026?\"\r\n\r\nAnd I
    agree with Dezcom. It looks like [[http://www.linotype.com/12649/univers57condensed-font.html|Univers
    57 Condensed]]."
