body: "I am checking kerning on an old four-master MM font that will shortly go into
  production as separate masters. Let us suppose that I change a kerning value in
  one master and wish to proliferate the same version to the other masters. What is
  the easiest way of doing this?\r\n\r\n(Shades of my old request: Fontlab needs a
  'magic' button which, when active, performs the following function: 'whatever I
  am doing in one master - - changing spacing, a point, a BCP, kerning - - do the
  same thing in all the other masters.)"

  body: "Slightly off topic sorry but could you explain the reason for having a four-master
    MM font. I've only just started using MM fonts to interpolate the intermediate
    weights where I have 2 masters - a light weight and a bold weight. Do your masters
    account for other dimensions ?\r\n\r\n\r\nRr"

  body: "Bill, your magic button idea is a good one. I don't know of any short cut
    to your request. I just switch the master view in the metrics window and edit
    the value. I wonder if the python wunderkind have a solution.\r\n\r\nRachelR,
    you can have up to 16 masters in a MM font. Bill's four master font might include
    weight and width. If he added optical size to his four master font he would have
    to add four more masters. Then if he wanted to something that altered a feature,
    say serifs he would have to ad eight more masters."

  body: "Bill,\r\n\r\nHaven't worked with MM font metrics, so this may not apply.
    With that caveat, if you want to selectively say yes or no to a kerning change
    for all masters, I don't know a fast way. But if the changes in one are to be
    global, that is, apply to all masters, why not write off AFM files, put in the
    new kerning data, and import for each?\r\n\r\nI've found using an AFM file and
    a good text editor useful for all sort of \"kerning-copying.\" Easy to edit, and
    if you think about it, easy to make an \"old\" and  \"new\", put an asterisk after
    each pair on the \"new\", combine, sort, & delete all multiples without an asterisk,
    whatever . . ."

  body: Charles, I've done that, and it is a good way. But I've also found that unless
    you're really awake, it's perilously easy to make an error. That said, it might
    be the fastest way around my problem, even though you'd have to generate the separate
    AFMs, etc. etc.

  body: 'Here''s one clumsy way of proliferating identical values through masters:
    edit one master; export it as a single master; add axes as necessary to match
    the original; expand master. You can now copy the values from one font to the
    other using paste special. '

  body: "This is what I would do:\r\n\r\n1. Go to the Metric Window.\r\n2. Activate
    the \"source\" master.\r\n3. Export a (single master) AFM file. This only exports
    the active master.\r\n4. Activate the \"target\" master.\r\n5. Import the AFM
    file, replace all kerning but not the metrics. This only affects the active master.\r\n\r\nNo
    text editor, no multiple AFM files, not error-prone."

  body: "\"... whatever I am doing in one master - - changing spacing, a point, a
    BCP, kerning - - do the same thing in all the other masters.\"\r\nAny time you
    want you can ditto the kerning and spacing. But I'm not familiar with this particular
    need, and suspect most are not. The reason is, I've never wanted to exactly ditto
    an edit among all the other masters. In many instances, as I've been adding masters,
    I've found the source to be incorrect in some detail, wanted to change that and
    echo it into other masters, but not ditto. Adding a bcp, I do all of the time
    from improper vision in the first master's digitization, but again, each point
    added in a pole is an echo from the master and not a ditto. The making of the
    difference between the ditto and the echo is our job, one I don't think I'd like
    to try and keep track of ex post magic buttono. ;)\r\n\r\n\"Then if he wanted
    to [do] something that altered a feature, say serifs he would have to add eight
    more masters.\"\r\nS/he would have to add eight more masters, true, but to be
    clear, not eight new masters. Adding only by doubling the masters is required
    for the mechanism, and may not be for the design. So e.g. one could only need
    6 unique masters in a 16 style MM space to reach a set of stylistic options, as
    you know.\r\n\r\nCheers!"
