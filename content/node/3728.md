  body: That&#39;s almost it. The real font is called &#34;Irvin&#34;  after Rea Irvin
    the original New Yorker art director. The main difference between the fonts like
    FF New Yorker, Manhattan and  Upper West Side, which are all Irvin look-alikes,
    is the Q. See the following sample scanned from McGrew&#39;s &#34;American Metal
    Typefaces of the Twentieth Century&#34; <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/29037.gif"
    alt="Irvin Sample"> <BR> <BR>The next two samples are Manhattan from Franklin
    Type Founders &#40;at Precision Type&#41; and Upper West Side from Intecsas &#40;also
    at Precision Type&#41;. You&#39;ll notice that only the Intecsas font tried to
    get the lettering right. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/29038.gif"

  body: You&#39;re right Mike. There are a lot of interpretations that I overlooked.
    <BR>I am also told that the actual font used by the magazine &#40;maybe <BR>not
    for the masthead itself but when they are doing illustrations <BR>with similar
    type&#41; was commissioned to Monotype and is called <BR>&#34;Irvin&#34;. It matches
    perfectly but is assumedly not for retail.
