  body: "Tomii, thanks for the quick reply. This is *almost* dead-on. I see differences
    in the cap \"W\" and lowercase \"r\". Could be that the designer accessed alternate
    characters, but I can't seem to access them on the Sudtipos site. If someone does
    not send a derivation of this, I will probably purchase one of your selections.
    Thanks again! \r\n\r\n\u2013 Michael Wit"

    character map of Mousse Script Alternate from Veer''s site. It seems to have similar
    W and r, though your sample is very small. The reason I mentioned Glengary is
    because it''s also based on  Stephenson Blake''s Glenmoy.'

  body: "I couldn't see that page (they want you to register for the site). I will
    register on Veer and take a look, but I trust that you are correct. I think Mousse
    Script is the correct font. Thanks for the help!\r\n\r\n\u2013 Michael Wit"
