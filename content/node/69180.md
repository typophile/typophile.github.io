  body: Somewhere I've seen the small "of." The printed letters can't be calligraphy.
    Please take another look. Thank you.

  body: "What do you mean with \"printed letters\"?\r\nThere are just the Es that
    are repeating, and even these don't seem identical.\r\nWhy they \"can't be calligraphy\"?\r\n\r\nThat
    said, there's plenty of calligraphic fonts, and it could be that some monolinear
    script contains a \"of\" ligature (or catchword).\r\n\r\nMaybe someone more expert
    in the field than me (which isn't difficult) could chime in and suggest some similar
    alternatives.\r\n"

  body: "I think Riccardo is right about the main calligraphy, although it is similar
    to [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/grouptype/ovidius/|Ovidius]]. I thought 'of'
    might have been from Plumero Script, but it's not in the glyph map. I'd guess
    it's hand-drawn too.\r\n\r\nFinally, the \"GREAT CHEFS\" lettering is similar
    to [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/poetica/|Poetica Chancery II]], but I think
    it is also hand-drawn, because the two E's seem not to be identical, just as Riccardo
    noted.\r\n\r\nLooks like I agree completely with Riccardo.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    the last thing I had hoped to hear. Thank you again.
