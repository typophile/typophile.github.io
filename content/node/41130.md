  body: Typophile Books is an organic and living thing. Constantly in need of nurturing
    and support. At present it doesn't have anything specifically about textbook design,
    but there are a few books about book design. In the very near future it will take
    on a new life and at that time we will grow it even more. If you have suggestions
    for books, or suggestions in general, which should be added now you can always
    contact myself or Eben.

    will contribute - I just thought maybe one of us may have a suggestion, so that
    I can jump start my research by piggybacking on my friends experience. "

  body: "Textbook design has changed (like everything else) in the past couple of
    decades. College is very different from school, and the lists within disciplines
    are very different.\r\n\r\nOne unfortunate trend that developed in the 1990s is
    custom publishing, which allows a professor to compile content from various sources
    and get custom books. This segment has grown and the result is that content gets
    hastily fitted to boilerplate designs. On the other end of the spectrum you have
    the blockbuster books that tend to look like bad magazine design where every page
    is different and full of photoshop effects and noise.\r\n\r\nThroughout this transition
    the editorial quality has also shifted. Manuscripts are no longer developed (developmental
    editors are no more) and the signing editors no longer read them. Design standards
    have also taken a back seat. As the imprints are sold, repacked and resold, the
    skilled and better payed workers are replaced with less qualified workers that
    don't have the same standards.\r\n\r\nYou also have the churn associated with
    the education lists as fads in education style come in and go out. Whole Learning?
    Anyone?\r\n\r\nAll this is to say, if you are interested in designing books that
    serve children well you may find yourself with few collaborators.\r\n\r\nIf I
    were you I would buy a few used books in the specific area of interest. Look at
    how they are revised because the industry runs on the forced roll where a new
    edition is foisted on the students whether they need it or not. Very often they
    are dressing up old content with very few revisions so the old design/content
    won't vary much.\r\n\r\nI think the industry really needs to rediscover basic
    design standards. The industry is much more political than you might guess, and
    large states that represent large adoptions are often given a good deal of control
    over the content. \r\n\r\nAnother opinion:\r\nhttp://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0000hB\r\n"

    satisfy a vanity of getting to choose what to include, but the end result is not
    the equal to the texts published on their own. The cost of making custom books
    is competitive, but not always less. You can''t pick and choose content and expect
    a cohesive result. Authors have voices, and books have apparatus and elements
    that differ from book to book. '

    to find a decent textbook to assign for college classes: for the reasons you described
    and others as well, the textbooks published on their own are often rubbish. The
    author probably has more knowledge of or interest in some parts of the subject,
    and might explain those well, but the rest of the book is likely to be an uninspired
    rehash of what the author found in other textbooks. By picking and choosing, you
    can get something that is not cohesive, but at least each of the parts is adequate.
    In a good book the whole should be much more than the sum of the parts, but that
    isn't happening in either case."
