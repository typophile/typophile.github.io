  for a sans serif font for a TV operator logo. The current logo is based on Helvetica,
  but I'm now looking for a more dynamic, strong and a little bit younger sans serif
  font for the updated logo. The font should be businesslike, but still have a bit
  more personality. The company name is quite short and in its current logo form vanishes
  easily when it's used between many other operator logos.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions
  are highly appreciated! Thanks!\r\n\r\n"
