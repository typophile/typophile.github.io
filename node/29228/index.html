  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi all,

Does anyone know any good quotes about designers?
Not about design or type design, which we had great posting about,
but ON or ABOUT designers...

I found this one,

"Good designers make trouble." -Tibor Kalman

anyone?

thanks,...

		<div class="commentbody">This designer is really not so much of a has-been, but more of a definitely won't-be.
When this designer opens her mouth, it seems that this is only to change whichever foot was previously in there.
This designer reminds me very much of a gyroscope - always spinning around at a frantic pace, but not really going anywhere.
This young lady has delusions of adequacy.
When he joined my agency, this designer was something of a granny; since then he has aged considerably.
This designer sets low personal standards and then consistently fails to achieve them.
This designer has the wisdom of youth, and the energy of old age.
This designer should go far - and the sooner he starts, the better.
Works well when under constant supervision and cornered like a rat in a trap.
This designer is depriving a village somewhere of an idiot.
Only occasionally wets himself under pressure.

"Designers are people too"
from Emigre's #45 cover.

Found Idea Magazine #314 at a store,
i had nevere seen this magazine before,
and i was completely fascinated. 
Big bucks in production, but amazing results!!
