    chose Dutch type making for this project specifically for the intricate and unique
    typefaces produced. I will update with more info as I continue searching. I would
    also appreciate more input/advice from others. <BR> <BR>EDIT: I am looking into
    the possibility of a typophile in my area with this book seeing as it is more
    than $500 US to get a used copy. Library has the worst selection of typography
    books I&#39;ve ever seen. You&#39;d think being a major research university, they&#39;d
    have more. Any other ideas? <BR> <BR>Rob&#60;/font&#62;'

  body: 'I&#39;m no expert, but John&#39;s recommendation is certainly very good.
    Compared to the 1908 edition, the 1978 edition has the advantage of being in English
    &#40;unless you [also] read French&#41;, being updated &#40;although I don&#39;t
    know if much was added concerning F&#39;man&#41;, and being much more easily obtainable&#42;.
    The 1908 edition however has the advantage of being [even] better printed - this
    is especially apparent in some smaller sizes and on pages containing both large
    and small fonts. If you hit a wall trying to find a copy of one or the other,
    let me know. <BR> <BR>&#42; In fact I was under the impression that it was available
    <i>new</i> for around $250! <BR> <BR>Also of interest might be &#34;Fleischman
    on Punchcutting&#34;, although: it&#39;s more of a &#34;trophy&#34; book; the
    type used seems damaged &#40;look at the &#34;e&#34;&#41;. <BR> <BR>Influences:
    I&#39;ve had trouble noticing any. F&#39;man was a genius &#40;and I never use
    that word lightly&#41;. To me Rosart is subordinate, and Bodoni was an artist,
    not in the same craftsman league. As for F&#39;man&#39;s influence on later designs
    &#40;like Caslon&#41;, my feeling is that only the superficial merits were taken,
    leaving the core untapped. <BR> <BR>BTW, there is a font among the ones that F&#39;man
    cut that stands out as his pinnacle: the #65. The fabulous ideas in it have yet
    to be really understood. And as nice and useful as Dutch type is now, something
    has been lost from F&#39;man. <BR> <BR>hhp'

    interested in seeing and reading more about F&#39;man. If I am unable to get copies

  body: 'Speaking of &#39;Fleischmann on Punchcutting&#39;, you should definitely
    get hold of a copy of Fred Smeijer&#39;s <i>Counterpunch.</i> I can&#39;t remember
    how much of it is specific to Fleischmann, but it will give you a good insight
    into how the type was made. <BR> <BR>The <a href="http://www.preusstype.com/pdf/FMGot_Spec_eng.pdf"><i>Fleischmann
    Gotische PT</i></a> from Preuss Type is worth taking a look at and has a decent
    biographical note. <BR> <BR>Regarding the ethical question, I consider scholarship
    fair use, but the legal question depends on where you reside. The 1908 edition
    is out of copyright, but you would need to be able to read French. The 1978 edition
    is still in copyright, so would be subject to whatever the law is regarding copyright
    in your jurisdiction &#40;note, not the law in the country of origin&#41;. <BR>
    <BR>There is a practical issue, also, which is that the book is <i>huge</i>. I
    only have one or two books in my library that are larger. So it would be difficult
    to scan. But pages could be photographed by someone with a table-mount or a steady
    hand. I have taken macro-shots of all the Granjon Greeks in the book, and a few
    other pages. Here is a fascinating type, Van den Velde&#39;s English No.28: <BR><img

  body: 'In the past I have borrowed the 1978, making photocopies of some parts and
    600dpi scans to compare against the 1908, which I have on what seems to be an
    indefinite loan from UCLA. And yes, these are bulky books - a lot of ginger propping
    required to get good scans and avoid damage. <BR> <BR>BTW, here&#39;s a collage
    I did about a year ago: <BR>&#40;175 Kb&#41; <a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Fman65.gif"
    target="_blank">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Fman65.gif</a> <BR>The &#34;Jan&#34;
    is Jan Middendorp. <BR> <BR>Speaking of cameras, I recently I bought a used Ricoh
    RDC-7, and it&#39;s quite amazing: it&#39;s &#34;only&#34; 3.3 megapixels, but
    it has a double-exposure &#34;Pro&#34; mode that offsets two shots by half a pixel
    and effectively gets double the resolution, although only in the horizontal dimension;
    that wouldn&#39;t be such a big deal of itself, except when you factor in the
    camera&#39;s ability to take macro shots at <i>one centimeter</i> distance! The
    net result is an effective resolution of over 2000 dpi. Now, the Pro mode does
    require a stable shot, but I&#39;ve used a tripod with good results. The biggest
    drawback of a camera versus a scanner though is that only the very center of a
    macro photo is in total focus... unless I make some kind of precision concave
    backing plate that I could nestle pages on.  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>Another cool feature
    the camera has is a 1-bit &#34;text&#34; mode that results in much smaller image
    sizes; although the result has no anti-aliasing, it makes it possible to photograph
    many pages and then run them through OCR with great results - sort of like a spy
    camera! <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: John <BR> <BR>Thanks for being a great resource. I&#39;m actually waiting
    for my copy of Counterpunch to arrive. Too bad it&#39;s on a month back order
    from amazon. I am lucky to have a professor who has done a lot of the stuff I
    am learning about; so not only am I trying to realize how these amazing dutch&#40;german&#41;
    typographers  were influenced/inspired, but also how they went about from start
    to finish. <BR> <BR>That image is fantastic. Are there any online repositories
    of specimens of this type? &#40;dutch type&#41; The file you linked me was the
    same one my professor was showing me last week. It&#39;s really nice, but alas,
    the specimen books are my goal. <BR> <BR>Rob

    in tomorrow. The good thing is, I have unlimited resources as far as technology
    is concerned. &#40;or darned near&#41; The problem again is getting access to
    extensive specimens. I do have access to a table-mounted slr camera with macro.
    God knows, I wouldn&#39;t need it, but if I did, I have access. <BR> <BR>Thanks
    again for any recommendations.

    copy of it - and I rely on that mechanism heavily. <BR> <BR>1&#41; I know somebody
    who might sell his 1978. What&#39;s a fair price to you? <BR> <BR>2&#41; I wouldn&#39;t
    sell copies of my copies of the 1978. And even giving them away might be beyond
    the ethical threshold &#40;even if it&#39;s Fair Use&#41;. <BR> <BR>3&#41; I guess
    I can sell you copies or scans from the 1908. Like I said though it&#39;s UCLA&#39;s,
    so maybe I&#39;d need to keep like 50% of the proceeds as a shipping &amp; handling
    fee or something and make the rest a donation to the UCLA library! :-&#41; Or
    maybe 1/3rd each for me, UCLA and TEFF... Are you looking for specimen scans,
    or the text, or both? Because the 1908 text <i>is</i> in French. But hey, if you
    don&#39;t read French you could then pay me to translate as well. ;-&#41; So how
    much dough are we talking about? FYI, the last time I checked, the street price
    for the 1908 was about $1200... <BR> <BR>BTW, if you need a dpi greater than 600
