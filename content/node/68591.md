body: "I started on a new headline sans serif font last week. I made the full Latin
  1 character set, and when I first installed it, it lacked uc I, H and K. I uninstalled
  it, checked the .vfb file with all uc glyphs, and tried again. Now I got a warning:
  the font was uninstallable.\r\n\r\nI did not copy anything from any other programs,
  or font files; this font was made solely in FontLab Studio 5.04 Mac.\r\n\r\nHas
  anybody else had this sort of problem?\r\n\r\nHere's a screenshot of the font (no
  pdf obviously):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/T_4019.png]"

    Fonts folder and Adobe's Fonts folder in my Finder window sidebars. When I want
    to install a font, I just drag-copy it to one of those folders, and delete the
    font to uninstall it. I generally install development fonts only into the Adobe
    Fonts folder until I'm fairly far along. Adobe apps are smart enough to know when
    a font has been changed, even if the name is the same."

  body: "Thanks, Mark-\r\n\r\nApple lately has not been the shining light for type
    design like it was in the '90s. And that's a shame. I quess Apple is just busy
    looking for the next new thing. They seem to have forgotten that any change comes
    with written word. Not spoken. Or sang, or shouted. It has always been about type;
    1445, 1870, 1920, 1955, 1985 to to-day (years approximate). Apple has been a tool
    for creative people, but now it seems that Apple just goes for leasure. Should
    we look for somewhere else?\r\n\r\nI'll try your method after I get some feedback
    from FontLab (being a scaredycat)."

  body: For whatever reason, the font cache in OS X is very sticky. It seems to assume
    that fonts never change. For normal users, that's true 99.99% of the time, so
    it's a non-issue. For font developers it's a problem. I just work around it and
    all is peachy.

    that it includes a fpgm table as some versions of FontBook dislike TTF's without
    this table.

    headaches."

  body: "Indeed, Mark. \r\n\r\nI've also noticed that as OS:s are concerned, fonts
    are perpetual. And for the end user they should be. \r\n\r\nBut MS still consideres
    a font family as Plain, Italic, Bold and Bold Italic. And that is something I
    dislike. Just because it was written in MS-DOS, it does not mean it was written
    in stone. Or was that written in Windows?\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'll wait for FontLab
    response just in case, but I've already copied your method."

  body: Windows 7 sorts large font families into tidy folders. Not just rg/it/bd/bdit.
    Older/simpler apps still only support only 4 styles. If software developers choose
    to support larger families they can.

    But it\u2019s probably irrelevant as Windows 7 is likely to be deprecated before
    Fontlab actually releases some updated software."

  body: Clearing the Adobe cache in Windows is a headache. Even if I find the cache
    files, it doesn't always work. In Windows Vista and 7, there's a system cache
    that needs to be cleared but it's always in the same place. If the naming problem
    still appears I'm still not sure if I failed to fix the problem or if the cache
    wasn't really cleared. Now I do my initial big family installation tests on a
    netbook so I can fix the problem and do the second test on my main computer.
