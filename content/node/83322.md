body: "Hi I'm looking for expert advice on fonts to use in magazine design.\r\n\r\nHere
  are details:\r\n\r\nTarget market: Medical marijuana patients and related businesses\r\n\r\nReadership:\r\n\r\nAge
  Range:\r\n18-19 8%\r\n20-29 38%\r\n30-39 20%\r\n40-49 9%\r\n50-59 24%\r\n60+ 4%\r\n\r\n60%
  Male\r\n40% Female\r\n\r\nHousehold income: $85,000\r\n\r\nPublication in Phoenix\r\n\r\nWe
  are going for a minimalist / organic design and would like it to have a modern edge.\r\n\r\nSome
  fonts we like so far for headings are:\r\n\r\nGotham Condensed, Antenna Condensed,
  Sentinel Bold, Tungsten Bold (just not too sure these are too bold and masculine)\r\n\r\nWe're
  looking for a set of fonts that will work very well aesthetically together. For
  the body type we want a font that is easily readable.\r\n\r\nPlease post your suggestions
  and I appreciate your expert advice.\r\n\r\nSincerely- Chris\r\n"

    my <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/78053\">Fontesque</a>, which now has lovely
    display cuts, all of which include this icon:[img:sites/default/files/old-images/doobie_5255.png]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The Sacramento News and Review (SN&R), a free alternative weekly, has in
    the latest edition a 28 page (!) pullout section full of color ads by medical
    marijuana retailers. This is serious stuff and there is money to be made for those
    in the print business supplying support.\r\n\r\nRelevant Logo, a nice, clean,
    and up-to-date looking font for text might be FF Tisa. http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=ff+tisa
    Just be sure to not get a too traditional looking font. Good luck.\r\n\r\nAnd
    speaking generally, \"organic\" is becoming more used and harder to define all
    the time."

  body: "Thanks everyone for your support, I apologize for the delay it seems typophile
    was down for a few days so I'm just now following up:\r\n\r\nFrank: thanks for
    the suggestions not sure if those fonts will work for the look we are going after
    though.\r\n\r\nJohn: thanks for your suggestions, I really like sensibility it
    does offer a modern design blend with the \"organic\" feel we're going after.\r\n\r\nHrant:
    thanks for the suggestion on Rosetta, I wasn't even aware of their foundry until
    you recommended it. I do really like their Skolar type but not quite sure if this
    is the look we're going for. I can see this working very well if we wanted to
    produce our publication in multiple languages.\r\n\r\nNick: Great job on Fontesque,
    that is an amazing font. I could see us using that in some featured articles for
    edible recipes, and such.\r\n\r\nJ. Tillman: Thanks yes that is great SN&R did
    that section I'd like to see that! On FF Tisa, that is great you recommended that
    that is one of the few we are highly considering.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is the list
    of the top fonts we are considering now:\r\n\r\nIdeal Sans:  http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100042&path=head\r\n\r\nMercury
    Text G2:  http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100017&path=head\r\n\r\nAmplitude:
    \ http://www.fontbureau.com/magazine/fonts/sans/listing/Amplitude/\r\n\r\nAntenna:
    \ http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Antenna/  (We really like this one for headlines
    but now we're looking for a compatible serif font for body copy)\r\n\r\nFF Tisa:
    \ http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=ff+tisa\r\n\r\nAkagi:  http://www.typetrust.com/fonts/font.php?id=Nzkw\r\n\r\nStag:
    \ http://commercialtype.com/\r\n\r\nParisine Plus:  http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typofonderie/parisine-plus-std/regular/\r\n\r\n\r\nI
    hope this helps to understand direction we are in. A lot of these are great fonts
    but selecting which ones work best together is the challenge. We'd like a modern
    sans-serif font and the body copy type to be serif.\r\n\r\nFrom the magazines
    we've found that share the design goals we have are:\r\n\r\n.net magazine\r\nReal
    Simple\r\nFood network\r\nWallpaper\r\nwhole living\r\nLiving etc\r\nRolling Stone\r\nO
    magazine\r\nQ magazine\r\nvegetarian living\r\n\r\nThanks again for your expert
    advice, I really, really appreciate it very much.\r\n"
