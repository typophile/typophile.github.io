<p>One can’t protect against it. It’s far too common—IIRC an study put it at 50% of American designers used pirate fonts at least sometimes—to prevent. Once a few people have bought a font it inevitably ends up getting posted online by an end-user. Watermarks can be embedded in fonts, but unless a designer has the time and money to sue the original purchaser for letting the font get out, there’s no point. And if watermarks were used by more than the one foundry that currently does, someone would just write a tool to strip them from fonts.</p>
<p><cite>Am I missing something or is it really just a lot of faith in the end user?</cite></p>
<p>Something like that. I see it as a willingness to just focus on the paying customers and not get hung up on the pirates.</p>

<p>there have been numerous threads regarding this issue, with a few staunch enforcers, a few &ldquo;don&rsquo;t bother&rdquo; liberals, and a vast majority of legitimate end users who can only moan about the inconvenience and downright disfunction of the more aggressive protection tactics hopelessly employed.</p>
<p>i think the most useful discussions resolved in general agreement that the best antidote to abuse is education. people (users, students, layout artists) need to better understand the real work that goes into font craft and respect it as such.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I think this goes too far. The landmark cases establishing that font piracy is against the law were important. And the occassional prosecution, such as the one not too long ago in England, are also helpful.</p>
<p>From other threads it seems that the larger foundries will go after companies, especially large companies that violate copyright. But they don&rsquo;t bother with hobbiests or small business, and there is little that a single designer, without big bucks for lawyers, can to.</p>
<p>It does seem that a reminder to a company that font piracy is against the law will very often get them to comply, as they are afraid of lawsuits.</p>
<p>So I think although there is a lot of piracy, it is a not a hopeless situation.</p>

<p>The phobia of font makers is of pathological nature and strictly for psychiatrists. Look at me: I wrote a dozen books, most of them running into several printed editions. But I never bothered to protect my books against piracy. A decade ago, there was a crazy guy who deviced the WORN disk (WORN = &ldquo;write once, read never&rdquo;). On this special CD disk, authors could store theirs books, but nobody including the authors, could ever retrieve what was stored on this WORN disk. People who invent such devices are crazy in the head. An no sane human being would ever use such crazy devices that &ldquo;can place code within the picture&rdquo;, and similar lunatic stuff.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>As a little note on how cruel the reality can be, my [[http://autodidakt.se/index.php?page=exemplar|Exemplar Pro]] got &ldquo;ripped&rdquo; from a PDF, only a couple of days after it had been released. Since my PDF was downloaded hundreds of times during the first days, I guess someone saw the opportunity and grabbed it.</p>
<p>After that I made outlines of the font in the complete character set showings, to prevent more piracy. It doesnt look as good on screen that way, but it is a good compromise to outline the complete sets. I should have done it from the start only. The rest was only subsets of the font.</p>
<p>It was a forum on the internet, someone asked for the font and someone ripped it, simple as that! I made an account on this perticular forum and found out that this person had &ldquo;ripped&rdquo; and/or shared almost all of the new fonts that was recently released by the major foundries.</p>
<p>I downloaded my own font – now as a PDF-extract since I wanted to see how it worked. Something that is both good and bad with PDF extracting of fonts &ldquo;pirate-style&rdquo; is that the kerning cant be extracted, so my font was autokerned (without classes and looked terrible) and the hinting was very bad on the &ldquo;ripped&rdquo; fonts. Also the OT-features were not complete as it was recovered in some way. It&rsquo;s easy to spot the copy, in other words.</p>
<p>Something that however made me a little less sad, was that the person at least left my copyright string in the font.</p>
<p>Even though this felt terrible in many ways, I have the same passion for type, so it will definately not stop me from doing more typefaces. Good people pay for fonts, and it is for them I design :)</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s true. I think the bigger thing is to remember that trying to fight piracy via DRM is often hurtful.</p>
<p>As Goran points out, ANY digital media, in short time, will be floating around out in the wild. Accept that, and then focus back on the other non-technical, but more pragmatic solutions: education, law, customer focus, etc.</p>

<p>Sure. Certainly. That does happen. But when a fontmaker gets a commission job, makes the specified font(s) and gets paid, a substantial sum of money is acquired and retained by the fontmaker. Unlike retail fonts, piracy of proprietary fonts doesn&rsquo;t affect or reduce the revenue earned by designers/makers of those fonts.</p>
<p>The UK videogames industry loves me and have given me four separate comission jobs. They paid me a tidy sum of money each and every time, and if any of their employees upload any of the proprietary fonts I made for them—that&rsquo;s their problem, not mine. The tidy sum of money they paid me to make those proprietary fonts remains my property and is unaffected by any piracy those fonts may be subjected to.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d say that likely &lsquo;more&rsquo; true, but not an absolute. There really hasn&rsquo;t been any sort of tangible proof that digital media piracy has directly resulted in lost revenue. There&rsquo;s some tangential statistics for both sides of the argument.</p>

Ignoring is not condoning, and some prosecution of miscreants may be necessary, but the constant publicizing of the &ldquo;piracy issue&rdquo; on Typophile only serves to inform would-be villains of opportunities, and reassure them that they stand little chance of getting nailed for their transgressions.
And who gets the bad rap in these threads? Not the evil-doers, but the foundries, who are castigated for their attempts at self defence as not being more &ldquo;customer-friendly&rdquo;! 
This is why you don&rsquo;t get foundry folk entering these discussions much.</div>

<p>But I&rsquo;m still thinking about how to encourage user to pay for the work.  The situation that work right now is to make a license easier. Discount for many license + company license or site license in a very attractive price. Then it&rsquo;ll be a customize version in a reasonable price for customer too.</p>
<p>At least not going to the most end of black and white.</p>

<em>I think this goes too far. The landmark cases establishing that font piracy is against the law were important. And the occassional prosecution, such as the one not too long ago in England, are also helpful.</em></p>
<p>Does this mean they finally caught the Vampire? (I thought she was working out of Scotland or Ireland.)</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t heard of this case, and I feel I&rsquo;ve been out of it - would love to know where I can read up on what happened.</p>
<hr>
<p>Meanwhile, piracy has become an annoyance and a fact of life. Since each country has it&rsquo;s own set of laws to follow. I&rsquo;ve seen torrents in Sweden waving their noses at us&hellip;giveaway font sites from India that preach they do not recognize copyright laws of other nations, Russian sites (need I say more about those guys) and my favorite was an American college student, in California, who put up a giveaway site - and had to take it down several months later (yes, after the damage).</p>
<p>Some companies do go after pirates. They do hire people to help stop it. They do hire lawyers to write letters. They do hire hackers to break all connections. Yet, there are too many uneducated people out there, giving away - not just fonts - but all software they can get their grubby little hands on.</p>
<p>Will it end? I hate to sound like a pessimist but if you can get rid of one site - the new one pops up 5 seconds later - it was just waiting in the wings&hellip;..</p>

The larger web sites are worth going after, as it lets other offenders know you are vigilant. I found one web site that showed how many fonts had been downloaded. I calculated it, and it came to over $750,000.00 that I lost in potential sales. I contacted them and offered to settle for 10% if they chose not to remove my work. They removed it within a couple of hours.</p>
<p>I have embedded code in each font I have sold and so I know who the original purchaser is if it gets shared or posted on a piracy web site. I have caught several people in the act, and confronted them&hellip; this too helps to at least let people know you are serious about protecting your work.</p>

<p>Six years ago, in 2004, I disclosed that Linotype started this embedding of purchaser data (first and last name, company name, street, zip code, city, country, email address, telefon, bank account, customer number, credit card number, pin code, password, etc. etc. etc.)</p>
<p>see <a href="http://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/lino17.pdf">http://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/lino17.pdf</a>, page 1</p>
<p>see <a href="http://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/forgers.pdf">http://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/forgers.pdf</a>, page 9</p>
<p>Other font forging outfits adopted this illegal practice of embedding private purchaser data, much to the pleasure of professional phishing criminals, who can easily get access to these private data by hacking and analysing the embedded code of purchased fonts.</p>
<p>Purchasing fonts via online stores is highly dangerous for your privacy, because any phishing hacker can read your private data by analysing the fonts you bought via online fontshops.</p>

<p>If you want to avoid phishing via Linotype fonts, do the following:</p>

<li>
<p>Best advice: Do not buy Linotype fonts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second-best advice: Do the following:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>a) Import the Linotype OTF font into Fontlab with</p>
<ul>
<li>Import Hinting option switched off and</li>
<li>Import OTF tables option switched off.</li>
</ul>
<p>b) Generate a plain PS Type 1 font in .PFA format.</p>
<p>c) Remove %% lines from .PFA file with a text editor.</p>
<p>d) Import the .PFA font into Fontlab and rehint it.</p>
<p>e) Resave it as .PFB file or as .OTF or as .TTF file.</p>
<p>Such a cleaned Linotype font will not contain your private data.</p>

<p>I don’t. I think, that there are dozens of small and a few big foundries, that are much more innovative, technically and with regard to creativity. I will not spend much money for fonts, that were good, before they were badly digitized. Well, Ginkgo is interesting for me.</p>

<p>Incidentally, this type of practice, were it perceived as common, could give a valid reason for a major TV network like NBC licensing exactly one copy of a font, putting it on a computer in a locked room, and using that computer day and night for the purpose of applying that font to its promotional materials&hellip; instead of buying lots of copies and putting them on lots of computers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><cite>But having my personal information embedded into a font is another issue</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>German laws do not allow sellers to secretly affix private data (name, address, email, bank etc.) to the commodity you purchase. It is likely that the same holds true for the USA. Here an example:</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s assume, you marry, and your betrothed buys wedding rings at a jeweller&rsquo;s shop. In the wedding night, you happen to look inside the ring and discover that the first and last name of your betrothed, his postal address and his email, his bank address and his credit card number and other private data had been engraved in small print in Neue Helvetica Ultra Light Condensed into the inside of the wedding ring by the jeweller, secretly without your prior written permission, would you think that this is illegal in the United States? If this is so, then the Linotype practice of clandestine embedding your private data into each Linotype font purchased at the Linotype Website is illegal too.</p>
<p>Would the legal situation in the United States be different, if you visited <a href="http://www.linotype.com">www.linotype.com</a>, and if Linotype, prior to your purchase, disclosed to you that it embeds all your private data (name, address, email, telephone, bank, etc.) into each font you purchase, and if Linotype requested you to click on an &ldquo;Accept&rdquo; button stating that by purchasing Linotype fonts you accept to forgo all your privacy rights?</p>
<p>Incidentally, I have a new website <a href="http://www.chillingeffects.de">www.chillingeffects.de</a> dealing with bizarre legal chilling effects, but this site is in German language only.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Wow, I wouldn&rsquo;t even consider placing private information about the purchaser in the font they buy from me. The information that I place in the font is general. It&rsquo;s a serial number (which only I can track) along with the date/time of the purchase. I starting doing this back in 2004 when I first starting selling my fonts to the general public. The very first font I sold for public use&hellip; it immediately got shared with 10&rsquo;s of thousands of people in a font sharing group. This was after the person making the purchase assured me in a letter that she would not do such an unethical thing.</p>
<p>In answer to Cristobal&rsquo;s question: : How difficult is to put such a code into a font? Is it possible to open it in Fontlab, rename the font and delete the code?</p>
<p>The practice of embedding the serial numbers in purchases will likely come to an end for me because it&rsquo;s a tedious task. My system isn&rsquo;t automated at all. So I manually go into a specific character of the font they are buying and import the serial number from an Illustrator file. It&rsquo;s time consuming. Since I don&rsquo;t sell that many fonts from my own website, I&rsquo;ve been able to keep up with it.</p>
<p>However, I just recently purchased FontLab (I&rsquo;ve been using Fontographer for many years) and plan to convert most of my fonts to OTF forrmat. Once I make those formats available, I will likely end the practice of embedding serial numbers. Perhaps I&rsquo;ll find another way that will help me track who the people are that are sharing my work illegally.  (I&rsquo;m open to suggestions).</p>

<p><cite>-Name the font after and allready wide-spread (free) software product (example: Haptic Pro).
-Check on google for your font on rapidshare, megashare, torrent, etc&hellip; and command the website-owner to delete your products.</p>
<ul>
<li>Release a free demo-version of your font (perhaps one weight), so when searched for your font people usually come out to this one.</li>
<li>Create your own rapidshare-, megashare- and torrentfiles with just junk in them. If these are widespread people get tired of downloading them illegally.</cite></li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard from the music industry that the people who download music illigally are also the people who buy the most music eventually. Maybe this als counts for fonts, because I think designers first want to see what they get.</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> to offer one weight/style for free, as Ex Ljbris does. It must be an useful one, so avoid extreme weights.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> to make available various password-protected PDF samples and also interesting images on galleries (in distributors sites or services like Flickr).</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> to upload incomplete/extract-like fonts to servers like RapidShare. The same what music industry is doing, uploading themselves low-quality or damaged MP3.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> to notify these servers everytime a genuine font is found for download – yours or from other designers.</p>

<p>At Sebastian Lester&rsquo;s site, he counsels us to buy his fonts at Monotype.co.uk. It seems that Monotype.co.uk is very trustful. Monotype is very cheap than Linotype and Fonts.com. I think in buying 4 or 12 fonts Neo Sans at Monotype.co.uk.</p>

That said, I don&rsquo;t think releasing a &lsquo;simplified&rsquo; version of your font (especially for decoratives) will have negative effect on them.</p>
<p>Please tell me if I&rsquo;m wrong.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">A while back I saw a site that was giving my work away and noticed they went so far as to have a Facebook page. So I tried to contact the &ldquo;legal&rdquo; rep from that site which was, as you might expect, a bogus link. Rather than waste my time trying that end I reported them to Facebook along with links to my attempts to contact them. To my pleasant surprise FB removed the group promptly and also removed all the links to my original FB post about it. A minor victory, but at least a drop in the bucket.</div>

<p>This is really a bad idea. For a while people were using automated tools to rip complete foundry libraries from Flash type testers and then automatically generating kerning and other features. I’ve had conversations with people who think H&amp;FJ are incompetent because they tried using these hackneyed pirate fonts and assumed that the problem is the designer!</p>
