  free font (http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/linden-hill) based on Frederic Goudys
  Deepdene.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering if anyone can help me to find where Linden Hill can
  be used for. (a poam, some kind of book, ...)\r\nI'm also searching for a picture
  or something else of the original Deepdene.\r\n\r\nThank you for helping me!\r\n\r\n(graphic

    from <em>Goudy\u2019s Type Designs</em>, a specimen book written by the man himself.\r\n\r\nDeepdene
    was not one of his more popular faces, and I don\u2019t recall ever coming across
    it used commercially (and I\u2019ve spent a lot of time looking at magazines from
    the \u201920s and \u201930s).\r\n\r\nThere are several digital interpretations
    of the face\u2014a comparison of their relative merits would also be a good academic
    project.\r\n\r\nAs for the font in use, why not have a go at doing some typography
    in the style of the historicist era in which Goudy\u2019s types were front and
    centre? \u2014 making use of small caps, italics, old style \uFB01gures, all the
    good stuff! \r\n\r\nhttp://pinterest.com/pin/49539664621187883/\r\nhttp://pinterest.com/pin/49539664621163576/"

  body: "I have encountered Deepdene only a few times in the wild. And mostly in display.\r\n\r\nI
    have two examples among my own book collection. Deepdene was used for the title
    page of <cite>The Beach of Fales\xE1</cite>, by Dylan Thomas [New York: Stein
    and Day, 1959]. Deepdene Roman and Italic were used for section and chapter titles
    in <cite>Great American Nature Writing</cite>, edited by Joseph Wood Krutch [New
    York: William Sloane Associates, 1950].\r\n\r\n(Interestingly, it was paired with
    Electra for text in both cases. Go figure.)\r\n\r\nBut, of course, these were
    not Linden Hill."

    New York, 1958. The \uFB01t of Deepdene is classic Goudy\u2014very tight. I wonder
    how the digital versions compare in that respect.\r\nThe body face is Fair\uFB01eld.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Chess_6639.jpg]"

    of kernability with cast metal letters. In the instance shown just above, I am
    quite taken with the subtle overshoots on the bottoms of the /c/ and /e/, along
    with the dip-below diagonal serif on the bottom of the /d/."

  body: "@picArt\r\n\r\nAt Kernest Konstellations, we're using Linden Hill in combination
    with some other fonts, in setting an excerpt from <em>Walden, and On the Duty
    of Civil Disobedience</em> by Henry David Thoreau.  Titled <em>Spring</em>. \r\nLinden
    Hill is being used sparingly to provide contrast to text that's extraneous in
    some way from the main text - such as the title of the volume from which the excerpt
    comes: <em>Walden, and On the Duty of Civil Disobedience</em>, for example. \r\n\r\nDrop
    me note about it on my blog in the comments section. (See below.) From it, I can
    get your email, and I'll pop over a link to the piece when it publishes in a few
    days.  It's appearing as a part of the May issue of Konstellations. (The entire
    package - web fonts, html, and css, all downloadable.)\r\n\r\nOr better yet, subscribe!\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nRich\r\n\r\n<a
