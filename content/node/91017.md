  my granddaddy used to say. \r\n\r\nH's-1.png, is a single font with a single set
  of instructions being rasterized 3 different ways, aliased, greyscale and Cleartype
  (CT), in VTT. \r\n\r\nH's-2.png, the same, but I commented out the IUP instruction
  that smooths out the untouched points. \r\n\r\nH's-3.png the left is CT with the
  x hints turned on, while the right is CT again, but has the x hints commented out
  entirely. \r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s the difference you might ask, between CT with and
  without x instructions. . . "

    same? It could be the difference is too small to see.\r\n\r\n(Then again, the
    difference is not so small if you expected one of the two to look like one of
    the Pure Grayscale versions.)"

  body: "I\u2019m not familiar with VTT, but if you hint the x-direction in Fontlab
    (perhaps since it only operates with full pixels) you\u2019re putting serious
    constraints on the Cleartype rendering, not to mention adding a lot of weight
    to the file size. Cleartype can use the subpixels, but won\u2019t if you lock
    the stem edge to pixel edge and hint its width to a rounded # of pixels. In effect:
    huge uncomfortable jumps from one to two to three pixel stems, whereas with only
    y-direction hinting the weight gain is more fluid. "
