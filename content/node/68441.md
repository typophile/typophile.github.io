    He said Wired spends months, sometimes years, working on custom fonts to make
    reading of their content easier. thier [sic] custom typeface has 10,000 kerning
    pairs vs. 500 for a regular font.</cite>\r\n\r\nIs that because it\u2019s not
    using kerning classes or because the spacing and kerning were pulled from /dev/random?
    Or have H&FJ figured out some way to use kerning to optimize spacing for screen
    type?"

    idea that spelling, grammar and style don't matter anymore annoys me to no end."
