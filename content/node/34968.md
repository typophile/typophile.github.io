  version?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture-2_6289.jpg]"

    for it at <a href=\"http://www.paratype.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Paratype</a>
    and viewing their New Zelek. There's also a version called Slant floating around
    the Web.\r\n\r\nI'm afraid that I've no idea what your desired typeface is."

    slightly different.\r\n\r\nYou can see some sample here: http://www.twardoch.com/download/poltype/\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,
    i can't find any digital version."
