  body: 'Too small for my eyes... What''s the sample origin? It could be easier with
    bigger/better samples... Key glyphs are /a (bowl and spur) and /s (top finial).
    Anyway, here''s what I have: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/akzidenz-grotesk-pro/cond-light/|Akzidenz
    Grotesk Condensed Light]] (possibly matching, the closest I have at least) and
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/suomi/titillation/|Titillation]] (rounded and /s
    looks off)'

  body: Looks like Akzidenz Grotesque Condensed to me too. That's the size of the
    sample from the online site (it's an ad). Great job, thanks!
