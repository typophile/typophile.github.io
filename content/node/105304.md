  body: One way would be to put the type on one layer, create another layer with white
    and clear stripes above the type layer, merge the two layer, then judiciously
    apply Gaussian blur.

  body: "Here's three more ways...\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.graphicdeclaration.com/images/LOVE_stripeblurr.jpg\">\r\n\r\nCommon
    to all is to begin the process by creating a stripe pattern, and select that pattern
    contract the selection save to a new layer that selection. Reselect the wider
    stripe pattern and contract the selction then feather the selection and copy that
    to a new layer. By now you should have three stripe layers ...one master stripe
    pattern, one wide feathered stripe pattern, and one narrow stripe pattern. In
    your layer stack hide the master layer, show the wide feathered stripe pattern
    and place the narrow strip pattern layer directly above the wide feathered layer.\r\n\r\nFrom
    there the fun begins...\r\n\r\nTop example is simply a type layer placed in between
    the wide feathered stripe layer and the narrow stripe layer. Set the Blending
    mode to Overlay. The type is then rasterized and blurred.\r\n\r\nMiddle example
    is a little more intricate and perhaps the most accurate and flexible (which imho
    makes it the best type effect technique). Place the type layer under the wide
    feathered stripe layer. Then use the Oval Tool to draw out an oval and use that
    oval on each and every section of each letter shape which you want to create the
    effect. Do this by scaling the oval and then go > Make Selection from the vector
    oval. Feather the selection at will and then delete the selected parts of the
    wide feathered stripes to create the effect.\r\n\r\nBottom example is something
    like the middle example except not nearly as flexible nor coolio ...but it is
    quicker/easier. Place the type layer under the wide feathered stripe layer. Duplicate
    the wide feathered stripe layer and merge that dupe layer with the type layer.
    Select all the section of the type in between the stripes and expand the selection,
    smooth the selection, feather the selection and then delete those sections. For
    this technique to work there must be another type layer of the same color placed
    just above the background layer.\r\n\r\nAny questions just fire away.\r\n\r\nHope
    that helps.\r\n\r\nHaving said all that I'm sure there must a plugin for this
    style of fx."
