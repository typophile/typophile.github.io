body: If somebody wanted to convert the forms in an 80s video game pixel font to a
  modern smooth-contour &#40;that is, no pixel blocks, just smooth lines&#41; face,
  what kinds of techniques would you emply to translate the blocks to smooth lines?  I&#39;m
  talking philosphically, not technically. <BR> <BR>Understand that the s, for example,
  in this face would look differently if interpreted by multiple designers--even though
  it&#39;s based on the same pixel-s.
