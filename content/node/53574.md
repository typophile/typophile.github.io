  books and  a poster on the Tamazight script.  When I get home and get a scanner,
  for those who are interested I'll post some samples.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm somewhat interested
  in is finding some handwriting samples or books written for adults or some more
  interesting samples that don't all look like Helvetica for Berbers.  Of all the
  books I have, I've only got about three separate fonts between the four books I
  bought.  So if anyone has any ideas, I'm really interested.\r\n"
