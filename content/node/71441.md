    Medium</a>, with a few customized letters. This film type came in 5 weights, but
    the letterforms are about the same across the weight range. I am not sure whether
    there is a digital version of this typeface.\r\n\r\n(Image in the Bauhaus-style
    Font ID Guide is a scan from the Phil's Photo book \"A Homage to the Alphabet\"
