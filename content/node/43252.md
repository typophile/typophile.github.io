    a MM font, so probably not a specific off-the-shelf weight) with an enlarged \u2018i\u2019
    dot.\r\n\r\nF"

    looks like customized Myriad (?)."

    Sans only last week \u2026\r\nThey have quite a related feel, especially the italics
    \u2013 I like them both. Myriad is just a little bit omnipresent, by nature."

  body: Nice work guys. I'm always curious when someone asks for multiple ids (either
    in one post or in several consecutive posts) why the need for so many ids. Don't
    mean to pry, just curious is all I am.

  body: "Andrew,\r\n\r\nThe reason is quiet simple. During the days when I see some
    logo, lettering, video, add whatever with some nice letering I collect them. Then,
    when I develop a new logo or something visual material I reasearch several possibilities
    and sometimes choose some types already used in those places that I collect. When
    I know them (like I did  with some others today) I try them. But sometimes I'm
    stuck and (even trying to figure out) I can't. So I ask help from the community
    to help ID. If I just need one I place one...but if I have more then one I will
    post them...\r\nThanks all for the help!\r\n\r\nAnt\xF3nio"
