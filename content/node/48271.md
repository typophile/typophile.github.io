body: "According to Antonio Cavedoni, Giovanni Mardersteig's Zeno has two shapes for
  c, m and r, long and short. Right now I plan to find images of this in \"THE OFFICINA
  BODONI, AN ACCOUNT OF THE WORK OF A HAND PRESS, 1923-1977\" which is in at least
  2 libraries I will be visiting. But does anybody already have images of these? I
  only ask because I am excited to see them in context. A bit childish of me...\r\n\r\nRelated

  body: "In one of the nodes you mention, 12226, Hrant posted two scans that have
    alternate letters for c, m, r and more.\r\nIsn't that what you're looking for?\r\nI
    have a small Dutch/Belgian Officina Bodoni catalogue that has a 16pt Zeno specimen
    text. Both versions of the r are used, not sure about the c and m. In the latter,
    the difference is pretty subtle. \r\n\r\nJM"

  body: See page 103 of Lawson's _Anatomy of a typeface_; but I don't notice any variant
    letters. If I recall correctly, the Zeno type was very seldom used, so you may
    find it difficult to locate examples.

  body: "I was doing a Worldcat search for \"The four Gospels\" shown in the Lawson
    but no Libraries seem to have it. It may be that a Librarian can find it better
    than I can. The Worldcat interface I have is a bit buggy.\r\n\r\nThis image does
    have alts in it.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Zeno1.jpg\r\n\r\nIn
    the sample I see one kind of f, one kind of c, two kinds of e, one kind of g.
    So it's mixed.\r\n\r\nI think that the g must be there for the same reason the
    p with the short descender is - to make thighter interline space possible or to
    solve for a interline near miss with a g above & an f below. \r\n\r\nMaybe if
    I contact the exiting firm I will be able to get the best answers about the intent
    behind these.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.stamperiavaldonega.it/public/index.cfm?id=344&changeLang=2\r\n\r\nAntonio
    says he has some samples in use as well.\r\n\r\nHopefully this material will make
    it into my Atypi talk as well.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Eben, I sent you by email a picture taken from my <cite>Scritti di Giovanni
    Mardersteig sulla storia dei caratteri e della tipografia</cite> that shows Zeno.
    It\u2019s not a text setting, but a specimen of the typeface. I see that Hrant\u2019s
    image linked above does have many more glyphs in it, some look like alternates
    to improve fitting (wide and narrow versions of the same glyphs), but some other
    are just stylistic alternates, like the p with the protruding spur from the lower
    connection of the bowl stroke to the stem."

  body: I think I agree with your analysis of the forms. It is a little hard to be
    sure until you see them at work in a setting. But still I think you are probably
    right. In the case of the spur p, I wonder if the spur might have some use at
    the start of a word eg "plow" vs "loped".

  body: Antonio wrote me today to say that he spoke with the folks in question & they
    said that yes some of their special sorts were indeed there for fit. Not all -
    but some. They didn't mix them in at random either but instead kept them apart
    and used them deliberately in their hand composition. Viva Antonio! ( Antonio=Verbosus)

    that he made with his spiro curves?\r\nMaybe very interesting for you!\r\n\r\nHe
    participated on some threads in the past but I don\u2019t know if he is still
    active in typophile.\r\n\r\nStefan\r\n\r\nIf you need something from Mardersteig,
    let me know.\r\nMaybe I can help."

    also for the offer of help with Mardersteig stuff! I will surly take you up on
    your kind offer one day soon.\r\n\r\nJust at the moment because I am at the MATD
    program at Reading and tracking a specific line of research I am looking at French/Dutch
    16th Century type. \r\n\r\nI will contact you off line to ask you about that."
