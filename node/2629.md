body: I am going to make a book for a danish painter, while talking over the book,
  he told me to find a book called somthing which sounded like &#34;Trispan Chantry&#34;
  he said it was from the 18th century - and that he was unable to spell it ... other
  facts .. the bookmaker supposedly made use of the marbelized prints normally used
  for the inside of the binding, in the actual book itself .... all very vague i know
  - but does it ring anyones bell ?
