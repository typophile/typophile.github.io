  difficulties in finding another good font with a x height that match Reina's and
  looks good with it. \r\nIt will be good also if the font to pair with Reina had
  several weights. \r\n\r\nthanks very much! :)))) \r\n\r\n(sorry for the bad English)

    personality. I wanted something more neutral but not boring. \r\nI really liked
    this invitation http://www.papercrave.com/images/blog-images/jp-kiera-invitation-inspiration.jpg
    \r\nand wanted to make something like that...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
