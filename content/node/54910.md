  the one site I managed not to tag on delicious.\r\n\r\nI stumbled across a dingbat
  font fairly recently which just seemed to contain loads of these rather elegant
  and ornate frames. (see example attachment)\r\n\r\nI was just hoping one of you
  may have stumbled across the same font, or could recommend some alternatives.\r\n\r\nMany
  Thanks,\r\n\r\nDavid"

  body: "Heya,\r\n\r\nNot specifically those frames in the example, but ones very
    similar. I just can't remember the foundry site I was on, I've checked all the
    ones I usually frequent.\r\n\r\nThanks for the recommendations, but the ornaments
    tended to be a whole ornate little frame in one glyph, as opposed to individual
    borders you could build up.\r\n\r\nI'll keep looking, thanks in the meantime!"
