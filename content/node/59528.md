body: Sometimes when I alter the sidebearings of a letter by typing a new sidebearing
  value directly into the metrics table or by changing it with the keyboard Fontlab
  will also change the sidebearings of adjacent letters in the preview area of the
  metrics window. Is this a feature that I am using incorrectly or a bug?

  body: Check the numerical values of the preview characters you think are changing.
    They should move some in the preview because you've caused them to scootch over
    from the new sidebearing.

  body: You mean, it <em>looks</em> as if the sidebearing of characters to the right
    of the one you just changed, changes? If so that would be logical.

    are only for accented versions of the letters, and that\u2019s not what\u2019s
    being changed.\r\n\r\n\r\n<cite>You mean, it looks as if the sidebearing of characters

    if I have the text \u201CVMVMVMV\u201D onscreen and I change the left sidebearing
    of M from 95 to 85 the left sidebearing of V also changes to 85."
