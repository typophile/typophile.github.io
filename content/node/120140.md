body: "Playing around with Dialog Kit I've made a script to fill the most important
  fields in a font family at once in Fontlab. The program follows Karsten L\xFCcke's
  recommendations about Font Metrics and Font Naming in his well known PDFs. \r\nI'm
  sure several of you will point better methods or syntax :) so thanks a lot in advance.
  I will try to improve the interface and the script in the future, but for the moment,
  this is all I can do. Thanks to Tal Leming and Paul van der Laan for the help. \r\n\r\n<img

  \r\n1- Open your fonts\r\n2- Set the \"Weight\" in each font info and click the
  \"Italic\" checkbox (if the font is italic). If you want to use different font weight
  names to the ones available in the Fontlab menu, the script must be edited. The
  script will uncheck the boxes later (it does not make linking families)\r\n3- Run
  the script, complete the required information and press \"OK\".\r\n4- Go and check
  the font info in each font to see the changes.\r\nWarning: Robofab and Dialog Kit
  must be installed.\r\n\r\nDownload: http://www.re-type.com/images/ReType_BatchFontInfo-1.0.py.zip\r\n\r\n"

  body: Is there any benefit to this besides ease of use? The FontLab system works
    fine for me. Do you feel it's lacking something you have added, or is it just
    a matter of putting all the menus into one accessible dialog?
