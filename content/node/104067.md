body: "Do typographers and type designers have an unfair advantage when reading eye
  charts? While sitting at my optometrist\u2019s office last week, I wondered if my
  years spent researching and using letterforms gave me some sort of visual acuity
  performance edge.\r\n\r\nOptometrist: Can you read Line Three, please?\r\n\r\n<em>Long
  pause. </em>\r\n\r\nMe: (Sigh) Well, I know the second letter is a P. But I\u2019m
  not sure if I\u2019m actually <em>reading</em> the P or if it\u2019s just because
  I know it\u2019s a P by the heavier typographic color of the bowl in the top right
  area of the letter.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nOptometrist: Would you say the line is clearer
  in view 1 or view 2?\r\n\r\nMe: I mean...  I can\u2019t say that the line is actually
  <em>clearer</em> but I guess the letterforms in #2 are slightly less sparkly than
  in #1.\r\n\r\n<em>Long pause.</em>\r\n\r\nOptometrist: You know, it\u2019s very
  difficult to get an accurate eye reading on you.\r\n\r\nMaybe I'm just more annoying.\r\n\r\nModern
  visual acuity tests are based on the [[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/26/magazine/who-made-that-eye-chart.html|1862
  Snellen Chart]] by Dutch ophthamologist Herman Snellen. Instead of using existing
  typefaces, Snellen created optotypes, standard symbols which include letterforms,
  numbers and symbols designed on a 5x5 grid specifically for measuring vision clarity.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Snellen_chart_6170.svg.png]

  laboring over the LogMAR chart (Logarithm of the Minimum Angle of Resolution), which,
  unlike the Snellen model, consists of five characters per line and standardizes
  the size progression and spacing of each optotype from one line to the next. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LogMAR_chart_3953.jpg]

  Commons</a></cite>\r\n\r\nLogMAR charts use Sloan optotypes, designed in 1959 by
  Louise Sloan, now the standard for vision acuity tests in the United States. In
  contrast to the drastic slabs in the Snellen chart, Sloan optotypes are blocky but
  endearing sans with awkward terminals, designed, I\u2019m presuming, to stump you
  on those pesky lower lines. And in case you possess a burning desire to acquire
  the Sloan font for your own non-commercial use, fear not: Dr. Denis Pelli of NYU
  has created [[http://psych.nyu.edu/pelli/software.html|a digital version of the
  Sloan typeface]], adding many characters not previously included in the original
  drawings. \r\n\r\nAny other type-folk have a similar experience at the eye doctor?
  Can you remove your \u201Ctypographic lenses\u201D (pun intended!) while reading
  an eye chart? Does your eye doctor find you as irritating as mine? \r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n<em>Hi,

  nerdery in daily life and healthy doses of typo-procrastination. Vive Typophile!</em>"

  body: Hahaha! I had this *exact* same conversation with my eye doctor. I really
    think it has messed with getting the correct prescription.
