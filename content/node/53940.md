  and letter/number combos as being natural: "They''re part of the flow, not an interruption
  of it." But when typesetting the pages, John doesn''t use small caps, so the acronyms
  stand out and visually interrupt the flow of text. So I wonder if someone could
  clarify.  '

    with it. Ironically, in the CA article itself, they did use small caps in typesetting
    my examples. (As I would have myself, in any other context but this.)\r\n"

  body: "I do think the regular capitals stand out, but in your defense I do appreciate
    the difficulty of setting a text that includes words like TiVo and MySpace, and
    being prose, perhaps there is more wiggle room, except that you say you still
    used small caps on the TOC - is it because you wanted it to have more formality?\r\nAnd
    back to regular caps standing out, you might even say they are supposed to be
    that way - they are often brand names and results of marketers who fully intend
    for them to stand out - a purposeful interruption of the flow."
