body: G&#39;day <BR> <BR>I am working on a corporate identity for a business that
  creates websites for golf clubs. <BR> <BR>I am trying to avoid illustrating boring
  symbols ie. golfers, golfballs, putters, or the world wide web. Instead I decided
  to opt for a typographic solution. <BR> <BR>I played around with Avant Garde and
  came up with the idea of using the registered trademark symbol to symbolise a golf
  ball. <BR> <BR>It is a work in progress, it is in black and white for the moment.

  body: Sorry, but I would suggest starting over. I like nothing about it. <BR>I have
    seen some interesting Golf related logos over the years and the most memorable
    was a golfball shaped like an egg &#40;oval&#41;. I do not recall what it was
    for. Perhaps it was something about a nest, or what came first the....or ... <BR>Something
    clever in that direction would be worth trying.  <BR>Btw. I am guessing the L
    you have is supposed to look like a club with the tilt it has? A bit of a stretch
    for most folks I would guess. <BR>You could try simple type with a club replacing
    the L. not a tilted L., or how about no O just the dimples from a golfball. <BR>

    a interesting idea to suggest the golf  club with the &#34;L&#34; letter and the
    ball with the &#34;r&#34; mark but that registred mark shouldn&#39;t be in the
    center. Try to make something funny. The &#34;O&#34; letter can be replaced with
    a golf ball for example. Also, I would not use different angles for the letters...

  body: 'Geoff: <BR> <BR>This is the first time in a while that I think Avant Garde
    is an appropriate choice for logotype. As you indicated in your original post,
    this is a work-in-progress, and as the rest of the posts indicate, you still have
    a lot of work to do. <BR> <BR>I like Avant Garde because it is a clean typeface
    which is appropriate for the golfing community. I also like the implications of
    balls &#40;we all know what I mean here&#41; created by the circular letterforms.
    I would suggest exploring more subtle approaches to manipulating the type than
    what you have done, thus far. <BR> <BR>The &#34;W&#34; with the &#34;R-ball&#34;
    implies a bouncing ball, which I don&#39;t think is the most beautiful shot to
    highlight. If I was showcasing a shot I think it would either be a long drive,
    or a perfect putt. The drive would require an arc and the putt would require a
    hole. I don&#39;t know if either of these would work into this logo, but you might
    sketch out a few ideas. <BR> <BR>The &#34;L-club&#34; looks much more like a hockey
    stick to me. That starts alluding to Happy Gilmore, which albeit is a classic
    in my eyes, but I don&#39;t know how the more serious golfing community views
    that one. <BR> <BR>Probably the most simple solution is to put some dimples in
    the &#34;O&#34; and call it good, but my guess is that the &#34;O&#34; in golf
    has been used as a golf ball hundreds of times over &#40;but I can&#39;t support
    that with any research at this time&#41;. As I mentioned above, I like the concept
    of implied balls and subtle letterform manipulation. <BR> <BR>Good luck! I&#39;m
    anxious to see what you come up with. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott'

    not to do a typical solution ie, golfball as the O in golf. I want to find an
    unique, original solution to this problem. <BR> <BR>Hmm, although Golf is considered
    an upscale sport,  alot of people dont consider it upscale. I agree, my first
    idea was too &#34;Street&#34;. What I am trying here is to design something modern
    and upscale but friendly. <BR> <BR>I know I am posting ideas that are radically
    different to one other. The one I like at the moment is the circular/geometric
    &#34;golfweb&#34; logotype &#40;3rd on the top right&#41;. I feel the geometric
    circluar shape reminds me of golfballs. What do you think? <BR> <BR>Keywords for
    this project for me are golf, web design and cocnnection/interation. As Golfweb
    is essentially a web design company for golf clubs. <BR> <BR>Thank you for the

    This last iteration is nice and simple, but I feel that with a simple marque like
    that you need stronger type. I concur with your use of a sans face, but if you&#39;re
    straddling the upscale/classy set as well as the contemporary and tech-savvy,
    you may need something with a bit more presence.  <BR> <BR>I think something simple

    This is crucial for the designs I have in mind for the business card, letterhead

    I think I prefer a circluar typeface as it complements the marque. I still like

    You might want to confirm with the client that this is OK. Right not it appears
    that copy would have to be contained within an area about 3 in from both the top
    and bottom, which only leaves 5 in for content. <BR> <BR>2 I&#39;m not seeing
    the golfball in the contact info. Maybe show an edge of the ball. Maybe add some
    golf ball dimples so that the letters are simply a continuation of the dimples

  body: Scott, I will be bringing it up at the WIP. From our last meeting, it was
    my impression that they will not need lots of word space. At the moment it is
    roughly 65 characters per line for a maximum of probably about 25 lines &#40;that
    is about 1500 characters&#41;. But if need so, I will move the balls closer to
    the edge or re-design it. <BR> <BR>The ball, I agree, the more I look at it, the
    harder i recognise it as a goftball heh. I am working on solutions to this, a
    faded colour marque behind it may solve it. <BR> <BR>Thanks again Scott.

  body: the contact-info-as-a-golfball seems very forced. I don&#39;t think you need
    it, and I think it detracts from the main mark.  <BR> <BR>

  body: 'Geoff: <BR> <BR>That&#39;s definitely not the answer. You&#39;ve got a strong
    mark and I agree with Darrel, that this new element is detracting from it. <BR>
    <BR>A couple of random thoughts if you do want to try to make it work: <BR> <BR>1
    Your idea might work OK on the bizcard if you completed the silhouette of the
    tee to bleed off of the bottom of the card. This gives it some purpose &#40;clarifying
    the tee of the mark&#41; vs. just repeating the existing mark in a weaker fashion.
    If you did this, you might also try typing golfweb really small and repeating
    it across the bottom edge of the card so that it is like grass. Also, centering
    it isn&#39;t very interesting. <BR> <BR>2 Maybe you can type golfweb really small
    and repeat it so that it floods the card &#40;grass&#41;, except for a round circle
    that represents a golf ball. You can even make the type get a little larger from
    top to bottom representing perspective. <BR> <BR>...just brainstorming thoughts.
    <BR> <BR>Aloha!'

    the text, try a Futura with a small x-height. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    back and forth with this project. I need some good ideas. So I&#39;ll work on
    some ideas. <BR> <BR>Cheers.

  body: Geoff, I agree with scott and darrel on your latest version. <BR> <BR>Adding
    the repeated graphic dilutes the punch of the first. Not only that, but it changes
    my perception, and now they seem to be dialogue bubbles from a comic strip. <BR>
    <BR>By the way, I am very impressed with your direction and development. Nice
    work.

    very happy with what he saw so far. I would like to thank everybody for all the
    useful comments. <BR> <BR>Here is a image of the near complete identity package
    I am doing for them. &#40;I still have to do a brochure/website and polo shirts&#41;

  body: 'I like it! <BR> <BR>To be super nitpicky: <BR> <BR> - does your client have
    green toner in their printers?  <BR> <BR> - I&#39;m a fan of one-sided business
    cards for usability&#39;s sake. I&#39;d suggest moving the logotype &#39;golfweb&#39;
    to the info side of the card &#40;leave the icon on the back&#41;. And then do
    &#42;not&#42; use the same typeface for the person&#39;s name. Even with the two-side
    approach, I think using the type for the name dilutes the ID system too much.
    <BR> <BR>- while not as critical as the b-card, I might swap sides on the envolope.
    <BR> <BR>The golfball looks great. Overall, this is reallly nice. Great job.'

  body: Darrel, I&#39;m not sure what you mean by the &#34;green toner&#34;, but my
    client is getting this package printed in pantone 365 &#40;if i remember correctly&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>Hmm, I think that is a good suggestion about the business card. <BR>
    <BR>I think it will be difficult to pick a different typeface that would go nicely
    with avant garde? I am really really new to typography. Any ideas?  <BR> <BR>It
    is early in the morning. Tired, the only thing I can think of at the moment is
    a nice monoweight old style or a stab serif, so it would contrast the sans serif
    so they go together with more harmony then a transitional/modern. <BR> <BR>Cheers.

  body: Great job Geoff! <BR> <BR>I think it works, as is. I like the replication
    of both sides of the bizcard. I actually think that it reinforces the ID. Is Golfweb
    going to print golfballs? <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott

  body: '&#62; Darrel, I&#39;m not sure what you mean by the &#34;green toner&#34;,
    <BR> <BR>Just noticed that the body text was all set in green in your mockup.
    Odds are the body text will be printed in black.  <BR> <BR>&#62; I think it will
    be difficult to pick a different typeface that would go nicely with avant garde?
    I am really really new to typography. Any ideas? <BR> <BR>I&#39;m far from a type
    expert, so I&#39;ll defer to others on a specific typeface, but I&#39;d leave
    avant garde just for the logotype. It doesn&#39;t work great as a text face. <BR>
    <BR>I agree that a contrast with Avant Garde may be the best way to go.'

  body: I&#39;m liking double-sided business card, but as mentioned, I definitely
    would eliminate the competition between the name and the logo. <BR> <BR>For the
    name, at the very least you might try just using a lighter weight of Avant Garde.
    <BR> <BR>Geoff, that golf ball application is sweet. <BR> <BR>&#40;Darrel, good
    call about the green body copy.&#41;
