body: "Hi All,\r\n\r\nI'm working on a text book and wondered if anyone could suggest
  a decent body copy face? I'm drawing a blank here. Main page headings, standfirsts
  etc. will be set in Bodoni (caps for Headings and italicised for standfirsts); I've
  been playing around with Franklin Gothic at 9pt with 11pt leading as a suitable
  body face. I wondered if anyone could suggest anything slightly different to Franklin
  - legibility is paramount for this document as there's a lot of text. Ideally I'm
  looking for a face with a narrow measure without being condensed/compressed so as
  to maximise words on a line.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\nMany thanks, Si"

  body: "Thanks for the suggestions!\r\n\r\n@RadioB I'm not a massive fan of Futura
    - I don't know whay but it's always looked kinda awkard to me - I can't imagine
    setting body copy in it - there's a lot of text. It's maybe more of a display
    face?\r\n\r\n@frode frank Lovely suggestion but a bit too *searches for the right
    word*... decorative? The italic is lovely, I'm going to bear that one in mind
    for some other projects!\r\n\r\n@nina I have to agree, I don't think I'd set body
    copy with Futura! I'd prefer a sans as a foil to Bodoni. I've been looking around
    and quite like the look of Lucas De Groot's Taz III. It's not necessarily out
    of the question to use a serif, but thought it might clash with Bodoni rather
    than accompany it? What would you suggest?"

  body: "@Jackson Nice - thanks very much for pointing it out, I'd not come across
    it before.\r\n\r\n@RadioB Surely it comes down to personal preference? As much
    as I like Bringhurst's work, I'm just not personally keen on Futura; I've always
    found it slightly awkward. It's not got particularly narrow glyphs in its book
    weight, and for the amount of text I need to set, it wouldn't make sense to set
    it condensed - it would be quite difficult to read."

    was just making the point that it is actually used for extended \r\ntext and that
    many designers have been 'there' and continue to go 'there', \r\nobviously if
    you feel that its not right for your work then thats different."

    text; its uniform shapes don't exactly predetermine it to be reader-friendly.\r\n\r\nHumanist
    sans fonts do tend to read [more] nicely; my favorite sans for text would be Legato;
    and I can't help but think of Rotis (possibly the Semi-Sans)* \u2013 but will
    any of these click with Bodoni? I'm not sure. \r\n\r\n(* Even though that's hard
    to use well too [if for other reasons].)"

  body: "I read a novel set in Futura once and the only things that stood out was
    the question mark. I've also seen Minion (text) paired with Didot (quite large
    display) and it worked like a charm even though the pair goes against the usual
    advice. An option to consider is using two or more optical sizes of Bodoni (ITC)
    or Didot (HF&J). \r\n\r\nThe obvious sans match for a modern is, IMO, a grotesque
    or a geometric, but they're rarely good for extended text. One face that comes
    to mind though is Grotext.  "
