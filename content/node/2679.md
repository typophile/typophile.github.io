body: Hi you guys, <BR> <BR>You&#39;ve never let me down in the past but I&#39;m looking
  for the font used on Kylie&#39;s new album, BODY LANGUAGE.  I know it&#39;s a variation
  on the font used for her FEVER album &#40;i.e. Avant Garde&#41; but does anyone
  know its exact name and where I can download it? <BR> <BR>Many many thanks!!! <BR>Graham

  body: The proper name I guess would be ITC Avant Garde Gothic Alternates, but I

    have a place you can buy the font. <BR> <BR>Is it me or is that some of the worst
    typesetting I&#39;ve ever seen.

    Neue...&#41;.
