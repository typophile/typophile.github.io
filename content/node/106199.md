body: I'm curious, I have been working on a font for a while now. I want to post it
  in the critique section for feedback. As many of you know it is quite an investment
  of hours of work. In the back of my head I have a concern that someone could just
  take and copy it (or slightly alter it), and publish before me. Is this a valid
  concern for posters? I know it wouldn't happen too often, I am curious what the
  general concensus is for this. Has there been cases of this before?
