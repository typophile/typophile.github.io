  interview' for an internship slot at Interbrand .\r\n\r\n1)  Just my work in a nice,
  letter format presentation thingy.\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n2) Investing a little more effort,
  letting my love of publication design show. Via semi-book format. Make it a little
  'experience' in itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nEric"

    that would be option 2 \x1F\u2013 but few will hire you because of it. They will
    hire you because of your work and your personality. Focus your strengths on editing
    your portfolio to your best pieces and present them nicely and simply \u2013 that
    would be option 1. It's all about the work and your ability to talk intelligently
    and passionately about it."
