  body: "Allumi Standard Regular?\r\n\r\nI grabbed the logo from [[http://www.hemme-milch.de/tl_files/dokumente/wedemark/Hemme-Milch-Anbieterliste.pdf|this
    PDF]] online, and opened it in Illustrator. After that, Allumi was [[http://new.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/|whatthefont's]]
    best guess.\r\n\r\nBy the way, if you're just looking for the logo, it is in the
    PDF above in vector format."
