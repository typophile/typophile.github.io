  typeface family was created in 1993 as a means to study the transition from Renaissance
  writing into the first printing types. Rather than sticking to the method commonly
  used these days for the creation of revivals of Jenson or Bembo types, it seemed
  more interesting to try and get in the same mindset as those exceptional designers
  during this pivotal period in the history of typography.\r\n\r\nInitially Jean Fran\xE7ois
  Porchez made [[http://www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/view/ApollinePTF|ApollinePTF]]
  drawings modelled after his own calligraphy. They were done at a very small size
  on tracing paper (2 cm high for the capitals) to preserve the irregularity of human
  handwriting. Besides emphasising the horizontal parts of the letter forms, the serifs
  were designed asymmetrically to reinforce the rhythm of the writing. Read more on
