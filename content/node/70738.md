  of the process to obtain my GST number. Or at least I thought I was until the new
  HST made me question what to do.\r\n\r\nWith the new HST set to begin in Ontario
  is this going to change what I need as a freelancer? Do I still need to get a federal
  GST number?\r\n\r\nI'm assuming design services are now taxable for the full HST
  amount falling under professional services? If I'm charging a client in another
  province that also has HST, do I charge them my provincial HST tax rate (Ontario)
  or the client's provincial HST tax rate?\r\n\r\nI'll go searching for these answers
  but just thought that maybe some of you veterans would have an idea what I need
  to do.\r\n\r\nTK"

    manages the GST along with the provincial tax. The Federal site has a very good
    introduction to how it all works, and when I had to get clarification, the tax
    agent helped me greatly. It would probably be a bad idea for me to pass on any
    info I got, since Quebec laws may not apply to your case. Even if you don't get
    an accountant, get some professional advice. "
