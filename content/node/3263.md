  body: Sometimes you just won&#39;t find what you&#39;re looking for. This logo,
    <BR>for example, I believe to be custom made from one of these <BR>multilinears.
    The stroke breaks can be altered by the designer.

  body: <i>We badly need to compile a systematic list of multilined faces as  <BR>they

    for another Font ID Guide. I already have a bunch of older designs in the Bauhaus
    Guide &#40;see several on <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/BauhausFaces1B.html"
    target="_blank">this page</a>&#41;, and I could use those with samples of the
    newer fonts mentioned in your links. &#40;Some of which are no longer working
    links, btw&#41;. I think multi-line and inline fonts could be included. I&#39;ll
    try to get something started this week, and we can use it as a reference for these
    types in the future.

  body: OK, for what it&#39;s worth I have started a new Font ID Guide called <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/LinedFontGuide01.html"
    target="_blank">Lined Font Identification Guide</a>. At this point it consists
    of 2 pages with about 30 fonts each. If I get other suggestions, or samples, I
    will keep expanding it. It&#39;s not linked into the rest of my site, but eventually
    it will have a place in the Site mape and links from other parts of my site. <BR>
    <BR>My impulse has been scratched for the time being.

  body: 'Glad you&#39;re on it, Mike. I think it would be more effective if you <BR>limit
    the Guide to multilinear types rather than including inline <BR>faces, which would
    add a great deal to the pages and make the  <BR>multilinears harder to pick out.

  body: 'Thanks for the input Stephen and the additions. I agree that mixing them
    slows the identification down a bit, so I think I will segregate them by types:
    Multilinear, and Inline. It&#39;s still pretty easy to do with only 2 pages.  <BR>
    <BR>The toughest part at this stage is just getting the images, especially if
    I don&#39;t have the fonts. I have to copy multi-part test drives, or appropriate
    site graphics. &#40;This is a naked appeal to anyone with any multiline fonts,
    or inline fonts, to provide samples showing the complete character set and font
    name. Use either vertical style &#40;250 pixel width&#41; or horizontal layout
    &#40;max 730 pixels wide&#41;, and e-mail the .gifs to me for inclusion. Image
    donors will be credited. Thanks.'

  body: Just for future multiline or inline font question  reference, I have updated
    the new <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/LinedFontGuide01.html" target="_blank">Lined
    Fonts ID Guide</a> to separate the two categories, so that you can search for
    either kind, as Stephen suggested. I also added all the ones that were mentioned
    &#40;if the links were good, and not all of them were&#41;, except Surreal Post-Indian,
    from Type-o-Tones, because I couldn&#39;t find a decent way to produce a sample
    without owning the font.  <BR> <BR>I am also trying to get a good sample of Damien
    Gautier&#39;s  <a href="http://typotek.free.fr/caracteres/lechaufferie.html" target="_blank">&#34;LeChaufferie&#34;</a>,
    if any one has the ability to make one. <BR> <BR>I also welcome any other suggestions
    for inclusion in the Guide.

    I have written to the Fontomas site owner to see if he would agree to provide
    a sample for the Guide.

    much ITC Neon &#40;which I did have&#41;. Larabie&#39;s Mexcellent is the same
    as Olympia, I believe, but I wanted to add it for comparison. I also saw a few
    other candidates in the new Veer catalog, so I&#39;m sure this will keep growing
    for a while.  The suggestions and help you guys have provided has been terrific.
