  you draw out the face by hand, then trace it? Do you start out in illustrator? What
  do you do in illustrator? Do you start with a lineal version, then flesh it out?
  How do you flesh it out? Do you employ stroke width, then polish it, or are you
  a purist, and render only the outlines? Do you start from geometrics, then move
  them around, or do you just draw the characters with the bezier curve tool? Do you
  copy and paste from one character to another? If so, which characters? What are
  your building blocks? How do you approach different weights? Italics?  How about
  references? How much do you use your research while you&#39;re designing? How do
  you go about checking your type in a block of text? Do you revise most at this stage
  or before? <BR> <BR>Something to think about. I&#39;m interested in what other designers
  have to say. <BR> <BR>Christian R. '

  body: ' Too many questions!  :-/ <BR> <BR>In terms of &#34;where&#34; I design,
    it depends on the nature of the typeface. I used to do everything on the computer,
    but the type of designs I&#39;ve started to like to do I really need to draw them
    out first, if not final glyphs, at least good approximations. But a &#42;lot&#42;
    of tweaking still happens after the stuff goes bezier. <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: ' Speaking in broad generalizations, I design in Fontographer, on the computer,
    starting from geometrics &#40;rectangles, usually&#41; and convert points to curves/Bezi&eacute;r
    control points &#40;BCP&#41; as needed. <BR> <BR>On rare occasion, I will draw
    something, scan it, then convert it to outlines. More frequently I will draw out
    an idea on graph paper &#40;taking note of approximate locations of vital extrema
    points and angles&#41;, then redraw it in Fontographer. <BR> <BR>I have also found
    that what they say is true: the fewer control points, the better. You&#39;d be
    amazed at the control you can get using only endpoints and the cardinal extrema
    points &#40;north, south, east &amp; west&#41;. I rarely even use a control point
    at the directional change in the midpoint of the spine of an &#34;s&#34;, for
    example. I&#39;ve found that &#40;usually&#41; a smoother curve can be obtained
    &#40;with remarkable control&#41; by limiting myself to the east and west extrema
    and controlling the shape of the curve by dragging out these two points&#39; BCPs.
    <BR> <BR>As for italics and weight variations, I&#39;ve found that the most success
    comes from redrawing the characters from scratch. I&#39;ll usually paste a copy
    of the original glyph in the working window for reference, but trying to convert
    one glyph to another usually leads to more cleanup work that it is worth. Similarly,
    using Fontographer&#39;s skewing or weight change options often &#40;but not always&#41;
    leads to more work than simply starting the glyph from scratch. <BR> <BR>I do,
    however, rely a great deal &#40;some may say too much, I suppose&#41; on cutting
    and pasting parts from one glyph to build another within the same font. <BR> <BR>I
    also find myself using mathematics a lot to compare widths, length, and often
    BCPs of similar or rational curves. For example, if the BCPs at the top of the
    uc &#34;C&#34; are 150 units away from the extrema point, then I make sure they
    are similarly 150 units away on the bottom extrema point. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d still
    love some hints on hinting, however. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: ' During the time I had been working with PC &#40; windows&#41;. On begining
    it was complicated because I started to draw the forms with corel draw and  <BR>I
    generated the true type with the same program. It was a very hard <BR>way to control
    the potencial of the work &#40;clean forms and good syntax&#41;. <BR>But during
    that period I tryed to experiment very technics to tasted the potencional of the
    programs and the process. &#40; lots of people think&#39;s poor guy, which work
    with PC  <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":&#41;">.
    So I founded the Fontographer and all kind of difficults of the past are gone!!!.  I
    also work with Fg on MAC and I made some type faces with freehand but sicerely
    I prefer my old corel draw 7 to draw my work because I like the tools and the
    way to control the bezier points. Normaly I creat my own  factory or a table to
    work the layout and the forms of letters. &#41;. Some of my type faces were are
    draw directly on paper the idea and some notes to desenvolve and devolepment with
    a digital technology. I created a standart layout with the rigth dimentions to
    use as a true type font 2048 &#40;points&#41;, but sometimes I make some adjustments
    to some special situation. I continue to draw and generate the true type with
    corel draw &#40; temporary file &#41; which I only used to work only to draw my
    type faces, next I opean the file on Fg to correct all forms and finnaly the syntax
    correction. I had been make some corrections with prints prof on paper &#40;300
    dpi&#41; to make the visual correction. But since I had been presentation my stuff
    on typophile forum I had been make some corrections to adapted the print function
    as a display type face. I also would like to know the way to transport the vectorial
    &#40;BCP&#41; information from freehand to Fg? &#40;only curiosity&#41;. '
