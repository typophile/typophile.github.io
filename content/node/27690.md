  If not, I'll post back here with what I come up with.

  body: "I think John Hudson posted some files in a thread I can't find right now.
    All I found was <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/10633#comment-66736\">this
    post</a>.\r\n\r\nOr perhaps what I recall is <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/5028\">this
    thread about Cyrillic</a>.\r\n\r\nBTW, there's an undocumented version of [[adhesiontext]]
    that outputs all the words unaccented (notice this is different from \"that outputs
    all the unaccented words\").\r\nThis means for example that, in this version,
    if you type \u03B1 (alpha), words with \u03AC (alphatonos) will also be matched,
    but the output text will have every occurrence of <em>alphatonos</em> replaced
    by <em>alpha</em>. Feel free to use it, if it helps you http://www.adhesiontext.com/greekMATD/\r\n\r\nThis
    version is handy because, in case you don't know (I didn't, until Gerry Leonidas
    told me), most Greek words are accented. If I recall correctly, words with more
    than two syllables will always be accented.\r\nThe main Greek version of adhesiontext
    respects the user's input, but this <em>comes with a price</em>, however; people
    normally just type unaccented Greek letters, and that will constrain the result
    to use only about 500 unique words, since that's the total number of unaccented
    words in the database (the total number of words in the database is above 120
    thousand \u2014 that includes accented and unaccented)."

  body: "I have some Greek kerning files for use within FontLab's metrics window.
    They are based on analysis of Greek New Testament. As such, they reflect Koine
    spellings, so may not be perfect for earlier classical or later texts, but they're
    very extensive so likely cover most pairs. [I have some additional analysis of
    concordances and the works of Josephus, but I have not made kerning files out
    of it yet.] The analysis ignored accents, so what you get are all the pairs that
    occur regardless of whether they might take accents. So they are a good basis
    for class kerning. The files include specific word-initial pairs, because these
    are useful for kerning uppercase accented letters to following lowercase letters
    without massive redundancy. Of course, the files use my own glyph naming conventions,
    but they are fairly intuitive.\r\n\r\nI have put the files in a zip, and uploaded
    it <a href=\"http://www.tiro.com/John/GreekNTKerning.zip\">here</a>. The zip file
    also contains Word doc test files of the same word lists.\r\n\r\n"
