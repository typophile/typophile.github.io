body: "Hi there!\r\n\r\nFirst of all: I know nothing whatsoever about Internet programming.
  I just want to give a hint to a guy who do me a favour with an internet project.\r\n\r\nOK.
  I want the text on my webpage to appear NOT antialiased, but sharp just with black
  pixels for example.\r\nIs that possible with Monaco, Andale Mono etc. Or do I have
  to use something special?\r\nIs there a certain adjustment in the stylesheet?\r\n\r\njust
  like here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.blanka.co.uk/\r\n\r\nor here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.plusminus.ca/\r\n\r\nCan
  anybody please give me a hint how to achieve that?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nJuergen\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n "

  body: "I think he wants the opposite of images of text. Or maybe a better way to
    explain it is he seems to want a pixelated look. Is that correct? Are you basically
    trying to get the strokes of the letter forms to be about one pixel wide?\r\n\r\nIf
    you increase the size of the text on those Web pages (command +), you'll see that
    the type maintains its crispness and the strokes get larger than a single pixel
    or two in width. \r\n\r\nCheck out the CSS for those two sites to see what size
    they set the type in question. I feel the look they've achieved is based on the
    type size because it actually is just HTML and not a jpeg."

  body: You might also wan't to look into Sifr. It's a method using flash to embed
    fonts. I think you can't define text size in pixels though, so using a pixel font
    tends to cause problems.

  body: The stylesheet of http://www.blanka.co.uk/ sets the text size at 9px. If you
    see the site in FireFox or Safari you can enlarge or reduce the text size (command
    +, command -) and, you see that the text rendering become 'antialiased'. If you
    use Explorer you can't make the text bigger since it is set in pixel. So you can
    only set the text as small as you can in pixels and hope that the user doesn't
    enlarge the text size.

    over that at the site author.\r\n\r\nYour only option, as stated, is to put your
    text into an image or flash file. There are usability/accessibility issues with
    that that you'll want to take into consideration that may or may not be an issue

    is correct: Short of embedding images or objects such as Flash, there's no way
    to guarantee that your text will not be rendered with anti-aliasing."

  body: "Well here's an answer: The sites you list don't necessarily display their
    type anti-aliased. Scale your type larger, it will alias. The trick is simply
    to keep the type small, use typefaces that are predisposed to this behavior, such
    as courier, lucida sans, consolas, or Times New Roman at very small sizes.\r\nUsing
    images in place of functional text (on the web) is a bad practice. That stuff
    doesn't get indexed, isn't selectable, isn't accessible to viewers with (some)
    disabilities and if it's small, isn't even legible to many sighted web users."

  body: "This is something that it's a Bad Idea to try to control. Web design is not
    print design; you do not have and cannot take complete to-the-pixel control of
    what your users see when they look at a proper web site. \r\n\r\nI turn off anti-aliasing
    on my computer because that's what I want. Other people turn it on because that's
    what they want. Some people have no choice in the matter and always have it on
    (Mac users), and seeing non-anti-aliased text would be a jarring and uncomfortable
    experience for most of them.\r\n\r\nThe ways of cheating around this are just
    as bad. If you use images or Flash, people can no longer do things they can do
    with proper web sites. They may not be able to resize your text to suit them;
    they may not be able to copy and paste text at will; blind people's screen-readers
    may not work, or middle-clicking links to open in a new tab may be broken (like
    with the Typophile front page), or any number of other things may break that work
    with proper web sites.\r\n\r\nI know it kinda sucks that you can't make it look
    Exactly How You Want It, but that's simply inherent to the web, and you need to
    embrace it rather than fight it.\r\n\r\n"

    settings, and there is no reasonable way for a Web designer to control it. (I
    don't consider using Flash or bitmaps reasonable if all you're trying to do is
    get aliased text.)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "I just stumbled across this website and was a little surprised to find that
    no-one had recommended bitmap or raster fonts to Jui?\r\n\r\nThe following code
    snippet works under Vista + IE7 + \"Always use cleartype rendering\".\r\n<code>&lt;p
    style=\"font: System\"&gt;testing 1,2,3, over.&lt;/p&gt;</code>\r\nUnder vista
    there's also: MS Serif, MS Sans Serif, Modern and Courier.\r\n\r\nLinux has a
    bunch of bitmap fonts to choose from.\r\n\r\nBut apple could be a problem.  According
    to the apple developer website ...\r\n\r\n\"Note: Bitmap font resources are not
    supported in Mac OS X. Font families that consist entirely of bitmap font resources
    are ignored by Quartz-based applications that use Cocoa, Apple Type Services for
    Unicode Imaging (ATSUI), or Multilingual Text Engine (MLTE). These font families
    are not available for use in such user interface elements as menus, windows, and
    static and editable text controls.\"\r\n\r\nSo if Safari uses ATSUI or MLTE to
    generate the web-page then your out of luck there.  Perhaps someone could confirm
    with a standard apple bitmap font (if one exists)?\r\n\r\nHTH"
