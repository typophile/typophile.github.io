body: "I generate my font (otf with kerning pairs). I use Extensis Suitcase 2 as my
  font management app, so I add my font to Suitcase and some (not all) kerning pairs
  looks terribly bad _but_ when I test it in Illustrator, the kerning looks good.
  Any ideas of what might be causing this?\r\n\r\nThanks!!!"
