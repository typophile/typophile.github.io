body: hello fellow typophiles. My flatmate and I are students working on our first
  &#39;real&#39; brief, which is a poster and brochure for the 2004 Wanganui Summer
  School of the Arts. The summer school is a program one can attend during the summer
  holidays and participate in a myriad of activities. I suppose quite a lot is riding
  on the promotion, for the summer school has been defunct for many years and the
  powers that be have decided to resurrect it.  <BR> <BR>Because of budget constraints
  &#40;and we thought it would be more challenging&#41; it is a two colour job, with
  &#39;pantone process blue U&#39; and &#39;pantone red 032 U&#39; as our colours.
  <BR> <BR>The client&#39;s keywords are &#34;intense, serious, fun, creative and
  interaction&#34;. So we would very much like to know how we are doing. Trim size
  is 320mm X 320mm. Thanks! <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/11151.jpg"

  body: I definitely like the direction you are going.  The anatomical illustration
    is &#34;fun&#34; and slightly intense as well. <BR> <BR>I wasn&#39;t so into the
    cellular lettering.  It turned me off a bit at first, but it makes sense.  However,
    I see it being more dominant than Wanganui School of the Arts.  In fact that isn&#39;t
    being connected top to bottom.  I think this element needs to be bigger, and perhaps
    the top and bottom need be blue. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m still not sure about the Summer
    School type, but I can&#39;t quite articulate why. <BR> <BR>Hope this helps

  body: You&#39;ve got some style! It&#39;s rare that I like this sort of thing -
    maybe it&#39;s the mix of funky elements and &#34;traditional&#34; layout. Go
    go go! <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: It&#39;s often that I like this sort of thing - this is cool! I like the colors
    and line weight. Reminds me of t-shirts from my youth, for some reason. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
    not so sure why the double-ended ring finger should stand out so much from the
    other letters, though something needs to. I agree with Peter and say, give that
    attention and detail to Wanganui School of the Arts, and let the rest lay back.
    <BR> <BR>And, I need a judges decision on this but, should the hyphen between
    11 and 17 be an en or em dash? I don&#39;t remember which. <BR> <BR>Great stuff!
    I want one!

  body: Sorry. En dash for durations and spans. No space &#40;aside from letterspace&#41;
    around the en dash. <BR> <BR>Thank James Felici&#39;s &#60;a href=&#34;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0321127307/qid=1054517181/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/102-2603355-1387351?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846"

  body: here is an updated version, the one which our lovely client is going to take
    to the superiors to get the Big Seal of Approval. Thanks for the comments, I don&#39;t
    think the dash is fixed yet. But will be fixed soon. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/11341.jpg"
