  body: "I have been unable to locate anything that even matches the K. Sirius Konsum
    appears to be too consistent for me to say that it's hand-drawn with any certainty,
    although I suppose it's possible. I have looked in almost every book I have, including
    pre-digital, without finding anything even particularly close.\r\n\r\nFor lack
    of any clues, I'd have to guess 'custom'.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: My thoughts as well -- I find the technical quality of the character shapes
    to be a little below par, especially the capitals. I trust your judgement.
