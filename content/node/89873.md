  I\u2019m contemplating to integrate an integer value representing the computer\u2019s
  speed into the code to receive the best fidelity/performance ratio. To see if this
  returns useful results on your Macs, could you please run this code locally on your
  computer and post results back here?\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://schnellmussesgehenundbilligmussessein.de/stamina.py\">Python
  code</a>\r\n\r\nThank you"

  body: "@hrant\r\n\r\nThis particular code relies on the <em>sysctl</em> command
    and should work on more UNIXes, I guess. I\u2019m working on a plugin for Glyphs
    and RoboFont, so Windows is not of interest at the moment.\r\nThe last number
    in the output would be the maximum amount of items the plugin draws into the glyph
    view before rendering slows down. The more, the better the illustration, the slower.
    But I don\u2019t want to compromise on snappiness."

    script instead of passing the script to the Python interpreter as it should. Workaround:
    'python stamina.py'.\r\n\r\nAside: Tried running stamina.py on a Linux box, but
    since it does not have the sysctl program, the result was predictably limited."

    by pasting code? Try doing this instead:\r\n\r\n1. At the terminal prompt, type
    \"python \" including the space, but not the quotes, and don't hit return yet.\r\n2.
    Drag the \"stamina.py\" file onto the terminal window. (This enters the path to
    the script.)\r\n3. Now hit return. (Be sure Terminal is the front-most app when
    you do this.)"
