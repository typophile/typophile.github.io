body: "There was a discussion here recently on this matter. I was waiting for a piece
  of work to be printed before contributing, but alas, I cannot find the thread.\r\n\r\nI
  explored a line of thought which suggests a methodology of finding this 'perfect'
  / 'average' / 'agreed' typeface. The idea is not new: it is essentially Frutiger's
  'a'. The difference here is that I used programming / automation to more quickly
  arrive at results. What I should've done, but didn't at the time, was to take the
  average left and right sidebearing's for each character also. It would be interesting
  to test the results on a vastly greater number of types, but of course, the method
  of experiment here is questionable.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.moreducks.com/other/metabet_font.jpg\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.be/details.php?entry=246"

  body: "Well, scientist already tried that with human faces. Take 100 portraits and
    morph them togheter. You will get a face, that everyone will consider beautiful.
    But still, most people will prefer a beautiful face of a real person. \r\nI guess
    the same is true for typefaces. A \"perfect\" typeface is one that fulfills its
    purpose. An avarage typeface will never be perfect, because it is not optimized
    for a certain purpose. \r\n\r\nBut nevertheless I would love to see a this typeface!

    Ondine kinda breaks the mold!"
