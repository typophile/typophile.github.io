  assigned the task of finding bad typography, I immediately thought of Real Estate
  advertisements. The use of 5 different typefaces can be really distracting and doesn't
  help establish any hierarchy. Also there is no real use of scale within the different
  types to establish hierarchy as well. There is really no place for the eye to rest,
  because there is something going on in each four corners, leaving an awkward negative
  space in the center. The photo's are covered in a bold sanserif, possibly Helvetica,
  which is very distracting. The descriptions are centered aligned in all caps. There
  are so many distractions. The vital information of phone numbers get lost in the
  corner. \r\n"
