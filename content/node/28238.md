body: "Hello to all. I have just joined the Typophile list, in the selfish hope of
  getting some advice on a problem.\r\n\r\nI am a font designer, using Windows XP,
  FontLab 4.6 and Studio 5, and MS VOLT. I have been commissioned to add a Unicode
  Hebrew set to the Gentium font (with the permission of its owners SIL). No problem
  with the Windows side of this, but my client needs AAT data added to the font, so
  that it will behave correctly in Mac applications that don't support OpenType.\r\n\r\nThe
  data is for one purpose only: to place vowel points on the Hebrew letters. Cantillation
  marks are not required, luckily (even in Lucida Grande these don't work properly).\r\n\r\nHe
  has provided me with a Mac running the latest OS 10.4.7, and I have the Apple Font
  Tools v 3.\r\n\r\nI have been trying to use ftxenhancer to add data from an .add
  file to this font, using the command ftxenhancer -v -A FluentL2.add FluentL.ttf\r\n\r\nThe
  -v switch is for 'verbose', so that the stages of the process are reported. It starts,
  and runs as far as 'Generating XML data', then sticks and I get a 'Bus error'.\r\n\r\nThe
  font, although made with Windows, passes ftxanalyser's test without report of a
  fault, and works normally on the Mac. \r\n\r\nThe .add file, in XML format, was
  composed by extracting a sample .add file from the font with ftxanalyser, which
  included some Hebrew instructions, and rewriting these to fit my requirements.\r\n\r\nIt
  is absolutely possible that I have made some stupid error in the .add file, but
  if so, I can't spot it. At present I am using a small test file that has instructions
  only to place vowels on alef, so it is easy to check the text.\r\n\r\nThe font didn't
  have the same glyph names as those of Lucida Grande: these all end in '-hebrew'.
  Thinking that it might be vital to use official glyph names, I renamed all the Hebrew
  characters in LG style, and altered the .add file and tried again. \r\n\r\nBut this
  still caused a bus error. Anyway, in doing this I discovered that the Hebrew glyph
  names in LG contained several irregularities and one misspelling, so I doubt that
  exact names matter here.\r\n\r\nIn case anyone is interested enough to want a look,\r\n\r\nwww.users.dircon.co.uk/~hancock/FluentLTest.zip\r\nwww.users.dircon.co.uk/~hancock/FluentLXTest.zip\r\n\r\ncontain
  the first and second versions of the font, with their .add files. But if anyone
  else has had trouble with ftxenhancer, I should be very grateful for some more general
  pointers.\r\n\r\nThank you very much in advance,\r\n\r\nRalph Hancock\r\nhancock@dircon.co.uk\r\nwww.users.dircon.co.uk/~hancock\r\n\r\n"
