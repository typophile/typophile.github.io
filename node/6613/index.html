		<div class="commentbody">I'll second everything Si has said, and will add one more suggestion: specialists are more easily remembered than generalists. You probably will be happy to pick up any kind of type design work you can, but it pays to market yourself as a specialist: someone who can offer specific services to a particular niche market. If you get a couple of jobs in that area, and do them well, your name will get around. A number of type designers have successfully identified themselves with particular markets, e.g. Jonathan Hoefler with custom types for magazine art directors. Apart from helping to get you remembered, this approach also gets you more of the kind of work you want to be doing, presuming you pick a speciality that you enjoy.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">By retail I guess I mean making fonts without a direct commission and selling them to the public (for whatever price). The only time I myself have managed to make enough money doing that was when: I had a virtual strangle-hold on the Armenian market; and I was a bachelor living in a small -if comfy- apartment.  :-/ <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think the best way to address the retail market is the way many big names do it: design a font under commission, give the client exclusivity for 2-3 years (after which the novelty value is gone), and after that put it out for general sale. And price high. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Marketing: use online forums, conferences, and &quot;networking&quot;. Try to get people to use pre-release versions of your fonts in real projects (maybe give them a break - but make sure they're not the type to &quot;share&quot; the fonts too much), and use those to show them off. There's nothing as effective as a physical newspaper or a high-gloss piece in your hand with your font(s) on it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But the fonts have to be good.

Get help wherever you can. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Which brings me to&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->2. Confidence/Boldness<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is so useful to improve the quality of your work, and also to  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->moving your work once it is quality.

Ask for their help.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Especially go to people in the old guard. They are usually so  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->excited to see a new generation of designers they will often  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bend over backwards to help you. Type designers are a spry lot&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I was shocked at typecon when less than 8 people wanted to  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->have Akira Kobayashi, Matthew Carter, and John Downer give  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->them pointers. So what if it's was a public forum? That's what  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->you're pushing for in the end isn't it? Gopherit! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I've heard some say, don't ask for too much advice or you will <!-- raw HTML omitted -->loose your own voice for everyone elses. I hear that argument, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->but think it applies mostly to people who already know their way <!-- raw HTML omitted -->around letters. At first, get as much input as you can from people <!-- raw HTML omitted -->you can trust (such as those mentioned). <!-- raw HTML omitted -->  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Finally, let me say I only have one font commercially available,  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->soon to be two. Needless to say, type design makes up a small  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->part of my income (and take my advice with a grain of salt!). I'm  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a graphic designer with one toe in the font world. Hopefully it  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->will soon be one foot in fonts. Then maybe graphic design can  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->be the small part of my income.

I mean EVERYBODY. I printed up 300 shiny new business cards and everything. Some designers where very receptive when I showed them things, and they made my day (or, in the case of H&amp;FJ, they made my whole <!-- raw HTML omitted -->conference<!-- raw HTML omitted --> ). Some other designers were quite clear that they did not want to look at things. Again, naming names here would be impolite. Sometimes, you need to realize though that at a large event&ndash;Typo Berlin had 1000 attendants and hundreds of students&ndash;certain people (especially the German speakers) field requests constantly. For example, at one point I waited in line for a half an hour to speak with Erik Spiekermann. And as each new student got up to him, asking him (sometimes downright harrasing) questions, I could see his engery level getting lower and lower. By the time I got to him, he just seemed tired. He asked me to email him instead, and I did. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Be bold!<!-- raw HTML omitted --> But be careful, too.</div>

I would suggest a budding type designer not get too hung up on preserving your innovative or theoretical genius.

Looking back at my first fonts, what seemed ground breaking at the time, was really something requiring *technical feedback*</div>

		<div class="commentbody">At the time I was thinking about the diacritics. I picked Welsh, because someone else (David Earls?) was asking about it in a different thread, and picked CAS knowing that Ross had that market cornered. I agree with the other people on the thread that finding a niche is a good way of 'breaking in', and that the niche may not necessarily be a minority language. It could be cultural or it could be serving a particular type of device or technology. It could equally be serving a community like the Linux community.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->With respect to the fonts Darren provided to Debian, these are now open source so assuming the license is really OS, anyone is free to modify, extend, hint them, sell them, bundle them etc., But Darren has the advantage of being the original creator of these so should be able to promote himself as the person best suited to doing the work.   <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cheers, Si</div>
