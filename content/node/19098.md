  body: "My god that is a general question. Can you give more of an indication of
    what sorts of fonts interest you? Sans vs serif, classic vs modern? Or show some
    examples of newspapers you think work particularly well?\r\n\r\nFor text probably
    best to use a classic serif font for readability/flexibility, but even within
    that category there are so many to choose from. "

  body: "I've done several co-ordinated schemes.\r\n\r\nBrown (Sans) and Worldwide
    (Serif) are both semi-condensed, have a similar finish, with display and text
    weights.\r\n\r\nHere's a PDF.\r\nhttp://www.africawoman.net/images/educatinggirlsinafrica.pdf\r\n\r\nWalburn
    is a serif headline face that also matches Brown.\r\n\r\nThey are the heads in
    this PDF, today's Globe and Mail:\r\nhttp://www.newseum.org/media/dfp/pdf7/CAN_TGAM.pdf\r\n\r\nYou
    can also see them at Myfonts.\r\n\r\nFor a Jenson-style combo, Nicholas is a display
    weight of Goodchild."
