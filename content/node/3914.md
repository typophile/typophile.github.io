    I&#39;m gonna ask tomorrow. shouldn&#39;t any distortion be a matter of paperstock...not
    the press? i.e. cotton papers will stretch of course. vs mylar which well, can&#39;t
    at all. '

  body: ' asked the reps on this weeks press checks.  <BR> <BR>According to all the
    pressmen here it sounds like a an excuse, they explain that a bump on the press
    is usually a bad screen from the designer files causing distortion and clogging
    on the screen. '

  body: ' Thanks for asking around, the problem that happend came from a solid pms
    colour with no screen. The colour was flooded through the job, however there&#39;s
    a slight difference in ink consistency . I know it sounds like a big execuse on
    their side, but the printer is fairly reputable and I just wanted to hear if anyone
    else has had a smiliar situation - guess not'
