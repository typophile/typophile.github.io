  in Design (York University in Toronto) and we're throwing a fundraiser next week
  for our fourth year grad show in May.\r\n\r\nThere is a ton of lead type up for
  auction including full fonts (most include all majuscules, minuscules, punctuation
  and figures) of Univers, Kennerley, Goudy, Times New Roman, Lydian Cursive and almost
  full fonts of Cooper Black, Bodoni, Bembo, News Gothic. There's also mystery bags
  of type that include all sorts of different pieces of type in various fonts and
  weights as well as beautiful paper weights crafted from lead type. This is a once
  in a lifetime kind of opportunity if you live in the GTA!\r\n\r\nOur event, Ultraviolet,
  is happening next Sunday (February 8, 2009) at Bar 244 (at the corner of Duncan
  & Adelaide) and tickets are $22. The night is going to include live music, comedy,
  hors d'oeurves, dancing, lots of door prizes and a silent auction! \r\n\r\nFor more
  info and to buy tickets check out our [[http://ultraviolet.apassionatecuriosity.com/|website]].\r\n\r\nCheck
  out auction [[http://www.flickr.com/photos/ysdn_ultraviolet/|Flickr photostream]].
  \r\n\r\nAll money raised from this event will go towards the 2009 YSDN Grad Show,
  Wonderlust, May 10-14 at Steam Whistle Brewery. \r\n\r\nThanks!!"

  body: It's only six hours by train...my classes start pretty late...I could use
    some more Bodoni...a ton is a lot of type, at least compared to what I have...I
    probably shouldn't go.

  body: Too bad about the type that is now made into paperweights...and the thought
    of type in "bags"  banging around and damaging each other. I guess it is still
    a way to appreciate type.

  body: "It is just a nice way to appreciate type... which otherwise was just going
    to be melted down.\r\n\r\nKeeping in mind it is used type from a university (that
    doesn't have space for it anymore), although it banging around isn't really possible.
    It's pretty darn heavy. \r\n\r\nIt's just a cool opportunity to collect some which
    for most people is pretty impossible. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    that you can raise a little bit of money for yourselves with it. But you are earning
    that cash at the expense of future generations of students.\r\n\r\nSigh\u2026"

  body: The university could have put it in someone's basement like mine did, but,
    considering that people are quite unlikely to use it, I don't mind that some of
    it is being somewhat frivolously sold as gimmicky type souvenirs as having those
    teaches them something about type too.
