body: "I am sure this information ought to be, or ought to have been until recently,
  easily enough available in books... although those books might be in Chinese.\r\n\r\nBut
  all I could find on the Web were tantalizing hints.\r\n\r\n[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_%28typography%29|The
  Wikipedia article]] on the typographical point noted that there was a Chinese system
  of type sizes labelled with numerals... and noted the modern type sizes assigned
  as approximations to them in <strong>Microsoft Word</strong>!\r\n\r\nI had thought
  there must be a better source of information than that.\r\n\r\nI found [[http://www.tug.org/tugboat/Contents/contents26-2.html|an
  issue of TUGboat]] in which a Chinese printer, reminiscing, gave different values
  for the numbered sizes - the article of interest is \"Typesetting Chinese: a personal
  perspective\".\r\n\r\nAnd then, on Google Books, I found a preview of the book \"Gutenberg
  in Shanghai: Chinese Print Captialism, 1876-1937\" by Christopher A. Reed, which
  had, on page 54, an illustration of a short specimen of the four indigenous Chinese
  styles of modern movable type, in the numbered sizes.\r\n\r\nI am now speculating
  that the sizes may be based on a common unit, nominally 1 3/4 points in size, but
  actually slightly smaller, perhaps exactly 1/42 of an inch.\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nTwo-line
  Double Small Pica  Initial  42    24\r\nDouble Pica                 #1       28
  \   16\r\nDouble Small Pica           #2       21    12\r\nTwo-Line Brevier            #3
  \      16.5  10\r\nThree-Line Diamond          #4       14     8\r\nSmall Pica                  #5
  \      10.5   6\r\nBrevier                     #6        8.25  5\r\nRuby                        #7
  \       5.25  3\r\n                            #8        5\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nThe
  second-last column is the presumed size in slightly shrunken points, the last column
  the size in the basic unit.\r\n\r\nIf anyone knows the real facts here and can reveal
  them to me, so that I can replace my guess with the truth, I would be very happy."

    searching with the information you gave me, and that allowed me to find [[http://tonan.seesaa.net/article/239086453.html|this
    blog page]] in Japanese with a nice table giving the exact dimensions I sought."

  body: "Incidentally, [[http://www.um.u-tokyo.ac.jp/publish_db/1996Moji/05/5901.html|this
    page]], also in Japanese, turned out to be even more informative, finally giving
    me the exact sizes I sought.\r\n\r\nIt did take some effort to distinguish the
    sizes for the Japanese version of this scale from those for the original Chinese
    version, but I think I managed it despite Google Translate being only of limited
    assistance. Perhaps the Korean scale is in one of the tables too, but for now
    I am defeated there."
