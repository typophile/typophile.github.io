  about 400. This is my own fault, but I also think I am just really rusty at writing
  papers.\r\n\r\nThe paper is on typography and tattoos.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any
  good resources? Or any tips on beginning/finishing a research paper?\r\n\r\nI am
  pretty desperate so if anyone could help right away, that would be amazing!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMatt"

    Hopefully you go to a school that allows any assignment to be redone and resubmitted.

    to ink an uppercase alphabet on your arm, and interview him/her during the process.
    \r\n\r\nThat way you're sure to get an \"A\" ;-)   "
