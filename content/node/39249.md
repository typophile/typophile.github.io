body: "Hi all\r\n\r\nWanted to gauge reactions to this work-in-progress, for a logo
  design for a surfing magazine. \r\n\r\nThe target demographic is 6-16 year olds,
  male and female, with a view to (strapline) promote grassroots surfing in Australia.\r\n\r\nIt's
  a redrawn Riptcure font for the logo, and for all other type  I'm using Gill Sans.\r\n\r\nToying
  with the idea of a serif to contrast against Gill - that's also very contemporary
  - any thoughts?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    face, more rounded. gill is too 30s. '

  body: "In its current state, I don't think this is very successful. Chopping off
    the leg of the R and the bottom of the F to make room for \"Australia\" feels
    arbitrary, rather than clever. (Sorry, Kat, I don't see a fin.) The area where
    the leg of the R leaves the bowl is  too thick.\r\n\r\nThe curves of the S are
    lumpy, and don't match the R and F very well. The U is too wide -- its big, open
    shape dominates the logo.\r\n\r\nConsider slanting \"Australia\" (in a more contemporary
    face, as Vanina suggests) to match the angle of SURF. And you might add a bit
    more weight overall; the whole thing feels a little spindly.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I'm not sure what typeface "SURF" is, but it isn't very well drawn. The "U"
    is too wide, and the characters are a bit wonky. Take a look at <A HREF="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/creative_alliance/neo_tech/">Neo
    Tech</A> or <A HREF="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/creative_alliance/neo_sans/">Neo
    Sans</A> . I would encourage you to look at some unique type for the sans as well
    instead of Gill.

    alternatives to the direction you've gone in, I wonder if this \"tech\" look suits
    a surfing magazine? Here are a couple other ideas with a different \"feel\" that

  body: "Chris K, you're very helpful! \r\n\r\nI lack the imagination to see the fonts
    just above as working for that masthead, though... But I'm sure you could make
    them work. \r\n\r\nI really like that in the original masthead, SURF is slanted...
    It goes really well with the angle of a surfer's body. DIN bold italic may be
    another good option."
