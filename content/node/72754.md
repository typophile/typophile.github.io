  come across a set of numerals they are using in the section talking about the 25
  best city worldwide. I can figure it out.\r\nWhat typeface is that? The numerals
  are so nicely detailed and yet bold and classy.\r\n\r\nCan anyone help?\r\nIf needed
  I can figure out a way to upload an img of the numerals.\r\n\r\nThank you very much"
