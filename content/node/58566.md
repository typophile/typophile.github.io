  an example). Are these a nineteenth century decorative type innovation, or are they
  older? And when the term \u201CLatin\u201D is used to refer to them, does it refer
  to and older style, or to a newer style of decorative lettering that appeared in
  the 1950s/60s? "

    and were called latin because the triangular shapes of the serifs bear some similarity
    to the terminal shapes inside traditional incised inscriptions, but I don\u2019t
    know for sure. But the letter forms bear an even stronger resemblance to Roman
    coinage; perhaps that is the source:\r\n\r\nhttp://jp29.org/capmon.htm\r\n\r\n"

    mentions that the wedge serif typeface is a nineteenth century innovation. And
    if I remember correctly, Rob Roy Kelly has examples of them in his book on American
    wood types.
