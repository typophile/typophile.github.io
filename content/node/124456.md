  Shot 2015-04-08 at 4_6428.10.36 PM.png]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m not sure
  how one renders this French word with title case:\r\n\r\nLalique hommage \xE0 l\u2019homme\r\n\r\nIs
  this correct? \r\n\r\nLalique Hommage \xE0 l\u2019Homme ...with the H capitalized
  in both instances?\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\nLalique Hommage \xE0 L\u2019Homme ...should
  the L be capilalized too?\r\n\r\nLalique uses a dumb apostrophe in the word \u201Cl\u2019homme\u201D,
  I assume that using \u2019 is correct, rather than something else like `.\r\n\r\nComments
  much appreciated.\r\n\r\nMike Diaz :-)"

    article, then the first noun and any adjectives that proceed it are capitalized,
    so |Lalique hommage \xE0 l\u2019homme| would be considered correct.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    there are differing schools of thought on this:\r\nhttp://french.about.com/library/writing/bl-capitalizationoftitles.htm"

  body: "It would be < Lalique Hommage \xE0 l\u2019Homme > It is the name of a product,
    so you generally capitalize the nouns Lalique, Hommage ('homage') and Homme ('man')
    in this case. \xC0 ('to') and l\u2019 ('the') would never be capitalized. Bonne
    chance !"

  body: "Well, if you go on Lalique's own site, http://www.lalique-parfums.com/fr/hommage-lhomme-0,
    in the left-hand column, you can read \u201CHommage \xE0 l\u2019homme\u201D with
    only Hommage capitalized. Of course Lalique needs to be capitalized. For me, in
    French,  that would be either \u201CLalique \u2013 Hommage \xE0 l\u2019homme\u201D
    or \u201CHommage \xE0 l\u2019homme de Lalique\u201D. The rules for French capitalization
    can be found on Wikipedia <a href=\"http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_des_majuscules_en_fran%C3%A7ais\">Usage
    des majuscules en fran\xE7ais</a>. Some are rather involved.\r\n\r\nIf it were
    to be in an English context, then I would do like Dan said."

    sense we have it in English. One can see evidence of this in how people posting
    songs to YouTube treat their titles.\r\n\r\nNot having title case, of course,
    is useful in an international context because it's hard to recognize definite
    and indefinite articles, never mind prepositions, in every language under the
    Sun."

  body: "For French, if you follow the \"traditional rules\",  you need to know your
    adjective and your adverbs because if they occur before the first noun, they are
    to be capitalized. Examples from the Wiki link above\r\n\r\nLe Grand Meaulnes\r\nLes
    Tr\xE8s Riches Heures du duc de Berry\r\nLes Cinq Derni\xE8res Minutes\r\n\r\nbut\r\n\r\nLes
    Liaisons dangereuses\r\n\r\nbecause the adjective is after, not before the first
    noun.\r\n"
