  body: I don&#39;t suppose anyone knows where to get a &#34;free&#34; version of
    Busorama? It can&#39;t be the ITC version, because the S is different. If this

  body: Yeah, it is the URW one &#40;I didn&#39;t bother checking the character map
    for the &#39;S&#39;, mea culpa&#41;. <BR>Don&#39;t think there is a free version,
    unless it&#39;s a cheap knockoff..

  body: BJ and Adriano, don&#39;t you agree stretching or squooshing type is just
    plain ugly. It creates stresses on letterforms that the original designer never
    intended. SUNBREAKER is just plain ugly. Dan

  body: I second that. <BR>Some faces even survive some squeezing and/or expanding
    gracefully. This one doesn&#39;t.

  body: Dean -  <BR>There is a freeware version of this.  Unfortunately, it&#39;s
    not bold and a few of the letters are different &#40;the &#34;H&#34; is especially
    obnoxious&#41;, but you get what you pay for! <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>  <BR> <BR>Personally, I would splurge on the URW version.  The
    freeware version doesn&#39;t flow as nice and looks like a cheap knockoff, but
    it may work for you since you only need a few of the characters.   <BR> <BR>Do
    a Google search on &#34;A. Carr&#34; and Busorama and you should find it.  Good
    luck! <BR>
