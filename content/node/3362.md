body: I&#39;ve been having problems generating fonts and then embedding them in illustrator/pdf
  files.  <BR> <BR>The problem happens after I generate a new font &#40;ttf&#41; from
  fontographer and install it in windows 2000. <BR> <BR>When I go to save the Adobe
  Illustrator file, I get a &#34;protected fonts cannot be embedded&#34; error. Anyone
  know what is causing this? It&#39;s driving me nuts.

  body: ttf files contain a header which specifies if the font is allowed to be embedded
    or not. I&#39;m not familiar with fontographer but I&#39;m sure there&#39;s an
    option somewhere to disable that flag. <BR>

  body: 'Fontographer by default sets the fsType embedding setting to gibberish. Since
    it hasn&#39;t had so much as a bug fix in about 7 years, Macromedia has not corrected
    this. &#60;grumble&#62; <BR> <BR>Solution 1: use a real font tool. As in, almost
    anything other than Fontographer. <BR> <BR>Solution 2: Visit Macromedia&#39;s
    web site. They have some tech notes on how to set the fsType. In at least the
    Mac version of Fontographer it&#39;s a bit of a hack. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T

  body: I think you will find this type of support for most EVERY Macromedia product.
    Dont even GET me started on the phone support. I used to own stock, after my first
    attempt at gaining phone support, I soon sold it all. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: As Tom notes...  <BR> <BR>&#62;This program will quickly and automatically
    set the font to &#39;installable embedding allowed&#39;, the least restrictive
    setting.  <BR> <BR>Which may not be very good if you plan to pass your fonts on.
    So he adds...  <BR> <BR>&#62;You can use Microsoft&#39;s editor to make it a more
    restrictive value, or change it in the source code, if you really require a different
    embedding level.  <BR> <BR>He&#39;s talking about this tool... <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/property/fpedit.htm"

    <BR>You might want to try it before using Tom&#39;s tool, as depending on your
    FOG settings you might not need to use both. <BR> <BR>Cheers, Si <BR> <BR>

  body: Via macromedia&#39;s site, I learned that you have to edit the OS/2 Data&#39;s
    fsType embedding to be  $0004 Read / Write. Then you can edit the properties with
    the Microsoft TT Font properties editor. Pretty messy.  <BR> <BR>As soon as I
    can afford fontlab, I&#39;m jumping ship as fast as possible.
