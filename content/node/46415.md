  big fat D I recieved in high school art class in the 60's. Just playing around with
  and old version of CorelDraw someone gave me. I have no aspirations to be a font
  designer, just create passable characters I use in spoofs on NFL team logos. I have
  a hard enough time faking your discipline as it is.\r\n\r\n I need help with complimentry
  font pairing. All I had to go on was the 5 letters from the Kansas City CHIEFS.
  I was guessing that the CHIEFS logo font was derived from Futura XBlkIt BT, with
  some mods to the C and S, with a slight widening of the first vertical component,
  and and tweak to the slant.   I tried to use this for KANSAS CITY, and other variations,
  but it looks like squat.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalparodyleague/sets/72157605543312769/show/\r\n\r\nSame
  is true for the Lions\r\n\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalparodyleague/sets/72157605543245409/show/\r\n\r\nPlease
  bear in mind I do not have a massive font library.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n\r\n  "
