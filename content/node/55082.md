  on the Tiro site. TWO weights of a new Fraktur, TWO new script weights, a double-struck
  weight with a black weight left over when the incisions are removed... remarkable
  stuff.\r\n\r\nOh yeah, and two weights of a Cambria Sans as well, plus their italics.
  I would be surprised if they stop here and don't expand it further in the future."

  body: "Yes, great link! Thank you, John.\r\nIs there a clever way to access all
    these characters? I mean, other than via the glyph palette? \r\n\r\nThe \u2018new
    Fraktur\u2019 is actually a variation on Wittenberger. \u201CBased on Schelter
    & Giesecke\u2019s School Fraktur which was in turn based on type favored by early
    16th century printers in Wittenberg\u201D \u2014 <a href=\"http://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&event=displayFontPackage&code=1495\">Adobe</a>.\r\nEspecially
    the uppercase \u2018K\u2019 has been altered \u2013 I assume to distinguish it
    more from the \u2018R\u2019. While I\u2019m not a fan of the original Wittenberger
    \u2018K\u2019 either, I must say that the new \u2018K\u2019 is my least favourite
    character in Cambria\u2019s blackletter. Its head looks stretched.\r\n\r\nThe
    script letters are absolutely lovely! I wonder what their source is. Similar charm
    as that of <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=kursivschrift\">Kursivschrift</a>
    or <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/brassfonts/fiona-script/\">Fiona</a>.\r\n\r\nIt
    seems Cambria is the new Lucida, in terms of style variety \u2013 and all in one
    single font."

  body: "Most of the mathalphanumeric characters were designed by Cambria's original
    designer, Jelle Bosma at Monotype. The 'ssty' optically adjusted scaleable variants
    used by the MS math handler for super- and subscript variants were made by Ross
    Mills at Tiro, as were the new math monospace letters that will be included in
    the new Windows 7 version (along with a lot of other non-math stuff that I made,
    with some help from David Brezina, including polytonic Greek and massively extended
    Latin and Cyrillic support).\r\n\r\nThe thing to note about the math alphanumerics
    is that they are limited character sets, generally no more than A-Z and a-z. They
    are encoded using Unicode Plane 1 codepoints for math alphanumerics, and they
    are also spaced more for use as math symbols than for regular text."
