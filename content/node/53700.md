body: "I'm having this problem with the vertical metrics of my Print Clearly font
  on my Mac (OS X). The vertical metrics for Print Clearly and Print Dashed are extremely
  tall. This happens with the font preview, font book and TextEdit. The fonts match
  exactly as they should in Photoshop. Here's a screen grab:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/verticalsmac_4851.jpg]\r\n\r\nI've
  checked all the vertical metrics, looked for glyphs that might cause the problem,
  in fontlab and see nothing that would cause this problem. I'm perplexed."

  body: "Ascender has some good info about this on their support FAQ:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ascendercorp.com/support/#cache\r\n\r\nI
    use the FontExplorer X, which has a utility built in for clearing font caches.
    \r\n\r\nI actually try to avoid clearing font caches as much as I can since it
    requires a restart every time. When I have a font under development, I change
    the font name with each new version I want to test. This sidesteps the cache issue
    since the system sees different names and assumes they are different fonts (which,
    if you think about it, they are). "

  body: "I've seen both extra vertical space and negative vertical space (lines squish
    together or display as half height) in fonts generated by FontLab where the ascender
    is lower than the cap height.\r\n\r\nThe way I see it, if the ascenderr line is
    lower than the cap height, the ascender line really serves no purpose, other than
    as a guide while editing/creating a font. Once you're done with the font you can
    ignore the actual ascender height and set the line a couple of em spaces higher
    than the cap height and that seems to usually fix the problem you're seeing.\r\n\r\nAt
    least that's been my experience."

  body: I solved the problem. The Aring was sticking over the ascender line about
    20 points. I'm still not sure why that happened. Shouldn't it be ok to have the
    accents above the ascender line?

    of course, where should they else be? :)\r\n\r\nYou have to take a look at ALL
    your vertical metrics, if you do as Adam suggests, you'll get good help."
