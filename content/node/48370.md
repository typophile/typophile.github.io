  Garcia</a> and <a href=http://starkadamdesign.com/>Pegie Stark Adam</a> on redesigning
  the <a href=http://www.yaledailynews.com/><em>Yale Daily News</em></a>, Yale University's
  daily newspaper, and Mario has very graciously posted a few of my thoughts from
  time to time on <a href=http://www.garciamedia.com/blog>his fantastic, revamped
  blog</a>. Recently, he wrote an entry, <a href=http://www.garciamedia.com/blog/articles/text_type_here_are_five_that_work_for_me_all_the_time>\"Text
  type: here are five that work for me all the time</a>, picking Miller Daily, Poynter
  Oldstyle Text, Chronicle Text, Mercury Text, and Quiosco as his favorite news faces.
  Being an incorrigible typonerd, I decided to share three of my favorites with him
  as well. He posted my e-mail in <a href=http://www.garciamedia.com/blog/articles/students_design_newspaper_of_the_future_yes_it_is_printed>yesterday's
  post</a>, and I have excerpted it below:\r\n\r\n<strong>THE FOLLOW UP</strong>\r\n\r\nTHREE
  OTHER INTERESTING TEXT TYPE FONTS: THE REED REIBSTEIN CHOICES \r\n\r\nOur Yale University
  intern, Reed Reibstein, whose interest in typography has inspired my colleague Pegie
  Stark Adam and me as we work on a rethinking of the Yale Daily News this summer,
  had these contributions to make concerning choices for text type\u2014the subject
  of previous postings of TheMarioBlog. \r\n\r\nAfter reading your recent post on
  the five text types that always work for you, I thought I would send you three of
  my favorites: \r\n\r\n1) Globe and Mail Text: http://www.shinntype.com/globetext.html
  \r\n\r\nThe text member of Nick Shinn\u2019s typographic suite for the new Globe
  and Mail looks like it was plucked from a beautifully set novel, not made for the
  harshness of newsprint. It has the short descenders and high x-height useful for
  newspaper columns, but its slight calligraphic flair makes the experience of reading
  it quite unusual for the setting. \r\n\r\n2) Eudald News: http://www.felicianotypefoundry.com/main/?page_id=88
  \r\n\r\nAn indirect member of the wave of Fleischmann revivals for publications
  (Hoefler & Frere-Jones\u2019 Mercury and Christian Schwartz\u2019s Farnham among
  them), it is the most rococo, with odd but not offputting \u201Czigzag\u201D terminals
  evident in the \u201CE\u201D and long tails in the italic. Mario Feliciano has imparted
  a powerful fullness to its letters that makes them burst confidently from the page,
  giving it a style largely unfettered by the traditions of newspaper type. \r\n\r\n3)
  Greta Text: http://www.typotheque.com/fonts/greta_text/ \r\n\r\nPeter Bil\u2019ak
  might have created Greta to work especially well for setting languages with lots
  of diacritics, but it functions beautifully no matter the tongue. It looks wider
  than many newspaper types, yet was made with economy in mind; overall, it is a gorgeous,
  entirely modern typeface that livens any page it graces. \r\n\r\n[<em>Had it not
  taken me so long to write these three blurbs, I would have added a few more of my
  favorites: Dino dos Santos' <a href=http://dstype.com/leitura_news.html>Leitura
  News</a> and Christian Schwartz's <a href=http://christianschwartz.com/houston.shtml>Houston
  Text</a> and <a href=http://christianschwartz.com/gdntegyp.shtml>Guardian Text Egyptian</a>.
  I am also really hoping that Kent Lew decides to continue and finish the \"cut and
  then curved\" typeface he gave a peek of on <a href=http://www.typophile.com/node/41687>this
  thread</a>.</em>]"
