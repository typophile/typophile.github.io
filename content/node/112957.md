  in their \"Educational Cartoon\" series.  It ran from April-December 1910 (but not
  September and October).  \r\n\r\nIn the attached, I am only interested in identifying
  the font/s that are located above the horizontal line.\r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance![img:sites/default/files/old-images/1910_August_Educational

  body: "Don't know if THE ETUDE EDUCATIONAL CARTOONS has been digitized. It has some
    similarities to Cheltenham, a font that was popular in the era. Compare with ITC
    Cheltenham Std Book http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/cheltenham/\r\nThe most noticeable
    difference is the bottom terminal on C.\r\nDon"

  body: "THE ETUDE is probably not digitized. There is a thick and thin font from
    the era, Globe Gothic, that approximates the letter-forms. The closest digital
    version is LTC Globe Gothic Bold http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/lanston/ltc-globe-gothic/\r\nUnlike
    other digital versions of Globe Gothic, the LTC font already has some of the mini
    serifs shown in the image. With some editing it could serve as a fairly good substitute.\r\ndon"

    in a font then known as Scotch Roman. A good digital version in Nick Shinn's Scotch

  body: "You're welcome Keith. The illustrations are fascinating as a style of humor
    long gone from our media -- sort of  a dour and world weary view of life combined
    with a willingness by the reader to accept long rambling commentary; no ten word
    factoids here! I trust you will have a lot to say about them.\r\nDon"
