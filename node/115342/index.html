<p>The two easiest approaches:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use a font editor to modify the affected glyphs (&lsquo;N&rsquo; and accented &lsquo;N&rsquo;s) or</li>
<li>use the TTF files instead of the OTFs. TTF is less sensitive to this phenomenon.</li>
</ol>
<p>I, being me, took the hard way. I dumped it to FontForge&rsquo;s SFD format and hand-hacked that.</p>

You should use the TTF, since that is the official &ldquo;released&rdquo; version where the contours are merged and does not have any overlaps. The OTF files included in the &ldquo;src&rdquo; folder are part of the &ldquo;source files&rdquo;, and thus not merged in order to make future edits easier.</p>
<p>The Google Fonts version does not have this bug. I guess you are using the FontSquirrel version, for some reason they are giving you the source OTF instead of the final TTF.</p>
<p>FWIW, the Times New Roman that comes with the Mac also have a similar problem in /Hbar

<blockquote>
Nicolás Silva is an award-winning graphic and typeface designer based in Monterey, California. He has received national and international recognition for his work, including a Bronze Cannes Lion for his collaboration on the graphic production of a campaign directed by JWT Buenos Aires.
<p>Nicolás graduated with honors from the University of the Andes in Venezuela with a BA in graphic design. Later, he received a postgraduate certificate in typeface design from the University of Buenos Aires in Argentina. For his final project, he created the font Poly, which was selected for display at the Ibero American Design Biennale and listed as one of the Behance Most Appreciated Projects of 2012.</p>
</blockquote>
And from the font itself
<blockquote>
Poly is a medium contrast condensed serif font. However unlike many serif fonts, it has very short ascenders and a very high x hight. Poly is very efficient in small sizes. Thanks to its careful balance between the x height and the glyph width, it allows more economy and legibility than standard web serifs, even in small sizes. This font was originally designed to compose texts in agglutinative languages, which contain very long words. The goal was to develop a typeface that would tolerate cramped tracking and that would increase the number of letters that enter in a single line.

<p>And here&rsquo;s a question <em>I&rsquo;m</em> apparently having to re-ask: what other fonts has Nicolás Silva produced, in particular before Poly?</p>
<blockquote>should overlapping references always be unreferenced and merged?</blockquote>
<p>Yes; that&rsquo;s the only way to maximally reduce unpleasant surprises. Sort of how using an EM of 1000 for PS and 2048 for TT is <em>still</em> a Good Idea (barring force majeure).</p>
<p>Now, if it&rsquo;s a <em>production</em> file that&rsquo;s meant to be easy to modify: it must be made crystal clear that it&rsquo;s not supposed to be deployed as-is; and one would expect <em>all</em> glyphs with potential overlaps (like the &ldquo;M&rdquo;) to feature separated contours (otherwise it&rsquo;s probably just sloppiness).</p>

		<div class="commentbody">That sounds like some twisted reasoning to me: Based on a flaw that demonstrably also appears in commercial fonts, a free font is declared badly made. When it proves to be not so badly made, after all, its maker is accused of plagiarism instead—without any factual basis except for the fact that he has not released any crap in the past. Come on! Even in court, you are innocent until proven guilty. I am in favour of speaking out against plagiarism (which is rampant in free fonts, I know), but I am against random suspicion, just because something is better than many a commercial font. ‘Paranoia’ indeed seems to be the right term for that.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Oddly enough, we just bought Sirba last Friday to use for a customer, and I&rsquo;ve had a quick look. I assume the advocate of &ldquo;professionalism&rdquo; living in Southern California will pay me $50 for every flat-out error I&rsquo;ve found in the font? (I&rsquo;ve only checked the roman so far.)</p>
<p>Mis-coded characeters, that sort of thing? Or does a grave really run this way / when it is below a character, rather than, say, \ ???</p>
<p>And is the <strong>spacing modifier</strong> (aka raised comma or apostrophe) found at U+02BC really (1) small, like the comma accent, as one would expect at 0313, and (2) zero width? Esp. when there is no comma accent at 0313?</p>
<p>And shouldn&rsquo;t the combining diacritics all be zero width (regardless of where one places them in that setwidth)?</p>
<p>And o335-0336 should be positioned to work as Unicode intended, mid-plane (as well as needing to be zero width), regardless of how useful they may have been to the designer in constructing the font via scripts.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I think Sirba is gong to be a real nice typeface, and if it sets as well as like I think it will, I&rsquo;ll have no hesitation recommending it to other customers. Things happen, though. I know, because I&rsquo;ve done them too. It takes, perhaps, oddballs like me to &ldquo;finish the proofing.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve no doubt that when these are pointed out to the designer, they will either be fixed, or an explanation offered as to why they are correct, in spite of what someone might expect.</p>
<p>Best of all though, Hrant&rsquo;s going to owe me enough to offset the purchase price of the whole font family!</p>
<p>@R &ndash; You&rsquo;ve been around typophile long enough to know that Hrant, in spite of his numerous posts, has a smallish litany of advice for people, not always, but usually:  (1) What you want to do isn&rsquo;t legal. (2) If it is legal, it isn&rsquo;t morally right. (3) Even when it is legal (&amp; maybe morally acceptable), you don&rsquo;t have the skill. (4) if it&rsquo;s free, it&rsquo;s no good. All leading to (5) What&rsquo;s you budget?</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I understand your wish to err on the side of caution and, like you, I don’t want to use fonts that are re-using the work of others without their permission. But: being cautious about using or recommending fonts that give you a bad gut feeling is—to my mind—worlds apart from insinuating publicly that a font might be based on plagiarism. The latter, I think, is unfair and unwarranted unless you have fairly solid evidence. A general correlation between price and quality that you claim does not seem nearly enough to me. You might be aware of the saying ‘Audacter calumniare, semper aliquid haeret’ (Slander boldly, something always sticks). If you make (unfounded or poorly founded) accusations and these are eventually proven wrong, this can still result in damaging an honest type designer’s reputation. Why? Because somebody might misread your ‘trenchant questions’ as facts and wrongly associate an untarnished name with plagiarism. That’s not the way the world should be, but the list of careers that were ruined by false allegations is probably even longer than the list of free fonts based on plagiarism.</div>

It might be a desperate compensation for the fact that many people who harbor much more animosity towards plagiarism (really, among type designers I&rsquo;m a moderate in that respect) have simply given up on Typophile, at least in terms of promoting moral behavior. Which is a shame. Also, part of me hopes that I can simply raise a red flag and people who are better than me at nailing down the exact source of plagiarism can pick up the baton. But I have to admit that very rarely actually happens&hellip;</p>

It was designed by somebody I personally know, and actually like as a person. But within five minutes of looking at it I got a bad vibe&hellip; and then spotted –inconclusive– indications of plagiarism (the trapping across scripts was suspiciously inconsistent). The representative (an &ldquo;inspiration liberal&rdquo;, if you know what I mean) thought that wasn&rsquo;t enough grounds to reject it. Maybe he was right. But on a whim I looked at other fonts from that designer, and traced the path: the font in question was a &ldquo;some-serif&rdquo; based directly on the outlines of a previous sans typeface&hellip; owned by a rival font house. :-/ I opined that –even though it was the same designer– publishing the font would not be OK unless that other font house were aware, and approved.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for taking my point into consideration.</p>
<p>I agree that there must be ways to avoid unnecessary roadkill on the way to a better type design world without being on plagiarism patrol full time. If you encounter a typeface that you think is based on plagiarism, you could privately alert others to it and see if any of them can shed light on the matter. You could additionally approach the designers of suspicious typefaces themselves and see what they have to say in their defence. And: Is there any type design forum with restricted access that is not indexed by search engines? If so, that might be a place to discuss such cases. Typophile, I think, ranks fairly high on Google &amp; Co. and a thread on plagiarism is not what you want on the first page of results as a young type designer—particularly if you did not plagiarise. Also, I suggest to let go cases in which you cannot substantiate your instinct. I understand (and support) your inclination to name and shame actual offenders, but I think there is less to be gained from each copycat exposed than to be lost when rashly publishing allegations that have to be dismissed eventually (or, even worse, go unchallenged and keep on floating about).</p>

<p>Having a large x-height so as to be well suited to agglutinative languages (Basque?
