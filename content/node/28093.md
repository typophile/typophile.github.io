body: "I'm looking for some advice for dealing with a difficult client!\r\n\r\nThere's
  this dry brochure we're doing that contains tons and tons of text. In an effort
  to mix things up, we've done some funky titles, using the three or four words of
  the title at different sizes. These are short and very obvious titles. (I've attached
  one.)\r\n\r\nAnyway, one of staff for the client always cites \"legibility\" concerns
  (mostly when I think he really just doesn't like something). And in a presentation,
  I'm suddenly left facing a group of non-design-savvy people who respond, \"oh, do
  you think this will be legible?\"\r\n\r\nI guess I feel like any design suggestions
  I'm making are getting trumped by this legibility card.\r\n\r\n(In one example,
  the block of very bold text was crossed by a light grey hairline. It was incredibly
  clear what the text said, but there it was again -- \"do you think that line over
  the text makes it hard to read? Is it legible?\" Honestly...!)\r\n\r\nBasically,
  if the text isn't level, the same size, or being read directly from upper left to
  lower right, I can be certain that someone will cite \"legibility\" concerns. I'd
  rather not throw in the towel and just create a boring, conservative piece, because
  it's not right for the overall brand. Any suggestions on how I can counter-argue
  the legibility stonewall? \r\n\r\nI've considered pulling out my old David Carson
  books and saying \"No, THIS is hard to read. What I' doing is easy...\" Help!"

    solve it in another way - what else did you try? Can you show some \"dry textlayout\"

  body: "A better way of phrasing the question back is, \"Which words can't you read?\"
    The responsent will typically read the words aloud making it clear that he read
    them just fine. A better tact is showing them the bottom line advantage in better
    product recognition or some sales advantage that comes with your treatment of
    the text.\r\nThe truth is, you just may have a client who is too conservative
    for anything but the most basic design. Often times, it is not worth the extra
    time it takes to show numerous revisions to an unwilling client. Some people just
    like their Pizza plain.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "I don't think this is a 'legibility' issue, since the characters display
    at a large enough size to be legible and the colour, though muted, still offers
    good contrast with the page.\r\n\r\nI think this is a 'readability' issue, since
    the thought of the phrase is broken over four lines. But, still, I read it quite
    easily. I would even say *very* easily.\r\n\r\nAnd I further think your treatment
    offers a good counterpoint to a <em> dry brochure with tons and tons of text.</em>\r\n\r\n'Legibility\"
    IS a trump card, and if raised, needs to be addressed. In this case, I would second
    darrel's comment. \r\n\r\nAnd don't show Carson to your client. If they're having
    trouble with your design treatment, they'll freak over Carson."

    issue related to the design of his information you need to see it as a challenge
    to come back with something that answers both your desire to make the blah more
    interesting and make their test more readable. \r\n\r\nI wouldn't site any research.
    The client might become insulted. \r\n\r\nSo I guess I'm saying that you shouldn't

  body: In your example (spring shoes) my beef is that you emphasize BRAND over NEW
    - maybe that's what the client is objecting to. I'd think NEW should jump way
    out. If you're going to play with text in that manner I think you need to be mindful
    of which words need to get the most play.

  body: "I can see how someone might have concerns about this specific example, at
    least.  The placement of 'new' is ambiguous: when I first looked at it, I read
    it as 'new brand', and had to stop and wonder what it meant before I realised
    that I'd misread it.  So while it's clearly not <em>il</em>legible, there's certainly
    a sense in which it could be <em>more</em> legible.\r\n\r\nOne possible approach
    might be to use your funky titles decoratively while ensuring that there is also
    something less funky that conveys the same information. Then legibility ceases
    to be a valid concern at all."

    My experience is that it''s never easy to talk them out of their ideas (see this
    thread too: http://typophile.com/node/28056) but best to embrace the challenge
    of trying to make something attractive and effective within the limitations they
    impose.'

  body: "If you use hackneyed typefaces you will run into this kind of trouble. In
    order to put the stamp of creativity onto the work, you are obliged to come up
    with some fancy treatment - dropshadow being the most egregious, but here it's
    a Patrick Mitchell 1998 (Fast Company) thing -- this is where the designer adds
    value. An alternative would be to put the interest in a more discriminating choice
    of typeface (after all, there are 100,000 available) perhaps even, dare it be
    said, something contemporary? If Futura is the mandated corporate face, that's
    sad. It was, as Herr Renner noted, the typeface of his time. But perhaps 2007
    spring shoes are gonna be retro 1927...\r\n\r\n<em>sometimes for me,text that
    is a bit quirky to read makes it that much more interesting to try and read and
    in the end, it packs extra punch to leave an impression.</em>\r\n\r\nThat's a
    great argument. Legibility is more a text thing, but for heads, which are more
    left brain than right, you want to create just enough \"difficultas\" to catch
    the readers' attention, slow them down, and interest them in the content."

    I was thinking the same, throw some visual perception theory back at your clients.
    I'm sure there are some good examples you can show them, stuff that contains some
    little tiny imperfections that make the head so much more interesting and most
    importantly: it makes the text stay longer in your memory.\r\nIn any case: it's
    not worth crucifying yourself. I don't want to say that all clients are idiots
    and that they need to be educated and blah blah blah but once I went through a
    horrible crisis and felt really bad about myself because of a similar situation.
    I'm sure it happens to everyone."
