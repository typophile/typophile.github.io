  to use in my website.\r\n\r\nThe challenge is that I would like to create ligatures
  to ensure that entire phrases are replaced by glyphs.\r\n\r\nCould you guide me
  on which is the best tool for this purpose? I am new to this, and would love to
  have a tool that is intuitive. Paid options will also do.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "Hi Atif,\r\n\r\nHere's an example string in Arabic: \u0628\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647
    \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062D\u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062D\u064A\u0645\r\n\r\nI
    want to define my own ligature to replace the entire phrase above with a glyph
    that looks like this: \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bismillah_Hir_Rahman_Nir_Raheem_3742.svg.png]\r\n\r\nFor
    this, I want to know the best, intuitive tool for help. I already have a font
    with lots of glyphs, which means I will be using the existing glyphs for new ligatures
    in most cases. In some cases, I'll create my own glyphs from scratch.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "How many ligatures do you want to incorporate? You won't probably able to
    compose stylistic ligatures (as in the given example of BismiLlah) from simple
    glyphs. \r\n\r\nAny way the summary of the approach is to compose your ligatures
    in some font editing tool (e.g. FontLab). Then edit the font and add some OpenType
    rules through MS VOLT.  "

    is a suitable tool? It keeps crashing on my Windows 7 machine, so perhaps I could
    try another operating system. \r\n\r\nI checked out FontLab, but it turns out
    to more on the expensive side for me."

  body: Yes Fontlab and VOLT...why not try Linux or Mac for FontForge?  By the way
    what input key strokes are usual for the basmalah ligature?
