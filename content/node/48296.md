    Italic</a>, except for the weight.

  body: Thanks but this font doesn't seem to come in a heavier weight to match??  I
    doubt they just added a stroke.

  body: "I just purchased the Impressum Italic font.  It doesn't do it for me.  It's
    like I need the bold/italic version - which doesn't seem to exist.  Putting a
    stroke on the light/italic version does not get me the font I need.\r\n\r\nAny
    ideas??"

  body: "Unfortunately it has to be an exact match.  This is a logo someone created
    that I need to recreate.  It's odd because the logo actually consists of 2 words
    - Getaway and Restaurant.  The word Restaurant is an exact match for Impressum
    Medium. It looks like Impressum only comes in one weight (light) in italic.  I
    purchased the light/italic and tried to add a stroke and squish it but that is
    not what they have done.  It's like they used a bold/italic version to get the
    word Getaway.\r\n\r\nVery frustrating."
