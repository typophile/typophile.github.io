  I'm more of an illustrator than full bore type geek. We're not married to this one
  either, so anything similar such as a bold condensed weight would be appreciate
  as well.\r\n\r\nAs always, thanks!"

  body: "you can find many by searching with a keyword of \"western\" or even \"spur\".
    I did not locate this exact font, but if you only need the characters shown in
    the sample you might be able to recreate it with a basic font like Futura or Avant
    Garde and adding your own embellishments. one of the other regs may find the exact
    match for you.\r\n\r\nedit: some things to check out:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.losttype.com/font/?name=ranger\r\nhttp://www.losttype.com/font/?name=haymaker"
