body: Oh, right. When I heard everyone was supposed to get one, that sounded like
  a great benefit! It&#39;s a really lovely book. It&#39;s too bad not everyone got
  their copies when intended. <BR> <BR>I was disappointed when I found out that the
  Bukvaraz winners didn&#39;t get complimentary copies, though. That was really too
  bad.

    the <BR>conference, unless you were a winner <i>and</i> you showed up. I think.
    <BR> <BR>In any case, ATypI should be commended for publishing such a wonderful
    work. It&#39;s not a money-maker. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    work...  <BR>  <BR>I totally agree. Don&#39;t let me distract any of you from
    the quality of the book itself. My point was that I went expecting to get a book
    and the situation was, as Hrant says, complex and a little confusing and I was
    disappointed.  <BR>  <BR> But I realise now what I did gain - friends, confidence,
    knowledge, about 2 kilos - and that definitely outweighs the book &#40;heavy though
    it is&#41;. So I&#39;m a winner in the end. But that&#39;s not always immediately
    obvious.  <BR>  <BR>Matha  <BR>'

    attendees is off. Obviously it varies from year to year, but at the Rome conference,
    which he attended, there were only about 350 people. There was also a higher than
    usual number of freebies, reducing the overall revenue considerably. <BR> <BR>I
    don&#39;t completely disagree with Luc: ATypI does need to find ways to reduce

    attendees, a reasonable estimate based on previous years and the relative popularity
    of Rome as a destination. Only 350 people came to the conference, and a large
    number of those people did not pay. The organisers were left with a large number
    of books, and on the last day of the conference had to make a decision about what
    to do with them. It would have cost a lot of money to ship the books back to England,
    so it was decided to hand them out to the people still in attendance. I&#39;m
    sorry Matha and other presenters who would have liked one of these copies were
    not in the lobby at the time. As you can imagine, during the conference the organisers
    had rather a lot to deal with, without having to figure out how to dispose of
    a couple of hundred extra books, tracking down individuals who might have wanted
    one, etc.'

    <BR>It was a ridiculous solution to a problem which shouldn&#39;t even have existed.
    Someone &#40;the same someone?&#41; stated on the ATypI site that every delegate

    funds, it&#39;s absolutely shameful that the books weren&#39;t sold off at a reduced
    rate or, even better, autographed and auctioned off. I&#39;m sure plenty of people
    would have bought one at a discount if they&#39;d had the chance. <BR> <BR>If
    people find that giving them away/letting people run off with a whole box of them

    Choice: throw them away, ship them back to the UK at some expense, give them to
    whoever was around at the time. <BR> <BR>Last option doesn&#39;t sound so bad
    to me. <BR> <BR>Perhaps someone should have done something about this before the
    end of the conference - but probably no one had a concern about it until they
    were packing up and found a pile of books. <BR> <BR>Likewise, no one was concerned
    about there being less people around than had be forecast for catering - because
    it just meant more food. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s a shame that the people who transported
    the books to Rome didn&#39;t make provisions to take any &#34;overs&#34; away,
