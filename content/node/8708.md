  body: You must buy/license them from FontShop Australia. Yes, it sucks, I wish they
    had them at the US store too.

  body: These come up so very often on this forum it is kind of amazing that nobody&#39;s
    offering them for sale in the US.

    will be available very soon from FontShop. <BR>Give them a call at 1-800-FF-FONTS
    to get on the list.
