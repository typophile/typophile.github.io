  body: I think this looks very cool. Definitly usable.  <BR>In general I think the
    uppercase should follow the lowercase more when it is possible. <BR>I would make
    the bottom of the &#34;E&#34; like in &#34;C&#34;, to get it more fluent.  <BR>I
    would find another solution for the &#34;S&#34;, it looks a bit affected...  <BR>Try
    connecting the &#34;K&#34;. <BR>You could try something like in &#34;Z&#34; on
    the &#34;Y&#34;.  <BR>And maybe make the whole thing a bit bolder... <BR> <BR>Cheers!

  body: Thats right. Now the only thing i can think of to change is the tail of the
    Q, which doesnt fit the &#34;grid&#34;. Maybe it could be a horizontal stroke,
    not connected. Perhaps also stick to just one type of W and S in lower- and uppercase..
