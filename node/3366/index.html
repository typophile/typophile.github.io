<div class=commentbody>Dear Mr. anony, <br> <br>I've been particularly annoyed with this thread <br>and really didn't know how to react to it, which <br>is why it's taken me so long to post. <br> <br>Excuse me if this may sound harsh, but this is a <br>community of type designers, type users and -first <br>and foremost- type lovers, and to me your request <br>betrays a lack of respect for type. To create a <br>succesful type family takes talent, skill, and <br>countless hours, days, months, sometimes even <br>years of hard work. If I understand it correctly, <br>you're just looking for a free ticket, thus depriving <br>Mark van Bronkhorst from his livelyhood. <br><a href=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/16946.html target=_blank> This is not the first time this happens.</a> <br> <br>As Nicolai pointed out, do you really think that <br>someone who went through all that trouble would <br>make the fruit of his labour available for free, <br>just like that. How would you feel if you didn't <br>get paid for your work say the next three months <br>or so? <br>Any freeware or shareware font you're likely to <br>find on the internet will most probably have design <br>flaws, poor kerning, incomplete character sets, <br>maybe even technical defects. <br>I hope you'll consider purchasing fonts in the <br>future. The addage "you get what you pay for" is <br>very true of freeware and share fonts. If you want <br>quality type, you must be prepared to pay for it. <br> <br>And if you want to use share/freeware type: I have <br>absolutely no problems with that. But then at least <br>be honest about it and don't try to masquerade it <br>as genuine quality type. <br> <br>This is a very personal statement and does not in <br>any way represent an official viewpoint of Typophile.</div>

<div class=commentbody>OK ... some dissenting points. <br> <br>1) I certainly agree with the desire to have posters be honest about their <br>intentions. However, requiring every poster to show a respect for type is <br>just not realistic or even, IMO, reasonable. The vast majority of people out <br>there just don't know enough about typography to have respect for it. As a <br>result, we see plenty of posts from people who ignorantly believe that one <br>can get a freeware/shareware font comparable to Verdigris. It seems to me <br>that education would be more appropriate (and effective) than scolding. <br> <br>1a) This type of font request is, IMO, very different from those occasionally <br>seen on the MyFonts forum, where one poster actually stated, "I'm not going <br>to pay money for fonts!". That type of post goes well beyond ignorance and <br>reflects a relatively recent, largely generational attitude that it's not necessary <br>to pay for fonts, music, software, etc. Those people (and they're legion) <br>definitely need verbal spankings. <br> <br>2) Mr. van Bronkhorst's creations are truly splendid and he does indeed <br>deserve whatever price he asks. However, he rigidly offers his fonts as a <br>package only. Certainly there are many situations in which paying $159 <br>to obtain a single desired font is out of the question. I can think of two fairly <br>recent posts here by well respected mainstays of this forum asking for <br>alternatives in (I believe) similar situations. I can't find those posts just now, <br>but I remember them verbally "walking on eggshells" for fear of condemnation. <br> <br>In the case of the home hobbyist, noncommercial user or even small firm, <br>posters desiring a font they cannot reasonably afford have two choices: They <br>can ask that someone e-mail them the font (in which case they need a verbal <br>whacking) or they can seek a cheaper alternative. I see no reason why we <br>cannot help out the latter poster, educating them along the way. Fonts bundled <br>with applications (wihch the poster may even already have) can be a great option. <br>And most of those fonts supplied with MS apps (mostly Monotype) are of very <br>high quality. <br><br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Yves, I've softened up on the ignorant free type request person. I once got one of those types to post over here. I was hoping he'd get an education. After much education (beatings), he explained his situation. Married, child in a deadend job and a cheap boss. It made me think that there are lots of poor people out there that can't afford font licences. So I now just direct them to a site like DaFont and let them discover what going through a junk yard looking for a Mercedes is like. <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>OT, but: <br>Personally, I'd think twice before buying Verdigris...MvB's EULA is too restrictive for my tastes. Mind you, some of these restrictions seem to be relieved by the purchase of special licences, and I haven't investigated the cost of those.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Daniel, <br>I strongly disagree with the "junk yard" analogy, as that would infer <br>crappy near-uselessness of the merchandise. <br> <br>There are very many freeware/shareware fonts that are extremely <br>useful to a niche that I sometimes think the professional designers <br>and font makers here can not relate to at all (and sometimes, dare <br>I say, resent greatly). <br> <br>This niche doesn't in any way NEED top quality. And once they are <br>shown what their zero dollars will buy, I find that many of these <br>people are perfectly <a href=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/27621.html?1078316148 target=_blank> willing</a> to settle for "good enough". This occurs <br>regularly on the MyFonts forum. <br> <br>The fellow wanting to make a flyer for his local club is quite willing to <br>use the closest free font for his project. I submit that he shouldn't have <br>to phrase his request just so and show a respect for type in order to <br>post here. <br> <br>So, a better analogy, IMO, would be a car sales lot. The prospective <br>customer seeking a <i>much</i> cheaper alternative to that Mercedes <br>might be shown a Kia instead. If he accepts that the Kia is the best <br>he can afford and states that the Kia will meet his lowly needs just <br>fine, why should he denigrated? <br><br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I might as well put in my two cents here too, since this is an issue I am pretty opinionated about, like many of you who have commented earlier. <br> <br>I find myself most in agreement with Mike Freiman, although in the right circumstances I feel like Yves too. The difference is in the purpose or intent of the user, and unfortunately we are usually only able to take their word for it about those things. <br> <br>If someone is willing to take a near-match because they can't afford the real thing for the purpose at hand, or if they are just looking for something with certain similar qualities, I think we can refer them to places where that can be found. <br> <br>If they want to get the real fonts for free they can go somewhere else, and I think we ought to refer them to a special FAQ page about why that sort of question is improper, unethical and unfair (and whatever other terms Yves used above). <br> <br>My 'gray area' happens when the font they want is only available as a 'clone' version, as far as we know. I will usually recommend those fonts. The FontBank fonts are a good example, because I think often the font the posters are trying to duplicate came from that collection in the first place. <br> <br>I am all for education, and promotion of original, quality fonts. That's why I like to credit the designers -- so people realize this was someone's creative work. However, I realize, as Mike said, that there are situations when that expense can't be justified. Those are times when we should suggest alternatives, but I don't mean rip-offs of the same font. We should explain that if you aren't willing to pay for it, then you must be willing to settle for something else, but here are some things that might be similar that come with applications you may have, etc. I think it's a challenge, because most of us don't spend much time looking for cheap approximations, but if we have ideas for them, that would be the place for it. <br> <br>The last thing we need to try to be doing is guessing at their motives, because there is no assurance that they will tell us the truth. You either want the original,and will pay for it, or you are willing to take something similar that we might suggest.</div>

<div class=commentbody>On a somewhat different note, perhaps it would help educate the consumer if the font vendor would do comparisons more. For example with Vertigris, I would like to see a reason on the site why it is better than Minion or Adobe Garamond for some purposes. This doesn't have to be necessarily a head to head comparison, but leaving it all to the buyer to figure out is maybe not the best way. </div>

<div class=commentbody>The thing that ticked me off and made my remarks a tad <br>harsher than necessary is the fact that the people from <br>MVBfonts are so kind to support Typophile by putting an <br>advertisement on the site - yes that's their banner <br>promoting the very mvbVerdigris on the thread list of <br>the Type Identification Board. <br> <br>That being said, I agree with Mike and Mike on the <br>subject of freeware and shareware fonts, and I do have <br>quite a few of them sitting on my hard disk waiting to <br>be explored.
