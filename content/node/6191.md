body: Hi everybody, <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s something I made a few years ago, all in one
  night, just to see if I could do it.  Looks like some of the lines grew rounded
  caps when I converted this to a .swf, but you get the basic idea. <BR> <BR>I was
  thinking of trying out a sort of rounded hexagon theme for the lowercase letters,
  to make it more like blackletter. <BR> <BR>You can see it at <a href="http://www.oogby.com/oberto.swf"

    looking face.  I can imagine it almost as futura if it was written by monks...
