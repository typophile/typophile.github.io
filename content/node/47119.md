  body: "There are a few typefaces I would like for this mark...\r\nIf taking the
    serif route I think a Hoefler Text Roman is always a good choice.\r\n\r\nIf considering
    a san serif, Sudtipos makes some great faces to match the angularity of this mark.
    Mr. Giacco and Politica are great faces, check them out. \r\n\r\nhttp://sudtipos.com/fonts/36\r\nhttp://sudtipos.com/fonts/42\r\n\r\nThere
    is also an interesting serif from adobe called Belwe\r\n\r\nhttp://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&event=displayFont&code=BELQ10006000\r\n\r\nGood
    luck!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Yeah, second from the bottom is aesthetically pleasing for me. I would like
    to see the \"camel\" without strokes. I personally like the bottom version of
    the camel. Of course I don't know any background info on the logo, so I'm just
    judging on what I see.\r\n"

  body: Second from the bottom is best for me too but I'd nudge the type closer to
    the camel.
