  body: "Eli, to create a Hebrew grammar font, to use later in Volt, I would create
    a set of 22 extra glyphs. There are ten nikkud, and a dagesh.\r\n\r\nSo, if add
    two more for every one that is there now, 11 + 22 = 33.\r\n\r\nThey do not need
    Unicode values. Rather, they can simply be alternative glyphs for each nikkud
    Unicode value, and the dagesh Unicode value.\r\n\r\nIf they are placed in the
    FontLab file in the existing place of a font imported into Volt, adjustments to
    the total number of glyphs need not be made to the project in Volt, or to the
    FontLab file.\r\n\r\nIf they are placed in the FontLab file in the new locations
    of a font not yet imported into Volt, adjustments to the total number of glyphs
    need to be made to the project in Volt, and to the FontLab file.\r\n\r\nI suggest
    that the new graphic forms of the nikkud and dagesh symbols be intuitive. Their
    new form should be similar to their old forms. A kal version should be simply
    a hollowed version of the nikkud and dagesh; a chazak version should be simply
    an outlined version of the nikkud and dagesh.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the already
    familiar kamatz katan, it should remain the same in its Unicode value location,
    but have the above appearance in the other locations in the font.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,
    I created and placed in my fonts, graphic symbols for the shvah-na: a small floating
    asterisk used by Lubavitch/Kehos; a small floating rafe-like used by ArtScroll
    and others; I added the enboldened shva, used by many Sephardim; and the circled
    asterisk, used by Shai LiMorah publishers.\r\n\r\nBut this is only for publishing
    purposes. But the shvah-na should have the above cited appearance in the other
    locations in the font.\r\n\r\nI believe we do not need to create anything more
    in the FontLab files.\r\n\r\nGenerate a .ttf font, to use and edit in Volt.\r\n\r\n"

    Not a native symbol (people reconize the rafe for other use).\r\n2. with taamy

    will appear as a regular shvah. Each however will be hollowed for shvah-na, or
    outlined for shah-nach.\r\n\r\nThe other graphic symbols are only for printing
    purposes, as these publishers, Kehot, ArtScroll, Shai L'Morah, and others, are
    used to seeing these images. However, for Hebrew grammar purposes, the other images
    are to be used.\r\n\r\nAbout automating text with taamei mikra, this is addressed
    alreay in the furtive patach.\r\n\r\nAbout automating everything, the answer is
    yes.\r\n\r\nAt first everything. Later, some fonts will have them not automated
    by simply creating subsets of the Volt program."

    by going to the fourth Element menu from the left, to the fourth entry, Selection
    Info, and selecting Contour and Fill Properties, and turning off Fill, and clicking
    Stroke Outline with a 2 setting for the ems.\r\n\r\nI could create them as filled
    outlines by redrawing them.\r\n\r\nFor the outlined forms, I simply copy and pasted
    them upon themselves. Then, I picked the Element menu again, and the ninth entry
    Expand Stroke, and set the Pen Width to 40. Perhaps, it should be 60 or even higher."

    be defined as a Glyph Group by itself, and each chazak etc. nikkud and dagesh

    required to represent a mappik. I suggest this is a dagesh outlined with two circles.
    It must be defined as a Glyph Group by itself, too.\r\n\r\nVolt processes earlier
    GPOS look-ups, and afterwards Volt processes later GPOS look-ups. So, the sequence

    in Volt. \r\n\r\nThe 'program's are identical to each other, except thar one 'program'
    includes only GSUB look-ups which mark the shvah-na, and the kamatz-katan. This
    a general purpose 'program'; the results are Volt-generated fonts, in any design,
    intended to be used commercially by anyone; only the shvah-na, and the kamatz-katan,
    are displayed, and printed.\r\n\r\nThe second 'program' includes GSUB look-ups
    which mark every nikkud and dagesh. This NOT a general purpose 'program'; the
    results are Volt-generated fonts, in only certain designs, intended to be used
    educationally by achools (and perhaps publishers of educational books); every
    nikkud and dagesh, are displayed, and printed.\r\n\r\n===\r\n\r\nYou write that
    there are two opposing factors why this may not work:\r\n\r\n1. There are a large
    number of look-ups which will 'crash' the computer, as every nikkud and dagesh
    must be compiled for substitutions.\r\n\r\n2. Except for Hadasa, Hebrew letters
    are too narrow to avoid collisions.\r\n\r\nWhich it?\r\n\r\nIt seems that these
    are two separate issues.\r\n\r\nThe latter factor seems to an issue which can
    be addesed in planned out design. Hence, it is not an issue.\r\n\r\nThe former
    factor is not substantiated by you, as you can not cite this MicroSoft document.
    Furthermore, my two Volt experts suggest that there is no upward limit to processing

    \ 1) it's not used in any other typeface\r\n\r\nThis is why exactly that I am
    not introducing any new design. A hollow or not filled-in letter is the same design
    that a person is used to see. But now, it is merely hollow or not filled in.\r\n\r\n>
    \ 2) it will be impossible to print\r\n\r\nAt small types, like 12 pt and below,
    this is true for desktop printers. At larger sizes, like 14 pt and larger, this
    is possible. Try and see for yourself. Highlight some text in InDesign, and apply
    the Swatches to it in white (paper) near the top of its pop-up window. Then, go
    to swatches and select the text outline, apply the .5 or .75 pt.. Then, go back
    to Swatches, and apply black to the text outline. Now print and see.\r\n\r\n>
    \ 3) it's not intuitive as to what on earth it means\r\n\r\nI disagree. Let us
    not argue just for argument's sake.\r\n\r\nThe design is exactly the same, but
    hollows for pronouncing or intending differently, or outlined for pronouncing
    or intending differently.\r\n\r\n>  4) It could be useful in a book on Hebrew
    grammar with the specific words printed at 24pt, but for general purpose use,
    I'm not even sure the point of it.\r\n\r\nThe Volt fonts intended for ue by everyone
    are not radically new. The shvah-na and kamatz-katan have been printed in books
    for over a 100 years, and used by anyone who prays during that time with those
    books.\r\n\r\nThere are over 100,000 religious children today who pray daily.
    Most don't have an inkling how to pronounce differently a shvah-nach and a shvah-na.

    for many Jewish publishing houses in the States. People came to me for my expertise
    in certain in Hebrew/English typesetting. Whereas I had many requests for h dots,
    requests for the kamatz katan and shva na were far less. But when they were requested
    never were they so esoteric and I <em>never</em> had requests for dagesh chazak
    nor for the matter mileil (which is odd in my opinion). Further, I often typeset
    transliterated texts which was extremely interesting because it was clear to me
    that the publishers' Hebrew experts who did the transliteration didn't actually
    read Hebrew very well.\r\n\r\nWhen I did have requests, if there was an extra
    cost to the font development, (even to the tune of a few hundred dollars), suddenly
    it wasn't very necessary.\r\n\r\nI understand your mission with these fonts. The
    idea is great in principle. I doubt the ability to execute this, but putting this

    the font will fail at 2 cases.\r\nwithout teaamim with meteg, precision level
    gows down and with text with aout teaamim and meteg precision gows down a little
    more.\r\n\r\nThis does not include the fact that i tend to ignore any thing that
    is in debate.\r\n\r\ntherefore, the font uses 2 stylistic sets and the ability
    at the keyboard to correct these cases.\r\n\r\nnow, here is a basic fundimental
    logic that i decided from the start.\r\n\r\nA Normal qamats in a place that should
    be a qamats qatan is less of a mistake than a qamats qatan in a place where there
    should be a qamats gadol.\r\n\r\nA Normal Sheva in a place that should be a Sheva
    na is less of a mistake than a sheva na in a place where there should be a normal
    sheva (Nach).\r\n\r\nlet me explain a little more.\r\nQamats + Hataf Qamats (Like
    TzoHorayim)\r\nThe font uses qamats gadol.\r\n\r\nThe reason.\r\nAccording to
    the Ashkenazim its a qamats qatan(O), According to the Sefaradim it's a qamats
    gadol (A).\r\n\r\nSo the font does nothing;\r\n\r\nVolt you can never know what
    is SHEM TOAR or SHEM ETSEM and what is the SHORESH.\r\nIn volt you cant build
    a data base to lookup from.\r\n\r\n+ alot of decisions were simply made bt searching
    all the tanakh and determening wrather a certain check will result with the least
    mistakes.\r\n\r\nthen if the mistakes were'nt to many, i add them into a dictionary.\r\n\r\na
    lot of assumtions are made.\r\nlike he+qamats followed by Alef,He,Het,Ayin.\r\ni
    would assume that this qamats should realy be Patach, But because of TASHLUM DAGESH
    it became Qamats. So this qamats is gadol and not qatan.\r\n\r\nso if by checking
    this i resolve nost cases, and have a couple cases that fails in EYOV, So i do
    that, and either i ignore the mistakes or look them up in a dictionary.\r\n\r\nThen

    to the Sefaradim it's a qamats gadol (A).\r\n\r\nI diagree.\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\nThe
    function of a kamatz gadol and kamatz ketan is a grammar issue.\r\nSaying (O)
    or (A) is cultural pronunciation.\r\n\r\nFor example, \r\nthe first word of kiddush
    on riday night is the word in Hebrew for day, 'yom'.\r\nLitvish Jews (whose families
    came from Lithuania) pronounce this word as 'yaym', as if the cholam was not there,
    and instead a tzayrei appears under the aleph.\r\nBut nothing is really different.
    And the spelling and nikkud remain the same.\r\n\r\nIn the recital of kaddesh,
    many Jews (except Lubavitchers and Sephardim, who say, 'Amen') repeat the phrase,
    'may He be blessed', 'breech hu'.\r\n\r\nHungarian Jews, though, say 'breech hee',
    as if the vav (shuruk) was not there, and instead a chirik appears under the hei.\r\nBut
    nothing is really different. And the spelling and nikkud remain the same.\r\n\r\nRule:\r\n\r\nPronunciation
    is cultural, and does not affect the rules of Hebrew grammar.\r\nHebrew grammar
    is not affected by Ashkenazic or Sephardic customs or stlyes.\r\n"

    different types of dagesh.\r\n\r\nEach thing builds upon another.\r\n\r\nThe shvah-na
    and shvah-nach is after the kamatz-katan and kamatz-gadol. The latter is in turn

    the rules of the various kind of meteg. So, I can not place it in the scheme of

  body: "Oy, GoHebrew, you are missing such fundamental points of this argument that
    you are driving everybody nuts. Let me try and clarify. \r\n\r\nYes, you can probably
    create a font that puts in kamatz katan and shva na <em>according to Prof Dotan's
    view</em>.\r\n\r\nBut you <em>keep</em> missing the following point: NOT ALL TEXT
    FOLLOWS PROF DOTAN'S VIEW OF NIKUD.\r\n\r\nYou ask how is modern Hebrew grammar
    different from the grammar of Tanakh? BINGO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\r\n\r\nYES
    IT'S DIFFERENT. \r\n\r\nAnd the grammar of the Amoraim is different from the grammar
    of Modern Hebrew (by modern I mean the past few hundred years).\r\n\r\nAnd not
    only are they different, but in each period there are different opinions.\r\n\r\nYou
    got confused with \u05E6\u05D4\u05E8\u05D9\u05D9\u05DD, thinking we are talking
    about pronunciation. NO WE ARE NOT. The pronunciation of the kamatz katan is irrelevant
    to this conversation. We are talking about GRAMMAR. According to the Sepharadi
    view, their Masorah is that the first kamatz under the tzadi is a kamatz gadol
    and according to the Ashkenazi view it's a kamatz katan.\r\n\r\nNow Prof Dotan
    doesn't care about the Sepharadi masora because he knows that the masora is based
    on mistake that the Scholars of that time made (around 300 years ago) due to the
    information that they had. In his opinion, this is irrelevant and therefore not
    a problem. For him, it's a kamatz katan. Prof Dotan also doesn't care about a
    masorah that we have about pronouncing Hebrew in the siddur according to the time
    period of the Amoraim and Tanakh. He is a Prof of Modern Hebrew grammar. \r\n\r\nProf
    Dotan isn't wrong, it's just that you didn't ask him the right questions because
    your knowledge of the subject is too limited to even know to ask the questions.
    \r\n\r\nDoes that clarify things a little?"

    you say there are differences in Hebrew grammar in the current modern period,
    in Hebrew grammar in an earlier Amoraic period, perhaps also in Hebrew grammar
    in an even earlier Mishnaic period, and even a very early Biblical period.\r\n\r\nPlease
    show me some examples.\r\n\r\nWhen the Radak defined Hebrew grammar, which period
    was he referring to?\r\n\r\nIf Prof. Dotan was referring to Hebrew grammar in
    the current modern period, less the Sephardic masorah, why did Rabbi Rabin concur
    with his conclusion, as he is a Lubavitcher baal-koreh, reader of the Torah scroll
    on the Sabbath for the congregation, when speaking to another Lubavitcher (and

    worst scenario = text with plain nikud no teamim and no metegs.\r\n\r\nnow, when
    you say that there are absolut rules you are saying that typesetters are no longer
    needed, because the font can do it all, but that is absolutly not true.\r\nask
    any serious type setter like rephael freeman.\r\n\r\nyou see, that the font does
    its basic function on the worst scenario, then i can add functions in stylistic
    sets, so the user can define for the font what kind of text we are talking about.
    if its a text with teamim, meteg+nikud or nikud only, the i can make different
    assumptions. Likewise i can have different stylistic sets activating this way
    or the other different issues regarding the ashkenazi or sefaradi SHITOT to some
    degree.\r\n\r\nText with out MAKAFIM, I can never realy know (unless i use dictionaries)
    if the qamats before the last letter is a qatan, How will i know what is Be'Smichut
    and whats not???\r\n"
