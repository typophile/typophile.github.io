  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello everybody, this is my first contact and I would like to have your critique for a font i started to work on. I applied the characters on the clich&eacute;  phrase &#34;the brown fox...&#34; and to a logo &#40;the logo is fiction, just to try the types&#41;. For the moment i have designed just the lowercase, and in the future i will plus greek letters &#40;i am from Greece&#41;. <BR>I would appreciate it if you could give me your views plus I would be greatfull to receive some methodological informations on how to develop my work. <BR> <BR>thank you <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/your_image.gif" ALT="sample1.gif"> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/your_image.gif" ALT="logo.gif"></div>

		<div class="commentbody"> some good things are happening here. i like the descender on the &#39;h&#39;, but it feels heavy, perhaps angle/corner it such as &#39;f&#39; and &#39;k&#39;, but in the direction of the latter. does the &#39;e&#39; or &#39;z&#39; feel weird? hmmm </div>

		<div class="commentbody"> Thank you John for your notices, I overlooked on the letters you mentioned and i think you are right. So, i expanded a little bit the horizontal stems of &#34;e&#34; and I applied the diagonal cut edge on the descender of &#34;h&#34;. The problem is still with &#34;z&#34; and is called &#34;diagonal stem&#34;...you see in none of the types i used diagonal stems, so i tried to keep a vertical stem for &#34;z&#34;, too. To be honest, now that i used it i like it and i think it fits between the neighbooring types, but still there are no other angled stems around, so is this convinient? I tried also a &#34;z&#34; with descender, but maybe this is too strange and i want to know if it is legible to you, beyond any historical taboos...thanks again for your advices <BR> <BR>...i just read your notes Tanya, i will try them later. <BR> <BR>\image-&#40;sample2&#41; </div>
