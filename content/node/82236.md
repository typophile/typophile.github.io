body: "back again.\r\n\r\nI've reworked my font Radical and done the following\r\n\u2022
  Several improvements to spacing and kerning.\r\n\u2022 Most of the glyphs revised.\r\n\u2022
  Global reshape of inktraps.\r\n\u2022 Font name change, from Radical Display to
  Novecento.\r\n\u2022 Opentype Locl feature added for Polish: special acute accent
  kreska now available. To activate it, just select Polish as text language.\r\n\u2022
  Opentype SS02 feature added: stylistic alternate for /N/ glyph with all accented
  variants, included Polish kreska.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/demo_5855.jpg]\r\n\r\nYou're
  invited to download it and test it\r\nhttp://typography.synthview.com\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOf
  course every comment is much appreciated."

  body: "web-font are file formats made for html page embedding. You can put them
    on your server and attach them to your website with a css line.\r\n\r\nWhat do
    you mean with \"normal\" family? On download you have the wide only. \r\nI'm working
    on other widths but they're not available at the moment.\r\n"

    "Novecentowide-Normal")?
