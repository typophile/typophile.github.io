		<div class="commentbody">For Illustrator, I personally think you&rsquo;re better off experimenting &amp; using online tutorials or forums in case of any problems. Or -worst case scenario- you can always read the manual ;-)
For Photoshop you might want to buy a book if you really want to make full use of its capacities (but for basic things, the same goes for Photoshop as for Illustrator).
There&rsquo;s no better (or more fun) teacher than curiosity&hellip; mixed with a little stamina &amp; interest, that is.
If you&rsquo;re used to working in older versions of these programs, it&rsquo;s just of matter of staying up-to-date &amp; the Adobe-site features all the new stuff.
Good luck!</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I still prefer books with detailed indexes in combination with extensive use of colored pencils for underlining and marginal notes and comments, because this way it&rsquo;s possible to re-find special tricks even after some time has passed. So for InDesign I can recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321322029/sr=8-3/qid=1156286584/ref=sr_1_3/102-9381537-2953704?ie=UTF8">Real World Adobe InDesign CS2</a> by Olav Martin Kvern and David Blatner. 
Nice as well, e.g. as reminders, are <a href="http://www.senecadesign.com/designgeek/indesign.html">tips via email</a> now and then, the corresponding discussions are even more interesting. There is a link to an <a href="http://www.indesignsecrets.com/category/podcasts/">InDesign podcast</a> as well in case you like podcasts.</p>
<p>For beginners I&rsquo;d second the &ldquo;Classroom in a Book&rdquo; series mentioned above.</p>

<p>Freelanceren
I like what this site has to offer and I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s a great resource. But I just spent alot of cash buying Adobe CS2 legitimately instead of bootlegging it and I need additional cash to buy myself a decent font library. Perhaps someday when my budget permits it I&rsquo;ll buy a few videos.</p>
<p>Ill Sans
I agree wholeheartedly about self training through experimentation. It&rsquo;s how I learned Illustrator. But my photoshop is weak at best, and I have no expirience with Indesign whatsoever. I want to learn as much as possible in the quickest amount of time and i think a book or two will do the trick. At least with a book, I can alway take it with me and read thru it when I have the time (like on my lunch break at work. Heck, even during work while I&rsquo;m sitting on my desk.) What online forums do you suggest I visit?</p>
<p>Termopolium
I&rsquo;ve heard good things about the &ldquo;Classroom in a book&rdquo; series and it&rsquo;s one of my top choices. I will definately check out “Photoshop CS2 for digital photographers” by Colin Smith since I would like to learn more about retouching and perhaps get into digital photography. I agree 100% about the “Logo, font and lettering bible” by Leslie Cabarga that&rsquo;s why I bout a copy:)</p>
<p>Fisheye
Thank you so much for putting me on to this site! It&rsquo;s a great resource and the prices are very good. I&rsquo;m thinking about purchasing their &ldquo;InDesign Professional Typography&rdquo; DVD.</p>
<p>Bojev
You&rsquo;re right about not remembering everything which is why I&rsquo;d like to purchase a book. I&rsquo;ll checkout your suggestions.</p>
<p>Tina
I&rsquo;ve also heard good things about the &ldquo;Real world&rdquo; series. And I&rsquo;ve already bookmarked the Seneca design site. Great resource!</p>
<p>Gracias Todos!

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Mister M,</p>
<p>I use books and the web depending on the situation i&rsquo;m in.  The web is unbeatable if you troubleshooting a specific problem, but I find that books are nicer for conceptual, or instructional content.  Good books have excellent indexes, and personally I like printed pages as opposed to screen.</p>
<p>Not sure about the rest of the bundle, but Ben Willmore has published  <a href="
http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321321898/sr=1-3/qid=1156390619/ref=sr_1_3/002-6628514-3561600?ie=UTF8&s=books">Photoshop CS2 - studio techniques</a></p>
<p>I shopped around and read a stack of threads and reviews before I bought this one, and it really payed off.</p>
<p>It is honestly a fantastic book. Can&rsquo;t speak highly enough of it.  Ben is really good at making seemingly complicated topics seem easy.  He doesnt offer scores of pointless &lsquo;PS effects&rsquo; tutorials, but rather explains how each tool/technique works and put them into context to real applications.  It&rsquo;s deep too!  He covers a lot of ground.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I’m going to second Tina’s recommendation for “Real World Adobe InDesign CS2” by Kvern and Blatner. Blatner and Concepción’s podcasts are very informative, and they do answer e-mailed questions! Hands on training, although potentially expensive, is an option I’d seriously consider. The “Classroom in a Book” series, while well done, covers the basics and doesn’t go much further.</p>
<p>Also by the same group, try “Real World Adobe Photoshop CS2” by Fraser &amp; Blatner and “Real World Image Sharpening with Adobe Photoshop CS2” by Bruce Fraser. I’d also recommend reading “Real World Color Management, Second Edition” by Bruce Fraser, Chris Murphy, and Fred Bunting. Do check out Nigel French’s “InDesign Type: Professional Typography with Adobe InDesign CS2”, which addresses the core of print collateral, that being well set text.</p>
<p>Above all, have patience; this is a complex group of programs you are embarking on learning. It takes time to learn them at an expert level. —Bill Lomax</p>
