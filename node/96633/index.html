		<div class="commentbody">Skylar, like most artists you seem to be good at hallucinating. You have no idea what drives me. This isn't about intimidation or baiting - it's about dedication and persistence (which BTW are requirements for <em>designing</em> the type you clearly appreciate using).

Even though I don't like type-IDs* (especially these days when it's mostly a matter of siccing some dumb software on a heaping junkyard of pirated fonts**) my only motivation here was not sabotage, but correcting what I see as a misconception. I might be overzealous -or hopelessly romantic- in trying to educate people who might only be interested in a quickie ID of a font they'll never pay for but the idealist in me believes that <em>public</em> (see below) attempts at education (which goes both ways - I learn things here all the time) benefit society, or at least this society of type.

* The "point of this board"? If you mean Typophile, you're being ridiculous. If you mean the ID board, all I would say is it's a sad excuse for real typographic discussion (not to mention a piracy tool). The ID board should not and cannot exist in a vacuum outside of the Typophile umbrella. Why not? Because people like me -who are not here for mindless type IDs- will see you and possibly react.

** Contrast with the ones here:
http://typophile.com/node/96464#comment-522639

Look at your over-reaction to my simple question at the beginning, and realize that you messed up by insulted me for no good reason. I suspect you're anger with me had been building up for a while. Is that because I confront ID parasites who don't really value type?

And yes, whether as an artist you're successful or not is a moot point way beyond the fact that this is not remotely a blackletter.

<blockquote>I will ignore your antisocial posts</blockquote>

That's your call. Just know that this is not a cocktail party. That would be even stupider than thinking type IDs are the point of type. And I'll be waiting for contributions by you beyond mindless* type-IDs (but I'm not holding my breath because you haven't managed that once in over six years now).

* And often laughably desperate:
http://typophile.com/node/96641

<blockquote>If you want to discuss anything -- or take me to task on anything I've said -- feel free to email me through typophile.</blockquote>

Why does the thoughtful discussion you propose have to be done in private?

--

Tal, I think you're making too easy a connection; narrow + rigid does not equal blackletter, and one letter by itself (which isn't even conclusive) does not a font make. I would recommend reading "Blackletter: Type and National Identity" by Bain and Shaw for a good introduction to that most luscious of typestyles.

		<div class="commentbody">No, but what I do know (and I think most people agree, including possibly yourself) is that it's not rare for a designer to intend something in his work that simply doesn't come through to the people who really matter: viewers. And I think this is such a case, because it really does look more roman and blackletter to me (and being an long-time admirer of blackletter I've looked at it a good deal). Now, as often happens, I could be wrong. Could you?

		<div class="commentbody">I was pleasantly surprised, when gifted with a book by a friend, that Judith Schalansky included Brünnhilde in her Fraktur mon Amour (http://www.fraktur-mon-amour.de/de/). That Brünnhilde is blackletter doesn't come through? Whatever you say.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">As I said, I think the lc (which I admit is more significant in running text, especially for a style that -for good reason- is rarely used all-caps*) does qualify. I'll note though that the original query only showed the UC.

* And this is a clue that your UC isn't deeply blackletter.

As for "Fraktur mon Amour": wonderful book; but highly inclusive, wouldn't you say?

Anyway, I don't mean to pester you. I just like [talking about] type.
