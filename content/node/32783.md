  body: The article mentions that Danish Rail uses Helvetica. That is incorrect in
    more than one way. Danske Stats Baner 'DSB' never used Helvetica, but a typeface
    from British Rail called 'British Rail' or 'Rail Alphabet'. 'Rail Alphabet' is
    similar, but not identical, to a bold weight of Helvetica. In 1997(?) a new typeface
    was commissioned to the Danish design agency Kontrapunkt who created a new family
    called 'Via', heavily influenced by the works of earlier modernist Danish architects.
    'Via' is still used today and remains exclusive to DSB.

    be corrected? That Arial bit is just sooooo wrong.

    typophiles,\r\n\r\nOn May 22 at Braunschweig University of Art we will be showing
    the documentary film \u201CHelvetica\u201D, produced to mark its 50th anniversary.
    We would like to get a general idea of people\u2019s attitudes towards the typeface
    and present these findings before the screening.\r\n\r\nTo help us do this, I
    would be grateful if you would complete the questionnaire and send it back to
    me. Please forward it to anyone else you think may have an opinion on Helvetica.
    Please send your answers up to the 30th of April. I will also publish the findings
    on my website at a later date. \r\n\r\nThanks for your help,\r\nHelvetica-enthusiast,
    J\xF6rg\r\n\r\nHere is the questionnaire in text format:\r\n\r\n- When was the
    first time you became aware of Helvetica by name?\r\n- What do you think of Helvetica?
    \r\n- What is Helvetica\u2019s greatest strength?\r\n- What is Helvetica\u2019s
    greatest weakness?\r\n- If Helvetica didn\u2019t exist, which typeface could take
    its place? \r\n\r\nJ\xF6rg Petri\r\nHochschule f\xFCr Bildende K\xFCnste Braunschweig\r\nwissenschaftlich/k\xFCnstlerischer
