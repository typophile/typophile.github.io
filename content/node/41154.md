body: "I am in the middle of redesigning a magazine. I would like to use Lubalin as
  the main headline font, but can't quite decide on a suitable body text font to go
  with it. We are working with Lubalin & Akkurat as a combination at the moment, but
  Akkurat is quite limited, and ideally we'd use a body font that also has a condensed
  in it's family as there are a few sections that are rather text heavy (listings/reviews).\r\n\r\nIt
  is for a Drum & Bass magazine named K-mag (formerly known as 'Knowledge') http://www.kmag.co.uk/kndefault.asp,
  based in the UK, target audience mostly males 20-30, mostly city dwellers, interested
  in urban art and technology/gadgets.\r\n\r\nPreviously we use Foundry as headline
  and Akzidenz as a body text, but we want to move away from this a bit. \r\n\r\nAnyway,
  suggestions are most welcome!\r\nMany thanks\r\n\r\nMarije"
