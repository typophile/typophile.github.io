  I'm getting an ID (cheers!) does anyone know what the MyFonts logo is?:\r\n\r\nmyfonts.com\r\n\r\nIs
  that a bespoke jobby, or is it available as a typeface? Can anyone recommend anything
  similar?\r\n\r\nThis is my first post on here (though I've garnered plenty of useful
  bits and bobs through occasional visits as a passer-by), so many thanks for any
  help in advance. "
