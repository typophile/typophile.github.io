  body: I agree; I thought it was fantastic. It's great to see an article that goes
    beyond "Obama uses Gotham" to really delve into type design.

    He looks downright hot.\r\n\r\nMoney quote:\r\n<em>\u2018I'm interested in designing
    typefaces. Do you have any advice for me?' and he said, \u2018Don't bother. There's
    no money in it.'</em>\r\n\r\nDoes that mean that there\u2019s actually money to
    be had in graphic design?"

  body: And if anyone's at all interested, you can view a tiny thumbnail of the spread
    (looks like they tried some interesting type arrangements, but it's hard to tell)
    if you go to http://fairfaxmedia.newspaperdirect.com/epaper/viewer.aspx and under
    select title, choose Sunday Papers > Sunday Magazine, and then browse through
    the thumbnails. Unfortunately, a bigger view requires paid subscription.
