  body: "To my eye the type is a little heavy. I think you've set it up nicely though.
    The heads could be a tiny bit smaller, and I'd look at adding a point of space
    between your title (at each job) and the first bullet point. \r\n\r\nNot sure
    you need periods after the job titles and bullet points - they are not sentences
    after all.\r\n\r\nI'd make the hyphens under AWARDS into M-dashes for consistency.
    \r\n\r\nI like its simplicity, especially compared with some of the nonsense you
    see from students. "

    least pull it back to line up with your bullet points.\r\n\r\nThe bottom 3 columns
    of Course Work, Computer Skills and Personal Skills seems awkward. The spacing
    between them doesn't seem right.\r\n\r\nOn the second pass, I would agree with
    Patty that the type is heavy. You might want to consider using some ruled likes
    to break things up abit. \r\n\r\nIf you do use some lined rules, set the stroke
    to the mustard yellow used in your logo and then set your bullets with a fill
    of the same."

  body: "This does look very good. Just a few thoughts, really:\r\n\r\n- The section
    titles seem very large and create a heavy bold spot in the experience area as
    you have the Office name bold as well. Does this font have small caps? What if
    you  use all small caps and made it smaller with a little spacing?\r\n\r\n- I'd
    use the vertical space. Align the top and bottom margins.\r\n\r\n- I'd also make
    the left margin the large margin, not the right. Think of the recto page in a
    book, not the verso."

  body: "The last 'r' in 'designer & typographer' would ideally align better with
    the 'Y' at the end of your name. This would mean tightening it or making it a
    hair smaller. Probably it will look right visually with the right branch of the
    Y hanging a bit beyond the 'r' in typographer. \r\n\r\n(Do you know Dowdling's
    'Finer Points'?) \r\n\r\nAsvetic does put his finger on a weakness, whether his
    solutions or some other turn out to work best...\r\n"

    copy (excellent time management, under Personal skills). Which brings up - why
    have that category anyway? Totally unnecessary IMHO. That's the sort of thing
    references are for. I hate extra words on a resume, you can read my screed about
    it on that other resume thread where the guy spent like 10 pages telling us why
    we should hire him before we even got to the CV.\r\n\r\nIt's looking much improved.
    I agree your name is a tad large at the top, and also that the bold is a bit bold.

  body: "Here's my (rather blunt) 2 cents worth...\r\n\r\nI don't think there is enough
    areas of solid body text to warrant a secondary headline typeface. Maybe do them
    in the regular of the font you've used for \"DESIGNER & TYPOGRAPHER\".\r\n\r\nLose
    the m/n dashes. They're ugly and break the flow.\r\n\r\nThe spacing above and
    below the rules are both inconsistent.\r\n\r\nThe position and size of the whole
    'block' of text on the page seems a bit awkward and cramped.\r\n\r\nI think your
    logo and name should share a baseline.\r\n\r\nToo much space between the 3 columns
    at the bottom.\r\n\r\nI don't like the colour split in your name.\r\n\r\nNot too
    keen on the use of italics.\r\n\r\nThe text under 'Personal Skills' is higher
    than the other 2 columns.\r\n\r\nSorry to be presumptuous but I couldn't resist
    a bit of tweakage. See what you think :) ...\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DaveBaileyResume600px_5936.gif]"
