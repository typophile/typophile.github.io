  would love to know what professional font creators do to their fonts after they
  are through kerning them. Are there python scripts that I should run, for example,
  to check it for errors or something? What are the really final steps to really finishing
  a professionally created font, and to ensure quality?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

  body: One more thing though - python scripts - are there any really useful ones
    that I (practically a novice) should try using that would be beneficial to me
    in "mastering" (what does this term mean btw) or finalizing my font?
