  me... but I can't remember the name of this font. Is it an italic Garamond?, a version
  of Foundry Wilson? What??! It seems to be doing the rounds at the moment and is
  popping up everywhere...\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\nK\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2670483957_3d65e2e595_b_4711.jpg]\r\n\r\nor

    the best thing for all the cheapskates among us: One of them comes <a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2008/09/cs4_fonts.html\">
    bundled with Adobe CS</a>, the other <a href=\"http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1642\">with
    Mac OSX</a> (at least the Italic & Black Italic \u2013 albeit in the unwieldy
    dfont format)."
