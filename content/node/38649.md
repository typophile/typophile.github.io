  to Bliss, Syntax or Scala Sans. I would like something feminine and lively (and
  fat?). It's for an annual repport for a company dealing with food and restaurants\u2026\r\nAny
  idea?\r\n\r\nClaire"

    boss to buy it, and I'm afraid it's a too difficult task. But Sauna is a lovely
    tasty type indeed\u2026\r\n\r\nClaire"

  body: Without Claus' post, when I read your post in RSS the first typeface that
    came to mind was Sauna as well. So I think you have some convincing to do with
    your boss. Then again, Sauna (or any Underware type) is not very expensive, they
    are relatively cheap (seeing the quality of their fonts, and in comparison with
    other foundries).

    Sauna isn't expensive for what it is. But some people don't give creation its
    right value. \r\nThanks for your posts anyway, I'll try to propose Sauna anyway."

  body: I love Underware. I'm sort off waiting for a job for which I can use Sauna
    myself. I do own Dolly, which I use regularly. :)
