body: We had to make a logo in school for a company that&#39;s book-related &#40;publisher,
  ...&#41;.  <BR>We had to make sure that the logo consisted of a simple book-shape
  and that it could be printed in one color. I&#39;m not sure about the typography
  though... <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/26991.gif"

  body: Why didn&#39;t you take a look at a Deco looking face like Mark Simonson&#39;s
    Mostra. Its contempory but has the Deco feel and it has alternate characters.

  body: For what size is this version designed for? If it gets much smaller <BR>the
    type will have to be much larger. Remember that logos are <BR>most often printed
    smaller than one inch. If that logo appears <BR>on the binding of a book no one
    will see the text. <BR> <BR>I think the symbol is excellent and I actually think
    most sans <BR>typefaces will work well with it. Those with round terminals do
    <BR>fit very well with that image. Have a look at Fountain&#39;s <a href="http://www.fountain.nu/catalogue/imbisspackage.asp"

  body: Hi Kenny.  A nice and simple design. What would improve it? <BR>I think it
    is heavy in the top corners and bottom center. As you properly already know verticals
    and horizontals will not look the same even if the are exactly the same width,
    so optical adjustments would improve this. If this is to be used in print &#40;which
    i assume it is&#41; opening up corners for bleed conpensation would be a good
    idea. See .jpg for improvement suggestions.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/27111.jpg"

  body: Ole&#39;s right. <BR> <BR>BTW, I&#39;m thinking this is <i>screaming</i> for
    a &#34;d&#34; and &#34;b&#34; to be made into the facing pages. It&#39;s a shame
    the two letters aren&#39;t flipped - but see what you can do with that - it&#39;s
    a natural. Maybe the ascenders can be made into the spine of the book. <BR> <BR>The
    Helvetica/VAG Rounded though is great, especially if it&#39;s supposed to be a
    publisher of children&#39;s books. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    don&#39;t have to print it smaller than an inch, we just needed to make a booklogo,
    that&#39;s it. <BR>But I&#39;ll work it out, thx.
