  as a hobby. I know I have a long way to go before even thinking of standing in some
  of your shadows. Anyway, here is my latest creation: Trialgulor\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Triangulor-1_4471.png]\r\n\r\nI
  fully expect to be ripped to shreds here. Please, tell me whether this or any of
  my other fonts are total crap, and what could be done to fix them.\r\n\r\nThis one
  can be downloaded at <a href=\"http://www.1001fonts.com/font_details.html?font_id=3017\">1001fonts.com</a>.\r\nOthers
  are linked from my author profile there. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT: It occure to me this
  might be more appropriate in the \"experimental\" category rather than \"display\".
  Please correct me if I'm wrong."

    go into this post feeling as if you will be \"shot down in flames\", rather look
    upon the information given as being helpful in furthering your knowledge so that
    you can apply this to future works.\r\nThe people here, with very few exceptions,
    will give an honest opinion and advice/methods/knowledge to improve upon your
    characters. \r\n\r\nContrary to the view that some may get from the debate that
    can occur in some posts, it is all good... and contrary to my original statement
    regarding criticism I offer the following -\r\n\r\nPersonally I would offer the
    opinion that the upwards leg of the N could be straighter.  The 'J' seems to lean
    a bit too far, the lc 'w' and 'x' seem to be of a different style than the rest.
    Also suggest you try typing a few sentences in this, and you could find that the
    opposing lean on characters gives for an uncomfortable read. You seem to have
    an idea for a optical distance lean (backwards). This would work better (like
    in the cap O) if rather than lean, they reduced in thickness over the height of
    the characters, eliminating the lean but retaining the effect."

  body: "Oh I fully expected this font to be an uncomfortable read. It's a novelty
    font at best. I tried to constrain all the characters within the shape of the
    O, a rounded isoceles triangle, which obviously was impossible and I fudged that
    rule extensively. I see it as more useful for titles, signs, and logos, where
    it is only used for one or two words at a time. If someone wants to set a bible
    with it, that's great, but it's not my problem.\r\n\r\nI have made some better
    fonts. This is just my most recent one."

  body: "I would make a caps-only* version with an \"A-frame\" set like you [mostly]
    have now plus a \"V-frame\" set so a user could alternate** them and get a nice
    tight texture out of the font in addition to the sawtooth. That could be useful.
    Sometimes.\r\n\r\n* It's much harder to make lc work well in confined polygons.\r\n\r\n**
    And I'd put one set in the lc locations and the other in the UC locations for
    ease of typing/composition.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Ok, I came up with the alternating caps version as you suggested. The spacing
    still needs a lot of work, and some of the letters just don't really work in some
    instances of going up or down. I couldn't come up with a solution for \"X\" going
    either way, so they're the same.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TriangulorAlts-sample_4950.png]\r\n\r\nI'm
    really pretty happy with the lc in the regular version. I do agree the \"x\" is
    a little weird, but I couldn't quite think of another way to do it."

  body: Anybody have a suggestion on how to design the A-frame "v"? I don't think
    it's even possible. That solution I came up with looks like a swan/turd/erhlenmeyer
    flask. Might make a good pharmaceutical logo, but not a "v".

  body: I got a little catalog in the mail recentlyand found that my font bears a
    vague passing resemblance to both <a href="http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=fontsbyname&i=T>Tiki
    Wood and Trickhouse</a> by House Industries, but they tackle the problems I'm
    facing far differently than I have. If there is a name for this style, I guess
    you'd call it interlocking sawtooth. But my cap angles are inconsistent, and look
    better with the lc than with the alternating caps version.
