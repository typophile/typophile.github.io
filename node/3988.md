body: 'Hello, I am about to begin work on my first typeface. This will be a digitization
  of the letters that my grandfather drew on Christmas cards and the like. It&#39;s
  sort of a Bodoni-esque style filtered threw my grandpa&#39;s congenital hand tremor.
  <BR> <BR>The reason I am posting is this: I have enough experience in other things
  to know that there are usually important questions to ask one&#39;s self at the
  outset of a project like this. Having zero experience in making a typeface, I don&#39;t
  know that I&#39;m asking myself enough questions, or the right ones, or all of them.   <BR>
  <BR>My question for you is this: from your experience, what are the major and minor
  considerations for creating a typeface based on the sample posted below? <BR> <BR>Thank
  you very much, <BR> <BR>Alex G. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/32183.jpg"

  body: I think the main question to answer in such a design is how you will balance
    faithfulness to the original against typographic integrity. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: As I get further into this, I&#39;m understanding better what you meant by
    balancing faithfulness to the original and typographic integrity. I find myself
    making a lot of decisions. Right now I&#39;m looking for this balance as I sketch
    the forms of the caps in Illustrator.  <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s about as far as I&#39;ve
    gone. At this point I&#39;m interested in comments that could help make this useful.

    curvy letters might need some optical adjustments. <BR>For instance: the O'

  body: 'That&#39;s outstanding. <BR> <BR>Some suggestions: give the serifs a little
    more weight on some of the glyphs. For instance, your grandpa&#39;s N in Nation
    has very pronounced serifs. <BR> <BR>Also, and I know this is somewhere in the
    future, but I&#39;d love to see an italic version, such as he used in &#34;for
    a year.&#34; Good stuff!'

  body: I agree with John ... I do like the N is NATION more than the one in NASAL.
    I agree with Nicolai&#39;s comment about the O as well. The R in HONOR seems a
    little too droopy. The B might be a little narrow, or maybe the E is too wide?
    <BR> <BR>This is fun, reminds me of Didot. You might reference Didot on a few
    of these characters. I really d like the warmth of it, reminds me of old movie
    titles.

  body: You&#39;re right, this is very close to Didot. I&#39;d been looking at a version
    of Bodoni for guidance, but there were some differences between it and the character
    of my grandpa&#39;s letters that I had to work around. Didot is a much closer
    fit. <BR> <BR>And thanks for your comments. This is my first typographic effort,
    and it&#39;s more difficult than I expected. I feel encouraged. Ultimately I&#39;d
    like to do the italic, and also an outline version of the capitals.

  body: 'Well, I haven&#39;t given up yet. I do need some critical guidance though:
    I&#39;ve been trying to reconstruct the lower case using a combination of g&#39;pop
    style and didot. I&#39;m particularly concerned with the letters: a, e, and especially
    g.   <BR> <BR>The &#39;g&#39; is driving me nuts: sticking to the principle that
    this font is a version of didot as imagined by an 80-something retired architect
    with a hand tremor, I&#39;ve decided that a binocular &#39;g&#39; is not something
    he would have done. I&#39;ve also decided that using an uppercase &#39;g&#39;
    in the lowercase isn&#39;t something that I want to do. I think the best approach
    is to didonicize a cursive g, which is what I&#39;ve been trying to do with very
    little success.  Any suggestions would be very welcome. <BR> <BR>Another concern:  I
    read somewhere that having many anchor points in a font outline creates problems
    with computer printers, etc. Is this style a problem? Or is this a concern that
    belongs to several years back when things weren&#39;t quite as robust? <BR> <BR>Current
