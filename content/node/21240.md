  features are very distinctive ... it's like a 'semi-serif' ... so only half as much
  serifs than in a normal font, and then it has kind of a Peignot-rhythm going on
  in its line-widths. Could be custom-drawn but who would cook up something like in
  the context of creating a Logo? It must be based on a existing design."

  body: "I think you're on the right track by suggesting that this is an existing
    font that has been modified. It seems very likely that those serif wedges are
    added on, because they don't even match the strokes they are related to.\r\n\r\nThe
    only distinctive letters are the G and W, so if you can find an uneven sans that
    matches those two letters, you are about finished.\r\n\r\nI've been looking, and
    the closest so far in terms of those letters (with flattening) is Ocean Sans from
    Monotype. Most uneven sans faces I have seen have a G with no 'jaw', and/or a
    'chin' that starts at the baseline. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    would also make a pretty close starting point, with a bit of flattening/widening.\r\n\r\nI
    disagree, Tim, about Gill mostly because it is a monotone sans and would have
    to be completely re-drawn to be unevenly weighted like the sample. \r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: "\r\nI agree but still ... I guess it must be some display type ... could
    also be something found in a 70's Letraset Catalogue, some font obscure enough
    for not making it into a digitized version. The designers found it to be funky
    (which it is) and redrew the necessary characters from scan. Similar things happened
    with Letraset's 'Pinball' font ... I don't think it exists in a commercialised
    version, but it started popping up as a post 'Dot-Matrix' option, it looked less
    digitized (which was more of a 90's sensibility). It got used for Olafur Eliasson's
    Weather project at Tate Modern. We redrew a version for a book project. I just
    think this project followed similar lines.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture-3_3872.gif]"
