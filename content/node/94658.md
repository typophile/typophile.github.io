  on an existing typeface or just freestyled. I asked Mr. Lee himself and he said
  someone helped him make it about 30 years ago, and he had no idea about the typeface.
  Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Mr_4120.Lee-01.jpg]"

  body: "Like Mr. Lee's tailoring, this logo is strictly custom. The two <strong>e</strong>'s
    don't match, and the unicase <strong>r</strong> is too eccentric--a type designer
    wouldn't use such a distracting design for a character that occurs so often. \r\nIf
    the ink in your Rapidograph has dried up, you could recreate this by starting
    with something like Poster Bodoni, and making numerous modifications. "
