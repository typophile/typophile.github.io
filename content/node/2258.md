  do you not like about it? <BR> <BR>What would you change? <BR> <BR>HateTheHate is
  a personal project that I have been kicking around my head now for about a year
  and a half. <BR> <BR>What I intend it to be is a website &#40;hatethehate.org&#41;
  that will be on ongoing image series of anti hate group propaganda submitted by
  designers. <BR> <BR>The idea behind it is that it is a hate group targeted at hate
  groups. So for the design I wanted something that looked deep south white trash
  hate group design. <BR> <BR>One of my friends suggested that hate and hating hate
  were different in that one the end result is bad and the other is good. I am not
  sure how this translants into design so if you have any ideas let me know. <BR>

  body: Hi Ben <BR>I like the idea of the Victorian type -- it looks kind of like
    a tattoo --not sure if you were consciously trying for that, but it&#39;s an interesting
    direction. It seems like everything I see in magazines about hate groups, skinheads,
    etc. always has some version of distressed heavy manual typewriter type, so it&#39;s
    nice that you avoided that. <BR> <BR>I think the style of the type is good / appropriate
    but I feel like the type needs to be bolder and stronger -- it seems a little
    too delicate / feminine now.  <BR> <BR>Since you already have a vaguely tattoo
    look happening, what about drawing the type by hand &#40;in the same basic style&#41;
    so that it&#39;s obviously hand-drawn?  <BR> <BR>I really like the swirly barbed
    wire -- you have to look twice to figure out what it is... that&#39;s nice. <BR>
    <BR>Good luck! <BR> <BR>

    respectable designs for a universal design community &#40;this is what you want,
    no?&#41;. If you go with a circumfrance of type, then be very articulate with
    the type selection and try to keep the type very small in relation to the icon/mark.
    It should appear as a thin solid ring, rather than a spacious airy circle of type.
    Add more verbage &#40;i.e. descriptors, locations, dates, whatever&#41;, if necessary
    to fill the space. It&#39;s looking quite nice'

    tactic of bigots is to claim they are being discriminated against. When you ask
    them to behave themselves, they say you&#39;re being intolerant of their intolerance
    and cry &#34;hypocrite!&#34; What we see here is a mockery of that fallacy, disarming
    its effectiveness and outright <i>daring</i> fools to level the accusation seriously
    and make themselves look all the more foolish. I applaud the idea, and I think

    of other hate logos but still original. The ones that look more heavily derivative
    of the nazi flag are not distinctive enough, and people might get the impression
    that you actually are nazis, not nazi-haters.

  body: I think your idea for an organization of designers against hate is a wonderful
    idea. However, this name for your organization is a terrible mistake. Let me explain
    why.  <BR> <BR>It shows a misunderstanding of the psychology of hate, and will
    be counter-productive. <BR> <BR>Psychologist Alfred Adler pointed out that the
    first step to anti-social behavior is to divide &#39;us&#39; and &#39;them&#39;.
    The next step is that &#39;they&#39; are less than human and it is ok to hate
    them and use violence against them. <BR> <BR>Recently psychologist Steven Stosney
    - <a href="http://compassionpower.com" target="_blank">http://compassionpower.com</a>
    - who has been one of the most successful in treating wife beaters and road rage,
    has pointed out that compassion and anger are opposites - and anger is a key component
    of hatred. Hatred and the accompanying anger impair a person&#39;s thinking, so
    that they no longer think in terms of problem-solving, but only us vs them, and
    whether to attack, defend, or withdraw. Compassion motivates you to understand
    the other person and act appropriately. When you understand the other person you
    can act much more effectively, whether it is to cooperate or oppose them.  <BR>
    <BR>This is why &#39;hate the hate&#39; is a terrible idea. It falls into the
    trap of perpetuating the stupidity that hate causes, instead of providing the
    understanding that leads to its cure. <BR> <BR>Ecclesiastes said there is a &#39;time
    for love and a time for hate&#39;, and I do think that hatred is functional physical
    self defence. It blocks the compassion that would make you hesitate to harm the
    other person, and as a resulkt you may be killed yourself. Aside from battle,
    I see no benefit in real hate. <BR> <BR>Hrant&#39;s views on this matter are in
    my opinion completely wrong, and would lead to a much worse world.  <BR> <BR>I
    think that your chances of being effective will be greatly if you contact and
    accept guidance from existing organizations fighting hate groups, such as the
    Southern Poverty Law Center - <a href="http://www.tolerance.org/" target="_blank">http://www.tolerance.org/</a>
    - and the Anti-Defamation League - <a href="http://www.adl.org/adl.asp" target="_blank">http://www.adl.org/adl.asp</a>
    . <BR> <BR>These have long experience in fighting hate groups, and have had notable
    successes. I am not saying you should simply be a wing of one of these, but you
    should certainly talk to them and get benefit of their experience before going
    forward.  <BR> <BR>By the way, note the logo for Tolerance.org - not great but
    not bad. <BR>

    The one where the two H&#39;s are <BR>sharing a stem. What if that center stem

    a first&#41;. <BR> <BR>The trap is to make hate an Evil thing. It is human. By
    coming to grips with it, we can control it, and make those whose hate is out of
    control more human, like us. In this way of showing compassion to them, we have
    a better chance of converting them to a &#34;control mode&#34;. So basically you&#39;re
    saying: I hate the fact that you&#39;re like that, and that makes us the same
    - but I&#39;m in control of myself - you can be too. <BR> <BR>Your view is entirely

    &#40;including me&#41; IMHO you&#39;d be better off just donating your time to

    other designers do the same, you can do it without this approach. Maybe I feel
    this way because I&#39;d be a little creeped out by joining an organization with

    that text say? Designers against hate? <BR> <BR>I feel like this mark could benefit
    from some more exploration into what makes it look like a fascist/supremacist
    symbol. This is an identity, so I could see the current symbols interacting with
    more contemporary typography &#40;as opposed to the expected circle badge&#41;.
    I think that this would more clearly portray the concept &#40;as I understand
    it&#41; and the body of people who will presumably fall in and support it. <BR>
    <BR>And support it they will, if it&#39;s done well. True hate is a terrible thing,
    and never ends well. People hating sin can be just as bad for humanity as people
    hating minorities. &#34;Hate the hate&#34; to me takes advantage of today&#39;s
    ironic culture. I say hate on a regular basis; &#34;I HATE it when they don&#39;t
    have Swiss cheese!&#34; I&#39;m not deeply angered and full of animosity towards
    the sub shop. In this case I feel like it can be a great call to action. I don&#39;t
    see the purpose of this as attacking groups of people violently, but reaching
    people in a way that both says &#34;hating is not acceptable by your peers&#34;
    and also &#34;here&#39;s what we can do.&#34;  <BR> <BR>I think assuming off the

    - unless the group of designers have better plans? <BR> <BR>Perhaps you want to
    describe your business plan here. I think describing your planned actions will
    help everyone understand what the point is and then we can critique the logo to

  body: I get the point that hate is a natural human emotion, but I don&#39;t find
    &#34;hate the hate&#34; a particularly interesting or productive concept. I&#39;m
    more with the buddha than I am with Hrant on this one. I think &#34;love the hate&#34;
    would be more interesting and Zen-like, and ultimately would produce better and
    more effective work.

- body: '&#60;font class=&#34;dontLookLikeCrap&#34;&#62;Both anger and hatred are
    Godly qualities. <BR> <BR>Paul writes: For what I am doing, I do not understand;
    for I am not practicing what I would like to do, but I am doing the very thing
    I hate. <BR> <BR>That is, he hates doing evil. <BR> <BR>And in Rev. 2: <BR>`Yet
    this you do have, that you hate the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.
    <BR> <BR>God speaking to one of the 7 churches, commending them for their &#39;hatred&#39;
    of wrongdoings. <BR> <BR>As for anger, Jesus was angry at the moneychangers he
    found in the temple. Rather than making it a house of prayer, it was turned into
    an arena for profit. <BR> <BR>As Hrant stated and as the Bible shows, it&#39;s
    a matter of how you deal with your hatred and anger. It is a righteous quality
    to hate what is evil. The key after that though, is to not take vengeance into
    your own hands, which is what most people do. Rather, &#34;be at peace with all
    men, as much as it is possible.&#34; <BR> <BR>Two other quick notes. Hatred of
    a person is not the same as hating what someone has done or does. Also, because
    most people deal incorrectly with their anger and hatred, it makes anger and hatred
    seem wrong. If the anger can be used to start something good, then that is the
    correct kind of anger. <BR> <BR>But with that said, the logo &amp;/or name itself
    seems too ironic for me.  I think a possible problem with a logo against something
    that it very closely associates with is the initial confusion, and even confusion
    after people find out what it means. It&#39;s smart to be able to find similarities
    with your opposition, but maybe this is too close? Ultimately, it&#39;s your call.
    However, it&#39;s not a logo I would be proud of displaying, if I were in the
    group, no matter how well it&#39;s aesthetically designed. It has lots of baggage
    that you probably won&#39;t be able to overcome. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>  <BR>&#60;/font&#62;'

  body: so we&#39;re comparing this organization to the actions of god?  <BR> <BR>If
    God and Paul had hate then we can congregate, advertise and propel some more?!
    With that example then you could say that Hitler followed a righteous path or
    any of the groups that hatethehate would target and it becomes a mute point. But
    somehow I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what the holy ones had in mind when its written
    that they &#34;hated&#34; - to become hate inc. and shower it on everyone you
    don&#39;t like hoping that they&#39;d smarten up. For some reason I think that
    maybe god or paul had a bit more power to persuade. See, if I were a religious
    person and god just told me he hated something we were doing I would probably
    freak out and do what-ever he said. Will hatethehate have that power - nah. <BR>
  created: '2004-04-02 21:14:34'
- body: I wrote that hatred and anger is often misused, and Hitler would be an example
    of an unjust hatred, as well as hatred misused. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think the
    examples provided advocate spreading hate through a hate group. While it might
    be fine for something truly wrong to make you angry, having that anger and acting
    upon the anger negatively are two different things. But I do think it is possible
    to have a just anger and act correctly. In the case of hatethehate, the anger
    is just. I&#39;m just not sure promoting more hatred is the best way to go.   <BR>

    example of an unjust hatred&#34; <BR> <BR>In your opinion &#40;and I&#39;m sure
    many others&#41;, but in his own mind, I&#39;m sure Hitler believed his hatred
    to be wholly justified, as did many of his followers. <BR> <BR>Just as, in a more
    contemporary arena, I&#39;m certain many millions of the followers of Islam believe
    their hatred for America and Western values is justified. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t
    think it&#39;s black and white, but equally, I don&#39;t think citing examples
    of &#39;just&#39; hatred and &#39;unjust&#39; hatred does anything to further
    the argument. As Tanya alludes to, it merely serves to highlight the similarities
    between people who hate -- &#39;justly&#39; or &#39;unjustly&#39;. <BR> <BR>Jordan

    the Hate one must not dwell within the confines of established dogma - but seek
    new and ill-defined order within the withered contradictions of the Hate. <BR>
    <BR>Here are a few excerpts from the Hate Manifesto... <BR> <BR>But all in all
    - hating anything, be it a sibling, officer of the law, spouse, a poodle, or bananna
    at sea... is equated with hating ones self.  No other way around it - &#40;maybe
    you can jump over Hate? I don&#39;t know for sure&#41; inflicting Hatred will
    eventually conflict Hatred. <BR>Hate is a state of confusion, non-illuminating
    and muddled.  Hate Hates please and sorry and other nicities. Can Hate only happen
    by one&#39;s self? Or does it take a person such as Hitler?  I don&#39;t think
    so!  Hate must always be capitalized. <BR> <BR>True Hates: or things we Love to

    If you express it you will waste it! <BR>If you have to do something, cover your
    bed in scabby pillows and blankets. <BR> <BR>Continue these activites FOREVER
    and eat you cherry oatmeal. <BR>You can stagnate far in Hate. <BR> <BR>But...
    <BR> <BR>Beware! You may be leading us all into False Hates, with your emblems
    of Hate. <BR>The False Hates: <BR>Do not fool yourself into thinking you Hate
    when in fact your Hates are FALSE and just a reverse of the &#34;L\x1D&#34; word
    with no possibility of leading to the PAM. Below are examples of the False Hate.
    The list is limited in  <BR>scope. <BR> <BR>False Hates: <BR>Road Rage <BR>Divorce
    <BR>Some sort of offense similar to murder but not. <BR>War <BR>Violence <BR>Betrayal
    <BR>Death <BR> <BR>I have much faith in your abilities young Sychophant - but
    you may be misled with the dogma stated thus far. You are fresh and wise! I sense
    you have much to teach us. If you have further questions please ask! For Hates
    knowledge is endless yet limiting. <BR> <BR>The following are quotes I have collected
    for the Hate leaflets: <BR>&#62; <BR>&#34;Hey, don&#39;t knock the self Hate.
    It&#39;s sexing the hate with someone I love!&#34;  <BR>&#62;Woody Allen  <BR>

    truth even to the gods.&#34;  <BR>&#62;Maureen Stapleton <BR> <BR>&#34;Hate things
