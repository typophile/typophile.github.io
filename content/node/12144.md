  expert, poet, translator of Native American lore and designer, Robert Bringhurst
  is known best for his typographic reference work <cite>[[Elements of Typographic
  Style]]</cite>, a frequently-updated book widely considered to be the definitive
  handbook for contemporary typographers. He also extensively updated Warren Chappel's
  <cite>[[Brief History of the Printed Word]]</cite> and wrote a short book / long
  essay on written communication and meaning, <cite>[[The Solid Form of Language]]</cite>.
  He collaborated with [[letterpress]] printer [[Peter Koch]] on <cite>[[Carving the
  Elements]]</cite>, a commentary on the <cite>Fragments of Parmenides</cite>. He
  has also written many volumes of poetry and translated lore.\r\n\r\nBringhurst's
  varied experience as a writer serves him well in his efforts to corral typography;
  his work as a poet gives him a clear, deft command of English, and his experience
  as a translator working with some uniquely difficult scripts gives him valuable
  insight into life beyond the Latin alphabet. His advice is sometimes idiosyncratic
  but never dogmatic, he sees typography as subservient to the text it sets, and above
  all he advocates humility as a typographer's greatest strength. His typographic
  writings are not perfect, but they are clear-eyed, graceful, and always useful."
