body: "We have a font that we created in FontLab Studio 5 and is generated as OTF
  for use in MS Word and InDesign. The product's web site is getting ready to launch
  but they're having trouble with the display of the font on the web.\r\n\r\nIn the
  most recent iteration of the site, using the most recent fonts (glyphs were recently
  added to the font) the font displays different ways at different sizes as shown
  in the below screen caps. The screen caps are small, medium and large, the medium
  being the one that will be used as the main size on the site.\r\n\r\nIn the medium,
  as you can see, there are different characters that are different sizes within words.
  In the word \"wisdom\" the m clearly seems smaller as do the n, the belly of the
  h and the r in some of the other words.\r\n\r\nThe site host, of course, is telling
  the client the problem is with the font we provided. Not knowing how they have things
  set up we're having a difficult time even guessing what might be happening.\r\n\r\nSo
  my basic question is: Does anyone know what causes this sort problem?\r\n\r\nThanks
  for having a look,\r\nKen\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LoebWebfont1Small_6428.JPG]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LoebWebfont2Book_3612.JPG]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LoebWebfont3Large_6506.JPG]"

  body: Yes. This is caused by missing or poor hinting instructions in the font. Since
    this is going to be used both online and in Microsoft Office, I strongly suggest
    making use of TrueType outlines and the advanced capabilities of TrueType hinting.
    There are automated solutions, but if you have a budget for high quality manual
    TT hinting, feel free to drop me a line.

  body: "This is most likely not related to your web server, as fonts are rendered
    on the client (web browser).\r\n\r\nI agree, this is most likely due to missing
    or bad hinting."

  body: Maybe you are doing something during export or web conversion that causes
    the hinting to be lost or overwritten. Different browsers give different results.

  body: "Yes, sorry, a very key component I didn't mention is that it looks OK in
    Chrome, but not Internet Explorer.\r\n\r\nI tried using FontLab's auto hinting
    on all the lowercase letters but it didn't seem to change things at all. I understand
    that the autohint may not be the optimal hinting but I would have thought I should
    have seen SOME sort of change. Agreed?\r\n\r\nThanks very much for taking the
    time to answer.\r\n\r\nKen\r\n\r\nAddendum: Just realized that I hadn't checked
    FontLab's settings for generating. I'll do that and investigate this hinting thing
    more. Thanks again."

  body: "Yes, if you changed the hinting, you should have seen different rendering
    in IE.\r\n\r\nNote however that unless something else changes, the browser might
    be caching the font from your earlier test. Did you clear the browser cache on
    the machine you were viewing in IE?\r\n\r\nAlso, Chrome on Windows or Mac?"
