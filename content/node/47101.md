  and I thought you fellow typophiles might have some suggestions for similars to
  the three typefaces\u2014which are obviously hand drawn\u2014that I could use as
  starting ponts.\r\n\r\nYour help and expertise is greatly appreciated, as always!\r\n\r\nPS:
  For our American friends\u2014hope you're having a great holiday weekend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HGW_sample_6117.jpg]"

  body: "Hi Mike,\r\n\r\nThis is a very subjective question, since it's hard to guess
    how much 'tweaking' you want to do. I looked through hand-drawn lettering fonts
    for each of the three styles on the cover. (1) = HOW GAMBLERS WIN; (2) = OR THE
    SECRETS OF; and (3) = ADVANTAGE PLAYING. I looked for fonts without layering that
    you would use for (1) and (3). \r\n\r\nThese would be fonts I might try for these
    (just ideas based on a quick look):\r\n\r\n(1): [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/ad-hoc/|Ad
    Hoc]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-rekord/|Rekord]], [[http://www.dafont.com/repent.font|Repent]],
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/sinclair-script-rr/|Sinclair]]\r\n\r\n(2):
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/p22/escher-hand/|Escher Hand]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/kooky-bt/|Kooky]]\r\n\r\n(3):

  body: "Hi MIke,\r\nThanks so much for the suggestions. \r\n\r\nMoulin Rouge could
    work quite well. Would love to find fonts for the others that are a bit closer
    ... but these are excellent ideas and much appreciated.\r\n\r\nCheers."

    Demi]] by Harold Lohner. \r\n\r\nI have also been trying to avoid popular fonts,
    because I think the 'antiqueness' would be offset by something that looked too
    familiar.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"

    Jester]], also by Harold Lohner. You'd need to pull in the points of the serifs,
    but the flaring might match the cover lettering fairly well.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
