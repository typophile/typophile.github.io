<div class=commentbody>Another <a href=http://betatype.com/pill/pill_sample_2.pdf>pdf</a>. I added small caps and a ton of punctuation to the lineal skeleton. Some of the punctuation is kind of rough, and I haven't done any kerning. Next step will be polishing the italic, then adding weight. <br> <br>I threw in some OpenType features (small caps and a couple of ligatures). It's not as tricky as I thought it would be. It really irks me that it only works in InDesign, and even their implementation is pretty weak.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yeah, it's still pretty rough. I've been going through and cleaning up all the bezier curves. Here is a <a href=http://betatype.com/pill/pill_sample_3.pdf>pdf</a> of a middle weight. The punctuation is still rough, but the characters are pretty clean at this point. I think the quotes are wrong, and the g isn't working as well in a body of text. I think I need to lighten it up and possibly give it some more space.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Expanding on Joseph's comments, it the quirkiness in those few characters which really sets Pill Gothic apart from being just another DIN (JAD?) I especially like how you've modified the cross-stroke of the e in the ae ligature to slope into meeting the one from the a. Perhaps the standard e should use the same type of diagonal. Without going overboard, there may be a few other select characters that could also utilize that diagonal stroke - the tail of the y and the tail of the Q, for example. <br> <br>I would agree the M would fit in a bit better dropped to the baseline, and in terms colour across the uppercase, I would consider narrowing the width of the U - it looks particularly out of place the all-caps heading for your regular weight PDF. <br> <br>I really like how this family is progressing.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Well, there's no mistaking the overall impression of DIN, <br>especially apparent in the caps PDF Christian provided. <br>That's why I had to investigate further.

<div class=commentbody>Caps are usually more convergent - they have a much narrower expressive range than lc. <br> <br>I think a good way to compare fonts is to look at the texture they make when setting a lot of text.

<div class=commentbody>Here is a <a href=http://betatype.com/pill/pill_sample_4.pdf>pdf</a> of nearly finalized spacing (the other <br>one was InDesign optical) without kerning. I also included <br>the bold (so far, it needs some tweeks--any suggestions <br>are appreciated) and the accented characters. <br> <br>I also included some alternate characters. To Grant's <br>comments about the <b>e</b>, the original <b>e</b> had an angled <br>cross-bar, but I couldn't decide if I liked the horizontal <br>cross bar better. I have since reinstated the angled <b>e</b>. <br> <br>As for the DIN stuff, if Pill is really a useful alternative, <br>I am flattered. They do have a similar feel, but Pill is <br>much 'trickier'. Whether that's a good thing or bad I <br>guess depends on how you use it. I would like to add <br>some more alternate characters to tone Pill down or <br>dress it up.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Tricky Feathers?? Hehe! <br> <br>The angled 'e'. What if you split the difference? <br> <br>The 'g'. I prefer the closed version. Can this at least be an alternate? <br> <br>The bold 'M' -- seems a bit heavy at the middle convergence point. I think the bold '4' has a nice solution for this problem. <br> <br>The '&", both weights -- That point needs to be exaggerated or done away with. What if you flattened it all the way up? <br> <br>Love the subtlety in the 'fl' lig. nice! <br> <br>The non-curvy 'y' should be an alternate. The curvy 'y' is much more interesting. <br> <br>Will your italic be only an oblique, or will you do something more "tricky" like triplex? <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0></div>

<div class=commentbody>Spacing: I think it's slightly loose. <br> <br>M: wider? Hey, the smallcaps one is different! And to me better. <br> <br>e: I like the angled bar one. <br> <br>g: I think the open one doesn't work as it stands, but an open bottom might be a great opportunity to try to make the angled join less steep, matching the "a"/"e". The different angle in the "g" has always been the biggest thing that has bugged me about Pill. <br> <br>k: definitely the straight-legged one. <br> <br>s: needs work. <br> <br>y: the curved tail one. <br> <br>Pound: beak out of character. <br> <br>I'd put more staightness in the Pilcrow and Section. <br> <br>Your accents seem out of character - more rigid please! Same with the Cedilla. <br> <br>The "OE" is a "CE". <br> <br>The Bold: I think it needs some modeling to avoid dark spots. But be very careful not to soften the character. <br> <br>Almost there! <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Tricks! More tricks! Just kidding. I don't like tricks for <br>tricks' sake.

<div class=commentbody>Pill is original without looking odd, which is an achievement, especially in a sans serif. <br> <br>Somehow the original higher middle on the M looks more consistent with your face, but is a bit awkward in your original. Johnston Underground, which looks wider (as Hrant suggests) and ends further off the baseline, has a nice balance. <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/p22/underground/ target=_blank>http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/p22/underground/</a> <br> <br>On the S and s, Palatino's unusual S's (also in the italic) might give you ideas on how to keep your 'pill' arch at the top and bottom, and make the connecting stroke stronger. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Nice developments. <br> <br>I agree with Hrant about the small cap M being better than <br>the cap M... now I feel sheepish for suggesting you drop it <br>to the baseline. Also, I agree with Hrant and Tiff about the <br>open g - I prefer the closed one. <br> <br>I'm not sure about the cross bar of the e, but I could be <br>convinced. The italics are a very nice touch.

<div class=commentbody>Christian, <br> <br>Great work! Your font is beautiful and I will definitely be adding it to my collection when you are finished. Let us know when it goes live. <br> <br>As far as spacing, the overall color seems very consistent. Although it is difficult to get a feel for the true spacing when the text is justified. I tripped over a few words in the second graph, but this could simply be because those lines were a little cramped. <br> <br>I would love to see the old style numerals as the default. They really play nicely with the other characters. <br> <br>Go Christian!!!!</div>

<div class=commentbody>Stephen, good call. <br> <br>-- <br> <br>It's all "clicking" very nicely. <br>The overall spacing looks great, except: <br>1) Important: your blank space is too narrow. <br>2) The "r" is loose on the right. <br> <br>The OS numerals bother me. At the very least I think they need to be bigger in the body, like the height of the smallcaps. <br> <br>Some other stuff: <br>1) In both sets of numerals, the "2", "4" and "7" are dark. <br>2) Why is the eszet short? <br>3) Some of the diagonals are a bit dark. Like look at the "Z". <br>4) The bars of "f" and "t" need to be thicker. <br>5) I think the "S" needs a rigid spine. <br>6) Wassup with that megatrap in the Bold smallcap "A"? <br> <br>Almost there! <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks Hrant, but two disagreements: <br> <br>- I don't see how the 'r' has too much right space.

<div class=commentbody>Well, I don't know what's already been kerned in there, but you have to account for linguistics, like how often what ends up on the right side of the "r"; that determines your base spacing - and then comes kerning. Plus you have to decide how bad touching is - I think people who have kerning off don't mind touching that much. Also, in a sans face with such a strong-beaked "r" you're in a position of relying more on kerning to really make things click. <br> <br>-- <br> <br>That "A" can be seen in the December 29 PDF, in the captions for the side stuff on page 1. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Four weights is much better than three, if they're <i>paired</i> right. James Montalbano once explained it (on Typophile) very sensically - assuming I remember it right: the Regular should be weighted for text, the Bold for emphasis in a body of Regular; the Light should be an alternate weight for text; and the Semi (or Demi) an emphasis weight for the Light. All this means that you don't want them spaced mathematically, but instead according to function. <br> <br>Also, in practice the Semi can serve very well for text, except it doesn't have a "bold" (in a set of 4). <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Christian: These weights look great. The only thing that stood out though was the numeral 4. It appears heavier than the other numbers on screen and on laser proofs.

<div class=commentbody>Christian, sorry to pester, but could you show some samples with the four weights intermixed? Like a block of each with each of the other three used for emphasis. <br> <br>And a question: what made you include the L-bar and l-bar? I've been getting mixed signals about whether to include them in my own "base" encoding or not. <br> <br>Oh, and I think your curly braces need more oomph (a highly technical term difficult to explain*). <br> <br>* Credit goes to David Berlow for that one. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>HI Christian, <br> <br>Nicely done on the extra light. So tricky to balance the modulation! <br> <br>Your obliques look pretty good to me. The following picture illustrates the major distortions that happen when mathematically skewing a font. All letters are thinned vertically as you mentioned (and fixed). The letters that get most distorted are the round ones. You may know all this, but I thought I'd post it anyways for typophile edification: <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/28240.gif alt> <br> <br>1. The verticals become more thin as noted above <br>2. The bottom right and upper left (if applicable) thin out <br>3. The upper right and bottom left (if applicable) thicken up <br>4. The upper right and bottom left contract (the curve gets tighter) <br>5. The bottom right and upper left expand (the curve opens up) <br> <br>Also note generally that the distortion gets bigger and the glyph more narrow as the angle increases. In my (limited) experience the tricky and time consuming part is fixing 4 & 5 (usally 2 & 3 at the same time). I was given this tip by Ed Benguiat: <br>The obliqued curve should look pretty close to what it would be if you oblique it half as much. In other words, if you oblique it 20%, make the curves emulate the 10% version. I find pasting the 10% version into the mask layer a handy guide. You still have to fix the modulation problem, but it's a good start. <br> <br>Cheers, <br>Randy</div>

<div class=commentbody>Obliques: I don't see much distortion, but I do think they need to stand apart a little more from the roman. Your angle is already steep, and you've already made it narrower, so I'd try making the obliques slightly lighter than their roman counterparts, and maybe change some forms too (like make the "a" and maybe the "g" mono, but don't make the "f" descending - too old-fashioned). <br> <br>And a question: <br>Are fractions for old-style numerals supposed to be full-height, or really small? <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Randy, your illustrations are legendary--always helpful. I had seen the explanations on Briem's website (one of the most helpful sites I've ever seen). For these obliques, I didn't do any curve correction; the angle seemed slight enought to not make a huge difference. The squarish forms of the letters help also. I did thicken the vertical strokes, however. <br> <br>As for the fractions, I haven't done a different set for the OS numerals. Should there be a difference? I agree that the 4 1/2 combo looks a little odd.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Here is a rough condensed version. I still need to clean up some weight issues (The N, for example), and a few unruly beziers (always the s).

<div class=commentbody>The letterspacing here is looking increasingly too tight with increase in weight. If you have a weight axis going with the stems just getting fatter equally in both [horizontal] directions, and no increase in character width, that explains it. I'm a big fan of uniwidth fonts, but beyond a certain weight the forms will start looking uncharacteristically too narrow (or too wide on the light end) when you try to maintain set-widths.

<div class=commentbody>A new 's' shape occurred to me today. I'm trying to decide if I should include it as an alternate, or make it the default. It is more extreme, so in some ways makes the font less versitile. On the other hand, it makes the font more interesting, and, I think, justifies the 'a' and the 'g'. Of course, the old S's would be included in the "Stylistic Alternates" OpenType feature. What do you all think? Does it make the font less useful; does it make it more interesting, or both? <br> <br><center><table border=1><tr><td><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_pdf.gif align=left alt=application/pdf>New S<br><a href=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/New_S-28967.pdf target=_blank><b>New_S.pdf</b></a> (43.3 k)</td></tr></table></center></div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>It's an odd balance to maintain - unique personality vs mainstream usability. Personally, I think the new S adds a bit too much unneeded quirkiness to the face. Maybe this is due in part to the fact I've just become used to the more traditional S in previous versions of the fonts. For some reason I don't find the existing 'a', 'e' and 'g' characters to be as radical a departure from the rest of the character set. I certainly wouldn't abandon the character, as it deserves to be an alternate.</div>
