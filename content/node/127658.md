body: "Hello\r\nCan anyone recommend some kind of online encyclopedia of fonts? I
  ask because every time I start a new project, I want to research fonts of particular
  periods or locations and I never really know where to look. For example, currently
  I would like to research fonts evocative of Italy, from all periods, and other than
  typing 'italy' into a few sites like fonts.com, I don't have a clue where to look.\r\n\r\nThank
  you for any suggestions.\r\n"

  body: fontsinuse.com isn't encyclopedic, nor does it break typefaces down by country
    of use or origin, but you can search by period (decade) and key words (Italy,
    Italian).
