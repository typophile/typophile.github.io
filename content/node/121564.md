  alphabet and number samples of the photo-lettering fonts?\r\nThe Alphabet Thesaurus
  Volumes do not seems to contain the complete samples...\r\n\r\n"

    a supplement to the display size font in use phrase -- their established practice
    -- they included an appendix in 8 point type that showed more.\r\nPerhaps someone
    with the later books could clarify.\r\nDon"

  body: "Hi Don,\r\n\r\nYou are right... After further research I found out that they
    did published another catalogue called \"Film Alphabet Compendium Franklin Photolettering\"
    which contains all the alphabet and number samples. It was in a binder format.\r\n\r\nI
    would be interested to know if anyone is willing to sell their copy to me. Price
    will be negotiable...\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The Alphabet Thesaurus was published by Photo-Lettering Inc., not Franklin
    Photolettering Inc. Franklin did do some knockoffs of PhotoLettering's stuff but
    they were tiny in comparison, size-wise. House Industries is the current owner
    of the entire Photo-Lettering Inc. collection.\r\n\r\nThe Alphabet Thesaurus Volume
    2 does contain extended samples of the fonts in the back of the book, about eight
    or nine point, but none of the samples show complete alphabets. The missing letters
    are not consistent either but vary from font to font.\r\n\r\nIt might be possible
    to eventually find a copy for sale on eBay. That's how I finally acquired my copy,
    using eBay's emailed watch list feature. They aren't easy to find."
