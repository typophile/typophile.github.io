  Thessaloniki. <BR> <BR>_2 concepts as you see.  <BR>First one is folded in half
  to fit in a 23x11 cm envelope,  <BR>second is a double sided post-card  <BR>and
  i am thiking to print 3-4 cards   <BR>with different images on the back. <BR>_The
  client insists on using the photos they took  <BR>from a concert they organized
  last month. <BR>_What i am concerning more is how obvious is the object  <BR>in
  card 2 &#40;i won&#39;t say what it is&#41; and how can i make  <BR>the card#1 less
  &#34;heavy&#34; keeping all those photos. <BR> <BR>Type used: Minion. <BR> <BR>christos

  body: The image is apparent and rather lovely, although the bottom branches could
    be pulled to the left to make more of a triangle shape; at the moment I prefer
    option b, the type on option a needs some work on it and some transparency to
    set it into the ribbon, although I would like to see an apostrophe rather than
    an foot mark. <BR>Tim

  body: Christos can you substitute silver or gold for the black? That would lighten
    up the heaviness of the photos.
