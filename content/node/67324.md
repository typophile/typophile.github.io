body: I've found The Font Game, Typewar, Kern, Typograffit (an odd one). There appears
  to be lots of games but nothing of utility. Font Wizard perked my interest, but
  there are no ratings.  Recommendations for a mobile fix for the type addiction?

  body: The Typography Manual is essential! Also, Whatthefont lets you take pictures
    of type and identify it on the go, and Fontshuffle is quite interesting as well.

  body: "One of my favorite comments about the Font Game goes like this: \"the Font
    Game has redefined the term niche product\".\r\n\r\nWhatthefont is the only app,
    that I know of, that elegantly solves a difficult problem. I've heard salesmen
    going on and on about how painful it is to deal with clients who don't know which
    font their logo is set in. They don't have to wait days to hear back from the
    design department anymore, and the designers don't have to waste time tracking
    down an obscure font.\r\n\r\nBut this can't be the only problem that needs solving,
    right? Most iPhone and web developers aren't typographers. We like to solve problems,
    difficult ones, so let us know what they are and we'll build an app for that."
