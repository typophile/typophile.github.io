  is going to be screenprinted, 2 color on 110# bright white cover, at 19 x 25\" by
  Grand Palace Silkscreen.\r\n\r\nI am attempting to fund this project through kickstarter.
  Please take a look at my link and if you are interested, pick one or two prints
  up!\r\nI have tried to upload an image of it to this post but keep getting html
  errors. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1076266526/boom-boom-room-poster\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your time and consideration!"
