  body: I find the alignment of the d and p to be a bit off. Although they are likely
    lined up geometrically, it looks like productions is too far left.  <BR> <BR>In
    its present form with the current alignments, I don&#39;t read it as &#34;a dupuis&#34;--the
    &#34;a&#34; looks like a seperate symbol, that stands for the alphabet, not necessarily
    a character in the name.

  body: I read it as dupuis a productions. I guess its because the balloon&#39;s tail
    is pointing at productions. You might also try keeping a dupuis in the face you
    have it and productions in another face or caps? a dupuis is their name right?
    productions is what they do

  body: 'The way you have &#34;dupius&#34; and &#34;productions&#34; the same horizontal
    width looks strange in this font. as the curve is so extreme on the &#34;d&#34;,
    the vertical line of the &#34;p&#34; seems to make it look as though it is farther
    to the left than the &#34;d&#34;. The change in font listed by Daniel might help
    this, or you could shrink and maybe right justify the word productions. As well,
    this would allow for the speech bubble to be in reference of the word dupius,
    and if you make the &#34;a&#34; the same size as dupius, you should get better
    readability through the whole name. Here, this is easier than trying to explain
    in words: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/22493.jpg"
