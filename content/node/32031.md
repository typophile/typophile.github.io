body: I am a Visual Communications student, and i am trying to find what fonts were
  popular for the 1940's.  More specific, fonts and styles used in advertising during
  this period and the history behind them.  i have not had much luck web searching
  for this info.  Is there no web sites with this info?  Any help, especially free
  sites for a student budget, would be greatly appreciated.  Thank You

    web is in its infancy and there isn't much of it around, so you need to <em>physically</em>
    relocate yourself to a real bricks n'mortar library. Two books that have the same
    '20th-century-decade-by-decade' structure are 20th century type:remix by Lewis
    Blackwell (1998, Laurence King Publishing, London UK) and the earlier Graphic
    Design Sourcebook by Liz McQuiston and Barry Kitts (1987, Quarto Publishing, London
    UK). Both of them have a chapter devoted to the 1940s."

    as magazines and newspapers. \r\n\r\nAlternatively, on the internet, search for
    well-known magazines.\r\nScientific American, National Geographic, Vogue, Mademoiselle.\r\nJust
    enter \"Fortune magazine 1945\" - I just did and it's $4 on ebay. That magazine

    out these pages (scroll down)\r\nhttp://www.americanartarchives.com/dohanos.htm\r\n\r\nTo
    identify and date the fonts in ads, use Matt McGrew's \"American Metal Typefaces
    of the Twentieth Century\" (Oak Knoll), which is remarkably comprehensive. If
    an ad \"type\" isn't in there, it's probably hand lettering."
