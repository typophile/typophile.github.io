body: Does anyone have any preference between or thoughts about Glypha versus Serifa?
  &#40;I have both families.&#41; <BR> <BR>Obviously there are similarities. Adrian
  Frutiger designed them both, and I read something that said Glypha is &#34;based
  on&#34; Serifa. <BR> <BR>Glypha has an extra black weight, which is an advantage
  for my purposes, and Serifa seems to have a smaller x-height. Serifa seems a little
  hipper or cooler and Glypha seems a little cheesy to me... I think it has a kind
  of 1970s vibe. <BR> <BR>But these are just my opinions. I&#39;d really like to know
  what other people think. <BR> <BR>Thanks.

  body: "Frutiger in Adrian Frutiger: Typefaces. The Complete Works, slams his Serifa:
    \"Serifa is one of my worst attempts at a typeface, I think it's fair to say.
    ... My idea of a constructivist slab serif type face as wrong for the eye ...
    just isn't comfortable to read, it doesn't flow well enough because of its wide
    fit.\" \r\n\r\nExplains that Glypha is Serifa made narrower by stretching it in
    the x-height region. It's evident he thinks it works a bit better as text, but
    he still says \"As opposed to other slab serif faces, Glypha is an engineered
    typeface. There's something contrived about it; I'm a little disappointed in it.
    It seems too harsh.\" He does think that it works in headlines and large posters. "

  body: "It was apparent in the mid-1970s that small x-height faces were pass\xE9.\r\nThe
    companies producing typositor fonts, such as Photo-Lettering and Headliners, were
    cranking out large x-height versions of just about every face of any merit, and
    many without. And of course ITC, with large x-height versions of Cheltenham, Garamond,
    Kabel, etc., as well as similarly scaled new designs such as Les Usherwood's Caxton.\r\nThis
    is the cultural and economic context which informs Glypha."

  body: Nick, I remember reading that the big x-height craze was also influenced by
    the switch to phototype. The desire was to have one-size fits all, and large x-heights
    helped that, it was thought. Do you think this is right?
