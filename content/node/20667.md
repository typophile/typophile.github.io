  belongs to a telecom operator in the UAE [ www.etisalat.ae ] \r\n\r\nIts not one
  of the standard MS Office fonts so am a bit lost. Any suggestions would be appreciated.
  Thank you in advance.\r\n\r\nPS-after reading all,(most of), the posts in the \"Type
  ID Board\" am sure that if any one can help, you guys can."

  body: If no one responds with the exact font you are looking for -- and you would
    like a very close substitute - take a look at ITC Benguiat Gothic Medium... The
    "e" is different, but it is the same overall feeling...
