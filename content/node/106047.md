  body: "For the bottom image, ARMED FORCES POLICE, I thought I had a list of several
    sans with this boxy S, but all I have at hand is a condensed version, Schmallfette
    Binder-Style, designed by Joseph Binder and released by D. Stempel AG in 1959.
    Digitized as <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/bindlestiff-nf/\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">Bindlestiff NF</a> by Nick Curtis.<br /> If you expand it, and
    adjust the M, you will be fairly close.\r\nDon"

  body: "An alternative, and perhaps easier, approach is to start with Morris Fuller
    Benton's Bank Gothic, make it narrower, square the sloped terminations and do
    other edits. A useable starting point is the Linotype version <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/morris-sans/\"

    body: 'Thank you so much for the help Don !! I think RR Extra Bold Extra Condensed
      with some adjustment would do the trick. Quite surprised that there aren''t
      any exact match to the font.     '

  body: "ARMED FORCES POLICE: no perfect match. Some interesting alternatives: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/route-66-nf|Route
    66 NF]] (matching almost everything, not enough bold though), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letterbox/berber|Berber]]
    King Caps Bold (using alternate /[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letterbox/berber/caps-bold/glyphs.html#glyphs/508403/342|A]]

    and reworking /M centre vertex)\r\n\r\nAOYAMA CITY: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/chank/nicotine|Nicotine]]
    should work nicely. Alternative: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/los-alamos|Los

    previous [[http://typophile.com/node/99394|discussion]], feels really \"custom\"
    to me (mainly because of this unconventional /G)... Anyway, some alternatives:
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/coniglio/nomad|Nomad]] (reworking almost everything...),
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/suitcase/vafle|Vafle]] Condensed, [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fdi/iwan-reschniev|Iwan
    Reschniev]] Black (reworking /G and /S terminals, not enough bold), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/chank/nicotine|Nicotine]]
    (mainly reworking /R leg, /S transition and adding a leg to /G), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/sign-kit|Sign
    Kit JNL]] (reworking /G and digits), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dizajndesign/komu|Komu]]
    A (the closest I guess, only needs little tweaking on /M centre vertex and /R
    leg to do the trick)"
