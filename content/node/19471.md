body: "[[Type Directors Club]] (TDC) FontTech Weekend  (sponsored by Adobe, Microsoft,
  and Monotype) featured starring roles by presenters [[John Hudson]], [[Adam Twardoch]],
  [[Thomas Phinney]], and [[Diane Collier]]. \r\nTDC Chairman James Montalbano led
  a cast of Typophile characters ([[Paul Hunt]], [[William Berkson]], [[Chester Jenkins]],
  and [[Chris Lozos|yours truly]]) as participants (along with several folks from
  the REAL world).The ever-gracious Carol Wahler was a wonderful host and made us
  all feel very at home. John Hudson deserves special gratitude for persevering through
  his presentations in spite being sick as a dog (please don\u2019t sing \u201CMad
  dogs and Englishmen\u201D). Thomas gets the award for best screen-saver with beautiful
  pictures of his daughter Miranda and Adam Twardoch\u2019s \u201Claptop\u201D wins
  the \u201Cmost likely to succeed as a lethal weapon\u201D award. Diane Collier gets
  my vote for the best one-liner with the quip, \u201CAnd this is easier than VTT
  because?...\u201D\r\nSeriously, it was a great event and I highly recommend it to
  all type geeks interested in the murky waters of opentype and hinting. Thomas is
  giving more of the same in Lisbon so if you missed this, you might fly over to AtypI.\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks to TDC and the presenters for making it all possible!\r\n\r\nChrisL\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Durante.jpg]"

  body: "Perhaps, as FontLab Studio 5 and type designers technical savvy further matures
    over the next year we can have a super geek weekend of VTT vs FontLab in hinting
    tag team match. Particpants would bring a finished TrueType font, and be guided
    through the hinting process, one day in VTT and one day In FLS5.\r\n\r\nJames"

    hope TDC will keep up the supply of advanced type development seminars. \r\nBTW,
    We all missed you Si and drank your share of the beer :-)\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Thanks James!\r\nI for one would like to see one on kerning. Class based
    kerning and exceptions with the effect of diacritics; what can be done with combining
    glyphs built on the fly; classes accross scripts (probably Greek Cyrillic, and
    Latin).\r\nI would also like to see sessions on building non-Latin scripts.\r\nOthers
    sessions on family extension strategies and workflow.\r\n\r\nI hope others will
    chime in and give some potential topics for TDC or others to consider.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
