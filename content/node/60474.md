body: "Occasionally when I install .otf font files, XP can't tell the roman from the
  italic.  This would be for two .otf files with the same \"base name\" or whatever
  with one called \"roman\" and the other \"italic\".  I see two entries in the font
  directory, in word processor pulldowns, font browser programs, etc.  But when I
  click one or the other, what is loaded and displayed appears to be the file I installed
  first.  I.e. if I installed the Roman then the italic, after both are installed
  when I click either, only the Roman is displayed.  If I then uninstall the Roman,
  and then click the italic file, the italic file is then correctly displayed.  I've
  also seen similar problems previously distinguishing bold from book, etc.  This
  isn't consistent behavior, but occurs only with certain fonts.  After installation,
  I can also click on the problem files still compressed inside of the original zip
  files and the same thing happens.  It's like when one of the files is loaded, XP
  automatically redirects it to the other.  If I swap the order of installation for
  the two problem files, the other file is displayed.  There are no problems with
  the glyphs themselves, as under the right circumstances they can display correctly,
  but just not when both are installed.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?  Are there any tweaks
  to the otf files or the registry that can be performed to keep XP from confusing
  them?\r\n\r\nThanks!"
