  body: "I love titling fonts like this one.\r\nI really like how it's pointy, I also
    like the fact that the proportions are not strictly classical which makes the
    typeface a lot more versatile. I love the punctuation and the @ symbol.\r\nThe
    numerals are elegant I think it would be useful for retailers and fashion magazines
    if you had various positions for the dollar sign, and also superscript for all
    the numerals."
