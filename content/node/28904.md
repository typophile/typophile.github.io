body: "People are becoming really good at ignoring advertising, so advertisers are
  forced to become more creative about placement and context. As a designer with who
  loves creative advertising I applaud this stuff. But I'm torn. Of course it's more
  intrusive than a billboard you can ignore. But does the cleverness make it more
  acceptible? Is it actually less intrusive because they don't have to be huge billboards
  (that obstruct natural views or cityscapes).\r\n\r\nTake a look at about a dozen
  <a href=\"http://www.hemmy.net/2006/10/15/creative-advertisements-around-the-world/\">creative
  ad placements from around the world</a>. What do you think? \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/creativeadvertisements17_4443.jpg]\r\n\r\nIn
  this example, a life-size Mini at the top of a subway entrance/exit in Zurich gives
  passersby the impression that an endless stream of people are emerging from (or
  entering) the car. It's creative genius, but does it go too far? I mean, as a citizen
  I think it would make me smile because it's so clever. But honestly, if the street
  becomes full of this kind of gimick I think I would begin to dislike advertising
  more than I already do.\r\n\r\n(Thanks Sarah for the link.)"

    others will follow. Everytime something works, as it happens, others try to imitate
    and/or mimick. Social responsibility aside, of course. ;^)

  body: "I've become far more aware of waging integrated and innovative brand campaigns
    after just a couple of months of working at a large ad agency.\r\n\r\nFinding
    effective creative, clever, humorous and enlightening ways of promoting products,
    services and brands to the mass public or target audiences seem more prevalent
    than ever before.\r\n\r\nThe \"above-the-board\" approaches I'm basically fine
    with. It's these newer alternate/stealth methods that I fine intrusive, offensive
    and sometimes downright underhanded!\r\n\r\n(Edit-A-Bit: will update later. -<em>N.F.</em>)"
