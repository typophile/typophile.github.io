  light version comparable to the Roma inline variant\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/roma/inline/\r\n\r\nI
  would like to use it next to Roma (link) So its important they kind of work well
  together\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/roma/regular/\r\n\r\nThinking
  about using DTL Noble but the light isn't quite thin enough + its a bit over my
  budget :-D\r\n\r\nHope someone can help, thanks!"

    did you consider DTL Nobel an alternative?"

  body: "Hey Frodo,\r\n\r\nCan't use the inline because as far as i can say it is
    made to use in combination with for example Roma solid,  The X-height off all
    the letters is more or less different (for example compare U and M), if i'm not
    mistaken therefore its only to be used as an \"inline\" specifically with other
    Roma variants. When i type a word with the inline version the word looks kind
    of wobbly and some letters appear to not sit on a baseline but kind of float in-between
    baseline and x-heigth.\r\n\r\nI'm not a type designer so do correct me if i'm
    completely wrong on this.\r\n\r\nI considered DTL Noble because i kind of had
    the idea they kind of would work...again not sure therefore i was asking for some
    suggestions from people whom are better at this and have loads more experience."

    The differences tend to look like errors. Roma is modeled on the letterforms of
    capitalis monumentalis, as is Trajan. There is at least on sans serif take on
    these: Trajan Sans. It has no lowercase though."

    not Noble.
