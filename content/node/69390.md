body: "Hi Everyone,\r\n\r\nCurrently I'm improving my portfolio to apply to the TypeMedia
  course at KABK in 2011. I'm working on a bunch of things but I want to make sure
  my portfolio is solid because I really want to grab one of those 12 spots. This
  year they have 80 serious portfolio's for 12 spots so it's a bit daunting. \r\n\r\nAny
  tips on what to include and exclude? I plan on posting my type related projects
  on here to get critiqued when they get to that stage but for now I was just wondering
  if anyone had any suggestions? Or, if you've done the KABK course any advice you
  could give on either the portfolio or letter of intent?\r\n\r\nI've graduated with
  a diploma in graphic design and have been working for 3 years and I can't deny my
  desire to be more involved in type design and typography. It would be a dream come
  true to study typography at KABK so any help would be much appreciated! The more
  I work on my portfolio the more excited I get!\r\n\r\nThanks for your help!\r\n\r\nLauren\r\n\r\n\r\n"
