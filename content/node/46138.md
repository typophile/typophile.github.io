  body: "This is not a familiar script to me, and it looks like it is possibly an
    OpenType font. Often greeting card (and gift wrap) companies have their own fonts,
    and that would be my guess about this one -- a custom in-house font design. \r\n\r\nThe
    most similar script I was able to find was [[http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000329#specimen|Memoir]]
    by Stephen Rapp. It has many OT alternates, but no exact matches for letters like
    the swashy h and y of this sample.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
