  body: "I see that I have worded this thread incorrectly.  It should be been a stencil
    font similar to 'Giant Background' not just Giant.  I guess I am just being really
    picky because all that I want is just the background font without highlight or
    shaded version.  That is why I was wondering if there was something else out there.
