body: "I'd like to get some opinions about whether or not it is deemed ok to uses
  a font other than the one the specimen is created for in that specimen.\r\n\r\nI'm
  thinking specifically about using a different font for body copy in a specimen designed
  for a display font.  It seems fairly straight forward to me that you wouldn't want
  to use a bold display font for body text in the specimen.\r\n\r\nAnd what if I have
  never created a font meant to be used for body copy?  Is it ok to use someone else's
  font for the copy?"

  body: By all means use someone else's font if it gives a good idea of the context
    in which yours is meant to be used and shows a harmonious pairing. Just credit
    it.

  body: Josh, the idea is what is acceptable to use if there is no harmonious pairing,
    and has no context in comparison to the specimen font.  If it was harmonious,
    well that would be a no brainer.

  body: just imagine it looks like the most difficult font to pair up with any other
    font ever made, then you will know why I asked this question.  Seriously, did
    you guys think I would waste your time asking the experts some brain dead easy
    shit?

    I said sure. Not sure why you're disregarding all the answers you're getting.
    Isn't that what you wanted to hear?\r\n\r\nAnd I sort of doubt you've made the
    most difficult-to-pair-up font ever made. Want to show us?"

    sipping a cool adult beverage, ogling a slightly-clad person of their preferred
    gender sunbathing nearby. There is also a fixture at the back of the boat. It
    holds a fishing rod, there is a line in the water...what''s that called again? '

    a bad choice either.
