  plate\u201D) for television and I was wondering how fellow members felt about writing
  and reading date + time on TV and the legibility issue. On rare occasions, at the
  end of the \u201Cpromo\u201D we have to put a title of the show, specific date in
  the month & time. This end plate/ menu appears usually for about 4-5 sec with the
  reviling of the type, so this information stays on usually fully revealed for about
  3 sec. So, you can see there is definitely a challenge in delivering it, as this
  message must be as concise as possible. Also, one thing I should mention that devices
  like \u201Cdot\u201D and \u201Ccommas\u201D don\u2019t work that well on TV as they
  tend to disappear.  So, here are some ways of doing it:\r\n\r\nExample\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\nName
  of the show\r\nDecember 10  9 PM E/P\r\n\r\n2\r\nName of the show\r\nDecember 10
  / 9 PM E/P\r\n\r\n3\r\nName of the show\r\nDecember 10TH -  9 PM E/P\r\n\r\n4\r\nName
  of the show\r\n10 December  9 PM E/P\r\n\r\n5\r\nName of the show\r\nDecember 10\r\n9
  PM E/P\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs you can see the, the first objective is to convey the
  date, and the time is the secondary message. The title of the show is about 30-36
  points and could appear in two lines and the date & time is about 22 points (usually
  in different color). The typeface is your regular sans-serif and the TV channel
  is in North America.\r\n\r\nFirst, here I my thoughts on it and please feel free
  to give me your opinion and suggestions. \r\n\r\n1\r\nThis example is quite common
  on TV, but is quite problematic, because even if we put a couple of spacing between
  the day & time, they tend \u201Cmerge\u201D and became unreadable altogether. However,
  many people would argue that is a the way the average person would read the date
  here in North America.\r\n\r\n2\r\nThis case is quite similar to 1 and has similar
  problems.\r\n\r\n3\r\nIs a solution in a way to 1&2, but becomes quite lengthy,
  and 10+TH could impair the reading in a way.\r\n\r\n4\r\nIs a solution I personally
  favor, however critics would say that \u201Cthis is not the way people would usually
  read the date in North America\u201D. However, I believe that the way brain perceives
  this information and reading it is quite different thing. \r\n\r\n5\r\nCould be
  a solution to 1,2,3 & 4, however it alters the overall design of the message and
  can appear quite overwhelming.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m really sorry about this lengthy
  post, but I would really appreciate member\u2019s opinion & insight on this issues.
  I believe it is a simple legibility issue, meaning which message would be clearer
  in less than 3 sec. Also, I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t reveal the name of the network
  as it could get in trouble. Thanks very much,\r\n\r\nJennifer\r\n"

    as \u201Cdesigners have a huge role to play in society\u201D. Ironically, these
    details actually affect millions of people who watch TV, but we tend to care less
    about it than the printed medium I guess. \r\n\r\nAnyway, any comments are welcome,
    you don\u2019t need to be an expert. Thanks !\r\n\r\nJen"

  body: "solution #4 -- this would be problematic because the 9 that follows December
    does read at the date as well as does the 10 which precedes. \r\n\r\nsolution
    #5 -- even if this appears to be more wordy it does help reading more. \r\n\r\nI'd
    guess a lot of the problem solving will be in how you set the type. Could you
    share samples?\r\n"

    body: "Hi Jennifer. I have a strong attraction to 5 and here's why: I think it
      takes a long time to parse the others when more than one thing is happening
      on a line. I don't know if an en-dash (or even a bullet) with space on either
      side would be more quickly taken in than a slash, but even though 5 goes to
      three lines, each line is its own topic in a sense. So as I look them over,
      I keep feeling that the gestalt of the three simple lines enters my brain faster
      than the two more complex lines -- I don;t have to slow down and figure out
      what's happening when it changes from date to time. Does this make any sense?\r\n\r\nBruce

    E/P\r\n\r\nThis way you are clearly breaking up formatting between the date, and
    you make sure the hour can't be mistaken for a date.\r\n\r\nAlso put the 'th'
    as a superscript. People might not read it, but I'm sure they'll unconsciously
    accept the symbol for either a 'st', 'nd', 'rd' or 'th'."

  body: "I agree with Pierre, showing time in the proper format as opposed to dropping
    the \u201C:00\u201D would make it read better. I would leave the  \u201Dth\u201D
    out, as people already read dates that way without the extra letters. And unless
    there's a shortage of space, just spell out \u201DEastern/Pacific.\u201D It's
    one thing to abbreviate in print where people have time to figure things out,
    but people who read or think slowly might not figure the E/P out fast enough to
    notice it at all."

  body: "Thanks everyone ! It definitely gives me something to think about. It seems
    like #5 seems to strike a consensus. Also, Pierre suggestion of adding :00 helps
    a lot and at the same time does not alter overall design.\r\n\r\nSo modified #3
    & #5 would look as following:\r\n\r\n3\r\nName of the show\r\nDecember 10th, 9:00
    PM E/P\r\n\r\n5\r\nName of the show\r\nDecember 10th\r\n9 PM E/P     (or 9:00
    PM E/P)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll try to answer some of the question:\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,
    in television, broadcast designers set & design templates, but it\u2019s editors/credit
    producers that actually do this stuff on daily basis and they usually have very
    little or no knowledge of typography. As a result, they hardly every kern words/letter
    and the best they can do is add more spacing, so it\u2019s quite \u201Ccrude\u201D
    process.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the tools they use does not allow them to use \u201Cen
    dash\u201D or \u201Csuperscript\u201D, so the \u201Cth\u201D would have to be
    either lower case of upper case only. E/P is means Eastern & Pacific time, meaning
    the show would be airing at the same time in both of these time zones. E/P has
    to be abbreviated due to luck of space.\r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks for all the suggestion.
    I find it very refreshing to hear it from people outside of TV, as TV people are
    usually biased towards certain solution...\r\n"
