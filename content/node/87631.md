body: "Hello Gals et Guys:\r\n\r\nI have a friend that seriously depends on Filemaker.
  He was using Georgia for form entry. I recommended he change the font to a sans
  to improve onscreen appearance on his iPad. Neue Helvetica is being used now which
  is magnitudes more legible. Remote or guest users also have the ability to make
  entries to the database.\r\n\r\nSo here are some issues:\r\n\r\nI recommended to
  my friend that he use Neue Helvetica for the database because this font is present
  on all his idevices: iPad, iPhone, and mac. But when remote users make entries or
  changes, the database does not automatically convert the formatting to the font
  he specified.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to have Filemaker reformat remote or guest entries
  to the database default?\r\n\r\nIs it possible to upload other fonts onto the iPad
  or iPhone for database entry.\r\n\r\nWhile Neue Helvetica is okay. I am thinking
  that Corpid Semi Condensed is perfect for the job.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m not sure if hinting
  is really an issue... some fonts that have hinting butcher the on-screen appearance.\r\n\r\nFrom
  what I understand, Filemaker does not accept opentype fonts on Windows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease
  recommend space efficient sanserif types.\r\n\r\n\r\nI thought of Myriad, Frutiger,
  Corpid, and even Tahoma. Anything else I need to know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you
  for your assistance,\r\n\r\nMike Diaz :-)"
