  body: "This may have been custom-created for Vogue by one of lettering artists of
    the time (Wes Wilson, Victor Moscoso, Rick Griffin). I'm not finding a digital
    match. And the style is actually based in Art Nouveau/Secessionist-era hand-drawn
    type, of the kind created by Alfred Roller.\r\n\r\nHere are some more typefaces
    in a similar vein:\r\nhttp://www.identifont.com/list?3+Mojo+0+RU+1+1WC0+2+PF8+2+PF9+2+HYB+2+34L+2+ART+2+ARU+2+ARV+2+83C+2+5HJ+2+F7M+2+5GG+2+CAN+8+CVZ+24+HYI+24+HYD+24+2GOD+24+248Y+24+O3+24+IE8+24+I8+24+EX+24+1WDE+24+1WG8+24+1WHK+24+1WE4+24+1WCA+24+1WHS+24+7IK+24"

  body: "Thanks all. \r\n\r\nInteresting how close some of these are. \r\n\r\nThis
    was actually a request put to me by a friend who is writing a thesis so hopefully
    the above information (Art Nouveau/Secessionist-era) will be what he is looking
    for. \r\n\r\nI'd ended up looking at Alfred Roller when searching myself but found
    myself moving further off the path than with the 60's reincarnates. "
