  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello everybody,
Right now I'm designing an academic online magazine, and I'm looking for 
1) an Arabic font to pair with Gill Sans for headlines (light) and sub-heads (reg)
2) an Arabic font to pair with a humanist serif like Scala (it must be a font that supports Greek) in the long copy.

I've been doing some research, and came across some stuff that I liked, but I know really only a little bit about Arabic typography (I'm really not a typography specialist anyway), so I thought I'd try to get some professional's opinion (besides my partner's, whom I'll pester with my questions tonight, too). 
I especially enjoyed reading this discussion: http://typophile.com/node/92658
Since the academic project is about research in different medieval cultures, I definitely want to avoid a "latinized" Arabic font by all means.

I started out with the Quadraat – which I love – for the logo and headlines (sans) and long copy (serif), and the client liked it for the long copy, but settled for the Gill as headline font – which is also fine with me. 
Then it turned out that they'll have Greek and Arabic words in headlines and text every now and then, so I have to change the text font as well to support Greek. I think Scala will do fine – it's long texts that will be read online as well as printed out on desktop printers.

Any suggestions? Also, if you have any other suggestions for the Latin fonts, I'm open to that as well.

Cheers!

		<div class="commentbody">Unfortunately there are not many good options when it comes to low contrast Arabic typeface. If I were commissioned to the task I would choose myriad arabic. In my opinion it's the only one which is drawn respectfully to the arabic script esthetics. You might say that Gill sans is a geometric design compared to myriad but I can't really suggest you a better option.

It looks good to me, but is it really the only one? :(
I was looking at some of Pascal Zoghbi's fonts but I guess the Azer is too "playful" (for the lack of a better word)...
Do you have any suggestions for the long copy? Again, I was looking at Pascal's work and thinking of the Seria (only for the arabic though, I don't really care for the latin Seria), combined with sth like Scala, or the Eskorte or Nassim? Hmmmm, it is so hard!
Are you working on fonts right now? I really like the Harir, and the Lava to go with it :)

		<div class="commentbody">Azer is too playful (also Seria) I agree. It also depends who is going to read it because Persian taste is a bit different form Arabic taste. Jana seems latinized to me. For body text these could work: Nassim and Adobe Arabic. Eskorte is a bit loud for running text.</div>

I think it will mostly be read by medievalists interested in international medieval cultures, in English. Not exactly design or typography nerds, mostly, I guess ;) 
I will probably suggest Nassim/Scala and maybe Harir/Lava, too. And for the headlines the Myriad Arabic. The client suggested Noto (Google Fonts), I guess I'll play with the Gill and the Arabic Noto and see how it looks...

I can suggest my just-released AlQuds Arabic fonts originally inspired by Gill Sans and his book on Typography, but took a life of their own.
