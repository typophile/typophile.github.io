  to finish it properly. the characters  <BR>were drawn using only straight lines.
  <BR> <BR>in my opinion, the lowercase and figures are  <BR>fine, but the uppercase
  still needs some work.  <BR>what do you think? <BR> <BR>any comments and critics
  are welcome! ;&#41; <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/7666.gif"

  body: 'It&#39;s nice, Eduardo. I suppose that you&#39;re aware of     <BR>Peter
    Verheul&#39;s Newberlin, that also uses straight lines     <BR>only. But I find
    your Maest more interesting. I agree     <BR>that there&#39;s a crispness in the
    lc that the UC is     <BR>lacking somewhat. Some of its characters could be a
    bit     <BR>narrower, the bowls of P and R a little smaller.    <BR>    <BR>I&#39;m
    not sure whether the sort of variation in the spacing     <BR>rhythm that you
    have here was intentional or not. For     <BR>instance: how letters seem to coalesce
    in &#39;qua&#39;, only to     <BR>disperse again in &#39;scele&#39; &#40;and especially
    in &#39;ss&#39; ;&#41;. This     <BR>&#34;elastic&#34; behaviour may bother some
    people &#40;not me&#41;.    <BR>    <BR>One possible problem that I see is that
    in smaller settings     <BR>the &#39;n&#39; could be mistaken for an &#39;u&#39;.
    Also, there may be     <BR>a problem in certain cases with the gap created by     <BR>the
    &#39;c&#39; in some combinations &#40;like ci, ct&#41;. But generally     <BR>it
    will work, I think.    <BR>    <BR>abra'

    but my main critic is the bottom of your lc &#34;c&#34; and &#34;e&#34;, i think
    it should be more extended, at small sizes it looks to weak to me. <BR> <BR>for
    me maest its much better than newberlin, here the beautifull contradiction betwen
    straight lines and the cursive type is more evident. <BR> <BR>CG

  body: Nice. I enjoy the irregularity and think it too many of the characters conformed
    to the same rules it wouldn&#39;t have the same flavor at all. If anything I would
    think it would be good to have alternates for the characters so that the user
    could keep this irregularity more consistant. For instance in your paragraph it
    seems that some of the words have the first few character aligned on the baseline
    and then the last few fall off. It might be nicer if there really was a consistant
    up and down or at least irregualar action/flow of line.

    legible:  <BR>anyone can tell which one is n and which one is u. in  <BR>the word
    &#34;confusion&#34;, where [u=n], we have  <BR>ambiguity, but we are still able
    to read and  <BR>understand it. <BR> <BR>in the actual font, n differs from u,
    but i guess for  <BR>some people it is too close to their own &#34;self- <BR>conscious&#34;
    image of an u. that&#39;s why rodolfo pointed  <BR>it in &#34;Ninfa&#34;. in the
    other hand, as we know, reading  <BR>is not a fully &#34;conscious&#34; task,
    and that&#39;s why i think  <BR>the original n/u works. it will work even better
    in  <BR>small &#40;text&#41; sizes, as sean commented before,  <BR>probably because
    reading it requires less visual  <BR>&#34;consciousness&#34; than reading in bigger

    &#34;trap&#34; words where  <BR>&#62;this glyph could be read either way and see
    what  <BR>&#62;they make of them. Do the same thing with young,  <BR>&#62;competent

    have tested nothing. A Latin sample text  <BR>or a series of isolated words aren&#39;t
    testing anything. &#40;And  <BR>&#34;opinions&#34; or the lack of &#34;complaints&#34;
    are useless.&#41; You have  <BR>to have a true text sample in the subjects&#39;s
    language,  <BR>something that she or he would actually read. Running the <BR>risk
    of sounding like Hrant myself, something that could be  <BR>read &#34;immersively&#34;
    &#40;though that will hardly be the case in a  <BR>test&#41;. <BR> <BR>As I think
    I have already proven, the n glyph can also <BR>stand for an u, so you&#39;d have
    to have words that explore  <BR>this ambiguity, for the test to have any interest
    and be  <BR>fun. That&#39;s were the catch is. BTW, don&#39;t think of Houaiss  <BR>as
    an example. Real-world projects, with tight deadlines,  <BR>are very often less
    open to this sort of experiment. Think  <BR>of it as testing yourself. ;&#41;

    explode mid-race and leave Agip all over... <BR> <BR>But actually the moment I
    was hooked was during the Mexico race of &#39;86. Senna put harder compound tires
    on the left than on the right, because the track was mostly right turns... And
    he won &#40;of course&#41;. Senna was different. That Donnington wet race in &#39;93
    was just alien. Anyway, the extreme technical aspect gets me. Which is why I never

    over the &#34;n&#34;.   <BR>No one commented on your second PDF - the one   <BR>with
    other versions or stages that your design  <BR>has seen.  <BR>  <BR>I think the
    caps in 2 are great! For me, they   <BR>really add to the rhythm. Look at the
    &#34;M&#34; in   <BR>&#34;Midas&#34; for instance. In 2 it flows really nice.   <BR>While
    in 4, I sort of pause when I reach it. I am  <BR>not saying 4 is is not pretty
    I just think 2 might   <BR>be a bit more consistent in expressing the   <BR>personality
    of Maest. But it really depends on what <BR>your goals are. I think you mentioned
    that you were  <BR>really trying to be disciplined in your design.  <BR>I say
    loosen up a bit and let the type face design  <BR>itself just a little bit more.
    <BR>  <BR>You could take 2 even further and create   <BR>swash characters as an
    addition. That would   <BR>be really cool! In addition this could help to  <BR>separate
    it even further from the designs that  <BR>where mentioned earlier. <BR> <BR>But
    then again 2 will raise even more legibility issues. <BR>Do the &#34;I&#34;, &#34;J&#34;,
    and &#34;T&#34; look too much alike? And then you <BR>have the whole &#34;n&#34;
    story all over again. What a story it told. <BR> <BR>I think that UC &#34;U&#34;
    would look cool and be more calligraphic  <BR>with a stem coming down the on the
    right. Like a LC. <BR>  <BR>Thanks for posting your second PDF. I really   <BR>like

    but the hardest thing is <BR>to make the other Uc characters coherent with it.
    Frankly, I <BR>don&#39;t have any idea of how to do it. Btw, that&#39;s the same  <BR>problem
    in 04. <BR>For example, &#34;A&#34; and &#34;B&#34; just don&#39;t get along.
    It seems like &#34;A&#34; is <BR>one font, and &#34;B&#34; is another. I think
    the same thing happens with <BR>other &#34;round&#34; characters, as &#34;B&#34;,
    &#34;D&#34;, &#34;P&#34;, &#34;R&#34; and &#34;S&#34;. I just need <BR>to spend
    more time on this. <BR> <BR>But I liked your idea of making swash characters.
    I&#39;ll see what <BR>I can do. ;&#41;
