    You have to fill out a form, but they distribute the font.

  body: Interesting, because the face reminds one &#40;or at least me&#41; of the
    block lettering so commonly found on college sports uniforms &#40;you could easily
    envision &#39;OHIO STATE&#39; in this face&#41;. <BR> <BR>Seems fairly radical
    of GQ, who, it goes without saying, is a setter of ultra-fashionable trends in
    the world of men&#39;s clothing.  Not that the face is bad or anything.
