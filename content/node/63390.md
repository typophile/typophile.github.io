    (so far) were [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/arroyostyle/syracuse/|Syracuse]]
    from Woodside Graphics, [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/hihretrofonts/larisch/|Larisch]]
    from HiH, LetterPerfect's [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/letterperfect/kolo/|Kolo]],
    and ComicCraft's [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/comicraft/grande-guignol/|Grand
    Guignol Display]] (lower case).\r\n\r\nOddly, [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-benguiat-gothic/|Benguiat
    Gothic]] also has a similar feel.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
