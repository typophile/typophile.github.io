  it for a community site? Do you think there would be sufficient interest? And, how
  would I go about doing this?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Are you looking for technical advice or general suggestions?\r\n\r\nIn short:
    I think the interest would be in what you make of it, to get it done you need
    a vision and somebody who can design & develop the vision you have. You also need
    to do some research & see what is already out there and judge where the bar is
    at and how you can blow it out of the water, make it legendary...\r\n\r\nThe idea
    sounds cool, but you have to own the vision.\r\n\r\nThe devils in the details
    and part of creating something new is deciding what you want others to experience.
    The tools you use are nearly irrelevant to the purpose, reason and usability of
    the site. Anything on the web is possible with a lot of different systems. Free
    & opensource tools are often the best way to go."
