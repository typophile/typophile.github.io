  find anything. I think the search form isn't really working.\r\n\r\nAnyhow... \r\nSo!
  I'm looking for books to learn more about type, about lettering and that sort of
  thing.\r\nWhat books are there that seem interesting? \r\n\r\nSomeone on another
  topic (I think Chris) told me about these http://www.doyaldyoung.com/books.html
  which seem pretty interesting (but really expensive by the way). I have some books
  that I'll post later."

    concerning):\r\n- Left-handed Calligraphy by Vance Studley\r\n- A Book of Scripts
    by Alfred Fairbank\r\n- A Renaissance Alphabet by Giovanni Francisco Cresci\r\n-
    Tipografia by Paulo Heitlinger (http://tipografos.net/livro.html a book that goes
    by the story and the basics of typography)\r\n\r\nBy the way, where do you buy
    used books?"

    don't try. :-/  From that other thread*:\r\n\"\r\nBTW, I managed to dig up that
    \"Left-Handed Calligraphy\" book (Vance Studley, a 1991 Dover facsimile of the
    1979 edition) and the inconsistencies I see here are reflected there as well.
    By turns you read things like \"With a little effort, you can learn to letter
    with the broad-edged pen as well as the right-hander\", followed not far afterwards
    by things like \"the left-handed person is kept at a disadvantage\" and \"It is
    an altogether different way of tackling the problem and must be seen from this
    other point of view\". Every passage contains a \"sure, no problem\" followed
    by a \"it's really different\". Very unnerving, and it leaves the impression that
    the nasty truth is being obscured.\r\n\"\r\n\r\n* http://typophile.com/node/48843?page=1\r\n\r\nBuying:
    Unless it's a must-own I first check the UCLA libraries to see if I can save the
    money; then I check bookfinder.com .\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    I've already seen that book but I think it's kind of a book to buy when you have
    all the others. It's a good book but as a complementary don't you think? I still
    don't even have the Elements of Typographic Style!\r\n\r\njason: Love your collection!
    I guess I'll try and find some of those. Still establishing a book priority or

    I got both of mine for free so I don't know if I would be willing to spend my
    own money for them.

    Bell, 9-point Times and Van Dijck looked in the old days than the digital versions
    do now. (Except for Romulus, I don't think the other faces are presented so well,
