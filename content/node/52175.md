  I own a web design company. \r\n\r\nI have some shapes in my head, I know I will
  probably get slated for this, but at the minute, the closest I can find is actually
  the logo for a bank:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.barclaycard.co.uk/_images/header/logo_alt.gif\r\n\r\nI
  believe the type is a custom font, by the bloke who made Arial of all people. Anyway,
  what I like about it is that it is both curvy, yet not too playful, gets that's
  the sort of thing I am looking for.\r\n\r\nCan anyone make any suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks"
