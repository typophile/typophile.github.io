  proud of my newest creation. \r\n\r\n[[http://geek-vs-life.com|Geek-vs-Life]]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pic-2_3935.png]\r\n\r\nIt's
  not flashy at all, but the underlying PHP code is unique. It's designed as a \"newspaper\"
  theme, with two columns on the main page that alternate even and odd posts. (That's
  the unique part. Anyone see that before?)\r\n\r\nIt's still a work in progress,
  since I'm not the most humongous expert at CSS hacks to get this to work well in
  IE, etc.\r\n\r\nIf anyone is willing to help me fix the CSS, I'll hook you up with
  the custom Wordpress theme code!"

    this or know how to fix it without re-working the entire page?"

  body: My solution for the dreaded IE Box Model bug is to set up a frame div with
    your width/height and no padding or margins. I can then place a div inside with
    the necessary padding applied. Some like to use the _height/_width hacks but I
    try to keep it as valid as possible.

  body: "\"Internet Explorer doesn\u2019t \u201Cdo\u201D margins and padding very
    well\"\r\n\r\nIn the past, I'd double-wrap all containers (like Ken describes).
    So, I'd have div#outerwrapper and div#innerwrapper\r\n\r\nI'd position outerwrappers
    and give padding/margin to innerwrappers\r\n\r\nbut, that can bloat your markup.\r\n\r\nThese
    days, I just add IE conditional comments and load an extra style sheet for IE6
    and then IE5.5\r\n\r\nI design it so it looks great/works in IE7/Firefox, then
    open it in IE6 and figure out which items need negative padding/margins for IE6
    to render it right.\r\n\r\nI find it a lot more flexible mainly because it lets
    me keep my HTML and main CSS file completely free of crazy IE hacks."
