    No idea where it's from. Google turned up nothing useful.\r\n\r\n(N.B.: It's \"hover\"
    not \"hoover.\" Hoover is something they do to rugs in the UK.)"

  body: "Mark, In the back of the Big Yellow (FontBook) are a series of  FUSE experimental
    font sets that are numbered 1 through 17. Apparently each FUSE set had a theme.
    FUSE 7 is 'Crash' and had fonts by Tobias Frere-Jones, Neville Brody and 3 other
    designers. Nothing in FUSE 7 looks like the bitmap font that shows up when you
    hover over the images on the posted page. \r\n\r\nI guess the conclusion is that
    FUSE 7 is not the same as 'Fuse Seven Complete'. It seemed like a promising connection.
    Sigh.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Apparently not. That's why I guessed that the 'Fuse' name was a coincidence.
    I went and looked through all 32 pages of Bitmap fonts at DaFont.com and didn't
    see any that duplicated this, although several were reasonably close. That might
    be worth doing, if a similar bitmap font would be OK.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
