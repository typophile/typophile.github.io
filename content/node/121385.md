body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nMy friend has a connection to this out-of-print book and is
  hoping to recreate it. At a glance it looked like some form of Caslon, but Identifont
  says Poliphilus (pretty sure it's wrong) and WhatTheFont says Laurentian (closer).
  I'd also like some hints as to how to find the printer's ornament (if at all possible).

  body: Wow, that's very close -- my only hesitation is that I think the Q's tail
    is shorter. I'll ask my friend to find a capital Q and send it over. Thanks!

  body: Now that you've amazingly solved the mystery... Any idea how to find the chapter
    header ornament? I could always try to repro in Illustrator, but it would be cool
    if it were findable. :)

  body: Printed in 1961 in the UK, it was probably set in Monotype, and the decoration
    is most likely a Monotype border. Monoytpe printed [[http://wolfsonianfiulibrary.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/87-1273-19-1_000b.jpg|catalogues
    of their borders]], and you can research to see if you can find one that matches
    your friend's book. But since the border seems to be a fairly simple herringbone
    pattern, it might be easier to take a good scan and trace it in Illustrator.

      enjoy his discovery of typography for a while before I trace it in Illustrator.  :D
