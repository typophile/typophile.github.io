  it was feathers and reeds. I think I can see an influence on drawing techniques
  & styles around this time that could be attributed to the tougher, springier nature
  of steel.\r\n\r\nDumb question maybe, but, is there a corresponding influence of
  the steel pen nib on calligraphy, and by extension, extrapolation or stylistic influence
  or whatever on type design?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n "

    influence than the shape of the nib. Why I wonder about the dates is that the
    style of lettering that we associate most strongly with the development of the
    steel nib (specifically the flexible, pointed steel nib) originated a hundred
    years earlier, in the early 18th century."

    of the early 19th century.\r\nIf one makes the case for technological determinism,
    it must surely have occurred primarily at the print works and the foundry, with
    the technology behind the Didone style being harder steel, smoother paper, blacker
    inks, and greater precision (\"high res\" as we would term it today). In general,
    engineering precision was ramped up considerably at that time. Henry Maudslay
    had produced a bench micrometer with an accuracy of one ten-thousandth of an inch,
    in 1810. Type foundries were engineering works, more a part of the high-tech world
    of business and manufacturing than connected to the writing master.\r\nSo it's
    unlikely that a change in pen tech would have had a special influence on foundry
    work--also considering that there were new styles of lettering emerging in signage
    (e.g. the sans serif) and the new medium of lithography (illustrative lettering,
    e.g. pictures of words that looked like they were made out of tree branches) to
    contend with. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: '[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nib_(pen)|As explained in this Wikipedia article]],
    the pointed quill pen started to be used in the seventeenth century. By the mid-eighteenth
    century type styles began to be influenced by it, starting with Baskerville. The
    improvement in steel, they say, enabled production of pointed steel pens, which
    no doubt further promoted the styles of writing done with the pointed pen. '
