body: I was wondering what the size of one hint is. Looking at the ruler in Fontlab
  while hinting at 12PPM I think one hint has a point size of 83. Is there a way to
  calculate the exact hint size at any given PPM?

    must be somekind of connection between the PPM size and the size of one hint.
    I'm almost certain that one hint at 12PPM is 83pt.\r\nThere must be a calculation
    formula out there which tells me the point size of a hint at 13PPM, 14PPM and
    so on.\r\n\r\nCan someone shed some light on this?"

  body: "What kind of hints are you talking about? I'm guessing that you're talking
    about delta hints, which have particular \u2018strength\u2019 expressed as a fraction
    of a pixel. In FontLab, all deltas are expressed in 1/8th of a pixel, with the
    maximum strength for any individual delta being one pixel.\r\n\r\n[You can shift
    things more than one pixel by combining medial and final deltas. In VTT, you can
    define the strength of deltas, so it is possible to shift by more than a pixel
    with a single delta or to use a smaller refinement than 1/8th of a pixel. When
    using deltas for fonts in black and white rendering, it is typical for many hinters
    to move things by whole pixels; whereas, witg greyscale rendering one can use
    smaller delta hints to \u2018paint\u2019 shades of grey. ClearType by default
    ignores x-direction deltas, because otherwise fonts hinted for black and white
    environments would get messed up. This is not an ideal solution to the problem!]\r\n\r\nNow,
    if what you want to know is the relationship of the strength of a delta hint at
    a particular ppm size to a measurement in points, then you need to know the resolution
    of the output device, because you need to know at what nominal point size that
    ppm size will be used.\r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure that whatever calculation you used
    to conclude that \u2018one hint at 12PPM is 83pt\u2019 is really badly wrong.
    Consider: a delta strength is less than or equal to one pixel at any ppm size;
    ergo, at 12ppm a delta is up to 1/12th of the nominal point size at which that
    12ppm size is used. It would be an incredibly low resolution device at which 83pt
    = 1/12 of the nominal point size for a 12ppm bitmap."

  body: "I think my question is far more simpler. If you look at a monitor at 96DPI
    and you see a type 1 hint in Fontlab, you can calculate the width of this hint
    by using the ruler or Meter panel. If a hint at 12PPM is 83 points and at 13PPM
    77 points in width what would it be at 14PPM and so on?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/How

  body: Um. This depends entirely on the scaling factor in your FontLab hinting window,
    and I suppose if the scaling value is consistent you can work out how large the
    actual width of a pixel at any given ppm size, in points or any other measurement.
    But what possible use is this information? You do understand, yes, that this doesn't
    actually relate to anything outside of the FL hinting window?
