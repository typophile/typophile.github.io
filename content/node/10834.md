body: People of Fontos, <BR>Can anyone recommend a good utility/ fine bit of software
  for extensive kerning. Currently I&#39;m using notepad! I&#39;m working on a font
  that has waaaaaaaay to many kerning pairs and I want to largely reduce that number.
  <BR>Fontlab is good for this. However I still want absolute control over which pairs
  stay and which go. - Some how it chooses an internal list and ditches most of the
  a-z pairs and keeps the brackets and hyphens. Not what I need. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif"
  ALT=":-&#40;" BORDER=0> <BR>So far, the best thing I&#39;ve found is to edit the
  metrics by hand in notepad. But there has gotta be something easier/better than
  this. Or <BR>is there? <BR> <BR>Incidentally If anyone can point out any kerning
  lists, either with words - like gym, wyvern - things like that, or kerning pairs
  - like <a href="http://typophile.com/downloads/kerning_pairs_1.0.txt" target="_blank">http://typophile.com/downloads/kerning_pairs_1.0.txt</a>
  then I will be very grateful. Thank you. <BR>

    Don&#39;t know much about notepad. Basically, I just use technically good fonts
    for text work &#40;and rely on their kerning pairs&#41; but manually kern the
    crap out of display. <BR> <BR>Gerald <BR> <BR>
