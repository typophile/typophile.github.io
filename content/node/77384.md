  body: Olsen is a stong, chunky text face, so you could use a quite bold and expressive
    display face -- and the field is wide open -- without overpowering it. Have some
    fun, look at some interesting new designs, and pick something with a strong personality
    that appeals to you.

  body: Maybe it just means I'm too easily suggestible, but I think Condor (the current
    Featured Face) could work well.

  body: 'Nick''s answer is good. There are just too many options and I can''t narrow
    it down without knowing more about the subject matter. Who is in the club? Where
    are they based? What kinds of photos do they take? What years does the history
    represent? '

  body: "@Nick and Stephen, you guys couldn't be more right, I has to be a quite bold
    and expressive typeface to go well with Olsen. Thanks for the advice.\r\n@Eliason
    I'll try that, but I have to say I'm not really into Condor.\r\n\r\nThanks everyone.
    :)"
