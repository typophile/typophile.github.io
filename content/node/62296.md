body: "Paveline is one of Greater Albion's forthcoming new releases.  It might best
  be described as a \u2018punctuated\u2019-or if you like not joined up-script.  A
  physicist friend suggested \u2018quantum script\u2019-in the sense of coming in
  discrete glyphs but with thought that might be a joke to far!\r\n\r\nIn any event,
  it derives from a stylised adaptation of our own chief designer\u2019s handwriting
  and a high resolution preview can be seen [[http://gatf.wordpress.com | here on
  our blog.]] "
