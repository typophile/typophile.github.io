body: "Hi all, I am brand new here and have a question for you seasoned typographers
  about punctuation. When setting type in a paragraph that has a \u2122 or \xAE symbol
  followed by punctuation, do you:\r\n\r\nA) Tuck the punctuation beneath the trademark
  symbol, while trying to avoid making the punctuation appear to be part of the trademark;
  or\r\n\r\nB) Set the punctuation AFTER the \u2122 or \xAE?\r\n\r\n\r\nI have heard
  of it done both ways and want to settle this bit of arcanery once and for all! Thanks
  in advance for any/all input.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nM@"

  body: I set the punctuation after, the proper location, but do tighten up the spacing
    a bit.

  body: Between the symbol and the punctuation, after the punctuation, or both? My
    boss, a typographer with 20+ years experience, has always told us to tuck the
    punctuation, but now I've been hearing from respectable sources that your way
    is the right way.

  body: "He keeps going and going and going\u2122.\r\n\r\nI mean punctuation after
    the symbol, but then you can tighten the spacing up a bit. Otherwise the punctuation
    will look like it is part of the TM. No?"

  body: Hehe. That is not a reflection on you or me. It was just the first one which
    I thought of...

  body: "Clever example ;)\r\n\r\nSo then, am I understanding that you would basically
    left-align the outer edge of the punctuation with the outer edge of the \u2122
    or \xAE?  Visually align it, I mean."

  body: It would depend upon the typeface, type size, etc. This is an exercise in
    visual judgment...basically.
