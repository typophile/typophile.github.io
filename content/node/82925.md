  points at a document that indicates \u0110\u0111 (0110, 0111) is used for Frisian.\r\n\r\nThis
  was new to me. \r\nUnicode chart annotations don\u2019t hint at this. A quick search
  in the web revealed next to nothing.\r\nDoes anyone know something about it?"

    dialects use \xF0.\r\nSo it could be that either StAGN or some Wikipedia contributor
    didn't knew the difference between \u0110\u0111 and \xD0\xF0."
