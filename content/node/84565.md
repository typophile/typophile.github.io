  in identifying this version of what I think is Futura. \r\nThis would have been
  printed in the 1960's. It seems like it would be Futura book but there doesn't seem
  to be the points on the M and W. Possibly this definition was lost in printing?
  \r\nIf anyone has any ideas that would be great, as I am trying to match this label
  perfectly with the correct typeface. \r\n\r\nCheers, \r\nJosh\r\n"

    For an oz-sign from the sixties TC makes more sense than F. Right?"
