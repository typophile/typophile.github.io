  system.\r\n\r\nThe Arventa typeface system is available in two families, that complete
  each other in a pleasant way, the Sans and the Slab family. Arventa Sans was the
  basis for the system, but the Slab is not just a Sans with sticking Serifs. Arventa
  Slab is delicately crafted form the outlines of the Sans. The Arventa design is
  a mixture of geometric and humanistic forms and elements to serve the demands of
  higher legibility. When it comes to classic, constantly, high legible forms, both
  Arventa designs are a perfect match.\r\n\r\nEvery Arventa family offers seven weights
  (Thin, Light, Regular, Medium, Bold, Black & UltraBlack) including the Italics.
  Every single font spans a glyph range of over 1000 letters, reliable developed after
  the GTF-UNI-Standard. Every font supports extended Latin, Cyrillic and Greek alphabets,
  small caps, various numerals (tabular and proportional), scientific numerals, fractions
  \u2013 all accessible by common OpenType features.\r\n\r\nThe Arventa typeface system
  provides all you need to do great typography.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.germantype.com/arventa\r\nhttp://issuu.com/preusstype/docs/gtf_arventa_02\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/arventa_gtf_news5_5109.gif]"
