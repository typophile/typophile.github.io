    you can\u2019t beat <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/products/fontcds/bitstream_type_odyssey_2/\">Bitstream
    Type Odyssey</a>. You can also get most of these for even less money by purchasing
    an old copy of Corel Draw, which used to include almost everything in the Bitstream
    library."
