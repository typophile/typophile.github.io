  our company bought a font (well actually we payed for it when we hired a graphic
  designer, now we are trying to install the font he used for our brand identity on
  our mac but with no luck...hope someone here can help.\r\n\r\nthese are all kinds
  of files in the folder:\r\n\r\n- .AFM files \r\n- a file that has a black icon with
  in the corner saying \"exec\"\r\n- there is also something in there with .lst at
  the end\r\n- and a file with a .bmap extension.\r\n\r\ni tried everything, clicking
  on the exec file then a terminal window goes open saying \"process completed\"\r\nI
  tried dragging all files in the \"library - fonts\" folder ...start up indesign
  but the fonts didn't show up...\r\nwhen i click on the .bmap file, font explorer
  opens saying \"no fonts imported\" no fonts found in selected files or folders.\r\n\r\ncould
  someone plays say what we are doing wrong here, pretty please!! :D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: ".bmap is not a Windows file, it's a bitmap cache representation of the 'real'
    font. The AFM file is useless on its own, and so is the .lst file (that is not
    a part of a standard Type 1 Font distribution and can be <em>anything</em>).\r\n\r\nYou
    cannot use the .bmap font in InDesign because that needs <em>real</em> fonts,
    not just bitmaps. It might work in other programs, though -- I dunno, always avoided
    them like the proverbial plague.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering about the untyped file --
    OS X doesn't know what it is, so it presumes it's an 'executable', but you can
    be pretty sure it's not one. Can you open it with, say, Textedit, and see if it
    contains readable data, or just a jumble of strange characters?\r\n\r\nIf it starts
    with something akin' to\r\n\r\n%PS-AdobeFont 3.0\r\n%% All rights reserved bladibladibla\r\n%%
    Some more stuff...\r\n\r\nit's the one file type I'm missing from your list, and
    you can try again after adding the proper .PFB extension to it."

  body: "It's possible that you have a Mac PostScript Type 1 font in which the resource
    fork has been unintentionally stripped out of the .bmap file. Mac screen font
    files often have that file extension. A Mac Type 1 font can't be used on a Mac
    if the screen font file is missing or corrupt. \r\n\r\nIf you \"get info\" on
    the .bmap file, what is the file size? If it's 0k (zero k), then the .bmap file
    has become corrupted. This can happen when emailing or ftp'ing Mac font files
    without first compressing them."

    indeed zero file size, mmmm so i guess the fonts on the cd the designer gave us
    don't work. I'm going to contact him, so i should tell him to compress them first,
    is using zip ok?"

    specific program/version; the zip utility included with MacOS X should do fine.
    \r\n\r\nStuffit compression ([[http://www.stuffit.com/]]) handles Mac resource
    forks more reliably. "

  body: Starting with Mac OS 10.3, the Finder includes compression, under the File
    menu as "Compress (whatever is selected)", or if you right click on a folder or
    file. This will create a .zip file. If you compress a Mac file with a resource
    fork (such as an old style Mac screen font file), it will be preserved when the
    file is decompressed on another Mac. No need for StuffIt unless you or the other
    party are using a version of the OS older than 10.3.

  body: Isn't the exec mean its a Windows compressed file that will not work on mac?
    Sounds like you need to get ahold of the company from whom you purchased it and
    explain that you need a Mac compatible version. I think if you already paid they
    would be happy to correct the situation.

    the file with the \".lst\" extension is added to font folders by certain Adobe
    apps (maybe just Acrobat). It is not part of the font. More like preference or
    cache file used by Adobe."
