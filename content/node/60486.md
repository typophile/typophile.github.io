body: "How do you feel about breaking the baseline grid in a more complex table of
  contents?\r\n\r\nI've come across such a situation and have tried different solutions,
  yet it always seems to work best when I add some diversity and am in turn forced
  to break the grid. Since tables of contents often require more detailed control
  than the main text, I presume it's OK to design them a bit differently while still
  following the main established design principles."

    levels and number of titles, but I'm getting close.\r\n\r\nI'll attach a sample.
    Please note that this is just a working copy so there are still some minor incongruities
    left."

  body: "I think it works (but the visible grids make rather difficul judging).\r\nAnother
    option is setting a narrower (half the height) baseline grid on which accomodate
    both larger and smaller text."

  body: "There's nothing at all wrong with breaking the grid on a TOC. I do it all
    the time. The earlier suggestion about using a grid that is half the line advance
    of the text is a good place to start.\r\n\r\nI'd also suggest that you pull the
    column of page numbers to the left so there is about 1.5 to 2 ems only from the
    end of the longest line to the page numbers. That will lessen the overall gap
    between titles and page numbers (Berry mentions this as not always very good looking;
    he's right].\r\n\r\npowers"

    is aligned.

  body: "I think it's more important that the TOC be legible and look good than adhere
    to the baseline grid. You are likely the only one who will know it doesn't! I
    design books for a living and have never bothered much with aligning the TOC to
    the baseline grid. Make sure it's consistent in terms of sink or align the last
    line to the bottom and you'll be fine.\r\n\r\nI don't like that the spacing above
    the chapter titles is inconsistent. I see too much space above \"Kro\u017Eenje
    v r azpad\""

    I have yet to check the tracking, too. But it's a start and I'll work on it.\r\n\r\n<cite>&gt;
    I don\u2019t like that the spacing above the chapter titles is inconsistent. I

    I've fixed it already.\r\n\r\nThank you all for the input!\r\n"
