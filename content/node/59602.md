body: "I've contacted tech support, but am in a crunch so I'll post here to see if
  someone has seen and fixed this.\r\n\r\nTwo days ago, my copy of FL5 went berserk.
  It launches, but all the palettes are missing as well as the main menu at the top.
  The only main menu item is Fontlab Studio and there is no \"open\" \"save\" etc.
  Only the standard Show Hide Quit that comes with OSX. I access the app from another
  user on the same machine, and the menu is there, and it appears to work, but saving
  and generating fonts doesn't work (this is the full version of FL mind you).\r\n\r\nI've
  deleted the app. Downloaded a fresh copy, installed with my serial and still have
  the same problem.\r\n\r\nSo I'm thinking something might have happened with python.
  I didn't do anything strange to start this (eg. didn't install a new macro or something).\r\n\r\nAt
  the moment I'm limping along on a laptop from 2001 so any help would be much appreciated!"

    you try using some deinstaller app? It sounds like you might need to clear out
    stuff from your system that your uninstall didn't catch."

    seem to be stored in there. I've had some similar trouble in the past and I believe
    this is what worked.\r\n\r\nYour workspace file is here:\r\n\r\n<code>Macintosh

    that helps...\r\nAndy"

  body: Hmm wish I had tried just the workspaces idea before I killed all the app
    support. Oh well. Things are now fixed. Thanks all for your advice!

    similar problems for me in the past.

  body: "In this context a tip for users of the Windows version of FontLab, but maybe
    there is a comparable way on the Mac:\r\n\r\n1. Install the app.\r\n2. Install
    all macros, you need.\r\n3. Reduce the three main directories, that FontLab uses,
    to the installation directory; put them together! (Correct the paths in the options
    dialog of FontLab.)\r\n4. Export the registry keys, in which the paths are stored
    and create a reg file, that removes all the rest, FontLab has stored in your registry.\r\n5.
    Make a backup of the FontLab installation directory.\r\n\r\nIf you have trouble
    next time, you have your backup and your reg file.\r\n\r\nAdditionally export
    your favorite options from the options dialog of FontLab. That\u2019s likewise
    a reg file.\r\n\r\nI have two backups: One with and one without macros."

  body: 'Nina, no worries, thank you for your advice which worked! I had backed up
    my macro and encoding folders before scrubbing so it was an easy fix. Sounds like
    it would make sense to optimize my workspace and then back that up too for the
    next berserkery. Thanks Y''all, case closed and back to work! '

  body: "Randy, in cases where using a different user account solves a problem one
    has with an app, the culprit can be found in corrupt/damaged preferences.\r\nAnother
    way to test this is dragging the preferencefile (.plist) to the desktop and restarting
    the app in question.\r\nFor my main apps I routinely make backups of the preference
    files when everything functions well (because setting up these can be quite a
    hassle) \u2014 or, since the introduction of Time Machine, as a shortcut reinstating
    the oldest plist available. (The first method is better, of course)\r\n\r\n. .
