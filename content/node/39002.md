body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nI need help with the AFDK tools.\r\n\r\nI have been \"designing\"
  fonts for about a half year in FontLab, and I have some work finished (sort of)
  now, and ready for testing.\r\n\r\nI downloaded the AFDKO and installed the software
  with the \"FinishInstallOSX\" dropped into the Terminal.\r\n\r\nMy problem is basic...
  I don't know how to use Terminal well enough to use the tools now that I have them.
  I need the five-minute tutorial from someone who might have been through this already.
  Specifically, I need help with the checkOutlines routine.\r\n\r\nWhere to I put
  the path to the font I want to check?\r\n\r\n(and that sort of thing)\r\n\r\nThank
  you in advance.\r\n\r\nBrian\r\n"

  body: "Hi Brian,\r\n\r\nIf you already gone through the step of installing the tools
    and all went, it's actually quite simple to use them. In the case of checkOutlines,
    just open a Terminal window and type <code>checkOutlines -h </code> for getting
    the Help, or <code>checkOutlines -u </code> for information about Usage.\r\n\r\ncheckOutlines
    can operate on Type 1 fonts (.pfa or .ps) and on OpenType CFF fonts (.otf). To
    check a font file located on your Desktop you can type something like this: <code>checkOutlines
    /Users/your_username_here/Desktop/YourFont.otf</code>\r\nSome messages will appear
    on the Terminal window, and a file named checkOutlines.log will be created on
    the Desktop containing them.\r\n\r\nCheck these PDFs to get some more info about
    other AFDKO tools:\r\nhttp://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/typotechnica2007/TypoTechnica2007_StateOfTheArt_Font_QE.pdf\r\nhttp://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/typotechnica2007/QE_Outputs.pdf\r\n"
