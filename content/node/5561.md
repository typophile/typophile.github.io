body: 'Hey. <BR> <BR>I have just made this font. &#40;Petrograd&#41; <BR> <BR>I have
  a couple of weights and styles: <BR>-Regular <BR>-Bold <BR>-Regular Osf <BR>-Regular
  Monospaced <BR> <BR>The problem is when I make the font files and  <BR>activate
  them in ATM, only one weight/style  <BR>shows up in my programs. <BR> <BR>I have
  convinced myself that this is because  <BR>of the &#34;font info&#34; being entered
  in a wrong way. <BR> <BR>Can you help me with this? &#40;if this is indeed  <BR>the
  core of the problem&#41; <BR> <BR>In fontlab the info page looks like this: <BR>
  <BR>Family Name:  <BR>Weight:  <BR>Widht: <BR>Style Name:  <BR>Font Name:  <BR>Full
  Name: <BR>Menu Name: <BR>Fond Name: <BR> <BR>I just can&#39;t seem to figure this
  out correctly. <BR>How should I fill this out in the right way? <BR> <BR>Thanks
  <BR> <BR>Magnus'

  body: Perhaps it&#39;s a problem with how you&#39;re naming your fonts? <BR>If so,
