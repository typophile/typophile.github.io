  body: "Yes, the letters are by Frank Blokland \u2013 it says so in the back of the
    book.\r\n(The overall design isn't mentioned but may well be by Gerrit Noordzij
    who assembled the book & wrote the introduction.)\r\n\r\nHe drew the letters while
    he was a student at the KABK. There's an alphabet of similar letters on p.30 of
    the book and a few lines (roman + italic) on p.29. \r\nI don't think it was ever
    released as a typeface. The book is from 1983. His first typeface Bernadette (which
    looks a bit like this one but is bolder and has heavier serifs) is from 1985 &
    was never released digitally. "
