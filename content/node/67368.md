  typeface like this. One similar in shape to lets say an Avenir or Futura, but with
  the line through it obviously.\r\n\r\nAny help?"

    But yes, those types of fonts. In particular the \"Double Vision\" example.\r\n\r\nI
    need a link to a site that has the typeface to download."

  body: Yea, some of them tell you where to find them, others link you to a list of
    reference books (some of which published in the 70's and 80's)

  body: "Go to T-26 site, Chip\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of each sample, there is a source
    mentioned like \"Emigre\" or T-26. They are type foundries. The ones with book
    only references are non-digitized fonts for reference."

  body: Jan pointed to Mike Yanega's very fine type reference which is great at helping
    you find obscure fonts. Mike is so thorough that he includes pre-digital typefaces.
    Mike does this as a public service and he is a very nice guy. If you have problems
    with his sight, click his link and give suggestions.
