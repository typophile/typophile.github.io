body: There is a font I&#39;ve seen that is all-capped and sans-serif, with sometimes
  one &#34;leg&#34; slanted. This is usually on the M&#39;s, A&#39;s, and V&#39;s.
  It has a very disco feel to it and I believe it has been used on quite a few records
  in the 70&#39;s. I&#39;ll look for an image example, but in the meantime does this
  sound familiar to anyone?
