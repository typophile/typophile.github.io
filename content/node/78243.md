  was a bit too bleeding-edge to be of use to me at that time, I've jumped back in
  with another investigation of the now numerous webfont vendors and services available
  online. I've checked out FontDeck, Typotheque, and WebType. So far I've been avoiding
  TypeKit because I prefer a not-javascript-dependant solution.\r\n\r\nA major frustration
  for me is the seeming lack of information regarding which typefaces in a given library
  are technically suited to rendering small type across all browser platforms. I've
  basically been surfing these websites in IE6 with cleartype disabled (painful!)
  to get an idea of the worst-case-scenario for each typeface.\r\n\r\nI love the fact
  that WebType groups their offerings by intended display size, and I was very impressed
  with the performance of BentonSansRE. At Typotheque, I was impressed with Fedra
  Sans Screen. At FontDeck, I noticed that most of their own site text is crisply
  rendered in PT Sans, which ironically enough is available for free.\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone have tips on how to streamline this research/testing/font-selection process?
  Has somebody already done this work for me and published the results somewhere?
  I'd love to specify some fresh web type on an upcoming project, but at this point
  Verdana is looking pretty convenient.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nCameron"

    Google Web Font Directory there are a few that have great hinting and looks great
    even on WinXP with cleartype off at 12px, such as Droid Sans & Serif, Cousine,
    Arvo, Lato, Arimo, PT Sans, Anonymous Pro, Ubuntu, Nobile.\"\r\nCheck it out:
    http://code.google.com/webfonts\r\n\r\nAlso, the paragraph fonts from Webtype.\r\nhttp://www.webtype.com/catalog/intended/?ts=829\r\n\r\nI'm
    also sure that Type-kit have well hinted fonts, but I don't know witch ones."

  body: "I killed a couple of weeks on just that.\r\n\r\nI went through pretty much
    all Sans fonts on WebFonts, WebType, WebInk, FontSpring/FontSquirrel, FontsLive,
    FontDeck and TypeKit. There is some overlap, but ultimately the choice for 11-13px
    text sizes is very limited. I was testing on Windows XP as you did, but with ClearType
    on. My take on this is that I will detect the lack of ClearType smoothing on the
    client and provide a safe fallback font like Verdana.\r\n\r\nIn any case, here's
    the list:\r\n\r\nWebType:\r\n\r\n* Droid Sans\r\n* Franklin Gothic\r\n* Calibri\r\n*
    News Gothic\r\n\r\nFontsLive:\r\n\r\n* Segoe UI\r\n* Miramonte Pro\r\n\r\nWebInk:\r\n*
    URW Grotesk Light\r\n* Proxima Nova\r\n* Tondo Light\r\n\r\nAlso Delicious by
    Exjlibris.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nFontShop has some nice ones (FF Scala Sans Web, FF
    Dagny Web Pro, FF Meta Web), <strong>but</strong> they only sell .woff and .eot
    (meaning no support for Firefox 3.x, which is a very big deal). They also would
    tell you they have an arrangement with TypeKit to host a font if you buy it from
    them. What they do NOT tell you right away is that you will need to get a paid
    TypeKit account -or- to display a TypeKit badge on your website. Sneaky.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nIn
    the end and after much deliberation I went with Calibri.\r\n"

    The only Firefox version which supports web fonts but not WOFF is 3.5 (Fx 3.5
    has ~2% of market share)."

    Maag\u2019s font Interface (the TrueType version) looks impressive on screen.
