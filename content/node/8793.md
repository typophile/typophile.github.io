body: A shout-out to all Typophiliacs and friends in the NYC metro area. SOTA is coming
  to town on TypeCon2005 business the first week in February. There&#39;ll be an open
  townhall-style planning meeting and smaller get-togethers on the schedule. The main
  planning meetings will be held at the offices of our co-presenting partner, the
  Type Directors Club &#40;TDC&#41; on W. 25th in Manhattan.  <BR> <BR>If you&#39;re
  interested in helping with TypeCon2005 and would like to get together, please send
  me a private message and/or post here. If you can&#39;t make an in-person appearance
  this time, but would still like to be involved, let me know.

  body: Tamye et. al, <BR> <BR>I assume you have negotiated a lower rate than the
    $220 a night that the Roosevelt people are quoting me; how do I go about getting
    that? Seeing as there are several hotels within a few blocks that are MUUUCH less
    expensive, I&#39;m curious why the &#34;meeting hotel&#34; is one of the more
    expensive in the neighborhood. No criticism, don&#39;t mean to sound accusatory,
    but the flights, fancy meals I&#39;ve got planned &#40;who wants to join me at
    Les Halles, Nobu, Balthazar and Craft? Also, of course, dim sum on Saturday AM
    at New Green Bo, but that&#39;s not fancy&#41;, and the $20 to get into MoMA now
    &#40;!!&#41; might wipe me out...

  body: Joshua, you&#39;re truly an early bird. We haven&#39;t posted all the hotel
    details yet, but never fear, we did indeed negotiate a significant discount for
    TypeCon attendees. The attendee rate is $165 a night for a superior single or
    double room. Mention TypeCon and SOTA and you should receive that rate. If it
    doesn&#39;t work, please let me know, and I&#39;ll get in touch with the hotel
    right away so they start quoting the right rate. <BR> <BR>Our rate of $165 is
    really great for that time of year at a nice hotel in New York. You can add a
    3rd person to a room for $20 a night, and even a fourth for an additional $20
    if you enjoy that much togetherness ;&#41; The hotel and service is excellent.
    Trust me, we checked out tons of hotels to find the one that would give a good
    rate and be able to house all our attendees. Not to mention that it&#39;s in a
    safe and convenient neighborhood &#40;just a few steps away from Grand Central
    and a straight shot down to Parsons&#41;. I am sure that you&#39;ll be happy with
    the hotel. <BR> <BR>In addition to the awesome service and great historical feel,
    the Roosevelt has an amazing lobby and large bar area that&#39;s perfect to hang
    out in. Nice health club on premises, and high-speed internet access in the rooms.
    <BR> <BR>We&#39;ll have a roomie finder service going soon for TypeCon attendees
    looking to pair up with someone to share a room during the conference.

    alternative &#34;close by&#34;, I guess it depends on what you mean by &#34;close
    by&#34;. A few blocks away from the conference hotel, will not get you room at
    a cheaper rate.  <BR> <BR>A suggestion to those who are unable or unwilling to
    pay the $165 per night is to book your rooms in the New Jersey, Long Island or
    Connecticut suburbs and take the region&#39;s excellent mass transit system into
    the city everyday.

    but hopefully all is well now! <BR> <BR>The exact workshop schedule is not set
    yet, but the workshops will be held on Wed. and Thurs., July 20-21 &#40;same schedule
    as last year&#41;. A number of interesting half-day and full-day workshops are
    in the works. Still working on developing a few of the sessions, so please bear
    with us until we have the workshop schedule and registration details finalized.
    <BR> <BR>Please try sending another email if you have further questions about
    anything other than the workshop schedule, or feel free to post here again. <BR>
    <BR>See you in New York!?

  body: Tammye, I tried booking at the Roosevelt but the online reservation system
    does not accept as a promo code either &#34;TypeCon&#34; or &#34;SOTA&#34;. Any
    hints?

  body: Gerry, your best bet is to call the hotel directly to book your room. Sometimes
    the independents &#40;OK, the big chains, too&#41; have a hard time getting their
    online booking systems synched with discount codes for events. <BR> <BR>I believe
    their reservations lines are open from 8am-8pm Monday thru Friday &#40;East Coast
    Time&#41;. <BR> <BR>I have a call into our rep at the Roosevelt to see what insight
    he can offer regarding online booking. I&#39;ll let you know as soon as I hear
    anything.

  body: Hi Tamye, <BR> <BR>I sent you a message last month regarding volunteering/helping
    out at the conference - how can I do this and are there more meetings I can go
    to? I am in the NYC area. Thanks.
