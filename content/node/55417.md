body: "Hey guys, I'm looking for a complimentary typeface for this logo for a civil
  engineering firm. I've used Estilo for the logo but it's a bit impractical for text
  on a business card and collateral. Any suggestions on type that either resembles
  Estilo's roundness or maybe just a serif that looks nice with it?\r\n\r\nI've tried
  Bryant and it doesn't feel professional enough...\r\n\r\nThanks for the help!"

  body: "Scala Sans would work well as a textface with similar character.\r\n\r\nDepending
    on what you're going for, Minion could work nicely as a serif."

    might work. Thanks for the suggestions!

  body: I second Silica and suggest you also try some faces from the DIN-clan, like
    [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-din/medium-alternate/|DIN Medium Alternate]]
    or its rounded brother [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/din-17-sb/
    | DIN 17 SB]].
