  introduced this custom typeface for all of their in-store signage, as well as, the
  New York version of their logomark. I wondered if anyone knew anything about this
  typeface (who designed it, etc.) I think it's pretty great. I pulled this image
  off of one of their shopping bags.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Uniqlo-Typeface_4779.jpg]"
