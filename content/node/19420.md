body: "Hello all,\r\n\r\nI'm getting ready to tackle a redesign of a magazine called
  revenue. It's all about performance marketing online. Currently, Gotham (headlines)
  and Whitman (body) are used. Because the masthead uses Whitman, I will continue
  to use it for the body copy. However, I would like to freshen things up a bit and
  I'm looking for any suggestions you may have as a replacement for Gotham.\r\n\r\nThe
  revenue readers are apparently very savvy entrepeneur types. So I'm looking for
  a font that is modern, forward looking and solid...perhaps even edgy.  It also needs
  to be a fairly large family.\r\n\r\nI looked back at a previous post. In the past,
  I asked for a companion font to Whitman. Quadraat Sans, Giacomo and Malmo Sans were
  recommended. What do you think of those? Of those three I prefer Malmo Sans. I'm
  pretty sure I like it but am hoping to be pointed in a few other directions before
  I decide.\r\n\r\nSo any advice you have is greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nTamara"
