<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody> Type design seems to usually be a solitary venture (I can understand why... :-), but not always, and I wonder how teams of type designers tend to function when working on a single design. Most of the few cases where numerous designers have worked on a single font have been grunge/experimental projects (like that MetaDesign thing - I forget the name now), but I think the scenario where a small (and strongly structured - necessarily?) team works on a text face is most interesting. <br> <br>For obvious reasons, the following would be a great case-study at Typophile: <br> <br>Miller was worked on by Matthew Carter, Tobias Frere-Jones and Cyrus Highsmith. Could we possibly get some insight into the dynamics, like who did what part of the whole task, what logistical issues arose, etc.? I'm betting it could be very educational. <br> <br>hhp </div>

<div class=commentbody> I'm game, but only if it's more than just for our own entertainment. Not that the end result needs to be a highly useful font or anything, but at least the process should have some educational value. <br> <br>And remember this proverb: <br>If it takes one programmer one day to write a piece of code, it takes two programmers two days to write it... <br> <br>Not to cast an ominous cloud on this, but to me the ideal such project would involve like 10-20 designers, and take about a year.

<div class=commentbody> I'd be interested in this as well.... <br> <br>Here's a possibility, to answer Sbo's concerns: say we work on this typographic collaboration with the express intention of making it available as freeware? It could be a gift from Typophile.com community to the community at large, and promoted as a free font to increase traffic to the site? <br> <br>I'd be fine with keeping the finished product as proprietary as well, if that is the decision of the majority of respondents/collaborators. But it seems that if there are many of us contributing to the design, it might be easier (and more justifiable) to just use the finished product as a free promotion for Typophile.com. <br> <br>Thoughts? <br> <br>David </div>

<div class=commentbody>David: <br>I don't see charging any money for this (unless it's for a charity, like maybe: <a href=http://www.ifrc.org/ target=_top>http://www.ifrc.org/</a>) One reason is the nightmare of distributing the proceeds if: <br> <br>BJ: <br>I think splitting it by character could only result in a grunge font. Maybe we should do it by "task" instead, like: lc, UC, numerals, spacing, hinting, trapping, etc. We could subdivide each task, for example one person could be in charge of the serifs. <br> <br>I know this makes things more nebulous (for example, you can't *really* split up spacing from glyph design, at least not completely), but with some open-minded cooperation and effective, intelligent structuring and communication it could make the result much more compelling than some freak show. <br> <br>One thing we would all have to agree on before we commit would be overall character of the design. <br> <br>BTW, for the Single Authority I mentioned, I nominate... Jonathan Hoefler! :-) <br> <br>hhp</div>

Working off fixed 'controls' - stem widths, bowl structure, x-height - and completing key letters in UC and lc, I don't see why splitting up glyphs wouldn't work. Why not try it? It certainly amplifies the 'fun' element of the project. <br> <br>Also, just as a survey, is there anyone who likes spacing and kerning more than the process of actually building a font? <br> <br>bj </div>

<div class=commentbody> I think it might be more interesting (and workable) if one person designed the base font, another the italic, another the bold, etc. in sort of a round-robin fashion. <br> <br>I'd be very willing to try a collaboration on a single face, though, but without direct & immediate interaction, I'm not sure how that would work.

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody> To me, the most interesting thing is trying to create a nice font that's usable for display and short text, with as many people as logistically possible. Here's a rough proposal: <br> <br>1. Appoint an Overall Authority: this person will have final say in everything, without necessarily participating in the design, or even explicitly offering his/her opinion. The three qualities this person must have in abundance are: an understanding of type design; fairness; a willingness to allow -even motivate- people to make something he personally might not like. <br> <br>2. Decide the general nature of the typeface. Is it a grotesque sans, a joined script, a Garalde, what? Once this is decided, some people will want to participate in the design, and others won't. <br> <br>3. Make a list of tasks that a type designer does, with as many subdivisions as we have participants. <br> <br>4. Define the Pert-chart, which is basically the sequential dependence of the various tasks (eg: Kerning comes after Spacing). Also define how the various tasks are related (eg: the rough spacing is done by the person doing [some of] the letterforms, but the final spacing is done afterwards by somebody else; or that the person doing the Kerning has to spend some "quality time" with the guy who did the Spacing). <br> <br>5. Assign each sub-task to an individual, make sure everybody's communicating with who he/she needs to communicate with, and manage the project to completion. <br> <br>6. Become filthy rich through record sales never before seen in the font world... ;-) <br> <br>hhp </div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody> how about deciding on a sans serif grotesque and starting out with a grid like 5 x 7 or whatever? then have whoever wants to participate design lc a, g, o, m, etc. based on that grid, discuss the results and take it from there. the result could be a regular and an alternative or even two different fonts. weights from extra light to extra bold as well as italics and script and/or grunge versions could follow. this could actually go on forever, definatley a very interesting experiment. <br> <br>simon </div>

<div class=commentbody> May I suggest Erik S. as the mentor of the project? If he is still reading at typophile and would be interessted in such a role. He might even have the contacts to promote the final typeface as a gift and inspiration in the typographic "community". <br> <br>It would be great if the font in progress was online and free for download for every participants. We could each have a password that allowed us to download the latest developments ,and work on the face individually. Then each and everyone could post to a dedicated thread their improvements and ideas. That way we all could contribute as much we can. <br> <br>Maybe a sponsor would be interessted in supporting the typeface?

<div class=commentbody> Raining on your parade: <br>I can't imagine this working very well. I don't think there have been many precedents for type design by committee/collaboration of more than two people. <br>Having said that though, it might be fun for some of the participants and instructive for the organisers, and there's no harm done. So go for it! <br>My suggestion on how to start would be this: <br>Don't start from absolutely square one. Participants should throw into the hat unfinished/barely started projects that have been shelved for one reason or another. Upload samples like in the Critique Discussion area and discuss the merits of each prospect and go from there. I for one have a handful of designs with potential that I will never ever finish, and I dare say a lot of people here have good projects that they might not develop. I think this would be a far better way to get the project going than to debate sans grotesque versus serif display/whatever. <br> <br>Oh, and choose something fairly easy to start off with, otherwise there will never be a second Typophile multi-collaborative font. </div>

<div class=commentbody> > we haven't been able to turn type design into the same sort of scalable business as, say, website design, but I think that's the nature of the beast. <br> <br>I think in part, yes, type design is not very scalable.
