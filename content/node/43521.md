  exotic poster promoting the addition of a 'burger bar' to a trendy lounge in my
  hometown. I'm concentrating on typography and copy considering not much can be said
  about the humble burger through imagery. \r\n\r\nAs such I'd like your expert opinion
  on my kerning, letting and overall choice of Didot, Gotham and Archer as my inventory
  for the piece.\r\n\r\nAny comments would be most valuably received,\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nPaul"

  body: "I'd use would first suggest choosing between Archer and Didot. \r\nI'd also
    not full-justify the bottom paragraph as it is throwing the balance off because
    of the spacing.\r\nThe balance at the top seems off too. The lightness of the
    Gotham isn't working with the heavy (because of the tightness) line of the Didot.\r\nDon't
    we say \"at Ruby's\" and not \"in Ruby's\"?\r\n"

  body: "Overall I like it, quite elegant.\r\n\r\nJust 4 things to say, in my opinion,
    the \"money can't buy happiness\" is too tight and unbalanced despite I understand
    that you want it to come out.\r\n\r\nSecond thing is... why are you using 3 typefaces?
    I would use only 2, ther's no need to have 2 typefaces that are too close or haven't
    got enough diferences.\r\n\r\nThird, on the text below, i see that you have a
    tight letter space but a normal word space... try to balance those 2 values or
    else you'll get some odd holes on the text block. Usually i use oh the justification
    these levels: 85-100-125 for word spacing and -5-0-5 for letter spacing, and then
    teak as necessary.\r\n\r\nLast one... isn't the logo too big?\r\n\r\nGood work
    :) \r\n\r\nEdit: Tiffany posted first :D\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\nwww.nunocoelho.com"

  body: "I once heard, at a design conference, that one of the easiest ways to impart
    elegance is to track out leading and word spacing. You want to feel as if the
    type has room to breath, to tight and it looks uptight.\r\n\r\nI also agree with
    Tiffany and Nuno, the balance is off (not to mention your logo isn't centered)
    and simplify your font choices.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thank you as always for your valued commentary, I've adjusted the piece for
    some wording considerations (At rather than In Ruby's being one of them), and
    reduced the amount of typefaces to simply Gotham and Didot. \r\n\r\nI'm also liking
    the idea of NOT including photography, and letting evocative text do the image
    conception for me. Anyway, I dont think a picture of a burger will ever do the
    typographical genius of these two typefaces justice :)\r\n\r\nLatest version can

  body: "Design aside, the 'even the cows would be proud' line kind of turns me off
    for some reason. \r\n\r\nI would agree with the rest...make a version with 2 or
    even just 1 typeface.\r\n\r\nThe new version is better, though perhaps still a
    bit busy. \r\n\r\nAnother challenges is using a brown color pallet. That's always
    hard unless you are UPS."
