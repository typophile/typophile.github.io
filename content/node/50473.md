  body: "Truly? I have Helvetica Neue and Helvetica both installed on my computer.
    I feel the sample above has a little more even stroke, and at the bottom of the
    leg of the R, Helvetica seems to have a little \"flip\" (forgive my terminology)
    while this sample does not. The G and Q seem a little different, too. \r\n\r\n"
