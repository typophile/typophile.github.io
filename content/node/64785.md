body: "Adantine is a display face in late Victorian decorative style, gently oblique
  and with a sense of refined movement, all capitals of a single height but with subtle
  distinctions between the \u2018upper\u2019 and \u2018lower\u2019 case glyphs.  It
  offers an air of delicate distinction combined with legibility.\r\n\r\nWe just posted
  a further pdf specimen on our [[http://gatf.wordpress.com | blog]] showing the progress
  to date.  All constructive feedback greatfully received!"

    notes:\r\nThe spacing/kerning of the R have some big problems.\r\nYou will need
    an alternate A, \"swashless\" and possibly more \"centered\".\r\nThere's a clashing
    problem between bottom left swashes and bottom right serifs (ES, HN, etc.).\r\n"

    developments.  I'm thinking of handling the clashing pairs as non-discretionary
    ligatures.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n"

  body: "James you're not correct at all-Scanfont (nor indeed any scanning software)
    was not involved in the construction of Adantine, nor has it been involved in
    the vast majority of Greater Albion's faces. In fact the only ones where a measure
    of Automatic tracing of curves was used (not unedited) were 'Tectura' and the
    holiday dinbats where we was looking for a deliberately hand drawn look, and this
    in conjunction with my own artwork worked best as a way to achieve it.  Greater
    Albion has no interest in sticking a typeface specimen in a scanner and calling
    the result a font.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Hand Drawn_4031.png]"
