body: "Hoping to get a crit on this reproduction decal I made. The actual size will
  be 35mm x 10mm, so in any case, it'll be so small some details can be over looked.
  I am worried about the U's in VAU-VUE, however.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/JDecal1_reduced_5727.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/decalJermaine_5479.jpg]\r\n\r\nOf
  course, if someone could direct me to an official site, I'd be happy to send my
  coworker over there instead.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT: I am told it's suppose to read as
  \"TRU-VUE\". I'll be making those corrections."
