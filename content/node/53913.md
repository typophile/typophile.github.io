body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mockup2_6742.JPG]\r\n\r\nIn 2003 I got
  it into my head to write a book. It would be a great book. A book to end all books.
  I would surely end up rich and famous as a result. \r\n\r\nI might have gotten a
  little bit ahead of myself, and I started daydreaming about what font I wanted to
  use on the title pages and associated website. I settled on the one in the sample.\r\n\r\nBack
  here in the present, the book still isn't done yet. But, it's getting close! \r\n\r\nThe
  only problem is, I've gone through at least four OS reinstalls since 2003, and I
  no longer have this font in question.\r\n\r\nI'm fairly sure it was public domain,
  and that I got it originally in one of those \"1001 Font Packs\" you could find
  on places like Download.com.\r\n\r\nAny and all help would be greatly appreciated."

    you were correct, a quick check of Wikipedia revealed it was not public domain,
    it apparently came installed with Office 97 at the time.\r\n\r\nMuch obliged."
