		<div class="commentbody">Well, the italics variants are a fun challenge. They may or may not work ultimately, but I can't help trying to make them work. Of course, grays would fix this right up, but, this is a 1-bit exercise for now. <BR> <BR>The same two serifs have been tilted, with the top one being cleaned up and the bottom one left raw. Not surprisingly, the bottom graphic is the most faithful to the non-italic members of the family. <BR> <BR>And although I like taking pixel designs towards notchiness sometimes, I only like it if it looks like its been done by design. This is where the bold italics below falters, although it does benefit from the heavy line weight to carry the eye past some of its crags and holes. <BR> <BR>I like the regular italic version better, but it faulters in a different way: in an effort to clean up the letters and give them uniformity across the set, a large portion of the style set forth by the non italics members is lost. In fact, characters stretch the limits of acceptability from bold to regular within the italics. <BR> <BR>Any thoughts or critiques are most welcome! <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/53372.gif" alt=""></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I decided to take the direction the serif italics (above) wanted to go in, emphasizing letterforms that lent themselves to the italics diagonals, and ended up with another font. <BR> <BR>I worked the italics backward graphicallly to reach the non-italic version of the font. It's not cutting edge, but I do like the congruency between the italic and non italic sets, and of course, the fact that the italics don't look like an afterthought when compared to the non italics. <BR> <BR> <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/53468.gif" alt=""> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/53469.gif" alt=""></div>
