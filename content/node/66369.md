body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI have a client who wants an editable PDF that can be saved
  locally to his desktop so he can email it to reps. He is using Adobe Reader and
  wants to be able to email them to his sales reps without the reps being able to
  edit them. I have completed the forms in Adobe LiveCycle ES2 but I'm not sure how
  to password protect them so only those with the password can edit them. Can anyone
  offer me some assistance as I haven't found much online pertaining to this and the
  help section is just confusing me. Thanks for any help!"

    is an all-or-nothing proposition (meaning a password can stop people from viewing
    a PDF, but once they can view it there's no password to stop them from editing
    it) then you might have to have two versions of the PDF: one that's password-protected
    and editable, and another that's not password-protected and not editable.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    there so I guess it's been a long night. Or a crazy morning. Nothing like some
    distilled sugar and coffee. It is, after all, that time of year. Just kidding
    man\u2026\r\n\r\nbusymelsto79  - Not having used LiveCycle I can't really answer
    your question other than you could open it in Acrobat Pro and assign a password
    there. Easy stuff. And I don't agree with Tomi, sounds par for the course to me.
    You don't need 2 versions, just one that is editable with the supplied password
    or not.\r\n\r\npbc"

  body: When I was reading through the help there was something about field patterns
    pertaining to the password protection. Does anyone know about this?
