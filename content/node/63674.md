  I've searched the site, but haven't found anything there. I've tried fonts like
  Dante and Sabon but I think there might be a better match somewhere. I hope you
  have some good ideas! \r\n\r\nThanks, Jeffrey\r\n[[http://www.infraordinaire.com/wordpress/|infraordinaire]]"

    it was in the days before there were five hundred thousand fonts to choose from.\r\n\r\nIt
    probably is still the classic combination, but keep looking and find a better
    one for yourself.\r\n"

  body: "Back again,\r\n\r\nI've actually found an even better match for Franklin
    Gothic: Century! It's brilliant, it fits perfectly, and they have comparable origins
    as well (originally designed by Morris Fuller Benton) which is nice. I've chosen
    the ITC Century because of the many different versions, and it seems to match
    well with ITC Franklin Gothic, probably because they come from the same place.
    Thanks all!\r\n\r\nJeffrey\r\n[[http://www.infraordinaire.com/wordpress|infraordinaire]]"

  body: I always liked Bodoni with Franklin. But I'll admit it has been YEARS since
    I used that pair. Maybe it is time for a revival.
