    the prices seems to be somewhere between 100 and 150 euros, perhaps even more
    for an agency.

    country.\r\n\r\nUsually, people have prejudices about each country, they have
    some eternal feeling when you say, for example, Norway even they never been there.
    So, that also can lower your impression when you hear that some designer from
    Serbia is asking for 100e per hour... but as in many cases, agreed you or not,
    money is almost always a priority against the quality of designer for the most
    companies and I have experienced a couple of times that clients accepted our offers
    and when I asked - \"why we\" - \"cause you were the cheapest one\". But that
    also depends on how much basic knowledge about design have some clients....\r\n\r\nAlso,
    Serbian and Norwegian markets are not the same, and Norway is a miles away from
    Serbia as a country in economic way.\r\n\r\nMaybe it's more interesting to know,
    for example, what is the average price of logo per country, that can maybe give
    a more realistic view on market."

    think everywhere the rates can vary wildly. In my area (Ohio) I know some freelancers
    working for $30 or $40 an hour, some more-experienced designers and small design
    firms charging around $75-100, and some big firms charging considerably more.\r\n\r\nA
    lot depends on your clients, of course. If your clients are little neighborhood
    shops they won't be able to afford the rates you could charge big corporate clients.\r\n\r\nI
    think that in today's economy many designers have been lowering their prices to
    get work, although they don't like to admit it."

    with the transaction and want to do it again. \r\n\r\nMost designers sell themselves
    short by a long shot \u2014 they're great at creating value, horrible at capturing
    that value. The world is full if talented designers who are terrible business
    people, pricing themselves by what their expenses are (or worse, by what they
    'deserve'). Some designers even feel guilty charging for their work. This is the
    difference between designers and business people. Business people do not feel
    guilty when they close a great deal, they look for a bigger deal."

  body: "While a small item on your homepage, I notice you do books. In the States,
    rates vary according to the kind of book. Design & production supervision for
    a museum catalog for a prestigious museum can run $20,000. On the other hand,
    design, with no production supervision, for a scholarly monograph interior runs
    about $700, with a like amount for the jacket.\r\n\r\nAs far as hourly rates go,
    our shop charges $60/hr for things not done on a unit basis (most are unit prices).
    We will only work for a press that has an editorial dept, and handles their own
    production. My wife's shop, which specializes in more hand-holding (i.e., they
    will arrange for editorial services, and handle all production), charges $75/hr.\r\n\r\nIn
    short, I think your question is too broad. As with anything, one charges what
    the market will bear, constrained by costs. If your prices are high, some folks
    will look elsewhere. No argument, or citation of rates others charge will change
    their mind. But if you have enough work, somebody is obviously willing to pay
    your prices."

    thinks is extortionate another will think is reasonable. I'd much rather a client
    do a sharp intake of breath and ask if there's room for negotiation than immediately
    say 'yeah, that's fine'.

  body: '"What the traffic will bear" as opposed to "how hungry are you" is a worldwide
    measure of what to charge. If you want to first look at a comparison of GNP and
    average earnings per capita, you can probably figure a sliding scale per country.
    Some places are tough to figure because of great disparity in wealth from one
    person to the next.  In the USA, there is a great disparity so what you charge
    a neighborhood shop keeper is not what you charge a mega-corporation (if they
    will even talk to you).  Truthfully, your reputation must precede you to get connected
    to those who can pay the higher rates.  I think James is right when he says expenses
    vs livable income.  A college professor in design who has a tenured position and
    freelances can afford to charge less because he knows his bills are paid.  For
    the same reason, he can charge more for jobs or clients that don''t interest him.
    Either way, when someone is not hungry, they can pick and choose.  I have seen
    well known design firms do pro bono work because it interests them.'

    one job per month from then. \r\n\r\nUnder this way of working, there are a lot
    of subquestions that can be asked... but I found that one as the best way I personally
    work and so far it gets me more jobs and people made a trust in me as a part of
    their company even I'm freelancing. Even I get a nice bonuses from time to time.
    Both way trust and catchy communication is the key where I'll put my energy to
    do my job the best, to be as much as original as it can be, to make a client feel
    like I'm really (and I am) always there for them, even they don't have a money
    to pay me in that moment....\r\n\r\nLook on clients as a girls, try to impress
    them, to take care of them and they'll show you what they can do for you. But
    you have to build experience to find a good and right people to work with, otherwise
    you'll end up naive.\r\n\r\nI know this sounds like some guide or religious preaching...

    it's very beneficial for a number of reasons to have several steady clients. \r\n\r\nI
    just want to add that I've seen several design firms fall into the trap of depending
    too much one big client. When the big client unexpectedly left, suddenly they
    were left with almost no income at all. So try to have at least 2 or 3 steady
    clients to reduce the impact if 1 leaves."
