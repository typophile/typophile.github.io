    from Panache. This is like many very similar brush lettering fonts that were made
    as film types. URW also has digitized some of these old brush lettering typefaces.\r\n\r\nIs
    the age of this pre-1990? If so, all this lettering may be film types (photo-lettering),
    whose originals were hand-drawn. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Hi Mike, thanks for your help. It never occurred to me that it could be photo-lettering
    (it's taken from a DVD cover), but it certainly explains why I spent so long searching!
    I'll try and find something from the House Industries catalog as an alternative
    to the main type.
