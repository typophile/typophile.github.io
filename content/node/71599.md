body: "I've inherited an InDesign file for a journal based on works from a classic
  author. The size of the journal is 6\"w x 9\"h, line measure is 27p4.5, body typeface
  is Adobe Garamond Pro regular, 12/14.5. Client wants justified type throughout.
  Previous designer used ID's default h&j settings, but client wasn't happy with the
  hyphenation that resulted. \r\n\r\nI've showed a few new sample settings but client
  wasn't satisfied with end-of-line hyphenations, though word and letter spacing looked
  fine.\r\n\r\nMy question is: can someone suggest h&j settings that would work well
  with typeface and line measure? \r\n\r\nP.S. Client is resistant to any change to
  template.\r\n\r\nThank you."

    the slider at the bottom of the H&J dialog). Beyond that, there\u2019s always
    custom-editing the hyphenation dictionary for repeated unacceptable breaks.\r\n\r\n"

    did not like the way the words were breaking, said the syllabication was not correct,

    dictionary because there were too many instances that would have to be looked
    up manually and then changed.\r\n\r\nEventually I gave up on hyphenating anything,
    the body copy looked good anyway, but client would like hyphenation back for the
    next issue since it looks \"more professional.\"  "

    If it''s the latter, fiddling with the H&J''s isn''t going to solve anything.
    Maybe try using the UK English dictionary for hyphenation, in case your client
    prefers British syllable rules? (Potential drawbacks: It would mean you would
    have to add some American spellings to the dictionary and probably couldn''t spell-check
    usefully.)'

  body: "I don't understand why this is a problem.\r\nYou've got 60+ characters on
    a line, which is plenty for adequate justification.\r\nDoes this \"classic author\"
    use really long words?\r\nI suspect your client is a ragophile, or a bibliophile
    who feels claustrophobic with the tight fit of digital text.\r\n\r\nI do think
    12 pt type, even Garamond, is a bit big though.\r\n\r\nOne thing you might try
    is increasing the number of letters before and after hyphenation to 4 or 5, and
    setting word space to 100/100/200. This will give a more \"old school\", metal
    type look, very open, and IMO quite apropos for an oldstyle face like Garamond
    in a justified book setting. And turn off the kerning while you're at it!\r\n\r\nI've
    done tests trying to duplicate Monotype metal setting in InDesign, and discovered
    that the word spacing is waaaaay, way more than the digital defaults of today.
    One thing you have to be careful with in emulating the classic mid-20th century
    letterpress look is the last line of a paragraph, though, as it always sets to
    the tight default, which can look out of place."

  body: "Which is exactly the end-of-line problem? Too many hyphens or wrong syllabication?\r\n\r\nI'm
    not an English native speaking so may I be missing something here. But as long
    as I know, there are many words with five and six letters in English which had
    syllabication (as total, tribal, yellow, pillow, under, other, etc.).\r\n\r\nThus
    I believe your settings are not optimal when you define a minimun of seven letters
    to hyphenation. The same with three as the limit before and after. To use 5/2/2
    must produce better results.\r\n\r\nHyphenation zone does not applies to justified
    text, so the value you put here does not matters.\r\n\r\nI like to use no hyphen
    limit (0) and set the slider to maximum better spacing. ID tries to keep as few
    hyphens as possible, so you will hardly gets a hyphen cascade.\r\n\r\nAnother
    resource you must consider is optical alignment. It produces a much more regular
    verticial margin.\r\n\r\nThe settings I use to English texts (sample text block
    with 27p width):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hj01_4239.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hj02_3716.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hj03_4210.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hj04_6101.png]\r\n.\r\n\r\n[Although
    these captures are from a Portuguese ID installation, the fields are exactly the
    same you have in English.]"

    (though I didn't find that to be the case.) I don't even think she would know
    the difference between UK and US English hyphenation. Not sure that she really
    knows what she wants at all, but I do appreciate all suggestions. I will do type
    tests (next edition begins in August) and hopefully I can hit on something she
    finds acceptable. I would bet she will find a more \"metal type\" look to be what
    she has in mind, but has not been able to verbalize. The journal reviews works
    by a mid-18th century classic British novelist, so old school may be the key.\r\n\r\nThanks
    all for the suggestions, much appreciated. I will follow through."

    They thought that breaking words at the end of lines was unattractive and disruptive.\r\n\r\nIf
    you can't convince them otherwise, the solution is pretty simple -- just minimize
    the number of hyphens. Set the hyphenation preferences to have at least 4 characters
    before and after a hyphen, move that slider to \"fewer hyphens\", etc.  As Nick
    said, with 60+ characters per line, you should be okay as long as there aren't
    a large number of unusually long words."

  body: "There are \u201Clegal\u201D hyphenation points in a given word (according
    to whatever dictionary/standard is being used \u2014 American and British conventions
    differ, as has been noted); and then there are \u201Cpreferable\u201D hyphenation
    points \u2014 those that seem most natural, like between compounds or only at
    distinct prefixes and suffixes. The latter is a subset of the former, and probably
    more what your client is looking for.\r\n\r\nIf you move the slider in the H&J
    dialog to the right, \u201CFewer Hyphens,\u201D it will encourage InDesign to
    use only the more preferable hyphenation points. It won\u2019t stop \u201Cbad
    breaks\u201D altogether, but it will give greater penalty to the less desirable
    hyphenation points. (Of course, no dictionary will be able to read your publisher\u2019s
    mind ;-)\r\n\r\nI would not necessarily recommend limiting the before/after character
    fields to 4, unless those cases are completely unacceptable in all situations.
    Doing so will take away InDesign\u2019s option to hyphenate a word with a three-letter
    prefix, of which there are many (like \u201Cpre-\u201D, for example) and which
    should be a completely acceptable break point for your client, since these are
    considered by most to be natural and logical points.\r\n\r\nThe fewer options
    the H&J engine has to work with, the harder it is to get good settings.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck.\r\n\r\n"

  body: ">Client's objections were to syllabication\r\n\r\nWhy we always use a custom
    dictionary -- with InDesign, or any other layout program. InDesign makes it tough,
    though. It will always revert to the Proximity Dictionary (algorithm) settings
    when a word is not in the exception dictionary. The only solution is to have all
    the words in the text in the exception dictionary. Even here there can be differences
    with some words where, for example, an apostrophe occurs. Further, there are issues
    with using the \"document\" dictionary, but other issues if you don't. Controlling
    hyphenation with InDesign is a nightmare. So too is justification -- the Single
    Line composer doesn't work like any other single line composer I've ever used,
    and the Adobe Paragraph Composer, under certain circumstances, will not always
    make the same line-ending decisions, even though there was no change to the text
    in a paragraph. Finding that out cost us $4,000 to reprint a book for a customer
    (we split the cost, they didn't catch the problem at F&G's). We now run a PDF
    to PDF comparison of the entire book at each proof stage to make sure nothing
    changed.\r\n\r\nBTW, technically speaking, InDesign's dictionary is a plug-in.
    By now, there may be others out there. We quit looking & developed our own."
