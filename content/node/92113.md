  project called Make A Meaning. Make A Meaning is a growing collection of postcards
  communicating new meanings for extinct English words. Anybody and everybody can
  take part, from children to designers to grannies. The project offers obsolete but
  expressive, brilliant-sounding words to people who coin new definitions for them
  on one side of a postcard \u2013 they may describe a pet hate, a particular habit,
  situation, smell, etc.\r\n\r\nI am still working on the website, but if anyone on
  Typophile would like to take part and make a meaning, please email abelgrove@gmail.com
  for a word and instructions!\r\n\r\nhttp://make_a_meaning.prosite.com/\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n"

    say that if the Thorn and the Eth letterforms are one day re-introduced to English,
    I hope they take on their original -and much needed- sounds instead of newly invented
    ones. (Not that we don't need more symbols for poorly supported sounds.)\r\n\r\nConcepts
    don't go extinct, they just go dormant.\r\nMake entirely new words!\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/81709\r\n\r\nThat
    said, it's always nice to see a preoccupation with language.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

      of concepts becoming dormant, rather than extinct so thanks for the post!\r\n"
