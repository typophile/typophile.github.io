<li>Are you guys planning another poll (probably after all the entries are up)? <BR>2. I know that there's judges, and they're the ones who are going to pick the winner(s), but since the main point is in fact to sell as many shirts as possible, shouldn't there be a somewhat formal voting procedure, so at least the judges know which shirts might be the most profitable before they decide? I know judges don't like such &quot;infrigements&quot;, but if the motivation is to help Typophile&hellip; <BR> <BR>BTW, more likely than not my own entry/entries might *suffer* if you do #2, so I'm not trying to skew the results or anything.

		<div class="commentbody">You do have something of a &quot;captive audience,&quot; or more to the point &quot;captive consumer space&quot; in the forums. You can easily poll to get a rough sense of how many shirts you should print, at the very least. <BR> <BR>Also it would be interesting to see what popular favorites are, even if it doesn't change what &quot;wins&quot; or gets printed. <BR> <BR>This poll space has been so empty since its inception: probably because at that point there were not even five strong candidates, but the quality seems to have gotten much better in the last week, with presumably more goodies to come. [apologies to those I may have just slighted with this remark.] <BR> <BR>And hey, as judgement day looms, I'm wondering how the judging is going to work. Is it ID Design Annual style, where there is some sort of dialogue from which we are treated to salient gems? Do they rate the shirts, make a list of five, narrow to a &quot;semifinalists&quot; stage, or is it all too arcane for us to know?</div>

I think the designer was trying to cover all bases. and then there's the whole look and feel and concept thing. <BR> <BR>28.001 yay dingbats, I've tried for a few years now to convince companies that dingbatting their name could be excellent for branding. no ones taken to it, and here's my opportunity! I'll wear it to meetings&hellip;symbols rule. and whats a letterform but a symbol anyway? Dingbats being so recognizable now I think they should be given the same uses&hellip;like braille for seeing people or soemthing. <BR> <BR>29.008 I like the relationship between font choice and the word. and then the justaposition or it all together too. its very clean. not much of an advertisement for typophile but is that needed anyway? is a t-shirt going to drive visitors..no. <BR> <BR>43.016 but with that black screen on. Its nice to fit words into squares, dosen't say much about what typophile is or does&hellip;but sticks to the point somewhat without being altruistic, or illustrative.  <BR> <BR>I would not wear flaming anything&hellip;in this city there's too many flaming identities, and I think its on its way to be the next trend, y'no right after orbits and &quot;e&quot;-wotevers die off.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Disclaimer: color is not my strong point. In fact, I don't even like half-tones. I like line art, engraving, and type. So I'm really only considering the qualities outside of color. Except  for green and purple, which I like. <BR> <BR>In decreasing order of preference: <BR> <BR>43.002 <BR> <BR>Linotype Sangue in a goth-looking design. This is my favorite by far! Sangue is a great secret weapon. <BR> <BR>44.001 <BR> <BR>Green on green. Bickham script (or is it Sloop?) Knockout on the sleeve. VERY nice. <BR> <BR>11.001 <BR> <BR>What can I say, I have a pathological craving for ornament. <BR> <BR>38.021 <BR> <BR>More ornament. There is something wrong with me. I want to wear a chandelier on my torso. <BR> <BR>45.002 <BR> <BR>Flamin' awesome. And if that's hand-lettering, that's what hand-lettering should do. And if it's not hand-lettering, it's certainly on the same level.  <BR> <BR>And one more for curiosity's sake: 15.001 <BR> <BR>OK I get the orange part now. It's an inside joke. I'll assume the creator wants to deliver the punchline personally, so I'll withhold. VERY subtle and VERY clever. Likely outside the scope of the contest, though.</div>
