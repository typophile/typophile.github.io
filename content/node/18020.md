  any original pieces of Edward Johnston still viewable in the Underground? Or is
  everything a reissue which I think I remember reading somewhere.\r\n\r\nthanks.\r\n\r\n "

    body: It's been nearly 14 years since I was there, but I remember being pretty
      impressed by the London City Musuem--by its comprehensiveness in particular.
      I would not be surprised at all to learn that some of Johnston's original work
      was being preserved there, in storage or in the exhibits. Give it a try--and
      like I said, it's a great musuem anyway.

  body: 'I think it is Johnston''s original font that is on all the station signs
    still. They may be renewed, but I believe it''s the same font as always--quirky,
    friendly and wonderful. '

  body: "Ideally you'll like to have a look at the London Underground Station Design
    Audits, which are held in the London Transport Museum Library. They are a guide
    to \"<em>elements on the station[s] worth conserving as well as a pointer to possible
    future restoration of deteriorated or missing architectural details...London Underground
    wishes to conserve all those features which are representative of the station's
    history where they are still relevant.</em>\" \r\n\r\nUnfortunately the museum
    itself is being 'transformed', so I don't know how accessible the collection is.
    The website can be found here - <a href=\"http://www.ltmuseum.co.uk/\">http://www.ltmuseum.co.uk</a>.\r\n\r\nNo
    idea if this book lists stations with original fittings, but it's worth a look
    - <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1854142313/qid=1140384229/sr=1-4/ref=sr_1_0_4/026-6296368-4802057\">Johnston's
    Underground Type</a>.\r\n\r\nAldgate's audit mentions \"<em>platform canopy at
    North end probably 19th Century originals. They incorporate 1920s brass trimmed
    free standing signs.</em>\" Not sure if they are 'original' or not, a quick search
    on flickr found <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ickoonite/23312491/\">this</a>
    (I seem to have misplaced all my photographs of the station). It also found this,
    at <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/iantindale/38978031/\">Aldgate East</a>,
    just down the road. \r\n\r\nI presume the latter is what you're looking for, and
    I know there are a lot of the older signs at many of the stations - including
    tiles - but offhand I couldn't say which. Some of the more central stations ring
    a bell - Tottenham Court Road and Leicester Square - but I haven't been on a tube
    for quite some time; south east London doesn't have many tube stations.\r\n"
