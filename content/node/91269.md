  at MF and FF those versions seem to be a cheap copy. Here's the original scanned
  from my copy of the first edition hardcover The Book Of 100 Type Face Alphabets
  which  I picked up today for $1.00 (score!!).\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.graphicdeclaration.com/images/huxleyvertical_2.jpg\">
  \r\n\r\nLarger scanned version 1.5m here: www.graphicdeclaration.com/images/huxleyvertical_1.jpg\r\n\r\nOr

  body: "I remember in the early days of digital fonts, Jonathan Hoefler had a Huxley
    Vertical for license. He didn't call it Huxley Vertical, and it is no longer available,
    but it was a very good Huxley. It was a FontHaus font if memory serves me, back
    when Jonathan was the \"FontHaus Foundry\". I'm sure if you looked at old U&lc's
    you can find the ads.\r\n\r\nMemories!"
