  released font <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/v-design/orca-pro/\">Orca Pro</a>
  and I don't how to correctly set widths and sidebearings.\r\n\r\nLet's say I want
  to set all glyphs to be 600 units wide, but so that they keep their relative sidebearings
  from the original font (e.g. the left sidebearing of letter \"L\" would be quite
  bigger than the right one).\r\n\r\nThere are just few options how to set set width
  in Fontlab:\r\n- center glyph\r\n- align to left or right sidebearing\r\n- keep
  as it is\r\n\r\nUnfortunatelly none of these options works for me, unless I make
  it manually glyph by glyph, which would be horribly tedious work.\r\n\r\nAny help
  would be really appreciated.\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\n\r\nVit"

  body: "Thanks Nick,\r\nthis would certainly help, but it is not as handy as I was
    wondering.\r\n\r\nThere are going to be 8 fonts and quite a lot of glyphs, many
    of them non-standard (like &amp;, numerals, some lowercase letters etc.) and it
    would still be quite tedious work. \r\n\r\nIn fact the issue is pretty simple:
    \r\ndesired width - original width : 2 \r\n(and then add this value to both left
    and right sidebearing)\r\n\r\nI have been wondering whether there could be some
    macro script or perhaps some trick using action-set or so?\r\n\r\nVit"

    it like that, and yes this is going to be a quite tedious. Type design is a quite
    tedious. Poor type design is easy.

    mechanically\u2026\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nfrom robofab.world import CurrentFont\r\nfont
    = CurrentFont()\r\ntargetWidth = 600\r\nfor glyph in font:\r\n    widthDelta =
    targetWidth - glyph.width\r\n    glyph.leftMargin += int(widthDelta/2)\r\n    glyph.width
    = targetWidth\r\n    glyph.update()\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\u2026but what you'll find
    is that the contours of many glyphs, especially the widest and narrowest ones,
    will want to be adjusted to fit the width properly."

  body: "<em>\u2026which would be horribly tedious work...</em>\r\n\r\nThe problem
    is that the optical center is, arguably, more important in monospaced fonts, and
    it's the spacing element least amenable to automation. So IMO you're stuck with
    the tedium.\r\n\r\nAlso, you may want to consider redrawing some of the glyphs
    for monospace function (\"adjusted\" as Matthew says).\r\n\r\nOn the bright side,
    no kerning!"

  body: "Thank you all!\r\nI definitelly agree with you: type design is tedious work
    and I know there are no miraculous tricks. I have been working on the source font
    <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/v-design/orca-pro/\">Orca Pro</a> over
    2 years and it was never ending story. You can always find a new kerning pair
    to add or a detail to fix.\r\n\r\nAs well I know I need to completely redraw a
    lot of glyphs (like M W m w @) and fine tune position of some extreme letters
    like L J P...\r\n\r\nHowever as for the metric itself I belive this macro Butterick
    mentioned could do maybe 70-80% of the raw work. \r\n\r\n<strong>Butterick:</strong>
    I'm not very experienced with Python macros - should I save the script you posted
    as a PY file, install Robofab.World and it should work then?\r\n________\r\n\r\nAnyway
    this is my first post on Typophile and I am very glad there are so many people
    interested and willing to hlep - thank you! May I ask for your opinion about <a
    href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/v-design/orca-pro/\">Orca</a>? This is my
    very first release and I'm pretty excited how pleople will react!\r\n\r\n"

    knows this. But he has painstakingly optically centered each glyph in the proportionally-spaced
    version of the font.\r\n\r\nWhat he is asking is if he can keep the hard work
    he has done for that font, and copy it over to the monospaced version."

    for proportional and monowidth is not the same.\r\nOptical centering plays a larger
    role in monospace.\r\n\r\nIn theory, there are (at least) three letter spacing
    parameters:\r\n\r\n1. Proximity distances, e.g. to avoid extremity collisions\r\n2.
    Counter space, i.e. the white space between glyphs\r\n3. Optical centre"

    be great and quite simple to have it implemented in the new FontLab version -

  body: "The thing is setting proportional shapes into a standard width and making
    sure they are optically centered isn't going to give a great result. The reason
    is that to make it work you will end up with a hideously widely spaced font. Instead,
    you probably want to squash that w and extend that i rather than leaving the i
    floating in whatever space is wide enough to fit everything.\r\n\r\nI suggest
    that you begin with your n & o and at slightly wider glyphs like d b p q and find
    your base width from these. You can probably live with adding a bit of extra space
    around the o and leave it alone for now. Next begin adjusting shapes so they fill
    this new space evenly. You may need to expand your s and maybe your a. Compress
    your m.  And so on. \r\n\r\nThis will be fairly intensive design work for certain
    glyphs - but that's how you make a real monospace.\r\n\r\nBest wishes!"
