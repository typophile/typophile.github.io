  body: I got myself a copy today after seeing that. The UK edition is published by
    Bloomsbury, but sadly they haven't given it that moving cover.

  body: This book is available to order on [[http://www.amazon.com/ABC3D-Marion-Bataille/dp/1596434252/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1224738940&sr=1-1|Amazon]]
    at the amazingly inexpensive price of $13.57 (plus $3.99 for shipping). And according
    to the product description, this version does have the "moving cover" apparently
    missing from the UK editon mentioned above. I've just ordered my copy this evening.

  body: I got my copy last week and showed it to the our new students. I think it
    has been very inspiring. About the price ... I don't know how it works out ...
    and I think I it's better not to know ... but I couldn't resist.
