body: I am searching for an example of a cpp chart from those bygone days of copyfitting.
  Does anyone know of a reference for one, or would you be willing to send a .pdf
  from an old typesetting book you may have laying around the office?  <BR>Thanks.

  body: You might try eBay or an old book source who has some handouts from paper
    companies for sale. I know that Warren Paper and Champion published a lot of items
    relating to type and print production. Print shops still operating in your area
    might be of help as well. Good luck.  <BR> <BR><a href="http://giam.typepad.com/the_branding_of_polaroid_/"

  body: I have an old Agfa specimen book &#40;the tall black thick one from 1990&#41;,
    and it has 8&#43; pages of CPP tables, but they&#39;re indexed &#40;each font
    has a key number and you use that to look up the measures in the table&#41;. Would
    it be helpful to you to have a scan of like half a page? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>
