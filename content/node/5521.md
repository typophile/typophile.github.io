  package design and corporate identity, which is the bottom panel just above the
  date, 1958. Somewhere in the lower right of the photo is the corporate sign POLAROID,
  identical to the mark above. I haven&#39;t been able as yet to find a better photo.
  <BR> <BR>On the left are package designs for Polaroid Sunglasses, 1962, Polaroid
  Colorpack and black-and-white filmpacks, package design for a Polaroid Colorpack
  camera, and to the far left, package design and product identity for Polavision,
  1977. At the bottom of the row is a package design and product identity for a Polaroid
  Square Shooter camera. <BR> <BR>In the row on the right are package designs and
  product identity for Polaroid SX-70 cameras and accessories, dating from 1972, and
  just below is a photo of package design for Polaroid Pronto! cameras, 1976. <BR>

  body: Thank you kindly, Sharon and Grant. I&#39;m up to the introduction of product
    ID for sunglasses, 1962, and a new header for the blog. How time flies when you&#39;re
    having fun! <BR> <BR><a href="http://giam.typepad.com/the_branding_of_polaroid_/"

  body: Paul, why didn&#39;t Bob Gage use a sans serif face for the first DDB ads?  <BR>
    <BR>Did it bother you at the time that your ID wasn&#39;t being carried over into
    the design of the ads?  <BR> <BR>And why isn&#39;t the Polaroid logo used as a
    &#34;signature&#34; at the end of the body copy?

  body: Nick -- Those are excellent questions. DD&amp;B had their own ways of doing
    things with typography and they used an excellent typographer named Klaus Schmidt
    to ride herd on their output. At the time that Gage did that ad for the Model
    150, Polaroid was a $50 mill. business with an uncertain future and the ad was
    done before I got into redesigning the packaging. However, DD&amp;B totally ignored
    my design concepts to the point where they never, ever included a photo of a package
    in one of their print or tv ads. This bothered me a lot more than the type they
    used. I can understand their competitiveness but it was IMO counterproductive
    to effective sales promotion. They made millions with television advertising and
    major print buys and I&#39;m not aware that they pitched the package design biz,
    though the major national firms did. Polaroid did not appear at the bottom of
    the dealer ads because that is where each individual dealer pasted up his usually
    horrible logo and pertinent info. We tried to separate Polaroid from the schlock
    as much as possible. <BR> <BR><a href="http://giam.typepad.com/the_branding_of_polaroid_/"

  body: 'Paul, I started work as an art director in 1979 for Raymond Lee, a classic
    Big Idea art director/copywriter. He always preferred not to show packaging or
    logo, and if possible not show the product either, relying merely on the genius
    of the ad to win awards, I mean sell the product. For instance, a photo of two
    naked feet, with the headline &#34;Pity the poor soles with no Macgregor socks.&#34; '

  body: Nick -- Awards were the bane of my existence. Polaroid inhouse staff &#40;not
    I&#41; sent in the material and attended the awards dinners. I can&#39;t ever
    remember being invited. Once a piece got an award I never saw it again as the
    inhouse designers glommed onto related projects hoping to cover themselves with
    glory. I never got any other clients based on awards received. Freelancers could
    go broke submitting material to the weekly show announcements in their mail boxes.
    &#34;Award-winning&#34; has become a ridiculous clich

  body: Yeah, award shows are a big waste of time and money. Most of them are just
    for-profit enterprises &#40;e.g., LogoLounge&#41; and have nothing to do with
    promoting or recognizing excellence.
