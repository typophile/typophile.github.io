Also, I am not sure about horizontal lines at the bottom enclosing &quot;Of West Bengal&quot;.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I would appreciate any kind of help or feedback.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thank you <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ritesh, I like the concept of the rollers. The way the letters work is too good to pass up. The execution does need refinement(as you noted). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->First off, the overlapping forms should probably be more related to their forms, so: the ascender of the d should overlap the bowl of the p, which should overlap the bowl of the d. The ascender of the b should overlap the bowl of the d and the bowl of the a should overlap the line descending from the b. Some of this you've done already, but the lines that define the letters should probably stay more intact. Have you tried to remove any line portion that is not part of a letter? It might help a bit. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The rules enclosing &quot;of West Bengal&quot; don't do anything for me either. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Does the client want to change the condensed letters to large, open ones like the &quot;pdba&quot;? If so, it could get very long/confusing to read.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Chris, thanks for the feedback. Here I made changes to the logo. Removed the horizontal rules(i think it goes better now), made changes to the overlapping, and in the 2nd one, removed the extra lines just to show u how it looks (I had tried that earlier but it doesn't really work because of the abrupt breaks). The client is quite happy with the letter forms because I had done another one with the similar font as the emblem but it was too stretched and also the thickness of the lines didn't match. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I still don't think the letterforms in the emblem are readable.

		<div class="commentbody">The rollers and belts in the dying machines don't actually overlap, do they? I would think that they'd butt up against each other, that is, if they even touch. If this is correct, then it might help to solve some of the legibility issues with the acronym. It might even allow you to explore doing a monochromatic acronym. For example, you could create the belts in a screened back version of whatever color you choose to work with, then have full opacity where the letterforms are. This would eliminate the abrupt breaks. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The typeface doesn't seem appropriate. There is no relationship between it and the letterforms of the acronym. I'm not suggesting that you jump to Avant Garde, but there should be something that ties them together and I'm just not seeing it yet. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As others have said, your concept is great. Looking further into this identity, some photographic imagery (screened or not) of a dying machine (maybe focusing in on the rollers) might be a nice supporting element. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Aloha! <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Scott</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hey fellas, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thanks for the feedbak. I had a talk to the client and the client liked the concept and the logos and having given the below 2 choices he picked the 2nd one. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Christos, I posted this logo after those initial developing stages of B/W. When the client approved the idea and the design, then he gave me the green light for putting in the colours. I have done a lot more work on it than you are seeing here and no Christos you were not being too naggy, in fact I appreciate your feedback. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Daniel, I did explore the horizontal line up of the PDBA, trust me its harder than it seems. Thanks for your comments though. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Scott, the idea was to take the basic structural shape of the rollers and use it in the emblem and not to mimic the exact form of the rollers. Also, I had to integrate the form of the letters &quot;pdba&quot; into the logo. At first the client was being fussy about legibility of the letters but now he seems to be alright with it.Thanks for the comments Scott.. appreciate it! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Guys I still think that the logo here on the right side is giving away too much blank space in the last 2 lines of the title &quot;Of West Bengal&quot;, I tried fixing the kerning and all but some how I end up liking the way it is right now better than the other ones that i try out. Any ideas how to fix that part ? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thank u all <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>
