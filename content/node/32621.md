body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nit was quite a bit since I've posted anything on typophile. It's
  time to get back to The Source.\r\n\r\nMy one-man show finally gets promoted to
  a two-men show, where I am supposed to get the direction. It should seem like a
  good news and it is. But I do miss the things on  managing a team. Now, after you
  rofled for sometime and got back to the monitor - the team will only get bigger
  now, so I've thought I'd better learn how to manage things (from data assets to
  the hardware to the team) itself before I lose the credentials and trust from the
  Top, which happens easily here.\r\n\r\nSo where do I start? My particular interest
  lies in readings and software I would eventually need.\r\n\r\nAnyone uses Bridge
  and Version Cue here from the CS?\r\nHow do you handle data, when three designers,
  a copywriter and an art director work on one project?\r\nHow do you use servers?\r\nHow
  often do you back up the data?\r\nDo you meet on weekly basis to discuss stuff or
  do you let it out on a daily basis at a cig break?\r\nDo you write/require reports?
  Which ones?\r\n... [and so on]\r\n\r\nAny feedback is hugely welcome here.\r\n(and
  while you are writing, I'll get the eight_hours_delayed lunch)"

    our system was fairly basic. File server where all files are stored for a project
    in folders adhering to some logical naming system. File servers backed up nightly
    to tape, rotated off-site and/or into a fire safe. Finished jobs archived off
    onto CD/DVD with at least two copies, one being stored off-site.\r\n\r\nUnless
    you have a fixing for middle management, I'd stay skip routine meetings and writing
    up reports. "

  body: "I think, this is waht basically I am used to. I don't remember having some
    special file management software or even backups routines going on constantly
    (which is bad, of course).\r\nI was thinking of setting up a pc with all data
    I have for the brand/product and fixing up a share folder/drive, so we can swap
    files easily. Plus weekly updates of the every new file edited or created during
    this week?... No tapes, just dvds.\r\nI am no fan of reporting either, but I am
    looking into something like Studiometry http://www.oranged.net/studiometry/ for
    keeping records of things done. I have to test it first on my own, though.\r\nVersion
    Cue and Bridge are not your devices of choice, are they? :)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nA"
