  body: 'Here&#39;s a comparison between the original and my crude attempt to duplicate
    it with Futura Extra Bold: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/27989.gif"
    alt="dell"> <BR> <BR>The E has been modified a bit, of course, and the counter
    on the D is a little wider, but basically someone started from Futura Extra Bold.
    <BR> <BR>Someone else can perhaps speak to the variations among the versions of
    Futura available on MyFonts. This is one typeface where the different foundries&#39;
    versions all look pretty much the same to me, unlike Garamonds or Caslons. For
    my money, however, you can&#39;t go wrong with the Linotype or URW versions.'

  body: Oh, crap, the label is wrong. It&#39;s not Futura Black, of course, it&#39;s
    Extra Bold. Don&#39;t mind me. Futura Black is a different animal altogether.

  body: Thanks a lot my friend. But please take a look at this version of Futura and
    tell me what you think, if it is probably the version used of Futura used on the
    logo let me know <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> Notice the letter-spacing and the counter on the D. <IMG

  body: 'The counter looks like it could be a match -- though don&#39;t take letterspacing
    into account. Whoever made the logo probably adjusted the letterspacing themselves.
    <BR> <BR>Also, if all you need is the logo, then the best thing is to just use
    the EPS, which I&#39;ll link below. You won&#39;t be able to see it on screen,
    but you can download it to your computer. <BR> <BR><!--attachment: dell-27992.unk*attachment_icon.gif*application/postscript*18.8*dell+logo*dell%2eeps
