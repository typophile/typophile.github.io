  body: "I think Old Nick misunderstood the question.\r\n\r\nBrown Fox is saying he
    wants to include symbols in his font for country codes, as single glyphs. He's
    wondering if there's a standard way of doing this.\r\n\r\nThe answer is: there
    are standard codepoints for these characters, yes. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Indicator_Symbol\r\nThey
    are encoded at U+1F1E6 to U+1F1FF.\r\nThe original proposal is here: http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n3727.pdf\r\n\r\nThus
    there are standardized glyph names for those characters, of the form \"u1F1E6\"
    etcetera.\r\n\r\nThe type designer can use OpenType ligation to do what she wants
    with the combining sequences. Does \"FR\" turn into a single circled FR glyph?
    Up to the designer.\r\n"
