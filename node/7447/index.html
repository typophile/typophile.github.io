  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I've been thinking lately about the letters that make up the lc latin alphabet, and both the common 'elements' that some letters (conventionally) share and the clearly unique parts. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->ie<!-- raw HTML omitted --> The rotational/mirrored similarities between p, q, b and d, the shared 'humps' of r, h, n, m, the top parts of i and j and the common general shape of o, c and e.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Then you throw in letters like f, t, g, k and z, which barely seem to be part of the same 'pond'. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So it got me thinking about aids to readbility &ndash; is it the lack of variance in the alphabet? That these parts are shared? So surely a more readable alphabet will contain more recognisable similarities?  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That does seem counter intuitive though, because surely it's the differences that are important in distinguishing the individual glyphs &ndash; so is a more disjointed alphabet actually more readable (if a little jarring on the eyes!) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Basically, I was thinking about creating two companion types, both with the same 'style', but one emphasising similarities and the other emphasising differences.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Am I barking up a thoroughly well barked up tree, or is this something that may be worth running with? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jordan</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Jordan, this is a great line of thought. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Since '98 I've been working on an Alphabet Reform project where <!-- raw HTML omitted -->dissimilarity<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (and specifically in the realm of boumas -word shapes- more than individual letters) is emphasized. Because information comes only from contrast. The rest is convention, and malleable (although you have to bend it not break it) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think the trick to optimal readability lies in making the glyphs are different as possible while limiting errant saccades (eye fixations to the wrong part of the text). But the tresholds still escape me. And actually, a font system like you describe could actually be a useful tool when used in empirical testing (which however is very difficult/expensive to carry out properly). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Not that I have a lot of expertise or evidence to support my posting here, but a few things come to mind in this general realm of alphabet reform. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->One is the relationship of letter similarity/dissimilarity and dyslexia. The fact that there are shapes that are reflections or rotations of eachother is a major tripping point for dyslexics. Some people offer certain typefaces and rules (sans over serif, differences in descenders, etc) to fight the problem, but I think an alphabet reform would cure it. (<!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.dyslexic.com/database/articles/fonts.html">http://www.dyslexic.com/database/articles/fonts.html</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->)  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Of course, when it comes to designing a font over designing a typeface, there are issues of uniqueness to a font, character, and so on, that seem to warrant a more radical and fundimental change. I think it's fun to think about the idea of slowly rolling over from one alphabet to another, easing in to it.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ah, but how much of a difference in this would could a new alphabet make? I imagine that, beyond dyslexia, it could perhaps benefit literacy on a whole, but this is speculation. Are there any sets of research to support such a theory? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Most importantly: Is our alphabet broken? Do we read best what we read most, or is there possibility for a better possible system?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Sorry to hear about your BMW, it's a shame.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jordan, not to hijack your awesome thread, do you have any sketches? I'd like to see what you're thinking so far. Same goes for you, Hrant, I remember once seeing a little something of yours in another thread. I just want to see what we're thinking here.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Not to be a crazy theorist, would this be a revolution of the type designers? It seems to me like the alphabet could use some modernizing, and who better?  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Should we also be looking at Caps? Or, maybe the variety of shared parts in traditional caps are a good place to start for the lc. It strikes me that there should be some kind of real similarity between lc and UC that doesn't exist now (Aa, Qq) while some letters are nearly resized (Vv, Xx, Zz) or others are well translated (Bb, Mm, Tt).  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Also, as we are moving to an increasingly typeset culture, can we ditch structural relationships derived from script handwriting?

		<div class="commentbody">Aaran: Ever since I started seriously thinking about designing type, and actually experimenting, it's always bugged me how some letters are (relatively) easy to create once you've got a few basic shapes down, and others a real pain. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I hate drawing z, g, and most of all k. They <!-- raw HTML omitted -->always<!-- raw HTML omitted --> seem so disharmonious with the rest of the typeface &ndash; even in the most wonderful types it's just a matter of them being squashed in better than in lesser faces. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->At the same time, it always amused me how traditionally, the clearly identical forms of b, d, p and q had these subtle little divergences (presumably I though, just to bug us designers). The flick on the q's tail, the square serif on the bottom of the b, the opposing serifs on a d and the 'backwards' serif on the p tail. Just so they can insist they're unique! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I've not got any sketches or anything, it's just something I was thinking about. I'm drawing a very simple face at the moment, and I kept realising there was this crossroads I came to with each letter &ndash; it could be conventional, 'boring' and readable, or unconventional, unique, but difficult to read. (Even when only using simple basic forms.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Then I thought that surely differently shaped letters should help readability, not hinder it &ndash; but that didn't seem to be borne out when trying to read a face with unusual letterforms (like the faces that use serif splicing experiments such as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->alita postmodern<!-- raw HTML omitted -->). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->maybe it's a beauty thing &ndash; it's said the faces (as in, human faces, not type-faces) that most people find most attractive are those that are symmetrial but with slight inconsistencies (beauty spots <!-- raw HTML omitted -->etc.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) Maybe we're too preoccupied with the 'beauty' of a typeface (or more specifically, it's individual glyphs) to appreciate that it's function may be served better by having more than slight inconsistencies in it's alphabet &ndash; and we visually reject 'odd' conceptual alphabets on their superficial lack of beauty alone; where the beauty spot has become a boil! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I want a b that looks like a lower case delta, a w that looks like an omega, a q that curls up underneath it's neighbouring u, maybe even joining with it, and an l that's more than just a vertical line to be confused with a 1, an I and a |. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I just wonder if it'd 'work' or not. No doubt it would take some getting used to, but it would be interesting to test. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Incidentally, Hrant, I've enjoyed reading your work on Boumas and revolutionary alphabets (I confess that it was re-reading a post of yours when you posted your experimetally revised alphabet that encouraged me to put some words down on my thoughts). One thing about Boumas &ndash; given that there are an (effectively) infinite number of shapes that words can form, and that you believe it's the word-shapes' divergence that leads to reading ease, do you think that our mind forms a 'bouma alphabet' of some kind &ndash; maybe even a 'visual-syllable' alphabet? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Obviously, it would be impossible (or at least, very improbable) for our mind to catalogue every Bouma, and that many very different words will inevitably have similar shapes, how do you think we can store the information in a bouma without first focusing on individual letters first? maybe we just focus on one 'key' letter in each word that leads us to recognise the rest of it by it's shape &ndash; there's probably a good analogy for that but I can't think of one&hellip;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jordan</div>

Readability is anti-boring! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; Maybe we're too preoccupied with the 'beauty' of a typeface <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Indeed. Probably because tradition can only be learned/taught consciously. People don't like to be told that half of human reality is beyond their appreciation. But it is, and that's why a &quot;real&quot; text face cannot be evaluated with superficial formal rules (like ductus). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; do you think that our mind forms a 'bouma alphabet' <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yes, in the same way that you learn the letters, you learn the shapes of [frequent] cluster of letters. But generally you learn them out of practice, not some schoolteacher telling you. Over time you build boumas in your head, yes, compiling them via the individual letters when you run into an unfamiliar one, but gradually less and less. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>

<p>Needless to say my idea never got going, things to do, people to see, you know how it is.
