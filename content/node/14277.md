body: "Hello,\r\nMy name is Tara Kelton. I graduated from Parsons recently and I am
  having a tough time finding design studios that are hiring. I'm very close to taking
  a job I don't want, and the situation is becoming rather dire. Ideally I'd like
  to work at a small studio where I can learn more about design and be inspired by
  the people around me. I don't know if this is an impossible dream, I could just
  be a hopeful young innocent.  I've dropped my portfolio off at a number of places
  but all I ever hear is 'nice work but we're not hiring'. So many people have used
  the adjective 'nice' that I am getting a bit nervous. I think my work is ok but
  I'd really like some honest feedback - http://tarakelton.com Each piece can be scrolled
  through by clicking on the decorative elements I've positioned under it. (I've noticed
  lately that some people miss it.)\r\nAny help would be much appreciated!"

      critical, just please try and be mature - realizing that greater designers than
      you may have 'missed' your navigation interface not because they're dumb or
      inobservant, but that you may have wandered into the 'mystery meat' realm and
      are still under the impression that it is somehow chic outside the fine arts

      to illustrate the imperections in outsourced processes is again, like andrea

      about pornography. Instead of using a plotter or printer with clever random
      seeds, you used live human labour, how innovative. What social conscience. Pharaoh
      turned down forklifts too. I think it serves as a more poignant critique of
      expensive, hyped design schools and the socioeconomic status of their student
      bodies. \r\n\r\nKeep trying though. Just cause I'm a cranky old sextagenarian
      shouldn't let me influence you. Perhaps the newfangled way is \r\nyours. Try

    after Labor Day. Vacations and kids being out of school etc. Decision  makers
    aren't around. So work on materials that you might send someone, like a cleaver
    postcard or weird mailing to get attention to your talent.

  body: Tara, one way to get noticed is to find out which agencies are currently or
    will soon be pitching new business. New business pitches are hectic and they usually
    need a lot of freelance help. Its a great way to get noticed. Trade journals usually
    list the businesses and agencies that are picked to make new business pitches.
    Its usually around four agencies.

    to do with my own issues, since I've been in a similar boat. We all want to find
    our dream jobs. I was just pointing out the fact that wouldn't it be a bit much
    if 80 people started threads saying they needed a job...this site would start
    being Craig's List after awhile. I'm a struggling designer too, that's why it
    bugs me a little. So, ignore that and please forgive me for commenting about it.
    That being said...\r\n\r\nSo far for me, there are not a lot of places hiring.
    Tara, you've been experiencing a lot of what my friends and I are experiencing,
    \"were not hiring\". In addition, many places seem willing to hire you on as a
    \"freelancer\" where you report to work daily, but get offered no benefits. So
    you have to pay out the \"wazoo\" for your own insurance. I hope this  helps,
    sorry to get all cosmic on you but\u2013 I'm a firm believer in karma. Be patient,
    believe in yourself and your abilities, pound the pavement, make some noise, someone
    will eventually recognize your skills. \r\n\r\nAlthough, I don't know whether
    any of that is true or not. I'm just hoping that it is. :) Your school's name
    carries a lot of weight in this town, I'd use that to your advantage as well."

    working for P22 and the thing they kept emphasizing is that networking is the
    way to find jobs in this day and age. i think whether explicitly or not, by its
    nature typophile is going to be a networking tool -- it's a place to become acquainted
    with folks in the type business, put your work up for critique, educate yourself
    on the craft, &c. I think it's only logical to allow for networking on this site
    (speaking from my own point of view, <em>not</em> as a moderator). i'd even like
    to see an area on the site dedicated soley to networking -- people looking for
    leads, people posting leads, &c. perhaps something like this would be more appropriate
    in the uppercase area, however. but i don't think that there's anything wrong
    with asking for some help here in the general discussion area either."

    off. I just met some great people at TypeCon and EVERYONE told me to sign up here
    so I figured that I would give it a shot. Not trying to stir the fire here, just
    trying to clarify my intentions. I've been doing an entirely independent search,
    where as most people in my school use the school's system to find jobs in and
    around Philly but that just wasn't my cup of tea. Believe me when I say this,
    I've been doing a LOT of footwork on my own and research and more looking and
    more researching. One more place for professional advice just seemed too good
    to pass up. Much respect for all the professionals and designers here, there was
    no intention to start what some might find 'an annoying trend'\r\n\r\n-Dave"

    I'm not sure if it works the same over there, but even if you can get to see the
    designer of your choice for a 30 minute chat, they can perhaps give you some advice
    \u2013 or with any luck give you contact details \u2013 other designers they may
    know personally \u2013 therein you could name drop. Be ruthless (but not rude).
    Don't give up. If you really want to do it and want to succeed you will not give
    up. It all sounds a bit clich\xE9, but it's true."
