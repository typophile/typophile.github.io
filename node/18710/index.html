They use a version called FuturaEF that appears to be incomplete. Does anyone out there know which digital version of Futura is considered to be the “best”? By that I mean most complete and well-drawn.

thanks for the help

		<div class="commentbody">I was going to mention that. It was one of the earliest fonts Adobe released and it is not real good, especially the Heavy weight. I just took a look at a PDF of the current version on Adobe's website. It's not quite as bad as the samples that Erik Spiekermann shows, so it appears they have made some alterations since it was first released, but it's still not great (in my opinion). The other weights aren't as bad, but notice also that the italics are all just slanted romans, not optically adjusted. I'm partial to Bitstream's cut, especially for text.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, Adobe's Futura surely isn't that good at all, for example if you set it without linespacing (as was called "Kompress" in the days of metal type over here in germany) ascenders and descenders will overlap. That surely woudln't have happened with metal type, so that's a technical fault to Adobe Futura, at least to my understanding.
On the best version, that's a bit down to personal taste i think, as the different digitizings have different approaches or emphasize different aspects and qualities of Futura:
The URW version seems to stress the somewhat elegant quality Futura has and appears pretty thin to me, whereas the Berthold BQ version seems much more stable and robust to me (and if you look at old prints of Futura, it surely had that quality as well and didn't come across as the super-elegant thing we're used to from cosmetics packagings and the like today!) 
So my personal vote would be for the BQ-version if i had to buy it – the strange thing is Futura is one of the faces i love, admire and respect the most – but never use it! :-)

p.s. besoides the best digizings issue, it's such a shame that the different optical sizes that were made for Futura metal didn't survive into the digital age…</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Our web site designer is recommending Futura MdCn BT for a couple of uses, notably titles. I want to revise templates in our publications to match the web site, but our analysts' needs are rather different from our web site designers....

Futura MdCn BT has about the ugliest micron char I've ever seen, and lacks all other Greek chars. The URW char set is much more complete. However, the [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/futura/t-medium-condensed/opentype-ps/261972/charmap.html?vid=261972&cpselect=UNI8|Greek section]] is inexplicably missing a only few chars (Omega, Delta and mu), which are naturally the ones we use in formulas the most frequently. The Greek version of the font has all those chars, but loses many mathematical operators. *sigh*

EF's Md Condensed has the Greek chars we need, the mathematical operators, and comes in ital, so that looks like the winner for now. I wish we could have small caps, too, but sometimes we have to be practical!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks Tiffany.
I never became eccessively affectionate with Futura, but I think the problem is that I have become accustomed to the typeface in its early digital formats. very limited, and based on a single point size, while I cherished a great number lead types which were still in use in the 1970s here in Italy.
For example, I think there is no comparision with the original Monotype lead version of Gill Sans in all its point sizes, and their digital version.

If someone will make the effort to design a few good master sizes, and with the quality which seems to have the Neufville Digital ND version (I think Robert Trogman is right about the accuracy), we will probably have an adequate Futura for every page format with all the needed sizes.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It's been a while since this discussion was active, but folks probably still end up here when searching so I'll toss in something I posted recently at Quora: <a href="http://www.quora.com/Typefaces/Which-foundrys-version-of-Futura-should-I-buy/answer/Stephen-Coles-1">a roundup of Futura versions</a> that might be a useful companion to Tiffany's post above.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Stephen Coles’ Quora roundup mentions that some of the variants contain Paul Renner’s “whacky” designs for several letters, but fails to mention which ones contain which designs and whether they make them easily available (several stylistic sets <code>ss……</code>, single stylistic alternates <code>salt</code>, several character variants <code>cv……</code> or a combination thereof). 

Also, I’ve seen at least 5 ‘a’, 4 ‘g’ and 3 ‘b’ variants. Does any Futura implementation contain several of them?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It seems Stefan Ellmer’s <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/13585057/Typeface-Ur-1927">Ur 1927</a> comes quite close to what I’m looking for. Examining your example site, I find that the dotted ‘r’, which I thought I particularly liked, doesn’t work well with ‘y’ following it – it’s a rare combination in German, but frequent in English, and a ‘u’-based upsilon might look better.

The Architype version I had seen already, but like with so many typefaces, it’s hard to find a good documentation of the actual glyph repertoire and OT features. (Font) designers tend to advertise their products with pretty examples <em>only</em>, forgetting about tech specs.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Crissov, It’s true that The Foundry (makers of Architype Renner) have never been great at showing off their fonts. They recently signed up with Fonts.com which improved things, but the <a href="http://www.fonts.com/font/the-foundry/architype-renner/regular?SiteId=224#character-map">Character Map viewer</a> there is not very capable either, omitting stylistic alternates such as the experimental forms you want to see.

LTC’s version of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/lanston/ltc-twentieth-century/?refby=typographica">Twentieth Century</a> (a metal copy of Futura) also includes these alts, however, and they are easily <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/lanston/ltc-twentieth-century/pro-medium/glyphs.html?refby=typographica">seen</a> and tested at MyFonts.
