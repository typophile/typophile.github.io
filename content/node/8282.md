  body: These look too grunge-y, in my opinion. The 30-year olds will remember their
    teenage years when they see this. It doesn&#39;t jive with the current, successful
    lifestyles thay have now. You need more glamour!

  body: You need to change the name or be sued. The Image Bank is a huge stock photo
    house with I would guess more than a few lawyers. Your only saving grace might
    be if the word &#34;The&#34; is part of their name.  <BR> <BR>As for the look,
    try exploring the name in a pixel font. Digital photos are the images of today
    and hip 30&#43; people will be looking for digital cameras.

    must inform them of their potential for legal action.  They most-likely are not
    aware.  You will probably be thanked profusely by them for saving them great expense
    and be given the opportunity to work on whatever new name they choose. <BR>You
    might also have them run their name through Thompson&amp;Thompson to see if any
    other conflicts occur. <BR> <BR>ChrisL'
