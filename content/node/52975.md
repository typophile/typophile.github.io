  i have to do a exhibition for her and design stuffs to promote that exhibition.
  I have chosen Marian Banjtes as my designer, i'm going to produce a poster,invitation
  card and commenmorative book to promote her exhibition. The outcomes must related
  to her style and the themes i have chose, which is 'Ornament, MB's way to rationalize
  emotions'. \r\n\r\nPlease leave any comment for the piece of art work i have done...Thank
  you very much=)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/poster 3_4791.jpg]\r\nPoster

  according to the graph paper, this is the way of MB's working method. I was trying
  to use her way to do it, hopefully...it comes out soemthing similar with her."

  body: "Wow, harsh crits.\r\n\r\nI think Bantjes style is hard to knock off because
    I'm still not convinced she was born on this planet. Her work has an other-world
    quality. To me her work shares a biological/organic quality similar to Margo Chase,
    but with smaller, more detailed ornament. If I were to try to mimic her work,
    I would try to imagine drawing an organic form on a grid, yet not always bound
    to symmetric growth.\r\n\r\nGood luck with it, and with luck maybe MB will pop
    in to give her opinion."

  body: "I'm afraid I have to agree with James (terminaldesign): this design really
    fails to capture what Marian's work is all about. Marian deliberately avoids using
    fonts in her work: it is all about melding lettering and ornament in ways that
    are only possible when both are made in the same way by the same hand. You can't
    get that effect by taking some fonts and some ornaments and slapping them together.
    It is worth noting that Marian's rejection of the use of fonts extends to her
    own typeface design, Restraint. For Marian, the Restraint font is the design,
    not something to be used in design. Of course, other people can use it, and perhaps
    it is something that you should consider: it is the easiest way to inject some
    genuine Bantjes elements into your poster.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.tiro.com/Restraint/index.html"

  body: "I am seeing something in your work that reminds me of Marian\u2019s work:
    the idea of drawing a complex design out geometry. That reflects the isometric
    perspective work she did for Typecon 2007 and the gridded sustainability piece
    she did for a paper company. I think that you can do much better by throwing this
    away and focusing on the kind of deep and thoughtful process behind Marian\u2019s
    work, so that you have something really special of your own instead of a poorly-informed
    attempt at aping her work. \r\n\r\nTry contacting Marian and see if she can send
    you the presentation she gave about the process behind the sustainability piece.
    Once you see that you\u2019ll understand what I mean and be in a better position
    to respond to her work with some of your own. "

    hand-drawn elements if you wish to "replicate" her style. There''s value in drawing
    first, even if you''re hand skills are terrible. Immersion is another element
    that will help. Surround yourself visually with things she has done that inspire
    you rather than interjecting your own interpretation of how she approaches her
    process. Have you contacted her directly? There may be some insight you can garner
    with specific questions that will help direct you. '

  body: "Your design isn't completely hopeless.\r\nI like the colours, and your small
    geometric components.\r\nBut there are several serious lapses of taste.\r\nFirstly,
    the square proportions are nasty.\r\nSecondly, the typefaces you have chosen are
    horribly kitsch; yeah they are fancy and ornamented, but not in a way that is
    relevant to design today, where designers are more thrilled by encrusting Helvetica
    with flourishes--a quite different kind of ornamentation.\r\nSo I would say change
    the proportions, and choose a face that Ms Bantjes might use in her work, such
    as FF Sanuk (for TypeCon 2007).\r\nAlso, you have three or four kinds of ornamentation
    going on: the quilt panes, the spirals, the star, and the type flourishes--it's
    better to limit the number of element classes.\r\n\r\nBear in mind that it's Your
    design for a gallery, you're not trying to do it as if she is self-publishing
    a book, so you could try to establish some kind of dialectic between what represents
    the work shown in the gallery, and the brand of the gallery. The usual way galleries
    do this is by going totally \"neutral\" and bland with their layout and typography,
    letting the work depicted create the vibe.\r\n\r\nSo, any one of the elements,
    contrasted against a plain type. But then, the viewer would wonder, is that ornamental
    thingy one of Bantje's? \r\n\r\nShow some Restraint?!"

    built onto this about 50 times further you would get something beginning to resemble
    something inspired by her work.\r\n\r\nHowever, I believe the trick to faithfully
    and respectfully represent Marian Bantjes is to get inside her head and work out
    from there. Pattyfab gave you gold with that link to her talk, but I think you
    have to dig even deeper into her, which probably means you have to dig inside
    your own head too.\r\n\r\nP.S. Thanks Pattyfab, I hadn't seen that talk yet."

  body: "I have never seen an exhibition catalog or associated collateral that attempted
    to mimic a featured artist\u2019s work. Certainly being chosen for a show would
    intimate that the work was original in voice to an extent that you should not
    try and do something in the style of. Having said that, most exhibitions do have
    access to images of the artist\u2019s work, and in some cases participation or
    original pieces specifically for a publication.\r\n\r\nI would rethink a bit from
    the start."

  body: Good point, jupiterboy. My assumption is this is an assignment where the professor
    has asked the students to replicate a designer's style in the form of promotional
    materials in order for the students to learn about the designer. The exercise
    is probably more about learning deconstructing how someone work than appropriately
    presenting an exhibit. However, this would be a great point to bring up at critique
    and discuss.

  body: "You don't necessarily have to imitate her style literally to be effective.
    You could opt to showcase a singular piece, using your own layout and typographic
    flavor and then elements of Bantjes work could be added for emphasis. Artistry
    that unique is hard to duplicate. As some contributors noted, exhibition promotional
    pieces are not always replications of featured work. \r\n\r\nBecause her work
    is so stunning, I wouldn't try to compete with it, it's so distinctive that it
    speaks for itself. Possibly you could use a san serif sparingly where bits of
    her work could \"lop\" over it, all against a simple background. Start with her
    website to see how she mixes the \"organic\" with a serious underlying of geometric
    structure and work from there.\r\n\r\nBut because this is \"your\" project, you
    should come through too."

  body: "If you're looking for inspiration, why not contact her directly?  Most designer
    types are quite flattered when someone, especially a student, shows an interest
    in their work. The impression I've always gotten from her writings is that she's
    not completely full of herself. She might even be able to suggest an archetypal
    piece of hers that you can use to build your program around.  \r\n\r\nI agree
    that you should probably not try to duplicate her style. She's a one-off, not
    prone to much imitation. Find a way to present her designs in a supporting context
    that can show your understanding of her work. I assume that's the real point of
    the class project anyway."

  body: "Not sure if I even agree with the premise of the challenge: To promote a
    particular visual artist that has a very strong and unique visual style by emulating
    their own style?\r\n\r\nNo matter how talented of a designer one may be, they're
    still just trying to emulate someone else's well-known style, so it'll always
    pale in comparison.\r\n\r\nSo, in many ways, pris is trying to do the impossible.
    \r\n\r\nIf you must do this project, I'd suggest going for an 'essence' rather
    than a 'duplicate' of her style. Do your own thing with some tie to what she does,
    but don't try to emulate her actual style. \r\n\r\n"

  body: Well you are getting at it. I might have not picked the talent I most liked
    but rather have a go at a historical figure or movement. A group show is an interesting
    in. That usually dictates you can't feature one artist over another or someone
    gets hurt about it. That is a fine time for a committee to decide they need a
    typographic approach.
