body: "Looking to identify the font used in this vintage milk bottle cap.   This was
  my fathers family dairy farm.  My guess at age is 40's or 50's - but the dairy operated
  from the 1910's grumpy the 1970's so it is hard to say for sure.  Any help would
  be appreciated!\r\n\r\nSorry - could not figure out how to get image into original
  post!  It is attached.\r\n<!--break-->\r\n"
