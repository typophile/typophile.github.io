body: "Hi!\r\nI am very new to designing typefaces. This is my first attempt. So please
  spare a couple of minutes to tell me how I can improve it and carry it forward.
  I was wondering if the letters 'v' and 'x' looked like they belonged to the family.
  Similarly I am not happy with the 's'. But please give me your views on it. Thank
  you!\r\n\r\nVinu Chaitanya\r\nGraphic Design student\r\nIndia\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/vinu_4385.jpg]"

  body: Why not let two connectors narrow at the center of the x in the manner of
    the top of your b - for instance the lower right & upper left ones? Same thing
    for the join at the base of the v. It looks bloated so a slice out will make it
    better I think. Why not the right side? The l looks too narrow to me. Maybe it's
    just this rendering. To solve for the s - look around. This is not an uncommon
    kind of 1st font. One way to begin might be rounding those corners.
