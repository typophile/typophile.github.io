  Grandin Building is the historic publication place of <em>The Book of Mormon</em>.
  The building has been preserved as a printing museum, which captures the printing
  process that would have been followed in the early 19th century. If you don't mind
  a bit of prosletysing, the tour is very interesting and informative.\r\n\r\n<strong>Links:</strong>\r\n\r\n<a
