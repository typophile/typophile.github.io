    main lettering is [[http://www.losttype.com/font/?name=outage|Outage]], hard to
    say for me the 2 other ones.\r\nVINTAGE INFUSTRIAL: I'm pretty convinced you'll
    find it out in this [[http://typophile.com/node/105488#comment-562631|post]].
    Without too much thinking, I guess [[http://www.houseind.com/fonts/unitedcollection|United]]
    Sans and Serif should do you job for both lettering and digit."

  body: "Ryuk, thank you for your reply. I am only looking for the main-title type.
    I believe [[http://www.losttype.com/font/?name=outage|Outage]] is on target for
    THE STRENGTH GUYS and for VINTAGE INDUSTRIAL, I would say is [[http://www.losttype.com/font/?name=liberator|Liberator]].
    I had looked at [[http://www.houseind.com/fonts/unitedcollection|United Sans]]
    on HI but the \"I\" differs, however, it may be used for the digit and other letters.
    \r\n\r\nWould you happen to know the type in the image below for the cinema/theatre
    name that says \"Oriental\"? It looks very near to something like Outage again,
    but unsure. Thanks again for your help. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cinema_5541.png]"

    nice type faces. I'm looking at [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/home-room/regular/|Home
    Room JNL]] as well as [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/eckhardt-poster-display/|Eckhardt
    Poster Display JNL]]. \r\n\r\nThey remind me of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/chank/liquorstore/|Liquor
    Store]] by [[http://chank.com/index.php|Chank Diesel]] which is another option
    I'm considering.\r\n\r\nMy plate is full and I'm going to see which one fits best.
    Thanks for your time, it's greatly appreciated!"
