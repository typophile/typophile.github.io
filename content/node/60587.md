body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nSome time around 1990 I purchased a Linotype L100 PostScript capstan
  imagesetter to typeset galleys for pasteup. As far as I know, this was the first
  high-resolution PostScript device (up to 1270dpi).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I don't
  have space for it, and it will be have to be scrapped if I cannot find a better
  home for it. It was working when decommissioned and is basically complete but has
  sustained some minor damage to main circuit board during transit.\r\n\r\nContact
  me here...\r\n\r\n--Toby"
