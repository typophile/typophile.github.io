  body: Or you could take something like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/windsor-mt/windsor-mt/">Windsor</a>

  body: "couldnt this be a heavily distorted <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/cooper/black/\"
    target=\"_blank\">cooper black</a>? the serifs on the A have show a weight-proportion
    like cooper black, and the rest could easily fit, too.\r\n\r\nbut wow, this is
    ugly."
