body: "Hello Typophiles! A quick introduction before I decide to use this forum as
  a stomping ground. Y'know, running around here with a long hypodermic syringe, exhaustively
  draining your type-cyclopedic minds of every millilitre of type knowledge you ever
  cared to absorb. An exaggeration? Maybe. But it always pays to introduce yourself.\r\n\r\nMy
  name is Tom Sheppard, I study Typographic design at the old London College of Print,
  something I am beginning to regret. I originally decided to study the subject because
  I honestly felt like it was the most prolificent aspect of graphic design and I
  knew nothing about it. If I was going to blow 15k on a degree, I would study something
  I was a complete amature at. \r\n\r\nInstead of slandering the institution itself,
  I will say that typography is something that is very difficult to learn without
  practice and the almost constant supervision of someone superior to yourself. Bad
  type is in abundance, everywhere, and as the media age swells at an alarming rate,
  I believe people are becoming more sensetive to variation, readability and legibility
  of the typography that surrounds them.\r\n\r\nWhat I am trying to say is that I
  am a struggling Typographic student who is far too lucid to abide by strict typographic
  rules and regulations but realises their importance in good graphic design.\r\n\r\nI
  hope to break free of my (type) habbits and would like to ask you all nicely to
  kneel down, close your eyes and allow me to feast on your brains.\r\n\r\nSee you
  around"

  body: "Firstly welcome,\r\n\r\nIn response to a couple of your points:\r\n\r\nAs
    soon as you leave college employers won't really care much what you specifically
    studied, it will be down to your book and personality.\r\n\r\nGood typography,
    post college is often left to the conscience/ability of the individual or not!,
    due in part to the keeping clients happy/last minute culture of 'professional
    graphic design' hence your comment about bad type in abundance."
