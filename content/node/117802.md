    guidelines merely as reference points and the contours of each letter pretty much

    I think letterpress typefaces usually aren't designed to be warm but become warm
    due to the printing technique. The same kind of effect could be applied digitally
    in principle. These irregularities are random and have nothing to do with the
    control you exert over the design of the typeface.\r\n\r\nSo I think first you
    should define what you mean by a warm typeface or at the very least you should
    consider that warmth can be applied both to the design of the typeface as well
    as the effect. What Hoefler is talking about is the effect. In essence you could
    take a very cold typeface and apply the random irregularities Hoefler mentions
    and it becomes warm. That's different from DESIGNING a warm typeface."

    for warmth.\"\r\n\r\nThat's completely besides the point. The fact remains that
    blobby effects do add warmth. Earlier Hrant argued that shapes have inherent values
    and rounded shapes invoke warmth and friendliness. Whether you utilize rounded
    forms in the design of the typeface itself or utilize the rounded shapes which
    come from inaccurate printing methods, in both cases it adds warmth. One type
    of warmth may be undesirable to some but that's besides the point.\r\n\r\nThe
    design of a typeface should always start with considering the larger structure.
    However, I think if you want to go for a warm look you will often utilize some
    of the features I talked about fairly early on in the design process, rather than
    applying it as a post-effect. I absolutely don't believe Hoefler was suggesting
    that you can create authentic warm typefaces by (merely) making use of post-effects.
    I think what he was suggesting is that these are tools to utilize in making your
    typeface warmer. My research into Bram de Does' and Evert Bloemsma's work lead
    me to the conclusion that seeing type as fluid will do remarkable things in regard
    to the vividness and warmth of the typeface, and the use of erratic baselines
    \u2013 as Hoefler suggests \u2013 is a pretty powerful instrument to do this.
    In fact, Garamond utilizes this as well in a subtle way.  But speaking of bumpiness
    and rounded edges, look at how fluid of a typeface Garamond is. THAT's what makes
    it so warm. So, you're right Garamond has inherent warmth, exactly because of
    some of the things Hoefler talks about. I don't quite understand how you can dismiss
    Hoefler's quote and yet name Garamond, in which everything he talks about is utilized.
    Am I missing something?\r\n\r\n\"We did not seek to add it in for warmth. Why
    would I want to do that now?\"\r\nI think this is just your philosophy though.
    Looking at certain typefaces done by professional designers strongly seems to
    suggest that.\r\n\r\nBesides, I can understand that you want to utilize a specific
    technique as best you can. Obviously you would try to avoid the blobby effect
    as much as you can to be considered a master at this craft, but looking back on
    older techniques I think we feel rather nostalgic about certain random effects
    and the more fluid appearance you get by utilizing these printing techniques.
    Isn't adding warmth to our typefaces a reference to classical typography?\r\n\r\nThe
    more I talk, the more I get the feeling \"fluid\" is pretty much a keyword. A
    fluid appearance can be achieved by chirographic forms, by not repeating elements,
    by a dynamic display of lines, by unexpected curves, by rounded shapes, by irregularities
    in color and by erratic baselines. Why dismiss half of those as merely an effect?
    Why not consider them as part of the whole design process?"

    to become more familiar with chirography will give me more insight into what is

    into type in general from doing calligraphy. I suppose that's where I depart from
    Noordzij's theory of the stroke but I consider it a good thing to be well versed

    quite the opposite. I'm using it to experiment. The process of digital design
    is rigid so my calligraphy work is a way to sketch out ideas. Do note, it's A
    way. I don't consider it THE way.\r\n\r\n\"As for \"fluidity\", the thing to keep
    in mind is that it applies less (and even becomes an obstacle) the closer you
    get to reading (as opposed to consciously looking at shapes).\"\r\n\r\nI have
    the feeling you somewhat misunderstand what I mean by fluidity. Fluidity may be
    present in a typeface (as in Legato) but predominantly fluidity is a way of looking
    at type rather than a style. I see type as a black dot of paint which you want
    to keep in balance with the white at all times. If you move some black to the
    left, some black also needs to be moved to the right to keep it in balance. Imbalance
    may be added but this needs to be done subconsciously. What I consider fluidity
    is looking at type like it's a liquid which needs to be balanced at all times.
    Essentially this is done by any type designer but I feel Legato is a nice example
    of where it shows that the designer was highly conscious of this principle and
    thus managed to play with it in non-intuitive ways (anti-calligraphic as you say).
    He does strange things without making the typeface look unbalanced. I feel like
    most typefaces don't quite behave like that. They're balanced, but due to their
    more conservative features they're at a lower risk to become unbalanced, too.
    I think \"fluidity\" is the next step into the perception of what type is supposed
    to be which we are slowly making but we're not quite there yet. We still think
    too rigidly in general.\r\n\r\nThis whole talk about the distinctions between
    \"macro\" and \"micro\" elements to make typefaces warmer or colder to me is evident
    of the notion that we haven't quite made that step yet. If you think of type as
    fluid, it makes absolutely no sense to disregard what Hoefler said as though it's
    just a post-effect. I'm not defending post-effects in this context and I highly
    doubt Hoefler was talking about post-effects."

    already responded to this well but I have one more thing to add. I completely
    agree with you here but in reality there is no distinction. We essentially live
    in a loveless world and yet by being here we do experience love because we make
    it so. Sharp edges inherently have no meaning, but almost any living organism
    with the ability to reflect will view sharp edges as something unpleasant, because
    to most it physically is. Hence we learn to associate sharp edges with unpleasantness
    and soft edges with the opposite. It does nothing to say that this is inherently
    not true. It may have relevance in some philosophical/metaphysical discussions
    but I don't see the implications within type design.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think that
    warmth is a property of a single thing (see above my answer to hrant) but instead
    it is how we perceive the page as a whole. Making it appear warm might just mean

    that geometry which we associate with coldness."

  body: "I agree with the opinion that a sense of warmth depends on curves, smoothness
    and small irregularities.\r\n\r\nThe reason may be that these properties are evocative
    of the shapes found in humans/other organic beings, the shapes found in pleasent
    and comfortable objects in the physical world (like a soft feather bed), and a
    notion of freedom from restrictions.\r\n\r\nFor example, Willberg compared the
    letters of humanist typefaces like Garamond with wanderers, and those of classicist
    typefaces like Walbaum with soldiers.  The rounded forms of a Garamond are reminiscent
    of a human\u2019s natural posture.  The straight lines and perfection in Walbaum
    on the other hand are something found in humans only if external restrictions
    are imposed, like in the case of soldiers forced to show an unnatural behaviour.\r\n\r\ndezcom:

    phototype.  It does not look more warm to me, it just looks like poor quality."

  body: To me it looks like both; it looks poor yet warmer. It would look a lot warmer
    if the black would bleed out a bit though. Right now it looks like there is an
    overexposure of white. The /e looks particularly distorted because of that.
