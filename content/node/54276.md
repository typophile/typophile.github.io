  the Mexico City Metro line. Which is the 2nd largest subway network behind New York
  in North America? I've tried many sources and about to exhaust all avenues.\r\n\r\nThanks
  everyone,\r\n\r\nKeisuke"

  body: This must surely be customised letters for this logotype. Similar style could
    be found at House Industries. Check out their typeface family Chalet.

  body: "<a href=\"http://www.haroldsfonts.com/metro.html\">metro DF</a> by Harold
    Lohner was inspired by this look: \r\n\r\n<em>\xBBMETRO-DF was inspired by a trip
    to Mexico City. The official signage of the Mexico City subway uses a peculiar
    adaptation of the classic font Eurostile, designed by Aldo Novarese. The capital
    E was most unusual. The overall feel was of a past vision of the future, with
    a distinctively Mexican touch. (The squared circle, or rounded square, is very
    common in both old and new Mexican design.\xAB</em>\r\n\r\n\r\n"
