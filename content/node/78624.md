  Age Gothic]] is an original design by Alex Kaczun. It is a contemporary gothic design
  based on generous proportions and clean crisp lines. Ideally suited for easy reading
  and long lines of copy. The concept for the design came from a previously successful
  font family [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typeinnovations/contax-pro/|Contax Pro]].
  Alex felt that the skeleton for Contax Pro was ideally suited to modify the design
  into a true gothic companion typeface series. Numerous modifications where made
  to the body proportions, stems and shapes. Serifs where added reminiscent to Copperplate
  Gothic to solidify the overall design. The result is a truly unique modern gothic
  font. Unlike other typefaces, New Age Gothic incorporates uniform stems throughout
  the capitals, lower case and figures. This gives the design a uniform appearance
  in overall color and strength. There is a perfect visual balance between inter-letter
  spacing, stem weights and proportions.\r\nThe large Pro font character set, which
  supports most Central European and many Eastern European languages, also include
  small caps to compliment the old style figures. As a result, the design is ideally
  suited for display copy as well as text composition.\r\n\r\nIn the near future,
  Alex plans to expand the typeface to include a broad range of weights along with
  italics.\r\n\r\nAvailable for download at:\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typeinnovations/new-age-gothic/"
