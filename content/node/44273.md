  body: "The font is an Arts & Crafts-era type, originally designed in 1916 by Elizabeth
    Colwell as \"Colwell Handletter\" and released by American Type Founders in 1923.\r\n\r\nSeveral
    free versions of the font exist, all of various quality and faithfulness to the
    original.\r\n\r\nNick Curtis' <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/mckenna-handletter-nf/\">
    McKenna Handletter NF</a> is based fairly closely on Colwell's work.\r\n\r\nApostrophic
    Lab's <a href=\"http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/lab/lab_colwell.htm\">
    Colwell </a> is rougher and includes several alternate forms, but moves slightly
    further afield from the original.\r\n\r\nThe H. P. Lovecraft Historical Society
    also offers a nice, if rough, version, called <a href=\"http://www.cthulhulives.org/toybox/PROPDOCS/PropFonts.html\">
    HPLHS-Colwell </a>.\r\n\r\nOther digitized versions of this type have been available
    in the past from several typefoundries that have apparently become defunct.\r\n\r\nPrinted
    samples are also available in various Solotype books, so they may offer a digitized
    version as well, although I haven't been able to find them.\r\n\r\nDavid Thometz"
