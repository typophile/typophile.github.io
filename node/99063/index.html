I'm a graphic designer who wants to learn more about typography then what I learned in school... which is almost nothing. So excuse me for picking fonts just based on first look, and not looking in to that deeper, since I never really learned to do that. As a graphic design student we learned a bit of everything, but nothing in-depth.

I'm trying to learn about typography from you guys and from other resources on the net. 

Also trying to contribute to the forum, and not just asking away and never giving back.

It's pretty quirky. I bought the set packaged as "for Letterpress," and that's what I intend to use it for. The small caps with a bit of spacing are extremely elegant, while the bolder italic is so curious -- I think it's got a bit of the ugly in it (referring to Karloff, here), but in an endearing way!

		<div class="commentbody">Fair enough, but for one thing all the fonts you mentioned are older than 2012. Or maybe you meant fonts that you/we personally admired and/or used most in 2012? In my case though the answer wouldn't change.  :-)

BTW one useful skill to acquire is the ability to spot (and avoid) fonts that are merely posers, that leech off of existing designs. There's a lot of those, especially these days.

No worries, my post wasn’t meant to trash your selections—I was just exploring the idea you introduced, and moving the thread along. If those were your favorite fonts, they were your favorite fonts. Next year, your criteria might change. I would no doubt have pimped one of my own designs—if I had published any in 2012!</div>

About Benton and Karloff ... since I'm a rookie here, I'll explain why I like Benton:  it's because Benton looks wider than Karloff, I tend to like wider fonts more, because they seem more "friendly". 

As for hrant, the fonts I chose are fonts that I used over a year ago, but I'm still happy about. They don't have to be new. Like Coca-Cola is this years favorite drink, although Coca-Cola already exists for so long.

Anyway, I would love to discover more fonts by more listmakers :)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Last — sorry — this year, the fonts I turned to when doing the occasional job were Brioni by Typotheque and National by Klim/Village. And my sig-font Locator by ProcessType. 
I didn’t buy as much as I did in other years, but amongst those were KLTF Tiptoe, News Gothic (didn’t have the OT-version yet, and it has been a fav for 30 years), LT Vesta, LT Neue Frutiger Condensed (the new additions, have to keep up), Fontspring Nexa, FF Akko Rounded. 
And I confess that I took advantage of some offers of free fonts (the stock market did not quite perform to expectations… So there was a need for that).
Next year I am going to produce my second font and hopefully recoup some of the expense : )</div>

Designed by Ana Sanfelippo at CDT-UBA, and released as a Libre font for Google Webfonts [img:sites/default/files/old-images/02almendra02_5804.gif]

Wilmington by Bomparte is also very impressive to me.
It really looks like natural writing if you activate 'salt' and 'calt' OT features. 
That's not easy to get right, but this one works like a charm.
