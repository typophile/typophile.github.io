body: "Hi,\r\nI was just wondering if anybody on the forum might know what happened
  to Dink fonts ? Are they still around ? Several google searches yielded no response.
  As I recall, Dink specialised in American vernacular font design, designs from the
  50's, period pieces\u2026 I wanted to show their site to one of my students, but
  I seem quite unable to find any trace whatsoever.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any
  help\u2026\r\n\r\nbest wishes,\r\n\r\npete"
