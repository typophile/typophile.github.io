body: Our firm is working on an id for a restaurant/nightclub with a New Orleans &#43;
  Mardi Gras theme. While doing research, we were curious about any fonts that may
  have that feel or be of that location &#40;authentic?&#41;. In other words, are
  there any fonts more specific to New Orleans and/or the French Quarter? Would something
  French be appropriate? Any help or ideas would be appreciated. <BR> <BR>Thanks,
  <BR>Addison

    <BR> <BR>Seriously, anything else you can tell us about the club? Does it want
    to seem old and grand or new and hip? What&#39;s the demo of the guests?

  body: The interior is the older French Quarter baroque/rococo style with a funky
    twist--ornate furniture, rich textures, and deep colors &#40;at least that&#39;s
    what I&#39;m told&#41;. I&#39;m offering help to the designer working on this,
    and I think he&#39;s wanting to incorporate a mask or some other ornamental elements
    with the type. I feel like he&#39;s going for something more sophisticated...
    <BR> <BR>As far as I know, the client hasn&#39;t offered any demographics.

  body: I&#39;ve been in love with <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/jawfonts/baroque-text-jf/">Baroque
    Text</a> lately. When I think of funky-ornate, rich, and old, I think Baroque
    Text.

  body: I like it! It may be too ornate for the designer working on it, but I&#39;ve
    passed it on anyway. Thanks for taking an interest. <BR> <BR>-Addison

  body: y&#39;know there is a popular New Orleans style restaurant out there called
    Copelands you should check out. I think they do a great job of design and branding.
    <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t get sucked into using really over the top display fonts to
    wrap your brand around. I&#39;ve seen too many Mexican restaurants that use Fajita
    as their headline . . . <BR> <BR>I think a nice Jill Bell hand lettering job would
    be called for. Send her an e-mail . . . <BR> <BR>My 2

    The Storm stuff went over really well, I don&#39;t know why I didn&#39;t think
    of that! Tiffany, I dig Vendome, too, but he didn&#39;t go for it. <BR> <BR>Stuart,
    does Jill Bell have a website with samples? <BR> <BR>Tom, are you serious? It
    says &#34;typography&#34; and not &#34;topography?&#34; <BR> <BR>Thanks again,

  body: 'Modern typography in the French Quarter is about as easy as finding type
    consistency in Times Square. If you want the nostalgic French Quarter look, I&#39;d
    recommend something hand-lettered with lots of swashes. Ancienne and the Copeland&#39;s  restaurant
    &#40;<a href="http://www.copelands.net/copelands/copeland.asp" target="_blank">http://www.copelands.net/copelands/copeland.asp</a>&#41;
    are nice suggestions. Think Herb Lubalin&#39;s serif logotypes with a little less
    structure. Regardless, those are good suggestions up top. As for logos, here&#39;s
    the usual fare for the city: Fleur de Lis, crescent, and Mardi Gras masks'
