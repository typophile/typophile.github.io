  _\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/15361 _\r\n\r\nNormally I would have waited for #3
  to run its course,\r\nbut this scrap of paper on my desk is driving me crazy\r\nso
  I'm just going to throw this out:\r\n\r\nPoppl Laudatio has been one of my favorite
  fonts since\r\nthe mid-90s. I especially like to use it for on-screen\r\nwork because
  it's so shallow* without being devoid of\r\ncharacter - in fact it's one of the
  very few fonts that\r\nI use both (very) small/lo-fi and very large. I think\r\nPoppl
  really knew what he was doing, and we're very\r\nlucky to have such a design available.\r\n\r\n*
  http://typophile.com/node/15367\r\n\r\n<strong>The thing is, many people always
  complain about its\r\nampersand. You can think \"they need an education\" but\r\nthe
  fact remains it can be useful to have a \"conventional\"\r\nampersand for it. So
  let's make one.</strong>\r\n\r\nBeing a Berthold font it's become hard to view through\r\nother
  font houses (can't really blame them I guess)* like the\r\nalways-great-for-a-preview
  Myfonts. You can see a cruddy\r\nGIF** on their site, but I would recommend downloading
  the\r\nthe PDF that shows all their \"Hybrid\" fonts, from here:\r\nhttp://www.bertholdtypes.com/bq_library/BQ_library.html\r\n\r\n*
  In fact I'd strongly recommend remaining squeaky-clean-legal\r\n  on this one. Maybe
  read the PDF usage conditions on their site,\r\n  and definitely only work with
  just renderings of the letterforms,\r\n  not original outlines.\r\n\r\n** http://www.bertholdtypes.com/bq_library/90089.html\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: <a href="http://www.philsfonts.com">Phil's Fonts</a> has pretty decent previews
    of Berthold character sets. If I were to buy a Berthold font, that's where I'd
    go.
