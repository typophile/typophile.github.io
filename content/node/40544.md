    saw that recent Norwegian school books from different publishing houses (Tingleff
    Forlag, Det Norske Samlaget, Cappelen) all use <a href=\"http://www.clubtype.co.uk/\">Sassoon
    Primary</a> (see picture) \u2013 but this one is different. If you can find out
    more about the source \u2026 highly appreciated.\r\n\r\nOh, I see you are a designer
    <em>and</em> a teacher in elementary school \u2026 get ready for some more questioning!
    ;\xB0) Seriously, I\u2019d like to get in contact with you. My email: forename-at-surname.com.\r\nThanks!

    the ....?\" (I'm not sure how to translate \"matskapet\", but it's kinda like
    a refrigerator.)\r\n\r\nI know my school have licensed Sassoon, which we use for
    mostly all our material.\r\n\r\nflorian-at-hardwig.com?\r\nI've sent you an e-mail.\r\n\r\n"

    something like this:\r\n\r\nHow you see that an elephant have been in the fridge?
    \r\nFootprints in the liver pate.\r\n\r\nHow do you see that there is an elephant
    in the fridge?\r\nHis tricycle is parked next to it."

    door, take out the elephant, and put in the giraffe.\r\n\r\nQ. The lion king calls
    all the animals to a big meeting. Who doesn't show up?\r\nA. The giraffe - he's

    of your suggestions matches the x-height. Actually the ascenders and descenders
    are as tall as the x-height. \r\nI believe the original font is called \"Stavskrift\".
    It's used for education in Norway, but I haven't found it anywhere in digital
