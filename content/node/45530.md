body: "Hi all. I read a thread on here which brought up the issue of 'the best roman
  serif font' very interesting and from it I am considering Jenson, Trade Gothic,
  Granjon & Baskerville as the body copy font for my new magazine. \r\nThe magazine
  is an A5 publication predominantly consisting of listings pages, lists - gigs, events,
  venue directory etc. There are also a few feature pages. \r\nDoes anyone have any
  thoughts on weather I should us a different font for listings maybe a sans serif
  and then the serif for all other copy. I was concerned this could get messy as it
  it is only a 24pp magazine at present.\r\nI am struggling more so with finding a
  header font to compliment my serif. The client need the guide to be functional yet
  stylish and trendy as it's main target audience is students. Being a purist about
  my type I would like to have a header font which really compliments the body copy
  so there is a natural flow on the page. I have considered using a large bold version
  of the body copy font but I don't think the client will find this funk ebough. Does
  anyone know of any fonts which maybe have an abstract version of the, maybe a serif
  that then has a chopped up version or something ??\r\n\r\nMany thanks for any tips
  and thoughts re the magazine layout too. This is my first freelance job out of uni
  and while I am only getting \xA3150 per month for designing all of the 5 cities
  we cover editions of this I wanna make it good!"

    Big Caslon for heads and pulls, and Myriad Pro for your listings. This will cover
    just about every situation you might run into, and if you\u2019re running Creative
    Suite on OS X, you already have the fonts."
