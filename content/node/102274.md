  bleak\r\nI know your girl a freak\r\nWe doing positions like a ligature\r\nKama
  Sutra, she read that literature\r\nThis song ain\u2019t over, this just the overture\r\n\r\nHop
  up in the Cadillac, I\u2019m riding slab serif\r\nI run this town, everybody call
  me the sheriff\r\nA nick gets sold in the park, I gets paid a tariff\r\nMy flow
  got the manual kerning\r\nSon, you best get to learning\r\nIf you yearning for what
  I\u2019m earning\r\nMy enemies, I leave \u2018em burning\r\nWith jealousy. F*ck

  kid an orphan\r\nWack emcees, I don\u2019t listen to y\u2019all raps\r\nCome at
  me with your crew, I\u2019m peeling all caps\r\nAt every concert I get mobbed by
  fans\r\nI\u2019m Times New Roman, you Comic Sans"

    blog</a>.\r\n\r\nEveryone, feel free to add to this. I'm sure there's a lot of
    terms I haven't thought of. Even if you can't make a rhyme, just give me a couple
    words and I'll see what I can do.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to add the line \"Shout out
    to Johannes Gutenberg\" but not sure how to rhyme it."
