body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nWe have a new font that is being released called Louisiana. An Art
  Director that I do work for has the most beautiful handwriting I have ever seen.
  So I asked her if she would like to make a font together and this is what we came
  up with :)\r\n\r\nI had to modify and correct some of the forms to make it work
  as a font. \r\n\r\nWe are very pleased with the end result.\r\n\r\n-Charles Borges

    do replacement ligatures for duplicate characters together (sunny, Hawaii, Cookies)
    to make it look more realistic.\r\n\r\n\r\nNick Cooke"

  body: "Thanks guys. Nice suggestion Nick. I had made a bunch of ligatures for this
    font but fontlab didnt like the new ligatures. Anytime I introduced new kerning
    to the font I would keep getting an error message when generating the font \"causes
    overflow of offset to a subtable (0x11a00\" It was frustrating so I had to bag
    the new ligatures and just keep the current ones. It is interesting to note that
    she is left handed which I believe may give to the slight italic slant.\r\n-Charles"
