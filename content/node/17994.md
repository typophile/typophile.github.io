body: "Couldn't find anything here about this.  But I am really annoyed with this.\r\n\r\nI
  am working on a business card design and the dotted line border isn't perfect.  The
  corners aren't the same, sometimes they have a dot at the exact corner, sometimes
  a space.  No matter how much I tweek the spacing of the dashes etc. I can't get
  it to be perfect.\r\n\r\nOne thing that would work is if I could expand the object
  and just finesse the dots manually.  But it just turns into a solid line when expanded.\r\n\r\nAny
  help here would be appreciated.  That dotted line is going to be blind embossed
  so I really would like to get it right.\r\n\r\nHere's a pic:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/comp2.jpg]"

  body: I'd suggest a row of aligned shapes rather than a dotted line; then you could
    finesse all you want.

    make a blend, expand, and distribute/align..."

  body: "To make a row of aligned shapes really fast, you could do this: \r\nCreate
    the first shape and put it at the extreme left position, then holding shift and
    alt, drag it to the right approximately the distance you want between each dot,
    and release everything - that'll make a copy of the first shape, in the new position.
    Then press CTRL+D several times. For each time you press, a new object will be
    created at the same distance from the former. Once you fill the whole width of
    the card, fine tune using distribute/align and you're done. \r\n(Maybe you knew
    this already, but anyway...)"

  body: The  problem with the aligned shapes method is that your intervals have to
    work both horizontally and vertically which is tough to do. I don't know why Illustrator
    can't fix this glitch thru all these versions.

  body: you actually can expand a automatically created dashed line into individual
    dots. its really a stupid thing that when you do it the normal way that it reverts
    back to a solid line though. anyways, here is how you do it. in your preferences
    setting in illustrator, change the transparency flattening setting temporarily
    to all vectors (on the slider bar, move it all the way to the right i think).
    then choose that line, and flatten it. This is the only way I have ever been able
    to figure out how to do this in illustrator.

      click and you have a expanded dashed line.

  body: "You can also use the type along a path feature, using bullet points and justification.\r\n\r\nI'd
    check with your print finisher to see if they are happy to attempt blind embossing
    those dots, I think it will be tremendously difficult to accurately emboss a large
    number of business cards, especially that close to the edge. Also the weight and
    type of the card will affect the final effect (too heavy and absorbent and the
    dots will start to join). Of course it is possible but it might stretch the budget.\r\nTim"
