  blue in the  financial tables. Is blue still visible when you copy it on an old
  black&white? In other words does the blue turn in to grey or white?\r\ncheers"

  body: "Most regular copiers do reproduce even a non-photo blue (which is pretty
    darn light) as a light gray. Generally, copiers do some local contrast enhancement,
    so even if the shade of gray gets a little dark, any black text on top of it should
    be perfectly readable.\r\n\r\nMy personal design philosophy is that anything that
    can't survive a fax of a photocopy is not clear enough."
