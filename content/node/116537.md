  body: "Adrian Frutiger designed President -- already identified by akira1975 --
    for Deberny & Peignot in 1954. It is the closest match. http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/president/
    and http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/president/ \r\nThree years later he designed
    the very similar font, Merdien -- the main difference is the leg on the R -- for
    Deberny & Peignot. Sold under this name by Linotype http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/meridien/
    and Adobe http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/meridien/ A silgntly revised version
    is Akira Kobayashi's Frutiger Serif Pro http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/frutiger-serif/\r\nIn
    1964 Adrian Frutiger designed the very similar Apollo for Monotype. This is the
    first new type face designed specifically for Monophoto filmsetters. http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/apollo/
    and http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/apollo/\r\nThis letter design originated
    with the 19th century fonts known as Lightface Celtic.\r\nSearching Cyrillic font
    sources with any of these five names might turn up a Cyrillic version.\r\nDon"
