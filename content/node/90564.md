  would love any suggestions of similar fonts because I am trying to redo the logo.

  body: If you are matching the Clorox logo for a positive reason for them, ask Clorox
    for the artwork.  I am sure they will be happy for the publicity.  If you have
    some other purpose, just draw it.  It is a pretty simple job for anyone who is
    a professional graphic designer.  Notice the little circled "Registered mark"
    however.
