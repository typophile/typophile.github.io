  a wedding invitation by William Arthur. I looked on-line but they don't list font
  names only numbers.\r\nI do not mind purchasing the font. I have hundreds of fonts
  on my computer to look through but this one is not\r\nfamiliar. Any help would be
  much appreciated.  The actual name or additional names would be great."

    What I do with large typophile images is to download them as a jpeg and open in
    a viewer that I can push off to one side of the screen while I use the other part
    of the screen for searching. Looked for this script but failed. Hope one of our
    typophiles finds it for you.\r\nDon"

    art he did for The Band's \"Jericho\" Album? I'm painting a replica of the art
    for my brother and would like to create stencils to match it.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's
    driving me bonkers trying to find it. Futura is close, but I'm looking for perfection
    here :)\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nDustin\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jericho_mega

    The font you\u2019re looking for is Lithos Bold, though. "

    Jolie & Parfumerie Script.\r\nIf you would be satisfied with a similar font with
    \"a custom hand lettered/flourished look\" that was \"created with Brides and
    Invitation Designers in mind\" by \"a calligrapher [who] has worked with brides
    for many years [who] loved the look of hand lettered calligraphy, [but whose]
    budgets limited their use of it,\" you might try <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/correspondence-ink/belluccia/\">Belluccia</a>."
