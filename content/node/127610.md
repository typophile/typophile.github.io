  in the Massachusetts Statehouse. Pictures are from the Spanish American War Memorial
  in the Massachusetts Statehouse, 'signed' by Calvin Coolidge in 1919.\r\nhttp://www.waymarking.com/gallery/image.aspx?f=1&guid=01d29da6-4427-48ce-a8d6-164acd8085a0\r\n\r\nR
  and W are reminiscent of a \"low-contrast Garamond,\" but it is clearly different,
  as can be seen with the unicase-style U. I understand an ID is probably unlikely,
  and this may have been proprietary to the particular artisan/forge/foundry that
  may have done this, but any help would be much appreciated."

    too early to be Albertus, but the style rings similar."
