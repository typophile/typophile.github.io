  body: "Ravel - \r\n\r\nI make my PDFs from Quark. If I have not \"embedded\" the
    font - then it looks screwy.\r\n\r\nIn Illustrator I couldn't find any \"preference\"
    to allow this. So, from my own experiences, I know that if it is a TYPE 3 font,
    or Letterhead's new Open-type Type Font - those will not embed. I've needed Type
    1.\r\n\r\nI suggest you have that PDF open on another computer that does not have
    the fonts you use - and take a look at it. If it is as you designed it, then you
    should be fine for the printer. And if not, please check your fonts for Type 1,
    and if that doesn't work, please look towards Adobe for the answers.\r\n\r\n"

  body: It's just an on-screen rendering problem. As soon as it goes to (a modern)
    RIP it will be trapped automatically. What you could do to make absolutely sure
    that it won't be a problem, you could either mark the black text as overprint
    in Quark's attributes palette. Second alternative is to do it in Illustrator and
    give the black text a thin outline of the same colour and set the outline for
    overprint.

  body: "Select the type that is causing the problem, then look at the attributes
    window (making sure you have the fill box to the front), I suspect that the overprint
    box is not ticked, leave it unticked; if you are concerned there is a trap option
    in pathfinder alternatively add a fine stroke (0.125pt should do it) to the type,
    then tick the stroke as overprint, this will ensure that a mis-registration shouldn\u2019t
    leave a white area around your type. Claus is correct most RIPs will deal with
    the trapping, for peace of mind ask the printer to provide you with a proof, even
    a post-rip pdf, which you can check and sign-off before it goes on press (you
    should do this for every job).\r\nMore on trapping in CS3\r\nhttp://livedocs.adobe.com/en_US/Illustrator/13.0/help.html?content=WS714a382cdf7d304e7e07d0100196cbc5f-6490.html\r\n\r\nTim"

    have you tried printing it out yourself to see how it looks? Even on an inkjet?\r\n\r\nAlso
    check your settings when saving your Illustrator file as a pdf - make sure it's
    press-ready.\r\n\r\nI think you will may readability problems with black on a
    deep red regardless of trapping issues. "

    problem.\r\n\r\nI didn't say font rendering. The Reader will also smooth curves
    (if you don't turn it off in the preferences). This works fine in a color space
    like RGB. But if you use spot colors you will get exactly the results that was
    shown here. Just try the same document without spot colors and the problem will
    be gone. \r\nBut again, these are all screen problems. It has nothing to do with
    trapping or the way this will come out in print.\r\n\r\nRalf\r\n"

    order to get rid off the effect in a screen pdf try ticking overprint, but this

    viewing this with the overprint preview, try viewing with just preview.\r\n\r\nTim"
