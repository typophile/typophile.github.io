  body: Tim, the whole rason that the slab-blackletter challenge was so hard was because
    in most blackletter designs, the pen is held at a 45-degree angle (or somewhere
    around there), while slab serif typically have thick rectangular serifs at 90-degree
    angles, reinforcing baseline, x-height, etc. You're blackletter looks sweet, ahd
    has heavy serifs, but they aren't slab serifs. To make a blackletter a slab serif,
    you have to break it a little bit, so it isn't blackletter anymore.

    on the first Mac. HyperCard probably used the same code (both written by Bill
    Atkinson). Great idea. I should be using BitFonter (which I own) but I used PhotoShop
    so that I would just have a big, white canvas to work on.

  body: "<strong>Jared</strong>, on the Newton? Nope. For the Newton, absolutely.
    Newton fonts are basically TrueType fonts without the outline data. The bitmaps
    are stored in sbit tables, with optional width metrics for printing using a PostScript
    printer's built-in outlines. There are tools which facilitate moving the bitmap
    data back and forth between the formats. Unfortunately, there's no native bitmap
    editor for Newton. Sigh.\r\n\r\n<strong>Dan</strong>, HyperCard was a simple,
    programming tool from Apple that used hyper-linking and a 'stack-of-cards' metaphor.
    I still use it for rapid development of file and text manipulation utilities.
    As Mark mentioned above, it was originally designed by Bill Atkinson, the father
    of MacPaint. The one-bit paint tools are simple, clean and intuitive.\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercard\r\n\r\n<strong>Mark</strong>,
    if you need more real estate (and you feel like popping into Classic) you can
    create a custom HyperCard window that's nearly the size of your screen. Here's
    a screendump of the largest HyperCard window possible displaying on my 22 inch
    Cinema display.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/splorp/94540666/\r\n\r\nI've
    only just started playing with BitFonter (specifically to update the current Newton
    system fonts to include the Euro). I kinda miss using Altsys' Fontastic, actually...\r\n\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/splorp/90881231/"
