  really cool for fellow designers on typophile to share actual printed media. As
  on-screen work often lacks the finer nuances and detail of real printed work I am
  sure a lot of us would rather have the real thing &#40;after all we can&#39;t bring
  our work stations with us to the bathroom&#41; I realize that there is obviously
  issues of trust involved as well as the financial burden of  mailing samples &#40;especially
  to foreign countries&#41; but I for one  would like to share. I would in exchange
  expect the same of other. '
