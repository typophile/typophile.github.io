    is so... yuck...\u201D, but I am hoping to find:\r\n\r\n\u2022 An upright script
    that\u2019s similar to the sample\r\n\r\n\u2022 One that\u2019s not artificially
    \u201Cdistressed\u201D, the sample is low-res and thus somewhat \u201Cantique-y\u201D,
    but the original, from the FDR library, is clean\r\n\r\nI hope someone here has
    more suggestions, thanks."

  body: "This is sort of a hybrid. Part Chancery and part secretary hand. Might want
    to check out all the offerings listed as Civilite, they are not connecting and
    probably more refined than you want. Also Operina would be an alternative. Dont
    think you are going to get what you want but you might make the ballpark : )\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: Typo Upright and Linoscript are fine. But what about Sweet Upright Script
    or Bon Mot? They're quite more 'angular'.

    Frames are much more yuck than Typo Upright. I was too hard on it in retrospect.
