body: Hi all, I&#39;ve just started making fonts for the first time and am having
  a few problems... <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been importing designs from Illustrator as EPS&#39;s.
  All was going well, until I hit the letter &#39;f&#39;. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve done a-e
  and when I tried f and other letters, it doesn&#39;t show them in the table view.  <BR>
  <BR>When I re-open the glyph, it&#39;s not there, but its about half way to the
  edge of the page, moving left. So they are going in, but Fontlab is moving them
  around miles to the left, and not showing them in the matrix/table window... its
  moving the verticle guidelines too, but I can still see the horizontal ones, hence
  why I scrolled around to see if I could find it... <BR> <BR>Hope you can help me
  out, looks like it could be good for my project, but a-e isn&#39;t soo impressive.

  body: I have another question if thats ok. <BR> <BR>I currently have all my glyphs
    in and ready, but the kerning is tight, so they all sight right together, how
    do you go about opening it up a bit? Preferably and automatic system? <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve
    tried the kerning and metrics assistance, but it doesn&#39;t seem to let me do
    anything. <BR> <BR>Thanks again.
