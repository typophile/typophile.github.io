body: "Most - but not all - of what I write stays on-screen, whether in a web page
  or a PDF. Because of this, I tend to favor faces that look particularly crisp on-screen
  but also look reasonably good when printed. Unfortunately, many of my favorites
  for the printed page - particularly Chaparral Pro and Arno Pro - look very disappointing
  on-screen - at least they do in Word 2007 for Windows, with ClearType tuned as much
  as possible. (See the attached image, taken from Word 07, to see what I mean.)\r\n\r\nIt
  seems that there are very few typefaces that can handle this - outside of Cambria
  and Constantia, I'm not able to find much of anything that works really well for
  setting large blocks of text. (Georgia doesn't really work for me in print). \r\n\r\nAny
  suggestions would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nMike"

  body: "ClearType in most Windows apps is limited to TrueType font rendering, i.e.
    it does not apply to PostScript CFF flavour OpenType fonts such as Chaparral Pro
    and Arno Pro.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft's Windows Presentation Format and the new DirectWrite
    apply ClearType to both TTF and CFF fonts, but there are no major apps built for
    these platforms yet."

  body: Ah - that would explain it. As I mentioned, I really like your Constantia
    (you are *that* John Hudson, right?) but alternatives for occasions where something
    different is called for would be nice. Anything you've designed, or that you know
    of, you can recommend? (Aside from Microsoft's 'C' fonts?)

  body: "Congrats mikebara, you've moved your idea of quality screen fonts from the
    bottom of the dung heap to the top of the dung heap. \r\nBut, you should read
    the CT entry in Wikipedia, where it warns you that this technology is not well
    suited for your low resolution screen. \r\n\r\nHave you tried Vista's \"Standard\"
    rendering? This is what MS recommends to those who don't want to, or can't read
    CT. \r\n\r\nCheers!"
