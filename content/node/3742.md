body: Ok, so here&#39;s a random question. Some background first... I&#39;ve been
  doing some OT conversions for a friend who&#39;s done some beautiful work using
  only FontCreator &#40;he must be more patient than i&#41; and i sent him a couple
  versions, including a TTF with OT info. Would he be able to make minor adjustments
  in FontCreator without throwing off the embeded OT instructions? If so what are
  the limits? Any insight would be helpful. thnx again.
