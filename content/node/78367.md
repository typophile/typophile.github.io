body: I'm searching for the perfect serif font to use for the headlines of a Latin
  American news website. Preferably available in OpenType and/or WOFF format. It's
  a bit of a broad query, I know, but I'd love any recommendations from the experts.
  Thank you!

  body: "One of mine: Pratt.\r\nThe Alternate is a slightly finer cut.\r\nTry it out
    at WebINK with reduced linespacing and tighter letterspacing--it's a semi-condensed
    face with a large x-height and short descenders, so that will give you the kind
    of typographic punch that one gets in good print newspapers."
