  for the name of this font or something similar and for the life of me cannot fond
  it anywhere. The guy that created the shirt does no longer work at the company that
  made it so I cannot go there. Any help is appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    a thinner overlay and the two combined as Rick Griffin Contour. The latter yields
    this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/RickGrif_4035.jpg]"
