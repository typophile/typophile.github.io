  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I hadn't realized for months that the <a href="http://typophile.com/forum/1">Critique Forum</a> was alive and well until it was recently pointed out to me. The reason is that there is no post record column to the right of it lie there is for all the other forums in the "Forums" landing page. Is there a reason for this? To me it is helpful to see the most recent post and time to cue me to go check it. I know we are still in Beta and I don't mean to cause a fuss.  I am just asking.

Actually, it would most certainly be better if you were interested in it. But I don't think that anyone should be cajoled into using the forum or anything ;-)

Some of the work that gets posted there is quite good, and worth a look. Like Paul's posts, for instance.

Some of it is not as interesting, but there are lots of threads in General Discussion that I don't follow either, so…

I don't visit the other forums either, except maybe Build or Design occasionally.

General is more interesting.
But not being able to post pictures into the threads is a real drag. The old Typophile was much better because of that.

Now knowing that the Critique site is live, there is no problem for me.  My question is more about why is the Critique area treated differently than Design or General? I just wonder why, when developing a hopefully consistant user interface, one would choose to treat Critique as a child of a lesser God?

		<div class="commentbody">Tina, I've seen your sentiment expressed a few times lately, and while the critique forums could be livelier than they are, I think you're being a bit unfair.

It's easy to chime in on general topics, mostly because we're just spouting off our opinions. It's a lot closer to casual conversation than any formal kind of discourse, and while a lot of information is shared, not a lot of deep thought is required to participate. The type identification forums are as lively as they are because the regular posters have turned it into a competition, which makes it a fun and addictive experience for them.

Providing useful feedback, on the other hand, is hard. I participate in the font critique forums as often as I can, because I always find the experience at least as educational to me as the person I'm critiquing. It's enlightening to puzzle out why I have certain kinds of reactions to certain features in a font. But it still takes time, and given how casual and informal a lot of the participation is on Typophile, it doesn't surprise me that there's not more participation in critiques.

It would be cool if the critique threads were livelier, but I think it's a bit unfair to suggest that the Critique area is dead. Was my feedback on your new typeface not useful to you?</div>

make action in the critique forums more visible. since i don't get email replies any more and the rss feeder only sends the first message of new threads (correct me if i'm wrong) and the new posts don't show up on the main forums page, i rarely think to check to see if anything is new. my new metod of keeping up involves just scanning the forums page to see what sections have had recent posts.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant correctly pointed out that the critique statistics aren't surfacing to the top level index because there are sub categories (sub folders). This is an unfortunate bug.

Image posting and search were the hottest bugs being addressed. Search has been implemented and image posting is very close. Honestly the only aspect that has us from pushing the feature live is the fact that we cannot yet control what happens when people post overly wide images -- currently it would blow out the page widths (column widths) again. So, which peeve is worse, not seeing images in-line or having your column widths blown to full screen? Right then. The only answer is to implement the image posting the right way...

Old versus new. I know some people still miss the old site -- I don't. The reality of the situation is that the system was choking on itself. The database actually stored HTML pages instead of raw content -- a recipe for bloating badly. Consider the fact that when Christian ported the data from the old system to the new he deleted a gigabyte of the "DoNotLookLikeCrap" style tags (and that was just the style tags!).

		<div class="commentbody">That was the housekeeping stuff, so I could get to the good stuff... Driving traffic to the critique.

We've asked our newest moderator Dan Reynolds to help the situation by pointing out the best fonts currently up for critique. He will be able to do this by flagging the best ones too be served up on the home page in the "Handpicked" column.

Something we tried over a year ago was live chat sessions with a live critique. We'd select a font in the critique forum and invite the designer to prepare some additional materials for a Thursday lunchtime live critique session. Then during the designated hour we'd have at it. I know the people who got critiqued really valued it. There was also something cool about it being more of an event, with everybody participating at the same time.

What do you think? Is there any interest in this?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Live crit sounds like a terrific idea. I think that the font in question should be posted a few days ahead of time so commenters  can have a chance to think about it an collect helpful links.  The only other question is timing.  We are a worldwide bunch--when is the "best time" to do it?

Back to image size--is there a way to reject posting an image if it is over the max width you want?  Can there be an error message which says something like "images may not exceed x pixels by x pixels"? After that, a hand come out of the screen and slaps you silly :-)

Fully?

To me at least, definitely the former. I'm a content guy.

BTW, I personally no longer miss the old site. But if you fixed the RSS (I mean for real, so that all posts show up) that would save me a lot of overhead time. The old emailed-posts scheme was a huge benefit.

Does anybody actually go there though?

Great idea, but only if you have a moderator.

A truly live session isn't possible (I'd say "yet" but I'm afraid to make promises). We've looked into chat modules but the real difficulty is finding something that works with people's existing usernames. Aside from something truly live, I would expect the critique would be greatly improved if we simply took the steps of <strong>a)</strong> designating Thursday critique day and <strong>b)</strong> have a moderator (Dan!) alert people to the brightest work up for critique.

Perhaps Dan could add a tag to the critique subject lines similar to the way Yves adds (x) to the Type IDs that are completed. A subject might look like "Magnitude - THURSDAY CRIT". (Then when it's over we can change the subject line back.)</div>

I can't speak for other middle European residents, though But I guess that evenings are OK for anyone without family bounds…

I think that making Thursday "Typophile critique day" is an excellent idea. We could start right away (err… meaning next Thursday, instead of today). What if we selected one work from each category (or there abouts…)?

Another question: do "Logos/Corporate ID Design" and "Typography/Composition" <em>need</em> a crit day? Those zones are quite popular already, but they aren't typeface related, per se. Are we prioritizing, or trying to boost everything equally?

If anyone has any suggestions (including your own work) for crit day, I'm all eyes. Otherwise I'll propably be picking those that catch my attention…</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I already posted this in the 'bug thread', but maybe it's better here. One way to increase the views, and hence posting to critiques would be to reduce the number of categories, and put them in the main list, so that activity would show up on the front page.  

At the bottom of the page you could have a 'critiques' subtitle, and then the following categories: Serif; Sans serif; Script, Bitmap & Blackletter; Logos & Corporate ID; Typography & Composition. Also on the main list Build & Release could be combined, based on the numbers. 

Thus you would have only 5 more lines on the front page, and get indications of activity. Or you could put it as Critique: Serif,
Critique: Sans Serif, etc., and have only four more lines. Thus you would still see everything on the opening screen of the Forums.

Hmmm. I'd much rather see Logos, Composition, etc. bunched together.
They're more peripheral to Typophile, and get too much attention anyway.

maybe these should just be renamed. I know that tiff uses these categories in a way that is loosely based on what they were intended for: build for any technical related problems and release for the leagal end of things. in my book these two aspects are far enough apart to warrant their own sections.</div>

I agree. It's just a question of what compromise works best. Given the number of posts, I think a combined category could accomodate say two or three active 'build' threads and one active 'release' thread, which is what tends to happen. I am also grateful for Tiffany's leadship on the EULA issue. </div>
