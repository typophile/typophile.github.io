  The book will have lots of images and a text in Portuguese and English.\r\nI want
  to learn with the typophiles here what would be the best combination for \"the separation\"
  of text (Portuguese vs English).\r\n1- Color of typeface?\r\n2- Real color of typeface?
  I mean black vs gray?\r\n3- Roman vs Italic? (the text will be set in minion)\r\n4-
  None? Expect that the Portuguese identifies language and the English his...\r\n5-
  Serif vs Sans?\r\nAny good examples that someone care to share I would love to see
  them...\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for all comments.\r\nAnt\xF3nio\r\n\r\n"

    are written in English & German (and often French or another language) to see
    how they do it. Some examples that come to mind are Typographie or anything by
    M\xFCller-Brockmann. You might try poking around <a href=\"http://www.youworkforthem.com/list.php?cat=40\"
    title=\"You Work For Them\">You Work For Them's</a> book collection (with internal
    screen shots) if you can't get access to the books yourself. \r\n\r\nAs far as
    I have seen, simply being in different languages and a bit of spacing tends to
    be enough separation to differentiate different portions, but it depends on the
    project and particular style you are aiming for. \r\n\r\nPersonally, I would make
    both the English and Portuguese versions as clear and legible as possible in their
    own right, but separate from one another and de-marked in some way. How that actually
    applies really depends on the project itself. "

  body: "I am not in the business but it is my feeling that part of the choice may
    depend on practical constraints: for instance, we have bilingual French-English
    publications in canadian planes and trains that are set in a two column format,
    one column for French (usually a sans), the other for English (usually a serif).
    See for instance the <a href=\"http://www.viarail.ca/en/useful-info/onboard-train/via-destinations-magazine/june-2009-july-2009/\">VIA
    destinations Magazine</a>. If you pay attention, you realize that the French side
    has more characters than the English side: on page 59 (for which the characters
    are embedded) I get as much as 14% more characters on the French side (including
    blanks); French just requires more characters. Choosing the same font on both
    sides would have caused problems.  My guess is that choosing a serif and a sans
    somewhat hides the fact that the French side is more cramped than the English
    side. If someone knows of another reason, I'd like to be told.\r\n\r\nMichel\r\n"

  body: "I agree that the application depends on the project itself as well as practical
    constraints. Like Michel said, French for example is usually longer than English,
    so the text arrangement needs to work around this and make it work for the layout
    without either language looking out of place or more important. If one of your
    texts is noteably longer than the other, rather than forcing each to fit in the
    same amount of space, you might try putting them one after the other, for instance,
    and differentiating by a slight colour change (grey/black for instance). \r\n\r\nOn
    the other hand, I also like the idea of not separating at all; I wrote a English-French
    book and both languages are on the same page with the English simply running into
    the French, intriguing the reader as suddenly he doesn't understand anymore or
    vice versa. The point of this though was to reflect the way I speak easily mixing
    both, so it really does depend on the individual project.\r\n\r\n\r\nClaire\r\n\r\nwww.op45.com"

    a bit of spacing tends to be enough separation to differentiate different portions...\r\n\r\n\r\nMichel
    Boyer \r\nThanks for the links. We have the same issue about Portuguese: it needs
    more letters to say the same thing, but I dont know if I like the idea of changing
    for a diferent typeface (sans vs serif). I found very aceptable to have a 2 column
    and one ends first. Visualy I dont dislike...\r\n\r\nnew Op45 \r\nPutting them
    one after the other could work, but the differentiation by a slight colour change
    (your example: grey/black for) could result dificult to read, no?\r\n\r\nThanks

    bilingual everything from cereal boxes to instruction manuals, and generally the
    fonts are the same. (I did see Michael's example ... that is an exception to what
    I find the general rule).\r\n\r\nThere already is something major different about
    the two items ... the language. I would think that is enough for most people."

  body: "Here in Belgium everything is also in two, sometimes three, languages and
    usually the fonts stay the same as Don mentioned. In some books you do often see
    different colours used as I mentioned; done well I think it's readable but obviously
    the colours have to be picked carefully. For instance, if you used two different
    shades of grey and make sure they're both readable, the lighter one could go first
    to make sure it doesn't come across like that language is less important than
    the other.\r\n\r\nI do agree though that the fact that it's two languages is enough
    a differentiation but it can be an interesting element to play around with.\r\n\r\nClaire\r\n\r\nwww.op45.com"

  body: "I have done several bilingual and a couple trilingual books. I agree with
    the people who say the typefaces should be the same, the color the same, etc.\r\n\r\nToo
    often, graphic design seems to fall into the trap \"anything different must be
    signaled by a different graphic treatment.\" But that's not usually true. If the
    difference is apparent to a reader, that is sufficient.  In this case, with a
    two-column treatment, the different languages will be readily apparent as you
    read.\r\n\r\nNow, if you enter the book in a *design* show, as opposed to a *book*
    show, you might get slammed. I have noticed that, depending on the jurors, books
    selected for a design show can be terribly hard to read. "

  body: "IN GENERAL I agree with those who say that type in bi- or multilingual books
    should be set the same face, size, color, etc. But I offer some suggestions.\r\n\r\n**
    \ A book such as the one described by the originator of this thread could very
    well support the two languages being set in different faces and/or in different
    colors. This book seems to be a piece of corporate promotion, not a novel, not
    a philosophy text, not a history monograph. I imagine that \"design\" will have
    a much larger role in such a book than in most instances of books made by publishing
    houses for the general mass of readers. So long as the two languages are set so
    they have equal \"visual weight\" on the page, use of two colors and/or two faces
    (serif and sans) would be fine. If this even-ness in \"weight\" is achieved, I
    do not think there will be any imputation of preference or importance.\r\n\r\n**
    \ There may be instances when one face is used for all languages in which very
    slight size differences may be needed. Ojibwe has very long words and many instances
    of doubled vowels. Within those vowel-heavy words there are relatively few descenders.
    Setting a bilingual Ojibwe/English book, I was not happy with the way page spreads
    were working. I ended up setting one of those two languages larger by .25-point.
    It made all the difference; the languages appeared to be in better balance. I
    am sure not a single reader noticed this. This was some years ago, the files are
    filed away, and I cannot recall which language got the boost in size.\r\n\r\npowers"

    Types for New Faces</em> booklet. Are you thinking of the Joe Auginaush book?
    If so, it looks like the Ojibwe got the boost (although, according to your annotation,
    only .15 pt larger -- 10.65/13 vs. 10.5/13 Legacy Serif).\r\n"
