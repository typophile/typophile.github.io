body: "I plan to do a lot of ligatures in a script. Ligatures like o_r, b_r, t_t_i,
  t_u etc.\r\n\r\nI want them to appear all automatic for the user, cos the font needs
  them really.\r\n\r\nHowever, I can\u2019t seem to figure out which is better; put
  them as \u201Cliga\u201D, or as \u201Ccalt\u201D.\r\n\r\nIt seems like the contetextual
  ligatures are ON by default in InDesign, aswell as the regular ligature-function,
  so for me it feels as if it doesn\u2019t matter really, but perhaps there is (probably)
  advantages in using one of them instead of the other (?).\r\n\r\nWhat are your opinions
  on this?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

  body: "'calt' is intended for contextual stuff, whereas your examples seem to be
    plain ligatures. If you really consider them to be <cite>necessary</cite> ligatures,
    then they belong into 'liga'. If you want to give the user more control, you can
    put them into 'dlig' (discretionary ligatures) which is intended to be applied
    on individual glyphs rather than paragraphs.\r\n"

    you should know. I\u2019ve also found your files from you webpages excellent guides.\r\n\r\nBut...
    hmm... What exactly does the contextual stuff mean, in practice? I\u2019m not
    quite sure I do understand it completely."

  body: "Contextual rules govern instances in which particular glyphs should or should
    not appear together. \r\n\r\nTo take a simple case: In a script face, one form
    of a glyph might have no connecting strokes, to be used at the beginning or end
    of a word, while another form would be applied in the middle of a word.\r\n\r\nIt
    can get more sophisticated than that of course.\r\n\r\nExamples of fonts with
    contextual feature include Shinn's Handsome Pro, and Abode's Caflisch Script."

  body: "I don't think it matters for a script whether you use one default OT feature
    or another. In practice, there's no difference.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are certain
    script substitutions you may want to include in your font that are not, strictly
    speaking, ligatures, such as end forms.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/end_4146.jpg]\r\n\r\nTypographers
    are a punctilious bunch; I therefore put all the substitutions in Handsome Pro
    in the calt feature (except, for sentimental reasons, fi and fl). I suppose I
    could have split them between calt and liga (or dlig), to be absolutely correct,
    but why make things unecessarily complex? The real use for the distinctions between
    calt, dlig, and liga is in old style roman faces, not scripts."
