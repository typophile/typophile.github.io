body: i'm at a loss... how large should i make the [[ornaments]]? should they be [[baseline]]
  to ascender height? should they fill the [[em square]]? should i make them oversized
  so that they are equal to 120% of the em square? Some of them are supposed to be
  used to build borders & patterns. That's why i think 120% may be right as that seems
  to be the default leading in Adobe Apps & Microsoft Apps as well (but i'm not totally
  sure about that). Does anyone have any experience with this kind of thing and can
  offer advice? thnx for looking.

  body: "I think a border elements should be designed to \"set solid\". i.e., a 12
    pt. border with 12 pt. leading should align correctly. It's much easier than setting
    12 pt. on 14.4, or 11 pt. on 13.2.\r\n\r\nWord and the like can be set to exact
    line spacing, and borders are more likely to be used in a DTP app, where people
    are less likely to use default percentage based leading. \r\n\r\nYou _will_ provide
    all the rotations necessary to make a simple box, won't you? Some fonts require
    the user to rotate elements, while the font's EULA forbids the user from modifications...argh!
    And, please, don't rely on kerning for horizontal positioning!\r\n\r\nOther ornaments,
    leaves and the like, just have to \"look good\" when set in a line with text.
    Of course, what \"looks good\" beside a uc A will look too high beside a lc a,
    or a smallcap A. I suppose one could make use of \"case forms\" in OpenType to
    help with that. "

    Village ornaments contains two different solutions to borders that'd be hard to
    explain but easy to see...
