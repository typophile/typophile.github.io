If you look up most any typographic topic in Wikipedia -- say, letterspacing

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracking_%28typography%29

or

justification (typographic)  

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justification_%28typesetting%29

you find so many errors as to want to cry, shout, whatever your favorite form of expressing frustration.

It's beyond my energy, and competence, to fix everything, but we should try.

Nick Shinn? John Hudson? Etc.? Others who who know the history & how technical word usage has changed over time.

For example, the claim that:

<cite>Kerning adjusts the letters closer together (negative spacing), tracking adjusts the letters further apart (positive spacing).</cite>

ignores the history & development of the use of this technical term. Originally, with both foundry type and Monotype, kerning was always a removal of space  between letterpairs. -- a saw with foundry type, and casting a kern with Monotype (& probably could have foundry-cast type with a kern, don't know if this was ever done).

The point is that the original notion of kerning always being a negative space was simply a technical issue,  hunks of metal were involved. You could add space, but that was a different technique.Can't do it with a saw. And in no case (save perhaps Monotype?) would you apply positive space to a whole paragraph, just too damn much work.

As photocomp made inroads, letters were no longer hunks of metal, and the same system that provided for removing space between pairs of letters could be used to add space. "Postive kerning" ceased to be an oxymoron.

And on & on.

If Wikipedia is to be fixed, it's going to take a bunch of us. Not interjecting our personal aesthetic, just accurate, fairly complete description.

In the "talk" page on justification, Wiklipedia says

<cite>This article has been rated as High-importance on the importance scale.</cite>

and my first comment is

<cite>This article is full of inaccuracies</cite> 

Anyone want to help?</div>

   <div class="comment card m-3">
	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">Actually a "kern" originally meant part of the face of a metal sort that extends beyond the edge, like the beak of an "f"; by extension "kerning" could mean filing down the side of a letter to allow a tighter fit (while allowing/increasing a kern).

		<div class="commentbody">TP: - Nicely done! From a position of ignorance, I wondered why you said that metal type could only be negatively kerned. Wasn't it possible to spread two letters apart? In fact, unless the individual characters were physically altered (by removing parts) they could NOT be kerned by moving them closer together. Granted, that was the only meaning of the term at the time. I'd suggest saying it something like this: 

"In its original meaning as defined for metal type, a kern could only bring letters closer together (negative spacing my modifying characters such as A and V so they weren't rectangular), though today it can go in either direction. Tracking can similarly go in either direction, though with metal type one could only adjust the letters further apart (positive spacing)."

I wouldn't deign to make such a change myself, because I really don't know whether I'm right or not.

		<div class="commentbody">Thomas, one small quibble, and it's probably not for Wikipedia. 

You corrected the Wikipedia copy to <cite>Although digital type sets tighter on average than metal type...</cite>

All your changes were for the better, I think,  but I'd at least qualify this one. The overall wordspacing with computer comp (esp. PostScript > OpenType) is probably tighter then with metal, but the letterfit with metal was often tighter. You are of course quite right that letterfit is a function of type design.

With both Monotype and foundry metal, the presence of kerns on some letters meant that type would touch, though not overlap. And that meant editors -- those who mark proofs -- when looking at metal, were comfortable with "touching" letters. When photocomp came along, "not touching" became the new standard for text settings. For fun, just look at some Penguin books during Tschichold's and Schmoller's tenure. 

As for Linotype -- Over the past week, I've been re-reading a couple Nero Wolfe novels.

The first, <cite>The Mother Hunt,</cite> (1963) was obviously printed letterpress, and just as obvious, printed from stereo plates. Too many copies printed for it to have been printed from the cast type.

The second book, <cite>The Doorbell Rang</cite>, (1965) is set in the same typeface. My copy is a first printing, first edition. While it is set from the same metal type, I'm 99.44% sure repro was pulled and the book printed offset. It has that look, and an (almost) 21.66 pica measure offers another clue.

Here's the point. These were set Linotype, not Monotype. Ignoring the problems of certain characters with the linecaster, the letterfit is tighter than we usually see today, esp. with the book where repro was pulled, where the ink spread is a bit greater.

The common "not touching" requirement that came in with photocomp, even with kerning regularly applied, often results in a bit looser letterfit.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Charles,

I'm sure it could be wordsmithed and further improved: feel free to do so! It’s Wikipedia, that is how it is supposed to work. I was trying to balance being succinct and being accurate, but I think you are correct that it can be made better. Please do!  :)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thomas, I think what you've done is great. The comments I added here are for Typophiles, not a general audience. Too much reliance on, what, "unspoken industry practices"?

Maybe it could be wordsmithed better, but as I so often give evidence, not by me. However, since you've done some good work, I'll take the inspiration to heart & try to improve anything in Wikipedia I can (maybe) make clearer.</div>

Wikipedia is far from perfect. But in general, in most articles/areas, it tends to  improve over time.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">OK, Thomas. I've just begun on "Justification." 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justification_%28typesetting%29

Only down to

"People with dyslexia..."

Going to have to look up the Adobe patent on paragraph optimization, because the routines of TeX are attributed to InDesign, which is sadly wrong...

Anyone else going to help? The whole damn thing is from the point of view of a LaTex user who is an author, not a typesetter, type designer, etc.

& I don't know any system or fonts that use Zapf's alternate glyphs, anyone? </div>
