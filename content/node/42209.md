  body: "I suppose this is the sequel to <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/41936\">this</a>.\r\nIMO,
    this is too pictorial, i.e. too little typographic. You pictured a tank. Of course,
    a tank <em>is </em> heavy \u2013 however the overall image doesn\u2019t communicate
    the abstract idea of \u2018heavy\u2019 but rather \u2018tank\u2019."
