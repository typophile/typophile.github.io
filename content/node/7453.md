body: If you would like to be involved in the planning of TypeCon2005, please let
  me know. <BR> <BR>TypeCon2005 will be held July 20-24, 2005, at the wonderful Parsons
  School of Design in New York. SOTA&#39;s sixth annual conference is presented with
  the Type Directors Club, with assistance from the American Printing History Association
  and other fine groups TBA. <BR> <BR>We need people to get involved on many different
  levels. This is your chance to make this the best TypeCon ever! <BR> <BR>We are
  scheduling planning meetings to be held in NYC in the next couple of months, and
  will also work via email and in the discussion forum provided by our friends here
  at Typophile. Send an email or respond here if you&#39;d like to volunteer. <BR>
  <BR>While much of the work will be carried out by local crew, you can be involved
  in TypeCon even if you&#39;re not in the NYC area. Just let us know that you&#39;d
  like to help, and we&#39;ll put your brainpower and time to good use. <BR> <BR>Looking
  forward to working with another dedicated group of type-lovin&#39; folks, and another
  great event.

  body: I&#39;d love to help out Tamye. I&#39;m a new typophile member and anxious
    to attend the 2005 event. I am living a little far from you though - up in Ottawa,
    Canada. Still, let me know if I can help in any way. I&#39;m always happy to contribute
    brainpower! <BR> <BR>Andrea
