body: 'Hello people of type. I am doing research on experimental typography for a
  class and haven''t had luck finding good textbooks or papers if any on this topic.
  Has any of you come across on this topic in books or essays? Could you share your  sources?
  I''m particularly looking for material on experimental typography in book design.
  An example of this is [[http://www.nd.edu/~stomasul/VAS_homepage.html|VAS: An Opera
  in Flatland]]. Thank you for your help!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'

    of course, Ray Gun.\r\n\r\nAnd there's a book on the subject from maybe the 70s,
    which I can picture but can't track down. I'll work on that one.\r\n\r\nTake a
    look at Marinetti. \"Zang Tumb Tumb\" etc.\r\n\r\nAlso, what time period are we
    looking at? Yesterday's experimental is today's trope."

    start by defining what experimental means.\r\n\r\n(And if you do so in this thread,
    it will help us all pinpoint more specifically relevant material.)"

  body: Well, for me experimental in this case means something which is not practical
    and accepted by the majority. Things which are created through experiments in
    order for introducing new ways of seeing and interpreting old views. Please feel
    free to correct me or add your views on experimental. THANK YOU!

  body: "If you're picky, \"experimental\" might better be used to mean something
    where the results are subjected to testing to ascertain their merit (something
    few graphic designers would ever consider). The preferable term here might be
    \"speculative\".\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: I haven't looked at Frank Adebiaye's site in a while, but he is into experimenting,
    as I recall, and I think he has written something about it. Could be shorts in
    my memory, though.
