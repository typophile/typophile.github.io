body: "Hi all.\r\nI've kerned all 56 characters through Fontographer 5 via the manual
  kerning pair window. It took a bit but I'm satisfied with the result.\r\nI'm moving
  on to glyphs with diacritics and realize I don't want to kern the lowercase /a/
  7 times (for each existing pair). I know classes resolve this time issue. How can
  I access that from Fontographer 5 or from some set .fea file code (\"where a then
  a\" for all diacritically marked /a/).\r\nDoes this question make sense? I hope
  I've worded it well enough.\r\nThanks in advance (for saving me hours)."

  body: "You can use Kerning Assistance to help with that. It lets you create groups
    of characters that have similar left and/or right sides, and then lets you apply
    the same kerning values to all of them. It's been a while since I've used it,
    so I don't remember the details. It's all explained in the manual.\r\n\r\nIncidentally,
    when you say you \"kerned all 56 characters\" it kind of makes me think that you
    used kerning to do the basic spacing in your font. The font should be reasonably
    spaced with no kerning pairs at all, just by adjusting the space on the sides
    (called the sidebearings) of each character. Kerning is for exceptions to the
    normal spacing, problematic pairs such as AT or LW, where your standard sidebearings
    are not adequate to get reasonable spacing. If you try to space your font primarily
    with kerning, you're going to create a hell of a lot of work for yourself, create
    a huge kerning table (possibly too big to function properly) and the font will
    be useless in programs that don't support kerning. If I guessed wrong about what
    you've done, then never mind and I apologize for bringing it up. However, if that
    <em>is</em> what you've done, then you should reset your kerning and space the
    font properly before doing the kerning."

  body: "Fontographer's Metrics Assistance and Kerning Assistance are similar in concept
    to the metrics and kerning classes in FontLab Studio. Since there are differences,
    the class kerning in FLS and the assistance values in FOG do not convert between
    each other (if you use VFB files to exchange the data), and the upcoming version
    of Fontographer (5.1) will also not change this functionality. But a future version
    of FOG may incorporate this. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam\r\n"

  body: "Mark,\r\n(Unfortunately,) I think you are kind of right. I went through the
    user manuel (thanks Adam) and found what I was looking for. I might reset the
    kerning, tighten the sidebearings and play with the \"auto kern\" feature or just
    fix the little issues like you mentioned: AT, LW, Wa, etc.\r\nThe typeface I'm
    creating is a lightweight face and needs a bit more room to breath anyway.\r\nThanks
    for the answers gentlemen, I really appreciate it.\r\nI'll report back if I run
    into anything else."
