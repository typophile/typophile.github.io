body: "That was the roughly (not verbatim) the topic of my thesis. I wanted to explore
  the connection between the information designer and the audience, how the information
  is presented by the designer, how it is perceived by the audience, and who is responsible
  when the information is misunderstood. That was the written part. For the visual
  part, I selected a college campus (my old undergraduate university) and redesigned
  their map and wayfinding/signage system.\r\n\r\nI decided to pick it up last night
  and reread it, almost 2 years later. Afterwards, I began to realize that despite
  my thesis committee kicking my butt with a plethora of revisions and pushing me
  to make this a great finishing stroke on my graduate school career, I only scratched
  the surface and maybe went a bit under. What I want to do is revisit my written
  part of the project in more depth as well as my visual part of the project. For
  my resources (and like a complete dolt I left my thesis at home and now I'm in a
  coffee shop doing a bit of research) I used Tufte, Ferdinand De Sassure, DAvid Crow,
  Saul Wurner, Nathan Shedroff, Josef Albers, multiple essays on information design
  from various authors in the last 200 years or so, explored semiotics, cognitive
  thinking, etc. There are a few others that I'm simply forgetting to mention.\r\n\r\nAny
  suggestions on additional resources that I could use to expand on my thesis?"

  body: I wonder if the information design used in planning the Iraq War is available
    to researchers? Not thinking about aircraft carrier banners or UN PowerPoints,
    but the information design used in planning the war. It would be interesting if
    blame could be assigned to designers rather than the generals.

    State Department, all of it dismissed with contempt by Rumsfeld, who thought he
    knew so much better he didn't need to consult anyone. And our clueless President
    went along, as he is so impressed by arrogance. Unfortunately Rumsfeld's ideas
    were incredibly stupid, and the consequences of the resulting terrible decisions
    were devastating for Iraq, the US, and the world. This is all brilliantly documented
    in [[http://www.noendinsightmovie.com/|No End in Sight]], which has just come
    out out on DVD. \r\n\r\nThe disaster of information design that led to all of
    it was the infamous butterfly ballot of Florida in 2000, which tilted the results
    against Gore enough for the deadlock, and the Supreme Court giving it to Bush. "

    a political point, just that graphic designers and information designers are often
    blamed less (quite rightly in my opinion) than the people who hire them when things
    go wrong. \r\n\r\nAnother case being the recent baby crib recalls where in some
    cases bad instructions contributed to the problem. Easier to blame \u201Cthe Chinese\u201D

    the story here is somewhat different. \r\n\r\nAccording to [[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2004/09/02/MNGTK8I8IE1.DTL|this
    report]] the ballot was not designed by a professional graphic designer or information
    designer, but by the election official. And she had already done the same mess-up
    four years earlier according to [[http://www.asktog.com/columns/042ButterflyBallot.html|this
    account]], though the errors were not consequential in that case.\r\n\r\nSo the
    story is that an official thought information design is so obvious or unimportant
    that there was no need to hire a designer, even after a mess up. \r\n\r\nWhat
    the story shows, I think, is that much of the public doesn't understand or value
    graphic design or information design--but in fact good and bad design can change
    the fate of nations, and has. "

  body: "To return to the question at hand: someone has finally broached a topic (semiotics)
    on which I can speak with a degree of confidence. \r\n\r\nA lot depends on the
    model of communication one begins with. If you suppose that \"meaning\" is something
    that a writer/designer <em>puts into</em> their work, then when the communication
    fails, the writer/designer can (and often does) blame readers for the lapse. That's
    the predominant approach in the circles with which I'm acquainted; it provides
    fuel for many of the furies in humanities departments, and it undergirds many
    conflicts over interpretation in more casual settings.\r\n\r\nYou might also think
    of \"meaning\" as the stakes of a venture, a wager, whereby the writer/designer
    proffers a certain expression (in words and images). If careful composition, astute
    knowledge of the audience, and general luck favor the writer/designer, the communication
    succeeds. If the writer/designer hasn't done their homework, or if some unforeseeable
    circumstance confuses the audience, the communication fails. This model doesn't
    depend on the myth of subsistent meaning (the notion that \"meaning\" soehow inhabits
    words and images apart from somebody actively apprehending meaning), and keeps
    the onus for success on the communicator -- though even the most careful articulate,
    precise communicator sometimes doesn't succeed.\r\n\r\n(Singluar \"they\" deliberate;
    kindly leash the dogs of grammar enforcement.)"

    A point they make is that communication through language (or symbols) is a triangular
    operation, involving a referrer, a referrent and a referee: that is, some<strong>one</strong>
    is thinking of some<strong>thing</strong> and wishes to convey that thought to
    some<strong>one else</strong>. With language, metaphor (or simile) is the tool
    most often used to perform this process, and I would venture to say that "Information
    Design" depends to a large extent on visual metaphors. How successful either process
    is depends largely on the strength--that is, lack of ambiguity--of the metaphor.'
