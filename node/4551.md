  that gathers and  <BR>channels information about new technologies and techniques
  to their  <BR>affiliated electricians. <BR> <BR>I started with the typography &#40;the
  fun part&#41; as the rhythm of the name  <BR>was very inviting &#40;I&#39;ll be
  adding an image or symbol to it later on}. <BR>One of the versions is a customized
  typeface, and I have three levels  <BR>of customization. I think I know which one
  to use, but am curious what  <BR>you guys think of it. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/34772.gif"

  body: Well the typeface is ChollaSlabBold. ;&#41; <BR> <BR>There&#39;s something
    nice about the idea of &#34;melding&#34;, &#34;joining&#34; and &#34;fusing&#34;
    in regards to electricians. And the fact that they &#34;channel&#34; the information
    is along similar lines. Electrician weld and solder. When we pass or share information
    we become joined together. I can see this happening in your ligs. Maybe it would
    be a little too tricky &#40;?&#41; but I would be curious if you could &#34;solder&#34;
    all the letter together.

  body: Well... the concept is interesting. The idea of &#34;gathering&#34; is suggested
    by the ligatures - that&#39;s nice. Personally I would reduce the distance between
    the letters, to keep the word more compact and the ligatures not so exaggerated.
    <BR> <BR>I would apply this suggestion to the 1st variant. <BR> <BR>Kobe.

  body: I am enjoyng the 1st logo design. Perhaps joining most of the ligatures. All
    except the &#34;O&#34;.  <BR> <BR>Because of the weight caused by the joins, the
    C, N, O and L would look best closer as suggested by Florian. <BR> <BR>The idea
    of flow through the logo would be of great benefit. <BR> <BR>take care <BR> <BR>

  body: Ligate the topmost &#40;left&#41; serif on the N with a reverse taper to the
    C. Extend the serifs on the bottom of the N and the top of the L to &#39;frame&#39;
    the O. Perhaps tighten up a bit, but not much

  body: Kewl, interesting suggestions. My idea was to go with  <BR>the top design
    too. I&#39;ll tighten up the whole thing and  <BR>see what it looks like. <BR>
    <BR><i>&#62; Ligate the topmost &#40;left&#41; serif on the N with a reverse  <BR>taper
    to the C.</i> <BR>Heh, we&#39;ve got a mindreader in our midst. I felt like  <BR>doing
    that but hesitated because I feared it would harm  <BR>the readability of the
    word. I think I will have a go at it. <BR> <BR><i>&#62; I love ligation, but you
    might have a problem with  <BR>that &#34;no&#34; standing out - negative vibes.</i>
    <BR>It&#39;s a bitch innit? That&#39;s why I started out with extending  <BR>the
    tail on the &#34;n&#34;, not only to achieve a symmetrical flip  <BR>effect but
    also to counter that problem. Maybe connecting  <BR>the &#34;c&#34; with the &#34;n&#34;
    might de-emphasize that. Also keep in  <BR>mind this is for a non-English speaking
    target audience. <BR> <BR><i>&#62; This is pretty strong stand alone type

    <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s the tightened logo, but the &#34;cn&#34; ligature is causing

    lower&#41;, or have the serif slab but lower than the arch of the n. I don&#39;t
    know if either will work, but you might be able to discover a lighter link for
    the cn ligature by starting along these lines. '

  body: Of the last three you posted I like the friggin&#39; first iteration. That
    &#34;c-n&#34; lig seems to maintain the character of the logotype the best. The
    second iteration creates too long of a horizontal on the top edge of the lig,
    and the third iteration just doesn&#39;t make the cut. IMO. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott

  body: I like the standalone, and I agree with Scott that the first one is best.
    Maybe alter &#40;sharpen, round?&#41; the lower terminal on the C to play nicely
    with the ligature on top.

    they melded somehow?

  body: Almost there. I wanna thank everyone for their insights, as this  <BR>has
    helped me get the job done in about half the time &#40;usually  <BR>I let each
    intermediary stage of a logo rest for a while to be able  <BR>to evaluate it with
    a fresh eye&#41;. <BR> <BR>I slightly narrowed the &#34;e&#34;s and tightened
    up the &#34;cn&#34; ligature.  <BR>Last thing to decide on is which stand-alone
    sign to present to  <BR>the client &#40;I&#39;ll save the other three as a back-up
    in case said  <BR>client is not completely satisfied&#41;. Nr. 2 is a quite literal
    lift from  <BR>the word mark, nrs. 1 and 3 are &#34;melded&#34; as per Tiff&#39;s
    suggestion  <BR>and nr. 4 is the most instantly recognizable. Whaddayathink? <BR>

  body: Option 1 &amp; 3 remind me of the logotype. Option 2 doesn&#39;t seem finessed
    or finished enough to be paired with the logotype. Option 4 is a little too typographic,
    but I&#39;ll admit this could be because all I see is an apostrophe.  <BR> <BR>:D
