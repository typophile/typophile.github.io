  <BR> <BR>I put my faces in order of named releases. <BR>But the quizmasters mixed
  theirs up, determining some by date of typeface design &#40;eg Bell&#41;, and others
  by date of typeface name &#40;Interstate&#41;. Leaving aside Helvetica for now...

  body: Nick, <BR> <BR>You raise a very good point! My quiz sheet is a scribbly mess,
    the epicenter of which lies on that very question. With regard to Bell, I first
    dated my answer to that of John Bell&#39;s specimens; then I recalled, just as
    you have written, that &#34;Bell&#34; wasn&#39;t released by that name until 1930
    by Monotype, and so I changed my answer. In a moment of blind panic combined with
    nightmarish PSAT recall &#40;&#34;your first answer is usually the right one&#34;
    -- whatever the hell that means&#41;, I changed my answer back. <BR> <BR>That
    question was indeed make-or-break, and I just happened to get fairly lucky.  <BR>

  body: With regards to the ordering of fonts, the stated rules were that one was
    supposed to use the date of the original design, not the revival. Of course, on
    that basis the quizmasters goofed in marking Interstate as 1993. As Nick says,
    they were inconsistent. But they did say how it was supposed to work. &#40;Of
    course, it was a pretty noisy environment, so it&#39;s not a shock that Nick didn&#39;t
    hear this rule being explained.&#41; <BR> <BR>I &#42;think&#42; I would have gotten
    three more points had this question been marked correctly. But that would only
    have tied me with Kent for second, and who knows how many other folks would also
    have gotten more points.... <BR> <BR>Oh well! I think this just goes to show that
    we shouldn&#39;t take it too seriously. <BR> <BR>Oh yeah, there &#42;were&#42;
    a bunch of repeat questions from previous years&#39; quizzes. I was particularly

  body: On that ordering of fonts question, I got some mixed advice. I was going to
    put Clarendon in the fifties, but someone told me that everyone was saying they
    meant the original Clarendons. Seemed plausible, so I changed it and got it &#34;right.&#34;
    I still think fifies is right for the same reason as Nick said. <BR> <BR>Then
    the same guy told me that Times pre-dated Futura. I was pretty sure it was the
    other way around, but he was adamant, so I changed it and got it wrong. I guess
    the judges hadn&#39;t heard this theory either.

    I don&#39;t believe that&#39;s true. I believe the very first of the Clarendons
    was indeed known as &#34;Clarendon&#34;; in fact, wasn&#39;t Clarendon the first
    type face to get some sort of legal protection in the UK? Thorne or Thorowgood
    or Besley -- I don&#39;t have my sources with me. <BR> <BR>I tend to agree with
    you about Bell -- it wasn&#39;t really &#34;Bell&#34; until Stanley got ahold
    of it.  <BR> <BR>IMHO, any score in the 30s was very respectable. Jon totally
    blew me away with his 43. Major props. <BR> <BR><i>&#62;What happened to Kent?</i>
    <BR> <BR>Last year, I established the [perhaps unfortunate] precedent that the
    winner of the previous year helps Allan with the next quiz.  <BR> <BR>This year,
    I decided to establish the precedent that once you&#39;ve won, you&#39;re disqualified
    from future contests. &#40;I mean, who wants the same group of nerds winning over
    and over? And besides, how many ITC collections, or whatever, does a person need?&#41;
