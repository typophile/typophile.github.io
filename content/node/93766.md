  paper about typography in fashion magazines for my type design class.\r\nI have
  a 2007 eye magazine article and an interview to the creative director of Harpers
  Bazaar, but I'd like to read more of this topic before I start writing. \r\nDoes
  anyone know any others articles-essay-anything topic related?\r\n\r\nAny observation
  is welcome."

    bazaar) and season-issued magazines (the gentlewoman, fantastic man, acne paper,
    self service, metal, wad, the last magazine)\r\n\r\nty \r\n\r\n"
