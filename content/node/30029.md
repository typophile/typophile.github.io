  some good type. The library here is limited, so throw our suggestions this way if
  you have any.\r\n\r\nTIA\r\n"

    + Relato Sans</a>\r\n\r\nHowever, i'm sure it would be more helpful to hear how
    you are going to use the type. Check the <a href=\"design_readme\">Design Forum
    Read Me</a> for ideas of what types of information might be useful in helping
    us to make suggestions."

  body: "Just a though: when I was a teen (not that many years ago) any attempt by
    anti-drug / sexual health / eat your veggies groups to be cool was decidedly un-cool.
    I think that appealing to the older end of your spectrum (at least design-wise)
    would be a good idea, since teens are always trying to act older than they are.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    teens are very cliquey - the hip hop kids don't associate with the emo kids. Depending
    on what group you want to target, the design aesthetic will change. My suggestion
    is to look at popular album covers and try to replicate the look of Snoop Dogg
    or whomever the kids are listening to these days.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: Paul, It will most prominently be used to establish a word mark and then used
    for titles on posters and other material. It won't be used for body copy, if that
    helps.

    Let's use Hot Pink on Black and use a really Xtreme typeface! Then we can get
    a Longhaar wearing lipstick to pitch for us. The kids will dig it.\"\r\n\r\n<strong>Circa
    1995:</strong>\r\n\"Well, kids these days like the band Nirvana. Let's use a really
    Grungey typeface and get a depressed looking Longhaar wearing flannel to pitch

    kids these days like that Snoopy Dog rap guy. Let's use a graffiti typeface and
    get a really menacing looking black man to pitch for us. The kids will dig it!\"\r\n\r\nLesson?
    \r\n\r\nDON'T BASE YOUR DESIGN ON CURRENT FADS IN POPULAR MUSIC. \r\n(Sorry Lex...)\r\n\r\nIf
    your message is serious, then make the design appropriately. The last thing we
    need to see more of is an AIDS ad with graffiti and a menacing looking black man
    saying that we should practice safe sex just because someone thinks that Snoop
    Dogg is cool. \r\n\r\nChoose typefaces and and designs that clearly communicate
    YOUR message, not someone else's. \r\n\r\n"

    something that looks like it was churned out by a grownup trying to look cool.
    You'll be much better off to come up with a strong concept that appeals to teens
    and then pick fonts that work with the concept. I think that's why the \u201DTruth\u201D
    anti-tobacco ads work so well; they don't at all resemble most advertising that
    targets teens."

    list.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think some of the 'trendier' campaigns are not really concerned
    with longevity, they just want something that appeals 'this year'. My favourite
    is the new (RED) campaign for AIDS, aside from that I have to agree that everything
    else is pretty played. \r\n\r\nThe demographics don't lend well to using scripts,
    as part of it won't even appear in standard English alphabet languages. "
