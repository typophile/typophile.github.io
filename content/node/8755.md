  the plot involves a traveling medicine show, and I want to base the design on that...posters
  or fliers that they would use to get people to come to the show...anybody have any
  resources for that type of thing? I&#39;ll probably use the Woodcut typeface with
  some woodtype ornaments..thanks!

  body: For the typefaces, post a request on the Type Idenification Board. There was
    a request recently that could steer you in the direction you&#39;re looking to
    go. As for finding the posters I think a google search would be your best bet.

    &#34;American Memory&#34; website, which can be found &#60;a href=&#34;<a href="http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amtitle.html"

    Every time I visit, I get sucked in for awhile, but I&#39;m usually able to find
    excellent images to guide me when I&#39;m trying to reconstruct something from
    the past.
