    (AKA Andrew Leman) and is available on the linked page. It is NOT  included in

    The Font Company, which might still be found. It doesn't seem to be among the
    Font Company fonts taken over and renamed by URW++.\r\n\r\n Brendel/B&P/Softmaker
    sold copies of this font, with many additional weights and variations.\r\n\r\n
