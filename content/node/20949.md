body: "Hi there. \r\n\r\nI am not sure if something like this has been posted before,
  I dont think so so here goes.\r\n\r\nI have been working as a graphic designer for
  around 7 years now and although the job I have is secure and brings in some good
  clients, due to the size of the company and the clients it has the creative part
  can be very frustrating. To cut a long story short, which I am sure many of you
  are aware of, projects can easily become more about the politics and strategic grounding
  behind a project which can sometimes lead to the creative part becomming less important.
  \r\n\r\nI am now thinking of trying to set up something of my own and although I
  know what this entails and what hard work, but worth while work it can be there
  is one thing that I am a little unsure of. \r\n\r\nI have always been employed by
  someone and although I have done many freelance projects along the way, most of
  my work has been done whilst employed.\r\n\r\nMy question is, is when I create my
  folio for my future company is it ok to use the work I have done whilst employed,
  as long as I credit it to the company I was with at the time. \r\n\r\nHas anyone
  else been in this situation in the past whilst setting their own company up and
  if so how did you go about it?\r\n\r\nMatt"

    you place your role in the work in context. So yeah; it sounds like no problem
    to me.

    to check the small-print or have a lawyer look it over. If you're competing directly
    against your old employer they might decide to make life difficult for you if
    they are so inclined.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I agree that it is perfectly fair to show work you've done while employed,
    as long as you're clear what your role was in the project (i.e. not taking creative
    credit for someone else's work) and who the client was.

  body: "I work for both my own clients and as a subcontractor for advertising agencies.
    If I have a meeting with a potential client I show in addition of work for my
    own clients, some of the subcontracted work (unless forbidden, like with medical
    companies), and always state both my client and their client and what my part
    in the project was. I also try to avoid any conflict with my agency clients, i.e.
    I won't steal their customers.\r\n\r\nIf you were to look for a new job, you would
    show work you've done whilst working for your current employer. I don't think
    setting up your own company is much different a situation."

    is still very beta). I had to work around this at every turn because I've been
    stuck under one client for sooo long. It took me a long time to work it out, and
    I had to be very careful with the language and presentation.\r\n\r\nI started
    a thread, just like you have done. Had some help from Norbert, and some unexpected
    scepticism as well (see the thread).\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/13993\r\n\r\nThat
    was almost as humiliating as being referred to as an <cite>artiste</cite> by Hrant.\r\nlol"

    under lock and key. Meaning it's safe to show publically without ruining any marketing
    plans or strategies.\r\n\r\nWith that said, you should be okay to use work you've
    produced even if it's from another company you worked for. So long as you provide
    credits to the company and the creative/art director, you should probably be safe.\r\n\r\nLike
    others have said, oftentimes it's a good idea to consult a lawyer about these
    things.\r\n\r\n+\r\nRyan Ford"

  body: I would suggest asking the company for who you did the work. I know one company
    I worked for does not allow me to show any work in my portfolio. Lame? Yes! But,
    they from what I understand, it is within their rights to do so.

  body: "Thanks for all these comments, it seems like a general feeling that its mostly
    about crediting the work to the right people and making sure you dont take credit
    for something you havnt done. \r\n\r\nI guess once you get a few clients and a
    complete a few jobs then these could probably replace the work you have done whilst
    at another company. I guess it is always useful to have these projects in the
    folio as it shows the clients where you have come from and the experience you
    have gained. \r\n\r\nI think talking to someone like a lawyer could be a good
    idea, just to be on the safe side.\r\n\r\nThnks for all the advice guys. \r\n"

  body: "It really depends on the company, the clients, the nature of the work. I'm
    in book publishing and it's totally ok to take credit for books designed - in
    fact the books carry a credit. But I know that isn't the case with other types
    of clients.\r\n\r\nGood luck with your own business. Striking out on my own was
    the best decision I've ever made for myself but I gotta warn you, while you may
    not have to deal with interoffice powerplays and politics you get a whole other
    set of issues and you have to make nicey nice to a lot of people you wish you
    could tell to eat s**t. Unless you hire an assistant for that..."
