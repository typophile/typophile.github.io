body: 'Dear all, <BR> <BR>I have been asked to provide some input for a friends independent
  fashion boutique. The challenge is to aid in the development of an online presence
  and also for a variety of planned print materials. The current font choices for
  the two shop names don&#39;t really work as well as they probably should &#40;and
  I&#39;ve never been a fan of Copperplate Gothic - for some reason it was popular
  as a display font when I was completing my architecture studies - and that was the
  mid 1990s!&#41;. The loose brief is below: <BR> <BR>&#34;Illustration with improved
  fonts listing only shop names and a heading somewhere that says: <BR>&#39;Contemporary
  jewellery, clothing and objects - Australian made and designed.&#39;&#34; <BR> <BR>
  <BR> <BR>The overall feel as described by the client/owner is: <BR> <BR>&#34;Inspiration
  for site: a jungle and garden with a touch of Alice in Wonderland...............&#34;
  <BR> <BR>The suggestions which I have made so far have not really hit the mark and
  I would appreciate any suggestions which anyone has. Last suggestions were two emigre
  fonts: &#39;Brothers&#39; for Alice &amp; &#39;Priori Sans&#39; for Ivy. <BR> <BR>Please
  fire away. <BR> <BR>Grant Dunlop <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/54202.jpg"
