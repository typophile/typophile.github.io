body: "Hello all,\r\n\r\nBelow are some links to a few fonts that I am wondering what
  they are. I'm not sure if they are just super scaled down fonts or they are actually
  pixel fonts. \r\n\r\nI really like this one - \"RX-7\" in the bottom corner:\r\nhttp://i34.tinypic.com/2nrlxmd.png\r\n\r\nSome
  others that are similar - Bottom Left-hand corner font:\r\n\r\nhttp://img.photobucket.com/albums/v222/9chamberse/01rx7touge.png\r\nhttp://img.photobucket.com/albums/v222/9chamberse/95silviastrawberryface.png\r\nhttp://img.photobucket.com/albums/v222/9chamberse/06skylineb324r.png\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\nP.S
  I love you guys (and gals!) \r\n\r\nFF"

  body: Thanks Mike! Any idea on the first one? I like the "R" especially. I can't
    describe it properly, but the fact that it is not connected to the first "leg"
    is what I am really looking for. I have been searching the free fonts on Dafont
    under techno, but I'm having no luck :-(

  body: "The R might have had the cutout added after the fact. Look for the letter
    shapes without worrying about that part, is my advice. The R may not have started
    that way, is what I'm saying.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I downloaded \"SF Transrobotics\" from Dafont and used the Bold version to
    make the following simulation of the RX7 lettering. I added three black rectangles
    (one at each corner of the X and one below the counter of the R). I converted
    the R to outlines and moved the points of the leg towards the stem of the R, to
    widen the leg. I made a slim white rectangle to make the cutout on the R, and
    then I slanted everything by 12 degrees. Could have chopped off the corner of
    the 7 with a white square.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/RX7sim_4569.gif]"
