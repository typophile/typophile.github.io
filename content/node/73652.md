  am designing a logo for a friend working as a freelance researcher/strategy advisor/writer
  in London. Among his clients are the BBC and iD. He sums up the majority of his
  clients up as generally quite conservative, but looking for his creative input.
  The research/insight he provides is based on fact but also a degree of creativity
  so the branding needs a science-meets-creativity feel. He would like the logo to
  be 'simple, current and refined' and is a firm believer in less is more.\r\n\r\nThank
  you!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nSorry the slow response - I hope you're all still following
    this thread! Monday was a public holiday here in England... and all of a sudden
    it's Thursday! All work and no play makes jack a dull boy.\r\n\r\nThank you very
    much for your comments. Penn sums it up well; they are all clich\xE9 and don't
    really reflect any of my friends character. Bezier's suggestion, \"Clarity\" in
    a rectangle, is very much the direction I would like to go in but my friend is
    keen to have a mark of some sort and so my trail of thought has been something
    like this:\r\n\r\n1. \"Focus on the word clarity & use as little as possible to
    communicate that.\"\r\n2. Q. What symbolises clarity? \r\n3. A. Diamonds\r\n4.
    Q. What is the simplest way I can illustrate this?\r\n5. A. Using basic shapes\r\n6.
    Reference: wooden mosaic toys (they're not really diamond shaped but in my mind
    closely related)\r\n7. Add a heavy dose of Swiss design - Akzidenz Grotesk\r\n8.
    And ta-da! \r\n\r\nWhat do you think? Good/bad/off my rocker? My friend's always
    sharply dressed - wears bright but slightly muted colours. He has a Slavic background
    but is often misplaced as Scandinavian. If he were a movement he'd be a modernist.
    \r\n\r\nYour comments would be much appreciated. \r\n\r\nWith thanks,\r\n\r\nR\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/clarity_logo_v2_5388.png]"

    simplest one.\r\n\r\n<cite>\"2. Q. What symbolises clarity?\r\n3. A. Diamonds\"</cite>\r\nMaybe
    we have a language-barrier issue here (English not being my first language) but
    to me \xABclarity\xBB would best be shown by transparency. Crystal is clear. Glass
    is clear. Diamonds are potentially too many other things (precious, valuable,
    shiny, a girl's best friend); and the many colors in these recent drafts make
    this approach seem even more complex.\r\nI'd go back and look for <em>simple</em>
    shapes, in search of not complexity but transparency.\r\nOne good thing you have
    is symmetry, which helps make it feel more balanced and regular, which helps \xABclarity\xBB
    I think.\r\n\r\nHow about just a wordmark? Or if you need a mark, maybe look at
    \"C\"s from typefaces with \xABsimple\xBB, reduced (~geometric) shapes?"

  body: "This most recent mark you have is beautiful. I too wonder, however, how much
    it relates to the idea of clarity. Everything is a bit too complex at the moment.
    The all blue mark is the most suited to the idea of clarity because it simplifies
    the mark.\r\n\r\nThe type you have is a little heavy for my tastes.\r\n\r\nAs
    far as orientation of the mark with the type goes, I prefer the one in the dead
    center. It looks the most balanced."

    think this is an issue with language - more with my tail of thought! I was thinking
    of the phrase 'crystal clear' but confusing crystals with diamonds... dear me.
    \r\n\r\nI agree the link between diamonds and clarity is a bit strenuous and complex
    and could be confused with too many other things. I need to go back to the drawing
    board again. \r\n\r\nI may not have time to post anything new on this till mid-week
    but please keep an eye on this thread.\r\n\r\nVery many thanks."
