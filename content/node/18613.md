    for laser printers. The resemblance is so close that Charis SIL includes Charter's
    license in the copyright notice.</em>\r\n\r\nUmm\u2026 is this legit?"

      needed by many minority languages. These fonts allow missionaries under the
      auspice of organisation affiliated with SIL to translate and publish in the
      those languages, but most importantly it gives the people themselves better
      access to orthographies of their languages."

  body: "Adobe donated the basic styles of Utopia, Bitstream donated the basic styles
    of Charter and Courier, and URW donated the basic styles of Nimbus Sans, Nimbus
    Roman and Courier to various open-source projects under pretty flexible terms.
    Quite a few derivative designs have legitimately emerged from these donations.
    \r\n\r\nI should note though that if you want a serious Cyrillic Charter, you
    should get the one designed by Vladimir Yefimov and published by ParaType rather
    than the one that comes with Charis, which is rather hideous. \r\n\r\nA."
