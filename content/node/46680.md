    On a webserver?"

    result is pixel image."

  body: "Most font vendors wouldn't consider Web server based rendering \u201Cembedding\u201D
    as such, but it doesn\u2019t fit into the normal/traditional EULA model either
    - where you're counting users and maybe output devices. For this reason Ascender
    and others do licenses fonts under a per-Web-server license."

  body: PHP embedding is a bad term. I mean creating an image with text in it dynamically
    using PHP. To do so you need to have the font files on your web server. Could
    a skilled programmer find the files and download them?

  body: 'You need to check the EULA for "server use" not "embedding". As Sii already
    said this sort of use usually requires an additional server license. '

    server is pwned by a hacker - so are the fonts. But unless these are super secret
    proprietary fonts, that's likely to be inconsequential. There are easier ways
    to steal fonts. "

  body: In that case, I'd need to purchase an extra license. I might just have to
    anyway, cause PHP seems to mess up anti alias for dark coloured text.
