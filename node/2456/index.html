  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">In the spirit of dusting off work in progress, here's a specimen of a face I'm working on. This is an early port I made to the Mac several months ago to see how it looks on screen- The actual font is being designed on my Palm Vx, and I can already notice changes from this specimen.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->How small can you go and maintain legibility? By allowing the ascenders and descenders to define the word shape, the 4px x-height is surprisingly readable. I'm curious to hear your thoughts. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">For the design constraints, it's pretty good! <!-- raw HTML omitted -->At that size you'd normally use caps, but you never know what could be useful, so&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Very smart to sacrifice some x-height discrimination in favor of boumas (word shapes). But the clogging in &quot;e&quot; and &quot;g&quot; (and in &quot;a&quot;, &quot;s&quot; and &quot;z&quot; to a lesser extent) is a problem. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Even in a 4pix x-height there are ways to avoid clogging, although it leads to some unconventional forms. For example, a 4pix bicameral &quot;a&quot; is one where the bottom row of a conventional 5-pix bicameral &quot;a&quot; is dumped (and the same could be done for the &quot;e&quot;, but at the top). For the &quot;g&quot;, I'd go with the Koch form (again). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It's tempting to fall back on mono forms for &quot;a&quot; and &quot;g&quot;, but the bi forms are what would make Benson Linear unique, and I'm glad to see you going for them. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As for the caps, I think there are some legibility issues (like the &quot;B&quot;). BTW, since you have 2 pixels of descender, have you considered taking the caps one pixel lower than the lc baseline? I think they can afford to be bigger anyway. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Anyways, keep it up! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>

In my current design (my first Latin text face, I admit) I have the exclamation higher than the question mark (even though the reversed Spanish ones have the same span/location). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It's tempting to align the excalamation (and question) marks with the UC and/or ascender height, but in actual text setting, where does the mark usually end up? After a string of mostly x-height glyphs. In text setting apparent size is much more important than alignment (which I feel is generally a very superficial merit in a text face). Since the question mark has a much stronger top than the exclamation, it only makes sense for the latter to go taller. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Note: Thanks to OpenType you can now make exclamation marks of varying height, and specify which one to use when. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">That's an interesting thought&hellip;.
